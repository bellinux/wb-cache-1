50|$|The {{suspension}} system utilised fully independent front suspension, with MacPherson struts, track <b>control</b> <b>arms</b> and anti-roll bar. The rear suspension was quite advanced (when using a solid live rear axle), {{in that the}} rear <b>axle</b> was <b>controlled</b> by double unequal length trailing arms and a panhard rod, with coil springs and direct acting dampers. This design proved far superior to many of its contemporaries, especially with vehicle stability and handling.|$|R

In this work it is mainly concentrated on stiffness, slippage and damage of upper <b>control</b> <b>arm.</b> The upper <b>control</b> <b>arm</b> is subjected to different type of loads such as static loads and cyclic loads. Stiffness is improved by changing shape and size of upper <b>control</b> <b>arm</b> this is achieved by static analysis. This analysis is carried out to find displacement, stress and stiffness. Due to some loading conditions, slippage occurs in between arm and bush. In this work slippage analysis carried out to check whether slippage occurs in the upper <b>control</b> <b>arm.</b> Fatigue analysis carried out to determine the damage and life of upper <b>control</b> <b>arm...</b>|$|R

30|$|Guideline-based {{medication}} regimens {{which included}} statin therapy were reportedly used at baseline, during the trial, or throughout follow-up, in 24 (34 %) of the <b>control</b> <b>arm</b> comparisons. In a further seven comparisons (10 %), statin therapy was not explicitly reported but probable given {{the dates of}} participant recruitment. Lipid-lowering therapy was either not begun in the <b>control</b> <b>arm,</b> or reported as not used, in 17 comparisons (24 %) and was unlikely used in a further 24 comparisons with recruitment and follow-up periods preceding 1994. Overall, this resulted in statin use in the <b>control</b> <b>arm</b> (matched with comparable use in the intervention arm) for 40 % of comparisons, 56 % of comparisons without statin use in either arm and three trials [46, 48, 60] in which the intervention arm included a specific pharmacological lipid-lowering strategy compared to the <b>control</b> <b>arm</b> (Table  1).|$|R

5000|$|The front {{suspension}} {{consists of}} {{upper and lower}} <b>control</b> <b>arms</b> with coilover shocks. A common misconception with this platform is that the front end has struts; however, since there is an upper <b>control</b> <b>arm</b> they are actually coilover shocks. Brakes were a vented rotor / single-piston caliper with Sport model Thunderbirds receiving a larger diameter rotor. The rear suspension consisted of upper and lower <b>control</b> <b>arms</b> with coil spring and shock. Varying sway bar diameters were used among the different models of Cougar and Thunderbird.

40|$|Abstract: This study {{proposes a}} {{structural}} design method {{for the upper}} <b>control</b> <b>arm</b> installed at the rear side of a SUV. The weight of <b>control</b> <b>arm</b> can be reduced by applying the design and material technologies. In this research, the former includes optimization technology, and the latter the technologies for selecting aluminum as a steel-substitute material. Strength assessment {{is the most important}} design criterion in the structural design of a <b>control</b> <b>arm.</b> At the proto design stage of a new <b>control</b> <b>arm,</b> FE (finite element) analysis is often utilized to predict its strength. This study considers the static strength in the optimization process. The inertia relief method for FE analysis is utilized to simulate the static loading conditions. According to the classification of structural optimization, the structural design of a <b>control</b> <b>arm</b> is included in the category of shape optimization. In this study, the kriging interpolation method is adopted to obtain the minimum weight satisfying the strength constraint. Optimum designs are obtained by ANSYS WORKBENCH and the in-house program, EXCEL-kriging program. The optimum results determined from the in-house program are compared with those of ANSYS WORKBENCH...|$|R

40|$|The Lower <b>Control</b> <b>arm</b> is {{the most}} vital {{component}} in a suspension system. It is usually a steel bracket that pivots on rubber bushings mounted to the chassis. The other end supports the lower ball joint. Significant amount of loads are transmitted through the <b>control</b> <b>arm</b> while it serves to maintain the contact between the wheel and the road and thus providing precise control of the vehicle. The finite element analysis of the <b>control</b> <b>arm</b> using NEiNASTRAN is presented. Inertia relief analysis was carried out as the measured road loads were in self equilibrium. The zone of maximum stress {{in most of the}} load cases studied is close to the left strut bush and around the lower ball joint bush. Since the stresses exceed the material yield strength, a nonlinear static analysis of the <b>control</b> <b>arm</b> was also carried out using NEiNASTRAN and the results are compared well with MSC. NASTRAN and ABAQUS analysis. Multi-axial Fatigue analysis using NEiNASTRAN and WINLIFE is discussed. ...|$|R

40|$|Objective: To {{evaluate}} {{a change in}} tumour characteristics and applied treatments over time in the <b>control</b> <b>arm</b> of all centres of the European Randomized study of Screening for Prostate Cancer (ERSPC) and to compare this with similar data of the screening arm. Methods: Between 1993 and 2003, 182, 160 men, aged 50 - 74 years, were randomised to the screening arm (N = 82, 816) and the <b>control</b> <b>arm</b> (N = 99, 184). Men in the screening arm were offered Prostate Specific Antigen (PSA) testing every 4 years whilst men in the <b>control</b> <b>arm</b> received usual care. Tumour characteristics and treatment were evaluated in all men diagnosed with prostate cancer up to December 2006 or the third screening round. Data on the <b>control</b> <b>arm</b> were divided into 3 periods: 1994 - 1998, 1999 - 2002 and 2003 - 2006. Results: Tumour characteristics were more favourable over time in both the control and the screening arm, with especially increasing proportions of T 1 C tumours with 29 % in 1994 - 1998 versus 50 % in 2003 - 2006 and 48 % at the initial screening round versus 75 % at the third screening round, respectively. Tumour characteristics observed in the last period of the <b>control</b> <b>arm</b> were comparable to tumour characteristics in the initial screening round. In the <b>control</b> <b>arm,</b> treatment changed over time with surgery as the most common treatment in the entire observed period, but almost doubling of expectant management and the combination of hormone therapy and radiotherapy over time. In the initial screening round, surgery {{was the most common}} treatment (42 %), changing over time to expectant management as the most frequently applied treatment in the third screening round (33 %). Conclusion: Tumour characteristics in the <b>control</b> <b>arm</b> became more favourable over time and show similarity with prostate cancer cases detected at the initial screening round. The most prominent change in treatment over time was an increase of application of expectant management in both arms of the ERSPC. These observations reflect an increasing rate of opportunistic testing over time in men randomised to the <b>control</b> <b>arm...</b>|$|R
