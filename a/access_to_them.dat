5|$|After {{one block}} of Main Street, NY32 and NY212 turn onto Market Street, then east onto Ulster Avenue after another block. As it crosses the {{railroad}} tracks and leaves the village, the road widens and becomes a commercial highway just before reaching a Thruway exit. This, the fourth time NY32 has crossed the Thruway, {{is the first time}} it does so at an exit. Beyond the overpass, the concurrency ends when NY32 turns and heads north once again. A tight nearby on-ramp provides access to the southbound Thruway. NY32 does not enter the Catskills but provides <b>access</b> <b>to</b> <b>them</b> along this stretch.|$|E
5|$|To {{insulate}} {{the sacred}} {{power in the}} sanctuary from the impurities of the outside world, the Egyptians enclosed temple sanctuaries and greatly restricted <b>access</b> <b>to</b> <b>them.</b> People other than kings and high priests were thus denied contact with cult statues. The only exception was during festival processions, when the statue was carried out of the temple but still enclosed in a portable shrine. People did have less direct means of interaction. The more public parts of temples often incorporated small places for prayer, from doorways to freestanding chapels near {{the back of the}} temple building. Communities also built and managed small chapels for their own use, and some families had shrines inside their homes. Despite the gulf that separated humanity from the divine, the Egyptians were surrounded by opportunities to approach their gods.|$|E
5|$|In Wings of Liberty, Narud and the Moebius Foundation backed Tychus Findlay's {{contact with}} James Raynor {{as a way}} to get around an {{imperial}} decree from Arcturus Mengsk which made it illegal to traffic in alien goods. Narud would later appear by proxy as the Moebius Foundation's representative during a mission briefing on Tyrador, wherein Narud lent James Raynor his medical transport ships to help Raynor destroy the foundation's data cores in order to prevent the Queen of Blades from gaining <b>access</b> <b>to</b> <b>them.</b> On the eve of the invasion of Char, Raynor learned from Valerian that Narud had been working with the Dominion's Crown Prince for the entire duration of the game. In the aftermath of the successful de-infestation of the Queen of Blades, a civil war erupts between Arcturus and Valerian; in an attempt to find a safe haven, Valerian and Raynor seek shelter with the Moebius Foundation. Initially, Narud greeted and temporarily sheltered the group, but after examining the Xel'Naga artifact and thoroughly questioning Raynor about Kerrigan, Narud revealed his allegiance to Arcturus and sold out the group to an incoming Dominion fleet, but the fleet's attempt to kill Kerrigan fails.|$|E
40|$|We {{present a}} method to {{decompose}} a declarative knowledge base, given by a logic program under Answer Set Semantics with <b>access</b> <b>to</b> external sources. It overcomes the ineffectiveness of current methods {{due to a lack}} of structural information about these sources, viewed as black boxes, by exploiting independency information in <b>accesses</b> <b>to</b> <b>them.</b> <b>To</b> this end, we develop a generic notion of domain independence that allows to restrict the evaluation domain and, as a consequence, to prune unnecessary dependency assumptions between atoms. This leads to increased decomposability; we demonstrate this by an evaluation method for HEX-programs based on program rewriting, which may yield large performance gains. While developed for a particular formalism, the notions and ideas of this paper might be adapted to related formalisms as well. ...|$|R

The shuffle index {{has been}} {{recently}} proposed for organizing and accessing data in outsourcing scenarios while protecting the confi-dentiality {{of the data}} {{as well as of}} the <b>accesses</b> <b>to</b> <b>them.</b> In this paper, we extend the shuffle index to the use of multiple servers for storing data, introducing a new protection technique (shadow) and enriching the orig-inal ones by operating in a distributed scenario. Our distributed shuffle index produces a significant increase in the protection of the system, with no additional costs. ...|$|R
