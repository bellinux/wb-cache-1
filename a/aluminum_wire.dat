40|$|Publication Date (Web) : January 27, 2015 In this study, {{we present}} a nanoengineered therapeutic-releasing system based on <b>aluminum</b> <b>wires</b> {{featuring}} nanoporous anodic alumina layers and chitosan coatings. Nanoporous anodic alumina layers are produced {{on the surface of}} <b>aluminum</b> <b>wires</b> by electrochemical anodization. These nanoporous layers with precisely engineered nanopore geometry are used as nanocontainers for bovine serum albumin molecules labeled with fluorescein isothiocyanate (BSA-FITC), which is selected as a model drug. The surface of these therapeutic-releasing implants is coated with a biocompatible and biodegradable polymer, chitosan, in order to achieve a sustained release of protein over extended periods of time. The performance of this therapeutic-releasing device is systematically assessed through a series of experiments under static and dynamic flow conditions. In these experiments, the effect of such parameters as the number of layers of chitosan coating and the temperature and pH of the eluting medium is established. The obtained results reveal that the proposed therapeutic-releasing system based on nanoporous <b>aluminum</b> <b>wires</b> can be engineered with sustained release performance for up to 6. 5 weeks, which is a critical factor for medical treatments using sensitive therapeutics such as proteins and genes when a localized delivery is desired.

40|$|AbstractElectrically driven rapid {{vaporization}} of thin <b>aluminum</b> <b>wires</b> is {{an innovative}} forming process. In this manuscript, joining of tubular workpieces by expansion using {{this technique is}} investigated. The goal is to identify the influence of major process parameters, like input energy and discharge frequency on the workpiece deformation, the forming velocity, and the resulting joint strength. Therefore, free-forming as well as joining experiments were conducted. During these experiments, thin <b>aluminum</b> <b>wires</b> were intentionally vaporized {{in the center of}} aluminum tubes. The pressure was transmitted from the region of vaporization to the inside wall of the tubes via an elastomer medium. In the free forming experiments it as found that, at the same charging energy level, a decrease of the discharge's rise time leads to an increase of the maximum velo ity. Therefore, the discharge frequency was found to {{have a positive effect on}} process efficiency.

40|$|The main {{failure cause}} in {{state-of-the-art}} power electronic modules is the bond-wire lift-off. Therefore new wires like aluminum-copper composites [1] or pure copper wires [2] are in development. The copper-wire bonding process {{is still not}} state-of-the-art [3] and all other alternatives to <b>aluminum</b> <b>wires</b> are not mature. To evaluate the lifetime of different bond wire diameters, power cycling tests (test system described in[4]) were performed with IGBTs soldered to direct-copper-bonded substrates. The dies were bonded with two groups of wires. The first one consisted of ten samples with 125 Âµm diameter <b>aluminum</b> <b>wires</b> and the second one of ten devices with 375 Âµm diameter <b>aluminum</b> <b>wires.</b> The results showed that all samples with the thicker wires failed due to bond wire lift off. In contra st the life limiting factor of the test group with the smaller wires was the solder layer. To prove that, cross-sections were analyzed with light microscopy. The results were also evaluated by a finite element analysis (FEM), which showed that the thermo-mechanical stress was much lower in the smaller wires. The FEM-model was simulated undergoing a temperature cycle ranging from 77 Â°F to 311 Â°F. The plastic strain {{on the underside of}} the bond foot, which resulted from the thermal expansion mismatch at the interface to the semiconductor, was then calculated. By taking a higher number of small wires instead of a few big ones, a low cost alternative (compared to copper wires) was shown to improve the lifetime of the power modules.

50|$|<b>Aluminum</b> <b>wire</b> {{used before}} the mid-1970s had a {{somewhat}} {{higher rate of}} creep, but a more significant issue was that <b>aluminum</b> <b>wire</b> critically had a coefficient of expansion that varied significantly from steel screws commonly used in lieu of brass screws around this time for terminations at devices such as outlets and switches. Aluminum and steel expand and contract at significantly different rates under thermal load, so a connection can become loose, particularly for older terminations initially installed with inadequate torque of the screws combined with creep of the aluminum over time. Loose connections get progressively worse over time.|$|E
