25|$|Robert Stirling was a Scottish {{minister}} {{who invented the}} first practical example of a closed cycle <b>air</b> <b>engine</b> in 1816, and it was suggested by Fleeming Jenkin as early as 1884 that all such engines should therefore generically be called Stirling engines. This naming proposal found little favour, and the various types on the market continued to be known {{by the name of}} their individual designers or manufacturers, e.g., Rider's, Robinson's, or Heinrici's (hot) <b>air</b> <b>engine.</b> In the 1940s, the Philips company was seeking a suitable name for its own version of the 'air engine', which by that time had been tested with working fluids other than air, and decided upon 'Stirling engine' in April 1945. However, nearly thirty years later, Graham Walker still had cause to bemoan the fact such terms as 'hot air engine' remained interchangeable with 'Stirling engine', which itself was applied widely and indiscriminately; a situation that continues.|$|E

25|$|A turbo charged, liquid cooled, multi-fuel {{diesel engine}} is used, which can develop 510bhp. The vehicle has eight-wheel drive {{and has an}} {{automatic}} reversible hydro mechanical transmission, which is capable of providing different speeds to {{each side of the}} vehicle. Duplicated electrical and compressed <b>air</b> <b>engine</b> start systems are also used. The wheels are utilized with independent torsion-bar suspension and the traverse arms have high capacity telescopic hydraulic shock absorbers.|$|E
25|$|The gas used {{should have}} a low heat capacity, so that a given amount of {{transferred}} heat leads to a large increase in pressure. Considering this issue, helium {{would be the best}} gas because of its very low heat capacity. Air is a viable working fluid, but the oxygen in a highly pressurized <b>air</b> <b>engine</b> can cause fatal accidents caused by lubricating oil explosions. Following one such accident Philips pioneered the use of other gases to avoid such risk of explosions.|$|E
25|$|The {{regenerator}} is the {{key component}} invented by Robert Stirling and its presence distinguishes a true Stirling engine from any other closed cycle hot <b>air</b> <b>engine.</b> Many small 'toy' Stirling engines, particularly low-temperature difference (LTD) types, {{do not have a}} distinct regenerator component and might be considered hot air engines; however a small amount of regeneration is provided by the surface of the displacer itself and the nearby cylinder wall, or similarly the passage connecting the hot and cold cylinders of an alpha configuration engine.|$|E

25|$|Most {{technically}} advanced Stirling engines, {{like those}} developed for United States government labs, use helium as the working gas, because it functions {{close to the}} efficiency and power density of hydrogen with fewer of the material containment issues. Helium is inert, and hence not flammable. Helium is relatively expensive, and must be supplied as bottled gas. One test showed hydrogen to be 5% (absolute) more efficient than helium (24% relatively) in the GPU-3 Stirling engine. The researcher Allan Organ demonstrated that a well-designed <b>air</b> <b>engine</b> is theoretically just as efficient as a helium or hydrogen engine, but helium and hydrogen engines are several times more powerful per unit volume.|$|E
25|$|Subsequent to the {{replacement}} of the Dundee foundry engine there is no record of the Stirling brothers having any further involvement with <b>air</b> <b>engine</b> development, and the Stirling engine never again competed with steam as an industrial scale power source. (Steam boilers were becoming safer and steam engines more efficient, thus presenting less of a target for rival prime movers). However, beginning about 1860, smaller engines of the Stirling/hot air type were produced in substantial numbers for applications in which reliable sources of low to medium power were required, such as pumping air for church organs or raising water. These smaller engines generally operated at lower temperatures so as not to tax available materials, and so were relatively inefficient. Their selling point was that unlike steam engines, they could be operated safely by anybody capable of managing a fire. Several types remained in production beyond the end of the century, but apart from a few minor mechanical improvements the design of the Stirling engine in general stagnated during this period.|$|E
2500|$|The Stirling engine (or Stirling's <b>air</b> <b>engine</b> as it {{was known}} at the time) was invented and {{patented}} in 1816. It followed earlier attempts at making an <b>air</b> <b>engine</b> but was probably the first put to practical use when, in 1818, an engine built by Stirling was employed pumping water in a quarry. The main subject of Stirling's original patent was a heat exchanger, which he called an [...] "economiser" [...] for its enhancement of fuel economy {{in a variety of}} applications. The patent also described in detail the employment of one form of the economiser in his unique closed-cycle <b>air</b> <b>engine</b> design in which application it is now generally known as a [...] "regenerator". Subsequent development by Robert Stirling and his brother James, an engineer, resulted in patents for various improved configurations of the original engine including pressurization, which by 1843, had sufficiently increased power output to drive all the machinery at a Dundee iron foundry.|$|E
50|$|Power cycles {{can also}} be divided {{according}} {{to the type of}} heat engine they seek to model. The most common cycles used to model internal combustion engines are the Otto cycle, which models gasoline engines, and the Diesel cycle, which models diesel engines. Cycles that model external combustion engines include the Brayton cycle, which models gas turbines, the Rankine cycle, which models steam turbines, the Stirling cycle, which models hot <b>air</b> <b>engines,</b> and the Ericsson cycle, which also models hot <b>air</b> <b>engines.</b>|$|R
50|$|Compressed <b>air</b> <b>engines</b> {{reduce the}} cost of vehicle production, because {{there is no need to}} build a cooling system, spark plugs, starter motor, or mufflers.|$|R

The 455, a long-stroke engine {{also available in}} the full-size Pontiac line {{as well as the}} Grand Prix, was dubiously rated by Pontiac as only moderately stronger than the base 350 HP 400 CID and less powerful than the [...] Ram Air III.

For $650.00. a 390-horsepower 428 cubic inch engine was installed {{in place of the}} 400. The 428 CI engine was disassembled and blueprinted to produce more than the advertised factory 390 horsepower and easily spinning to 5700 RPM. Car and Driver road tested the 428 CI powered car with the Turbo-Hydramatic transmission and 3.55 gears. It could do 0–60 MPH in 5.2 seconds, 0–100 in 12.9 seconds, and the 1/4 mile in 13.8 seconds @ 104 MPH. This compared to a [...] Car Life road test of a 400 CI powered GTO with a Ram <b>Air</b> <b>engine,</b> four-speed transmission, and 3.90 gear which did 0–60 in 6.6 seconds, 0–100 in 14.6 seconds, and the 1/4 mile in 14.53 @ 99.7 MPH. Car and Driver wrote that the 428 CI powered car was [...] "a fine, exciting car for either touring or tooting around in traffic. Not overly fussy. Not difficult to drive–-up to a point. Too much throttle at the wrong time will spin the car, or send it rocketing off the road and into the farmer's field. You can light up the car's tires like it was an AA-fueler anytime the notion seizes your fancy." [...] On the other hand, according to Car Life, the Ram Air powered car [...] "likes to run between 3000 and 6000 RPM. Below 3000, the GTO ran flat and a bit rough. Part-throttle driving at 2000 RPM around town was difficult and unpleasant. Freeway cruising at 4000 RPM is anything but pleasant and promises short life for hard working engine components. Also, driving the GTO on wet roads with this deep geared axle was thrilling. Rear tire breakaway could be provoked by a slight jab at the accelerator, sending the car into a minor skid that usually used up more than one lane of space." ...|$|E
