25|$|This move, and the {{addition}} of then-White House correspondent Dan Rather to the reporting team, made the program into a strong ratings hit and, eventually, a general cultural phenomenon. This was no less than a stunning reversal of the historically poor ratings performances of documentary programs on network television. By 1976, 60 Minutes became the top-rated program on Sunday nights in the U.S. By 1979, it had achieved the #1 spot among all television programs in the Nielsen ratings, unheard of before for a news broadcast in prime time. This success translated into great profits for CBS; <b>advertising</b> <b>rates</b> went from $17,000 per 30-second spot in 1975 to $175,000 in 1982.|$|E

He opposed the TTC's elimination of environmentally friendly trolley services in January 1992, and led a successful initiative for their restoration later in the same year.

25|$|Like most {{affiliates}} that pre-empt poorer performing network programs, KYW-TV {{used the}} pre-emptions {{in order to}} gain an increase in local <b>advertising</b> <b>rates</b> which potentially come with ratings increases. This proved to be a very profitable decision at first, as KYW-TV was either first or second in the Philadelphia television ratings for most of the 1960s and 1970s. However, the station (and NBC) faltered in the late 1970s, and by 1980 KYW-TV was the lowest-rated network affiliate in Philadelphia. It stayed in the ratings basement even when NBC rebounded to become the nation's most-watched network by 1985. For the rest of its tenure as an NBC affiliate, KYW-TV was the network's lowest-rated major-market affiliate during a very prosperous period for NBC as a whole.

25|$|Initially, The Edge of Night showed promise when {{it began}} airing on ABC. It was the first serial to change {{networks}} (the only other to do so was the Procter & Gamble-packaged Search for Tomorrow, which moved from CBS to NBC in 1982); it aired in a late afternoon time slot of 4/3 p.m. for ABC affiliates in the Eastern and Central time zones, and Noon for ABC affiliates in the Pacific time zone due to a different scheduling pattern for ABC's West Coast feed. At first, the show's overall ratings declined because fewer homes had access to it; this happened because many ABC affiliates had opted for local or syndicated programs at the 4/3 slot instead of the network feed for many years, and decided not to abandon the practice. As a result, in some markets, Edge disappeared after relocating from CBS to ABC. In other markets, stations (either a local ABC affiliate or an independent station which picked the show up) tape-delayed the program for morning slots, airing on a delay. Nevertheless, The Edge of Night was typically either first (or a close second) in its time slot in markets where the local ABC station cleared it at 4:00 p. m. (Eastern Time), due mainly to the weakness of competing programs on CBS and NBC. Further, the show's demographics were significantly better on ABC because the show got its youth {{and some of its}} male demographics back; thus, ABC was able to charge higher <b>advertising</b> <b>rates</b> for it than several series with higher audience ratings.|$|E
