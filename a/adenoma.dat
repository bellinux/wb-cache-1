30|$|The World Health Organisation (WHO) categorises {{pituitary}} tumours as typical <b>adenomas,</b> atypical <b>adenomas</b> and pituitary carcinomas, {{with typical}} <b>adenomas</b> constituting the major class.

40|$|The current {{classification}} of clinically nonfunctioning pituitary <b>adenomas</b> {{is based on}} immunocytochemical and ultrastructural studies. However, {{a number of cases}} have less distinctive features that cannot be easily conformed with the prevailing morphologic classifications. The diagnostic information contributed by the determination of the nuclear DNA content (DNA ploidy level) and quantitative chromatic pattern description as opposed to the morphofunctional diagnosis in clinically nonfunctioning <b>adenomas</b> was consequently investigated in a series of 71 pituitary <b>adenomas,</b> including 31 null-cell <b>adenomas,</b> 35 gonadotropin <b>adenomas,</b> and 5 nonfunctioning <b>adenomas</b> that were not examined by electron microscopy. DNA ploidy level (8 variables) and quantitative chromatin pattern description (30 variables) were carried out by means of the computer-assisted microscope analysis of 80 - 1600 Feulgen-stained nuclei analyzed/case. The diagnostic information contributed by the 38 quantitative variables was determined by multifactorial statistical analysis (i. e. Discriminant Analysis). This computer-assisted classification significantly differentiated nulLcell <b>adenomas</b> from gonadotropin <b>adenomas</b> (p = 0. 0025). In addition, it was able to differentiate three major subtypes of nonfunctioning <b>adenomas</b> {{on the basis of their}} immunohistochemical profiles. These were the immunonegative <b>adenomas,</b> the follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) -positive <b>adenomas,</b> and the a-subunit (a) and/or luteiwizing hormone (LH) -positive <b>adenomas</b> (p < 0. 0001 to p < 0. 001).

5|$|Almost {{all cases}} of {{pituitary}} apoplexy arise from a pituitary <b>adenoma,</b> a benign tumor of the pituitary gland. In 80%, {{the patient has}} been previously unaware of this (although some will retrospectively report associated symptoms). It was previously thought that particular types of pituitary tumors were more prone to apoplexy than others, but {{this has not been}} confirmed. In absolute terms, only a very small proportion of pituitary tumors eventually undergoes apoplexy. In an analysis of incidentally found pituitary tumors, apoplexy occurred in 0.2% annually, but the risk was higher in tumors larger than 10mm ("macroadenomas") and tumors that were growing more rapidly; in a meta-analysis, not all these associations achieved statistical significance.|$|E
40|$|Cytogenetic {{changes are}} widely unknown for nonpolypoid (synonymously termed as “flat” or “depressed”) {{colorectal}} <b>adenomas.</b> A comparison with polypoid <b>adenomas</b> {{will contribute to}} the discussion whether different genetic pathways for colorectal tumorigenesis depending on its origin from nonpolypoid or polypoid <b>adenomas</b> exist. Tissue samples of nonpolypoid (n = 22), polypoid (n = 28) <b>adenomas,</b> carcinomas ex-nonpolypoid <b>adenomas</b> (n = 9), carcinomas ex-polypoid <b>adenomas</b> (n = 14), and normal colonic mucosa (n = 9) were investigated by comparative genomic hybridization of whole genomic DNA. Chromosomal imbalances were detected from average comparative genomic hybridization profiles for each entity. Nonpolypoid <b>adenomas</b> show recurrent chromosomal losses on chromosomes 16, 17 p, 18, 20, and 22 and gains on chromosomes 2 q, 4 q, 5, 6, 8 q, 12 q, and 13 q. In polypoid <b>adenomas</b> losses of whole chromosomes 16, 18, and 22 and gains of chromosomes 7 q and 13 were detected. The frequency of copy number changes was higher in nonpolypoid compared to polypoid <b>adenomas</b> and early onset of chromosomal changes became apparent in low-grade dysplasias of nonpolypoid <b>adenomas.</b> Gains on chromosomes 2 q, 5, 6, 8 q, and 12 q and losses on chromosomes 17 p and 20 occurred exclusively in nonpolypoid <b>adenomas,</b> whereas 16 p deletions are significantly more frequent in nonpolypoid than in polypoid <b>adenomas.</b> Carcinomas ex-nonpolypoid <b>adenomas</b> are characterized by more complex aberration patterns compared to nonpolypoid <b>adenomas</b> exhibiting frequent losses on chromosomes 8 p, 12 q, 14, 15 q, 16, 17 p, 18, and 22 and gains on 3 q, 5, 6, 7, 8 q, 12 q, and 13, respectively. Normal colonic mucosa showed no chromosomal imbalances.

40|$|Serrated <b>adenomas</b> are {{characterized}} by a saw-toothed growth pattern with epithelial dysplasia (intraepithelial neoplasia). The CpG island methylator phenotype (CIMP) is a recently described mechanism for tumorigenesis in colorectal carcinomas and <b>adenomas</b> characterized by methylation of multiple CpG islands. The role of these epigenetic alterations in the pathogenesis of serrated <b>adenomas</b> is not clear. We therefore evaluated CIMP in 22 sporadic serrated <b>adenomas</b> and 6 serrated <b>adenomas</b> with multiple (6 to 10) hyperplastic polyps, including 5 with admixed hyperplastic glands and adenomatous glands, and compared the results with 34 conventional <b>adenomas.</b> Bisulfite methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction {{was used for the}} p 16 and hMLH 1 genes, and three MINT (methylated in tumor) loci (MINT 1, MINT 2, and MINT 31). Patients with sporadic serrated <b>adenomas</b> had a higher frequency of hyperplastic polyps (1. 3 ± 1. 6) as compared to patients with tubular <b>adenomas</b> (0. 4 ± 0. 9, P = 0. 02). Mean number of methylated sites was significantly higher in sporadic serrated <b>adenomas</b> (2. 0 ± 1. 7) than in tubular <b>adenomas</b> (0. 8 ± 0. 9, P = 0. 00001). Sporadic serrated <b>adenomas</b> had significantly more frequent methylation of MINT 1 (48 %, 10 of 22) and MINT 2 (71 %, 15 of 21) than tubular <b>adenomas</b> (9 %, 3 of 34, P = 0. 001; and 18 %, 6 of 34, P = 0. 0001), respectively. Concordant methylation of two or more sites (CIMP-high) was also more frequent in sporadic serrated <b>adenomas</b> (68 %, 15 of 22) than in tubular <b>adenomas</b> (18 %, 6 of 34, P = 0. 0005). All five serrated <b>adenomas</b> with admixed hyperplastic glands and adenomatous glands were CIMP-high.

5|$|Cushing's {{syndrome}} is {{the manifestation of}} glucocorticoid excess.

5|$|Excessive {{production}} of the thyroid hormones is called hyperthyroidism, which is most commonly a result of Graves' disease, a toxic multinodular goitre, a solitary thyroid <b>adenoma,</b> or inflammation.

Hyperthyroidism often causes a variety of non-specific symptoms including weight loss, increased appetite, insomnia, decreased tolerance of heat, tremor, palpitations, anxiety and nervousness. In some cases it can cause chest pain, diarrhoea, hair loss and muscle weakness. Such symptoms may be managed temporarily with drugs such as beta blockers.|$|E

40|$|Purpose: Duodenal {{polyposis}} {{and cancer}} are important causes of {{morbidity and mortality}} in familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) and MUTYH-associated polyposis (MAP). This study aimed to comprehensively characterize somatic genetic changes in FAP and MAP duodenal <b>adenomas</b> to better understand duodenal tumorigenesis in these disorders. Experimental Design: Sixty-nine <b>adenomas</b> were biopsied during endoscopy in 16 FAP and 10 MAP patients with duodenal polyposis. Ten FAP and 10 MAP <b>adenomas</b> and matched blood DNA samples were exome sequenced, 42 further <b>adenomas</b> underwent targeted sequencing, and 47 were studied by array comparative genomic hybridization. Findings in FAP and MAP duodenal <b>adenomas</b> were compared with each other and to the reported mutational landscape in FAP and MAP colorectal <b>adenomas.</b> Results: MAP duodenal <b>adenomas</b> had significantly more protein-changing somatic mutations (P = 0. 018), truncating mutations (P = 0. 006), and copy number variants (P = 0. 005) than FAP duodenal <b>adenomas,</b> even though MAP patients had lower Spigelman stage duodenal polyposis. Fifteen genes were significantly recurrently mutated. Targeted sequencing of APC, KRAS, PTCHD 2, and PLCL 1 identified further mutations in each of these genes in additional duodenal <b>adenomas.</b> In contrast to MAP and FAP colorectal <b>adenomas,</b> neither exome nor targeted sequencing identified WTX mutations (P = 0. 0017). Conclusions: The mutational landscapes in FAP and MAP duodenal <b>adenomas</b> overlapped with, but had significant differences to those reported in colorectal <b>adenomas.</b> The significantly higher burden of somatic mutations in MAP than FAP duodenal <b>adenomas</b> despite lower Spigelman stage disease could increase cancer risk in the context of apparently less severe benign disease...|$|R

25|$|In {{contrast}} to most other cancers, adrenocortical neoplasms {{appear to have}} decreased expression of H19. To determine a possible cause for the downregulation of H19, Gao et al. studied the methylation of 12 CpG sites in the H19 promoter in normal, hyperplasia, <b>adenoma</b> and carcinoma adrenals. They found that in carcinomas, there was more methylation of CpGs than in normal, hyperplasia and <b>adenoma</b> adrenals. Consequently, normal H19 expression was detectable in normal and hyperplasia adrenals, but in carcinomas and surprisingly, adenomas, there was a lower H19 expression that was coupled with detectable (increased) IGF2 expression.|$|E
25|$|The {{presence}} of IGF2 RNA expression when H19 RNA was downregulated provides {{further evidence that}} IGF2 expression is tightly coupled to and dependent on the absence of H19 expression. As well, the loss of H19 in adrenal cancers may be indicative of tumor suppressor activity by H19, leading Gao et al. {{to suggest that the}} loss of H19 and subsequent gain of IGF2 may be involved in adrenal cancer induction. Although Gao et al. found that there was not one CpG methylation site that was more important than the others in downregulating H19 expression, they did find that the increase in CpG methylation in adrenal carcinomas followed the pattern of methylation of the normal, hyperplasia and <b>adenoma</b> adrenals. The mean percent methylation of H19 CpGs peaked at sites 9 and 10 in normal, hyperplasia, <b>adenoma</b> and carcinoma adrenals and the lowest mean percent methylation of H19 CpGs dipped at site 7 in normal, hyperplasia, <b>adenoma</b> and carcinoma adrenals.|$|E
25|$|It is {{interesting}} to note that the mean percent methylation of H19 CpGs at sites 13 and 14, after the transcription start site, is insignificant between normal, hyperplasia, <b>adenoma</b> and carcinoma adrenals. This is because methylation of CpGs after the transcription start site is assumed to interfere with RNA polymerase II during transcription. Another point of interest is the significant difference in CpG methylation at site 11 between normal and hyperplasia adrenals. The mean percent CpG methylation at site 11 for hyperplasia and <b>adenoma</b> adrenals is significantly different from that of normal adrenals and carcinoma adrenals, leading Gao et al. to suggest that site 11 is the initial methylated CpG that eventually leads to widespread methylation of the H19 promoter.|$|E
