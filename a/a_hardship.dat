5|$|Due to Fort Corcoran's {{large size}} and {{proximity}} to Georgetown, duty {{as part of}} the fort's garrison was less of <b>a</b> <b>hardship</b> than it was at many of the more isolated forts in the defenses of Washington, such as Fort Greble. Morale and sanitation officers often visited Fort Corcoran, and leave to visit Georgetown or Washington was sometimes granted to both officers and enlisted men. Men at the fort served in regimental bands or played baseball in their spare time between periods of infantry and gunnery drill. Due to Fort Corcoran's location behind the Arlington Line, however, drill was not as intense as at many front-line fort.|$|E
5|$|Romney {{supported}} raising various fees, {{including those}} for drivers' licenses and gun licenses, {{to raise more}} than $300million. He increased a special gasoline retailer fee by two cents per gallon, generating about $60million per year in additional revenue. Opponents said the reliance on fees sometimes imposed <b>a</b> <b>hardship</b> on those who could least afford them. Romney also closed tax loopholes that brought in another $181million from businesses {{over the next two}} years and over $300million for his term. He did so in the face of conservative and corporate critics who viewed these actions as tax increases.|$|E
5|$|While in {{law school}} in the late 1960s, an era of {{escalation}} in the Vietnam War, Burke received a draft deferment as a full-time student. After his marriage {{and the death of}} his father, he applied for and was granted <b>a</b> <b>hardship</b> deferment (3-A), as the sole support of his wife, mother, and two younger brothers. In June 1969, the Illinois Selective Service board of appeals reclassified him 1-A ("available for unrestricted military service"). At the same time, he was accepted into a Chicago-based United States Army Reserve unit, the 363rd civil affairs group, as a private. Political rivals expressed concern that special consideration allowed Burke to join the Reserve unit ahead of others, but an Army investigation found no evidence of manipulation in his favor.|$|E
40|$|Using {{data from}} the 2004 panel of the Survey of Income and Program Participation (SIPP), this study {{examined}} relationships between employment problems and four types of material hardship among single-mother families. Although <b>a</b> bill-paying <b>hardship</b> {{was the most common}} hardship reported by the mothers (41 %), 38 % of the families experienced <b>a</b> health <b>hardship,</b> 33 % suffered <b>a</b> food <b>hardship,</b> and 25 % had <b>a</b> housing <b>hardship.</b> The multivariate results indicate that compared with families whose mothers were adequately employed, families whose mothers were unemployed/had involuntary job gaps and were underemployed had heightened risks of experiencing bill-paying, health, and housing hardships. Only unemployment/involuntary job gaps was related to having <b>a</b> food <b>hardship.</b> <b>A</b> number of other factors associated with experiencing material hardship also were identified. Finally, implications for social work practice and social policy are discussed. Unemployment Underemployment Material hardship Single-mother families...|$|R

5|$|Russia possessed thirty-six cavalry {{divisions}} when {{it entered}} {{the war in}} 1914, and the Russian government claimed that its horsemen would thrust deep {{into the heart of}} Germany. Although Russian mounted troops entered Germany, they were soon met by German forces. In the August 1914 Battle of Tannenberg, troops led by German Field Marshal Paul von Hindenburg and Lieutenant-General Erich Ludendorff surrounded the Russian Second Army and destroyed the mounted force of Don Cossacks that served as the special guard of Russian General Alexander Samsonov. Other Russian cavalry units successfully harassed retreating Austro-Hungarian troops in September 1914, with the running battle eventually resulting in the loss of 40,000 of the 50,000men in the Austro-Hungarian XIV Tyrolean Corps, which included the 6th Mounted Rifle Regiment. Transporting cavalry created <b>a</b> <b>hardship</b> for the already strained Russian infrastructure, as the great distances they needed to be moved meant that they had to be transported by train. Approximately the same number of trains (about 40) were required to transport a cavalry division of 4,000 as to transport an infantry division of 16,000.|$|E

25|$|The skyrocketing {{inflation}} was <b>a</b> <b>hardship</b> on {{the few people}} who had fixed incomes—but 90 percent of the people were farmers, and were not directly affected by that inflation.

Ricefield rats are also consumed in the Philippines, the Isaan region of Thailand, and Cambodia. In late 2008, Reuters reported the price of rat meat had quadrupled in Cambodia, creating <b>a</b> <b>hardship</b> for the poor who could no longer afford it.|$|E
25|$|The bill {{may also}} be reduced by having one or more reliefs applied to it, such as reliefs for empty properties, or for charities.

While some are mandatory, others are at the discretion of the local authority, who also have to bear, in whole or in part, the costs of some reliefs. In addition to specific reliefs, <b>a</b> <b>hardship</b> relief is available at the discretion of the local authority.

25|$|The {{weather was}} not in itself <b>a</b> <b>hardship</b> for those {{accustomed}} to long winters. The real problem lay in the weather's effect on crops and thus on the supply of food and firewood. At higher elevations, where farming was problematic in good years, the cooler climate did not quite support agriculture. In May 1816, frost killed off most crops in the higher elevations of Massachusetts, New Hampshire, and Vermont, as well as upstate New York. On June 6, snow fell in Albany, New York, and Dennysville, Maine. In Cape May, New Jersey, frost was reported five {{nights in a row}} in late June, causing extensive crop damage.|$|E

He later enlisted in the United States Army, getting <b>a</b> <b>hardship</b> discharge after his father abandoned his mother. Nixon did not tell his lawyers any of this, and they had to discover it through their own private investigations.|$|E
25|$|This {{strike was}} carried on by sampan-men of all ethnicities. The sampan-men had earlier on been fined heavily for insisting that {{passengers}} {{pay more than}} the two cents per passenger each way to and from steamers within the inner harbour and four cents to vessels in the outer harbour set down in the Harbour Rules for Sampans. While some viewed this as extortion there were cases mentioned where passengers gave more than the rules called for, of their own accord. The case where a passenger gave 30 cents and the sampan-man was fined $20 {{is said to have}} led to the leaders of the sampan-men initiating the strike. The sampan-men found the prohibition on repairing their boats along Weld Quay <b>a</b> <b>hardship</b> and the fares dictated by the Harbour Rules inadequate. The prohibition, apparently came about because of complaints from tongkang-men who were unable to get near to Weld Quay, being obstructed by sampans laid up for repair. The strike was said to have involved 150 sampans.|$|E
25|$|Fasting {{is seen as}} {{purification}} and the regaining of innocence. It is {{a practice}} of learning to temper the body's primary desire for food. By learning to temper this basic desire of the body, the practitioner can more readily temper other worldly desires, and thus, become better enabled to draw closer to God {{in the hope of}} becoming more Christ-like. Through obedience to the Church and its ascetic practices the Orthodox Christian seeks to rid himself or herself of the passions (The desires of our fallen carnal nature). All Orthodox Christians are provided with a prescribed set of guidelines. They do not view fasting as <b>a</b> <b>hardship,</b> but rather as a privilege and joy. The teaching of the Church provides both the time and the amount of fasting that is expected as a minimum for every member who chooses to participate. For greater ascesis, some may choose to go without food entirely {{for a short period of}} time. A complete three-day fast at the beginning and end of a fasting period is not unusual, and some fast for even longer periods, though this is usually practiced only in monasteries.|$|E
