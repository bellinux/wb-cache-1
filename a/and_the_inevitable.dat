5|$|The {{outbreak}} of World War I {{was to have}} a tragic effect on Durkheim's life. His leftism was always patriotic rather than internationalist—he sought a secular, rational form of French life. But the coming of the war <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>inevitable</b> nationalist propaganda that followed made it difficult to sustain this already nuanced position. While Durkheim actively worked to support his country in the war, his reluctance to give in to simplistic nationalist fervor (combined with his Jewish background) made him a natural target of the now-ascendant French Right. Even more seriously, the generations of students that Durkheim had trained were now being drafted to serve in the army, and many of them perished in the trenches. Finally, Durkheim's own son, André, died on the war front in December 1915—a loss from which Durkheim never recovered. Emotionally devastated, Durkheim collapsed of a stroke in Paris on November 15, 1917. He was buried at the Montparnasse Cemetery in Paris.|$|E

Surfing, instead, becomes their lifestyle.|$|E
25|$|After {{a bitter}} {{campaign}} {{during which he}} spent between $5,000 and $6,000, Macpherson managed to unseat the incumbent by a bare 200 votes. The Republican Macpherson's election {{had the effect of}} splitting the 30-member State Senate exactly down the middle in terms of party representation, 15-15. A two-week fight for the position of Senate President — <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>inevitable</b> repercussions it would have over committee assignments — ensued before Republicans finally acquiesced to the election of Condon Democrat John Burns and a split of committee chairs. The election of Burns was not the result of negotiated compromise, however, but rather {{was the result of a}} deal made behind the scenes in which Burns crossed party lines to vote for himself without consultation with the Democratic caucus. The situation was tense and bitter.|$|E

25|$|The {{beginning}} of the end for the charity haunts can be traced to a singular event: the Haunted Castle (Six Flags Great Adventure) caught fire on the evening of May 11, 1984, in Jackson Township, New Jersey. Eight teenagers lost their lives in the fire. There were criminal charges filed, civil lawsuits, numerous investigations, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>inevitable</b> result that fire safety laws, building codes, and inspections were tightened up considerably nationwide. The net effect was to make charity attractions less economically viable than they were before. Better construction materials were required, and fire safety equipment was required, making a temporary venue too expensive for many charities to afford. As a result, the larger, better funded for-profit operators moved in as the charities moved out. The fire caused wide-ranging changes for all amusement buildings. Previously, operators were able to avoid fire codes because such attractions were used temporarily. The Haunted Castle fire pointed to an unattractive reality that forced tighter regulation.|$|E
25|$|After the Great war <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>inevitable</b> defence {{cuts that}} would follow, {{the army was}} reduced in size, and by 1920 had fallen to a {{strength}} of 370,000. There {{were a number of}} factors for the reductions in the size of British Army, and the cuts to the budget of the Army. The army now had competition from the new armed service, the Royal Air Force, which could patrol far greater land areas, and keep the far flung corners of the Empire policed from the sky at a relatively cheaper cost. The defence budget for the army was repeatedly cut yearly, as in 1923 the army defence budget was 43.5million pounds sterling, and during the Great Depression in 1932 to just under 36million pounds sterling. Only with the rise of Germany, would the budget for the British army again increase, by 1938 to 123million pounds sterling; the army again started a rapid recruitment program.|$|E
25|$|Firstly, Buchloh draws {{attention}} to Beuys's fictionalisation of his own biography, which he sees as symptomatic of a dangerous cultural tendency of disavowing a traumatic past and retreating into the realms of myth and esoteric symbolism. Buchloh attacks Beuys for his failure to acknowledge and engage with Nazism, the Holocaust, and their implications. Secondly, Buchloh criticizes Beuys for displaying an inability or reluctance to engage {{with the consequences of}} the work of Marcel Duchamp. That is, a failure to acknowledge the framing function of the art institution <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>inevitable</b> dependence upon such institutions to create meaning for art objects. If Beuys championed art's power to foster political transformation, he nevertheless failed to acknowledge the limits imposed upon such aspirations by the art museum and dealership networks that served somewhat less utopian ambitions. For Buchloh, rather than acknowledging the collective and contextual formation of meaning, Beuys instead attempted to prescribe and control the meanings of his art, and often in the form of dubious esoteric or symbolic codings. Buchloh's critique has been developed by a number of commentators such as Stefan Germer and Rosalind Krauss.|$|E

500|$|Leech {{released}} the new designs {{to the press}} about November 10, 1891. According to numismatist David Lange, the new coinage received mixed reviews: [...] "while the general press and public seemed satisfied with the new dime, quarter dollar, and half dollar, numismatists were either mildly disappointed with the new coins or remained silent on the matter." [...] Moran records a number of unfavorable reviews, without listing any favorable ones. Vermeule stated that [...] "the initial comment on the new coinage concerned the novelty of a contest, its failure, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>inevitable</b> result that the commission would go, as always, to the Chief Engraver [...] and his staff." ...|$|E
500|$|When {{asked about}} the magical aspects of Salem, {{she said that the}} series was based on [...] "all natural magic," [...] and {{identified}} her character as a [...] "psychological murderer as well as a practical murderer". Defining the show as using [...] "urder in the parlor" [...] and [...] "omen fighting to the death in [...] very elevated way," [...] Lawless emphasized that it treated magic differently than the Harry Potter franchise, commenting that there is [...] "othing cute going on". She said that Ingrid's story arc was partially based on the character's obsession and rivalry with Mary <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>inevitable</b> vendetta to destroy her. Bustle's Kelsea Stahler identified Ingrid as Mary's foil, emphasizing the ability of Lawless' character to charm and appeal to the city of Salem and its inhabitants.|$|E

[...] DVD Movie Guide's Colin Jacobson enjoyed the episode and said that it [...] "offers the kind of episode that only The Simpsons could pull off well. The idea of bringing a president to live in Springfield is high-concept to say the least, and it could– and probably should– have bombed. However, the silliness works well and turns this into a great show." [...] John Thorpe of Central Michigan Life named it the second best episode of the series, and Rich Weir of AskMen.com named it the ninth best episode.|$|E

500|$|The {{process of}} {{transplanting}} music between cultures {{is not without}} criticism. The folk revival of the mid-20th century, for example, appropriated the musics of various rural peoples, in part to promote certain political causes, which has caused some to question whether the process caused the [...] "commercial commodification of other peoples' songs ... <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>inevitable</b> dilution of mean" [...] in the appropriated musics. The issue of cultural appropriation {{has also been a}} major part of racial relations in the United States. The use of African American musical techniques, images, and conceits in popular music largely by and for white Americans has been widespread since at least the mid-19th century songs of Stephen Foster and the rise of minstrel shows. The American music industry has actively attempted to popularize white performers of African American music because they are more palatable to mainstream and middle-class Americans. This process has been related to the rise of stars as varied as Benny Goodman, Eminem, and Elvis Presley, as well as popular styles like blue-eyed soul and rockabilly.|$|E
500|$|In {{the late}} 1970s the Reverend Jerry Falwell moved from {{presiding}} over the megachurch Thomas Road Baptist Church in Lynchburg, Virginia and hosting the Old Time Gospel Hour, to being involved in politics. Falwell took credit for defeating the Dade County gay rights ordinance {{and the failure of}} the ERA in Florida. He developed a campaign called Clean Up America in 1977 that was a fundraising vehicle for his television show. Falwell sent letters asking for donations, which included questionnaires asking [...] "Do you approve of known practicing homosexuals teaching in public schools?" [...] that he promised would be sent to politicians; he distributed information about how to put together political groups to influence elections and lawmakers. In 1979 Falwell spearheaded a coalition of religious groups that included Catholics, fundamentalist Protestants, Mormons, and Orthodox Jews that he called the Moral Majority, which developed a branch dedicated to political action. Falwell declared in 1965 that he had no business in politics, but justified his involvement <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>inevitable</b> mix of religion and government with evidence that the social problems of abortion, pornography, sexual immorality, and drugs were bringing the United States to a dangerous precipice where communism would prevail over Christianity.|$|E
500|$|Hurricane Andrew struck Miami in 1992, with catastrophic {{damage to}} Homestead Air Force Base in Homestead. A plan to {{rejuvenate}} {{the property in}} 1993 and convert it into a commercial airport was met with enthusiasm from local municipal and commercial entities hoping to recoup $480million and 11,000jobs lost in the local community by the destruction and subsequent closing of the base. On March 31, 1994, the base was designated as a reserve base, functioning only part-time. A cursory environmental study performed by the Air Force was deemed insufficient by local conservation groups, who threatened to sue in order to halt the acquisition when estimates of 650flights a day were projected. Groups had previously been alarmed in 1990 by the inclusion of Homestead Air Force Base {{on a list of}} the U.S. Government's most polluted properties. Their concerns also included noise, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>inevitable</b> collisions with birds using the mangrove forests as rookeries. The Air Force base is located between Everglades National Park and Biscayne National Park, giving it the potential to cause harm to both. In 2000, Secretary of the Interior Bruce Babbitt {{and the director of the}} U.S. Environmental Protection Agency expressed their opposition to the project, despite other Clinton Administration agencies previously working to ensure the base would be turned over to local agencies quickly and smoothly as [...] "a model of base disposal".|$|E

500|$|However, Milk's {{assassination}} {{has become}} entwined with his political efficacy, {{partly because he}} was killed at the zenith of his popularity. Historian Neil Miller writes, [...] "No contemporary American gay leader has yet to achieve in life the stature Milk found in death." [...] His legacy has become ambiguous; Randy Shilts concludes his biography writing that Milk's success, murder, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>inevitable</b> injustice of White's verdict represented the experience of all gays. Milk's life was [...] "a metaphor for the homosexual experience in America". According to Frances FitzGerald, Milk's legend {{has been unable to}} be sustained as no one appeared able to take his place in the years after his death: [...] "The Castro saw him as a martyr but understood his martyrdom as an end rather than a beginning. He had died, and with him {{a great deal of the}} Castro's optimism, idealism, and ambition seemed to die as well. The Castro could find no one to take his place in its affections, and possibly wanted no one." [...] On the 20th anniversary of Milk's death, historian John D'Emilio said, [...] "The legacy that I think he would want to be remembered for is the imperative to live one's life at all times with integrity." [...] For a political career so short, Cleve Jones attributes more to his assassination than his life: [...] "His murder and the response to it made permanent and unquestionable the full participation of gay and lesbian people in the political process." ...|$|E
