40|$|AbstractThe primary {{principle}} of accounting {{is true and}} fair view of all the facts subject to the accounting. The fair presentation is ensured through the compliance with the {{principle of}} prudence. This principle means that, at the balance sheet day the entity takes into account the expected risks and losses related to assets and liabilities; and that are known at the balance sheet date. The expected risks and losses are reflected in the accounting through provisions and <b>adjusting</b> <b>entries.</b> The <b>adjusting</b> <b>entries</b> are created when the transitional impairment of assets takes place. The paper deals with the issue of creation of <b>adjusting</b> <b>entries</b> for receivables in the Slovak enterprises in terms of taxation and accounting. The <b>adjusting</b> <b>entries</b> for receivables must be created if {{it is reasonable to assume}} that the debtor is unable to pay the full amount or part of it. We will analyse and examine the importance of <b>adjusting</b> <b>entries,</b> difficulties in creating <b>adjusting</b> <b>entries</b> for receivables and their impact on economic performance of selected companies. In the research part of the paper will be used appropriate mathematical and statistical methods and based on the results of the research evaluation conclusions and suggestions will be drawn...|$|R
50|$|In {{accounting}}/accountancy, <b>adjusting</b> <b>entries</b> are {{journal entries}} usually {{made at the}} end of an accounting period to allocate income and expenditure to the period in which they actually occurred. The revenue recognition principle is the basis of making <b>adjusting</b> <b>entries</b> that pertain to unearned and accrued revenues under accrual-basis accounting. They are sometimes called Balance Day adjustments because they are made on balance day.|$|R

50|$|Prepaid expenses, such as {{employee}} wages or subcontractor fees paid out or promised, are not recognized as expenses; {{they are considered}} assets because they will provide probable future benefits. As a prepaid expense is used, an <b>adjusting</b> <b>entry</b> is made to update {{the value of the}} asset. In the case of prepaid rent, for instance, the cost of rent for the period would be deducted from the Prepaid Rent account.|$|E

50|$|Deferrals are the {{consequence}} of the revenue recognition principle which dictates that revenues be recognized in {{the period in which}} they occur, and the matching principle which dictates expenses to be recognized in the period in which they are incurred. Deferrals are the result of cash flows occurring before they are allowed to be recognized under accrual accounting. As a result, <b>adjusting</b> <b>entries</b> are required to reconcile a flow of cash (or rarely other non-cash items) with events that have not occurred yet as either liabilities or assets. Because of the similarity between deferrals and their corresponding accruals, they are commonly conflated.|$|R

50|$|Because of the {{matching}} principle of accounting, revenues and expenses should be {{recorded in the}} period in which they are incurred. When a sale is made on account, revenue is recorded along with account receivable. Because there is an inherent risk that clients might default on payment, accounts receivable have to be recorded at net realizable value. The portion of the account receivable that is estimated to be not collectible is set aside in a contra-asset account called Allowance for doubtful accounts. At the end of each accounting cycle, <b>adjusting</b> <b>entries</b> are made to charge uncollectible receivable as expense. The actual amount of uncollectible receivable is written off as an expense from Allowance for doubtful accounts.|$|R

While it is difficult to assess the usefulness of their conclusion due to problematic assumptions inherent in the research design, Gunny et al. (2013) reinforce the importance of assessing earnings performance using rolling annual windows. Specifically, they find that the quality of earnings for the alternative annual earnings is greater than that of fiscal-year earnings, highlighting that financial statement users may benefit from using alternative annual earnings to assess current and future performance...|$|R
40|$|The {{subject of}} this {{bachelor}} thesis is a credit risk, which I try to define, {{as well as some}} other risks, that are threatening the banking institutions. I also address its management during the process of extending credit by a bank. This procedure has several important phases, which include evaluation of creditworthiness of a client. It depends on a character of the client and the type of the provided credit. The bank evaluates specific characteristics and information, which can be acquired from example from one of the four Credit Bureaus operating in the Czech republic. Important part of the management is formed by creating <b>adjusting</b> <b>entries,</b> that are used for covering of incidental losses in the case of client's failure. This process is partially influenced by the Czech National Bank, in the role of regulator and supervising authority. The last big changes on the part of CNB were made by accepting the Basel II concept, which revises for example measuring of the credit risk. Even if all the prescribed requisities are followed, the approach of every bank is different. As an illustration I show the processes of Ceska sporitelna...|$|R

A five part test was given to students of Accounting Informations Systems of a Bachelor of Commerce degree.

The results of the before and after tests in specific accounting concepts differed. There was a significant improvement in their overall performance in an accounting concepts test and particularly in their understanding of internal controls.

The main objectives {{of this study were}} to (i) evaluate various methods for association mapping in the autogamous species wheat using an empirical data set, (ii) determine a marker-based kinship matrix using a restricted maximum-likelihood (REML) estimate of the probability of two alleles at the same locus being identical in state but not identical by descent, and (iii) compare the results of association-mapping approaches based on <b>adjusted</b> <b>entry</b> means (two-step approaches) with the results of approaches in which the phenotypic data analysis and the association analysis were performed in one step (one-step approaches). On the basis of the phenotypic and genotypic data of 303 soft winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) inbreds, various association-mapping methods were evaluated. Spearman's rank correlation between P-values calculated on the basis of one- and two-stage association-mapping methods ranged from 0. 63 to 0. 93. The mixed-model association-mapping approaches using a kinship matrix estimated by REML are more appropriate for association mapping than the recently proposed QK method with respect to (i) the adherence to the nominal α-level and (ii) the adjusted power for detection of quantitative trait loci. Furthermore, we showed that our data set could be analyzed by using two-step approaches of the proposed association-mapping method without substantially increasing the empirical type I error rate in comparison to the corresponding one-step approaches...|$|R

40|$|Arabidopsis thaliana {{has emerged}} as a leading model species in plant {{genetics}} and functional genomics including research on the genetic causes of heterosis. We applied a triple testcross (TTC) design and a novel biometrical approach to identify and characterize quantitative trait loci (QTL) for heterosis of five biomass-related traits by (i) estimating the number, genomic positions, and genetic effects of heterotic QTL, (ii) characterizing their mode of gene action, and (iii) testing for presence of epistatic effects by a genomewide scan and marker × marker interactions. In total, 234 recombinant inbred lines (RILs) of Arabidopsis hybrid C 24 × Col- 0 were crossed to both parental lines and their F 1 and analyzed with 110 single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers. QTL analyses were conducted using linear transformations Z 1, Z 2, and Z 3 calculated from the <b>adjusted</b> <b>entry</b> means of TTC progenies. With Z 1, we detected 12 QTL displaying augmented additive effects. With Z 2, we mapped six QTL for augmented dominance effects. A one-dimensional genome scan with Z 3 revealed two genomic regions with significantly negative dominance × additive epistatic effects. Two-way analyses of variance between marker pairs revealed nine digenic epistatic interactions: six reflecting dominance × dominance effects with variable sign and three reflecting additive × additive effects with positive sign. We conclude that heterosis for biomass-related traits in Arabidopsis has a polygenic basis with overdominance and/or epistasis being presumably the main types of gene action...|$|R
