5|$|A further {{example of}} an {{executive}} decision invalidated by improper purpose {{can be seen from}} Congreve v. Home Office (1976).

The court held that this was an improper exercise of the Home Secretary's discretionary powers. His power to revoke could not be used to raise revenue, and therefore this power had been used for the wrong purpose.|$|E
5|$|A {{laboratory}} {{study examined the}} effects on the Antarctic scallop {{of an increase in}} lead, copper and mercury content in the water. It was found that <b>a</b> <b>rise</b> in levels of heavy metals led to quite severe morphological changes in the scallop and a reduction in lysosomal membrane stability. Another experiment involved transplanting scallops from a clean water area to a bay where effluent from an Antarctic base was released. It was found that the scallops were relatively unaffected by the outflows and this resulted in the belief that benthic marine communities were unlikely to be severely affected by such discharges.|$|E
40|$|The {{bargaining}} for a {{new role}} in world politics presents <b>a</b> <b>rising</b> power with <b>a</b> strategic dilemma, as the new role entails a new power position {{in the system and}} a new social status in international society. China’s assertiveness in diplomacy after 2008 {{can be seen as a}} ‘role bargaining’ process between China and the outside world, such as China’s bargaining {{for a new}} role in the global financial system through the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB). This article aims to examine how <b>a</b> <b>rising</b> power can bargain for the new role in a peaceful way. Based on rational bargaining theory and on role theory, we suggest four strategies whereby <b>a</b> <b>rising</b> power bargains for a new role: costly signalling, self-restraint, role-diversification, and alter-casting. Through focusing on China’s World Trade Organization accession and integration into the global economy after the Cold War, we examine the utilities and limitations of these four role-bargaining strategies for <b>a</b> <b>rising</b> power in the international system. The first two strategies aim to address the information and commitment problems concomitant with rationalism that <b>a</b> <b>rising</b> power faces in negotiating a new power position, and the last two strategies focus on how <b>a</b> <b>rising</b> power can bargain for a new social role by balancing the self’s role conception and the role expectations of others.

5|$|Another reason exports {{cannot be}} {{promoted}} is because in all likelihood, an underdeveloped country {{may only be}} skilled enough to promote the export of primary goods, say agricultural goods. However, since such commodities face inelastic demand, {{the extent to which}} they will sell in the market is limited. Although when population is at <b>a</b> <b>rise,</b> additional demand for exports may be created, Nurkse implicitly assumed that developed countries are operating at the replacement rate of population growth. For Nurkse, then, exports as a means of economic development are completely ruled out.|$|E
5000|$|It is {{possible}} for <b>a</b> <b>rising</b> fastball to be thrown by a submarine pitcher because of the technique with which they throw the ball.
