40|$|A tuned {{mass damper}} (TMD) system {{consists}} of an added mass with properly functioning spring and damping elements for providing frequency-dependent damping in a primary structure. The advantage of a friction-type TMD, that is, a nonlinear TMD, is its energy dissipation via a frictionmechanism. In contrast, the disadvantages of a passive friction TMD (PF-TMD) are its fixed and predetermined slip load and loss of tuning and energy dissipation capabilities when {{it is in a}} stick state. A semi-active friction TMD (SAF-TMD) is used to overcome these disadvantages. The SAF-TMD can adjust its slip force in response to structure motion. To verify its feasibility, a prototype SAF-TMD was fabricated and tested dynamically using a shaking table test. <b>A</b> <b>nonsticking</b> friction control law was used to keep the SAF-TMD activated and in a slip state in earthquakes at varying intensities. The shaking table test results demonstrated that: (i) the experimental results are consistent with the theoretical results; (ii) the SAF-TMD is more effective than the PF-TMD given a similar peak TMD stroke; and (iii) the SAF-TMD can also prevent a residual TMD stroke in a PF-TMD system...|$|R
2500|$|However, Tefal was not {{the only}} company to utilize PTFE in nonstick {{cookware}} coatings. In subsequent years, many cookware manufacturers developed proprietary PTFE-based formulas, including Swiss Diamond International, which uses a diamond-reinforced PTFE formula; Scanpan, which uses a titanium-reinforced PTFE formula; [...] and both All-Clad and Newell Rubbermaid's Calphalon, which use <b>a</b> non-reinforced PTFE-based <b>nonstick.</b> Other cookware companies, such as Meyer Corporation's Anolon, use Teflon nonstick coatings purchased from DuPont.|$|R

50|$|Kalari {{is often}} served hot and salted with tomatoes, onions, bread and cabbage. In recent {{improvisation}} {{it is made}} like a burger with Kalari as the patty in layers of coleslaw like salad, tomatoes, etc. filled up in a bun. The complete ensemble is shallow fried. Earlier Kalari was served on its own without any breads. Later Kalari sandwich came into existence that consisted of Kalari placed in two slices of bakery bread with complete sandwich shallow fried in the pan containing left over fat from frying the kalari. Some tamarind chutney with red chilli powder and salt are also added. Sometimes it is also prepared by first wetting it and covering it in a dry mixture of whole wheat flour (atta), red chilli powder and salt then sautéing over <b>a</b> <b>nonstick</b> pan. In Jammu people also make a curry with it called कलाड़ी की सबज़ी in the local language. Pakodas are also prepared with kalari.|$|E
40|$|International audienceVibrating systems {{excited by}} dry {{friction}} are frequently encountered in technical applications. These systems are strongly nonlinear, {{and they are}} usually modeled as spring-mass oscillators. One {{of the most popular}} models of stick-slip oscillators consists of several masses connected by linear springs; one (or more) of the masses is in contact with a driving belt moving at a constant velocity. In the past, several authors investigated the behavior of this system, with different friction laws and with or without external actions and damping. In this work, we consider a system composed of two masses connected by linear springs. One of the mass is in contact with a driving belt moving at a constant velocity. Friction force, with Coulomb’s characteristics, acts between the mass and the belt. Moreover, it is assumed that the mass is also subjected to a harmonic external force. Several periodic orbits including stick phases and slip phases are obtained in closed form. In particular, the existence of periodic orbits including an overshooting part is proved. In the case of a nonmoving belt, <b>a</b> set of <b>nonsticking</b> periodic solutions is obtained, and we prove that these orbits are symmetrical in space and in time...|$|R

40|$|Single {{molecule}} {{analysis of}} individual enzymes can require oriented immobilization {{of the subject}} molecules on a detection surface. As part of a technology development project for single molecule DNA sequencing, we faced the multiple challenges of immobilizing both a DNA polymerase and its DNA template together in an active, stable complex capable of highly processive DNA synthesis on <b>a</b> <b>nonstick</b> surface. Here, we report the genetic modification of the archaeal DNA polymerase 9 °N in which two biotinylated peptide ‘legs’ are inserted at positions flanking the DNA-binding cleft. Streptavidin binding {{on either side of}} the cleft both traps the DNA template in the polymerase and orients the complex on a biotinylated surface. We present evidence that purified polymerase–DNA–streptavidin complexes are active both in solution and immobilized on a surface. Processivity is improved from < 20 nt in the unmodified polymerase to several thousand nucleotides in the engineered complexes. High-molecular weight DNA synthesized by immobilized complexes is observed moving above the surface even as it remains tethered to the polymerase. Pre-formed polymerase–DNA–streptavidin complexes can be stored frozen and subsequently thawed without dissociation or loss of activity, making them convenient for use in single molecule analysis...|$|E
40|$|Synthesis and {{incorporation}} of functionalized materials continues to generate significant research interest in academia and in industry. If chosen correctly, a functional group when {{incorporated into a}} polymer can deliver enhanced properties, such as adhesion, water solubility, thermal stability, etc. The utility of these new materials has been demonstrated in drug-delivery systems, coatings, membranes and compatibilizers. Two approaches exist to functionalize a material. The desired moiety {{can be added to}} the monomer either before or after polymerization. The polymers used range from low glass transition temperature elastomers to high glass transition temperature, high performance materials. One industrial example of the first approach is the synthesis of Teflon(reg. sign). Poly(tetrafluoroethylene) (PTFE or Teflon(reg. sign)) is synthesized from tetrafluoroethylene, a functionalized monomer. The resulting material has significant property differences from the parent, poly(ethylene). Due to the fluorine in the polymer, PTFE has excellent solvent and heat resistance, a low surface energy and a low coefficient of friction. This allows the material to be used in high temperature applications where the surface needs to be nonabrasive and nonstick. This material has a wide spread use in the cooking industry because it allows for ease of cooking and cleaning as <b>a</b> <b>nonstick</b> coating on cookware. One of the best examples of the second approach, functionalization after polymerization, is the vulcanization process used to make tires. Natural rubber (from the Hevea brasiliensis) has a very low glass transition temperature, is very tacky and would not be useful to make tires without synthetic alteration. Goodyear's invention was the vulcanization of polyisoprene by crosslinking the material with sulfur to create a rubber that was tough enough to withstand the elements of weather and road conditions. Due to the development of polymerization techniques to make cis-polyisoprene, natural rubber is no longer needed for the manufacturing of tires, but vulcanization is still utilized...|$|E
