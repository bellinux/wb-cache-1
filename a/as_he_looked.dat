5|$|In February 2016, Burge {{signed with}} National League South club Sutton United on a {{contract}} running until summer 2017. He contributed three goals in five games as the U's won promotion into the National League as champions of the Southern Division in 2015–16. He was forced to miss {{the rest of the}} season after his ankle ligaments were damaged from a heavy challenge he received during a 2–0 win at Wealdstone on 22 March. Burge made his National League debut in a 1–1 draw with Forest Green Rovers at The New Lawn on 9 August. On 9 December 2016, Burge was released by Sutton United <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>looked</b> to continue his career nearer to his Cheltenham home.|$|E
5|$|Regehr {{joined the}} Canadian junior {{team for the}} 1999 World Junior Ice Hockey Championships, playing all seven games for the silver medal winning Canadians. He made his first {{appearance}} with the senior team following his rookie season in the NHL, playing six games in the 2000 Men's World Ice Hockey Championships. His emergence in the 2004 Stanley Cup playoffs earned him consideration for Canada's entry at the 2004 World Cup of Hockey. He {{was named to the}} team by executive director Wayne Gretzky <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>looked</b> to bring a younger team to this tournament than played at the 2002 Winter Olympics. The decision worked, as Regehr and the Canadians won the championship.|$|E
5|$|When the Civil War {{broke out}} in 1861, Confederate Secretary of the Navy Stephen R. Mallory was an early enthusiast for the {{advantages}} of armor. <b>As</b> <b>he</b> <b>looked</b> upon it, the Confederacy could not match the industrial North in numbers of ships at sea, so {{they would have to}} compete by building vessels that individually outclassed those of the Union. Armor would provide the edge. Mallory gathered about himself a group of men who could put his vision into practice, among them John M. Brooke, John L. Porter, and William P. Williamson.|$|E

5|$|Judy {{also pointed}} out the {{approach}} of hostile Japanese aircraft long before any of the human crew could hear them. This first occurred prior to the outbreak of war, when the aircraft would fly low over the Gnat with Judy barking at them until they had passed. On an outing to Jiujiang, Jefferey took Judy for a walk outside of the city but she ran ahead, pulling him with her. He realised <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>looked</b> back {{that she had been}} pulling him away from a Leopard. In November 1937, the Gnat met with the American river gunboat USS Panay. After the Panay held a party for the two ship's companies, the Gnat crew departed and only realised afterwards that Judy was not with them. They contacted the Panay via signal lamp, but they insisted that they had not seen her. The following morning, the crew heard from a Chinese trader that Judy was on board the Panay after all. In retaliation, a party boarded the American vessel and stole the ship's bell. Afterwards they contacted the Panay and offered them the bell back in return for Judy. She was returned within the hour.|$|E

25|$|The writer's life allowed Maugham {{to travel}} and to live {{in places such as}} Spain and Capri for the next decade, but his next ten works never came close to rivalling the success of Liza. This changed in 1907 with the success of his play Lady Frederick. By the next year, he had four plays running {{simultaneously}} in London, and Punch published a cartoon of Shakespeare biting his fingernails nervously <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>looked</b> at the billboards.|$|E
25|$|These two battalions, thus posted, {{caught the}} eye of Blücher <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>looked</b> round for the nearest {{available}} force, and he immediately ordered them to advance, and join in the contest; and General Brause, on being made acquainted with this disposition, led forward the 3rd Battalions of the 14th and 22nd Regiments, and the 1st Battalion of the 2nd Elbe Landwehr, while the four remaining battalions of his brigade, making a change of front to their left, formed up, in reserve, in rear of the Namur road.

In this manner, he {{may or may not}} have been applying a foreign substance to the ball on any particular pitch. Reggie Jackson was so upset after striking out against Perry one time that Jackson was ejected from the game. Jackson returned from the dugout with a container of Gatorade, splashing Gatorade onto the field while yelling at the umpire that Perry should be allowed to use the Gatorade on the baseball.|$|E

25|$|In response, New Zealand {{came within}} nine runs {{at the end}} of the first days play as they {{finished}} on 134/3. Craig Cumming, whose spot in the side was under pressure from Jamie How, made 42 before being dismissed leg before wicket for the third innings in a row. At the close of play, Stephen Fleming was unbeaten on 39 <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>looked</b> for his first test century on his home ground. On the second morning, Bangladesh was guilty of dropping four catches in the first 90 minutes before finally dismissing Mathew Sinclair. Fleming was also dropped from a skied shot before being dismissed for 87 off a similar shot. Vettori and Brendon McCullum put together an 81 run partnership at 5.28 runs per over before McCullum was dismissed; Vettori finished as the top scorer with 94. Despite leading by 250 runs after being dismissed for 393 there was some criticism of the ability of the batsmen to carry on to large scores, with five batsmen scoring at least 40 but none being able to break 100.|$|E
25|$|Following Duffey's murder, Nilsen {{began to}} kill with {{increasing}} frequency. Before {{the end of}} 1980, he was to kill a further five victims and attempt to murder one other, although {{only one of these}} victims whom Nilsen murdered, 26-year-old William David Sutherland, has ever been identified. Nilsen's recollections of the unidentified victims are vague, although he graphically recalled how each victim had been murdered and just how long the body had been retained before dissection. One unidentified victim killed in November had moved his legs in a cycling motion as he was strangled (Nilsen is known to have absented himself from work between 11 and 18 November, likely due to this particular murder); another unidentified victim Nilsen had unsuccessfully attempted to resuscitate, before sinking to his knees and sobbing, before standing to expressly spit at his own image <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>looked</b> at himself in the mirror. On another occasion, he had lain in bed alongside the body of an unidentified victim as he listened to the classical theme Fanfare for the Common Man before bursting into tears.|$|E
25|$|Mary {{is alone}} in the stable in Bethlehem with the baby Jesus when she {{receives}} a visitation from an angel. He tells the virgin {{that she has been}} permitted a glimpse of the future and shows Jesus alone and afraid in the Garden of Gethsemane as He prays before his arrest, then a vision of Jesus carrying His cross on the way to His crucifixion, and then finally on the cross as He is declared by the High Priest as a blasphemer. The angel offers Mary the choice of giving the baby back to God to avoid these agonies of the future and tells her that she should regard the choice as hers alone with no compunction from God himself. Mary suddenly remembers the smile on her son's face <b>as</b> <b>He</b> <b>looked</b> on His sleeping disciples in Gethsemane and a similar look on the face of one of the criminals also on a cross at Golgotha. She refuses the offer that the angel makes to her. He vanishes as Joseph comes into the stable. The angel is then revealed to be Satan in disguised form who vows to come back one day and tempt Jesus himself. As he flashes through the sky towards hell, his passage is mistaken for a star by the Three Wise Men.|$|E

500|$|Barbree's {{most recent}} book, [...] "Live from Cape Canaveral: Covering the Space Race, from Sputnik to Today", was {{released}} on August 28, 2007, {{to coincide with the}} 50th anniversary of spaceflight, that began with the Sputnik 1 launch on October 4, 1957. The foreword is written by Tom Brokaw. Barbree's book attempts to illustrate how the media has changed in their coverage of the space programs, from the early enthusiasm to the relative disinterest in the program today. Barbree says he wrote the book because <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>looked</b> back over his career, when recalling all the people he'd worked with, very few were left. Barbree claims that he told himself, [...] "You're {{the only one who has}} covered the whole program going all the way back to the beginning, and if you don't tell the story, who is going to do it?" [...] It received generally poor reviews from space historians.|$|E

500|$|The episode {{starts with}} Liz Lemon (Tina Fey) announcing to her boss, Jack Donaghy (Alec Baldwin), {{that she needs}} to go to Chicago for jury duty because she is still {{registered}} to vote there. Jack gives Liz a powerful sedative for the trip. Later, NBC page Kenneth Parcell (Jack McBrayer) walks in on a meeting between Jack and the American silver medalist in tetherball, Tyler Brody (Remy Auberjonois). Tyler is angry at Jack for not selecting him as the gold medalist, and is threatening to go public with the revelation that there was no Olympic tetherball competition during the 2008 Summer Olympics, as it was staged to boost NBC's ratings. To keep him quiet, Jack tells him that he can [...] "be the voice of Knight Rider" [...] in a film adaptation, which Tyler considers. Afterwards, Kenneth tells Jack that he [...] "lost two heroes today", <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>looked</b> up to both Jack and Tyler. As a result, Jack wants to be in Kenneth's good side, but wants to break his moral absolutism, after Kenneth did not hesitate to attempt to kill himself when he believed the air in a stalled elevator was about to run out. Jack finally succeeds when he supplies Kenneth with a big screen television, but no cable hookup. Kenneth steals cable and later confesses to Jack, asking if SpongeBob SquarePants [...] "is supposed to be terrifying".|$|E
500|$|Jordan and the Bulls {{continued}} their {{dominance in the}} 1991–92 season, establishing a 67–15 record, topping their franchise record from 1990–91. Jordan won his second consecutive MVP award with averages of 30.1 points, 6.4 rebounds and 6.1 assists per game on 52% shooting. After winning a physical 7-game series over the New York Knicks {{in the second round}} of the playoffs and finishing off the Cleveland Cavaliers in the Conference Finals in 6 games, the Bulls met Clyde Drexler and the Portland Trail Blazers in the Finals. The media, hoping to recreate a Magic–Bird rivalry, highlighted the similarities between [...] "Air" [...] Jordan and Clyde [...] "The Glide" [...] during the pre-Finals hype. In the first game, Jordan scored a Finals-record 35 points in the first half, including a record-setting six three-point field goals. After the sixth three-pointer, he jogged down the court shrugging <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>looked</b> courtside. Marv Albert, who broadcast the game, later stated that it was as if Jordan was saying, [...] "I can't believe I'm doing this." [...] The Bulls went on to win Game 1, and defeat the Blazers in six games. Jordan was named Finals MVP for the second year in a row and finished the series averaging 35.8 ppg, 4.8 rpg, and 6.5 apg, while shooting 53% from the floor.|$|E
