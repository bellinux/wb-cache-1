50|$|Distributed {{practice}} (also {{known as}} spaced repetition or spaced practice) is a learning strategy, where practice is broken {{up into a}} number of short sessions - over <b>a</b> longer <b>period</b> <b>of</b> <b>time.</b> Humans and animals learn items in a list more effectively when they are studied in several sessions spread out over <b>a</b> long <b>period</b> <b>of</b> <b>time,</b> rather than studied repeatedly in <b>a</b> short <b>period</b> <b>of</b> <b>time,</b> <b>a</b> phenomenon called the spacing effect. The opposite, massed practice, consists of fewer, longer training sessions. It is generally a less effective method of learning. For example, when studying for an exam dispersing your studying more frequently over <b>a</b> larger <b>period</b> <b>of</b> <b>time</b> will result in more effective learning than intense study the night before.|$|R

5|$|After <b>a</b> <b>period</b> <b>of</b> <b>time</b> {{and under}} the {{appropriate}} environmental conditions, the dikaryotic mycelia may enter the reproductive stage of the life cycle. Fruit body formation is influenced by external factors such as season (which affects temperature and air humidity), nutrients and light. As fruit bodies develop they produce peridioles containing the basidia upon which new basidiospores are made. Young basidia contain a pair of haploid sexually compatible nuclei which fuse, and the resulting diploid fusion nucleus undergoes meiosis to produce basidiospores, each containing a single haploid nucleus. The dikaryotic mycelia from which the fruit bodies are produced is long lasting, {{and will continue to}} produce successive generations of fruit bodies as long as the environmental conditions are favorable.|$|E
