500|$|A poignant novel first {{published}} in 1927, Nirmala's reformist <b>agenda</b> <b>is</b> transparent in its theme which deals {{with the question of}} dowry, and consequently mismatched marriages and related issues. [...] The story uses fiction to highlight an era of much needed social reform in 1920s Indian society. [...] Nirmala was serialized in 1928 in Chand, a women’s magazine in which the novel’s feminist character was represented. Nirmala is somewhat like Godaan (published in 1936) in that it deals with the exploitation of the village poor, and was translated by multiple scholarly translators. It was first translated in 1988 as The Second Wife by David Rubin, and in 1999 as Nirmala by Alok Rai, Premchand's grandson.|$|E
500|$|Lynn Hankinson Nelson {{notes that}} feminist empiricists find {{fundamental}} {{differences between the}} experiences of men and women.

Another part of the feminist research <b>agenda</b> <b>is</b> the uncovering of ways in which power inequities are created or reinforced in society and in scientific and academic institutions. Furthermore, despite calls for greater attention to be paid to structures of gender inequity in the academic literature, structural analyses of gender bias rarely appear in highly cited psychological journals, especially in the commonly studied areas of psychology and personality.|$|E
