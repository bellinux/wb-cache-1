Following the German {{invasion}} of Belgium in August 1914 at the start of World War I, Piron, who had not finished his studies, was mobilised into the Belgian Army as a junior officer in the 2nd Regiment of the Line. He served with the Belgian army on the Yser Front and was promoted to the rank of lieutenant in 1916. After being hospitalised with appendicitis in October 1917, he was transferred to the Belgian Air Force and served as an <b>air</b> <b>observer</b> with the 6th Reconnaissance Squadron. He was wounded twice. At {{the end of the war}} in 1918, Piron held the rank of acting captain.|$|E
5|$|In October 1940, Saville flew to London with Chaney for {{temporary}} {{duty as a}} military <b>air</b> <b>observer</b> studying British air defenses, and returned to Mitchel Field after two months to become executive officer at the temporary rank of major of the First Interceptor Command. He began drafting a comprehensive air defense doctrine which combined features of the British system with those advocated by Chennault and himself. Saville was promoted to the permanent rank of major in February, 1941, and from March 25 to April 12, he conducted an intensive course in air defense given to 60 fighter group staff, including Kenneth P. Bergquist, posted to Hawaii's fighter wing. In August 1941, he returned to London and observed British air defense measures until December 1941. During this time, Saville's Air Defense Doctrine draft was reviewed by the USAAC, {{but it was not}} approved or published. Saville's proposed defense involved rigorous round-the-clock coordination between ground observers, radar installations, and centralized command posts to filter reports to defense forces consisting of anti-aircraft artillery batteries, barrage balloons, and fighter wings. Unusually, Saville proposed that fighter wings involved in air defense be completely separate from fighter wings making attacks on enemy air forces.|$|E

5|$|Many former Austro-Hungarian naval {{personnel}} {{were incorporated into}} the new navy, 90 per cent of whom were of Croatian or Slovene ethnicity. The remainder were Serbs, or non-Slavs such as Germans. Their former ranks were recognised and, initially at least, rank insignia and regulations were adopted from the former Austro-Hungarian Navy. By 1922, the KJRM consisted of 124 officers and about 3,000 men. The number of officers had more than halved {{since the end of}} 1919, largely due to disillusionment. To fill the looming shortfall, around 20 graduates from each of the 1921 and 1922 classes of the Yugoslav Military Academy in Belgrade were sent to the KJRM. In 1923, the new Naval Academy at Gruž accepted its first class of 40 midshipmen, who were to undergo a three-year training course. All entrants to the Naval Academy had to be between 17 and 20 years of age, and graduates of high school or similar nautical school. Two specialist schools for petty officers were established, one at Šibenik for deck crew, and a machinist's school at Kumbor in the Bay of Kotor. Mine and torpedo training was conducted at Đenovići, as was pilot and <b>air</b> <b>observer</b> training. A gunnery school was established at Meljine in the Bay of Kotor. Šibenik was also the home of the main coastal radio station, the signals school and the basic and specialist training school for seamen.|$|E

In October 1941, he was ordered to report to the Naval Air Station Pensacola, an unusual destination for a non-aviator. The United States Army Air Corps had requested that some Naval officers be sent to Maxwell Field, Alabama, as instructors in <b>air</b> <b>observer</b> [...] and navigator training, and Tarbuck was one of the three officers selected. At Maxwell, he wrote three manuals on ship and aircraft recognition, which became course materials. The ability to speak [...] "Army", and knowledge of the conduct of land, sea and air operations, would prove important in his selection for his next post. He was promoted to captain on 20 June 1942.|$|E

500|$|Selwyn Evans, {{known by}} his middle name of David, {{was born in}} the Sydney suburb of Paddington on 3June 1925. [...] The son of {{policeman}} Selwyn Douglas Evans and his wife Eileen, David was educated at Marist Brothers College in Mosman. A schoolboy when war was declared, he avidly followed reports of Allied fighter aces during the Battle of Britain, and resolved that, once he was old enough, he would serve as a pilot. He subsequently became one of the earliest recruits to the Air Training Corps, established in 1941 to facilitate basic training for youths aged 16 to 18 whose ambition was to become aircrew in the Royal Australian Air Force. After spending a short time as a bank clerk, Evans duly enlisted in the RAAF on 5June 1943. He received instruction under the Empire Air Training Scheme, firstly at No.2 Initial Training School in Bradfield Park, Sydney, then at No.5 Elementary Flying Training School in Narromine, New South Wales, and finally at No.8 Service Flying Training School in Bundaberg, Queensland. After graduating as a sergeant pilot, he was posted in October 1944 to the flying staff of No.1 <b>Air</b> <b>Observer</b> School at Evans Head, New South Wales. Promoted to flight sergeant, Evans {{was in the middle of}} a Bristol Beaufort light bomber conversion course at No.1 Operational Training Unit in East Sale, Victoria, when the war ended on 14August 1945. His Air Force career should have finished then and there, as he was slated for demobilisation along with thousands of other wartime enlistees. Evans was determined to remain and travelled to RAAF Headquarters in Melbourne to take his case to the officer responsible for discharges. He found a sympathetic ear and within days was transferred to No.38 Squadron, with which he flew C-47 Dakota transports on a regular courier service to Japan between October 1945 and May 1948.|$|E
2500|$|With {{the start}} of the Second World War, it was decided that Canada would become the major trainer for RAF pilots from the British Commonwealth.

2500|$|In {{the period}} after [...] (Operation Beach Party), 52 Squadron Royal Flying Corps (RFC) and the Fourth Balloon Wing, {{developed}} a III Wing practice of co-operation during artillery observation, by having balloon observers direct preliminary ranging, until shells were landing {{close to a}} target, then handing over to the aeroplane observer for the final corrections of aim. When the <b>air</b> <b>observer</b> had ranged the guns, the balloon observer took over again. The new method economised on aircrew and {{had the advantage of}} telephone communication between the ground and the balloon, since aircraft wireless could only transmit. Air co-operation with Royal Engineer sound ranging was also practised. A line of microphones were connected to a receiving station further back and activated by a forward observer. Air observers routinely sent [...] "NF" [...] by wireless and a position report when German batteries were seen to be firing and since German shelling often cut off the ground observer from contact with the rear, the sound-ranging station was equipped with a wireless receiver and used receipt of [...] "NF", to activate the sound ranging apparatus. The device could also be used to identify the position of German artillery, when the <b>air</b> <b>observer</b> was unable accurately to indicate the position of the guns; balloon observers also assisted the ranging section, by reporting gun flashes.|$|E
