5|$|These {{processes}} use a welding {{power supply}} to create and maintain an electric arc between an electrode and the base material to melt metals at the welding point. They can use either direct (DC) or alternating (<b>AC)</b> <b>current,</b> and consumable or non-consumable electrodes. The welding region is sometimes protected by some type of inert or semi-inert gas, known as a shielding gas, and filler material is sometimes used as well.|$|E
5|$|During that year, Tesla {{worked in}} Pittsburgh, helping {{to create an}} {{alternating}} current system to power the city's streetcars. He found it a frustrating period because of conflicts with the other Westinghouse engineers over how best to implement AC power. Between them, they settled on a 60-cycle <b>AC</b> <b>current</b> system that Tesla proposed (to match the working frequency of Tesla's motor), but they soon found {{that it would not}} work for streetcars, since Tesla's induction motor could run only at a constant speed. They ended up using a DC traction motor instead.|$|E
5|$|Older {{models that}} used tube power {{amplifiers}} {{used a variety}} of 6-pin connectors, while later models used a 9-pin connector. In all cases, for a single organ – Leslie configuration, the mains power, audio and control signals are all carried on the connector, and the design of the pin layouts varies between organs and speakers. Care must be taken when attempting to service them since an incorrectly or poorly wired cable can cause permanent damage to the organ and / or speaker, or result in electrocution. It is also possible to connect multiple Leslie speakers to a single organ, by using a power relay that provides the necessary <b>AC</b> <b>current.</b>|$|E
40|$|Two 500 -A class {{prototype}} high-temperature superconducting cables {{have been}} constructed by Southwire Company and tested at Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL). In the first cable, no insulation was used to separate the individual HTS tapes. In the second cable, Kapton tape was used to insulate the HTS tapes between successive layers {{for the study of}} <b>AC</b> loss and <b>current</b> distribution. The cables were tested with both DC and <b>AC</b> <b>currents</b> in liquid nitrogen from 77 to 69 K. Both cables achieved DC critical current, I{sub c} greater than 500 A. A calorimetric technique that measures the cable temperature rise under <b>ac</b> <b>currents</b> was used to measure the ac loss of the cables. The un-insulated cable showed a cryoresistive behavior under the 60 Hz <b>AC</b> <b>currents.</b> The insulated cable started to show measurable loss at current where there was corresponding resistive loss...|$|R
50|$|A {{relatively}} small DC current {{on the control}} winding is able to control or switch large <b>AC</b> <b>currents</b> on the <b>AC</b> windings. This results in current amplification.|$|R

25|$|Use an {{external}} charger, which converts <b>AC</b> <b>current</b> into DC current and charges the vehicle at 50kW (e.g. Nissan Leaf) or more (e.g. 120-135kW Tesla Model S).|$|E
25|$|For safe operation, the maximal {{temperature}} {{generated by}} any <b>AC</b> <b>current</b> {{flow through the}} capacitor is a limiting factor, which in turn limits AC load, ripple current, pulse load, etc.|$|E
25|$|A {{ripple current}} is the RMS {{value of a}} {{superimposed}} <b>AC</b> <b>current</b> of any frequency and any waveform of the current curve for continuous operation. It arises, for example, in power supplies (including switched-mode power supplies) after rectifying an AC voltage and flows as biased charge and discharge current through the decoupling or smoothing capacitor.|$|E

50|$|A {{rotating}} {{magnetic field}} can be constructed using two orthogonal coils with 90 degrees phase difference in their <b>AC</b> <b>currents.</b> However, in practice such a system would be supplied through a three-wire arrangement with unequal currents.|$|R
40|$|The {{synchronization}} of nanopillar vortex spin-transfer nano-oscillators {{with external}} <b>ac</b> injected <b>current</b> is considered. A collective variables description {{is used to}} derive an analytical reduced-order model for the vortex core dynamics. This model is able to predict all the possible vortex oscillation regimes {{as well as the}} transition mechanisms among them. In particular, it is shown that hysteretic synchronization occurs at moderate <b>ac</b> <b>currents.</b> The analytical results are in good agreement with micromagnetic simulations...|$|R
25|$|The dc {{converter}} at Lévis {{will be used}} to de-ice 5 lines: four 735 kV single-circuit lines and one 315 kV double-circuit line. Because of the different lengths and sizes of the conductor, the dc installation {{needs to be able to}} operate in various voltages and currents. To be de-iced, the line must be closed off from the <b>ac</b> <b>current</b> at both ends. Line conductors are used to form a closed loop.|$|E
25|$|These devices {{can be used}} at power {{levels of}} {{hundreds}} of kilowatts, and may be built to handle one to six phases of <b>AC</b> <b>current.</b> Mercury-arc rectifiers {{have been replaced by}} silicon semiconductor rectifiers and high-power thyristor circuits in the mid 1970s. The most powerful mercury-arc rectifiers ever built were installed in the Manitoba Hydro Nelson River Bipole HVDC project, with a combined rating of more than 1 GW and 450 kV.|$|E
25|$|A typical {{multimeter}} {{will give}} incorrect results {{when attempting to}} measure the <b>AC</b> <b>current</b> in a non-sinusoidal waveform; the instruments sense the average value of the rectified waveform. The average response is then calibrated to the effective RMS value. An RMS sensing multimeter must be {{used to measure the}} actual RMS currents and voltages (and therefore apparent power). To measure the real power or reactive power, a wattmeter designed to work properly with non-sinusoidal currents must be used.|$|E
50|$|This effect causes {{energy loss}} due to {{frictional}} heating in susceptible ferromagnetic cores. The effect is {{also responsible for}} the low-pitched humming sound that can be heard coming from transformers, where oscillating <b>AC</b> <b>currents</b> produce a changing magnetic field.|$|R
40|$|Plastronic Inc. {{is working}} on a project for the Ballistic Missile Defense Organization to improve the {{strength}} and ac loss characteristics of Bi-based High Temperature Superconductors (HTS) for ac applications like motors, generators, and transmission cables. High strength, high amperage conductor is made by encapsulating bundles of HTS tapes with a non-silver sheath. With this technique, Cu-alloy spacers can be placed between Bi- 2223 /Ag HTS tapes to de-couple the tapes under <b>ac</b> <b>currents.</b> <b>AC</b> losses were measured on conductor bundles with and without Cu-alloy spacers at <b>ac</b> <b>currents</b> up to 70 A and frequencies from 50 to 400 Hz. At frequencies up to about 100 Hz, {{it was found that the}} bundle with resistive barriers had ac loss equal to the sum of individual tapes as expected from the Norris ellipse model. At higher frequencies, the Cu-alloy barrier was not as effective in reducing the ac loss. For single tapes, Zr-oxide was used to coat the HTS filaments before stacking to form a multi- [...] ...|$|R

25|$|Power Quality Analyzers, often {{referred}} to as Power Analyzers, make a digital recording of the voltage and current waveform (typically either one phase or three phase) and accurately calculate true power (watts), apparent power (VA) power factor, AC voltage, <b>AC</b> <b>current,</b> DC voltage, DC current, frequency, IEC61000-3-2/3-12 Harmonic measurement, IEC61000-3-3/3-11 flicker measurement, individual phase voltages in delta applications where there is no neutral line, total harmonic distortion, phase and amplitude of individual voltage or current harmonics, etc.|$|E
25|$|Non-linear loads {{change the}} shape of the current {{waveform}} from a sine wave to some other form. Non-linear loads create harmonic currents in addition to the original (fundamental frequency) <b>AC</b> <b>current.</b> This is of importance in practical power systems that contain non-linear loads such as rectifiers, some forms of electric lighting, electric arc furnaces, welding equipment, switched-mode power supplies, variable speed drives and other devices. Filters consisting of linear capacitors and inductors can prevent harmonic currents from entering the supplying system.|$|E
25|$|All {{ferroelectric}} materials exhibit piezoelectricity a piezoelectric effect. Because Class 2 ceramic capacitors use ferroelectric ceramics dielectric, {{these types}} of capacitors may have electrical effects called microphonics. Microphonics (microphony) describes how electronic components transform mechanical vibrations into an undesired electrical signal (noise). The dielectric may absorb mechanical forces from shock or vibration by changing thickness and changing the electrode separation, affecting the capacitance, which in turn induces an <b>AC</b> <b>current.</b> The resulting interference is especially problematic in audio applications, potentially causing feedback or unintended recording.|$|E
50|$|One way of {{classifying}} {{power conversion}} systems is {{according to whether}} the input and output are alternating <b>current</b> (<b>AC)</b> or direct <b>current</b> (DC).|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} improve the {{transduction}} efficiency of electromagnetic acoustic transducer (EMAT) for steel plates inspection, the constitutive equation of magnetostrictive material was theoretically derived and simplified while the magnetostrictive force {{is parallel to the}} material surface. Based on the multiphysics field FEM, the effects of such excitation parameters as current, frequency, and pulse number in AC coils on magnetostrictive strain were mainly simulated, and the influence of the coil with different winding shapes on magnetostrictive strain was also analyzed. The simulation and experimental results indicate that magnetostrictive strain increases with a continuously increasing excitation current density, but it decreases with the increase of the frequency and pulse number of <b>AC</b> <b>currents.</b> Moreover, on condition that loop length and <b>AC</b> <b>currents</b> are held constant, spiral type coils have higher transduction efficiency than homocentric squares and figure-of-eight coils...|$|R

25|$|Capacitors, {{especially}} ceramic capacitors, {{and older}} designs such as paper capacitors, can absorb sound waves {{resulting in a}} microphonic effect. Vibration moves the plates, causing the capacitance to vary, in turn inducing <b>AC</b> <b>current.</b> Some dielectrics also generate piezoelectricity. The resulting interference is especially problematic in audio applications, potentially causing feedback or unintended recording. In the reverse microphonic effect, the varying electric field between the capacitor plates exerts a physical force, moving them as a speaker. This can generate audible sound, but drains energy and stresses the dielectric and the electrolyte, if any.|$|E
25|$|The {{simplest}} ballast for {{alternating current}} (AC) use is an inductor placed in series, consisting of a winding on a laminated magnetic core. The inductance of this winding limits the flow of <b>AC</b> <b>current.</b> This type is still used, for example, in 120 volt operated desk lamps using relatively short lamps. Ballasts are rated for the size of lamp and power frequency. Where the AC voltage is insufficient to start long fluorescent lamps, the ballast is often a step-up autotransformer with substantial leakage inductance (so as to limit the current flow). Either form of inductive ballast may also include a capacitor for power factor correction.|$|E
25|$|Electronic {{ballasts}} {{contain a}} small circuit board with a bridge rectifier, a filter capacitor and usually two switching transistors, {{which are often}} insulated-gate bipolar transistors. The incoming <b>AC</b> <b>current</b> is first rectified to DC, then converted to high frequency AC by the transistors, connected as a resonant series DC to AC inverter. The resulting high frequency {{is applied to the}} lamp tube. Since the resonant converter tends to stabilize lamp current (and light produced) over a range of input voltages, standard CFLs do not respond well in dimming applications and will experience a shorter lifespan and sometimes catastrophic failure. Special electronic ballasts (integrated or separate) are required for dimming service.|$|E

30|$|Firstly, the IGBTs of {{the other}} MMCs need to be {{protected}} immediately by blocking the adjacent MMCs. Nevertheless, the freewheeling diode cannot prevent the <b>AC</b> <b>currents</b> flowing into the DC grid, so the AC circuit breakers of the interconnected terminals need to be tripped.

The station rebranded as Planète Lov in August 2008, because of RNC {{rebranding}} most of their stations to the Planète name. By 2010, CHPR-FM decreased the amount of oldies played on the station.|$|R
500|$|Aluminum and {{magnesium}} {{are most often}} welded using alternating current, {{but the use of}} direct current is also possible, depending on the properties desired. Before welding, the work area should be cleaned and may be preheated to [...] for aluminum or to a maximum of [...] for thick magnesium workpieces to improve penetration and increase travel speed. <b>AC</b> <b>current</b> can provide a self-cleaning effect, removing the thin, refractory aluminum oxide (sapphire) layer that forms on aluminum metal within minutes of exposure to air.

When alternating current is used, pure tungsten electrodes or zirconiated tungsten electrodes are preferred over thoriated electrodes, as the latter are more likely to [...] "spit" [...] electrode particles across the welding arc into the weld. Blunt electrode tips are preferred, and pure argon shielding gas should be employed for thin workpieces. Introducing helium allows for greater penetration in thicker workpieces, but can make arc starting difficult.|$|E
