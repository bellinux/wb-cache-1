40|$|The two {{closely related}} {{eukaryotic}} AAA+ proteins, <b>TIP</b> 48 <b>and</b> <b>TIP</b> 49, are essential components of large multi-protein complexes {{that are involved}} in diverse cellular processes. Specific mechanisms for their activity in transcriptional regulation, chromatin remodelling, DNA repair and apoptosis have not yet been characterised; however, different oligomeric forms, sub-cellular localisation and post translational modification of <b>TIP</b> 48 <b>and</b> <b>TIP</b> 49 may be important in co-ordinating these functions. The assembly of the human <b>TIP</b> 48 <b>and</b> <b>TIP</b> 49 into different oligomers was studied. Both proteins were mainly monomeric in the absence of nucleotide cofactors. Incubation with ATP or ADP in the presence of Mg 2 + modified the distribution of TIP 48 oligomers to favour hexamers, but this did not occur with TIP 49. The double hexameric complex of TIP 48 /TIP 49 was also analysed and indicated a heterodisperse population of species, which provided clues about assembly pathways. <b>TIP</b> 48 <b>and</b> <b>TIP</b> 49 are structurally homologous to the bacterial branch migration motor RuvB. <b>TIP</b> 48 <b>and</b> <b>TIP</b> 49 do not incorporate the DNA binding domain present in RuvB, and instead have acquired a novel domain (Domain II) inserted between the Walker A and B ATPase motifs. Using mutants, we demonstrated that TIP 48 Domain II is critical for regulating nucleotide dependent hexamerisation of TIP 48. Furthermore, TIP 48 /TIP 49 complexes lacking Domain II indicated that hexamer-hexamer interactions are not exclusively mediated by Domain II; this domain may regulate the assembly of different forms of the heteromeric complex. Interactions between <b>TIP</b> 48 <b>and</b> <b>TIP</b> 49 <b>and</b> several putative binding partners were tested in vitro. The ATPase activity <b>and</b> oligomerisation of <b>TIP</b> 48 <b>and</b> <b>TIP</b> 49 were assayed in the presence of Hint 1, which was reported to disrupt the homotypic and heterotypic interactions within the TIP 48 /TIP 49 complex. Finally, the sub-cellular localisation and post translational modification of <b>TIP</b> 48 <b>and</b> <b>TIP</b> 49 were analysed. Using immunofluorescence <b>and</b> GFP-tagged <b>TIP</b> 49, we confirmed that <b>TIP</b> 48 <b>and</b> <b>TIP</b> 49 associate with the mitotic spindle; however, TIP 48 accumulates at the midbody during cytokinesis, while TIP 49 does not. Furthermore, we investigated potential modifications of <b>TIP</b> 48 <b>and</b> <b>TIP</b> 49 by 2 -D polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, which may account for the regulation of these distinct functions. ...|$|R

5|$|The North of England {{is often}} stereotypically {{represented}} through the clothing worn by working-class {{men and women}} in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. Working men would wear a heavy jacket and trousers held up by braces, an overcoat, and a hat, typically a flat cap, while women would wear a dress, or a skirt and blouse, with an apron on top as protection from dirt; in colder months they would often wear a shawl or headscarf. If not wearing leather lace-up shoes, some men and women would have worn English clogs, which were hardwearing and had replaceable soles <b>and</b> <b>tips.</b> Factory workers tapping their feet in time with the click of machinery developed a type of folk clog dance referred to as clogging, which was intricately developed in the North.|$|E
5|$|The adult green rosella has {{a yellow}} head and underparts with blue cheeks and red band on the {{forehead}} and upper lores. The yellow feathers of the forecrown, lower lores, cheeks, chest and thighs can have red markings, while the yellow feathers of the sides and rear {{of the head and}} neck, and the underparts have dark brown bases. The edges of the feathers on the underparts can be pale brown, resulting in a faint scalloping, which disappears with wear. Some of the yellow feathers of the nape have white bases and when worn, the bird can have a whitish patch on their nape. The yellow {{of the back of the}} head merges indistinctly into the dark plumage of the hindneck, mantle and back, which is black or dark brown with green margins. The feathers of the shoulders are blackish with yellow tips. These margins <b>and</b> <b>tips</b> are often worn by the finish of breeding season, leaving the plumage more solid black. The blue-violet feathers of the chin, throat and cheeks have brown-black bases. The blackish plumage of the back extends to the rump, and the long tail is dark green with brown shafts and dark blue outer feathers <b>and</b> <b>tips.</b> The wings are mostly black and green, with violet-blue marginal coverts, primary coverts, and alula, and blue-tinted dark brown primaries and outer secondaries. Underneath the feathers of the wings are dark brown with blue-violet tips. The iris is brown with a dark grey orbital ring, and the bill is pale-grey, with a dark grey cere. The legs are grey. The yellow plumage of the female is duller and more likely marked with red than that of the male, and the green edges to the black plumage of the upperparts are more prominent.|$|E

40|$|The box C/D small {{nucleolar}} RNPs (snoRNPs) {{are essential}} for the processing and modification of rRNA. <b>TIP</b> 48 <b>and</b> <b>TIP</b> 49 are two related AAA+ proteins that {{are essential for}} the formation of box C/D snoRNPs. These proteins are key components of the pre-snoRNP complexes, but their exact role in box C/D snoRNP biogenesis is largely uncharacterized. Here we report that <b>TIP</b> 48 <b>and</b> <b>TIP</b> 49 interact with one another in vitro, <b>and</b> only the <b>TIP</b> 48 /TIP 49 complex, but not the individual proteins, possesses significant ATPase activity. Loss of <b>TIP</b> 48 <b>and</b> <b>TIP</b> 49 results in a change in pre-snoRNA levels and a loss of U 3 snoRNA signal in the Cajal body. We show that <b>TIP</b> 48 <b>and</b> <b>TIP</b> 49 make multiple interactions with core snoRNP proteins and biogenesis factors and that these interactions are often regulated by the presence of ATP. Furthermore, we demonstrate that <b>TIP</b> 48 <b>and</b> <b>TIP</b> 49 efficiently bridge interactions between the core box C/D proteins NOP 56 or NOP 58 and 15. 5 K. Our data imply that the snoRNP assembly factor NUFIP can regulate the interactions between <b>TIP</b> 48 <b>and</b> <b>TIP</b> 49 <b>and</b> the core box C/D proteins. We suggest that snoRNP assembly involves an intricate series of interactions that are mediated/regulated by bridging factors and chaperones...|$|R

On November 4th, 2015, Tran was arrested without incident, after detectives, uniformed officers, and deputies from the Sacramento Police Department, Elk Grove Police Department, and Sacramento County Sheriff's Department conducted a traffic stop near his home in Elk Grove, California. Law enforcement officials involved in the case said that it did not appear Tran or anyone in his group knew of Stone's publicity. Officials also stated that the crime {{did not appear to be}} a retaliatory strike by a terrorist organization (either directly or indirectly) against Stone for his part in foiling a terror attack. Law enforcement officials stated that Tran has previous felony convictions, and that Tran was most likely intoxicated at the time of the assault.|$|E

40|$|In modern wind farms, {{maximum power}} point {{tracking}} (MPPT) is widely implemented. Using the MPPT method, each individual wind turbine is controlled by its pitch angle <b>and</b> <b>tip</b> speed ratio to generate the maximum active power. In a wind farm, the upstream wind turbine may cause power loss to its downstream wind turbines due to the wake effect. According to the wake model, downstream power loss is also determined by the pitch angle <b>and</b> <b>tip</b> speed ratio of the upstream wind turbine. By optimizing the pitch angle <b>and</b> <b>tip</b> speed ratio of each wind turbine, the total active power of the wind farm can be increased. In this paper, the optimal pitch angle <b>and</b> <b>tip</b> speed ratio are selected for each wind turbine by the exhausted search. Considering the estimation error of the wake model, a solution to implement the optimized pitch angle <b>and</b> <b>tip</b> speed ratio is proposed, which is to generate the optimal control curves for each individual wind turbine off-line. In typical wind farms with regular layout, based on the detailed analysis of the influence of pitch angle <b>and</b> <b>tip</b> speed ratio on the total active power of the wind farm by the exhausted search, the optimization is simplified with the reduced computation complexity. By using the optimized control curves, the annual energy production (AEP) is increased by 1. 03 % compared to using the MPPT method in a case-study of a typical eighty-turbine wind farm...|$|R
