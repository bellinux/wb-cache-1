This is the task of a liberal education: to {{give a sense of}} the value of things other than domination, to help create wise citizens of a free community, and through the combination of citizenship with liberty in individual creativeness to enable men to give to human life that splendour which some few have shown that it can achieve (Russell 1938:251).|$|E

The mottoes of the Kodokan Cultural Association were [...] "Good Use of Spiritual and Physical Strength" [...] and [...] "Prospering in Common for Oneself and Others." [...] Although those are literal translations, the phrases were usually translated into English as [...] "Maximum Efficiency with Minimum Effort" [...] and [...] "Mutual Welfare and Benefit." [...] The theories of this organization were described in some detail in an article published in an American magazine Living Age in September 1922.|$|E

As a result, several hundred thousand honest people perished. Everyone lived in fear in those days. Everyone expected that at any moment there would be {{a knock on the door}} in the middle of the night and that knock on the door would prove fatal... eople not to Stalin's liking were annihilated, honest party members, irreproachable people, loyal and hard workers for our cause who had gone through the school of revolutionary struggle under Lenin's leadership.

The council has refused to sell in order, as they stated, [...] "to preserve the annual Hull Fair held on the adjacent car park." [...] After the collapse of the negotiations, Allam stated: [...] "I had in mind £30 million to spend on the infrastructure of the club, to increase the stadium by 10,000 and to have commercial activities around the stadium — cafeterias, shops, supermarkets — to have <b>all</b> <b>this</b> <b>to</b> create income for the club so that in the future it can be self-financing and not relying on me."

500|$|Wright {{intended}} for the film to be [...] "as subjective as possible" [...] in being from Elizabeth's perspective; the audience first glimpses Darcy when she does. This focus on Elizabeth features some dramatic changes from the novel. Knightley's Elizabeth has an [...] "increasingly aloof and emotionally distant" [...] relationship with her family. Evidence {{of this can be}} seen with Elizabeth's gradual alienation from Jane as the film progresses; this is in contrast to the book, where Elizabeth confides more of her feelings to Jane after difficult events. Wright wanted to create a [...] "real" [...] relationship between the two sisters and have them grow apart, as he thought the book depicted them as too [...] "syrupy." [...] Moggach's intent was for Elizabeth to [...] "keep secrets to herself. They are a great burden to her... As she keeps <b>all</b> <b>this</b> <b>to</b> herself, we feel for her more and more. The truest comedy, I believe, is born from pain." ...|$|E

500|$|Other reviews {{were more}} mixed. Zack Handlen of The A.V. Club gave the episode a mixed review and grade it a C+. Handlen criticized the episode's lack of resolution, noting that [...] "The show can feed our social {{paranoia}} [...] {{but when it}} comes time to deliver on <b>all</b> <b>this,</b> <b>to</b> finally pull back the curtain and move on to the next stage, it fumbles things." [...] Furthermore, he called the Mulder/Scully/Fowley love triangle [...] "immediately off-putting" [...] and criticized Mimi Rogers's characterization. However, Handlen did call The Smoking Man's return [...] "thrilling" [...] and wrote that the burning of Mulder's office was [...] "arguably one of the most iconic visuals in the run of the series". Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson, in their book Wanting to Believe: A Critical Guide to The X-Files, Millennium & The Lone Gunmen, rated the episode three-and-a-half stars out of five. The two criticized the closing down of the X-Files division, due largely to the fact that [...] "we've seen [...] before", a reference to the divisions's closing at the conclusion of the show's first season. However, Shearman and Pearson wrote that [...] "'The End' works in spite of itself", citing the arrival of Diana Fowley and the confrontation between The Smoking Man and Jeffrey Spender as positive points in the episode.|$|E

2500|$|In {{the same}} year, vocalist and guitarist Arie {{as well as}} bassist Remy quit the band. According to Bart this {{decision}} was influenced by several factors; [...] "I had wanted to bring in someone into the band for vocals {{all the way back}} in 2001, this was not possible at the time as some ex-members of the band felt that it would diminish their importance or feel threatened." [...] He added, [...] "...you see, back in 2002, we weren't expecting <b>all</b> <b>this</b> <b>to</b> happen a month before recording - and to have to write {{the other half of the}} album in 4 weeks... if there had been no changes at all, we would have had to deal with similar issues anyway. That's because, little did we know at the time, the other guitarist had only one song ready a month before studio (despite telling us he had material for four songs) so either way we would have had four weeks to write the rest of the album. Maybe he chose to deal with it by leaving the band, I don't know and I don't really care." ...|$|E

2500|$|Pisciotta {{and eleven}} {{other members of}} the Giuliano band were convicted for the {{massacre}} in 1952. While alive, Giuliano himself made various, somewhat inconsistent statements about the matter, always insisting that the bloodshed was unintended. [...] He threatened to reveal the names of the men behind his actions, but never did. During the trial for the massacre, Pisciotta named the main conspirators as Leone Marchesano, a Palermo Mafioso and politician, and Prince Giuseppe Aliata of Monreale, with politician Cusumano Geloso as their intermediary—Pisciotta met only Geloso. His claims were confirmed by a letter delivered in 1969 to Giuseppe Montalbano, a long time leftist opponent of the reactionary establishment of Sicily. The writer, Antonio Ramirez—a prominent Palermo politician—ordered the letter delivered after his death. It stated that Gioacchino Barbera, a ranking Mafioso, had confirmed Pisciotta's accusations concerning Sicilian power-brokers, and also confirmed Giuliano's claim that the main conspirators did not intend the massacre. Barbera revealed <b>all</b> <b>this</b> <b>to</b> Ramirez during a December 1951 conversation. Billy Jaynes Chandler concludes that Sicily's reactionary establishment was the casus belli of the massacre, but that thanks to omerta and time, the details will never be revealed.

2500|$|Things {{soon began}} to fall apart. [...] A nine-year plague enveloped Morocco in 1598-1607, {{weakening}} the country tremendously, and taking al-Mansur in 1603. [...] His successor Abu Faris Abdallah was acclaimed in Marrakesh, but the jurists of Fez elevated his brother Zidan al-Nasir instead. Zidan managed to prevail and entered Marrakesh in 1609. [...] But now another brother, Muhammad al-Sheikh al-Ma'mun revolted in the north, and soon Zidan was reduced to Marrakesh. [...] As Saadian power buckled, Morocco fell into anarchy and fragmented into smaller pieces {{for much of the}} next century. [...] Zidan was driven out of Marrakesh by a religious leader, the self-proclaimed mahdi Ahmed ibn Abi Mahalli in 1612, and was only restored in 1614 with the assistance of another religious leader, Yahya ibn Abdallah, a Sufi marabout from the High Atlas, who subsequently tried to exert his own power over the city from 1618 until his death in 1626. [...] Zidan somehow found the time and resources during <b>all</b> <b>this</b> <b>to</b> complete the Saadian Tombs at the Kasbah mosque. However, there were not enough resources to complete a grand Saadian mosque begun by Ahmed al-Mansur, slated to be called the Jemaa al-Hana ("Mosque of Prosperity"); local people {{soon began to}} call the unfinished site the Jemaa el-Fnaa (Mosque of the Ruins), what would become the future central square of Marrakesh.|$|E
2500|$|The Elector however is {{concerned}} above all with discipline. Regardless of the victory, {{he has the}} Prince arrested for disobeying an order and tried at a court martial, where the Prince is condemned to death. He fails initially to grasp {{the seriousness of the}} situation, and starts to be truly concerned only when he hears that the Elector has signed his death warrant. The reality of his situation only hits home when he is shown the grave that has been dug for him. In the famous and controversial [...] "fear of death scene" [...] (Todesfurchtszene) the Prince begs for his life, prepared to give up all that is dear to him in return. When the Elector hears of the Prince's reaction, he too is confused, possibly astonished, but claims to have the greatest respect for the Prince's feeling. Instead of simply pardoning him, however, he sets a condition: if the Prince can genuinely call his condemnation unjust, he will be pardoned. The question raises the Prince to a state of enlightenment: he conquers his fear of death and is prepared to [...] "glorify" [...] the sentence by a suicide. It remains debatable whether he really considers his sentence justified. Nor does it ever come to light to what extent the Elector may have planned <b>all</b> <b>this</b> <b>to</b> teach him a lesson.|$|E
