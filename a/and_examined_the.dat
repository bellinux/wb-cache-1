5|$|Michael Persinger is a {{neurophysiologist}} who {{has worked}} at Laurentian University in Greater Sudbury, Ontario, Canada. He trained as a psychologist {{and focused on the}} impacts of religious experience. Persinger {{is the author of the}} book Neuropsychological Basis of Human Belief, and since its publication he has researched <b>and</b> <b>examined</b> <b>the</b> physiological and neurological causes of religious belief systems. Normand Carrey received education as a medical doctor and specialized in psychiatry. He became a child psychiatrist, and worked out of Dalhousie University in Halifax, Canada. Carrey has conducted studies into psychological resilience, and has taught physicians in a psychiatry residency program in the field of family therapy. He has worked in the field of adolescent psychiatry at IWK Health Centre. Lynn Suess assisted Persinger in 1980, in researching geological phenomena which may have affected unidentified flying object sightings in Washington. Suess and Persinger performed similar research in Toronto and Ottawa.|$|E
5|$|The first {{histories}} of Henry's reign {{emerged in the}} 16th and 17th centuries, relying primarily on the accounts of medieval chroniclers, in particular writings of Roger of Wendover and Matthew Paris. These early historians, including Archbishop Matthew Parker, were influenced by contemporary concerns about {{the roles of the}} Church and state, <b>and</b> <b>examined</b> <b>the</b> changing nature of kingship under Henry, the emergence of English nationalism during the period and what they perceived to be the malign influence of the Papacy. During the English Civil War, historians also drew parallels between Henry's experiences and those of the deposed Charles I.|$|E

5|$|In a {{statement}} on its website, ReactOS cited differing legal definitions of what constitutes clean-room reverse engineering as a cause for the conflict. Some countries, including the United States, require that a reimplementation based on disassembled code must be written by someone other than the person having disassembled <b>and</b> <b>examined</b> <b>the</b> original code, whereas other countries allow both tasks to be performed by the same individual. Consequently, ReactOS clarified that its Intellectual Property Policy Statement requirements on clean room reverse engineering conform to US law. An internal source code audit was conducted to ensure that only clean room reverse engineering was used, and all developers were made to sign an agreement committing them {{to comply with the}} project's policies on reverse engineering. Contributors to its development were not affected by these events, and all access to the software development tools was restored shortly afterward. In September 2007, with the audit nearing completion, the audit status was removed from the ReactOS homepage. Though the audit was completed, specific details were not made public as it was only an internal effort to ensure compliance with the project's own policies.|$|E

At 18:28, the Dublin-Belfast train was stopped at Dundalk and searched by a team of 18 Gardaí led by an inspector.

Drăguș, a center of the ethnographic region known as Țara Oltului, was selected on his insistence, being located {{in close proximity to}} his native village. At Cornova, Herseni focused on the social hierarchies and segregated clans of a Bessarabian community. He spent some time researching on his own at a sheepcote in the Făgăraș Mountains, publishing his results in Boabe de Grâu review. He also began contributing to the Cluj magazine Societatea de Mâine, with articles that inventoried <b>and</b> <b>examined</b> <b>the</b> various kinds of social distance.|$|E
25|$|An English {{tradition}} of the 19th century ("riddling the ashes") involved spodomancy on St. Mark's Eve (April 24). Ashes would be left on the hearth on St. Mark's Eve, <b>and</b> <b>examined</b> <b>the</b> next day. Folklore said that the footprint of anyone who was {{to die in the}} coming year would be left in the ashes. On the Isle of Man, a similar tradition was observed, although a death would occur only if the footprint pointed inward (an outward-pointing imprint would mean a birth). Another Manx tradition has it that riddling the ashes on St. Mark's Eve or Halloween will allow the spirit-imprint of one's future husband to appear in the ashes the next morning. Elsewhere in Europe, the riddling of the ashes to learn of births and deaths was observed on Halloween or New Year's Eve.|$|E
25|$|On 13 November, Korostik's {{body was}} found; {{she was the}} 36th known victim linked to the manhunt.

Not only was Chikatilo's name among those reports, but it was familiar to several officers involved in the case, {{because he had been}} questioned in 1984, and had been placed upon a 1987 suspect list compiled and distributed throughout the Soviet Union. After checking with Chikatilo's present and previous employers, investigators were able to place him in various towns and cities at times when several victims linked to the investigation had been killed. Questioning of former colleagues from Chikatilo's teaching days revealed that Chikatilo had been forced to resign from two teaching positions due to repeated complaints of lewd behaviour and sexual assault made by his pupils.|$|E
