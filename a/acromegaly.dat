5|$|Hypercementosis is {{excessive}} {{formation of}} cementum, which {{may result from}} trauma, inflammation, <b>acromegaly,</b> rheumatic fever, and Paget's disease of bone.|$|E
5|$|Sometimes, {{there are}} {{additional}} symptoms {{that arise from}} the underlying cause; for instance, if the hypopituitarism {{is due to a}} growth hormone-producing tumor, there may be symptoms of <b>acromegaly</b> (enlargement of the hands and feet, coarse facial features), and if the tumor extends to the optic nerve or optic chiasm, there may be visual field defects. Headaches may also accompany pituitary tumors, as well as pituitary apoplexy (infarction or haemorrhage of a pituitary tumor) and lymphocytic hypophysitis (autoimmune inflammation of the pituitary). Apoplexy, in addition to sudden headaches and rapidly worsening visual loss, may also be associated with double vision that results from compression of the nerves in the adjacent cavernous sinus that control the eye muscles.|$|E
5|$|Universal {{sold the}} film to PRC for $125,000, which {{represented}} the negative cost plus interest. The transaction occurred around August 1946, but was not made public until it was screened for the trade press on October1, marking its official release date. The sale occurred so quickly and hastily on the copyright files stores at the Library of Congress, the name Universal Pictures was crossed out and Pathe Industries, PRC's corporate body, was written in its place in pencil. Some pressbook advertisements circulated for the film still included the Universal Pictures logo. PRC had previously produced a horror film about <b>acromegaly</b> called The Monster Maker (1944), in which a mad scientist injects human subjects with the disease {{as part of his}} experiments.|$|E
5|$|Although {{produced}} by Universal Pictures, The Brute Man was distributed by Producers Releasing Corporation, {{one of the}} smaller film studios from Hollywood's Poverty Row. In 1945, Universal merged with the company International Pictures, and the new organization adopted a policy against developing any more B movies, including Westerns, horror films, serials and movies running 70minutes or less. This resulted in the firing of numerous production personnel members and the sale of several already-developed films, including The Brute Man. The sale was also perpetuated in part by the death of star Rondo Hatton. He {{died as a result of}} his <b>acromegaly</b> on February2, 1946, about eight months before The Brute Man was first screened, making it his final film. Universal feared releasing the film so soon after his death would lead to accusations that the studio was exploiting the illness that ultimately killed Hatton. Now embarrassed by the film, the studio was anxious to sell it.|$|E
5|$|The {{pituitary}} {{was known}} to the ancients, such as Galen, and various theories were proposed about {{its role in the}} body, but major clues as to the actual function of the gland were not advanced until the late 19th century, when <b>acromegaly</b> due to pituitary tumors was described. The first known report of hypopituitarism was made by the German physician and pathologist Dr Morris Simmonds. He described the condition on autopsy in a 46-year-old woman who had suffered severe puerperal fever eleven years earlier, and subsequently suffered amenorrhea, weakness, signs of rapid aging and anemia. The pituitary gland was very small and there were few remnants of both the anterior and the posterior pituitary. The eponym Simmonds' syndrome is used infrequently for acquired hypopituitarism, especially when cachexia (general ill health and malnutrition) predominates. Most of the classic causes of hypopituitarism were described in the 20th century; the early 21st century saw the recognition of how common hypopituitarism could be in previous head injury victims.|$|E
25|$|<b>Acromegaly</b> (also {{known as}} hypersomatotropism) is a {{hormonal}} condition resulting from over-secretion {{of the growth}} hormone somatotropin from the pituitary gland. The hormone is responsible for growth from birth to adulthood. Normally in adulthood, the growth plates of the bones close and the secretion of the hormone slows considerably. Because the bone plates close when entering maturity, the continued growth of <b>acromegaly</b> is not of normal proportions. Most dogs with the disease are unspayed females, but the condition can come about with use of medications containing progesterone. <b>Acromegaly</b> patients often also have diabetes mellitus. There is a transient form of <b>acromegaly</b> which can affect females at the diestrus portion of the reproductive cycle. This condition is {{brought about by the}} mammary glands excreting excess growth hormone, which is triggered by progesterone from the ovaries. As with non-transient <b>acromegaly,</b> spaying is necessary. The symptoms can include overgrowth or enlargement of gums with wide spaces between teeth, increased drinking, increased urination, thickening of the skin and skin folds, enlargement of the tongue and excessive panting. <b>Acromegaly</b> is also possible from a somatotroph adenoma. The hormone somatostatin can also be useful in treatment. Since hypothyroidism is connected with the release of excess growth hormone, hypothyroidism can be mistaken for <b>acromegaly.</b>|$|E

25|$|During a heavy concert {{schedule}} in Russia in 1912, he interrupted his schedule because of stiffness in his hands. This {{may have been}} due to overuse, although carpal tunnel syndrome or simply swelling and puffiness of the hands associated with <b>acromegaly</b> may have been the cause. In 1942, Rachmaninov made a final revision of his troublesome Fourth Concerto but composed no more new music. A rapidly progressing melanoma forced him to break off his 1942–1943 concert tour after a recital in Knoxville, Tennessee. A little over five weeks later he died in the house he had bought the year before on Elm Drive in Beverly Hills. Melanoma is associated with <b>acromegaly</b> and may have been a final clue to Rachmaninov's diagnosis.|$|E

25|$|Prolonged GH excess thickens {{the bones}} of the jaw, fingers and toes. Resulting {{heaviness}} of the jaw and increased size of digits is referred to as <b>acromegaly.</b> Accompanying problems can include sweating, pressure on nerves (e.g., carpal tunnel syndrome), muscle weakness, excess sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG), insulin resistance or even a rare form of type 2 diabetes, and reduced sexual function.|$|E

25|$|IGFBP-3 {{levels in}} human serum are, like IGF-1, {{dependent}} on growth hormone (GH); for example, serum IGFBP-3 is increased in <b>acromegaly</b> {{and low in}} GH-deficient children. However, IGFBP-3 gene expression in human liver is GH-independent. Because it is stabilized in human serum by forming complexes with IGF-1 and ALS, which are both GH-dependent, serum IGFBP-3 also appears regulated by GH. Its production by some non-hepatic tissues may also be directly GH-regulated. Immunoassays for serum IGFBP-3 are often used {{as part of the}} diagnosis of childhood GH-deficiency.|$|E
25|$|Dating to {{approximately}} the year 1550, outbreeding in Charles II's lineage had ceased (see also pedigree collapse). From then on, all his ancestors were {{in one way}} or another descendants of Joanna and Philip I of Castile, and among these just the royal houses of Spain, Austria and Bavaria. Charles II's genome was actually more homozygous than that of a child whose parents are siblings. He was born physically and mentally disabled, and disfigured. Possibly through affliction with mandibular prognathism, he was barely able to chew. His tongue was so large that his speech could barely be understood, and he frequently drooled. It has been suggested that he suffered from the endocrine disease <b>acromegaly,</b> or his inbred lineage may have led to a combination of rare genetic disorders such as combined pituitary hormone deficiency and distal renal tubular acidosis.|$|E
500|$|The Brute Man is a quasi-prequel to House of Horrors, {{in which}} Hatton played a {{deformed}} madman named [...] "The Creeper" [...] who kills people by breaking their backs. In The Brute Man Hatton also plays [...] "The Creeper", while the story explains how he became deformed {{and why he}} has a murderous personality. Hatton also played a disfigured killer called the Huxton Creeper in The Pearl of Death, a 1944 Sherlock Holmes film, but neither House of Horrors nor The Brute Man have any connection to that film. In establishing a backstory explaining the Creeper's motives, The Brute Mans script seeks to humanize the character and elicit more sympathy for him than the Creeper's other films, {{in which he is}} generally portrayed as a two-dimensional murderer. The origin of the Creeper is based partially on autobiographical details from Hatton's real life. Before becoming disfigured by an accident, the Creeper was a handsome young college football hero. Hatton himself was also a football player at the University of Florida before suffering from the effects of <b>acromegaly,</b> a syndrome that causes abnormal bone growth due to excess growth hormone from the pituitary gland. In the film, the character is disfigured by chemicals during a laboratory accident in school. While Hatton's real-life abnormalities stemmed from <b>acromegaly,</b> it was often incorrectly stated by Universal Pictures publicity materials that they were the result of exposure to mustard gas attacks during Hatton's service in World War I.|$|E
500|$|Decades {{after the}} film's release, {{contemporary}} reviews of The Brute Man were similarly negative, with many commentators criticizing {{the exploitation of}} Hatton's real-life <b>acromegaly.</b> Film reviewer Leonard Maltin gave the film one-and-a-half out of four stars. John Stanley, host of the KTVU television show Creature Features, {{described it as a}} dull and [...] "shoddy thriller", criticizing both the performances and the mood from the direction and photography. The authors of Universal Horrors: The Studio's Classic Films, 1931-1946 were highly critical of the film's dialogue, and claimed much of the script seemed to be [...] "time-killing stuff" [...] to pad the film's already-short running time. They wrote that Hatton's acting was so bad, it [...] "wouldn't be acceptable even at a pre-production cast get-together and table reading, much less in the movie itself".|$|E
500|$|The Brute Man marked one {{of several}} films in which Universal Pictures cast Hatton as a murderer, taking {{advantage}} of his natural deformities for shock value. As {{a result of his}} <b>acromegaly,</b> Hatton had abnormally enlarged and shaped bones on his head and hands, and the Universal Pictures publicity department often promoted the fact that Hatton did not need make-up for his roles. Tom Neal, who had recently appeared in the cult classic noir film Detour (1945), was cast as Clifford Scott. Having appeared in dozens of low-budget films throughout the early-1940s, Neal began to become known as the [...] "King of the B Pictures". In The Brute Man, Neal portrayed Scott both in his older years and in the flashback scenes, where the character appears as a college student. To differentiate between the two, Neal was fitted with make-up and costumes to make him better resemble a middle-aged man during his non-flashback scenes. Jane Adams was cast as the blind pianist Helen Paige. Adams had appeared in several Universal Pictures films before, including the Lon Chaney, Jr. film House of Dracula (1945).|$|E
500|$|The Brute Man was {{developed}} by Universal Pictures Company, Inc. in the later years of their successful production of horror films, including Dracula (1931), Frankenstein (1931) and The Mummy (1932). While those films were great critical and financial successes, The Brute Man was filmed during what was widely considered the low point of the studio's horror film period. It was produced by Ben Pivar and directed by Jean Yarbrough, both of whom had worked on House of Horrors and many other horror films for Universal over the years. The Brute Man was filmed in 13 days, during November 1945. The flashback scenes—which depict how Hal Moffet became disfigured and ultimately became the Creeper—were all shot {{on the final day}} of filming. Jane Adams said Hatton's <b>acromegaly</b> was becoming progressively worse by the time The Brute Man was filmed, and it made acting difficult for him. Hatton had trouble remembering his lines, focusing on his performance, and responding to the other actors. Hatton occasionally appears confused even on screen, like during one scene where he says [...] "yes" [...] while shaking his head [...] "no." [...] Adams called him a friendly and thoughtful man, but called him [...] "so pathetic to work with [...] almost autistic".|$|E
2500|$|A 2012 review {{could not}} find strong {{evidence}} for any cause, although many theories have been discredited. Because twins and relatives {{are more likely to}} get myopia under similar circumstances, there must be a hereditary factor. [...] Myopic shifts seen during growth spurts of childhood and adolescence, as well as in <b>acromegaly,</b> indicates a relationship between the timing of myopic development and the release of human growth hormone. [...] However, the lack of correlation between height and myopia seems to suggest the relationship between human growth hormone and myopia is complex.|$|E

2500|$|While {{growth hormone}} (GH) {{decreases}} with age, {{the evidence for}} use of growth hormone as an anti-aging therapy is mixed and based mostly on animal studies.

Studies relating GH and IGF-1 status to longevity provide inconsistent evidence as to whether decreased (somatopause) or high levels (e.g. <b>acromegaly)</b> of these hormones are beneficial or detrimental to longevity....

50|$|In a few patients, <b>acromegaly</b> {{is caused}} not by {{pituitary}} tumors, but by {{tumors of the}} pancreas, lungs, and adrenal glands. These tumors also lead to an excess of GH, either because they produce GH themselves or, more frequently, because they produce GHRH (growth hormone releasing hormone), the hormone that stimulates the pituitary to make GH. In these patients, the excess GHRH {{can be measured in}} the blood and establishes that the cause of the <b>acromegaly</b> is not due to a pituitary defect. When these nonpituitary tumors are surgically removed, GH levels fall and the symptoms of <b>acromegaly</b> improve.|$|E
50|$|The {{primary current}} medical {{treatment}} of <b>acromegaly</b> {{is to use}} somatostatin analogues - octreotide (Sandostatin) or lanreotide (Somatuline).These somatostatin analogues are synthetic forms of a brain hormone, somatostatin, which stops GH production.
