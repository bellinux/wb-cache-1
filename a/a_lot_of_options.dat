5000|$|On 2 June, Camelot {{started the}} 8/13 {{favourite}} for the Epsom Derby {{in front of}} a crowd of 130,000, which included Queen Elizabeth II, who was beginning the celebrations for her Diamond Jubilee. His main rival was expected to be Bonfire, his former paddock companion at Highclere, who had won the Dante Stakes. Other contenders in the field of nine (the smallest since 1907) included Main Sequence, the winner of the Lingfield Derby Trial, and Camelot's stable companion Astrology, who had won the Dee Stakes by eleven lengths. Ridden by Joseph O'Brien, Camelot was restrained {{at the back of the}} field as Astrology made the running. Camelot moved up to challenge for the lead in the straight and pulled clear to win by five lengths from Main Sequence in second and Astrology in third. The victory made O'Brien and Joseph, 19, the first father-son/trainer-jockey pairing to win the race. After the race, Joseph O'Brien explained that the horse had struggled to cope with the descent to the turn into the straight, saying that Camelot [...] "had only run three times before and never on a track like this, so he was looking where to put his feet round Tattenham Corner". The win gave Aidan O'Brien his fourth British Classic win of the season and led to speculation that Camelot could become the first horse since Nijinsky in 1970 to win the Triple Crown. Since Nijinsky, only two horses have won the 2000 Guineas and the Derby: Nashwan in 1989 and Sea the Stars in 2009, neither of whom contested the St Leger.
