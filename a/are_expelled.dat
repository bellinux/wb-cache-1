5|$|Metagenomics {{can provide}} {{valuable}} {{insights into the}} functional ecology of environmental communities. Metagenomic analysis of the bacterial consortia found in the defecations of Australian sea lions suggests that nutrient-rich sea lion faeces {{may be an important}} nutrient source for coastal ecosystems. This is because the bacteria that <b>are</b> <b>expelled</b> simultaneously with the defecations are adept at breaking down the nutrients in the faeces into a bioavailable form that can be taken up into the food chain.|$|E
50|$|If a student(s) has <b>been</b> <b>expelled</b> {{from two}} schools, then any state school is legally allowed to refuse {{admittance}} of that student. (Schools on special measures may refuse to admit {{a student who}} has <b>been</b> <b>expelled</b> from only one school.) Therefore, a student who has <b>been</b> <b>expelled</b> from two schools might be totally removed from the state education system. As a result, it is rare for a pupil to <b>be</b> <b>expelled</b> (or permanently excluded) in the UK's state sector.|$|R

5|$|Several {{types of}} {{volcanic}} eruptions—during which lava, tephra (ash, lapilli, volcanic bombs and volcanic blocks), and assorted gases <b>are</b> <b>expelled</b> from a volcanic vent or fissure—have been distinguished by volcanologists. These are often named after famous volcanoes where {{that type of}} behavior has been observed. Some volcanoes may exhibit only one characteristic type of eruption {{during a period of}} activity, while others may display an entire sequence of types all in one eruptive series.|$|E
5|$|In a {{volcanic}} eruption, lava, tephra (volcanic bombs, lapilli, and ash), and various gases <b>are</b> <b>expelled</b> from {{a volcanic}} vent or fissure. While many eruptions only pose dangers to the immediately surrounding area, Earth's largest eruptions {{can have a}} major regional or even global impact, with some affecting the climate and contributing to mass extinctions. Volcanic eruptions can generally be characterized as either explosive eruptions, sudden ejections of rock and ash, or effusive eruptions, relatively gentle outpourings of lava. A separate list is given below for each type.|$|E
5|$|Mike and Sulley are {{led away}} by the CDA, and <b>are</b> <b>expelled</b> from the {{university}} {{as a result of}} their actions, but the other members of Oozma Kappa are accepted into the scare program the next semester, as Hardscrabble was impressed by their performances in the scare games. As Mike leaves on the bus, Sulley runs after him to raise his spirits. Hardscrabble then appears and wishes the two luck, claiming they were the first students to have surprised her. The two take jobs in the mail room of Monsters, Inc., eventually working their way up to join the Scarer Team and setting the events of Monsters, Inc. in motion.|$|E

5|$|Most spiders convert {{nitrogenous}} {{waste products}} into uric acid, {{which can be}} excreted as a dry material. Malphigian tubules ("little tubes") extract these wastes from the blood in the hemocoel and dump them into the cloacal chamber, from which they <b>are</b> <b>expelled</b> through the anus. Production of uric acid and its removal via Malphigian tubules are a water-conserving feature that has evolved independently in several arthropod lineages that can live far away from water, for example the tubules of insects and arachnids develop from completely {{different parts of the}} embryo. However, a few primitive spiders, the sub-order Mesothelae and infra-order Mygalomorphae, retain the ancestral arthropod nephridia ("little kidneys"), which use large amounts of water to excrete nitrogenous waste products as ammonia.|$|E
5|$|In {{contrast}} to extracellular fluid, cytosol {{has a high}} concentration of potassium ions and a low concentration of sodium ions. This difference in ion concentrations is critical for osmoregulation, since if the ion levels were the same inside a cell as outside, water would enter constantly by osmosis - since the levels of macromolecules inside cells are higher than their levels outside. Instead, sodium ions <b>are</b> <b>expelled</b> and potassium ions taken up by the Na⁺/K⁺-ATPase, potassium ions then flow down their concentration gradient through potassium-selection ion channels, this loss of positive charge creates a negative membrane potential. To balance this potential difference, negative chloride ions also exit the cell, through selective chloride channels. The loss of sodium and chloride ions compensates for the osmotic effect of the higher concentration of organic molecules inside the cell.|$|E

5000|$|Like {{the rest}} of the British {{communist}} movement the NCP from the beginning had to deal with what they saw as ultra-leftism and right-wing deviation. All were defeated at congresses over the years and many <b>were</b> <b>expelled</b> for factionalism. In the early 1980s an extreme pro-Soviet faction called [...] "Proletarian" [...] <b>was</b> <b>expelled.</b> In the early 1990s another small group <b>was</b> <b>expelled</b> which later formed the Communist Action Group.|$|R

25|$|Infection {{initially}} {{begins by}} the ingestion of foods, water, or intermediate hosts contaminated by adult worms. The infective adults {{migrate to the}} larynx or trachea and attach to the mucosal walls. Sexual reproduction occurs here, and the females begin to lay eggs in the upper respiratory region. Eggs do not develop at body temperature, and <b>are</b> <b>expelled</b> in sputum or reswallowed and excreted in feces.|$|E
25|$|After {{insertion}} of the catheter, the contents <b>are</b> <b>expelled</b> and the embryos are deposited. Limited evidence supports making trial transfers before performing the procedure with embryos. After expulsion, the duration that the catheter remains inside the uterus {{has no effect}} on pregnancy rates. Limited evidence suggests avoiding negative pressure from the catheter after expulsion. After withdrawal, the catheter is handed to the embryologist, who inspects it for retained embryos.|$|E
25|$|A {{well known}} {{response}} of cephalopods when threatened is to release {{large volumes of}} ink. Some cephalopods also release pseudomorphs ("false bodies"); smaller clouds of ink with a greater mucus content, which allows them to hold their shape for longer. These <b>are</b> <b>expelled</b> slightly away from the cephalopod; they are roughly the same volume and look like the cephalopod that released them. Predators have often been seen attacking a pseudomorph, allowing the cephalopod to escape.|$|E

25|$|Nitrogen oxides (NOx) - Nitrogen oxides, {{particularly}} nitrogen dioxide, <b>are</b> <b>expelled</b> {{from high}} temperature combustion, {{and are also}} produced during thunderstorms by electric discharge. They {{can be seen as}} a brown haze dome above or a plume downwind of cities. Nitrogen dioxide is a chemical compound with the formula NO2. It is one of several nitrogen oxides. One of the most prominent air pollutants, this reddish-brown toxic gas has a characteristic sharp, biting odor.|$|E
25|$|While the {{complete}} life cycle {{is still not}} fully known, transmission {{is thought to be}} oral-fecal, where infection comes from ingesting contaminated food or water containing embryonated eggs, hatched larvae, or intermediate hosts. Possible intermediate host candidates include earthworms, snails, and arthropods. Eggs <b>are</b> <b>expelled</b> in sputum or feces. Most often, travelers to tropical climate places become exposed to contaminated sources and are diagnosed upon return to their country. The best preventative measure is to ensure proper food preparation and water sanitation.|$|E
25|$|The first phenomenological {{theory of}} {{superconductivity}} was London theory. It was {{put forward by}} the brothers Fritz and Heinz London in 1935, shortly after the discovery that magnetic fields <b>are</b> <b>expelled</b> from superconductors. A major triumph of the equations of this theory is their ability to explain the Meissner effect, wherein a material exponentially expels all internal magnetic fields as it crosses the superconducting threshold. By using the London equation, one can obtain the dependence of the magnetic field inside the superconductor on {{the distance to the}} surface.|$|E
50|$|The MAS {{tendency}} <b>was</b> <b>expelled</b> {{from the}} party at the Seventh National Plenum of the party. Some MAS members, who had <b>been</b> <b>expelled</b> from PDCH, founded the Socialist Party (PASO) in November 1978. The MAS split significantly weakened the PDCH.|$|R
