5000|$|In May 2009 Gill Pratt—along with Mose Jefferson, Betty Jefferson, and Angela Coleman (Betty Jefferson's daughter)—was {{indicted on}} federal {{racketeering}} charges. Mose Jefferson was also facing a separate trial for bribing Orleans Parish School Board president Ellenese Brooks-Simms. [...] The racketeering indictment contained {{a relationship to}} the bribery case {{in that part of}} the alleged racketeering involved Gill Pratt's supposed obtaining of $300,000 for a couple of private schools so that they could buy the software which Mose Jefferson, with Ellenese Brooks-Simms' help, also sold to the public schools; according to the indictment, Mose Jefferson's commission on the sales to the private schools was $30,000, of which Gill Pratt pocketed $3500. Within a week of the indictment of Gill Pratt, John Pope reported in the Times-Picayune that Gill Pratt was being appointed to a SUNO position which carries no additional pay. In the same article Pope described Mose Jefferson as [...] "Gill Pratt's longtime companion"—a situation noted as being [...] "as close as it gets" [...] by columnist Stephanie Grace. Gill Pratt's appointment to SUNO's Executive Cabinet was immediately criticized by, among others, Louisiana Governor Bobby Jindal. Amid astonishment over the appropriateness and timing of the appointment—in that all Louisiana public universities were facing steep budget cuts and suggestions were circulating that SUNO should be merged with the neighboring University of New Orleans—Gill Pratt, with the urging of SUNO chancellor Victor Ukpolo, went on a leave of <b>absence</b> <b>without</b> <b>pay.</b>|$|E

40|$|Administrative leave is an {{authorized}} absence with pay, {{which may be}} granted to employees when it is determined that an emergency situation exists. Normally, administrative leave will be granted for only {{a short period of}} time. Administrative leave may be authorized by the President (or designee), when it appears that the health or safety of employees may be jeopardized, and it is consequently deemed necessary for employees to vacate their work site. This policy establishes a procedure for making a determination that an emergency situation exists and that administrative leave should be authorized. Campus Officially Closed: If the campus if officially closed, eligible employees should be paid “administrative leave ” if they were scheduled to work during the period of closure. However, employees on sick leave, vacation, or scheduled on a personal holiday or CTO, will be charged for that paid time off. Employees in a non-pay status, such as regular day off or disciplinary suspension, are not eligible for administrative pay. Collective bargaining agreements address this issue and the Office of Human Resources will provide guidance {{if there is to be}} any deviation from this standard. Campus Officially Open: When the campus is officially open and employees are not able to report to work, they must use accrued vacation, personal holiday, or CTO to remain in pay status. They also have the option of choosing a leave of <b>absence</b> <b>without</b> <b>pay,</b> as appropriate. Partial Campus Closure: If portions of the campus are closed, the emergency pay provisions of the collective bargaining agreement are available only to those employees working in an area that has been closed. PROCEDURES: When the President (or designee) determines that the granting of administrative leave is appropriate, affected departments will be notified directly. RESPONSIBILITIES: The President (or designee) is responsible for determining when an emergency situation exists that requires the granting of administrative leave. REFERENCES...|$|E
