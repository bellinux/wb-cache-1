This was Banks' tenth time as the Avery character. Banks told Michael Ausiello of Entertainment Weekly that she approached the 30 Rock staff about making an appearance as she {{is a fan of}} the show. [...] "I definitely put feelers out, like, 'I would love to be on your show.' And they did it. They made it happen! I'm a huge fan, so this is a dream come true." [...] Banks also revealed that she has no intention on becoming a series regular, explaining that she has been having [...] "too much fun" [...] making films to commit to a television show full-time. Comedian actor Will Forte made his fourth appearance in the show, having guest starred as a different character in the February 1, 2007, episode [...] "Black Tie" [...] from the show's first season. In the previous season, Forte played Jenna Maroney's boyfriend and Jenna impersonator.

Tina Fey, the series creator and lead actress on 30 Rock, was the head writer on SNL from 1999 until 2006. In June 2010, Jane Krakowski, who plays Jenna, confirmed that Forte would reprise his role as her boyfriend in the upcoming season. Carlock also noted in the Entertainment Weekly interview that the Jenna and Paul characters [...] "have some ups and downs. He wants to try to be a normal couple, and she is <b>afraid</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> level of commitment." [...] In the previous episode, [...] "Chain Reaction of Mental Anguish", Jenna and Paul break-up. In [...] "Christmas Attack Zone", the two get back together.|$|E
2500|$|The {{writing is}} also notable for its minimal use of dialogue. Josh Brolin {{discussed}} his initial nervousness with having so little dialogue to work with: I {{mean it was}} a fear, for sure, because dialogue, that's what you kind of rest upon as an actor, you know? [...] Drama and all the stuff is all dialogue motivated. You {{have to figure out}} different ways to convey ideas. You don't want to overcompensate because the fear is that you're going to be boring if nothing's going on. You start doing this and this and taking off your hat and putting it on again or some bullshit that doesn't need to be there. So yeah, I was a little <b>afraid</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> in the beginning.|$|E
2500|$|In a November 2015 interview, Sundfør {{stated that}} {{she was working on}} the album, calling it [...] "very cosmic" [...] and added {{that a lot of the}} {{inspiration}} for it came from reading the book A Universe from Nothing. The album was mainly inspired by a journey Sundfør made, [...] "travelling across continents to contrary environments and politically contrasting worlds from North Korea to the Amazon jungle." [...] She stated: [...] " [...] made me focus on something other than myself; it made me curious and hungry for new impressions and new motives for my photography. It's hard to pinpoint exactly how it affected my music, but all experiences are potentially inspiring for creativity. I didn't travel to write; I traveled to take pictures, which to me is an important part of the album. that emptiness is the place where things start to grow. Most of the universe is empty. So, I'm not <b>afraid</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> anymore." [...] She said the album is about how [...] "we are living in a time of great changes. Everything is moving so rapidly, sometimes violently, sometimes dauntingly. I think a lot of people experience anxiety these days. I wanted to address these emotions on the album." [...] She also cited American poet Robert Bly's 1980 anthology News of the Universe as one of the album's inspirations.|$|E
