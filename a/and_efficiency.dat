5|$|At {{the end of}} the 18thcentury {{the copper}} mining {{industry}} of North Wales centred around Parys Mountain declined, and the depression in the British copper market ended. As the price rose, the Cornish mines began to reopen. By this time, the Industrial Revolution had begun, bringing with it new attitudes towards organisation <b>and</b> <b>efficiency.</b> While the mine managers of the 18thcentury generally treated bal maidens as useful only for breaking and sorting ore, the managers of these new mines sought to use all their employees as efficiently as possible.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the {{application}} of finite-time heat-transfer theory to optimize ecologically the power output of an endoreversible and regenerative gas-turbine power-cycle for infinite thermal-capacitance rates {{to and from the}} reservoirs. The expressions for power, thermal <b>efficiency,</b> <b>and</b> exergetic <b>efficiency</b> corresponding to the maximum ecological function for the gas-turbine cycle are presented. The effects of regeneration and hot-cold temperature ratio on power, entropy-generation rate, thermal <b>efficiency</b> <b>and</b> exergetic <b>efficiency,</b> all at the maximum ecological function, are determined. It is shown that both the power output and entropy-generation rate are increased significantly by the use of regenerators, and increase monotonically with an increase with hot/cold temperature ratio. The results further indicate that the thermal <b>efficiency</b> <b>and</b> exergetic <b>efficiency</b> are decreased by the use of regenerators and rise with an increase in the temperature ratio. By the introduction of the ecological function, the improvements in exergetic <b>efficiency</b> <b>and</b> thermal <b>efficiency</b> are evident. ...|$|R

The PS3's high speed <b>and</b> <b>efficiency</b> introduced other opportunities for worthwhile optimizations according to Amdahl's law, and significantly changed the tradeoff between computing efficiency and overall accuracy, allowing the use of more complex molecular models at little added computing cost.

40|$|The main {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to establish the relationship between firm size <b>and</b> technical <b>efficiency</b> in East African manufacturing firms. This study used a two-step methodology to examine the relationships between technical <b>efficiency</b> <b>and</b> firm size in East African manufacturing firms. In the first step, technical efficiency measures were calculated using DEA approach. Secondly, using GLS technique, a technical efficiency equation was estimated to investigate whether technical efficiency is increasing in firm size. Contrary to our expectation, the results show ed a negative association between firm size <b>and</b> technical <b>efficiency</b> in both Ugandan and Tanzanian manufacturing firms. The existence of a positive association between size squared <b>and</b> technical <b>efficiency</b> <b>and</b> a negative association between firm size <b>and</b> technical <b>efficiency</b> in Ugandan <b>and</b> Tanzanian manufacturing firms suggests an inverted U- relationship between firm size <b>and</b> technical <b>efficiency</b> in these countries...|$|R
