2500|$|Neither critics nor {{the public}} responded enthusiastically, {{although}} Robert Osborne {{has stated that}} the film was a success when he hosted a telecast of it on Turner Classic Movies. Graham Greene wrote that he was [...] "less than ever convinced {{that there is an}} aesthetic justification for filming Shakespeare at all... the effect of even the best scenes is to distract." [...] Cinemagoers considered the film too [...] "arty", staying away as they had from Warner's <b>A</b> <b>Midsummer</b> <b>Night</b> Dream a year before: leading to Hollywood abandoning the Bard for over a decade. The film nevertheless received four Oscar nominations. Subsequent film versions would make use of less experienced, but more photogenic, actors in the central roles. Cukor, interviewed in 1970, said of his film: [...] "It's one picture that if I had to do over again, I'd know how. I'd get the garlic and the Mediterranean into it." ...|$|E

[...] I could not say more, though I should have liked to, as I saw that I only mystified her; for I had no wish to have it on my conscience that I might pass for having made love to her. Nothing less should I have seemed to do had I continued to beg a lady to [...] "believe in me" [...] in an Italian garden on <b>a</b> <b>midsummer</b> <b>night.</b> There was some merit in my scruples, for Miss Tita lingered and lingered: I perceived that she felt that she should not really soon come down again and wished therefore to protract the present. She insisted too on making the talk between us personal to ourselves; and altogether her behavior was such as would have been possible only to a completely innocent woman.|$|E
60|$|A {{great deal}} {{can happen in}} a week, and the seven days that {{followed}} that moonlight tête-à-tête seemed to Anna the fullest and the happiest she had ever known. She had never worked so hard in her life; for her new tutor gave her plenty to do, and she studied in secret to supply sundry deficiencies which she was too proud to confess. No more novels now; no more sentimental poetry, lounging in a hammock. She sat erect upon a hard rock and read Buckle, Mill, and Social Science Reports with a diligence that appalled the banished dawdlers who usually helped her kill time. There was early boating, vigorous horse exercise, and tramps over hill and dale, from which she returned dusty, brown, and tired, but as happy {{as if she had}} discovered something fairer and grander than wild flowers or the ocean in its changeful moods. There were afternoon concerts in the breezy drawing-rooms, when others were enjoying siestas, and Anna sang to her one listener as she had never sung before. But best of all were the moonlight séances among the roses; for there they interchanged interesting confidences and hovered about those dangerous but delightful topics that need the magic of <b>a</b> <b>midsummer</b> <b>night</b> to make the charm quite perfect.|$|E
6000|$|For eyes {{we have no}} {{models in}} the {{remotely}} antique. It might have been, too, that in these eyes of my beloved lay the secret to which Lord Verulam alludes. They were, I must believe, far larger than the ordinary eyes of our own race. They were even fuller than the fullest of the gazelle eyes of the tribe of the valley of Nourjahad. Yet it was only at intervals--in moments of intense excitement--that this peculiarity became more than slightly noticeable in Ligeia. And at such moments was her beauty--in my heated fancy thus it appeared perhaps--the beauty of beings either above or apart from the earth--the beauty of the fabulous Houri of the Turk. The hue of the orbs was the most brilliant of black, and, far over them, hung jetty lashes of great length. The brows, slightly irregular in outline, had the same tint. The [...] "strangeness," [...] however, which I found in the eyes, was of a nature distinct from the formation, or the color, or the brilliancy of the features, and must, after all, be referred to the expression. Ah, word of no meaning! behind whose vast latitude of mere sound we intrench our ignorance of {{so much of the}} spiritual. The expression of the eyes of Ligeia! How for long hours have I pondered upon it! How have I, through the whole of <b>a</b> <b>midsummer</b> <b>night,</b> struggled to fathom it! What was it--that something more profound than the well of Democritus--which lay far within the pupils of my beloved? What was it? I was possessed with a passion to discover. Those eyes! those large, those shining, those divine orbs! they became to me twin stars of Leda, and I to them devoutest of astrologers.|$|E
