Motor Drive 2 was introduced with the OM-4 and, in addition to <b>automatic</b> <b>film</b> advance (up to 5 frames per second), featured motorized film rewind. The camera accepted the Olympus 250-exposure bulk film back (10 meters of film = 250 frames) and the Olympus T-system flashes.

50|$|During the 1950s and 1960s the {{hospital}} dramatically continued {{to improve and}} expand its facilities. This included the provision of emergency lighting, a staff canteen and improvements to staff accommodation. Also a new Pharmacy, which allowed the overrun Outpatient and Casualty Department to be separated into two distinct departments. In 1963 saw the improvements and extensions to the theatre facilities and a new mortuary refrigeration unit was built. While in 1966 an <b>automatic</b> <b>film</b> processing unit {{was added to the}} X-ray Department.|$|R
5000|$|Most film-based point-and-shoots {{made after}} the late 1980s use 35mm film. In the 1980s, 35mm {{was seen as}} a [...] "professional" [...] format due to the {{relative}} difficulty of loading and rewinding the film versus cartridge based formats such as 110 or disc film. The key innovations that made 35mm point-and-shoot cameras possible were <b>automatic</b> <b>film</b> loading and <b>automatic</b> advance and rewind. Advanced Photo System film was mildly popular in the 1990s. 126 film was also popular during the 1970s.|$|R
50|$|A motor drive, in {{the field}} of photography, is a powered film {{transport}} mechanism. Historically, film loading, advancing, and rewinding were all manually driven functions. The desires of professional photographers for more efficient shooting, particularly in sports and wildlife photography, and the desires of amateur and novice photographers for easier to use cameras both drove the development of <b>automatic</b> <b>film</b> transport. Some early developments were made with clockwork drives, but most development {{in the field}} has been in the direction of electrically driven transport.|$|R

The FA can also utilize the Nikon MD-12 motor drive of the Nikon FM and Nikon FE series, but the unit will not provide power for the FA.|$|R
40|$|The {{composite}} films which {{consist of}} amorphous carbon, carbon nanotube, and iron nanoparticles were prepared by ethanol catalytic combustion in atmospheric environment. The as-prepared composite films have good electrocatalytic activity and high conductivity which {{is due to}} their particular structure. The efficiency of the composite films based dye-sensitized soar cells (DSSCs) is closed to that of the Pt based one. Most importantly, the DSSC employing the composite films presents a higher FF than those of Pt based solar cell. In addition, it is a simple method for mass production of composite <b>films</b> <b>counter</b> electrode (CE) which is expected to reduce the cost of fabricating DSSCs...|$|R
5000|$|The <b>film</b> <b>counter</b> was the {{countdown}} type, {{which would be}} manually set when film was loaded according to how many pairs the roll could take. The number 20 was in red and there were red marks at 15 and 28, for use with standard 20 and 36 exposure rolls of film. A properly loaded 24 exposure roll of film will give 18 stereo pairs, {{but there is no}} special marking as 24 exposure rolls of film were not standard at the time the camera was produced. Opposite the counter was another manually set dial which indicated whether the cameras was loaded with [...] "Daylight" [...] film or [...] "type A", though it had no film speed indicator.|$|R
40|$|Disfluent speech {{synthesis}} {{is necessary in}} some applications such as <b>automatic</b> <b>film</b> dubbing or spoken translation.

Prosody obtained by the application of standard techniques on these new sentences is used for the synthesis of the disfluent sentence. In addition, local modifications are applied to segmental units adjacent to disfluency elements. Experiments evidence that duration follows this behavior, what supports the feasibility of the model.

Application of negative voltage pulses on the probe relative to an Ag <b>film</b> <b>counter</b> electrode on an RbAg 4 I 5 sample induces nanometer-sized Ag deposition on the ion conductor around the probe. The patterned Ag particles are 0. 5 - 70 nm high and 20 - 700 nm in diameter.

30|$|High-efficient fibrous dye-sensitized {{solar cell}} with carbon {{nanotube}} (CNT) thin <b>films</b> as <b>counter</b> electrodes has been reported. The CNT films were fabricated by coating CNT paste or spraying CNT suspension solution on Ti wires. A fluorine tin oxide-coated CNT underlayer was used to improve the adherence of the CNT layer on Ti substrate for sprayed samples. The charge transfer catalytic behavior of fibrous CNT/Ti counter electrodes to the iodide/triiodide redox pair was carefully studied by electrochemical impedance and current-voltage measurement. The catalytic activity can be enhanced by {{increasing the amount of}} CNT loading on substrate. Both the efficiencies of fibrous {{dye-sensitized solar cell}}s using paste coated and sprayed CNT <b>films</b> as <b>counter</b> electrodes are comparative to that using Pt wires, indicating the feasibility of CNT/Ti wires as fibrous counter electrode for superseding Pt wires.|$|R
50|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{experiment}} was to obtain photographs of the lunar surface as the spacecraft flew by the Moon. The imaging system was designated Yenisey-2 and consisted of a dual-lens camera AFA-E1, an <b>automatic</b> <b>film</b> processing unit, and a scanner. The lenses on the camera were a 200 mm focal length, f/5.6 aperture objective and a 500 mm, f/9.5 objective. The camera carried 40 frames of temperature- and radiation-resistant 35 mm isochrome film. The 200 mm objective could image the full disk of the Moon and the 500 mm could take {{an image of a}} region on the surface. The camera was fixed in the spacecraft and pointing was achieved by rotating the craft itself.|$|R
