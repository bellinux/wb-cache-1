5|$|As Gingrich {{primed for}} another {{run in the}} 1978 elections, Flynt decided to retire. Gingrich {{defeated}} Democratic State Senator Virginia Shapard by 7,500 votes. Gingrich was re-elected six times from this district. He faced a close general election race once—in the House elections of 1990—when he won by 978 votes in <b>a</b> <b>race</b> <b>against</b> Democrat David Worley. Although the district was trending Republican at the national level, conservative Democrats continued to hold most local offices, {{as well as most}} of the area's seats in the General Assembly, well into the 1980s.|$|E

She forces Jack aboard the Queen Anne's Revenge, a ship captained by the infamous pirate Blackbeard, Angelica's father. Both are also {{in search of the}} Fountain; Angelica to save her father's soul, Blackbeard to escape a prophecy of his demise {{at the hands of a}} one-legged man.

5|$|F-Zero GX is {{the first}} F-Zero game to feature a Story mode. Its story has the player {{assume the role of}} F-Zero pilot Captain Falcon in nine {{chapters}} of various racing scenarios; such as Falcon's training regiment, <b>a</b> <b>race</b> <b>against</b> a rival through a canyon with falling boulders, attack and eliminate a rival's gang, and escape from a collapsing building through closing blast doors. Each chapter can be completed on a normal, hard, and very hard difficulty setting. Toshihiro Nagoshi, one of the game's co-producers, stated that this mode was included because the development team felt that the F-Zero universe was unique and they wanted to explain some of the characters' motivations and flesh out the game world.|$|E

5|$|Plutonium was {{delivered}} to Los Alamos {{in the form of}} what was found to be a mixture of plutonium trifluoride (PuF3) and plutonium tetrafluoride (PuF4). Work with plutonium was carried out in gloveboxes for safety reasons. The metallurgists figured out how to purify the plutonium, and found that heating it to 250° allowed them to work it in the malleable γ phase. It was also found that alloying it with 3 percent gallium would stabilize it in the δ phase. When plutonium at last began to arrive in quantity from the Hanford Site in February 1945, they were ready for production. In <b>a</b> <b>race</b> <b>against</b> the clock, the metallurgists produced plutonium spheres for the Trinity nuclear test by July 23, 1945.|$|E
5|$|This {{one-shot}} {{issue was}} published in March 1993. The story was originally published in graphic-novel form in 1991 as Avengers-Deathtrap: The Vault (1991), but was later reprinted under the Venom label. As a result, the fictional events precede those of Venom: Lethal Protector and are referenced in that series. The issue follows a supervillain prison outbreak at The Vault, led by Brock, that allows the inmates to overrun the prison and take its staff hostage. The Avengers and Freedom Force attempt to defeat the villains in <b>a</b> <b>race</b> <b>against</b> time because the prison's final fail-safe, a powerful explosive device, has been activated by Vault warden Truman Marsh. DCD estimated that the comic was their 13th-bestselling trade paperback of 1993.|$|E
5|$|William S. Grattan sat boarded-up for {{eighteen}} months while city and fire department officials {{decided whether to}} replace her {{at a cost of}} $225,000 dollars or rebuild her for $99,000 dollars, which was $8,000 dollars more than her original cost. The decision was made to rebuild and in 1930 she was rebuilt at the Buffalo Dry Dock Company of Buffalo, New York. During this refit some improvements were made to William S. Grattan. One improvement was that her boilers were converted from burning coal to burning oil. The engines were rebuilt and her firefighting system was updated and could now handle foam fire retardant. Also, the pilot house was raised to the upper boat deck level and a fixed turret tower with a fire monitor was constructed on the stern of the ship. A fourth fire monitor was added {{to the top of the}} pilot house of the ship as well. As part of her acceptance ceremony she participated in <b>a</b> <b>race</b> <b>against</b> the harbor tug Kentucky, which was considered to be one of the fastest tugs on the Great Lakes.|$|E

5|$|Cerny and Flanagan first {{collaborated on}} a video game based on Michael Jackson's Thriller. The project was {{canceled}} and the two began working on an idea of Cerny's that eventually became Marble Madness. Development lasted 10months. Following the North American video game crash of 1983, video game development within Atari focused on providing a distinctive experience {{through the use of}} a unique control system and by emphasizing a simultaneous two-player mode. Cerny designed Marble Madness in accordance with these company goals. He was first inspired by miniature golf and captivated by the idea that a play field's contours influenced the ball's path. Cerny began testing various ideas using Atari's digital art system. After deciding to use an isometric grid, Cerny began developing the game's concept. His initial idea involved hitting a ball in a way similar to miniature golf, but Atari was unenthusiastic. Cerny next thought of racing games and planned for races on long tracks against an opponent. Technology limitations at the time were unable to handle the in-game physics necessary for the idea, and Cerny switched the game's objective to <b>a</b> <b>race</b> <b>against</b> time.|$|E
25|$|The SS City of Erie was a sidewheeler {{steamboat}} on Lake Erie. It {{was famous}} for {{being one of the}} fastest ships on the Great Lakes, at the time. It also won <b>a</b> <b>race</b> <b>against</b> a newer, rival ship.|$|E

Moon went to lose the election.|$|R

25|$|On {{a lighter}} note, in 1930 Edge {{agreed to take}} part in <b>a</b> <b>race</b> <b>against</b> some homing pigeons {{released}} from the Palace of Westminster by Ibstock Homing Association. He raced by motor-car and rail, but his train was delayed and got in late at Leicester, causing Edge to arrive two minutes after the pigeons, so losing the race.|$|E
25|$|Lily {{tells the}} family she is leaving Limerick House. She really makes {{off with the}} mirror, in 1867; Ned Kelly steals Constance's.

25|$|India {{lost two}} early wickets of Sourav Ganguly (lbw) and Karthik (caught) meaning that {{any chance of}} an Indian victory disappeared. Weather {{forecasts}} had predicted rain and it became <b>a</b> <b>race</b> <b>against</b> time for England to win the match before rain arrived while India would have to hold out for a draw. VVS Laxman and Dhoni produced a stand of 86 runs before Laxman was bowled by Tremlett.|$|E

25|$|A team {{time trial}} (TTT) is <b>a</b> <b>race</b> <b>against</b> {{the clock in}} which each team rides alone. The time {{is that of the}} fifth rider of each team: riders more than a bike-length behind their team's fifth rider are awarded their own times. The TTT has been criticised for favouring strong teams and handicapping strong riders in weak teams. The prologue stage in 1971 was a team time trial.|$|E
25|$|Now {{that all}} seemed lost, the West Indian fielding, which until now had been fallible in both innings, reached the heights. Three {{of the last}} four batsmen were run out in what had by now become <b>a</b> <b>race</b> <b>against</b> time. First Benaud called for a sharp single, but Solomon hit the stumps from mid-wicket to dismiss Davidson, who had had a {{magnificent}} match (124 runs and 11 wickets).|$|E
25|$|Adopt-A-Safta (“Adopt-A-Grandmother”) is an {{organization}} that pairs young volunteers with lonely Holocaust Survivors following the Big Brother/Big Sister model. The connection provides the Survivors with a “family” connection and personal warmth that may be missing from their lives as they age. According to the Foundation for the Benefit of Holocaust Victims, simple loneliness is the chief complaint of Holocaust Survivors in Israel, and that 35 Survivors die every day, so the efforts of Adopt-A-Safta are ultimately <b>a</b> <b>race</b> <b>against</b> time.|$|E
