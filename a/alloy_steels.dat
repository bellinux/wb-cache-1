5|$|Mild steel corrodes {{more readily}} than wrought iron, but is cheaper and more widely available. Carbon steel {{contains}} 2.0% carbon or less, with small amounts of manganese, sulfur, phosphorus, and silicon. <b>Alloy</b> <b>steels</b> contain varying amounts of carbon {{as well as other}} metals, such as chromium, vanadium, molybdenum, nickel, tungsten, etc. Their alloy content raises their cost, and so they are usually only employed for specialist uses. One common alloy steel, though, is stainless steel. Recent developments in ferrous metallurgy have produced a growing range of microalloyed steels, also termed 'HSLA' or high-strength, low <b>alloy</b> <b>steels,</b> containing tiny additions to produce high strengths and often spectacular toughness at minimal cost.|$|E
5|$|Alternatively {{pig iron}} {{may be made}} into steel (with up to about 2% carbon) or wrought iron (commercially pure iron). Various {{processes}} {{have been used for}} this, including finery forges, puddling furnaces, Bessemer converters, open hearth furnaces, basic oxygen furnaces, and electric arc furnaces. In all cases, the objective is to oxidize {{some or all of the}} carbon, together with other impurities. On the other hand, other metals may be added to make <b>alloy</b> <b>steels.</b>|$|E
5|$|Niobium is an {{effective}} microalloying element for steel, within which it forms niobium carbide and niobium nitride. These compounds improve the grain refining, and retard recrystallization and precipitation hardening. These effects in turn increase the toughness, strength, formability, and weldability. Within microalloyed stainless steels, the niobium content is a small (less than 0.1%) but important addition to high strength low <b>alloy</b> <b>steels</b> that are widely used structurally in modern automobiles.|$|E

Combined steel to can fix the ability of tensile strength the steel. In this research, combine carbon steel with copper. Copper <b>alloy</b> <b>steel</b> expected to increase the tensile strength of the steel. In this research we use sample with the non <b>alloy</b> <b>steel</b> (TP), <b>alloy</b> <b>steel</b> with 0, 5 % copper alloy (FeCu- 5), and <b>alloy</b> <b>steel</b> with 1, 0 % copper alloy (FeCu- 10), testing that will do in the form of composition testing, hardness testing, and tensile testing.

50|$|Hole opener arms have {{to sustain}} heavy loads during {{operations}} and are generally made of high-grade <b>alloy</b> <b>steel,</b> welded onto a solid <b>alloy</b> <b>steel</b> body. Some designs feature replaceable arms, allowing for size changes but decreasing overall robustness.|$|R
5|$|The {{equipment}} is relatively inexpensive and simple, generally employing the combustion of acetylene in oxygen {{to produce a}} welding flame temperature of about 3100°C. The flame, since it is less concentrated than an electric arc, causes slower weld cooling, {{which can lead to}} greater residual stresses and weld distortion, though it eases the welding of high <b>alloy</b> <b>steels.</b> A similar process, generally called oxyfuel cutting, is used to cut metals.|$|E
5|$|The most {{important}} material properties for the dies are thermal shock resistance and softening at elevated temperature; other important properties include hardenability, machinability, heat checking resistance, weldability, availability (especially for larger dies), and cost. The longevity of a die is directly {{dependent on the}} temperature of the molten metal and the cycle time. The dies used in die casting are usually made out of hardened tool steels, because cast iron cannot withstand the high pressures involved, therefore the dies are very expensive, resulting in high start-up costs. Metals that are cast at higher temperatures require dies made from higher <b>alloy</b> <b>steels.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{composition}} of the electrode core is generally similar and sometimes identical {{to that of the}} base material. But even though a number of feasible options exist, a slight difference in alloy composition can strongly impact the properties of the resulting weld. This is especially true of <b>alloy</b> <b>steels</b> such as HSLA steels. Likewise, electrodes of compositions {{similar to those of the}} base materials are often used for welding nonferrous materials like aluminium and copper. However, sometimes it is desirable to use electrodes with core materials significantly different from the base material. For example, stainless steel electrodes are sometimes used to weld two pieces of carbon steel, and are often utilized to weld stainless steel workpieces with carbon steel workpieces.|$|E

5|$|Iron metal {{has been}} used since ancient times, {{although}} copper alloys, which have lower melting temperatures, were used even earlier in human history. Pure iron is relatively soft, but is unobtainable by smelting because it is significantly hardened and strengthened by impurities, in particular carbon, from the smelting process. A certain proportion of carbon (between 0.002% and 2.1%) produces steel, which may be up to 1000times harder than pure iron. Crude iron metal is produced in blast furnaces, where ore is reduced by coke to pig iron, which has a high carbon content. Further refinement with oxygen reduces the carbon content to the correct proportion to make steel. Steels and iron alloys formed with other metals (<b>alloy</b> <b>steels)</b> {{are by far the}} most common industrial metals because they have a great range of desirable properties and iron-bearing rock is abundant.|$|E
5|$|Nickel {{is one of}} four {{elements}} (iron, cobalt, nickel, and gadolinium) {{that are}} ferromagnetic at approximately room temperature. Alnico permanent magnets based partly on nickel are of intermediate strength between iron-based permanent magnets and rare-earth magnets. The metal is valuable in modern times chiefly in alloys; about 68% of world production is used in stainless steel. A further 10% is used for nickel-based and copper-based alloys, 7% for <b>alloy</b> <b>steels,</b> 3% in foundries, 9% in plating and 4% in other applications, including the fast-growing battery sector. As a compound, nickel has a number of niche chemical manufacturing uses, such as a catalyst for hydrogenation, cathodes for batteries, pigments and metal surface treatments. Nickel is an essential nutrient for some microorganisms and plants that have enzymes with nickel as an active site.|$|E
25|$|Both {{carbon and}} <b>alloy</b> <b>steels</b> are {{suitable}} for case-hardening; typically mild steels are used, with low carbon content, usually less than 0.3% (see plain-carbon steel for more information). These mild steels are not normally hardenable due to the low quantity of carbon, so {{the surface of the}} steel is chemically altered to increase the hardenability. Case-hardened steel is formed by diffusing carbon (carburization), nitrogen (nitriding) and/or boron (boriding) into the outer layer of the steel at high temperature, and then heat treating the surface layer to the desired hardness.|$|E

40|$|Corrosion {{behaviour}} of {{cast iron}} and low <b>alloy</b> <b>steel</b> in cocoa liquor and well water was investigated. The average weight losses of the specimens were measured using digital weighing balance. The {{results showed that the}} weight losses of both cast iron and low <b>alloy</b> <b>steel</b> in both media increases with time. Corrosion rate {{of cast iron}} in cocoa liquor in-creases rapidly with time for up to 336 hours (1000 µm/yr), but in well water the rapid rate of corrosion only lasted up to 187 hours (1160 µm/yr) thereafter it continuously dropping until 264 hours (667 µm/yr) after which it remains con-stant. Low <b>alloy</b> <b>steel</b> corroded faster in cocoa liquor up to 264 hours (200 µm/yr), whereas the initial rapid corrosion rate only lasted up to 168 hours (180 µm/yr) in well water environment. The results revealed that low <b>alloy</b> <b>steel</b> exhib-ited better corrosion resistance in both media, with cocoa liquor been more aggressive.

500|$|For GTAW {{of carbon}} and {{stainless}} steels, {{the selection of}} a filler material is important to prevent excessive porosity. Oxides on the filler material and workpieces must be removed before welding to prevent contamination, and immediately prior to welding, alcohol or acetone should be used to clean the surface. Preheating is generally not necessary for mild steels less than one inch thick, but low <b>alloy</b> <b>steels</b> may require preheating to slow the cooling process and prevent the formation of martensite in the heat-affected zone. [...] Tool steels should also be preheated to prevent cracking in the heat-affected zone. Austenitic stainless steels do not require preheating, but martensitic and ferritic chromium stainless steels do.
