40|$|AbstractThe article {{presents}} the results of measurements and developed on their basis sorption isotherms with mathematical description of the graphs obtained. The research was conducted on samples of three kinds of autoclaved <b>aerated</b> <b>concretes</b> with similar bulk density of approximately 600 kg/m 3, but provided by different manufacturers. The tested concretes were also different by composition of raw materials. One of the examined concretes had fly ash in its composition. The moisture sorption studies were conducted at temperature 25 oC and at six relative humidity levels φ ≈ 11, 33, 53, 75, 84, 97 %. The levels of temperature and relative humidity conditions correspond to a typical temperature/humidity conditions in which in practice commonly used autoclaved <b>aerated</b> <b>concretes</b> can be found. The moisture sorption content was obtained after several months of measurements at the equilibrium state. This data was then used to prepare sorption isotherms of the tested materials. The experimentally obtained data were then applied to calculate mathematical description of graphs. For this purpose three commonly known and used equations were applied: equation of Chen Y. and Chen Z., equation of Jovanovič’s for multi-layer adsorption, and Hüttig's equation. Using statistical methods the compliance of the adsorption isotherm equations was compared with experimental data. For that purpose the STATISTICA programme was used. To estimate the coefficients of the equations the authors used one of the programme modules, i. e. the non-linear estimation. To assess how well the data fit a statistical model the coefficient of determination R 2 was used...|$|R
40|$|The main {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to evaluate the use of construction and demolition waste (CDW) from the Passo Fundo region of Rio Grande do Sul (RS), Brazil, in the development of <b>aerated</b> foamed <b>concrete.</b> This waste had not yet been characterized or even reused. CDW was processed (sieved only), characterized, and used as an aggregate, completely substituting natural sand. The influence of CDW granulometry and the amount of foam upon compressive strength, wet and dry bulk density, water absorption, and the air voids of concrete blocks were determined. Results showed that CDW has regular characteristics for the development of <b>aerated</b> foamed <b>concrete.</b> Compressive strength and density decreased as the amount of foam increased, while water absorption and air voids also increased. Also, CDW that was classified as coarse showed higher compressive strength. On average, CDW medium-sized particles had a higher air void content, while water absorption showed little variation with respect to granulometry. CDW residue from the region of study can be used as aggregate for the development of <b>aerated</b> foamed <b>concrete.</b> However, it must characterized before being used to guarantee the quality of the final product...|$|R

50|$|Originally Ytong {{autoclaved}} <b>aerated</b> <b>concrete</b> in Sweden {{was produced}} with alum shale, whose combustible carbon content was beneficial {{in the production}} process. Unfortunately, the slate deposits used for Ytong in Sweden also contain a very low level of natural uranium, which makes the material give off radioactive radon gas in the building. In 1972, the Swedish Radiation Safety Authority pointed out the unsuitability of a radon-emitting construction material, {{and the use of}} alum slate in the production of Ytong ceased in 1975. By using new formulations, containing only quartz sand, calcined gypsum, lime (mineral), cement, water and aluminum powder, Ytong produced a new type of <b>aerated</b> <b>concrete</b> which no longer contains alum slate and thus has eliminated the problem of radon exposure from this raw material. The production of this white autoclaved <b>aerated</b> <b>concrete</b> is now state of the art and similar formulations are used by all producers around the world.|$|E

40|$|Concrete is a {{well known}} and {{understood}} product used extensively in the building and construction industry however there are ecological drawbacks associated with its use. Geopolymer concrete has been presented as a comparatively environmentally friendly alternative; replacing traditional aggregate with an alumino-silicate material (i. e. fly-ash) and the traditional OPC (ordinary Portland cement) binder with an alkaline solution. Preliminary research performed by HALOK identified deficiencies in the existing mixing techniques and suggested that a high-shear mixer may significantly improve the mechanical strength characteristics of <b>aerated</b> geopolymer <b>concrete.</b> This study involves {{the development of a}} conceptual high-shear mixer suitable for the preparation of <b>aerated</b> geopolymer <b>concrete</b> samples. ANSYS-CFX computational fluid dynamics (CFD) software has been used in conjunction with Solidworks 3 D modelling software to model the behaviour of the tradition „paddle mixer‟ and proposed high-shear mixer, to permit a comparison between the two, and ultimately verify the validity of the concept. The conceptual mixer utilises a rotor-stator arrangement to impart the required shear into the fluid and develop sufficient pressure to promote recirculation of the fluid. Also key to the performance of the mixer is a fly-ash injection system, which is intended to permit greater control over the water/solid ratio of the paste, without compromising workability. Modelling techniques employed to conduct the steady state analyses include multiple frame of reference and multiphase analysis. Variables used in assessing the suitability of the high-shear mixer include velocity, pressure and shear strain rate. Results from the CFD analysis conducted indicate a significant increase in average shear strain rate compared to the traditional „paddle‟ style mixer. This is expected to result the mixer being able to produce a more homogenous geopolymer paste, ultimately resulting in an increase in strength of <b>aerated</b> geopolymer <b>concrete.</b> ...|$|R

40|$|Uncontrolled dumping of {{palm oil}} fuel ash (POFA) not only {{occupies}} valuable land but also creates environmental pollution and health hazard. These {{problems can be}} reduced to large extent by using POFA in concrete. A number of research works have been carried out to investigate the potential of POFA for use as a supplementary cementing material in normal, high strength, high performance, and <b>aerated</b> <b>concretes.</b> This paper presents a review on the use of POFA in different types of concrete. It firstly discusses the physical and chemical properties of POFA. Then the emphasis has been given on the effects of POFA on the fresh and hardened properties, and durability of concrete. This paper shows that both ground and unground POFA increase the water demand and thus decrease the workability of concrete. However, ground POFA has shown a good potential for improving the hardened properties and durability of concrete due to its satisfactory micro-filling ability and pozzolanic activity. In addition to discussing the benefits of POFA, this study has identified certain gaps in the present state of knowledge on POFA concrete, and listed several research needs for future investigation.

40|$|Cellular {{concrete}} {{takes the}} lead in the world of construction as a structural insulation material used in the construction and reconstruction of buildings and constructions of various purposes. In this artificial stone building material, pores are distributed relatively evenly and occupy from 20 to 90 % of the concrete volume, ensuring good thermal qualities, which allows cellular concrete houses to keep warmth well. For production of cellular concrete, Portland cement, “burnt lime”, and fine-pulverized blast furnace slags, with a hardening activator are used as binders. As silica components, quartz sand or “fly ash” obtained by combustion of pulverized fuel in power plants as well as secondary products of different ore dressing treatments are used. The low density and high thermal insulation properties of cellular concrete enables 3 times lighter wall weight than the weight of brick walls and 1. 7 times lighter than the walls of ceramsite concrete. Thermal insulation and mechanical properties of cellular concrete make possible to construct of it single-layer protecting structures with the desired thermal resistance. Cellular concrete is divided into <b>aerated</b> <b>concretes</b> and foam concretes, whose physical/mechanical and operational performance is, ceteris paribus, almost identical.
