In this way, the Big Boards anticipated the DIY PC clones that became popular later. In its most popular form, the fully assembled and tested Big Board need only be connected to a power supply, one or two eight inch floppy disk drives, a composite monitor, and an <b>ASCII</b> encoded <b>keyboard</b> in order to provide a fully functioning system. A serial terminal could be used in place of the monitor and keyboard, further simplifying assembly. The only tool required for basic assembly was a screwdriver for the terminal block power connections.|$|R
40|$|Abstract—Password {{authentication}} remains ubiquitous on the web, {{primarily because}} of its low cost and compatibility with any device which allows a user to input text. Yet text is not universal. Computers must use a character encoding system to convert human-comprehensible writing into bits. We examine {{for the first time}} the lingering effects of character encoding on the password ecosystem. We report a number of bugs at large websites which reveal that non-ASCII passwords are often poorly supported, even by websites otherwise correctly supporting the recommended Unicode/UTF- 8 character encoding system. We also study user behaviour through several leaked data sets of passwords chosen by English, Chinese, Hebrew and Spanish speakers as case studies. Our findings suggest that most users still actively avoid using characters outside of the original ASCII character set even when allowed to. Coping strategies include transliterating non-ASCII passwords using <b>ASCII,</b> changing <b>keyboard</b> mappings to produce nonsense ASCII passwords, and using passwords consisting entirely of numbers or of a geometric pattern on the keyboard. These last two strategies may reduce resistance to guessing attacks for passwords chosen by non-English speakers. I...|$|R

Its dimensions were 22 x 28 cm, and it had a RCA 1802 processor; along with a crystal clock operating at 1.76 MHz (3.521280 MHz divided by 2). It had 2 KB (2048 bytes) of RAM, which could be expanded to 4 KB on board, and 32 KB via an expansion slot. Its 5V DC CDP18S023 power supply had an output of 600 mA.

5000|$|The phrase regular {{expressions}} (and consequently, regexes) {{is often}} used to mean the specific, standard textual syntax (distinct from the mathematical notation described below) for representing patterns that matching text need to conform to. Each character in a regular expression (that is, each character in the string describing its pattern) is understood to be a metacharacter (with its special meaning), or a regular character (with its literal meaning). For example, in the regex [...] a is a literal character which matches just 'a' and [...] is a meta character which matches every character except a newline. Therefore, this regex would match for example 'a ' or 'ax' or 'a0'. Together, metacharacters and literal characters can be used to identify textual material of a given pattern, or process a number of instances of it. Pattern-matches can vary from a precise equality to a very general similarity (controlled by the metacharacters). For example, [...] is a very general pattern, [...] (match all letters from 'a' to 'z') is less general and [...] is a precise pattern (match just 'a'). The metacharacter syntax is designed specifically to represent prescribed targets in a concise and flexible way to direct the automation of text processing of a variety of input data, in a form easy to type using a standard <b>ASCII</b> <b>keyboard.</b>|$|E

A few works {{has been done on}} this topics but no standard is set up yet to sort Bengali words. Some of these works are based on ASCII representation. To use <b>ASCII,</b> <b>keyboard</b> mapping is important because it is different for each country where the Unicode representation is fixed for all characters of various countries. So, Unicode representation is much more preferable than ASCII representation. In this paper we have discussed about an easy way to sort the Unicode Bengali texts.

40|$|The {{main goal}} of this {{presentation}} is to suggest an inductive {{way of looking at}} the idea of cultural difference in a technological environment. The proposal has three characteristics 1) it blurs the gap between natural sciences and human/social sciences, 2) it is extremely simple and down-to-earth, 3) the data that illustrates the method comes from recent field research in China (August 2008) in the realm of technology studies. The broader theoretical framework is provided by recent advances in the field of Science and technology studies (STS). In short, the method consists of first putting aside all differences between all scientific disciplines, and imagining that the world is made of “containers” in which certain amounts of “elements” are being stored. For example, one can consider, say, a Chinese scientist, as a container filled with Chinese characters, certain customs and habits, but also flesh and bones, food that has just been absorbed, etc. A computer <b>ASCII</b> <b>keyboard,</b> is a container filled with Roman alphabet letters, plastic buttons, wires, gray paintings, a flat panel, etc. The interest of the “container” inductive approach is that it allows us to temporarily forget the impossible task of defining “culture” and also differences between living beings and objects, or, for example, physics and arts...|$|E
