The natural tannins found in grapes are known as proanthocyanidins due to their ability to release red anthocyanin pigments when they are heated in an acidic solution. Grape extracts are mainly rich in monomers and small oligomers (mean degree of polymerization <8). Grape seed extracts contain three monomers (catechin, epicatechin and epicatechin gallate) and procyanidin oligomers. Grape skin extracts contain four monomers (catechin, epicatechin, gallocatechin and epigallocatechin), as well as procyanidins and prodelphinidins oligomers. The tannins are formed by enzymes during metabolic processes of the grapevine. The amount of tannins found naturally in grapes varies depending on the variety with Cabernet Sauvignon, Nebbiolo, Syrah and Tannat being 4 of the most tannic grape varieties. The reaction of tannins and anthocyanins with the phenolic compound catechins creates another class of tannins known as pigmented tannins which influence the color of red wine. Commercial preparations of tannins, known as enological tannins, made from oak wood, grape seed and skin, plant gall, chestnut, quebracho, gambier and myrobalan fruits, can be added at different stages of the wine production to improve color durability. The tannins derived from oak influence are known as [...] "hydrolysable tannins" [...] being created from the ellagic and gallic acid found in the wood.|$|E

The tannins derived from oak influence are known as [...] "hydrolysable tannins" [...] being created from the ellagic and gallic acid found in the wood.In the vineyards, there is also a growing distinction being made between [...] "ripe" [...] and [...] "unripe" [...] tannins present in the grape. This [...] "physiological ripeness", which is roughly determined by tasting the grapes off the vines, is being used along with sugar levels as a determination of when to harvest. The idea is that [...] "riper" [...] tannins will taste softer but still impart some of the texture components found favorable in wine. In winemaking, the amount of the time that the must spends in contact with the grape skins, stems and seeds will influence the amount of tannins that are present in the wine with wines subjected to longer maceration period having more tannin extract. Following harvest, stems are normally picked out and discarded prior to fermentation but some winemakers may intentionally leave in a few stems for varieties low in tannins (like Pinot noir) in order to increase the tannic extract in the wine. If there is an excess in the amount of tannins in the wine, winemakers can use various fining agents like albumin, casein and gelatin that can bind to tannins molecule and precipitate them out as sediments. As a wine ages, tannins will form long polymerized chains which come across to a taster as [...] "softer" [...] and less tannic. This process can be accelerated by exposing the wine to oxygen, which oxidize tannins to quinone-like compounds that are polymerization-prone. The winemaking technique of micro-oxygenation and decanting wine use oxygen to partially mimic the effect of aging on tannins.|$|E

The silages were made from the first cut of signal grass harvested at 50 days. Four treatment silages were TA: grass ensiled without tannin as control, AM: grass ensiled with A. mangium (6 g tannin /kg fresh weight), PA: grass ensiled with P. americana (6 g tannin /kg fresh weight), and PG: grass ensiled with P. guajava (6 g tannin/kg fresh weight). After mixing, the materials were packed into glass bottle silos (225 g capacity), in triplicate, which were ensiled for 30 days. The results showed that dry matter, organic matter and crude protein concentrations in signal grass silage mixed with tannin of A. mangium were higher (P< 0. 01) compared to other silages. Degradations of dry matter, organic matter and crude protein during ensiling were the lowest in silage with A. mangium tannin additive. This data was supported by good fermentation quality of that silage e. g. low pH value, NH 3 -N and VFA concentrations, and high lactic acid concentration and Fleigh point as compared to other silages. It is concluded that <b>addition</b> <b>of</b> <b>tannin</b> from A. mangium leaf at rate of 6 g/kg fresh weight improved fermentation quality and has potential as protein protection agents during the ensilage of signal grass. ...|$|E
40|$|The <b>addition</b> <b>of</b> {{exogenous}} <b>tannins</b> {{has become}} a common practice in cool climate winemaking to increase tannin content in hybrid red wines. These additions, when made at recommended rates and times, often result in low tannin retention. Previous {{research has shown that}} various phenolic compounds have a mixed effect on lactic acid bacteria (LAB) growth and malolactic fermentation (MLF) success. This study examined the effect <b>of</b> exogenous <b>tannin</b> <b>additions</b> above recommended rates on two strains of LAB during MLF in hybrid sp. Corot noir, Noiret, and Marquette cultivars. A mixed effects model was used to determine the interactions <b>of</b> LAB and <b>tannin</b> <b>additions</b> on MLF, independently and together. In all cultivars there were interaction effects, varying among cultivars, indicating that LAB strain selection and tannin additions have an effect on MLF. Despite these effects, all lots finished MLF in two weeks or less, suggesting that the <b>addition</b> <b>of</b> the exogenous <b>tannins</b> studied may not impact completion of MLF when other conditions are optimal. Further, little research has been performed on the timing <b>of</b> exogenous <b>tannin</b> <b>additions</b> in hybrid red wine. In 2013, wines were made from Maréchal Foch, Corot noir, and Cabernet Franc to compare the retention <b>of</b> exogenous <b>tannins</b> in interspecific hybrids and Vitis vinifera. In each cultivar a commercial exogenous tannin product containing [ALMOST EQUAL TO] 38 % condensed tannin was added at a rate <b>of</b> 800 mg/L. <b>Additions</b> were made at each major processing step for a total <b>of</b> 3 <b>additions</b> treatments during the winemaking process. To determine the fate <b>of</b> <b>tannins</b> in each wine, a mass balance was performed tracking the loss and gain in tannin. With later additions, there was a progressive increase in retention for all cultivars, suggesting that adding tannin after alcoholic fermentation reduces the portion lost. Mass balance calculations also showed that 5 - 10 times more tannin was lost in the lees between post alcoholic fermentation (AF) and post malolactic fermentation (MLF) samples than following MLF through eight months of aging. This suggests that in the hybrid red cultivars studied, later <b>additions</b> <b>of</b> exogenous <b>tannin</b> increase condensed tannin retention to levels comparable to that in V. vinifera. The recommend dosage for exogenous <b>tannins</b> <b>of</b> 50 - 500 mg/L may not effectively increase condensed tannins. In 2013, wines were made from Maréchal Foch, Corot noir, and Cabernet Franc to compare the retention <b>of</b> exogenous <b>tannins</b> in interspecific hybrids and Vitis vinifera. After analyzing 12 commercial tannin products for condensed tannin concentration via HPLC, the highest, with a concentration 38 %, was added at a rate of 400, 800, and 1200 mg/L after crush/before yeast inoculation. A separate portion of each cultivar was pressed off the skins immediately, fermented with 1600 mg/L <b>of</b> exogenous <b>tannin,</b> then back-blended postfermentation with a control wine for a final theoretical concentration <b>of</b> 400 mg/L <b>tannin</b> <b>addition.</b> At bottling, tannin concentrations in all treatments were higher than the respective control, but none exceeded 50 % retention. This suggests that high concentration <b>additions</b> <b>of</b> exogenous <b>tannin</b> increase the condensed tannins in hybrid red wines, but retention rates vary by cultivar. 2020 - 08 - 1...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT Two {{experiments}} {{were designed to}} study the effects <b>of</b> the <b>tannins</b> in rape-seed meal (RSM) on the nutritive value of this feedstuff for chicks. In the first experiment tannins were extracted from RSM and the metabolizable energy (ME) content of the resulting meal was compared against that of the unextracted RSM. The extracted tannins were added to a soybean meal (SBM) containing diet and the ME content of this diet was {{compared with that of}} the same diet without added tannins. Results showed that removing the tannins from RSM significantly increased the ME value of the RSM for chicks from 1, 171 to 1, 844 kcal. per kg. and from 1, 253 to 1, 766 kcal. per kg. when the determinations were done at 2 weeks and 6 weeks <b>of</b> age respectively. <b>Addition</b> <b>of</b> <b>tannins</b> extracted from RSM to SBM resulted in a reduction in its ME value. In the second experiment, the effect <b>of</b> <b>tannins</b> in RSM on the absorbability of protein by chicks was determined by using regular and tannin-free RSM at the 30 % level in rations containing SBM and as the sole source of supplementary protein.

40|$|During {{manufacturing}} and in use fiber composites emit voltatile organic compounds (VOC). Many factors {{can affect the}} emission such as the raw materials used (fibers, polymer, additives), the pulping process applied for pulp production and aging conditions. The work presented deals with emission of VOC from wood fibers as well as medium density fiberboards (MDF) made therefrom. Moreover, the emission from hemp fibers and composites made therefrom was also assessed. The results reveal that the chemical composition of VOC and their amounts depend highly on the raw material (pine wood and hemp straw) used {{as well as on}} the pulping process (thermo-mechanical process (TMP) and chemo-thermo-mechanical process (CTMP)) and pulping conditions applied. The objective of further work was to reduce the amount of VOC through adding highly reactive polyphenolic polymers such as condensed tannins during wood and hemp straw pulping. The results indicate that <b>addition</b> <b>of</b> <b>tannins</b> in the CTMP process improves the mechanical properties of the medium density fiberboards and lower theit emission.

40|$|One of {{the major}} host-defense {{functions}} of alveolar macrophages is the phagocytosis and clearance of inhaled particles deposited in the lower airways and alveolar spaces. Recent {{studies have indicated that}} the condensed tannins present in cotton mill dust stimulate the secretion of neutrophil chemotactic factor and arachidonic acid from resident rabbit alveolar macrophages and that these responses may contribute to the acute pulmonary inflammatory reaction associated with byssinosis. To characterize further the effect of tannin on macrophage function, the ability of tannin to modulate alveolar macrophage spreading and phagocytosis in vitro was examined. Tannin caused a dose-dependent inhibition of alveolar macrophage spreading with nearly complete inhibition occurring at concentrations of 12. 5 micrograms/ml. This inhibitory effect of tannin was not reversed with removal of tannin. Furthermore <b>addition</b> <b>of</b> <b>tannin</b> to previously spread macrophages actively caused the macrophages to round up. Examination of the structure of alveolar macrophages exposed to tannin by scanning and transmission electron microscopy revealed blebs {{on the surface of the}} cells and the loss of most of the cellular organelle structure, as compared to control macrophages. Tannin also modulated the ability of the alveolar macrophages to phagocytize unopsonized latex microspheres. The effect of tannin was biphasic. At the lowest concentration examined (3 micrograms/ml), tannin significantly enhanced phagocytosis of the latex microspheres. However, as the concentration was increased, phagocytosis decreased almost exponentially until at 50 micrograms/ml phagocytosis was significantly inhibited compared to control macrophages. These data indicate that tannin present in inhaled cotton mill dust could significantly decrease the ability of resident alveolar macrophages to phagocytize and thereby clear inhaled dust particles. This inhibitory effect would increase the time that particles remain exposed in the lower airway and alveolar spaces and thereby increase the time that potentially toxic compounds in the dust have to exert their biologic effect. This inhibition of macrophage function may therefore contribute to the pathogenesis of byssinosis...|$|E
40|$|Fractions {{from white}} and tannin sorghums were {{processed}} into extrudates, thick porridges, and breads. The effects of sorghum type and fraction on the in vitro starch {{availability of the}} products were evaluated, and the estimated glycemic indexes (EGI) of the products were obtained. Sorghum extrudates were significantly more slowly digested than corn meal extrudates for all preparation methods (whole, cracked and decorticated kernels). Furthermore, tannin extrudates were less digestible than white sorghum extrudates. The soft endosperm nature of the tannin sorghum limited friction formation inside the extruder, reducing starch gelatinization. On the other hand, condensed tannins also interfered with the starch availability for digestion. White sorghum was more 'suitable' for extrusion, giving extrudates with higher starch degradation and expansion than the tannin sorghums. However, tannin sorghums also gave acceptable products offering the benefit of lower EGI values. Sorghum porridges were more slowly digested than a corn flour porridge when using whole and decorticated flours. In addition, tannin sorghum porridges had a lower starch digestibility compared to all the samples. Tannin sorghum flours produced soft porridges with enhanced initial starch digestibility. However, condensed tannins seemed to offset the starch digestion by limiting starch availability. All sorghum porridges had significantly lower EGI values than the corn porridge. Extrudates and porridges had reduced starch digestibilities and EGI values when using whole grains compared to using the decorticated fractions. This was observed in both the white and the tannin sorghum. Therefore, whole-grain products from sorghum have health benefits attributed to whole grain foods and slower digesting starches; for instance, prevention and treatment of diseases such as diabetes, insulin resistance, obesity, cardiovascular disease, and some types of cancer. When 12 % of tannin bran was added to a wheat bread formulation, a slower rate of starch digestion was observed compared to a wheat bread. The high concentration of non-starch components of the bran (i. e. dietary fiber, condensed tannins) affected starch digestion. The <b>addition</b> <b>of</b> <b>tannin</b> sorghum bran significantly reduced the EGI value of wheat bread, besides being a natural source of brown color, and {{an excellent source of}} antioxidants and dietary fiber...|$|E
40|$|The {{influence}} of primary compounds (energy, protein, minerals, and vitamins) in animal nutrition and foraging behavior {{has been studied}} for years. The roles of secondary compounds (terpenes, alkaloids, and phenolic compounds) are equally important, yet they have been ignored until recently. Where secondary compounds were once considered toxic by-products of plant metabolism, we now know they are actively involved in plant and animal behavior, health, and productivity. Though often appreciated historically for their negative impacts on food intake and animal production, we are becoming increasingly aware of their beneficial roles in the health of plants, animals, and humans. When animals can ingest an array of plants that contain different kinds and amounts of secondary compounds, they can mix different foods in their diet to better use both primary and secondary compounds, enhancing their health and production, {{as well as economic}} and ecological characteristics of landscapes. Endophyte-infected tall fescue contains the alkaloids perlolidine, perloline, ergotamine, and ergovaline, which are all steroidal or protein-like in nature. Tannins and saponins have a high affinity for binding proteins and lipids in the gastro-intestinal tract of animals, and facilitating their excretion from the body. These findings suggest animals may increase their use of forages with alkaloids when they are also provided forages that contain tannins or saponins. The sequence in which forages with different secondary compounds are ingested may influence any potential interactions because different compounds have different residence times in the gastrointestinal tract. I tested the hypothesis that cattle and sheep foraging behavior is influenced by eating different combinations of forages containing secondary compounds in different sequences. In pen and pasture trials, I showed that 1) cattle grazing pastures of endophyte-infected tall fescue (TF) grazed more often on TF when first allowed to graze legumes containing either tannins or saponins, and they grazed TF much more when they first grazed legumes as opposed to the reverse sequence; 2) sheep fed basal diets high in the alkaloid ergotamine d tartrate (EDT) ate more when supplemented with food containing either tannins or saponins, but in contrast to the trials on pasture with cattle, their behavior was not dramatically influenced by sequence; 3) cattle fed fresh cut endophyte-infected tall fescue were not influenced by the <b>addition</b> <b>of</b> <b>tannin</b> to their drinking water, as tannins limited both water and forage intake; 4) sheep fed food containing EDT ate more when supplemented with food containing tannins or when given a choice of foods containing tannins or saponins, than sheep supplemented with food containing saponins or no additional secondary compound. Results from these studies suggest that secondary compounds interact with one another to influence foraging behavior, and that sequence of food ingestion can be influential when animals graze on pastures...|$|E

At ensiling, {{chestnut}} hydrolyzable tannins {{were added}} to lucerne forage (T=tannins treated lucerne silage vs C=control lucerne silage). Fifty lactating Holstein cows, fed two diets different for lucerne silage treatment (C or T), were used in a cross-over design. In situ rumen soluble protein fraction (%CP) was higher for C (67. 9 vs 59. 4; P< 0. 01), whereas potentially rumen degradable protein (%CP) was lower (24. 5 vs 32. 1 for C and T; P< 0. 01). Intestinal rumen escape protein digestibility (%) was numerically higher for T (48. 3 vs 54. 3). Dry matter intake (21. 5 kg/d for both diets) and milk yield (29. 8 and 30. 2 kg/d for C and T) were not affected by dietary treatment, whereas FCM was slightly higher for T diet (27. 5 vs 27. 9 kg/d for C and T; P< 0. 10). Adding tannins to lucerne silage is effective in shifting part of N utilization from the rumen to the intestine, leading to similar productive performance in lactating cows...|$|R

40|$|Kauri (Agathis australis (D. Don) Lindl.) occurs {{naturally}} {{in the warm}} temperate forest of northern New Zealand where it grows mixed with angiosperm tree species. Below mature kauri trees thick organic layers develop in which large amounts of nitrogen are accumulated. This nitrogen seems to be inaccessible to plants. While litter quality can explain the low decomposition rate below kauri, {{it is not known}} what causes the accumulation of nitrogen. We hypothesised that kauri tannins reduce nitrogen mineralisation and litter decomposition below kauri. We further hypothesised that high tannin concentrations in the soil would increase the availability of dissolved organic nitrogen relative to the availability of inorganic nitrogen. To test these hypotheses a laboratory incubation was carried out for 1 year. Purified <b>tannins</b> <b>of</b> kauri and of two other common New Zealand tree species were added to samples of the soil organic layer from under a kauri tree. The results suggest that during the first month of incubation the added tannins reduced nitrogen availability by sequestering proteins or by stimulating nitrogen immobilisation. In the long-term, the reduced nitrogen release, which was found following tannin addition, seems attributable to the complexation <b>of</b> proteins by <b>tannins.</b> It further appeared that the <b>addition</b> <b>of</b> <b>tannins</b> did not change the ratio of dissolved organic nitrogen to inorganic nitrogen in the long-term. We conclude that the effect <b>of</b> kauri <b>tannins</b> on nitrogen release offers a good explanation for the accumulation of nitrogen below kauri trees...|$|R
40|$|Soil {{aggregates}} are organomineral {{associations with}} a fundamental importance for soil structure and function. Litter from vegetation alters aggregate formation and stability, and polyphenols such as tannins found in leaves, roots and wood {{play an important}} role in soil biogeochemical and biological processes. However, the effect <b>of</b> <b>tannins</b> on soil physical properties remains largely unexplored. We hypothesized that tannins influence aggregate stability through their ability to (i) complex proteins in the soil and (ii) perturb the gelling property of root mucilage. Therefore, Mediterranean soil aggregates were incubated with condensed tannins, either as a pure substrate or in combination with a standard protein (bovine serum albumin, BSA) and with a model root mucilage polysaccharide (polygalacturonic acid, PGA) able to form gel-like structures with divalent cations (notably Ca 2 +) widely present in Mediterranean calcareous soils. The changes in aggregate stability were monitored under controlled conditions, immediately after the <b>addition</b> <b>of</b> <b>tannins,</b> after 2 weeks, 3 and 6 months <b>of</b> incubation. <b>Tannins</b> added alone did not yield a significant effect on aggregate stability. However, modulatory effects were found when combinations <b>of</b> treatments occurred. <b>Tannins</b> positively modulated the stabilizing effect of the BSA, giving credit to our hypothesis on the stabilizing role of the tannin-protein complex forming macromolecules, thus enforcing soil particle cohesion within aggregates. However, tannins negatively altered the stabilizing effect of PGA, suggesting that the expected perturbation of the PGA gelation occurred, with detrimental consequences for aggregate stability. Over time, tannins maintained the effect of BSA, suggesting a protective effect <b>of</b> <b>tannins,</b> possibly linked to their ability to slow down the degradation of nitrogen compounds through protein binding. Overall, we showed that tannins reacted with other organic compounds resulting in specific effects on physical soil properties, thus demonstrating that tannins in soils play a role beyond their effects on biogeochemical aspects...|$|R

Some studies have recommended the use <b>of</b> <b>tannins</b> to modulate ruminal biohydrogenation (BH) of dietary fatty acids {{and enhance the}} accumulation of some bioactive metabolites.

Four commercial extracts <b>of</b> <b>tannins</b> [2 hydrolysable (HT: chestnut and oak) and 2 condensed (CT: quebracho and grape) tannins] × 2 doses of each one (2 and 5 % DM) were added to the supplemented diet. Four rumen cannulated ewes were used as donors of ruminal inoculum. According to the kinetics of gas production, only some treatments with tannin (grape 5 % and oak 2 %) were able to reduce significantly the rate of gas production, while most of them decreased slightly (1. 84 % on average) the extent of the degradation in the rumen (ED). Tannin addition had limited effects on the values of pH and VFA production after 24 h incubation but, as expected, decreased ammonia concentration. This reduction was stronger with HT and at 5 %. If these tannin extracts were proved to beneficially modulate ruminal BH, their slight negative effect on the ED should not prevent its recommendation in doses up to 5 % DM. Peer reviewe...|$|R
