5|$|Moreover, the {{failures}} at Sydney Harbour and Diego Suarez {{demonstrated that the}} improvements to the midget submarines made after Pearl Harbor had not increased the overall impact of the midget program. The modifications had various effects. The ability to man and deploy the midgets while the mother ships were submerged prevented the Army coastal radars from detecting the mother submarines. However, the midgets were still difficult to control, unstable, and prone to surfacing or diving uncontrollably. These manoeuvrability issues contributed to M-14s entanglement in the <b>anti-submarine</b> <b>net,</b> and the repeated detection of M-21 and M-24.|$|E
5|$|Of {{the three}} boats of the class, only U-5 survived the war intact. U-12 was sunk {{with the loss}} of all hands when she hit a mine near Venice in August 1915, while U-6 was scuttled by her crew in May 1916 after {{becoming}} trapped in an <b>anti-submarine</b> <b>net</b> that {{was a part of the}} Otranto Barrage. U-5 herself sank after hitting an Austro-Hungarian mine during a training exercise, but was raised, repaired and recommissioned before the war's end. U-5 was ceded to Italy as a war reparation and scrapped in 1920.|$|E
5|$|U-66 {{began her}} seventh {{and what was}} to be her final patrol on the morning of 2 September when she {{departed}} from Emden destined for operations in the North Channel. Shortly after noon on 3 September, U-66 reported a position in the North Sea that placed her beyond known British minefields, in what was her last known contact. A postwar German study offered no explanation for U-66s loss. British records suggest that U-66 may have either struck a mine in an older minefield in the Dogger Bank area, or that a combination of destroyers, submarines, and <b>anti-submarine</b> <b>net</b> tenders sank U-66 sometime between 1 and 11 October. Author Dwight Messimer discounts this latter theory as not being supported by operational details.|$|E

25|$|Dolphin {{invented the}} 'Welman', a one-man {{submarine}} that was prototyped at Station IX. The miniature submarine had no periscope so {{was hard to}} navigate as the submariner had to look through specially armoured glass segments in the small 'conning tower'. The Welman was designed to attach 560-pound explosive charge to its target by magnetic clips, but this could not be made to work reliably. It was decided to try the Welman submarine in {{an attack on the}} Floating Dock in Bergen harbour so on 20 November 1943 MTB635 and MTB625 left Lunna Voe, Shetland, carrying Welmans W45 (Lt. C. Johnsen, Royal Norwegian Navy), W46 (Lt B. Pedersen, Norwegian Army), W47 (Lt. B. Marris, RNVR) and W48 (Lt. J. Holmes, RN). The craft were launched {{at the entrance to the}} fjord. Pedersen's W46 became entangled in an <b>anti-submarine</b> <b>net</b> and had to surface, where she was captured by a German patrol craft. Pedersen survived the war in a prison camp and the other three eventually had to be scuttled. Their operators made their way north with the help of Norwegian resistance members and were picked up in February 1944 by MTB653. The failure made the Royal Navy concentrate on X craft and XE craft, although further Welman trials took place in Australia.|$|E

500|$|Before dawn on 29 May, I-21s {{floatplane}} {{performed a}} final reconnaissance flight over Sydney Harbour, {{with the mission}} of mapping {{the locations of the}} major vessels and of the <b>anti-submarine</b> <b>net.</b> Multiple observers spotted the floatplane but assumed it was a US Navy Curtiss Seagull. [...] No alarm was raised until 05:07, when it was realised that the only ship in the area carrying Seagulls was the U.S. cruiser Chicago, and all four of her aircraft were on board. [...] Richmond Air Force Base launched RAAF Wirraway fighters, which failed to locate I-21 or the floatplane. [...] Therefore, the reconnaissance flight did not result in the authorities in Sydney taking any special defence measures.

500|$|Midget {{submarine}} M-24 was {{the second}} to enter the harbour. HMAS Falie grazed M-24s hull and reported the contact to command. The report was not followed up. M-24 crossed the indicator loop undetected at 21:48, and at approximately 22:00 followed a Manly ferry through the <b>anti-submarine</b> <b>net.</b> [...] At 22:52, M-24 was spotted by a Chicago searchlight operator less than [...] to the moored cruiser's starboard, and on a course roughly parallel to the ship's facing. Chicago opened fire with a [...] gun and a quadruple machinegun mount, but inflicted minimal damage as the weapons could not [...] far enough. Some of the [...] shells skipped off the water and hit Fort Denison's Martello tower, while fragments were later found {{in the suburbs of}} Cremorne and Mosman. The senior officer present aboard Chicago ordered the crew to begin preparing for departure, and for USS Perkins to begin an anti-submarine screening patrol around the cruiser, orders that were revoked by the sceptical Captain Howard Bode when he arrived on board at around 23:30.|$|E
500|$|On {{the evening}} of 23 April 1916, UB-13 {{departed}} Zeebrugge for a patrol off {{the mouth of the}} Thames and was never heard from again. Author Dwight Messimer, in his book Verschollen: World War I U-boat Losses, reports that the British had deployed a new explosive <b>anti-submarine</b> <b>net</b> at position [...] {{in the early morning hours}} of 24 April. He suggests that it was possible UB-13 had set off some of the contact mines on the net, or possible that the submarine had struck a mine in one of the many British minefields off the Flemish coast. However, according to authors R. H. Gibson and Maurice Prendergast, in their book The German Submarine War, 1914–1918, UB-13 fouled the anchor cable of the British naval drifter Gleaner of the Sea on 24 April, and was depth charged by E.E.S.. Then for good measure, the British destroyer [...] deployed explosive sweeps against the submarine. Whatever the specific cause of her demise, all seventeen crewmen on board the submarine were killed.|$|E

2500|$|During {{the summers}} of 1943 and 1944 similar types of {{missions}} were flown over the Baltic but, {{at least in}} part due to an <b>anti-submarine</b> <b>net</b> having been positioned across the Gulf of Finland, no submarines were spotted. The Baltic missions ended on 21 August 1944. Following the Moscow Armistice on 4 September 1944, the M.F. 11s were sent to Detachment Jauri in the far north of Finland to participate in the Lapland War, [...] flying around 60 transport missions in October.

As the ship was behind Kormoran and on a similar course, the raider slowed until the merchantman was abeam of the raider and [...] to port. The German ship dropped her camouflage, increased speed, and ordered the freighter to stop or be fired upon. In response, the merchantman attempted to transmit a distress call (which was jammed by Kormoran) and tried to man her stern gun, prompting the Germans to open fire. The freighter took heavy damage, as every time Detmers ordered or was about to order a cease-fire, the target ship attempted to escape or transmit another distress signal. Eventually, the 46 survivors of the crew (five {{were killed in the}} attack) abandoned their burning vessel, and boarding parties were sent from the raider. She was identified as the 8,022-ton British freighter Craftsman, carrying an <b>anti-submarine</b> <b>net</b> for Singapore, which was to be delivered after a stop in Cape Town.

[...] An electronic submarine detection system registered its passage at 0930 on 18 February 1942, but the signal was dismissed as caused by a patrol boat. [...] After spending the day resting {{on the bottom of the}} harbor, U-161 surfaced after dark to torpedo two anchored ships. [...] U-161 then left the gulf with decks awash and running lights illuminated to resemble one of the harbor small craft; and then moved off to the northwest before returning to sink a ship outside the Boca.

2500|$|The Shoeburyness Boom (also {{known as}} the Sheerness Boom, Thames Boom or Thames Estuary Boom) refers to two {{defensive}} barriers erected across the Thames Estuary in the mid-20th century.

[...] Both booms ran from Shoeburyness in Essex to Sheerness in Kent, a distance of 5.6 miles (9.0 km). [...] The first boom consisted of wooden piles driven into the estuary bed at either end with the deep water channel protected by an <b>anti-submarine</b> <b>net.</b> [...] The second boom was formed of concrete piles at either end with {{the gap in the}} channel to be closed by moored Royal Navy vessels. [...] The development of nuclear missiles, jet bombers and the hydrogen bomb quickly rendered the Cold War boom obsolete and it was partially demolished in the 1960s.
