5|$|The Phillies' first GM was Herb Pennock, {{selected}} by owner Bob Carpenter, Jr. {{to oversee the}} team when {{he went into the}} army; before this time, GM duties were handled primarily by the team owner, <b>and</b> <b>this</b> <b>would</b> continue after Pennock's tenure when a GM was not present. On September 10, 2015, the Phillies announced they would not extend GM Rubén Amaro, Jr.'s contract. Amaro had led the team since 2008.|$|E
5|$|Back in Cuba, Castro feared a U.S.-backed coup; in 1959 {{his regime}} spent $120 million on Soviet, French, and Belgian {{weaponry}} and by early 1960 had doubled {{the size of}} Cuba's armed forces. Fearing counter-revolutionary elements in the army, the government created a People's Militia to arm citizens favorable to the revolution, training at least 50,000 civilians in combat techniques. In September 1960, they created the Committees for the Defense of the Revolution (CDR), a nationwide civilian organization which implemented neighborhood spying to detect counter-revolutionary activities as well as organizing health and education campaigns, becoming a conduit for public complaints. By 1970, {{a third of the}} population would be involved in the CDR, <b>and</b> <b>this</b> <b>would</b> come to rise to 80%.|$|E
5|$|Christy {{could have}} {{graduated}} in 1940, {{but could not}} then be a teaching assistant, <b>and</b> <b>this</b> <b>would</b> have left him jobless and without income. In 1941, Oppenheimer found him a post at the physics department at Illinois Institute of Technology (IIT). In May 1941, he married Dagmar von Lieven. They had two sons: Thomas Edward (Ted), born in 1944, and Peter Robert, born in 1946. IIT paid Christy $200 per month to teach 27 hours per week for 11 months per annum. To keep abreast of developments in physics, he attended seminars at the University of Chicago. This {{brought him to the}} attention of Eugene Wigner, who hired him for the same money that IIT was paying him as a full-time research assistant, commencing in January 1942.|$|E

5|$|Clay {{believed}} the Democrats would again nominate Martin Van Buren, who was ardently opposed to annexation, <b>and</b> <b>this</b> <b>would</b> keep annexation from becoming {{an issue in}} the campaign. Clay was nominated by acclamation at the Whig convention in Baltimore a week later. At the Democratic nominating convention a month later, however, Van Buren was unable to secure his party's nomination, and the Democrats instead nominated James K. Polk, who strongly favored annexation. Clay tried to moderate his views on annexation, but his changes of position drew opposition from supporters of {{both sides of the issue}} as he attempted to find a middle ground. Polk went on to win the election in a close race. This was the last time Clay would be nominated for president, and many Whigs believed that, following Clay's defeat, Crittenden was the new leader of their party.|$|E
5|$|General Dean, the divisional commander, was {{angered by}} the poor {{performance}} of the 34th Infantry Regiment during the battle. He allegedly was upset that the regiment retreated so quickly without attempting to further delay the North Koreans. He considered ordering the regiment back north immediately but {{did not do so}} for fear of ambush. Dean replaced the commander of the 34th Infantry, Colonel Lovless, and ordered the 3rd Battalion back north, but when it encountered North Korean resistance it immediately became disorganized and was forced to withdraw. The engagement at Pyongtaek had caused a significant decline in morale among American forces fighting on the peninsula, <b>and</b> <b>this</b> <b>would</b> continue until victories at Inchon and the Pusan Perimeter allowed them to go on the offensive. Dean took the blame for the defeat himself, and historians consider him at least partially at fault for expecting one inexperienced battalion to hold the line against a numerically superior enemy who was well-trained.|$|E
5|$|Linus Pauling {{estimated}} the electronegativity of francium at 0.7 on the Pauling scale, {{the same as}} caesium; the value for caesium has since been refined to 0.79, {{but there are no}} experimental data to allow a refinement of the value for francium. Francium has a slightly higher ionization energy than caesium, 392.811(4)kJ/mol as opposed to 375.7041(2)kJ/mol for caesium, as would be expected from relativistic effects, <b>and</b> <b>this</b> <b>would</b> imply that caesium is the less electronegative of the two. Francium should also have a higher electron affinity than caesium and the Fr− ion should be more polarizable than the Cs− ion. The CsFr molecule is predicted to have francium at the negative end of the dipole, unlike all known heterodiatomic alkali metal molecules. Francium superoxide (FrO2) is expected to have a more covalent character than its lighter congeners; this is attributed to the 6p electrons in francium being more involved in the francium–oxygen bonding.|$|E

5|$|Most modern {{historians have}} noted how the Gregorian missionaries come across in Bede's account as {{colourless}} and boring, {{compared to the}} Irish missionaries in Northumbria, and this is related directly to the way Bede gathered his information. The historian Henry Mayr-Harting argues that in addition, most of the Gregorian missionaries were concerned with the Roman virtue of gravitas, or personal dignity not given to emotional displays, <b>and</b> <b>this</b> <b>would</b> have limited the colourful stories available about them.|$|E
5|$|The 1st Parachute Brigade, under Brigadier Lathbury, {{comprised}} the 1st, the 2nd and 3rd Parachute Battalions, the 16th (Parachute) Field Ambulance, the 1st(Parachute) Squadron, Royal Engineers and the 1st(Airlanding) Anti-Tank Battery, Royal Artillery. The airlanding anti-tank battery were {{equipped with the}} 1st Para Brigade's only anti-tank guns, the British 6pounder. Despite the formation being a parachute brigade, {{the only way to}} transport the anti-tank guns and the jeeps required to pull them when they had landed, was by glider. Transporting artillery by air was something new to the British or any other army, <b>and</b> <b>this</b> <b>would</b> be the first time that any artillery guns had ever been flown into combat.|$|E
5|$|The Alpine Spaniel {{was one of}} {{the direct}} genetic {{progenitors}} to the St. Bernard. Starting in 1830, the monks and canons of the Swiss Alps began crossing the dogs with the Newfoundland, expecting that the resulting offspring would have the longer hair of the Newfoundland <b>and</b> <b>this</b> <b>would</b> protect the dogs better from the cold. Unfortunately ice would form on the longer hair, and seeing that the dogs were no longer effective rescue dogs, the monasteries gave them away to people in the surrounding Swiss valleys.|$|E

5|$|According to {{the most}} recent (July 2015) {{revision}} of the official United Nations World Population Prospects, the world population is projected to reach 8.5 billion by 2030, up from the current 7.3 billion (July 2015), to exceed 9 billion people by 2050, and to reach 11.2 billion by the year 2100. Most of the increase will be in developing countries whose population is projected to rise from 5.6 billion in 2009 to 7.9 billion in 2050. This increase will be distributed among the population aged 15–59 (1.2 billion) and 60 or over (1.1 billion) because the number of children under age 15 in developing countries is predicted to decrease. In contrast, the population of the more developed regions is expected to undergo only slight increase from 1.23 billion to 1.28 billion, <b>and</b> <b>this</b> <b>would</b> have declined to 1.15 billion but for a projected net migration from developing to developed countries, which is expected to average 2.4 million persons annually from 2009 to 2050. Long-term estimates in 2004 of global population suggest a peak at around 2070 of nine to ten billion people, and then a slow decrease to 8.4 billion by 2100.|$|E
5|$|In 1612, having {{determined}} the orbital periods of Jupiter's satellites, Galileo proposed that with sufficiently accurate {{knowledge of their}} orbits, one could use their positions as a universal clock, <b>and</b> <b>this</b> <b>would</b> make possible the determination of longitude. He worked on this problem {{from time to time}} during the remainder of his life, but the practical problems were severe. The method was first successfully applied by Giovanni Domenico Cassini in 1681 and was later used extensively for large land surveys; this method, for example, was used to survey France, and later by Zebulon Pike of the midwestern United States in 1806. For sea navigation, where delicate telescopic observations were more difficult, the longitude problem eventually required development of a practical portable marine chronometer, such as that of John Harrison. Late in his life, when totally blind, Galileo designed an escapement mechanism for a pendulum clock (called Galileo's escapement), although no clock using this was built until after the first fully operational pendulum clock was made by Christiaan Huygens in the 1650s.|$|E
