Several <b>awareness-raising</b> <b>and</b> <b>education</b> initiatives {{in the field and}} containing a behavioural component are pointed out. The proposed approach puts a strong focus on the evaluation of actual impact. Four main conclusions are reached: 1. Initiatives should be designed to encourage or discourage a specific behaviour in a well-defined target group; 2. Initiatives should be designed using appropriate behavioural levers; 3. In order to ensure that initiative has the intended effects on the target audience, pretesting is crucial; 4. It is essential to set specific, measurable, attainable, realistic and timely objectives, and to evaluate them.

40|$|AbstractArt is an {{important}} information, <b>awareness-raising</b> <b>and</b> <b>education</b> tool. The branches of art, among which music education has {{an important}} place, are integral parts of the whole and support and complement one another. Teaching methods {{play an important role}} in music education which can appear complicated and abstract to the child. Orff-Schulwerk presents important clues to music teachers with its characteristics suited to children's nature, which emphasize the development of creativity. In order for prospect music teachers to learn to realize Orff-Schulwerk activities effectively, it is possible to resort to cooperative learning, which is an active learning technique. In this context, the purpose of this paper is to study the effects of cooperative learning on the ability of prospect music teachers to apply Orff-Schulwerk activities. The subjects of the research study where a post-test experimental design with control group is used consist of 26 prospect music teachers studying in Dokuz Eylül University. The research findings reveal that cooperative learning creates an effect of a meaningful level on the ability of prospect music teachers to apply Orff-Schulwerk activities...|$|E

30|$|Another {{lesson that}} is {{becoming}} a “Lesson Learned” is the enhancement of earthquake awareness <b>and</b> public <b>education,</b> especially among the young generations. This lesson started to become articulated after the Rudbar earthquake. Earthquake safety education was introduced in schools and earthquake drills were initiated in Tehran’s high schools in 1996, extended to the whole country in 1999, and to secondary level education in 2000. From November 2003, earthquake drills in Iran were incorporated at all school levels (Parsizadeh et al. 2007). Students and teachers who attended earthquake drills applied the knowledge they gained in the 2002 Changureh-Avaj earthquake (Izadkhah and Hosseini 2010). During the 2013 Shonbeh-Bushehr earthquake, students and teachers also successfully applied the guidelines instructed during earthquake drills, rapidly and safely evacuated buildings, found safe places, and ensured the safety and security of children (IIEES 2013). But earthquake <b>awareness-raising</b> <b>and</b> public <b>educations</b> are long-term programs that require continuous updates and developments, financial resources, regulations, decision-making commitment, and national support. Internationally, after the 2011 Great East Japan Earthquake and Tsunami, the “Miracle of Kamaishi” became well-known. Almost 3000 elementary and junior high school students of Kamaishi in Iwate Prefecture survived the destructive tsunami waves through rapid evacuation to high and safe places. This outcome {{was the result of}} years of earthquake <b>and</b> tsunami <b>awareness-raising,</b> <b>education,</b> <b>and</b> drills performed at schools and a process of student empowerment (Ranghieri and Ishiwatari 2014).|$|R

40|$|Studying the {{effectiveness}} of environmental policies is of primary importance to address the unsustainable use of resources that threatens the entire society. Thus, {{the aim of this}} paper is to investigate on {{the effectiveness}} of environmental policy instruments to decouple waste generation and landfilling from economic growth. In order to do so, the paper analyzes the case study of the Slovakian municipality of Palarikovo, which has drastically improved its waste management system between 2000 and 2012, through the utilization of differentiated waste taxes and <b>awareness-raising</b> <b>and</b> <b>education</b> campaigns, as well as targeting increased recycling and municipal composting. We find evidence of absolute decoupling for landfilled waste and waste generation, the latter being more limited in time and magnitude. These policy instruments could therefore play an important role in municipalities that are still lagging behind in waste management. More specifically, this policy mix was effective in moving away from landfilling, initiating recycling systems, and to some extent decreasing waste generation. Yet, a more explicit focus on waste prevention will be needed to address the entirety of the problem effectively. (author's abstract...|$|E
40|$|Work-life balance {{issues have}} {{attracted}} the attention of both international and national policy makers especially over the past few decades. A number of legislations have been enacted at both international and national levels over the years to respond to crisis and the conflict between work and life. For example, Convention No. 156 (1981) of the International Labor Organization, (ILO) requires that signatories make it an aim of national policy that all workers with family responsibilities – both women and men – can engage in employment without discrimination or, as far as possible, conflict between work and family obligations. The Convention puts forward a set of policy devices including leave policies, social care services, social security, flexible working time and work organization arrangements and workforce reintegration policies as well as gender-responsive <b>awareness-raising</b> <b>and</b> <b>education</b> (Articles 4 – 7). Obviously, work-life balance issues have therefore become a strategic focus for businesses and a public policy priority. In the late 1970 s, the expression work-life balance was first used to describe the balance between an individual's work and personal life in the United Kingdom.

The paper is in two parts. In the first part a five-lecture template derived directly from the EMR is proposed for the short course. In the second part this template is tested in two ways using information for Argentina: It is asked whether using the proposed template would be the most sensible way to carry out a short course in Argentina, and it is asked whether there is sufficient information available to carry out the course. It is concluded that in 2011 there is certainly enough information available, but that the proposed template would have to be modified, particularly, given the current lack of awareness of the scientific community, through the inclusion of an introductory lecture explaining why the course is needed and the focusing of the last lecture on the national implementation of the Biological and Toxin Weapons Convention rather than on the international prohibition regime more generally. Overall, however, it is concluded that country-specific courses based on the EMR are possible and effective way to help inform larger numbers of scientists about their biosecurity responsibilities...|$|E
30|$|At present, {{the overall}} {{coordination}} {{of the disaster}} management system in Cameroon lies with the DDES at the MINATD. This is the only nodal agency for disaster management in Cameroon. The intervention strategy of the DDES is expected to focus on three main complementary approaches. Before disasters, {{it is expected to}} promote disaster preparedness, prevention, and mitigation mainly through information, <b>awareness-raising,</b> sensitization, <b>and</b> <b>education</b> <b>and</b> other activities that would promote a culture of safety and readiness in the community—hence the establishment of contingency plans during the predisaster phase (Bang 2013). It is expected to initiate an emergency intervention plan during the crisis phase and coordinate the implementation of emergency response programs (sectoral contingency plans) for efficient and effective disaster management. Such activities include the on-the-spot coordination of emergency responses, search and rescue operations, and the supervision of the activities of local crisis commission. After disasters they are charged with performing activities relating to compensation and rehabilitation of affected populations, disaster and hazard risk assessment, reconstruction through the crisis commission, and the communication of risk zones. The approach so far indicates a marked disregard for the first phase, which unfortunately should be the one emphasized as it involves DRR.|$|R
40|$|The {{twenty-first century}} {{has seen a}} {{remarkable}} revival of interest in landscape bydisciplines of spatial design, such as landscape architecture, urban design and architecture. Inspired by {{the principles of the}} European Landscape Convention (ELC), several authors have suggested extending the concept of landscape into a metaphor for inclusive multiplicity and pluralism in design and planning. However, the implementation of the ELC is rather complex as it deliberately contains no methodological or practical guidelines. In this paper, we explore whether or not the holistic approach towards landscape {{in the spirit of the}} ELC actually affects Flemish design in practice. To this end, we study interviewees’ perspectives on the use of landscape in design and their experiences with it by means of a qualitative interpretive research design with multiple triangulation of data collection methods. First, we present the perspectives of the study on landscape as a medium to facilitate integration in design projects, by discussing four separate topics where this is the case. Second, we conceptualize the integration of landscape in spatial design as an expertise which can be obtained by spatial designers, regardless of their disciplinary background through <b>awareness-raising,</b> training <b>and</b> <b>education...</b>|$|R

40|$|This paper {{gives the}} results of the first census of trees in the 32. 15 ha plot in order to provide tree species {{richness}} in Kibira rainforest (Burundi). All trees ≥ 10 cm dbh were permanently tagged and their girth measured. The forest structure pattern analysed were diameter at breast height (dbh), basal area, relative dominance, and relative density, Importance Value Index (IVI) and Family Importance Value (FIV). In total, 6504 trees representing 70 species, 67 genera and 37 families were recorded. Tree density was 202 stems/ha, with a basal area of 21. 05 m²/ha. Seventeen families were represented by a single species each, eleven families were represented by two species each, five families were represented by three species each, and four families were represented by four species each. The most important families in relation to FIV were Euphorbiaceae, Myrtaceae and Araliaceae. Macaranga kilimandscharica, Syzygium guineense and Polyscias fulva were the most important species in relation to IVI. Two tree species were found to be endemic to the Albertine Rift and one species probably endemic to the Albertine Rift. The Shannon-Weiner index (H') and eveness index (J') were respectively 3. 18 and 0. 75. This study provides a baseline for the management of Kibira National Park.

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{consider}} the potential use of creative, arts-based methods to address child sexual exploitation (CSE) through connecting with and supporting young people affected by CSE; and engaging the wider community through <b>awareness-raising</b> <b>and</b> <b>education</b> to help keep young people safe. The use of the arts in building understanding, promoting agency, educating and countering negative portrayals of those affected by CSE are also explored. Design/methodology/approach – A literature review identified that there is currently a limited evidence-base surrounding the use of arts in addressing the negative outcomes for young people affected by CSE and promoting the inclusion and safety of young people in the community. To explore the potential use of the arts in engaging young people and the communities they inhabit, this paper draws from research with other “hard to engage” and stigmatised groups, and learning from efforts to tackle other sensitive and challenging issues that impact on communities. Findings – The paper suggests that despite the relatively young evidence base concerning the role of creative, arts-based methods to tackle CSE, there is relevant transferable learning that suggests that there is potential in utilising the arts to help prevent CSE and promote community safety. Research limitations/implications – There is a clear need to consider the ethical implications of this work and to further examine how the arts may be utilised to tackle CSE and bring about positive outcomes for both individuals and for the wider community. Originality/value – The paper brings together bodies of literature from other fields to explore the potential use of creative arts-based methods to tackle a significant contemporary issue of community safety...|$|E
40|$|The Western Australian Electoral Commission {{exists to}} provide quality, {{innovative}} and accountable electoral services every {{time for all}} Western Australians. Functions of the Electoral Commissioner include promoting research into and public awareness of electoral matters, and publishing material on these matters. Given these roles, in 2007 the Commission was pleased to sponsor a public sector intern for a research project that may inform and advise Members of Parliament, the Government, departments and authorities of the State, and others interested in youth electoral engagement, participatory citizenship and public involvement in decision-making. As noted by the Deputy Electoral Commissioner, Ms Lyn Sirkett, in her 2006 Public Sector Fellowship paper, the legitimacy of representative government mandates and the practicality of implementing public policy {{are affected by the}} extent of this engagement. The opportunity to participate is a key to democratic maturity, and is evident in growing calls for a ‘youth voice ’ across Australia. But opportunity alone is unlikely to fully engage electors. Civic and electoral education is also vital. The enfranchisement of young people, and extending the idea of democracy as lived experience, is crucial to the democratic activity of voting. As this paper concludes, changing the voting age needs to be addressed alongside democratic processes in the lives of young people, through genuine inclusion and participation and civic discussion in the Western Australian context. Ms French’s paper makes a valid contribution to a debate on lowering the voting age, for example in supporting optional voting for electors under 18 who are provisionally enrolled, as one element of youth engagement. Issues of automatic enrolment, voting locations, interactive online services, research into <b>awareness-raising</b> <b>and</b> <b>education</b> models, legislative reform, and a ‘youth charter ’ cannot be resolved by the Electoral Commission in isolation. I commend this paper to those interested in our democratic process and youth engagement generally, and trust it may assist in wider public debate on the issues...|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to explore health care providers’ attitudes towards people with mental illness within two districts in Zambia. It sought to {{document}} types of attitudes of primary health care providers towards people suffering from mental illness and possible predictors of such attitudes. This study offers insights into how health care providers regard people with mental illness that may be helpful in designing appropriate training or re-training programs in Zambia and other low-income African countries. Method: Using a pilot tested structured questionnaire, data were collected from a total of 111 respondents from health facilities in the two purposively selected districts in Zambia that the Ministry of Health has earmarked as pilot districts for integrating mental health into primary health care. Results: There are widespread stigmatizing and discriminatory attitudes among primary health care providers toward mental illness and those who suffer from it. These findings confirm and add weight to the results from the few other studies which have been conducted in Africa that have challenged the notion that stigma and discrimination of mental illness is less severe in African countries. Conclusion: There is an urgent need to start developing more effective <b>awareness-raising,</b> training <b>and</b> <b>education</b> programmes amongst health care providers. This will only be possible if there is increased consensus, commitment and political will within government to place mental health on the national agenda and secure funding for the sector.
