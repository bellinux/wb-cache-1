40|$|In this chapter, we are {{concerned}} with performance evaluation of olive oil production using Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) under uncertainty. In order to measure production efficiency of olive-growing farms, we first apply an imprecise DEA approach by taking into account optimistic and pessimistic perspectives on uncertainty realized in olive oil production yield. We then consider robust optimization based DEA under an uncertainty set where the random data belong. The robust DEA model enables to <b>adjust</b> <b>level</b> of conservatism that {{is defined by the}} price of robustness of the uncertainty set. The performance of imprecise and robust DEA models is illustrated via a case study of olive-growing farms located in the Aegean Region of Turkey. The numerical experiments reveal that the efficiency scores and efficiency discriminations dramatically depend on how the uncertainty is treated both in imprecise and robust DEA modeling. There exists a trade-off between the protection level and conservatism of the efficiency scores. ...|$|E
40|$|A crucial {{practice}} for vineyard managers is {{to control the}} amount of fruit hanging on their vines to reach yield and quality goals. Current vine manipulation methods to <b>adjust</b> <b>level</b> of fruit are inaccurate and ineffective because they are often not performed according to quantitative yield information. Even when yield predictions are available they are inaccurate and spatially coarse because the traditional measurement practice is to use labor intensive, destructive, hand measurements that are too sparse to adequately measure spatial variation in yield. We present an approach to predict the vineyard yield automatically and non-destructively with cameras. The approach uses camera images of the vines collected from farm vehicles driving along the vineyard rows. Computer vision algorithms are applied to the images to detect and count the grape berries. Shape and texture cues are used to detect berries {{even when they are}} of similar color to the vine leaves. Images are automatically registered together and the vehicle position along the row is tracked to generate high resolution yield predictions. Results are presented from four different vineyards, including wine and table-grape varieties. The harvest yield was collected from 948 individual vines, totaling approximatel...|$|E

40|$|This {{dissertation}} describes, implements and analyzes {{a comprehensive}} system for perceptually-driven virtual reality simulation, based on algorithms which dynamically <b>adjust</b> <b>level</b> of detail (LOD) for entity simulation {{in order to}} maximize simulation realism as perceived by the viewer. First we review related work in simulation LOD, and describe the weaknesses of the analogy that has traditionally been drawn between simulation LOD and graphical LOD. We describe the process of "perceptual criticality modeling " for quantitatively estimating the relative importance of different entities in maintaining perceived realism and predicting the consequences of LOD transitions on perceived realism. We present heuristic cognitive models of human perception, memory, and attention to perform this modeling. We then propose the "LOD Trader", a framework for perceptually driven LOD selection and an online approximation algorithm for efficiently identifying useful LOD transitions. We then describe "alibi generation", a method of retroactively elaborating a human agent's behavior to maintain its realism under prolonged scrutiny from the viewer, and discuss its integration into a heterogeneous perceptually driven simulation. We then present the "Marketplace " simulation system and describe how perceptually driven simulation techniques were used to maximize perceived realism, and evaluate their success in doing so. Finally, we summarize the dissertation work performed and its expecte...|$|E

40|$|This study aims {{to analyze}} the effects of data {{pre-processing}} on the forecasting performance of neural network models. We use three different Artificial Neural Networks techniques to predict tourist demand: multi-layer perceptron, radial basis function and Elman neural networks. The structure of the networks {{is based on a}} multiple-output approach. We use official statistical data of inbound international tourism demand to Catalonia (Spain) and compare the forecasting accuracy of four processing methods for the input vector of the networks: levels, growth rates, seasonally <b>adjusted</b> <b>levels</b> and seasonally <b>adjusted</b> growth rates. When comparing the forecasting accuracy of the different inputs for each visitor market and for different forecasting horizons, we obtain significantly better forecasts with levels than with growth rates. We also find that seasonally adjusted series significantly improve the forecasting performance of the networks, which hints at the significance of deseasonalizing the time series when using neural networks with forecasting purposes. These results reveal that, when using seasonal data, neural networks performance can be significantly improved by working directly with seasonally <b>adjusted</b> <b>levels...</b>|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND. The use of {{smokeless}} tobacco (ST), which {{has increased in}} popularity over the past 2 decades, results in considerable systemic exposure to nicotine. Nicotine might contribute to atherosclerosis by an effect on cardiovascular risk factors. METHODS. The effects of ST use on cardiovascular risk factors and cotinine and nicotine levels were studied in 1061 professional baseball players during spring training in 1988 and 1989. RESULTS. Of the study participants 477 (45 %) were users. ST use was more common among Whites (55 %) than among Blacks (29 %) or Hispanics (21 %), and users reported heavier consumption of alcohol (p less than. 001) and had higher mean serum caffeine levels (p less than. 001) than nonusers. ST users {{did not differ from}} nonusers in <b>adjusted</b> <b>levels</b> of systolic and diastolic blood pressure, pulse, and total or HDL-cholesterol. Among ST users, participants using snuff had higher mean serum cotinine levels than those who used chewing tobacco (p less than. 001). There was no association between serum cotinine <b>levels</b> and <b>adjusted</b> <b>levels</b> of any cardiovascular risk factor studied. However, higher diastolic blood pressures were associated with higher mean serum nicotine levels (p =. 02). CONCLUSIONS.

Daily coastal surface temperature and <b>adjusted</b> sea <b>level</b> {{data for the}} period 1955 - 1988 were used to characterize the surface temperature and <b>adjusted</b> sea <b>level</b> anomalies, and the propagation of features along {{the west coast of}} the United States during El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO). The strong ENSO years examined were 1957 - 58, 1972 - 73, and 1982 - 83. Moderate ENSO years used were 1966, 1976, and 1987. To look at regional differences in the signals, the time series of daily coastal surface temperature and <b>adjusted</b> sea <b>level</b> were divided into three distinct regions: the southern region (i. e., Southern California), the central upwelling region (i. e., Central California), and the northern region (i. e., Northern California, Oregon, and Washington). The anomaly series were compared with cross-spectral analysis. Phase speeds and wavenumbers were estimated from the difference in phase between La Jolla and the other stations as a function of frequency band. These were used to characterize the structure of waves associated with the propagation. of the positive surface temperature and <b>adjusted</b> sea <b>level</b> anomalies. These wave characteristics were found to be consistent with coastally trapped internal Kelvin waves, due to their phase speed, wavelength and non-dispersive nature. Phase speeds for frequencies corresponding to 4 - 20 day periods were 60 - 100 km/day, based on temperature and sea level. A regression of wavenumber against frequency gives phase speeds of about 65 - 85 km/day, that is consistent with Kelvin wave theory for typical west coast ocean structure and bathymetry. During ENSO episoddes, strong warm surface temperature anomalies were found to exist along the west coast and were supported by high <b>adjusted</b> sea <b>level</b> anomalies. The use of daily observations was advantageous over traditional monthly data for this analysis. Lieutenant, United States Nav...|$|R

In this study, we aimed to clarify the effects of the regulatory cytokine IL- 10 and Th 1 cytokine interferon-gamma (IFN-?) on allergic phenotypes after adjusting for the correlations with Th 2 cytokines. After adjusting for Th 2 cytokines, IL- 10 and IFN-? were protective against atopy. <b>Adjusted</b> <b>levels</b> of IL- 10 and IFN-? stimulated with house-dust mite (HDM) were significantly lower in atopics than non-atopics, for IL- 10 adjusting for IL- 5 (P = 0. 002), IL- 13 (P = 0. 012), IL- 9 (P = 0. 016), and IL- 4 (P = 0. 043), and for IFN-? adjusting for IL- 5 (P = 0. 005), IL- 13 (P = 0. 005), and IL- 9 (P = 0. 037).
