50|$|Making {{a drastic}} decision, Zateyev ordered the {{engineering}} section to fabricate a new coolant system by cutting off an <b>air</b> <b>vent</b> <b>valve</b> and welding a water-supplying pipe into it. This required {{the men to}} work in high radiation for extended periods. The accident released radioactive steam containing fission products that were drawn into the ship's ventilation system and spread to other compartments of the ship. The jury-rigged cooling water system successfully reduced {{the temperature in the}} reactor.|$|E
50|$|Various {{devices such}} as manual and {{automatic}} <b>air</b> <b>vents</b> are used to address free air which floats up to the high points throughout the system. Automatic <b>air</b> <b>vents</b> contain a <b>valve</b> that is operated by a float. When air is present, the float drops, allowing the valve to open and bleed air out. When water reaches (fills) the valve, the float lifts, blocking the water from escaping. Small (domestic) versions of these valves in older systems are sometimes fitted with a Schrader-type air valve fitting, and any trapped, now-compressed air can be bled from the valve by manually depressing the valve stem until water rather than air begins to emerge.|$|R
40|$|Industrial alloys are {{generally}} multi-component systems with volatile and highly reactive components. Consequently, their processing in {{the liquid state}} requires special precautions. Therefore, an existing electromagnetic-levitation device with a high-vacuum chamber, designed for surface tension measurements was modified and improved. Due to the necessity of an extremely pure experiment-environment the equipment was constructed with special consideration of very low oxygen concentration in the processing atmosphere: Only high-purity helium-hydrogen was used and special care was taken to avoid back-diffusion of <b>air</b> through <b>venting</b> <b>valves.</b> For the measurements of the surface tensions {{with the help of}} the oscillating drop technique the temperatures and the video sequences of the levitated, molten alloy were recorded without contact by pyrometer and by high-speed camera, respectively. This method yields the frequencies of the surface oscillations of the sample around the equilibrium shape and - using the modified Rayleigh law - eventually the values of the surface tension. With the help of this method some commercial industrial alloys were processed in the new EML-apparatus for ESA`s Thermolab project. The results of these measurements shall be presented and discussed. ...|$|R
5000|$|An {{emergency}} backup {{was provided}} {{in case the}} main system failed, by a separate unit called the Oxygen Purge System (OPS), mounted {{on top of the}} PLSS, immediately behind the astronaut's helmet.The OPS maintained suit pressure and removed carbon dioxide, heat and water vapor through a continuous, one-way <b>air</b> flow <b>vented</b> to space. When activated, the OPS provided oxygen to a separate inlet on the pressure suit, once a <b>vent</b> <b>valve</b> on a separate suit outlet was manually opened. The OPS provided a maximum of about 30 minutes of emergency oxygen for breathing and cooling. This could be extended to 75 to 90 minutes with a [...] "buddy system" [...] hose that used the other astronaut's functional PLSS for cooling (only). This allowed the <b>vent</b> <b>valve</b> to be partly closed to decrease the oxygen flow rate.|$|R
40|$|An {{occlusive}} cuff system comprises {{a pressure}} cuff {{and a source}} of regulated compressed gas feeding the cuff through an electrically operated fill valve. An electrically operated <b>vent</b> <b>valve</b> <b>vents</b> the cuff to the ambient pressure. The fill valve is normally closed and the <b>vent</b> <b>valve</b> is normally open. In response to an external start signal, a logic network opens the fill valve and closes the <b>vent</b> <b>valve,</b> thereby starting the pressurization cycle and a timer. A pressure transducer continuously monitors the pressure in the cuff. When the transducer's output equals a selected reference voltage, a comparator causes the logic network to close the fill valve. The timer, after a selected time delay, opens the <b>vent</b> <b>valve</b> to the ambient pressure, thereby ending the pressurization cycle...|$|R

50|$|The steam strips the {{dissolved}} {{gas from the}} boiler feedwater and exits via the <b>vent</b> <b>valve</b> {{at the top of}} the domed section. Should this <b>vent</b> <b>valve</b> not be opened sufficiently the deaerator will not work properly, causing high oxygen content in the feed water going to the boilers. Should the boiler not have an oxygen-content analyser, a high level in the boiler chlorides may indicate the <b>vent</b> <b>valve</b> not being far enough open. Some designs may include a vent condenser to trap and recover any water entrained in the vented gas. The vent line usually includes a valve and just enough steam is allowed to escape with the vented gases to provide a small visible telltale plume of steam.|$|R

40|$|Boric acid is a {{critical}} component in the reactivity control of pressurized water reactors generally being necessary to maintain a plant subcritical. In 1995, the B&W Owner's Group recognized a possible mechanism for the accumulation of low boron concentration coolant (deborate), potentially complicating recovery from certain small break LOCAs. The BWOG established a program to quantify concerns and determine prudent procedure or equipment adjustments. This report is the final report in a series dealing {{with the issue of}} boron dilution. Results of earlier studies and BWOG actions taken are reviewed. Analytical results, developed during the past year, on <b>vent</b> <b>valve</b> performance and long-term SBLOCA recovery are presented. The potential for rapid core reactivity insertion, by restart or bump of the main coolant pumps forcing deborate into the core, is shown to be procedurally restricted to safe conditions. Natural circulation restart is shown to provide insufficient core reactivity insertion rates, removing concerns over core or plant damage. It is demonstrated that <b>vent</b> <b>valves</b> remain open and flowing during both system refill and the restart of natural circulation. <b>Vent</b> <b>valve</b> operation mixes highly borated water with deborate at the downcomer entrance, again mitigating core reactivity insertion concerns. It is concluded that: issues regarding deborate accumulation within the reactor coolant system during small break LOCA are resolved; B&W-designed plants may operate without expectation of difficulties during SBLOCA recovery. iii 47 - 5006624 - 0...|$|R
