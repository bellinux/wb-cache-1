500|$|Professor Ernst Lodz is a blind mentalist. As {{revealed}} both in {{the show}} and in his original biography, he {{has a long history}} with the Carnivàle. Lodz's character arc starts with Ben joining the carnival. Lodz unsuccessfully hassles the boy to work with him and to listen to his dreams. He later initiates Ruthie's death with Management's blessing to get his sight back. Upon finding out these circumstances, Ben strangles Lodz to death, reviving Ruthie in the process. Nevertheless, Lodz repeatedly appears to Ruthie and leaves her the message [...] "Sofie is the Omega" [...] on a mirror. Using Ruthie's body, Lodz also visits his lover Lila and informs her about the events leading to his death and [...] "you'll be seeing me soon [...] in the flesh." [...] Lodz's final appearance as Ruthie was not supposed to be his last. According to Clancy Brown (Brother Justin), the writers had originally planned Lodz's return as a mummy after a man sold his desiccated body to the carnies. Lodz's demise in season 1 however was planned from the beginning. Besides serving a purpose to the story, it should indicate <b>all</b> <b>bets</b> <b>are</b> off for the other characters.|$|E
500|$|Stephen Thomas Erlewine {{wrote that}} prior to Nirvana, [...] "alternative music was {{consigned}} to specialty sections of record stores, and major labels considered it to be, at the very most, a tax write-off". Following the release of Nevermind, [...] "nothing was ever quite the same, for better and for worse". The success of Nevermind not only popularized grunge, but also established [...] "the cultural and commercial viability of alternative rock in general". While other alternative bands had hits before, Nirvana [...] "broke down the doors forever", according to Erlewine. Erlewine further stated that Nirvana's breakthrough [...] "didn't eliminate the underground", but rather [...] "just gave it more exposure". In 1992, Jon Pareles of The New York Times reported that Nirvana's breakthrough had made others in the alternative scene impatient for achieving similar success, noting, [...] "Suddenly, <b>all</b> <b>bets</b> <b>are</b> off. No one has the inside track on which of dozens, perhaps hundreds, of ornery, obstreperous, unkempt bands might next appeal to the mall-walking millions". Record company executives offered large advances and record deals to bands, and previous strategies of building audiences for alternative rock groups {{had been replaced by}} the opportunity to achieve mainstream popularity quickly.|$|E
500|$|During editing, Tarantino and Rodriguez came up {{with the}} idea of {{inserting}} [...] "missing reels" [...] into the film.

500|$|Nevermind {{not only}} popularized the Seattle grunge {{movement}} but also brought alternative rock {{as a whole}} into the mainstream, establishing its commercial and cultural viability. Neverminds success surprised Nirvana's contemporaries, who felt dwarfed by its impact. Fugazi's Guy Picciotto later commented: [...] "It was like our record {{could have been a}} hobo pissing in the forest for the amount of impact it had. [...] It felt like we were playing ukuleles all of a sudden because of the disparity of the impact of what they did". Karen Schoemer of the New York Times added that [...] "What's unusual about Nirvana's [...] "Nevermind" [...] is that it caters to neither a mainstream audience nor the indie rock fans who supported the group's debut album." [...] In 1992, Jon Pareles of The New York Times described that {{in the aftermath of the}} album's breakthrough, [...] "Suddenly, <b>all</b> <b>bets</b> <b>are</b> off.

However, this [...] "free odds" [...] <b>bet</b> cannot <b>be</b> made independently, so the expected value of the entire <b>bet,</b> including odds, <b>is</b> still negative.
