5|$|Some of {{the populations}} of this species <b>are</b> <b>spreading,</b> and these can reach densities up to {{thousands}} of snails per square meter. Females lay egg capsules, each of which contains {{a large number of}} eggs, but only one snail hatches from the capsule.

25|$|A core skill within VC is {{the ability}} to {{identify}} novel or disruptive technologies that have the potential to generate high commercial returns at an early stage. By definition, VCs also take a role in managing entrepreneurial companies at an early stage, thus adding skills as well as capital, thereby differentiating VC from buy-out private equity, which typically invest in companies with proven revenue, and thereby potentially realizing much higher rates of returns. Inherent in realizing abnormally high rates of returns is the risk of losing all of one's investment in a given startup company. As a consequence, most venture capital investments are done in a pool format, where several investors combine their investments into one large fund that invests in many different startup companies. By investing in the pool format, the investors <b>are</b> <b>spreading</b> out their risk to many different investments instead of taking the chance of putting all of their money in one start up firm.|$|E

25|$|Historically, the United States {{has always}} been marked by {{religious}} pluralism and diversity, beginning with various native beliefs of the pre-colonial time. In colonial times, Anglicans, Catholics and mainline Protestants, as well as Jews, arrived from Europe. Eastern Orthodoxy has been present since the Russian colonization of Alaska. Various dissenting Protestants, who left the Church of England, greatly diversified the religious landscape. The Great Awakenings gave birth to multiple Evangelical Protestant denominations; membership in Methodist and Baptist churches increased drastically in the Second Great Awakening. In the 18th century, deism found support among American upper classes and thinkers. The Episcopal Church, splitting from the Church of England, came into being in the American Revolution. New Protestant branches like Adventism emerged; Restorationists and other Christians like the Jehovah's Witnesses, the Latter Day Saint movement, Churches of Christ and Church of Christ, Scientist, as well as Unitarian and Universalist communities all spread in the 19th century. Pentecostalism emerged in the early 20th century {{as a result of}} the Azusa Street Revival. Scientology emerged in the 1950s. Unitarian Universalism resulted from the merge of Unitarian and Universalist churches in the 20th century. Beginning in 1990s, the religious share of Christians is decreasing due to secularization, while Buddhism, Hinduism, Islam, and other religions <b>are</b> <b>spreading.</b> Protestantism, historically dominant, ceased to be the religious category of the majority in the early 2010s.|$|E

2500|$|There {{periodically}} {{is a dead}} zone, {{or region}} of low oxygen, in the lake whose exact location varies. Scientists from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration have been studying the lake's blue-green algae blooms, {{and trying to find}} ways to predict when they <b>are</b> <b>spreading</b> or where they might hit landfall; typically the blooms arrive late each summer. This problem was extreme in the mid and late 1960's and the Lake Erie Wastewater Management Study (LEWMS) conducted by the Buffalo District of the US Army Corps of Engineers determined that the eutrophication was due to [...] "point sources" [...] such as industrial outfalls and municipal sanitary and storm sewer outfalls, as well as [...] "diffuse sources", such as overland runoff from farm and forest land. All these sources contribute nutrients, primarily phosphorus, to the lake. Growth of organisms in the lake is then spiked to the point that oxygen levels are depleted. LEWMS made recommendations for reducing point source outflows, as well as reducing farm contributions of phosphorus by changing fertilizer usage, employing [...] "no-till" [...] farming and other conservative practices. Many industrial and municipal sources have since then been greatly reduced.
