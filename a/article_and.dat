5|$|At the time, {{the only}} {{galleries}} who {{were prepared to}} show the so-called New York School (Robert Motherwell's term) were Parsons Gallery, the Samuel Kootz Gallery and the Charles Egan Gallery. To these fledgling galleries it was a financial disaster. The highest price paid for a Pollock, before 1947, was $740 and Rothko had peaked with {{the sale of a}} $120 painting in 1946. At the Kootz Gallery, from 1946 to 1948, Hans Hoffman, William Baziotes and Robert Motherwell were offered at between $100 and $950, likely fetching much lower actual sales prices. Kootz closed in 1948 {{as a result of the}} financial strain. The critical and financial success of the group would only come after a series of popularising articles in Life magazine, most notably a feature on Jackson Pollock in 1949 and the Irascibles <b>article</b> <b>and</b> photograph of 1951.|$|E
5|$|Born in Portland, Maine, Willis {{came from}} a family of publishers. His {{grandfather}} Nathaniel Willis owned newspapers in Massachusetts and Virginia, and his father Nathaniel Willis was the founder of Youth's Companion, the first newspaper specifically for children. Willis developed an interest in literature while attending Yale College and began publishing poetry. After graduation, he worked as an overseas correspondent for the New York Mirror. He eventually moved to New York and began to build his literary reputation. Working with multiple publications, he was earning about $100 per <b>article</b> <b>and</b> between $5,000 and $10,000 per year. In 1846, he started his own publication, the Home Journal, which was eventually renamed Town & Country. Shortly after, Willis moved to a home on the Hudson River where he lived a semi-retired life until his death in 1867.|$|E

This <b>article</b> identifies <b>and</b> examines studies that deal with the subject of disability with reference to rights, ethical issues, and justice. A total of 42 <b>articles</b> <b>and</b> 33 books were selected. The subject most frequently dealt with in studies on disability is that of human rights (76 % of the <b>articles</b> <b>and</b> 79 % of the books examined), followed by topics relating to welfare (52 % of <b>articles</b> <b>and</b> 64 % of books), International Classification of Functioning, Disability, and Health (38 % of <b>articles</b> <b>and</b> 45 % of books), justice (24 % of <b>articles</b> <b>and</b> 48 % of books), education (21 % of <b>articles</b> <b>and</b> 61 % of books), and work (19 % of <b>articles</b> <b>and</b> 39 % of books). The subject of disability is dealt with in various fields of study and various disciplines. Most of the studies are based on the legal approach. It is to be hoped that there will be an increase in the philosophical and ethical study of disability, which has only recently entered the European debate.

The former was successful, but the latter lost contact on a number of occasions, due to problems at the White Sands ground station.

A minor cabin pressure leak on September 2 was traced to the waste management system, and quickly controlled. The orbiter performed an Orbital Maneuvering System firing on September 2 to place itself in a lower orbit, where the air density was higher and the oxygen interaction experiments would work more effectively.|$|E
5|$|Ramones is {{the debut}} studio album by American punk rock band the Ramones, {{released}} on April 23, 1976 by Sire Records. After Hit Parader editor Lisa Robinson saw the band at a gig in New York City, {{she wrote about}} them in an <b>article</b> <b>and</b> contacted Danny Fields, insisting that he be their manager. Fields agreed and convinced Craig Leon to produce Ramones, and the band recorded a demo for prospective record labels. Leon persuaded Sire president Seymour Stein {{to listen to the}} band perform, and he later offered the band a recording contract. The Ramones began recording in January 1976, needing only seven days and $6,400 to record the album. They used similar sound-output techniques to those of the Beatles and used advanced production methods by Leon.|$|E

5|$|Returning to New York City, Willis reorganized, {{along with}} George Pope Morris, the weekly New York Mirror as the daily Evening Mirror in 1844 with a weekly {{supplement}} called the Weekly Mirror, {{in part due}} to the rising cost of postage. By this time, Willis was a popular writer (a joke was that Johann Wolfgang von Goethe was Germany's version of N. P. Willis) {{and one of the first}} commercially successful magazine writers in America. In the fall of that year, he also became the first editor of the annual gift book The Opal founded by Rufus Wilmot Griswold. During this time, he became the highest-paid magazine writer in America, earning about $100 per <b>article</b> <b>and</b> $5,000 per year, a number which would soon double. Even the popular poet Longfellow admitted his jealousy of Willis's salary.|$|E

5|$|The {{first two}} volumes of The Life of Percy Bysshe Shelley were {{published}} in 1858, but were poorly received by critics. The book was not as well edited as his previous <b>article</b> <b>and</b> many felt {{that it did not}} contain the insights about Shelley and his works that Shelley at Oxford did. The reception was not universally negative however, and several of Shelley's friends enjoyed the book. The Shelley family was very upset at the way Shelley was portrayed; they demanded the return of Shelley's papers and obtained an injunction preventing the publication of any further volumes. Hogg had begun writing a third, but it was never completed.|$|E
5|$|Valiente {{learned of}} the non-Gardnerian Wiccan Charles Cardell from a 1958 <b>article,</b> <b>and</b> {{subsequently}} struck up a correspondence with him. Cardell suggested that they pool their respective traditions together, but Valiente declined the offer, expressing some scepticism regarding Cardell's motives and conduct. In 1962, Valiente began a correspondence course run by Raymond Howard, a former associate of Cardell's; this course instructed her in a Wiccan tradition known as the Coven of Atho. At Halloween 1963 she was then initiated into the Coven of Atho in a ritual overseen by Howard, entering the lowest rank of the course, that of 'Sarsen', and beginning to copy the teachings that she received into notebooks, where {{she was able to}} identify many of the sources from which Howard had drawn upon in fashioning his tradition.|$|E
5|$|Further {{support for}} the {{association}} between autism and thiomersal appeared in an article by Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. in the magazines Rolling Stone and Salon.com alleging a government conspiracy at a CDC meeting to conceal the dangers of thiomersal to protect the pharmaceutical industry, and a book written by David Kirby, Evidence of Harm, dramatizing the lives of parents of autistic children, with both authors participating in media interviews to promote their work and the controversy. Although the allegations by Kennedy were denied and a US Senate committee investigation later found no evidence to substantiate the most serious allegations, the story had already been well publicized by leveraging Kennedy's celebrity. Salon magazine subsequently amended Kennedy's article five times due to factual errors and later retracted it completely on January 16, 2011, stating that the works of critics of the <b>article</b> <b>and</b> evidence of the flaws in the science connecting autism and vaccines undermined {{the value of the}} article to the editors.|$|E
