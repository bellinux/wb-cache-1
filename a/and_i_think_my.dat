I love doing dance songs <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>my</b> fans expect that of me. I have been getting more behind the scenes with film and television. I will probably continue to do music – and acting is still a strong passion of mine – but I really have been loving behind-the-scenes work: producing, directing and all the technical stuff". A {{few months before the}} split, a spokesperson for the label told Billboard, [...] "Unfortunately we haven't experienced the results we would have liked with this new album. But we respect and support Janet".|$|E
500|$|Throughout 2016, PewDiePie's video style change {{became more}} {{apparent}} than the tweaks he implemented in the past (see above for more). As aforementioned, PewDiePie addressed his use of words such as gay as a pejorative, retrospectively expressing, [...] "I still make kinda stupid jokes that I shouldn't make. But I feel like back then I didn't understand. I was so immature and I just thought things were funny just because they were offensive [...] I'm not proud of it. I'm really not. But I'm also glad that I've grown past it." [...] While continuing to produce fewer Let's Play videos about horror games, his style of humour also changed; PewDiePie commented in a December 2016 video, [...] "I think {{the thing is that}} I have a lot of younger audience , <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>my</b> humour got drier, and they don't get it." ...|$|E

2500|$|... "I don't put out {{a record}} every year so I can see what others are doing and learn from that and see things that are happening. So I feel that a good record from me never defines 2011 -- it should be totally {{timeless}} {{and be able to}} live in any era. I think I've done that with this one. It's different at times [...] but I don't think it's a huge departure from anything I've ever done. <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>my</b> fans who have been there since Endtroducing will really like this one." ...|$|E
2500|$|Several {{months later}} in July {{of the same}} year, it was {{revealed}} that Ciara would be reuniting with L.A. Reid by signing to his Epic Records label. Reid had previously signed Ciara to LaFace at the start of her career, and played a role in executively producing her debut album Goodies (2004). Billboard magazine officially confirmed Ciara's signing to Epic in September 2011. During an interview with Sway in the Morning in February 2012, Ciara revealed that she would be taking her time recording her fifth studio album. In June 2012, Ciara spoke about the album saying [...] "It really is just me pouring my heart into the record, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>my</b> fans deserve that. I really had to be in a comfortable place, and I really am and I'm excited about it, that's the beauty of music. Music is like really being able to express yourself. I {{wanted to make sure that}} I expressed myself in the best way that I could, and I let the music also be a healing process for me at points. There's a lot of happy moments as well, so that's what it's about. That's music. You laugh, you cry, you dance, you love, you hurt, you feel all kinds of things. That's the beauty of music." ...|$|E
2500|$|Unferth {{is portrayed}} by John Malkovich. Malkovich became {{involved}} in the project because one of his friends, who had worked with Zemeckis, [...] "spoke very highly of him. I had always found him a very interesting and innovative filmmaker. I liked the script very much and I liked the group involved and the process interested me a great deal also." [...] He found the experience of working with motion capture to be similar to his experiences working in the theater. He also found the process intriguing: [...] "Say you do a normal day of filmmaking. Sometimes that’s 1/8 of a page, sometimes it’s 3/8th of a page, normally let’s say it’s 2½ pages, maybe 3. Now it’s probably a little more {{than it used to be}} but not always. So you may be acting for a total of 20 minutes a day. In this, you act the entire day all the time except for the tiny amount of time it takes them to sort of coordinate the computer information, let’s say, and make sure that the computers are reading the data and that you’re transmitting the data. It interests me on that level because I’m a professional actor so I’d just as soon act as sit around." [...] Malkovich also recalled that he studied the original poem in high school, and that “I think we got smacked if we couldn’t recite a certain number of stanzas. It was in the Old English class <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>my</b> rendition was exemplary." ...|$|E
