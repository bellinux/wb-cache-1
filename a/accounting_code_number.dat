New USSGL <b>Account</b> <b>Number</b> <b>Code</b> Structure The new USSGL <b>account</b> <b>number</b> <b>code</b> structure will include six digits and will be implemented by adding two zeros, “ 00, ” {{to the end of}} all USSGL account numbers.

Agencies must not modify these six-digit USSGL <b>account</b> <b>number</b> <b>codes.</b> For agency-specific reporting needs, individual agencies may add a two-digit USSGL <b>account</b> extension <b>code</b> that will not be standardized in the USSGL. Use of the two-digit USSGL <b>account</b> extension <b>code</b> is at the discretion of the agency. By fiscal 2013, agencies must provide Treasury central reporting data using the new USSGL <b>account</b> <b>number</b> <b>code</b> structure. The change in the USSGL <b>account</b> <b>number</b> <b>code</b> structure applies throughout the entire TFM.

40|$|Abstract—Keylogging is an {{activity}} of capturing users’ keyboard strokes and records {{the activity of}} a computer user in a covert manner using keylogger hardware and software. The keyloggers secretly monitors and log all keystrokes. Unlike other malicious programs, keyloggers do not cause any threat to system. But {{it can be used}} to intercept passwords and other confidential information entered via the keyboard by considering various rootkits residing in PCs (Personnel Computers) that breaches the security. Cyber criminals can get user names, email passwords, PIN <b>codes,</b> <b>account</b> <b>numbers,</b> email addresses, passwords to online gaming accounts, e-payment systems, etc. As a result, it impersonates a user during authentication in financial transactions. To prevent keylogging, the strict authentication is required. The QR code can be used to design the visual authentication protocols to achieve high usability and security. The two authentication protocols are Time based One-Time-Password protocol and Password-based authentication protocol. Through accurate analysis, the protocols are proved to be robust to several authentication attacks. And also by deploying these two protocols in real-world applications especially in online transactions, the strict security requirements can be satisfied. Keywords — keylogging; phishing; pharming; session hijacking...|$|R

Journal entries increased from 34 to 66 in FY 2014 and FY 20152; with a notable amount correcting the general ledger code.
