40|$|Throughout history hearing {{people have}} been puzzled about the {{difficulty}} to communicate with deafpeople; a puzzlementperhaps strengthened {{by the fact that}} hearing {{is only one of the}} human sensory faculties. Apparently loss of hearing affects human communication far more than any other sensory impairment. On analyzing the communication process in more detail one finds that it is made possible by a large numberofconditions thatall have to be satisfied in order to proceed successfully. It appears to be inherently uncertain, it requires a great deal of redundancy, and makes use of an, often implicit, protocol. On closer analysis it turns out that the process of manual signing embodies the same communicative principles as spoken communication; even if a number of features are different as a consequence of the visual display. Inasmuch as the development of sign language seems to parallel that of spoken language in many ways, sign language qualifies undoubt­edly as a language in its own right. Interactive instruction can be considered to be a special kind ofcommunication with dialogue rules that are in many ways different from those in other types of person-to-person communication. Some ofthese <b>are</b> <b>beneficia!</b> for interactive instructional systems, but a persistent problem is still how to obtain informative feedback, and how to deal with it in the ongoing interaction. One example is the question of how to provide spoken instances ofletters in words, or words in a text for hearing impaired ordeaf children when they try learning to rcad. Alphabetic script has many problems for those who do not have the same audible representation of language as hearing people. Current insight in communication processes suggests that one should abstain from strong statements on education for deaf people and concen­trate instead on evaluation of the intelligibility and comprehensibility of the instructional dialogue...|$|E

Previous studies have concentrated on cold- and warmwater species; little information exists for tropical fishes.

Plasma cortisol levels were evaluated in threespot gourami after a handling stressor and treatment with one of four anesthetics—tricaine methanesul-fonate (TMS; 60 mg/L), metomidate (0. 8 mg/L), quinaldine (5 mg/L), and Hypno (0. 14 mg/L) —or salt (NaCl; 3 g/L).

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To review {{potential}} clinical situations beyond sepsis {{in which}} activated protein C {{might be an}} effective treatment.

Therefore, administration of activated protein C could be beneficial in disease states that are also characterized by the simultaneous activation of these systems. Ischemia-reperfusion injury of various organs may represent such a state. Indeed, the involvement of the protein C system has been demonstrated in various experimental studies of ischemia-reperfusion, including studies in renal ischemia-reperfusion syndromes, coronary atherosclerosis and acute coronary syndromes, and intestinal ischemia and reperfusion.

Three members of the hospital staff were infected: a 42 -year-old man, a 33 -year-old woman, and a 26 -year-old woman. The first 2 patients had not been immunised, and the third had received 2 immunisations according to the Dutch National Immunisation Programme. Vaccination of the 2 sero-negative patients within 48 h after exposure with the measles-mumps-rubella vaccine (MMR) did not prevent the development of measles. Vaccination was deemed unnecessary in the third patient. No tertiary cases occurred. The same measles virus (genotype D 5) was detected by PCR and sequencing in all 4 patients. Measles remains a risk for hospital staff members who have not acquired natural immunity. The current policy of immunising patients within 72 h after exposure to measles may not be sufficient.

A systematic search of bibliographical databases and reference checking were performed to identify publications on randomized controlled trials (RCTs) which evaluated the effect of exercise therapy on arm function in stroke patients. The methodological quality was assessed systematically by two raters, based on a standardized list of methodological criteria. Study characteristics, such as the chronicity and severity of impairment of the patient population, the amount and duration of interventions, and specific methodological criteria, were related to reported effects. Thirteen RCTs were identified, six of which reported positive results on an arm function test. In five of these six studies there was a contrast in amount or duration of exercise therapy between groups. Methodological scores ranged from 5 to 15 (maximum possible score: 19 points). Insufficient evidence {{made it impossible to}} draw definitive conclusions about the effectiveness of exercise therapy on arm function in stroke patients.

40|$|Expansion of {{a stretch}} of polyglutamine in {{huntingtin}} (htt), the protein product of the IT 15 gene, causes Huntington’s disease (HD). Previous investigations {{into the role of}} the polyglutamine stretch (polyQ) in htt function have suggested that its length may modulate a normal htt function involved in regulating energy homeostasis. Here we show that expression of full-length htt lacking its polyglutamine stretch (DQ-htt) in a knockin mouse model for HD (Hdh 140 Q/DQ), reduces significantly neuropil mutant htt aggregates, ameliorates motor/behavioral deficits, and extends lifespan in comparison to the HD model mice (Hdh 140 Q/+). The rescue of HD model phenotypes is accompanied by the normalization of lipofuscin levels in the brain and an increase in the steady-state levels of the mammalian autophagy marker microtubule-associate protein 1 light chain 3 -II (LC 3 -II). We also find that DQ-htt expression in vitro increases autophagosome synthesis and stimulates the Atg 5 dependent clearance of truncated N-terminal htt aggregates. DQ-htt’s effect on autophagy most likely represents a gain-offunction, as overexpression of full-length wild-type htt in vitro does not increase autophagosome synthesis. Moreover, Hdh DQ/DQ mice live significantly longer than wild-type mice, suggesting that autophagy upregulation may <b>be</b> <b>beneficia...</b>|$|R

40|$|Background: Research about {{termination}} for {{fetal abnormality}} (TFA) {{suggests that it}} is a traumatic event with potential negative psychological consequences. However, evidence also indicates that following traumatic events individuals may experience growth. Although TFA’s negative psychological outcomes are well documented, little is known of the potential for growth following this event. Therefore, the study’s objectives were to measure posttraumatic growth (PTG) post-TFA, examine the relationship between PTG, perinatal grief and coping, and determine the predictors of PTG. Design: An online, retrospective survey was conducted with 161 women. Methods: Eligible participants were women over 18 who had undergone TFA. Participants were recruited from a support organisation. They completed the Brief COPE, Short Perinatal Grief Scale and Posttraumatic Growth Inventory. Data were analysed using regression analyses. Results: Moderate levels of PTG were observed for “relating to others,” “personal strengths” and “appreciation of life. ” “Positive reframing” {{was a significant predictor of}} PTG. Despite using mainly “adaptive” coping strategies, women’s grief levels were high. Conclusions: “Adaptive” coping strategies such as, “positive reframing” are relevant to TFA.

Recently, we have described that, in B-CLL samples from peripheral blood, aberrant apoptosis gene expression {{was not limited to}} protective changes but also included increased levels of proapoptotic BH 3 -only member Noxa. Here, we compare apoptosis gene profiles from peripheral blood B-CLL (n= 15) with lymph node B-CLL (> 90 % CD 5 +/CD 19 +/CD 23 + lymphocytes with Ki 67 + centers; n= 9). Apart from expected differences in Survivin and Bcl-xL, a prominent distinction with peripheral B-CLL cells was the decreased averaged level of Noxa in lymph nodes. Mcl- 1 protein expression showed a reverse trend. Noxa expression could be reduced also in vitro by CD 40 stimulation of peripheral blood B-CLL. Direct manipulation of Noxa protein levels was achieved by proteasome inhibition in B-CLL and via RNAi in model cell lines. In each instance, cell viability was directly linked with Noxa levels.

METHODS: Dental students from two consecutive classes (2011 / 2012 and 2012 / 2013) at the Department of Orofacial Pain and Jaw Function at the dental school in Malmö, Sweden completed two self-evaluations, one at the beginning of semester seven and one at the end of semester eight. The questionnaire that they were given concerned achieved competencies and satisfaction with education in TMD and orofacial pain. Items focused on anatomy, physiology, and clinical training. Students estimated their competence and satisfaction on a numeric rating scale and described their idea of treating TMD and orofacial pain patients on a verbal rating scale. Outcome variables were tested with paired samples t test for differences over time and independent samples t test for between-class comparisons; both were adjusted for multiple testing with Bonferroni correction. RESULTS: Significant improvement in all items was observed for achieved competencies and satisfaction in both classes between semester seven and semester eight (P. 05).

40|$|L 1 {{is among}} the few {{adhesion}} molecules that favors repair after trauma in the adult central nervous system of vertebrates by promoting neuritogenesis and neuronal survival, among other beneficial features. In the peripheral nervous system, L 1 is up-regulated in Schwann cells and regrowing axons after nerve damage, but the functional consequences of this expression remain unclear. Our previous study of L 1 -deficient mice in a femoral nerve injury model showed an unexpected improved functional recovery, attenuated motoneuronal cell death, and enhanced Schwann cell proliferation, being attributed to the persistent synthesis of neurotrophic factors. On the other hand, transgenic mice over-expressing L 1 in neurons led to improved remyelination, but not improved functional recovery. The present study was undertaken to investigate whether the monoclonal L 1 antibody 557 that triggers beneficial L 1 functions in vitro would trigger these also in femoral nerve repair. We analyzed femoral nerve regeneration in C 57 BL/ 6 J mice that received this antibody in a hydrogel filled conduit connecting the cut and sutured nerve before its bifurcation, leading to short-term release of antibody by diffusion. Video-based quantitative analysis of motor functions showed improved recovery when compared to mice treated with conduits containing PBS in the hydrogel scaffold, as a vehicle control. This improved recovery was associated with attenuated motoneuron loss, remyelination and improved precision of preferential motor reinnervation.

Logistic regression analysis {{was carried out in}} this study, using data of 2, 274 pregnant women of Dutch ethnicity from the ABCD study, a population-based cohort study in the Netherlands. Maternal 25 (OH) vitamin D was measured in early pregnancy. Stratified analyses were conducted for overweight, season of blood sampling, and smoking. Low-educated women had lower 25 (OH) vitamin D levels compared to high-educated women, and women in the lowest 25 (OH) vitamin D quartile had a higher risk of SGA offspring. In addition, low-educated women had a higher risk of SGA offspring (OR 1. 95 [95 % CI: 1. 20 - 3. 14]). This association decreased with 7 % after adjustment for 25 (OH) vitamin D (OR 1. 88 [95 % CI 1. 16 - 3. 04]). In stratified analyses, adjustment for 25 (OH) vitamin D resulted in a decrease in OR of about 17 % in overweight women and about 15 % in women who conceived in wintertime. 25 (OH) vitamin D appears to be a modifiable contributor to the association between low maternal education and SGA offspring, particularly in overweight women and women who conceived in the winter period.

TB rates were also estimated following cART initiation, ending at the earliest of death or last clinic visit. Poisson models were used to examine the effect of current and past level of immunosuppression on TB risk after cART initiation. Of 19 815 individuals at risk during 1982 - 1996, TB incidence increased from 5. 89 / 1000 person-years (PY) (95 % CI 3. 77 to 8. 76) in the first year after seroconversion to 10. 56 (4. 83 to 20. 04, p= 0. 01) at 10 years. Among 11 178 TB-free individuals initiating cART, the TB rate in the first year after cART initiation was 4. 23 / 1000 PY (3. 07 to 5. 71) and dropped thereafter, remaining constant from year 2 onwards averaging at 1. 64 / 1000 PY (1. 29 to 2. 05).

Daily total phytoestrogen intake was significantly higher in the postmenopausal group (48. 54 mg) than the premenopausal (31. 41 mg) and was resulted mostly from higher intakes of daidzein and genistein from soy and soy products (45. 42 mg vs 28. 91 mg). Serum genistein level and excretion of enterolactone, major lignan metabolite, were not very different between the two groups. Serum retinal and α- tocopherol levels were higher in the postmenopausal group but TBARS levels were not different between the two groups.

However, as the world has not faced a severe pandemic for decades, except the rather mild H 1 N 1 one in 2009, pandemic influenza models are inherently hypothetical and validation is, thus, difficult. We aim at reconstructing a recent seasonal influenza epidemic that occurred in Switzerland and deem this to be a promising validation strategy for models of influenza spread. METHODS: We present a spatially explicit, individual-based simulation model of influenza spread. The simulation model bases upon (i) simulated human travel data, (ii) data on human contact patterns and (iii) empirical knowledge on the epidemiology of influenza. For model validation we compare the simulation outcomes with empirical knowledge regarding (i) the shape of the epidemic curve, overall infection rate and reproduction number, (ii) age-dependent infection rates and time of infection, (iii) spatial patterns. RESULTS: The simulation model is capable of reproducing the shape of the 2003 / 2004 H 3 N 2 epidemic curve of Switzerland and generates an overall infection rate (14. 9 percent) and reproduction numbers (between 1. 2 and 1. 3), which are realistic for seasonal influenza epidemics. Age and spatial patterns observed in empirical data are also reflected by the model: Highest infection rates are in children between 5 and 14 and the disease spreads along the main transport axes from west to east. CONCLUSIONS: We show that finding evidence for the validity of simulation models of influenza spread by challenging them with seasonal influenza outbreak data is possible and promising. Simulation models for pandemic spread gain more credibility if they are able to reproduce seasonal influenza outbreaks. For more robust modelling of seasonal influenza, serological data complementing sentinel information would <b>be</b> <b>beneficia...</b>|$|R
40|$|The European Intergroup Cooperative Ewing's Sarcoma Study {{investigated}} whether cyclophosphamide has {{a similar}} efficacy as ifosfamide in standard-risk (SR) patients and whether the addition of etoposide improves survival in high-risk (HR) patients. SR patients (localized tumors, volume or= 100 mL or metastases) {{were randomly assigned to}} receive 14 courses of either VAIA or VAIA plus etoposide (EVAIA). Outcome measures were event-free survival (EFS; defined as the time to first recurrence, progression, second malignancy, or death) and overall survival (OS). A total of 647 patients were randomly assigned: 79 SR patients were assigned to VAIA, 76 SR patients were assigned to VACA, 240 HR were assigned to VAIA, and 252 HR patients were assigned to EVAIA. The median follow-up was 8. 5 years. In the SR group, the hazard ratios (VACA v VAIA) for EFS and OS were 0. 91 (95 % CI, 0. 55 to 1. 53) and 1. 08 (95 % CI, 0. 58 to 2. 03), respectively. There was a higher incidence of hematologic toxicities in the VACA arm. In the HR group, the EFS and OS hazard ratios (EVAIA v VAIA) indicated a 17 % reduction in the risk of an event (95 % CI, - 35 % to 5 %; P =. 12) and 15 % reduction in dying (95 % CI, - 34 % to 10 %), respectively. The effect seemed greater among patients without metastases (hazard ratio = 0. 79; P =. 16) than among those with metastases (hazard ratio = 0. 96; P =. 84). Cyclophosphamide seemed to have a similar effect on EFS and OS as ifosfamide in SR patients but was associated with increased toxicity.

40|$|Research on the {{interaction}} between plantation forestry and aquatic environments is essential to develop environmentally compatible and sustainable management further. Given, in Ireland, the generally low levels of atmospheric pollution, its geology and maritime climate, and the unique fauna and flora due to its island history, such studies are important {{not only in the}} regional context, but also internationally, as they provide an opportunity to examine the effect of forestry and forest management practices on aquatic systems per se, without the complications of acidification. Here, some of the major findings of forestry and water research in Ireland have been reviewed and compared with those from the UK and elsewhere. Plantation forests do not exacerbate acidification in the south of Ireland (Munster) as a whole so that the influence of forestry on water chemistry is far less important than {{in other parts of the}} country (such as Wicklow and Mayo). The main forestry influence on streams in Munster is more likely through physical factors, but their nature is unclear. In a few catchments some negative effects are evident, but in many others apparently positive forest effects occur. In this context, smaller scale catchment-level effects appear to be more important in explaining the various relationships between plantation forests and stream ecology than larger scale regional factors. The management of riparian zones, particularly in forested catchments, is of major importance for the structure and functioning of aquatic communities and further work is needed on best management practices. It is suggested that it is unreasonable to base forest management on national Forest-Fisheries guidelines since regions vary too much and the signal from local conditions is too strong. The approach for environmentally benign, scientifically sound forestry management has to be at the catchment scale. Trees in the right places may <b>be</b> <b>beneficia...</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{additional}} 48 -week optional treatment {{extension of}} the T- 20 versus Optimized Regimen Only (TORO) studies evaluated long-term safety and efficacy of enfuvirtide (ENF) through week 96 in patients receiving ENF plus optimized background (OB) and patients switching to ENF plus OB from OB alone. Patient randomization was 2 : 1 to ENF plus OB (n = 663) and OB (n = 334), of which 89. 7 % and 89. 8 % were male, 89. 3 % and 88. 6 % were Caucasian, and median age was 41 and 42 years, respectively. HIV risk factors were comparable between the ENF plus OB and OB groups with the major factors being 65. 2 % versus 66. 2 % homosexual contact, 17. 8 % versus 19. 8 % heterosexual contact, 4. 1 % versus 4. 8 % bisexual contact, respectively, and 6. 9 % injection drug use in both groups. OB patients were allowed to switch to ENF plus OB at virologic failure before week 48 and required to switch at week 48 {{to continue in the}} study (n = 230). Efficacy and safety assessments were conducted for each group. At week 96, 55 % of ENF plus OB subjects completed the study and 26. 5 % achieved a viral load of less than 400 copies per milliliter (17. 5 % achieved less than 50 copies per milliliter). Viral load and CD 4 mean change from baseline was - 2. 1 and - 1. 1 log(10) HIV- 1 -RNA copies per milliliter and + 166 and + 116 CD 4 cells/mm(3) for ENF plus OB and switch patients, respectively. No new ENF-related safety issues emerged in weeks 48 - 96. Injection site reactions led to discontinuation in 7 % and 10 % of ENF plus OB and switch patients, respectively. In conclusion, these data demonstrate durable efficacy and safety of ENF over 96 weeks and that early use of ENF in combination with other agents for the treatment of antiretroviral-experienced HIV-infected subjects <b>is</b> <b>beneficia...</b>|$|R
