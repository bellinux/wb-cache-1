5|$|The Orkney and Shetland archipelagos to {{the north}} <b>are</b> <b>similarly</b> lacking in {{freshwater}} islands. Law Ting Holm is the former location of the national þing, or Norse parliament of Shetland.|$|E
5|$|Demonstratives <b>are</b> <b>similarly</b> {{considered}} nominals in Wagiman, {{and take}} the same case suffixes depending on their semantic and syntactic roles; their function within the sentence. That is, the demonstrative mahan 'this', or 'here' (root: mayh-), may take case {{just like any other}} nominal.|$|E

50|$|During Truly's stint on {{the show}} Compo <b>was</b> <b>similarly</b> often {{involved}} in dangerous situations against his will. Though Truly <b>was</b> <b>similarly</b> pompous like his predecessors he eventually grew used to Compo's childish behaviour and the two did not argue frequently.|$|R
50|$|His son {{was also}} called Charles (Charles Ruthven Bickerton Blackburn AC), <b>was</b> <b>similarly</b> a Lieutenant-Colonel for the Australian Army Medical Corps (World War II), and <b>was</b> <b>similarly</b> {{associated}} with the University of Sydney, becoming the Bosch Professor and Head of the Department of Medicine in 1957.|$|R
5|$|Figs have an obligate {{mutualism}} with fig wasps, (Agaonidae); figs {{are only}} pollinated by fig wasps, and fig wasps can only reproduce in fig flowers. Generally, each fig species {{depends on a}} single species of wasp for pollination. The wasps <b>are</b> <b>similarly</b> dependent on their fig species in order to reproduce. Ficus aurea is pollinated by Pegoscapus mexicanus (Ashmead).|$|E
5|$|Royal decrees (nizam) are {{the other}} main source of law but are {{referred}} to as regulations rather than laws to indicate that they are subordinate to the Sharia. Royal decrees supplement Sharia in areas such as labor, commercial and corporate law. Additionally, other forms of regulations (lai'hah) include Royal Orders, Council of Ministers Resolutions, Ministerial Resolutions and, Ministerial Circulars, and <b>are</b> <b>similarly</b> subordinate to Sharia.|$|E
5|$|Some probiotics {{have been}} shown to be {{beneficial}} in reducing both the duration of illness and the frequency of stools. They may also be useful in preventing and treating antibiotic associated diarrhea. Fermented milk products (such as yogurt) <b>are</b> <b>similarly</b> beneficial. Zinc supplementation appears to be effective in both treating and preventing diarrhea among children in the developing world.|$|E

5|$|Subgenres, not {{necessarily}} distinct, include anti-war, comedy, animated, propaganda, and documentary. There <b>are</b> <b>similarly</b> subgenres {{of the war}} film in specific theatres such as the western desert (North Africa), the Pacific in the Second World War, or Vietnam; and films set in specific domains of war, such as the infantry, the air, at sea, in submarines, or at prisoner of war camps.|$|E
5|$|Texas's {{population}} density is 90.5people per squaremile which is {{slightly higher than}} the average {{population density}} of the U.S. as a whole, at 80.6people per squaremile. In contrast, while Texas and France <b>are</b> <b>similarly</b> sized geographically, the European country has a population density of 301.8 people per square mile.|$|E
5|$|The D'Angelo-indebted grind session 'Rocket' and frisky 'Drunk In Love' <b>are</b> <b>similarly</b> sexy, but they're not sexy like a glamour shot or {{a steamy}} video. They're sexy like an overeager, pre-shower quickie, or a hushed morning make-out session before the baby wakes up. These {{are the most}} unapologetically raunchy songs she's ever sung, {{and in many ways}} also the most romantic.|$|E

5|$|The drip {{painting}} {{works of the}} modern artist Jackson Pollock <b>are</b> <b>similarly</b> distinctive in their fractal dimension. His 1948 Number 14 has a coastline-like dimension of 1.45, while his later paintings had successively higher fractal dimensions and accordingly more elaborate patterns. One of his last works, Blue Poles, took six months to create, and has the fractal dimension of 1.72.|$|E
5|$|This {{version of}} the story appears in Virgil's Aeneid, in a passage {{describing}} a series of paintings decorating the walls of a temple of Juno. The painting immediately next to the one depicting Troilus shows the death of Rhesus, another character killed because of prophecies linked to the fall of Troy. Other pictures <b>are</b> <b>similarly</b> calamitous.|$|E
5|$|Warning calls {{given by}} birds {{such as the}} Eurasian jay <b>are</b> <b>similarly</b> honest signals, benefiting both {{predator}} and prey: the predator is informed {{that it has been}} detected and might as well save time and energy by giving up the chase, while the prey is protected from attack.|$|E

5|$|End of Ages {{has several}} {{features}} {{designed to help}} players complete puzzles. To recall clues or important items, players can use a camera feature to take screenshots, which are then placed in a journal the player can access at any time. Player interactions with other characters <b>are</b> <b>similarly</b> recalled via another journal; everything a character tells the player is stored and can be viewed at any time. Journal pages are narrated by {{the voice of the}} character, and missing pages of the journal appear translucent in menus.|$|E
5|$|Fungi create harm by spoiling food, {{destroying}} timber, and by causing {{diseases of}} crops, livestock, and humans. Fungi, mainly moulds like Penicillium and Aspergillus, spoil many stored foods. Fungi cause {{the majority of}} plant diseases, which in turn cause serious economic losses. Sometimes, as in the Great Irish Famine of 1845–1849, fungal diseases of plants, in this case potato blight caused by Phytophthora, result in large-scale human suffering. Fungi <b>are</b> <b>similarly</b> {{the main cause of}} economic losses of timber in buildings. Finally, fungi cause many diseases of humans and livestock; Aspergillosis kills some 600,000 people a year, mainly however those with already weakened immune systems.|$|E
5|$|He {{considers}} the forces such as surface tension acting on cells, and Plateau's experiments on soap films. He illustrates {{the way a}} splash breaks into droplets and compares this to the shapes of Campanularian zoophytes (Hydrozoa). He looks at the flask-like shapes of single-celled organisms such as species of Vorticella, considering teleological and physical explanations of their having minimal areas; and at the hanging drop shapes of some Foraminifera such as Lagena. He argues that the cells of trypanosomes <b>are</b> <b>similarly</b> shaped by surface tension.|$|E

5|$|It has a {{low rate}} of fruiting, with less than 1% of flowers {{developing}} into follicles, {{and more than half}} of the inflorescences failing to form any follicles at all. Seed survival rates <b>are</b> <b>similarly</b> low. More than half of a plant's seed crop may be lost to the larvae of moths and weevils, which burrow into the cobs to eat the seeds and pupate in the follicles; and further seed losses are caused by granivorous birds such as cockatoos, which break off the cobs to eat both the seeds and the insect larvae.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Amy and {{the clerics}} find the Angels {{moving away from}} the primary control room. One cleric goes to investigate, and finds the crack has grown wider, but then is soon {{consumed}} by it. Amy remembers this cleric, but none of the others do, as he had been erased from time. The crack continues to grow, and soon the other clerics <b>are</b> <b>similarly</b> consumed. The Doctor directs Amy to keep her eyes closed and work her way to the secondary control room, hoping that the Angels will not recognise that her eyes are shut. Amy falters and trips, but as the Angels move in, River is able to teleport her to the secondary control room, rescuing her.|$|E
5|$|Several governments {{maintain}} permanent manned research stations on the continent. The {{number of}} people conducting and supporting scientific research and other work on the continent and its nearby islands varies from about 1,000 in winter to about 5,000 in the summer, giving it a population density between 70 and 350 inhabitants per million square kilometres (180 and 900 per million square miles) at these times. Many of the stations are staffed year-round, the winter-over personnel typically arriving from their home countries for a one-year assignment. An Orthodox church—Trinity Church, opened in 2004 at the Russian Bellingshausen Station—is manned year-round by one or two priests, who <b>are</b> <b>similarly</b> rotated every year.|$|E
