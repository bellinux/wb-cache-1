5|$|<b>A</b> <b>high</b> <b>risk</b> day {{indicates}} a considerable likelihood of significant to extreme severe weather, generally a major tornado outbreak or (much less often) an extreme derecho event. On these days, the potential exists for extremely severe and life-threatening weather, including widespread strong or violent tornadoes – {{some of which}} may be on the ground for a half-hour or longer – and/or very destructive straight-line winds (hail cannot verify or produce <b>a</b> <b>high</b> <b>risk</b> on its own, although such a day usually involves a threat for widespread very large and damaging hail as well). Many of the most prolific severe weather days were high risk days. Such days are rare; <b>a</b> <b>high</b> <b>risk</b> is typically issued (at the most) only a few times each year (see List of Storm Prediction Center high risk days). High risk areas are usually surrounded by a larger moderate risk area, where uncertainty is greater or the threat is somewhat lower.|$|E
5|$|Instead of anticoagulation, a {{follow-up}} imaging test (typically ultrasound) about one-week post-diagnosis {{is an option}} for those with an acute isolated distal DVT without <b>a</b> <b>high</b> <b>risk</b> for extension; if the clot does not grow, the ACCP does not recommend anticoagulation. This technique can benefit those at <b>a</b> <b>high</b> <b>risk</b> for bleeding. Patients may choose anticoagulation over serial imaging, however, to avoid the inconvenience of another scan if concerns {{about the risk of}} bleeding are insignificant. When applied to symptomatic patients with a negative initial ultrasound result, serial testing is inefficient and not cost effective.|$|E

5|$|Like other parrots, {{cockatoos}} can be {{afflicted by}} psittacine beak and feather disease (PBFD). The viral infection causes feather loss and beak malformation {{and reduces the}} bird's overall immunity. Particularly prevalent in sulphur-crested cockatoos, little corellas and galahs, it has been recorded in 14 species of cockatoo to date. Although unlikely to significantly impact on large, healthy populations of birds in the wild, PBFD may pose <b>a</b> <b>high</b> <b>risk</b> to smaller stressed populations.|$|E

Since it lies in such a seismically active area, there is <b>a</b> <b>high</b> <b>risk</b> of destructive earthquakes in Iran; 1 in 3,000 deaths are attributable to earthquakes.

30|$|The “frailty syndrome” {{is defined}} as an individual’s {{inherent}} vulnerability leading to difficulties to overcome acute stress [33, 34]. The frailty model includes areas such as physiological functioning, comorbidities, functional impairment and social difficulties [34, 35]. An easy-to-use Clinical Frailty Scale (CFS) was proposed in 2008, ranking patients in nine group from “very fit” to “terminally ill” (Table  1) (Additional file 1) [36, 37]. An increased CFS is associated with <b>a</b> <b>higher</b> <b>risk</b> of mortality [36]. Furthermore, frailty is associated with <b>a</b> <b>higher</b> <b>risk</b> of falls, worsening mobility and institutional care [38]. A recent meta-analysis concludes that there is <b>a</b> <b>higher</b> <b>risk</b> of not returning to home and <b>a</b> <b>higher</b> <b>risk</b> of in-hospital and long-term mortality in frail patients admitted to the ICU [33]. In the VIP 1 study, which included 5132 critically ill patients[*]≥[*] 80  years from 311 European ICUs, frailty (CFS[*]>[*] 4) was present in 43.1 % and was independently related to ICU (22.2 %) and 30 -day mortality (35.8 %) [39].|$|R
5|$|The use of {{alprazolam}} {{during pregnancy}} {{is associated with}} congenital abnormalities, and use in the last trimester may cause fetal drug dependence and withdrawal symptoms in the post-natal period as well as neonatal flaccidity and respiratory problems. However, in long-term users of benzodiazepines, abrupt discontinuation due to concerns of teratogenesis has <b>a</b> <b>high</b> <b>risk</b> of causing extreme withdrawal symptoms and a severe rebound effect of the underlying mental health disorder. Spontaneous abortions may also result from abrupt withdrawal of psychotropic medications, including benzodiazepines.|$|E
5|$|A UTI affects {{parts of}} the urinary system {{including}} the urethra, bladder, and kidneys. There is about a one percent risk of UTIs in boys under two years of age, {{and the majority of}} incidents occur {{in the first year of}} life. There is good but not ideal evidence that circumcision of babies reduces the incidence of UTIs in boys under two years of age, and there is fair evidence that the reduction in incidence is by a factor of 310 times (100 circumcisions prevents one UTI). Prevention of UTIs does not justify routine use of the procedure, however. Circumcision is most likely to benefit boys who have <b>a</b> <b>high</b> <b>risk</b> of UTIs due to anatomical defects, and may be used to treat recurrent UTIs.|$|E
5|$|<b>A</b> <b>high</b> <b>risk</b> {{of severe}} storms—the first such {{issuance}} since April7, 2006—was issued {{for a large}} part of the Deep South for March1 as the cold front moved eastward. The activity began almost immediately, with several isolated tornadoes taking place that morning across the Mississippi Valley, with one of them leading to the first fatality of the outbreak. Isolated tornadoes were also reported as far north as Illinois, near the center of the low. However, the most intense activity began around noon and continued throughout the afternoon and evening, with southern Alabama and southern Georgia hit the hardest. Nearly continuous supercells formed north of the Gulf of Mexico and produced many tornadoes, some of which hit large population centers with devastating effects. Twenty people were killed by those tornadoes.|$|E

5|$|After {{the mint}} closed, it {{performed}} {{a variety of}} functions for the Federal government. It was first downgraded to an assay office for the U.S. Treasury {{as it had been}} from 1876 to 1879. Then, in 1932, the assay office closed and the building was converted into a Federal prison, in which capacity it served until 1943. The Coast Guard then took over the building as a nominal storage facility, though in truth the structure was largely abandoned and left to decay until it was transferred to the state of Louisiana in 1965. During the Cold War, when many believed there to be <b>a</b> <b>high</b> <b>risk</b> of nuclear war, the old Mint was considered to be the best fallout shelter in the city.|$|E
5|$|Alloxylon flammeum {{is listed}} nationally as {{vulnerable}} under the Australian Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 (EPBC Act), {{which indicates that}} there is <b>a</b> <b>high</b> <b>risk</b> it will become extinct in the wild in the mid-term future. Before {{the establishment of the}} EPBC Act, it was, and currently remains, listed as vulnerable under the state-based Nature Conservation Act 1992. Furthermore, it was listed by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) in 1997. Most of its habitat has been cleared for agriculture and development. Remaining stands in protected areas are highly fragmented. Furthermore, plants in cultivation are likely to come from a limited genetic pool. With under 2% of its original extent remaining, the rainforest is threatened by invasive plants and grazing by feral and domestic animals.|$|E
5|$|An {{entry level}} diver must learn the {{techniques}} of breathing underwater through a demand regulator, including clearing it of water and recovering it if dislodged from the mouth, and clearing the mask if it is flooded. These are critical survival skills, and if not competent the diver is at <b>a</b> <b>high</b> <b>risk</b> of drowning. A related skill is sharing breathing gas with another diver, both as the donor and the recipient. This is usually done with a secondary demand valve carried for this purpose. Technical and professional divers will also {{learn how to use}} a backup gas supply carried in an independent scuba set, known as the emergency gas supply or bailout cylinder.|$|E

5|$|The ACCP {{recommended}} {{treatment for}} three months in those with proximal DVT provoked by surgery. A three-month course is also recommended for those with proximal DVT provoked by a transient risk factor, and three months is suggested over lengthened treatment when bleeding risk is low to moderate.

Those whose first VTE is an unprovoked proximal DVT are suggested for anticoagulation longer than three months unless there is <b>a</b> <b>high</b> <b>risk</b> of bleeding.

Those with a second unprovoked VTE are recommended for extended treatment when bleeding risk is low, suggested for extended treatment when bleeding risk is moderate, and suggested {{for three months}} of anticoagulation in high-risk scenarios.|$|E
