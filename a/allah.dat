5|$|In April 1969 or February 1970, the High Prosecutor's {{office in}} Medan filed charges against Jassin, {{charging}} him with blasphemy {{after he was}} unwilling to divulge Kipandjikusmin's true name. At trial, Jassin argued that, as the story {{was a product of}} the author's imagination, it should not be considered an insult to Islam; he also cited physical descriptions of <b>Allah</b> from the Quran and Sufi literature, as well as the writer's Christian influences. A witness for the prosecution, noted ulama and writer Haji Abdul Malik Karim Amrullah (Hamka), testified that a depiction of <b>Allah</b> wearing glasses implied that <b>Allah</b> was imperfect, as opposed to the personifications cited by Jassin, which were based on man's love for <b>Allah.</b> Hamka later stated that nobody had been able to incite hatred against Muhammad like Kipandjikusmin since the Crusades. Jassin was sentenced to a one-year suspended sentence.|$|E

5|$|Muhammad and {{the other}} prophets of Islam, bored of living in jannah (heaven) and weary of singing the praises of <b>Allah,</b> request {{permission}} to return to Earth. Disappointed by the prophets' request, <b>Allah</b> calls on Muhammad {{to explain why he}} wishes to return, as <b>Allah</b> had already granted him many things. Muhammad replies that he wishes to conduct research, to discover why so few Muslims are coming to heaven. <b>Allah,</b> after removing his glasses, responds that the people had been poisoned by Sukarno's policy of Nasakom and grants Muhammad permission to investigate further.|$|E
5|$|In 1926 Kwee Tek Hoay wrote that, after <b>Allah</b> jang Palsoe, {{the quality}} of stage {{performances}} in the Indies had increased noticeably. Nio notes that the quantity of stage plays by ethnic Chinese authors likewise increased. Though not many were ultimately published, the body of work pioneered by <b>Allah</b> jang Palsoe included plays by Kwee Tek Hoay (Korbannja Kong-Ek, Mait Hidoep, Plesiran Hari Minggoe), Lauw Giok Lan (Pendidikan jang Kliroe), Tio Ie Soei (Jan Tio), and Tjoa Tjien Mo (Beng Lee Koen, Hsi Shih).|$|E
5|$|In Islam, <b>Allah</b> is the unique, omnipotent {{and only}} deity and {{creator of the}} {{universe}} and is equivalent to God in other Abrahamic religions.|$|E

5|$|In a {{preface to}} his 1926 drama Korbannja Kong-Ek (The Victim of Kong-Ek), Kwee Tek Hoay {{wrote that he}} had drawn {{inspiration}} from the realist Norwegian playwright Henrik Ibsen in that work, having read and reread the author's plays. Damono finds signs of Ibsen's influence already present in <b>Allah</b> jang Palsoe. He compares the stage directions in <b>Allah</b> jang Palsoe to those in Ibsen's Hedda Gabler and finds them to be similar in their level of detail.|$|E
5|$|In the 1940s, a {{religious}} movement called <b>Allah</b> Koura {{began in the}} San Cercle based upon the visions of a single person. Local administrators allowed the <b>Allah</b> Koura movement to spread and practice, seeing it as a potential limiting influence on the spread of Islam farther south. In the late 1950s, Muslim protests and riots throughout the colony further contributed to a growing independence movement.|$|E
5|$|Kwee Tek Hoay {{received}} numerous {{letters from}} fans of <b>Allah</b> jang Palsoe, spurring {{him to continue}} writing. Considering the play too difficult for native troupes to stage, when one such troupe, the Union Dalia Opera, requested permission to perform it, Kwee Tek Hoay instead wrote a new story for them. This later became his best-selling novel Boenga Roos dari Tjikembang (The Rose of Cikembang). Another of Kwee Tek Hoay's stage dramas, Korbannja Kong-Ek, {{was inspired by a}} friend, who wrote him a letter asking for another comforting and educational play after reading <b>Allah</b> jang Palsoe.|$|E

5|$|The Fatimid Caliphate {{originated}} in an Ismaili Shia movement launched in Salamiyah, {{on the western}} edge of the Syrian Desert, by Abd <b>Allah</b> al-Akbar, a claimed eight generation descendant of the Islamic prophet Muhammad, through the prophet's daughter Fatimah. In 899 his grandson, to be known as Abd <b>Allah</b> al-Mahdi, became leader of the movement. He fled from his enemies to Sijilmasa in Morocco, where he proselytized under the guise of being a merchant. He was supported by a militant named Abu Abd <b>Allah</b> al-Shi'i, who organized a Berber uprising that overthrew the Tunisian Aghlabid dynasty, and then invited al-Mahdi to assume the position of imam and caliph. The empire grew to include Sicily and to stretch across North Africa from the Atlantic to Libya. The Fatimid caliphs built three capital cities, which they occupied in sequential order: Mahdia (921–948) and al-Mansuriya (948–973) in Ifriqiya and Cairo (973–1169) in Egypt.|$|E
5|$|The {{government}} of Malaysia in 2007 outlawed {{usage of the}} term <b>Allah</b> in any other but Muslim contexts, but the Malayan High Court in 2009 revoked the law, ruling that it was unconstitutional. While <b>Allah</b> had been used for the Christian God in Malay {{for more than four}} centuries, the contemporary controversy was triggered by usage of <b>Allah</b> by the Roman Catholic newspaper The Herald. The government appealed the court ruling, and the High Court suspended implementation of its verdict until the appeal was heard. In October 2013, the court ruled in favor of the government's ban. In early 2014, the Malaysian government confiscated more than 300 bibles for using the word to refer to the Christian God in Peninsular Malaysia. However, the use of <b>Allah</b> is not prohibited in the two Malaysian state of Sabah and Sarawak. The main reason it is not prohibited in these two states is that usage has been long-established and local Alkitab (Bibles) have been widely distributed freely in East Malaysia without restrictions for years. Both states also do not have similar Islamic state laws as those in West Malaysia.|$|E

She came and found him {{sweating}} and his sweat falling on the leather cloth spread on her bed. She opened her scent-bag and began to fill the bottles with it. <b>Allah's</b> Apostle was startled and woke up and said: Umm Sulaim, what are you doing? She said: <b>Allah's</b> Messenger, we seek blessings for our children through it. Thereupon he said: You have done something right. Sahih Muslim.|$|R

5|$|In August 684, the Umayyads {{and their}} tribal allies routed the pro-Zubayrid Qaysi tribes at the Battle of Marj Rahit. The Umayyad victory brought all of Syria under Marwan's authority, but {{also led to}} the long-running feud between Qays and Yaman. Later, Marwan {{dispatched}} an army led by Ubayd <b>Allah</b> to wrest back Iraq. Control of that region was split {{by a number of}} anti-Umayyad factions, including partisans of al-Mukhtar al-Thaqafi, other pro-Alids and Ibn al-Zubayr. Marwan promised Ubayd <b>Allah</b> the governorship of all the territories he conquered. In early January 685, Ubayd <b>Allah</b> was mobilizing his troops at the Euphrates town of Jisr Manbij. Around that time, his second-in-command, Husayn ibn Numayr al-Sakuni, destroyed the Penitents, a pro-Alid band led by Sulayman ibn Surad, at the Battle of 'Ayn al-Warda in modern-day Ras al-Ayn. Marwan died in the spring of 685, while Ubayd Allah's army was camped at Raqqa, and Marwan's son Abd al-Malik succeeded him as caliph.|$|E
5|$|Kwee Tek Hoay's {{first stage}} play, <b>Allah</b> jang Palsoe was written as a realist {{response}} to whimsical contemporary theatres. Though the published stageplay sold poorly {{and the play}} was deemed difficult to perform, <b>Allah</b> jang Palsoe found success on the stage. By 1930 it had been performed by various ethnic Chinese troupes to popular acclaim and pioneered {{a body of work}} by authors such as Lauw Giok Lan, Tio Ie Soei, and Tjoa Tjien Mo. In 2006 the script for the play, which continues to be performed, was republished with updated spelling by the Lontar Foundation.|$|E
5|$|The Muslim {{civil war}} left the Umayyad realm {{restricted}} to Damascus {{and its environs}} after most of their territories came under Ibn al-Zubayr's orbit. However, an Umayyad resurgence began with the accession of Caliph Marwan I, who dispatched an army led by Ubayd <b>Allah</b> ibn Ziyad to reconquer Iraq. This army's advance into Mosul precipitated the Battle of Khazir and its commander, Ubayd <b>Allah,</b> was an enemy of al-Mukhtar's pro-Alid partisans. Thus, al-Mukhtar quickly moved to halt the Umayyad advance, sending his Persian mawali-dominated forces led by Ibrahim ibn al-Ashtar to confront the predominantly Syrian Arab army of the Umayyads. During the initial combat, part of Ibn al-Ashtar's forces were put to flight, but then regrouped under his command and charged against the Umayyad center. This resulted in heavy casualties {{on both sides and}} Ubayd <b>Allah</b> and several of his lieutenants were slain. The Umayyad commander Umayr ibn al-Hubab and his Sulaymi tribesmen deserted while the pro-Alids pursued the remaining Umayyad troops, scores of whom drowned in the Khazir River.|$|E
