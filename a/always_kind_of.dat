He's always so positive and so sure and he never wants to repeat himself. Like, 'How can I make something different and new and not like anything else?' I look back at that whole record, and I think, 'Wow I wish there was more time to do more singles.' You only get {{so many things that}} people hear.|$|E
500|$|Madonna and Bray {{started on}} the {{re-recording}} and changed some portion of the lyrics. Bray commented on the recording sessions as: [...] "I've <b>always</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> made the rib cage and the skeleton [...] of the song already– she's there for the last things like the eyebrows and the haircut [...] She writes in a stream of mood really." [...] "Into the Groove" [...] was recorded at Sigma Sound Studios. Madonna's friend Erika Belle was present during the recording and watched the whole process. In Andrew Morton's Madonna biography, she noted {{that at one point}} of the recording, Bray was facing difficulties with the bridge of the song, as the melody thought by him was not syncing {{with the rest of the}} composition. Undeterred by his obvious difficulties, Madonna stepped up to the microphone and sang the words [...] "Live out your fantasy here with me". Bray's problem was solved; Belle remembered the experience as: [...] " [...] seemed to come out of her, I was awestruck." ...|$|E
500|$|Plans for Lopez {{to release}} a Spanish {{language}} album materialized in 2004, when Lopez's then-husband Marc Anthony was finishing up production of his ninth studio album Amar Sin Mentiras (2004) with Estéfano and Julio Reyes. Lopez went into the recording studio with them to record a song entitled [...] "Escapémonos", as a duet with Anthony. She enjoyed working on the song {{so much that she}} decided to record a full-length Spanish album; something she had wanted to do for years. Prior to breaking out into the music scene in May 1999 with her single [...] "If You Had My Love", Lopez always pictured her music career to be in Spanish. According to Lopez: [...] "My life took a different turn, which was great for me. But my heart was <b>always</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> on the Spanish side." [...] Before recording began for her first Spanish album, Lopez recorded and released her fourth English studio album Rebirth (2005).|$|E

500|$|The song's {{music video}} was {{directed}} by film-maker Brett Ratner in Los Angeles, and features a cameo appearance from 30 Rock's Jack McBrayer. Prior to filming the video, or releasing the single, Carey had toned her body, and lost a reported twenty pounds. Due to her slim-down, she and Ratner wanted to flaunt Carey's new figure {{as much as possible}} throughout the video: [...] "Mariah looks better than she has ever looked. It's ridiculous. Mariah has an incredible body, but she was <b>always</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> very voluptuous. Now she's just like, fit. And we were like, we've got to show this body." [...] As the pair came up with the video's plot, Ratner contacted McBrayer to play a male leading role, alongside Carey. After receiving the call, McBrayer claimed he was so shocked by the proposal, that he didn't believe it at first. He only met with the producers after Ratner personally called him and assured him the authenticity of the offer. In an interview with MTV News, McBrayer joked [...] "I'm always worried now that somebody is pranking me, so at first I was very leery. But when I heard it was legit, and then later on we {{got a phone call from}} Brett Ratner, who directed it. I was like, 'This is either a very elaborate prank, or this is the real deal.'" [...] In the fantasy-themed story, he recalled what he considered the video's most memorable scene, in which he and Carey, dressed in medieval attire, were walking with a unicorn. Additionally, he described the filming process as very simple, as they were given very loose directions and pointers. McBrayer claimed that during one take, they were meant to play Frisbee on the mansion lawn, and he accidentally threw it at Carey's face, jokingly adding [...] "by the time she spins back around — bonk, right in her face. I threw a Frisbee in Mariah Carey's face! I'm like, I'm fired!." [...] When questioned by critics regarding the song and video, Carey responded [...] "Have you seen the 'Touch My Body' video? C'mon. Clearly you must see the humour in that. Even the lyrics, 'I will hunt you down'. If anyone doesn't get the joke by this time then they are an idiot." [...] In an interview with Reuters, Carey described working with Ratner, and her experience filming the video: ...|$|E
500|$|According to Taraborrelli, [...] "Madonna and Rodgers' {{collective}} energy—she {{wanting to}} score with a smash second album and he {{wanting to be}} the producer {{to give it to}} her—drove the production of Like a Virgin with great precision." [...] Madonna also collaborated with her former boyfriend Steve Bray, who co-wrote many of the album's songs. Reflecting on the music composition for the album, Bray noted: [...] "I've <b>always</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> made the rib cage and the skeleton of the songs already—she's there for the last things like the eyebrows and the haircut." [...] The opening track [...] "Material Girl" [...] was written by Peter Brown and Roberta Rans. Madonna explained that the concept of the song was similar to her life's situation at that time. According to her, the song was provocative, hence she was attracted to it. [...] "Material Girl" [...] incorporated new wave music and consists of synth arrangements with a robotic voice repeating the hook. The lyrics identify with materialism, with Madonna asking for a rich and affluent life, rather than romance and relationships. Written by Madonna and Steve Bray, [...] "Angel" [...] is the second track on the album. It {{was one of the first}} songs developed for the project and, according to Madonna, was inspired by a girl who is saved by, and subsequently falls in love with an angel. [...] "Angel" [...] consists of a three-chord ascending hook, which serves as the verse and chorus. It has vocal harmonies beneath the main chorus and the lyrics repeat the angel-like image of Madonna's savior. The title track [...] "Like a Virgin" [...] was written by Billy Steinberg and Tom Kelly. Steinberg said that the song was inspired by his personal experiences of romance. It was chosen for Madonna by Michael Ostin of Warner Bros. Records, after listening to a demo sung by Kelly. However, Rodgers initially felt that the song did not have a good enough hook and was not suitable for Madonna, but subsequently changed his opinion after the hook was stuck in his mind. He credits Madonna with recognizing the song's potential: [...] "I handed my apology to Madonna and said, 'you know... if it's so catchy that it stayed in my head for four days, it must be something. So let's do it.'" [...] "Like a Virgin" [...] is a dance-oriented song, composed of two hooks. Madonna's voice is heard in a high register while a continuous arrangement of drums are heard along the bassline. According to author Rikky Rooksby, the lyrics of the song are ambiguous and consist of hidden innuendo. In sexual terms, the lyrics can be interpreted in different ways for different people.|$|E

Nas said of the collaboration in an interview [...] "I was a big fan of his father and of course all the children, all the offspring, and Damian, I kind of looked at Damian as a rap guy. His stuff is not really singing, or if he does, it comes off more hard, like on some street shit. I always liked how reggae and hip-hop have always been intertwined and <b>always</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> pushed each other, I always liked the connection. I'd worked with people before from the reggae world but when I worked with Damian, the whole workout was perfect". A portion of the profit was planned to go towards building a school in Africa. He {{went on to say that}} it was [...] "too early to tell the title or anything like that". The Los Angeles Times reported that the album would be titled Distant Relatives.|$|E

[...] In January 2015, after Orci's departure, Simon Pegg and Doug Jung were hired to rewrite the screenplay, with Pegg saying on the previous draft, Paramount [...] "had a script for Star Trek that wasn't really working for them. I think the studio was worried that it might have been a little bit too Star Trek-y." [...] Pegg had been asked to make the new film [...] "more inclusive", stating that the solution was to [...] "make a western or a thriller or a heist movie, then populate that with Star Trek characters so it's more inclusive to an audience that might be a little bit reticent." ...|$|E
