5|$|The second {{approach}} {{to the problem of}} sets belonging to themselves took as its base the notion of class, and defines a set <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>class</b> which belongs to other classes, while a proper class is defined <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>class</b> which does not belong to other classes. Under the Zermelo–Fraenkel approach, the axioms impede the construction of a set of all sets which do not belong to themselves. In contrast, under the von Neumann approach, the class of all sets which do not belong to themselves can be constructed, but it is a proper class and not a set.|$|E
5|$|A Class 31 locomotive, number 31296, {{was named}} 'Amlwch Freighter'/'Trên Nwyddau Amlwch' in September 1986 at the Associated Octel plant. At this point, 33 {{years after the}} opening of the Octel plant at Amlwch, 2 million tonnes of traffic had been {{conveyed}} from their freight terminal. A scale model was produced by Lima with this nameplate affixed. The name was removed in March 1990 and transferred to the Class 47 locomotive 47330, which was renumbered 47390 for a period, retaining the name.

5|$|As {{is typical}} of an Indo-European language, English follows accusative morphosyntactic alignment. Unlike other Indo-European {{languages}} though, English has largely abandoned the inflectional case system in favor of analytic constructions. Only the personal pronouns retain morphological case more strongly than any other word class. English distinguishes at least seven major word classes: verbs, nouns, adjectives, adverbs, determiners (including articles), prepositions, and conjunctions. Some analyses add pronouns <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>class</b> separate from nouns, and subdivide conjunctions into subordinators and coordinators, and add the class of interjections. English also has a rich set of auxiliary verbs, such as have and do, expressing the categories of mood and aspect. Questions are marked by do-support, wh-movement (fronting of question words beginning with wh-) and word order inversion with some verbs.|$|E

5|$|Cnidarians {{were for}} a long time grouped with Ctenophores in the phylum Coelenterata, but {{increasing}} awareness of their differences caused them to be placed in separate phyla. Modern cnidarians are generally classified into four main classes: sessile Anthozoa (sea anemones, corals, sea pens); swimming Scyphozoa (jellyfish) and Cubozoa (box jellies); and Hydrozoa, a diverse group that includes all the freshwater cnidarians as well as many marine forms, and has both sessile members such as Hydra and colonial swimmers such as the Portuguese Man o' War. Staurozoa have recently been recognised <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>class</b> in their own right rather than a sub-group of Scyphozoa, and the parasitic Myxozoa and Polypodiozoa are now recognized as highly derived cnidarians rather than more closely related to the bilaterians.|$|E

5|$|As {{a part of}} the Pennsylvania system, the CL {{continued}} to operate its own property (which included the line north of Dodds after 1914) until January 1, 1921, when it was leased to the Pennsylvania. Starting at the end of 1918, the Interstate Commerce Commission classified the CL <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>Class</b> I railroad, meaning that it made at least $1 million per year in operating revenue. (This designation was dropped in 1921 when the CL was leased.) However, net operating income, revenue minus costs, which had steadily climbed from the 1890s, began falling in 1916, becoming a deficit in 1920. Subsequently, effective January 1, 1926, the Pennsylvania merged the CL with several other small companies—the Cleveland, Akron and Cincinnati Railway, Manufacturers Railway, Pennsylvania-Detroit Railroad, and Toledo, Columbus and Ohio River Railroadto create the Pennsylvania, Ohio and Detroit Railroad, a non-operating subsidiary. That company was merged into the Connecting Railway, previously a short link in Philadelphia, in 1956, and its lessee merged with the New York Central Railroad in 1968 to form Penn Central Transportation.|$|E

5|$|Genetic {{analysis}} performed since the 1990s has extended {{the understanding of}} the relationship between different organisms. It is now clear the brachiopods do not belong to the Deuterostomata (such as echinoderms and chordates) as was hypothesized earlier, but {{should be included in the}} Protostomia (with mollusks and annelid worms), in a subgroup now called Lophotrochozoa. Although their adult morphology seems rather different, the nucleotid sequence of the 18S rRNA indicates that the horseshoe worms are the closest relatives of the inarticulate brachiopods rather than articulate brachiopods. For now, the weight of evidence is inconclusive as to the exact relations within the inarticulates. Consequently, it has been suggested to included horseshoe worms in the Brachiopoda <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>class</b> named Phoronata B.L.Cohen in addition to the Craniata and Lingulata, within the subphylum Linguliformea. The other subphylum Rhynchonelliformea only contains one class, which is subdivided in the orders Rhynchonellida, Terebratulida and Thecideida.|$|E
5|$|In 1923, John von Neumann {{developed}} an axiom system that eliminates the paradoxes {{by using an}} approach similar to Cantor's—namely, by identifying collections that are not sets and treating them differently. Von Neumann stated that a class is too big to be a set {{if it can be}} put into one-to-one correspondence with the class of all sets. He defined a set <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>class</b> that is a member of some class and stated the axiom: A class is not a set if and only if there is a one-to-one correspondence between it and the class of all sets. This axiom implies that these big classes are not sets, which eliminates the paradoxes since they cannot be members of any class. Von Neumann also used his axiom to prove the well-ordering theorem: Like Cantor, he assumed that the ordinals form a set. The resulting contradiction implies that the class of all ordinals is not a set. Then his axiom provides a one-to-one correspondence between this class and the class of all sets. This correspondence well-orders the class of all sets, which implies the well-ordering theorem. In 1930, Zermelo defined models of set theory that satisfy von Neumann's axiom.|$|E

The firm also located and supplied critical research to the Veterans' lead expert, Dr. Codario, including about 100 articles from toxicology journals dating back more than a decade, as well as data about where herbicides had been sprayed, what the effects of dioxin had been on animals and humans, and every accident in factories where herbicides were produced or dioxin was a contaminant of some chemical reaction.|$|E

5|$|The {{earliest}} {{inhabitants of}} what is now Rwanda were the Twa, a group of aboriginal pygmy hunter-gatherers who settled the area between 8000 and 3000BC and remain in the country today. Between 700BC and 1500AD, a number of Bantu groups migrated into Rwanda and began clearing forests for agriculture. After losing much of their habitat, the forest-dwelling Twa moved to the mountains. Historians have several theories about the Bantu migrations. According to one, the first settlers were Hutu; the Tutsi migrated later and formed a distinct racial group, possibly of Cushitic origin. An alternative theory is that the migration was slow and steady, with incoming groups integrating into (rather than conquering) the existing society. In this theory the Hutu-Tutsi distinction arose later <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>class</b> distinction, rather than a racial one.|$|E
