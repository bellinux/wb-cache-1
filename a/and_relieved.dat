The German-installed NDH government called on all Croats to stop fighting, and in the evening, LI Infantry Corps entered Zagreb <b>and</b> <b>relieved</b> the 14th Panzer Division.|$|E
5|$|Numerous other {{battles that}} {{occurred}} in the modern state of Indiana include the Siege of Fort Wayne, the Pigeon Roost Massacre and the Battle of the Mississinewa. Most of the Native Americans remained passive throughout the war, but there were many incidents between settlers and the tribes, leading to the deaths of hundreds in the territory. The Treaty of Ghent, signed in 1814, ended the War <b>and</b> <b>relieved</b> American settlers from their fears of the nearby British and their Indian allies.|$|E
5|$|On August 1, 1763, {{most of the}} Native Americans {{broke off}} the siege at Fort Pitt in order to {{intercept}} 500 British troops marching to the fort under Colonel Bouquet. On August 5, these two forces met at the Battle of Bushy Run. Although his force suffered heavy casualties, Bouquet fought off the attack <b>and</b> <b>relieved</b> Fort Pitt on August 20, bringing the siege to an end. His victory at Bushy Run was celebrated in the British colonies—church bells rang through the night in Philadelphia—and praised by King George.|$|E

5|$|The Song {{military}} was chiefly organized {{to ensure that}} the army could not threaten Imperial control, often at the expense of effectiveness in war. Northern Song's Military Council operated under a Chancellor, who had no control over the imperial army. The imperial army was divided among three marshals, each independently responsible to the Emperor. Since the Emperor rarely led campaigns personally, Song forces lacked unity of command. The imperial court often believed that successful generals endangered royal authority, <b>and</b> <b>relieved</b> or even executed them (notably Li Gang, Yue Fei, and Han Shizhong).|$|E
5|$|Upon his {{election}} as lieutenant governor, Patton resigned his office as Pike County judge-executive. While {{presiding over the}} Senate in the 1991 legislative session, Patton voted against a mandatory seat belt law, breaking a 19–19 tie. He was the last Kentucky lieutenant governor to preside over the Kentucky Senate; a 1992 amendment to the state constitution created a new position, President of the Kentucky Senate, <b>and</b> <b>relieved</b> the lieutenant governor of his duties in that body.|$|E

5|$|At {{this time}} the 6th Brigade– {{consisting}} of the 19th, 36th and 14th/32nd Battalions– was led by Brigadier Raymond Sandover. A Militia formation, it had not previously seen combat as a whole, though one of its infantry battalions– the 36th– had fought in the Battle of Buna–Gona during late 1942 and early 1943. Nevertheless, Sandover and his three battalion commanders were all Australian Imperial Force veterans who had taken part in the fighting against the Germans and Italians in North Africa, Greece and Syria during 1941 and 1942. The 36th Battalion was dispatched to Cape Hoskins in early October, <b>and</b> <b>relieved</b> a battalion of the US 158th Infantry Regiment.|$|E
5|$|Charlemagne {{was less}} {{severely}} damaged and was repaired at Bizerte, {{returning to the}} Dardanelles in May. Saint Louis arrived that same month and both ships provided fire support for French troops ashore. Charlemagne was transferred to Salonica in October 1915 where she joined the French squadron assigned to prevent any interference by the Greeks with Allied operations in Greece. Saint Louis departed for a refit in Lorient that same month <b>and</b> <b>relieved</b> Charlemagne at Salonica in May 1916 so the latter could be refitted in Bizerte. Gaulois remained at the Dardanelles until August, covering the evacuation of Allied troops from Gallipoli {{at the end of}} 1915, when she started a refit at Brest.|$|E
5|$|Held up by {{freezing}} {{weather and}} snow storms, on 10 April, {{on the following}} day LI Infantry Corps was approaching Zagreb from the north, and bicycle-mounted troops of the 183rd Infantry Division had turned east to capture Varaždin, along with an entire Yugoslav brigade including its commanding general. On the same day, the German-installed interim Croatian government called on all Croats to stop fighting, and in the evening, LI Infantry Corps entered Zagreb <b>and</b> <b>relieved</b> the 14th Panzer Division. In the face of the assault by the 14th Panzer Division, the 4th Army quickly ceased to exist as an operational formation. The disintegration of the 4th Army was caused largely by fifth column activity, as it was involved in little fighting.|$|E

5|$|Kamianets-Podilskyi Castle {{played an}} {{important}} role during the Khmelnytsky Uprising between 1648–54, when the Zaporozhian Cossacks led by Hetman Bohdan Khmelnytsky, allied themselves with the Crimean Tatars and the local Ukrainian peasantry against the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth's army and militia. During the uprising, the castle was unsuccessfully besieged by local Cossacks and insurgents led by Commander Maksym Kryvonis. In 1651, the castle was then subject to another Cossack siege led by Hetman Ivan Bohun, before an unexpected counterattack by Polish insurgents under commanders Aleksandrenka and Chuika re-established the Polish presence in the area <b>and</b> <b>relieved</b> the siege. A 60,000 force army led by Khmelnytsky himself reasserted Cossack control over the castle in 1652. Just one year later, the castle was attacked yet again, this time by a 40,000 strong Crimean Tatar horde.|$|E
5|$|Montagu joined Warwick in escorting the chariot of six {{horses in}} the funeral cortege {{conveying}} the mortal remains of their father and brother from Pontefract Castle to the family mausoleum at Bisham Abbey, on 14–15 February 1463. On 6 May he was appointed Warden of the Eastern March; Warwick was his counterpart on the western marches. Later that year, he led an expedition to Norham Castle, which had been besieged by the Scots for the previous eighteen days, <b>and</b> <b>relieved</b> it on 26 July; {{this was followed by}} a Chevauchée into Scotland which only ceased when Montagu's force ran out of supplies.|$|E
5|$|On {{the morning}} of 26 May, the German columns {{advancing}} from Bihać towards Ključ, and from Livno and Knin towards Bosansko Grahovo, overcame the Partisan units in their paths, and continued their advance facing little resistance. The 92nd Motorised Grenadier Regiment, advancing from Vrtoče, took Bosanski Petrovac without a fight about 8:00. It continued its march to Drvar <b>and</b> <b>relieved</b> the 500th SS Parachute Battalion at 12:45. Kampfgruppe Willam established radio contact with the 500th SS Battalion around 07:00, and at 17:00 entered Drvar via Kamenica. The 105th SS Reconnaissance Battalion arrived at Bosansko Grahovo at 10:30, where it was joined by the 1st Regiment of the Brandenburg Division at 16:00.

Japan sent a monetary gift of $9 million while Italy had {{plans to build a}} prefabricated village for the victims, and West Germany offered to send more than a dozen heavy cranes. The Americans donated generously as well, with Washington dispatching eight official planeloads of official relief aid plus a Lockheed C-141 Starlifter from Italy. Private donations from the United States were also significant. Chrysler chairman Lee Iacocca arranged for a fund drive, and in Chicago (one of five major Armenian population centers in the US) the community raised $800,000 and donated 20,000 pounds of supplies.|$|E
5|$|The geographical, {{engineering}} and logistical difficulties of conducting operations in SWPA were driven home by Alamo Force's first operation, Operation Chronicle, {{the occupation of}} Woodlark and Kiriwina Islands in June 1943. Despite {{the fact that the}} operation was unopposed by the Japanese, it was subject to delays. Krueger visited Kiriwina, where road work and airbase development were held up by heavy rains, on 11 July. He was dissatisfied with the rate of progress <b>and</b> <b>relieved</b> the task force commander. The arrival of additional engineers sped up the base development effort, and No. 79 Squadron RAAF commenced operations from Kiriwina on 18 August.|$|E
5|$|The {{war between}} Tecumseh and Harrison {{merged with the}} War of 1812 when the {{remnants}} of the Indian Confederation allied with the British in Canada. The Siege of Fort Harrison is considered to be the United States' first land victory during the war. Other battles that occurred in the modern state of Indiana include the Siege of Fort Wayne, the Pigeon Roost Massacre and the Battle of the Mississinewa. The Treaty of Ghent, signed in 1814, ended the war <b>and</b> <b>relieved</b> American settlers from their fears of the nearby British and their Indian allies. This marked the end of hostilities with the Native Americans in Indiana. Of the 58 recorded incidents between Native Americans and the United States in Indiana during the 19thcentury, 43 were Indian victories.|$|E
