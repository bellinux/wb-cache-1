2500|$|While both {{need to be}} registered, the {{distinction}} between a fixed and a floating charge matters greatly because floating charges are subordinated by the Insolvency Act 1986 to insolvency practitioners' expenses under section 176ZA, preferential creditors (employees' wages up to £800 per person, pension contributions and the EU coal and steel levies) under section 175 and Schedule 6 and unsecured creditors' claims up {{to a maximum of}} £600,000 under section 176A. The floating charge was invented as a form <b>of</b> security in <b>the</b> late nineteenth century, as a concept which would apply to <b>the</b> whole <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>assets</b> <b>of</b> an <b>undertaking.</b> <b>The</b> leading company law case, Salomon v A Salomon & Co Ltd, exemplified that a floating charge holder (even if it was the director and almost sole shareholder <b>of</b> <b>the</b> company) could enforce their priority ahead of all other persons. As Lord MacNaghten said, [...] "Everybody knows that when there is a winding-up debenture-holders generally step in and sweep off everything; and a great scandal it is." [...] Parliament responded with the Preferential Payments in Bankruptcy Amendment Act 1897, which created a new category of preferential creditors - at the time, employees and the tax authorities - who would be able to collect their debts after fixed charge holders, but before floating charge holders. In interpreting <b>the</b> scope <b>of</b> a floating charge the leading case was Re Yorkshire Woolcombers Association Ltd where a receiver contended an instrument was void because it had not been registered. Romer LJ agreed, and held that <b>the</b> hallmarks <b>of</b> a floating charge were that (1) assets were charged present and future and (2) change in <b>the</b> ordinary course <b>of</b> business, and most importantly (3) until a step is taken by the charge holder [...] "the company may carry on its business in the ordinary way". A floating charge is not, technically speaking, a true security until a date of its [...] "crystallisation", when it metaphorically descends and [...] "fixes" [...] onto the assets in a business' possession at that time.|$|R
