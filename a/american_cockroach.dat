5|$|Cockroaches are {{generally}} omnivorous; the <b>American</b> <b>cockroach</b> (Periplaneta americana), for example, feeds {{on a great}} variety of foodstuffs including bread, fruit, leather, starch in book bindings, paper, glue, skin flakes, hair, dead insects and soiled clothing. Many species of cockroach harbor symbiotic protozoans and bacteria in their gut which are able to digest cellulose. In many species, these symbionts may be essential if the insect is to utilize cellulose; however, some species secrete cellulase in their saliva, and the wood-eating cockroach, Panesthia cribrata, is able to survive indefinitely on a diet of crystallized cellulose while being free of micro-organisms.|$|E

2500|$|Lolines are insecticidal and {{deterrent}} {{to a broad}} range of insects, including species in the Hemiptera, Coleoptera, Hymenoptera, Lepidoptera, and Blattodea, such as the bird cherry-oat aphid (genus Rhopalosiphum), large milkweed bug (Oncopeltus fasciatus), and <b>American</b> <b>cockroach</b> (Periplaneta americana). LC50 values of N-formylloline or N-acetylloline from grass seed extracts are 1-20µg/ml for aphids and milkweed bugs and impair insect development and fecundity and cause avoidance of loline-containing grass tissues. [...] However, results of feeding tests with grass extracts are occasionally difficult to interpret due to the presence of other endophyte alkaloids in these extracts, and the exact mechanisms of the insecticidal actions of the lolines are unknown. The lolines may be neurotoxic to the insects, and differences in the chemical groups at the C-1-amine result in different levels of insect toxicity; for example, N-formylloline (see Fig. 2), which occurs in higher concentrations in endophyte-infected grass plants, has greater insect toxicity than some other lolines, which occur at lower concentrations in the grass plant.|$|E

40|$|Background: <b>American</b> <b>cockroaches</b> {{are found}} in {{association}} with human dwellings and hospitals. They have a worldwide distribution. These domestic pests affect human health in several ways. Their habits make them ideal mechanical carriers of different pathogenic microorganisms. Numerous bacteria of medical importance have been isolated from cockroaches. Objectives: The objective {{of this research was}} to determine the role of <b>American</b> <b>cockroaches</b> as carriers of pathogenic bacteria. This was accomplished through the isolation and identification of these microorganisms from the external surfaces of cockroaches captured in Health and Medical Services Centers and their surroundings. Materials and Methods: Seventy-three cockroaches were caught in Health and Medical Services Centers in Khorramshahr County, southwestern Iran, in 2006. The fluid used to wash the external surfaces of cockroaches was cultured to isolate and identify bacterial pathogens. Results: Pathogenic bacteria were isolated from the external surfaces of 100 % of the <b>American</b> <b>cockroaches</b> examined. The following bacterial pathogens were recovered from their body surface:Klebsiella (47. 9 %), Pseudomonas (37 %), Escherichia coli (30. 1 %), Staphylococcus (24. 6 %), Enterobacter (19. 2 %), Streptococcus (15. 1 %), Serratia (8. 2 %), Bacillus (4. 1 %), and Proteus (2. 7 %). Conclusions: The bacterial pathogenic flora isolated from this cockroach species indicate that domestic pests could pose a health problem to humans. Thus, we must control cockroaches, particularly in indoors, sewage and solid wastes...|$|R
