The {{purpose of}} this study was to determine, by means of a review of {{literature}} and empirical research, the impact of dietary interventions on the classroom health promotion of Foundation Phase learners with <b>ADD.</b> <b>In</b> order to reach this goal, it was imperative to illustrate the meaning of the concepts health, wellness, health promoting schools, nutrition and Attention Deficit Disorder (ADD). The objective of the empirical research was to determine whether dietary interventions would promote the health of Foundation Phase learners with <b>ADD</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> classroom by focusing on decreasing their levels of hyperactivity, increasing their concentration and improving their social behaviour. <b>In</b> conclusion, <b>the</b> following are some of the findings of this study. Dietary interventions impacted positively on: the hyperactivity level of participating foundation phase learners with <b>ADD</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> classroom; the ability of participating foundation phase learners with <b>ADD</b> to concentrate <b>in</b> <b>the</b> classroom; and the social behaviour of participating foundation phase learners with <b>ADD</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> classroom.

It is viewed by senior RAF officers as a significant design success, that to enable and control the aircraft's vertical flight required only a single lever <b>added</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> cockpit. For horizontal flight, the nozzles are directed rearwards by shifting the lever to the forward position; for short or vertical takeoffs and landings, the lever is pulled back to point the nozzles downwards.|$|E
