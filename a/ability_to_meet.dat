5|$|For {{those who}} are single when injured or who become single, SCI causes {{difficulties}} and insecurities with respect to one's <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> <b>meet</b> new partners and start relationships. In some settings, beauty standards cause people to view disabled bodies as less attractive, limiting the options for sexual and romantic partners {{of people with disabilities}} like SCI. Furthermore, physical disabilities are stigmatized, causing people to avoid contact with disabled people, particularly those with highly visible conditions like SCI. The stigma may cause people with SCI to experience self-consciousness and embarrassment in public. They can increase their social success by using impression management techniques to change how they are perceived and create a more positive image of themselves in others' eyes. Physical limitations create difficulties; with lowered independence comes reduced social interaction and fewer opportunities to find partners. Difficulties with mobility and the lack of disabled accessibility of social spaces (e.g. lack of wheelchair ramps) create a further barrier to social activity and limit the <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> <b>meet</b> partners. Isolation and its associated risk of depression can be limited by participating in physical activities, social gatherings, clubs, and online chat and dating.|$|E

The Carpi and Sarmatians whom Rome had held at bay were replaced by the Goths and likewise the Quadi and Marcomanni that Rome had defeated were replaced by the greater confederation of the Alamanni.|$|E

Attorney Jiang Tianyong has noted that cases where the defendants are Falun Gong practitioners are decided by the local 610 Offices, rather than through recourse to legal standards. In November 2008, two lawyers seeking to represent Falun Gong practitioners in Heilongjiang noted that the presiding judge in the case was seen meeting with 610 Office agents.

5|$|The AV-8B {{underwent}} standard evaluation {{to prepare}} for its USMC service. In the operational evaluation (OPEVAL), lasting from 31 August 1984 to 30 March 1985, four pilots {{and a group of}} maintenance and support personnel tested the aircraft under combat conditions. The aircraft was graded for its <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> <b>meet</b> its mission requirements for navigating, acquiring targets, delivering weapons, and evading and surviving enemy actions, all at the specified range and payload limits. The first phase of OPEVAL, running until 1 February 1985, required the AV-8B to fly both deep and close air support missions (deep air support missions do not require coordination with friendly ground forces) in concert with other close-support aircraft, as well as flying battlefield interdiction and armed reconnaissance missions. The aircraft flew from military installations at Marine Corps Base Camp Pendleton and Naval Air Weapons Station China Lake in California, Canadian Forces Base Cold Lake in Canada, and MCAS Yuma in Arizona.|$|E

Consequently, the Air Force sought an aerial tanker with greater capabilities than the KC-135. In 1972, two DC-10s were flown in trials at Edwards Air Force Base, simulating air refuelings to check for possible wake issues. Boeing performed similar tests with a 747.|$|E

40|$|This study {{investigated}} {{the degree to which}} girls' artistic gymnastics clubs of Quebec are meeting the expectations currently held of them. Parents of participants and coaches from three clubs in each of three different geographic regions were asked to fill out questionnaires. Respondents were asked to rate {{the degree to which they}} felt clubs were meeting participants' needs in four categories of objectives. The categories were: Participation, Program, Instruction and Development. Comparisons were made between groups of respondents and geographic regions. An analysis of variance was done on the data in each of the four categories. While the percentage of returns from both parents and coaches was discouraging, it was found that, in general, both instructors and parents are satisfied with what their clubs are providing. In all categories of objectives the ratings obtained were high. The analysis showed a significant difference between parents and coaches in the Participation category as well as between geographic regions for the Instruction category. It was found that coaches have a more favorable opinion than do parents of their clubs' <b>abilities</b> <b>to</b> <b>meet</b> Participation needs. It was also determined that respondents from the urban area had more positive attitudes toward their clubs' <b>abilities</b> <b>to</b> <b>meet</b> participants' Instruction needs than did those from the rural region...|$|R

This began with the first production model, which included several vents that Lamborghini found necessary to cool the engine adequately. These included the iconic NACA duct on the doors and rear fenders. The car design changes ended with a large engine vent directly behind the driver, reducing the rear view. Later additionsâ€”including fender flares, spoilers, carburetor covers, and bumpersâ€”progressively changed the car's aesthetic values.|$|E
25|$|Coutts {{describes}} dreams {{as playing}} {{a central role}} in a two-phase sleep process that improves the mind's <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> <b>meet</b> human needs during wakefulness. During the accommodation phase, mental schemas self-modify by incorporating dream themes. During the emotional selection phase, dreams test prior schema accommodations. Those that appear adaptive are retained, while those that appear maladaptive are culled. The cycle maps to the sleep cycle, repeating several times during a typical night's sleep. Alfred Adler suggested that dreams are often emotional preparations for solving problems, intoxicating an individual away from common sense toward private logic. The residual dream feelings may either reinforce or inhibit contemplated action.|$|E
25|$|A {{probationary}} {{condition that}} a defendant testify under oath on all {{questions as to}} his financial condition relating to amounts and locations of all assets was upheld as legal because the defendant made a blanket refusal to answer any questions, and therefore {{it could not be}} shown that his right against self-incrimination under the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution was violated by any particular question. It was ruled that a court did not abuse its discretion in requiring, as a condition of supervised release, that the defendant report financial obligations in excess of $250 incurred by his wife. The condition was held to serve a legitimate monitoring purpose in light of the defendant's history of masking his income and ownership of assets, and the financial information was also deemed necessary for evaluating the defendant's <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> <b>meet</b> his restitution schedule.|$|E

25|$|From {{the very}} {{beginning}} of its existence, the partisan intelligence had been aimed chiefly at serving the Red Army operational purposes. It had frequently been asked to provide detailed information on enemyâ€™s whereabouts, strengths, armaments, movements and intentions. Yet, the partisansâ€™ <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> <b>meet</b> the expectations of military consumers was limited. In 1941-1942, they relied chiefly on field intelligence â€“ foot patrols, observation and questioning of local population â€“ and only from late 1942 onwards succeeded in developing human intelligence capabilities. Unfortunately, the majority of their agents and collaborators were illiterate farmers and laborers unprepared for intelligence work. Technological means of collection such as communications interceptors and night vision devices were used by the partisans only on rare occasions. Besides, the wide scale deployment and high efficiency of the German security services limited the partisansâ€™ gathering capabilities in the military field to the rural areas, almost completely preventing their access to the Wehrmachtâ€™s bases and decision making centers.|$|E

In many cases airport capacity is already fully used in meeting current demand. At Heathrow and Gatwick airports the runways are full for [...] "â€¦ virtually the whole day". In 2003 the runway at Birmingham airport was expected to reach full capacity by 2009 at the latest, whilst terminal capacity at Edinburgh airport had reached its limit. Government forecasts that year predicted that by 2030 the number of passengers could rise to between 400million passengers per annum (mppa) and 600 mppa, representing a two to threefold increase, and a figure of 500 mppa by 2030 was regarded by the government as robust. In 2006 the government reported that at 228 mppa the demand for air travel the previous year was in line with the 2003 forecast, but also revised the forecast demand for 2030 downwards to 465 mppa as a result of capacity constraints, even taking into account proposed airport developments.|$|E
