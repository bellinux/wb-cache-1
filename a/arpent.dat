25|$|The <b>arpent</b> (58.464 m), {{the unit}} of {{measurement}} employed {{in the first years}} of colonisation, fell out of use in several decades. In this context, new standards were ripe for appearance. Among these were the geometric footstep and above all the gaulette (4.872 m), an agrarian unit that continued to be used on a daily basis through the end of the 20th century.|$|E
25|$|Early landowners in St. Louis were {{required}} to enclose their lots with wooden or stone fencing for security reasons, and lots contained sheds, barns, vegetable gardens and sometimes fruit trees. No retail or commercial district existed, and business generally was conducted in homes or in the market square. Houses ranged from one-room huts to large, multiroom buildings such as Laclède's stone headquarters. Most homes, however, were square, of poteaux-en-terre construction, and with steep oak shingle roofs with long overhangs in typical Creole design. The residents depended on common land south of the town for firewood and pasture land, which extended from Third Street west nearly three miles, north to Mill Creek, and south for several miles until the 1790s when it was truncated for the new settlement of Carondelet, Missouri. The commons were continually reduced in size after the mid-1780s due to land grants to new settlers, and the remaining land not granted became Lafayette Park in 1838. In addition to access to the commons, each lot owner was granted individual use of a field strip measuring one <b>arpent</b> wide and forty arpents long. Each strip {{was part of a}} larger group of fields that were platted at the same time; a total of four such fields were created between 1766 and 1769, and by the 1790s nearly 6,000 acres were under cultivation around St. Louis. In spite of this agriculture, fur trading was the major focus of many residents.|$|E
2500|$|The hundred {{soldiers}} and workers who accompanied Cadillac built a fort enclosing one <b>arpent</b> (about , {{the equivalent of}} just under [...] per side) and named it Fort Pontchartrain. Cadillac's wife, Marie Thérèse Guyon, soon moved to Detroit, {{becoming one of the}} first European women to settle in the Michigan wilderness. The town quickly became a major fur-trading and shipping post. The Église de Saint-Anne (Church of Saint Ann) was founded the same year. While the original building does not survive, the congregation continues to be active today. Cadillac later departed to serve as the French governor of Louisiana from 1710 to 1716. French attempts to consolidate the fur trade led to the Fox Wars involving the Meskwaki (Fox) and their allies versus the French and their Native allies.|$|E

2500|$|The name first {{appears in}} the Domesday Book as 'Clara'.

It lists [...] of meadow, woodland for 12 swine, a mill, 5 arpents of vineyard (an <b>arpent</b> was 4–6 acres) and 400 sheep.
