5|$|Firing {{began at}} 15:29 when Prudente {{unleashed}} a close range broadside at Centurion, followed immediately by {{fire from the}} ships of both sides. Centurion was damaged in the opening exchanges and by 16:00 had most of her sails and rigging torn. At this Renaud ordered his squadron to pull back to leeward out of range, each firing on Centurion <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>passed.</b>|$|E
5|$|The Indiana Sanitary Commission, {{created in}} 1862, and soldiers' aid {{societies}} {{throughout the state}} raised funds and gathered supplies for troops in the field. Hoosiers also provided other forms of support for soldiers and their families, including a Soldiers' Home and a Ladies' Home, and Orphans' Home to help {{meet the needs of}} Indiana's soldiers and their families <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>passed</b> through Indianapolis.|$|E
5|$|Edmund was not {{particularly}} popular while he was alive, nor did he enjoy a good reputation after his death. His unreliability in political issues, and repeated shifts in allegiance, might have contributed to this. His household was also said to behave {{in a way that}} caused popular resentment, taking provisions <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>passed</b> through the countryside while offering little compensation. At the same time, it has been pointed out that Edmund showed a great deal of loyalty to Edward II, in spite of receiving relatively little rewards and recognition from his brother.|$|E

5|$|Lynx is a {{constellation}} {{named after the}} animal, usually observed in the northern sky. The constellation {{was introduced in the}} late 17th century by Johannes Hevelius. It is a faint constellation, with its brightest stars forming a zigzag line. The orange giant Alpha Lyncis is the brightest star in the constellation, and the semiregular variable star Y Lyncis is a target for amateur astronomers. Six star systems have been found to contain planets. Those of 6 Lyncis and HD 75898 were discovered by the Doppler method; those of XO-2, XO-4, XO-5 and WASP-13 were observed <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>passed</b> in front of the host star.|$|E
5|$|Students from Bristol University held {{a protest}} {{march to the}} bus station and the local {{headquarters}} of the TGWU on 1 May, which attracted heckling from bus crews <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>passed</b> through the city centre, according to the local press. Local MP Tony Benn contacted then Labour Opposition leader Harold Wilson, who spoke out against the colour bar at an Anti-Apartheid Movement rally in London. On 2 May local Labour Party Alderman Henry Hennessey spoke of the apparent collusion between bus company management and the TGWU over the colour bar. On 3 May, the ruling Labour Group on the city council threatened him with expulsion, despite his honourable service of over forty years.|$|E
5|$|As regiments {{organized}} and reorganized, Union soldiers continued to gather at Indianapolis, sometimes {{as many as}} 12,000 at a time. Indianapolis regiments formed in 1862 included the 70th Indiana, {{under the command of}} Benjamin Harrison, and the 79th Indiana, under the command of Frederick Knefler. Popular gathering spots for the soldiers included Monument Circle and University Park. A Soldiers' Home and a Ladies' Home were established in Indianapolis in 1862 and in 1863, respectively, to house and feed Indiana's soldiers and their families <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>passed</b> through Indianapolis. City residents continued to aid Union soldiers by providing food, clothing, equipment, and supplies. Soldiers' aid societies and the Indiana Sanitary Commission, established in 1862 with its headquarters in Indianapolis, raised funds and gathered supplies for troops in the field. The women of Indianapolis also organized groups, usually local Ladies' Aid Societies, to provide soldiers with blankets and clothing, and helped raise funds for additional troop supplies.|$|E

5|$|As {{the combat}} raged {{at the head}} of the line, the {{remainder}} of both squadrons strained to join the battle. The British eastern division under Louis reached the battling Alexandre and Spencer at 10:35, the two ships locked together to the south of the main engagement. <b>As</b> <b>they</b> <b>passed,</b> Canopus, Donegal and Atlas all raked the French ship, bringing down all of her masts and leaving her in a crippled state. Canopus then steered directly towards the battle around Impérial, as Donegal and Atlas turned northwest to intercept Brave and Jupiter respectively. At 11:00, Spencer followed Canopus while Alexandres crew were preoccupied with extinguishing a fire that had broken out on board. Alexandre was so badly damaged that she was unable to either escape or continue the action; she formally surrendered ten minutes later.|$|E
5|$|Keats {{meanwhile}} {{had engaged}} and defeated Saint Antoine, forcing the wounded Commodore Julien le Ray to surrender following {{an action that}} had lasted just half an hour. Casualties on Saint Antoine were heavy, although Superb had just 15 men wounded. The rest of the British squadron, following up in the darkness, mistook Saint Antoine as being still active, and all fired on the ship <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>passed,</b> intending to catch the remainder of Moreno's squadron as it sailed northwest along the Spanish coastline. At 04:00 the Formidable, now {{under the command of}} Captain Amable Troude, was seen to the north in Conil Bay near Cape Trafalgar and Saumarez sent Venerable to chase the French ship, Hood accompanied by Thames under Captain Aiskew Hollis. At 05:15, Venerable came within range and a close action soon followed, Hood ordering Hollis to bring his ship close to Troude's stern and open up a raking fire. Formidable had the better of the action however and at 06:45, with casualties mounting, Hood's mainmast collapsed over the side.|$|E
5|$|On 22 December {{a public}} {{memorial}} service took place for Tucker, Bentley and Choate at St Paul's Cathedral. King George V {{was represented by}} Edward Wallington, his Groom in Waiting; also present were Churchill and the Lord Mayor of London. The crime had shocked Londoners and the service showed evidence of their feelings. An estimated ten thousand people waited in St Paul's environs, and many local businesses closed as a mark of respect; the nearby London Stock Exchange ceased trading {{for half an hour}} to allow traders and staff to watch the procession along Threadneedle Street. After the service, when the coffins were being transported on an eight-mile (13km) journey to the cemeteries, it was estimated that 750,000 people lined the route, many throwing flowers onto the hearses <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>passed.</b>|$|E

5|$|That night Morgan's men camped at Frakes' Mill {{just north}} of Mauckport. They found the area deserted, as all the civilians had fled their homes. In the house where Morgan stayed, the table was set with supper which {{he and his men}} ate before resting for the night. Morgan's men tapped the {{telegraph}} lines again and began sending false reports that they were headed for New Albany. The disinformation dissuaded New Albany's Legion leaders from sending the large number of reinforcements to Corydon that they had been organizing. The next morning the Confederates resumed their march northward. <b>As</b> <b>they</b> <b>passed</b> up a county road, a shot was fired killing a soldier. The scouts opened fired on a nearby house from which they assumed the shot had come, killing a Lutheran minister and wounding his son.|$|E
5|$|The {{departure}} of the Batavian squadron was noticed by Donnelly's small blockade force, which shadowed the Batavian ships <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>passed</b> southwards down the coast of Jutland, losing sight of them at 22:00 on 11 May. Donnelly correctly guessed the Batavian force's destination, and ordered Sylph to separate, the two vessels following different courses, instructing White to proceed to Duncan's blockade fleet and meet Donnelly there if {{he was unable to}} rediscover the Batavian squadron en route. Pegasus and Sylph encountered one another shortly before 05:00 on 12 May close to Duncan's fleet south of the Texel but without having located the Batavian squadron. Argo and her consorts had sailed close to the Danish and German coasts during the night, seizing in passing a British cutter named Duke of York, travelling from Yarmouth to Hamburg. At dawn on 12 May the Batavian ships were off the Batavian coast sailing southwest towards the Texel anchorage.|$|E
5|$|The {{problem with}} {{enforcing}} a close blockade with ships was that warships loitering {{off the coast}} of Japan would be vulnerable to attack by aircraft and submarines. Blockading Japanese ports with small ships was a possibility, but this would first require the destruction or neutralisation of the Japanese fleet, and it was far from certain that the Japanese fleet would place itself in a position where it could be destroyed. A plan was adopted for a more distant blockade, whereby ships bound for Japan would be intercepted <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>passed</b> through the East Indies or the Panama Canal. This would not cut off Japan's trade with China or Korea, and probably not with the United States either. The effectiveness of such a blockade was therefore questionable.|$|E

5|$|The {{space between}} {{the stars in the}} M87 galaxy is filled with a diffuse {{interstellar}} medium of gas, which has been chemically enriched by the elements ejected from stars <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>passed</b> beyond the end of their main sequence lifetime. Carbon and nitrogen are continuously supplied by intermediate mass stars as they pass through the asymptotic giant branch. The heavier elements from oxygen to iron are primarily produced by supernova explosions within the galaxy. About 60% of the abundance of these heavy elements was produced by core-collapse supernovae, while the remainder came from Type Ia supernovae. The distribution of these elements suggests that early enrichment was from core-collapse supernovae. The contribution from these sources was much lower in abundance than in the Milky Way. Type Ia supernovae have provided a continuous contribution to the interstellar medium of M87 throughout the history of the galaxy.|$|E
5|$|The {{third stage}} of the Hornet Upgrade Program sought to rectify {{airframe}} damage. HUG Phase 3.1 involved minor structural work to all aircraft <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>passed</b> through other phases of the program. The centre fuselages of the ten Hornets assessed as suffering {{the greatest amount of}} structural damage were replaced in HUG Phase 3.2. It was originally intended that all the RAAF's Hornets would receive new centre fuselages, but the scope of this phase of the program was reduced after {{it was found that the}} number of man-hours needed to upgrade each aircraft was much greater than originally estimated. The ten aircraft were upgraded at an L-3 Communications facility in Canada, and all were returned to service by June 2010.|$|E
5|$|The two 20th Century Fox films—The Hound of the Baskervilles and The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes—had survived {{complete}} {{and in good}} condition, but those in the Universal series suffered badly over the years, <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>passed</b> through the hands of different copyright owners. In 1993 the UCLA Film and Television Archive started a restoration project on the series after the unstable cellulose nitrate film {{was found to be}} suffering from deterioration. Restoration on the first six films—The Woman in Green, The Pearl of Death, Sherlock Holmes and the Secret Weapon, The Scarlet Claw, Terror by Night and The Spider Woman—took four years from 1993; the costs for the restoration were met by UCLA and Hugh Hefner, who was a fan of the Rathbone-Holmes series. From 1998 Warner Bros. matched Hefner's funding and the remaining six films—Dressed to Kill, Pursuit to Algiers, Sherlock Holmes Faces Death, The House of Fear, Sherlock Holmes and the Voice of Terror and Sherlock Holmes in Washington—were then restored, a process that was completed in 2001.|$|E

5|$|During the American Civil War, Indianapolis, {{the state}} capital of Indiana, was a major base {{of support for the}} Union. Governor Oliver P. Morton, a major {{supporter}} of President Abraham Lincoln, quickly made Indianapolis a gathering place to organize and train troops for the Union army. The city became a major railroad hub for troop transport to Confederate lands, and therefore had military importance. Twenty-four military camps were established in the vicinity of Indianapolis. Camp Morton, the initial mustering ground to organize and train the state's Union volunteers in 1861, was designated as a major prisoner-of-war camp for captured Confederate soldiers in 1862. In addition to military camps, a state-owned arsenal was established in the city in 1861, and a federal arsenal in 1862. A Soldiers' Home and a Ladies' Home were established in Indianapolis to house and feed Union soldiers and their families <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>passed</b> through the city. Indianapolis residents also supported the Union cause by providing soldiers with food, clothing, equipment, and supplies, despite rising prices and wartime hardships, such as food and clothing shortages. Local doctors aided the sick, some area women provided nursing care, and Indianapolis City Hospital tended to wounded soldiers. Indianapolis sent an estimated 4,000 men into military service; an estimated 700 died during the war. Indianapolis's Crown Hill National Cemetery was established as one of two national military cemeteries established in Indiana in 1866.|$|E
5|$|Upon Nubians {{contact with}} the German 17th Half Flotilla, she made the same error as Flirt and mistook the German boats for Allied vessels. Surprised with a hail of gunfire, Nubian {{attempted}} to ram the last boat in the German line of battle but {{was struck by a}} torpedo that blew off her bow and reduced her to a drifting hulk. Amazon and Cossack soon arrived to aid Nubian and engaged the German boats. The Germans scored several hits on Amazon, knocking out two of her boilers before withdrawing. Vikings division of boats also clashed with Kaiserliche Marine torpedo boats. The German 18th Half Flotilla was heading back to Zeebrugge when it sailed into Oliphant′s group of destroyers, engaging them <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>passed.</b> Although Viking escaped unscathed, Mohawk suffered several hits, before the Germans were able to break away to the safety of the coast. Near the end of the action, Admiral Bacon dispatched the Dunkirk Division to intercept the German torpedo boats before they could return to Flanders but the Germans were able to successfully withdraw before being caught by these further reinforcements.|$|E
5|$|With Real Carlos disabled, Keats {{pushed on}} into combat with Saint Antoine, the {{combined}} French and Spanish crew engaging the British vessel as it approached. At 23:50, Keats laid his ship close alongside the new French ship, beginning {{a close and}} heated action as the ships of the line exchanged broadsides {{with one another in}} pitch darkness and with an increasing wind. For 30 minutes the battle continued until, with the ships off Cape Spartel in North Africa, a wounded Le Ray decided that his ship was no longer able to contest the action and hailed Superb to announce that he had surrendered. The halyards that held up his pennant had however become tangled in the rigging, giving the appearance that the ship was still in French hands: this later led it to be attacked repeatedly by other British ships as they came up during the night. Formidable was also {{to the rear of the}} combined squadron, escaping attack by feigning British signal lights until it had safely passed the battle between Superb and Saint Antoine. Keats remained with his prize, awaiting the arrival of the rest of the squadron: Caesar, Venerable, Spencer and Thames arrived after midnight, all firing on Saint Antoine <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>passed</b> before continuing westwards in search of the remainder of Moreno's squadron. Superb was later joined by Carlotta and the small ships HMS Calpe and Louisa, which remained on hand during the night.|$|E
