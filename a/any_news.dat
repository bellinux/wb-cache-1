5|$|Bligh {{had landed}} in England on 14 March 1790 to public acclaim, and was quickly {{promoted}} to post-captain. In the following months {{he wrote his}} account of the mutiny, and on 22 October was honourably acquitted at court martial of responsibility for the Bounty's loss. Early in 1791 he was appointed to command a new breadfruit expedition, which left London on 3 August of that year, before <b>any</b> <b>news</b> of the capture of Heywood and the others had reached London. Bligh would be gone for more than two years, and would thus be absent from the court martial proceedings that awaited the returned mutineers.|$|E
5|$|He {{was thankful}} to be posted to the No. 1 School of Aerial Fighting at Ayr in Scotland, where he flew the {{excellent}} performing Sopwith Snipe. It was in Scotland {{that he learned}} {{of the death of}} his brother, apparently shot down by the German ace Hans Wolff on 19 March. He wrote to his brother's commanding officer, Sholto Douglas asking for <b>any</b> <b>news</b> but understanding the Major's attention was now fixed on the German Spring Offensive. His death depressed McCudden greatly.|$|E
5|$|Wodehouse's {{family and}} friends had not had <b>any</b> <b>news</b> of his {{location}} {{after the fall of}} France, but an article from an Associated Press reporter who had visited Tost in December 1940 led to pressure on the German authorities to release the novelist. This included a petition from influential people in the US; Senator W.Warren Barbour presented it to the German ambassador. Although his captors refused to release him, Wodehouse was provided with a typewriter and, to pass the time, he wrote Money in the Bank. Throughout his time in Tost, he sent postcards to his US literary agent asking for $5 to be sent to various people in Canada, mentioning his name. These were the families of Canadian prisoners of war, and the news from Wodehouse was the first indication that their sons were alive and well. Wodehouse risked severe punishment for the communication, but managed to evade the German censor.|$|E

5|$|On Monday 4 February, William {{bought some}} rope {{at the local}} grocer's shop, and {{spent the rest of}} the day observing cases at the Sheriff Court from the public gallery. He was later {{reported}} to have listened attentively to the proceedings. On 7 February, he attended the court sessions again. On 10 February, he visited his acquaintance, Walker, who lent him a newspaper that featured a woman's suicide by hanging. Walker asked Bury to look up <b>any</b> <b>news</b> of Jack the Ripper, at which Bury threw down the newspaper with a fright. That evening, he walked into the Dundee Central Police Station on Bell Street and reported his wife's suicide to Lieutenant James Parr. He said they had been drinking heavily the night before her death, and he had woken in the morning to find his wife's body on the floor with a rope around her neck. Bury had not summoned a doctor, but had instead cut the body and concealed it in one of the packing cases brought from London. Bury told Parr that his actions were now preying on his mind, and he was afraid that he would be arrested and accused of being Jack the Ripper.|$|E

25|$|In February, several {{attempts}} were made on Indian newspaper correspondents in Feni sub-division in Noakhali. Dr. Dhirendra Kumar Dutta the younger brother of PTI correspondent Jadugopal Dutta was stabbed to death.

25|$|Yon {{has also}} been criticized {{by members of the}} Army, such as by Lt. Col. Steven Boylan in September 2005, who have said that he {{violated}} his embed agreement by releasing photos of dead and injured soldiers before their family members were notified. He also has been accused of skirting Army rules by working before he formally signed up with a news agency. However, Yon is not employed by <b>any</b> <b>news</b> organization, and employment by a news organization is not a requirement for embedding with U.S. Forces.|$|E

After having finally determined that the entire force must have left the Mediterranean he himself beat through the straits, where he received confirmation on 8 May from one of Orde's ships that the French had sailed through the straits a month earlier, and had not headed north. Convinced that Villeneuve was headed for the West Indies Nelson set off in pursuit.|$|E
25|$|In mid-December, the WGA {{announced}} plans to try to negotiate with individual production companies to end the impasse. The AMPTP and WGA agreed to resume informal talks {{in an effort to}} organize formal negotiations on January 19, 2008.

WGA President Patric Verrone did, however, report on January 22 that the animation and reality jurisdiction proposals had been dropped.|$|E
25|$|Friends {{and family}} say Bethany {{did her best}} to keep in contact with them. But due to Bethany's busy life, {{balancing}} her classes in what was to be her final semester at GMU with a full-time job, they had gotten used to not hearing from her for several days at a time, so they were not worried as February 2011 began without <b>any</b> <b>news</b> from her. However, later in the month several of her friends called her mother, Kim Nelson, saying that they had received messages from her via her Facebook account that did not seem to them to have come from Bethany.|$|E

25|$|On February 28. 2008, Drudge {{published}} an article noting that Prince Harry was serving with his regiment in Afghanistan. Prince Harry was ten weeks into a front-line deployment in Afghanistan that was subject to a voluntary news blackout by the UK press. The blackout was designed to protect Prince Harry and the men serving with him from being specifically targeted by the Taliban. An Australian weekly women’s magazine New Idea had broken the story in January, {{but it was not}} followed up at the time. The New Idea editors claimed ignorance of <b>any</b> <b>news</b> blackout. Then a German newspaper Berliner Kurier published a short piece on 28 February, also before Drudge.|$|E
25|$|Bryant's {{motivation}} for the massacre remains a closely guarded secret, known only to his lawyer, who is bound not to reveal confidences without his client's consent. The lawyer later released a book outlining that Bryant was motivated largely by the media reports of the then-recent Dunblane school massacre. From the moment he was captured, he continually {{wanted to know how}} many people he had killed and seemed impressed by the number. Bryant is only allowed to listen to music on a radio outside his cell, and is denied access to <b>any</b> <b>news</b> reports of his massacre. Photographers allowed in to take pictures of him in his prison cell were forced to destroy the film in his presence when the Governor found out.|$|E
25|$|On January 1, 2003, {{family members}} of 19-year-old Nikia Kilpatrick went to check on her. They had not had <b>any</b> <b>news</b> from her for several days. They found her body in the bedroom of her apartment. She had been raped then killed by {{strangulation}} with a cord two days before. Her two sons, an eleven-month-old and a two-year-old, were alive but malnourished. Kilpatrick was approximately six months pregnant {{at the time of}} her death. Eight days later, 20-year-old nurse assistant Shawanda Denise McCalister, who was also pregnant {{at the time of her}} death, was raped and strangled in her Jacksonville apartment. The murder scene was almost identical to that of Kilpatrick. She was killed on Durousseau's first day of driving a cab for Gator City Taxi. Her body was found the following day.|$|E

25|$|The {{previous}} day, on the Sunday, Beattie's {{group had}} great difficulty {{getting out of}} the hut because of the deep snow and in arduous conditions they were scarcely able to descend from the plateau. At 16:30 they reached Rothiemurchus Hut where they were able to telephone Lagganlia and they met their transport vehicle at 17:30. The children were returned to Lagganlia while Beattie and Paisley drove to the ski centre where they were unable to learn <b>any</b> <b>news.</b> They then went to Glenmore Lodge and then Aviemore police station where at 19:00 they reported Davidson's party missing. Three pairs of rescuers were immediately dispatched from Glenmore Lodge into the blizzard and the night and the Cairngorm, RAF Kinloss, Braemar and Aberdeen MRTs were called out. The mountain rescue teams made their preparations so they could start off hours before first light on Monday.|$|E
25|$|If the muster-roll of Laudonnière is accurate, the {{garrison}} which Ribault left behind him to defend Fort Caroline was ill-fitted to resist {{an attack of}} the well-fed and well-disciplined Spanish soldiery. The total number of colonists remaining in the fort was about two hundred and forty. Three days passed without <b>any</b> <b>news</b> of Ribault, and {{with each passing day}} Laudonnière became more anxious. Knowing the proximity of the Spaniards, and dreading a sudden descent upon the fort, he resolved to make shift for his own defense. Although food stores were depleted, as Ribault had carried off two of his boats with the meal which had been left over after making the biscuit for the return to France, and although Laudonnière himself was reduced to the rations of a common soldier, he yet commanded the allowance to be increased in order to lift the morale of his men. He also set to work to repair the palisade which had been torn down to supply material for the ships, but continued storms hindered the work, which was never completed.|$|E
25|$|The Germans did {{not approve}} of the new king. They claimed that their {{recognition}} of independent Lithuania {{was based on the}} Act of December 11, which provided for an alliance with Germany and therefore Lithuania did {{not have the right to}} unilaterally elect a new monarch. They also protested that the Council of Lithuania had changed its name to the State Council of Lithuania just before the approval of Mindaugas II. The Council stopped using its new name in communications with the Germans, but stood by its new king. The Lithuanian press was censored and not allowed to publish <b>any</b> <b>news</b> about the new king, while the German press unanimously criticized the decision. When Lietuvos aidas, the newspaper of the Council, refused to print an article denouncing the new king, the newspaper was shut down for a month. German–Lithuanian relations remained tense until October 1918. The election also further damaged the reputation of the Council, already portrayed as a German puppet, among the Entente powers and the Lithuanian diaspora. Lithuanians in the west thought that Lithuania should place its hopes of independence with the Entente and not Germany. This rift further fractured and weakened the Lithuanian positions.|$|E
