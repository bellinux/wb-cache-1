40|$|Since the EURO V {{standards}} for heavy-duty engines, the European emissions legislation requires {{to verify the}} conformity of heavy-duty engines with the applicable emissions certification standards: these provisions are identified as “In Service Conformity” (ISC). It was considered impractical and expensive to adopt an ISC scheme for heavy-duty vehicles requiring the removal of engines from vehicles to test pollutant emissions against legislative limits. Therefore, it was proposed to develop a protocol for in-service conformity checking of heavy-duty vehicles based {{on the use of}} Portable Emission Measurement Systems (PEMS). As a result, ISC testing based on PEMS was introduced in the EURO V and the EURO VI standards. The corresponding <b>administrative</b> and <b>technical</b> <b>provisions</b> were formulated in the European Regulations 582 / 2011 and 64 / 2012. The above route was followed for non-road engines as well: preliminary research activities studied and confirmed the possibility to apply the methods developed for heavy-duty engines with minor modifications. The basis for the introduction of ISC provisions based on the PEMS approach into the European NRMM type-approval legislation has been established in several texts. The NRMM PEMS Pilot Program was launched to facilitate the introduction into the European NRMM emissions legislation of use of PEMS as a tool for ISC. This had to be achieved by improving the technical procedures (e. g. available from the heavy-duty scheme) and increasing the awareness of the different stakeholders about PEMS as a new regulatory tool.

40|$|<b>Technical</b> <b>provisions</b> {{represent}} one of {{the most}} important item of liabilities in accounting of an insurance company. <b>Technical</b> <b>provisions</b> reperesent liabilities for clients of the insurance companies. The exact amount of these provisions is not known in advance. The main reason for generating <b>technical</b> <b>provisions</b> by insurance companies is to fulfill the liabilites arising from insurance and reinsurance contracts in the future. The first chapter of this thesis deals with the principle of the provisions in accounting in general. The next chapters deals with the provisions generated according to IFRS and the czech law. The most extensive chapter describes the <b>technical</b> <b>provisions</b> from the perspective of the czech law for insurance companies.

The thesis also {{deals with the}} principles and structure of financial placement. Due to a past financial crisis that affected not only banks, but also insurance companies, the thesis will also focus on the relationship of the financial crisis on investment of <b>technical</b> <b>provisions.</b> In the second part the thesis describes the approach and creation of <b>technical</b> <b>provisions</b> and financial placements of specific commercial insurance companies and its comparison with other insurance companies. The result of the thesis is the evaluation and recommendations for optimization of <b>technical</b> <b>provisions</b> and financial investment for the insurance companies...|$|R
40|$|Providing risk-sharing {{benefits}} to risk-averse policy holders {{is a primary}} function of insurance companies. We model that policy holders are paying a fee over {{the present value of}} indemnifications (i. e., <b>technical</b> <b>provisions)</b> to enjoy these risksharing benefits. This fee implies that a capital structure largely consisting of <b>technical</b> <b>provisions</b> is optimal for insurance firms, making the traditional Modigliani-Miller logic inappropriate for them. To support the issuance of <b>technical</b> <b>provisions</b> with socially desirable properties, insurance firms hold a surplus to absorb losses. We show that the Modigliani-Miller logic applies to the composition of this loss-absorption capacity. This explains why insurance companies may use, next to equity and <b>technical</b> <b>provisions,</b> financial debt in supporting their activities. status: publishe...|$|R

40|$|Entities such as {{commercial}} {{insurance companies are}} obliged to create <b>technical</b> <b>provisions</b> {{in order to fulfill}} their activities. <b>Technical</b> <b>provisions</b> are used to cover liabilities of commercial insurance companies arising from insurance and reinsurance activities. The principal aim {{of this paper is to}} determine the impact of the creation and use of <b>technical</b> <b>provisions</b> for some important items of the financial statements, which are liabilities, a balance sheet, profit and an income tax base. A prerequisite to fulfill the objective of the paper is to analyze the accounting legislation for <b>technical</b> <b>provisions</b> in an insurance company. The intention of the presented paper can be divided according to its conception into two parts. The first part of the paper is devoted to methodological aspects in relation to the general definition of the accounting principles and their importance in the accounting of commercial insurance companies.
