5|$|Changes in Directive Principles {{require a}} Constitutional {{amendment}} {{which has to}} be passed by a special majority of both houses of the Parliament. This means that an amendment requires the approval of two-thirds of the members present and voting and by the <b>absolute</b> <b>majority</b> of the house – whether the Lok Sabha or Rajya Sabha.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to political campaigning, the NSDAP engaged in paramilitary {{violence and the}} spread of anti-communist propaganda in the days preceding the election. On election day, 6 March 1933, the NSDAP's share of the vote increased to 43.9 percent, and the party acquired the largest number of seats in parliament. Hitler's party failed to secure an <b>absolute</b> <b>majority,</b> necessitating another coalition with the DNVP.|$|E
5|$|In the 2010 general election, the Moderate Party {{increased}} {{its share of}} the vote to 30.06%. The Alliance got a majority of votes cast, but with 173 seats no <b>absolute</b> <b>majority</b> in parliament. With the opposition divided mainly by the Sweden Democrats, Reinfeldt could remain in government, but with a greater need to seek consensus on matters of substance with the opposition parties.|$|E
50|$|During the nadir of the Liberal Party (from the 1930s to the 1960s) the {{constituency}} {{became a}} safe Conservative seat, with <b>absolute</b> <b>majorities</b> from 1931 until 1970 inclusive.|$|R
50|$|In 1967, he {{lost the}} Country Party {{pre-selection}} in questionable circumstances, but ran as an Independent, winning the seat at the 1968 and 1971 elections with <b>absolute</b> <b>majorities.</b>|$|R
5000|$|<b>Absolute</b> <b>majorities</b> were {{in favour}} of {{adopting}} the euro (50% in favour, 43% opposed, 7% no opinion) and participating in a Common European Defence policy (66% in favour, 21% opposed, 13% no opinion).|$|R
5|$|After {{the decades}} of {{political}} disappointments, the February Revolution offered the Finnish Social Democrats momentum for power; they held the <b>absolute</b> <b>majority</b> in the Parliament. The conservatives were alarmed by the continuous increase of the socialists' might since 1899, with the climax in 1917 without the offsetting control of Russian administration; the Social Democrats had to be halted before {{they were able to}} markedly alter the power structure.|$|E
5|$|In the February election, ZANU-PF secured 63% of the {{national}} vote, gaining 57 of the 80 parliamentary seats allocated for black parties and providing them with an <b>absolute</b> <b>majority.</b> ZAPU had gained 20 seats, and UANC had three. Mugabe was elected MP for the Salisbury constituency of Highfield. Attempting to calm panic and prevent white flight, Mugabe appeared on television and called for national unity, stability, and law and order, insisting that the pensions of white civil servants would be guaranteed and that private property would be protected.|$|E
5|$|In the October 1917 elections, the Social Democrats {{lost their}} <b>absolute</b> <b>majority,</b> which radicalized the labor {{movement}} and decreased support for moderate politics. The crisis of July 1917 did not bring about the Red Revolution in January 1918 on their own, but together with political development based on the commoners' interpretation of the ideas of Fennomania and socialism, the events were decisive for the goals of a Finnish revolution. In order to win power, the socialists had to overcome the Parliament.|$|E

50|$|The House {{consists}} of 11 elected two members, and two appointed ex-officio non-voting members (the Speaker and the Attorney General). The 11 elected members consist of 9 {{candidates who are}} elected to represent Territorial districts, and 4 candidates who are elected on a Territory-wide basis. Government is formed by {{the leader of the}} party who can most readily command a majority in the House. Although in recent times parties have tended to win <b>absolute</b> <b>majorities,</b> during the early days of democratic elections in the British Virgin Islands, coalition governments were commonly formed between parties and independent candidates. Politicians in the British Virgin Islands also frequently cross the floor to change parties in order to create <b>absolute</b> <b>majorities.</b>|$|R

5|$|The Quancard {{family has}} {{played a role in}} the life and history of Cubzac-les-Ponts. Firstly, Jean Quancard was elected by <b>absolute</b> <b>majority</b> as mayor of Cubzac on May 15, 1892 and {{remained}} in office for 27 years. Also, a fair, organised annually from 1936 to 1939 for its success, supported restoration work for the Saint-Julien steeple and provided financial help to the priest.

The last family reunion, from May 2006, saw approximately 200 members of the Quancard family.|$|E
5|$|The {{constituency}} {{was created}} as per the Political Reform Act 1977 and was first contested in the 1977 general election. The Act {{provided for the}} provinces of Spain to be established as multi-member districts in the Congress of Deputies, with this regulation being maintained under the Spanish Constitution of 1978. Additionally, the Constitution requires for any modification of the provincial limits to be approved under an organic law, needing an <b>absolute</b> <b>majority</b> in the Cortes Generales.|$|E
5|$|The {{governor}} {{works in}} concert with the state legislature (the bicameral Indiana General Assembly, consisting of the Indiana House of Representatives and the Indiana Senate) and the state supreme court (the Supreme Court of Indiana) to govern the state. The governor has the power to veto legislation passed by the General Assembly. If vetoed, a bill is returned to the General Assembly for reconsideration. Unlike other states, most of which require a two-thirds supermajority to override a veto, the Indiana General Assembly may override the veto with an <b>absolute</b> <b>majority</b> vote in both chambers.|$|E

5|$|Proposed in {{the form}} of an interstate compact, the {{agreement}} would go into effect among the participating states in the compact only after they collectively represent an <b>absolute</b> <b>majority</b> of votes (currently at least 270) in the Electoral College. In the next presidential election after adoption by the requisite number of states, the participating states would award all of their electoral votes to presidential electors associated with the candidate who wins the overall popular vote in the 50 states and the District of Columbia. As a result, the winner of the national popular vote would always win the presidency by always securing a majority of votes in the Electoral College. Until the compact's conditions are met, all states award electoral votes in their current manner.|$|E
5|$|The {{election}} results were announced on 23 February 1967 and the DMK won an <b>absolute</b> <b>majority</b> on its own. It had increased its vote share to 40.6% from 27.1% in 1962 election. Annadurai resigned as the Member of Parliament from the Madras South Lok Sabha constituency, which was later won by Murasoli Maran {{in the following}} by-election. Annadurai was nominated as Chief Minister of Madras State and staked a claim to form a Government on 2 March 1967. He was sworn in by Governor Ujjal Singh on 6 March 1967 in Rajaji Hall. He was later elected to the Madras Legislative Council on 22 April 1967.|$|E
5|$|The main {{players in}} the {{politics}} of the state are the All India Trinamool Congress, the Indian National Congress, and the Left Front alliance (led by the Communist Party of India (Marxist) or CPI(M)). Following the West Bengal State Assembly Election in 2011, the All India Trinamool Congress and Indian National Congress coalition under Mamata Banerjee of the All India Trinamool Congress was elected to power (getting 225 seats in the legislature). Prior to this, West Bengal was ruled by the Left Front for 34 years (1977–2011), making it the world's longest-running democratically elected communist government. Banerjee was re-elected as Chief Minister in the 2016 election in which Trinamool Congress won an <b>absolute</b> <b>majority.</b>|$|E

50|$|Venice was {{governed by}} center-left parties from the 1990s until the 2010s, when the mayor {{started to be}} elected directly. This is {{remarkable}} because Veneto {{has long been a}} conservative stronghold, with the coalition between the regionalist Lega Nord and the center-right Forza Italia winning <b>absolute</b> <b>majorities</b> of the electorate in many elections at communal, national, and regional levels.|$|R

5|$|Though the White House {{maintained}} public neutrality, privately Kennedy made {{it clear}} he desired a Liberal victory. Kennedy lent Lou Harris, his pollster to work for the Liberals again. On election day, April 8, 1963, the Liberals claimed 129 seats to the Tories' 95, five seats short of an <b>absolute</b> <b>majority.</b> Diefenbaker held to power for several days, until six Quebec Social Credit MPs signed a statement that Pearson should form the government. These votes would be enough to give Pearson support of a majority of the House of Commons, and Diefenbaker resigned. The six MPs repudiated the statement within days. Nonetheless, Pearson formed a government {{with the support of the}} NDP.|$|E
5|$|When {{the electoral}} votes were counted, Adams {{finished}} {{in third place}} with 65 votes, and Pinckney came in fourth with 64 votes (one New England Federalist elector voted for John Jay instead). Jefferson and Burr tied for first place with 73 votes each. Because of the tie, the election devolved upon the House of Representatives. As specified by the Constitution, each state's delegation voted , with each state having a single vote; an <b>absolute</b> <b>majority</b> (nine, as there were 16 states at the time) was required for victory. On February 17, 1801 – on the 36th ballot – Jefferson was elected {{by a vote of}} 10 to 4 (two states abstained).|$|E
5|$|After the election, {{many analysts}} {{concluded}} {{that it was the}} unity of the opposition parties against Congress, missing in the 1962 elections, that made the difference. The victory is attributed to the electoral alliance between DMK and Rajaji. Even though Congress had done an effective job of managing the state of Madras, the effective grass roots campaigning by the DMK and the political acumen of Annadurai, defeated the Congress and its leader M. Bhaktavatsalam. The popularity of the United Front was so large {{that they were able to}} win an <b>absolute</b> <b>majority</b> in ten out of the 14 districts in the state, while Congress could not accomplish that in a single district. This was largely due to the fact that the United Front was able to capitalize on its growing support in large towns and cities, combined with the decline in Congress support in its traditional Schedule Caste constituencies.|$|E

50|$|Overall, {{the democrats}} took 25 seats and the pro-government camp 35 seats. Bills {{initiated}} by the government can still be passed on pro-government support alone, but bills originated by members cannot be passed without democratic support, since these bills require <b>absolute</b> <b>majorities</b> in each sector (geographical and functional) of the legislature. Constitutional amendments require a two-thirds vote and thereby also require support from the democratic camp.|$|R
50|$|The Spanish Socialist Workers' Party (PSOE) {{remained}} the largest party overall {{and in most}} regional parliaments, but lost 742,000 votes, nearly 10 percentage points {{and many of the}} <b>absolute</b> <b>majorities</b> it had obtained four years previously. As a result, several centre-right coalitions and alliances were able to oust the Socialists from government in 4 out of the 12 regional executives it held previous to the election.|$|R
5|$|After {{the first}} free elections, {{with the end}} of the Estado Novo period, only right-wing parties have governed the city: the city council was governed by the CDS between 1976 and 1989 and since then by the PSD. The CDS saw its {{popularity}} suffer an abrupt decline in 1997, and has since then been the third political party. On the other hand, the PSD in the same year achieved its first <b>absolute</b> <b>majority</b> with 62.4% of the votes. After the 2017 municipal elections, seven councilmen were members of the centre-right Partido Social Democrata (PSD), and two of the centre-left Partido Socialista (PS). The mayor is Aires Pereira, for the PSD, elected with 57.7% of the votes. The PSD holds the majority of public offices both in the Municipal Assembly and in the administrative parishes. Póvoa de Varzim Assembly is singly elected and comprises 27 members, with the PSD holding 16 seats, the PS 6, the right-wing CDS 2 and one member for the left-wing Left Bloc, the green party People–Animals–Nature (PAN) and one for the left-wing CDU.|$|E
5|$|In 1952 he {{was elected}} as Woleu-N'Tem's {{representative}} for Gabon's Territorial Assembly. He was re-elected in the March 1957 elections, in which the UDSG also placed first, winning 18 of the 40 contested seats, against 16 for BDG. M'ba's party won 21 seats against 19 for Aubame's party after a recount. However, {{in the absence of}} an <b>absolute</b> <b>majority,</b> on 21 May 1957, both parties were obligated to submit a list of individuals that both agreed were suitable for inclusion in the government. That same day, M'ba was appointed vice president of the government. Soon, divisions within the government grew, and Aubame resigned from his position and filed a motion of censure against the government. The motion was rejected by a 21–19 vote. With M'ba's victory, many elected UDSG members joined the parliamentary majority, giving the ruling government 29 of the 40 legislative seats. Well installed in the government, he slowly began to reinforce his power.|$|E
5|$|October 2001 {{polls showed}} Ravalomanana ahead of Ratsiraka. Following the December election, {{official}} results put Ravalomanana in first place, with 46 per cent, against Ratsiraka's 40 per cent; without a majority, a run-off {{would be required}} between the two candidates. Ravalomanana, claiming to have won {{a majority in the}} first round, refused to participate in a run-off, instead demanding that the High Constitutional Court review the votes. Ratsiraka's supporters then blockaded the capital, which Ravalomanana's supporters controlled. Ravalomanana declared himself president on 22 February 2002. After a recount, on 29 April 2002 the High Constitutional Court pronounced Ravalomanana the winner of an <b>absolute</b> <b>majority</b> {{in the first round of}} the election, and he was sworn in on 6 May. Ravalomanana dispatched soldiers to bring pockets of resistance under control, with incidents of unrest continuing until Ratsiraka fled into exile on 5 July 2002 after losing control of most of the country's provinces.|$|E

25|$|The law has aroused further controversy, {{given that}} in its passing through the {{chambers}} of the legislature, the mandatory seven-day period between debate and assent of the new legislation was ignored.
