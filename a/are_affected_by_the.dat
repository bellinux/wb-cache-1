5|$|English has {{undergone}} many historical sound changes, {{some of them}} affecting all varieties, and others affecting only a few. Most standard varieties <b>are</b> <b>affected</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Great Vowel Shift, which changed the pronunciation of long vowels, but a few dialects have slightly different results. In North America, a number of chain shifts such as the Northern Cities Vowel Shift and Canadian Shift have produced very different vowel landscapes in some regional accents.|$|E

At least one extrasolar planet, HD 189733 b, has been claimed to have such a weather system, similar to the Great Red Spot but twice as large.|$|E

5|$|The {{action of}} the {{magnetosphere}} traps and accelerates particles, producing intense belts of radiation similar to Earth's Van Allen belts, but thousands of times stronger. The interaction of energetic particles with the surfaces of Jupiter's largest moons markedly affects their chemical and physical properties. Those same particles also affect and <b>are</b> <b>affected</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> motions of the particles within Jupiter's tenuous planetary ring system. Radiation belts present a significant hazard for spacecraft and potentially to human space travellers.|$|E

5|$|Cyclone Jasmine {{affected}} fivecountries {{during its}} existence. The predecessor to Jasmine brought heavy rainfall to areas of extreme northern Queensland.

5|$|The South Atlantic High and the South Pacific High both {{influence}} {{the pattern of}} winds in Argentina. Owing to the greater high of the Andes at latitudes north of 40oS, much of Argentina is dominated by wind circulation patterns from the South Atlantic High. The South Atlantic High transports moisture from the Atlantic Ocean to Argentina. This occurs throughout the year due to the atmospheric pressure being lower on land than in the ocean. Much of the north and central {{parts of the country}} <b>are</b> <b>affected</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> South Atlantic High, with a strong influence in the eastern parts than in the west. This is due to the eastern parts being more frequently affected by the South Atlantic High, causing precipitation to decrease westwards.|$|E

5|$|At {{each level}} of the spinal column, spinal nerves branch off from {{either side of the}} spinal cord and exit between a pair of vertebrae, to {{innervate}} a specific part of the body. The area of skin innervated by a specific spinal nerve is called a dermatome, and the group of muscles innervated by a single spinal nerve is called a myotome. The part of the spinal cord that was damaged corresponds to the spinal nerves at that level and below. Injuries can be cervical 1–8 (C1–C8), thoracic 1–12 (T1–T12), lumbar 1–5 (L1–L5), or sacral (S1–S5). A person's level of injury is defined as the lowest level of full sensation and function. Paraplegia occurs when the legs <b>are</b> <b>affected</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> spinal cord damage (in thoracic, lumbar, or sacral injuries), and tetraplegia occurs when all four limbs are affected (cervical damage).|$|E
5|$|The {{two main}} {{characters}} have different capabilities. Both {{are capable of}} using weapons and magic, but the hero is stronger with melee weapons and the heroine is stronger with ranged magical attacks. Weapons have three attributes: slash, jab, and bash; and different attributes cause more or less damage to different enemies. Magical spells can cause damage or defend the protagonists, and <b>are</b> <b>affected</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> weapon the character is holding. Combat takes place in real-time. Located {{at the bottom of}} the screen is an overdrive gauge that increases by one point at each hit given to an enemy. When that gauge is full, the player can release a powerful attack that will deplete the gauge completely if the attack lands. Upon collecting enough experience points in battle, each character increases in level and improves in areas such as strength and evasion.|$|E
