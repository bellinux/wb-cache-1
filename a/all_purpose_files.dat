40|$|Status of the JENDL project after {{releasing}} the latest general <b>purpose</b> <b>file</b> JENDL- 4. 0 is described. By correcting errors and adding covariance data of JENDL- 4. 0, 38 files {{have been released}} as JENDL- 4. 0 u. Development of next general <b>purpose</b> <b>file</b> JENDL- 5 is also in progress. New evaluations have been performed for light nuclei, structural materials and fission products. Two special <b>purpose</b> <b>files,</b> JENDL- 4. 0 /HE and JENDL/DDF- 2015 were released in 2015. The former includes neutron induced reaction data for 130 nuclides in the energy region up to 200 [*]MeV as well as proton induced reaction data for 133 nuclides. The latter is the decay data file of 3, 237 nuclides from Z = 1 to 104 and neutron. Other two special <b>purpose</b> <b>files</b> of activation cross section and photonuclear data are under preparation and will be released soon...|$|R

40|$|Object-Based Storage Systems is {{emerging}} as the storage architecture in {{the next wave of}} storage technology. An Object-Based Storage System is rquired to deal with objectbased storage devices (OSD) workloads which are generally different from the general <b>purpose</b> <b>file</b> system workloads. This paper describe how we implemented a userlevel Object-Based Storage Device File System (OSDFS) which utilizes extents in the traditional bitmap, an adaptive metadata updating scheme, a wasted free space data allocation scheme, extended size of an object mapping (onode ID) to include information of metadata so as to achieve a high performance and high throughput file system for OSD. Our experiments show that OSDFS is able to maintain its continuity in allocating free space for objects up to 98 % of disk utilization. In addition, OSDFS is not only outperforms ext 2 and ext 3 in handling OSD workloads, but also provides better performance when dealing with general <b>purpose</b> <b>file</b> system workloads as compared to conventional file systems. 1...|$|R

30|$|It {{is known}} that PVAc based {{adhesives}} may contain CN within the formulation (for instance UHU <b>All</b> <b>Purpose)</b> [36, 41]. When CN is present within a PVAc based formulation, this may compromise its ageing as determined by Down et al. [42], where the commercial product UHU <b>All</b> <b>Purpose,</b> initially performs well but later dramatically deteriorates in performance with ageing. A PVAc + CN formulation may have been applied to the vessels when additional repairs were made using UHU <b>All</b> <b>Purpose</b> before photographing artefacts for the virtual museum project in 1996. Alternatively, this formulation may have been applied at the relevant excavation site or when conserved, as UHU <b>All</b> <b>Purpose</b> {{is one of the}} longest used and most widely accessible adhesives across the globe [43].|$|R

The photon production cross sections and spectra were calculated simultaneously with the particle emission cross sections and spectra, assuring energy balance for each reaction. The theories used in TNG for these calculations are summarized. Several examples of photon production data, taken from the ENDF/B-VI files, are compared with the available experimental data...|$|R
