5|$|GamesRadar {{estimated}} {{that there are more}} than 80 hours of content available in the game. Villoria called the world engaging, and its replay value very high, as players can play the story over and over <b>again</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> different origin.

5|$|The {{battery life}} of the new models also {{received}} mixed reception, with outlets reporting inconsistent battery life and inaccurate estimates of time remaining on battery by the operating system. Apple addressed the latter by hiding the display of estimated battery time remaining entirely in a macOS update. Consumer Reports did not initially recommend the 2016 MacBook Pro models, citing inconsistent and unpredictable battery life in its lab testing (which involves the consecutive loading of multiple websites). However, Apple and Consumer Reports found that the results had been affected by a bug caused by disabling caching in Safari's developer tools. Consumer Reports performed the tests <b>again</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> patched macOS, and retracted its original assessment.|$|E
