5|$|In 1970, {{a sudden}} {{eruption}} in Beerenberg forced the immediate evacuation of the station. A Hercules was {{dispatched to the}} island and successfully landed on the strip. Thereafter the Hercules became the regular military aircraft at Jan Mayen. Aircraft gradually took over more of the transport to the island, and from 1973 all supplies except diesel and special freight was transported by ship. From 1975 the 333 Squadron would occasionally drop mail and supplies using the P-3 Orion <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>supplement</b> to the landings of the Hercules.|$|E
5|$|This {{sense of}} unity was {{represented}} in new media. Dutch-language magazines for educated native youth, {{such as the}} Jong Java (1915) and Jong Sumatranen Bond (1917), advocated a modern national identity without the traditional feudal system. Nationalist views were advocated through magazines for adults, including Pandji Poestaka (first published 1930) and Timboel (first published 1932); these were short-lived publications and only included literature <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>supplement.</b> There were also unsuccessful attempts to found Malay-language literary publications, such as Malaya (announced in 1921).|$|E

Slaves brought to America and the West Indies cooked cowpeas {{much the same way}} as they did in Africa, {{although}} many people in the American South considered cowpeas not suitable for human consumption. A popular dish was Hoppin' John, which contained black-eyed peas cooked with rice and seasoned with pork. Over time cowpeas became more universally accepted and now Hoppin' John is seen as a traditional Southern dish ritually served on New Year's Day.|$|E

5|$|MDOT assigns {{the numbers}} for a {{parallel}} system of county-designated highways in the state; the numbers are assigned in a grid system by the department. These highways, while signed from connecting trunklines and shown on the official MDOT map, are maintained by the various counties. They were started in 1970 <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>supplement</b> to the main trunkline system and carry a letter-number combination on the national standard pentagon-shaped marker in blue and yellow.

The numbers correspond to a numbered grid within each lettered zone. Other county systems are designated and maintained {{in each of the}} 83counties, and signage and numbering practices vary. The state's 533incorporated cities and villages also maintain their own street networks, but townships in the state have no jurisdiction over roads.|$|E
5|$|Eusebius {{listed the}} Gospel of the Hebrews in his Antilegomena {{as one of}} the disputed {{writings}} of the early Church. Despite this, the Church Fathers occasionally used it, with reservations, as a source to support their exegetical arguments. Eusebius reports that the 2nd century Church Father Hegesippus used the gospel as a source for writing his Hypomneumata ("Memoranda") in Rome (c.175–180). The Alexandrian Fathers – Clement, Origen, and Didymus the Blind – relied directly on the gospel to provide prooftexts <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>supplement</b> to the canonical gospels. Clement quoted from the gospel as part of a discourse on divine Wisdom. Origen used it to compare differing views {{of the relationship between the}} Word and the Holy Spirit. Jerome claimed to have used the gospel as a prooftext, although he may have relied in part on excerpts from the commentaries of Origen. He quoted from it as a proof from prophecy based on Isaiah11.2 to explain how Jesus was the fulfillment of messianic expectations. The Gospel of the Hebrews was excluded from the canon by the Catholic Church with the closing of the New Testament canon at the end of the 4th century, and was no longer cited as a source in Church literature.|$|E
5|$|Perfect Dark {{was first}} {{released}} in North America on 22 May 2000 and in Europe on 30 June 2000. A separate Game Boy Color game {{set in the}} same fictional universe, also titled Perfect Dark, was released shortly afterwards <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>supplement</b> to the game. It features a compatibility mode that allows certain cheats within the Nintendo 64 game to alternatively be unlocked via the Transfer Pak. Unlike GoldenEye 007, Perfect Dark received an M (Mature) rating from the ESRB due to its graphic content and adult language. This caused some controversy, as Nintendo {{has a reputation for}} family-friendly games like Mario and Pokémon. Total sales for the game reached 1.3 million copies in the United States. Finally, the game was released in Japan on 21 October. The Japanese launch was a success, with the sale of 35,000 copies in the first week, and 77,000 in total. Worldwide, Perfect Dark sold 3.2 million copies according to game designer Chris Tilston. As a result, a Player's Choice edition was released in 2001.|$|E

5|$|TSR {{decided to}} create a franchise, {{including}} modules, board games, lead figures, andfor the first timenovels. Weis had been hired as an editor; with Hickman, she began working with the author hired to write the novels. They weren't satisfied with the author, and decided they should {{be the ones to}} write the books. They collaborated over a weekend, writing the prologue for the first five chapters of the first novel, Dragons of Autumn Twilight, based on the module Dragons of Despair. TSR liked their treatment and gave them the assignment, firing the author. After two years of development, TSR released Dragons of Autumn Twilight <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>supplement</b> to the Advanced Dungeons & Dragons game. TSR had doubts about the finished novel's sales potential, and attempted to order thirty thousand copies, ultimately ordering the minimum print run of fifty thousand. The success of the novel prompted TSR to publish more copies to meet demand. Dragonlance eventually received ancillary products such as novels, calendars, computer games, and books of artwork.|$|E
