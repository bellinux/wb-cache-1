In return, EMAS provides organisations with many advantages that can easily outweigh these costs. As EMAS is tailored to individual performance improvements, each organisation has to consider different environmental and economic factors.

The financial benefits of an EMAS <b>registered</b> <b>organisation</b> can differ per country. For example, some countries offer substantial reductions of waste fees, lower permitting costs, faster licensing procedures, etc. Nevertheless, several studies have been undertaken to provide reference points on the benefits and costs.In 2009, the European Commission published the Study on the Costs and Benefits of EMAS to <b>Registered</b> <b>Organisations.</b> The {{results of this study}} are summarised in a factsheet.|$|R
