This class of medicinal agents included the drug <b>abacavir.</b> <b>Abacavir</b> was commercialized by GlaxoSmithKline as Ziagen for the treatment of AIDS.|$|E
25|$|Vince later went on {{to invent}} <b>abacavir,</b> an nRTI drug for HIV patients. Elion was awarded the 1988 Nobel Prize in Medicine, partly for the {{development}} of aciclovir. Richard Whitley, a University of Alabama at Birmingham researcher and pioneer in antiviral therapy, was the first to successfully use the drug in humans.|$|E
25|$|Some alleles {{that vary}} in {{frequency}} between specific populations {{have been shown}} to be associated with differential responses to specific drugs. The beta blocker atenolol is an anti-hypertensive medication that is shown to more significantly lower the blood pressure of Caucasian patients than African American patients in the United States. This observation suggests that Caucasian and African American populations have different alleles governing oleic acid biochemistry, which react differentially with atenolol. Similarly, hypersensitivity to the antiretroviral drug <b>abacavir</b> is strongly associated with a single-nucleotide polymorphism that varies in frequency between populations.|$|E
2500|$|Nucleoside reverse {{transcriptase}} inhibitors (NRTI) and nucleotide {{reverse transcriptase}} inhibitors (NtRTI) are nucleoside and nucleotide analogues which inhibit reverse transcription. [...] HIV is an RNA virus and hence unable to become {{integrated into the}} DNA in {{the nucleus of the}} human cell; it must be [...] "reverse" [...] transcribed into DNA. Since the conversion of RNA to DNA is not done in the mammalian cell it is performed by a viral protein which makes it a selective target for inhibition. NRTIs are chain terminators such that once incorporated, work by preventing other nucleosides from also being incorporated into the DNA chain because of the absence of a 3' OH group. Both act as competitive substrate inhibitors. [...] Examples of currently used NRTIs include zidovudine, <b>abacavir,</b> lamivudine, emtricitabine, and tenofovir.|$|E
50|$|Methadone may {{diminish}} the therapeutic effect of <b>Abacavir.</b> <b>Abacavir</b> may decrease the serum concentration of Methadone.|$|E
5000|$|The {{development}} of suspected hypersensitivity reactions to <b>abacavir</b> requires immediate and permanent discontinuation of <b>abacavir</b> therapy in all patients, including patients {{who do not}} possess the HLA-B*5701 allele. On March 1, 2011, the FDA informed the public about an ongoing safety review of <b>abacavir</b> and a possible increased {{risk of heart attack}} associated with the drug. A meta-analysis of 26 studies conducted by the FDA, however, did not find any association between <b>abacavir</b> use and heart attack ...|$|E

50|$|<b>Abacavir</b> is {{eliminated}} via excretion {{in the urine}} (83%) and feces (16%). It is unclear whether <b>abacavir</b> can be removed by hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis.|$|E
50|$|Protease inhibitors such as {{tipranavir}} or ritonovir may {{decrease the}} serum concentration of <b>abacavir</b> through induction of glucuronidation. <b>Abacavir</b> is metabolized by both alcohol dehydrogenase and glucuronidation.|$|E
50|$|Ziagen® - Robert Vince {{worked on}} {{antiviral}} drug candidates at the University of Minnesota, {{where he went}} on to develop carbocyclic nucleosides termed 'carbovirs'. This class of medicinal agents included the drug <b>abacavir.</b> <b>Abacavir</b> was commercialized by GlaxoSmithKline as Ziagen® for the treatment of AIDS.drug, Ziagen® (<b>abacavir)</b> which was the basis for the well-known AIDS drug sold by Glaxo SmithKline.|$|E
50|$|The {{mechanism}} underlying <b>abacavir</b> {{hypersensitivity syndrome}} {{is related to}} the change in the HLA-B*5701 protein product. <b>Abacavir</b> binds with high specificity to the HLA-B*5701 protein, changing the shape and chemistry of the antigen-binding cleft. This results in a change in immunological tolerance and the subsequent activation of abacavir-specific cytotoxic T cells, which produce a systemic reaction known as <b>abacavir</b> hypersensitivity syndrome.|$|E
50|$|<b>Abacavir</b> {{is given}} orally and is rapidly absorbed {{with a high}} {{bioavailability}} of 83%. Solution and tablet have comparable concentrations and bioavailability. <b>Abacavir</b> can be taken with or without food.|$|E
50|$|<b>Abacavir</b> {{should always}} be used in {{combination}} with other antiretroviral agents. <b>Abacavir</b> should not be added as a single agent when antiretroviral regimens are changed due to loss of virologic response.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Abacavir,</b> and {{in general}} NRTIs, do not undergo hepatic {{metabolism}} and therefore have very limited (to none) interaction with the CYP enzymes and drugs that effect these enzymes. That being said there are still few interactions that can affect the absorption or the availability of <b>abacavir.</b> Below are few of the common established drug and food interaction that can take place during <b>abacavir</b> co-administration: ...|$|E
50|$|Resistance to <b>abacavir</b> has {{developed}} in laboratory versions of HIV {{which are also}} resistant to other HIV-specific antiretrovirals such as lamivudine, didanosine and zalcitabine. HIV strains that are resistant to protease inhibitors {{are not likely to}} be resistant to <b>abacavir.</b>|$|E
50|$|Bias is a {{systematic}} {{error in the}} analysis. For example, doctors directed HIV patients at high cardiovascular risk to a particular HIV treatment, <b>abacavir,</b> and lower-risk patients to other drugs, preventing a simple assessment of <b>abacavir</b> compared to other treatments. An analysis that did not correct for this bias unfairly penalised <b>abacavir,</b> since its patients were more high-risk so more of them had heart attacks. This problem can be very severe, for example, in the observational study.|$|E

50|$|<b>Abacavir</b> is {{generally}} well tolerated. Common side effects include vomiting, trouble sleeping, fever, and feeling tired. More severe side effects include hypersensitivity, liver damage, and lactic acidosis. Genetic testing can indicate {{whether a person}} is at higher risk of developing hypersensitivity. Symptoms of hypersensitivity include rash, vomiting, and shortness of breath. <b>Abacavir</b> is in the NRTI class of medications, which work by blocking reverse transcriptase, an enzyme needed for HIV virus replication. Within the NRTI class, <b>abacavir</b> is a carbocyclic nucleoside.|$|E
50|$|Common {{symptoms}} of <b>abacavir</b> hypersensitivity syndrome include fever, malaise, nausea, and diarrhea. Some patients may also develop a skin rash. Symptoms of AHS typically manifest within {{six weeks of}} treatment using <b>abacavir,</b> although they may be confused with {{symptoms of}} HIV, immune restoration disease, hypersensitivity syndromes associated with other drugs, or infection. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) released an alert concerning <b>abacavir</b> and abacavir-containing medications on July 24, 2008, and the FDA-approved drug label for <b>abacavir</b> recommends pre-therapy screening for the HLA-B*5701 allele {{and the use of}} alternative therapy in subjects with this allele. Additionally, both the Clinical Pharmacogenetics Implementation Consortium and the Dutch Pharmacogenetics Working Group recommend use of an alternative therapy in individuals with the HLA-B*5701 allele.|$|E
50|$|<b>Abacavir</b> {{can cross}} the blood-brain barrier. <b>Abacavir</b> is metabolized {{primarily}} through the enzymes alcohol dehydrogenase and glucuronyl transferase to an inactive carboxylate and glucuronide metabolites. It has a half life of approximately 1.5-2.0 hours. If {{a person has}} liver failure, abacavir’s half life is increased by 58%.|$|E

50|$|People with {{liver disease}} should be {{cautious}} about using <b>abacavir</b> because it can aggravate the condition. Signs of liver problems include nausea and vomiting, abdominal pain, dark-colored urine and yellowing of the skin or whites of the eyes. The use of nucleoside drugs such as <b>abacavir</b> can very rarely cause lactic acidosis. Signs of lactic acidosis include fast or irregular heartbeat, unusual muscle pain, fatigue, difficulty breathing and stomach pain with nausea and vomiting. <b>Abacavir</b> {{can also lead to}} immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome, a change in body fat as well as an increased risk of heart attack.|$|E
50|$|<b>Abacavir</b> (ABC) is a {{medication}} {{used to prevent}} and treat HIV/AIDS. Similar to other nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs), <b>abacavir</b> is used together with other HIV medications, and is not recommended by itself. It is taken by mouth as a tablet or solution and {{may be used in}} children over the age of three months.|$|E
50|$|<b>Abacavir</b> is {{contraindicated}} for use {{in infants}} under 3 months of age.|$|E
50|$|Among {{people with}} human {{immunodeficiency}} virus (HIV) infection, a version of HLA-B designated HLA-B*5701 is associated with an extreme sensitivity to <b>abacavir.</b> This drug is a treatment for HIV-1 that slows {{the spread of the}} virus in the body. People with <b>abacavir</b> hypersensitivity often develop a fever, chills, rash, upset stomach, and other symptoms when treated with this drug.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Abacavir,</b> {{also called}} ABC, has the trade name Ziagen, is an analog of guanosine.|$|E
50|$|<b>Abacavir</b> is a {{nucleotide}} {{reverse transcriptase}} inhibitor. Specifically, <b>abacavir</b> is a guanosine analogue that interferes with HIV viral RNA-dependent DNA polymerase, ultimately resulting in inhibition of replication of HIV. Dolutegravir inhibits the HIV replication cycle by binding to the integrase active site and inhibiting the strand transfer step of HIV-1 DNA integration. Lamivudine is a cytosine analogue that inhibits HIV reverse transcription by terminating the viral DNA chain.|$|E
50|$|<b>Abacavir</b> tablets {{and oral}} solution, in {{combination}} with other antiretroviral agents, are indicated for the treatment of HIV-1 infection.|$|E
50|$|The {{antiviral}} drug aciclovir, {{often used in}} herpes treatment, and the anti-HIV drug <b>abacavir,</b> are structurally similar to guanosine.|$|E

50|$|Carbocyclic analogues of {{dideoxyadenosine}} {{were investigated}} for their anti-HIV activity. Minimal activity was first observed. Many nucleoside analogues were prepared and examined {{but only one}} had significant activity and satisfied the requirements for clinical use. That was 2´,3´-didehydro analogue of dideoxyadenosine. Insertion of a cyclopropyl group on its 6-amino nitrogen of the adenine ring increased lipophilicity and thus enhanced brain penetration. The resulting compound is known as <b>abacavir</b> (see table 3). <b>Abacavir</b> {{was approved by the}} FDA for use in therapy of HIV-1 infections in December 1998.|$|E
