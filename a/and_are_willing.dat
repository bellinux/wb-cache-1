The organization supports women wishing to leave the industry, but does not try to persuade them to do so. The group does not focus upon conversion but rather on communicating its message that Christians exist who are not judging female sex workers <b>and</b> <b>are</b> <b>willing</b> to accept them. The organization also helps {{both women and men}} seeking to overcome pornography addiction.|$|E

25|$|When making {{decisions}} about customer service, the retailer must balance the customer's desire for full-service against the customer's willingness {{to pay for the}} cost of delivering supporting services. Self-service is a very cost efficient way of delivering services since the retailer harnesses the customers labour power to carry out many of the retail tasks. However, many customers appreciate full service <b>and</b> <b>are</b> <b>willing</b> to pay a premium for the benefits of full-service.|$|E

500|$|The Indonesian film {{community}} began {{celebrating the}} first day of Darah dan Doa shooting, 30 March, as National Film Day in 1950. In a 1962 conference of the National Film Board of Indonesia, the date was given more formal recognition as National Film Day, and Darah dan Doa was recognised as the first [...] "national film". National Film Day was formally established in 1999, when President B. J. Habibie passed Presidential Decree no. 25/1999. According to actor turned film director Slamet Rahardjo, the commemoration is so that [...] "Indonesians acknowledge their local film industry <b>and</b> <b>are</b> <b>willing</b> to develop it".|$|E

500|$|Tourism {{developers}} have marketed Tana Toraja as an exotic adventure—an area rich in culture {{and off the}} beaten track. Western tourists expected to see stone-age villages and pagan funerals. Toraja is for tourists who have {{gone as far as}} Bali <b>and</b> <b>are</b> <b>willing</b> {{to see more of the}} wild, [...] "untouched" [...] islands. However, they were more likely to see a Torajan wearing a hat and denim, living in a Christian society. Tourists felt that the tongkonan and other Torajan rituals had been preconceived to make profits, and complained that the destination was too commercialised. This has resulted in several clashes between Torajans and tourism developers, whom Torajans see as outsiders.|$|E

She commented, [...] "My music is for the time when people want to turn out the lights, listen and escape into another world ... to dream places ... to little magical places in which the listener can participate and become involved." [...] Regarding a potential audience, Hubbard said, [...] "My music is for intelligent listeners, who don't mind if I change chords, <b>and</b> <b>are</b> <b>willing</b> to see what happens next." [...] Explaining why written text did not accompany the songs, Hubbard said, [...] "I wrote lots of poetry. But somehow it didn't feel right to have lyrics with the pieces – I'd rather leave that slot open for the listener." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{developers}} intended Ultima Underworld to be {{a realistic}} and interactive [...] "dungeon simulation", {{rather than a}} straightforward role-playing game. For example, many objects in the game have no actual use, while a lit torch may be used on corn to create popcorn. Weapons deteriorate with use, and the player character must eat and rest; light sources burn out unless extinguished before sleeping. A physics system allows, among other things, for items to bounce when thrown against surfaces. The game contains non-player characters (NPCs) with whom the player may interact by selecting dialogue choices from a menu. Most NPCs have possessions, <b>and</b> <b>are</b> <b>willing</b> to trade them. The game was designed to give players [...] "a palette of strategies" [...] with which to approach situations, and its simulation systems allow for emergent gameplay.|$|E

The story was serialised daily in , Belgium's leading francophone newspaper, from June 1942 to January 1943 amidst the German occupation of Belgium during World War II. The story revolves around young reporter Tintin, his dog Snowy, {{and his friend}} Captain Haddock, who discover a riddle left by Haddock's ancestor, the 17th century Sir Francis Haddock, which could lead them to the hidden treasure of the pirate Red Rackham. To unravel the riddle, Tintin and Haddock must obtain three identical models of Sir Francis's ship, the Unicorn, but they discover that criminals are also after these model ships <b>and</b> <b>are</b> <b>willing</b> to kill {{in order to obtain}} them.|$|E

Reason can take over later. I had a ball!" [...] Sonia Chopra of Sify gave it 3 out of 5, and mentioned, [...] "Debut director Karan Malhotra shows great promise in making the film visually arresting and maintaining the consistency of performances. But remaking a cult film means you have big shoes to fill. If you’re a loyalist of the late Mukul Anand’s Agneepath, you’re likely to have reservations with this one. But if you leave the comparisons aside <b>and</b> <b>are</b> <b>willing</b> to forgive the faults, Agneepath is worth a watch essentially to savor Hrithik’s performance." [...] Rajeev Masand of CNN-IBN gave Agneepath 3 out of 5 and said, [...] "It is in the end, an old-fashioned revenge drama treated in that melodramatic, over-the-top style. You're not likely to be bored by the intense action and the solid performances, but prepare to be exhausted by just how long this film plays on." ...|$|E
500|$|Miss Freda Whitlam (born 1920), {{sister of}} Prime Minister Gough Whitlam was {{principal}} between 1958 and 1976. It {{was a period}} of great social transition. [...] In 1968 Miss Whitlam wrote: 'Ours is a world where each year we become more conscious of how quickly and radically our environment is changing. [...] Technology is taking the drudgery out of our lives and opening up exciting opportunities for those who have a good general education <b>and</b> <b>are</b> <b>willing</b> to think positively and creatively. [...] Here we help the girls with this aim in view.' In 1970, after the Rev. Bill McLeod spoke to some of the seniors and advised those intending to become a nurse or a teacher to learn Greek or Italian (to aid communication with immigrants), Miss Whitlam took up the suggestion: 'We have people with time to do something after the exams {{at the end of each}} year - let's organise Greek classes for them'. In March 1972 the school also produced a newsletter ΕΛΛΗΝΙΚΑ ΝΕΑ providing background on Greek culture and language and a bibliography of relevant books in the school library.|$|E

Billboards Chris Payne wrote that the song keeps the energy from [...] "Lucky Strike" [...] strong, and contains {{one of the most memorable}} choruses on Overexposed.
