5|$|Swedish debate <b>about</b> <b>America</b> {{remained}} mostly theoretical {{before the}} 19th century, since very few Swedes had any personal {{experience of the}} nation. Emigration was illegal and population {{was seen as the}} wealth of nations. However, the Swedish population doubled between 1750 and 1850, and as population growth outstripped economic development, it gave rise to fears of overpopulation based on the influential population theory of Thomas Malthus. In the 1830s, the laws against emigration were repealed.|$|E
5|$|For {{three of}} the novels, Goldfinger, Live and Let Die and Dr. No, it is Bond the British agent who has to sort out what {{turns out to be}} an American problem, and Black points out that {{although}} it is American assets that are under threat in Dr. No, a British agent and a British warship, HMS Narvik, are sent with British soldiers to the island {{at the end of the}} novel to settle the matter. Fleming became increasingly jaundiced <b>about</b> <b>America,</b> and his comments in the penultimate novel You Only Live Twice reflect this; Bond's responses to Tanaka's comments reflect the declining relationship between Britain and America—in sharp contrast to the warm, co-operative relationship between Bond and Leiter in the earlier books.|$|E
5|$|When Crèvecœur {{offered his}} {{manuscript}} essays to the London publishers Davies & Davis in 1782, they were initially {{skeptical about the}} potential for the Letters to be successful. However, the work proved to be instantly popular in England for a variety of reasons. Proponents of political reform such as William Godwin and Thomas Paine approved of the radical anti-government implications of its message. Romantic writers admired, and were influenced by, its evocation of the natural landscape and the individual's relationship to it. More widely, in the final years of the Revolutionary War, the public was eager for the documentary detail Letters provided <b>about</b> <b>America.</b> The popularity of the book led to a second edition being called for only a year later.|$|E

25|$|Updike's novels <b>about</b> <b>America</b> {{almost always}} contain {{references}} to political {{events of the}} time.

25|$|As one of {{the great}} works of the Revolutionary period was written by a Frenchman, so too was a work <b>about</b> <b>America</b> from this generation.

25|$|Returning to New York in 1938, Milius {{began making}} {{contributions}} to the theater scene. She designed costumes for the Dave Doran Memorial Committee modern dance performance, which served as a fundraiser for Communist Party trade union director Dave Doran, who died in combat as the youngest commander in the Abraham Lincoln Brigade. She also designed costumes for a musical called A Song <b>About</b> <b>America,</b> which depicted the Boston Tea Party, the Steel strike of 1919 and other revolutionary American moments.

25|$|The Norton Anthology {{followed}} {{in the footsteps of}} similar ventures devoted to women's literature and African-American literature. It was greeted with an enthusiastic reception. Booklist gave it a starred review. It was noted in, among other places, The Boston Globe, Smithsonian, the American Book Review, World Literature Today, Literal, and NPR’s On Point with Tom Ashbrook. Erica Jong said “Ilan Stavans has spread a feast of Latino literature before us.” Cornel West called it ”an instant classic.” And Felipe Fernández-Armesto of University of Notre Dame stated: “Imaginatively conceived, painstakingly executed, stunningly broad, profoundly stirring, endlessly engaging, this book can change the way the world thinks <b>about</b> <b>America</b> and the way Americans think about themselves.” However, it was criticized for its subjective approach, including few authors born in Central America.|$|E
500|$|Sgt. Pepper {{is about}} Britain, and the Summer of Love was always <b>about</b> <b>America.</b> The only {{song on the}} album that {{approaches}} the ideology and rhetoric of the hippie counterculture was George Harrison's sole contribution, the lush sitar-washed [...] "Within You Without You", and it follows that Harrison was the only Beatle to have visited Haight-Ashbury {{at the peak of}} the scene. Even then, Eastern philosophy informed the lyric more deeply than did acid culture, and it's still a dense and stunning composition no matter its ideology.|$|E

500|$|In a 2011 interview, music {{producer}} and radio host Kim Fowley identified [...] "Blue Jay Way" [...] {{as the first}} song in which {{a member of the}} Beatles wrote <b>about</b> <b>America</b> and cited it as evidence of Harrison's standing as [...] "the most American of all the Beatles" [...] during the 1960s. Fowley highlighted this connection – including Harrison's friendships with David Crosby of the Byrds and other California-based musicians, such as Leon Russell – as the foundation for rock music's first all-star charity concert, the Concert for Bangladesh, which Harrison staged in New York in August 1971.|$|E
500|$|Leslie and Tom {{arrive at}} the pageant. Leslie, who wants the Miss Pawnee winner to be dignified and graceful, favors Susan (Anne Elizabeth Gregory), a student and children's {{hospital}} volunteer. But the other judges favor Trish (April Marie Eden), an attractive but untalented and unintelligent woman. Tom is particularly impressed with Trish, even when she answers Leslie's question about how [...] "we as citizens can improve on the great experiment?" [...] by making fluffy remarks <b>about</b> <b>America</b> and expressing a distaste for immigrants. April puts on an act by {{pretending to be a}} shallow beauty contestant, but instantly quits when she learns the $600 prize actually consists of gift certificates for a fence company.|$|E
500|$|A {{more recent}} American immigrant, Ernst Skarstedt, who visited Sweden in 1885, {{received}} the same galling impression of upper-class arrogance and anti-Americanism. The laboring classes, in their turn, appeared to him coarse and degraded, drinking heavily in public, speaking in a stream of curses, making obscene jokes in front of women and children. Skarstedt felt surrounded by [...] "arrogance {{on one side and}} obsequiousness on the other, a manifest scorn for menial labor, a desire to appear to be more than one was". This traveller too was incessantly hearing American civilization and culture denigrated from the depths of upper-class Swedish prejudice: [...] "If I, in all modesty, told something <b>about</b> <b>America,</b> it could happen that in reply I was informed that this could not possibly be so or that the matter was better understood in Sweden." ...|$|E

500|$|However, {{negative}} reviews, {{like the}} one from New York Times film critic, Janet Maslin, killed the publication of Honeycutt's piece. Maslin said of the final scene of the movie, [...] "Anything this moment reveals about Vietnam and <b>about</b> <b>America,</b> not to mention about dogs and merry-go-rounds, has been said better elsewhere." [...] Critic Richard Freeman found Barbara Hershey's character [...] "moronic", and referred to the film as [...] "twaddle." [...] Freeman said it was [...] "fraught with symbolism. Or maybe it is just fraught". He further said of the film, [...] "Actually, it's about David Carradine, of whom the less said the better". The Kokomo Tribune called the story [...] "pointless". When Carradine read the reviews, {{he went back to}} the hotel bathroom and threw up. It wasn't just that the critics didn't like the picture; they were angry at me for making it,' Carradine said.
