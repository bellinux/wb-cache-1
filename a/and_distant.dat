5|$|DuMont {{survived the}} early 1950s {{only because of}} WDTV in Pittsburgh, the lone {{commercial}} VHF station {{in what was then}} the sixth-largest market. WDTV's only competition came from UHF stations <b>and</b> <b>distant</b> stations from Johnstown, Pennsylvania; Youngstown, Ohio; and Wheeling, West Virginia. No other commercial VHF station signed on in Pittsburgh until 1957, giving WDTV a de facto monopoly on television in the area. Since WDTV carried secondary affiliations with the other three networks, DuMont used this as a bargaining chip to get its programs cleared in other large markets.|$|E

5|$|Many organs, {{particularly}} those {{built in the}} early 20th century, are contained {{in one or more}} rooms called organ chambers.

5|$|After briefly reading law in Columbus, Ohio, Hayes moved east {{to attend}} Harvard Law School in 1843. Graduating with an LL.B, he was {{admitted}} to the Ohio bar in 1845 and opened his own law office in Lower Sandusky (now Fremont). Business was slow at first, but he gradually attracted a few clients and also represented his uncle Sardis in real estate litigation. In 1847, Hayes became ill with what his doctor thought to be tuberculosis. Thinking a change in climate would help, he considered enlisting in the Mexican–American War, but on his doctor's advice he instead visited family in New England. Returning from there, Hayes and his uncle Sardis made a long journey to Texas, where Hayes visited with Guy M. Bryan, a Kenyon classmate <b>and</b> <b>distant</b> relative. Business remained meager on his return to Lower Sandusky, and Hayes decided to move to Cincinnati.|$|E
5|$|Anshei Israel Synagogue is a {{historic}} synagogue located in Lisbon, Connecticut, United States. The Orthodox congregation was founded with 15 families and constructed the synagogue in 1936. It was built by George Allen & Sons. The interior is a single room that is lined with five benches before an altar which held the sacred ark. The congregation's membership dwindled throughout the 1940s and 1950s, limiting the services to holidays before finally closing in the early 1980s. Rules in the congregation were not as strictly enforced as in the Old World, as there was no curtain to separate the sexes <b>and</b> <b>distant</b> members were allowed to drive {{part of the way}} to its services. The Town of Lisbon took ownership of the property in the 1980s. The synagogue is currently maintained by the Lisbon Historical Society. The synagogue was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1995.|$|E

5|$|As {{with all}} titles on the Xbox 360, Halo 3 fully {{supports}} 5.1 surround sound audio. In the game, {{there are over}} 50,000 pieces of audio, with nearly 40,000 of those being NPC dialogue. This {{is far more than}} in either of the preceding Halo titles; Halo 2 had over 15,000 pieces of dialogue. The AI controlling this dialogue is designed to ensure the exchanges flow naturally and convincingly. Separate recordings were made for nearby <b>and</b> <b>distant</b> gunfire to make for a more believable sound experience in the public beta, and the finished game uses Waves Audio plugins to modify dialog and other audio in-game depending on conditions. Distant gunfire sounds, which may first seem like prerecorded ambient sound, may often be the result of an actual firefight happening elsewhere in the game.|$|E

Mrs. Jennings invites Elinor and Marianne to spend some time with her in London, and Marianne hopes she will see Willoughby. However, he does not visit or reply to her letters.|$|E

40|$|SUMMARY: The {{duplication}} of gonadal vessels is mainly {{found on the}} left side, with less numbers of bilateral cases. The objective of this work is describing a case of bilateral {{duplication of}} gonadal veins, where two veins were draining to inferior vena cava, being that the closest vein of kidney medial margin had a thickness of 2. 68 mm <b>and</b> was <b>distant</b> 64. 41 mm of the organ. The second vessel had a thickness of 1. 43 mm <b>and</b> was <b>distant</b> 73. 76 mm. Two veins follow to left renal vein, being that the first vessel had a thickness of 2. 7 mm <b>and</b> was <b>distant</b> 21. 8 mm of the kidney medial margin; the other had a thickness of 1. 64 mm <b>and</b> was <b>distant</b> 35. 13 mm of the organ. The presence of variations on the local of drainage of gonadal vessels has clinical importance for comprehension of origin of varicocele cases, {{as well as the}} recurrence of them after surgical procedures...|$|R
