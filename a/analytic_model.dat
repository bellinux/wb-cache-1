Initial models are focused on field generation by convection in the planet's fluid outer core. It was possible to show the generation of a strong, Earth-like field when the model assumed a uniform core-surface temperature and exceptionally high viscosities for the core fluid. Computations which incorporated more realistic parameter values yielded magnetic fields that were less Earth-like, but also point the way to model refinements which may ultimately lead to an accurate <b>analytic</b> <b>model.</b> Slight variations in the core-surface temperature, in the range of a few millikelvins, result in significant increases in convective flow and produce more realistic magnetic fields.|$|E

5000|$|Shu {{is known}} for {{pioneering}} theoretical work in a diverse set of fields of astrophysics, including the origin of meteorites, the birth and early evolution of stars {{and the structure of}} spiral galaxies. One of his most highly cited works is a 1977 seminal paper describing the collapse of a dense giant molecular cloud core which forms a star. This model (commonly referred to as the [...] "inside-out" [...] collapse model or the [...] "singular isothermal sphere" [...] model) helped provide the basis for much later work on the formation of stars and planetary systems, although it has been criticized for its shortcomings. The model starts from a singular isothermal sphere, collapses from inside-out, and applies self-similarity. The major drawback is that it is unstable and therefore unphysical as an initial condition, though, it demonstrates much of the physics and is the only existing <b>analytic</b> <b>model.</b> Shu has also performed calculations on the structure of planet-forming disks around very young stars, the jets and winds that these stars and their disks generate, and the production of chondrules, inclusions in meteorites. Much of this work has been done in collaboration with his postdocs and graduate students, collectively known as the Shu factory and many of whom have gone on to successful academic careers in their own right.|$|E

40|$|The Distributed Multimedia Play (DMP) is new {{generation}} of multimedia communication systems which provides near-natural virtual collaborations for long- distance users. To approach near-natural perceptions, DMP produces huge amount of traffics and requires very restrict delay of the Multimedia Content packets. If the traffic of a network node of DMP overloads, this node has to drop some packets selectively. To ensure the graceful degradation of quality, a special dropping scheme is designed particularly for the DMP network nodes. This thesis analyzes {{the performance of the}} DMP nodes with the special dropping scheme. This thesis focuses on building <b>analytic</b> <b>models</b> to calculate the delay and loss rate of the traffics of the DMP nodes. Two simulators are developed to verify the <b>analytic</b> <b>models.</b> Several experiments are carried out on the two simulators to test the performance of the network nodes in different conditions. More specifically, the thesis work will be aiming at the following objectives: 1. 	To provide a concise and clear introduction to DMP and its special dropping scheme. 2. 	To describe the simulation models of the two simulators, explaining their functions and the input and output of them. 3. 	To build <b>analytic</b> <b>models</b> to calculate the delay and the loss rate of the packets passing through one DMP network node or passing through several network nodes of a DMP collaboration. 4. 	To provide some suggestion about how to improve the performance of the DMP networks.
