5|$|According to the {{research}} complied by meteorologist and tornado expert Thomas P. Grazulis, the New Richmond Tornado was the first determined F/EF5 in American history to cause a death toll exceeding 100, as the rating for the Natchez tornado has never been officially determined and the St. Louis-East St. Louis tornado ranked <b>as</b> <b>only</b> an F/EF4. In addition, the Amite-Purvis, 1908 Dixie tornado outbreak and Gainesville, 1936 Tupelo–Gainesville tornado outbreak tornadoes have also both been classified <b>as</b> <b>only</b> F/EF4 tornadoes, making the New Richmond Tornado the fifth deadliest F/EF5 in American history.|$|E

5|$|According to Freitas, {{direct contact}} with civilizations {{significantly}} more advanced than humanity {{would have to take}} place within the Solar System, <b>as</b> <b>only</b> the more advanced society would have the resources and technology to cross interstellar space. Consequently, such contact could only be with civilizations rated as Type II or higher on the Kardashev scale, as Type I civilizations would be incapable of regular interstellar travel. Freitas expected that such interactions would be carefully planned by the more advanced civilization to avoid mass societal shock for humanity.|$|E

5|$|After Gia Long's death, Minh Mạng and Duyệt clashed frequently. As the {{southern}} governor, Duyet had significant autonomy, <b>as</b> <b>only</b> {{the centre of}} Vietnam was under direct royal rule. Duyet was a supporter of Catholic missionaries, while Minh Mạng was a staunch Confucianist. Duyet often disobeyed Minh Mạng's orders, and the emperor attempted to reduce the Duyet's autonomous power, which became easier with the general's death in 1831. The governor's post was abolished and the region was put under direct control.|$|E
5|$|After {{operating}} {{only during}} peak hours {{for more than}} 30years, the closure announcement came on 4 January 1993. The original 1907 lifts at Aldwych required replacement {{at a cost of}} £3million. This was not justifiable <b>as</b> <b>only</b> 450 passengers used the station each day and it was losing London Regional Transport £150,000 per year. The Secretary of State for Transport granted permission on 1 September 1994 to close the station and the branch closed on 30 September.|$|E
5|$|After {{taking over}} the {{administration}} of the country in 1945, the Communist Party changed the administrative model to that of the Soviet Union (regions and raions) in 1950, but changed it back in 1968. Nevertheless, the county borders set then were quite different from those present during the interbellum, <b>as</b> <b>only</b> 39 counties were formed from the 56 remaining after the war.|$|E

5|$|At present, {{there are}} two major methods of {{producing}} isotopes of transplutonium elements: (1) irradiation of the lighter elements with either neutrons or (2) accelerated charged particles. The first method is most important for applications, <b>as</b> <b>only</b> neutron irradiation using nuclear reactors allows the production of sizeable amounts of synthetic actinides; however, it is limited to relatively light elements. The advantage of the second method is that elements heavier than plutonium, as well as neutron-deficient isotopes, can be obtained, which are not formed during neutron irradiation.|$|E
5|$|Behind the scenes, HIAG {{cultivated}} {{close relationships}} with the ruling Christian Democratic Union (CDU) and the main opposition Social Democratic Party (SPD), garnering attention by inflating its membership numbers and influence. In meetings with politicians in the early 1950s, HIAG claimed to represent 2 million potential voters, a vast exaggeration <b>as</b> <b>only</b> 250,000 Waffen-SS veterans were living in West Germany at that time.|$|E
5|$|Brundage {{took the}} {{position}} that as the Germans had reported nondiscrimination to the IOC, and the IOC had accepted that report, US Olympic authorities were bound by that determination. Nevertheless, it became increasingly apparent that with the Nazi actions, no Jew was likely to secure {{a place on the}} German team. Brundage stated on this issue that <b>as</b> <b>only</b> 12Jews had ever represented Germany in the Olympics, it would hardly be surprising if none did in 1936.|$|E

5|$|Following Juventus's {{return to}} Serie A, Del Piero {{was locked in}} months of fractious {{negotiations}} over the signing of a new contract with Juventus' new management.

This was quite a staggering turnaround in his fortunes, <b>as</b> <b>only</b> two weeks earlier, he was dropped by Claudio Ranieri for the Serie A match with Fiorentina, and was then axed from Roberto Donadoni's Italy squad for the games with Georgia and South Africa.|$|E
5|$|Harold Godwinson's {{victory was}} short-lived, <b>as</b> <b>only</b> {{a few weeks}} later he was {{defeated}} by William the Conqueror at the Battle of Hastings. The fact that Harold had to make a forced march to fight Hardrada at Stamford Bridge and then move at utmost speed south to meet the Norman invasion, all in less than three weeks, is widely seen as a primary factor in William's victory at Hastings.|$|E
