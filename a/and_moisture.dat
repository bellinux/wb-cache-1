5|$|Actinium reacts rapidly {{with oxygen}} <b>and</b> <b>moisture</b> in air forming a white coating of {{actinium}} oxide that impedes further oxidation. As with most lanthanides and actinides, actinium {{exists in the}} oxidation state +3, and the Ac3+ ions are colorless in solutions. The oxidation state +3 originates from the 6d17s2 electronic configuration of actinium, with three valence electrons that are easily donated to give the stable closed-shell structure of the noble gas radon. The rare oxidation state +2 is only known for actinium dihydride (AcH2); even this may in reality be an electride compound like its lighter congener LaH2.|$|E

However, ytterbium compounds cause irritation to human skin and eyes, and some might be teratogenic. Metallic ytterbium dust can spontaneously combust, and the resulting fumes are hazardous. Ytterbium fires cannot be extinguished using water, and only dry chemical class D fire extinguishers can extinguish the fires.|$|E
5|$|An {{elephant}} uses mud as a sunscreen, protecting {{its skin}} from ultraviolet light. Although tough, an elephant's skin is very sensitive. Without regular mud baths {{to protect it}} from burning, insect bites <b>and</b> <b>moisture</b> loss, an elephant's skin suffers serious damage. After bathing, the elephant will usually use its trunk to blow dust onto its body and this dries into a protective crust. Elephants have difficulty releasing heat through the skin because of their low surface-area-to-volume ratio, which is many times smaller than that of a human. They have even been observed lifting up their legs, presumably in an effort to expose their soles to the air.|$|E

5|$|Cannon {{recovered}} from the sea are often extensively damaged from exposure to salt water; because of this, electrolytic reduction treatment is required to forestall the process of corrosion. The cannon is then washed in deionized water to remove the electrolyte, and is treated in tannic acid, which prevents further rust and gives the metal a bluish-black colour. After this process, cannons on display may be protected from oxygen <b>and</b> <b>moisture</b> by a wax sealant. A coat of polyurethane may also be painted over the wax sealant, to prevent the wax-coated cannon from attracting dust in outdoor displays.|$|E
5|$|Despite forming {{fairly close}} to the Lesser Antilles, no {{tropical}} cyclone warnings were issued for the islands, as the official forecast correctly foresaw that Philippe would stay well to the east. A tropical storm warning was issued for Bermuda on September 23, but proved redundant when Philippe dissipated well {{to the south of}} the island. The storm still brought gusty winds <b>and</b> <b>moisture</b> to the island, with 0.15inches (3.8mm) of precipitation reported on September 23. The circulation that absorbed Philippe dropped light rainfall on the island, and was responsible for the lowest barometric pressure during the month.|$|E

40|$|Soil {{electrical}} conductivity (ECa) is a soil quality indicator associated to attributes interesting to site-specific soil management such as soil <b>moisture</b> <b>and</b> texture.

Soil ECa, <b>moisture</b> <b>and</b> clay content were evaluated by statistical, geostatistical and regression analyses. Semivariogram models, adjusted for soil moisture, had strong spatial dependence, but the relationship between soil <b>moisture</b> <b>and</b> soil ECa was obtained only {{in one of the}} experimental fields, where soil <b>moisture</b> <b>and</b> clay content range was higher. In this same field, coefficients of determinations between soil <b>moisture</b> <b>and</b> clay content were above 0. 70.

5|$|Turbulent {{forces in}} {{air and water}} affect the {{environment}} and ecosystem distribution, form and dynamics. On a planetary scale, ecosystems are affected by circulation patterns in the global trade winds. Wind power and the turbulent forces it creates can influence heat, nutrient, and biochemical profiles of ecosystems. For example, wind running {{over the surface of}} a lake creates turbulence, mixing the water column and influencing the environmental profile to create thermally layered zones, affecting how fish, algae, {{and other parts of the}} aquatic ecosystem are structured. Wind speed and turbulence also influence evapotranspiration rates and energy budgets in plants and animals. Wind speed, temperature <b>and</b> <b>moisture</b> content can vary as winds travel across different land features and elevations. For example, the westerlies come into contact with the coastal and interior mountains of western North America to produce a rain shadow on the leeward side of the mountain. The air expands <b>and</b> <b>moisture</b> condenses as the winds increase in elevation; this is called orographic lift and can cause precipitation. This environmental process produces spatial divisions in biodiversity, as species adapted to wetter conditions are range-restricted to the coastal mountain valleys and unable to migrate across the xeric ecosystems (e.g., of the Columbia Basin in western North America) to intermix with sister lineages that are segregated to the interior mountain systems.|$|E

Wind shear in the horizontal occurs near these boundaries.|$|E
5|$|A soft, silvery-white {{radioactive}} metal, actinium reacts rapidly {{with oxygen}} <b>and</b> <b>moisture</b> in air forming a white coating of actinium oxide that prevents further oxidation. As with most lanthanides and many actinides, actinium assumes oxidation state +3 {{in nearly all}} its chemical compounds. Actinium is found only in traces in uranium and thorium ores as the isotope 227Ac, which decays with a half-life of 21.772 years, predominantly emitting beta and sometimes alpha particles, and 228Ac, which is beta active with a half-life of 6.15 hours. One tonne of natural uranium in ore contains about 0.2 milligrams of actinium-227, and one tonne of natural thorium contains about 5 nanograms of actinium-228. The close similarity of {{physical and chemical properties}} of actinium and lanthanum makes separation of actinium from the ore impractical. Instead, the element is prepared, in milligram amounts, by the neutron irradiation of 226 in a nuclear reactor. Owing to its scarcity, high price and radioactivity, actinium has no significant industrial use. Its current applications include a neutron source and an agent for radiation therapy targeting cancer cells in the body.|$|E
