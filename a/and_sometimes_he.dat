5|$|A {{different}} view of the myth's end focuses on Horus's sole triumph. In this version, Set is not reconciled with his rival, but utterly defeated, <b>and</b> <b>sometimes</b> <b>he</b> is exiled from Egypt or even destroyed. His defeat and humiliation is more pronounced in sources from later periods of Egyptian history, when he was increasingly equated with disorder and evil, and the Egyptians no longer saw him {{as an integral part}} of natural order.|$|E
5|$|When Davidson {{returned}} home {{he found that}} Molly was six months pregnant. The dates of his service leave during 1918 made it apparent {{that he was not}} the father. A daughter was born on 21 June 1919; the likely father was a Canadian army colonel, Ernest Doudemain, a friend from Davidson's schooldays who had lodged at the rectory {{in the latter part of}} 1918. Although deeply upset by his wife's infidelity, Davidson accepted the child—who bore some resemblance to him—as his own. To escape the poisoned atmosphere in Stiffkey he applied for a year's posting as chaplain to a hill station at Simla in India, but the opportunity fell through. Instead, Davidson resumed his pre-war routine of spending his weeks in London, departing early on Monday morning and returning late on Saturday. Sometimes, through a missed rail connection or other mishap, he was barely in time for the Sunday morning service at Stiffkey, <b>and</b> <b>sometimes</b> <b>he</b> would fail to arrive at all.|$|E

You know it was always spirits, and generally brandy:—and that makes such work with them. You've no idea what he's like when <b>he's</b> evil-drunk. <b>Sometimes</b> <b>he's</b> all for talk, <b>sometimes</b> <b>he's</b> laughing at everything, <b>and</b> <b>sometimes</b> <b>he's</b> just snappy. <b>And</b> then——" [...] here her tones grew ominous, [...] "——he'll come home evil-drunk." ...|$|R

25|$|In 1993, Foreman {{received}} another title shot, {{although this}} was for the vacant WBO title. Foreman's opponent was Tommy Morrison, a young prospect known for his punching power. Morrison retreated throughout the fight, refusing to trade toe-to-toe, <b>and</b> <b>sometimes</b> <b>he</b> {{turned his back on}} Foreman. The strategy paid off and he outboxed Foreman from long range. After 12 rounds, Morrison won a unanimous decision.|$|E
25|$|Jeremiah is {{an aging}} {{member of the}} TNT. He is an Italian immigrant, and a running gag of the series {{is that he is}} an extreme hypochondriac who suffers from many {{diseases}} or medical syndromes (<b>and</b> <b>sometimes,</b> <b>he</b> even suffers from diseases he invented). He is bald and nearly toothless, and he usually sleeps around in the flower shop with The Boss. He is usually on guard duty and never on active missions due to his age, but sometimes proves crucial to missions. Another running gag is his ability to sleep through most extreme situations without waking up. He is a former street vendor and a hermit, which caused his bad health.|$|E
25|$|Back in London, Sargent {{was quickly}} busy again. His working methods were by then well-established, {{following}} {{many of the}} steps employed by other master portrait painters before him. After securing a commission through negotiations which he carried out, Sargent would visit the client's home {{to see where the}} painting was to hang. He would often review a client's wardrobe to pick suitable attire. Some portraits were done in the client's home, but more often in his studio, which was well-stocked with furniture and background materials he chose for proper effect. He usually required eight to ten sittings from his clients, although he would try to capture the face in one sitting. He usually kept up pleasant conversation <b>and</b> <b>sometimes</b> <b>he</b> would take a break and play the piano for his sitter. Sargent seldom used pencil or oil sketches, and instead laid down oil paint directly. Finally, he would select an appropriate frame.|$|E

500|$|According to Weiser, Gekko's {{style of}} {{speaking}} {{was inspired by}} Stone. [...] "When I was writing some of the dialogue I would listen to Oliver on the phone <b>and</b> <b>sometimes</b> <b>he</b> talks very rapid-fire, the way Gordon Gekko does". Stone cites as influences on his approach to business, the novels of Upton Sinclair, Sinclair Lewis and Victor Hugo, and the films of Paddy Chayefsky because {{they were able to}} make a complicated subject clear to the audience. Stone set the film in 1985 because insider trading scandals culminated in 1985 and 1986. This led to anachronisms in the script, including a reference to the Space Shuttle Challenger disaster, which had not yet occurred.|$|E
500|$|Buck {{had been}} {{exempted}} {{from the military}} draft, but he felt serving his country was his patriotic duty and enlisted as a naval aviator in 1943. Buck served in the South Seas during the war. Once Buck enlisted, Rockwell worked from memory and photographs to complete his illustrations, <b>and</b> <b>sometimes</b> <b>he</b> only worked Gillis into the background via a photograph on the wall. Rockwell was going to discontinue the series, but Post editors objected because his character was too popular. [...] The public enjoyed closely scrutinizing Gillis' affairs. Gillis was so popular that at one point, the Post was receiving hundreds of letter inquiring about the tribulations of the character who was perceived by many as real, and concern for the private was particularly high among families named Gillis.|$|E
500|$|Doggett and Reitz {{decide to}} talk to Fogelman. Initially, he is {{apprehensive}} and nearly sends Doggett hurtling through the roof. It is revealed that Fogelman's powers are temperamental <b>and</b> <b>sometimes</b> <b>he</b> cannot control them, {{as was the case}} with the deaths of Mike and Blake. Reyes and Scully show up and convince him that his powers could positively impact the world. The agents take him to Washington, D.C. and demonstrate his powers to Walter Skinner (Mitch Pileggi) by making him float in midair. Suddenly, however, Fogelman collapses. Scully later reports that his body is destroying itself because of his extreme power. Doggett realizes that Fogelman must stop using his powers; he notes that his power had faded earlier when Dr. Rietz was studying him as a boy. Doggett tells Rietz that his power faded because, with Rietz around, Fogelman did not feel lonely. Rietz visits Fogelman in the hospital, and the two rekindle their friendship, saving Fogelman's life. Scully laments the fact that there may not be any vindication for the X-Files, but that cases like Fogelman's might show that there is proof of [...] "more important things." ...|$|E

2500|$|It {{was obvious}} that his {{drinking}} problem was getting worse. By this time, Bill and Martha fought {{all the time and}} she told him to stop drinking or move out. He then did move out into a room in their pool house. Martha still took care of him <b>and</b> <b>sometimes</b> <b>he</b> would come in the house to eat, but he ate very little. [...] "There were days we never saw him," [...] said his daughter Martha Maria.|$|E
2500|$|Following the Revolution, Saberi {{worked in}} {{different}} political positions {{before deciding to}} leave politics. He {{was in charge of}} Roshde-Adabe-Farsi (...) magazine <b>and</b> <b>sometimes</b> <b>he</b> wrote for the Ettelaat (...) newspaper. He started a column called [...] "Do-Kalame-Harfe-Hesab" [...] (...) in Ettelaat in 1984 that was a starting point for political satires after the revolution. He continued writing for this column for six years until he started his own magazine called Gol-Agha (...) in 1990. His courageous and powerful writings were appreciated by many famous authors such as Mohammad Ali Jamalzadeh. Saberi received first prize in press exhibition of 1992 and 1994 and second prize in 1993. He stopped writing for Ettelaat in 1993.|$|E
2500|$|The {{second most}} {{influential}} codex was Ubay ibn Ka'b’s, a Medinan Muslim {{who served as}} a secretary for Muhammad. It is believed that he may have been more prominent as a Quran specialist than Ibn Masʿud during Muḥammad's lifetime. There are reports that he was responsible for memorizing certain important revelations on legal matters, which from time to time Muhammad asked him to recite. In a few hadith, Ubay is seen in a variety of roles. For instance, the [...] "sheets" [...] of Ubay are sometimes mentioned in some instances instead of those of Ḥafsa, <b>and</b> <b>sometimes</b> <b>he</b> is also mentioned in some hadith instead of Zayd, dictating the Quran to scribes.|$|E

2500|$|Wilson is infamously {{difficult}} to interview, rarely ever giving a long answer. According to Salon writer Peter Gilstrap: [...] "He’s also {{been known to}} get up, extend a hand and blurt out 'Thanks!' well before the allotted time is up. <b>And</b> <b>sometimes</b> <b>he</b> just gets tired and shuts down. None of this, however, {{is due to a}} bad attitude." [...] He admits to having a poor memory, and in interviews, occasionally lies to [...] "test" [...] people. David Oppenheim, who interviewed Wilson in 1966, remembers that [...] "we tried to talk with him but didn't get much out of him. Some guy said 'He's not verbal.' He was odd and he seemed odder." [...] In 2017, the Charlotte Observers Theodon Janes surmised that while Wilson's past struggles with mental illness are widely documented, he still [...] "is faring well enough to write a book ... and to headline [...] hugely ambitious concert tour, so presumably he’s capable of telling people who work for him that he's not up for interviews, if he isn't." [...] When asked about negative comments written in the book, Love responded: [...] "He’s not in charge of his life, like I am mine. His every move is orchestrated and a lot of things he's purported to say, there’s not tape of it. But, I don’t like to put undue pressure on him, either, because I know {{he has a lot of}} issues. Out of compassion, I don't respond to everything that is purportedly said by him." ...|$|E
2500|$|Lyric verse was {{conventionally}} {{accompanied by}} music and dance, and Pindar himself wrote {{the music and}} choreographed the dances for his victory odes. Sometimes he trained the performers {{at his home in}} Thebes, <b>and</b> <b>sometimes</b> <b>he</b> trained them at the venue where they performed. Commissions took him to all parts of the Greek worldto the Panhellenic festivals in mainland Greece (Olympia, Delphi, Corinth and Nemea), westwards to Sicily, eastwards to the seaboard of Asia Minor, north to Macedonia and Abdera (Paean 2) and south to Cyrene on the African coast. Other poets at the same venues vied with him for the favours of patrons. His poetry sometimes reflects this rivalry. For example, Olympian 2 and Pythian 2, composed in honour of the Sicilian tyrants Theron and Hieron following his visit to their courts in 476–75 BC, refer respectively to ravens and an ape, apparently signifying rivals who were engaged in a campaign of smears against himpossibly the poets Simonides and his nephew Bacchylides. Pindar's original treatment of narrative myth, often relating events in reverse chronological order, {{is said to have been}} a favourite target for criticism. Simonides was known to charge high fees for his work and Pindar is said to have alluded to this in Isthmian 2, where he refers to the Muse as [...] "a hireling journeyman". He appeared in many poetry competitions and was defeated five times by his compatriot, the poet Corinna, in revenge of which he called her Boeotian sow in one of his odes (Olympian 6. 89f.).|$|E
