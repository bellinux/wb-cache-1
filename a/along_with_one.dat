5|$|A second {{reservoir}} {{was built}} around 1860 in Brown Cove, between Swirral Edge and Lower Man, <b>along</b> <b>with</b> <b>one</b> {{further down the}} valley in Keppel Cove. These provided water to generate hydroelectric power for the lead mine. The dam in Keppel Cove is still in place, but water now leaks through its base. The remains of the dam in Brown Cove can be seen, but again water leaks freely through it. It is unclear whether there ever was a natural tarn in Brown Cove. Guidebook writers before 1860 refer only to Keppel Cove Tarn {{to the north of}} Swirral Edge.|$|E
5|$|By midday on March 14, the 1st and 2nd Battalions of the ARVN 45th Infantry Regiment slowly melted away, as {{they were}} {{squeezed}} from all sides by the North Vietnamese 24th Regiment. Rather than marching on to Ban Me Thuot to relieve the soldiers of the 45th Infantry Regiment, the ARVN 44th Infantry Regiment were pinned down to fight the enemies’ 24th Regiment. On March 16, South Vietnamese formations at Phuoc An and Nong Trai came under heavy attack. At 8:15am the 3rd Battalion, the last unit from the ARVN 45th Infantry Regiment, was completely wiped out. Subsequently, all South Vietnamese soldiers at Nong Trai were captured <b>along</b> <b>with</b> <b>one</b> helicopter.|$|E

5|$|Public {{dissatisfaction with}} the newly-issued Morgan dollar led the Mint's {{engravers}} to submit designs for the smaller silver coins in 1879. Among those who called for new coinage was editor Richard Watson Gilder of The Century Illustrated Monthly Magazine. Sometime in the early 1880s, he, <b>along</b> <b>with</b> <b>one</b> of his reporters and sculptor Augustus Saint-Gaudens visited Mint Director Burchard to argue {{for the creation of}} new designs. They brought along classic Greek and Roman coins in an attempt to persuade Burchard that the coinage could easily be made more beautiful. The visitors left disappointed, after learning that Burchard considered the much-criticized Morgan dollar as beautiful as any of them.|$|E
5|$|The {{character}} Ephraim Fabricant {{was named}} for real-life murderer Valery Fabrikant, a mechanical engineering professor who shot dead four of his colleagues in {{what became known as}} the Concordia University massacre. In addition, the character's back-story and demise were both intended to echo the case of Jack the Ripper—both were believed to be medically trained, while the use of Fabricant's kidney to send a message is based on the From Hell letter, sent to the police by the Ripper <b>along</b> <b>with</b> <b>one</b> of his victims' kidneys.|$|E

5|$|At {{the same}} time as the {{artillery}} bombardment at KSCB, an attack was launched against Khe Sanh village, seat of Huong Hoa District. The village, three kilometers south of the base, was defended by 160 local troops, plus 15 American advisers and heavy artillery provided from the base. At dawn of 21 January, it was attacked by a roughly 300-strong NVA battalion. Reinforcements were dispatched aboard nine UH-1 helicopters, but were wiped out after landing near the NVA, <b>along</b> <b>with</b> <b>one</b> helicopter. A small ground rescue force from the nearby combat base was repulsed, while the survivors from the village assault evacuated themselves to the combat base. The NVA fought throughout the day, into the next night, and finally completed the capture of Khe Sanh village at 09:30 on 22 January.|$|E
5|$|CR149 {{begins at}} an {{intersection}} with NY52 {{in the community}} of Youngsville. The route progresses northward, passing and paralleling Tremper Road, a dead-end road. CR149 passes by several residential homes in Youngsville, <b>along</b> <b>with</b> <b>one</b> local commercial building. After leaving the community, CR149 continues to the north as Shandelee Road, passing through the residential surroundings. After passing by a few more residences, Shandelee Road makes a bend to the northwest, and into more dense woodlands in the area. About a mile north of Youngsville, CR149 continues its way northward, passing by a local residence, and intersects with Stump Pond Road, which heads westward from the main highway. Shandalee Road makes another bend, this time to the north, passing through moderate development for about another mile. A short distance into the bend, the woodlands that were surrounding the highway clear and the highway becomes surrounded by fields and residential homes.|$|E
5|$|D'Eyncourt, who had {{departed}} Brazil in October {{immediately after the}} contract was signed, returned in March 1911 to display the various design options available to the Brazilian Navy. Armstrong evidently thought the second faction would prevail, so he also took with him everything needed to close a deal on Bacellar's design. By mid-March, Armstrong's contacts in Brazil reported that Leão had convinced the recently elected President Hermes Rodrigues da Fonseca to cancel the design with twelve 14-inch guns {{in favor of a}} smaller ship. The credit may not have laid with Leão alone, though; da Fonseca was already dealing with multiple issues. Most importantly, he {{had to deal with the}} fallout from a large naval revolt in November 1910 (the Revolt of the Lash), which had seen three of the new vessels just purchased by the navy, <b>along</b> <b>with</b> <b>one</b> older coast-defense ship, mutiny against the use of corporal punishment in the navy.|$|E

5|$|Deinonychus teeth {{found in}} {{association}} with fossils of the ornithopod dinosaur Tenontosaurus are quite common in the Cloverly Formation. Two quarries have been discovered that preserve fairly complete Deinonychus fossils near Tenontosaurus fossils. The first, the Yale quarry in the Cloverly of Montana, includes numerous teeth, four adult Deinonychus and one juvenile Deinonychus. The association of this number of Deinonychus skeletons in a single quarry suggests that Deinonychus may have fed on that animal, and perhaps hunted it. Ostrom and Maxwell have even used this information to speculate that Deinonychus might have lived and hunted in packs. The second such quarry is from the Antlers Formation of Oklahoma. The site contains six partial skeletons of Tenontosaurus of various sizes, <b>along</b> <b>with</b> <b>one</b> partial skeleton and many teeth of Deinonychus. One tenontosaur humerus even bears what might be Deinonychus tooth marks. Brinkman et al. (1998) point out that Deinonychus had an adult mass of 70–100 kilograms, whereas adult tenontosaurs were 1–4 metric tons. A solitary Deinonychus could not kill an adult tenontosaur, suggesting that pack hunting is possible.|$|E
5|$|In 2002, Plumb {{was named}} {{as one of}} the 50 most {{influential}} horsemen of the 20th century by the equine magazine Chronicle of the Horse. In 2003, Plumb was inducted to the United States Eventing Association Hall of Fame, <b>along</b> <b>with</b> <b>one</b> of his horses, Plain Sailing. Good Mixture, another of Plumb's horses, was inducted in 2009. In 2008, Plumb became the first (and to date, only) equestrian to be inducted into the United States Olympic Hall of Fame. The United States Eventing Association awarded Plumb their Leading Rider of the Year Award on ten occasions. Plumb is known for his training abilities with both horses and other riders, and as of 2008 he continued to ride and train at his stables in Southern Pines, North Carolina.|$|E
5|$|In April 1931, Siamese King Prajadhipok and Queen Rambai Barni {{traveled}} from Bangkok to Ophir Hall (currently Reid Hall of Manhattanville College).

From Chicago, they took another train, departing at 10:30a.m. on the 21st and arriving at noon on the 22nd, and the trip took 25 hours; the king had requested the train travel slowly, as he was recovering from bronchitis and malaria. The train arrived at the Scarborough station, where journalists, spectators, and video and still photographers met them, <b>along</b> <b>with</b> <b>one</b> of their hosts; they were later driven across the county to stay at Ophir Hall for about six weeks {{in order for a}} cataract operation could be performed by a New York doctor on the king's left eye.

5|$|On 22November 1941, during Operation Crusader, Rawlinson led No.3 Squadron on a bomber escort mission near Bir el Gubi in the morning, and {{a fighter}} sweep {{south-east}} of El Adem in the afternoon. German Messerschmitt Bf109 fighters shot down three Tomahawks {{for the loss}} of two of their own in the first action, Rawlinson claiming a 109 damaged. In the second action, a drawn-out battle for air superiority, the squadron lost six Tomahawks against two 109s destroyed, one of which was claimed by Rawlinson <b>along</b> <b>with</b> <b>one</b> probable and one damaged. He had also taken a shot at a distant 109 and, believing he had missed it, did not claim. After the war it was established that Rawlinson's bullets had damaged the 109 and wounded its pilot, Ernst Düllberg, who made a forced landing back at base. Rawlinson was credited with his final victory on 30November, when he downed an Italian Macchi C.200 in an engagement that saw No.3 Squadron's tally of claims rise to 106 aircraft destroyed.|$|E
5|$|Over the {{following}} four years, a $12 million project to construct storm shelters for residents across the Oklahoma City metropolitan area was enacted. The goal {{was to create a}} safer community in a tornado-prone region. By May 2003, a total of 6,016 safe rooms were constructed. On May 9, 2003, the new initiative was put to the test as a tornado outbreak in the region spawned an F4 tornado, which took a path {{similar to that of the}} Bridge Creek–Moore tornado. Due to the higher standards for public safety, no one was killed by the 2003 tornado, a substantial improvement in just four years. On May 20, 2013, an EF5 tornado impacted some of the same areas affected by the 1999 storm, tracking through the heart of Moore. Throughout the city, 24 people were killed (<b>along</b> <b>with</b> <b>one</b> additional person who died as an indirect result of the tornado) and more than 230 were injured.|$|E
5|$|Sharun {{participated in}} {{training}} camp with the Eskimos in 2010 and practiced with the first team as a safety, but {{was moved to the}} practice squad when the team was reduced to 46 players.

He made his CFL debut on July 11, 2010 against the Montreal Alouettes, and later recorded his first special teams tackle on August 6 against the Toronto Argonauts. In a game against the Saskatchewan Roughriders on August 28, Sharun blocked a punt to set up the Eskimos' only touchdown along the way to scoring 17 unanswered points to win 17–14. In his rookie season, Sharun recorded 16 special teams tackles while playing in 15 regular season games, <b>along</b> <b>with</b> <b>one</b> defensive tackle.|$|E
