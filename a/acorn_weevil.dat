5000|$|Curculio glandium is {{a species}} of weevil known as the <b>acorn</b> <b>weevil.</b> Its most {{striking}} feature is its elongated snout, known as a [...] "rostrum", which is longer in females than males. Adults have a brownish and patterned body. The larvae are short, and cylindrical in shape, and move by means of ridges {{on the underside of}} the body. It reaches a length of 4 to 8 mm.|$|E
5000|$|The {{lighting}} of ground fires killed the larvae of acorn moths and <b>acorn</b> <b>weevils</b> by burning them during their dormancy {{period in the}} soil. The pests can infest and consume more than 95% of an oak's acorns.|$|R
50|$|Curculio is a genus of weevils {{belonging}} {{the family}} Curculionidae and subfamily Curculioninae. Members {{of the genus}} are {{commonly referred to as}} <b>acorn</b> <b>weevils</b> or nut weevils as they infest the seeds of trees such as oaks and hickories. The adult female weevil bores a tiny hole in the immature nut to lay her eggs, which then hatch into legless grubs. In the fall, the grubs bore holes through the shells from the inside to emerge into the soil where they may live {{for a year or two}} before maturing into adults.|$|R
50|$|The {{most serious}} defoliating insects that attack Chinkapin oak are the gypsy moth (Lymantria dispar), the orangestriped oakworm (Anisota senatoria), and the {{variable}} oakleaf caterpillar (Heterocampa manteo). Insects that bore into the bole and seriously degrade the products cut from infested trees include the carpenterworm (Prionoyxstus robiniae), little carpenterworm (P. macmurtrei), white oak borer (Goes tigrinus), Columbian timber beetle (Corthylus columbianus), oak timberworm (Arrhenodes minutus), and {{twolined chestnut borer}} (Agrilus bilineatus). The <b>acorn</b> <b>weevils</b> (Curculio spp.), larvae of moths (Valentinia glandulella and Melissopus latiferreanus), and gall forming cynipids (Callirhytis spp.) feed on the acorns.|$|R
40|$|The <b>acorn</b> <b>weevil,</b> Curculio glandium, is a {{widespread}} predator of acorns in eastern North America that overwinters in the soil as a larva. It is possible that low temperatures limit its northern geographic range, so we determined the cold tolerance strategy, seasonal variation in cold tolerance, and explored the physiological plasticity of overwintering larvae. Weevil larvae were collected from acorns of red and bur oak from Pelee Island, southwestern Ontario in fall 2010 and 2011. C. glandium larvae are freeze avoidant and larvae collected from bur oak acorns had lower supercooling points (SCPs: - 7. 6 ± 0. 36 °C, LT 50 : - 7. 2 °C) than those collected from red oak acorns (SCPs: - 6. 1 ± 0. 40 °C, LT 50 : - 6. 1 °C). In the winter of 2010 - 2011, SCPs and water content decreased, however these changes did not occur in 2011 - 2012, when winter soil temperatures fluctuated greatly {{in the absence of}} the buffering effect of snow. To examine whether larvae utilize cryoprotective dehydration, larvae from red oak acorns were exposed to - 5 °C in the presence of ice for seven days. These conditions decreased the SCP without affecting water content, suggesting that SCP and water content are not directly coupled. Finally, long-term acclimation at 0 °C for six weeks slightly increased cold tolerance but also did not affect water content. Thus, although larval diet affects cold tolerance, there is limited plasticity after other treatments. The soil temperatures we observed were not close to lethal limits, although we speculate that soil temperatures in northerly habitats, or in years of reduced snow cover, has the potential to cause mortality in the field...|$|E
40|$|Aim]: Host {{specificity}} within plant-feeding insects {{constitutes a}} fascinating example {{of natural selection}} that promotes inter-specific niche segregation. If specificity is strong, composition of local plant parasitic insect guilds is largely dependent on the presence and prevalence of the preferred hosts. Alternatively, if it is weak or absent, historic and stochastic demographic processes may drive the structuring of insect communities. We assessed whether the species composition of acorn feeding insects (Curculio spp. guilds) and their genetic variation change geographically according to the local host community. [Location]: An 800 km transect across California, USA. [Methods]: We used DNA taxonomy to detect potential Curculio cryptic speciation and assessed intra-specific genetic structure among sampling sites. We monitored larval performance on different hosts, by measuring the weight of each larva upon emerging from the acorn. Our phylogenetic and spatial analyses disentangled host specificity and geographical effects on Curculio community composition and genetic structure. [Results]: DNA taxonomy revealed no specialized cryptic species. Californian Curculio spp. were sister taxa that did not segregate among Quercus species or, at a deeper taxonomic level, between red and white oaks. Curculio species turnover and intra-specific genetic differentiation increased with geographical distance among localities irrespective of local oak species composition. Moreover, larval performance did not differ among oak species or acorn sizes when controlling for {{the effect of the}} locality. [Main conclusions]: Historical processes have contributed to the structuring of <b>acorn</b> <b>weevil</b> communities across California. Trophic niche overlapped among species, indicating that ecologically similar species can co-exist. Acorn crop inter-annual variability and unpredictability in mixed oak forests may have selected against narrow specialization, and facilitated co-existence by means of an inter-specific time partitioning of the resources. Wide-scale geographical records of parasitic insects and their host plants are necessary to understand the processes underlying species diversity.

40|$|The metapopulation {{paradigm}} {{has emerged}} as an important tool to understand the dynamics of species living in fragmented landscapes. In this dissertation, I investigate the unpredictable nature of resource availability for species living in human-dominated heterogeneous and dynamic landscapes {{in the context of}} its consequences for long-term regional persistence of species. In particular, I test theoretical advancements in metapopulation ecology following a two-pronged approach - via experiments in the lab and observations in the field - using insects. In chapter 1, I introduce the concept of metapopulation ecology in the context of its relevance for dynamics of species living in fragmented landscapes and describe my objectives. In chapter 2, I investigate the main and interactive effects of resource availability (constant vs. diminishing), patch connectivity (low vs. high), and dynamics of patch configuration (static vs. dynamic) on landscape and patch level colonization, extinction and abundance of red flour beetles (Tribolium castaneum) as well as metapopulation stability. Patch connectivity and configuration interacted to influence beetle abundance and stability, with intermediate connectivity and patch dynamics leading to greater persistence. In chapter 3, I test predictions of a spatially realistic and temporally dynamic metapopulation model to assess and compare metapopulation capacity and persistence for red flour beetles in experimental landscapes differentiated by resource structure (homogeneous vs. heterogeneous), patch connectivity (high vs. low) and patch dynamics (fast vs. slow), but with the same background destruction rate. Once again, interactive effects predominated. Intermediate patch dynamics and connectivity, coupled with density-dependent emigration promoted persistence in heterogeneous landscapes. In chapter 4, I develop a characterization of northern red oak (Quercus rubra) and white oak (Q. alba) trees as resource patches for two generalist and one specialist species of <b>acorn</b> <b>weevil</b> (Curculio) and employ a Bayesian state space formulation of single-species multi-year dynamic occupancy modeling to examine the effect of niche breadth, forest structure and fragmentation on their patch occupancy and vital rates. The specialist species exhibited greater occupancy than generalists, but its less preferred host tree appeared to serve as a sink that created greater fluctuations in the specialist metapopulation than in those of the generalist species. Thus, generalists occurred on a lower proportion of usable trees but were buffered by access to more suitable patches and greater patch-specific survival. In Chapter 5, I extend the hierarchical modeling framework to develop multi-species multi-year dynamic occupancy models to estimate site-specific occupancy, survival and colonization of nine Curculio species on their primary host tree(s) species, particularly oaks and shagbark hickory (Carya ovata), and examine the effect of spatio-temporal variability in resource availability (mast) on the community level coexistence of these weevils. Local coexistence of weevil species appeared to be promoted by coupling of a spatial storage effect caused by differential host suitability and a temporal storage effect caused by prolonged diapause. Both storage effects were more pronounced for generalists. In chapter 6, I summarize the key findings of my investigation and briefly discuss their broader implications and future directions for research...|$|E

5000|$|The doors close, and the {{announcer}} tells the audience not to buzz, sting, pollinate or chirp during the show. Flik welcomes {{the audience in}} audio animatronic form from the ceiling and tells them to put on their bug eyes (3D glasses). The show begins with butterflies formed as curtains flying away. The title card, a leaf that says [...] "It's tough to be a bug!", appears. Then, jungle music begins to play, and a Mexican redknee tarantula (referred to as a Chilean Tarantula in the show) named Chili makes his appearance, surprising Flik. A pair of <b>acorn</b> <b>weevils,</b> along with Weevil Kneevil, place a slingshot {{on the stage and}} launch acorns from it (which triggers hidden air cannons {{in the back of the}} seats). Chili shoots the first acorn with a quill, but fails to shoot the second due to Weevil holding on to it. Weevil then taunts Chili, who chases after him. The next guest is a soldier termite who defends his mound by spraying intruders with acid. A piece of the set (wood) falls with a rumble and the [...] "Termitnator" [...] steps out. The termite shoots at a taunting flea. Sensing more intruders, the termite shoots at the audience (which triggers hidden water sprayers in the back of the seats), despite Flik's protests, until he runs out of acid and leaves, saying that he will be back. Flik next introduces a stink bug named Claire de Room, who walks onto the stage. The <b>acorn</b> <b>weevils</b> place a flower as a target. Weevil re-enters the scene and crashes into the flower, causing it to move towards the audience.

40|$|Using {{samples from}} eastern China (c. 25 - 41 ° N and 99 - 123 ° E) {{and from a}} common garden experiment, we {{investigate}} how Mg concentration varies with climate across multiple trophic levels. In soils, plant tissue (Oriental oak leaves and acorns), and a specialist <b>acorn</b> predator (the <b>weevil</b> Curculio davidi), Mg concentration increased significantly with different slopes from south to north, and generally decreased with both mean annual temperature (MAT) and precipitation (MAP). In addition, soil, leaf, <b>acorn</b> and <b>weevil</b> Mg showed different strengths of association and sensitivity with climatic factors, suggesting that distinct mechanisms may drive patterns of Mg variation at different trophic levels. Our findings provide {{a first step toward}} determining whether anticipated changes in temperature and precipitation due to climate change will have important consequences for the bioavailability and distribution of Mg in food chain...|$|R
40|$|Oaks (Quercus) are a {{keystone}} species in eastern deciduous forests. One {{of their most}} important functions is the production of hard mast (acorns), a crucial food resource for many wildlife species. Oaks are relatively shade-intolerant and have been maintained as a dominant overstory species in many forests through a cycle of disturbance including fire and land clearing for agriculture. Recently, changing disturbance regimes have resulted in oak regeneration failure. Eventually, oak-dominated stands may instead be dominated by other tree species, such as maple (Acer). This shift may have important negative consequences for other forest species that rely on oak, especially those that consume hard mast. Forest managers have begun to use silviculture (i. e., timber harvest) as an artificial disturbance mechanism {{in an effort to}} promote oak regeneration and maintain oak dominance in deciduous forests, with mixed results. ^ Understanding the effects of timber harvest on wildlife species is an important corollary to these efforts, particularly in the case of wildlife species that themselves affect successful oak regeneration (e. g., small mammals and <b>acorn</b> <b>weevils</b> (Curculio)). In this thesis, I examined the impact of two groups of acorn predators, small mammals and <b>acorn</b> <b>weevils,</b> on the survival of acorns prior to the implementation of timber harvest (Chapter 2). I then studied the effect of several methods of silviculture on common small mammal species, two of which (the white-footed mouse, Peromyscus leucopus, and the eastern chipmunk, Tamius straitus) are consumers of acorns (Chapters 3 - 4). I used two recently developed statistical techniques, an N-mixture model of abundance and a multi-species occupancy model, to make inferences about small mammal responses to harvest. Both models explicitly incorporated variability in detection probability, which if ignored can be a significant source of bias. ^ I found that acorn mortality due to both weevils and removal by small mammals was maximized when mast production was lowest, reflecting the scarcity of this crucial food resource. In years when mast was abundant, small mammal predators preferred to remove more valuable acorns (e. g., acorns that were undamaged). Not surprisingly, abundance of granivorous small mammals were closely linked to mast availability throughout the study. ^ Of the common small mammals that were the focus of the second portion of this thesis, one (the eastern chipmunk) generally responded positively to the creation of openings through timber harvest. A second, the generalist white-footed mouse, generally did not respond strongly to any type of silviculture. In contrast, the short-tailed shrew (Blarina brevicauda) and the pine vole (Microtus pinetorum) generally responded negatively to the creation of openings via harvest. In general, small mammals did not respond strongly to the first stage of a shelterwood harvest. Some of these shifts may have been due to changes in habitat variables following harvest; notably, the eastern chipmunk was associated with areas containing a large amount of coarse woody debris, which increased following the creation of openings. ^ The results of this thesis will be useful in furthering our understanding of how silviculture affects insects and wildlife that play important roles in the oak life cycle. Successful oak regeneration depends on proper implementation of silviculture, but also on ensuring that potential sources of oak mortality, such as small mammals and weevils, do not create a bottleneck in the oak life cycle. My results lay the groundwork for future studies that examine the effects of animals and insects on the entire life cycle of oak in managed forests. ...|$|R
40|$|Host {{specialization}} {{has long}} been hypothesized to explain the extraordinary diversity of phytophagous insects in the tropics. However, addressing this hypothesis has proved challenging {{because of the risk}} of over-looking rare interactions, and hence biasing specialization estimations, and the difficulties to separate the diversity component attributable to insect specialization from that related to host diversity. As a result, the host specialization hypothesis lacks empirical support for important phytophagous insect clades. Here, we test the hypothesis in a radiation of seed-feeding insects, <b>acorn</b> <b>weevils</b> (Curculio spp.), sampled in temperate and tropical regions (California and Nicaragua, respectively) with an equivalent pool of oak host species. Using DNA sequences from three low-copy genes, we delimited to species level 778 weevil larvae extracted from host seeds and assessed their phylogenetic relationships by Maximum Likelihood and Bayesian inference. We then reconstructed the oak-weevil food webs and examined differences in alpha, beta and gamma diversity using Hill numbers of effective species. We found a higher alpha, beta and gamma diversity of weevils in Nicaragua compared to California despite similar richness of host species at both local and regional level. By means of Bayesian mixed models, we also found that tropical weevil species were highly specialized both in terms of host range and interaction strength, whereas their temperate congeners had a broader taxonomic and phylogenetic host spectrum. Finally, in Nicaraguan species, larval body size was highly correlated with the size of the acorns infested, as would be expected by a greater host specialization, whereas in California this relationship was absent. Altogether, these lines of evidence support the host specialization hypothesis and suggest contrasting eco-evolutionary dynamics in tropical and temperate regions even in absence of differences in host diversity...|$|R
40|$|Trophic {{interactions}} {{can trigger}} {{the development of}} exaggerated specialized characters and promote morphological diversification. For example, <b>acorn</b> <b>weevils</b> (genus Curculio) present strikingly long rostrums, which are used by females to perforate oviposition holes through the seed coat. Species exhibiting longer rostrums are known to exploit larger acorns, and therefore rostrum length {{is thought to be}} subject to selection to match the preferred acorn type. However, rostrum length is strongly correlated with body size, and morphological divergence could result from either selection on rostrum length for optimal food exploitation or from other pressures acting on body size. We collected infested acorns at oak forests where the large Curculio elephas and the small-bodied Curculio glandium co-occur. There were no interspecific differences in adult female body size to rostrum length allometric relationships, and rostrum length is equally correlated with body size in either species. MtDNA-based species identification showed that C. glandium larvae were present within acorns of all sizes, whereas C. elephas larvae were restricted to acorns above a minimum size, irrespective of oak species. Hence, exploitation of large acorns can hardly have triggered rostrum enlargement, as the small sized C. glandium adults (with short rostrums) could perforate and oviposit in both small and large acorns. Rather, increased rostrum length is probably a by-product of the larger body sizes of individuals emerging from bigger acorns, which allow increased larval size and enhance larval survival likelihood. Summarizing, when exaggerated feeding traits co-vary with other body features, interspecific morphological variability may result from contrasting selective pressures acting on these correlated characters.

40|$|The {{timing of}} {{reproduction}} {{is predicted to}} match the period of maximum food availability. In this sense, the case of many phytophagous insects in temperate regions is very illustrative, as their larvae usually depend on a resource only available for a limited period of time each year. For 3 years the interactions between the weevil Curculio elephas and the Mediterranean Holm oak Quercus ilex were studied. Weevil larvae grow within the acorns, feeding on the cotyledons. The timing of oviposition will determine food availability for the larvae, as acorns stop growing once they are attacked. Acorn temporal growing patterns did not change between years and food availability for larvae was at its highest in October, when temperature was still suitable for larval development. However, oviposition phenology did change between years. In 2002 females oviposited later, larvae grew within larger acorns, and their body mass {{was significantly higher than}} in 2003 or 2004, when females oviposited into early <b>acorns.</b> Thus, <b>weevils</b> do not always adjust oviposition to the best possible feeding conditions for their offspring. Rather, they seem to maximise their own lifetime fitness, ovipositing as soon as they emerge in late summer. Emergence, in turn, depends strongly on stochastic events such as summer storms in the Mediterranean region. Under a climate change perspective, the trend towards higher August rainfall recorded in our study area may alter oviposition phenology, with the subsequent cascade effects on weevil body size and fitness.

40|$|Recently, a mutualistic {{relationship}} has been described between some dung beetles (Thorectes lusitanicus and Mycotrupes lethroides) and oak species (Quercus suber, Q. canariensis, and Q. rubra), which could be crucial for ensuring seedling recruitment and sustaining the equilibrium of oak populations. For T. lusitanicus, a diet based on acorns during the reproductive period improved resistance to low-temperature conditions and improved ovarian development. In this paper, we conducted field and laboratory experiments to investigate the interaction between two potential acorn-eating beetles, Thorectes baraudi and Jekelius nitidus, with Quercus suber. We determined the feeding preferences of both beetle species and estimated the rates of acorn manipulation by beetles according to habitat structure and several characteristics of the acorn, such as seed size and <b>acorn</b> infestation by <b>weevils.</b> Results demonstrated the positive interaction between the dung beetle Thorectes baraudi and Quercus trees. Thorectes baraudi was clearly more attracted to volatiles of acorns than to dung. Jekelius nitidus, on the contrary, was either not or anecdotally attracted to acorns. On the contrary, {{in the case of}} Jekelius nitidus, the acorn attraction could be considered anecdotal or even accidental. Our field results demonstrated the acorn burying behaviour of T. baraudi in the oak forests of the Cabañeros National Park (Spain), suggesting a potential role of this beetle species as an active secondary acorn disperser. This unexpected behaviour could be particularly important in Mediterranean oak forests and savannahs, where most Quercus species are strongly recruitment limited because of serious overgrazing problems. © 2010 The Authors.

40|$|Weevils are {{the most}} {{important}} pre-dispersal acorn predators in the Mediterranean region, where oaks often form mixed forests and different weevil species can coexist. The performance of weevil larvae depends in great extent on their feeding activities inside the infested acorns that, in turn, are known to reduce the viability of acorns. In this paper, we have analysed the interactions among the weevil community and four oak species (Quercus pyrenaica, Quercus suber, Quercus faginea and Quercus ilex) coexisting in a Mediterranean mixed-oak forest. DNA sequencing of weevil larvae revealed four different weevil species (Curculio elephas, Curculio glandium, Curculio pellitus and Curculio venosus) infesting the acorns of the four oak species. Oak species differed in <b>acorn</b> size, and <b>weevil</b> species also differed in body size. Weevil species showed some degree of specificity among the four oak species, but specificity was not related to variations in acorn size. By contrast, larval development and seedling recruitment were mostly driven by inter-specific differences in larval and acorn size. Larger seeded species suffered less seed damages by weevils (i. e. embryo predation and cotyledon consumption), thus reducing the impacts of acorn infestation in seedling emergence and seedling size. Larval development for the largest weevil species C. elephas was constrained by cotyledon depletion in all acorn species. Yet, this pattern was not observed for other weevil species. Larval size of the same weevil species also varied among different oak species after controlling for the amount of cotyledon eaten by larvae, thus, variation of other acorn traits among acorn species (e. g. chemical composition) may also have consequences for the performance of weevil larvae. It is likely that other variables operating at population level, such as temporal and spatial changes in acorn production or phenological variations of weevils and oaks, are also implicated in the complex functioning of these outstanding mixed-oak forests where natural regeneration seems to be threatened.
