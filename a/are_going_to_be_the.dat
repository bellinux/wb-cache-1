500|$|In November 2002, NCMP Steve Chia {{supported}} a motion by the Minister for Education stating that [...] "this House ... (1) supports the new JC [...] curriculum which will better develop thinking, communication and other process skills and {{engage students in}} greater breadth of learning; and (2) endorses greater diversity and opening of new pathways in JC/Upper Secondary education to cater to the different strengths and interests of students." [...] He suggested {{that there should be}} a focus on [...] "creative spontaneity", expressing the view that the education system in 2002 was one that focused on churning out a production line of workers, managers and instruction takers. Given that Singapore had reached the standards of a First World economy, Singapore should focus on instilling an inquisitive spirit within students, to encourage students to ask questions. He placed most emphasis on the importance of ensuring that the focus of education should be character building, stating: [...] "It will be failure of our education system if we are to train our best and brightest with our best resources only to be told that they <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> quitters of our society; or that they lack the compassion for the weak and the down; or that they behave in a snobbish class of their own; or behave condescendingly to their peers and followers; or that the elites only care about their own self-interests." ...|$|E
500|$|By October 2013, Marvel was {{preparing}} four drama series and a miniseries, totaling 60 episodes, {{to present to}} video on demand services and cable providers, with Netflix, Amazon, and WGN America expressing interest. In November 2013, {{it was announced that}} Disney would provide Netflix with live-action series based on Daredevil, Jessica Jones, Iron Fist, and Luke Cage, leading up to a miniseries based on the Defenders. Disney CEO Bob Iger stated that Netflix was chosen to air the shows, [...] "when Disney realized it could use the streaming service as a way to grow the popularity of the characters". He added that, if the characters prove popular, they could become feature films. Loeb later stated that Marvel was not [...] "interested in making four pilots and then hoping someday that they could all get together. Netflix really understood what it is we wanted to do. They're very open to directors that might not have that same opportunity in broadcast television. The notion of having all 13 episodes at one time, particularly in serialized storytelling, is very appealing." [...] Loeb also added that the four characters chosen [...] "all had a previous existing relationship and all grew up on the same kind of stoop in New York [...] So it lent itself to a world. Does that mean these shows <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> same? No. They can't be. The characters have different issues, different problems, different feelings about them ... the example that I continually give is that I cannot think of two films that are more different in tone than [...] and Guardians of the Galaxy. And yet, if you watch them back to back, they feel very Marvel. They feel very much like, 'Oh, it is still the same universe that I'm in.'" ...|$|E

The evidence {{is that most of the}} time these riders are dealing with individuals from outside their team and the sport whether it be pseudo doctors and chemists who are promising them things. That has got to stop. More and more riders...are speaking out and it's the younger generation of riders coming in that <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> future of the sport. They have to come into a system that is completely ethically correct. But at the end of the day, the rider is the one who makes the decisions..We are in the process of changing that culture and it will change in time. We need to weed out the bad apples. I hope next year we have a Tour de France with no positive tests. We've had two bad Tour de Frances, we cannot afford a third." ...|$|E

2500|$|Like SN2 {{reaction}}s, {{there are}} quite a few factors that affect the reaction rate of SN1 reactions. [...] Instead of having two concentrations that affect the reaction rate, there is only one, substrate. [...] The rate equation for this would be Rate=k. [...] Since the rate of a reaction is only determined by its slowest step, the rate at which the leaving group [...] "leaves" [...] determines the speed of the reaction. [...] This means that the better the leaving group, the faster the reaction rate. [...] A general rule for what makes a good leaving group is the weaker the conjugate base, the better the leaving group. [...] In this case, halogens <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> best leaving groups, while compounds such as amines, hydrogen, and alkanes are going to be quite poor leaving groups. [...] As SN2 reactions were affected by sterics, SN1 reactions are determined by bulky groups attached to the carbocation. [...] Since there is an intermediate that actually contains a positive charge, bulky groups attached are going to help stabilize the charge on the carbocation through resonance and distribution of charge. [...] In this case, tertiary carbocation will react faster than a secondary which will react much faster than a primary. [...] It is also due to this carbocation intermediate that the product does not have to have inversion. [...] The nucleophile can attack from the top or the bottom and therefore create a racemic product. [...] It is important to use a protic solvent, water and alcohols, since an aprotic solvent could attack the intermediate and cause unwanted product. [...] It does not matter if the hydrogens from the protic solvent react with the nucleophile since the nucleophile is not involved in the rate determining step.|$|E
