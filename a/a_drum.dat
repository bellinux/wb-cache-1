The next layers to be recorded were the guitar, bass and vocals, with other sounds being added later.|$|E

5|$|After {{the breakup}} of his gothic rock band the Marked, singer and guitarist Billy Corgan left St. Petersburg, Florida, {{to return to his}} native city of Chicago, where he took a job in a record store and formed the idea of a new band to be called the Smashing Pumpkins.

Adorning {{themselves}} with paisley and other psychedelic trappings, the two began writing songs together (with the aid of <b>a</b> <b>drum</b> machine) that were heavily influenced by The Cure and New Order. The duo performed live {{for the first time on}} July 9, 1988 at the Polish bar Chicago 21. This performance included only Corgan on bass and Iha on guitar with <b>a</b> <b>drum</b> machine.
