This dissertation analyses the way in which aggression is attributed to the <b>aggressor</b> <b>State</b> and the individual, and how State and individual responsibility is delineated from each other, with a particular focus on the legal interest of the aggressed State. First, the argument considers the way in which international law prohibits and criminalizes aggression, elaborating international obligations of States and individuals in that regard (Part I). It then analyses the interconnection between obligations of States to refrain from an act of aggression and obligations of individuals to refrain from conduct relating to the crime of aggression (Part II).

This thesis examines hybrid warfare applications using contemporary and historical examples. The analysis seeks to determine why a country was or was not successful in its execution of hybrid war, and it assesses the geo-political context of cost, benefit, and risk for an <b>aggressor</b> <b>state</b> contributing to {{its decision to}} engage in hybrid warfare. The case studies selected include the 1923 German Communist Revolution, Germany’s 1938 annexation of Austria, the 2008 Russia-Georgia War, and the ongoing conflict in Ukraine. In each case study, a state went on the offensive, deliberately choosing hybrid tactics to obtain an objective. Ultimately, the thesis objective strives to deepen our understanding of hybrid war, and to extrapolate how one seemingly minor hybrid event can be tied into a broader goal of an <b>aggressor</b> <b>state</b> in its interactions with a defender state.

Additionally, Britain and France sought to court Italy's {{government as a}} potential deterrent to Hitler, given that Mussolini was not yet in {{what would become the}} Axis alliance of World War II. Thus, neither enforced any serious sanctions against the Italian government. Additionally, in this case and with the Japanese invasion of Manchuria, the absence of the USA from the League of Nations deprived the LN of another major power that could have used economic leverage against either of the <b>aggressor</b> <b>states.</b> Inaction by the League subjected it to criticisms that it was weak and concerned more with European issues (most leading members were European), and did not deter Hitler from his plans to dominate Europe.

40|$|From {{the early}} 1980 s feminist theory has made steady inroads into IR theory. The {{standard}} view, both amongst IR feminists and other scholars in IR, is {{that prior to}} this there was little or no feminist theory in IR. Yet, there was a distinct feminist IR prior to the 1940 s that had its own particular take {{on the problems of}} global order. This paper seeks to reassess the ideas and impact of IR’s first-wave feminism by concentrating on the works of one particular writer, H. M. Swanwick. Certainly, Swanwick was not the only feminist writing on international affairs in the period. She is interesting, however, both because of her earlier involvement in the feminist and suffragette movements, and because she constructed a clear analysis of the problems of security in IR. Her criticisms of collective security put her at odds with many of her left-wing colleagues, who supported military sanctions by the League. While she gave very sound reasons for rejecting so-called ‘League wars’ against <b>aggressor</b> <b>states,</b> her position in the late 1930 s brought her closer to the appeasement policy of the Chamberlain government. Yet, despite this, her criticisms of both collective security and the old pre- 1914 international anarchy are an interesting corrective to both the realist paradigm that emerged after the 1940 s and the liberal-socialist paradigm that supported a tighter League system in the 1920 s and early 1930 s. It is also an indication {{of the extent to which}} a liberal feminist agenda had been part of mainstream IR prior to the realist ascendancy...|$|R

40|$|Delegates {{recently}} {{convened in}} Kampala, Uganda {{to lay the}} groundwork for the International Criminal Court’s eventual prosecution of the crime of aggression. This achievement caps decades of negotiations that began in the post-World War II period. From virtually the beginning of the negotiations, it was argued that an aggression prosecution should not go forward absent some definitive showing that a state had committed a predicate act of aggression. Delegations diverged on which body — the Security Council or the court itself — should be empowered to determine whether a predicate act of aggression had occurred and whether it was necessary for the putative <b>aggressor</b> <b>state(s),</b> the victim state(s), or both, to have consented to the court’s jurisdiction before a prosecution could proceed. The end product was an unimpeachable regime of state consent that completely insulates the nationals of non-party states from prosecution and allows States Parties to opt out of the crime entirely. The results achieved in Kampala have subtly eroded the primacy of the Security Council, as states revealed a preference for a consent-based regime and a willingness to extend international criminal jurisdiction to their own nationals and over their own foreign policies. Indeed, the aggression amendments may have actually diminished the efficacy of the Council’s pre-existing referral power and created the potential for greater conflict between the Council and the court. The outcome in Kampala thus presents a microcosm of the continual thinning of state sovereignty and the indelible shift in the balance between power and law in international relations. This Article examines the aggression amendments and the process by which they were adopted, concluding with a discussion of the way in which the negotiations and the final amendments invoked and rebalanced the central themes of power politics, state consent and judicial independence within public international law...|$|R

Nowadays, the old Latin phrase “jus ad bellum”**, in whose name states have frequently engaged in warfare, has been abolished. As a result, the UN Charter has established a complex system for the sanctioning of the <b>aggressor</b> <b>state,</b> designed to ensure and restore the international rule of law by {{putting an end to}} acts of violence and minimizing their consequences. Self-defense is a right the states may exercise under well-established conditions and limitations only. With respect to nations that are dominated by foreign states and are therefore seeking to gain their independence and exercise their legitimate rights by all means, including by war, it has been established that the use of armed force by the dominator-states is an act of aggression forbidden by the international rule of law. The non-aggression principle is basically the one that has turned international law from a law of war into a law of peace, to the point where war is considered today as the most serious international crime...|$|E
40|$|Hierarchical or {{asymmetrical}} power {{relationships among}} states {{have long been}} a focus of scholarly attention (e. g., asymmetrical alliances, trade dependencies). While the 2 ̆ 2 power to hurt 2 ̆ 2 is one expression of power, an alternative approach is to gain and exercise authority, or 2 ̆ 2 rightful rule. 2 ̆ 2 One of the major impediments {{to the study of}} social concepts such as authority or legitimacy, however, is in their informal or intangible nature. This dissertation uses game theoretic and latent variable approaches to capture informal, social authority relationships, or social hierarchies, among international states and explores the effects of these hierarchies on security and economic behavior. I posit that states adopt one of two social roles [...] that of a dominant or a subordinate. Each subordinate chooses a degree of autonomy that it is willing to cede to the dominant in exchange for a corresponding degree of protection. Ranging from complete autonomy to complete control, these dyadic bargains make up a social international hierarchy. This hierarchy affects the relationships between each subordinate and the dominant, as well as the relationships among subordinates. In the security realm, the probability of conflict initiation is inversely related to the degree of subordination. When conflict does occur, dominants are more likely to intervene when the target is located at a higher position in the dominant 2 ̆ 7 s social hierarchy than the <b>aggressor</b> <b>state.</b> Economically, the probability that a state enacts illiberal policies is inversely related to its degree of subordination. Moreover, more subordinated states face a lower risk of economic sanction than states located lower in the hierarchy, even for similar illiberal actions. Empirical analysis of states within the US hierarchy (1950 - 2000) and UK hierarchy (1870 - 1913) using strategic probit models supports these theoretical predictions...|$|E

And so, if we deal with <b>aggressors</b> via the <b>state,</b> we turn into partial aggressors ourselves, it seems.
