2500|$|The {{music of}} gothic metal is {{generally}} characterised by its dark atmospheres. The adjective [...] "dark" [...] {{is commonly used}} to describe gothic music in general while other terms that are less frequently used include deep, romantic, passionate and intense. Gothic metal has also sometimes been viewed as [...] "a combination of the darkness and melancholy of goth rock with heavy metal". Allmusic defines the genre as a fusion of [...] "the bleak, icy atmospherics of goth rock with the loud guitars and aggression of heavy metal" [...] and further notes that [...] "true goth metal is always directly influenced by goth rock— ethereal synths and spooky textures <b>are</b> <b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>important</b> as guitar riffs, if not more so".|$|E

However, he criticizes Tismăneanu for his [...] "not strictly correct" [...] conclusion that intellectual former dissidents can be credited with bringing down communism and reforming their countries, replying that the [...] "rough-hewn politicians" [...] Lech Wałęsa and Boris Yeltsin, and the Bulgarian [...] "pragmatic liberal centrist" [...] Ivan Kostov, <b>are</b> <b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>important</b> actors. A similar point is made by Cas Mudde, who contends that Tismăneanu's words display [...] "passionate and uncritical support for the dissidents", adding: [...] "For someone so worried about populism, it is remarkable that he does not see the clearly populist elements of the dissidents' 'anti-politics', which he so often praises." [...] Political scientist Steven Saxonberg reserves praise for the manner in which Fantasies of Salvation is written, but objects to Tismăneanu's preference for market liberalism at the expense of any form of collectivism, and claims that his focus on new antisemitic trends overlooks the revival of antiziganism. Researchers comment favorably Tismăneanu's rejection of cultural determinism in discussing the Eastern Bloc countries' relation to the Western world and to each other.|$|E

[...] Louise Melling, ACLU deputy legal director, said religious freedom [...] "gives us all the right to hold our beliefs, but it doesn't give {{you the right to}} impose your beliefs on others, to discriminate against others." [...] The editorial board of The New York Times wrote that the decision [...] "swept aside accepted principles of corporate law and religious liberty to grant owners of closely held, for-profit companies an unprecedented right to impose their religious views on employees." [...] A Fox News columnist wrote, [...] "..., with all of the debate about the religious beliefs of the Hobby Lobby owners, what about the religious beliefs of their employees? They <b>are</b> <b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>important,</b> and should not be trampled upon." [...] The director of the United Church of Christ's Washington, D.C. office, {{said that the}} ruling [...] "may embolden private employers to claim religious objections to particular health care services, in effect forcing their own religious views upon their employees." [...] Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said, [...] "It's the first time that our court has said that a closely held corporation has the rights of a person when it comes to religious freedom, which means that the ... corporation's employers can impose their religious beliefs on their employees." [...] The Center for American Progress said that the ruling [...] "moves in the direction this court has been moving already, which is talking about corporate personhood—really treating corporations like people, saying that the corporation has a religion itself and that should be imposed on its employees." [...] Interfaith Alliance leader Rev. Welton Gaddy said, [...] "The First Amendment is at its best when it is used {{to protect the rights of}} minorities from the whims of the powerful. Today's decision, which gives the powerful the right to force their religious beliefs on those around them, is a far cry from the best traditions of religious freedom." ...|$|E

6000|$|Docility may {{survive as}} a lazy habit long after it has {{ceased to be a}} {{beneficial}} instinct. If you catch a child when it is young enough to be instinctively docile, and keep it in a condition of unremitted tutelage under the nurserymaid, the governess, the preparatory school, the secondary school, and the university, until it is an adult, you will produce, not a self-reliant, free, fully matured human being, but a grown-up schoolboy or schoolgirl, capable of nothing in the way of original or independent action except outbursts of naughtiness in the women and blackguardism in the men. That is exactly what we get at present in our rich and consequently governing classes: they pass from juvenility to senility without ever touching maturity except in body. The classes which cannot afford this sustained tutelage are notably more self-reliant and grown-up: an office boy of fifteen is often more of a man than a university student of twenty. Unfortunately this precocity is disabled by poverty, ignorance, narrowness, and a hideous power of living without art or love or beauty and being rather proud of it. The poor never escape from servitude: their docility is preserved by their slavery. And so all become the prey of the greedy, the selfish, the domineering, the unscrupulous, the predatory. If here and there an individual refuses to be docile, ten docile persons will beat him or lock him up or shoot him or hang him at the bidding of his oppressors and their own. The crux of the whole difficulty about parents, schoolmasters, priests, absolute monarchs, and despots of every sort, is the tendency to abuse natural docility. A nation should always be healthily rebellious; but the king or prime minister has yet to be found who will make trouble by cultivating that side of the national spirit. A child should begin to assert itself early, and shift for itself more and more not only in washing and dressing itself, but in opinions and conduct; yet as nothing is so exasperating and so unlovable as an uppish child, it is useless to expect parents and schoolmasters to inculcate this uppishness. Such unamiable precepts as Always contradict an authoritative statement, Always return a blow, Never lose a chance of a good fight, When you are scolded for a mistake ask the person who scolds you whether he or she supposes you did it on purpose, and follow the question with a blow or an insult or some other unmistakable expression of resentment, Remember that the progress of the world depends on your knowing better than your elders, <b>are</b> <b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>important</b> as those of The Sermon on the Mount; but no one has yet seen them written up in letters of gold in a schoolroom or nursery. The child is taught to be kind, to be respectful, to be quiet, not to answer back, to be truthful when its elders want to find out anything from it, to lie when the truth would shock or hurt its elders, to be above all things obedient, and to be seen and not heard. Here we have two sets of precepts, each warranted to spoil a child hopelessly if the other be omitted. Unfortunately we do not allow fair play between them. The rebellious, intractable, aggressive, selfish set provoke a corrective resistance, and do not pretend to high moral or religious sanctions; and they are never urged by grown-up people on young people. They are therefore more in danger of neglect or suppression than the other set, which have all the adults, all the laws, all the religions on their side. How is the child to be secured its due share of both bodies of doctrine? ...|$|E
