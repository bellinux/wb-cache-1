The 1-Click Maintenance section runs multiple routine maintenance tools at once. The Performance Optimizer <b>and</b> <b>Fix</b> Problems utilities {{are intended to}} provide tips to identify <b>and</b> <b>fix</b> potential problems and increase performance, such as disabling unnecessary visual effects and disabling or removing unused Windows services and programs. Live Optimization, according to the application's author, is intended to improve the responsiveness of Windows applications by tweaking their execution priorities.|$|E

While the mall wasn't heavily damaged and only affected the mall's cosmetic appearance, several nearby local businesses and residences were left in ruins following the impact. Shortly after the tornado, a large renovation occurred to update the mall's appearance <b>and</b> <b>fix</b> any damage left by it. In 1988, another expansion took place, allowing Har Mar to acquire several larger retailers in the newly constructed space; the opening of Highland Superstore and TJ Maxx appeared later this year, along {{with the addition of}} a new food court with seating for over 400 people. Three years later, the Highland Superstore was converted to BizMart, a regional office supply store. BizMart was later acquired by OfficeMax in 1992 before ultimately closing in 1995; HomePlace opened in the space vacated by OfficeMax, and is currently leased by HomeGoods, the successor of HomePlace. In the 2000s, Har Mar underwent a cosmetic makeover that cost previous owner Emmes Realty Services nearly $12 million; Emmes sparked interest in opening a Von Maur at the center, but the proposal eventually dissolved.|$|E
5|$|Team member Lucas Davis {{compiled}} {{the development}} tools and documentation for Anachronox and released them in August 2001. Four bug-fixing patches exist for Anachronox. Ion Storm {{created the first}} (1.01), which fixed the Windows 2000 buffer overrun crash and implemented other improvements such as taxi-cabs between distant points and enhanced save game functionality. Ion Storm released the first patch (1.01) on July 2, 2001. Joey Liaw set up a GeoCities website for reporting bugs and technical information after the game's release, and worked on a new patch in his spare time. The second patch (1.02, or build 44) was released in May 2003 and overhauls the save-game system and provides other important stability fixes. The third and fourth patches—1.02 (build 45), released September 2003, and 1.02 (build 46), released April 2004—are fan-made unofficial patches <b>and</b> <b>fix</b> {{most of the remaining}} bugs. Fans have translated the game into German and released a conversion patch. Level designer Rich Carlson released a scrapped secret level for Anachronox in February 2004 after finding it on an old floppy disk.|$|E

Dwight calls Jim's bluff and rents an overcrowded bus for the staff to work on, but Jim harnesses the office workers' love of a local pie stand to please Pam. Dwight eventually gets angry and climbs into the roof of the bus, refusing to drive any further. Pam suspects something else is wrong and asks Jim to talk to him. Jim learns that Dwight thought his magnetic power prank was real as he suspects he is infertile, which he has convinced himself explains why he was not the father of Angela Martin's (Angela Kinsey) baby. Jim tells Dwight he is like a father to the entire office, and Dwight then drives everyone to the pie stand where they have a great finish to their day.|$|E

Assuming it is the ailing Chief Justice Roy Ashland that has passed, Josh is surprised to learn that it is 52-year old Justice Owen Brady, taken by a heart attack.

30|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to study the extra-gradient methods for solving split {{feasibility}} <b>and</b> <b>fixed</b> point problems involved in pseudo-contractive mappings in real Hilbert spaces. We propose an Ishikawa-type extra-gradient iterative algorithm for finding a solution of the split feasibility <b>and</b> <b>fixed</b> point problems involved in pseudo-contractive mappings with Lipschitz assumption. Moreover, we also suggest a Mann-type extra-gradient iterative algorithm for finding a solution of the split feasibility <b>and</b> <b>fixed</b> point problems involved in pseudo-contractive mappings without Lipschitz assumption. It is proven that under suitable conditions, the sequences generated by the proposed iterative algorithms converge weakly to a solution of the split feasibility <b>and</b> <b>fixed</b> point problems. The results presented in this paper extend and improve some corresponding ones in the literature.|$|R
