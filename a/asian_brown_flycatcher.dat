50|$|Many {{rare species}} of bird {{have been found}} on the island, and it is {{probably}} the best place in western Europe to see skulking Siberian passerines such as Pechora pipit, lanceolated warbler and Pallas's grasshopper warbler. In spring 2008 a calandra lark was identified in April, and in May a Caspian plover was observed, only the fourth such record for the UK. On 6 June a citril finch was found and identified by islander Tommy Hyndman, a first record for Britain. September was highlighted by <b>brown</b> <b>flycatcher,</b> red-flanked bluetail and Siberian thrush.|$|R

5000|$|On 3 October 2007 a first winter <b>brown</b> <b>flycatcher</b> was {{discovered}} at Flamborough Head, East Riding of Yorkshire which attracted hundreds of birdwatchers during its stay which lasted until dusk {{of the following}} day.

50|$|The <b>Asian</b> <b>brown</b> <b>flycatcher</b> (Muscicapa dauurica) {{is a small}} {{passerine}} bird in the flycatcher family Muscicapidae. The word Muscicapa {{comes from}} the Latin musca, a fly and capere, to catch. The specific dauurica refers to Dauria, an area of south-eastern Siberia named after a local nomadic tribe.|$|E
50|$|The {{region has}} given {{its name to}} various animal species {{including}} Daurian hedgehog, and the following birds: <b>Asian</b> <b>brown</b> <b>flycatcher</b> (Muscicapa daurica), Daurian jackdaw, Daurian partridge, Daurian redstart, Daurian starling, Daurian shrike and the red-rumped swallow (Hirundo daurica). The Mongolian wild ass (Equus hemionus hemionus) is regionally extinct from the region.|$|E
5000|$|Retreat of the Hindu Kush-Himalayan glaciers {{and snow}} packs. The cause is {{attributed}} to rising air temperatures that are more pronounced in elevated regions, a combined warming effect of greenhouse gases and the <b>Asian</b> <b>Brown</b> Cloud. Also deposition of black carbon decreases the reflection and exacerbates the retreat. Asian glacial melting could lead to water shortages and floods {{for the hundreds of}} millions of people who live downstream.|$|R
25|$|Like {{the other}} {{sections}} of Disney's Animal Kingdom, there are animals on display. The animals, {{such as the}} American crocodile, red legged seriemas, Abdim's stork and <b>Asian</b> <b>brown</b> tortoise, have evolutionary links {{to the age of}} the dinosaurs. They are animal species that have survived since the dinosaur era and can be found along the Cretaceous Trail along with a collection of Mesozoic plants. The area was sponsored by McDonald's until 2009.|$|R
50|$|The Indian Ocean <b>brown</b> cloud or <b>Asian</b> <b>brown</b> cloud is a {{layer of}} air {{pollution}} that recurrently covers parts of South Asia, namely the northern Indian Ocean, India, and Pakistan. Viewed from satellite photos, the cloud appears as a giant brown stain {{hanging in the air}} over much of South Asia and the Indian Ocean every year between January and March, possibly also during earlier and later months. The term was coined in reports from the UNEP Indian Ocean Experiment (INDOEX).|$|R
50|$|It is 13 to 14 cm long. The upperparts are {{plain and}} dark grey-brown {{apart from a}} pale wingbar and pale edging to the tertial feathers. The breast and flanks have a {{variable}} amount of streaky dark grey-brown. This is unlike the similar <b>Asian</b> <b>brown</b> <b>flycatcher</b> which has rather plain pale underparts and the grey-streaked flycatcher which is white below with distinct grey streaks.|$|E
50|$|Dark-sided flycatchers have a pale submoustachial stripe {{and a dark}} {{malar stripe}} which {{outlines}} the white throat and half-collar. The centre of the lower breast and belly is white while the undertail-coverts are white with dark centres to the feathers. The bill is short and dark and the feet are black. The eye is large and has a whitish ring around it. The wings are long with a longer primary projection than the <b>Asian</b> <b>brown</b> <b>flycatcher.</b>|$|E
50|$|Avifauna of {{the reserve}} {{exhibits}} {{a high degree of}} variety and endemicity. Some of the noteworthy species include mountain hawk-eagle, Sri Lanka junglefowl, Sri Lanka wood pigeon, jungle nightjar, Sri Lanka blue magpie, yellow-eared bulbul, brown-capped babbler, orange-billed babbler, dull-blue flycatcher, Sri Lanka bush warbler, Sri Lanka whistling thrush, spot-winged thrush, common blackbird, and Sri Lanka white-eye. All five species of bird which are strictly endemic to this ecoregion are present in the reserve. Common birds are scarlet minivet, small minivet, black bulbul, Sri Lanka scimitar babbler, grey-headed canary-flycatcher, pied bushchat, and Sri Lanka scaly thrush. Indian pitta, <b>Asian</b> <b>brown</b> <b>flycatcher,</b> Kashmir flycatcher, Indian blue robin, pied thrush, black-throated munia, and large-billed leaf warbler are amongst the large number of migratory species.|$|E

50|$|Another {{major impact}} {{is on the}} polar ice caps. Black carbon (soot) in the <b>Asian</b> <b>Brown</b> Cloud may be {{reflecting}} sunlight and dimming Earth below but it is warming other places by absorbing incoming radiation and warming the atmosphere and whatever it touches. Black carbon is three times more effective than carbon dioxide—the most common greenhouse gas—at melting polar ice and snow. Black carbon in snow causes about three times the temperature change as {{carbon dioxide in the}} atmosphere. On snow—even at concentrations below five parts per billion-dark carbon triggers melting, and may be responsible for as much as 94 percent of Arctic warming.|$|R
