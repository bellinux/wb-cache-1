5|$|Edward's {{coronation}} {{had originally}} been scheduled for 26 June 1902. However, two days before, on 24 June, {{he was diagnosed with}} appendicitis. Appendicitis was generally not treated operatively and carried a high mortality rate, but developments in anaesthesia and <b>antisepsis</b> in the preceding 50 years made life-saving surgery possible. Sir Frederick Treves, with the support of Lord Lister, performed a then-radical operation of draining a pint of pus from the infected abscess through a small incision (through -inch thickness of belly fat and abdomen wall); this outcome showed thankfully that the cause was not cancer. The next day, Edward was sitting up in bed, smoking a cigar. Two weeks later, it was announced that the King was out of danger. Treves was honoured with a baronetcy (which Edward had arranged before the operation) and appendix surgery entered the medical mainstream. Edward was crowned at Westminster Abbey on 9 August 1902 by the 80-year-old Archbishop of Canterbury, Frederick Temple, who died only four months later.|$|E

25|$|Two major {{advances}} {{occurred in}} the late 19th century, which together allowed the transition to modern surgery. An appreciation of the germ theory of disease led rapidly to the development and application of antiseptic techniques in surgery. <b>Antisepsis,</b> which soon gave way to asepsis, reduced the overall morbidity and mortality of surgery to a far more acceptable rate than in previous eras. Concurrent with these developments were the significant advances in pharmacology and physiology {{which led to the}} development of general anesthesia and the control of pain.|$|E
25|$|In both {{modern society}} and medieval Islamic society, {{anesthesia}} and <b>antisepsis</b> are {{important aspects of}} surgery. Before the development of anesthesia and <b>antisepsis,</b> surgery was limited to fractures, dislocations, traumatic injuries resulting in amputation, and urinary disorders or other common infections. Ancient Islamic physicians attempted to prevent infection when performing procedures for a sick patient, for example by washing a patient before a procedure; similarly, following a procedure, the area was often cleaned with “wine, wined mixed with oil of roses, oil of roses alone, salt water, or vinegar water”, which have antiseptic properties. Various herbs and resins including frankincense, myrrh, cassia, {{and members of the}} laurel family were also used to prevent infections, although {{it is impossible to know}} exactly how effective these treatments were in the prevention of sepsis. The pain-killing uses of opium had been known since ancient times; other drugs including “henbane, hemlock, soporific black nightshade, lettuce seeds” were also used by Islamic physicians to treat pain. Some of these drugs, especially opium, were known to cause drowsiness, and some modern scholars have argued that these drugs were used to cause a person to lose consciousness before an operation, as a modern-day anesthetic would. However, there is no clear reference to such a use before the 16th century.|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} {{empirical}} days of vaccination, before Pasteur's work on establishing the germ theory and Lister's on <b>antisepsis</b> and asepsis, {{there was considerable}} cross-infection. William Woodville, {{one of the early}} vaccinators and director of the London Smallpox Hospital is thought to have contaminated the cowpox matter—the vaccine—with smallpox matter and this essentially produced variolation. Other vaccine material was not reliably derived from cowpox, but from other skin eruptions of cattle. In modern times, an effective scientific model and controlled production were important in reducing these causes of apparent failure or iatrogenic illness.|$|E
25|$|Macewen {{was born}} near Port Bannatyne, Isle of Bute, Scotland in 1848 and {{studied at the}} University of Glasgow, {{receiving}} a medical degree in 1872. He was greatly influenced by Joseph, Lord Lister (1827–1912), who revolutionised surgery by developing <b>antisepsis,</b> {{by the use of}} phenol, thus decreasing drastically the enormous mortality of surgical patients due to infections. By following Lister and adopting systematically the use of scrubbing (deep cleansing and disinfection of hands and arms), sterilisation of surgical tools, use of surgical gowns, and (recently discovered) anaesthesia, Macewen {{became one of the most}} innovative surgeons of his time and was able to greatly advance modern surgical technique and improve the recovery of patients.|$|E
25|$|In 1847, Hungarian {{physician}} Ignác Fülöp Semmelweis dramatically {{reduced the}} occurrency of puerperal fever by simply requiring physicians {{to wash their}} hands before attending to women in childbirth. This discovery predated the germ theory of disease. However, Semmelweis' findings were not appreciated by his contemporaries and came into use only with discoveries by British surgeon Joseph Lister, who in 1865 proved the principles of <b>antisepsis.</b> Lister's work {{was based on the}} important findings by French biologist Louis Pasteur. Pasteur was able to link microorganisms with disease, revolutionizing medicine. He also devised {{one of the most important}} methods in preventive medicine, when in 1880 he produced a vaccine against rabies. Pasteur invented the process of pasteurization, to help prevent the spread of disease through milk and other foods.|$|E
25|$|Lister {{continued}} to develop improved methods of <b>antisepsis</b> and asepsis when he realised that infection {{could be better}} avoided by preventing bacteria from getting into wounds in the first place. This led {{to the rise of}} sterile surgery. Lister instructed surgeons under his responsibility to wear clean gloves and wash their hands in 5% carbolic solution before and after operations, and had surgical instruments washed in the same solution. He also introduced the steam steriliser to sterilize equipment. His discoveries paved the way for a dramatic expansion to the capabilities of the surgeon; for his contributions he is often regarded as the father of modern surgery. These three crucial advances - the adoption of a scientific methodology toward surgical operations, the use of anaesthetic and the introduction of sterilised equipment - laid the groundwork for the modern invasive surgical techniques of today.|$|E
500|$|Elemental {{chlorine}} solutions {{dissolved in}} chemically basic water (sodium and calcium hypochlorite) were first used as anti-putrefaction agents and disinfectants in the 1820s, in France, {{long before the}} establishment of the germ theory of disease. This practice was pioneered by Antoine-Germain Labarraque, who adapted Berthollet's [...] "Javel water" [...] bleach and other chlorine preparations (for a more complete history, see below). Elemental chlorine has since served a continuous function in topical <b>antisepsis</b> (wound irrigation solutions and the like) and public sanitation, particularly in swimming and drinking water.|$|E
500|$|Although Joseph Lister's {{pioneering}} work in <b>antisepsis</b> {{was known to}} American doctors, with Lister himself having visited America in 1876, few of them had confidence in it, and none of his advocates were among Garfield's treating physicians. The physician who took charge at the depot {{and then at the}} White House was Doctor Willard Bliss. A noted physician and surgeon, Bliss was an old friend of Garfield, and about a dozen doctors, led by Bliss, were soon probing the wound with unsterilized fingers and instruments. [...] Garfield was given morphine for the pain, and asked Bliss to frankly tell him his chances, which Bliss put at one in a hundred. [...] "Well, Doctor, we'll take that chance." ...|$|E
500|$|Records of PTE exist from {{as early}} as 3000 BC. [...] Trepanation, in which a hole is cut in the skull, {{may have been used}} to treat PTE in ancient cultures. [...] In the early 19thcentury, the {{surgeons}} Baron Larrey and WC Wells each reported having performed the operation for PTE. [...] The French-educated American surgeon Benjamin Winslow Dudley (1785–1870) performed six trepanations for PTE between the years of 1819 and 1832 in Kentucky and had good results despite the unavailability of <b>antisepsis.</b> The surgery involved opening the skull at the site of injury, debriding injured tissue, and sometimes draining blood or fluid from under the dura mater. [...] Dudley's work was the largest series of its kind that had been done up to that point, and it encouraged other surgeons to use trepanation for post-traumatic seizures. [...] His reports on the operations came before it was accepted that surgery to relieve excess pressure within the skull was effective in treating epilepsy, but it helped set the stage for trepanation for PTE to become common practice. [...] The procedure became more accepted in the late 19thcentury once <b>antisepsis</b> was available and cerebral localization was a familiar concept. [...] However, in 1890, the prominent German physician Ernest von Bergmann criticized the procedure; he questioned its efficacy (except in particular circumstances) and suggested that operations had been declared successful too soon after the procedures to know whether they would confer a long-term benefit. [...] The late 19thcentury saw the advent of intracranial surgery, operating on brain lesions believed to be causing seizures, a step beyond cranial surgery which involved just the skull and meninges. [...] By 1893, at least 42 intracranial operations had been performed for PTE in the US, with limited success.|$|E
2500|$|Aluminum {{potassium}} sulfate, {{also known}} as potash alum, [...] is used as an astringent and <b>antisepsis</b> in various food preparation processes such as pickling and fermentation and as a flocculant for water purification, among other things. A common method of producing potash alum is leaching of alumina from bauxite, which is then reacted with potassium sulfate. As a naturally occurring mineral, potassium alum is known as alum-(K). Other potassium aluminium sulfate minerals are alunite (...) and kalinite (...) [...] It is also used in so-called [...] "crystal" [...] deodorants.|$|E

2500|$|H.L. Mencken {{considered}} Halsted {{the greatest}} physician {{of the whole}} Johns Hopkins group, and Mencken’s praise of his achievements when he reviewed Dr. MacCallum's 1930 biography is a memorable tribute. “His contributions to surgery were numerous and various. He introduced the use of local anesthetics, {{he was the first}} to put on rubber gloves, and he devised many new and ingenious operations. But his chief service was rather more general, and hard to describe. It was to bring in a new and better way of regarding the patient. <b>Antisepsis</b> and asepsis, coming in when he was young, had turned the attention of surgeons to external and often extraneous things. Fighting germs, they tended to forget the concrete sick man on the table. Dr. Halsted changed all that. He showed that manhandled tissues, though they could not yell, could yet suffer and die. He studied the natural recuperative powers of the body, and showed how they could be made to help the patient. He stood against reckless slashing, and taught that a surgeon must walk very warily. Dr. William Mayo, one of the cofounders of the Mayo Clinic, once commented that Dr. Halsted took so long to perform procedures that the patients usually healed before he had a chance to close the incision. Though, like most men of his craft, he had no religion, he yet revived and reinforced the ancient saying of Ambroise Paré: ‘God cured him; I assisted.’ Above all, he was a superb teacher, though he never formally taught. The young men who went out from his operating room were magnificently trained, and are among the great ornaments of American surgery today.” ...|$|E

50|$|Pringle made a {{particular}} {{study of the}} treatment of fractures, where he was at an advantage because X-rays had been introduced very early into clinical practice in Glasgow Royal Infirmary, an innovation that allowed Pringle to gain wide personal experience of fractures and their management.
