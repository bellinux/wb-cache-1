500|$|Writing for the Gulf News Hasan Tariq Al Hasan {{argued that}} Tamarod protests on 14 August {{had failed to}} live up to the expectations. He said that one of the main reasons was {{conflicting}} instructions between Bahrain Rebellion Movement and February 14 Youth Coalition, which launched its own Tamarod protest under the title [...] "Tamarod Storm". Ala'a Shehabi said the security measures had made it [...] "physically impossible" [...] for big numbers to gather in one place. In an opinion column in Al-Wasat, Jameel al-Mahari said it was not appropriate to speak about failure or success of the protests, instead he argued that Bahrain's real success was when the unrest ended, [...] "when everyone listens to the voice of reason, when we reach compatible solutions, when the national cohesion is restored <b>and</b> <b>when</b> <b>people</b> feel they are equal before law and that they all are first class citizens." ...|$|E

Paul realises that Diana knows the truth and offers to join forces with her to bring down Rosemary instead.

40|$|A {{dynamic model}} of how trust regulates {{relationship}} promotion is proposed. The model assumes that trust has both impulsive (i. e., automatic {{attitude toward the}} partner) and reflective (i. e., beliefs about the partner's caring) forms. Because overriding evaluative impulses requires self-regulatory resources, the model further posits that self-regulatory capacity controls whether people strengthen relationship connections {{in the face of}} threats to reflective trust. Two experiments and 1 longitudinal daily diary study utilizing convergent manipulations and measures of self-regulatory capacity supported the model. Results revealed that acute uncertainty about a partner's caring increased relationship-promotive sentiment <b>and</b> behavior <b>when</b> (a) <b>people</b> lacked self-regulatory resources to question impulsively trusting sentiments <b>and</b> (b) <b>when</b> <b>people</b> had self-regulatory resources available to override impulsively distrusting sentiments. In contrast, acute uncertainty about a partner's caring decreased relationship-promotive sentiment <b>and</b> behavior <b>when</b> (a) <b>people</b> lacked the self-regulatory capacity to question impulsively distrusting sentiments <b>and</b> (b) <b>when</b> <b>people</b> had the self-regulatory capacity available to override impulsively trusting sentiments...|$|R

And I find it very sad when you find a record, and it says on : [...] "this record was inspired by Miles Davis." [...] Because it's like making...a film, you don't make a film about a film, you make a film about real life. And you wouldn't sit down and write a book about a book, it's like recycling, it misses the point. And music isn't brilliant unless it goes beyond the point of being music and becomes real life. So I'm influenced by real life. <b>And</b> <b>when</b> <b>people</b> listen to my music and say [...] "Oh, I can see great influence from this artist in there", I read that and I say [...] "Okay, I didn't succeed".

The Director of Allotted Life Spans (Siming 司命) deducts from people's accounts and shortens their life spans accordingly.

2500|$|From this {{starting}} point Baudrillard theorized broadly about human society based upon {{this kind of}} self-referentiality. His writing portrays societies always searching {{for a sense of}} meaning—or a [...] "total" [...] understanding of the world—that remains consistently elusive. In contrast to Post-structuralism (such as Michel Foucault), for whom the formations of knowledge emerge only as the result of relations of power, Baudrillard developed theories in which the excessive, fruitless search for total knowledge leads almost inevitably to a kind of delusion. In Baudrillard's view, the (human) subject may try to understand the (non-human) object, but because the object can only be understood according to what it signifies (and because the process of signification immediately involves a web of other signs from which it is distinguished) this never produces the desired results. The subject is, rather, seduced (in the original Latin sense, seducere, to lead away) by the object. He argued therefore that, in final analysis, a complete understanding of the minutiae of human life is impossible, <b>and</b> <b>when</b> <b>people</b> are seduced into thinking otherwise they become drawn toward a [...] "simulated" [...] version of reality, or, to use one of his neologisms, a state of [...] "hyperreality". This {{is not to say that}} the world becomes unreal, but rather that the faster and more comprehensively societies begin to bring reality together into one supposedly coherent picture, the more insecure and unstable it looks and the more fearful societies become. Reality, in this sense, [...] "dies out".|$|E
2500|$|Although {{a causal}} link is not proven, it is {{observed}} that the countries with the best cycle safety records (Denmark and the Netherlands) have among the lowest levels of helmet use.. Their bicycle safety record is generally attributed to public awareness and understanding of cyclists, safety in numbers, education, and cycling infrastructure. A study of cycling in major streets of Boston, Paris and Amsterdam illustrates the variation in cycling culture: Boston had far higher rates of helmet-wearing (32% of cyclists, versus 2.4% in Paris and 0.1% in Amsterdam), Amsterdam had far more cyclists (242 passing bicycles per hour, versus 74 in Paris and 55 in Boston). Cycle helmet wearing rates in the Netherlands and Denmark are very low. An Australian journalist writes: [...] "Rarities in Amsterdam seem to be stretch-fabric-clad cyclists and fat cyclists. Helmets are non-existent, <b>and</b> <b>when</b> <b>people</b> asked me where I was from, they would grimace and mutter: [...] "Ah, yes, helmet laws." [...] These had gained international notoriety on a par with our deadly sea animals. Despite the lack of helmets, cycling in the Netherlands is safer than in any other country, and the Dutch have one-third the number of cycling fatalities (per 100,000 people) that Australia has." [...] Cycling UK say that cycling in the Netherlands and Denmark is perceived as a [...] "normal" [...] activity requiring no special clothing or equipment. Pucher and Buehler state: [...] "The Dutch cycling experts and planners interviewed for this paper adamantly opposed the use of helmets, claiming that helmets discourage cycling by making it less convenient, less comfortable, and less fashionable. They also mention the possibility that helmets would make cycling more dangerous by giving cyclists a false sense of safety and thus encouraging riskier riding behavior." ...|$|E
