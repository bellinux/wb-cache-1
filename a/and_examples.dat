Other flora found at the site include nettle, bramble and elder, with flowers such as lesser celandine, bluebells and Queen Anne's lace appearing in the spring. Peacock butterflies and various species of woodland bird are prevalent in the area.|$|E
5|$|Many {{groups are}} {{simultaneously}} groups <b>and</b> <b>examples</b> of other mathematical structures. In {{the language of}} category theory, they are group objects in a category, meaning that they are objects (that is, examples of another mathematical structure) which come with transformations (called morphisms) that mimic the group axioms. For example, every group (as defined above) is also a set, so a group is a group object {{in the category of}} sets.|$|E

5|$|Takalik Abaj is {{representative}} of the first blossoming of Maya culture that had occurred by about 400 BC. The site includes a Maya royal tomb <b>and</b> <b>examples</b> of Maya hieroglyphic inscriptions that are among the earliest from the Maya region. Excavation is continuing at the site; the monumental architecture and persistent tradition of sculpture in a variety of styles suggest the site was of some importance.|$|E

5|$|Fender {{was bought}} by CBS in 1965. Rhodes stayed with the company, and {{released}} the first Fender Rhodes piano, a 73 note model. The instrument consisted of two components— the piano and a separate enclosure containing the power amplifier and loudspeaker, which was placed underneath the former. Like the piano bass, it was finished in black tolex, and came with a fiberglass top. During the late 1960s, two models of the Fender Rhodes Celeste also became available, which used the top three or four octaves, respectively, of the Fender Rhodes piano. The Celeste did not sell particularly well <b>and</b> <b>examples</b> are now hard to find.|$|E

5|$|One poorly studied area of Maya {{folk art}} is graffiti. Additional graffiti, {{not part of}} the planned decoration, was incised into the stucco of {{interior}} walls, floors, and benches, {{in a wide variety of}} buildings, including temples, residences, and storerooms. Graffiti has been recorded at 51 Maya sites, particularly clustered in the Petén Basin and southern Campeche, and the Chenes region of northwestern Yucatán. At Tikal, where a great quantity of graffiti has been recorded, the subject matter includes drawings of temples, people, deities, animals, banners, litters, and thrones. Graffiti was often inscribed haphazardly, with drawings overlapping each other, and display a mix of crude, untrained art, <b>and</b> <b>examples</b> by artists who were familiar with Classic-period artistic conventions.|$|E
5|$|While rare on Earth, {{silicon carbide}} is remarkably common in space. It {{is a common}} form of {{stardust}} found around carbon-rich stars, <b>and</b> <b>examples</b> of this stardust {{have been found in}} pristine condition in primitive (unaltered) meteorites. The silicon carbide found in space and in meteorites is almost exclusively the beta-polymorph. Analysis of SiC grains found in the Murchison meteorite, a carbonaceous chondrite meteorite, has revealed anomalous isotopic ratios of carbon and silicon, indicating an origin from outside the solar system; 99% of these SiC grains originate around carbon-rich asymptotic giant branch stars. SiC is commonly found around these stars as deduced from their infrared spectra.|$|E
