5|$|As a pupil at Dunfermline High School, Liddell studied chemistry, mathematics, physics, English and {{two other}} languages. He became a {{reluctant}} rugby player, {{under the guidance of}} retired Welsh international Ronnie Boon, while playing football for local teams and Scotland Schoolboys. By the age of 16, Liddell had progressed sufficiently to earn a contract with Lochgelly Violet football club and be sought after by Liverpool, Hamilton Academical, and Partick Thistle. Liverpool manager George Kay became interested in signing Liddell on the recommendation of the club's Scottish defender Matt Busby, who learned of the teenager from Manchester City's Alex Herd while on a golf trip. Herd had forwent one of their rounds to take Willie McAndrew, manager of Hamilton, to watch Liddell play for Lochgelly. When Busby queried him about his absence and Liddell, Herd told him that a contract had not been agreed because limited resources prevented Hamilton from offering Liddell the assurances his parents insisted upon. Instead, Liddell signed for Liverpool as an amateur on 27 July 1938 and became a professional in 1939 on a weekly wage of £3. Negotiations between his parents and the club guaranteed, as a pre-requisite to acceptance, that Liverpool would permit Liddell to continue his accountancy studies, be housed in suitable accommodation, and be employed part-time an accountant <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>company</b> in the club's city.|$|E
5|$|In November 2011, Kaye {{announced}} that particles of pure (unalloyed) titanium {{had also been}} found on the tie. He explained that titanium, which was much rarer in the 1970s than it is today, {{was at that time}} found only in metal fabrication or production facilities, or at chemical companies using it (combined with aluminum) to store extremely corrosive substances. The findings suggested that Cooper may have been a chemist or a metallurgist, or possibly an engineer or manager (the only employees who wore ties in such facilities at that time) in a metal or chemical manufacturing plant, or <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>company</b> that recovered scrap metal from those types of factories. In January 2017, Kaye reported that rare earth minerals such as cerium and strontium sulfide had also been identified among particles from the tie. One of the rare applications for such elements in the 1970s was Boeing's supersonic transport development project, suggesting the possibility that Cooper was a Boeing employee. Other possible sources of the material included plants that manufactured cathode ray tubes, such as the Portland firms Teledyne and Tektronix.|$|E

The riddle is solved when looking <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>company</b> catalog (leaflet) that zooms out showing a clown complete with ruffles and a tall pointed hat and carrying a Fun Ho! sign (Jordan 2015). The clown was most often printed in red, and was even used for company Christmas cards once upon a time (Jordan 2015). The logo was probably OK from the 1930s through the 1960s, but as an advertising gimmick, the design would probably would not work well with children today.|$|E

On 18 May 1945, British extradited some Croatian ministers and Prime Minister Nikola Mandić to the Yugoslav authorities. Artuković was not extradited, but he was released soon with remaining ministers.

Specifically, her song [...] "Raise You Higher" [...] was selected for several song countdowns and was played across Canada by both secular and Christian radio stations. A CBC Radio reviewer called Loder [...] "amazingly talented", her music [...] "gorgeous" [...] and her song [...] "Playground" [...] in particular [...] "absolutely beautiful". In April 2012, Loder said that she had not decided whether she would focus on medicine or music.

500|$|However, this aura of {{untouchability}} nearly {{came to an}} {{end when}} the cornermaster was himself cornered. Little particularly favored shorting the stocks of the Erie Railroad Company, and it was here that he was trapped by the cornering of the company's stock by a hostile syndicate of rival stockbrokers calling itself the [...] "Happy Family" [...] (in {{much the same way as}} he had done to countless other traders before). This led to a rather dramatic showdown between Little and the financiers involved. At the time, making good on a purchase promise required a transaction at the associated clerk's office, and on the day it was due the brokers gathered at the Erie Railroad Company clerk's office, smug at the likelihood that they had beaten Little at his own game. What the traders did not know was that Little had purchased convertible bonds <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>company</b> sale in London a few years before; Little entered the premises, apparently unrushed, carrying an oversize bag of what was revealed to be those very bonds, which Little had converted to stocks. To the astonishment of all, Little not only outplayed the syndicate but came out hundreds of thousands of dollars ahead; such a maneuver was never attempted again.|$|E
500|$|Credit {{issues were}} {{becoming}} more critical, however. Around {{the time the}} buyout was made public, Moody's and S both reduced Enron's rating to just one notch above junk status. Were the company's rating to fall below investment-grade, its ability to trade would be severely limited {{if there was a}} reduction or elimination of its credit lines with competitors. In a conference call, S affirmed that, were Enron not to be bought, S would reduce its rating to low BB or high B, ratings noted as being within junk status. Additionally, many traders had limited their involvement with Enron, or stopped doing business altogether, fearing more bad news. Watson again attempted to re-assure, attesting at a presentation to investors that there was [...] "nothing wrong with Enron's business". He also acknowledged that remunerative steps (in the form of more stock options) would have to be taken to redress the animosity of many Enron employees towards management after it was revealed that Lay and other officials had sold hundreds of millions of dollars' worth of stock during the months prior to the crisis. The situation was not helped by the disclosure that Lay, his [...] "reputation in tatters", stood to receive a payment of $60 million as a change-of-control fee subsequent to the Dynegy acquisition, while many Enron employees had seen their retirement accounts, which were based largely on Enron stock, ravaged as the price decreased 90% in a year. An official <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>company</b> owned by Enron stated [...] "We had some married couples who both worked who lost as much as $800,000 or $900,000. It pretty much wiped out every employee's savings plan." ...|$|E
