50|$|An <b>archipelagic</b> <b>apron</b> for a fan-shaped gently sloping {{region of}} sea floor found around oceanic islands, {{particularly}} in the south Pacific Ocean. The name was first proposed by Henry William Menard in 1956 because of the resemblance of the slope to an apron. While most such underwater sedimentary surfaces are generally smooth, some are rough in texture. The total volume occupied by an <b>archipelagic</b> <b>apron</b> is often many {{times that of the}} adjacent island. Hence, it is unlikely to have formed from sediments washed off the part of the island above sea level. Instead, archipelagic aprons most likely formed from debris avalanches and pyroclastic flows. The material is then reworked by turbidity currents to achieve their current form. Such aprons form about eight percent of the area of the pacific basin.|$|E
40|$|The main {{objectives}} of Leg 17 were {{to establish the}} regional pattern of oceanic crustal ages in the central Pacific, to obtain cores of the entire stratigraphic succession, especially from pre-Middle Eocene strata, To document the history of growth and subsidence of seamounts located along seamount chains, by drilling on the <b>archipelagic</b> <b>apron</b> of sediments near the foot of individual seamounts and to sample acoustic reflectors seen on seismic reflection profiles and to establish their physical properties and their ages...|$|E
40|$|Sediment cores {{recovered}} from three holes drilled during Ocean Drilling Program Leg 136 include volcaniclastics probably {{derived from the}} Hawaiian islands. The volcaniclastics shallower than 10 meters below seafloor are fresh and are composed of basaltic glass (sideromelane), basaltic fragments (mainly tachylite), plagioclase, olivine, pyroxene, and opaque minerals. Most of these glasses are probably products of hydrovolcanism. Visibly, some of these volcaniclastics are recognized as bedded ash layers having thicknesses that range from 5 to 10 cm. However, many volcaniclastics are disrupted by bioturbation to some degree, and are sometimes totally mixed with ambient brown clays. No visible correlative ash layer among these holes was found. It seems that many ash layers thinner than the bedded layers were disrupted by bioturbation because of the low sedimentation rate of volcaniclastics. The volcaniclastics were probably transported one of two ways: through air fall and pelagic settling or through turbidity-current transport. Other <b>archipelagic</b> <b>apron</b> volcaniclastic sediments of volcanic seamounts suggest that turbidite transport is the favored explanation of origin...|$|E
40|$|Necker Ridge is {{an enigmatic}} 650 -km long, narrow, linear aseismic {{bathymetric}} feature that rises 2500 to 3000 m above the abyssal seafloor {{south of the}} Hawaiian Ridge. The ridge is the largest {{of a series of}} aseismic ridges that emanate from {{the eastern side of the}} Mid-Pacific Mountains outward towards the northeast. The trend of Necker Ridge is at an angle to fracture zones and spreading centers in the region, so its origin is controversial, yet it is a major feature on this part of the Cretaceous Pacific Plate. The entire feature, from Necker Island on the Hawaiian Ridge to the eastern Mid-Pacific Mountains, including the adjacent abyssal seafloor, was mapped in 2009 and 2011 with the latest generation of multibeam echosounders. The detailed bathymetry shows the ridge to be constructed of a series of stacked, thick (200 â€“ 400 m) volcanic flows that can be traced along the trend of Necker Ridge for 100 s of km. This continuity suggests that the volcanism erupted simultaneously along almost the entire length of the feature and not as spatially episodic areas of extrusion. Three relatively flat platforms occur on the summit region, presumably constructed of shallow-water carbonates when these portions of the ridge were at sea level. A conspicuous lack of thick pelagic sediment on the non-platform ridge summit and flanks is seen throughout the ridge. The lack of landslides along the length of the ridge is equally puzzling. The southern end of the ridge is connected by a saddle to the Mid-Pacific Mountains whereas the northern end of the ridge is buried by an <b>archipelagic</b> <b>apron</b> of the southern flank of the Hawaiian Ridge...|$|E
