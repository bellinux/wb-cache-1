40|$|OBJECTIVE: Patient {{satisfaction}} is a commonly measured indicator of quality emergency care. However, the existing empirical literature on emergency department (ED) patient satisfaction provides little guidance {{on how to}} analyze, interpret, and use data obtained in the clinical setting. Using two EDs as examples, the authors describe practical strategies designed to identify priority areas for potential improvement. METHODS: The authors used a cross-sectional, observational design. All patients who presented for emergency care during the designated time periods were eligible. Patients were randomly selected, contacted by telephone, and surveyed using three measures of global satisfaction, 23 perceived quality-of-care indicators, and six perceived wait times. Descriptive statistics were calculated. Comparisons were made {{of each of the}} perceived care and wait time indicators against explicitly defined <b>acceptability</b> <b>criteria</b> to determine satisfiers/dissatisfiers. Each indicator was correlated with the three global satisfaction indices. The authors integrated results obtained from applying the <b>acceptability</b> <b>criteria</b> with those obtained from the correlations to yield priority indicators for remediation and maintenance strategies. RESULTS: For hospitals A and B, respectively, 15 (52 %) and 16 (55 %) of perceived care and wait time indicators failed to meet <b>acceptability</b> <b>criteria.</b> Using the correlations with overall satisfaction, the authors further narrowed the priority areas for remediation to six indicators for hospital A and three indicators for hospital B. One maintenance indicator was revealed for hospital A and four for hospital B. CONCLUSIONS: A combination of applying explicit <b>acceptability</b> <b>criteria</b> to descriptive statistics and using correlation coefficients with overall satisfaction can help to maximize the usefulness of patient satisfaction data by uncovering priority areas. These priority areas were broken down into maintenance and remediation indicators and were found to vary considerably depending on the hospital in question. Such strategies can help to refine performance improvement efforts by targeting those domains with the greatest impact on overall satisfaction...|$|E

40|$|Invasive {{species have}} {{significant}} ecological and economic impacts. To control species 2 ̆ 7 invasion, risk assessment {{provides the most}} essential information for identification and evaluation of the potential risk of the invasive species, especially in their early invasion stages. Species distribution models (SDMs) is the foundation for risk assessment, {{in terms of both}} the practical and theoretical interest in our understanding of species invasion process. SDMs contribute to the proactive invasion management and the test of ecological or biogeographical hypotheses about species distributions in relation to their environment. However, modeling of invasive species at large spatial scale (i. e., cross-continental) is rarely discussed. Besides, sampling bias of the presence-only occurrence data can seriously reduce the performance of SDMs, but no quantitative method is available to assess data quality. In my thesis, I used MaxEnt to build bioclimatic envelope models for 39 high-risk invasive plant species and predicted their potential invasion ranges in the U. S., based on their global-scale and presence-only occurrence data. I used optimized-parameterization techniques such as `target-group 2 ̆ 7 background selection and regularization value optimization to improve model performance. I also created an <b>acceptability</b> <b>criterion,</b> proximity to ideal completeness and evenness (PICE), to evaluate the quality of species occurrence data in terms of representativeness and equilibrium. Results indicated that southern Florida and southwestern U. S. have high probability of invasion for most of the 39 invasive plant species. Meanwhile, the quality of species occurrence data has greater influences on model performance than parameterization. Generally, model performance (reliability and accuracy) stabilizes when PICE is greater than 0. 40. The predicted results can assist early detection and monitoring of exotic invasion via regional-level prevention, proactive management, and policy-making. PICE {{can be used as a}} model-independent <b>acceptability</b> <b>criterion</b> to evaluate model performance with a given set of species occurrence data. The computational efficiency of PICE benefits the SDM community by preventing the utilization of biased, poor quality species occurrence data. ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Since the {{presentation}} of the backpropagation algorithm, several adaptive learning algorithms for training a multilayer perceptron (MLP) have been proposed. In a recent article, we have introduced an efficient training algorithm based on a nonmonotone spectral conjugate gradient. In particular, a scaled version of the conjugate gradient method suggested by Perry, which employ the spectral steplength of Barzilai and Borwein, was presented. The learning rate was automatically adapted at each epoch according to Shanno’s technique which exploits the information of conjugate directions as well as the previous learning rate. In addition, a new <b>acceptability</b> <b>criterion</b> for the learning rate was utilized based on nonmonotone Wolfe conditions. A crucial issue of these training algorithms is the learning rate adaptation. Various variable learning rate adaptations have been introduced in the literature to improve the convergence speed and avoid convergence to local minima. In this contribution, we incorporate in the previous training algorithm a new effective variable learning rate adaptation, which increases its efficiency. Experimental results in a set of standard benchmarks of MLP networks show that the proposed training algorithm improves the convergence speed and success percentage over a set of well known training algorithms. ...|$|R
