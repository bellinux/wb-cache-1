5|$|Lee's {{battle plan}} for July 2 {{called for a}} general <b>assault</b> <b>of</b> Meade's {{position}}s. On the right, Longstreet's First Corps was to position itself to attack the Union left flank, facing northeast astraddle the Emmitsburg Road, and to roll up the U.S.line. The attack sequence was to begin with Maj. Gens. John Bell Hood's and Lafayette McLaws's divisions, followed by Maj. Gen. Richard H. Anderson's division of Hill's Third Corps.|$|E

Although the Rangers at Pointe-du-Hoc were greatly assisted in their <b>assault</b> <b>of</b> the cliffs by the Satterlee and Talybont, elsewhere the air and naval bombardment was not so effective, and the German beach defenses and supporting artillery remained largely intact.|$|E
5|$|Southwark Crown Court found Harris {{guilty of}} all twelve counts of indecent assault. During the trial, it was learned that, while making Kids Can Say No!, Harris was {{involved}} in a casual sexual relationship with his daughter Bindi's best friend; the relationship began when the victim was 13 years old and lasted for 15 years. Harris had committed nine of the twelve counts by the film's release, including the <b>assault</b> <b>of</b> fifteen-year-old Tonya Lee in London three months before the release. The first victim was about the age of the children in Kids Can Say No! The last <b>assault</b> <b>of</b> which Harris was convicted occurred several weeks after his meeting with officials in Western Australia to propose another film about child sexual abuse. A former child actor from the Barbara Speake Stage School who appeared in Kids Can Say No! said that Harris' behavior with older girls at the school made Harris' eventual arrest unsurprising.|$|E

Ylenia disappeared on 31 July 2007, nearly three months after Madeleine, and was found dead in September as a result of toluene poisoning. Von Aesch was living in Spain when Madeleine disappeared.|$|E

5|$|Although Pulaski {{frequently}} {{suffered from}} malaria while stationed in Charleston, {{he remained in}} active service. At the beginning of September Lincoln prepared to launch an attempt to retake Savannah with French assistance.

Pulaski captured a British outpost near Ogeechee River. His units then acted as an advance guard for the allied French units under Admiral Charles Hector, comte d'Estaing.

Troop morale had sharply declined {{as a result of}} the island's dismal conditions, creating a condition that the troops called the 'Aleutian stare' amongst those who had been on the island for more than six months.

A few weeks later Adrianople surrendered. In the meantime, the Byzantines captured the ship with the Bulgarian and Fatimid envoys on its way back to Bulgaria. Romanos I thus learned about the negotiations and outbid the Bulgarians.|$|E

Production was completed on a low budget; Djajakusuma later recalled that their camera had to be powered by a car battery.
