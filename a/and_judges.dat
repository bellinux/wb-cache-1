5|$|Generally, {{justice is}} costly to provide and many legal systems, {{especially}} in Asia, are fraught with {{issues such as}} weak legal institutions, corrupt and incompetent administrative officers <b>and</b> <b>judges,</b> excessive delays and limited access to justice stemming from high legal costs {{and the lack of}} legal aid. It was agreed during the World Justice Forum in 2008 that access to justice is key to advancing the rule of law.|$|E
5|$|In Singapore, {{ensuring}} {{widespread and}} {{equal access to}} justice for Singapore citizens is a constant goal.

5|$|After {{the repeal}} of the Stamp Act, Parliament took a {{different}} approach to raising revenue, passing the Townshend Acts in 1767 which established new duties on various goods imported into the colonies. These duties were relatively low because the British ministry wanted to establish the precedent that Parliament had the right to impose tariffs on the colonies before raising them. Revenues from these duties were to be used to pay for governors <b>and</b> <b>judges</b> who would be independent of colonial control. To enforce compliance with the new laws, the Townshend Acts created a customs agency known as the American Board of Custom Commissioners, which was headquartered in Boston.|$|E

5|$|Although Democratic-Republicans held {{a narrow}} {{majority}} in the Senate, the Federalist senators were both experienced and devoted their cause. Breckinridge acted as floor leader for the Democratic-Republicans and newly elected president, Thomas Jefferson. His proposed repeal of the Federalist-supported Judicial Act of 1801, which had {{increased the number of}} federal courts <b>and</b> <b>judges,</b> was particularly controversial. On January 4, 1802, he presented caseload data to argue that the new courts <b>and</b> <b>judges</b> were unnecessary. Federalist leader Gouverneur Morris countered that the proposal was unconstitutional; once established, courts were inviolate, he maintained. On January 20, Federalist Jonathan Dayton moved to return the bill to a committee to consider amendments. South Carolina's John E. Colhoun, a Democratic-Republican, voted with the Federalists, and the result was a 15–15 tie. Empowered to break the tie, Jefferson's vice president, Aaron Burr, voted with the Federalists. The five-man committee consisted of three Federalists, enough to prevent the bill's return to the floor, but when Vermont Senator Stephen R. Bradley, who had traveled home because of a family illness, returned to the chamber, the Democratic-Republicans regained a majority and introduced a successful discharge petition. In one last attempt to derail the legislation in debate, Federalists argued that the judiciary would strike down the repeal as unconstitutional; Breckinridge denied the notion that the courts had the power to invalidate an act of Congress. On February 3, the Senate repealed the act by a vote of 16–15, with the House concurring a month later.|$|E
5|$|Taft's federal judgeship was a {{lifetime}} appointment, {{and one from}} which promotion to the Supreme Court might come. Taft's older half-brother Charles, successful in business, supplemented Taft's government salary, allowing William and Nellie Taft and their family to live in comfort. Taft's duties involved hearing trials in the circuit, which included Ohio, Michigan, Kentucky, and Tennessee, and participating with Supreme Court Justice John Marshall Harlan, the circuit justice, <b>and</b> <b>judges</b> of the Sixth Circuit in hearing appeals. Taft spent these years, from 1892 to 1900, in personal and professional contentment.|$|E
5|$|The Code sought {{not only}} to {{determine}} what could be portrayed on screen, but also to promote traditional values.

All criminal action had to be punished, and neither the crime nor the criminal could elicit sympathy from the audience. Authority figures had to be treated respectfully, and the clergy could not be portrayed as comic characters or villains. Under some circumstances, politicians, police officers <b>and</b> <b>judges</b> could be villains, {{as long as it was}} clear that they were the exception to the rule.|$|E

The post of Castellano was abolished, <b>and</b> <b>judges</b> were nominated by the Commission de Gouvernement. During the years of French occupation, the building was known as the Palais de Justice. Not less than three full cases of silver secured at the Castellania, were taken by the French on November 8, 1798, and were melted to create coins to remunerate the Jacobins. It was {{one of a series of}} similar reasons that consequently triggered a Maltese revolt. The French law system did not last enough to influence the Maltese courts at the time.|$|E

5|$|A {{young girl}} was found raped and murdered, and Max Stuart, an Aborigine, {{was convicted and}} sentenced to be {{executed}} only a month later, {{on the basis of a}} confession gained during interrogation, although he had protested his innocence in pidgin English. Stuart's lawyer claimed that the confession was forced, and appeals to the Supreme and High Courts were dismissed. A linguist who investigated the case thought that the style of English in the confession was inconsistent with Stuart's background and speech. This aroused disquiet and objections against the fairness of the trial among an increasing number of legal academics <b>and</b> <b>judges,</b> and The News brought much attention to Stuart's plight with an aggressive, tabloid-style campaign. Soon, the case attracted international attention, some on the assumption that the legal system was racist. The former High Court Justice Sir John Latham also spoke out.|$|E
