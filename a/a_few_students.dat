25|$|The {{schools were}} highly {{rejected}} by the more conservative Tabrizis, specially clerics, alleging that Roshdieh {{is trying to make}} the students quit Islam, mentioning the school ring and its similarity to church bells.

25|$|In 1925 the {{government}} adopted {{a plan to}} expand secular education, but ten years later there were only 8,000 students enrolled in twenty public schools. <b>A</b> <b>few</b> <b>students</b> also studied abroad on government scholarships; Pankhurst provides minimum numbers for several countries: at least 20 studied in Lebanon, 19 in Egypt, 12 in Sudan, 63 in France, 25 in England, 8 in the United States, 10 in Switzerland, 10 in Italy, and smaller numbers in Germany, Belgium and Spain.|$|E
25|$|Although {{the number}} of {{subjects}} offered was large, choices were limited as each school could offer only a few subjects on the list for budget constraints, restrictions on combinations of subjects and the actual time allowed to cover the large syllabus of different subjects. In addition, some of the subjects were unpopular. One could not tAle the A and AS of a subject at the same examination. Students could take a maximum of 7 AL and/or AS subjects in one examination, but only <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>students</b> actually took 7 subjects from 2004.|$|E

25|$|The honor {{system is}} {{strongly}} enforced. In most years, only <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>students</b> withdraw {{in the face}} of an honor charge or after investigations and closed hearings conducted by the Executive Committee of the Student Body, the University's elected student government (with the accused counseled by Honor Advocates, often law students). In recent years, four or five students have left each year. Students found guilty in a closed hearing may appeal the verdict to an open hearing before the entire student body, although this option is rarely exercised. If found guilty at an open trial, the student is dismissed from the university permanently.|$|E
25|$|On April 15, 1967, at Sheep Meadow, Central Park, New York City, some 60 {{young men}} {{including}} <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>students</b> from Cornell University {{came together to}} burn their draft cards in a Maxwell House coffee can. Surrounded by their friends who linked arms to protect them, the men began burning their cards. Others rushed in to join them, holding their burning cards up in the air. Watching this were police, FBI men, newsreel cameramen, reporters, photographers and passers-by. Uniformed Green Beret Army reservist Gary Rader walked to the center and burned his draft card. The 23-year-old was arrested by FBI agents several days later {{at his home in}} Evanston, Illinois. Time magazine estimated 75 total cards; participant Martin Jezer wrote that there were about 158 cards burnt in all. Future Youth International Party leader Hoffman was in attendance.|$|E
25|$|China {{could not}} afford a heavy investment, either ideologically or financially, in the {{education}} of <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>students.</b> Since 1978 China's leaders have modified the policy of concentrating education resources at the university level, which, although designed to facilitate modernization, conflicted directly with the party's principles. The policies that produced an educated elite also siphoned off resources that might have been used to accomplish the compulsory nine-year education more speedily and to equalize educational opportunities in the city and the countryside. The policy of key schools has been modified over the years. Nevertheless, China's leaders believe an educated elite is necessary to reach modernization goals. Corruption has been increasingly problematic for rural schools. Because the educational funding is distributed from the top down, each layer of bureaucracy has tended to siphon off {{more than its share of}} funding, leaving too little for the bottom rural level.|$|E

25|$|From 1686 to 1689 Frankland {{had held}} his academy at Attercliffe, on the {{outskirts}} of Sheffield. On his return in July 1689 with the academy to Rathmell, Jollie started an independent academy at Attercliffe. The London Presbyterian fund sent him <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>students,</b> but none after 1696. By May 1700 he had sent out forty ministers, and had twenty-six in training. Not thirty names of his students are known, but the list includes Thomas Bradbury, Benjamin Grosvenor, D.D., William Harris, D.D. (1675?–1740), John Bowes (1690–1767), Lord Chancellor of Ireland, Thomas Secker (in 1708–9), archbishop of Canterbury, and Nicholas Saunderson, scientist and mathematician. Grosvenor commends the excellence of his discipline and the charm of his eloquence, and thinks that his exemplary character compensated for shortcomings in his learning. It appears that mathematical studies were prohibited ‘as tending to scepticism and infidelity,’ but many of the students ‘by stealth made a considerable progress’ in this department. After Jollie's death the academy was continued by John Wadsworth till 1718, and perhaps later.|$|E

500|$|University {{regulations}} {{introduced by}} Laud prescribed that the professor was to lecture {{for one hour}} every Wednesday between university terms at 9am (and during Lent at 8am) on Arabic grammar and literature, using [...] "the work of some approved and ancient author, in which the proprities of the language and the elegance of the expression are remarkable." [...] Failure to deliver a lecture on an appointed day would be marked with a fine of 20shillings, unless the professor was very ill or had an urgent reason for absence approved by the Vice-Chancellor. Laud required the lecturer to speak without using [...] "a hurried enunciation, but make all his statements {{in such a way}} that they may be readily taken down in writing by his hearers", and to remain after the lecture to listen to any questions [...] "with kindness, and solve the difficulties and doubts mooted." [...] Although all Bachelors of Arts and all medical students at the university were required to attend, this does not seem to have happened: Pococke only had <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>students</b> in the years that he was in Oxford. Laud's statutes provided that a student failing to attend the lecture without gaining the approval of the Vice-Chancellor would be fined sixpence. Fines were to be used to purchase Arabic books for the Bodleian Library.|$|E
