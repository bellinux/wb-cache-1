40|$|Abstract] In {{this paper}} an {{overview}} is given {{of a new}} biotechnological process to remove hydrogen sulphide from gas streams. This process is jointly developed by Wageningen University, Delft University of Technology, Paques <b>B.</b> <b>V.</b> and Shell Global Solutions <b>International</b> <b>B.</b> <b>V.</b> In 1992, the first full-scale installation for H 2 S removal from biogas was taken into operation whilst in 2002 the first unit for high pressure natural gas desulphurisation was started-up. The removal of sulphur dioxide from flue gasses is feasible as well and in 2006 the first unit went on-stream in China. Currently, more than 75 full-scale plants are in operation worldwide. The formed bio-sulphur has a hydrophilic nature which enables its re-use, e. g. as a fertilizer or fungicide...|$|R

40|$|A {{relevant}} {{objective of}} the sulphuric acid (H 2 SO 4) production industry today is to obtain sulphur dioxide (SO 2) gas streams with the highest possible SO 2 concentration after the elemental sulphur combustion stage {{in order to reduce}} both capital and operating costs. A new technology, Chemical Looping Combustion (CLC), is able to generate gaseous streams that are highly concentrated in combustion products by means of oxygen transfer from air to the fuel using a solid oxygen carrier. This work proposes a new process for H 2 SO 4 production via CLC and using elemental sulphur as fuel. An oxygen carrier with high sulphur resistance should be used for this purpose. The analysis of this process has brought promising results, such as the easy integration of the CLC system into the entire H 2 SO 4 production plant and the confirmation that this is a process in which the energy potential of sulphur is exploited to a very high degree. Furthermore, the proof of concept was carried out by burning elemental sulphur in a 500 Wth CLC unit with a high sulphur-resistant oxygen carrier based on iron oxide, Fe 20 γAl. This work presents the first ever results of elemental sulphur combustion by an oxygen carrier. Complete combustion of sulphur to SO 2 was achieved, and no deactivation of the oxygen carrier was observed. Considering all the results obtained in this work, it can be concluded that the production of H 2 SO 4 via CLC is a feasible technology which can provide a series of relevant techno-economic benefits in comparison with current industrial production process.

40|$|Sour gas {{represents}} about 43 % of the world's natural gas reserves. The sustainable {{use of this}} fossil fuel energy entails the application of CO 2 Capture and Storage (CCS) technologies. The Chemical Looping Combustion (CLC) technology can join the exploitation of the energy potential of the sour gas and the CO 2 capture process in a single step without the need of a sweetening pre-treatment unit. In this work, a total of 60 h of continuous operation with sour gas and H 2 S concentrations up to 15 vol% {{has been carried out}} in a 500 Wth CLC unit, from which 40 corresponded to a Cu-based oxygen carrier (Cu 14 γAl) and 20 to a Fe-based material (Fe 20 γAl). This {{is the first time that}} so high H 2 S concentrations are present in a fuel to be burnt in a CLC process. The Cu 14 γAl oxygen carrier seems to be not recommendable for the combustion of sour gas because, although all the H 2 S is burnt to SO 2, copper sulfides were formed at all combustion conditions. In contrast, the Fe 20 γAl oxygen carrier presented an excellent behavior with no agglomeration problems and maintaining the reactivity of the fresh material. The sour gas (CH 4, H 2 and H 2 S) was completely burnt, and neither SO 2 was released in the AR nor iron sulfides were formed at usual CLC operating conditions. These tests demonstrated the possibility to use sour gas in a CLC process with 100 % CO 2 capture without any SO 2 emissions to the atmosphere.

This The food enzyme considered in this opinion is a 4 -α-D-glucan maltohydrolase (EC 3. 2. 1. 2) obtained from grain of barley (Hordeum vulgare), by the companies Genencor <b>International</b> <b>B.</b> <b>V.</b> and Senson Oy. This β-amylase {{is intended to be}} used in several food-manufacturing processes: baking and brewing processes, distilled alcohol production, and starch processing for the production of glucose syrups. The compositional data provided for the food enzyme were considered sufficient. The manufacturing process did not raise safety concerns. Based on the maximum use levels recommended for the respective food processes, dietary exposure to the food enzyme–total organic solids (TOS) was estimated on the basis of individual data from the EFSA Comprehensive European Food Consumption Database. This exposure estimate is similar to or lower than the exposure to a fraction of barley comparable to the food enzyme– TOS, resulting from the consumption of barley-derived foods. As the food enzyme is derived from edible parts of barley, in line with the requirements of the guidance document on food enzyme assessment, the Panel accepted that {{there was no need for}} the provision of toxicological data for this food enzyme. Barley is known as a gluten-containing cereal; however, the gluten content in the food enzyme was found to be below the detection limit of the applied analytical method and well below the threshold value of 20 mg/kg for ‘gluten-free’ products. Furthermore, the potential allergenicity was evaluated by searching for similarity between the amino acid sequence of β-amylase and the sequences of known food allergens; no match was found. Based on the origin of the food enzyme from edible parts of barley, the enzymemanufacturing process, the compositional and biochemical data provided, the allergenicity and dietary exposure assessment, the Panel concluded that this food enzyme does not give rise to safety concerns under the intended conditions of use...|$|R

40|$|This is {{the author}} {{accepted}} manuscript. The final version is available from Nature Publishing Group via the DOI in this record. The Early Jurassic Toarcian Oceanic Anoxic Event (183 Ma) was marked by marine anoxia–euxinia and globally significant organic-matter burial, accompanied by a major global carbon-cycle perturbation probably linked to Karoo-Ferrar volcanism. Although the Toarcian Oceanic Anoxic Event is well studied in the marine realm, accompanying climatic and environmental change on the continents is poorly understood. Here, utilizing radiometric, palynological and geochemical data from lacustrine black shales, we demonstrate that a major lake system developed contemporaneously with the Toarcian Oceanic Anoxic Event in the Sichuan Basin, China, likely due to enhanced hydrological cycling under elevated atmospheric pCO 2. Coeval accelerated organic-carbon burial in both marine and lacustrine basins suggests nutrient delivery as the prime cause for global carbon-cycle recovery during the Toarcian Oceanic Anoxic Event. Increased lacustrine organic productivity from elevated fluvial nutrient supply resulted in the burial of 460 Gt of organic carbon in the Sichuan Basin alone, creating an important negative feedback in the global exogenic carbon cycle, which significantly shortened the global δ 13 C recoveryShell International Exploration & Production <b>B.</b> <b>V.</b> is acknowledged for financial support for this study.

40|$|AbstractAdding CO 2 capture to fossil-fuelled power {{generation}} results in significant plant efficiency penalties, impacting {{the performance and}} economics of the plant. However, many of the public domain studies do not consider technology advancements and optimal heat and power integration. This paper evaluates the efficiency impact of improvements in technology selection, energy recovery and heat integration on the overall thermal efficiency of IGCC schemes with pre-combustion CO 2 capture. A previous study[1] {{has shown that the}} application of emerging or newer technologies and improved process/heat integration to coal-based integrated gasification combined cycle (IGCC) with carbon capture could achieve a cumulative efficiency improvement of more than six percentage points when compared with a current design. This paper looks in more detail at how some of these savings can be achieved and identifies improvements which could be achieved in the near term. In particular, the application of a modified shift system, Thiopaq O&G sulphur removal technology and a novel CO 2 wash system have been included in the scope.

Publications concerning the transmission properties of these 4. 5 -mm thick stainless steel (AISI number 303 / 304) shielding segments are scarce and not compatible for implementation in treatment planning. Therefore the effect of shielding on dose distribution is unknown. The effective transmission factor has been measured and implemented in the planning computations. Screening efficacy was evaluated on 20 actual treatment plans, analyzing dose reduction to critical tissue and comparing dose distribution in planes relevant for this particular application. Due to high transmission (effective transmission factor = 0. 85), stainless steel screening segments only provide low, local dose reductions of maximum 15 %. A new approach with regard to optimization and source configuration is needed to reduce dose to vulnerable tissue, exploiting the screening segments to a maximum extent. Better shielding, especially at the midline (plane bisecting the ovoids) could be expected by using shielding segments with other geometrical characteristics.

40|$|There is a {{considerable}} practical interest in phosphorus recovery from water authorities, elementary P-industry, fertilizer industry and regulators {{in a number of}} countries. Due to a handful of full-scale plants worldwide, P-recovery can be seen as technically feasible. However, the economic feasibility of P-recovery from sewage can still be judged as dubious. The most important {{reason for this is that}} the prices of the techniques (in [/tonne P) are much higher compared to the prices of phosphate rock. In this paper an analysis is given to recover phosphate from municipal wastewater for the elementary P-industry Thermphos <b>International</b> <b>B.</b> <b>V.</b> and the fertiliser industry Amsterdam Fertilizers <b>B.</b> <b>V.</b> in The Netherlands. Several scenarios are evaluated and the end products of these scenarios are compared to the quality required by both industries. From a Dutch study it became clear that all end products from the final sludge treatment do not provide a good source of secondary phosphate. As a consequence of this, the most preferred possibility for P-recovery is to extract phosphate before sludge goes to the final sludge treatment. Different scenarios can be selected based on the position of P-recovery in the WWTP configuration, the type of P-recovery product, and the precipitation technique. Local conditions will determine which scenario is the most expedient. Because it is more realistic to judge a practical situation instead of theoretical estimations based on literature, some local situations have to be assessed in sufficient detail to gain more feeling for the expenses and possible savings of P-recovery. One important actor that should be involved in the process management around P-recovery, is the national government. Especially, the Government have the responsibility for sustainable development and should have attention for some stimulation of P-recovery in The Netherlands.

Seasons had significant influence on the seroprevalence of Salmonella infection. The seroprevalence was significantly higher in summer (82 %) than that in rainy (66. 8 %) and winter (50 %) seasons. The location of farms, i. e. upazilas also had significant association with the occurrence of Salmonella infection. The seroprevalence significantly differed between the different categories of flock size. The flock size of 5001 and above had the highest seroprevalence (81. 4 %) among other categories.

In a laboratory study on the distraction from the task to account for the other traffic, it was found tha t deteriora tions mainly occurred in incident situations. The deteriorations are largest for stimuli from alocation right in front of the car, especially for elder drivers. Under circumstances all pictogrammes caused deteriorations. In difficuit situations complex pictogrammes cause more deteriorations than simple ones. Most sensitive to deteriorations are elderly drivers and young males when driving at high speeds.

40|$|Heterogeneous {{catalyst}} based pellets typify {{a material}} where functionality is dependant on hierarchical pore structures spanning many {{orders of magnitude}} from nanometers up to tens of microns. The total activity, selectivity and lifetime of catalyst based pellets depends {{on the ability of}} molecules to flow through a large pellet bed (m), into the pellets (mm) and their pore structure (μm-nm) to/from the active sites. Three dimensional imaging techniques such as tomography allow for the direct characterisation and quantification of pore structures. However, the field of view in tomography decreases as resolution increases. This work circumvents this issue with multiscale tomography (MT) combining x-ray microtomography (XMT), dual beam focused ion beam tomography (DB-FIB) and electron tomography (ET) to probe porous pellet based catalysts. The results show MT as a viable method that offers new insights into the quantification and behaviour of pellet based catalysts across large length scales, all in three dimensions (3 D), that no single tomographic technique can adequately capture. MT was successfully used in the characterising of pore sizes, distributions, structures and spatial relationships and this was compared to existing multiscale characterisation techniques to illustrate the new insights that can be obtained. The pore structures were meshed and modeled using MT data to provide results for understanding the transport properties scaled up from the nanometre length scale to the packed bed, through pellet based catalysts produced under different manufacturing conditions. The results show the very strong dependence on the calcining temperature which is important for designing better catalysts in future. The tomography data was also used to determine thermal/mechanical stresses at both a pellet and pellet bed level. Although many stresses are compressive; the packing of the pellets creates local tensile stresses and a potential cause for pellet failure through internal flaws at relatively low loads. In summary, multiscale tomography was demonstrated to be a viable method for obtaining new insights for the development of pellet based catalysts by both improved quantification and allows for the first time direct 3 D multiscale simulation of transport and mechanical properties across multiple scales from nanometers to metres to catalyst pellets in beds.

It focuses upon one sensational piece of litigation in South Africa, Laugh It Off Promotions v. South African Breweries <b>International</b> (Finance) <b>B.</b> <b>V.</b> t/a Sabmark <b>International.</b> In this case, a group called Laugh It Off Promotions subjected the trade marks of the manufacturers of Carling Beer were subjected to parody, social satire, and culture jamming. The beer slogan “Black Label” was turned into a T-Shirt entitled “Black Labour/ White Guilt”. In the ensuing litigation, the High Court of South Africa and the Supreme Court of Appeal were of the opinion that the appropriation of the mark was a case of hate speech. However, the Constitutional Court of South Africa disagreed, finding that the parodies of a well-known, famous trade mark did not constitute trade mark dilution. Moseneke J observed that {{there was a lack of}} evidence of economic or material harm; and Sachs J held that there is a need to provide latitude for parody, laughter, and freedom of expression. The decision of the Constitutional Court of South Africa provides some important insights into the nature of trade mark dilution, the role of parody and satire, and the relevance of constitutional protections of freedom of speech and freedom of expression. Arguably, the ruling will be of help in the reformation of trade mark dilution law in other jurisdictions – such as the United States. The decision in Laugh It Off Promotions v. South African Breweries International demonstrates that trade mark law should not be immune from careful constitutional scrutiny...|$|R

The ICD- 2 trial investigated the effect of an ICD {{in the prevention of}} sudden cardiac death in dialysis patients and is the cornerstone of this thesis. Furthermore the value of CT and biochemic test to identify dialysis patients at risk for sudden cardiac death are described in the current thesis. Lastly, complications related to ICD therapy in patients with end stage renal disease were investigated. Therefore this thesis contributes valuable information for a very vulnerable patient group.
