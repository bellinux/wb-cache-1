50|$|Lowering the {{homosexual}} age of consent had last been addressed by Parliament in 1994, when the then Conservative MP Edwina Currie proposed {{an amendment to}} the Criminal Justice and Public Order Bill to lower the age of consent to sixteen years. Over forty Tories joined Mrs Currie in the aye lobby, a number which ought easily to have been sufficient to overturn the Government’s small majority at the time. In fact, the measure was lost by twenty-seven votes. It transpired that thirty-eight Labour MPs had opposed the motion. Immediately afterwards, MPs <b>agreed</b> <b>on</b> <b>division</b> (427 to 162) to reduce the age of consent for homosexual sexual activities to eighteen. The election of a Labour Government in 1997 afforded Parliament a further opportunity to examine the issue.|$|R

Imereti and Kakheti emerged as the other two Bagrationi kingdoms created out of the division.|$|R
50|$|At Madagascar {{they took}} aboard {{additional}} crew, now totaling over 100 men, and <b>agreed</b> <b>on</b> <b>division</b> of shares. Sailing to the Red Sea in August, they encountered Ralph Stout’s former ship Mocha, now under command of Culliford, alongside Dirk Chivers’ Soldados. The three captains agreed to sail together and split any prizes taken. Wheeler lent Culliford water and crewmen, plus wood {{to repair the}} Mocha. In September they located the treasure ship Great Mohammed transporting Turkish pilgrims. Chivers and Culliford attacked and looted it in what would become {{on one of the}} richest prizes ever taken by pirates. The Pelican was a slower ship, and though Wheeler fired cannons at the Great Mohammed, the others refused to share the plunder. They gave Wheeler a little money and some water and the Pelican departed.|$|R

Bradlaugh [...] "respectfully refused" [...] to obey an order of the House which was [...] "against the law." [...] The Conservative leader Sir Stafford Northcote {{successfully}} moved a motion that Bradlaugh be required to withdraw (<b>agreed</b> <b>on</b> a <b>division</b> by 326 to 38, Liberal MPs being unwilling to challenge a motion which sustained the House's legal authority) but Bradlaugh [...] "positively refused to obey." [...] The Serjeant-at-Arms was sent for and led Bradlaugh out to the Bar of the House, but Bradlaugh then immediately returned to the table claiming to take the Oath.

50|$|Conflict is not {{the only}} way that parties can {{appropriate}} resources. Depending on the risk preferences of the agents, a simple division of the contested resource according to a settlement can be envisioned. A two-stage game serves to illustrate this.

During this time of change, the brothers Gert and Fritz-Otto Lürssen <b>agree</b> <b>on</b> the <b>division</b> of shares in the company, which they hold from then on jointly with their mother Frieda Lürssen. In the postwar period Lürssen sets a new standard for fast patrol boats. They launched the Jaguar in 1959, especially developed for the German Navy. At 42 meters, the ships are larger than those built during WWII. They serve as a model for future fast patrol boat designs.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} {{an exchange}} economy in which several assets serve as stores of value and where agents have completely heterogeneous preferences and endowments. It describes {{the set of}} perfect foresight equilibria in which all assets have positive prices. There are international policies with determinate exchange rates if the world economy satisfies a strong efficiency criterion. Also, the corresponding equilibrium allocations are {{in the core of}} the world economy for certain international policies. Hence, a system of fixed exchange rates can support efficient allocations to the extent that countries <b>agree</b> <b>on</b> a <b>division</b> of seigniorage in the creation of international reserves...|$|R

50|$|At Tilsit, Napoleon and Alexander {{had agreed}} that Russia should force Sweden {{to join the}} Continental System, {{which led to a}} Russian {{invasion}} of Finland in February 1808, followed by a Danish declaration of war in March. Napoleon also sent an auxiliary corps, consisting of troops from France, Spain and the Netherlands, led by Marshal Jean-Baptiste Bernadotte, to Denmark to participate in the invasion of Sweden. But British naval superiority prevented the armies from crossing the Øresund strait, and the war came mainly to be fought along the Swedish-Norwegian border. At the Congress of Erfurt (September-October 1808), France and Russia further <b>agreed</b> <b>on</b> the <b>division</b> of Sweden into two parts separated by the Gulf of Bothnia, where the eastern part became the Russian Grand Duchy of Finland.|$|R
5000|$|In {{the late}} 19th century, Britain, France, Germany and other European states <b>agreed</b> <b>on</b> the <b>division</b> of Africa into a {{patchwork}} of colonies, and set about exploring and exploiting their new possessions. Violence was endemic to the process, for how else could the Africans already living there be persuaded to cede their land, labor, property and freedom to foreigners? Colonialism’s brutal dialectic of repression and resistance was set in motion, as Africans fought to defend their lives and, eventually, organized national political movements and underground military ones to win their rights and freedom. White Man's Country combines period photographs and contemporary location footage with the testimony of African and European witnesses, to examine both sides of Europe's [...] "civilizing mission" [...] in Africa.|$|R

40|$|We {{introduce}} {{a distinction between}} a firm and its network of workers. In a competitive world, if networks are easily lured away, the workers must receive the entire value of their contribution to the firm. How then can service firms have equity value? A model is analysed in which workers are paid less as a group than their value, even in 11 competitive world. The workers are assumed to have a nonwage benefit for working at the current firm; this benefit is privately known. These privately known benefits {{make it impossible for}} the workers to <b>agree</b> <b>on</b> a <b>division</b> of their value should they leave the existing firm for a new enterprise.

The purpose was to decide whether Germany was to be divided into several nations, and if so, what borders and inter-relationships the new German states were to have. Following Germany's surrender, the Allied Control Council, representing the United States, Britain, France, and the Soviet Union, assumed governmental authority in postwar Germany. Economic demilitarization however (especially the stripping of industrial equipment) was the responsibility of each zone individually.|$|R

The thesis consists of seven chapters, the first chapter is an introduction to this topic and the seventh chapter is a conclusion. The second chapter of my thesis is devoted mainly to the historical development of the community property since 1811 to the current legislation often called as the "new" Civil Code (no. 89 / 2012).

If the perceived guilt is strong, then the inequality-averse bargainers split the bargaining surplus equally regardless of their degree of envy. If guilt is weak, then the agreed split is tilted away from the Rubinstein division towards a more unequal split. Envy and weak guilt have opposite effects on the bargaining outcome, and envy has a greater marginal impact than weak guilt.
