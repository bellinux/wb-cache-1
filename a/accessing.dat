5|$|Footpaths and cycleways to Manchester {{city centre}} and 300cycle racks {{encourage}} healthy and green ways of <b>accessing</b> the site.|$|E
5|$|For many years, Twitter {{has limited}} {{the use of}} third party {{applications}} <b>accessing</b> the service by implementing a 100,000 user limit per application.|$|E
5|$|There {{are many}} methods of <b>accessing</b> {{messages}} on devices: directly, indirectly, and with specialized access devices. Direct access methods involve physical {{contact with the}} system, by using a keyboard or a touch screen. Users <b>accessing</b> SGDs indirectly and through specialized devices must manipulate an object in order to access the system, such as maneuvering a joystick, head mouse, optical head pointer, light pointer, infrared pointer, or switch access scanner.|$|E
5|$|<b>Accessing</b> John Glenn Columbus International Airport by road is {{possible}} by two interstate highways: I-270 {{to the northeast}} and I-670 to the west. The main airport roadway, International Gateway, connects directly to I-670.|$|E
5|$|An overworld map feature {{allows the}} player to {{directly}} access locations already visited once. The game has no saving feature but allows <b>accessing</b> various {{points of the}} storyline with a system of passwords.|$|E
5|$|In 2007 DragonFly BSD {{received}} a new device file system (devfs), which dynamically adds and removes device nodes, allows <b>accessing</b> devices by connection paths, recognises drives by serial numbers and removes {{the need for}} pre-populated /dev file system hierarchy. It was implemented as a Google Summer of Code 2009 project.|$|E
5|$|In November 2011, {{four million}} {{newspaper}} pages from the 18th and 19th centuries were made available online. The project will scan up to 40 million pages {{over the next}} 10 years. The archive is free to search, {{but there is a}} charge for <b>accessing</b> the pages themselves.|$|E
5|$|In Perl 5, {{database}} interfaces {{are implemented}} by Perl DBI modules. The DBI (Database Interface) module presents a single, database-independent interface to Perl applications, while the DBD (Database Driver) modules handle {{the details of}} <b>accessing</b> some 50 different databases; there are DBD drivers for most ANSI SQL databases.|$|E
5|$|It is {{proposed}} in the 2007 NSW State Plan that by 2017, the line capacity between Hurstville and Sutherland will be amplified to allow extra services to and from Cronulla, {{as well as for}} services <b>accessing</b> the Mortdale Maintenance Centre. The 2010 Metropolitan Transport Plan made no mention of the project.|$|E
5|$|A {{word in the}} computer's memory {{could be}} read, written, or refreshed, in 360microseconds. An {{instruction}} took four times as long to execute as <b>accessing</b> a word from memory, giving an instruction execution rate of about 700 per second. The main store was refreshed continuously, a process which took 20milliseconds to complete, as each of the SSEM's 32words had to be read and then refreshed in sequence.|$|E
5|$|After the Stuxnet attack, Kaspersky {{proposed}} that the Internet needed more regulation and policing. One idea was to have {{some parts of the}} Internet anonymous, while more secure areas require user identification. He argued that anonymity mostly benefited cybercriminals and hackers. For example, <b>accessing</b> a nuclear power plant network could require a verified identity through a digital passport.|$|E
5|$|An {{extension}} of PR30 {{begins at the}} entrance to the San Solomon Springs parking lot and proceeds to the east to the park campground. At the campground, the route ends as a circular drive <b>accessing</b> individual camping spaces and a viewing exhibit for a reconstructed desert wetland. The circular drive is bisected by another drive with bath facilities and campsites for recreational vehicles.|$|E
5|$|Approaching Harrisburg, the Pennsylvania Turnpike heads east {{through a}} mixture of rural land and {{suburban}} development. In Upper Allen Township, the highway reaches the US15 interchange <b>accessing</b> Gettysburg to the south. The road continues east into York County, where it reaches the interchange with I-83 serving Harrisburg, its western suburbs and York to the south. East of I-83 it widens to six lanes, crossing the Susquehanna River into Dauphin County on the Susquehanna River Bridge and bypassing Harrisburg to the south.|$|E
5|$|Digital: A Love Story is {{a visual}} novel, or {{interactive}} fiction game, where the game's {{story is told}} primarily through text. The game is presented {{as if on a}} computer from the late 1980s running the Amie operating system (the name and visual appearance a reference to 1.x versions of AmigaOS). The player logs into bulletin board systems, or BBSs, where they read and reply to messages from other people. Messages received from other characters in the game are displayed through a different program on the computer screen. <b>Accessing</b> a BBS requires the knowledge of the telephone number for that board, which the player must type in manually. Boards that require a long-distance telephone number to reach require the player to use illegally obtained long-distance calling card numbers found online. <b>Accessing</b> boards also requires the player to either set up a user account for that board or to know the password necessary to enter the system.|$|E
5|$|Due to {{erroneous}} use of Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) {{and other}} routing technology to redirect the {{connections to the}} filtering proxies, users of some networks were temporarily prevented from <b>accessing</b> or editing any content hosted by Wikimedia, a problem reminiscent of Pakistan's accidental blocking of YouTube {{for much of the}} world instead of only their own citizens.|$|E
5|$|Even {{though the}} fossil record of bats extends over 50 million years, their fossils are {{extremely}} rare. The fossil record of the greater noctule in the Iberian Peninsula suggests that they lived at different geographical locations from that of today. The fossils of greater noctule are almost non-existent prior to the Miocene epoch. The deterioration of the climate {{at the end of}} Neogene led to the disappearance of tropical species and vespertilionids profited by <b>accessing</b> a wider range of habitats.|$|E
5|$|Great Salt Lake Minerals Company (a {{subsidiary}} of Compass Minerals) which extracts minerals {{from the northern}} bay. The company potentially benefits from the higher salinity of the northwest arm of the lake but has had difficulties <b>accessing</b> water from the lake because of lower water level. Previous {{to the opening of}} the causeway they had had to extend their intake channels to reach the water.|$|E
5|$|Immediately {{after the}} {{disabling}} of the tablets' browsing capabilities, reports of loitering near kiosks decreased {{by more than}} 80%. By the next year, such complaints had dropped 96% from the pre-September 2016 figure. The tablets' use, as a whole, has increased 12%, with more unique users <b>accessing</b> maps, phone calls, and 3-1-1.|$|E
5|$|In Lancaster County {{the highway}} passes through Pennsylvania Dutch Country and reaches an {{interchange}} with PA72 <b>accessing</b> Lebanon {{to the north}} and Lancaster to the south. Further east, the turnpike reaches an interchange with US222 and PA272 near Denver which serves the cities of Reading and Lancaster. The route continues into Berks County and an interchange with I-176 (a freeway to Reading) and PA10 in Morgantown.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 1930s, {{a decade before}} the tunnel was {{actually}} constructed, a rumor circulated that such a passageway already existed connecting the White House to the Treasury Building. According to one account, the rumor started as a joke among journalists covering the White House, but gained serious traction, with some accounts even suggesting that Ogden L. Mills was secretly <b>accessing</b> the White House via the purported passage to meet with President Herbert Hoover.|$|E
5|$|NY30 {{runs through}} the Adirondacks, <b>accessing</b> {{communities}} such as Speculator, Blue Mountain Lake, and Tupper Lake as a scenic byway named the Adirondack Trail. From Wells to Speculator, NY30 is concurrent to NY8, then with NY28 from Indian Lake to Blue Mountain Lake. Between Blue Mountain Lake and Long Lake, NY30 is concurrent with the western third of NY28N.|$|E
5|$|On July 13, 2004, PHP 5 was released, {{powered by}} the new Zend Engine II. PHP 5 {{included}} new features such as improved support for object-oriented programming, the PHP Data Objects (PDO) extension (which defines a lightweight and consistent interface for <b>accessing</b> databases), and numerous performance enhancements. In 2008 PHP 5 became the only stable version under development. Late static binding had been missing from PHP and was added in version 5.3.|$|E
5|$|On October 10, Samutsevich's new lawyer, Irina Khrunova, {{argued that}} her client had {{not in fact}} {{committed}} the acts of hooliganism in the church as she was prevented from <b>accessing</b> the soleas by church security. The court appeared to accept this argument, and released Samutsevich on two years' probation. However, the judges rejected the appeals of Tolokonnikova and Alyokhina, upholding their convictions and sentences.|$|E
5|$|Scheduled castes and tribes form 28.6% and 5.8% of the population, respectively, {{in rural}} areas, and 19.9% and 1.5%, respectively, in urban areas. A study {{conducted}} in three districts of West Bengal found that <b>accessing</b> private health services to treat illness had a catastrophic impact on households. This indicates {{the importance of}} public provision of health services to mitigate against poverty {{and the impact of}} illness on poor households.|$|E
5|$|Super Mario Bros. 3 {{includes}} a multiplayer option which allows two players to cooperatively {{play the game}} by taking turns at navigating the overworld map and <b>accessing</b> stage levels; the first player controls Mario, while the other controls Luigi (a palette swap of Mario). Through this mode, players can access several mini-games, including a remake of the original Mario Bros. arcade game, in which one player {{has the opportunity to}} steal the cards of another but may lose their turn if they lose the mini-game.|$|E
5|$|TfL {{has also}} {{suggested}} {{there may be}} potential for the turnback siding adjacent to Milkwood Road to be converted for passenger use. This would require substantial changes to the station {{as there is no}} direct access to the platforms from Milkwood Road and the current subway for <b>accessing</b> the platforms does not extend east of the southbound platform.|$|E
5|$|The Government of Finland held {{a crisis}} meeting, and {{declared}} a national day of mourning for September 24, with ministers agreeing that Finland's laws pertaining to gun ownership should be reviewed. Suggestions included introducing legislation to aid {{police officers in}} <b>accessing</b> information about the {{mental and physical health}} of applicants for firearms licenses, and the right to request further information if the applicant had a history of using medication. The question whether or not private persons should be allowed to own handguns was also raised.|$|E
5|$|The Xbox SmartGlass app {{provides}} {{extended functionality}} on Xbox One, allowing devices running Windows Phone, Windows 8, iOS and Android {{to be used}} as a companion device for Xbox One features, such as powering on the console, a remote control, <b>accessing</b> messages and the Activity Feed, purchasing content, and providing integration with certain games and content. The SmartGlass app can also be used to stream live television to Android and Windows devices if the console is using a USB digital television tuner.|$|E
5|$|The {{enterprise}} {{version of}} Windows 10 offers additional security features; administrators {{can set up}} policies for the automatic encryption of sensitive data, selectively block applications from <b>accessing</b> encrypted data, and enable Device Guarda system which allows administrators to enforce a high security environment by blocking the execution of software that is not digitally signed by a trusted vendor or Microsoft. Device Guard is designed to protect against zero-day exploits, and runs inside a hypervisor so that its operation remains separated from the operating system itself.|$|E
5|$|The game {{is played}} from a 2.5D, third-person {{perspective}} replicating the aesthetic of the television series. The New Kid is able to freely explore {{to the town of}} South Park, interacting with characters and undertaking quests, and <b>accessing</b> new areas by progressing through the main story. Selecting one of four character archetypes, Fighter, Thief, Mage, and Jew, each offering specific abilities, the New Kid and a supporting party of characters use a variety of melee, ranged, and magical fart attacks to combat with their enemies.|$|E
5|$|The {{media has}} {{historically}} come under {{varying degrees of}} pressure over time to censor their criticism of the government. Reporters are occasionally threatened or harassed and media outlets are periodically forced to close. Accusations of media censorship have increased since 2009 due to the alleged intensification of restrictions on political criticism. Access to the internet has grown dramatically over the past decade, with an estimated 352,000 residents of Madagascar <b>accessing</b> the internet from home or {{in one of the}} nation's many internet cafés in December 2011.|$|E
5|$|The {{registration}} for, and issuing of, National identity cards, {{a legally}} required document for <b>accessing</b> various services, to these remote tribes has been problematic for many years, {{and in the}} past had even resulted in {{a large number of people}} from the Penan ethnic group being rendered effectively stateless. In recent years, this issue has seen progressive improvement with the implementation of systems such as mobile registration units.|$|E
5|$|There are {{multiple}} methods of <b>accessing</b> messages on devices: directly or indirectly, or using specialized access devices—although the specific access method {{will depend on}} the skills and abilities of the user. SGD output is typically much slower than speech, although rate enhancement strategies can increase the user's rate of output, resulting in enhanced efficiency of communication.|$|E
5|$|Though {{the role}} {{is subject to}} many stereotypes, and men may have {{difficulties}} <b>accessing</b> parenting benefits, communities, and services targeted at mothers, it became more socially acceptable by the 2000s. The stay-at-home dad was more regularly portrayed in the media by the 2000s, especially in the United States. However, due to traditional family structures and stereotypic expectations, the stay at home father figure is culturally unacceptable in countries in South Asia such as India.|$|E
5|$|What the {{transfer}} really did was {{ensure that the}} files would {{be placed in the}} CIA's operational records, a records system that—due to the 1986 CIA Operational Files exemption—is not subject to the FOIA and is a black hole for anyone trying to access the files within. The move prevents the public from <b>accessing</b> the official record about the raid, and bypasses several important federal records keeping procedures in the process.|$|E
5|$|When <b>accessing</b> a {{previously}} visited region, the player {{appears in the}} location of their last visit. Upon acquiring items called seals, the player can revert regions to their previous statuses to play through them again; regions can be unsealed again at any time. Unlike in the predecessor, the game is automatically saved when players enter the Historia Crux, {{as well as at}} key moments in the plot. The player may also manually save at any time. Instead of <b>accessing</b> stores at save points like in XIII, the player can purchase items from a character named Chocolina, who is found throughout the game. An in-game data log provides a bestiary and incidental information about the world of Final Fantasy XIII-2. When talking to characters, the game sometimes begins the Live Trigger system, in which the player chooses their response from several options; these dialogue options are generally not repeatable. The game also occasionally features temporal rifts, in which the player must complete a puzzle to close the rift and continue the game.|$|E
