5|$|The {{idea of a}} {{national}} assembly of theologians to advise Parliament on further church reforms was first presented to the House of Commons in 1641.

Charles responded on 23December that the church required no reforms. Undeterred, Parliament passed three bills in 1642 appointing <b>an</b> <b>assembly</b> and stipulating that its members would be chosen by Parliament. Charles, whose royal assent was required for the bills to become law, was only willing to consider such <b>an</b> <b>assembly</b> if the members were chosen by the clergy.
