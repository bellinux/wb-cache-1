5|$|During {{the debate}} on the bill, New York's Francis B. Cutting demanded that Breckinridge retract or explain a {{statement}} he had made, which Breckinridge understood <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>challenge</b> to duel. Under the code duello, the challenged party selected the weapons and the distance between combatants; Breckinridge chose rifles at 60 paces and suggested the duel be held in Silver Spring, Maryland, on his friend, Francis Preston Blair's estate. Cutting had not meant his remark <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>challenge,</b> but insisted that he was now challenged and selected pistols at 10 paces. While their representatives tried to clarify matters, Breckinridge and Cutting made amends, averting the duel. Had it taken place, Breckinridge could have been removed from the House; the 1850 Kentucky Constitution prevented duelists from holding office.|$|E
5|$|An ally of Illinois' Stephen A. Douglas, Breckinridge {{supported}} {{the doctrine of}} popular sovereignty as expressed in Douglas's Kansas–Nebraska Act. He believed passage of the act would remove the issue of slavery from national politics – although it ultimately had the opposite effect – and acted as a liaison between Douglas and Pierce to secure its passage. During {{the debate on the}} House floor, New York's Francis B. Cutting, incensed by a statement that Breckinridge had made, demanded that he explain or retract it. Breckinridge interpreted Cutting's demand <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>challenge</b> to duel. Under code duello, the individual being challenged retained the right to name the weapons used and the distance between the combatants; Breckinridge chose rifles at 60 paces. He also specified that the duel should be held at Silver Spring, Maryland, the home of his friend Francis Preston Blair. Cutting, who had not intended his initial remark <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>challenge,</b> believed that Breckinridge's naming of terms constituted a challenge; he chose to use pistols at a distance of 10 paces. While the two men attempted to clarify who had issued the challenge and who reserved the right to choose the terms, mutual friends resolved the issue, preventing the duel. The recently adopted Kentucky Constitution prevented anyone who participated in a duel from holding elected office, and the peaceful resolution of the issue may have saved Breckinridge's political career.|$|E
5|$|By the 1970s Atheis {{had become}} part of the Indonesian junior and senior high school curriculum. In 1974 Sjumandjaja adapted the novel into a film with the same title. The film, shot on a Rp. 80 million (US$193,771) budget, mimicked the novel's {{non-linear}} plot. Intended <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>challenge</b> to Indonesia's religious communities, upon its release faced with controversy. Ultimately, the Indonesian censorship bureau passed the film after several cuts. Though it was a commercial failure, Sjumandjaja's Atheis was well received by critics.|$|E

5|$|Ecgric's successor, Anna, acted <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>challenge</b> to the {{increasing}} power of Penda throughout his reign. In 645, after Cenwalh of Wessex had renounced his wife, who was Penda's sister, Penda drove him from his kingdom and into exile. Anna {{was strong enough to}} offer protection to Cenwalh when he sought refuge at the East Anglian court: whilst there he was converted to Christianity, returning in 648 to rule Wessex as a Christian king. Anna probably provided military support for Cenwalh's return to his throne.|$|E
5|$|In Europe, {{the teachings}} of Galen {{continued}} to dominate the academic community and his doctrines were adopted as the official canon of the Church. Andreas Vesalius questioned some of Galen's beliefs of the heart in De humani corporis fabrica (1543), but his magnum opus was interpreted <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>challenge</b> to the authorities and he was subjected {{to a number of}} attacks. Michael Servetus wrote in Christianismi Restitutio (1553) that blood flows {{from one side of the}} heart to the other via the lungs.|$|E
5|$|On November 19, the British {{flotilla}} was captured, but Carleton narrowly escaped {{and made}} his way to Quebec City. Montgomery's kind treatment toward the captured British prisoners caused several officers to express their concern. Montgomery saw this <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>challenge</b> to his authority and this, along with the lack of discipline in the army, caused Montgomery to threaten resignation. Letters from Washington in which Washington also expressed his troubles with the discipline of troops convinced Montgomery to continue his command.|$|E

5|$|Too Much Too Soon is the 1974 second studio album by the American {{hard rock}} band New York Dolls. The group was {{dissatisfied}} with the recording of their 1973 self-titled debut album, leading the band's frontman David Johansen to enlist veteran producer Shadow Morton for Too Much Too Soon. Morton had become disenchanted by the music industry, but felt motivated by the band's energy and agreed {{to work with them}} <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>challenge.</b> They recorded the album the following year at A Studios in New York City.|$|E
5|$|A {{meeting of}} the {{parliamentary}} party was held on 15 September at which {{the issue of the}} presidential election was raised. Unexpectedly, one of the party's senators, Labhrás Ó Murchú, sought nominations to run as an independent candidate. This was widely seen <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>challenge</b> to the authority of Micheál Martin. The extended meeting broke up without agreement. The parliamentary party met again on 20 September. Senator Ó Murchú withdrew his request for a nomination and a motion was passed that the party's Oireachtas members would not nominate or endorse any candidate. The decision was seen as a severe blow to the attempts to secure a nomination by David Norris and Dana Rosemary Scallon who were expected to need signatures from individual Fianna Fáil members.|$|E
5|$|Cantor's {{theory of}} transfinite numbers was {{originally}} regarded as so counter-intuitive – even shocking – that it encountered resistance from mathematical contemporaries such as Leopold Kronecker and Henri Poincaré and later from Hermann Weyl and L. E. J. Brouwer, while Ludwig Wittgenstein raised philosophical objections. Cantor, a devout Lutheran, believed the theory had been communicated {{to him by}} God. Some Christian theologians (particularly neo-Scholastics) saw Cantor's work <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>challenge</b> to {{the uniqueness of the}} absolute infinity in the nature of God – on one occasion equating the theory of transfinite numbers with pantheism – a proposition that Cantor vigorously rejected.|$|E

5|$|His father distrusted or {{was jealous}} of George's popularity, which contributed to the {{development}} of a poor relationship between them. The birth in 1717 of George's second son, Prince George William, proved to be a catalyst for a family quarrel; the king, supposedly following custom, appointed the Lord Chamberlain, the Duke of Newcastle, as one of the baptismal sponsors of the child. The king was angered when George, who disliked Newcastle, verbally insulted the duke at the christening, which the duke misunderstood <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>challenge</b> to a duel. George and Caroline were temporarily confined to their apartments on the order of the king, who subsequently banished his son from St James's Palace, the king's residence. The Prince and Princess of Wales left court, but their children remained in the care of the king.|$|E
5|$|In 1888 the Havana Chess Club {{offered to}} sponsor a match between Steinitz and whomever he would select as a worthy opponent. Steinitz {{nominated}} the Russian Mikhail Chigorin, {{on the condition}} that the invitation should not be presented <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>challenge</b> from him. There is some doubt about whether this was intended to be a match for the world championship: both Steinitz's letters and the publicity material just before the match conspicuously avoided the phrase. The proposed match was to have a maximum of 20 games, and Steinitz had said that fixed-length matches were unsuitable for world championship contests because the first player to take the lead could then play for draws; and Steinitz was at the same time supporting the American Chess Congress' world championship project. Whatever the status of the match, it was played in Havana in January to February 1889, and won by Steinitz (ten wins, one draw, six losses).|$|E
5|$|The European Super Cup {{was founded}} in the early 1970s, {{as a means to}} {{determine}} the best team in Europe and serve <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>challenge</b> to Ajax, the strongest club side of its day. The proposal by Dutch journalist Anton Witkamp, a football match between the holders of the European Cup and Cup Winners' Cup, failed to receive UEFA's backing, given the recent Cup Winners' Cup winners Rangers had been banned from European competition. Witkamp nonetheless proceeded with his vision, a two-legged match played between Ajax and Rangers in January 1973. The competition was endorsed and recognised by UEFA a year later.|$|E

Soviet ambassador to the United Nations Yakov Malik had been personally ordered not to attend the UNSC meetings by Soviet premier Joseph Stalin.

5|$|The second theme Garner {{identified}} was {{the divide}} between ideal and nonideal theory, which he understands as a way political theory {{may be used to}} contextualise animal ethics and further the debate. Ultimately, for Garner, Cochrane's theory serves <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>challenge</b> to abolitionism, which, Garner fears, both polarises the debate and is unrealistic. The themes of this review were built upon in Garner's 2013 book A Theory of Justice for Animals. In the course of his review of the book, Garner looked forward to the release of Cochrane's second book, Animal Rights Without Liberation, which offers a lengthier defence of the interest-based rights theory.|$|E
5|$|The {{stories of}} Cú Chulainn's {{childhood}} are told in a flashback sequence in Táin Bó Cúailnge.

However, he sets off on his own, and when he arrives at Emain he runs onto the playing field without first asking for the boys' protection, being unaware of the custom. The boys take this <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>challenge</b> and attack him, but he has a ríastrad and beats them single-handed. Conchobar puts a stop to the fight and clears up the misunderstanding, but no sooner has Sétanta put himself under the boys' protection than he chases after them, demanding they put themselves under his protection.|$|E

5|$|After his {{accession}} in Great Britain, George's {{relationship with}} his son (which had always been poor) worsened. George Augustus, Prince of Wales, encouraged opposition to his father's policies, including measures designed to increase religious freedom in Britain and expand Hanover's German territories {{at the expense of}} Sweden. In 1717 the birth of a grandson led to a major quarrel between George and the Prince of Wales. The King, supposedly following custom, appointed the Lord Chamberlain, the Duke of Newcastle, as one of the baptismal sponsors of the child. The King was angered when the Prince of Wales, disliking Newcastle, verbally insulted the Duke at the christening, which the Duke misunderstood <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>challenge</b> to a duel. The Prince was told to leave the royal residence, St. James's Palace. The Prince's new home, Leicester House, became a meeting place for the King's political opponents. George and his son were later reconciled at the insistence of Robert Walpole and the desire of the Princess of Wales, who had moved out with her husband but missed her children who had been left in the care of the King. However, following the quarrel at the baptism, father and son would never again be on cordial terms.|$|E
5|$|Arkane were {{influenced}} by some criticisms of the first Dishonored. Although the difficulty was not considered a major problem, a sizeable number of players had complained the first was too easy, and thus the harder difficulty settings were reworked. The chaos system of Dishonored, considered as merely a binary ersatz meter, was intended more depth in the sequel. The altered chaos system, where different individuals grant varying amounts of chaos, was implemented due to how many players used the Heart in the original game. As the Heart would reveal secrets about whomever it was pointed at, players would use it to decide which NPCs to kill and which to leave be or spare. Also intended to yield additional improvements was the upgrade system, which would {{for the first time}} level up based on a skill tree. Bonecharms were made into craftable items, with 400,000 possible combinations available. While taking into account the intricacies of how supernatural abilities would be used, designers faced increased difficulty in relation to the play-style where the game is traversed in their absence, noting the accommodation of the play-style {{in a way that would}} not cancel out the other <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>challenge.</b>|$|E
