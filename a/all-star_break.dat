5|$|Young {{entered the}} <b>All-Star</b> <b>break</b> {{with the major}} league lead in ERA and {{opponent}} batting average {{as well as an}} undefeated streak extending back to a May 12 loss to the Cardinals. Prior to the announcement of his election, Young dropped his appeal of the five-game suspension. Young served his suspension during the final four games before the <b>All-Star</b> <b>break</b> and the first game afterwards, yet was allowed to play in the All-Star Game at AT Park in San Francisco, California. In the fifth inning of the 5–4 American League victory for which Young was the losing pitcher, he surrendered the first inside-the-park home run in All-Star game history to Ichiro Suzuki.|$|E
5|$|Nova {{struggled}} at {{the beginning}} of the 2012 season, recording a 5.60 ERA through May, but decreased it to 3.92 by the <b>All-Star</b> <b>break.</b> During an interleague game against the Atlanta Braves on June 11, 2012, Nova got his first career base hit off of Randall Delgado in a 3–0 win. Nova was not very effective after the <b>All-Star</b> <b>break,</b> pitching to a 2–5 record with a 6.40 ERA in 10 starts, and was placed on the 15-day disabled list due to rotator cuff inflammation. Due to his struggles late in the season, the Yankees decided to demote Nova to the bullpen for the postseason roster until the team lost in the 2012 ALCS to the Detroit Tigers. Despite his 5.02 ERA, he still finished the 2012 season with a record of 12–8 in 28 starts.|$|E

The home run was also his 500th career hit.|$|E
5|$|The {{coach for}} the Eastern Conference team was Cleveland Cavaliers head coach Mike Brown. This {{was the first time}} Brown was {{selected}} to be an All-Star coach. He became only the second Cavaliers coach to lead an All-Star team, after Lenny Wilkens in 1989. The Cavaliers entered the <b>All-Star</b> <b>break</b> with 40–11 record, the second best winning percentage in the Eastern Conference, behind Doc Rivers' Boston Celtics.|$|E
5|$|The {{coach for}} the Western Conference team was Los Angeles Lakers head coach Phil Jackson.

5|$|Pineda was {{selected}} to the All-Star Game on July 10 {{as a replacement for}} Justin Verlander, who was ineligible to pitch in the All-Star Game due to having pitched the day before the <b>All-Star</b> <b>break.</b> He was 8–6 at that point, but with a 3.03 ERA and 113 strikeouts in 113 innings, against only 36 walks. In the All-Star Game, Pineda pitched one perfect inning, striking out Scott Rolen and Rickie Weeks.|$|E
50|$|With nagging back spasms keeping Fernandez from play {{shortly after}} the <b>All-Star</b> Game <b>break,</b> Rask was once again called up {{to serve as a}} second goaltender, and on 31 January 2009, he played his first (and only) game with the Bruins in the 2008-09 season, and earned his first ever NHL shutout, a 1-0 home effort against the New York Rangers, with Marc Savard scoring the only Bruins goal.|$|R

5|$|The {{competitiveness}} {{of the teams}} continued the following year. Co-captains Ron Guidry and Willie Randolph had led the Yankees to first place {{two weeks after the}} <b>All-Star</b> <b>break</b> started. On July 28, the Yankees fell out of first place, and the Red Sox won their second division title in three years.

5|$|In {{the late}} 1970s, dance-oriented disco music was {{very popular in}} the United States, {{particularly}} after being featured in hit films such as Saturday Night Fever (1977). Despite its popularity, disco sparked a backlash from rock music fans. This opposition was prominent enough that the White Sox, seeking to fill seats at Comiskey Park during a lackluster season, engaged Chicago shock jock and anti-disco campaigner Steve Dahl for the promotion at the July12 doubleheader, the Thursday preceding the <b>All-Star</b> <b>break.</b> Dahl's sponsoring radio station was 97.9 WLUP-FM, so attendees would pay 98 cents and bring a disco record; between games, Dahl would destroy the collected vinyl in an explosion.|$|E
5|$|Oates {{signed a}} four-year, $3 million {{contract}} extension with the Blues {{prior to the}} 1991–92 NHL season, but after the team signed Brendan Shanahan, Garth Butcher and Ron Sutter to significant deals, felt he was underpaid. After playing in his second career All-Star Game, he threatened to walk off the team following the <b>all-star</b> <b>break</b> if the Blues did not renegotiate his contract, prompting a negative reaction from St. Louis fans who booed him loudly. The conflict was resolved on February 7, 1992, when the team dealt him to the Boston Bruins in exchange for Craig Janney and Stéphane Quintal.|$|E
50|$|Stone {{appeared}} {{in most of}} the Senators' games during the 2015-16 season, amassing 61 points across 75 games. Stone lead the league in takeaways for the second straight season {{and was one of the}} best-performing players after the <b>All-Star</b> Game <b>break.</b> On a 30 March game against the Winnipeg Jets, Dustin Byfuglien delivered a devastating bodycheck to Stone that forced Stone to immediately leave the ice for concussion tests. Though Stone returned to the ice later that game, he would not appear in the remaining games of the season.|$|R
50|$|Triandos had {{his best}} year in 1958, {{when he hit}} 16 home runs by mid-season to earn the {{starting}} catcher's role for the American League in the 1958 <b>All-Star</b> Game, <b>breaking</b> Yogi Berra's eight-year stranglehold on the position. He ended the season leading all American League catchers in putouts with 698, and tied Berra's American League record of 30 home runs by a catcher. In 1959, he hit 20 home runs by mid-season and was again selected to be the starting catcher for the American League in the 1959 All-Star Game, However, a hand injury meant that he only had 25 home runs for the entire season.|$|R

5|$|By September 10, the {{prospect}} of securing a Baton Rouge location to host the Hornets was fading {{as a result of}} the facilities being utilized for hurricane related relief operations. Numerous cities inquired about hosting the franchise for the season, including Kansas City, Louisville, Nashville, Oklahoma City and San Diego. During this period, Oklahoma City announced that it was the favored choice to serve as the temporary home of the franchise, although by mid-September SMG announced that the New Orleans arena could potentially be ready for occupancy by the <b>All-Star</b> Game <b>break.</b> However, by late September the Hornets finalized a move to Oklahoma City, where 35 games would be played at the Ford Center, as well as six in Baton Rouge at the Pete Maravich Assembly Center. Additionally, it was announced that three of the games in March could be moved to New Orleans if the arena repairs were complete. At the same time, the NBA also announced the team would be referred to officially as the New Orleans/Oklahoma City Hornets, and that the deal reached with Oklahoma City would allow for the team to return for the 2006–07 season, if necessary.|$|R

5|$|Burrell hit a leadoff walk-off {{home run}} on April 7, 2002, in the 11th inning of a 3–2 {{victory over the}} Florida Marlins. Three days later, on April 10, Burrell hit a two-run walk-off {{home run in the}} 11th inning to give the Phillies a 7–5 victory over the Braves. He was the first player in the major leagues to hit two such home runs in a four-day period since Albert Belle did it in 1995, and he was the first Phillie to hit two such in a season since Von Hayes hit two in 1989.

50|$|In recent years, {{the free}} preview concept has been {{restructured}} {{due to the}} migration of premium cable services to digital programming tiers to which subscribers have upgraded to such packages. With digital cable having become commonplace since the early 2000s, most cable and satellite providers have since eschewed using local origination channels to carry free preview events and no longer produce interstitials for events involving premium channels; instead, providers simply unencrypt the service's signal on the designated channel slots of the main channel and all related multiplex channels that are carried by the provider {{as well as in}} some cases, a related pay service (for example, in the United States, HBO offers free previews either involving only its eight-channel multiplex, or both the HBO channel slate and the seven-channel multiplex of its sister network Cinemax, depending on which service is offered during that given preview - both networks are owned by Time Warner) during the period. Some video-on-demand services, pay-per-view sports packages and select basic channels available on higher subscription tiers also occasionally offer free previews, sometimes for as long as one to two weeks. In the case of out-of-market sports packages, previews for those services are most commonly held {{during the first week of}} a professional or collegiate sports league's regular season, with a second free preview window often occurring shortly after a professional league's <b>All-star</b> game <b>break</b> where the price of the package is halved in the wind-up towards the latter half of the season for playoff positioning.|$|R
50|$|The Islanders put {{together}} a 6-3-0 January record to bring into the <b>All-Star</b> Game <b>break.</b> Near {{the beginning of the}} month, Lubomir Visnovsky was placed back on IR with an upper body injury and would later be joined by Eric Boulton with a lower-body injury, who had been taken off the list about a month prior on December 11 and only played once since. Michael Grabner returned from his lower body injury on January 6 after missing eight games. On January 10, John Tavares was named to the All-Star Game as the sole representative of the Islanders. After injuries to goaltenders Jimmy Howard of the Detroit Red Wings and Pekka Rinne of the Nashville Predators, Halak and the Pittsburgh Penguins' Marc-Andre Fleury were named as their replacements. At the All-Star Game, Tavares scored four goals, matching an All-Star Game record for an individual player's goals scored, while Halak stopped six of tens shots in the third period; their team, captained by Jonathan Toews of the Chicago Blackhawks, won the game by a record-setting score of 17-12. After the break, it was announced that alternate captain Kyle Okposo would miss six-to-eight weeks after receiving an upper-body injury, later revealed to be a detached retina that he had recently received surgery for. The injury led to Cal Clutterbuck being named as an alternate captain. In their first game back from the break, the Islanders defeated the rival New York Rangers, earning their third consecutive victory over the team, all by a gap of three goals; this marked the first time the Islanders won three consecutive games against the Rangers since 2007.|$|R
