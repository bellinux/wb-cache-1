She was re-designated and re-authorized as an aircraft carrier on 1 July 1922. Her displacement was reduced {{by a total of}} , achieved mainly by the elimination of her main armament of eight 16-inch (406mm) guns in four twin turrets (including their heavy turret mounts, their armor, and other equipment). The main armor belt was retained, but was reduced in height to save weight. The general line of the hull remained unaltered, as did the torpedo protection system, because they had already been built, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> too expensive to alter them.|$|E
5|$|In 1995, {{the site}} was {{considered}} for scheduling by English Heritage, because of its national importance as {{a good example of}} a late 20th-century power station. It was also important because of its use as a testing ground for various generating sizes, from which came success in the UK's electricity industry. However, by then the station's buildings were in poor condition <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> financially difficult to ensure their long term preservation. Instead, it was decided a comprehensive study and photographic record of the station would be commissioned.|$|E

She was ordered to be converted to an aircraft carrier with the hull number CV-3 on 1 July 1922. Her displacement was reduced {{by a total of}} , achieved mainly by the elimination of her main armament of eight 16-inch (406mm) guns in four twin gun turrets (including their heavy barbettes, armor, and other equipment).

5|$|In {{a desperate}} attempt to prevent armed battle and to avert the {{resulting}} political crisis, U.S. President Andrew Jackson consulted his Attorney General, Benjamin Butler, for his legal opinion on the border dispute. At the time, Ohio was a growing political power in the Union, with nineteen U.S. representatives and two senators. In contrast, Michigan, still being a territory, had only a single non-voting delegate. Ohio was a crucial swing state in presidential elections, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> devastating to the fledgling Democratic Party to lose Ohio's electoral votes. Therefore, Jackson calculated that his party's best interest would be served by keeping the Toledo Strip a part of Ohio.|$|E
5|$|Boniface and his {{elder brother}} Amadeus IV, Count of Savoy, were sons of Thomas I, Count of Savoy, and Margaret of Geneva. He is thus {{not to be}} {{confused}} with his nephew, and fellow member of the House of Savoy, Count Boniface of Savoy, the son of Amadeus IV. The elder Boniface was born about 1207 in Savoy. He was the eleventh child of his parents. Some sources state that at a young age he joined the Carthusian Order. However, there is no evidence of this, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> very unusual for a nobleman to enter that order with its very strict discipline. He also had a brother Peter of Savoy who was named Earl of Richmond in 1240 and yet another brother William of Savoy, who was Bishop of Valence and a candidate to be Bishop of Winchester in England.|$|E
5|$|By early 1645 the war {{had turned}} decisively against the King, and in February, Parliamentary forces seized the county town of Shrewsbury. This exposed {{the rest of the}} region to attack, and in June a force of 800 Parliamentary {{soldiers}} pushed south towards Ludlow, attacking Stokesay en route. The Royalist garrison, led by Captain Daurett, was heavily outnumbered <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> impossible for them to effectively defend the new gatehouse, which was essentially ornamental. Nonetheless, both sides complied with the protocols of warfare at the time, resulting in a bloodless victory for the Parliamentary force: the besiegers demanded that the garrison surrender, the garrison refused, the attackers demanded a surrender for a second time, and this time the garrison were able to give up the castle with dignity.|$|E

25|$|This {{parking orbit}} was quite low by Earth orbit standards, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> {{short-lived}} due to aerodynamic drag. This {{was not a}} problem on a lunar mission because of the short stay in the parking orbit. The S-IVB also continued to thrust at a low level by venting gaseous hydrogen, to keep propellants settled in their tanks and prevent gaseous cavities from forming in propellant feed lines. This venting also maintained safe pressures as liquid hydrogen boiled off in the fuel tank. This venting thrust easily exceeded aerodynamic drag.|$|E
25|$|A {{possible}} {{sequence of}} events in prehistory involves considering the structure of copper ore deposits, which are mostly sulphides. The surface minerals would contain some native copper and oxidised minerals, {{but much of the}} copper and other minerals would have been washed further into the ore body forming a secondary enrichment zone. This includes many minerals such as tennantite, with their arsenic, copper and iron. So the surface deposits would be used first, and with some work deeper sulphidic ores would have been uncovered and worked, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> discovered that the material from this level had better properties.|$|E

Many of the dead were Jewish and some were refugees from the Nazis.|$|E
25|$|Qazi Muhammad's {{internal}} support eventually declined, {{especially among the}} Kurdish tribes who had supported him initially. Their crops and supplies were dwindling, and {{their way of life}} was becoming hard {{as a result of the}} isolation. Economic aid and military assistance from the Soviet Union was gone, and the tribes saw no reason to support him. The townspeople and the tribes had a large divide between them, and their alliance for Mahabad was crumbling. The tribes and their leaders had only supported Qazi Muhammad for his economic and military aid from the Soviet Union. Once that was gone, many did not see any reason to support him. Other tribes resented the Barzanis, since they did not like sharing their already dwindling resources with them. Some Kurds deserted Mahabad, including one of Mahabad's own marshals, Amir Khan. Mahabad was economically bankrupt, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> nearly impossible for Mahabad to have been economically sound without harmony with Iran.|$|E
25|$|Michael Wacha almost throws no-hitter. Rookie Michael Wacha (22), {{acquired}} in the 2012 draft with the 19th overall pick from the Los Angeles Angels as compensation for losing Albert Pujols almost threw a no-hitter at home on September 24, against the Washington Nationals. He pitched 8.2 innings and 112 pitches (77 for strikes) with no hits, two walks, and one error against him before a little squibbler in the infield became the only hit against him. He struck out nine. He was then relieved on the final out for his fourth win of the season. He has pitched only 64.2 innings in the majors in 2013. He became the third pitcher to lose a no-hitter with two outs in the ninth this year, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> the 11th no-hitter in Cardinals' history, with the last one in September 2001 by Bud Smith, who coincidentally wore uniform 52, same as Wacha. The 1-hitter was the second in 2013 for a Cardinals' pitcher: Shelby Miller gave up a hit to the first batter, and then retired the next 27 on May 10.|$|E

Jack Hallam opened the scoring from a Tommy Hands cross with the first League goal of the season, [...] "for the match was started punctually, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> a sheer impossibility to score faster than the Small Heath player did." [...] Villa equalised some 20minutes later, took the lead immediately afterwards, and retained {{that lead to the}} end. The Birmingham Daily Post picked out Hallam and Caesar Jenkyns for praise, was disappointed by Fred Wheldon, [...] "usually the bright particular star of the front rank", and suggested that Jack Oliver would be a success [...] "when he has lost a little superfluous flesh".|$|E

[...] "He wanted something that was very different, very distinctive, that immediately evoked the movie when people heard it," [...] Howard explained. Howard and Shyamalan chose to simplify the score, and minimized the number of instruments (strings, trumpets and piano), with limited orchestrations. Some compositions were recorded in a converted church in London. [...] "You could have recorded the same music in a studio in Los Angeles, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> great, {{but there is something}} about the sound of that church studio," [...] Howard remarked.
