The dose of Fenton's reagent was as follows: Fe 2 + = 1 g. L- 1, Fe 2 +/H 2 O 2 = 1 : 100; stabilisation lasted for 2 h. Dose of CaO was equal to 1 g CaO. g d. m. - 1 Total concentration of all metals in the digested sewage sludge was higher than in the soil. Chemical <b>stabilisation</b> <b>of</b> <b>sludge</b> with Fenton's reagent increased total metal content in the sludge as a result of total solids removal. Opposite effect was stated when the sludge was mixed with CaO. Also chemical fractions of heavy metals were identified (exchangeable, carbonate bound, iron oxides bound, organic and residual).

40|$|PCR and PCR-DGGE {{techniques}} {{have been evaluated}} to monitor biodiversity indexes within an ATAD (autothermal thermophilic aerobic digestion) system treating domestic sludge for land spread, by examining microbial dynamics in response to elevated temperatures during treatment. The ATAD process utilises a thermophilic population to generate heat and operates at elevated pH due to degradation <b>of</b> <b>sludge</b> solids, thus allowing pasteurisation and <b>stabilisation</b> <b>of</b> the <b>sludge.</b> Genera-specific PCR revealed that Archaea, Eukarya and Fungi decline when the temperature reaches 59 ∘C, while the bacterial lineage constitutes the dominant group at this stage. The bacterial community at the thermophilic stage, its similarity index to the feed material, and the species richness present were evaluated by PCR-DGGE. Parameters such as choice of molecular target (16 S rDNA or rpoB genes), and electrophoresis condition, were optimised to maximise {{the resolution of the}} method for ATAD. Dynamic analysis of microbial communities was best observed utilising PCR-DGGE analysis of the V 6 -V 8 region of 16 S rDNA, while rpoB gene profiles were less informative. Unique thermophilic communities were shown to quickly adapt to process changes, and shown to be quite stable during the process. Such techniques may be used as a monitoring technique for process health and efficiency. PUBLISHEDpeer-reviewe...|$|R

Samples were taken in the sludge residues along the entire profiles, in order to compare the effectiveness <b>of</b> the <b>sludge</b> <b>stabilisation</b> process in the three systems. Particular attention {{was given to the}} stabilisation process occurring within the reed beds; in fact, parameters correlated to biochemical properties <b>of</b> organic <b>sludge</b> matter have been determined. Statistical procedures were used to evaluate how the biochemical processes influence the quality <b>of</b> <b>sludge</b> organic matter in the three systems. The level of total organic carbon and total nitrogen had a similar trend along the profile: their concentration decreased with increasing depth, reaching very low levels at the deepest layers. The same trend was also observed for the water soluble carbon, N-NH 3, b-glucosidase and urease activities, hydrolytic enzymes linked to C and N cycles, respectively: their values decreased dramatically with increasing depth, meaning that the level of mineralisation of the organic matter was higher in the deepest layers. The determination of extracellular enzymes bound to humic substances and humic carbon permitted to evaluate the <b>stabilisation</b> <b>of</b> organic <b>sludge</b> matter, and also allowed to individuate in which ways the sludge was stabilised, in terms of mineralisation and humification of the organic matter...|$|R
40|$|In Germany sewage {{treatment}} plants with serving sizes from 5, 000 to 40, 000 PE are usually designed with simultaneous <b>aerobic</b> <b>sludge</b> <b>stabilisation.</b> Main advantages <b>of</b> this approach are the simple operation and easy technical {{design of the}} biological stage. But {{the balance of the}} turnover of the organic load shows an increased energy consumption of these sewage plants compared to plants with separate anaerobic sludge stabilisation.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to {{investigate}} the efficiency of a reed bed pilot system planted with macrophytes (Phragmites australis) in the <b>stabilisation</b> and dewatering <b>of</b> <b>sludge.</b> The water content <b>of</b> <b>sludge</b> was positively correlated with the biochemical activity (i. e. dehydrogenase activity (DH-ase) and respiration rate) under a wide range of redox conditions (aerobic-anaerobic). Mineralization processes seemed to be uninfluenced by seasonal changing. The metabolic index given by the ratio DH-ase/WSC increased with time from 0. 007 to 0. 02, implying that sludge organic matter mineralization was approaching maximum efficiency. Aerobic mineralization processes were quickly activated, as shown by the production of ammonia at 3 days and nitrate at 15 days. Nitrates conditioned the redox potential <b>of</b> <b>sludge</b> to relatively high values: from + 50 to + 150 mV in summer and + 10 to + 100 mV in winter. The positive redox potentials supported the organic carbon respiration because nitrates function as electron acceptors in the absence or scarcity of free atmospheric oxygen in the deeper layers. All these factors allow the system to (i) operate longer, with high loads applications <b>of</b> <b>sludge</b> and in any climate conditions, thereby making feasible onsite sludge stabilisation and thickening, and (ii) avoid frequent sludge transportation outside the wastewater treatment plant.

40|$|Abstract: The {{paper will}} {{report about the}} {{experiences}} matured at an Austrian large wastewater treatment plant of 720. 000 population equivalents, where anaerobically digested sewage sludge is further stabilised under <b>aerobic</b> conditions. Enhanced <b>stabilisation</b> <b>of</b> the anaerobically digested sludge was required at the plant {{in order to get}} a permit for landfill disposal of the dewatered stabilized sludge. By implementing a post-aeration treatment (SRT~ 6 d; 36 °C) after anaerobic digestion the organic content of the anaerobically well digested sludge can be decreased by 16 %. Investigations on site showed that during digested sludge post-aeration anoxic phases for denitrification are needed to provide stable process conditions. In this way the pH value can be kept in a more favourable range for micro-organisms and concrete structures. Additionally, inhibition of the biological process due to nitrite accumulation can be avoided. By optimising the aeration/pause ratio ~ 45 % of total nitrogen in digested sludge can be removed. This significantly improves nitrogen removal efficiency at the wastewater treatment plant. NH 4 -removal occurs mainly through nitritation and denitritation with an efficiency of 98 %. The costs/benefit analysis shows that post-aeration <b>of</b> digested <b>sludge</b> results in an increase of total annual costs for wastewater treatment of only 0. 84 %, corresponding to 0. 19 Euro/pe/a. Result of molecular biological analyses (DGGE) indicate that all four ammonium-oxidizing bacteria species present in activated sludge can survive anaerobic digestion, but only two of them can adapt in the digested sludge post-aeration tanks. Additionally, in the post-aerated digested sludge a further ammonium-oxidizing bacteria species was identified...|$|R

40|$|As a {{consequence}} of a worldwide increase of energy costs, the efficient use <b>of</b> sewage <b>sludge</b> as a renewable energy resource must be considered, even for smaller wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) with design capacities between 10, 000 and 50, 000 population equivalent (PE). To find the lower limit for an economical conversion <b>of</b> an <b>aerobic</b> <b>stabilisation</b> plant into an anaerobic stabilisation plant, we derived cost functions for specific capital costs and operating cost savings. With these tools, {{it is possible to}} evaluate if it would be promising to further investigate refitting aerobic plants into plants that produce biogas. By comparing capital costs with operation cost savings, a break-even point for process conversion could be determined. The break-even point varies depending on project specific constraints and assumptions related to future energy and operation costs and variable interest rates. A 5 % increase of energy and operation costs leads to a cost efficient conversion for plants above 7, 500 PE. A conversion of WWTPs results in different positive effects on energy generation and plant operations: increased efficiency, energy savings, and on-site renewable power generation by digester gas which can be used in the plant. Also, the optimisation of energy efficiency results in a reduction of primary energy consumption...|$|R
