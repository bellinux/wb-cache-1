5|$|Baird held ministerial {{responsibilities}} for the Toronto Harbourfront Centre and the Toronto Waterfront Revitalization Corporation. He developed a {{working relationship with}} Toronto Mayor David Miller soon after his appointment, and was present for the announcement of a comprehensive new waterfront strategy in June 2006. Ontario cabinet minister David Caplan described Baird {{as a champion of}} waterfront renewal and Miller described him <b>as</b> <b>an</b> <b>ally</b> of the city. Baird spent Christmas 2006 meeting with Canadian soldiers in Afghanistan.|$|E
5|$|Modern historians {{debate whether}} an {{alliance}} between the Franks and Mongols would {{have been successful in}} shifting {{the balance of power in}} the region, and if it would have been a wise choice on the part of the Europeans. Traditionally, the Mongols tended to see outside parties as either subjects or enemies, with little room in the middle for a concept such <b>as</b> <b>an</b> <b>ally.</b>|$|E

5|$|Shashthi's Bengali legends {{appear in}} the Mangal-Kavya texts, {{especially}} in the Shashthi-mangal section of this work. The Mangal-Kavya and Bengali folk tales describe Shashthi as closely related to Manasa, the serpent goddess. Shashthi furthermore appears <b>as</b> <b>an</b> <b>ally</b> of Manasa in a famous Bengali folk-tale describing Shashthi's activities during the Nag Panchami festival of Manasa.|$|E
5|$|At the time, several princes {{complained that}} they were being betrayed by Britain, who they {{regarded}} <b>as</b> <b>an</b> <b>ally,</b> and Sir Conrad Corfield resigned his position as head of the Political Department in protest at Mountbatten's policies. Mountbatten's policies were also criticised by the opposition Conservative Party. Winston Churchill compared the language used by the Indian government with that used by Adolf Hitler before the invasion of Austria. Modern historians such as Lumby and Moore, however, take the view that Mountbatten {{played a crucial role in}} ensuring that the princely states agreed to accede to India.|$|E
5|$|Bo's chief ideological rival, former Guangdong party chief Wang Yang, went on {{to become}} Vice-Premier holding the {{portfolios}} of agriculture, commerce, and poverty reduction. Wen Jiabao, who was seen as Bo's foremost critic in the top leadership, suffered significant public embarrassment himself over a New York Times article about his family's vast empire of wealth whose release coincided closely with Bo's dismissal. Huang Qifan, the mayor of Chongqing long seen <b>as</b> <b>an</b> <b>ally</b> of Bo, continued his political career basically unscathed. Wang Lijun was sentenced to fifteen years in prison for defection, corruption, and abuse of power.|$|E

5|$|Cossa's {{body was}} moved to the Baptistry and the nine-day funeral, as {{prescribed}} by the Ordo Romanus, was well-attended by the Florentine elite and the papal court. Cossa's corpse was crowned with a white mitre with his cardinal's hat at his feet on the funerary bier during the rituals, which took place entirely within the Baptistry and Duomo. The first three days of ceremonies celebrated in turn Cossa's role as cardinal and pope, his role <b>as</b> <b>an</b> <b>ally</b> of Florence, and his role as a private citizen. He received a temporary burial until the tomb was complete.|$|E
5|$|Henry now {{appeared}} to his contemporaries {{to be stronger}} than ever, and he was courted <b>as</b> <b>an</b> <b>ally</b> by many European leaders and asked to arbitrate over international disputes in Spain and Germany. He was nonetheless busy resolving some of the weaknesses that he believed had exacerbated the revolt. Henry set about extending royal justice in England to reassert his authority and spent time in Normandy shoring up support amongst the barons. The King also made use of the growing Becket cult to increase his own prestige, using {{the power of the}} saint to explain his victory in 1174, especially his success in capturing William.|$|E

5|$|It {{may be that}} Óengus was {{involved}} in wars in Ireland, perhaps fighting with Áed Allán, or against him <b>as</b> <b>an</b> <b>ally</b> of Cathal mac Finguine. The evidence for such involvement is limited. There {{is the presence of}} Óengus's son Bridei at Tory Island, on the north-west coast of Donegal in 733, close to the lands of Áed Allán's enemy Flaithbertach mac Loingsig. Less certainly, the Fragmentary Annals of Ireland report the presence of a Pictish fleet from Fortriu fighting for Flaithbertach in 733 rather than against him.|$|E
5|$|Truman's other appointees to the Court {{provided}} consistent conservative votes, {{and during}} Minton's first {{years on the}} Court it was returned to the conservatism of the William Howard Taft era. While on the Court, Minton transformed from a New Deal senator into an almost reactionary judge <b>as</b> <b>an</b> <b>ally</b> of Justice Felix Frankfurter. Empirical coding of votes shows that Minton was the most conservative justice on the Court during his first year, and remained in the conservative half of the court {{for the duration of}} his career.|$|E
5|$|Bulgarian {{historian}} Plamen Pavlov conjectures that Ivan the Russian was a Ruthenian {{born in the}} Kingdom of Galicia–Volhynia (centred {{on modern}} western Ukraine), a hypothesis based only on his ties to Hungary, the western neighbour of Galicia–Volhynia. Hungarian sources from 1288 make notice of one Russian named Ivan (Iwan dicto Oroz) <b>as</b> <b>an</b> <b>ally</b> of the ban of Severin, Theodore Vejtehi from the kindred Csanád, {{who was one of}} the nobles that opposed the rule of Charles I of Hungary in 1316–1317. The land to the south of Severin was governed for Bulgaria by the despot of Vidin, Michael Shishman, a supporter of Vejtehi. Thus, as the Hungarian king established his authority over Severin and suppressed Vejtehi's rebellion, Ivan the Russian may have fled to Vidin and entered the service of Michael Shishman. Ivan is thought to have been joined, as a commander subordinate to the despot of Vidin, by his personal forces which consisted of Hungarians and, presumably, Russians.|$|E

5|$|Catelyn {{arrives in}} King's Landing, {{supposedly}} in secret. However, she is {{taken by a}} pair of city watchmen to a brothel owned by Littlefinger. He meets her to tell her that he had her brought there to keep her safe and hidden. Varys, also present, reveals that he learned of Catelyn's arrival through his spies. The three of them and Ser Rodrik discuss the attempted murder of Bran. Littlefinger shocks them all by admitting that the assassin's dagger was once his own. He claims that he lost it to Tyrion Lannister, betting on Jaime Lannister to win a previous tourney. Littlefinger arranges a meeting between Eddard and Catelyn, and Eddard reluctantly takes on Littlefinger <b>as</b> <b>an</b> <b>ally</b> who will help them find Bran's assailant.|$|E
5|$|Clifford {{had already}} {{achieved}} {{prominence in the}} north where, <b>as</b> <b>an</b> <b>ally</b> of {{the son of the}} earl of Northumberland, he took part in a feud against the Neville family, the Percy's natural rivals in Yorkshire. This consisted of a series of armed raids, assaults and skirmishes, and included an ambush on one of the younger Nevilles' wedding party in 1453. Historians have seen a direct connection between his involvement in the local feud in the north with the Nevilles, and his involvement in the national struggle against the duke of York, whom the Nevilles were closely allied with in the late 1450s. Although this was supposedly a period of temporary peace between the factions, Clifford and his allies appear to have made numerous attempts to ambush the Neville and Yorkist lords.|$|E
5|$|During German-Finnish {{negotiations}} Finland {{had demanded}} to remain neutral unless the Soviet Union attacked them first. Germany therefore sought to provoke the Soviet Union into {{an attack on}} Finland. After Germany launched Barbarossa on 22 June, German aircraft used Finnish air bases to attack Soviet positions. The same day the Germans launched Operation Rentier and occupied the Petsamo Province at the Finnish-Soviet border. Simultaneously Finland proceeded to remilitarize the neutral Åland Islands. Despite these actions the Finnish government insisted via diplomatic channels that they remained a neutral party, but the Soviet leadership already viewed Finland <b>as</b> <b>an</b> <b>ally</b> of Germany. Subsequently, the Soviets proceeded to launch a massive bombing attack on 25 June against all major Finnish cities and industrial centers including Helsinki, Turku and Lahti. During a night session {{on the same day}} the Finnish parliament decided to go to war against the Soviet Union.|$|E

5|$|From 1619 to 1640, George William was elector of Brandenburg and duke of Prussia. He strove, but proved {{unable to}} break the {{dominance}} of the Electorate of Saxony in the Upper Saxon Circle. The Brandenburg-Saxon antagonism rendered the defense of the circle ineffective, and it was subsequently overrun by Albrecht von Wallenstein during the Thirty Years' War. While George William had claimed neutrality before, the presence of Wallenstein's army forced him to join the Catholic-Imperial camp in the Treaty of Königsberg (1627) and accept garrisons. When the Swedish Empire entered the war and advanced into Brandenburg, George William again claimed neutrality, yet Gustavus Adolphus of Sweden compelled George William to join Sweden <b>as</b> <b>an</b> <b>ally</b> by occupying substantial territory in Brandenburg-Prussia and concentrating an army before the town walls of Berlin. George William did not conclude an alliance, but granted Sweden transit rights, two fortresses and subsidies. Consequently, Roman Catholic armies repeatedly ravaged Brandenburg and other Hohenzollern lands.|$|E
5|$|Hugo Spadafora was a {{physician}} and political activist who had first clashed with Noriega {{when they were both}} members of Torrijo's government. Though an ally of Torrijos, he and Noriega had been personal enemies for a long time. Despite not {{being a member of the}} opposition, he became a vocal critic of Noriega after returning to Panama from Guatemala in 1981. Spadafora amassed evidence of corruption within the government by using his position <b>as</b> <b>an</b> <b>ally</b> of Torrijos to question Noriega's allies, including Rodriquez and Carlton. This included a lengthy conversation with Carlton in mid-1985 after his drug operations had collapsed due to conflicts over a missing shipment, and he had received negative publicity in the Panamanian press. In September 1985 he accused Noriega of having connections to drug trafficking and announced his intent to return to Panama to oppose him. The drug trafficking charges threatened Noriega's support among his own constituency of middle class individuals who had benefited under his and Torrijos' government.|$|E
5|$|Mitchell's design aims were {{to create}} a well-balanced, {{high-performance}} bomber interceptor and fighter aircraft capable of fully exploiting {{the power of the}} Merlin engine, while being relatively easy to fly. At the time, with France <b>as</b> <b>an</b> <b>ally,</b> and Germany thought to be the most likely future opponent, no enemy fighters were expected to appear over Great Britain, enemy bombers would be required to fly to the UK over the North Sea and no single-engined fighter at the time had the range to accompany the bombers and successfully return to its own friendly airfields; to carry out the mission of home defence, the design was intended to climb quickly to meet enemy bombers.|$|E
