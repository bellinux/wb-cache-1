2500|$|The Geek Code Block formatting, {{which is}} {{optional}} (though not in Robert Hayden's opinion), is {{a parody of}} the output produced by the encryption program PGP.

2500|$|In early episodes, Leonard is {{reluctant}} to let Penny know about his recreational activities (such as Klingon Boggle), as {{he does not want}} her to see him as <b>a</b> <b>geek.</b> While certainly <b>a</b> <b>geek</b> by most definitions, he is far less socially inept than Sheldon (who is unable to grasp social norms and is often even dismissive of them), Raj (who was unable to talk to women unless he was {{under the influence of alcohol}} or anti-anxiety prescription drugs, and even after getting over his handicap still tended to speak inappropriately), and Howard (who was often seen as [...] "creepy" [...] when flirting with women, including Penny).|$|E

2500|$|In {{some parts}} of the net, it was once common {{practice}} to use <b>a</b> <b>geek</b> code as one's email or Usenet signature.

The <b>gook</b> was <b>a</b> bonnet which covered {{the head and}} projected forward over the face, to protect the wearer's head and face from sunlight and flying debris. Bal maidens often worked outdoors or in very crude surface-level shelters, and the gook also gave protection from extreme weather conditions. By covering the ears, gooks protected the ears from the noisy industrial environment.|$|R
2500|$|Originally, geek codes were {{designed}} as a quick reference about a geek's preferences for use in [...]sig files on Usenet and email.

2500|$|In the Geek Code version 3, [...] "!" [...] is {{used before}} {{a letter to}} denote that the geek refuses to {{participate}} in the topic at hand. In some cases, it has an alternate meaning, such as G! denoting <b>a</b> <b>geek</b> of no qualifications, !d denoting not wearing any clothes, P! denoting not being allowed to use Perl, and so on. They all share some negative connotations however.|$|E
2500|$|Despite his {{attempts}} to {{not appear to be}} <b>a</b> <b>geek,</b> Leonard owns, among other things, Star Wars hygiene products, a prop of the One Ring, Star Trek and [...] officer's uniforms, an expansive Superman comic book collection (and wears Clark Kent-type glasses) and a Battlestar Galactica Colonial warrior's flight suit.

2500|$|The Geek Code is {{a series}} of letters and symbols used by {{self-described}} [...] "geeks" [...] to inform fellow geeks about their personality, appearance, interests, skills, and opinions. The idea is that everything that makes <b>a</b> <b>geek</b> individual and different from all the other geeks in the world can be written down (encoded) in this very compact format. Then other geeks can read the geek code and work back from that to discover what the writer looks like, what interests they have, and so forth. This is deemed to be efficient in some sufficiently geeky manner.|$|E

2500|$|While Hanks' family {{religious}} {{history was}} Catholic and Mormon, he has characterized himself {{as being a}} [...] "Bible-toting evangelical" [...] for several years as a teenager. In school, Hanks was unpopular with students and teachers alike, later telling Rolling Stone magazine, [...] "I was <b>a</b> <b>geek,</b> a spaz. I was horribly, painfully, terribly shy. At the same time, I was the guy who'd yell out funny captions during filmstrips. But I didn't get into trouble. I was always a real good kid and pretty responsible." [...] In 1965, his father married Frances Wong, a San Francisco native of Chinese descent. Frances had three children, two of whom lived with Hanks during his high school years. Hanks acted in school plays, including South Pacific, while attending Skyline High School in Oakland, California.|$|E
2500|$|Lana Weinberger: A popular junior {{cheerleader}} {{with long}} blonde hair, a peaches-and-cream complexion, baby {{blue eyes and}} a voluptuous figure. She dates Josh Richter {{from the start of}} the series until the summer break between the fifth and sixth books when they split up due to the four-mile distance between them and his departure for college. Lana's younger sister, Gretchen, starts at AEHS in volume eight and has a very similar personality. [...] Lana is very spiteful towards Mia until a major shift in the ninth novel, when Lana offers the olive branch because Lilly is no longer a part of Mia's social circle. Lana and Mia become good friends, with Mia noting that Lana is actually a nice but misunderstood person, although there is still some awkwardness between them. At the start, Lana is consistently teasing Mia and making her angry which makes her stomp on Lana's phone in the third book. Mia also rips out Lana's clip-on braid in the sixth book after Lana makes a mean remark to new student Perin Thomas in book six. Lana likes calling Mia <b>a</b> <b>geek</b> even though they are now good friends.|$|E
2500|$|... "Part II (On the Run)" [...] is {{a smooth}} slow-tempo electro-R love ballad which is {{equipped}} with a steamy, retro and retro-futuristic groove that creates an acute level of moody texture. It is instrumentally complete with keyboards and drums. Jon Pareles, a writer of The New York Times noted that it was the closest song to pop music on Magna Carta Holy Grail. Pareles further noted that Timbaland's production sets aside his usual brittle tones to hint at the keyboard confections of 1980's Lionel Richie and Don Henley. Lyrically, the song speaks about a rebellious couple that is desperately in love. The song opens with an airy prelude during which Beyoncé sings the lines, [...] "Who wants that perfect love story anyway anyway / Cliché cliché cliché. Who wants that hero love that saves the day anyway, cliché cliché cliché" [...] in dreamy lead vocals along with breathy harmonies. Jay-Z and Beyoncé further trade verses about fugitives finding romance, with Beyoncé singing, [...] "I hear sirens while we make love" [...] and slowly exhaling in the song, singing in her lower register, swearing that she can still hold her lover's heart and gun. She further denounces the couple's own love story as [...] "a toast to clichés in a dark past" [...] over dizzy, diving synths and drums which sound like [...] "they came out of Eric B's basement," [...] as stated by Grant Jones of the website Rap Reviews. With the lines: [...] "If it's you and me against the world/ Then so be it," [...] Jay-Z notes the criticism towards the couple when they first went public with [...] "'03 Bonnie & Clyde" [...] and the lines referencing Tupac Shakur in the song. He further acknowledges that if anyone attacks his girlfriend he would kill them: [...] "Cross the line, speak about mine/ I'mma wave this TEC, I'm <b>a</b> <b>geek</b> about mine/ Touch a ni--a where his rib at/ I click clat/ Push your muh'fuckin' wig back." ...|$|E
5000|$|Self-schemas {{vary from}} person to person because each {{individual}} has very different social and cultural life experiences. A few examples of self-schemas are: exciting or dull; quiet or loud; healthy or sickly; athletic or nonathletic; lazy or active; and geek or jock. If a person has a schema for [...] "geek or jock," [...] for example, he might think of himself as a bit of <b>a</b> computer <b>geek</b> and would possess a lot of information about that trait. Because of this, he would probably interpret many situations based on relevance to his being <b>a</b> computer <b>geek.</b>|$|R
