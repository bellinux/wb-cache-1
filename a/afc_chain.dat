Poland belongs to leading manufactures of mining link chains characterized by increased mechanical properties. High quality of increased properties of chains {{is the result of}} the application of newest generation of equipment in manufacturing processes, the choice of the highest quality of steel and first of all special heat treatment which secures links for diversified mechanical properties along its circuit. Round and flat link chains are used in longwall mining. Their mechanical and geometrical properties as well as fields of their application are presented in the paper. The computer method of selection of mining chains for AFC is also described in the paper. Conclusions make the final part of the paper.

40|$|Discrete dynamic {{programming}} {{is used for}} the development of a computer simulation of armoured semiflexible conveyor (AFC) structures used in modern longwall coal mining. The object of the simulation is the investigation of the vertical steering characteristics of face installations, the potential long-term instability of which is a continuing problem underground. The way in which the AFC structure moulds itself to the undulating floor cut by the coal winning machine (the power-loader) between successive cuts is a crucial factor in the steering behaviour of the entire face system. This, the first of two companion papers, treats the <b>AFC</b> as a <b>chain</b> of loosely coupled piecewise rigid segments (trays) rcsting on a solid coal floor. Such a model is found not to greatly assist the stability of the multipass longwall process. An elastic model is examined in the companion paper.

40|$|To {{examine the}} role of {{germinal}} centers (GCs) in the generation and selection of high affinity antibody-forming cells (AFCs), we have analyzed the average affinity of (4 -hydroxy- 3 -nitrophenyl) acetyl (NP) -specific AFCs and serum antibodies both {{during and after the}} GC phase of the immune response. In addition, the genetics of NP-binding AFCs were followed to monitor the generation and selection of high affinity AFCs at the clonal level. NP-binding AFCs gradually accumulate in bone marrow (BM) after immunization and BM becomes the predominant locale of specific AFCs in the late primary response. Although the average affinity of NP-specific BM AFCs rapidly increased while GCs were present (GC phase), the affinity of both BM AFCs and serum antibodies continued to increase even after GCs waned (post-GC phase). Affinity maturation in the post-GC phase was also reflected in a shift in the distribution of somatic mutations {{as well as in the}} CDR 3 sequences of BM <b>AFC</b> antibody heavy <b>chain</b> genes. Disruption of GCs by injection of antibody specific for CD 154 (CD 40 ligand) decreased the average affinity of subsequent BM AFCs, suggesting that GCs generate the precursors of high affinity BM AFCs; inhibition of CD 154 -dependent cellular interactions after the GC reaction was complete had no effect on high affinity BM AFCs. Interestingly, limited affinity maturatio...|$|R
40|$|Alternative Food <b>Chains</b> (<b>AFCs)</b> are a {{new model}} of food {{production}} and distribution developed worldwide. The aim of AFCs is to become a suitable alternative to mainstream models and, at the same time, it aims at representing an opportunity to recreate a place where community participants can share and develop values and attitudes. It also provides a place for experimenting new organizational models with a high involvement of the different stakeholders. A specific organizational model heavily relying on high involvement of different stakeholders has been recently defined as Food Community Networks (FCNs). FCNs include Community Supported Agriculture (CSA), Solidarity Purchase Group (SPG), Farmers’ Market (FM) and Associations pour le Maintien d’une Agriculture Paysanne (AMAP). All those organizations are similar but present differences in the way they are organized. The distinctive trait of FCNs is the creation of a community dimension where consumers and producers share scarce and valuable resources such as information, time and capital. The general objective {{of this study is to}} implement a complete research of FCN. The research has the scope to generate knowledge both in terms of organizational structure and from consumers’ point of view. If organizational elements of FCNs could be better understood, then they can be used to better design interventions to sustain local farms and communities, niche products and eventually support innovative entrepreneurial attitudes. The results illustrate the organizational structure of FCNs in terms of New Institutional Economics and Organizational Science. Moreover, we deeply investigated the participation of consumers and it has been possible to draw the identikit of a FCN participant in terms of his/her personal values, attitudes and the importance of transaction cost...|$|R
