5|$|Martin, Odlyzko, and Wolfram {{investigate}} pseudoforests {{that model}} {{the dynamics of}} cellular automata. These functional graphs, which they call state transition diagrams, have one vertex for each possible configuration that the ensemble of cells of the automaton can be in, and an edge connecting each configuration to the configuration that follows it according to the automaton's rule. One can infer properties of the automaton from the structure of these diagrams, such {{as the number of}} components, length of limiting cycles, depth of the trees connecting non-limiting states to these cycles, or symmetries of the diagram. For instance, any vertex with no incoming edge corresponds to a Garden of Eden pattern and a vertex with a self-loop corresponds to <b>a</b> <b>still</b> <b>life</b> pattern.|$|E

25|$|Juan van der Hamen {{inherited}} his father's honorary {{positions at}} court and {{also served as}} unsalaried painter of the king. Van der Hamen's artistic activity {{in the service of}} the crown is first recorded on 10 September 1619, when he was paid for painting <b>a</b> <b>still</b> <b>life</b> for the country palace of El Pardo, to the north of Madrid.|$|E
25|$|Vase {{paintings}} {{even had}} {{an influence on}} the development of modern painting. The linear style influenced artists such as Edward Burne-Jones, Gustave Moreau or Gustav Klimt. Around 1840, Ferdinand Georg Waldmüller painted <b>a</b> <b>Still</b> <b>Life</b> with Silver Vessels and Red-Figure Bell Krater. Henri Matisse produced a similar painting (Intérieur au vase étrusque). Their aesthetic influence extends into the present. For example, the well-known curved shape of the Coca-Cola bottle is inspired by Greek vases.|$|E
25|$|They {{also share}} traits {{with the work}} of Le Corbusier and Amédée Ozenfant who {{together}} had founded Purism, a style intended as a rational, mathematically based corrective to the impulsiveness of cubism. Combining the classical with the modern, Léger's Nude on a Red Background (1927) depicts a monumental, expressionless woman, machinelike in form and color. His still life compositions from this period are dominated by stable, interlocking rectangular formations in vertical and horizontal orientation. The Siphon of 1924, <b>a</b> <b>still</b> <b>life</b> based on an advertisement in the popular press for the aperitif Campari, represents the high-water mark of the Purist aesthetic in Léger's work. Its balanced composition and fluted shapes suggestive of classical columns are brought together with a quasi-cinematic close-up of a hand holding a bottle.|$|E

25|$|Many of her still-life paintings, {{considered}} her specialty, are now {{preserved in the}} Museu Nacional de Arte Antiga in Lisbon. Among her most famous still lifes {{are a series of}} paintings of the months of the year, painted in collaboration with her father and now dispersed among various private collections; each of these paintings consists of a landscape background with <b>a</b> <b>still</b> <b>life</b> in the foreground, composed of the animals, fruits, and vegetables consumed in that month. While these paintings appear to be secular still-life paintings on the surface, they also have religious meaning and may be connected to Franciscan religiosity. Taken as a whole, these paintings represent the passage of time, the inevitability of death, and the possibility of rebirth.|$|E
25|$|In 1475 a huge altarpiece of the Adoration of the Shepherds {{arrived in}} Florence. Painted by Hugo van der Goes {{at the behest}} of the Portinari family, it was shipped out from Bruges and {{installed}} in the Chapel of Sant' Egidio at the hospital of Santa Maria Nuova. The altarpiece glows with intense reds and greens, contrasting with the glossy black velvet robes of the Portinari donors. In the foreground is <b>a</b> <b>still</b> <b>life</b> of flowers in contrasting containers, one of glazed pottery and the other of glass. The glass vase alone was enough to excite attention. But the most influential aspect of the triptych was the extremely natural and lifelike quality of the three shepherds with stubbly beards, workworn hands and expressions ranging from adoration to wonder to incomprehension. Domenico Ghirlandaio promptly painted his own version, with a beautiful Italian Madonna in place of the long-faced Flemish one, and himself, gesturing theatrically, as one of the shepherds.|$|E
25|$|In the 1930s, {{she began}} {{studying}} modern art through learning {{the components of}} composition, technique, and theory. This initial investigation into modern art formed her work {{throughout the rest of}} her career. She began taking classes from Hans Hofmann in 1937, which modernized her approach to the nude and still life. He emphasized the two-dimensional nature of the picture plane and usage of color to create spatial illusion that was not representative of reality through his lessons. Throughout her classes with Hofmann, Krasner worked in an advanced style of cubism, also known as neo-cubism. During the class, a human nude or <b>a</b> <b>still</b> <b>life</b> setting would be the model from which Krasner and other students would have to work. She typically created charcoal drawings of the human models and oil on paper color studies of the still life settings. She typically illustrated female nudes in a cubist manner with tension achieved through the fragmentation of forms and the opposition of light and dark colors. The still lifes illustrated her interest in fauvism since she suspended brightly colored pigment on white backgrounds.|$|E

2500|$|In the Catholic Southern Netherlands {{the genre}} of garland {{paintings}} was developed.
