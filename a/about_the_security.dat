Taking advantage of good flying weather on 22 September, 99 round trips were made between Nadzab and Kaiapit. Most of the 2/16th Infantry Battalion and some American engineers were flown in.

5|$|Fresh {{worries about}} France, {{combined}} {{with the development of}} rifled cannon and iron-clad warships, led to the Royal Commission on the Defence of the United Kingdom being established in 1859, and expressing fears <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>security</b> of the south coast. In response, Sandgate was re-equipped with heavier guns in 1859, and extensive work was carried out on Southsea. Hurst was fitted with two huge batteries of heavy rifled breech-loading guns, protected by iron armour-plate, intended for use against fast-moving enemy warships. Tilbury Blockhouse was destroyed to make way for heavier guns at the fort after 1868. Portland was readopted by army as a garrison base in 1869 in response to fears of an invasion, but it was not rearmed.|$|E
5|$|In May 1648, a Royalist {{rebellion}} {{broke out}} in Kent. There were fresh Parliamentary concerns about Henry Hastings and fears grew that he might reoccupy Ashby de la Zouch Castle. Lord Grey - a rival of the Hastings family in Leicestershire - {{was put in charge}} of the castle in August, which was used to hold Royalist prisoners, including James Hamilton, the Duke of Hamilton. Parliamentary worries <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>security</b> of the castle persisted and, possibly because of Henry's involvement in the recent rebellion, William Bainbrigg was ordered in November to slight the castle to put it beyond military use. He carried out his orders immediately, demolishing one side of the Great Tower and the Kitchen Tower, undermining the foundations and deploying gunpowder charges.|$|E

The day after sending it, on 15 September, Lody travelled to London to reconnoitre the city's war preparations. Travelling light, he stayed for two nights at the Ivanhoe Hotel in Bloomsbury (now the Bloomsbury Street Hotel) and set to work finding information <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>security</b> measures at public buildings. He said later that he had not actually observed the buildings himself but had obtained cuttings from newspapers, which he intended to send to Berlin. He also wrote a report on 16 September, but claimed that he had never sent it– it was never found by the British– as he felt that it was poorly written.|$|E
5|$|Lockheed Martin, Thales, STN Atlas, and Raytheon were {{approached}} to provide tenders {{to design and}} assemble a new combat system for the submarines, with all four submitting proposals during early 2000. In May 2000, after the Defence Science and Technology Organisation tested operational versions of the proposed combat software packages, the Lockheed and Thales tenders were eliminated, despite the Thales proposal being rated better than Raytheon's. After indepth testing of the remaining systems and observations of the systems in action, the German STN Atlas ISUS 90-55 aboard an Israeli Dolphin-class submarine and the American Raytheon CCS Mk2 aboard a USN Los Angeles-class submarine, {{it was decided that}} the STN Atlas system was the best for the class. However, political pressure from both the United States and Australia, questions <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>security</b> problems and possible leaks involved with a European combat system linked to American weapons, and desires to increase the political and military ties between Australia and the United States resulted in the cancellation of the tender program in July 2001 and the decision to enter a joint development program with the United States, with a formal agreement signed on 10 September 2001 at the Pentagon.|$|E
5|$|The {{introduction}} of shell guns and steam ships during the 1840s {{created a new}} risk that the French might successfully attack along the south coast, and fears grew of a conflict in the early 1850s. Further worries about France, combined {{with the development of}} rifled cannon and iron-clad warships, led to the Royal Commission on the Defence of the United Kingdom being established in 1859, and expressing fears <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>security</b> of the south coast. As a result, the Grand Battery at Dartmouth Castle was rebuilt and retitled the Dartmouth Point Battery, with shell-proof, granite defences protecting three traversing gun emplacements looking out to sea, and a further two guns on the roof; one small howitzer protected the entrance to the harbour itself. It was manned by three professional soldiers, and a team of over fifty-five reservists, drawn from the newly formed Sixth Devonshire Artillery Volunteer Corps. The castle, however, was of low military priority, only of importance because the harbour might be used to as a staging post to attack Plymouth, and the guns allocated it were old-fashioned. A further upgrade in 1888 again installed only out-dated artillery pieces.|$|E

25|$|When {{planning}} {{these new}} facilities, Metcalf was concerned <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>security</b> {{of the collection}} – damage to manuscripts and books from variations in heat and humidity, or worst of all, damage from a flood. In the case of Houghton, the building that was to house the rare collections at Harvard, many features were designed into the air conditioning and plumbing systems that were meant to mitigate the risk of damage. Catch basins were installed under any pipe running horizontally to catch and divert any water from leaks. The plumbing system itself was designed so that the location of leaks could be found quickly {{through a series of}} shut-off valves, and the walls were designed with easy access to plumbing. The display cases themselves were designed so that they were well ventilated. This allowed lighting to be installed in the cases (rather than outside) without impacting the temperature and humidity levels. It was features like these that helped keep the collections safe.|$|E
25|$|Systems that don't have {{a trusted}} {{computing}} base {{as part of their}} design do not provide security of their own: they are only secure insofar as security is provided to them by external means (e.g. a computer sitting in a locked room without a network connection may be considered secure depending on the policy, regardless of the software it runs). This is because, as David J. Farber et al. put it, n a computer system, the integrity of lower layers is typically treated as axiomatic by higher layers. As far as computer security is concerned, reasoning <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>security</b> properties of a computer system requires being able to make sound assumptions about what it can, and more importantly, cannot do; however, barring any reason to believe otherwise, a computer is able to do everything that a general Von Neumann machine can. This obviously includes operations that would be deemed contrary to all but the simplest security policies, such as divulging an email or password that should be kept secret; however, barring special provisions in the architecture of the system, there is no denying that the computer could be programmed to perform these undesirable tasks.|$|E
