25|$|There are {{two types}} of {{metabolic}} pathways that are characterized by their ability to either synthesize molecules with the utilization of energy (<b>anabolic</b> <b>pathway)</b> or break down of complex molecules by releasing energy in the process (catabolic pathway). The two pathways complement each other in that the energy released from one is used up by the other. The degradative process of a catabolic pathway provides the energy required to conduct a biosynthesis of an <b>anabolic</b> <b>pathway.</b> In addition to the two distinct metabolic pathways is the amphibolic pathway, which can be either catabolic or anabolic based on the need for or the availability of energy.|$|E
25|$|In {{contrast}} to catabolic pathways, anabolic pathways require an energy input to construct macromolecules such as polypeptides, nucleic acids, proteins, polysaccharides, and lipids. The isolated reaction of anabolism is unfavorable {{in a cell}} due to a positive Gibbs Free Energy (+ΔG). Thus, an input of chemical energy through a coupling with an exergonic reaction is necessary. The coupled reaction of the catabolic pathway affects the thermodynamics of the reaction by lowering the overall activation energy of an <b>anabolic</b> <b>pathway</b> and allowing the reaction to take place. Otherwise, an endergonic reaction is non-spontaneous.|$|E
25|$|A {{catabolic pathway}} {{is a series}} of {{reactions}} that bring about a net release of energy {{in the form of a}} high energy phosphate bond formed with the energy carriers Adenosine Diphosphate (ADP) and Guanosine Diphosphate (GDP) to produce Adenosine Triphosphate (ATP) and Guanosine Triphosphate (GTP), respectively. The net reaction is, therefore, thermodynamically favorable, for it results in a lower free energy for the final products. A catabolic pathway is an exergonic system that produces chemical energy in the form of ATP, GTP, NADH, NADPH, FADH2, etc. from energy containing sources such as carbohydrates, fats, and proteins. The end products are often carbon dioxide, water, and ammonia. Coupled with an endergonic reaction of anabolism, the cell can synthesize new macromolecules using the original precursors of the <b>anabolic</b> <b>pathway.</b> An example of a coupled reaction is the phosphorylation of fructose-6-phosphate to form the intermediate fructose-1,6-bisphosphate by the enzyme phsophofructokinase accompanied by the hydrolysis of ATP in the pathway of glycolysis.

One of the bottlenecks impeding the development of novel antibacterial compounds is the identification of new enzymatic targets. The nutritionally essential amino acid <b>anabolic</b> <b>pathways,</b> for example lysine biosynthesis, provide an opportunity to explore the development of antibacterial compounds, since human genomes do not possess the genes necessary to synthesize these amino acids de novo. The diaminopimelate (DAP) /lysine (lys) <b>anabolic</b> <b>pathways</b> are attractive targets for antibacterial development since the penultimate lys precursor meso-DAP (m-DAP) is a cross-linking amino acid in the peptidoglycan (PG) cell wall of most Gram-negative bacteria and lys plays a similar role in the PG of most Gram-positive bacteria, in addition to its role as one of the 20 proteogenic amino acids.

Many studies have indicated that part of the androgen action {{may be related to the}} conversion of androgens into estrogens. Therefore, some of the most recent findings of skeletal estrogen action relevant for male skeletal physiology will also be discussed. RECENT FINDINGS: Androgens and estrogens stimulate bone formation and inhibit bone resorption. Sex steroids may interact with different receptors, target cells and other bone <b>anabolic</b> <b>pathways.</b> Androgen receptor and estrogen receptor signalling appear to be important for male bone formation during growth. Sex steroid signalling may involve genomic and nongenomic pathways, interaction with mechanical loading, the growth hormone/insulin-like growth factor-I axis and/or other bone <b>anabolic</b> <b>pathways.</b> Estrogen receptor alpha in osteoclasts appears to regulate bone resorption in women but not men, whereas androgen receptor signalling in osteoblasts may only partly regulate bone resorption in males.

50|$|The glyoxylate cycle, a {{variation}} of the tricarboxylic acid cycle, is an <b>anabolic</b> <b>pathway</b> occurring in plants, bacteria, protists, and fungi.

The cycle is generally assumed to be absent in animals, with the exception of nematodes at the early stages of embryogenesis. In recent years, however, the detection of malate synthase (MS) and isocitrate lyase (ICL), key enzymes involved in the glyoxylate cycle, in some animal tissue has raised questions regarding the evolutionary relationship of enzymes in bacteria and animals and suggests that animals encode alternative enzymes of the cycle that differ in function from known MS and ICL in non-metazoan species.|$|E

Two epithelial breast cancer cell lines (BT- 474 andMCF- 7) were compared to their respective EMT-derived mesenchymal progeny (BT- 474 EMT and MCF- 7 EMT) for changes in meta-bolic pathways including glycolysis, glycogen metabolism, <b>anabolic</b> <b>pathways</b> and gluconeogenesis. Both EMT-derived cells displayed enhanced aerobic glycolysis along with the overexpression of specific glucose transporters, lactate dehydrogenase isoforms, monocarboxylate transporters and glycogen phosphory-lase isoform. In contrast, both EMT-derived cells suppressed the expression of crucial enzymes in <b>anabolic</b> <b>pathways</b> and gluconeogenesis. STAT 3, a transcription factor involved in tumor initiation and progres-sion, plays a role in the EMT-related changes in the expression of specific enzymes and transporters.

40|$|AbstractThe aim of {{the study}} was to {{investigate}} the effect of leucine supplementation combined with exercise and whey protein in cardiac mTOR <b>anabolic</b> <b>pathway.</b> Ninety-six weanling male Wistar rats were divided into eight groups and fed diets containing either casein or WP plus increasing levels (0, 3, 4. 5 and 6 % of diet) of l-leucine for 30 days. A parallel set of eight groups was exercised for comparison. Serum aspartate amino transferase, alanine aminotransferase, creatine kinase, lactate dehydrogenase and branched chain amino acids were determined by standard methods, and mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) and p 70 S 6 K by the Western blot analysis. Chronic l-leucine supplementation was capable of increasing both mTOR and p 70 S 6 K phosphorylation in the heart in a dose-dependent fashion, independent of the type of dietary protein in both groups, sedentary and exercised, but the exercise potentialized the activation of the <b>anabolic</b> <b>pathway.</b> The content of protein in heart increase with l-leucine supplementation and the heart mass relativized by body mass did not change. In conclusion, the combination of l-leucine and milk proteins (casein or whey protein) has the potential to increase the mTOR pathway in the cardiac muscle without increasing the heart mass.

40|$|Staphylococcus aureus is {{a leading}} cause of community-associated and {{nosocomial}} infections. Imperative to the success of S. aureus is the ability to adapt and utilize nutrients that are readily available. Genomic sequencing suggests that S. aureus has the genes required for synthesis of all twenty amino acids. However, in vitro experimentation demonstrates that staphylococci have multiple amino acid auxotrophies, including arginine. Although S. aureus possesses the highly conserved <b>anabolic</b> <b>pathway</b> that synthesizes arginine via glutamate, we demonstrate here that inactivation of ccpA facilitates the synthesis of arginine via the urea cycle utilizing proline as a substrate. Mutations within putA, rocD, arcB 1, argG and argH abolished the ability of S. aureus JE 2 ccpA::tetL to grow in the absence of arginine, whereas an interruption in argJBCF, arcB 2, or proC had no effect. Furthermore, nuclear magnetic resonance demonstrated that JE 2 ccpA::ermB produced (13) C(5) labeled arginine when grown with (13) C(5) proline. Taken together, these data support the conclusion that S. aureus synthesizes arginine from proline during growth on secondary carbon sources. Furthermore, although highly conserved in all sequenced S. aureus genomes, the arginine <b>anabolic</b> <b>pathway</b> (ArgJBCDFGH) is not functional under in vitro growth conditions. Finally, a mutation in argH attenuated virulence in a mouse kidney abscess model in comparison to wild type JE 2 demonstrating the importance of arginine biosynthesis in vivo via the urea cycle.
