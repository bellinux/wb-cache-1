50|$|The Canon EF-S 10-22mm 3.5-4.5 USM lens {{is a wide}} to ultra-wide angle {{zoom lens}} for Canon digital single-lens reflex cameras with a Canon EF-S lens mount.The field of view has a 35 mm {{equivalent}} focal length of 16-35mm, which {{is analogous to the}} EF 16-35mm 2.8L on a full-frame camera. The 10-22mm is an internal focusing lens. Of the 13 elements, one is of Canon's Super Ultra-Low Dispersion glass and three are <b>aspherical</b> <b>elements.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Glass is {{the most}} common {{material}} used to construct lens elements, due to its good optical properties and resistance to scratching. Other materials are also used, such as quartz glass, fluorite, plastics like acrylic (Plexiglass), and even germanium and meteoritic glass. Plastics allow the manufacturing of strongly <b>aspherical</b> lens <b>elements</b> which are difficult or impossible to manufacture in glass, and which simplify or improve lens manufacturing and performance. Plastics are not used for the outermost elements of all but the cheapest lenses as they scratch easily. Molded plastic lenses have been used for the cheapest disposable cameras for many years, and have acquired a bad reputation: manufacturers of quality optics tend to use euphemisms such as [...] "optical resin". However many modern, high performance (and high priced) lenses from popular manufacturers include molded or hybrid <b>aspherical</b> <b>elements,</b> so it is not true that all lenses with plastic elements are of low photographic quality.|$|R
40|$|The {{design and}} {{analysis}} {{of a large number}} of normal incidence multilayer x ray microscopes based on the spherical mirror Schwarzschild configuration is examined. Design equations for the spherical mirror Schwarzschild microscopes are summarized and used to evaluate mirror parameters for microscopes with magnifications ranging from 2 to 50 x. Ray tracing and diffraction analyses are carried out for many microscope configurations to determine image resolution as a function of system parameters. The results are summarized in three publication included herein. A preliminary study of advanced reflecting microscope configurations, where aspherics are used in place of the spherical microscope mirror elements, has indicated that the <b>aspherical</b> <b>elements</b> will improve off-axis image resolution and increase the effective field of view...|$|R
50|$|Nikon {{announced}} {{the first version}} of this lens on November 1, 2005. The lens offers a 35 film equivalent focal length range of 27-300mm, with a compact silent wave autofocus motor featuring full-time manual override and internal focusing. Its second generation Vibration Reduction technology claims to provide compensation equivalent to an increase in shutter speed of four stops. The lens has sixteen lens elements in twelve groups, with two ED glass elements to reduce chromatic aberration, and three <b>aspherical</b> <b>elements</b> to reduce image distortion. Although this lens was designed for use on Nikon DX format DSLRs, its Nikon F lens mount allows it to be used on Nikon full-frame DSLRs, albeit with vignetting due to a smaller image circle. This lens also works with teleconverters.|$|R
40|$|Surface relief {{refractive}} microlens arrays {{are designed}} and fabricated using two methods. In {{the first method}} lithographically patterned circular cylinders of photoresist are melted to form the spherical lens shape. In the second method the lens shapes are sculpted lithographically from photoresist using a variable transmission (grey-scale) mask made from high-energy-beam-sensitive (HEBS) glass. The microlenses were characterised interferometrically. It was found that close to diffraction limited performance was achieved in the f/ 0. 9 to f/ 2 range using the photoresist melting process, whereas diffraction limited performance was achieved using the grey-scale method in the f/ 1 to f/ 7 range using <b>aspherical</b> <b>elements.</b> The grey-scale method was also used to fabricate a 64 level computer generated hologram of the logo of the Institut national d'optique (INO) in a single step...|$|R
50|$|The EF series {{includes}} over eighty lenses. The EF {{series has}} encompassed focal lengths from 8 to 1200 mm. The EF-M mount was introduced with two lenses, a 22mm prime and an 18-55mm zoom. Many EF lenses include such features as Canon's ultrasonic motor (USM) drive, an image stabilization system (IS), diffractive optics (DO) and, particularly for L-series lenses, fluorite and <b>aspherical</b> lens <b>elements.</b>|$|R
5000|$|... 1968: OP Fisheye-Nikkor 10mm f/5.6 (Japan): first SLR lens with <b>aspherical</b> <b>elements.</b> Was a 180° orthographic {{projection}} fisheye lens for Nikon and Nikkormat 35 mm SLRs. Typical lens elements have spherically curved surfaces. However, this causes off-axis light {{to be focused}} closer to the lens than axial rays (spherical aberration) and degrading image sharpness; especially severe in very wide angle or aperture lenses. This can be prevented by using elements with convoluted aspheric curves. Although this was understood since the 17th century, the grinding of aspheric glass surfaces was extremely difficult and prevented their consumer use until the E. Leitz 50mm f/1.2 Noctilux (West Germany) in 1966; for Leica M-series 35 mm RFs. The Canon FD 55mm f/1.2 AL (Japan) of 1971 was the first rectilinear aspheric SLR lens; for FD mount Canon SLRs, and the Asahi SMC Takumar 15mm f/3.5 (Japan/West Germany) of 1975 was the first rectilinear aspheric wide angle SLR lens; for M42 screw mount Asahi Pentax SLRs (co-designed with Carl Zeiss Oberkochen). The use of modern precision molded plastic or glass aspheric lens elements has made aspheric lenses common today.|$|R
50|$|The Sigma 24mm f/1.8 EX DG is {{wide-angle}} lens {{which features a}} fast f/1.8 maximum aperture for use in low-light situations, and macro focusing capability to a reproduction ratio of 1:2.7. It uses <b>aspherical</b> lens <b>elements.</b> Though intended for 35mm film and full-frame digital SLRs, this lens is available for several makes of APS-C digital SLR cameras, where the angle of view {{is similar to a}} moderate {{wide-angle lens}} (in the 35mm-40mm range, {{depending on the size of}} the D-SLR sensor).|$|R
50|$|The {{design is}} {{presently}} used in inexpensive-but-high-quality fast lenses {{such as the}} Canon EF 50mm 1.8 and Nikon 50 mm 1.8D AF Nikkor. It is also {{used as the basis}} for faster designs, with elements added, such as a seventh element as in both Canon and Nikon's 50 mm 1.4 offerings or an <b>aspherical</b> seventh <b>element</b> in Canon's 50 mm 1.2. The design appears in other applications where a simple fast normal lens is required (~53° diagonal) such as in projectors.|$|R
50|$|The EF 35 mm 1.4L USM is a {{professional}} L series lens. It is constructed with a plastic body and metal mount. The screw-on filter thread at the front is metal. Features of this lens are a wide rubber focus ring that is damped, and a distance window with infrared index. The maximum aperture of 1.4 gives this lens {{the ability to create}} shallow depth of field and smooth bokeh effects. The optical construction of this lens contains 11 lens elements in 9 groups, including one ground and polished <b>aspherical</b> lens <b>element.</b> It uses a rear floating focusing system, powered by a ring type USM motor. Autofocus speed of this lens is very fast, and the front of the lens neither rotates nor extends when focusing.|$|R
50|$|The EF 50mm 1.2L USM is a {{professional}} L series lens designed to replace the EF 50mm 1.0L USM. It is constructed with a metal body and mount, and plastic extremities. This lens features a wide rubber focusing ring that is damped, a distance window with infrared index, and is fully weather-sealed, when a filter {{is added to the}} front. A circular, 8-blade diaphragm and maximum aperture of 1.2 give this lens the ability to create very shallow depth of field effects with smooth background blur. The optical construction of this lens contains 8 lens elements, including one ground and polished <b>aspherical</b> lens <b>element.</b> This lens uses a floating front extension focusing system, powered by a ring-type USM motor. The front of the lens does not rotate or extend when focusing.|$|R
50|$|The Sigma 50mm 1.4 EX DG HSM is {{constructed}} {{with a plastic}} body and a metal mount. This lens features a distance window with depth of field scale. A nine-blade, maximum aperture of 1.4 gives the lens {{the ability to create}} shallow depth-of-field effects. The optical construction of this lens contains eight lens <b>elements,</b> including one <b>aspherical</b> lens <b>element.</b> This lens uses a front extension focusing system, powered by a ring USM motor. Auto-focus speed of the lens is moderate; it is not as fast as most ring USM lenses. The front of the lens does not rotate, but does extend when focusing. The lens is designed so that the outer body barrel is longer than the inner lens barrel, when the inner lens barrel is at its longest extension. This results in the lens maintaining the same overall length no matter where the point of focus lies.|$|R
50|$|The 18-50mm 2.8 EX DC Macro is a consumer-level lens. It is {{constructed}} {{with a plastic}} body and a metal mount. The lens features a distance window with depth of field scale. A 7-blade, maximum aperture of 2.8 gives the lens {{the ability to create}} depth of field effects. The optical construction of the lens contains 15 lens <b>elements,</b> including two <b>aspherical</b> lens <b>elements,</b> one SLD (Special Low Dispersion) element, and one ELD (Extraordinary Low Dispersion) element. The lens uses an internal focusing system, powered by a micro motor. Auto focus speed of this lens is moderate, but because of its focal length, auto focus time is not long. The front of the lens does not rotate, but the focusing ring does, when using auto focus. The lens uses an extending inner lens barrel when zooming, this allows a more compact design, and does not rotate while zooming.|$|R
50|$|The Canon F-1 {{used the}} Canon FD lens mount, though earlier FL and R series lenses {{could be used}} as well with very few {{exception}}s. One exception is the FLP 38 mm F2.8 which sat way back in the mount and was designed for the Canon Pellix, an FL era camera. Canon Lenses were acclaimed for their superb optical quality, and ranged from 7.5 mm Fisheye to the super long telephoto FL 1200 mm F11. Canon pioneered the use of artificial Calcium Fluorite lens elements, thus making high speed long telephoto lenses a reality. Ultra Low dispersion glass was another Canon innovation, as was <b>aspherical</b> lens <b>elements</b> for high speed normal and wide angle lenses. Canon's superior lenses quality and excellent cameras was (and still is) manifested by the legions of sports photographers with long white super telephoto lenses at major sporting events worldwide. All those white lens barrels are Canon lenses and back in the 1970s, 1980s, and early 1990s those lenses were fitted to Canon F-1s.|$|R
50|$|Zoom lenses {{dominated}} the 1980s and 90s, and so, {{there were few}} new Double Gauss normal lenses. Zooms continue to dominate the digital era, but many new prestige low production Double Gauss lenses have appeared. Compare the Canon EF 50mm f/1.2L USM (2007, Japan), Nikon AF-S Nikkor 50mm f/1.4G (2008, Japan/China), Sigma EX DG HSM 50mm f/1.4 (2008, Japan), (Cosina) Voigtländer Nokton 50mm f/1.1 (2009, Japan), Leica Noctilux-M 50mm f/0.95 ASPH (2009, Germany) with their antecedents, or 'SLR Magic HyperPrime 50mm CINE T0.95' (2012, Hong Kong, China).The design is presently used in inexpensive-but-high-quality fast lenses such as the Sony FE 50mm 1.8, the Canon EF 50mm 1.8 and the Nikon 50 mm 1.8D AF Nikkor. It is also {{used as the basis}} for faster designs, with elements added, such as a seventh element as in both Canon and Nikon's 50 mm 1.4 offerings or an <b>aspherical</b> seventh <b>element</b> in Canon's 50 mm 1.2.

50|$|Featuring a {{circular}} 8-blade diaphragm, {{and a maximum}} aperture of 1.2, this lens is capable of maintaining sharpness and image quality at low apertures. The lens' depth of field allows distinct focus on the subject, while providing a beautiful bokeh. The optical construction of this lens contains 8 lens elements, including one ground and polished <b>aspherical</b> lens <b>element,</b> which makes this lens extremely sharp when stopped down to about 2. This lens uses a floating front extension focusing system, powered by a ring type USM motor. Auto focus speed of this lens is on the slow side when compared to most ring USM lenses, and photographing fast moving targets can be quite challenging with this lens. Manual focusing is done by wire: this lens {{does not have a}} direct mechanical connection to the focusing ring, but instead detects the rotation of the focusing ring and uses the autofocus motor to drive the lens elements. While full-time manual focus is available, the lens can not be focused when the camera is off. The front of the lens does not rotate, but does extend when focusing.|$|R
5000|$|The {{discontinued}} EF 50mm 1.0L USM is {{a professional}} L series autofocus lens. On the used market sells {{for as much as}} double the original retail value. It was the fastest SLR lens in production during its lifetime. This lens has a metal body and mount, and plastic extremities. It also features a wide rubber focus ring that is damped, a distance window with infrared index, and the ability to set the focus range from 0.6m to infinity, or 1m to infinity. In common with the EF 85mm f/1.2L USM it uses an electronic [...] "focus by wire" [...] system and requires power from the camera in order to manual focus. The 8-blade diaphragm and maximum aperture of 1.0 give this lens the ability to create extremely shallow depth of field effects and to support low light situations. The optical construction of this lens contains 11 lens elements, including two ground and polished <b>aspherical</b> lens <b>elements.</b> This lens uses a floating front extension focusing system, powered by a ring-type USM motor. The front of the lens does not rotate, but does extend when focusing.|$|R
40|$|Aspherical glass lenses are {{increasingly}} being used in consumer products like high power laser generators, digital cameras, projectors and scientific instruments. However, conventional manufacturing processes are not suitable for medium to high volume production of <b>aspherical</b> glass optical <b>elements.</b> Recently, compression molding {{has emerged as a}} promising alternative in which a glass gob or blank is pressed in a single operation into the shape of a finished lens. Annealing of the formed lens is required to achieve optical quality. The process is net shape, environment friendly and suitable for high volume production. Further implementation of this innovative process is hindered by technical challenges associated with curve conformance, tooling cost and mold life. This dissertation research seeks a fundamental understanding of the lens molding process by adopting a combined experimental, analytical and numerical Finite Element Method (FEM) approach. Preliminary experiments were performed involving molding of a test aspherical glass lens on a commercial lens molding machine to study process capability to manufacture an optic component within the desired specifications. Experiments were also performed to determine the effect of different molding parameter...|$|R
