But after considering the able arguments of counsel for both sides, the court is unable to conclude that it clearly erred in dismissing this action on for forum non conveniens.

50|$|Grimshaw appeals {{from the}} order {{granting}} a conditional new trial {{and from the}} <b>amended</b> judgment entered <b>pursuant</b> to the order. Grimshaw argues that 1) the punitive damages awarded by the jury where not excessive {{as a matter of}} law; 2) the specification of reasons was inadequate; and 3) the court abused its discretion in cutting the award so drastically. The appellate court held that the trial court did not err in reducing the jury's award of punitive damages from more than 122 million to 3.5 million or in granting a new trial for excessive damages. There was no evidence showing that the trial judge abused his discretion, nor that he acted in any way that was not fair and reasonable under the circumstances.|$|R

Background Terrorist incidents around the world including {{the attacks on the}} World Trade Centre and Pentagon in the United States in 2001, and the Bali bombings in 2002, led to the review of counter-terrorism measures by Australian governments. The Commonwealth Government was referred legislative powers to provide constitutional support for terrorism offences that apply uniformly throughout Australia. Victoria enacted the Terrorism (Community Protect) Act 2003 (the Act) to cover those areas where Victoria continued to have legislative responsibility.
