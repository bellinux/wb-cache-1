Tajiri <b>always</b> <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> Nintendo would reject his game, {{as the company}} did not really understand the concept at first. However, the games {{turned out to be}} a complete success, something Tajiri and Nintendo never expected, especially because of the declining popularity of the Game Boy. Upon hearing of the Pokémon concept, Miyamoto suggested creating multiple cartridges with different Pokémon in each, noting it would assist the trading aspect.|$|E

The plans for these raids varied from sudden and fairly simple operations (subject to change on the fly) to highly intricate. The political situation interfered on occasions and this was much resented: the troops <b>always</b> <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> these operations were most important.|$|E

Lawrence hated Wilson, fearing that he will take away his daughter some day. After arriving at the river, Wilson recalls many summers he spent here, along with Amelia and Frank Dodd. The three often discussed their future, with Wilson and Frank both wanting to become pilots, and Amelia wanting to dance on Broadway. Years later Amelia asks Wilson to do the honorable thing and marry her, but fears what her father will do {{to him when he}} found out. Wilson is surprised about her request, as he <b>always</b> <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> she would never marry him, but he is determined to make her dream become a reality.|$|E

500|$|Emmeline Pankhurst {{was born}} on 15 July 1858 in the Manchester suburb of Moss Side. Although her birth {{certificate}} states otherwise, she believed that her birthday was a day earlier, on Bastille Day – 14 July. Most biographies, including those written by her daughters, repeat this claim. Feeling a kinship with the female revolutionaries who stormed the Bastille, she said in 1908: [...] "I have <b>always</b> <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> the fact that I {{was born on}} that day {{had some kind of}} influence over my life." [...] The reason for the discrepancy remains unclear.|$|E

Dan and Maddy have always been {{incredibly}} close without becoming lovers, but it is obvious that they are great together, so when it happens it is effortless and joyous and has wonderful potential. But Dan's private demons prevent it from being allowed to live and grow. I always thought it might be great for him, if only he could have let it be." ...|$|E

In late May 1975, Pat went to her girlhood town of Artesia to dedicate the Patricia Nixon Elementary School. In her remarks, she said, [...] "I'm proud to have the school carry my name. I <b>always</b> <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> only those who have gone had schools named after them. I am happy {{to tell you that}} I'm not gone—I mean, not really gone."

500|$|The {{producers}} {{decided to}} have the film open with the statement [...] "Hell is a teenage girl" [...] to reflect the [...] "horrors" [...] of puberty and that [...] "the hellish emotions felt during high school often reappear as teenage girls mature into young women". Cody stated: There's the scene where Jennifer's sitting alone smearing makeup on her face. I <b>always</b> <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> was such a sad image. She's so vulnerable.

[...] Lennon described his working arrangement with Ono and Spector: [...] "Phil doesn't arrange or anything like that— and Phil will just sit in the other room and shout comments like, 'Why don't you try this sound' or 'You're not playing the piano too well'...

Marketing for the faux {{documentary}} included a movie poster and an official website prior to Tropic Thunders release.

Amy Powell, an advertising executive with Paramount, reflected on {{the timing of the}} release of Madness: [...] "We <b>always</b> <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> people would be talking about Tropic Thunder at the water cooler, and that's why we decided to release Rain of Madness two weeks into Tropics run—to keep this positive buzz going." ...|$|E

500|$|According to Rolling Stone, Marquee Moon was a post-punk album, while Jason Heller from The A.V. Club {{described}} it as [...] "elegantly jagged" [...] art punk. Robert Christgau regarded it {{as more of a}} rock record because of Television's formal and technical abilities as musicians: [...] "It wasn't punk. Its intensity wasn't manic; it didn't come in spurts." [...] Both sides of the album began with three shorter, hook-driven songs, which Stylus Magazines Evan Chakroff said veered between progressive rock and post-punk styles. The title track and [...] "Torn Curtain" [...] were longer and more jam-oriented. [...] "As peculiar as it sounds, I've <b>always</b> <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> we were a pop band", Verlaine later told Select.

500|$|Tynan {{remarked to}} Olivier, [...] "you aren't really a contemplative or {{philosophical}} actor"; Olivier {{was known for}} the strenuous physicality of his performances in some roles. He told Tynan this {{was because he was}} influenced as a young man by Douglas Fairbanks, Ramon Navarro and John Barrymore in films, and Barrymore on stage as Hamlet: [...] "tremendously athletic. I admired that greatly, all of us did.... One thought of oneself, idiotically, skinny as I was, as a sort of Tarzan." [...] According to Morley, Gielgud was widely considered [...] "the best actor in the world from the neck up and Olivier from the neck down." [...] Olivier described the contrast thus: [...] "I've <b>always</b> <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> we were the reverses of the same coin... the top half John, all spirituality, all beauty, all abstract things; and myself as all earth, blood, humanity." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{mouth of}} the triptych's central figure was also {{inspired}} by the nurse's scream in film director Sergei Eisenstein's Odessa Steps massacre sequence in The Battleship Potemkin (1925). In 1984, the broadcaster Melvyn Bragg confronted Bacon with a reproduction of the centre panel during the filming of a South Bank Show documentary, and observed that in his earlier career the artist seemed preoccupied with the physicality of the human mouth. Bacon replied, [...] "I had <b>always</b> <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> I {{would be able to}} make the mouth with all the beauty of a Monet landscape though I never succeeded in doing so." [...] When Bragg asked why he thought he had failed, Bacon admitted, [...] "It should be all much more colour, should have got more of the interior of the mouth, with all the colours of the interior of the mouth, but I didn't happen to get it." ...|$|E
500|$|Although Kidd {{drove his}} dancers hard, {{partly because he}} himself was capable of doing all the dance steps that he {{required}} of them, his personal style was gentle. Nanette Fabray, who performed in Love Life, could only make dancing turns {{to the left side}} because of a hearing problem. Rather than insisting she turn to the right, as many choreographers would do, Kidd [...] "found that fascinating, and he made all the other dancers turn to the left". Julie Andrews recalled that the [...] "Burlington Bertie From Bow" [...] number in Star! was physically demanding, and she balked when Kidd asked her for a retake, saying she had a bad back. Andrews recalled that [...] "he looked crestfallen. Then he said, 'I wasn't trying to be mean. I just knew that when you saw it on film, you wouldn't be pleased.'

The first PBR I ever had was at the Jockey Club, this really old-school punk-rock bar on Killingsworth.
