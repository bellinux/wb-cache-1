Warren Samuels in his 2007 book, The Legal-Economic Nexus, argues, [...] "efficiency in the Pareto sense cannot dispositively be applied to the definition and <b>assignment</b> <b>of</b> <b>rights</b> themselves, because efficiency requires an antecedent determination of the rights (23-4)".|$|E

50|$|An {{inventor}} cannot opt {{out from}} being mentioned as such in a U.S. patent, {{even if the}} patent application was assigned before publication. <b>Assignment</b> <b>of</b> <b>rights</b> in a patent does not alter to whom the patent is actually issued.

This <b>assignment</b> <b>of</b> <b>rights</b> was a gesture by Manilal in good faith {{and in response to}} a specific appeal from the then Vice-Chancellor of the University of Kerala, that the University wanted to generate funds from this publication for utilisation of such royalty incomes toward re-publication of old Malayalam classical works, which are out of print, and not forecasted to generate a viable level of income due to limited sale of such classical works.|$|E
5000|$|The parties {{characterized}} the sole {{issue in the}} case as one of statutory construction. Federal Medicaid statutes provided for the <b>assignment</b> <b>of</b> <b>rights</b> to third-party payments, but prohibited the placing of a lien on a Medicaid recipient's property. [...] Ahlborn argued that the settlement was her [...] "property," [...] and that this prohibition accordingly limited the State's recovery to only those portions of the payments made for medical expenses. The parties stipulated that the State would recover $ 215,645.30 if it prevailed on the statutory construction issue, representing the total amount the State paid in relation to Ahlborn's care, but only $ 35,581.47 if Ahlborn prevailed, representing 16.5 percent of the total, which was considered a fair representation {{of the percentage of}} the settlement constituting payment by the defendants for past medical care.|$|E

50|$|<b>Assignment</b> <b>of</b> <b>rights</b> under a {{contract}} is the complete {{transfer of the}} rights to receive the benefits accruing {{to one of the}} parties to that contract. For example, if Party A contracts with Party B to sell Party A's car to Party B for $10, Party A can later assign the benefits of the contract - i.e., the right to be paid $10 - to Party C. In this scenario, Party A is the obligee/assignor, Party B is an obligor, and Party C is the assignee. Such an assignment may be donative (essentially given as a gift), or it may be contractually exchanged for consideration. It is important to note, however, that Party C is not a third party beneficiary, because the contract itself was not made for the purpose of benefitting Party C. When an assignment is made, the assignment always takes place after the original contract was formed. An Assignment only transfers the rights/benefits to a new owner. The obligations remain with the previous owner. Compare Novation.|$|E
5000|$|Rawls bases his Original Position on a [...] "thin {{theory of}} the good" [...] which he says [...] "explains the {{rationality}} underlying choice of principles in the Original Position". A full {{theory of the}} good follows after we derive principles from the original position. Rawls claims that the parties in the original position would adopt two such principles, which would then govern the <b>assignment</b> <b>of</b> <b>rights</b> and duties and regulate the distribution {{of social and economic}} advantages across society. The difference principle permits inequalities in the distribution of goods only if those inequalities benefit the worst-off members of society. Rawls believes that this principle would be a rational choice for the representatives in the original position for the following reason: Each member of society has an equal claim on their society’s goods. Natural attributes should not affect this claim, so the basic right of any individual, before further considerations are taken into account, must be to an equal share in material wealth. What, then, could justify unequal distribution? Rawls argues that inequality is acceptable only if it is to the advantage of those who are worst-off.|$|E
5000|$|John Rawls {{defines the}} common good as [...] "certain general {{conditions}} that are...equally to everyone's advantage." [...] In his Theory of Justice, Rawls argues for a principled reconciliation of liberty and equality, applied to {{the basic structure of}} a well-ordered society, which will specify exactly such general conditions. Starting with an artificial device he calls the Original position, Rawls defends two particular principles of justice by arguing that these are the positions reasonable persons would choose were they to choose principles from behind a veil of ignorance. Such a [...] "veil" [...] is one that essentially blinds people to all facts about themselves so they cannot tailor principles to their own advantage. According to Rawls, ignorance of these details about oneself will lead to principles that are fair to all. If an individual does not know how he will end up in his own conceived society, he is likely not going to privilege any one class of people, but rather develop a scheme of justice that treats all fairly. In particular, Rawls claims that those in the Original Position would all adopt a maximin strategy which would maximize the prospects of the least well-off individual or group. In this sense, Rawls's understanding of {{the common good}} is intimately tied with the well-being of the least advantaged. Rawls claims that the parties in the original position would adopt two governing principles, which would then regulate the <b>assignment</b> <b>of</b> <b>rights</b> and duties and regulate the distribution of social and economic advantages across society. The First Principle of Justice states that [...] ""First: each person is to have an equal right to the most extensive basic liberty compatible with a similar liberty for others." [...] The Second Principle of Justice provides that social and economic inequalities are to be arranged such that [...] "(a) they are to be of the greatest benefit to the least-advantaged members of society, consistent with the just savings principle" [...] (the difference principle); and [...] "(b) offices and positions must be open to everyone under conditions of 'fair equality of opportunity.'" ...|$|E

40|$|I {{develop a}} social choice {{approach}} to analyzing the endogenous <b>assignment</b> <b>of</b> individual <b>rights.</b> The rights are assigned {{on the basis}} of aggregation of the individual judgments of the relative importance (urgency) of particular interests that rights serve to protect. The key results of the model are two impossibility theorems: one induced by the conflicts between endogenously assigned rights, the other, underscoring the robustness of Sen’s theorem to requiring consistency between the <b>assignments</b> <b>of</b> <b>rights</b> and the underlying urgency judgments, by the conflicts be-tween endogenously assigned rights and Pareto. The theorems show that these conflicts persist even in the presence of unanimous agreements on the relative evaluation of individual urgencies and on the intrapersonal comparisons of urgencies across bundles of alternatives- arguably, the most demanding restrictions on the underlying preference domains that are consistent with the liberal commitment to “protecting while disagreeing. ...|$|R

A residential golf community {{can be referred to}} as a multi titled golf development (MTGD) where separately titled houses and a golf course coexist within an identifiable estate that typically has a single road entry point. The study's objectives are to outline typical governance arrangements concerning the <b>assignment</b> <b>of</b> <b>rights</b> between accommodation owners and golf course entities in Queensland MTGDs, and to explore the nature of governance challenges arising in connection with the <b>assignment</b> <b>of</b> <b>rights</b> between these two parties. Drawing on qualitative data collected from thirteen interviews with Queensland-based developer representatives and body corporate managers experienced in MTGDs, it has been found that there is a legislative trend towards accommodation owners experiencing diminished levels of influence on golf course management and operations. All interviewees felt this to be the most appropriate model for future MTGDs. It is nevertheless noted that this development signifies a degree of neighbourhood disenfranchisement for residential owners and that a poorly managed golf course can negatively influence residential property values and political harmony in an MTGD.
