This paper selected the Pb-Sb alloy material and Pb-Sn alloy material, made an investigation on the negative corrosion resistance and hydrogen evolution of these two alloy materials by scanning electron microscope analysis, metallographic analysis, chemical study and linear sweep voltammetry, and discussed the influence of lead alloy hydrogen evolution on the negative strap corrosion. The results showed that the hydrogen evolution reaction rates of the alloys {{had an impact on the}} corrosion areas with the maximum thickness of the alloys and the depth of corrosion layers. Greater hydrogen evolution reaction rate can lead to shorter distance between the corrosion area with the maximum thickness and the liquid level; whereas the greater corrosion layer thickness can bring <b>aggravated</b> <b>risk</b> of negative strap corrosion failure...|$|E

The motivation {{for this study}} is the observation that little research and no concerted efforts have been made at the global level to provide a consistent and equitable drought risk management framework for multiple regions, population groups and economic sectors. Drought risk is assessed for the period 2000 - 2014 and is based on the product of three independent determinants: hazard, exposure and vulnerability. Drought hazard is derived from a non-parametric analysis of historical precipitation deficits at the 0. 5 dd; drought exposure is based on a non-parametric aggregation of gridded indicators of population and livestock densities, crop cover and water stress; and drought vulnerability is computed as the arithmetic composite of high level factors of social, economic and infrastructural indicators, collected at both the national and sub-national levels. The performance evaluation of the proposed models underlines their statistical robustness and emphasizes an empirical resemblance between the geographic patterns of potential drought impacts and previous results presented in the literature. Our findings support the idea that drought risk is driven by an exponential growth of regional exposure, while hazard and vulnerability exhibit a weaker relationship with the geographic distribution of risk values. Drought risk is lower for remote regions, such as tundras and tropical forests, and higher for populated areas and regions extensively exploited for crop production and livestock farming, such as South-Central Asia, Southeast of South America, Central Europe and Southeast of the United States.

QUALITY OF EVIDENCE: MEDLINE was searched from January 1966 to December 2001 for articles {{on the relationship between}} diet and lifestyle and DU using the key words duodenal ulcer and diet, fibre, or lifestyle. Evidence that these factors are associated with DU arose mainly from three case-control and three prospective studies (level II evidence) and from expert opinion (level III evidence). MAIN MESSAGE: A high-fibre diet appears to reduce risk of DU; soluble fibre might be associated with reduced risk also. Vitamin A intake is associated with lower risk of DU. Little evidence indicates that fat, type of fat, protein intake, or consumption of alcohol or caffeine affect the etiology of DU.

40|$|Chickpea (Cicer arietinum L.) is a {{dry season}} food legume and is largely grown on {{residual}} soil moisture after the rainy season. The crop often experiences moisture stress {{towards the end}} of the crop season (terminal drought). The crop may also face heat stress at the reproductive stage, if sowing is delayed. The increasing climate variability, reflected in wide fluctuations in temperatures and rainfall, is further <b>aggravating</b> <b>risks</b> of terminal drought and heat stresses to chickpea crop, particularly in the semi-arid tropics (SAT). The genetic approaches being used for managing terminal drought and heat stresses include development of varieties with early maturity and enhanced tolerance to these stresses. Excellent progress has been made in the development of early maturing varieties with high yield potential, which helped in bringing additional area under cultivation and enhancing productivity of chickpea in short-season SAT environments. Several varieties with improved drought tolerance have been developed by the classical approach of selecting for grain yield under moisture stress conditions. Similarly, selection for pod set in the crop, subjected to reproductive stage heat stress by delayed planting, has helped in development of heat-tolerant varieties. A genomic region called “QTL-hot spot”, which controls a number of drought tolerance traits including root traits, has been introgressed into several popular cultivars using marker-assisted backcrossing (MABC); and introgression lines giving significantly higher yield than the popular cultivars under moisture stress conditions have been identified. Multi-parent advanced generation inter-cross (MAGIC) approach has been found promising in enhancing genetic recombination and developing lines with enhanced tolerance to terminal drought and heat stresses.

To understand the coordination between proteome imbalance and longevity, we addressed the mechanistic {{role of the}} quality-control ubiquitin ligase CHIP, which is a key regulator of proteostasis. We observed that CHIP deficiency leads to increased levels of the insulin receptor (INSR) and reduced lifespan of worms and flies. The membrane-bound INSR regulates the insulin and IGF 1 signaling (IIS) pathway and thereby defines metabolism and aging. INSR is a direct target of CHIP, which triggers receptor monoubiquitylation and endocytic-lysosomal turnover to promote longevity. However, upon proteotoxic stress conditions and during aging, CHIP is recruited toward disposal of misfolded proteins, reducing its capacity to degrade the INSR. Our study indicates a competitive relationship between proteostasis and longevity regulation through CHIP-assisted proteolysis, providing a mechanistic concept for understanding the impact of proteome imbalance on aging...|$|R

When counterparty risk is not directly observable, I show that central clearing can lead to higher collateral require-ments for two different reasons. First, a CCP offering diversification of risk cannot selectively forgo incentives for transactions that optimally use collateral only for in-surance. Second, requiring more collateral for better incentives can reduce market liquidity and adversely affect market discipline which is a substitute for collateral. Hence, while CCP clearing can lower default through higher collateral requirements, there is a feedback effect through a fall in market liquidity that amplifies collateral costs. As a consequence, CCP clearing is likely to offer net benefits only in markets that are sufficiently liquid and where the potential for endogenous risk taking is not too severe...|$|R
