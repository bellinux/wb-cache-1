5|$|Calhoun {{is often}} held in high regard by the Southern Lost Cause historians, who hold a romanticized {{view of the}} old Southern {{way of life and}} its cause during the Civil War. Historians such as Charles M. Wiltse, Margaret Coit, and Clyde N. Wilson have, in their writings, portrayed Calhoun as <b>a</b> <b>sympathetic</b> or heroic figure.|$|E
5|$|Esthesioneuroblastoma, {{also known}} as {{olfactory}} neuroblastoma, is believed to arise from the olfactory epithelium and its classification remains controversial. However, since it is not <b>a</b> <b>sympathetic</b> nervous system malignancy, esthesioneuroblastoma is a distinct clinical entity and {{is not to be}} confused with neuroblastoma.|$|E

40|$|Vasoconstriction of the {{vertebral}} artery may be neurogenic in origin. Although {{the existence of}} <b>a</b> perivascular <b>sympathetic</b> plexus of the {{vertebral artery}} is not in doubt, no method used to date has conclusively demonstrated <b>a</b> direct <b>sympathetic</b> innervation of the vascular smooth muscle cells and, hence, vasomotor function. It was {{the aim of this}} study, therefore, to visualise and localise noradrenergic fibres in the wall of the vertebral artery. Intracranial vertebral artery specimens (10 vervet monkeys and 10 baboon vessels) were sectioned (40 ?m serial sections) and treated with anti-tyrosine hydroxylase, anti-dopamine b-hydroxylase, and antichromogranin- A antibodies. Some evidence of catecholaminergic fibres in the tunica adventitia but not penetrating the external elastic lamina or tunica media of the vertebral artery wall was seen. These findings were confirmed by electron microscopy. It was concluded that although <b>a</b> perivascular <b>sympathetic</b> plexus exists, the vertebral artery of primates was not shown to have <b>a</b> direct <b>sympathetic</b> innervation and <b>a</b> neurogenic vasoconstrictor function is unlikely...|$|R
5|$|Once forces began {{assembling}} at Oswegatchie, Lorimier {{made arrangements}} with <b>a</b> <b>sympathetic</b> priest near The Cedars for the provisioning of {{supplies for the}} troops. With the assistance of some men of the 8th Foot, he strategically hid several shallow-draft boats, known as bateaux, near {{a point where the}} Saint Lawrence River could be crossed.|$|E
5|$|The 1951 film , {{based on}} Young's biography, portrayed Rommel in <b>a</b> <b>sympathetic</b> way, as a loyal, humane soldier and a firm {{opponent}} to Hitler's policies. The film played up Rommel's disputed {{role in the}} conspiracy against Hitler, while omitting Rommel's early association with the dictator.|$|E
5|$|Aymer Vallance was {{commissioned}} {{to produce the}} first biography of Morris, published in 1897, after Morris' death, as per the latter's wishes. This presented the creation of SPAB as Morris' greatest achievement. Morris's next biographer was Burne-Jones' son-in-law John William Mackail, who authored the two-volume Life of William Morris (1899) in which he provided <b>a</b> <b>sympathetic</b> portrayal of Morris that largely omitted his political activities, treating them as a passing phase that Morris overcame.|$|E

5|$|Female {{friendship}}s {{are central}} to both of Wollstonecraft's novels, {{but it is the}} friendship between Maria and Jemima, the servant charged with watching over her in the insane asylum, that is the most historically significant. This friendship, based on <b>a</b> <b>sympathetic</b> bond of motherhood, between an upper-class woman and a lower-class woman {{is one of the first}} moments in the history of feminist literature that hints at a cross-class argument, that is, that women of different economic positions have the same interests because they are women.|$|E
5|$|Lombardy {{noted the}} shock that Spassky was in after he resigned:While Fischer dashed for his car, Spassky {{remained}} glued to his seat. <b>A</b> <b>sympathetic</b> Lothar Schmid came over, {{and the two}} shifted the pieces about with Boris demonstrating his careless mistakes. The two were left wondering how Bobby could have squeezed a win from a position which a night of competent analysis by a renowned Soviet team had showed to be a guaranteed draw.|$|E
5|$|Since the {{newspaper}} lacked the necessary 25,000 lire to sponsor the race, the organizers consulted Primo Bongrani, <b>a</b> <b>sympathetic</b> accountant {{at the bank}} Cassa di Risparmio. He proceeded to solicit donations from all over Italy, and succeeded in raising sufficient money to cover the operating costs. The prize money came from a casino in San Remo after Francesco Sghirla, a former Gazzetta employee, encouraged them {{to contribute to the}} race. Even Corriere, La Gazzettas rival, donated 3,000 lire.|$|E

40|$|To our knowledge, no {{previous}} study has provided reliable data supporting a different modulation of the Neurovegetative system in essential hypotension. Our purpose was to provide, in essential hypotensive women compared to normotensives, evidence of <b>a</b> distinct <b>sympathetic</b> and parasympathetic cardiac control. Cardiovascular and autonomic indexes derived by impedance cardiography (heart rate, HR; pre-ejection period, PEP), photoplethysmographic technique (blood pressure, BP) and heart rate variability analysis (high and low frequencies power, HF and LF) were continuously collected during rest and mental stress condition. Hypotensives, compared to normotensives, exhibited prolonged PEP (low sympathetic tone) and elevated HF (high vagal involvement) during rest. In addition, they showed cardiovascular (reduced increases in BP and HR) and sympathetic (lower reductions of PEP) hypo-reactivity to the task. Furthermore, <b>a</b> lower <b>sympathetic</b> reactivity in hypotensiveswas associated to a poorer task performance. Essential hypotensionwas characterized by <b>a</b> low <b>sympathetic</b> and high parasympathetic tone. In addition, <b>a</b> reduced <b>sympathetic</b> nervous system reactivity suggests the main role of the Neurovegetative system in mediating the relationship between blood pressure and cognitive performance in hypotensives...|$|R

5|$|The lungs are {{supplied}} by nerves of the autonomic nervous system. Input from the {{parasympathetic nervous system}} occurs via the vagus nerve. When stimulated by acetylcholine, this causes constriction of the smooth muscle lining the bronchus and bronchioles, and increases the secretions from glands. The lungs also have <b>a</b> <b>sympathetic</b> tone from norepinephrine acting on the beta 2 receptors in the respiratory tract, which causes bronchodilation.|$|E
5|$|Unlike the {{majority}} of Trollope's triangles, Mary is not called upon to judge between a good suitor and a bad one, but between two good men. Gilmore is presented as <b>a</b> <b>sympathetic</b> and admirable character; the reader learns far less about Captain Marrable's character, and is given no reason why Mary should prefer him to his rival. To Trollope, a woman does not necessarily fall in love because of a man's merits; {{and it is very}} wrong for a woman to marry where she does not love, regardless of her suitor's worthy qualities.|$|E
5|$|At {{the age of}} seven, Goldman {{moved with}} her family to the Prussian city of Königsberg (then part of the German Empire), and she {{enrolled}} in a Realschule. One teacher punished disobedient students—targeting Goldman in particular—by beating their hands with a ruler. Another teacher tried to molest his female students and was fired when Goldman fought back. She found <b>a</b> <b>sympathetic</b> mentor in her German-language teacher, who loaned her books and took her to an opera. A passionate student, Goldman passed the exam for admission into a gymnasium, but her religion teacher refused to provide a certificate of good behavior and {{she was unable to}} attend.|$|E

5|$|Corentin and Madame du Gua, foils to {{the happy}} couple, plot and scheme {{endlessly}} {{to bring about}} the misery and downfall of those who will not love them. Du Gua is at first <b>a</b> <b>sympathetic</b> character, {{but by the end of}} the novel she is presented as sharing a face with a spirit from hell. She represents revenge and hatred chiseled from romantic injury, and has been noted as a rough sketch of the title character in Balzac's La Cousine Bette. Corentin, meanwhile, stands in contrast to Montauran's romantic nature as much as to Hulot's military prowess. Rebuffed by Marie and unable to wield the might of the commandant, Corentin relies on trickery and deception to achieve his ruthless ends.|$|E
5|$|In 1914 while {{designing}} the residence {{after the first}} devastating fire, Wright received <b>a</b> <b>sympathetic</b> letter from Miriam Noel, a fan of his architecture. Wright exchanged correspondence with the wealthy divorcee and met with her at his Chicago office. Wright was quickly infatuated, and the two began a relationship. By Spring 1915, Taliesin II was completed and Noel moved there with Wright. Wright's first wife Catherine finally granted him a divorce in 1922, meaning that Wright could marry Noel a year later. Although Wright admired Noel's erratic personality at first, her behavior (later identified as schizophrenia) led to a miserable life together at Taliesin. They married in November, 1923, but Noel left Wright {{by the spring of}} 1924.|$|E
5|$|In March 1975, Mugabe {{resolved}} to leave Rhodesia for Mozambique, ambitious {{to take control}} of ZANU's guerrilla campaign. After his friend Maurice Nyagumbo was arrested, he feared the same fate but was hidden from the authorities by Ribeiro. Ribeiro and <b>a</b> <b>sympathetic</b> nun then assisted him and Edgar Tekere in smuggling themselves into Mozambique. Mugabe remained in exile there for two years. Mozambique's Marxist President Samora Machel was sceptical of Mugabe's leadership abilities and was unsure whether to recognise him as ZANU's legitimate leader. Machel gave him a house in Quelimane although kept him under partial house arrest, with Mugabe requiring permission to travel. It would be almost a year before Machel accepted Mugabe's leadership of ZANU.|$|E

5|$|Marjorie Bowen's 1929 novel Dickon set {{the trend}} for pro-Ricardian literature. Particularly {{influential}} was The Daughter of Time (1951) by Josephine Tey. {{in which a}} modern detective concludes that Richard III is innocent {{in the death of}} the Princes. Other novelists such as Valerie Anand in the novel Crown of Roses (1989) have also offered alternative versions to the theory that he murdered them. Sharon Kay Penman, in her historical novel The Sunne in Splendour, attributes the death of the Princes to the Duke of Buckingham. In the mystery novel The Murders of Richard III by Elizabeth Peters (1974) the central plot revolves around the debate as to whether Richard III was guilty of these and other crimes. <b>A</b> <b>sympathetic</b> portrayal of Richard III is given in The Founding, the first volume in The Morland Dynasty series by Cynthia Harrod-Eagles.|$|E
5|$|Several {{characteristics}} {{about the}} Tribune made the newspaper an excellent vehicle for Marx to reach <b>a</b> <b>sympathetic</b> public across the Atlantic Ocean. Since its founding, the Tribune {{had been an}} inexpensive newspaper—two cents per copy. Accordingly, it was popular with the broad masses {{of the working class}} of the United States. With a run of about 50,000 issues, the Tribune was the most widely circulated journal in the United States. Editorially, the Tribune reflected Greeley's anti-slavery opinions. Not only did the Tribune have wide readership with the United States and not only did that readership come from the working classes, but the readers seemed to be from the progressive wing of the working class. Marx's first article for the New York Tribune was on the British elections to Parliament and was published in the Tribune on 21 August 1852.|$|E
5|$|Social {{commentary}} was {{a feature}} of Chaplin's films from early in his career, as he portrayed the underdog in <b>a</b> <b>sympathetic</b> light and highlighted the difficulties of the poor. Later, as he developed {{a keen interest in}} economics and felt obliged to publicise his views, Chaplin began incorporating overtly political messages into his films. Modern Times (1936) depicted factory workers in dismal conditions, The Great Dictator (1940) parodied Adolf Hitler and Benito Mussolini and ended in a speech against nationalism, Monsieur Verdoux (1947) criticised war and capitalism, and A King in New York (1957) attacked McCarthyism.|$|E
