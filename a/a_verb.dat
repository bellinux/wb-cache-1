5|$|A complex {{predicate}} is {{the combination}} {{of more than one}} element, more than one individual word, to convey the information involved in a single event. For instance, the event swim is conveyed in Wagiman using a combination of <b>a</b> <b>verb</b> ya- 'go' and a coverb liri-ma 'swimming'. There is no verb in Wagiman that, on its own, conveys the event of swimming.|$|E
5|$|Coverbs however, cannot inflect for {{person and}} cannot, in themselves, head finite clauses. If {{they are to}} act {{as the head of}} a clause, they must combine with <b>a</b> <b>verb,</b> thereby forming a bipartite verbal compound, {{commonly}} called a complex predicate.|$|E
5|$|Mayan {{languages}} {{have two}} sets of affixes that are attached to <b>a</b> <b>verb</b> to indicate the person of its arguments. One set (often referred to in Mayan grammars as set A) indicates the person of subjects of intransitive verbs, and of objects of transitive verbs. They {{can also be used}} with adjective or noun predicates to indicate the subject.|$|E
2500|$|In ergative–absolutive {{languages}} with grammatical case, {{the case}} {{used for the}} single argument of <b>an</b> intransitive <b>verb</b> and the object of <b>a</b> transitive <b>verb</b> is the absolutive, and the case used for the agent of <b>a</b> transitive <b>verb</b> is the ergative. In nominative–accusative languages, {{the case for the}} single argument of <b>an</b> intransitive <b>verb</b> and the agent of <b>a</b> transitive <b>verb</b> is the nominative while the case for the direct object of <b>a</b> transitive <b>verb</b> is the accusative.|$|R

2500|$|In an ergative language, {{the single}} {{argument}} ("subject") of <b>an</b> intransitive <b>verb</b> behaves like {{the object of}} <b>a</b> transitive <b>verb,</b> and differently from the agent of <b>a</b> transitive <b>verb.</b> That {{is in contrast to}} nominative–accusative languages, such as English and most other Indo-European languages, where the single argument of <b>an</b> intransitive <b>verb</b> ("She" [...] in the sentence [...] "She walks.") behaves grammatically like the agent of <b>a</b> transitive <b>verb</b> ("She" [...] in the sentence [...] "She finds it.") but differently from the object of <b>a</b> transitive <b>verb</b> ("her" [...] in the sentence [...] "She likes her.").|$|R
5|$|Mongolian has a complementizer {{auxiliary}} verb ge- {{very similar}} to Japanese to iu. ge- literally means 'to say' and in converbal form gež precedes either a psych verb or <b>a</b> <b>verb</b> of saying. As a verbal noun like gedeg (with n or case) it can form a subset of complement clauses. As gene it may function as an evidentialis marker.|$|E
5|$|Most Nahuatl {{varieties}} have {{a number}} of ways to alter the valency of <b>a</b> <b>verb.</b> Classical Nahuatl had a passive voice (also sometimes defined as an impersonal voice), but this is not found in most modern varieties. However the applicative and causative voices are found in many modern dialects. Many Nahuatl varieties also allow forming verbal compounds with two or more verbal roots.|$|E
5|$|Verbalisation {{involves}} re-analysing {{the entire}} coverb - including its suffix -ma, which serves merely {{to indicate that}} it is unmarked for aspect - as <b>a</b> <b>verb</b> root, and then to apply the usual obligatory verbal inflection affixes for person, number and tense. As there is no discrete morpheme {{that serves as a}} 'verbaliser', the process is one of conversion.|$|E

5|$|Mayan {{languages}} are ergative in their alignment. This {{means that the}} subject of <b>an</b> intransitive <b>verb</b> is treated similarly to the object of <b>a</b> transitive <b>verb,</b> but differently from the subject of <b>a</b> transitive <b>verb.</b>|$|R
25|$|A {{stands for}} a {{transitive}} subject, S for a subject of <b>an</b> intransitive <b>verb,</b> S for <b>a</b> subject of <b>an</b> active intransitive <b>verb,</b> Sₒfor <b>a</b> subject of <b>a</b> stative intransitive <b>verb,</b> and S for a subject of <b>an</b> intransitive <b>verb</b> with <b>a</b> non-canonically marked argument.|$|R
5|$|In this clause the adverbial, helehgüjgeer 'without saying ' must {{precede the}} predicate's complement, üünijg 'it-' {{in order to}} avoid {{syntactic}} ambiguity, since helehgüjgeer is itself derived from <b>a</b> <b>verb</b> and hence an üünijg preceding it could be construed as its complement. If the adverbial was an adjective such as hurdan 'fast', it could optionally immediately precede the predicate. There are also cases in which the adverb must immediately precede the predicate.|$|E
5|$|An infinitive form, {{that uses}} the plain form of the verb and the {{preposition}} to, is used for verbal clauses that are syntactically subordinate to a finite verbal clause. Finite verbal clauses {{are those that are}} formed around <b>a</b> <b>verb</b> in the present or preterit form. In clauses with auxiliary verbs they are the finite verbs and the main verb is treated as a subordinate clause. For example, he has to go where only the auxiliary verb have is inflected for time and the main verb to go is in the infinitive, or in a complement clause such as I saw him leave, where the main verb is to see which is in a preterite form, and leave is in the infinitive.|$|E
5|$|Most often, of course, the {{predicate}} {{consists of}} <b>a</b> <b>verb.</b> However, {{there are several}} types of nominal predicative constructions, {{with or without a}} copula. Auxiliaries that express direction and aktionsart (among other meanings) can with the assistance of a linking converb occupy the immediate postverbal position, e.g. uuž orhison drink- leave- 'drank up'. The next position is filled by converb suffixes in connection with the auxiliary, baj- 'to be', e.g. ter güjž bajna s/he run- be- 'she is running'. Suffixes occupying this position express grammatical aspect, e.g., progressive and resultative. In the next position, participles followed by baj- may follow, e.g., ter irsen bajna s/he come- be- 'he has come'. Here, an explicit perfect and habituality can be marked, which is aspectual in meaning as well. This position may be occupied by multiple suffixes in a single predication, and it can still be followed by a converbal Progressive. The last position is occupied by suffixes that express tense, evidentiality, modality, and aspect.|$|E
25|$|Chinese {{is a very}} {{analytic}} or isolating language, having {{almost no}} inflectional morphemes. It follows a similar sentence structure to English, frequently forming sentences in the order subject-predicate. The predicate can be <b>an</b> intransitive <b>verb,</b> <b>a</b> transitive <b>verb</b> followed by <b>a</b> direct object, <b>a</b> linking <b>verb</b> followed by <b>a</b> predicate nominative, etc.|$|R
40|$|This {{paper is}} the ¯rst {{of a series}} of papers dealing with the {{automatic}} classi¯cation of verbs and the automatic determination of the values of <b>a</b> <b>verb's</b> semantic features. Both tasks are in fact identical, as verb classes are nothing more than clusters of verbs with similar constellations of semantic features. Thus, being able to automatically determine <b>a</b> <b>verb's</b> class will enable us to pre-dict the constellation of semantic features inherent to that verb. Likewise, knowing the values of <b>a</b> <b>verb's</b> semantic features enables us to accurately predict <b>a</b> <b>verb's</b> class. Ultimately, the aim of this series is to arrive at a e±cient algorithm for classifying Japanese verbs. In order to achieve this goal, each paper in the series will pick up an article published by the leading journals in the ¯eld, and evaluate it's bene¯ts and drawbacks compared to other papers on the subject. The ¯rst article discussed is [Merlo and Stevenson 2001]...|$|R
25|$|This {{contrasts}} with nominative–accusative languages such as English, where the single argument of <b>an</b> intransitive <b>verb</b> and {{the agent of}} <b>a</b> transitive <b>verb</b> (both called the subject) are treated alike and kept distinct from the object of <b>a</b> transitive <b>verb.</b>|$|R
5|$|In English a {{sentence}} may {{be composed of}} one or more clauses, that may in turn be composed {{of one or more}} phrases (e.g. Noun Phrases, Verb Phrases, and Prepositional Phrases). A clause is built around <b>a</b> <b>verb,</b> and includes its constituents, such as any NPs and PPs. Within {{a sentence}} one clause is always the main clause (or matrix clause) whereas other clauses are subordinate to it. Subordinate clauses may function as arguments of the verb in the main clause. For example, in the phrase I think (that) you are lying, the main clause is headed by the verb think, the subject is I, but the object of the phrase is the subordinate clause (that) you are lying. The subordinating conjunction that shows that the clause that follows is a subordinate clause, but it is often omitted. Relative clauses are clauses that function as a modifier or specifier to some constituent in the main clause: For example, in the sentence I saw the letter that you received today, the relative clause that you received today specifies {{the meaning of the word}} letter, the object of the main clause. Relative clauses can be introduced by the pronouns who, whose, whom and which as well as by that (which can also be omitted.) In contrast to many other Germanic languages there is no major differences between word order in main and subordinate clauses.|$|E
5|$|There is also {{a debate}} in the {{linguistic}} literature whether Greenlandic has noun incorporation. This is because Greenlandic does not allow the kind of incorporation common in many languages in which a noun root {{can be incorporated into}} almost any verb to form <b>a</b> <b>verb</b> with a new meaning. On the other hand, Greenlandic does often form verbs that include noun roots. The question then becomes whether to analyse these verb formations as incorporation or as denominal derivation of verbs. Greenlandic has a number of morphemes that require a noun root as their host and which form complex predicates that correspond closely in meaning to what is often seen in languages that have canonical noun incorporation. Linguists who propose that Greenlandic does have incorporation argue that these morphemes are in fact verbal roots that must obligatorily incorporate nouns to form grammatical clauses. This argument is supported by {{the fact that many of}} the derivational morphemes that form denominal verbs work almost identically to canonical noun incorporation. They allow the formation of words with a semantic content corresponding to an entire English clause with verb, subject and object. Another argument is that the morphemes used to derive denominal verbs come from historical noun incorporating constructions that have become fossilized. Other linguists maintain that the morphemes in question are simply derivational morphemes that allow the formation of denominal verbs. This argument is supported by the fact that the morphemes cannot occur without being latched on to a nominal element. The examples below illustrate how Greenlandic forms complex predicates including nominal roots.|$|E

40|$|The Onomatopoeic verbs {{have the}} {{component}} of onomatopoeia, inclusive of derivational verb and derivational adjective. For instance, the derivational verbs that are derived by ‘-???/-??, -??, -??’ {{fall under the}} purview of the Onomatopoeic verbs. The Onomatopoeic verbs demonstrate their properties of syntax and semantics in sentence that they are comprised in. Therefore the onomatopoeic verbs depend on the other constituents of sentence. A large numbers of the Onomatopoeic verbs have the use of <b>an</b> intransitive <b>verb</b> and <b>a</b> transitive <b>verb</b> at the same time. It follows from what has been said thus far that the Onomatopoeic verbs that are inclusive of derivational verb and derivational adjective are not the ergative or the zero derivative but the use of <b>an</b> intransitive <b>verb</b> and <b>a</b> transitive <b>verb</b> at the same time. I have reviewed the difference between the verb of phonomimes and the verb of phainomimes, There is not a distinct difference between the two.
