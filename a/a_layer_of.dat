5|$|A {{much larger}} star, however, is massive {{enough to create}} {{temperatures}} and pressures needed to cause the carbon in the core to begin to fuse when the star contracts {{at the end of}} the helium-burning stage. The cores of these massive stars become layered like onions as progressively heavier atomic nuclei build up at the center, with an outermost layer of hydrogen gas, surrounding <b>a</b> <b>layer</b> <b>of</b> hydrogen fusing into helium, surrounding <b>a</b> <b>layer</b> <b>of</b> helium fusing into carbon via the triple-alpha process, surrounding layers that fuse to progressively heavier elements. As a star this massive evolves, it undergoes repeated stages where fusion in the core stops, and the core collapses until the pressure and temperature are sufficient to begin the next stage of fusion, reigniting to halt collapse.|$|E

5|$|It has {{a smooth}} and bright surface, with <b>a</b> <b>layer</b> <b>of</b> water {{surrounding}} {{the mantle of}} the planet, thought to be 100 kilometers thick. The smooth surface includes <b>a</b> <b>layer</b> <b>of</b> ice, while {{the bottom of the}} ice is theorized to be liquid water. The apparent youth and smoothness of the surface have led to the hypothesis that a water ocean exists beneath it, which could conceivably serve as an abode for extraterrestrial life. Heat energy from tidal flexing ensures that the ocean remains liquid and drives geological activity. Life may exist in Europa's under-ice ocean, perhaps subsisting in an environment similar to Earth's deep-ocean hydrothermal vents or the Antarctic Lake Vostok. Life in such an ocean could possibly be similar to microbial life on Earth in the deep ocean. So far, {{there is no evidence that}} life exists on Europa, but the likely presence of liquid water has spurred calls to send a probe there.|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: To our knowledge, sonographic {{findings}} in the neopharynx have not been well characterized. We describe our results and assess the role of sonography versus CT in patients who have undergone total laryngectomy. METHODS: We examined 25 patients (24 men and one woman; 44 – 78 years old) who had had a total laryngectomy. Sonography (with a 10 -MHz transducer) and contrast-enhanced CT were performed in all patients. We evaluated the normal shape of the neopharynx and assessed the accuracy of sonography versus CT in detecting tumor recurrence in the neck. RESULTS: The neopharynx appears as a round or ovoid structure on imaging studies. On sonograms, the neopharyngeal wall has five <b>layers</b> <b>of</b> alternating echogenicity: <b>an</b> innermost hyperechoic <b>layer</b> <b>of</b> superficial mucosa, <b>an</b> inner hypoechoic <b>layer</b> <b>of</b> deep mucosa, <b>a</b> middle hyperechoic <b>layer</b> <b>of</b> submucosa, <b>an</b> outer hypoechoic <b>layer</b> <b>of</b> muscle, and <b>an</b> outermost hy-perechoic <b>layer</b> <b>of</b> adventitia. On CT scans, the neopharynx appears as a three-layered struc-ture, with <b>an</b> inner hyperdense <b>layer</b> <b>of</b> mucosa, <b>a</b> middle hypodense <b>layer</b> <b>of</b> submucosa, and <b>an</b> outer isodense <b>layer</b> <b>of</b> pharyngeal constrictor muscles.
