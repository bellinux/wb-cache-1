5|$|Davis {{began the}} 2014–15 NBA season against the Orlando Magic {{with one of}} the best season opening {{performances}} of all time: 26 points, 17 rebounds, 9 blocks, 3 steals and 2 assists.

The performance also marked the first 26-point/17-rebound/9-block/3-steal effort since Hakeem Olajuwon during the 1989–90 NBA season. On November 8, against the San Antonio Spurs, he posted 27 points, 11 rebounds and 6 blocks, including the game-winning basket with 6.6 seconds remaining.

Davis entered the December 12, 2014 contest against the Cleveland Cavaliers with a player efficiency rating (PER) of 32.9, which would be the highest in NBA history if maintained for the full season.
