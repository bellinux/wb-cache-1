On Easter Monday, after a long weekend holiday shutdown, the water cleared and the river bottom could <b>actually</b> <b>be</b> seen, <b>looking</b> <b>like</b> a grey wool blanket. Tighter controls during the 1950s led to an improvement in water quality, and presently organisations such as Calder Future are working collaboratively with local industries and Yorkshire Water to promote more responsible use {{of the river and}} to re-establish lost wildlife along its banks.|$|R

40|$|Since the mid 80 ’s, {{focuses on}} fitness and the {{aesthetics}} {{of the human body}} have been increasing. In this group the interests of fitness, health and a good lifestyle make the foundation of choosing the theme of the following project. This project considers the growing tendency of fitness in the postmodern society of Denmark. The purpose of this is to understand the tendency and how people are impacted upon it and the body ideal. In {{order to be able to}} solve/explain this problem, different methods of qualitative forms of examinations are to be used. These include interviews and participating observations, which will help getting information about the minds of the informers and to observe a centre of fitness as a room of social interaction and impact. The collection of information will be used for analysis and discussion of the problem. The conclusion to this is that all of our informers are affected in one way or another by the tendency of keeping a lot of focus on fitness, body ideal and lifestyle. Two of the informers believe that they are stigmatized of the surroundings based on their overweight. One informer finds the body ideal to be unrealistic and make individuals require too much of themselves. One informer notices the body ideal but he doesn’t exactly strive to achieve it. The last informer believes that the body ideal is essential in order to motivate people to live a healthy and active life. He doesn’t find it unrealistic and his goal <b>is</b> <b>actually</b> to <b>look</b> <b>like</b> it...|$|R
40|$|Ā zbirka 48 Tracing flood {{histories}} is {{one example}} for the challenges of writing environmental histories in Central Europe. Two quite different sets of skills are needed. One set is the historian’s craft. The historian works at making sense of sources, constructing a compelling narrative from chaotic facts, tracing human appreciation of the Danube, human uses of the Danube, human interventions into the Danube …. The skills of the landscape ecologist, the hydrologist, the historical geographer, the geomorphologist and many other natural scientists are needed for the second building block. We need reconstructions of past riverine landscapes, ecosystems, of paleo-meanders {{and we need a}} chronology to answer questions of cause and effect – what was first, the intervention or the problem? Without knowing about the substrate of perceptions of historical actors, we cannot evaluate their perceptions for our narrative. How does the river the newspapers <b>are</b> talking about <b>actually</b> <b>look</b> <b>like?</b> Very different from how we perceive it today. Both are necessary, none is more important, both skills are of equal importance for an environmental history of the Danube River Basin. (Verena Winiwarter) In the immediate vicinity of the medieval Ljubljana there were extensive woodlands, stretching far into the hills in the southeast and northwest. … The greater part of Ljubljana’s supply with wood, however, came from areas further away, 15 – 20 kilometres from the city. … In the time of need, as during the threat from Ottoman incursions in 1478, when Ljubljana was strenghtening its fortifications, the king allowed the citizens unlimited use of wood from any forests in the immediate vicinity. … [A] unique source … dates back to 1510, the time of war between Austria and the Republic of Venice. Therein Emperor Maximilian … ordered his captain in Ljubljana that he should, together with the citizens, enclose or fence … forests and prohibit the cutting, so that the young trees could grow and the forests could flourish again, to provide for the needs of his city and castle in the future...|$|R

40|$|This thesis explores racial {{representation}} in the United States military throughout each rank level, within all active and reserve branches, to determine whether racial representation is related to rank. Using a census of the U. S. military from the Department of Defense, I establish a summary of what representation <b>looks</b> <b>like</b> overall, and more specifically, what it <b>looks</b> <b>like</b> within enlisted, warrant officer, and officer ranks. The citizen-soldier theory contends that failure {{on the part of}} the U. S. military to maintain representative forces threatens the legitimacy and credibility of democracy and could even become a threat to it (Armor and Gilroy, 2010 : 224). Much of the existing research on the military applauds its racially progressive policies and the (overall) proportionately representative forces it maintains. However, there is little scrutiny of what those forces <b>actually</b> <b>look</b> <b>like,</b> broken down by rank. If the military is to maintain a truly representative force of citizen-soldiers, airmen, sailors and Marines, then it must be representative among all levels. This research explores what contemporary military representation <b>actually</b> <b>looks</b> <b>like,</b> specifically asking, who is really giving the orders [...] Whites, Asians, Blacks or Hispanics...|$|R
