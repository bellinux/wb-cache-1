5000|$|The first stretched-wheelbase K cars, {{introduced}} in 1983, {{were not given}} their own platform letter, but had stretched wheelbases with New Yorker styling in front: the Chrysler Executive Sedan and Limousine. They were made at the St. Louis assembly plant, and held five and seven passengers, respectively. The pair were powered by a carbureted Mitsubishi 2.6-liter four-cylinder engine coupled to the usual Torqueflite automatic transmission, though {{in the last two}} years of the Limousine, a turbocharged (but not intercooled) Chrysler 2.2-liter four-cylinder engine was added. The stretched platform was not used by Mitsubishi when they upgraded the Mitsubishi Debonair from a rear-drive sedan to front-wheel drive despite engine sharing between Mitsubishi and Chrysler at the time. Standard features included air conditioning, cruise control, power brakes, front and rear cigarette lighters, front/rear divider and rear compartment with cabinet (Limousine), rear defroster, digital instrument panel, electronic voice alert, tinted glass on all windows, hood ornament, lights that went on with the dual horn, illuminated entry, a full lighting package inside, opera lights outside, dual power mirrors, power <b>antenna,</b> <b>locks,</b> windows, and driver's seat, FM stereo, [...] "luxury cloth" [...] seats, tilt steering, leather steering wheel, intermittent wipers, and padded landau roof.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the design of}} an integrated coupled-oscillator array in SiGe for millimeter-wave applications. The design focuses on a scalable radio architecture where multiple dies are tiled to form larger arrays. A 2 × 2 oscillator array for a 60 -GHz transmitter is fabricated with integrated power amplifiers and on-chip <b>antennas.</b> To <b>lock</b> between multiple dies, an injection-locking scheme appropriate for wire-bond interconnects is described. The 2 × 2 array demonstrates a 200 –MHz locking range and 1 × 4 array formed by two adjacent chips has a 60 -MHz locking range. The phase noise of the coupled oscillators is below 100 dBc/Hz at a 1 -MHz offset when locked to an external reference.

50|$|Lead spacewalker Bowen's {{first task}} was to remove a cable snag in the OBSS's pan and tilt mechanism. Bowen looped a tie wrap on two cables to relieve the snag and {{completed}} the task in less than 30 minutes, while Good began work with the batteries. Although the initial plan was to replace three batteries, the two astronauts managed to replace an additional fourth battery during EVA 2. The batteries Bowen and Good replaced had originally been launched in November 2000. After the battery work and cleanup of the area, Bowen and Good {{moved on to the}} new backup Ku band antenna on the Z1 truss. They tightened bolts holding the antenna's dish to its boom, closing a gap left there after EVA 1. Good performed a wiggle test and confirmed that two spacewalkers did not see any signs of motion in the antenna-mast interface. They then removed the <b>antenna's</b> launch <b>locks,</b> leaving the <b>antenna</b> ready to operate.|$|R
25|$|Powertrains were {{verbatim}} of the Camry, {{with the}} 3S-FC for the entry-level SL, and higher-end SLX and SLE models graced with the 3S-FE engine. An SLX option pack, {{known as the}} Executive was also available. The SL opened up the Apollo range with remote exterior mirrors, intermittent windscreen wipers, heated rear screen demister, remote trunk release for sedans and fuel filler door, a two-speaker radio cassette player and tinted side and rear glass. SLX variants were distinguished by their full wheel covers, {{as opposed to the}} SL model's steel wheels with centre caps. The Executive variant was not a stand-alone model, but an option pack for the SLX, adding power steering and automatic transmission. SLE equipment included the four-wheel disc brakes, variable intermittent windscreen wipers, a four-speaker stereo, body-coloured bumpers, dual odometers, automatic headlamp cut-off system, velour seat upholstery, centre back-seat armrest, power <b>antenna,</b> central <b>locking</b> with illuminated driver's door lock and front map lamps.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a novel scheme that quickly {{searches for the}} sweet spot of 1 : 2 array <b>antennas,</b> and <b>locks</b> on to it for high-speed millimeter wavelength transmissions, when communications to another antenna array are disconnected. The proposed method utilizes a modified genetic algorithm, which selects a superior initial group through preprocessing in order to solve the local solution in a genetic algorithm. TDD (Time Division Duplex) is utilized as the transfer method and data controller for the antenna. Once the initial communication is completed for the specific number of individuals, no longer antenna's data will be transmitted until each station processes GA {{in order to produce}} the next generation. After reproduction, individuals of the next generation become the data, and communication between each station is made again. The simulation results of 1 : 1, 1 : 2 array antennas, and experiment results of 1 : 1 array antenna confirmed the efficiency of the proposed method. The bit of gene is each 8 bit, 16 bit and 16 bit split gene. 16 bit split has similar performance as 16 bit gene, but the gene of antenna is 8 bit...|$|R
50|$|In {{the wake}} of Soyuz 25's failure to dock with the {{orbiting}} Salyut 6 space station, Soyuz 26 was launched {{with the aim of}} docking at the other port, the aft port. The two-man crew of Romanenko and Grechko was launched 10 December 1977, the first launch window following the failed mission. Grechko's presence on the flight arose out of the Soyuz 25 failure. A decision to no longer fly all-rookie crews made him the replacement engineer for Soyuz 26. The launch was almost delayed by bad weather in the Atlantic Ocean where the tracking ship Cosmonaut Yuri Gagarin was stationed. Once the ship's <b>antennae</b> were <b>locked</b> into position, the Soyuz launch was set to launch as the ship was needed to relay the docking procedure to mission control. The crew docked the next day, checked the seals and opened the hatches to the station, the first crew to enter the station. It was only upon the announcement of this successful docking that the Soviets revealed the station had a second port. The Soyuz 26 spacecraft remained docked until January 1978, when it landed the crew of EP-1.|$|R
5000|$|In late 1986, the 1987 Maxima was {{introduced}} with a freshened exterior and interior.

50|$|This time, {{the problem}} was traced to a {{defective}} rate gyro in the Agena which had gone undetected at launch. The control system caused the stage to rotate uncontrollably {{with the result that}} the propellants were pushed to {{the outer edge of the}} tanks by centrifugal force and could not drain down into the fuel feed lines properly. Unlike with Ranger 1, the Agena had not operated long enough to achieve any significant ISP and so the probe was left in an even lower orbit. Tracking <b>antennas</b> could not <b>lock</b> onto the probe or send it any commands, nor could the attitude control system stabilize it. Telemetry and instrument data were still received for a few hours, but eventually the orbit decayed too low and after only one day and 19 orbits, Ranger 2 reentered the atmosphere and burned up.|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: Line of Sight (LOS) Communication between {{airborne}} platform and ground control station is generally provided at C-Band. The RF front end Unit is using for frequency translation {{to make it}} enable for transmission in the air efficiently with reasonable <b>antenna</b> size. Phased <b>Locked</b> Loop (PLL) is used to provide frequency source used as Local oscillator for frequency translation. Fixed Frequency PLL is known as Phased locked Oscillator (PLO). To design PLO we mainly required 10 MHz Oscillator, Phase Frequency Detector Chip, Loop filter and Voltage controlled Oscillator (VCO). The Critical part of the PLO design is loop filter design. The Aim to design Separate PLO at 1430 MHz for UP-Conversion Chain and at 760 MHz for DOWN-Conversion Chain.

40|$|Laser {{frequency}} stabilization {{is a critical}} part of the interferometry measurement system of space-based gravitational wave observatories such as the Laser Interferometer Space <b>Antenna</b> (LISA). Arm <b>locking</b> as a proposed {{frequency stabilization}} technique, transfers the stability of the long arm lengths to the laser frequency. The arm locking sensor synthesizes an adequately filtered linear combination of the inter-spacecraft phase measurements to estimate the laser frequency noise, which can be used to control the laser frequency. At the University of Florida we developed the hardware-based University of Florida LISA Interferometer Simulator (UFLIS) to study and verify laser frequency noise reduction and suppression techniques under realistic LISA-like conditions. These conditions include the variable Doppler shifts between the spacecraft, LISA-like signal travel times, optical transponders, realistic laser frequency and timing noise. We review the different types of arm locking sensors and discuss their expected performance in LISA. The presented results are supported by results obtained during experimental studies of arm locking under relevant LISA-like conditions. We measured the noise suppression as well as initial transients and frequency pulling in the presence of Doppler frequency errors. This work has demonstrated the validity and feasibility of arm locking in LISA. Comment: 18 page...|$|R
2500|$|The 1981 {{model year}} {{represented}} a radical upgrade for VAM's top performance line. An all-new [...] "rally" [...] emblem design in all-lower case letters and computer-like typography appeared on both front fenders. The Rally AMX obtained a new [...] "waved" [...] stripe design {{located on the}} front edge of the hood and fenders with an integrated [...] "AMX" [...] leyend on the right front corner. It was very discreet compared to the last year's decals while the [...] "AMX over Rally" [...] and [...] "4.6 Litros" [...] stickers were removed. The Rally GT got also discreet [...] "GT" [...] stickers for the front of the hood bulge and [...] "GT 4.6/X" [...] stickers for the right corner of the rear spoiler. The previous year's [...] "American GT" [...] side decals and [...] "GT" [...] central rear spoiler emblem were deleted. Both versions shared all-new impressive Recardo-type reclining bucket seats with adjustable headrests, all new door panels in vinyl with cloth and carpet inserts but that no longer had map pouches, AMC's barred grille design used in the Eagle models made in aluminum instead of plastic, international symbols on the instrument cluster warning lights, the high beams switch integrated to the steering column, a new leather-wrapped sports steering wheel design with six fake Allen bolts on the horn button forming a hexagon, AM/FM stereo radio with four speakers as standard equipment and higher quality dashboard woodgrain panels. Mechanically, the coolant recovery tank and fan shroud became present. The optional equipment list was vastly improved; the set of power doorlocks and windows that debuted the year before in the American (Concord) line became available in the Rally. The GT got the electric antenna while the AMX included the rear spoiler with electric trunk release, both as standard equipment. The full optional equipment list for the Rally AMX was air conditioning, automatic transmission, intermittent wipers, reading dome light, rear defroster, sports steel wheels, electric <b>antenna,</b> power door <b>locks</b> and power windows; the list of the Rally GT was restricted to the electric locks and windows only {{while the rest of the}} accessories were standard except for the unavailable automatic transmission and air conditioning.|$|R
2500|$|Toyota Australia {{released}} {{the second generation}} Camry in April 1987. Local manufacture of the V20 had begun earlier in February at its recently acquired Australian Motor Industries facility at Port Melbourne, Victoria {{as a replacement for}} the Corona T140 and the Camry before it. Four-cylinder engine production and panel-stamping was undertaken at Toyota's Altona, Victoria plant, all part of a model localization and factory upgrades investment totalling [...] In fact, it was the first Camry made outside Japan, and is notable for being the most localized Toyota Australia product thus far with a lead time of less than six months, the shortest yet between start of Japanese and Australian manufacture. Higher levels of specification were fitted with the locally built 2.0-liter 3S-FE motor, but the imported 1.8-liter 1S-i unit distinguished base SE and CS cars. Both sedans and wagons were offered and either engine offered standard five-speed manual transmission, upgradeable to the four-speed automatic. Features standard at the base level SE comprised: AM/FM radio, centre console storage compartment, remote fuel filler release, intermittent windscreen wipers, digital clock. CS cars added a tilt steering column to which the CS-X adds a key lock warning system. The CS driver's seat has front height adjustment; the CS-X's front and rear height adjustment. The CS gets a two speaker AM/FM radio cassette player; the CS-X a four-speaker system and automatic electric <b>antenna,</b> plus central <b>locking,</b> variable intermittent wipers and center rear arm rest. The sedan-only Ultima grade gains power windows, cruise control, automatic transmission as standard, velour trim, and a nine-stage graphic equalizer for the audio system. A fleet-focused Executive pack based on the SE arrived in May 1988, adding automatic transmission, power steering, and air conditioning. In June 1988, the 2.5-liter V6 was introduced, being an imported fully optioned model from Japan sold in limited numbers and distinguished from local four-cylinder cars by its unique bumpers and trim. Coinciding with the August 1989 facelift, the 2.0-liter 3S-FC engine with carburetor superseded the imported 1.8. The updates brought minor adjustments inside and out, including improved suspension, steering, and headlights. In May 1991, Toyota made the fuel-injected 3S-FE version standard upon the carburetored engine's deletion, and the CS trim level became CSi. Coinciding with this change, power steering became standard fitment and Toyota Australia refreshed badging, including the attachment of the new corporate logo consisting of three overlapping ellipses to form the letter [...] "T". With the May 1991 update, the Ultima models gained a CD player, the first Australian-built car to offer this. Towards the end of the series, special editions were released, starting with the Spirit of February 1991. Then in September 1992, value-added CSi Limited and Olympic Spirit cars came onto the scene. Australian production ended in late November 1992, in time for production of the XV10 to commence on 2 December. The Used Car Safety Ratings, published in 2008 by the Monash University Accident Research Centre, found that V20 Camry models provide an [...] "average" [...] (3/5 stars) level of occupant safety protection {{in the event of an}} accident.|$|R
