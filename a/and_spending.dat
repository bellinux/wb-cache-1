40|$|Borrow <b>and</b> <b>spend</b> is {{a policy}} with several weaknesses. 1, it {{involves}} government borrowing something, that is money, which government can create in limitless quantities any time. 2, the “borrow” part of borrow <b>and</b> <b>spend</b> is deflationary: {{the opposite of the}} desired effect. 3, borrow <b>and</b> <b>spend</b> may result in interest rate increases and crowding out. To get round this, governments print extra money and buy back government securities. This is a charade: governments here are engaged in “print and spend” while pretending to effect “borrow and spend”. 4, when borrowings are paid back, the initial reflationary effect is reversed, thus borrow <b>and</b> <b>spend</b> does not have a permanent effect, whereas print <b>and</b> <b>spend</b> does. 5, {{one of the ways that}} borrow <b>and</b> <b>spend</b> works is that it supplies the private sector with additional assets (bonds which pay interest). This reduces “paradox of thrift” unemployment. But the private sector actually NEEDS or WANTS these assets, thus there is no need to pay interest to induce the recipients to accept those assets. Put another way, governments should issue zero interest bonds (i. e. cash) not interest paying bonds. 6, Borrow <b>and</b> <b>spend</b> expands the national debt, some of which will be held by foreigners. Paying interest to foreigners when no interest needs to be paid makes even less sense than paying such interest to natives. For the purposes of influencing unemployment and inflation, print <b>and</b> <b>spend</b> is a superior policy to adjusting interest rates because the latter is distortionary. ...|$|R
