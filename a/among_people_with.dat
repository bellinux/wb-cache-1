5|$|As for Casler's third {{possible}} explanation for nominative determinism, genetics, researchers Voracek, Rieder, Stieger, and Swami found some evidence for it in 2015. They reported that today's Smiths still tend to have the physical capabilities of their ancestors who were smiths. People called Smith reported above-average aptitude for strength-related activities. A similar aptitude for dexterity-related activities <b>among</b> <b>people</b> <b>with</b> the surname Tailor, or equivalent spellings thereof, was found, {{but it was not}} statistically significant. In the researchers' view a genetic-social hypothesis appears more viable than the hypothesis of implicit egotism effects.|$|E

Use of cigarettes is especially high in individuals diagnosed with schizophrenia, with estimates ranging from 80 to 90% being regular smokers, as compared to 20% of the general population. Those who smoke tend to smoke heavily, and additionally smoke cigarettes with high nicotine content. <b>Among</b> <b>people</b> <b>with</b> schizophrenia use of cannabis is also common.|$|E
5|$|A {{supportive}} {{environment and}} family generally gives those with Tourette's {{the skills to}} manage the disorder. People with Tourette's may learn to camouflage socially inappropriate tics or to channel the energy of their tics into a functional endeavor. Accomplished musicians, athletes, public speakers, and professionals {{from all walks of}} life are found <b>among</b> <b>people</b> <b>with</b> Tourette's. Outcomes in adulthood are associated more with the perceived significance of having severe tics as a child than with the actual severity of the tics. A person who was misunderstood, punished, or teased at home or at school will fare worse than children who enjoyed an understanding and supportive environment.|$|E
5|$|Antiretroviral {{treatment}} <b>among</b> <b>people</b> <b>with</b> HIV whose CD4 count ≤ 550 cells/µL is a {{very effective}} way to prevent HIV infection of their partner (a strategy known as treatment as prevention, or TASP). TASP {{is associated with a}} 10 to 20 fold reduction in transmission risk. Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) with a daily dose of the medications tenofovir, with or without emtricitabine, is effective in a number of groups including {{men who have sex with}} men, couples where one is HIV positive, and young heterosexuals in Africa. It may also be effective in intravenous drug users with a study finding a decrease in risk of 0.7 to 0.4 per 100personyears.|$|E

5|$|In general, {{people with}} Birt–Hogg–Dubé {{syndrome}} are at roughly seven times {{the risk of}} kidney cancer compared to the unaffected population. Estimates of the incidence <b>among</b> <b>people</b> <b>with</b> the disease range from 14%–34%. Rarely, it is associated with clear cell renal cell carcinoma and papillary renal cell carcinoma. If it develops in someone with BHD, renal cell carcinoma occurs later in life and has a poor prognosis. Though the types of tumor typically associated with BHD are considered less aggressive, cases of advanced or metastatic kidney cancer have been observed in people with the syndrome. Both benign and cancerous tumors can reduce kidney function over time as they grow larger.|$|E

25|$|Increased smoking <b>among</b> <b>people</b> <b>with</b> {{schizophrenia}} has {{a number}} of impacts on this population. One well-documented consequence is the increase in premature death <b>among</b> <b>people</b> <b>with</b> schizophrenia. Life expectancy <b>among</b> <b>people</b> <b>with</b> schizophrenia is generally 80-85% that of the general population, which results from both unnatural causes such as suicide but also natural causes such as cardiovascular disease, to which smoking is an important contributor. People with schizophrenia have a higher incidence of smoking diseases, with heart disease deaths 30% more likely and respiratory disease deaths 60% more likely. 2/3 of people with schizophrenia die from coronary heart disease, versus less than 1/2 of the general population. Ten-year coronary heart disease risk is significantly elevated in people with schizophrenia, as well as diabetes and hypertension.|$|E

40|$|Influenza {{immunization}} <b>among</b> elderly <b>people</b> <b>with</b> disabilities is {{a critical}} public health concern; however, {{few studies have examined}} the factors associated with vaccination rates in non-Western societies. By linking the National Disability Registration System and health service claims dataset from the National Health Insurance program, this population-based study investigated the seasonal influenza vaccination rate <b>among</b> elderly <b>people</b> <b>with</b> disabilities in Taiwan (N = 283, 172) in 2008. A multivariate logistic regression analysis was conducted to adjust for covariates. Nationally, only 32. 7 % of Taiwanese elderly <b>people</b> <b>with</b> disabilities received influenza vaccination. The strongest predictor for getting vaccinated <b>among</b> older Taiwanese <b>people</b> <b>with</b> disabilities was their experience of receiving an influenza vaccination in the previous year (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] = 6. 80, 95 % confidence interval [CI]: 6. 67 - 6. 93). Frequent OPD use (AOR = 1. 85, 95 % CI: 1. 81 - 1. 89) and undergoing health examinations in the previous year (AOR = 1. 66, 95 % CI: 1. 62 - 1. 69) also showed a moderate and significant association with receiving an influenza vaccination. Although free influenza vaccination has been provided in Taiwan since 2001, influenza immunization rates <b>among</b> elderly <b>people</b> <b>with</b> disabilities remain low.

40|$|The {{study was}} {{conducted}} in 55 female adolescents (age 16 - 22 years) to determine whether there is effect of the self acceptance on the self adjustment of <b>people</b> living <b>with</b> Lupus. Data collection was conducted via self-report questionnaire of self acceptance consisting of 39 items and self adjustment questionnaire consists of 45 items; both scales were developed based on Mental Health theory by Schneiders (1964). Data analysis was performed with the statistical techniques of correlation and regression using SPSS version 16. 0 for Windows. The result shows that there is a positive correlation between self-acceptance <b>with</b> self adjustment <b>among</b> <b>people</b> living <b>with</b> Lupus (r = 0. 760, p < 0. 001). Further regression analysis found the effect of self-acceptance to self adjustment <b>among</b> <b>people</b> living <b>with</b> Lupus (β =. 863, r 2 =. 577).
