All three ships had their propeller shafts lengthened, and their original bronze screws were replaced with larger steel propellers, though this did not improve performance.

5|$|Astatine's {{alpha decay}} {{energies}} {{follow the same}} trend as for other heavy elements. Lighter astatine isotopes have quite high energies of alpha decay, which become lower as the nuclei become heavier. Astatine-211 has <b>a</b> <b>significantly</b> <b>higher</b> energy than the previous isotope, {{because it has a}} nucleus with 126 neutrons, and 126 is a magic number corresponding to a filled neutron shell. Despite having a similar half-life to the previous isotope (8.1hours for astatine-210 and 7.2hours for astatine-211), the alpha decay probability is much higher for the latter: 41.81% against only 0.18%. The two following isotopes release even more energy, with astatine-213 releasing the most energy. For this reason, it is the shortest-lived astatine isotope. Even though heavier astatine isotopes release less energy, no long-lived astatine isotope exists, because of the increasing role of beta decay (electron emission). This decay mode is especially important for astatine; as early as 1950 it was postulated that all isotopes of the element undergo beta decay. Beta decay modes have been found for all astatine isotopes except astatine-213, -214, -215, and -216m. Astatine-210 and lighter isotopes exhibit beta plus decay (positron emission), astatine-216 and heavier isotopes exhibit beta (minus) decay, and astatine-212 decays via both modes, while astatine-211 undergoes electron capture.|$|E
5|$|Genetic {{differences}} exist between different racial groups which affect {{the risk of}} developing alcohol dependence. For example, there are differences between African, East Asian and Indo-racial groups in how they metabolize alcohol. These genetic factors are believed to, in part, explain the differing rates of alcohol dependence among racial groups. The alcohol dehydrogenase allele ADH1 B*3 causes a more rapid metabolism of alcohol. The allele ADH1 B*3 is only found in those of African descent and certain Native American tribes. African Americans and Native Americans with this allele have a reduced risk of developing alcoholism. Native Americans however, have <b>a</b> <b>significantly</b> <b>higher</b> rate of alcoholism than average; it is unclear why this is the case. Other risk factors such as cultural environmental effects e.g. trauma have been proposed to explain the higher rates of alcoholism among Native Americans compared to alcoholism levels in caucasians.|$|E

With the ground not ready, York played {{their first two}} home matches at Mille Crux, Haxby Road, before they took to the field at Fulfordgate for a 4–1 win over Mansfield Town on 20 September 1922. Fulfordgate was gradually improved; terracing was replaced banking {{behind one of the}} goals, the covered Popular Stand was extended to house 1,000 supporters, and a small seated stand was erected. By the time of York's election to the Football League in 1929, the ground was estimated to hold a capacity of 17,000. However, attendances declined in York's second and third Football League seasons, and the directors blamed this on the ground's location. In April 1932, York's shareholders voted to move to Bootham Crescent, which had been vacated by York Cricket Club, on a 21-year lease.

While the CBC had superior market placement (with respect to geographic coverage and experience with amateur sports), {{they lost the}} 2010 and 2012 Olympics to a joint CTV/TSN/Rogers $153 million bid. The Canadian Football League moved its broadcasting rights to TSN with Stursberg citing Commissioner Tom Wright's displeasure with the CBC's poor coverage of CFL games during the CBC 2005 lock-out. The CBC also lost broadcasting rights for The Brier and the Tournament of Hearts to CTV/TSN. Stursberg negotiated for Hockey Night in Canadas NHL rights with Gary Bettman and managed to extend their contract, but at <b>a</b> <b>significantly</b> <b>higher</b> price. The sixth chapter deals with CBC News which, as Stursberg explains, were scheduled to have the local newscasts eliminated. Instead, he initiated style and content reforms, taking effect in October 2009, including {{the creation of an}} internal newswire to provide stories suitable for TV, radio, and web services. He also commissioned an independent study to analyze a perceived anti-conservative bias in news coverage but the study found the coverage to be more conservative friendly than either the Global or CTV coverage. The chapter on Radio noted CBC Radio One's dominance in the Canadian radio market but CBC Radio Two's low ratings. Stursberg advocated for more local radio coverage, especially in the Hamilton area, and facilitated the programming change of CBC Radio Two by inserting more musical variety, specializing in Canadian music.|$|E

40|$|Introduction : Postero-medial {{release is}} the most common {{surgical}} procedure used to correct the deformity of clubfoot. It has been seen that despite a good correction immediately following the surgery, the long-term results are not satisfactory. Material and methods : A retrospective study was carried out in a total number 52 clubfeet in 36 patients treated by postero-medial release to assess the causes of failures. The mean duration after surgery was 5. 1 &#x 00 B 1; 1. 2 years, mean age at operation was 1. 1 &#x 00 B 1; 0. 5 years and mean age of patient at final follow up was 6. 9 &#x 00 B 1; 2. 1 years. The results were plotted and compared with different variables. Results : The results were successful in 36 and failure in 16 patients. <b>A</b> <b>significantly</b> <b>high</b> failure rate of 80 &#x 0025; was found when postero-medial release was done after 3 years of age as a sole procedure as compared to 25. 5 &#x 0025; only if age was less than 3 years (p&# 60; 0. 05). The patient compliance to follow bracing protocol showed <b>significantly</b> <b>high</b> failure rate of 52. 4 &#x 0025; in non-compliant patients versus 16. 1 &#x 0025; in compliant patients (p&# 60; 0. 05). <b>A</b> <b>significantly</b> <b>high</b> failure rate was also seen when bracing was not continued beyond 3 years after surgery (p&# 60; 0. 05). Neurological clubfoot had <b>a</b> <b>significantly</b> <b>high</b> failure rate (80 &#x 0025;) compared to idiopathic clubfoot (25. 5 &#x 0025;) (p&# 60; 0. 05). <b>A</b> <b>significantly</b> <b>high</b> failure rate was also noted when infection and skin necrosis lead to skin grafting or flap coverage as compared to those healed with dressings alone (p&# 60; 0. 05). Conclusion : Postero-medial release achieves best results in patients of less than 3 years of age and patients with compliance for bracing for at least up to 3 - 4 years following surgery and idiopathic clubfoot. Infection in clubfoot does not increase the failure rate unless it is severe enough to require plastic coverage. Any deviations from the above significantly increase the chances of failure of the procedure and hence can be labeled as the causes of failures of postero-medial release...|$|R
