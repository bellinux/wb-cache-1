5|$|The {{park was}} {{established}} {{on the former}} 90-acre estate of textile manufacturer Charles Pomeroy for whom it is named. The park entered the rolls of the Connecticut State Register and Manual in 1953, when it was listed at 84 <b>acres,</b> <b>that</b> figure expanding to 104 acres ten years later. The state added 91 acres through two separate purchases in 2001 and another 2.3 acres in 2007.|$|E
5|$|The three story mansion {{house was}} broken up into {{workshops}} and living quarters. The workshops were a chemistry lab, a print shop, a shipping room, a carpentry work area and machine shop facilities. The attic above the third story was devoted entirely {{for all the}} machines and associated tools necessary {{for the construction of}} airships. One first floor room was a large library with many books on aeronautics and science, where Myers researched often and brainstormed with his wife. There were out-buildings scattered throughout the five <b>acres</b> <b>that</b> contained gas engines, chemical labs, and furnace facilities.|$|E
5|$|As the 1995–96 season concluded, John McNamara {{sold the}} club to Premier Computers, headed by Alan McGrath. McGrath {{unveiled}} a {{plan to build a}} state-of-the-art stadium in the Dublin southwest suburb of Tallaght, and employed Pat Byrne as commercial manager. However, after a couple of weeks and a loss in {{the first game of the}} season, O’Neill was dismissed, while Eviston resigned in solidarity. Byrne was appointed manager of the side playing in Tolka Park once again, and they struggled through the season with the League's joint top scorer, Tony Cousins playing a leading role in avoiding relegation. In May 1997, Alan McGrath resigned as club chairman and was replaced by Brian Kearney, also of Premier Computers, who succeeded in acquiring planning permission for the new stadium in January 1998. However, the permission was delayed by objections until November 1998, by which time Joe Colwell had replaced Kearney as chairman and ended Premier Computers' involvement with the club. On the pitch, Mick Byrne guided Rovers to an Intertoto Cup spot in 1997–98 and an eighth-place finish, the next season. He was replaced by Damien Richardson, who managed the club during their stay at Morton Stadium before his dismissal in April 2002, after a disagreement with Colwell. By that time, a half-built shell of a stadium stood at the Tallaght site; Mulden International Ltd, recruited by Colwell to complete the project, had pulled out of building the stadium. They leased it to a separate company, transferring the responsibility, and focused on four <b>acres</b> <b>that</b> they had retained for themselves.|$|E

Currently the Cosumnes River Preserve uses {{both public and private}} lands as a location for migratory birds throughout the year as well preserving natural riparian oak woodlands, vernal pools, wetlands, and grasslands. The Elderberry longhorn beetle, California giant garter snake, and the Swainson's hawk are three threatened or endangered species that have been found living on the preserve.|$|E
25|$|In western North America, {{the current}} {{outbreak}} of the mountain pine beetle and its microbial associates has destroyed wide areas of lodgepole pine forest, including more than 16 million of the 55 million hectares of forest in British Columbia. The current outbreak in the Rocky Mountain National Park began in 1996 and has caused the destruction of {{millions of acres of}} ponderosa and lodgepole pine trees. According to an annual assessment by the state's forest service, 264,000 acres of trees in Colorado were infested by the mountain pine beetle at the beginning of 2013. This was much smaller than the 1.15 million <b>acres</b> <b>that</b> were affected in 2008 because the beetle has already killed off most of the vulnerable trees (Ward).|$|E

John Coles III built a mansion called Estouteville on his inherited portion, and Tucker Coles built Tallwood plantation on the upper <b>acres</b> <b>that</b> he inherited—both married daughters of Sir Peyton Skipwith, the only baronet in Virginia. Their sister Rebecca became the second wife of South Carolina planter Richard Singleton, with whom she had five children. Her sister Elizabeth (Betsy) never married. Mary Coles married Robert Carter and moved to his nearby Redlands plantation. Their sister Emily married Richmond lawyer John Rutherfoord, who owned Tuckahoe plantation in Goochland County and later served as acting governor of Virginia (1841–42). Their son John Coles Rutherfoord witnessed the Civil War's devastation, and his grandson W.A.R. Goodwin became an Episcopal minister and helped found Colonial Williamsburg.

500|$|Not all {{the land}} {{that made up the}} site of Fort Stanton was {{converted}} to public park land. In 1920, local African-American Catholics constructed Our Lady of Perpetual Help church on land formerly owned by Dr. J.C. Norwood, a local physician. After the remaining grounds of the fort were purchased in 1925, nearby residents reportedly [...] "walked family cows to Fort Stanton Park to graze before the school bell rang." [...] Today, the church still stands adjacent to the grounds of the park. The Washington D.C. Department of Parks and National Park Service jointly manage the 67 acres of park land that stand {{on the site of the}} fort today. D.C. authorities manage approximately 11 <b>acres</b> <b>that</b> contain a recreation center and ball fields, while the National Park Service manages the remaining acreage, which is mostly wooded and contains the remains of forts Stanton and Ricketts.

500|$|Declaring that {{it would}} make only all-talking films, RKO began {{shooting}} at the small facility FBO shared with Pathé in New York City while the main FBO studio in Hollywood was technologically refitted. In charge of production was William LeBaron, who had held the same position at FBO. The new company's two initial releases were musicals: The melodramatic Syncopation premiered on March 29, 1929. The comedic Street Girl debuted July 30. This was billed as RKO's first [...] "official" [...] production—first to follow the formal incorporation of Radio Pictures, first to be made in Hollywood. A few nonsinging pictures followed, but the studio's first major hit was again a musical. RKO spent heavily on the lavish Rio Rita, including a number of Technicolor sequences. Opening in September to rave reviews, it was named one of the ten best pictures of the year by Film Daily. Cinema historian Richard Barrios credits it with initiating the [...] "first age of the filmed Broadway musical". By the end of the year, RKO was making use of an additional production facility—five hundred <b>acres</b> <b>that</b> had been acquired near Encino in the San Fernando Valley as a backlot for exteriors and large-scale standing sets.|$|E
2500|$|Henning {{was again}} given free rein {{for a new}} show with no pilot needed, which he {{bestowed}} to colleague Jay Sommers due to his busy schedule. Sommers created the 1965 sitcom Green Acres, adapted from his 1950 radio program Granby's Green <b>Acres</b> <b>that</b> had starred Benaderet, thus making it a spinoff of her own television show. Benaderet filmed six appearances as Kate in the first season as both shows' casts intermingled on several episodes in a process dubbed [...] "cross-pollination".|$|E

The grape was a favorite of Dr. Walter Clore, the [...] "father of Washington wine". He encouraged the grape's planting throughout the Yakima Valley AVA in the 1960s and 1970s. In 1976, John Williams of Kiona Vineyard in what is now the Red Mountain AVA planted a few <b>acres</b> <b>that</b> would be used in 1980 to make the first commercial Lemberger wine produced in Washington.|$|E
2500|$|The term [...] "commons" [...] {{originates}} {{from the}} term common {{land in the}} British Isles. [...] "Commoners rights" [...] referred to traditional rights held by commoners, such as mowing meadows for hay or grazing livestock on common land held in the open field system of old English common law. [...] Enclosure was the process that ended those traditional rights, converting open fields to private property. [...] Today, many commons still exist in England, Wales, Scotland, and the United States, although their extent is much reduced from the millions of <b>acres</b> <b>that</b> existed until the 17th century.

2500|$|Within {{the region}} of Pomerol lies what is {{described}} as a bouttonière (or [...] "buttonhole") of unique blue-clay (known as molasse) sitting on top of band of sand rich in iron deposits that is known as crasse de fer or machefer. This is a small region of only about 20 hectares (50 <b>acres)</b> <b>that</b> is very atypical of the soils found in rest of Pomerol, but because the vineyard of the noted estate of Château Pétrus is planted on more than half of these hectares, its influence on the wine has been much discussed in the literature.
