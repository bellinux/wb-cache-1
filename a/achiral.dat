5|$|It is {{possible}} for chiral LC molecules to produce essentially <b>achiral</b> mesophases. For instance, in certain ranges of concentration and molecular weight, DNA will form an <b>achiral</b> line hexatic phase. An interesting recent observation is {{of the formation of}} chiral mesophases from <b>achiral</b> LC molecules. Specifically, bent-core molecules (sometimes called banana liquid crystals) have been shown to form liquid crystal phases that are chiral. In any particular sample, various domains will have opposite handedness, but within any given domain, strong chiral ordering will be present. The appearance mechanism of this macroscopic chirality is not yet entirely clear. It appears that the molecules stack in layers and orient themselves in a tilted fashion inside the layers. These liquid crystals phases may be ferroelectric or anti-ferroelectric, both of which are of interest for applications.|$|E
5|$|Tius has {{additionally}} {{developed a}} camphor-based auxiliary for <b>achiral</b> allenes that was {{employed in the}} first asymmetric synthesis of roseophilin. The key step employs an unusual mixture of hexafluoro-2-propanol and trifluoroethanol as solvent.|$|E
5|$|As already described, chiral liquid-crystal {{molecules}} usually {{give rise}} to chiral mesophases. This means that the molecule must possess some form of asymmetry, usually a stereogenic center. An additional requirement is that the system not be racemic: a mixture of right- and left-handed molecules will cancel the chiral effect. Due to the cooperative nature of liquid crystal ordering, however, {{a small amount of}} chiral dopant in an otherwise <b>achiral</b> mesophase is often enough to select out one domain handedness, making the system overall chiral.|$|E
5|$|The chiral pitch, p, {{refers to}} the {{distance}} over which the LC molecules undergo a full 360° twist (but note that {{the structure of the}} chiral nematic phase repeats itself every half-pitch, since in this phase directors at 0° and ±180° are equivalent). The pitch, p, typically changes when the temperature is altered or when other molecules are added to the LC host (an <b>achiral</b> LC host material will form a chiral phase if doped with a chiral material), allowing the pitch of a given material to be tuned accordingly. In some liquid crystal systems, the pitch is of the same order as the wavelength of visible light. This causes these systems to exhibit unique optical properties, such as Bragg reflection and low-threshold laser emission, and these properties are exploited in a number of optical applications. For the case of Bragg reflection only the lowest-order reflection is allowed if the light is incident along the helical axis, whereas for oblique incidence higher-order reflections become permitted. Cholesteric liquid crystals also exhibit the unique property that they reflect circularly polarized light when it is incident along the helical axis and elliptically polarized if it comes in obliquely.|$|E
25|$|Several {{strategies}} {{exist for}} constructing homochiral MOFs. Crystallization of homochiral MOFs via self-resolution from <b>achiral</b> linker ligands {{is one of}} the way to accomplish such a goal. However, the resulting bulk samples contain both enantiomorphs and are racemic. Aoyama and coworkers successfully obtained homochiral MOFs in the bulk from <b>achiral</b> ligands by carefully controlling nucleation in the crystal growth process. Zheng and coworkers reported the synthesis of homochiral MOFs from <b>achiral</b> ligands by chemically manipulating the statistical fluctuation of the formation of enantiomeric pairs of crystals. Growing MOF crystals under chiral influences is another approach to obtain homochiral MOFs using <b>achiral</b> linker ligands. Rosseinsky and coworkers have introduced a chiral coligand to direct the formation of homochiral MOFs by controlling the handedness of the helices during the crystal growth. Morris and coworkers utilized ionic liquid with chiral cations as reaction media for synthesizing MOFs, and obtained homochiral MOFs. The most straightforward and rational strategy for synthesizing homochiral MOFs is, however, to use the readily available chiral linker ligands for their construction.|$|E

And the oxazaborolidines were found to catalyze the rapid and highly enantioselective reduction of prochiral ketones in the presence of BH3THF. This enantioselective reduction of <b>achiral</b> ketones with catalytic oxazaborolidine is called Corey–Bakshi–Shibata reduction or CBS reduction.|$|E
25|$|In 1985, W. R. Roush and {{co-workers}} {{found out that}} tartrate modified allylic boronates offer a simple, highly attractive approach to the control of facial selectivity in reactions with chiral and <b>achiral</b> aldehydes. In the following years, W.R. Roush {{and co-workers}} extended this strategy to the synthesis of 2-Butene-1,4-Diols and Anti-Diols. This kind of reaction is known as Rouch asymmetric allylation.|$|E
25|$|This {{reaction}} {{is known as}} the Hajos-Parrish reaction (also known as the Hajos-Parrish-Eder-Sauer-Wiechert reaction, referring to a contemporaneous report from Schering of the reaction under harsher conditions). Under the Hajos-Parrish conditions only a catalytic amount of proline is necessary (3mol%). There is no danger of an <b>achiral</b> background reaction because the transient enamine intermediates are much more nucleophilic than their parent ketone enols. This strategy offers a simple way of generating enantioselectivity in reactions without using transition metals, which have the possible disadvantages of being toxic or expensive.|$|E
25|$|Chirality {{is another}} {{property}} that a DNAzyme can exploit. DNA occurs in {{nature as a}} right-handed double helix and in asymmetric synthesis a chiral catalyst is a valuable tool in the synthesis of chiral molecules from an <b>achiral</b> source. In one application an artificial DNA catalyst was prepared by attaching a copper ion to it through a spacer. The copper - DNA complex catalysed a Diels-Alder reaction in water between cyclopentadiene and an aza chalcone. The reaction products (endo and exo) {{were found to be}} present in an enantiomeric excess of 50%. Later it was found that an enantiomeric excess of 99% could be induced, and that both the rate and the enantioselectivity were related to the DNA sequence.|$|E
25|$|Two systems {{exist for}} the {{asymmetric}} hydrogenation of 2-substituted quinolines with isolated yields generally greater than 80% and ee values generally greater than 90%. The first is an iridium(I)/chiral phosphine/I2 system, first reported by Zhou et al. While the first chiral phosphine used in this system was MeOBiPhep, newer iterations have focused on improving the performance of this ligand. To this end, systems use phosphines (or related ligands) with improved air stability, recyclability, ease of preparation, lower catalyst loading and the potential role of <b>achiral</b> phosphine additives. As of October 2012 no mechanism {{appears to have been}} proposed, although both the necessity of I2 or a halogen surrogate and the possible role of the heteroaromatic N in assisting reactivity have been documented.|$|E

2500|$|If the {{requirement}} of flag-transitivity is relaxed to one of vertex-transitivity, while the condition that the tiling is edge-to-edge is kept, there are eight additional tilings possible, known as Archimedean, uniform or semiregular tilings.

2500|$|... α-quartz {{crystallizes}} in the trigonal crystal system, {{space group}} P3121 or P3221 {{depending on the}} chirality. β-quartz belongs to the hexagonal system, space group P6222 and P6422, respectively. These space groups are truly chiral (they each belong to the 11 enantiomorphous pairs). Both α-quartz and β-quartz are examples of chiral crystal structures composed of <b>achiral</b> building blocks (SiO4 tetrahedra in the present case). The transformation between α- and β-quartz only involves a comparatively minor rotation of the tetrahedra with respect to one another, without {{change in the way}} they are linked.|$|E
2500|$|It {{can also}} {{be thought of as}} a test for {{chirality}} of a physical phenomenon, in that a parity inversion transforms a phenomenon into its mirror image. [...] A parity transformation on something <b>achiral,</b> on the other hand, can be viewed as an identity transformation. All fundamental interactions of elementary particles, with the exception of the weak interaction, are symmetric under parity. The weak interaction is chiral and thus provides a means for probing chirality in physics. In interactions that are symmetric under parity, such as electromagnetism in atomic and molecular physics, parity serves as a powerful controlling principle underlying quantum transitions.|$|E
2500|$|The final {{approach}} involves {{the construction of}} MOFs that incorporate chiral reaction sites {{from a number of}} different components, potentially including chiral and <b>achiral</b> organic ligands, structural metal ions, catalytically active metal ions, and/or preassembled catalytically active organometallic cores. [...] This field is relatively new, and few examples exist of chiral asymmetric hydrogenation using these frameworks. [...] One of these was reported in 2003, when a heterogeneous catalyst was reported that included structural zirconium, catalytically active ruthenium, and a BINAP-derived phosphonate as both chiral ligand and structural linker. [...] As little as 0.005mol% of this catalyst proved sufficient to achieve the asymmetric hydrogenation of aryl ketones, though the usual conditions featured 0.1mol % of catalyst and resulted in an enantiomeric excess of 90.6–99.2%.|$|E
2500|$|A {{variety of}} {{substitution}} patterns are possible with ferrocene including substition at {{one or both}} of the rings. The most common substitution patterns are 1-substituted (one substituent on one ring) and 1,1′-disubstituted (one substituent on each ring). Usually the rings rotate freely, which simplifies the isomerism. Disubstituted ferrocenes can exist as either 1,2-, 1,3- or 1,1′- isomers, none of which are interconvertible. Ferrocenes that are asymmetrically disubstituted on one ring are chiral– for example [...] is chiral but [...] is <b>achiral.</b> This planar chirality arises despite no single atom being a stereogenic centre.

2500|$|The use of P,N ligands in {{asymmetric}} hydrogenation can {{be traced}} to the C2 symmetric bisoxazoline ligand. [...] However, these symmetric ligands were soon superseded by mono(oxazoline) ligands whose lack of C2 symmetry has in no way limits their efficacy in asymmetric catalysis. [...] Such ligands generally consist of an <b>achiral</b> nitrogen-containing heterocycle that is functionalized with a pendant phosphorus-containing arm, although both the exact nature of the heterocycle and the chemical environment phosphorus center has varied widely. [...] No single structure has emerged as consistently effective with a broad range of substrates, although certain privileged structures (like the phosphine-oxazoline or PHOX architecture) have been established. [...] Moreover, within a narrowly defined substrate class the performance of metallic complexes with chiral P,N ligands can closely approach perfect conversion and selectivity in systems otherwise very difficult to target. Certain complexes derived from chelating P-O ligands have shown promising results in the hydrogenation of α,β-unsaturated ketones and esters.|$|E
2500|$|The {{amino acids}} in an α-helix are {{arranged}} in a right-handed helical structure where each amino acid residue corresponds to a 100° turn in the helix (i.e., the helix has 3.6 residues per turn), and a translation of [...] along the helical axis. Dunitz describes how Pauling's first article on the theme in fact shows a left-handed helix, the enantiomer of the true structure.
