25|$|De Hory always {{denied that}} he had ever signed any of his forgeries {{with the name of}} the artist whom he was imitating. This is an {{important}} legal matter, since painting in the style of <b>an</b> <b>artist</b> <b>is</b> not a crime - only signing a painting with another artist's name makes it a forgery. This may be true, as Legros may have signed the paintings with the false names.|$|E

In an interview shortly before his death he said, [...] "Art is a response to life. To be <b>an</b> <b>artist</b> <b>is</b> to undertake a risky way to live, to adopt one of the greatest forms of liberty, to make no compromise. Painting is a form of love, of transmitting the years in art." ...|$|E

500|$|Also, Johns {{is portrayed}} as a kleptomaniac, a person who compulsively steals objects of little to no value. It is a {{reference}} to Johns's art style, as he usually uses objects from everyday life for his artwork. In a scene in the episode, Homer channels his anger into his art. The scene is {{a reference to the}} 1959 comedy horror film A Bucket of Blood, in which <b>an</b> <b>artist</b> <b>is</b> screaming at a piece of clay to be a nose. After having flooded Springfield, Homer tells Marge that the city is [...] "like Venice, without the black plague". The line refers to the outbreak of the bubonic plague that swept through Europe in the 14th century. In the scene, a lion can be seen swimming in the water. The notion that lions can swim is a reference to the season 2 episode [...] "Bart the Daredevil", in which the famous daredevil Lance Murdock performs a stunt which involves swimming lions.|$|E
500|$|In June 2011, Tom Hanks, who voiced Woody in the Toy Story series, {{implied that}} Toy Story 4 was [...] "in the works," [...] {{although}} it {{had not yet been}} confirmed by the studio. In April 2013, Finding Dory, a sequel to Finding Nemo, was announced for a June 17, 2016, release. In March 2014, The Incredibles 2 and Cars 3 were announced as films in development. In November 2014, Toy Story 4 was confirmed to be in development with Lasseter serving as director. In an interview, Lasseter stated that [...] " [...] {{lot of people in the}} industry view us doing sequels as being for the business of it, but for us, it's pure passion...One of the things that was very important for me as <b>an</b> <b>artist</b> <b>is</b> to continue directing. When I direct, I get to work with the individual artists, with the animators." [...] In August 2015, at the D23 Expo, Lasseter said that the film would focus on the romance between Woody and Bo Peep. Its story will be built on the fact that Bo Peep was absent in Toy Story 3, with Woody and Buzz Lightyear trying to find her and bring her back.|$|E

[...] "When there are no safe bets, that's when I feel my blood move." [...] He also shared how {{important}} the lyrics to this song are for him when he posted a photograph of Unorthodox Jukeboxs artwork via his Twitter account. [...] "Soon you guys will hear a song I wrote called When I Was Your Man. I've never been this nervous. Can't explain it," [...] he tweeted. Philip Lawrence explained the inspiration of the song: [...] "I think Bruno and I are both huge fans of older music, like Billy Joel and Elton John. We always loved those moments where you can sit at the piano and emote. Those intimate moments when <b>an</b> <b>artist</b> <b>is</b> so naked and vulnerable; you can’t help but be drawn to it. We always wanted to find a stripped down song like that, which is how that song came to be. The subject matter was real life; Bruno had experienced that, so we tried to say it in the best and catchiest way we could." ...|$|E

2500|$|My {{ultimate}} goal as <b>an</b> <b>artist</b> <b>is</b> {{to remind people}} of our shared humanity. I wish to give Indian culture back the humanity that has been taken from it by stereotypes created {{over the past five}} centuries. Neither the super-shaman nor the drunken-indian do anything to convey what we as a people feel. In my work, I search for the unconventional beauty one finds only in the TRUTH. It celebrates, it mourns and out outshines all else. I'm a California Indian- part traditionalist, part Disneyland. I want to express the passion, pain and reverence I feel as a contemporary Native person. -Gerald Clarke, 2000 ...|$|E
2500|$|In his lifetime, Cohl's {{most famous}} film was Le Peintre néo-impressionniste , made in 1910. [...] <b>An</b> <b>artist</b> <b>is</b> {{sketching}} a classically draped model holding a broom as a stick-figure when a collector storms in {{demanding to know}} the progress of his work. [...] The artist shows the collector a series of blank colored canvases (the film is color-tinted). As he gives their ridiculous titles, the collector imagines them being drawn on the canvas. For example, the red canvas is A cardinal eating lobster with tomatoes by {{the banks of the}} Red Sea. [...] The collector is soon so delirious that he buys every blank canvas he can see. Quite obviously, the artist is not a neo-Impressionist (the name taken from the latest vogue in Paris)--he's an Incoherent.|$|E

2500|$|Perpessicius {{integrated}} his {{condemnation of}} antisemitism {{in a radio}} broadcast of 1934. It reacted against objections that his Antologia... had {{made a point of}} adding newly-emancipated Romanian Jews among examples of Romanian literature, reaffirming an earlier rebuttal: [...] "one cannot exclude a poet [...] based only on his nationality paper. The nationality of <b>an</b> <b>artist</b> <b>is</b> of less interest. In the eventuality, it is that of the people whose language he uses in his writing. But what is certain is that the work is the distinguishing sign of art." [...] Alarmed by what he called [...] "a Jewish quota in literature", he gave positive evaluations to newer works by Jewish authors Ury Benador, I. Peltz and his colleague Mihail Sebastian.|$|E
2500|$|Lost in Time {{incorporates}} {{elements of}} 1970s soul music. For the album, Benét sought {{to expand on}} the classicist soul style of his previous album's title track, [...] "Love & Life", and produce an album-length homage to 1970s-era R Benét said of the album's style in a press release, [...] "People just {{need to have some}} feel good R in their lives. I want people to remember what music can feel like, and that desire took me {{all the way back to}} that time. My development as <b>an</b> <b>artist</b> <b>is</b> a direct result of being immersed in that era [...] When it comes to something that resonates in your soul, you have to have something constructed with live musicians". Prior to recording, he researched articles and documentaries about audio recording in that time period. In an interview for Blues & Soul, he discussed recording live in order to authenticate such a sound, stating ...|$|E
2500|$|In February 1986, the {{controversy}} was caused at the 28th Grammy Awards {{by the absence}} of Whitney Houston's name for the Best New Artist. Although Whitney Houston was her debut album released in 1985 and many people bet that she would be crowned Best New Artist, she was not nominated in that category because of her disqualification as a new artist. Upon hearing that Houston would be denied the opportunity to compete in the Best New Artist category for 1985, Clive Davis, then the president of Arista Records, sent a letter of complaint to Michael Greene, the president of the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences (NARAS), and had been told that [...] "Whitney was banished from the circle of newcomers because she had appeared as a duet guest vocalist on one song on Jermaine Jackson's album, and one on the comeback album by Teddy Pendergrass, both in the preceding year (1984)." [...] He claimed that [...] "Whitney was simply an unknown vocalist making a 'cameo' appearance on just one of eight or nine songs contained in a major artist's album. She was not even a member of a continuing artistic duo. [...] Whitney was merely a featured vocalist, not the artist, and certainly not {{the focal point of the}} song." [...] But Green replied to him, writing [...] "The rule that disqualified Whitney is perfectly clear. It reads: <b>An</b> <b>artist</b> <b>is</b> not eligible in the best new artist category if the artist had label credit or album credit, even if not as a featured artist, in a previous awards' year." ...|$|E

60|$|If I ventured {{on a bit}} of advice, which I {{feel most}} {{reluctant}} to do, {{it would be to}} the effect that while one should always study the method of a great artist, one should never imitate his manner.
