5|$|Independently of Schmid's actions, another {{figure has}} also been {{credited}} with ensuring Gisela took place. Heinz-Wolfgang Schnaufer—who was to the end the war as the most successful night fighter ace on 121 aerial victories—was said to have attempted to gain support for a like-minded offensive. Schnaufer pursued RAF bombers regularly to the English coast, or least {{the other side of}} the frontline. He experienced a lack of British interference beyond German-held territory. He recalled that he could fly <b>around</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> it was peace time, since all British jamming and interference stopped immediately once he was in Allied airspace.|$|E
5|$|Schnaufer's {{greatest}} one-night {{success and}} {{the second time he}} became an ace-in-a-day was on 21 February 1945, when he claimed nine Lancaster heavy bombers in the course of one day. Two were claimed {{in the early hours of}} the morning and a further seven, in just 19 minutes, in the evening between 20:44 and 21:03. Schnaufer was one of the influential figures that instigated a brief return to mass intruder operations over England named Operation Gisela. General der Nachtjagd (General of Night Fighters), was Generalleutnant Schmid, commanding I. Jagdkorps and Kammhuber, commanding XII. Fliegerkorps, and de facto command-in-chief of the German Night Fighter Force until November 1943, had long since desired to return to intruder operations over Bomber Command bases in England. The proposals met resistance from Hans-Jürgen Stumpff, Chief of the General Staff. Eventually, in October 1944, Schmid won support from Streib, Inspekteur der Nachtjagd, to begin planning an operation. Schnaufer voiced his support also. In his experience, he had regularly pursued RAF bombers to the English coast, or least the other side of the frontline. In British airspace, and over territory the Germans did not control, he experienced a lack of radar interference. Schnaufer recalled that he could fly <b>around</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> it was peace time, since all British jamming and interference stopped immediately once he was in Allied airspace.|$|E
25|$|Fish {{are caught}} by jigging. The hunter cuts a square {{hole in the}} ice on the lake and fishes using a fish lure and spear. Instead of using a hook on a line, Inuit use a fake fish {{attached}} to the line. They lower it {{into the water and}} move it <b>around</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> it is real. When the live fish approach it, they spear the fish before it has a chance to eat the fake fish.|$|E

25|$|Around 1848 a {{group of}} volunteers from the Mexican–American War were {{eventually}} discharged and settled in San Francisco. Many of them were from New York City gangs from the Five Points and Bowery districts. About sixty of them organized into a gang called the Hounds, paraded <b>around</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> they were military, and even creating a headquarters named Tammany Hall within a tent on Kearney Street. In 1849, these thugs began to call themselves the Regulators as they harassed Mexicans and those of Spanish origin, and extorted money from local businesses for protection services. Anyone who would not pay was likely to lose a nose, ear, or suffer greater bodily injury. However, after {{a group of}} 230 men organized into a militia and confronted the Hounds with possible arrest, they quickly fled from San Francisco.|$|E
500|$|You need a {{character}} {{to pose a}} problem or give out a quest or be a barrier of some kind. I don't like to make the [...] outright say [...] "I need you to do X, then I'll give you Y"...– it makes the character into an automated quest kiosk. I like the characters to come off like people actually do – they don't say [...] "hi" [...] when strangers come knocking, they say [...] "who the hell are you?" [...] or they're expecting you and know more than they let on, or they don't care.

500|$|The {{piece is}} called [...] "Blueprint for a Landscape" [...] and {{consists}} of a dark-blue landscape of things being blown <b>around</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> by an incoming train. A New York Times reporter described it as [...] "fragmented images of scaffolding, birds, chairs and leaves, digitally collaged." [...] Another piece, in simple blue-and-white colors, consists of depictions of billowing sheets of paper. The work also serves the practical purpose of helping navigation, as the sheets are more closely packed together near the exits than {{in the middle of}} the station. The work features familiar objects—sheets of paper, scaffolding, birds, trees, and foliage—caught up in a whirlwind. Each entrance features a different shade of blue and a blueprint-style vector line design, a visual theme that is integrated with the architecture.|$|E

500|$|Speaking {{shortly after}} the overdubbing sessions, Spector {{said that he had}} asked whether any of the Beatles would like to help him produce the album, but none of them had wanted to. He also said that his hand was forced into {{remixing}} [...] "The Long and Winding Road" [...] due to the poor quality of Lennon's bass playing. Others agreed: in his book Revolution in the Head Beatles scholar Ian MacDonald wrote: [...] "The song was designed as a standard to be taken up by mainstream balladeers. [...] It features some atrocious bass-playing by Lennon, prodding clumsily <b>around</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> uncertain of the harmonies and making many comical mistakes. Lennon's crude bass playing on 'The Long and Winding Road,' though largely accidental, amounts to sabotage when presented as finished work." [...] Spector said that McCartney was being hypocritical in his criticism: [...] "Paul had no problem picking up the Academy Award for the Let It Be movie soundtrack, nor did he have any problem in using my arrangement of the string and horn and choir parts when he performed it during 25 years of touring on his own. If Paul wants to get into a pissing contest about it, he's got me mixed up with someone who gives a shit." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{the ninth}} series, Harry reinstates Lucas {{as chief of}} Section D; this makes Lucas {{responsible}} for the integration of two new team members into the section, Beth Bailey (Sophia Myles) and Dimitri Levendis (Max Brown). Vaughn returns and hands Lucas a briefcase with possessions from his life before MI5, including photographs of him and Maya Lahan. When he visits her, however, she is so shocked at his reappearance and angry over his letting her believe him dead that at first she wants {{nothing to do with}} him. Later, Vaughn promises to leave Lucas alone in exchange for an MI5 file on [...] "Albany"; Lucas eventually hands him what he believes is the file. Believing he is free from Vaughn, Lucas persuades Maya to restart their relationship. However, it is revealed the file was not Albany, though it leads to the location of the actual file. Vaughn forces Lucas to find the file, which is in the possession of former Section D member Malcolm Wynn-Jones (Hugh Simon). After convincing Malcolm to give him the file, Lucas hands it over to Vaughn, but it is soon discovered that this file, too, is a fake, and Malcolm has abandoned the house where he and Lucas had met. To force Lucas to continue seeking the file hand Vaughn kidnaps Maya. By this time, Harry Pierce has discovered that Lucas is not who he claims to be. Arrested and questioned, Lucas admits his true identity and his past, but convinces Harry to save Maya. A mortally wounded Vaughn is able to [...] "wake up" [...] Lucas' true persona, who he was before MI5. Believing Harry may not honour the deal they have worked out, Lucas intends to leave the country after getting his hands on the Albany file. The file is revealed to contain directions for building a genetic weapon that Vaughn has agreed to sell to the Chinese. After Lucas acquires the real file from Harry in exchange for team member Ruth Evershed, whom he has kidnapped, Maya is killed while he is trying to escape with her. He delivers the file to the Chinese agents anyway and intends to kill Harry for revenge. During their roof-top confrontation, Lucas learns that Albany is an elaborate deception; the genetic weapon is unworkable. Lucas then forces Harry to turn <b>around,</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> he is about to execute him. Instead, Lucas throws himself from the roof, to his death.|$|E
