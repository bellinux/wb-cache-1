5|$|Heinrich Kreutz {{studied the}} orbits of the three great comets, and {{developed}} {{the idea that the}} three comets were fragments of a much larger progenitor comet which had broken up <b>at</b> <b>an</b> <b>earlier</b> perihelion passage. The fragmentation of the Great Comet of 1882 itself demonstrated that this was plausible. It is now thought that the Great Comet of 1882 is a fragment of X/1106 C1, and that Comet du Toit (C/1945 X1) and Comet Ikeya–Seki (C/1965 S1) are two of its sister fragments.|$|E
5|$|At least 40% {{of people}} with aphthous {{stomatitis}} have a positive family history, suggesting {{that some people are}} genetically predisposed to suffering with oral ulceration. HLA-B12, HLA-B51, HLA-Cw7, HLA-A2, HLA-A11, and HLA-DR2 are examples of human leukocyte antigen types associated with aphthous stomatitis. However, these HLA types are inconsistently associated with the condition, and also vary according to ethnicity. People who have a positive family history of aphthous stomatitis tend to develop a more severe form of the condition, and <b>at</b> <b>an</b> <b>earlier</b> age than is typical.|$|E

5|$|Australia's lower order batted the {{tourists}} into {{control on the}} second morning. Despite the loss of Lindwall for 15 at 275/8, Tallon kept on batting, supported by Johnston and Toshack, who scored their highest Test scores. Australia's wicket-keeper put on 45 with Johnston—who scored 29— before becoming Bedser's second victim for the morning. Toshack then joined Johnston and the last pair put on 30 more runs before Johnston was stumped from Wright's leg spin. Yardley was later criticised for not bringing Wright into the attack <b>at</b> <b>an</b> <b>earlier</b> stage, as the Australian tail were dealing well with the English pacemen. Bedser was the most successful of the bowlers, ending with 4/100 from 43 overs, while debutant Coxon took 2/90 from 35 overs.|$|E
5|$|Following {{seven months}} in Mexico, Middleton's return to Galveston brought a special anticipation. He had {{proposed}} to Jerusha Collins <b>at</b> <b>an</b> <b>earlier</b> time, and renewed the proposal upon his return. The couple was married on 6 January 1915, and this {{allowed them to}} be in New Orleans two days later {{with other members of}} Middleton's unit for the one hundredth anniversary of the Battle of New Orleans in which the 7th Regiment had served a century earlier. After a week in New Orleans, the couple returned to Galveston, and were invited to move into the Hagemann's house, where they were given a large upstairs room.|$|E
5|$|Following the Reformation gains (the Warsaw Confederation of 1573 was the {{culmination}} of the unique in Europe religious toleration processes), the Catholic Church embarked on an ideological counter-offensive and Counter-Reformation claimed many converts from Protestant circles. Disagreements over and difficulties with the assimilation of the eastern Ruthenian populations of the Commonwealth had become clearly discernible. <b>At</b> <b>an</b> <b>earlier</b> stage (from the late 16th century), they manifested themselves in the religious Union of Brest, which split the Eastern Christians of the Commonwealth, and on the military front, in a series of Cossack uprisings.|$|E

5|$|In 631 Anna was {{probably}} at the Suffolk village of Exning, an important settlement with royal connections, and, {{according to the}} Liber Eliensis, the birthplace of his daughter Æthelthryth. By tradition, Æthelthryth {{is said to have}} been baptised at Exning in a pool known as St Mindred's Well. Exning was an important place strategically, as it stood just on the East Anglian side of the Devil's Dyke, a major earthwork stretching between the Fen edge and the headwaters of the River Stour, built <b>at</b> <b>an</b> <b>earlier</b> date to defend the East Anglian region from attack. An early Anglo-Saxon cemetery discovered there suggests the existence of an important site nearby, possibly a royal estate or regio.|$|E

However, {{it is also true that}} her campaign ignored earlier private warnings about Hsu and that Clinton was the largest recipient of bundled donations from Hsu.|$|E
5|$|Not {{only did}} Sorabji, {{who had not}} written any music since 1968, return to {{composition}} {{as a result of}} Hinton's interest in his work, but on 24 March 1976 he gave the pianist Yonty Solomon permission to play his works in public (although it has been claimed that Michael Habermann received tentative approval <b>at</b> <b>an</b> <b>earlier</b> date). Several recitals ensued and led to the making of a television documentary on Sorabji, which was broadcast in 1977. The images in it consisted mostly of still photographs of his house; there was just one brief shot of Sorabji waving to the departing camera crew.|$|E

5|$|On 28 August 1943, Mackay {{once again}} assumed command of New Guinea Force. This time, {{important}} operations were being {{undertaken in the}} Battle of Finschhafen and Mackay's period of command was marred by disagreements with General Douglas MacArthur's staff over the reinforcement of Finschhafen. Junior commanders felt that Mackay {{should have been more}} forceful, and should have enlisted the help of his superior, Blamey, <b>at</b> <b>an</b> <b>earlier</b> stage. Blamey agreed with them, feeling that his old colleague was slowing down, and no longer possessed the vigour required for the campaign in New Guinea. Mackay left New Guinea in November 1943, handing over command of New Guinea Force to Lieutenant General Sir Leslie Morshead, and on 20 January 1944 Mackay relinquished command of Second Army and New Guinea Force.|$|E
5|$|The {{reason for}} this {{agreement}} {{is thought to have}} been the threat posed to Áedán, and also to Áed, by Báetán mac Cairill. Báetán is said to have forced the king of Dál Riata to pay homage to him at Rosnaree on Islandmagee. Áedán is thought to be the king in question, and Ulster sources say that Báetán collected tribute from Scotland. Following Báetán's death in 581, the Ulstermen abandoned the Isle of Man, which they had captured in Báetán's time, perhaps driven out by Áedán who is recorded as fighting there c. 583. Earlier, c. 580, Áedán is said to have raided Orkney, which had been subject to Bridei son of Maelchon, King of the Picts, <b>at</b> <b>an</b> <b>earlier</b> date.|$|E
5|$|These modernizations {{have been}} criticized by some naval historians, given that not only these ships would {{eventually}} prove to be inferior to the British battleships {{they were meant to}} face (namely the Queen Elizabeth-class), since by the time the decision to proceed was taken a war between Italy and the United Kingdom seemed more likely, but also because the cost of the reconstruction would be not much less than the cost of building a brand new Littorio-class battleship; moreover, the reconstruction work caused bottlenecks in the providing of steel plates, that caused substantial delays {{in the construction of the}} modern battleships, which otherwise might have been completed <b>at</b> <b>an</b> <b>earlier</b> date.|$|E

(Boromir is given the latter title <b>at</b> <b>an</b> <b>earlier</b> point in the storyline, and in The Two Towers he is {{referred}} to as Captain-General of Gondor and High Warden of the White Tower.) After his father's death, Faramir became the Steward of Gondor, but only briefly as he laid down his office at the crowning of Aragorn; Tolkien stated that it was Denethor who was the last of the Ruling Stewards. Later Aragorn renewed Faramir's hereditary appointment as Steward to the King, and granted him the titles of the Prince of Ithilien and Lord of Emyn Arnen.|$|E
5|$|A complex {{mixture of}} genetic and {{environmental}} factors influences {{the risk of the}} development of alcoholism. Genes that influence the metabolism of alcohol also influence the risk of alcoholism, and may be indicated by a family history of alcoholism. One paper has found that alcohol use at an early age may influence the expression of genes which increase the risk of alcohol dependence. Individuals who have a genetic disposition to alcoholism {{are also more likely to}} begin drinking <b>at</b> <b>an</b> <b>earlier</b> age than average. Also, a younger age of onset of drinking is associated with an increased risk of the development of alcoholism, and about 40 percent of alcoholics will drink excessively by their late adolescence. It is not entirely clear whether this association is causal, and some researchers have been known to disagree with this view.|$|E
5|$|For {{his service}} to the Indian nation, the {{president}} of India awarded Manekshaw a Padma Vibhushan in 1972 and conferred upon him the rank of field marshal, a first, on 3 January 1973.

Manekshaw retired from active service a fortnight later on 15 January 1973 after a career of nearly four decades; he settled down with his wife Silloo in Coonoor, the civilian town next to Wellington Cantonment where he had served as commandant of the Defence Services Staff College, <b>at</b> <b>an</b> <b>earlier</b> time in his career. Popular with Gurkha soldiers, Nepal fêted Manekshaw as an honorary general of the Nepalese Army in 1972.
