The effect of trade diversion owing to the <b>Andean</b> <b>Pact</b> with its common external tariff and price band system against non-Andean products was examined for soybean and soybean meal imports into Venezuela historically an important market for U.

In 2003 / 04, the United States and Mercosur members of Brazil, Argentina, and Paraguay accounted for 94 percent of the $ 30 billion of world soybean and meal exports, but supplied little to Venezuela. A partial equilibrium, deterministic, and Armington-type model of the Venezuelan market for soybeans and meal was formulated by combining tariffs and the Andean price band variable levy into a single price wedge. Model results suggest that a combined Mercosur and Andean customs union under either a high or a low world soybean product price scenario would noticeably benefit Mercosur suppliers {{at the expense of}} the United States as well as adversely affect domestic Venezuelan producers (soybean processors) and fellow Andean member Bolivia.

40|$|Is {{world trade}} {{becoming}} more regionalized, {{as a result}} of preferential rrangements such as NAFTA, the <b>Andean</b> <b>Pact</b> and MERCOSUR? If so, is this deviation from the principle of MFN (non-discriminatory trade policies) good or bad? This paper attempts to answer both questions. Using the gravity model to examine bilateral trade patterns throughout the world, we find evidence of trading blocs in the Western Hemisphere and elsewhere, as in earlier work. Intra-regional trade is greater than could be explained by natural determinants: the proximity of a pair of countries, their sizes and GNP/capitas, and whether they share a common border or a common language. Within the Western Hemisphere, MERCOSUR and the <b>Andean</b> <b>Pact</b> countries appear to function as significantly independent trading areas, but NAFTA much less so (as of 1990). The intra-regional trade bias within MERCOSUR increased the most rapidly during the 1980 s. In East Asia, on the other hand, increased intra-regional trade can be explained entirely by the rapid growth of the economies. We then turn from the econometrics to an analysis of economic welfare. Krugman has supplied an argument against a world of three trading blocs (that they would be protection-ist), in a model that assumes no transport costs. He has supplied another argument in favor of trading blocs, provided the blocs are drawn along 'natural ' geographic lines, in a model that assumes prohibitively high transportation costs between continents.

40|$|The present article can {{be placed}} {{within the context of}} an {{analysis}} of the Foreign Relations of the European Union and the Member Countries of the Cartagena Accord or <b>Andean</b> <b>Pact.</b> In {{the first half of the}} article an analysis is carried out of the legal framework within which the foreign relations of both the European Union and <b>Andean</b> <b>Pact</b> countries are developed together with some observations on the whole context of the new Agreement signed on the 15 th April 1993. The evolutionary process in the realm of trade relations is a developed theme as well as the implications of the application of the Generalized System of Preferences as a principal mechanism of cooperation with the Andean region. Finally, this first half concludes presenting an exhaustive analysis of investment flows. The second part of the article consists of the study of development assistance as well as economic cooperation. As far as development assistance goes, we can observe in detail what such action together with its restructuring has meant for the Developing Countries. As for economic cooperation, we can confirm that these mechanisms have not achieved those previously-established objectives, and have led to reiterated complaints on behalf of the countries of the Andean region. Finally, the article concludes with the presentation of final observations and offers three reasons which call for the strengthening of ties in the context of relations between the European Union and those signatories of the Cartagena Agreement...|$|E

The effect of regional variety is at best mixed.
