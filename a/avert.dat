40|$|This paper {{estimates}} births (as well as total pregnancies, abortions and miscarriages) <b>averted</b> by program enrollment {{during the}} 1970 s {{based not on}} the common assumption of constant program impact on birth rates, but on assumptions that {{take into account the}} changing use of abortion. Estimates of births <b>averted</b> from two national studies are translated into estimates of unintended pregnancies <b>averted</b> and projections of program impact throughout the decade are made assuming constant program impact on pregnancy rates. The number of pregnancies <b>averted</b> is broken into births, abortions and miscarriages <b>averted</b> based on actual distribution of those unintended pregnancies that did occur each year. This methodology is more appropriate to the United States or any other country during a time period when use of abortion has been changing. It also focuses attention on the fact that births <b>averted</b> reflect only part of the program's impact and that much of the program's effect is on <b>averting</b> abortions. During the decade, an estimated 5, 434, 000 unintended pregnancies were <b>averted</b> by enrollment in the family planning program. In 1979, 4, 486, 000 women were enrolled in family planning clinics. An estimated 792, 000 unintended pregnancies were <b>averted</b> as a direct result, 1 for every 5. 7 patients. The 274, 000 <b>averted</b> births would have increased the number of births in 1980 in the U. S. from 3, 872, 000, an increase of 8 %.

Three-month-old lambs were <b>averted</b> to the shrub Cercocarpus montanus by pairing its ingestion with lithium chloride (LiCl), a nonlethal gastrointestinal poison. When lambs were yearlings, they were offered C. montanus plants growing in 8 -liter pots. During the persistence trial, <b>averted</b> sheep took fewer (P less than. 05) bites of C. montanus than controls did (19 vs 64 bites/sheep, respectively). Following the persistence trial, sheep that had been previously <b>averted</b> to C. montanus and consumed C. montanus received LiCl. Complete aversion to C. montanus was re-established in previously <b>averted</b> sheep with a single dose of LiCl. When sheep previously <b>averted</b> to C. montanus were offered potted Amelanchier alnifolia shrubs, <b>averted</b> sheep consumed 21 bites of A. alnifolia but controls consumed 58 bites (P less than. 05). This result suggests that previously <b>averted</b> sheep were either more food neophobic than controls or generalized their aversion from C. montanus to A. alnifolia.

40|$|Objective To {{evaluate}} the cost-effectiveness of topical emollients, {{sunflower seed oil}} (SSO) and synthetic Aquaphor, versus no treatment, in preventing mortality among hospitalized preterm infants (< 33 weeks gestation) at a tertiary hospital in Bangladesh. Methods Evidence from a randomized controlled efficacy trial was evaluated using standard Monte Carlo simulation. Programme costs were obtained from a retrospective review of activities. Patient costs were collected from patient records. Health outcomes were calculated as deaths <b>averted</b> and discounted years of life lost (YLLs) <b>averted.</b> Results were deemed cost-effective if they fell below a ceiling ratio based on the per capita gross national income of Bangladesh (United States dollars, US $ 470). Findings Aquaphor and SSO were both highly cost-effective relative to control, reducing neonatal mortality by 26 % and 32 %, respectively. SSO cost US $ 61 per death <b>averted</b> and US $ 2. 15 per YLL <b>averted</b> (I $ 6. 39, international dollars, per YLL <b>averted).</b> Aquaphor cost US $ 162 per death <b>averted</b> and US $ 5. 74 per YLL <b>averted</b> (I $ 17. 09 per YLL <b>averted).</b> Results were robust to sensitivity analysis. Aquaphor was cost-effective relative to SSO with 77 % certainty: it cost an incremental US $ 26 more per patient treated, but <b>averted</b> 1. 25 YLLs (US $ 20. 74 per YLL <b>averted).</b> Conclusion Topical therapy with SSO or Aquaphor was highly cost-effective in reducing deaths from infection among the preterm neonates studied. The choice of emollient should be made taking into account budgetary limitations and ease of supply.

40|$|The general aim of {{the present}} {{research}} was to investigate infant gaze <b>averting</b> during social interaction. Two preliminary hypotheses were examined : first, that infant gaze <b>averting</b> would occur spontaneously during social interaction, and second that any gaze <b>averting</b> would increase alongside developmental progress. A short-term (nine week) longitudinal case-study approach with home visits was planned. Conducting the research in the participants' homes was novel for this area of study. Prior studies had all been conducted in a laboratory setting. Six mother-infant dyads agreed to participate. The primiparous mothers were all full-time caregivers with an age range of 21 - 26 years. The healthy, full-term infants were all aged approximately three months at commencement. There were three of each gender. Visits to each pair occurred every nine/ten days. The following three sources of data collection were implemented: interview, observation and daily diary recording by the mother. Target behaviours noted were: episodes of active gaze <b>averting</b> and new developmental milestones (according to a developmental checklist formulated for the present study). Other relevant qualitative information was also gathered at each visit. Although basically a qualitative study, quantitative data was incorporated {{in the form of}} graphs of each infant's gaze <b>averting</b> frequency and developmental progress. The main findings here were: infant gaze <b>averting</b> did occur during interaction with mother and other caregivers for all six cases; the prediction that there is a relationship between gaze <b>averting</b> and developmental progress was not supported. Descriptive data provided an interesting and unexpected outcome. This was the discovery of three separate styles of gaze <b>averting.</b> These were described, their various criteria identified, and a classification system developed. The {{results of the present study}} have important practical implications. They present a challenge to one current theory of psychopathology which maintains that gaze <b>averting</b> is abnormal and may be a precursor of autism. This has ramifications for the present diagnosic system and treatment of some childhood psychopathologies. The findings of the present study indicate that a re-think of perspectives regarding gaze <b>averting</b> (of all styles) may be required...|$|R

40|$|Background: Supplementary {{immunization}} activity (SIA) campaigns provide {{children with}} an additional dose of measles vaccine and deliver other interventions, including vitamin A supplements, deworming medications, and oral polio vaccines. Objective: To assess the cost-effectiveness of the full SIA delivery platform in South Africa (SA). Design: We used an epidemiologic cost model to estimate the cost-effectiveness of the 2010 SIA campaign. We used province-level campaign data sourced from the District Health Information System, SA, and from planning records of provincial coordinators of the Expanded Programme on Immunization. The data included {{the number of children}} immunized with measles and polio vaccines, the number of children given vitamin A supplements and Albendazole tablets, and costs. Results: The campaign cost $ 37 million and <b>averted</b> a total of 1, 150 deaths (95 % uncertainty range: 990 - 1, 360) - This ranged from 380 deaths <b>averted</b> in KwaZulu-Natal to 20 deaths <b>averted</b> in the Northern Cape. Vitamin A supplementation alone <b>averted</b> 820 deaths (95 % UR: 670 - 1, 040); measles vaccination alone <b>averted</b> 330 deaths (95 % UR: 280 - 370) - Incremental cost-effectiveness was $ 27, 100 (95 % UR: $ 18, 500 - 34, 400) per death <b>averted</b> nationally, ranging from $ 11, 300 per death <b>averted</b> in the Free State to $ 91, 300 per death <b>averted</b> in the Eastern Cape. Conclusions: Cost-effectiveness of the SIA child health delivery platform varies substantially across SA provinces, and it is substantially more cost-effective when vitamin A supplementation is included in the interventions administered.

40|$|Abstract Background To {{evaluate}} the cost-effectiveness {{of the first}} nationwide delivery of long-lasting insecticide-treated nets (LLITNs) {{as part of the}} 2004 measles vaccination campaign in Togo to all children between nine months and five years. Methods An incremental approach was used to calculate the economic costs and effects from a provider perspective. Effectiveness was estimated in terms of malaria cases <b>averted,</b> deaths <b>averted</b> and Disability-Adjusted Life Years (DALYs) <b>averted.</b> Malaria cases were modelled using regional estimates. Programme and treatment costs were derived through reviews of financial records and interviews with key stakeholders. Uncertain variables were subjected to a univariate sensitivity analysis. Results Assuming equal attribution of shared costs between the LLITN distribution and the measles vaccination, the net costs per LLITN distributed were 4. 41 USD when saved treatment costs were taken into account. Assuming a constant utilization of LLITNs by the target group over three years, 1. 2 million cases could be prevented at a net cost per case <b>averted</b> of 3. 26 USD. The net costs were 635 USD per death <b>averted</b> and 16. 39 USD per DALY <b>averted,</b> respectively. Conclusion The costs per case, death and DALY <b>averted</b> are well within commonly agreed benchmarks set by other malaria prevention studies. Varying transmission levels are shown to {{have a significant impact on}} cost-effectiveness ratios.
