An independent analysis by ESA concluded, in line with the analysis of this letter, that the safest option was to place redundant ASMs in the lonely orbit. Therefore, in early 2014, spacecraft Charlie became part <b>of</b> the low <b>orbiting</b> pair, and Bravo was assigned to the lonely orbit.|$|R
40|$|Let k be a {{field of}} {{characteristic}} 0, let C/k be a uniquely trigonal genus 4 curve, and let P ∈ C(k) be a simply ramified point of the uniquely trigonal morphism. We construct an <b>assignment</b> <b>of</b> an <b>orbit</b> <b>of</b> an algebraic group of type E_ 8 acting on a specific variety to each element of J_C(k) / 2. The algebraic group and variety are independent of the choice of (C,P). We also construct a similar identification for uniquely trigonal genus 4 curves C with P ∈ C(k) a totally ramified point of the trigonal morphism. Our assignments are analogous to the <b>assignment</b> <b>of</b> a genus 3 curve with a rational point (C,P) to an <b>orbit</b> <b>of</b> an algebraic group of type E_ 7 exhibited by Jack Thorne. Our assignment is also analogous to one constructed by Bhargava and Gross, who use it determine average ranks of hyperelliptic Jacobians. Comment: 28 page...|$|R

40|$|Some {{consequences}} to the Bohr theory of extending the formulas for x-ray doublets to optical spectra. —The {{extension of the}} laws for x-ray doublets to ultra-violet spectra has given values of the screening constant {{in agreement with the}} Moseley-Bohr formula. This extension means a considerable simplification but it implies the identification of the LI, LII, LIII x-ray levels with the s, p 2, p 1 terms of optical series, respectively. This would make p 2 p 1 correspond to 2122 orbits (whereas they are always both assigned to 22 orbits) and would also assign both s and p 2 to the 21 orbits. In this case, the screening constant must, contrary to the natural assumption, be much more affected by orientation <b>of</b> <b>orbit</b> (inner quantum number) than by the shape <b>of</b> the <b>orbit</b> (azimuthal number). This seems to require either discarding the relativity explanation of p 2 p 1 and LIILIII doublets and with it all relativity effects in electronic orbits or introducing a dissymmetry not heretofore contemplated in atomic models, abandoning Bohr's interpenetration ideas and his <b>assignment</b> <b>of</b> azimuthal quantum numbers...|$|R

The UNCITRAL Convention on the <b>Assignment</b> <b>of</b> Receivables in International Trade (“the UNCITRAL Convention”) was adopted in 2001 by the General Assembly. The UNCITRAL Convention was prepared to establish a sophisticated, comprehensive and potentially far-reaching model for the modernisation <b>of</b> domestic <b>assignment</b> laws <b>of</b> countries and a substantive step for harmonisation of the law <b>of</b> <b>assignment</b> <b>of</b> receivables in international trade.
