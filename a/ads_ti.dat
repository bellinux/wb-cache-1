40|$|In this study, the {{influence}} of minor titanium (Ti) addition on the microstructure and tensile properties of Mg- 8 Sn- 1 Zn based alloys were investigated by means of optical microscopy, X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, energy dispersive spectrometry, and tensile tests. The results showed that Ti can decrease the secondary dendrite arm spacing (SDAS). The tensile strength of the Mg- 8 Sn- 1 Zn-Ti alloys is initially increased by increasing the Ti content up to 0. 09 wt. %, but subsequently decreased for further increase of Ti content. The improved tensile properties are attributed to the decreased SDAS and refined Mg 2 Sn phases, {{as well as the}} increased fraction of tin (Sn) segregated regions.

An important measure obtained during this processis the spinâ€”latticerelaxation time (Ti), the time taken for the nuclei to return to equilibrium after excitation. Most protons available for excitation in tissue are those of water and the 71 can therefore be altered by changesin the free: bound ratio of wateror water content (Mathur de Vre, 1984). Using MRI, significant increaseshave beenfound in the white-matter Ti in patients with dementia compared with normal controls.

Tri-reforming {{of methane}} (TRM) to syngas is most energy-efficient. In the reaction system, O 2 and H 2 O help to reduce the carbon deposition on the refrorming catalyst. The n(H 2) /n(CO) of syngas from TRM ranges from 1. 5 to 2. 0 and is very suitable to produce other chemicals. In terms of CO 2 produced based on relative energy requirements, trireforming process generates considerably less CO 2 per unit amount of desired syngas (CO + 2 H 2), than the industrial steam reforming process and the well-known CO 2 reforming process. TRM process is a promising process for environmental protection and development of new sources of energy. The study on the TRM reaction over Ni-based catalysts was conducted in this paper. Ni-based catalysts were prepared through a wet impregnation method and catalytic performance was improved by modifying support or metal. Three series catalysts were prepared through wet impregnation-Ni/Al 2 O 3, Ni/MgxTi 1 -xO and Pt modified Ni/MgO system. The TRM reaction was carried out in a continuous flow fixed bed reactor. The influence of reaction conditions, including temperature, pressure, feed composition and W/F (W = catalyst weight, F = total flow rate) on the catalytic performance was investigated. Temperature profiles in fixed catalyst bed in TRM reaction were also investigated. The important results are as follows. 1. Ni/Al 2 O 3 catalysts were prepared by dispersing Ni on new γ-Al 2 O 3 obtained by H 2 O 2 -precipitated boehmite from sodium aluminate solution, followed with azeotropic distillation. The influence of calcined temperature on properties and catalytic performance of Ni/Al 2 O 3 was investigated. The dispersion of Ni/Al 2 O 3 - 650 wass 11. 7 %, higher than catalysts calcied at other temperature. The activity of Ni/Al 2 O 3 - 650 did not decrease for a reaction period of 50 h under condition of n(CH 4) :n(CO 2) :n(H 2 O) :n(O 2) = 1 : 0. 48 : 0. 54 : 0. 1, 850 ℃, 1. 0 MPa and 1. 78 g&# 8226;h&# 8226;mol- 1, indicating that the catalyst calcined at 650 ℃ possesses excellent performance. It was concluded that n(H 2) /n(CO) of syngas could be adjusted by varying feed composition. According to thermal distribution of the catalyst bed, the catalyst bed can be divided into three zones orderly-oxygen adequate zone, oxygen inadequate zone, and oxygen absent zone. In oxygen inadequate zone, proceeds auto-thermal reforming reaction. 2. Ni/MgxTi 1 -xOy catalysts were prepared by dispersing Ni on new MgxTi 1 -xOy composite oxides obtained via a sol-gel technique. <b>Adding</b> <b>Ti</b> to the NiO-MgO system obstructed the formation of solid solution, and thus increased the reducibility of the catalysts. The prepared MgxTi 1 -xOy composite oxides had the same ability to disperse Ni as TiO 2 and MgO. Due to the moderate interaction between metal and support and the moderate ability to be reduced, the Ni/Mg 0. 75 Ti 0. 25 Oy and Ni/Mg 0. 5 Ti 0. 5 Oy catalyst possess high stability. For example, the activity of Ni/Mg 0. 75 Ti 0. 25 Oy did not decrease for a reaction period of 50 h under condition of n(CH 4) :n(CO 2) :n(H 2 O) :n(O 2) = 1 : 0. 48 : 0. 54 : 0. 1, 850 ℃, 1. 0 MPa and 1. 78 g&# 8226;h&# 8226;mol- 1. 3. Catalytic performance of Ni/MgO was improved by adding Pt to Ni/MgO system through co-impregnation or sequential impregnation method. It was found that in thermal distribution of NiPt/MgO and PtNi/MgO, prepared through sequential impregnation method, hot spot in inlet of catalyst bed was eliminated and auto-thermal zone was extended...|$|R
