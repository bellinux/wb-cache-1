5|$|Although he {{depicted}} Tucana on his chart, Bayer did not assign its stars Bayer designations.

The living conditions in Poland did not improve, contrary to government propaganda, and workers increasingly found that they had little power compared to bureaucracy of the Party (nomenklatura).|$|E
