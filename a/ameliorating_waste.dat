However, the exact mechanism of these positive effects remains unkown. Here we investigated {{the hypothesis that}} dexmedetomidine could <b>ameliorate</b> muscle <b>wasting</b> in endotoxemic rats and whether it was related to hypothalamic neuropeptides alteration and inflammation. Fourty-eight adult male Sprague-Dawley rats were intraperitoneally injected with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) (5 mg/kg) or saline, followed by 50 μg/kg dexmedetomidine or saline administration via the femoral vein catheter (infusion at 5 μg·kg- 1 ·hr- 1). Twenty-four hours after injection, hypothalamus tissues and skeletal muscle were obtained. Muscle wasting {{was measured by the}} mRNA expression of two E 3 ubiquitin ligases, muscle atrophy F-box (MAFbx) and muscle ring finger 1 (MuRF- 1) as well as 3 -methylhistidine (3 -MH) and tyrosine release. Hypothalamic inflammatory markers and neuropeptides expression were also detected in all four groups. Results showed that LPS administration led to significant increase in hypothalamic inflammation together with muscle wasting. Increased hypothalamic neuropeptides, proopiomelanocortin (POMC), cocaine and amphetamine-related transcript (CART) and neuropeptides Y (NPY) and decreased agouti-related protein (AgRP) were also observed. Meanwhile dexmedetomidine administration <b>ameliorated</b> muscle <b>wasting,</b> hypothalamic inflammation and modulated the alteration of neuropeptides, POMC, CART and AgRP, in endotoxemic rats. In conclusion, dexmedetomidine could alleviate muscle wasting in endotoxemic rats, and it could also attenuate the alteration of hypothalamic neuropeptides and reduce hypothalamic inflammation...|$|R

40|$|Wasting, {{cardiovascular}} {{complications and}} inflammation are known risk {{factors associated with}} high mortality in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). Ghrelin is an appetite-regulating hormone with additional effects in the modulation of systemic inflammation and the cardiovascular system. CKD patients with low serum ghrelin have high mortality risk and may benefit the most from ghrelin therapy. Aim to investigate the effects of ghrelin on cachexia, muscle wasting, cardiovascular complications, inflammation and mortality in CKD. C 56 BL/ 6 J mice underwent 2 -stage 5 / 6 nephrectomy (CKD) or sham operation (S). Ghrelin (150 nmole/kg/day) or saline was given to CKD or S mice. Over 90 -days, mortality rates of 9 month old ghrelin-treated CKD mice (15 %) and S mice (0 %) were significantly better than those of CKD mice (57. 5 %). The cumulative food intake of the CKD + ghrelin mice was significantly increased than CKD mice (p< 0. 01). CKD + ghrelin mice gained more weight than CKD mice (p< 0. 01). CKD + ghrelin mice gained lean body mass and fat mass while CKD mice lost lean and fat mass (p< 0. 01). 24 hr metabolic rate was increased and efficiency of food consumption was decreased in CKD mice as compared to S mice (p< 0. 001). Ghrelin normalized these abnormalities in CKD mice (p< 0. 01). Ghrelin significantly improved systolic hypertension in CKD mice (p< 0. 01). Left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) was ameliorated in CKD+ghrelin mice as compared to CKD mice (p< 0. 01). TNF-α and IL- 6 mRNA levels were significantly increased in gastrocnemius and cardiac muscles of CKD mice and ghrelin significantly decreased the expression of these inflammatory cytokines in CKD mice (p< 0. 01).

40|$|International audienceEmerging {{evidence}} suggests that the muscle microenvironment plays a prominent role in cancer cachexia. We recently showed that NF-kB-induced Pax 7 overexpression impairs the myogenic potential of muscle precursors in cachectic mice, suggesting that lowering Pax 7 expression may be beneficial in cancer cachexia. We evaluated the muscle regenerative potential after acute injury in C 26 colon carcinoma tumor-bearing mice and healthy controls. Our analyses confirmed that the delayed muscle regeneration observed in muscles form tumor-bearing mice was associated with a persistent local inflammation and Pax 7 overexpression. Physical activity is known to exert positive effects on cachectic muscles. However, the mechanism by which a moderate voluntary exercise <b>ameliorates</b> muscle <b>wasting</b> is not fully elucidated. To verify if physical activity affects Pax 7 expression, we hosted control and C 26 -bearing mice in wheel-equipped cages and we found that voluntary wheel running downregulated Pax 7 expression in muscles from tumor-bearing mice. As expected, downregulation of Pax 7 expression was associated with a rescue of muscle mass and fiber size. Our findings shed light on the molecular basis of the beneficial effect exerted by a moderate physical exercise on muscle stem cells in cancer cachexia. Furthermore, we propose voluntary exercise as a physiological tool to counteract the overexpression of Pax 7 observed in cancer cachexia...|$|R
40|$|D 9 -Tetrahydrocannabinol (D 9 -THC), {{the primary}} psychoactive {{component}} in marijuana, is FDA approved to <b>ameliorate</b> AIDS-associated <b>wasting.</b> Because cannabinoid receptors are expressed on {{cells of the}} immune system, chronic D 9 -THC use may impact HIV disease progression. We examined the impact of chronic D 9 -THC administration (0. 32 mg/kg im, 2 daily), starting 28 days prior to inoculation with simian immunodeficiency virus (SIVmac 251; 100 TCID 50 /ml, iv), on immune and metabolic indicators of disease during the initial 6 month asymptomatic phase of infection in rhesus macaques. SIVmac 251 inoculation resulted in measurable viral load, decreased lymphocyte CD 4 þ/CD 8 þ ratio, and increased CD 8 þ proliferation. D 9 -THC treatment of SIV-infected animals produced minor to no effects in these parameters. However, chronic D 9 -THC administration decreased early mortality from SIV infection (p 0. 039), and this was associated with attenuation of plasma and CSF viral load and retention of body mass (pNS). In vitro, D 9 -THC (10 mm) decreased SIV (10 TCID 50) viral replication in MT 4 -R 5 cells. These results indicate that chronic D 9 -THC does not increase viral load or aggravate morbidity and may actually ameliorate SIV disease progression. We speculate that reduced levels of SIV, retention of body mass, and attenuation of inflammation are likely mechanisms for D 9 -THC-mediated modulation of disease progression that warrant further study...|$|R
40|$|Development {{of human}} {{embryonic}} stem cell (hESC) -based therapy requires derivation of in vitro expandable cell populations that can readily differentiate to specified cell types and engraft upon transplantation. Here, we report that hESCs can differentiate into skeletal muscle cells without genetic manipulation.

The ESC-derived cells differentiated into myoblasts in vitro as evident by upregulation of various myogenic genes, irrespective {{of the presence of}} serum in the medium. This result is further corroborated by the presence of sarcomeric myosin and desmin, markers for terminally differentiated cells. When transplanted in vivo, these pre-myogenically committed cells were viable in tibialis anterior muscles 14 days post-implantation. These hESC-derived cells, which readily undergo myogenic differentiation in culture medium containing serum, could be a viable cell source for skeletal muscle repair and tissue engineering to <b>ameliorate</b> various muscle <b>wasting</b> diseases...|$|R
40|$|Recently {{revealed}} high {{prevalence of}} Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) raises concerns {{all over the}} world; evidence based strategies to delay progression were set up. Dietary approach is largely mentioned, but strong evidence is lacking. The reduced dietary protein intake has been reported {{for more than a}} century to improve uremic symptoms and even to postpone the initiation of renal replacement therapy (RRT); however, the nutritional intervention in uremia is still under debate. Different dietary protein regimens have been proposed for the CKD patients: (1) conventional low protein diet (LPD), with 0. 6 g/kg per day; (2) very low protein diet (0. 3 g/kg per day) supplemented with essential amino acids or (3) very low protein diet (0. 3 g/kg per day) supplemented with an isomolar mixture of essential amino acids and nitrogen-free keto-analogues (SVLPD). Available data support SVLPD to be effective in <b>ameliorating</b> nitrogen <b>waste</b> products retention, acid-base and calcium-phosphorus metabolism disturbances and insulin-resistance and in delaying the RRT initiation, with no deleterious effect on the nutritional status in CKD patients. More recent studies report that SVLPD could also slow down the rate of decline in renal function, preserving the nutritional status and associating better outcome after the start of RRT. The possible delay of RRT initiation through nutrition could have major impact on patients’ quality of life. On the other hand, postponing RRT could have also a serious economic impact, particularly important in countries where the dialysis facilities still do not meet the needs. The nutritional intervention, particularly the SVLPD could be a new link in the RRT integrated care model.

40|$|The {{transforming}} growth factor-β (TGF-β) {{signaling network}} {{is a critical}} regulator of skeletal muscle mass and function and, thus, is an attractive therapeutic target for combating muscle disease, but the underlying mechanisms of action remain undetermined. We report that follistatin-based interventions (which modulate TGF-β network activity) can promote muscle hypertrophy that <b>ameliorates</b> aging-associated muscle <b>wasting.</b> However, the muscles of old sarcopenic mice demonstrate reduced response to follistatin compared with healthy young-adult musculature. Quantitative proteomic and transcriptomic analyses of young-adult muscles identified a transcription/translation signature elicited by follistatin exposure, which included repression of ankyrin repeat and SOCS box protein 2 (Asb 2). Increasing expression of ASB 2 reduced muscle mass, thereby demonstrating that Asb 2 is a TGF-β network-responsive negative regulator of muscle mass. In contrast to young-adult muscles, sarcopenic muscles do not exhibit reduced ASB 2 abundance with follistatin exposure. Moreover, preventing repression of ASB 2 in young-adult muscles diminished follistatin-induced muscle hypertrophy. These findings {{provide insight into the}} program of transcription and translation events governing follistatin-mediated adaptation of skeletal muscle attributes and identify Asb 2 as a regulator of muscle mass implicated in the potential mechanistic dysfunction between follistatin-mediated muscle growth in young and old muscles...|$|R
40|$|Background Skeletal {{muscle wasting}} is an {{important}} comorbidity of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) and is strongly correlated with morbidity and mortality. Patients who experience frequent acute exacerbations of COPD (AECOPD) have more severe muscle wasting and reduced recovery of muscle mass and function after each exacerbation. Serum levels of the pro-inflammatory acute phase protein Serum Amyloid A (SAA) can rise more than 1000 -fold in AECOPD and are predictively correlated with exacerbation severity. The direct effects of SAA on skeletal muscle are poorly understood. Here we have examined SAA effects on pro-inflammatory cachectic cytokine expression (IL- 6 and TNFα) and atrophy in C 2 C 12 myotubes. Results SAA increased IL- 6 (31 -fold) and TNFα (6. 5 -fold) mRNA levels compared to control untreated cells after 3 h of SAA treatment, and increased secreted IL- 6 protein at 24 h. OxPAPC, a dual TLR 2 and TLR 4 inhibitor, reduced the response to SAA by approximately 84 % compared to SAA alone, and the TLR 2 neutralising antibody T 2. 5 abolished SAA-induced expression of IL- 6, indicating that SAA signalling in C 2 C 12 myotubes is primarily via TLR 2. SAA also reduced myotube width by 10 - 13 % and induced a 2. 5 -fold increase in {{the expression of the}} muscle atrophy gene Atrogin- 1, suggesting direct effects of SAA on muscle wasting. Blocking of TLR 2 inhibited the SAA-induced decrease in myotube width and Atrogin- 1 gene expression, indicating that SAA induces atrophy through TLR 2.

We conducted an extensive dose–response {{study to determine}} the most efficacious dose of fenoterol for increasing skeletal muscle mass in adult rats and used this dose {{in testing the hypothesis}} that fenoterol may have therapeutic potential for <b>ameliorating</b> age-related muscle <b>wasting</b> and weakness. We used adult (16 -month-old) rats that had completed their growth and development, and old (28 -month-old) rats that exhibited characteristic muscle wasting and weakness, and treated them daily with either fenoterol (1. 4 mg kg− 1, i. p), or saline vehicle, for 4 weeks. Following treatment, functional characteristics of fast-twitch extensor digitorum longus (EDL) and predominantly slow-twitch soleus muscles of the hindlimb were assessed in vitro. Untreated old rats exhibited a loss of skeletal muscle mass and a decrease in force-producing capacity, in both fast and slow muscles, compared with adult rats(P < 0. 05). However, there was no age-associated decrease in skeletal muscle β-adrenoceptor density, nor was the muscle response to chronic β-agonist stimulation reduced with age. Thus, muscle mass and force-producing capacity of EDL and soleus muscles from old rats treated with fenoterol was equivalent to, or greater than, untreated adult rats. The increase in mass and strength was attributed to a non-selective increase in the cross-sectional area of all muscle fibre types, in both the EDL and soleus. Fenoterol treatment caused a small increase in fatiguability due to a decrease in oxidative metabolism in both EDL and soleus muscles, with some cardiac hypertrophy. Further studies are needed to fully separate the desirable effects on skeletal muscle and the undesirable effects on the heart. Nevertheless, our results demonstrate that fenoterol is a powerful anabolic agent that can restore muscle mass and strength in old rats, and provide preliminary evidence of therapeutic potential for age-related muscle wasting and weakness...|$|R

Lost muscle mass and function are associated with reduced {{quality of life in}} many disease conditions. Recently, the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ coactivator- 1 α 4 (PGC- 1 α 4) isoform has been shown to {{play a key role in}} the promotion of skeletal muscle mass; however its specific regulation under normal and stress (inflammatory) conditions is still unknown. PURPOSE: To elicit signaling mechanisms regulating the gene expression of Pgc- 1 α 4 during inflammation and particularly by IL- 6. METHODS: Female C 57 BL/ 6 J (WT) and C 57 BL/ 6 J × IL- 6 −/− (IL- 6 KO) mice were euthanized and tibialis anterior muscles were excised, snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen and processed for gene expression analysis. To further determine the underlying mechanisms by which IL- 6 governs PGC- 1 α 4 expression, C 2 C 12 myotubes were treated with recombinant IL- 6 (50 ng/ml), recombinant TNF-α (20 ng/ml), Pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate (PDTC, 50 µM) and PD 098059 (20 µM; MEK 1 / 2 inhibitor preventing ERK 1 / 2 activity). RNA was isolated from WT and IL- 6 KO mice as well as C 2 C 12 myotubes. RNA was analyzed by real time RT PCR for mRNA content analysis of 18 S and Pgc- 1 α 4. Protein analysis was performed by immunoblot for P-STAT 3, STAT 3, P-ERK 1 / 2 and ERK 1 / 2 and normalized to Ponceau S. A student t-test or one way ANOVA was employed as appropriate with α set at 0. 05. RESULTS: Pgc- 1 α 4 mRNA content was 10 -fold greater in IL- 6 KO mice compared to WT. In C 2 C 12 myotubes, IL- 6 significantly repressed Pgc- 1 α 4 mRNA content by ~ 70 % while TNF-α and PDTC treated cells were not different from control. In the following experiment, similar IL- 6 repression of Pgc- 1 α 4 mRNA was abrogated when IL- 6 was combined with ERK 1 / 2 inhibition via MEK (PD 098059 + IL 6). There was a significant 40 % increase in the P-STAT 3 /STAT 3 ratio and the P-ERK/ ERK ratio with IL- 6 treatment while inhibitors of STAT 3 (PDTC) and ERK 1 / 2 (PD 098059) significantly decreased these ratios by 30 % and 50 %, respectively. CONCLUSION: PGC- 1 α 4 expression is repressed by IL- 6 through the ERK 1 / 2 signaling axis.
