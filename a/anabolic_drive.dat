Here we show that rat ARC neurons containing neuropeptide Y (NPY) and agouti-related protein (AgRP), which are conditional pacemakers, are activated by orexigens and inhibited by the anorexigen leptin. We propose a neuron-specific signaling mechanism through which central and peripheral signals engage the central neural <b>anabolic</b> <b>drive...</b>|$|E
40|$|International audienceBACKGROUND: <b>Anabolic</b> <b>drive</b> is {{impaired}} {{in heart}} failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) but insufficiently studied in heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF). Insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF- 1) mediates growth hormone effects and IGF binding protein 1 (IGFBP- 1) regulates IGF- 1 activity. We tested {{the hypothesis that}} HFpEF and HFrEF are similar with regard to IGF- 1 and IGFBP- 1. METHODS AND RESULTS: In patients with HFpEF (n[*]=[*] 79), HFrEF (n[*]=[*] 85), and controls (n[*]=[*] 136), we analyzed serum IGF- 1 and IGFBP- 1 concentrations, correlations, and associations with outcome. Age-standardized scores of IGF- 1 were higher in HFpEF, median arbitrary units (interquartile range); 1. 21 (0. 57 - 1. 96) vs HFrEF, 0. 09 (- 1. 40 - 1. 62), and controls, 0. 22 (- 0. 47 - 0. 96), P overall[*]<. 001. IGFBP- 1 was increased in HFpEF, 48 (28 - 79), and HFrEF, 65 (29 - 101), vs controls, 27 (14 - 35) µg/L, P overall[*]<. 001. These patterns persisted after adjusting for metabolic and HF severity confounders. IGF- 1 was associated with outcomes in HFrEF, hazard ratio per natural logarithmic increase in IGF- 1 SD score 0. 51 (95 % confidence interval 0. 32 - 0. 82, P[*]=[*]. 005), but not significantly in HFpEF. IGFBP- 1 {{was not associated with}} outcomes in either HFpEF nor HFrEF. CONCLUSION: HFpEF and HFrEF phenotypes were similar with regard to increased IGFBP- 1 concentrations but differed regarding IGF- 1 levels and prognostic role. HFrEF and HFpEF may display different impairment in <b>anabolic</b> <b>drive...</b>|$|E
40|$|A {{metabolic}} imbalance between <b>anabolic</b> <b>drive</b> and catabolic {{forces is}} commonly observed in chronic heart failure (CHF) patients, {{with the latter}} prevailing over anabolic hormones. Moreover, anabolic deficiencies are independent markers of poor prognosis. This finding represents a solid background {{for the implementation of}} therapeutic trials based on replacement therapy. The somatotropic axis (GH/IGF- 1) is the most powerful anabolic axis of the body and its decline is related with a poor outcome and a worse clinical status. Growth hormone (GH) administration may enter the therapeutic arena as adjunctive treatment in patients affected by CHF and GH/IGF- 1 deficiency. The T. O. S. CA. project aims at investigating the relationship between CHF and hormonal deficiency...|$|E
40|$|Objective—To assess {{therapeutic}} {{benefits for}} intervertebral disc matrix repair and regeneration, the potential synergism of IGF- 1 and BMP 7 on bovine spine discs were evaluated, and molecular/ cellular mechanisms were elucidated. Methods—Bovine nucleus pulposus (NP) cells {{were treated with}} BMP 7 and IGF- 1. The subsequent <b>anabolic</b> effects <b>driven</b> by NP cells were assessed for proteoglycan synthesis by 35 S-sulfate incorporation and accumulation by DMMB assays, respectively. Matrix formation was visualized by particle exclusion assay. Key matrix components and transcription factors were analyzed by real-time PCR to determine the signaling pathways by which IGF- 1 suppresses noggin, a potent inhibitor of BMP 7. Western blot and nuclear translocalization experiments were performed to assess the activation of SMAD proteins. Results—Stimulation of bovine NP cells by both IGF- 1 and BMP 7 greatly potentiates anabolism through complementary and synergistic mechanisms on matrix formation when compared to treatment with either growth factor alone. Exogenously added decoy ligand, noggin attenuates the anabolic effects of BMP 7, and noggin is substantially increased by BMP 7, suggesting a negativ...|$|R
40|$|To {{understand}} {{the origin of}} metabolism and biopolymer synthesis we investigated the energy sources that <b>drive</b> <b>anabolic</b> metabolism. We found that biosynthesis of amino acids and lipids from sugars is driven bz the free energy of redox disproportionation of carbon (see discussion or next page). The indispensable role of sugar disproportionation in the biosynthesis of amino acids and lipids suggests that {{the origin of life}} uses the same chemical engine, and was therefore based on nonenzymatic redox disproportionation reactions of sugars that occurred in the presence o ammonia and hydrogen sulfide. The chemistry of this 'metabolic' model of the origin of life is described...|$|R
40|$|Apicoplasts are vestigial {{plastids}} in apicomplexan parasites like Plasmodium, the causative {{agent of}} malaria. Apicomplexan parasites are dependant on their apicoplasts for synthesis of various molecules {{that they are}} unable to scavenge in sufficient quantity from their host, which makes apicoplasts attractive drug targets. Proteins known as plastid phosphate translocators (pPTs) are embedded in the outer apicoplast membrane and are responsible for the import of carbon, energy and reducing power to <b>drive</b> <b>anabolic</b> synthesis in the organelle. We investigated how a pPT is targeted into the outer apicoplast membrane of the human malaria parasite P. falciparum. We showed that a transmembrane domain is likely to act as a recessed signal anchor to direct the protein into the endomembrane system, and that a tyrosine in the cytosolic N-terminus of the protein is essential for targeting, but one or more, as yet unidentified, factors are also essential to direct the protein into the outer apicoplast membrane...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT Developmental {{hormonal}} {{changes in}} Cobb the <b>anabolic</b> <b>drive</b> to promote protein deposition. Insulin 500 chick embryos and hatched chicks {{were determined by}} measuring plasma insulin, glucagon, insulin-like growth factor (IGF) -I, IGF-II, triiodothyronine, thyroxine, and glucose concentrations at different ages of embryogenesis and posthatch development. Plasma samples were obtained daily from 10 d of embryogenesis (10 E) through 13 d posthatch and also at 17 and 21 d posthatch. A significant increase in plasma insulin was observed with increasing age from 10 E to hatch. Plasma glucagon levels remained low until 17 E, and then significantly increased approximately 3 -fold at hatch, which corresponded with increasing plasma glucose levels during late embryo development. The plasma insulin to glucagon molar ratio of incubation from 14 E to 17 E ranged from...|$|E
40|$|It is well {{documented}} that disturbances in mitochondrial function are associated with rare childhood disorders and possibly with many common diseases of ageing, such as Parkinson's disease and dementia. There has also been increasing evidence linking mitochondrial dysfunction with tumorigenesis. Recently, heterozygous germline mutations in two enzymes of the Krebs tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA cycle) {{have been shown to}} predispose individuals to tumours. The two enzymes, fumarate hydratase (FH) and succinate dehydrogenase (SDH), are ubiquitously expressed, playing a vital role in adenosine triphosphate (ATP) production through the mitochondrial respiratory chain. Germline mutations in FH are associated with leiomyomatosis and renal cell carcinoma, whilst SDH mutations are associated with predisposition to paraganglioma (PGL) and phaeochromocytoma (PCC). At present, there are few data to explain the pathway(s) involved in this predisposition to neoplasia through TCA cycle defects. We shall review the mechanisms by which mutations in FH and SDH might play a role in tumorigenesis. These include pseudo-hypoxia, mitochondrial dysfunction and impaired apoptosis, oxidative stress and <b>anabolic</b> <b>drive.</b> All of these mechanisms are currently poorly defined. To date, FH and SDH mutations have not been reported in non-familial leiomyomata, renal cancers, PCCs or PGLs. It remains entirely possible, however, that the underlying mechanisms of tumorigenesis in these sporadic tumours are the same as those in the Mendelian syndromes...|$|E
40|$|Human {{critical}} {{illness is}} characterized by protein hypercatabolism, preservation of fat depots and by immune dysfunction. Optimized parenteral or enteral feeding and other advanced, supportive therapies remain unable to prevent ensuing wasting of vital organs and muscles and deficient healing processes. The anterior pituitary gland is a prime regulator of human metabolism and immune function through the orchestrated secretion of hormones, including growth hormone, thyrotropin, gonadotropins, prolactin and corticotropin. Except for the latter hormone, the releasing activity of the pituitary tends to decrease with advancing age and this decline {{is thought to be}} one of the mechanisms underlying the gradual loss of <b>anabolic</b> <b>drive,</b> reparative processes and cellular defence in senescence. In this work, critical illness was documented to be consistently associated with a diminished level of activity in the different axes governed by the pituitary, except for the corticotropic axis. In addition, this aging pattern of pituitary function in critical illness was found to be aggravated by the infusion of dopamine, a common practice in intensive care medicine for newborns, children and adults. The latter observation launches the hypothesis that endogenous dopamine may participate in the pathogenesis of the pituitary dysfunction in critical illness. Finally, these findings establish a base to explore the therapeutic potential of pituitary hormones and their secretagogues to enhance recovery from severe illness. status: publishe...|$|E
50|$|Two phosphoanhydride bonds (those {{that connect}} {{adjacent}} phosphates) in an ATP molecule {{are responsible for}} the high energy content of this molecule. In the context of biochemical reactions, these anhydride bonds are frequently - and sometimes controversially - referred to as high-energy bonds (despite the fact it takes energy to break bonds). Energy stored in ATP may be released upon hydrolysis of the anhydride bonds. The primary phosphate group on the ATP molecule that is hydrolyzed when energy is needed to <b>drive</b> <b>anabolic</b> reactions is the γ-phosphate group. Located the farthest from the ribose sugar, it has a higher energy of hydrolysis than either the α- or β-phosphate. The bonds formed after hydrolysis - or the phosphorylation of a residue by ATP - are lower in energy than the phosphoanhydride bonds of ATP. During enzyme-catalyzed hydrolysis of ATP or phosphorylation by ATP, the available free energy can be harnessed by a living system to do work.|$|R
40|$|How life emerged is a mystery, but {{theories}} have advanced remarkably {{in the last}} century. Research has traced current molecular structures back to an ancient period in life when RNA assumed a dominant role. A second line of research has explored ways to synthesize biological molecules from simpler molecules thought to exist on the nascent Earth. The first approach can only trace life back to the last universal common ancestor, while the second approach has not yet demonstrated that simple biological molecules can interact in life-like ways. The results communicated in this dissertation provide {{an example of a}} complex molecular system that could help fill in the gap between these two disparate domains. Though our results are not expected to bear much resemblance to the actual molecules that first gave rise to life, the artificial system presented here has some striking similarities to living systems and may have fundamental processes in common with the ancient molecular assemblies that gave rise to the first life forms. It is also the most complex example to date of a self-propagating molecular network resembling life. 	In the first study of the dissertation we report on a novel lipid-based system that harnesses autocatalysis to drive continual membrane growth. Lipid membranes are ubiquitous in all domains of life; like living systems, lipid assemblies assume complex macromolecular structures and non-equilibrium states. Previous studies have exploited these properties to drive physical processes (vesicle growth and/or division) by adding additional lipids in the form of micelles or feeder vesicles. A smaller number of studies have added complexity by using catalysts to generate additional lipids through catabolic reactions, which subsequently drive vesicle growth. Such systems, however, are unable to sustain persistent phospholipid production. Here we couple a hydrophobic autocatalyst to lipid membranes and lipid membrane production, resulting in an anabolic metabolism that continually resupplies all of the components needed to form additional catalytic membranes. A remarkable consequence of the coupled anabolic reactions is the apparent ability of the catalytic membranes to selectively take up precursors and synthesize modified catalytic membranes under different environmental conditions. 	In the second study of the dissertation we report on the design and creation of a ruthenium photoredox trigger that induces electron transfer, upon excitation with visible wavelengths, and drives biomimetic phospholipid synthesis. All known living systems couple free energy both to electron transport chains in membrane bilayers and to anabolic reactions. Light harvesting systems fundamentally changed the surface of the Earth; here we demonstrate the first instance of coupling a light-harvesting electron transport chain to an <b>anabolic</b> reaction that <b>drives</b> membrane synthesis...|$|R
40|$|An {{emergent}} {{hypothesis is}} that a resistance to the <b>anabolic</b> <b>drive</b> by insulin may contribute to loss of strength and muscle mass in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). We tested whether insulin resistance extends to protein metabolism using the forearm perfusion method with arterial insulin infusion in 7 patients with CKD and metabolic acidosis (bicarbonate 19 [*]mmol/l) and 7 control individuals. Forearm glucose balance and protein turnover (2 H-phenylalanine kinetics) were measured basally {{and in response to}} insulin infused at different rates for 2 [*]h to increase local forearm plasma insulin concentration by approximately 20 and 50 [*]μU/ml. In response to insulin, forearm glucose uptake was significantly increased to a lesser extent (- 40 %) in patients with CKD than controls. In addition, whereas in the controls net muscle protein balance and protein degradation were decreased by both insulin infusion rates, in patients with CKD net protein balance and protein degradation were sensitive to the high (0. 035 [*]mU/kg per min) but not the low (0. 01 [*]mU/kg per min) insulin infusion. Besides blunting muscle glucose uptake, CKD and acidosis interfere with the normal suppression of protein degradation in response to a moderate rise in plasma insulin. Thus, alteration of protein metabolism by insulin may lead to changes in body tissue composition which may become clinically evident in conditions characterized by low insulinemia.

40|$|Anabolic hormones are {{endowed with}} {{powerful}} actions {{on both the}} cardiovascular system and the skeletal muscle. In western countries, an age-related decline of anabolic hormones including IGF- 1, testosterone and DHEA-S is extensively described, and thought to contribute to sarcopenia, visceral adiposity and osteopenia. This decline has been {{often referred to as}} somato- and andro-pause [4] and [5]. In the last decade, a growing body of evidence has led to the hypothesis that chronic heart failure (CHF) is indeed a multiple hormone deficiency syndrome (MHDS), characterized by a reduced <b>anabolic</b> <b>drive</b> that bears relevant functional and prognostic implications. Of note, Growth Hormone (GH) or testosterone replacement therapy provides beneficial effects, particularly on exercise tolerance and well-being. Despite the emerging role of the MHDS, very few studies have described its prevalence in mild-to-moderate CHF, particularly focusing on age-related trends, and none has described simultaneous deficiencies of somatotropic, thyroid, adrenal, and gonadal axes. Therefore, the purpose of the current study was to clarify the age-related prevalence of MHDS in patients with CHF. In an unselected population of 202 stable CHF patients, 107 male subjects with CHF, NYHA classes I–III, were enrolled in three tertiary referral centers. The inclusion criteria were: male sex, age > 18 years, stable medications for at least three months including ß-blocker, left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of 40 % or below, and signed informed consent. Patients undergoing an active hormone treatment, with known advanced kidney disease (eGRF < 30 mL/min) or liver cirrhosis were excluded. The patients recruited were studied after 3 months of optimized medical therapy and clinical stability. In conclusion, the high prevalence of HD in CHF patients particularly in younger patients, its association with poor survival, and the recent evidence of beneficial effects of hormonal replacement therapies in CHF, supports the role for a hormonal screening in these patients...|$|E
