25|$|Particulate {{scrubbers}} Wet scrubber {{is a form}} {{of pollution}} control technology. The term describes a variety of devices that use pollutants from a furnace flue gas or from other gas streams. In <b>a</b> <b>wet</b> <b>scrubber,</b> the polluted gas stream is brought into contact with the scrubbing liquid, by spraying it with the liquid, by forcing it through a pool of liquid, or by some other contact method, so as to remove the pollutants.|$|E
25|$|Many coal-firing power {{stations}} use flue-gas desulfurization (FGD) to remove sulfur-containing gases from their stack gases. For a typical coal-fired power station, FGD will remove 95% {{or more of}} the SO2 in the flue gases. An example of FGD is the wet scrubber which is commonly used. <b>A</b> <b>wet</b> <b>scrubber</b> is basically a reaction tower equipped with a fan that extracts hot smoke stack gases from a power plant into the tower. Lime or limestone in slurry form is also injected into the tower to mix with the stack gases and combine with the sulfur dioxide present. The calcium carbonate of the limestone produces pH-neutral calcium sulfate that is physically removed from the scrubber. That is, the scrubber turns sulfur pollution into industrial sulfates.|$|E

5000|$|The {{recovery}} process used in magnesium-based sulfite pulping the [...] "Magnefite" [...] process is well developed. [...] The concentrated brown liquor is burned in a recovery boiler, producing magnesium oxide and sulfur dioxide, {{both of which}} are recovered from the flue gases.

50|$|<b>A</b> <b>wet</b> <b>scrubber,</b> or venturi scrubber, {{is similar}} to a cyclone but it has an orifice unit that sprays water into the vortex in the cyclone section, {{collecting}} all of the dust in a slurry system. The water media can be recirculated and reused to continue to filter the air. Eventually the solids must be removed from the water stream and disposed of.|$|E
50|$|<b>A</b> <b>wet</b> <b>scrubber's</b> {{ability to}} collect small {{particles}} is often {{directly proportional to}} the power input into the scrubber. Low energy devices such as spray towers are used to collect particles larger than 5 micrometers. To obtain high efficiency removal of 1 micrometer (or less) particles generally requires high-energy devices such as venturi scrubbers or augmented devices such as condensation scrubbers. Additionally, a properly designed and operated entrainment separator or mist eliminator is important to achieve high removal efficiencies. The greater the number of liquid droplets that are not captured by the mist eliminator, the higher the potential emission levels.|$|R
50|$|Removal {{efficiency}} of pollutants is improved by increasing residence {{time in the}} scrubber or by the increase of surface area of the scrubber solution {{by the use of}} a spray nozzle, packed towers or <b>an</b> aspirator. <b>Wet</b> <b>scrubbers</b> may increase the proportion of water in the gas, resulting in a visible stack plume, if the gas is sent to a stack.|$|R

Countercurrent flow exposes the outlet gas with the lowest pollutant concentration to the freshest scrubbing liquid.Many nozzles are placed across the tower at different heights to spray all of the gas as it moves up through the tower.
