Materials and Methods: Forty-five patients participated and a total of 90 radiographs were obtained in the study. The patients were divided into three groups (regular-medium intensifying screen, regular intensifying screen-digital radiography, and medium intensifying screen-digital radiography) that consisted of 15 people each. All radiographs were assessed by three oral radiologists independently. The observers evaluated the images using a 3 -point scale (1 =well visible, 0 =partly visible, - 1 =not or hardly visible) for anatomical structures and pathological findings that are commonly found on panoramic radiographs. Subjective image quality of the groups and comparison of the observers were assessed by using non parametric Kruskal Wallis and Mann-Whitney U tests. Results: For all groups and observers, no statistically significant difference (p> 0. 05) was found for both <b>anatomical</b> structures and <b>pathologies</b> and between <b>anatomical</b> structures and <b>pathologies</b> according to the Mann Whitney U test. In comparison with observers, no statistically significant difference (p> 0. 05) was found for both <b>anatomical</b> structures and <b>pathologies</b> and between <b>anatomical</b> structures and <b>pathologies</b> for all groups according to the Kruskal Wallis test.

Though classics clearly mention yogya (arha), ayogya (anarha) criteria for Nasya karma some complications were noticed while practicing.

This gave rise to need to develop quick screening criteria to minimize errors. Objective: To develop Nasya fitness form for clinical practice to further minimize unusual complications and thus obtain the maximum result. Materials and Methods: Literature pertaining to Nasya karma, Nāsa śarīra with anatomy of nose, vasculature, innervation, examination of the nose and various <b>anatomical</b> <b>pathologies</b> were considered to develop the fitness form. Results: On the basis of examination of external nose, nasal cavity, concha, nasopharynx and paranasal sinus by anterior and posterior rhinoscopic examination fitness form was developed.

40|$|Over {{the past}} two decades, various methods of {{sophisticated}} diagnostics of the upper airway have been tested in patients with sleep disordered breathing (SDB). In this context, endoscopic techniques and pharyngeal pressure recordings are of special interest for the otorhinolaryngologist. Whereas the basic otorhinolaryngological examination is able to detect <b>anatomical</b> <b>pathologies</b> which need to and can be corrected, the Müller-Manoeuvre seems to help exclude patients from uvulopalatopharyngoplasty. To a large extent, videoendoscopy during natural sleep {{has been replaced by}} videoendoscopy under sedation. Despite good methodological preparation and impressive presentability of the obstructions, there is not sufficent evidence to demonstrate that videoendoscopy under sedation improves the success rate of surgery in SDB. However, in assessing the impact of the epiglottis on upper airway obstructions in the individual patient, videoendoscopy is the only existing option. Multi-channel pressure recordings permit analysing the entire sleep period and are well tolerated. They can be used to determine the Apnea-Hypopnea-Index as well as to quantify obstructive events in the upper and lower pharyngeal segment. On the other hand, obstructions of the tongue base cannot be distinguished from obstructions related to the epiglottis. According to the data available so far, the benefit of sophisticated diagnostics of the upper airway still has to be judged with caution. Therefore, the promising approaches of both videoendoscopy under sedation and multi-channel pressure recordings deserve further intensive research. According to the personal estimation of the author, they will nevertheless become valuable tools for otorhinolaryngologists in the near future, thus complementing the basic ENT-examination and improving the treatment of patients...|$|R
