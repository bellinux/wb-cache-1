5|$|According to the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, Penda became king in 626, ruled for 30 years, and was 50 {{years old}} at the time of his accession. That he ruled for 30 years should not be taken as an exact figure, since the same source says he died in 655, which would not {{correspond}} to the year given for the beginning of his reign unless he died in the thirtieth year of his reign. Furthermore, that Penda was truly 50 {{years old at}} the beginning of his reign is generally doubted by historians, mainly because of the ages of his children. The idea that Penda, at about 80 years of <b>age,</b> <b>would</b> have left behind children who were still young (his son Wulfhere was still just a youth three years after Penda's death, according to Bede) has been widely considered implausible. The possibility has been suggested that the Chronicle actually meant to say that Penda was 50 {{years old at the}} time of his death, and therefore about 20 in 626.|$|E
5|$|George Lucas {{began writing}} the new Star Wars trilogy on November 1, 1994. The {{screenplay}} of Star Wars {{was adapted from}} Lucas' 15-page outline that was written in 1976, which he designed to help him {{keep track of the}} characters' backstories and events that occurred before the original trilogy. Anakin was first written as a twelve-year-old, but Lucas reduced his age to nine because he felt the lower <b>age</b> <b>would</b> better fit the plot point of Anakin being affected by his mother's separation from him. Eventually, Anakin's younger age led Lucas to rewrite his participation in the movie's major scenes. The film's working title was The Beginning; Lucas later revealed that its true title was The Phantom Menace; a reference to Palpatine hiding his true identity as an evil Sith Lord behind the facade of a well-intentioned public servant.|$|E

5|$|In a {{small sample}} of 11 {{deceased}} dogs, Australian Cattle Dogs had a median longevity of 11.7years (maximum 15.9yrs). A larger survey of 100 deceased dogs yielded a mean longevity of 13.41years {{with a standard deviation of}} 2.36years. The median longevities of breeds of similar size are between 11 and 13years. There is an anecdotal report of a Cattle Dog named Bluey, born in 1910 and living for 29.5years, but the record is unverified. Even if true, Bluey's record <b>age</b> <b>would</b> have to be regarded more as an uncharacteristic exception than as an indicator of common exceptional longevity for the entire breed. It remains, however, that Australian Cattle Dogs generally age well and appear to live on average almost a year longer than most dogs of other breeds in the same weight class. Many members of the breed are still well and active at 12 or 14years of age, and some maintain their sight, hearing and even their teeth until their final days.|$|E

25|$|The {{death rates}} at extreme old ages start to slow down, {{which is the}} {{opposite}} of what would be expected if death by ageing was programmed. From an individual-selection point of view, having genes that would not result in a programmed death by <b>ageing</b> <b>would</b> displace genes that cause programmed death by <b>ageing,</b> as individuals <b>would</b> produce more offspring in their longer lifespan and they could increase the survival of their offspring by providing longer parental support.|$|R

2500|$|Those {{who believe}} in the idea that ageing is an {{unavoidable}} side effect of some necessary function (antagonistic pleiotropy or disposable soma theories) logically tend to believe that attempts to delay <b>ageing</b> <b>would</b> result in unacceptable side effects to the necessary functions.

25|$|Worship of the Holy Spirit was {{promoted}} by Joachim of Fiore, a millenarian prophet who, {{on the basis}} on his interpretation of the Book of Revelation, postulated that 1260 would see {{the beginning of a}} third age. (He himself died in 1202.) The third <b>age</b> <b>would</b> be governed by the Holy Spirit and would represent a monastic governance, in which the hierarchy of the Church would be unnecessary and infidels would unite with Christians. These theories became associated with the Fraticelli strand of the Franciscan Order and were condemned by Pope Alexander IV in 1256.|$|E
25|$|In February 2012, in {{an address}} to the Detroit Economic Club during which he {{discussed}} his recently unveiled economic plan and federal budget proposal, Romney said that to help control government healthcare expenditures, as president he would seek to gradually raise the minimum age for Medicare eligibility.

50|$|Acrobatic {{traditions are}} found in many cultures, and there is {{evidence}} that the earliest such traditions occurred thousands of years ago.

25|$|The {{government}} aided {{through the}} use of both promissory notes and land grants. By promising to pay for the passage of a family the government ensured that the island would be populated and a British colony would be formed. Free passage was installed for women first between the ages of 15-35, while males between the ages of 18–40 years of <b>age</b> <b>would</b> be promised a certain amount of acres of land upon arrival in the New World. This was attributed to the installment of the New Zealand Land act. To further aid with the financial burden, free passage to any immigrant was granted after 1874.|$|E
25|$|There {{were three}} {{possible}} ways to update it. The cheapest {{would have been}} to leave the existing work alone and simply compile a new supplement of perhaps one or two volumes; but then anyone looking for a word or sense and unsure of its <b>age</b> <b>would</b> have to look in three different places. The most convenient choice for the user would have been for the entire dictionary to be re-edited and retypeset, with each change included in its proper alphabetical place; but this would have been the most expensive option, with perhaps 15 volumes required to be produced. The OUP chose a middle approach: combining the new material with the existing supplement to form a larger replacement supplement.|$|E
25|$|According to the {{traditional}} Feast of the Empire of the Holy Spirit, celebrated at the feast of Pentecost, a future, third <b>age</b> <b>would</b> be governed by the Empire of Holy Spirit and would represent a monastic or fraternal governance, in which {{the hierarchy of the}} Catholic Church, the intermediaries, and the organized Churches would be unnecessary, and infidels would unite with Christians by free will. Until the 16th century, this was the main annual festivity in most of the major Portuguese cities, with multiple celebrations in Lisbon (with 8), Porto (4), and Coimbra (3). The Church and the Inquisition would not tolerate a spiritual tradition entirely popular and without the mediation of the clergy at the time, and most importantly, celebrating a future Age which would {{bring an end to the}} Church.|$|E
40|$|By postponing the age {{at which}} chronic {{infirmity}} begins,disability and morbidity could be compressed into a shorter period of the average human life span, resulting in a society in which the active and vital years of life would increase in length, the disabilities and frailties of <b>ageing</b> <b>would</b> be postponed,and the total amount of lifetime disability and morbidity would decrease...|$|R
50|$|It {{has also}} been {{proposed}} that the NGB represents a zone of paleo subduction.
