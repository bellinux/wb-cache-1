40|$|The aim of {{bachelor}} {{thesis is}} to inform about agreements, contracts and documents {{that are needed}} for Air Cargo. Which are charter parties, contracts of carriage, Air Way <b>Bill</b> (<b>AWB)</b> and contracts of insurance. This thesis also deals with international organisations and agreetments that through the years formed conditions and regulations of Air Cargo and which are inherented in these contracts and documents. It clarifies with basic terms in Air Cargo, also with cargo, its packiging and containerization. And finally about finance and tariff rates...|$|R

50|$|In 1985, {{the founder}} and owner of Britt <b>Airways,</b> <b>Bill</b> Britt, sold the airline to People Express. Frank Lorenzo's holding company, Texas Air Corporation, then {{acquired}} People Express, following Texas Air's acquisition of Texas International Airlines (TI). Texas Air Corporation later acquired Continental Airlines (CO) and then merged TI and CO under the Continental name.|$|R
5000|$|Further {{failures}} of this [...] "control" [...] system were uncovered by the EIA when they gained undercover access and filmed ivory carving factories run by Hong Kong traders, including Poon, in the United Arab Emirates. They also collected official trade statistics, <b>airway</b> <b>bills</b> and further evidence in UAE, Singapore and Hong Kong. The UAE statistics showed {{that this country}} alone had imported over 200 tonnes of raw and simply prepared ivory in 1987/88. Almost half of this had come from Tanzania where they had a complete ban on ivory. It underlined that the ivory traders rewarded by CITES with the amnesties were running rings around the system.|$|R

[...] {{and they}} used the slogan [...] "Nobody's Second Class on Southern" [...] in their {{television}} commercials. They were famous for their promotional shot glasses: for a time, differently designed shot glasses were issued each year. Original Southern shot glasses are valued by collectors of airline memorabilia.|$|R
40|$|AbstractFor the {{conduction}} {{of quantitative}} research on airfreight related topics, this contribution summarizes recent efforts to handle intra-continental airfreight surface transport {{operations in the}} context of an origin and destination routing model. The distinguishing features of this approach are the O-D scope in combination with the explicit use of period timetables of a sample week, not just weekly averages. Two forms of appearance on intra-continental short- and medium-haul routes – with a complementary and a substitutive function regarding cargo flights – are distinguished: Access and egress of consolidation/deconsolidation airports for delivery and pick-up, and airline trucking (“road feeder services”/RFS, “truck-flights”) of <b>airway</b> <b>billed</b> consignments between two airports. The methodology comprises an empirical characterization of the supply side of both the air cargo consolidation and the airline trucking markets, the subsequent modeling of surface transport links within a scheduled network in terms of the surface links’ network topology, attainable journey times and hours-of service regulation for truck driving, and the simulation of RFS load pattern {{in the context of}} a global air cargo model...|$|R
50|$|In August 1945, {{only two}} days after the end of World War II, the Australian {{parliament}} passed the Australian National <b>Airways</b> <b>Bill,</b> which set up the Australian National Airways Commission (ANAC) and charged it with the task of reconstructing the nation's air transport industry. In keeping with the Labor government's socialist leanings, the bill declared that the licenses of private operators would lapse for those routes that were adequately serviced by the national carrier. From this time on, it seemed, air transport in Australia would be a government monopoly. However, a legal challenge, backed by the Liberal opposition and business interests generally, was successful and in December 1945, the High Court ruled that the Commonwealth did not have the power to prevent the issue of airline licenses to private companies. The government could set up an airline if it wished, but it could not legislate a monopoly. Much of the press objected strongly to the setting up of a public airline network, seeing it as a form of socialisation by stealth.|$|R
40|$|One of {{the most}} {{enduring}} images of 20 th-century British history is of Neville Chamberlain descending the steps of a shining new aircraft, triumphantly waving that fateful 'piece of paper'. But another scrap of paper related to Chamberlain's flight to Munich - British <b>Airways</b> Ltd's <b>bill</b> for the return flight - sheds light not only on Britain's developing civil aviation industry but also on relations between Whitehall departments. The question of which department should {{be responsible for the}} bill dragged on for several months, revealing Whitehall's determination that the expenditure should be correctly attributed...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this final project is to obtain a more in depth {{overview}} and {{understanding of how the}} mechanism creation bc 2. 3 document using electronic data interchange system and what are the obstacles in implementing enterprise as well as how companies overcome these barriers. The research method used is a case study, which took a particular object to be analyzed in dept by focusing on a problem. The data used are primary data and secondary primary. Data collected througt direct interviews with PT. Jaya Asri Garmindo this part of imports, the head of shipping, the staff while secondary data obtained from other reading books that are related to the subject in preparing the final project. The results can be concluded that the mechanism of making BC 2. 3 with Electronic Data Interchange on PT. Jaya Asri Garmindo there are 3 stages, the first creation bc 2. 3 document second step print bc 2. 3 documents and third send BC 2. 3 document with EDI (Electronic Daata Interchange) system. Barries in manufacturing bc 2. 3 document include the responses given customs less informative so difficult to understand and no finding of manifest post when charging data <b>airway</b> <b>bill.</b> Advice that can be raised is that largescale companies provide training to the staff of the import section of the advances in technology, especially in EDI system to improve the ability to master the system so as to master the existing problem.

50|$|As {{a result}} of growing {{financial}} difficulties, Aeroamerica voluntarily surrendered its operating permit during an informal meeting with the FAA {{at the end of}} 1979. This action on the airline's part in turn resulted in legal action brought against it by an aircraft lessor and British <b>Airways</b> over unpaid <b>bills</b> concerning the former Berlin operation, as well as the seizure of one of the company's aircraft at Tegel Airport.|$|R
40|$|In May 1998, the Dutch {{government}} asked RIVM to make {{an assessment}} of the human exposure that could have resulted from the 1992 airplane crash in Amsterdam. The request was prompted by persistent health complaints of the bystanders of the crash. Starting point of the health risk assessment was the latest version of the list of <b>Airway</b> Cargo <b>Bills.</b> In addition to this, the amount of kerosine at the moment of the crash was calculated and the quantity of depleted uranium that was not recovered after the crash. These data were completed with an estimate of the amount of synthetics, heavy metals and flame retardants in the plane. After dispersion-modelling it was concluded that environmental concentrations immediately following the crash could have resulted in acute effects, like irritation of eyes and bronchi, but that no persistent health complaints had to be expected. There was however an increased risk to develop cancer {{as a result of the}} exposure. For depleted uranium this amounted to 1 additional case of cancer per 1 x 109 persons exposed and for PAH's and heavy metals to 1 - 2 additional cases of cancer per 1 x 104 persons exposed. Caution is needed in interpreting these data, due to the lack of measurements in the acute phase and the long period between exposure and the study...|$|R
