After adjustment for age, gender and socioeconomic area of residence, logistic regression analyses showed higher risks of injury to be related to fewer years of parents' education, a history of accident to a family member, an environment judged as unsafe, and poor parental supervision. Absence of physical health problems, fewer family preventive behaviors and reported lack of cautiousness were also related to a higher risk, whereas neither aggressivity nor behavioral disturbance, whether internalizing or externalizing, showed any such relation.

Each participating center received a registrar training course that included information about TQIP objectives and infrastructures, critical data collection fields, and NTDS data definitions. Webinars with conference calls and test case data abstraction were used for follow-up training. Using NTDB data from patients admitted to trauma centers between January 1 and December 1, 2007, three cohorts were created. The first cohort included patients with blunt multisystem or blunt mechanism traumas with an <b>Abbreviated</b> <b>Injury</b> <b>Scale</b> (AIS) score ≥ 3 in two or more regions including the head, face, neck, thorax, abdomen, spine, and extremities. The second cohort was composed of trauma patients with penetrating truncal injuries with an AIS score ≥ 3 in at least one region including the neck, thorax, and abdomen. Patients in the third cohort had a blunt single-system injury with an AIS score ≥ 3 in only one AIS body region, with the remaining regions having a maximum AIS score of 2. The outcomes of interest were death during hospitalization as evidenced by an emergency department (ED) discharge disposition of “death” or hospital discharge disposition of “expired,” as well as the prevalence of inpatient complications.|$|E

METHODS: Data were from the National Automotive Sampling System (1993 - 1996). Injury severity was described {{on the basis of}} the <b>Abbreviated</b> <b>Injury</b> <b>Scale,</b> Injury Severity Score, Functional Capacity Index, and survival. Ordinal, linear, and logistic multivariate regression methods were used. RESULTS: Air bag deployment in frontal or near-frontal crashes decreases the probability of having severe and fatal injuries (e. g., <b>Abbreviated</b> <b>Injury</b> <b>Scale</b> score of 4 - 6), including those causing a long-lasting high degree of functional limitation. However, air bag deployment in low-severity crashes increases the probability that a driver (particularly a woman) will sustain injuries of <b>Abbreviated</b> <b>Injury</b> <b>Scale</b> level 1 to 3. Air bag deployment exerts a net injurious effect in low-severity crashes and a net protective effect in high-severity crashes. The level of crash severity at which air bags are protective is higher for female than for male drivers. CONCLUSIONS: Air bag improvement should minimize the injuries induced by their deployment. One possibility is to raise their deployment level so that they deploy only in more severe crashes...|$|E

The severity of the injuries was classified using the <b>Abbreviated</b> <b>Injury</b> <b>Scale</b> score and the New Injury Severity Score. The hospital injury data were compared to the traffic accident statistics reported by the police and compiled and maintained by Statistics Finland. Results: A total of 49 motorcyclists and 61 moped drivers were involved in crashes, leading to a total of 94 and 109 injuries, respectively. There were slightly more vertebral and midfoot fractures among motorcyclists than among moped drivers (p= 0. 038 and 0. 016, respectively).
