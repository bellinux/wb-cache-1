Marked increases in gamma globulin, however, are also found to be due in large part to elevated plasma lipid levels in certain abnormal human plasmas.

40|$|In rabbits, the {{depletion}} of cartilage matrix which occurs following intravenous administration of papain treated with iodacetamide is attributable to {{a portion of the}} enzyme in the disulfide form which has not undergone alkylation. It is this portion that is reactivated in cartilage in vivo and initiates the enzymatic breakdown of the protein-polysaccharide complex which forms a major component of the matrix. Evidence presented in support of these conclusions indicates that, contrary to an earlier hypothesis, papain acetamide is not reactivated in vivo. Following intravenous injection in amounts up to 4 mg. /kg., active and inactive papain leaves the circulation at a rate proportional to the concentration, and {{it is likely that the}} initial rate of disappearance represents equilibration with the extracellular space. Following injection in the active or inactive form, a high proportion of papain in serum is bound to protein in the <b>alpha</b> <b>globulin</b> fraction. It is believed that in the case of fully active papain, the proportion which is not bound to <b>alpha</b> <b>globulin</b> becomes attached to other proteins of serum in extracellular fluid, such as albumin, by a process of enzyme substrate combination, and is thus prevented from diffusing into cartilage. In the case of inactive papain, a comparable excess remains free to enter cartilage, where it initiates depletion of matrix following reactivation within the tissue. These conclusions provide an explanation for the failure of fully active papain to cause depletion of cartilage matrix in vivo; the widespread changes seen after the injection of papain inactivated by iodoacetamide or by simple reversible oxidation are attributable to a small proportion of the injected material which enters cartilage in the disulfide form in a concentration of approximately 2 micrograms/gm. wet weight. The possibility that such a small amount of protease, when reactivated, can produce changes in cartilage matrix has been confirmed by studies on the effects of papain on isolated cartilage and chondromucoprotein in vitro. It has been shown that severe local injury results when active papain is injected into the skin of a rabbit in low concentrations. Since a much higher concentration of papain can be attained in the circulation without obvious adverse effects, it is evident that binding of the protease by <b>alpha</b> <b>globulin</b> and possibly other serum proteins may exemplify a mechanism whereby the tissues are protected from injury following entry into the circulation of other potentially harmful agents, such as proteolytic enzymes derived from cells or bacteria...|$|E

Gamma type myeloma proteins (5563, MPC- 11) showed a close immunochemical relationship to normal mouse gamma globulins. Eighteen beta type mouse myeloma proteins migrated as beta or <b>alpha</b> <b>globulins</b> on zone electrophoresis. These proteins shared common antigenic features which permitted their recognition, separate from gamma myeloma proteins. The beta type myeloma proteins were shown to be related to a beta globulin component present in normal serum. Strain differences were observed for the normal beta globulin component believed to be formed in plasma cells. The proteins formed in mouse plasma cells were found to be antigenically complex. Shared antigenic determinants as well as distinctive antigenic determinants were detected when representative myeloma proteins were purified and compared by the Ouchterlony double diffusion technique. The myeloma proteins associated with each of the transplantable plasma cell tumors in mice are regarded as distinctive and characteristic products of plasma cell metabolism. The variety of myeloma globulins was similar for plasma cell tumors arising in C 3 H as well as in BALB/c mice, indicating that differences in mouse strains would not account for the differences among the myeloma globulins. These differences, however, may be due to differences among the normal plasma cells from which the malignant cells are derived. If this is so, the variety of myeloma globulins reflect the variety of plasma cells present normally...|$|R

Maximum promotion (approximately five-fold) of alph 1 AP globulin synthesis was observed after administration of alpha 1 M complexed with trypsin or alpha 1 M alone, which after purification had lost most of its trypsin-protein-esterase (T.

Slightly lesser but still significant degrees of enhancement (approximately four-fold) of <b>alpha</b> 1 AP <b>globulin</b> synthesis resulted from the injection of alpha 1 M alone or complexed with trypsin, which after purification had retained sitnificant T.

This predominantly intravascular glycoprotein serves as the principal circulatory porteinase binder. Proteinases released in response to tissue injury, necrosis or inflammation would be bound and inactivated by alpha 1 M, and in turn the alpha 1 M-proteinase complex would stimulate the liver to synthesize a number of acute-phase proteins.

A sternal marrow examination before beginning intravenous iron therapy showed several clumps of up to seven or eight plasma cells, and a percentage of plasma cells amounting to 4. 8 in 1, 000 marrow cells counted. Many of these plasma cells were vacuolated, with irregularity of the cytoplasmic basophilia, and an occasional plasmablast was seen. Multiple myeloma-tosis was considered as a possible diagnosis, but further clinical examination and investigations excluded this condition. It was concluded that the finding was incidental, though perhaps related to rheumatoid arthritis. Numerous studies of the sedimentation rate, colloidal gold tests, and plasma viscosity have shown a disturbance in the serum protein fractions in rheumatoid arthritis, and Perlmann and Kaufman (1946) by electrophoretic analysis of the sera from 23 cases showed that the <b>alpha</b> <b>globulins</b> were raised early in the disease and the gamma globulins later. They suggested that articular and synovial damage ma...|$|R
