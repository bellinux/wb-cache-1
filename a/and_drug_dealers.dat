5|$|By {{the late}} 1990s, the O Street Market had once more become dilapidated. The {{structure}} fell into disrepair, trash collected around the building, many vendors were squatters without leases, <b>and</b> <b>drug</b> <b>dealers</b> and gang members loitered nearby, driving customers away. The building's owner fell behind on tax payments, {{and the city}} threatened to place a lien on the building and foreclose.|$|E
5|$|Dr. Kroger tells Monk he {{has found}} a therapist, Dr. Jonah Sorenson (Rick Curry); in session, he remembers where the rock came from. Monk goes to Dr. Kroger's office and shows Dr. Kroger the rock came from the courtyard, to which only Dr. Kroger and Merrigan have access to. In Merrigan's office, they find {{powdered}} milk but not a coffeemaker and, as powdered milk is made from lactose <b>and</b> <b>drug</b> <b>dealers</b> use it to cut heroin, Monk deduces Merrigan is trafficking drugs, and he probably also killed Teresa. Suddenly, Merrigan appears, ties them to chairs, and loads them {{into the back of}} his truck.|$|E
5|$|The prison barge was {{temporarily}} closed in August 1995 due to less crowded city jails, {{caused by a}} decline in arrests and inmate transfers. In late 1996, the prison was slated for reopening due to the rise in arrests from a campaign targeting drugs <b>and</b> <b>drug</b> <b>dealers.</b> The six-month campaign expected more than seven thousand additional arrests than usual, but the ship was not reopened until 1998 when it {{was used by the}} Department of Juvenile Justice. The Bain Center is currently used as a processing facility for inmates in the Department of Corrections system. There are three other processing facilities that each handle specific boroughs.|$|E

25|$|Along {{with the}} {{physical}} renovation of the property was the community transformation. The first step in this transformation was securing the building from the gangs <b>and</b> <b>drug</b> <b>dealers.</b> The new owner installed a state-of-the-art camera system to help deter the rampant criminal activity occurring in the buildings. In a short time, this along with other security measures, helped to eliminate the frequent police visits to the property. Dunbar went from {{being one of the}} most visited properties by the police to a safe and secure community.|$|E
25|$|Born in Algeria, Sid Ahmed Rezala {{moved with}} his parents, {{brothers}} and sister {{to the southern}} French port of Marseille in 1994. Within weeks of registering at a Marseille high school, he began playing truant and mixing with petty criminals <b>and</b> <b>drug</b> <b>dealers</b> around the Marseille St Charles Train Station, and riding on trains. In early 1995, Rezala was arrested for the rape, three months before his 16th birthday, of a 14-year-old boy. On December 7, 1995, the 16-year-old rapist was sentenced in juvenile court to four years imprisonment. He was released in late 1996 after 18 months in prison.|$|E

While CJ helps Sweet once again kill the rival gangs, Tenpenny is arrested and tried for felonies that he has been charged with, but the charges are dropped due to lack of evidence, prompting a citywide riot. CJ helps Cesar regain control over the barrio and also regain territory for his gang, so as to have enough power to obtain knowledge of Big Smoke's whereabouts.|$|E

500|$|The {{government}} had {{at one point}} considered allowing [...] "mini brothels", but abandoned this plan after fears that such establishments would bring pimps <b>and</b> <b>drug</b> <b>dealers</b> into residential areas. Instead, the laws became tougher: the [...] Policing and Crime Act 2009 made it illegal to pay for sex with a prostitute who has been [...] "subjected to force" [...] {{and this is a}} strict liability offense (clients can be prosecuted even if they did not know the prostitute was forced).|$|E
500|$|In 2002, a First Tee course, {{for young}} golfers, {{opened at the}} Mosholu course.

Prior to the renovation, there was poor management, dirty grounds, and [...] "a proliferation of prostitutes <b>and</b> <b>drug</b> <b>dealers</b> operating much too close for comfort plagued the grounds." [...] The renovation overhauled the course with such improvements as seven new greens and a new drainage system. The clubhouse received an infusion of historic golf artifacts from NYC Parks, including [...] "vintage photographs" [...] and an exhibit {{about the history of}} the golf ball.|$|E
500|$|Along {{with its}} narratives, Illmatic is also {{distinct}} for its many portrayals {{and descriptions of}} places, people, and interactions. In his songs, Nas often depicts the corners and boulevards of Queensbridge, while mentioning the names of streets, friends, local crews <b>and</b> <b>drug</b> <b>dealers,</b> and utilizing vernacular slang indigenous to his hometown. Poet and author Kevin Coval describes this approach to songwriting {{as that of a}} “hip-hop poet-reporter...rooted in the intimate specificity of locale.” Commenting on Nas's use of narrative, Sohail Daulatzai, Professor of Film and Media Studies at University of Southern California, compares the album to cinema, citing its [...] "detailed descriptions, dense reportage, and visually stunning rhymes..." [...] In , he writes: [...] "Like the 1965 landmark masterpiece film The Battle of Algiers, which captured the Algerian resistance against French colonialism, Illmatic brilliantly blurred the lines between fiction and documentary, creating a heightened sense of realism and visceral eloquence for Nas's renegade first-person narratives and character-driven odes.” ...|$|E

500|$|After graduation, she briefly {{joined the}} Black Panther Party and, rejecting her [...] "slave name", adopted the name Assata Shakur. She then joined the Black Liberation Army, a loosely-knit {{offshoot}} of the Black Panthers which led an armed struggle against the U.S. government through tactics such as holding up banks and killing police officers <b>and</b> <b>drug</b> <b>dealers.</b> Between 1971 and 1973, she was charged with several crimes and {{was the subject of}} a multi-state manhunt. In May 1973, Shakur was arrested after being wounded in a shootout on the New Jersey Turnpike. Also involved in the shootout were New Jersey State Troopers Werner Foerster and James Harper and BLA members Sundiata Acoli and Zayd Malik Shakur. Harper was wounded; Zayd was killed; Foerster was killed by Acoli. Between 1973 and 1977, she was charged with murder, attempted murder, armed robbery, bank robbery, and kidnapping in relation to six other incidents. She was acquitted on three of the charges and three were dismissed. In 1977, she was convicted of the murder of Foerster (under New Jersey law the prosecution did not need to prove that Shakur fired the shots that killed either Foerster or Zayd Shakur) and of seven other felonies related to the shootout, in a trial her supporters argue was unfair.|$|E
500|$|Many of {{the themes}} found in Illmatic revolve around Nas’s {{experience}} living {{in an environment where}} poverty, violence, and drug use abound. Throughout the 1980s and early 1990s, residents of Queensbridge experienced intense violence, as the housing development was overrun by the crack epidemic. Illmatic contains imagery inspired by this prevalence of street crime. In [...] "N.Y. State of Mind", Nas details the trap doors, rooftop snipers, street corner lookouts, <b>and</b> <b>drug</b> <b>dealers</b> that pervade his urban [...] Sohail Daulatzai describes this language as [...] "chilling" [...] and suggests that it “harrowingly describes and imagines with such surreal imagery, with so much noir discontent and even more fuck-you ambition, the fragile and tenuous lives of ghetto dwellers…” Author Adam Mansbach interprets Nas's violent aesthetics as a metaphoric device meant to authenticate the rough edges of his persona: [...] "Nas's world and worldview are criminal and criminalized. Hence, he uses metaphoric violence as a central trope of his poetic.” Writer and musician Gregory Tate regards this violent imagery as part of a trend towards dark subject matter that came to prevail among East Coast rappers in the hardcore hip hop scene. He writes, “ome of the most memorably dark, depressive but flowing lyrics in hip hop history were written by Nas, Biggie, and members of the Wu-Tang Clan on the death knell of the crack trade.|$|E
2500|$|In September 2012 the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) accused Walgreens of {{endangering}} {{public safety}} and barred the company from shipping oxycodone and other controlled drugs from its Jupiter, Florida, distribution center. The DEA said that Walgreens failed to maintain proper controls to ensure it didn't dispense drugs to addicts <b>and</b> <b>drug</b> <b>dealers.</b> [...] The DEA also said that six of Walgreens' Florida pharmacies ordered in excess of a million oxycodone pills a year. [...] In contrast, in 2011, the average pharmacy in the U.S. ordered 73,000 oxycodone tablets a year according to the DEA. [...] One Walgreens pharmacy located in Fort Myers, Florida, ordered 95,800 pills in 2009, but by 2011 this number had jumped to 2.2 million pills in one year. [...] Another example was a Walgreens pharmacy located in Hudson, Fla., a town of 34,000 people near Clearwater, that purchased 2.2 million pills in 2011, the DEA said. [...] Immediate suspension orders are an action taken when the DEA believes a registrant, such as a pharmacy or a doctor, is [...] "an imminent danger to the public safety." [...] All DEA licensees [...] "have an obligation to ensure that medications are getting {{into the hands of}} legitimate patients," [...] said Mark Trouville, former DEA {{special agent in charge of}} the Miami Field Division.

2500|$|The Sons of Anarchy (SOA) is {{an outlaw}} {{motorcycle}} club with many charters in the United States {{as well as}} overseas. The show focuses on the original and founding ("mother") charter, Sons of Anarchy Motorcycle Club, Redwood Original, referred to by the acronym SAMCRO or Sam Crow, located in the fictional town of Charming, California, adjacent to the Teller-Morrow auto mechanic shop. Its nickname {{is reflected in the}} original title for the show, Forever Sam Crow. [...] Led by President Clay Morrow, the club 'protects' and controls Charming through close community relationships, bribery, and violent intimidation. In the early seasons they are vehement about keeping [...] "hard" [...] drugs <b>and</b> <b>drug</b> <b>dealers</b> out of Charming. They also do not tolerate sex criminals.

2500|$|SAMCRO keeps meth traffickers <b>and</b> <b>drug</b> <b>dealers</b> out of Charming, {{which puts}} them {{at odds with}} the meth-distributing white {{supremacist}} Nordics (AKA Nords), headed by Ernest Darby. This earns them respect and admiration from the townspeople, who believe the Sons do more to protect their town than its own police. SAMCRO also has to deal with a rival, Oakland-based motorcycle club (MC), the Mayans led by Marcus Alvarez (played by Emilio Rivera, who also appeared in The Shield as Mexican drug dealer Navarro Quintero). Other groups in SAMCRO's orbit include the San Francisco–based Chinese mafia Lin Triad, led by Henry Lin; the Italian American Cacuzza crime family; the Russian mob led by Viktor Putlova; the Real IRA (aka RIRA) of Ireland, which supplies them with illegal Russian-made guns; the [...] "One-Niners", an African American street gang (which also appeared on The Shield, thus possibly putting the two in the same fictional universe) to whom SAMCRO sell weapons; and various affiliates in the state prison system, where many members of the club have been incarcerated at one time or another. These gangs serve important roles in either being enemies of the clubs or soon to be partners with the MC to bring in more money.|$|E
