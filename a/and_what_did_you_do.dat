30|$|Two {{types of}} data were {{collected}} to conduct the case study. Documents reporting on the different meetings with the citizens and community groups were obtained (see Appendix 2 for the list of documents). These documents were provided by the local planners and typically consist of reports of the consultations with the citizens written by the boroughs or consultancy. These documents {{were used to assess}} the issues and themes that came up during the meetings (RQ 1). A limitation {{of this study is that}} there were no tapes or transcriptions of the public participation events. Accordingly, the authors relied on a report of the events written by the consulting firm or the borough itself. Nevertheless, these reports highlight which information was retained as a result of the meeting. In addition to the documents, we conducted semi-structured interviews with local planners and representatives of community groups in order to gain a better understanding of the planning process and the underlying perspectives on transportation planning (RQ 2 and RQ 3). The interviews were complemented with phone discussions. Interviews were chosen over survey since they allow studying the understandings and perspectives of the actors (Gomm, 2004), which are central to our research questions. The list of the interviewees is found in Appendix 2. The interviewees were purposively selected, based on the groups that are relevant to the research problem [56]. The selection of community groups was guided by the ability to reach disadvantaged groups, especially from a socio-economic point of view, but also in terms of transport (elderly and disabled people). In total, 2 local planners (1 in each borough), 8 representatives of community groups and a representative of the consulting firm were interviewed. Distinct interview guides were prepared for the local planners, the community groups, and the consulting firm. The local planners were asked general questions about the transportation planning processes at the borough level, including their responsibilities, their priorities and their vision in terms of local transport. They were then asked about their goals and approaches to the development of the Local Transport Plan, and more specifically, to the participatory process itself. More specifically, they were asked about the stakeholders’ involvement as well as the benefits, outcomes and challenges associated with the participatory process. Examples of questions include: What are the issues and priorities in the borough in terms of transport? What were the goals of the participatory process, <b>and</b> <b>what</b> <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> to achieve these goals? How did you reach out to citizens for the participatory process? The representative of the consulting firm was specifically asked about their responsibilities and objectives in the participatory processes, and about how the process was conducted. Finally, representatives of the community groups were asked about the transport-related issues experienced by their members, their participation in the participatory process, and their perception of the process itself, and of the LTP more broadly. Examples of questions include: What issues do your members experience in terms of transport? Did you participate in the LTP participatory process, and if so, how? How was the participatory process conducted? Interviews were recorded and transcribed. One interviewee refused to be recorded, and notes were taken during the interview and used instead of a transcription.|$|E
