Graduates are graded and assigned accordingly to one of three options: the Advanced Strike course at Minhad on the Hawk 102 aircraft, transport aircraft, and helicopters. At Minhad, the new pilots learn Basic Fighters Manoeuvres, drop bombs and learn to fly cross-country to a neighbouring country, commonly Bahrain or Kuwait. Upon completion of the Advanced Strike course, officers are selected either for the F-16 (Block 60) or the Dassault Mirage 2000-9, both at Al Dhafra AB.

40|$|Measurement {{invariance}} is a pre-requisite {{for drawing}} accurate and valid inferences concerning individuals’ trait levels from questionnaire data. However, several factors exist that can influence a person’s item responses {{in addition to}} his or her latent trait level. The research in this dissertation was aimed at investigating three of these factors: 1) individual differences in response styles, 2) the measurement invariance of items between subgroups of respondents, and 3) the measurement invariance of items across <b>assessment</b> <b>periods.</b> Mixed Rasch analyses of data from the German NEO-PI-R showed that respondents differed systematically in their response scale use: some preferred extreme categories while others preferred moderate categories. Multidimensional item response models showed that response styles (especially extreme response style) explained variance in item responses that was incremental to the variance explained by the traits. Thus, individual differences in response styles had an influence on item responses. The measurement invariance of items between subgroups of respondents was investigated with respect to differential item functioning for gender in the German NEO-PI-R. Several NEO-PI-R facets especially on neuroticism, agreeableness, and conscientiousness contained items that were not measurement invariant for men and women. The measurement invariance of items across <b>assessment</b> <b>periods</b> was investigated for link items from the reading and science domains in the Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA). Measurement invariance was violated for both item sets. Some items showed large differences in item difficulty between assessments which may in part be attributed to changes in item wording and position effects. In sum, it was shown that individual differences in response styles, the lack of measurement invariance of items between subgroups of respondents, and the lack of measurement invariance of items across <b>assessment</b> <b>periods</b> can impair the measurement of the intended traits and in consequence render trait inferences and comparisons between individuals or groups invalid. Thus, measures should be taken to reduce the impact of factors that interfere with measurement invariance. These measures can be aimed at test construction where, for example, the item or response format can be adjusted to elicit response styles to a lesser degree and items can be selected that have invariance properties across subgroups of participants and across <b>assessment</b> <b>periods.</b> ...|$|R

Nine children (4. 8 years old {{at the beginning of the}} study) with intellectual disabilities (ID) (eight with mild ID; one with moderate ID) were assessed every 3 months for approximately 1 year, totaling four assessments.

Research in the field of controller performance assessment, particularly the performance of multivariate Model-based Predictive Controllers, was investigated. Existing performance indices proposed in the literature were assessed for their suitability to Alcoa’s applications. For the greater part, these methods are not suited to the specific characteristics and functionality of Honeywell RMPCT. A CPA metric entitled Event Frequency Performance Index (EFPI) is proposed in this report. It is a composite metric comprising five component metrics each of which are designed to gauge different aspects of RMPCT performance.
