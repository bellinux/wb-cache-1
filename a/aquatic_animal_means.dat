Among others, there are two areas of investigation, utilizing pathobiological methods, that appear promising in toxicology of <b>aquatic</b> <b>animals.</b> These areas of inquiry are based on two questions: 1) Are there indicative sublethal cytopathic changes that occur in <b>aquatic</b> <b>animals</b> exposed to low levels of pollutant chemicals?, and 2) Are there interactions between natural pathogens (e. g. parasites) and pollutant chemicals in <b>aquatic</b> <b>animals</b> that will produce harmful synergistic effects?

40|$|The {{increasing}} {{importance of}} aquaculture, at present, is undoubtedly recognized. The sector {{is expected to}} effectively contribute to food security, nutritional well-being, poverty reduction and economic development. However, biosecurity lapses and transboundary <b>aquatic</b> <b>animal</b> diseases pose significant constraints to aquaculture sustainability. This paper discusses how aquaculture development brings new chal-lenges to <b>aquatic</b> <b>animal</b> health. These challenges include compliance to international treaties, practical implementation of regional guidelines and national strategies, in-creasing biosecurity and biosecurity awareness at all levels, empowering farmers to manage disease and other risks through better management practices, and conduct-ing targeted research that will support biosecurity assessments. A short brief on emerg-ing and re-emerging issues such as chemical usage, climate change and disease ecol-ogy, fish welfare and fish health, fish-vet cooperation and certification scheme for <b>aquatic</b> <b>animal</b> health service providers is included.

These genes were distributed under four major steps of toxicology regulation: formation of cytosolic complex, translocation of AhR, heterodimerization of AhR and induction of CYP 1 A. The NJ, MP, and ML algorithm were used on protein coding DNA sequences to deduce the evolutionary relationship for the respective AhR pathway gene among different <b>aquatic</b> <b>animals.</b> The rate of non-synonymous nucleotide substitutions per non-synonymous site (d(N)) and synonymous nucleotide substitutions per synonymous site (d(S)) were calculated for different clade of the respective phylogenetic tree for each AhR pathway gene. The phylogenetic analysis suggests that evolutionary pattern of AhR pathway genes in <b>aquatic</b> <b>animals</b> is characterized mainly through gene duplication events or alterative splicing. The d(N) values indicate that all AhR pathway genes are well conserved in <b>aquatic</b> <b>animals,</b> except for CYP 1 A gene. Furthermore, compare with other <b>aquatic</b> <b>animals,</b> the d(N) value indicates that AhR pathway genes of fish are less conserved, and these genes likely go through an adaptive evolution within <b>aquatic</b> <b>animals.</b> Crown Copyright (C) 2009 Published by Elsevier Ltd.
