5|$|After the loss, MacShara {{withdrew from}} the case but Rudzewicz appealed the {{decision}} to the United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit. In the filing, Rudzewicz claimed that since they were residents of Michigan, and because the claims did not arise within the Southern District of Florida, that District Court lacked personal jurisdiction over them. Additionally Rudzewicz argued that the long-arm statute violated the 14th Amendment and was unconstitutional. Citing <b>a</b> <b>similar</b> <b>case,</b> World-Wide Volkswagen Corp. v. Woodson, the Appeals court agreed with the defendants and overturned the lower court's decision. The court also agreed with Rudzewicz's assertion of the constitutionality of Florida's long arm statute in its application to the case.|$|E
5|$|Casinos {{and race}} tracks were closed because {{official}} monitors from the New Jersey Casino Control Commission and the New Jersey Racing Commission, respectively, {{were categorized as}} non-essential. At the time, New Jersey law precluded gambling establishments from operating absent state oversight. Originally, the race tracks were scheduled to close with the first wave on July 1, but a State Court order allowed them to close later. The casinos attempted <b>a</b> <b>similar</b> <b>case,</b> arguing that the state monitors overseeing the casinos were not paid by the state but by the casinos themselves, but the appeal was rejected at the New Jersey Supreme Court; therefore {{they were forced to}} close.|$|E

5|$|However, in 1955, in <b>a</b> <b>similar</b> <b>case</b> {{involving}} another woman, Mrs. Clarice B. Covert, who {{had killed}} her husband in England with an axe, Federal District Court Judge Edward A. Tamm ruled that civilians who accompany military forces overseas could not be imprisoned by military courts. The two cases, Kinsella v. Krueger and Reid v. Covert, went to the US Supreme Court, which affirmed that military trials of civilians were indeed constitutional, only to reverse itself a year later {{in a review of}} the decisions. Dorothy was released, and went to live with Krueger in San Antonio.|$|E
5|$|When Maxwell {{concluded}} his argument, ex-Governor Bradley {{spoke on}} Taylor's behalf. After reiterating Taylor's legal {{claim to the}} office of governor, he answered the question of jurisdiction by citing Thayer v. Boyd, <b>a</b> <b>similar</b> <b>case</b> in which the court had assumed jurisdiction. He further quoted authorities who opined that an elected office was property, using this to contend that Taylor's rights under the Fourteenth Amendment had been violated, thus giving the court jurisdiction. Also, Bradley asserted, the election of some members of the Assembly's contest committee would hinge on the decision of that very committee. At least one member of the committee was known to have wagered on the election's outcome. These facts should have nullified the decision of the committee and the Assembly {{on the grounds that it}} had left some members as judges of their own cases. Finally, Bradley cited irregularities in the proceedings of the contest committee, including insufficient time given for the review of testimony provided in written form by Taylor and Marshall's legal representation. Following Bradley's argument, the court recessed until May 14, 1900.|$|E
5|$|The {{cases of}} Taylor and Marshall were {{appealed to the}} Kentucky Court of Appeals, then to the Supreme Court of the United States. In the case of Taylor v. Beckham, Bradley countered Democrats' claims that the federal courts should not have {{jurisdiction}} by citing Thayer v. Boyd, <b>a</b> <b>similar</b> <b>case</b> in which the court had assumed jurisdiction. He further quoted authorities who opined that an elected office was property, using this to contend that Taylor's rights under the Fourteenth Amendment had been violated, thus giving the court jurisdiction. Also, Bradley asserted, the election of {{some members of the}} General Assembly's contest committee would hinge on the decision of that very committee. At least one member of the committee was known to have wagered on the election's outcome. These facts should have nullified the decision of the committee and the Assembly {{on the grounds that it}} had left some members as judges of their own cases, Bradley argued. Finally, Bradley cited irregularities in the proceedings of the contest committee, including giving insufficient time for the review of testimony provided in written form by Taylor and Marshall's legal representation. The court refused to intervene in the case, however, because it found that there were no federal questions involved. The lone justice dissenting from that opinion was Kentuckian John Marshall Harlan.|$|E

25|$|The 2005 {{controversy}} {{came after}} a related lawsuit settled in 2002 in Texas. That lawsuit, alleging exorbitant late fees, led the company to pay $9.25 million in attorney fees and offer $450 million in late fee refund coupons (which were rent-one get-one-free coupons, and thus required the customer to make an initial expenditure). The company estimated that the coupons would ultimately cost about $45 million depending on the redemption rate; {{an attorney for the}} plaintiffs estimated the final cost at closer to $100 million at a redemption rate of about 20% (calculated based on <b>a</b> <b>similar</b> <b>case</b> in Michigan).|$|E
