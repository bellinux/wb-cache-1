5|$|At {{the end of}} the 19th {{century the}} main {{industries}} were tobacco <b>and</b> <b>cigarette</b> manufacture, led by the dominant W.D. & H.O. Wills company, paper and engineering. The port facilities were migrating downstream to Avonmouth and new industrial complexes were founded there.|$|E
5|$|The post-war period {{witnessed}} both {{expansion and}} the commissioning of new products. The company always ensured its products {{were covered by}} patent and trade mark, a policy prosecuted with vigour from the outset. The early 1920s saw the wholesale and export {{side of the business}} move to Notting Hill Gate, close to the pipe <b>and</b> <b>cigarette</b> division located at Campden Hill Road.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} {{industries}} and sources have been implicated, including {{high levels of}} dust in coal mining, gold mining, and the cotton textile industry, occupations involving cadmium and isocyanates, and fumes from welding. Working in agriculture is also a risk. In some professions the risks have been estimated as equivalent to that of one half to two packs of cigarettes a day. Silica dust and fiberglass dust exposure {{can also lead to}} COPD, with the risk unrelated to that for silicosis. The negative effects of dust exposure <b>and</b> <b>cigarette</b> smoke exposure appear to be additive or possibly more than additive.|$|E

5|$|Although Bristol's economy {{no longer}} relies upon its port, which {{was moved to}} docks at Avonmouth during the 1870s and to the Royal Portbury Dock in 1977 as ship size increased, {{it is the largest}} {{importer}} of cars to the UK. Until 1991, the port was publicly owned; it is leased, with £330million invested and its annual tonnage increasing from 3.9million long tons (4million tonnes) to 11.8million (12million). Tobacco importing <b>and</b> <b>cigarette</b> manufacturing have ceased, but the importation of wine and spirits continues.|$|E
5|$|Genetics {{is thought}} to be the primary cause of acne in 80% of cases. The role of diet <b>and</b> <b>cigarette</b> smoking is unclear, and neither {{cleanliness}} nor exposure to sunlight appear to play a part. During puberty, in both sexes, acne is often brought on by an increase in hormones such as testosterone. A frequent factor is excessive growth of the bacterium Propionibacterium acnes, which is normally present on the skin.|$|E
5|$|Suffering {{from what}} would today be {{described}} as post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), Murphy slept with a loaded handgun under his pillow. He looked for solace in addictive sleeping pills. In his last few years, he was plagued by money problems but refused offers to appear in alcohol <b>and</b> <b>cigarette</b> commercials {{because he did not}} want to set a bad example. Murphy died in a plane crash in Virginia in 1971, which was shortly before his 46th birthday. He was interred with full military honors at Arlington National Cemetery. His grave is one of the most visited sites in the cemetery.|$|E

5|$|The Genesis {{represents}} Sega's {{entry into}} the 16-bit era of video game consoles. In Japan, Sega released the Mega Jet, a portable version of the Mega Drive designed for use on Japan Airlines flights. As a condensed version, the Mega Jet requires a connection to a television screen and a power source, and so outside of airline flights it is only useful in cars equipped with a television set <b>and</b> <b>cigarette</b> lighter receptacle.|$|E
5|$|The {{first season}} {{introduced}} main {{characters of the}} series, including Fox Mulder and Dana Scully who were portrayed by David Duchovny and Gillian Anderson respectively, and recurring characters Deep Throat, Walter Skinner <b>and</b> <b>Cigarette</b> Smoking Man. The season introduced the series' main concept, revolving around the investigation of paranormal or supernatural cases, known as X-Files, by the Federal Bureau of Investigation; it also began {{to lay the groundwork}} for the series' overarching mythology.|$|E
5|$|By 1943, it {{had about}} 100 employees. The magazine's offices moved to Brighton, Ohio in 1946, then to New York City in 1948. A five-column tabloid format was adopted in November 1950 and coated paper {{was first used}} in Billboards print issues in January 1963, {{allowing}} for photojournalism. Billboard Publications Inc. acquired a monthly trade magazine for candy <b>and</b> <b>cigarette</b> machine vendors called Vend and, in the 1950s, acquired an advertising trade publication called Tide. By 1969, Billboard Publications Inc. owned eleven trade and consumer publications, a publisher called Watson-Guptill Publications, a set of self-study cassette tapes and four television franchises. It also acquired Photo Weekly that year.|$|E

5|$|Because many genes {{belonging}} to HLA remain unidentified, positional cloning (a method {{used to identify}} a specific gene, when only its location on a chromosome is known) {{has been used to}} determine that a mucin-like gene is associated with DPB. In addition, diseases caused by identified HLA genes in the DPB-susceptibility region have been investigated. One of these, bare lymphocyte syndrome I (BLS I), exhibits a number of similarities with DPB in those affected, including chronic sinusitis, bronchiolar inflammation and nodules, and the presence of H.influenzae. Also like DPB, BLS I responds favorably to erythromycin therapy by showing a resolution of symptoms. The similarities between these two diseases, the corresponding success with the same mode of treatment, {{and the fact that the}} gene responsible for BLS I is located within the DPB-causing area of HLA narrows the establishment of a gene responsible for DPB. Environmental factors such as inhaling toxic fumes <b>and</b> <b>cigarette</b> smoking are not believed to play a role in DPB, and unknown environmental and other non-genetic causessuch as unidentified bacteria or viruseshave not been ruled out.|$|E
5|$|The {{film was}} written by Carter and Spotnitz and {{directed}} by series regular Rob Bowman. In addition to Mulder, Scully, Skinner <b>and</b> <b>Cigarette</b> Smoking Man, it featured guest appearances by Martin Landau, Armin Mueller-Stahl and Blythe Danner, who appeared only in the film. It also featured the last appearance of John Neville as the Well-Manicured Man. Jeffrey Spender, Diana Fowley, Alex Krycek and Gibson Praise—characters who had been introduced in the fifth-season finale and/or were integral to the television series—do {{not appear in the}} film. Although the film had a strong domestic opening and received mostly positive reviews from critics, attendance dropped sharply after the first weekend. Although it failed to make a profit during its theatrical release—due in part to its large promotional budget—The X-Files film was more successful internationally. Eventually, the worldwide theatrical box office total reached $189 million. The film's production cost and ad budgets were each close to $66 million. Unlike the series, Anderson and Duchovny received equal pay for the film.|$|E
