After settling on the origin story, Shyamalan wrote the screenplay as a speculative screenplay with Bruce Willis <b>already</b> <b>set</b> to star in the film and Jackson in mind to portray Elijah Price. Filming began in April 2000 and was completed in July.|$|E
5|$|After the International Workingmen's Association disbanded in 1876, several {{attempts}} were made to revive the organisation, culminating {{in the formation of the}} Socialist International (Second International) in 1889. This, in turn, was disbanded in 1916 following disagreements over World War I. Although the organisation reformed in 1923 as the Labour and Socialist International, supporters of the October Revolution and the Bolsheviks had <b>already</b> <b>set</b> up the Communist International (Comintern), which they regarded as the Third International. This was organised on a democratic centralist basis, with component parties required to fight for policies adopted by the body as a whole.|$|E
5|$|By 1906, erosion {{had become}} {{apparent}} {{at the base}} of the tree. George Foster Peabody paid to have new soil, a commemorative tablet, and a chain barricade supported by eight granite posts installed around the tree. Despite these efforts, the tree reportedly suffered heavy damage during an ice storm in 1907. Although attempts were made at preservation, rot had <b>already</b> <b>set</b> in, and the tree was permanently weakened.|$|E

And everything is shot through with an unmistakable refinement, free-spirited earthiness and giddy romanticism".|$|R
5|$|Governor Ford's allies {{encouraged}} Carroll {{to run for}} the U.S. Senate in 1974, but Carroll had <b>already</b> <b>set</b> {{his sights}} on the governorship. Instead, Ford ran for and won the Senate seat, and Carroll succeeded him as governor. In 1975, he sought a full term in office and won the Democratic gubernatorial nomination in a four-way primary against Jefferson County Judge Todd Hollenbach, former state Auditor Mary Louise Foust, and Robert McCreary Johnson.|$|E

5|$|Bacher was {{packaging}} {{the third}} core for shipment to Tinian on August 12 at the Ice House at Los Alamos {{when he received}} word that the Japanese had initiated surrender negotiations. He had <b>already</b> <b>set</b> G Division the task of designing and building new types of cores and assemblies, and he co-authored a report with Robert Wilson urging the development of Edward Teller's Super bomb. He served on a committee chaired by Richard Tolman that looked into declassifying documents produced by the Manhattan Project, and one chaired by Manson Benedict that investigated the technical feasibility of international control of nuclear energy. For his services to the Manhattan Project Bacher was awarded the Medal for Merit on January 12, 1946.|$|E

5|$|Before the 1956 NBA draft, Auerbach had <b>already</b> <b>set</b> {{his sights}} on {{defensive}} rebounding center Bill Russell. Via a draft-day trade that sent Macauley and rookie Cliff Hagan to the rival St. Louis Hawks, he acquired a center in Russell, who {{would go on to}} become one of the greatest basketball players of all time. In the same draft, Auerbach picked up forward Tom Heinsohn and guard K.C. Jones, also two future Hall-of-Famers. Emphasizing team play rather than individual performances, and stressing that defense was more important than offense, Auerbach drilled his players to play tough defense and force opposing turnovers for easy fast-break points. Forward Tom Sanders recalled that the teams were also regularly among the best-conditioned and toughest squads.|$|E
5|$|Diamonds {{prepared}} as gemstones are sold on diamond exchanges called bourses. There are 28 registered diamond bourses in the world. Bourses are the final tightly controlled {{step in the}} diamond supply chain; wholesalers and even retailers are able to buy relatively small lots of diamonds at the bourses, after which they are prepared for final sale to the consumer. Diamonds can be sold <b>already</b> <b>set</b> in jewelry, or sold unset ("loose"). According to the Rio Tinto Group, in 2002 the diamonds produced and released to the market were valued at US$9billion as rough diamonds, US$14billion after being cut and polished, US$28billion in wholesale diamond jewelry, and US$57billion in retail sales.|$|E

Finn, furious, riles up the town, who begin to riot, as they are sick of being abused by the Destiny Gang. Finn goes to the Destiny Gang's mansion to confront their leader, Big Destiny. Once there, Big Destiny returns the crown, noting {{that it is the}} last {{possession}} that he will ever own. Finn looks out the window and sees that the gang is burning the city. Finn races to his home, taking Marceline with him. When he arrives at his house, the gang has <b>already</b> <b>set</b> it on fire with his parents and infant sibling trapped upstairs. Finn asks Marceline if the crown is magic and she tells him it is very dangerous magic. He then puts the crown on his head, and the power begins to flow through him.|$|E

5|$|Once the Confederates {{had crossed}} the river, the Alice Dean was set ablaze and sunk in the river between Morvin's landing and Mauckport to deny the Union pursuers use of the vessel and to block the landing, making their {{crossing}} more difficult. Morgan ordered the McCombs to be burnt, but Col. Duke countermanded the order because of his friendship with its captain. He was allowed to return with his ship to Louisville unharmed. Gen. Hobson and {{the main body of}} the Union cavalry arrived in Brandenburg at about 10:15 pm, just as the Alice Dean went under the water. He set up his artillery and fired several shots at the Confederates who jeered at him from the opposite side of the river; they quickly withdrew out of range of his guns. The lead elements of the cavalry had <b>already</b> <b>set</b> out northward following the Legion forces who withdrew gradually and fought delaying skirmishes along the Mauckport road to slow the cavalry's advance towards Corydon.|$|E
5|$|The script {{remained}} under Columbia's shelf until {{legal issues}} {{forced them to}} withdraw. The studio was set to begin shooting a comedic send-up of Double Indemnity entitled Big Trouble. Columbia's legal department determined that the film's plot was too similar to Double Indemnity and they needed the permission of Universal Pictures, owners of the earlier film, if the film was ever to begin shooting. With Big Trouble <b>already</b> <b>set</b> to go, desperate Columbia executives phoned Universal's Frank Price to get the necessary paperwork. Price was a former Columbia executive who had been quite fond of the script for Back to the Future during his tenure there. As a result, Universal agreed to trade the Double Indemnity license {{in exchange for the}} rights to Back to the Future. Thus, the film finally had a home at Universal.|$|E
5|$|The Treaty of Jassy in January 1792 {{ended the}} Russian {{war with the}} Ottomans, and in April of that year the First Coalition wars began, forcing Prussia to move the bulk of its forces west to deal with revolutionary France. Russia, angered by Poland's attempt {{to move out of}} its influence, invaded Poland in May. Around that time, Prussian policy was <b>already</b> <b>set</b> against Poland; rather than {{discussing}} how to aid it, Frederic Wilhelm and his ministers were discussing how to convince Austria and Prussia to a new partition. Lucchesini has already made several declarations that Prussia cannot aid the Commonwealth, and in June that year, Potocki's mission to Berlin received a confirmation of that, motivated {{on the grounds that the}} Constitution of 3 May changed Polish state so much that Prussia does not consider its obligations binding. Prussian Foreign Minister, Friedrich Wilhelm von Schulenburg-Kehnert, has clearly and with rare candor told Potocki that Prussia did not support the constitution, but could not say so initially, as to not allow any Polish-Russian reconciliation, and now will not even help as a mediator, as it is not in Prussian's interest of the state to see Commonwealth strengthened so that it could threaten Prussia in some future.|$|E
