5|$|After the {{kick-off}} {{there was}} soon a scrum ordered The <b>All</b> Blacks were repeatedly penalised by the referee whenever {{they had a}} scrum. The reason for this was the <b>All</b> Blacks 2–3–2 scrum formation where they had only two front-rowers. The Welsh team used a three-man front row, and had studied the <b>All</b> Blacks scrummaging technique. The Welsh countered the <b>All</b> Blacks 2–3–2 scrum formation by setting their front row after the <b>All</b> Blacks, and hence preventing the <b>All</b> Blacks from gaining the loosehead. Consequently, every time the <b>All</b> Blacks tried to hook the ball they were penalised, and this prompted their captain Gallaher to order his team not to contest the scrums, and to instead let the Welsh win the ball.|$|E

40|$|The ALL- 1 gene is {{directly}} involved in 5 - 10 % of acute lymphoblastic leukemias (<b>ALLs)</b> and acute myeloid leukemias (AMLs) by fusion to other genes or through internal rearrangements. DNA microarrays {{were used to determine}} expression profiles of <b>ALLs</b> and AMLs with ALL- 1 rearrangements. These profiles distinguish those tumors from other <b>ALLs</b> and AMLs. The expression patterns of ALL- 1 -associated tumors, in particular <b>ALLs,</b> involve oncogenes, tumor suppressors, antiapoptotic genes, drug-resistance genes, etc., and correlate with the aggressive nature of the tumors. The genes whose expression differentiates between <b>ALLs</b> with and without ALL- 1 rearrangement were further divided into several groups, enabling separation of ALL- 1 -associated <b>ALLs</b> into two subclasses. One of the groups included 43 genes that exhibited expression profiles closely linked to <b>ALLs</b> with ALL- 1 rearrangements. Further, there were evident differences between the expression profiles of AMLs in which ALL- 1 had undergone fusion to other genes and AMLs with partial duplication of ALL- 1. The extensive analysis described here pinpointed genes that might have a direct role in pathogenesis...|$|R
