5|$|Doxorubicin, {{sold under}} the trade names Adriamycin among others, is a {{chemotherapy}} medication {{used to treat}} cancer. This includes breast cancer, bladder cancer, Kaposi's sarcoma, lymphoma, and acute lymphocytic leukemia. It is often used together with other chemotherapy agents. Doxorubicin is given by injection into <b>a</b> <b>vein.</b>|$|E
5|$|Venous {{insufficiency}} {{results when}} the vein dilates secondary to <b>a</b> <b>vein</b> wall disease or when normal {{functioning of the}} valves, which serve to keep blood flowing to the heart and to prevent reflux, become damaged and/or incompetent (the dilation of <b>a</b> <b>vein</b> will prevent valves to close properly). This incompetence will result in an reversed blood flow through the affected vein or veins. In varicose veins the valves are damaged, disfunction or missing and the insufficiency will be chronic. The reversed blood pools in the low third of legs and feet.|$|E
5|$|Each of {{the wings}} {{consists}} of a thin membrane supported by a system of veins. The membrane is formed by two layers of integument closely apposed, while the veins are formed where the two layers remain separate; sometimes the lower cuticle is thicker and more heavily sclerotized under <b>a</b> <b>vein.</b> Within each of the major veins there is a nerve and a trachea, and, since the cavities of the veins are connected with the hemocoel, hemolymph can flow into the wings.|$|E

5|$|Venous thrombosis, the {{formation}} of a blood clot in <b>a</b> <b>vein,</b> is a common cause of death in breast cancer patients; patients with recurrent disease are typically maintained on anticoagulants for their lifetimes. A research study has suggested that extracts from P.impudicus can reduce the risk of this condition by reducing the incidence of platelet aggregation, and may have potential as a supportive preventative nutrition. It was used in medieval times as a cure for gout and as a love potion.|$|E
5|$|Warfarin, {{sold under}} {{the brand name}} Coumadin among others, is a {{medication}} that is used as an anticoagulant (blood thinner). It is commonly used to treat blood clots such as deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism and to prevent stroke in people who have atrial fibrillation, valvular heart disease or artificial heart valves. Less commonly it is used following ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) and orthopedic surgery. It is generally taken by mouth but may also be used by injection into <b>a</b> <b>vein.</b>|$|E
5|$|Arterial blood gas {{measurement}} is usually performed {{to demonstrate the}} acidosis; this requires taking a blood sample from an artery. Subsequent measurements (to ensure treatment is effective), may be taken from a normal blood test taken from <b>a</b> <b>vein,</b> as there is little difference between the arterial and the venous pH. Ketones {{can be measured in}} the urine (acetoacetate) and blood (β-hydroxybutyrate). When compared with urine acetoacetate testing, capillary blood β-hydroxybutyrate determination can reduce the need of admission, shorten the duration of hospital admission and potentially reduce the costs of hospital care. At very high levels, capillary blood ketone measurement becomes imprecise.|$|E

5|$|Linezolid is an {{antibiotic}} {{used for the}} treatment of infections caused by Gram-positive bacteria that are resistant to other antibiotics. Linezolid is active against most Gram-positive bacteria that cause disease, including streptococci, vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE), and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). The main uses are infections of the skin and pneumonia although it may be used for a variety of other infections including drug resistant tuberculosis. It is used either by injection into <b>a</b> <b>vein</b> or by mouth. Linezolid {{is a member of the}} oxazolidinone class of medications.|$|E
5|$|The {{vascular}} (blood) {{system can}} be impacted by solid tumors. Between 15 and 25 percent of deep vein thrombosis is caused by cancer (often by a tumor compressing <b>a</b> <b>vein),</b> {{and it may be}} the first hint that cancer is present. It causes swelling and pain in the legs, especially the calf, and (rarely) in the arms. The superior vena cava (a large vein carrying circulating, de-oxygenated blood into the heart) may be compressed by a tumor, causing superior vena cava syndrome, which can cause chest wall pain among other symptoms.|$|E
5|$|In 1940, {{he began}} the year with 26 and two against Queensland, and then a 43 against New South Wales. A series of low scores {{followed}} until he hit <b>a</b> <b>vein</b> of strong form beginning in February of that year. He scored 63 against Western Australia on 16 February 1940 in his last match of the 193940 season. He began the following season with 41 in the following match against New South Wales. Hamence then enjoyed great success against Victoria, where he scored 130 and 103 not out in one inter-state match, and then 85 and 62 in the next. Following this, in a match at the Melbourne Cricket Ground between two representative selections {{to raise money for}} the war effort, he played for Don Bradman's XI and scored 73 and 35. He returned to play for South Australia for a match against New South Wales, where he scored 31 and five. He ended the 194041 season with the highest average for a single season he would achieve in his career, 569runs at 63.22, with two hundreds.|$|E

5|$|Most of Thistle's {{residents}} were railroad employees sent {{to live in}} the town, but there were some who had settled before the railroads arrived. The first Europeans were part of the Mormon migration to Utah, and the first of these was the Pace family, who migrated from Nauvoo, Illinois, reaching Thistle in 1848. Fifth-generation descendants of the Pace settlers continued to operate a family-owned cattle ranch until the town was evacuated. Other settlers included Mormons who originally settled elsewhere in Utah but subsequently arrived to homestead fertile ground on Billies Mountain, on the north wall of the canyon. Among them was the mountain's presumed namesake, William Johnson. Homesteading was practiced in Thistle until the early 1900s. Until the arrival of the railroads, the town's economy was based mainly on farming and ranching, although there was also some mining activity in the region, including <b>a</b> <b>vein</b> of asphaltum that was mined between 1892 and 1914.|$|E
5|$|Soon thereafter, Martin leaves Finn and Jake to save {{himself and}} the Lich appears, {{ordering}} Finn to fall. He delivers a monologue, explaining his desire to extinguish all life in the universe. Finn, overcome by the Lich's power, feebly tries to fight back and ends up throwing some of the guardian blood on the Lich, which causes him to grotesquely begin growing flesh. With the Lich disposed of, Finn pursues his father, who is hitching a ride with escaping criminals on a loose piece of the Citadel, still held on by <b>a</b> <b>vein.</b> One of the criminals cuts the vein, but Finn holds on, causing his grass sword to envelope his arm and eventually rip away, severing it. Martin escapes, and Finn and Jake share a somber moment. Jake eventually reveals to Finn that the Lich has now {{been turned into a}} large humanoid baby; the two leave him on the doorstep of Tree Trunks (voiced by Polly Lou Livingston) and Mr. Pig's house.|$|E

25|$|Central IV {{lines have}} their {{catheters}} that are advanced through <b>a</b> <b>vein</b> and empty {{into a large}} central vein (<b>a</b> <b>vein</b> within the torso), usually the superior vena cava, inferior vena cava or even the right atrium of the heart. Because these veins have a larger diameter than peripheral veins and have faster blood flow, central lines are commonly used to administer substances that could irritate the blood vessel lining, such as some chemotherapy drugs and total parenteral nutrition, whose high glucose content can damage blood vessels.|$|E

25|$|Diazepam, first {{marketed as}} Valium, is a {{medication}} of the benzodiazepine family that typically produces a calming effect. It {{is commonly used}} to treat a range of conditions including anxiety, alcohol withdrawal syndrome, benzodiazepine withdrawal syndrome, muscle spasms, seizures, trouble sleeping, and restless legs syndrome. It may {{also be used to}} cause memory loss during certain medical procedures. It can be taken by mouth, inserted into the rectum, injected into muscle, or injected into <b>a</b> <b>vein.</b> When given into <b>a</b> <b>vein,</b> effects begin in one to five minutes and last up to an hour. By mouth, effects may take 40 minutes to begin.|$|E
25|$|Pathological {{anastomosis}} {{results from}} trauma or disease and may involve veins, arteries, or intestines. These are usually {{referred to as}} fistulas. In the cases of veins or arteries, traumatic fistulas usually occur between artery and vein. Traumatic intestinal fistulas usually occur between two loops of intestine (entero-enteric fistula) or intestine and skin (enterocutaneous fistula). Portacaval anastomosis, by contrast, is an anastomosis between <b>a</b> <b>vein</b> of the portal circulation and <b>a</b> <b>vein</b> of the systemic circulation, which allows blood to bypass the liver in patients with portal hypertension, often resulting in hemorrhoids, esophageal varices, or caput medusae.|$|E
