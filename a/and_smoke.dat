40|$|The high {{performance}} liquid chromatography with {{diode array detection}} {{was used for the}} study. The histamine was detected in 14. 6 % and 17. 8 % of the samples of fresh <b>and</b> <b>smoked</b> fish respectively. The highest concentrations of the compound were found in <b>smoked</b> herring <b>and</b> <b>smoked</b> sprat (17. 7 mg/kg and 24. 1 mg/kg respectively). Histamine concentration in fresh <b>and</b> <b>smoked</b> fish did not exceed the allowable limit, indicating that they are safe for consumers...|$|R

5|$|All A3 Pacifics were {{subsequently}} {{fitted with a}} double Kylchap chimney to improve performance and economy. This caused soft exhaust <b>and</b> <b>smoke</b> drift that tended to obscure the driver's forward vision; the remedy {{was found in the}} German-type smoke deflectors fitted from 1960, which somewhat changed the locomotives' appearance.|$|E
5|$|An early {{focus of}} the new {{authority}} was on policing and crime, with {{construction of a new}} borough prison begun in 1842. The Leeds Improvement Act of 1842 gave the council further powers over markets, streets, street lighting, sewerage, building regulations, public cleansing <b>and</b> <b>smoke</b> regulation in the rapidly growing industrial city.|$|E

5|$|Restricted driver {{visibility}} {{due to the}} air-smoothed casing {{and soft}} steam exhaust from the multiple-jet blastpipe. The exhaust problem was never adequately resolved, <b>and</b> <b>smoke</b> continued to beat down onto the casing while moving, obscuring the driver's vision. There was much experimentation in order to resolve this problem, {{with varying degrees of}} success, and photographic evidence shows the many guises of this project.|$|E
5|$|The alert was {{declared}} upon {{the advice of}} the Interstate Sanitation Commission. Members of the commission had been monitoring the smog situation in shifts for three days, nonstop. Thomas R. Glenn Jr., the commission's director and chief engineer, recommended the alert at 11:25a.m. after seeing instruments in New York and New Jersey that showed carbon monoxide greater than 10 ppm (parts-per-million) <b>and</b> <b>smoke</b> greater than 7.5 ppm, both for more than four consecutive hours.|$|E
5|$|The {{theme of}} cities {{continued}} into 1944 when another batch of four, Nos. 6249–6252, was built without streamlining. The cost of these locomotives averaged £11,664 each. A follow-up batch of three locomotives (Nos. 6253–6255) {{was built in}} 1946 and this batch attracted an inflationary average cost of £15,460 each. The problem of hanging smoke was addressed <b>and</b> <b>smoke</b> deflectors were now incorporated into the design.|$|E

5|$|Among the downsides {{to rapid}} {{industrialization}} was pollution. Brick firing produced {{particulate air pollution}} and paint-making created lead dust, while beer and liquor brewing produced grain swill. The worst pollution was coal dust <b>and</b> <b>smoke,</b> for which St. Louis was infamous by the 1890s. The greatest number of complaints to the St. Louis Board of Health were due to industries engaged in rendering, which produced noxious fumes. In spite of this, pollution control was hindered {{by a desire to}} promote growth. One of the few controls began in 1880, in which regulations would be enforced strictly in some areas while little in others, thereby encouraging factories to concentrate in industrial districts.|$|E
5|$|As {{well as a}} fencing and archery enthusiast, Parsons {{was also}} a keen shooter; he often hunted jack rabbits and cotton tails in the desert, and was amused by mock dueling with Forman while on test sites with rifles and shotguns. Upon proposing to his first wife Helen, he gifted her a pistol. Parsons enjoyed playing pranks on his colleagues, often through detonating {{explosives}} such as firecrackers <b>and</b> <b>smoke</b> bombs, and was known to spend {{hours at a time}} in the bathtub playing with toy boats while living at the Parsonage.|$|E
5|$|Imperial Airlines Flight 201/8 was a Lockheed Constellation L-049 four-engine propliner, {{registration}} N2737A (c/n 1976), chartered by the United States Army {{to transport}} new recruits to Columbia, South Carolina, for training. On November 8, 1961, at 21:24 Eastern Time Zone (EST), the aircraft crashed as it attempted {{to land at}} Byrd Field, near Richmond, Virginia. While there were no apparent impact-related injuries, all seventy-four passengers and three crew members {{died as a result}} of carbon monoxide asphyxiation in the ensuing fire <b>and</b> <b>smoke.</b> Two crew members—the captain and flight engineer—survived after escaping the burning wreckage. This was the second deadliest accident in American history for a single civilian aircraft.|$|E

5|$|In Sri Lanka {{the belief}} of Riri Yaka (Blood Demon) can be found. According to mythology, he tore his mother's breast and emerged {{into the human}} world as a demon killing her. The demon is said to give a primary form and eight other manifestations. In most cases {{he is said to}} be a giant who towers over his human victims. In the primary form, his face is blue and splotched with blood. Red rays radiate from his bloodshot eyes. Blood pours from his {{nostrils}} <b>and</b> <b>smoke</b> billows from his ears. His mouth is filled with decomposing human flesh and his breath is foul. His entire body is coloured scarlet with dripping blood. He is closely associated with Mara, the demon king of death.|$|E
5|$|Killed by bushfire, Grevillea juniperina regenerates {{afterwards}} by {{seeds that}} germinate after lying dormant in the soil, stimulated {{by exposure to}} heat <b>and</b> <b>smoke.</b> Plants over 1m (3ft) high produce more seed. Intervals of 10 to 15 years between fires {{are thought to be}} most beneficial for the species' survival, as this allows seed numbers to build up in the soil over time. Grevillea juniperina can also colonise disturbed areas, though overgrowth of Bursaria spinosa can negatively impact its spread.|$|E
5|$|Later in the decade, Portland {{upgraded}} City Hall {{by adding}} fire sprinklers <b>and</b> <b>smoke</b> detectors. In 1973, the sandstone exterior was cleaned and sealed to prevent moisture from eroding the fragile stone. It was {{later learned that}} this process was harmful as the silicon coating sealed the moisture inside the rock. In 1974, City Hall {{was added to the}} National Register of Historic Places. The following year the rooftop penthouse was converted into an employee break room that included an outdoor deck. In 1978, the city constructed a wheelchair ramp to provide access to the handicapped.|$|E

5|$|Mount Tambora has {{remained}} active {{since the end}} of the 1815 eruption sequence. Minor lava domes and flows were extruded on the caldera floor during the 19th and 20th centuries. Sometime between 1850 and 1910, Tambora erupted again but only inside the caldera. Small lava flows and lava dome extrusions were formed. This eruption (VEI-2) created the Doro Api Toi parasitic cone inside the caldera. A very small (VEI-0) and non-explosive eruption occurred in 1967; Another very small eruption was reported in 2011. In August 2011, the alert level for the volcano was raised from level I to level II after increasing activity was reported in the caldera, including earthquakes <b>and</b> <b>smoke</b> emissions.|$|E
5|$|On 16 October, the JNA {{mounted a}} major attack against Borovo Naselje. It made some progress, but became {{bogged down in}} the face of {{determined}} Croatian resistance. On 30 October, the JNA launched a fully coordinated assault, spearheaded by paramilitary forces, with infantry and engineering troops systematically forcing their way past the Croatian lines. The JNA's forces, divided into northern and southern operations sectors, attacked several points simultaneously and pushed the Croatians back. The JNA also adopted new tactics, such as firing directly into houses and then driving tanks through them, as well as using tear gas <b>and</b> <b>smoke</b> bombs to drive out those inside. Buildings were also captured with the use of anti-tank and anti-aircraft guns.|$|E
5|$|On August 25, one the Cochinos 4,000-pound {{batteries}} caught fire, emitting {{hydrogen gas}} <b>and</b> <b>smoke.</b> Unable to receive {{any help from}} the Tusk, Commander Benitez directed the firefighting. He ordered the Cochino to surface and had the crew members lash themselves to the deck rails with ropes while others fought the blaze. Benitez tried to save his ship {{and at the same}} time save his men from the toxic gases. He realized that the winds were about to tear the ropes and ordered his men to form a pyramid on the ship's open bridge, which was designed to hold seven men.|$|E
