Most phobias typically fall in either one category or the other but scopophobia can be placed in both.

With scopophobia, {{it is likely that the}} person was subjected to public ridicule as a child. Additionally, a person suffering from scopophobia may often be the subject to public staring, possibly due to a deformity or physical ailment.|$|E

To this end, a basic model of the retina is considered, namely a regular sampler subjected to space and time fluctuations that model the random sampling and the eye-tremor respectively. The filtering that can be done by the photoreceptor is also taken into account and the study focuses on a stochastic model of a natural scene. To quantify the effect of the noise, a correlation coefficient between the signal acquired by a given photoreceptor and a given point of the scene the eye is looking <b>at</b> <b>is</b> <b>considered.</b> It is shown both on academic examples and a more realistic case that the fluctuations which affect the retina can induce noise-enhanced processing effects.

The novel isolate was Gram-staining-positive, aerobic, catalase-negative and oxidase-positive. Optimum growth occurred at 50 - 55 degrees C, 7 - 10 % (w/v) NaCl and pH 7 - 8. The strain exhibited 95. 4, 95. 4 and 95. 2 % 16 S rRNA gene sequence similarity to Thalassobacillus devorans G 19. 1 (T), Sediminibacillus halophilus EN 8 d(T) and Virgibacillus kekensis YIM-kknyl 6 (T), respectively. The major menaquinone was MK- 7. The polar lipid profile consisted of phosphatidylglycerol, diphosphatidylglycerol, three unknown phosphoglycolipids and two unknown phospholipids. The predominant cellular fatty acids were iso-C- 15 : 0 and iso-C- 17 : 0. The DNA G+C content was 41. 9 molok.

40|$|Different {{variables}} can be {{used for}} the identification and monitoring of aerobic capacity in collective sports, with the anaerobic threshold (AT) being commonly used in long-duration team sports such as soccer, basketball, and handball. The aim {{of this study was to}} determine AT intensity in different categories of soccer players by evaluating running speed, heart rate (HR) and percent maximum HR (%HRmax), and to compare these intensities between three soccer categories. Nineteen U- 17, 12 U- 20 and 14 professional players volunteered for this study. The AT was defined as the exercise intensity at which blood lactate reaches a concentration of 4 mM (OBLA). AT was determined in a field test consisting of two to five 1000 -m runs at constant speed. HR and blood lactate concentration recorded during the test were analyzed bylinear interpolation. The running speed, HR and %HRmax at OBLA were determined. HRmax was higher in U- 17 players (202 ± 7 bpm) than in professional players (193 ± 10 bpm) (p< 0. 05). AT expressed as %HRmax was lower in the U- 17 (87. 0 ± 1. 1) and U- 20 (86. 3 ± 0. 8) categories when compared to the professional category (91. 2 ± 1. 1) (p< 0. 05). Mean AT was 87 % HRmax. No differences between categories were observed when AT was expressed as absolute HR values (bpm) or running speed. The intensity of <b>AT</b> <b>is</b> <b>considered</b> to be high in this group, with professional players presenting a higher AT than U- 17 and U- 20 players...|$|E

40|$|The {{activity}} theory (AT) {{has been used}} comprehensively in academic studies in the past with var-ying results depending on many factors. In this paper, <b>AT</b> <b>is</b> <b>considered</b> a lens for addressing elec-tronic collaboration (e-collaboration) for academic and research institutions (ARIs). The focus {{of this paper is}} on the advancement of theory for future improved use towards creating a sound and improved guide for future research. The path towards innovation is paved and founded through well-defined theoretical guidelines followed by researchers, participants, and organizations. Underpinning theories continue to be used in academia to provide a solid basis and to afford a good foundation for research work. This enables research work to be reliable for the targeted output, participants, and communities. At times these theories present improvement opportunities for future practical applications and im-plementations. The Living Labs (LLs) present platforms for knowledge development; thereby their relationship with ARIs is inevitable. Together they facilitate improvement and innovation for ARIs. The literature context is the foundation of this paper together with the empirical data collected through multiple sources such as questionnaires, interviews, and the researchers ’ reflective jour-nal (RRJ). The study used snowball and purposive sampling. The study primarily used the Grounded Theory Method (GTM) approach with the subsequent data collection influencing the collection process. This main objective {{of this paper is to}} propose an activity system model for ARIs. The proposed activity system model presented positive results when applied as the main study progressed. Further advancements can still be applied to the model thereby making it adaptable different environments...|$|E
40|$|Background : In humans, {{adipose tissue}} (AT) {{originating}} from different depots shows varying gene expression profiles. In horses, {{the risk of}} certain metabolic disorders may also {{be influenced by the}} impact of specific AT depots. Macrophage infiltration in human and rat <b>AT</b> <b>is</b> <b>considered</b> {{to be a source of}} inflammatory changes. In horses, this relationship has not been extensively studied yet. Reverse transcription quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR), a useful method to evaluate differences in mRNA expression across different tissues, can be used to evaluate differences between equine AT depots. For a correct interpretation of the RT-qPCR results, expression data have to be normalized by the use of validated reference genes. The main objectives of this study were to compare mRNA expression of inflammation-related genes, as well as adipocyte morphology and number between different equine AT depots; and in addition, to investigate the presence of antigen presenting cells in equine AT and any potential relationship with adipokine mRNA expression. Results : In this study, the mRNA expression of inflammation-related genes (leptin, chemokine ligand 5, interleukin 1 β, interleukin 6, interleukin 10, adiponectin, matrix metalloproteinase 2, and superoxide dismutase 2) and candidate reference gene stability was investigated in 8 different AT depots collected from the nuchal, abdominal (mesenteric, retroperitoneal, and peri-renal) and subcutaneous (tail head and loin) AT region. By using GeNorm analysis, HPRT 1, RPL 32, and GAPDH were found to be the most stable genes in equine AT. The mRNA expression of leptin, chemokine ligand 5, interleukin 10, interleukin 1 β, adiponectin, and matrix metalloproteinase 2 significantly differed across AT depots (P 0. 05). Adipocyte area and number of antigen presenting cells per adipocyte significantly differed between AT depots (P < 0. 05). Conclusions : Adipose tissue location was associated with differences in mRNA expression of inflammation-related genes. This depot-specific difference in mRNA expression suggests that the overall inflammatory status of horses could be partially determined by the relative proportion of the different AT depots...|$|E
