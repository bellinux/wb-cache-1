50|$|Roman <b>Key</b> <b>Card</b> Blackwood (RKCB) {{has largely}} {{replaced}} the standard version among tournament players. It {{developed from the}} Roman Blackwood variant (see below). According to RKCB there are five equivalent <b>key</b> <b>cards</b> rather than just the four aces: the trump king is counted as the 5th <b>key</b> <b>card.</b> The <b>key</b> <b>card</b> replies to 4NT are more compressed than standard ones and they also begin to locate the queen of trumps.|$|R
50|$|Computerized {{authentication}} systems, such as <b>key</b> <b>cards,</b> raise privacy concerns, {{since they}} enable computer surveillance of each entry. RFID <b>cards</b> and <b>key</b> fobs {{are becoming increasingly}} popular due to their ease of use. Many modern households have installed digital locks that make use of <b>key</b> <b>cards,</b> in combination with biometric fingerprint and keypad PIN options. Offices have also slowly installed digital locks that integrate with <b>key</b> <b>cards</b> and biometric technology.|$|R
50|$|In {{the modern}} more {{commonly}} used form, known as Roman <b>Key</b> <b>Card</b> Blackwood (RKCB), the 4NT bid is used to ask partner {{about the number of}} <b>key</b> <b>cards</b> held where the five <b>key</b> <b>cards</b> are the four aces and the king of trumps. Responses are stepwise: 5 for 0 or 3 <b>key</b> <b>cards,</b> 5 for 1 or 4, 5 for 2 without the trump queen, 5 for 2 with the trump queen. Some prefer to reverse the meaning of the first two responses and the variants are referred to in abbreviation as RKCB 3014 and RKCB 1430 respectively. Various methods are used to continue with king-asking bids.|$|R
50|$|Server {{licensing}} {{on early}} versions of NetWare 286 {{was accomplished by}} using a <b>key</b> <b>card.</b> The <b>key</b> <b>card</b> was designed for an 8-bit ISA bus, and had a serial number encoded on a ROM chip. The serial number had to match the serial number of the NetWare software running on the server. To broaden the hardware base, particularly to machines using the IBM MCA bus, later versions of NetWare 2.x did not require the key card; serialised license floppy disks were used {{in place of the}} <b>key</b> <b>cards.</b>|$|R

50|$|Roman <b>Key</b> <b>Card</b> Blackwood is {{predicated}} on existence of a trump suit, which determines which of the four kings and queens responder should show as <b>key</b> <b>cards.</b> Trump agreement is not necessary, however. One common rule is that the last suit bid before 4NT bid is the key suit, lacking trump agreement.|$|R

5000|$|Two {{versions}} of Blackwood are common: [...] "standard" [...] Blackwood, developed by Easley in 1933, and [...] "Roman Key Card" [...] Blackwood (RKC or RKCB), {{named for the}} Italian team which invented it. Standard Blackwood enables one partner to count partnership aces and kings in general. <b>Key</b> <b>card</b> variants are defined by a particular [...] "key" [...] suit and enable counting the trump king and queen, as well as aces and kings. Both versions are initiated by a bid of four notrump (4NT), and the entire family of conventions may be called Blackwood 4NT in both versions, or <b>Key</b> <b>Card</b> 4NT in the <b>key</b> <b>card</b> variation.|$|R

5000|$|The {{electronic}} organizer may instead {{announce that}} the new room is locked, and thus ask if the player has a <b>key</b> <b>card.</b> If the player does have one, (s)he can select [...] "Yes" [...] and move into the new room. If not, (s)he cannot enter. As soon as one player has unlocked a locked room with the <b>key</b> <b>card,</b> the furniture is put in and the room remains unlocked {{for the remainder of}} the game.|$|R

50|$|He found that, {{though the}} <b>key</b> <b>cards</b> are hung on their pegs in a {{different}} order for each run (each twenty-five trials), it is certainly possible for E to guess the new positions {{of one or two}} of them. When the screen is laid on its side after a run, E notes that the <b>key</b> <b>card</b> in Position 1 (the right- or left-hand end) is, say, a cross. The screen is then set up for the next run. S or O then removes the <b>key</b> <b>cards</b> from their pegs and replaces them {{in a different}} order. But E can see from his movements in what order he removes them (left to right or right to left). Then, unless the <b>key</b> <b>cards</b> are shuffled before replacing them, E can guess that the first or last card replaced will be a cross. E then completes the run as usual, and begins his tally. At this point, neither S or O can see what he's doing. It's easy enough for him to slip a card or two (bearing a cross) into the 'cross' pile without being detected.|$|R

Another purpose is to overcome stereotypic attitudes about the equitable participation of women in the workplace. The curriculum is organized into five modules of one or two lessons each for a total of eight lessons. Each module is presented with a summary, suggested approach, goals, instructional objectives, and a conceptual overview. Detailed lesson plans for each day contain a summary of activities, implementation guidelines by classroom activity (including purpose, process, and procedure), and a summary of materials needed.

After rescuing five hostages, the player's rank will increase by one star (with the maximum rank being four stars), allowing for increased carrying capacity and maximum health. However, if a hostage is killed, the player is demoted to the previous rank.|$|R

50|$|The {{experimenter}} cut an ESP pack of cards, {{keeping them}} face down. The subject would then guess the top card by pointing at a blank. If the guess was a cross then the subject would {{point at the}} blank below the <b>key</b> <b>card</b> resembling a cross. The experimenter would then take the ESP card and place it opposite the blank indicated. When the pack had been completed the experimenter had five cards before him. The experimenter would then turn over each pile and record how many cards of each symbol it contained. An observer (O) was placed behind the subject. The observer then recorded {{the positions of the}} <b>key</b> <b>cards</b> on their pegs. The experimenter could not see this record. The experimenter and the observer would then store their records and lock them away. The three persons present would then would check the positions of the <b>key</b> <b>cards</b> and the number of hits on each pile. In total 32 subjects tested the experiment with the total score for 60, 000 trials being 12, 489 hits.|$|R
