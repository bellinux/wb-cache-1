50|$|Inspection {{flashlights}} have permanently mounted light guides containing {{optical fibers}} or plastic rods. Another style has a lamp mounted {{at the end}} of a flexible cable, or a semi-rigid or <b>articulated</b> <b>probe.</b> Such lamps are used for inspection inside tanks, or inside structures such as aircraft. Where used for inspecting the interior of tanks containing flammable liquids, the inspection lights may also be rated as flame-proof (explosion-proof) so that they cannot ignite liquids or vapors.|$|E
40|$|Toxic {{materials}} in DOE sites pose a significant threat to DOE personnel who must inspect these locations. Working in confined spaces further complicates the situation {{especially when the}} workers must wear heavy and cumbersome protective suits. A robot or conventional mechanism can clearly bypass the danger and perhaps expedite the characterization process because the person {{is removed from the}} site and neither the site nor the person require preparation. However, conventional robots are not suitable for these inspection tasks because they are not flexible enough to pass through and into target DOE inspection sites. This effort is developing an <b>articulated</b> <b>probe,</b> called a hyper redundant mechanism, which is a snake-like device that can exploit its many internal degrees of freedom to thread through tightly packed volumes transmitting images and data from remote locations inaccessible to conventional robots and people. This effort contains two parts: mechanism development and control of the device...|$|E
40|$|One of {{the factors}} {{affecting}} the accuracy of Coordinate Measuring Systems is hysteresis of a probe head. It is important especially in case of touch trigger probes and {{should be taken into}} account during the determination of probing strategy. In this article, the authors try to assess how this phenomenon affects the accuracy of five axis coordinate systems which utilize <b>articulating</b> <b>probe</b> head. Such systems allow to measure point coordinates using rotary movements of the head what introduces changes to the probing process. The experiments presented in this paper are based on multiple measurements of the reference elements such as gauge blocks and standard ring...|$|R
40|$|Uncertainty {{evaluation}} software based on Monte Carlo simulations is very useful for coordinate measurement machines (CMMs). These Monte Carlo methods use so-called virtual CMMs to simulate CMM measurement errors. Based on the simulated errors measurement uncertainties can be determined. This paper shows how CMM hardware errors can be modelled {{in a simple}} and straightforward way. It considers CMM geometric errors as well as <b>probe</b> and <b>articulating</b> <b>probe</b> head errors. A key element of the presented method is the selection of representative virtual CMMs based on a virtual ISO 10360 - 2 acceptance test. The method has been implemented in own developed uncertainty {{evaluation software}} but {{can also be used}} in other software. Results show that very reliable uncertainty statements are obtained with this method. status: submitte...|$|R

40|$|Abstract- In {{order to}} {{overcome}} the limitations of currently available assistive technologies for minimally invasive surgery (MIS), we have developed a novel highly <b>articulated</b> robotic <b>probe</b> (HARP) that can exploit its snake-like structure to navigate in a confined anatomical environment while minimally interacting with the environment along its path. We believe that for procedures involving epicardial interventions on the beating heart, cardiac MIS can be effectively realized with the HARP, entering the pericardial cavity through a subxiphoid port, reaching remote intrapericardial locations on the epicardium without causing hemodynamic and electrophysiologic interference and delivering therapeutic interventions under the direct control of the surgeon...|$|R
40|$|This article {{examines}} two novels written {{by members of}} the Oulipo group, exploring the ways in which Georges Perec's La Disparition (1969) and Anne F. Garréta's La Décomposition (1999) both use Oulipian constraints within a narrative infrastructure drawn from subgenres of crime fiction: La Disparition is a whodunnit, and La Décomposition a first-person noir narrative. I argue that Perec and Garréta use the alliance of constraint and crime fiction in order to <b>articulate</b> a <b>probing</b> account of their protagonists’ impossible quests for metaphysical certainty in the face of death and loss. The genre-constraint alliance is also the means by which Perec and Garréta express their dissatisfaction with aspects of contemporary literary culture and reception. The {{article examines}} why the tropes of crime fiction are of particular use to these Oulipian authors in their investigation of the purposes and potential of literature...|$|R
40|$|Objective: Minimally {{invasive}} epicardial atrial ablation to cure {{atrial fibrillation}} {{through the use}} of a percutaneous subxiphoid approach currently has a lack of dedicated technology for intraperi-cardial navigation around the beating heart. We have developed a novel <b>articulated</b> robotic medical <b>probe</b> and performed preliminary experiments in a porcine preparation. Methods: In five large, healthy pigs, the teleoperated robotic system was introduced inside the pericardial space through a percutaneous subxiphoid approach. Secondary visualization of the left atrium and left atrial appendage was achieved with the use of a 5 -mm scope inserted through a left thoracic port. The operator actively controlled the path of the robot by using a master manipulator. The catheter, with an irrigated radiofrequency tip, was guided through the work-ing port of the robot to achieve epicardial ablation of the left atrium. Results: Access to the pericardial space and progression around the left atrium was successful in all cases, with no interference with the beating heart such as a fatal arrhythmia, unexpected bleeding, and hypotension. Epicardial ablation was successfully performed in all five cases. No adverse hemodynamic or electrophysiological events were noted during the trials. When the animals were killed, there was no visually detected injury on the surrounding mediastinal structures caused by ablation. Transmural ablation was confirmed by histopathology of the left atrium. Conclusions: We have developed a dedicated <b>articulated</b> robotic medical <b>probe</b> and successfully performed epicardial left atrial radiofrequency ablation. Based on the feedback from these prelim-inary experiments, the radius of curvature and proper visualization of the device are being improved in the next generation prototype...|$|R
30|$|After <b>articulating</b> the {{ultrasound}} <b>probe,</b> the investigators used the graphical overlay to simulate various ablation widths, angles, and {{locations of the}} intended ablation. In this fashion, before introducing the RF electrodes into a fibroid, the investigator planned and optimized the ablation. Once the size, angle, and location of the ablation were established, the investigator advanced a trocar-tipped introducer into the fibroid under intrauterine ultrasound visualization. The investigator aligned the graphical overlay with the introducer tip and then rotated the VizAblate Handpiece about the introducer to assess {{the position of the}} Ablation Zone and Thermal Safety Border relative to the uterine serosa, as displayed on the graphical user interface, adjusting the size and/or position of the desired ablation if necessary. Depending on the width of the ablation, the distance from the Ablation Zone to the uterine serosal margin will vary from 6.0 to 9.5  mm. When properly positioned, the introducer is located within the fibroid while the serosa is maintained tangent to or beyond the Thermal Safety Border. The investigator then deployed the electrodes, again rotating to ascertain the position of the Thermal Safety Border relative to the serosa. Once the Thermal Safety Border was confirmed to be within the uterine serosal margin in all adjacent ultrasound planes, RF energy was used to accomplish the ablation. Treated fibroids each received one or more ellipsoidal ablations, ranging from 1 to 4  cm in width and 2 – 5  cm in length. The number of ablations, along with their sizes, was at the discretion of the investigator. While usually only one ablation may sufficiently ablate up to a 5 -cm myoma, two smaller ablations might be needed rather than one larger one, in order to ablate a greater aggregate volume when a fibroid is close to the serosa or where there is additional constraint on ablation volume and position (e.g., the cornu).|$|R
