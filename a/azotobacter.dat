5|$|<b>Azotobacter</b> {{produces}} pigments. For example, <b>Azotobacter</b> chroococcum forms a dark-brown water-soluble pigment melanin. This process {{occurs at}} high levels of metabolism during the fixation of nitrogen, and is thought to protect the nitrogenase system from oxygen. Other <b>Azotobacter</b> species produce pigments from yellow-green to purple colors, including a green pigment which fluoresces with a yellow-green light and a pigment with blue-white fluorescence.|$|E
5|$|<b>Azotobacter</b> respires aerobically, {{receiving}} {{energy from}} redox reactions, using organic compounds as electron donors. <b>Azotobacter</b> {{can use a}} variety of carbohydrates, alcohols, and salts of organic acids as sources of carbon.|$|E
5|$|<b>Azotobacter</b> {{species are}} free-living, nitrogen-fixing bacteria; in {{contrast}} to Rhizobium species, they normally fix molecular nitrogen from the atmosphere without symbiotic relations with plants, although some <b>Azotobacter</b> species are associated with plants. Nitrogen fixation is inhibited {{in the presence of}} available nitrogen sources, such as ammonium ions and nitrates.|$|E
5|$|<b>Azotobacter</b> {{species are}} {{ubiquitous}} in neutral and weakly basic soils, but not acidic soils. They {{are also found}} in the Arctic and Antarctic soils, despite the cold climate, short growing season, and relatively low pH values of these soils. In dry soils, <b>Azotobacter</b> can survive in the form of cysts for up to 24 years.|$|E
5|$|The <b>Azotobacter</b> genus was {{discovered}} in 1901 by Dutch microbiologist and botanist Martinus Beijerinck, {{who was one of}} the founders of environmental microbiology. He selected and described the species <b>Azotobacter</b> chroococcum – the first aerobic, free-living nitrogen fixer.|$|E
5|$|<b>Azotobacter</b> is a genus of usually motile, oval or spherical {{bacteria}} that form thick-walled cysts and may produce {{large quantities of}} capsular slime. They are aerobic, free-living soil microbes which {{play an important role}} in the nitrogen cycle in nature, binding atmospheric nitrogen, which is inaccessible to plants, and releasing it in the form of ammonium ions into the soil (nitrogen fixation). In addition to being a model organism for studying diazotrophs, it is used by humans for the production of biofertilizers, food additives, and some biopolymers. The first representative of the genus, <b>Azotobacter</b> chroococcum, was discovered and described in 1901 by the Dutch microbiologist and botanist Martinus Beijerinck. <b>Azotobacter</b> species are Gram-negative bacteria found in neutral and alkaline soils, in water, and in association with some plants.|$|E
5|$|Nitrogen {{fixation}} {{plays an}} important role in the nitrogen cycle. <b>Azotobacter</b> also synthesizes some biologically active substances, including some phytohormones such as auxins, thereby stimulating plant growth. They also facilitate the mobility of heavy metals in the soil, thus enhancing bioremediation of soil from heavy metals, such as cadmium, mercury and lead. Some kinds of <b>Azotobacter</b> can also biodegrade chlorine-containing aromatic compounds, such as 2,4,6-trichlorophenol, which was previously used as an insecticide, fungicide, and herbicide, but later was found to have mutagenic and carcinogenic effects.|$|E
5|$|A {{vanadium}} nitrogenase {{is used by}} some nitrogen-fixing micro-organisms, such as <b>Azotobacter.</b> In this role, vanadium replaces {{more common}} molybdenum or iron, and gives the nitrogenase slightly different properties.|$|E
5|$|<b>Azotobacter</b> can fix {{at least}} 10 μg of {{nitrogen}} per gram of glucose consumed. Nitrogen fixation requires molybdenum ions, {{but they can}} be partially or completely replaced by vanadium ions. If atmospheric nitrogen is not fixed, the source of nitrogen can alternatively be nitrates, ammonium ions, or amino acids. The optimal pH for the growth and nitrogen fixation is 7.0–7.5, but growth is sustained in the pH range from 4.8 to 8.5. <b>Azotobacter</b> can also grow mixotrophically, in a molecular-nitrogen-free medium containing mannose; this growth mode is hydrogen-dependent. Hydrogen is available in the soil, thus this growth mode may occur in nature.|$|E
5|$|Bacteria of {{the genus}} <b>Azotobacter</b> are also known to form {{intracellular}} inclusions of polyhydroxyalkanoates under certain environmental conditions (e.g. lack of elements such as phosphorus, nitrogen, or oxygen combined with an excessive supply of carbon sources).|$|E
5|$|Cysts of {{the genus}} <b>Azotobacter</b> are more {{resistant}} to adverse environmental factors than the vegetative cells; in particular, they are twice as resistant to UV light. They are also resistant to drying, ultrasound and gamma and solar irradiation, but not to heating.|$|E
5|$|The {{nucleotide}} sequence of chromosomes of <b>Azotobacter</b> vinelandii, strain AvOP, is partially determined. This chromosome is a circular DNA molecule which contains 5,342,073 nucleotide pairs and 5,043 genes, of which 4,988 encode proteins. The fraction of guanine + cytosine pairs is 65 mole percent. The number of chromosomes in the cells and the DNA content increases upon aging, {{and in the}} stationary growth phase, cultures may contain more than 100 copies of a chromosome per cell. The original DNA content (one copy) is restored when replanting the culture into a fresh medium. In addition to chromosomal DNA, <b>Azotobacter</b> can contain plasmids.|$|E
5|$|Owing {{to their}} ability to fix {{molecular}} nitrogen and therefore increase the soil fertility and stimulate plant growth, <b>Azotobacter</b> species are widely used in agriculture, particularly in nitrogen biofertilizers such as azotobacterin. They are also used in production of alginic acid, which is applied in medicine as an antacid, in the food industry as an additive to ice cream, puddings, and creams.|$|E
5|$|Representatives of {{the genus}} <b>Azotobacter</b> are also found in aquatic habitats, {{including}} freshwater and brackish marshes. Several members are associated with plants and {{are found in the}} rhizosphere, having certain relationships with the plant. Some strains are also found in the cocoons of the earthworm Eisenia fetida.|$|E
5|$|While growing, <b>Azotobacter</b> {{produces}} flat, slimy, paste-like colonies with {{a diameter}} of 5–10mm, which may form films in liquid nutrient media. The colonies can be dark-brown, green, or other colors, or may be colorless, depending on the species. The growth is favored at a temperature of 20–30°C.|$|E
5|$|Earlier, {{representatives of}} the genus were {{assigned}} to the family Azotobacteraceae Pribram, 1933, but then were transferred to the family Pseudomonadaceae based on the studies of nucleotide sequences 16S rRNA. In 2004, a phylogenetic study revealed that A. vinelandii belongs to the same clade as the bacterium Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and in 2007 it was suggested that the genera <b>Azotobacter,</b> Azomonas and Pseudomonas are related and might be synonyms.|$|E
5|$|Cells of {{the genus}} <b>Azotobacter</b> are {{relatively}} large for bacteria (1–2 μm in diameter). They are usually oval, but may take various forms from rods to spheres. In microscopic preparations, the cells can be dispersed or form irregular clusters or occasionally chains of varying lengths. In fresh cultures, cells are mobile due to the numerous flagella. Later, the cells lose their mobility, become almost spherical, and produce {{a thick layer of}} mucus, forming the cell capsule. The shape of the cell is affected by the amino acid glycine which is present in the nutrient medium peptone.|$|E
5|$|The cysts of <b>Azotobacter</b> are spherical and {{consist of}} the {{so-called}} 'central body' – a reduced copy of vegetative cells with several vacuoles – and the 'two-layer shell'. The inner part of the shell is called intine and has a fibrous structure. The outer part has a hexagonal crystalline structure and is called exine. Exine is partially hydrolyzed by trypsin and is resistant to lysozyme, {{in contrast to the}} central body. The central body can be isolated in a viable state by some chelation agents. The main constituents of the outer shell are alkylresorcinols composed of long aliphatic chains and aromatic rings. Alkylresorcinols are also found in other bacteria, animals, and plants.|$|E
25|$|Other organisms require {{additional}} metals as enzyme cofactors, such as vanadium in the nitrogenase of the nitrogen-fixing bacteria {{of the genus}} <b>Azotobacter,</b> tungsten in the aldehyde ferredoxin oxidoreductase of the thermophilic archaean Pyrococcus furiosus, and even cadmium in the carbonic anhydrase from the marine diatom Thalassiosira weissflogii.|$|E
25|$|In the gammaproteobacterial order Pseudomonadales, {{the genus}} <b>Azotobacter</b> and the species Azomonas macrocytogenes are {{actually}} {{members of the}} genus Pseudomonas, but were misclassified due to nitrogen fixing capabilities and the large size of the genus Pseudomonas which renders classification problematic. This will probably rectified in the close future.|$|E
25|$|Bacteria {{that produce}} {{cellulose}} include Gram-negative bacteria {{species such as}} Acetobacter, <b>Azotobacter,</b> Rhizobium, Pseudomonas, Salmonella, Alcaligenes, and Gram-positive bacteria species such as Sarcina ventriculi. The most effective producers of cellulose are A. xylinum, A. hansenii, and A. pasteurianus. Of these, A. xylinum is the model microorganism for basic and applied studies on cellulose due to its ability to produce relatively high levels of polymer {{from a wide range}} of carbon and nitrogen sources.|$|E
500|$|In 1909, Lipman {{described}} <b>Azotobacter</b> vinelandii, and a {{year later}} , which he named in honor of Beijerinck. In 1949, Russian microbiologist Nikolai Krasilnikov identified the species of [...] which was divided in 1981 by Thompson Skerman into two subspecies - <b>Azotobacter</b> nigricans subsp. nigricans and <b>Azotobacter</b> nigricans subsp. achromogenes; in the same year, Thompson and Skerman described [...] In 1991, Page and Shivprasad reported a microaerophilic and air-tolerant type [...] which was dependent on sodium ions.|$|E
500|$|<b>Azotobacter</b> {{species have}} {{a full range of}} enzymes needed to perform the {{nitrogen}} fixation: ferredoxin, hydrogenase, and an important enzyme nitrogenase. The process of nitrogen fixation requires an influx of energy in the form of adenosine triphosphate. Nitrogen fixation is highly sensitive to the presence of oxygen, so <b>Azotobacter</b> developed a special defensive mechanism against oxygen, namely a significant intensification of metabolism that reduces the concentration of oxygen in the cells. Also, a special nitrogenase-protective protein [...] protects nitrogenase and is involved in protecting the cells from oxygen. Mutants not producing this protein are killed by oxygen during nitrogen fixation {{in the absence of a}} nitrogen source in the medium. Homocitrate ions play a certain role in the processes of nitrogen fixation by <b>Azotobacter.</b> position in MoFe-protein of <b>Azotobacter</b> vinelandii ...|$|E
500|$|A cyst of {{the genus}} <b>Azotobacter</b> is the resting form of a {{vegetative}} cell; however, whereas usual vegetative cells are reproductive, the cyst of <b>Azotobacter</b> does not serve this purpose and is necessary for surviving adverse environmental factors. Following the resumption of optimal environmental conditions, which include a certain value of pH, temperature, and source of carbon, the cysts germinate, and the newly formed vegetative cells multiply by a simple division. During the germination, the cysts sustain damage and release a large vegetative cell. Microscopically, the first manifestation of spore germination is the gradual decrease in light refractive by cysts, which is detected with phase contrast microscopy. Germination of cysts, a slow process, takes about 4–6 h. During germination, the central body grows and captures the granules of volutin, which were located in the intima (the innermost layer). Then the exine bursts and the vegetative cell is freed from the exine, which has a characteristic horseshoe shape. This process is accompanied by metabolic changes. Immediately after being supplied with a carbon source, the cysts begin to absorb oxygen and emit carbon dioxide; the rate of this process gradually increases and saturates after four hours. The synthesis of proteins and RNA, [...] occurs in parallel, but it intensifies only after five hours after {{the addition of the}} carbon source. The synthesis of DNA and nitrogen fixation are initiated 5 h after the addition of glucose to a nitrogen-free nutrient medium.|$|E
500|$|Nitrogenase is {{the most}} {{important}} enzyme involved in nitrogen fixation. <b>Azotobacter</b> species have several types of nitrogenase. The basic one is molybdenum-iron nitrogenase. An alternative type contains vanadium; it is independent of molybdenum ions and is more active than the Mo-Fe nitrogenase at low temperatures. So it can fix nitrogen at temperatures as low as 5°C, and its low-temperature activity is 10 times higher than that of Mo-Fe nitrogenase. An important role in maturation of Mo-Fe nitrogenase plays the so-called P-cluster. Synthesis of nitrogenase is controlled by the nif genes. Nitrogen fixation is regulated by the enhancer protein NifA and the [...] "sensor" [...] flavoprotein NifL which modulates the activation of gene transcription of nitrogen fixation by redox-dependent switching. This regulatory mechanism, relying on two proteins forming complexes with each other, is uncommon for other systems.|$|E
2500|$|Species {{from the}} {{following}} genera are known to synthesize B12: Acetobacterium, Aerobacter, Agrobacterium, Alcaligenes, <b>Azotobacter,</b> Bacillus, Clostridium, Corynebacterium, Flavobacterium, Lactobacillus, Micromonospora, Mycobacterium, Nocardia, ...|$|E
2500|$|<b>Azotobacter</b> vinelandii {{can contain}} up to 80 {{chromosome}} copies per cell. [...] However {{this is only}} observed in fast growing cultures, whereas cultures grown in synthetic minimal media are not polyploid.|$|E
2500|$|The Fe2S2 {{ferredoxin}} from Clostridium pasteurianum (Cp2FeFd) {{has been}} recognized as distinct protein family {{on the basis of}} its amino acid sequence, spectroscopic properties of its iron-sulfur cluster and the unique ligand swapping ability of two cysteine ligands to the [...] cluster. Although the physiological role of this ferredoxin remains unclear, a strong and specific interaction of Cp2FeFd with the molybdenum-iron protein of nitrogenase has been revealed. Homologous ferredoxins from <b>Azotobacter</b> vinelandii (Av2FeFdI) and Aquifex aeolicus (AaFd) have been characterized. The crystal structure of AaFd has been solved. AaFd exists as a dimer. The structure of AaFd monomer is different from other Fe2S2 ferredoxins. The fold belongs to the α+β class, with first four β-strands and two α-helices adopting a variant of the thioredoxin fold.|$|E
2500|$|Atmospheric {{nitrogen}} must be processed, or [...] "fixed", in a usable form to {{be taken}} up by plants. Between 5x1012 and 10x1012 g per year are fixed by lightning strikes, but most fixation is done by free-living or symbiotic bacteria known as diazotrophs. These bacteria have the nitrogenase enzyme that combines gaseous nitrogen with hydrogen to produce ammonia, which is converted by the bacteria into other organic compounds. Most biological nitrogen fixation occurs by the activity of Mo-nitrogenase, found {{in a wide variety}} of bacteria and some Archaea. Mo-nitrogenase is a complex two-component enzyme that has multiple metal-containing prosthetic groups. An example of the free-living bacteria is <b>Azotobacter.</b> [...] Symbiotic nitrogen-fixing bacteria such as Rhizobium usually live in the root nodules of legumes (such as peas, alfalfa, and locust trees). Here they form a mutualistic relationship with the plant, producing ammonia in exchange for carbohydrates. Because of this relationship, legumes will often increase the nitrogen content of nitrogen-poor soils. A few non-legumes can also form such symbioses. Today, about 30% of the total fixed nitrogen is produced industrially using the Haber-Bosch process, which uses high temperatures and pressures to convert nitrogen gas and a hydrogen source (natural gas or petroleum) into ammonia.|$|E
