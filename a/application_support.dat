25|$|Datacenter: SQL Server 2008 R2 Datacenter is a full-featured {{edition of}} SQL Server and is {{designed}} for datacenters that need high levels of <b>application</b> <b>support</b> and scalability. It supports 256 logical processors and virtually unlimited memory and comes with StreamInsight Premium edition. The Datacenter edition has been retired in SQL Server 2012; all of its features are available in SQL Server 2012 Enterprise Edition.|$|E
25|$|This edition {{targeted}} the enterprise {{segment of the}} market and was sold through volume licensing to companies which have a Software Assurance contract with Microsoft. Additional features include support for Multilingual User Interface (MUI) packages, BitLocker Drive Encryption, and UNIX <b>application</b> <b>support.</b> Not available through retail or OEM channels, this edition is distributed through Microsoft Software Assurance (SA). As a result it includes several SA-only benefits, including a license allowing the operating of diskless nodes (diskless PCs) and activation via VLK.|$|E

25|$|Another {{solution}} to the library issue comes from using completely separate executables (often in some lightweight form) and calling them using a remote procedure call (RPC) over a network to another computer. This approach maximizes operating system re-use: the code needed to support the library is the same code being used to provide <b>application</b> <b>support</b> and security for every other program. Additionally, such systems do not require the library to exist on the same machine, but can forward the requests over the network.|$|E
25|$|Copland was {{designed}} to consist of the Mac OS {{on top of a}} microkernel named Nukernel, which would handle basic tasks such as application startup and memory management, leaving all other tasks to a series of semi-special programs known as servers. For instance, networking and file services would not be provided by the kernel itself, but by servers which would be sent requests though interapplication communications. Copland consists of the combination of Nukernel, various servers, and a suite of <b>application</b> <b>support</b> libraries to provide implementations of the well-known classic Macintosh programming interface.|$|E
2500|$|Although GIF {{allows for}} animation, {{it was decided}} that PNG should be a single-image format. [...] In 2001, the {{developers}} of PNG published the Multiple-image Network Graphics (MNG) format, with support for animation. [...] MNG achieved moderate <b>application</b> <b>support,</b> but not enough among mainstream web browsers and no usage among web site designers or publishers. [...] In 2008, certain Mozilla developers published the Animated Portable Network Graphics (APNG) format with similar goals. APNG is a format that is natively supported by Gecko- and Presto-based web browsers and is also commonly used for thumbnails on Sony's PlayStation Portable system (using the normal PNG file extension), and as of 2017, usage of APNG remains minimal despite being supported by all major browsers but Microsoft Edge.|$|E

2500|$|... mp3PRO {{development}} has been abandoned. The format was never standardized {{and there is no}} publicly available reference source code or documentation in existence. A very old software encoder/player exists, but is not maintained. Nero's Soundtrax application, bundled in the Nero Multimedia Suite, is capable of encoding and decoding this format into several others and the open source VLC media player is a popular media player capable of decoding the format. Some versions of the outdated MusicMatch Jukebox player were able to decode and encode this format, too. In the early 2000s, mp3PRO was usable in several portable music players and in popular music software, but its market share has deteriorated rapidly. The codec itself is largely surpassed in quality and efficiency, as well as device and <b>application</b> <b>support,</b> by modern codecs like AAC and its HE-AAC variants which employ the same SBR method.|$|E
