Travel time for personnel within the hospital and the transportation of patients between units is facilitated and minimised. The building <b>also</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> built to accommodate heavy departments such as radiology and operating rooms while space for special wiring, plumbing, and waste disposal must be allowed for in the design.|$|E
25|$|As {{soon as the}} {{disturbances}} had ceased, the Jews {{began to}} return and to rebuild their destroyed homes; {{and while it is}} true that the Jewish population of Poland had decreased, it still was more numerous than that of the Jewish colonies in Western Europe. Poland continued to be the spiritual center of Judaism. Through 1698, the Polish kings generally remained supportive of the Jews. It <b>also</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> noted that while Jewish losses in those events were high, estimated by some historians to be close to 500,000, the Commonwealth lost one third of its population — approximately three million of its citizens.|$|E
25|$|The Privy Council {{decision}} on Southern Rhodesia {{raised questions about}} the BSAC claim to the unalienated lands north of the Zambezi. However, the company's claim in Northern Rhodesia was based on concessions granted rather than conquest and, although a parliamentary Committee in 1921 recommended that these claims <b>also</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> referred to the Privy Council, the British government preferred to negotiate an overall settlement for the end of BSAC administration in Northern Rhodesia. This effectively acknowledged the company’s claim. Under an Agreement of 29 September 1923, the Northern Rhodesian government took over the entire control of lands previously controlled by BSAC from 1 April 1924, paying the company half the net rents and the proceeds of certain land sales.|$|E

25|$|The {{following}} table {{shows the}} severe decrease of population during that period. From the late Eastern Han to the Western Jin dynasty, despite {{the length of}} about 125 years, the peak population only equaled 35.3% of the peak population during the Eastern Han dynasty. From the Western Jin dynasty to the Sui dynasty, the population never recovered. It <b>also</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> noted that high militarization {{of the population was}} common. For example, the population of Shu was 900,000, but the military numbered over 100,000, taking up more than 10% of the population. The Records of the Three Kingdoms contains population figures for the Three Kingdoms. As with many Chinese historical population figures, these numbers are likely to be less than the actual populations, since census and tax records went hand in hand, and tax evaders were often not on records.|$|E
25|$|In Germany, a {{relatively}} new law, which {{has been established in}} 2013, strengthens the rights of patients. It states, amongst other things, the statutory duty of medical personnel to document the treatment of the patient in either hard copy or within the electronic patient record (EPR). This documentation must happen in a timely manner and encompass each and every form of treatment the patient receives, as well as other necessary information, such as the patient’s case history, diagnoses, findings, treatment results, therapies and their effects, surgical interventions and their effects, as well as informed consents. The information must include virtually everything that is of functional importance for the actual, but also for future treatment. This documentation must also include the medical report and must be archived by the attending physician for at least 10 years. The law clearly states that these records are not only memory aids for the physicians, but <b>also</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> kept for the patient and must be presented on request.|$|E
25|$|The Software Configuration Management system, is {{a system}} at the vendor’s site which keeps track of the {{configurations}} at the customer site. By storing this in a system the vendor {{will be able to}} give the customer particular service when it needs a new product. In the software configuration management system information about the products used by the customer, the version of these products, as well as which updates are already being done, is stored. In some cases {{it is possible that the}} vendor did some modifications to the product particularly for this customer. This will also have to be stored in the system. Also there needs to be configuration data, some generic information about the configuration the customer is using. For example what operating platform the customer uses for its software. What <b>also</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> stored in this system is information about the feedback that the vendor gets from the customer. This includes bug reports, product usage data, error reports and usage questions. More information about this feedback can be found in the CCU phase activation and usage.|$|E

2500|$|In this connection, {{another thing}} <b>also</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> kept in mind: evil {{suggestion}} is not whispered {{into the heart}} of man only from outside by the satans from among men and jinn, but also by the self of man from within. His own wrong theories misguide his intellect, his own unlawful motives and desires lead his power of discrimination, will and power of judgment astray, and {{it is not only the}} satans from outside but within his satan of the self also beguiles him. This has been expressed in the Quran: [...] "and We know the evil suggestions arising from his self." [...] (Qaf : 16). On this very basis, Muhammad said: [...] "We seek Allah's refuge from the evils of our self." ...|$|E

2500|$|There {{still is}} controversy, however. Scientists such as Jared Diamond in The Third Chimpanzee, and Morris Goodman of Wayne State University in Detroit {{suggest that the}} bonobo and common {{chimpanzee}} are so closely related to humans that their genus name <b>also</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> classified with the human genus Homo: Homo paniscus, Homo sylvestris, or Homo arboreus. An alternative philosophy suggests that the term Homo sapiens is the misnomer [...] rather, and that humans should be reclassified as Pan sapiens, though this would violate the Principle of Priority, as Homo was named before Pan (1758 for the former, 1816 for the latter). In either case, a name change of the genus would have implications on the taxonomy of extinct species closely related to humans, including Australopithecus. The current line between Homo and non-Homo species is drawn about 2.5 million years ago, and chimpanzee and human ancestry converge only about 7 million years ago, {{with the emergence of}} Sahelanthropus, nearly three times longer.|$|E
2500|$|As {{currently}} accepted, {{the species}} was first scientifically described by John Whitchurch Bennett in 1830 {{based on the}} holotype specimen taken from the south coast of Sri Lanka. He named this new species Scomber heberi, placing it in the mackerel genus which {{at that time was}} a common genus for placing carangid fishes. The origin of the specific epithet is unclear, with it possibly named after someone or relate to the German word Heber, meaning [...] "lob". With the creation of the genus Caranx, the species was transferred there, where it has remained. There is some confusion over a species described by Peter Forsskål in 1775 under the name Scomber sansun and later transferred to Caranx sansun. This species is still listed as valid by some authorities, although a 1968 review of the taxon by J.L.B. Smith failed to find the holotype and suggested a new name with holotype be introduced to replace it; Caranx williamsi. This name was sunk into C. heberi by William Smith-Vaniz in a major review, indicating C. sansun <b>also</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> sunk. Despite this, the name remains valid amongst some authorities. A second, later independent description of the fish by Georges Cuvier produced the name Caranx sem, which became common throughout the literature. Probable synonymy with C. heberi was recognized by Henry Fowler in 1905 ...|$|E
