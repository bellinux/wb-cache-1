5|$|The {{race of the}} two seas {{began with}} a flat team time trial {{starting}} and ending in Marina di Carrara in Tuscany on the Tyrrhenian coast. The course cut inland briefly, but doubled back and ended less than <b>a</b> <b>kilometer</b> from where it started.|$|E
5|$|The entire Colorado Plateau {{then started}} to uplift from near sea level to several {{thousand}} feet (over <b>a</b> <b>kilometer)</b> in elevation. An alternate {{theory is that}} the Laramide orogeny uplifted what is today the Basin and Range and the Colorado Plateau and that the tensional forces that formed the Basin and Range caused that region to subside relative to the Colorado Plateau. Whatever the order of events were, the High Plateaus region of the Colorado Plateau were by now nearly complete.|$|E
5|$|Bryennios {{arranged}} {{his army}} in the typical three divisions, each in two lines, as prescribed by the Byzantine military manuals. The right wing, under his brother John, was 5,000 strong and comprised his Frankish mercenaries, Thessalian cavalry, the Hetaireia, and the Maniakatai regiment (descendants of the veterans of George Maniakes's campaign in Sicily and Italy). His left wing, 3,000 men from Thrace and Macedonia, was placed under Katakalon Tarchaneiotes, and the centre, under Bryennios himself, comprised 3,000–4,000 men from Thessaly, Thrace and Macedonia. Again, according to standard doctrine, on his far left, about half <b>a</b> <b>kilometer</b> ("two stadia") from the main force, he had stationed an outflanking detachment (hyperkerastai) of Pechenegs.|$|E
5000|$|Duathlons are {{conducted}} at sprint, standard and long distances.

5|$|In 1960, Finnair started {{flying to}} Helsinki, {{although}} direct flights were not introduced until 1971. After 1962, the east–west runway became the main runway. Along with the runway expansion, a new service building, with {{a capacity for}} 2million passengers, was opened in 1964. It was located about half <b>a</b> <b>kilometer</b> (quarter of a mile) south of the former terminal. Designed by Odd Nansens Arkitektkontor, it had two stories, one for arrivals and one for departures, and two wings, one for domestic and one for international flights. It included a central hall that had a panorama view over the aircraft. The expanded facilities allowed SAS to take into use Sud Aviation Caravelle jets on the Copenhagen routes, although they were also occasionally used to Bodø.|$|E
5|$|Norris {{began to}} plan for the rescue of Walker, still more than <b>a</b> <b>kilometer</b> behind front lines. Walker managed to evade capture for almost 11 days when on the night of April 18, without FAC coverage, he moved on his own accord and ran into a local {{villager}} who alerted the North Vietnamese. They began tracking him and the next morning the FAC saw NVA very near Walker's position. Walker radioed the FAC that rescue should not be attempted because NVA forces were closing in and he was under fire. Bilk 36, a OV-10A flown by FAC 1st Lt. Mickey Fain, reported that Walker was surrounded by more than 20 NVA soldiers and shortly afterward saw his body lying in the grass. Walker's body was never recovered.|$|E
5|$|On 8February 1913, the Ottoman navy {{supported}} an {{amphibious assault}} at Şarköy. Turgut Reis and Barbaros Hayreddin, {{along with two}} small cruisers provided artillery support to the right flank of the invading force once it went ashore. The ships were positioned about <b>a</b> <b>kilometer</b> off shore; Turgut Reis was the second ship in the line, behind her sister Barbaros Hayreddin. The Bulgarian army resisted fiercely, which ultimately forced the Ottoman army to retreat, though the withdrawal was successful in large {{part due to the}} gunfire support from Turgut Reis {{and the rest of the}} fleet. During the battle, Turgut Reis fired 225rounds from her 10.5cm guns and 202 shells from her 8.8cm guns.|$|E

5|$|Sea otters live {{in coastal}} waters 15 to 23meters (50 to 75ft) deep, and usually stay within <b>a</b> <b>kilometer</b> (⅔mi) of the shore. They are found {{most often in}} areas with {{protection}} from the most severe ocean winds, such as rocky coastlines, thick kelp forests, and barrier reefs. Although they are most strongly associated with rocky substrates, sea otters can also live {{in areas where the}} sea floor consists primarily of mud, sand, or silt. Their northern range is limited by ice, as sea otters can survive amidst drift ice but not land-fast ice. Individuals generally occupy a home range a few kilometers long, and remain there year-round.|$|E
5|$|The axis of {{the pyramid}} complex may be {{associated}} with a series of monuments strung out along <b>a</b> <b>kilometer</b> of desert. Along this axis are several key structures: 1) a large pyramid dedicated to his grandmother Tetisheri which contained a stele depicting Ahmose providing offerings to her; 2) a rockcut underground complex which may either have served as a token representation of an Osirian underworld or as an actual royal tomb; and 3) a terraced temple built against the high cliffs, featuring massive stone and brick terraces. These elements reflect in general a similar plan undertaken for the cenotaph of Senwosret III and in general its construction contains elements which reflect the style of both Old and Middle Kingdom pyramid complexes.|$|E
5|$|The sixth day {{of racing}} {{was marred by}} poor weather. General {{classification}} contenders Pedro Delgado and Laurent Fignon lost time due to crashing on the descent of Monte Terminillo, while Greg LeMond lost over two minutes. On the final climb of the day, Iñaki Gastón and Leonardo Sierra attacked with eight kilometers to go but were caught by the chasing riders. Gaston attacked again with <b>a</b> <b>kilometer</b> remaining, but was robbed of the stage win as Vladimir Poulnikov overtook him three meters before the finish. Cipollini won the event's seventh leg {{by means of a}} field sprint.|$|E

5|$|The {{property}} that makes neurons unique is {{their ability to}} send signals to specific target cells over long distances. They send these signals {{by means of an}} axon, which is a thin protoplasmic fiber that extends from the cell body and projects, usually with numerous branches, to other areas, sometimes nearby, sometimes in distant parts of the brain or body. The length of an axon can be extraordinary: for example, if a pyramidal cell, (an excitatory neuron) of the cerebral cortex were magnified so that its cell body became the size of a human body, its axon, equally magnified, would become a cable a few centimeters in diameter, extending more than <b>a</b> <b>kilometer.</b> These axons transmit signals in the form of electrochemical pulses called action potentials, which last less than a thousandth of a second and travel along the axon at speeds of 1–100 meters per second. Some neurons emit action potentials constantly, at rates of 10–100 per second, usually in irregular patterns; other neurons are quiet most of the time, but occasionally emit a burst of action potentials.|$|E
5|$|The very {{extensive}} survey {{carried out}} (2005–2009) by the Battlefields Trust headed by Glenn Foard led eventually {{to the discovery}} of the real location of the core battlefield. This lies about <b>a</b> <b>kilometer</b> further west than the location suggested by Peter Foss. It is in what was {{at the time of the}} battle an area of marginal land at the meeting of several township boundaries. There was a cluster of field names suggesting the presence of marshland and heath. Thirty four lead round shot were discovered as a result of systematic metal detecting (more than the total found previously on all other C15th European battlefields), as well as other significant finds, including a small silver gilt badge depicting a boar. Experts believe that the boar badge could indicate the actual site of Richard III's death, since this high-status badge depicting his personal emblem, was probably worn by a member of his close retinue.|$|E
5|$|Israeli {{forces from}} the Carmeli Brigade first {{captured}} al-Birwa and positions overlooking it on 11 June 1948 as part of Operation Ben-Ami, a day before the first truce of the 1948 Arab-Israeli War. During the fighting, 45 elderly residents hid in the church with the priest. The defenders of the village surrendered after losing men and running out of ammunition. The residents took refuge in nearby villages for thirteen days. Nevertheless, clashes continued during the truce. According to local militiamen from al-Birwa, 96 men from the village armed with rifles, and {{an equal number of}} men armed with non-firearms and unarmed women assembled near {{the front lines of the}} Arab Liberation Army (ALA). The rifle-armed force charged first across the front lines, followed by the men armed with axes, shovels, and sticks, and then the women who carried water to assist the wounded. Al-Birwa's ad-hoc militia took the small force of Haganah soldiers (who became part of the Israel Defense Forces on 26 May) by surprise and forced them back <b>a</b> <b>kilometer</b> west of al-Birwa. Afterward, al-Birwa's residents harvested their crops. They remained in the village until 24 June, when ALA commanders suggested that they join their families in the nearby villages. The militiamen claimed that the ALA stood by during the clashes because they did not receive orders from their superiors.|$|E
