Nanoscale torsion rods, ~ 1 μm {{long and}} 50 – 100 nm in diameter, provide both extraordinary thermal isolation and excellent <b>angular</b> <b>displacement</b> and torque <b>sensitivities,</b> of order ~ 10 ^(– 7) rad·Hz^(– 1 / 2) and 10 ^(– 22) (N·m) Hz^(– 1 / 2), respectively. Furthermore, these nanorods act as linear torsional springs, yielding a maximum <b>angular</b> <b>displacement</b> of 3. 6 ° and a dynamic range of over 100 dB; this exceeds {{the performance of}} flexural modes {{by as much as}} 5 orders of magnitude. These attributes lead to superior noise performance for torsional-mode sensing. We demonstrate the operational principles of torsional-mode IR detection, attaining an uncooled noise equivalent temperature difference (NETD) of 390 mK. By modeling the fundamental noise processes, we project that further reduction of device size can significantly improve thermal responsivity; a room-temperature NETD below 10 mK appears feasible...|$|R

40|$|AbstractAt present, it is {{difficult}} to accurately forecast the water inrush from coal seam floor. For safety, it is necessary to monitor and predict water inrush. Rock <b>angular</b> <b>displacement</b> can be observed easily and can show whether the coal seam floor has bent and destroyed or not. The elastic-plastic analysis and numerical simulation indicate that, 1) when <b>angular</b> <b>displacement</b> of rock is greater than the critical value, water inrush shall take place; 2) the critical value of <b>angular</b> <b>displacement</b> is 2 (1 + μ) /E × τ 0 by elastic-plastic analysis while the critical values of <b>angular</b> <b>displacement</b> in Buchun mine are 0. 0019 radian for shale stone and 0. 005 radian for fine sandstone, respectively, by numerical simulation. Based on these conclusions, we designed the early warning system of water inrush to obtain the laws of the damage depth of floor rock and <b>angular</b> <b>displacement.</b> The practice shows that using the method of rock <b>angular</b> <b>displacement</b> is very effective for monitoring and forecasting water inrush caused by coal seam floor failure...|$|R

40|$|Torsional {{fretting}} {{exists in}} many engineering applications and the contact configurations have great {{effects on the}} fretting wear behavior. Influence of <b>angular</b> <b>displacement</b> amplitudes and normal loads on torsional fretting were investigated under flat on flat contact.

It is found that ET and VW analysis helps to reveal the variation of failure mechanisms with the change of <b>angular</b> <b>displacement</b> amplitudes. Uneven spread of wear scar under mixed slip resulted from the effects of debris on stress-redistribution.

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the {{nonlinear}} oscillation of a simple pendulum and presents not only the exact formula for the period but also the exact expression of the <b>angular</b> <b>displacement</b> {{as a function of}} the time, the amplitude of oscillations and the angular frequency for small oscillations. This <b>angular</b> <b>displacement</b> is written in terms of the Jacobi elliptic function sn(u;m) using the following initial conditions: the initial <b>angular</b> <b>displacement</b> is different from zero while the initial angular velocity is zero. The <b>angular</b> <b>displacements</b> are plotted using Mathematica, an available symbolic computer program that allows us to plot easily the function obtained. As we will see, even for amplitudes as high as 0. 75 pi (135 º) it is possible to use the expression for the <b>angular</b> <b>displacement,</b> but considering the exact expression for the angular frequency w in terms of the complete elliptic integral of the first kind. We can conclude that for amplitudes lower than 135 º the periodic motion exhibited by a simple pendulum is practically harmonic but its oscillations are not isochronous (the period is a function of the initial amplitude). We believe that present study may be a suitable and fruitful exercise for teaching and better understanding the behavior of the nonlinear pendulum in advanced undergraduate courses on classical mechanics...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—This paper {{presents}} {{the design and}} analysis of permanent magnet (PM) thrust bearing made up of three ring pairs for five degrees of freedom of the inner rings (rotor rings). The arrangement pattern of rings in PM bearing is considered in two ways: conventional structure and Halbach structure. The simplified three dimensional (3 D) mathematical models employing Coulombian approach and vector method are used to design the bearing. MATLAB codes are written to evaluate the axial force, stiffness and moments in both the structures for five degrees of freedom, thereby the effect of axial, radial and <b>angular</b> <b>displacements</b> of the rotor on the aforementioned characteristics is addressed. The results of the mathematical model are validated {{by the results of}} 3 D Finite Element Analysis (FEA) and experiments. It is observed that, the conventional structure seems to be more sensitive to the <b>angular</b> <b>displacement,</b> as the percentage decrease in force and stiffness is more with respect to <b>angular</b> <b>displacement</b> than the Halbach structure. The effect of <b>angular</b> <b>displacement</b> of the rotor on the performance of bearing in both the structures is crucial. 1...|$|R
40|$|Ankle sprain {{injury is}} very common in sports {{and the use of}} ankle support is crucial. This {{research}} investigated the effect of an ankle brace in reducing the ankle <b>angular</b> <b>displacement</b> and <b>angular</b> velocity during sudden supination. In the experiment, 11 healthy males were tested. The bracing condition, semi-rigid ankle braces were investigated. The <b>angular</b> <b>displacement</b> and <b>angular</b> velocity of the ankle were computed. The motion-capture system was adopted to capture the three-dimensional coordinates of the reflective markers. The coordinates of the reflective markers were used to compute the ankle kinematics during simulated ankle supination. A mechanical supination platform was used to simulate the sprain motions. Experimental results showed that the semi-rigid brace tested significantly reduced the ankle <b>angular</b> <b>displacement</b> and <b>angular</b> velocity compared with control conditions during sudden supination. In conclusion, the semi-rigid-type brace can provide significant restriction to reduce the magnitudes of the <b>angular</b> <b>displacement</b> and <b>angular</b> velocity of the ankle during sudden supination sprain. The semi-rigid-type brace is suggested as the prophylactic bracing for the ankle. Department of Industrial and Systems Engineerin...|$|R
