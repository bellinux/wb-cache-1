25|$|A-T {{is caused}} by a defect in the <b>ATM</b> <b>gene,</b> which is {{responsible}} for managing the cell’s response to multiple forms of stress including double-strand breaks in DNA. In simple terms, the protein produced by the <b>ATM</b> <b>gene</b> recognizes that there is a break in DNA, recruits other proteins to fix the break, and stops the cell from making new DNA until the repair is complete.|$|E
25|$|The {{diagnosis}} can {{be confirmed}} in the laboratory by finding an absence or deficiency of the ATM protein in cultured blood cells, an absence or deficiency of ATM function (kinase assay), or mutations in both copies of the cell’s <b>ATM</b> <b>gene.</b> These more specialized tests are not always needed, but are particularly helpful if a child’s symptoms are atypical.|$|E
25|$|Women who are A-T {{carriers}} (who {{have one}} mutated {{copy of the}} <b>ATM</b> <b>gene),</b> have approximately a two-fold increased risk {{for the development of}} breast cancer compared to the general population. This includes all mothers of A-T children and some female relatives. Current consensus is that special screening tests are not helpful, but all women should have routine cancer surveillance.|$|E
40|$|Epigenetic {{silencing}} of {{gene expression}} {{has become an}} intensively studied topic regarding breast cancer during the last years. Previous investigations have shown that hypermethylation in gene promoters is an alternative to mutations cancer-related mechanism for inactivation of tumor suppressor gene function. The present study was designed for evaluation of promoter methylation in p 53 and <b>ATM</b> tumor suppressor <b>genes</b> in Bulgarian patients with sporadic breast cancer. Sodium bisulfite conversion and methylation-specific PCR were performed on tumor DNA isolated from 55 patients with sporadic breast cancer. The data showed normal profile of methylation in the promoter region of p 53 and <b>ATM</b> <b>genes</b> in all studied patients. Cases with hypermethylation were not observed. Our results {{did not support the}} involvement of p 53 and ATM promoter hypermethylation in the neoplastic pathways of sporadic breast cancer. The lack of promoter hypermethylation in p 53 and ATM is suggestive of a greater share of genetic aberrations in loss of tumor suppressor function of these genes and presumes the involvement of other epigenetic cancer mechanisms. To our knowledge this study provides the first data on promoter hypermethylation status of p 53 and <b>ATM</b> <b>genes</b> in Bulgarian patients...|$|R
25|$|The {{diagnosis}} of A-T is usually suspected by {{the combination of}} neurologic clinical features (ataxia, abnormal control of eye movement, and postural instability) with telangiectasia and sometimes increased infections, and confirmed by specific laboratory abnormalities (elevated alpha-fetoprotein levels, increased chromosomal breakage or cell death of white blood cells after exposure to X-rays, absence of ATM protein in white blood cells, or mutations {{in each of the}} person’s <b>ATM</b> <b>genes).</b>|$|R
25|$|The mode of {{inheritance}} for A-T is autosomal recessive. Each {{parent is}} a carrier, {{meaning that they}} have one normal copy of the A-T <b>gene</b> (<b>ATM)</b> and one copy which is mutated. A-T occurs if a child inherits the mutated A-T gene from each parent, so in a family with two carrier parents, there is 1 chance in 4 that a child born to the parents will have the disorder. Prenatal diagnosis (and carrier detection) {{can be carried out}} in families if the errors (mutation) in an affected child’s two <b>ATM</b> <b>genes</b> have been identified. The process of getting this done can be complicated and, as it requires time, should be arranged before conception.|$|R
25|$|Carriers of A-T, such as {{the parents}} of a person with A-T, have one mutated copy of the <b>ATM</b> <b>gene</b> and one normal copy. They are {{generally}} healthy, but there is an increased risk of breast cancer in women. This finding has been confirmed in a variety of different ways, and is the subject of current research. Standard surveillance (including monthly breast self-exams and mammography at the usual schedule for age) is recommended, unless additional tests are indicated because the individual has other risk factors (e.g., family history of breast cancer).|$|E
25|$|Looking for {{mutations}} in the <b>ATM</b> <b>gene</b> of an unrelated person (for example, the spouse of a known A-T carrier) presents significant challenges. Genes often have variant spellings (polymorphisms) {{which do not}} affect function. In a gene as large as ATM, such variant spellings are likely to occur and doctors cannot always predict whether a specific variant will or will not cause disease. Genetic counseling can help family members of an A-T patient understand what can or cannot be tested, and how the test results should be interpreted.|$|E
50|$|The <b>ATM</b> <b>gene</b> {{promoter}} {{was observed}} to be hypermethylated in 53% of small (impalpable) breast cancers and was hypermethylated in 78% of stage II or greater breast cancers {{with a highly}} significant correlation (P = 0.0006) between reduced ATM mRNA abundance and aberrant methylation of the <b>ATM</b> <b>gene</b> promoter.|$|E
40|$|Neural {{degeneration}} {{is one of}} {{the clinical}} manifestations of ataxia-telangiectasia, a disorder caused by mutations in the <b>Atm</b> protein kinase <b>gene,</b> However, neural degeneration was not detected with general purpose light microscopic methods in previous studies using several different lines of mice with disrupted <b>Atm</b> <b>genes.</b> Here, we show electron microscopic evidence of degeneration of several different types of neurons in the cerebellar cortex of 2 -month-old Atm knockout mice, which is accompanied by glial activation, deterioration of neuropil structure, and both pre-and postsynaptic degeneration, These findings are similar to those in patients with ataxia-telangiectasia, indicating that Atm knockout mice are a useful model to elucidate the mechanisms underlying neurodegeneration in this condition and to develop and test strategies to palliate and prevent the disease...|$|R
40|$|The {{existence}} of a potential primary central nervous system lymphoma-specific genomic signature that differs from the systemic form of diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) has been suggested, but is still controversial. We investigated 19 patients with primary DLBCL of central nervous system (DLBCL CNS) using the TruSeq Amplicon Cancer Panel (TSACP) for 48 cancer-related genes. Next generation sequencing (NGS) analyses have revealed that over 80 % of potentially protein-changing mutations were located in eight genes (CTNNB 1, PIK 3 CA, PTEN, ATM, KRAS, PTPN 11, TP 53 and JAK 3), pointing to the potential role of these genes in lymphomagenesis. TP 53 was the only gene harboring mutations in all 19 patients. In addition, the presence of mutated TP 53 and <b>ATM</b> <b>genes</b> correlated with a higher total number of mutations in other analyzed genes. Furthermore, the presence of mutated ATM correlated with poorer event-free survival (EFS) (p = 0. 036). The presence of the mutated SMO gene correlated with earlier disease relapse (p = 0. 023), inferior event-free survival (p = 0. 011) and overall survival (OS) (p = 0. 017), while mutations in the PTEN gene were associated with inferior OS (p = 0. 048). Our {{findings suggest that the}} TP 53 and <b>ATM</b> <b>genes</b> could be involved in the molecular pathophysiology of primary DLBCL CNS, whereas mutations in the PTEN and SMO genes could affect survival regardless of the initial treatment approach...|$|R
40|$|A {{haplotype}} {{analysis is}} becoming increasingly important in studying complex genetic diseases. Various algorithms and specialized computer software {{have been developed to}} statistically estimate haplotype frequencies from marker phenotypes in unrelated individuals. However, currently there are very few empirical reports on the performance of the methods for the recovery of haplotype frequencies. One of the most widely used methods of haplotype reconstruction is the Maximum Likelihood method, employing the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm. The aim {{of this study is to}} explore the variability of the EM estimates of the haplotype frequency for real data. We analyzed haplotypes at the BLM, WRN, RECQL and <b>ATM</b> <b>genes</b> with 8 – 14 biallelic markers per gene in 300 individuals. We also re-analyzed the data presented by Mano et al. (2002). We studied the convergence speed, the shape of the loglikelihood hypersurface, and the existence of local maxima, as well as their relations with heterozygosity, the linkage disequilibrium and departures from the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. Our study contributes to determining practical values for algorithm sensitivities...|$|R
50|$|Mutations in the <b>ATM</b> <b>gene</b> are {{responsible}} for Ataxia telangiecstasia. These mutations are generally single base pair substitutions, deletions, or micro-insertions. A 4-nucleotide deletion within intron 20 of the <b>ATM</b> <b>gene</b> disrupts an exonic splicing silencer and causes {{the inclusion of a}} 65-nucleotide cryptic exon in the mature transcript. The inclusion of the cryptic exon results in protein truncation and atypical splicing patterns.|$|E

50|$|More than 73% {{of brain}} tumors {{were found to}} be {{methylated}} in the <b>ATM</b> <b>gene</b> promoter and there was strong inverse correlation between ATM promoter methylation and its protein expression (p < 0.001).|$|E
30|$|A {{positive}} {{family history}} of breast cancer is known to {{increase the risk of}} breast cancer. However, it was only in 1990, {{based on the results of}} linkage analysis performed by Hall et al. (1990) that firm evidence was provided for the existence of at least one hereditary breast cancer gene. Miki et al described the first germ line mutation known to confer increased risk of breast cancer in 1994, labelled BRCA 1 Miki et al. (1994). Shortly thereafter, a second germ line mutation associated with increased risk was also identified and named BRCA 2 Wooster et al. 1995). Subsequently, several susceptibility genes have been associated with breast cancer. These genes confer ‘high-risk’ and ‘low to moderate risk’ of breast cancer. The high-risk breast cancer susceptibility genes include BRCA 1, BRCA 2, PTEN, TP 53, LKB 1 /STK 11 and CDH 1, with relative lifetime risks higher than 4 (but generally much higher at young ages). The CHEK 2, TGFβ 1, CASP 8 and <b>ATM</b> <b>genes</b> belong to the ‘low to moderate-risk’ breast cancer susceptibility genes Oldenburg et al. (2007).|$|R
40|$|Runs of {{homozygosity}} (ROH) {{may play}} a role in complex diseases. In the current study, we aimed to test if ROHs are linked to the risk of autism and related language impairment. We analyzed 546, 080 SNPs in 315 Han Chinese affected with autism and 1, 115 controls. ROH was defined as an extended homozygous haplotype spanning at least 500 kb. Relative extended haplotype homozygosity (REHH) for the trait-associated ROH region was calculated to search for the signature of selection sweeps. Totally, we identified 676 ROH regions. An ROH region on 11 q 22. 3 was significantly associated with speech delay (corrected p = 1. 7361028). This region contains the NPAT and <b>ATM</b> <b>genes</b> associated with ataxia telangiectasia characterized by language impairment; the CUL 5 (culin 5) gene in the same region may modulate the neuronal migration process related to language functions. These three genes are highly expressed in the cerebellum. No evidence for recent positive selection was detected on the core haplotypes in this region. The same ROH region was also nominally significantly associated wit...|$|R
50|$|Recombinant-defective {{mutations}} {{can occur}} in Spo11, DMC1, <b>ATM</b> and MSH5 <b>genes</b> of spermatocytes. These mutations involve double strand break repair impairment, which can result in arrest of spermatogenesis at stage IV of the seminiferous epithelium cycle.|$|R

5000|$|ATM {{functions}} during meiotic prophase. [...] The wild-type <b>ATM</b> <b>gene</b> {{is expressed}} at a 4-fold increased level in human testes compared to somatic cells (such as skin fibroblasts). [...] In both mice and humans, ATM deficiency results in {{female and male}} infertility. Deficient ATM expression causes severe meiotic disruption during prophase I. [...] In addition, impaired ATM-mediated DNA double-strand break (DSB) repair {{has been identified as}} a likely cause of aging of mouse and human oocytes. [...] Expression of the <b>ATM</b> <b>gene,</b> as well as other key DSB repair genes, declines with age in mouse and human oocytes and this decline is paralleled by an increase of DSBs in primordial follicles. [...] These findings indicate that ATM-mediated homologous recombinational repair is a crucial function of meiosis.|$|E
40|$|Ataxia-telangiectasia (A-T) is an {{autosomal}} recessive disorder characterized by cerebellar degeneration, immunodeficiency, chromosomal instability, radiosensitivity, and cancer predisposition. A-T cells {{are sensitive to}} ionizing radiation and radiomimetic chemicals and fail to activate cell-cycle checkpoints after treatment with these agents. The responsible <b>gene,</b> <b>ATM,</b> encodes a large protein kinase with a phosphatidylinositol 3 -kinase-like domain. The typical A-T phenotype is caused, in most cases, by null ATM alleles that truncate or severely destabilize the ATM protein. Rare patients with milder manifestations of the clinical or cellular characteristics of the disease have been reported and have been designated "A-T variants. " A special variant form of A-T is A-TFresno, which combines a typical A-T phenotype with microcephaly and mental retardation. The possible association of these syndromes with ATM is both important for understanding their molecular basis and essential for counseling and diagnostic purposes. We quantified ATM-protein levels in six A-T variants, and we searched their <b>ATM</b> <b>genes</b> for mutations. Cell lines from these patients exhibited considerable variability in radiosensitivity while showing the typical radioresistant DNA synthesis of A-T cells. Unlike classical A-T patients, these patients exhibited 1 %- 17 % of the normal level of ATM. The underlying ATM genotypes were either homozygous for mutations expected to produce mild phenotypes or compound heterozygotes for a mild and a severe mutation. An A-TFresno cell line was found devoid of the ATM protein and homozygous for a severe ATM mutation. We conclude that certain "A-T variant" phenotypes represent ATM mutations, including some of those without telangiectasia. Our findings extend the range of phenotypes associated with ATM mutations...|$|R
40|$|PARP- 1 and ATM {{are both}} {{involved}} in the response to DNA strand breaks, resulting in induction of a signaling network responsible for DNA surveillance, cellular recovery, and cell survival. ATM interacts with double-strand break repair pathways and induces signals resulting in {{the control of the}} cell cycle-coupled checkpoints. PARP- 1 acts as a DNA break sensor in the base excision repair pathway of DNA. Mice with mutations inactivating either protein show radiosensitivity and high radiation-induced chromosomal aberration frequencies. Embryos carrying double mutations of both PARP- 1 and <b>Atm</b> <b>genes</b> were generated. These mutant embryos show apoptosis in the embryo but not in extraembryonic tissues and die at embryonic day 8. 0, although extraembryonic tissues appear normal for up to 10. 5 days of gestation. These results reveal a functional synergy between PARP- 1 and ATM during a period of embryogenesis when cell cycle checkpoints are not active and the embryo is particularly sensitive to DNA damage. These results suggest that ATM and PARP- 1 have synergistic phenotypes due to the effects of these proteins on signaling DNA damage and/or on distinct pathways of DNA repair...|$|R
40|$|The MYST {{family of}} lysine acetyltransferases (KATs) {{function}} {{in a wide variety}} of cellular operations, including gene regulation and the DNA damage response. Here we report the characterization of the second MYST family KAT in the protozoan parasite Toxoplasma gondii (TgMYST-B). Toxoplasma causes birth defects and is an opportunistic pathogen in the immunocompromised, the latter due to its ability to convert into a latent cyst (bradyzoite). We demonstrate that TgMYST-B can gain access to the parasite nucleus and acetylate histones. Overexpression of recombinant, tagged TgMYST-B reduces growth rate in vitro and confers protection from a DNA-alkylating agent. Expression of mutant TgMYST-B produced no growth defect and failed to protect against DNA damage. We demonstrate that cells overexpressing TgMYST-B have increased levels of ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM) kinase and phosphorylated H 2 AX and that TgMYST-B localizes to the <b>ATM</b> kinase <b>gene.</b> Pharmacological inhibitors of ATM kinase or KATs reverse the slow growth phenotype seen in parasites overexpressing TgMYST-B. These studies are the first to show that a MYST KAT contributes to <b>ATM</b> kinase <b>gene</b> expression, further illuminating the mechanism of how ATM kinase is up-regulated to respond to DNA damage...|$|R

50|$|Mutations in the <b>ATM</b> <b>gene</b> cause ataxia-telangiectasia. The <b>ATM</b> <b>gene</b> {{provides}} {{instructions for}} making a protein that helps control cell division and is involved in DNA repair. This protein {{plays an important role}} in the normal development and activity of several body systems, including the nervous system and immune system. The ATM protein assists cells in recognizing damaged or broken DNA strands and coordinates DNA repair by activating enzymes that fix the broken strands. Efficient repair of damaged DNA strands helps maintain the stability of the cell's genetic information. Affected children typically develop difficulty walking, problems with balance and hand coordination, involuntary jerking movements (chorea), muscle twitches (myoclonus), and disturbances in nerve function (neuropathy). The movement problems typically cause people to require wheelchair assistance by adolescence. People with this disorder also have slurred speech and trouble moving their eyes to look side-to-side (oculomotor apraxia).|$|E

40|$|We {{report a}} case of basaloid {{pancreatic}} carcinoma with clinical, pathological, and genomic data. The 73 -year-old male patient had jaundice, acholic stool, diarrhea, weight loss, and a large, painless gall bladder. His GGT was highly elevated. The pancreatic head contained a tumor, which was resected by partial pancreatoduodenectomy with pancreato-gastric anastomosis, cholecystectomy, and lymphadenectomy. On gross examination, a 3. 8 -cm white firm nodule was found, which microscopically was composed of basaloid cell nests with a less than usual desmoplastic stromal background and focally PANIN. Immunohistochemical profile displayed strong CK 5 / 6, CK 19, p 63, EGFR, vimentin, and evident CK 14 expression and absence of expression of CK 7, chromogranin, synaptophysin, and BRCA 1. A high Ki- 67 index and p 53 expression were noted. Sequencing of the most frequent 46 oncogenes with ionTorrent (AmpliSeq PCR) method identified PIK 3 CA, KRAS, and TP 53 genes as drivers and variants of the FGFR 3, PDGFRA, KIT, KDR, EGFR, RET, and <b>ATM</b> <b>genes.</b> The tumor we report displays histopathological appearances similar to the previously described case and a genomic landscape fitting {{to the general population}} of pancreatic carcinomas.

40|$|P 53 tumor {{suppressor}} {{protein is}} {{a key component of}} genome guard. The p 53 inactivation occurs frequently in many human cancers by mutation or over-expression of its specific inhibitor named MDM 2 oncoprotein (Murine Double Minute- 2), thus MDM 2 inhibitors might offer the preventive and therapeutic strategies. In contrast, ATM (Ataxia Telangiectasia Mutated) tumor suppressor protein activates p 53 protein. The MDM 2 inhibitors such as Nutlin- 3, HLI 98 and MDM 2 antisense oligonucleotides have been identified, but clinical validation is still pending. The Zataria multiflora Boiss. has antioxidant and antibacterial effects. To determine the correlation between the Zataria multiflora Boiss. and anti-carcinogenesis effects, we investigated the role of the essential oil of this plant on MDM 2 and <b>ATM</b> <b>genes</b> expression using semi-quantitative RT-PCR in liver samples of 8 normal male rats. The results clearly showed that ATM and MDM 2 gene expression increased and decreased, respectively, although the difference in ATM mRNA between target and control groups did not reach levels of significance. Our data implicated the essential oil of Zataria multiflora Boiss. as a down-regulator of MDM 2 gene expression and may offer new tools for therapeutic intervention in the p 53 pathway for cancer prevention and treatment...|$|R
40|$|The Saccharomyces cerevisiae RAD 9 {{checkpoint}} gene {{is required for}} transient cell-cycle arrests and transcriptional induction of DNA repair genes in response to DNA damage. Polyclonal antibodies raised against the Rad 9 protein recognized several polypeptides in asynchronous cultures, and in cells arrested in S or G 2 /M phases while a single form was observed in G 1 -arrested cells. Treatment with various DNA damaging agents, i. e. UV, ionizing radiation or methyl methane sulfonate, resulted in the appearance of hypermodified forms of the protein. All modifications detected during a normal cell cycle and after DNA damage were sensitive to phosphatase treatment, indicating that they resulted from phosphorylation. Damage-induced hyperphosphorylation of Rad 9 correlated with checkpoint functions (cell-cycle arrest and transcriptional induction) and was cell-cycle stage- and progression-independent. In asynchronous cultures, Rad 9 hyperphosphorylation was dependent on MEC 1 and TEL 1, homologues of the ATR and <b>ATM</b> <b>genes.</b> In G 1 -arrested cells, damage-dependent hyperphosphorylation required functional MEC 1 in addition to RAD 17, RAD 24, MEC 3 and DDC 1, demonstrating cell-cycle stage specificity of the {{checkpoint gene}}s in this response to DNA damage.

The cultivation was showed to have high success rate (96 %; 375 / 391) with also high rate of detection of pathological clones by both karyotype and metaphase FISH analyses (in 84 % of samples; 329 / 391). Almost in half of samples (44 %; 171 / 391) other aberrations than recurrent FISH (i. e. 13 q 14 deletion, trisomy 12, TP 53, <b>ATM</b> <b>genes</b> deletions) were found.

Additional atm 3 alleles were identified among sirtinol-resistant lines, correlating with decreased activities of aldehyde oxidases, cytosolic enzymes that convert sirtinol into an auxin analog, and depend on iron-sulfur (Fe-S) and molybdenum cofactor (Moco) as prosthetic groups. In the sirtinol-resistant atm 3 - 3 allele, the highly conserved arginine- 612 {{is replaced by a}} lysine residue, the negative effect of which could be mimicked in the yeast Atm 1 p ortholog. Arabidopsis atm 3 mutants displayed defects in root growth, chlorophyll content, and seedling establishment.

Nitrate reductase activity (Moco, heme) was decreased by 50 % in the strong atm 3 alleles, but catalase activity (heme) was {{similar to that of the}} wild type. Strikingly, in contrast to mutants in the yeast and mammalian orthologs, Arabidopsis atm 3 mutants did not display a dramatic iron homeostasis defect and did not accumulate iron in mitochondria.
