5|$|To {{complete}} her {{contract with}} Paramount Pictures, Wong made {{a string of}} B movies in the late 1930s. Often dismissed by critics, the films gave Wong non-stereotypical roles which were publicized in the Chinese-American press for their positive images. These smaller-budgeted films could be bolder than the higher-profile releases and Wong used this to her advantage to portray successful, professional, Chinese-American characters. Competent <b>and</b> <b>proud</b> <b>of</b> their Chinese heritage, these roles worked against the prevailing U.S. film portrayals of Chinese Americans. In contrast to the usual official Chinese condemnation of Wong's film roles, the Chinese consul to Los Angeles gave his approval to the final scripts of two of these films, Daughter of Shanghai (1937) and King of Chinatown (1939).|$|E

Artemis asked Nemesis for help to avenge her dignity and caused the rape of Aura by Dionysus. Aura became a mad and dangerous killer.

25|$|The Pandavas, who {{had ruled}} their kingdom meanwhile, decide to renounce everything. Clad in skins and rags they retire to the Himalaya and climb towards heaven in their bodily form. A stray dog travels with them. One {{by one the}} {{brothers}} and Draupadi fall on their way. As each one stumbles, Yudhishthira gives the rest the reason for their fall (Draupadi was partial to Arjuna, Nakula and Sahadeva were vain <b>and</b> <b>proud</b> <b>of</b> their looks, and Bhima and Arjuna were proud of their strength and archery skills, respectively). Only the virtuous Yudhishthira, who had tried everything to prevent the carnage, and the dog remain. The dog reveals himself to be the god Yama (also known as Yama Dharmaraja), and then takes him to the underworld where he sees his siblings and wife. After explaining {{the nature of the}} test, Yama takes Yudhishthira back to heaven and explains that it was necessary to expose him to the underworld because (Rajyante narakam dhruvam) any ruler has to visit the underworld at least once. Yama then assures him that his siblings and wife would join him in heaven after they had been exposed to the underworld for measures of time according to their vices.|$|E

Robert Bianco of the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette wrote that [...] " [...] outwits his parents and outtalks his teachers; in short, he's the child we wish we'd been, and fear our children will become." [...] In schools, educators claimed that Bart was a [...] "threat to learning" [...] because of his [...] "underachiever <b>and</b> <b>proud</b> <b>of</b> it" [...] attitude and negative attitude regarding his education.

500|$|In April 1966, he was {{assigned}} to the United Kingdom for further training; over 9 months he underwent an English-language course at Beaconsfield, Buckinghamshire, an Army Air Corps signal instructors course in Bovington Camp, Dorset, and an infantry signal instructors course at Hythe, Kent. Despite later rumours to the contrary, he did not attend the Royal Military Academy Sandhurst. The Bovington signal course's director reported that Gaddafi successfully overcame problems learning English, displaying a firm command of voice procedure. Noting that Gaddafi's favourite hobbies were reading and playing football, he thought him an [...] "amusing officer, always cheerful, hard-working, and conscientious." [...] Gaddafi disliked England, claiming British Army officers racially insulted him and finding it difficult adjusting to the country's culture; asserting his Arab identity in London, he walked around Piccadilly wearing traditional Libyan robes.

500|$|After {{completing}} the album Hu Hu Hu (2009) Lafourcade experienced writer's block, {{and felt that}} the songs she was writing were too {{similar to those in}} her previous albums. For her new work, she sought inspiration from Agustín Lara's repertoire and her native country, Mexico. [...] "One of the things I wanted to happen with this record was to find the connection with Mexico and its people again". She said she was a Mexican <b>and</b> <b>proud</b> <b>of</b> the [...] "very many" [...] positive parts it has. Musically, she wanted more simplicity in her songs. Lafourcade forced herself to write [...] "without judgement", recording voice memos on her phone as part of the writing process. She was inspired by the works of Latin American songwriters such as Simón Díaz, Violeta Parra, Mercedes Sosa, Chavela Vargas, and Caetano Veloso. While recording demos, Lafourcade realized that the songs were more direct and emotional than her previous work. The writing took three years, resulting in approximately 30songs. Since the album was about her personal life, she selected what she felt were [...] "the strongest ones", saying, [...] "more than making an album, I wanted to have songs... that could stand on their own".|$|E

500|$|Bart's rebellious, bad boy nature, which {{underlies}} his misbehavior {{and rarely}} leads to any punishment, led some parents and conservatives to characterize {{him as a}} poor role model for children.

500|$|The {{band members}} are {{described}} by an Afrisson reviewer as [...] "intellectual", and their lyrics are often politically charged and advocate for rebuilding {{the country and}} Malagasy society and culture. The lyrics of Mahaleo's earlier songs in particular promoted the values of Marxism, reflecting the popularity of socialist philosophies as the best alternative to neocolonialism in Africa and other regions freeing themselves from the control of Europe; the group also commonly explored the themes of conflict, the political demands of the people, love, friendship and death. According to music producer Hannes Lämmler, [...] "These simple themes moved the Malagasy people, because they express the deepest aspirations of a people {{in search of an}} identity... with , the truth was affirmed {{that it is possible to}} be Malagasy <b>and</b> <b>proud</b> <b>of</b> it." [...] Over time, the themes explored in the songs of Mahaleo expanded to include social problems like criminality, environmental destruction and other contemporary social and political issues. Nearly all their songs reflect the ancestral value of fihavanana (kinship, solidarity) that forms the foundation of traditional Malagasy society. Unlike most bands, Mahaleo avoids prescribing particular solutions to each problem they address, preferring to draw upon the local traditions of hainteny and ohabolana (Malagasy poetry and proverbs) in order to inspire their listeners to reflect and draw their own conclusions.|$|E

500|$|Borscht is {{associated}} with and claimed by several ethnic groups, especially Ukrainians, Russians, Poles, Lithuanians and Ashkenazi Jews, as their own national or ethnic dish and cultural icon. Such claims are not necessarily mutually exclusive, as the soup's history predates the emergence in Eastern Europe of modern nation states with their ever-shifting borders. Borscht, {{in the words of}} Burlakoff, [...] "is perfectly suited to a global culture." [...] He describes it as [...] "a global phenomenon", in which [...] "local variants are so numerous and diverse that it is hard sometimes for a non-specialist to grasp that any single example of it is something that is part of a unified tradition." [...] In his view, borscht [...] "is an almost perfect example of... 'glocalization' – a phenomenon that is global in distribution but reflective of local needs and ways in its variants and adaptation;... a highly localized product that became globalized, and in the process adapted to conditions other than the original ones." [...] However, according to Irina Perianova, a Russian linguist and anthropologist, [...] "people tend to be very proprietal about their food <b>and</b> <b>proud</b> <b>of</b> it." [...] Perianova offers competing Russian and Ukrainian views on the origin and ingredients of borscht as an example of [...] "a common connection between culinary and territorial claims", which results in the culinary area turning into [...] "a battlefield generating and proliferating all kinds of myths." ...|$|E
500|$|On 21 March 1816, {{at the age}} {{of seven}} years, Mendelssohn was baptised with his brother and sisters in a home {{ceremony}} by Johann Jakob Stegemann, minister of the Evangelical congregation of Berlin's Jerusalem Church and New Church. Although Mendelssohn was a conforming Christian {{as a member of the}} Reformed Church, he was both conscious <b>and</b> <b>proud</b> <b>of</b> his Jewish ancestry and notably of his connection with his grandfather Moses Mendelssohn. He was the prime mover in proposing to the publisher Heinrich Brockhaus a complete edition of Moses's works, which continued with the support of his uncle Joseph Mendelssohn. Mendelssohn was notably reluctant, either in his letters or conversation, to comment on his innermost beliefs; his friend Devrient wrote that [...] " [...] deep convictions were never uttered in intercourse with the world; only in rare and intimate moments did they ever appear, and then only in the slightest and most humorous allusions". Thus for example in a letter to his sister Rebecka, Mendelssohn rebukes her complaint about an unpleasant relative: [...] "What do you mean by saying you are not hostile to Jews? I hope this was a joke It is really sweet of you that you do not despise your family, isn't it?" [...] Some modern scholars have devoted considerable energy to demonstrate either that Mendelssohn was deeply sympathetic to his ancestors' Jewish beliefs, or that he was hostile to this and sincere in his Christian beliefs.|$|E
500|$|Bart's rebellious {{attitude}} {{has made him}} a disruptive student at Springfield Elementary School, where Bart is an underachiever <b>and</b> <b>proud</b> <b>of</b> it. He is constantly at odds with his teacher Ms. Krabappel, Principal Skinner, and occasionally Groundskeeper Willie. Bart does poorly in school and is well aware of it, having once declared, [...] "I am dumb, okay? Dumb as a post! Think I'm happy about it?" [...] On one occasion, Lisa successfully proves that Bart is dumber than a hamster, although Bart ultimately outsmarts her in the end. In [...] "Separate Vocations" [...] (season three, 1992) Bart becomes hall monitor and his grades go up, suggesting that he struggles mainly because he does not pay attention, not because he is stupid. This idea is reinforced in [...] "Brother's Little Helper", (season eleven, 1999) in which it is revealed that Bart suffers from attention deficit disorder. His lack of smarts can also be attributed to the hereditary [...] "Simpson Gene", which affects the intelligence of most male members of the Simpson family. Although he gets into endless trouble and can be sadistic, shallow and selfish, Bart also exhibits many qualities of high integrity. He has, on a few occasions, helped Principal Skinner and Mrs. Krabappel: In [...] "Sweet Seymour Skinner's Baadasssss Song" [...] (season five, 1994), Bart accidentally got Skinner fired and befriended him outside the school environment. Bart missed having Skinner as an adversary and got him rehired, knowing that this would mean that the two could no longer be friends.|$|E
