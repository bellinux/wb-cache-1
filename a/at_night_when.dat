5|$|Afternoon winds usually {{die down}} in the evening, {{prompting}} behavioral modifications in the herd. The deer avoid the dry wind by being more active <b>at</b> <b>night</b> <b>when</b> the wind is not blowing. In 1991 there was a three-year average of 420 mule deer.|$|E
5|$|In later {{versions}} of the myth, the intoxicant smearing on Putana's breast is replaced with poison or the milk itself {{is said to be}} poisoned. Another version of the tale portrays Putana as stealing Krishna <b>at</b> <b>night,</b> <b>when</b> everyone else is asleep.|$|E
5|$|After {{incubating}} {{for around}} 80 days, hatchlings dig through the sand to the surface, usually <b>at</b> <b>night,</b> <b>when</b> darkness increases {{the chance of}} escaping predation and damage from extreme sand surface temperatures is reduced. Hatchlings enter the ocean by navigating toward the brighter horizon created by {{the reflection of the}} moon and starlight off the water's surface.|$|E

Here, in different departments, she can give free rein to her imagination, living wonderful adventures with her friends. During day, Sofia's life is the normal girl's life, she goes to school and has several good friends, she has formed a musical group with them.|$|R
5|$|Kulintang {{music is}} {{prohibited}} from being played inside mosques and during Islamic rites/observances/holidays, {{such as the}} fasting month of Ramadan, where playing is only allowed <b>at</b> <b>night</b> <b>when</b> people are allowed to eat after Iftar. It is also prohibited during the mourning period {{of the death of}} important person, during funerals, and during the peak times of the planting and harvest season.|$|E
5|$|The Muslims found {{themselves}} in greater difficulties by day. Food was running short, and nights were colder. The lack of sleep made matters worse. So tense was the situation that, for the first time, the canonical daily prayers were neglected by the Muslim community. Only <b>at</b> <b>night,</b> <b>when</b> the attacks stopped due to darkness, could they resume their regular worship. According to Ibn Ishaq, the situation became serious and fear was everywhere.|$|E
5|$|After the Aleutian Islands Campaign, a refit was {{undertaken}} at the Puget Sound Navy Yard. On 25 October, New Mexico returned to Pearl Harbor to {{practice for the}} invasion of the Gilbert Islands. On 20 November, while the invasion was under way, she shelled Makin Atoll. During the fighting on the islands the ship was tasked with guarding transports <b>at</b> <b>night</b> <b>when</b> they retreated from the islands, providing anti-aircraft fire for the unloading of supplies and troops, and providing screening fire for the aircraft carriers. After U.S. troops captured the Gilbert Islands on 5 December, New Mexico returned to Pearl Harbor.|$|E
50|$|El Sombrerón {{appears at}} dusk, {{dragging}} along {{a group of}} mules carrying coal, with whom he travels around {{the city and its}} neighborhoods. When a woman responds to his love, he ties the mules to the house's pole where she lives, unhooks his guitar and starts singing and dancing. Some residents from the neighborhoods of La Recolección and Parroquia Vieja say he still wanders <b>at</b> <b>nights</b> <b>when</b> there is a full moon.|$|R

50|$|Most species {{spend their}} day burrowed {{underground}} or under vegetation, surfacing only <b>at</b> <b>night</b> or <b>when</b> it rains. Some species are arboreal {{and are often}} seen hiding in bromeliads in trees.|$|R
5|$|Alan Kotok {{was born}} in 1941 in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, and was raised as an only child in Vineland, New Jersey. During his childhood, he played with tools in his father's {{hardware}} store and learned model railroading. He was a precocious child, skipping two grades at high school, and he matriculated at Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) aged 16. Although his interest in computers began at Vineland High School, his first practical experience of computing came at MIT; there he developed a habit of working late <b>at</b> <b>night</b> <b>when</b> more computer time was available.|$|E
5|$|Despite American counterattacks, the North Koreans {{were able}} to {{continue}} pressing forward and take Cloverleaf Hill and Oblong-ni Ridge, critical terrain astride the main road in the bulge area. By August 10 the entire NK 4th Division was across the river and beginning to move south, outflanking the American lines. The next day, scattered elements of the North Korean forces attacked Yongsan. The North Korean forces repeatedly attacked US lines <b>at</b> <b>night,</b> <b>when</b> American soldiers were resting and had greater difficulty resisting.|$|E
5|$|Like regular {{characters}} in Fortress mode, characters have thirst, hunger and exhaustion levels. To survive, they must eat, drink and sleep. They {{need to take}} shelter <b>at</b> <b>night</b> <b>when</b> evil creatures like bogeymen come out. In addition to the regular combat mechanism, in this mode, the player can also choose which body parts to strike. A player can visit their retired or ruined fortresses made in Fortress mode. Instead of quitting, the character can be retired, and depending on the player's achievements, their life events will be documented in the Legends mode among the historical figures.|$|E
50|$|Bruce Mowday, a Chester County {{reporter}} {{who covered the}} Johnstons' trials for the West Chester (Pa.) Daily Local News, wrote Jailing the Johnston Gang: Bringing Serial Murders to Justice in 2009. It is published by Barricade Books.I spent {{more than two years}} of my professional life trailing the investigative team from courtroom to courtroom and to several counties in Pennsylvania following the legal proceedings. I was out <b>at</b> <b>nights</b> <b>when</b> the bodies of the Johnstons' murder victims were unearthed. My most memorable days as a reporter were during the reporting of these murder cases.|$|R

He has a bee in his bonnet about booming the piece. Sits up <b>at</b> <b>nights,</b> <b>when</b> {{he ought to be}} sleeping or studying his part, thinking out new schemes for advertising the show. And the comedian. His speciality is drawing me aside and asking me to write in new scenes for him. I couldn't stand it any longer. I just came away and left them to fight it out among themselves.' ...|$|R
5|$|Operating {{through a}} cell structure, MK planned {{to carry out}} acts of {{sabotage}} that would exert maximum pressure on the government with minimum casualties; they sought to bomb military installations, power plants, telephone lines, and transport links <b>at</b> <b>night,</b> <b>when</b> civilians were not present. Mandela stated that they chose sabotage {{because it was the}} least harmful action, did not involve killing, and offered the best hope for racial reconciliation afterwards; he nevertheless acknowledged that should this have failed then guerrilla warfare might have been necessary. Soon after ANC leader Luthuli was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize, MK publicly announced its existence with 57 bombings on Dingane's Day (16 December) 1961, followed by further attacks on New Year's Eve.|$|E
5|$|The shock {{generated}} by the Pacific electric ray can be enough to knock down an adult human. It should be treated with caution, especially <b>at</b> <b>night</b> <b>when</b> it is active, and {{has been known to}} charge at divers with its mouth agape if harassed. It is not known to be responsible for any fatalities, but may have been involved in several unexplained, fatal diving accidents. This species fares poorly in captivity, as it usually refuses to feed when first introduced into an aquarium. Since 2000, the Aquarium of the Bay and the Monterey Bay Aquarium have had some success keeping Pacific electric rays by offering them moving food.|$|E
5|$|With {{a sizable}} oily liver and low-density tissues, the Pacific {{electric}} ray is almost neutrally buoyant and can hover {{in the water}} column with very little effort. Propulsive power is provided by the muscular tail, while the disc is held rigid. Telemetry studies have shown that this species swims primarily <b>at</b> <b>night,</b> <b>when</b> it enters reefs and other habitats with high terrain relief, and spends most of the day in nearby open areas buried in sediment. It is nomadic and solitary, though several individuals may rest within the same area.|$|E
60|$|<b>At</b> <b>nights,</b> <b>when</b> we encamped near to a {{river or}} pool of water, we saw immense numbers of {{elephants}} {{come down to}} drink and enjoy themselves. They seemed, in fact, to be intoxicated with delight, if not with water; for they screamed with joy, and filling their trunks with water, spurted it over themselves and each other in copious showers. Of course, we never disturbed them on such occasions, for {{we came to the}} conclusion that it would be the height of barbarity and selfishness to spoil the pleasure of so many creatures merely for the sake of a shot.|$|R
60|$|Jim {{carried a}} heavy ten-bore gun {{and his feet}} sank in the mud as he crept quietly up the hollow. He liked this rough {{shooting}}, and now and then Jake and he went out <b>at</b> <b>nights.</b> <b>When</b> one had hunted fierce game in Canada, shooting driven pheasants was tame sport, and the beaters found the birds; but on the sands one must match one's intelligence against the instinctive cunning of the ducks and geese. Besides, there was some risk that gave the thing a spice. Belts of sand were dangerously soft and the tides were treacherous. Sometimes they rose faster than one reckoned.|$|R
50|$|This fish {{grows up}} to 18 cm (c. 7 in) long, and may live {{for up to}} 20 years. <b>When</b> {{observed}} <b>at</b> <b>night</b> or <b>when</b> frightened, this species changes color; the dorsal portion of the body turns black except for two white patches.|$|R
5|$|A {{wind energy}} {{penetration}} figure {{can be specified}} for different duration of time, but is often quoted annually. To obtain 100% from wind annually requires substantial long term storage or substantial interconnection to other systems which may already have substantial storage. On a monthly, weekly, daily, or hourly basis—or less—wind might supply as much as or more than 100% of current use, with the rest stored or exported. Seasonal industry might then take advantage of high wind and low usage times such as <b>at</b> <b>night</b> <b>when</b> wind output can exceed normal demand. Such industry might include production of silicon, aluminum, steel, or of natural gas, and hydrogen, and using future long term storage to facilitate 100% energy from variable renewable energy. Homes can also be programmed to accept extra electric power on demand, for example by remotely turning up water heater thermostats.|$|E
5|$|Electric power {{generated}} from wind {{power can be}} highly variable at several different timescales: hourly, daily, or seasonally. Annual variation also exists, but is not as significant. Because instantaneous electrical generation and consumption must remain in balance to maintain grid stability, this variability can present substantial challenges to incorporating large amounts of wind power into a grid system. Intermittency and the non-dispatchable nature of wind energy production can raise costs for regulation, incremental operating reserve, and (at high penetration levels) could require {{an increase in the}} already existing energy demand management, load shedding, storage solutions or system interconnection with HVDC cables. The variability of wind is quite different from solar, wind may be producing power <b>at</b> <b>night</b> <b>when</b> other baseload plants are often overproducing.|$|E
5|$|Pilot whales {{generally}} {{take several}} breaths before diving {{for a few}} minutes. Feeding dives may last over ten minutes. They are capable of diving to depths of 600 meters, but most dives are {{to a depth of}} 30–60 m. Shallow dives tend to take place during the day, while deeper ones take place <b>at</b> <b>night.</b> <b>When</b> making deep dives, pilot whales often make fast sprints to catch fast-moving prey such as squid. Compared to sperm whales and beaked whales, foraging short-finned pilot whales are more energetic at the same depth. When they reach the end of their dives, pilot whales will sprint, possibly to catch prey, and then make a few buzzes. This is unusual considering deep-diving, breath-holding animals would be expected to swim slowly to conserve oxygen. The animal's high metabolism possibly allows it to sprint at deep depths, which would also give it shorter diving periods than some other marine mammals. This may also be the case for long-finned pilot whales.|$|E

50|$|Soon after hatching, the {{caterpillar}} {{does not}} consume the eggshell completely {{and it makes}} itself a spacious cell and hides inside it. The caterpillar is sluggish and comes out to feed only <b>at</b> <b>night.</b> Even <b>when</b> disturbed it is reluctant to leave its cell.|$|R
50|$|Some solar {{chargers}} {{also have an}} on-board battery which is charged by the solar panel when not charging anything else. This allows the user {{to be able to}} use the solar energy stored in the battery to charge their electronic devices <b>at</b> <b>night</b> or <b>when</b> indoors.|$|R
5|$|The 4th North Korean Division, meanwhile, had {{constructed}} underwater bridges of sandbags, logs, and rocks, finishing {{the first on}} August 10. 4th Division used it to move trucks and heavy artillery as well as additional infantry and a few tanks across the river. By the morning of August 10, an estimated two KPA regiments were across the river and occupying fortified positions. Supplies continued to stream in through rafts. Task Force Hill mounted its attack, but was once again unable to make progress due to the newly established artillery. Its directive to attack quickly became one to dig in and hold its ground, and by nightfall the entire 4th North Korean Division was across the river. On August 10, elements of 4th North Korean began to move south, outflanking Task Force Hill. The next day, scattered North Korean elements attacked Yongsan. KPA repeatedly attacked <b>at</b> <b>night,</b> <b>when</b> American soldiers were resting and had greater difficulty resisting.|$|E
5|$|The ice-cutting {{involved}} several {{stages and}} was typically carried out <b>at</b> <b>night,</b> <b>when</b> the ice was thickest. First the surface would be cleaned of snow with scrapers, {{the depth of}} the ice tested for suitability, then the surface would be marked out with cutters to produce the lines of the future ice blocks. The size of the blocks varied according to the destination, the largest being for the furthest locations, the smallest destined for the American east coast itself and being only 22inches (0.56 m) square. The blocks could finally be cut out of the ice and floated to the shore. The speed of the operation might depend on the likelihood of warmer weather impacting on the ice. In both New England and Norway, harvesting occurred during an otherwise quiet season, providing valuable local employment.|$|E

Wade then plays the first verse and first chorus in the waiting area of the L. A. Union Station. As the band plays the second verse, they are shown playing at the rooftop with Iron Mountain clearly visible. When the chorus plays again, they are shown at the roof with lights from the {{buildings}} of Downtown Los Angeles <b>at</b> <b>night.</b> <b>When</b> Wade sings the bridge, he is {{on the roof of the}} Roosevelt Hotel in Hollywood Boulevard. The man and the woman are also seen running in the boarding area of the Los Angeles Union Station.
