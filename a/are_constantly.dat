5|$|A {{woman who}} has {{elevated}} blood lead levels during pregnancy is {{at greater risk of}} a prematurely birth or with a low birth weight. Children are more at risk for lead poisoning because their smaller bodies are in a continuous state of growth and development. Lead is absorbed at a faster rate compared to adults, which causes more physical harm than to older people. Furthermore, children, especially as they are learning to crawl and walk, <b>are</b> <b>constantly</b> on the floor and therefore more prone to ingesting and inhaling dust that is contaminated with lead.|$|E
5|$|In an animal, cells <b>are</b> <b>constantly</b> dying. A {{balance between}} cell {{division}} and cell death keeps {{the number of}} cells relatively constant in adults. There are two different ways a cell can die: by necrosis or by apoptosis. In contrast to necrosis, which often results from disease or trauma, apoptosis—or programmed cell death—is a normal healthy function of cells. The body has to rid itself of millions of dead or dying cells every day, and phagocytes {{play a crucial role}} in this process.|$|E
5|$|Objects from Puerto Rico <b>are</b> <b>constantly</b> {{featured}} in specialized magazines, in both {{national and international}} distribution. The Puerto Rican dollars that were collected by the government, were burned between January 16–24, 1925, drastically {{reducing the amount of}} surviving notes from the Bank of Puerto Rico. The Great Depression reduced their numbers further, since necessity prevented the collection of pesos in large denominations. Thus less than five exemplars are known to exist of the 100 and 200 peso banknotes issued by El Banco Español de Puerto Rico and the 5 and 10 dollars Series F bills published by the Bank of Puerto Rico.|$|E

5|$|Presque Isle is a recurved, sand spit {{that formed}} {{during the last}} glacial period, or ice age, when the Laurentide Ice Sheet {{advanced}} into the basin now occupied by Lake Erie, and, when it retreated to the north between 12,370BC and 12,790BC, left behind a moraine consisting of clay, sand, and gravel that initially formed the Presque Isle peninsula. The deposits <b>are</b> <b>constantly</b> being re-worked by wave action and are gradually migrating to the northeast due to longshore drift.|$|E
5|$|Shark {{teeth are}} {{embedded}} in the gums rather than directly affixed to the jaw, and <b>are</b> <b>constantly</b> replaced throughout life. Multiple rows of replacement teeth grow in a groove {{on the inside of}} the jaw and steadily move forward in comparison to a conveyor belt; some sharks lose 30,000 or more teeth in their lifetime. The rate of tooth replacement varies from once every 8 to 10 days to several months. In most species, teeth are replaced one at a time as opposed to the simultaneous replacement of an entire row, which is observed in the cookiecutter shark.|$|E
5|$|Tennyson is not {{the only}} one that uses the image; John Everett Millais's {{painting}} Mariana is based on Tennyson's version of Mariana, and lines 9 through 12 of Tennyson's poem were used for the catalogue description of the painting. Similarly, Millais's version served as the inspiration for Elizabeth Gaskell's novel, Mariana. Tennyson's Mariana and Gaskell's main character, Ruth, are sensitive to the sounds around them and <b>are</b> <b>constantly</b> looking out of their window in image that represents their imprisonment within their homes. The image of Mariana used by Tennyson and the later works are equally of a woman who is weary.|$|E

5|$|The {{autonomous}} navigation of the Air-Cobot robot is in two phases. The first, navigation in {{the airport}} or the factory, allows the robot to move close to the aircraft. The second navigation, around the aircraft, allows the robot to position itself at control points referenced in the aircraft virtual model. In addition, the robot must insert itself in a dynamic environment where humans and vehicles are moving. To address this problem, it has an obstacle avoidance module. Many navigation algorithms <b>are</b> <b>constantly</b> running on the robot with real time constraints. Searches are conducted on optimizing the computing time.|$|E
5|$|Adult giant otters {{living in}} family groups have no known serious natural predators, however {{there are some}} {{accounts}} of black caimans in Peru and yacare caimans in the Pantanal preying on giant otters. In addition, solitary animals and young may be vulnerable to attacks by the jaguar, cougar, and anaconda, but {{this is based on}} historical reports, not direct observation. Pups are more vulnerable, and may be taken by caiman and other large predators, although adults <b>are</b> <b>constantly</b> mindful of stray young, and will harass and fight off possible predators. When in the water, the giant otter faces danger from animals not strictly preying upon it: the electric eel and stingray are potentially deadly if stumbled upon, and piranha may be capable of at least taking bites out of a giant otter, as evidenced by scarring on individuals.|$|E
5|$|Although {{there are}} many diverse pathogens, many of which <b>are</b> <b>constantly</b> mutating, it is a {{surprise}} {{that a majority of}} individuals remain free of infections. Thus, maintenance of health requires the body to recognize all pathogens (antigens they present or produce) likely to exist. This is achieved by maintaining a pool of immensely large (about 109) clones of B cells, each of which reacts against a specific epitope by recognizing and producing antibodies against it. However, at any given time very few clones actually remain receptive to their specific epitope. Thus, approximately 107 different epitopes can be recognized by all the B cell clones combined. Moreover, in a lifetime, an individual usually requires the generation of antibodies against very few antigens in comparison with the number that the body can recognize and respond against.|$|E

5|$|Arsène Lupin III, the {{grandson}} of the fictional gentleman thief, Arsène Lupin, is considered the world's greatest thief, known for announcing his intentions to steal valuable objects by sending a calling card to the owners of his desired items. His right-hand man and closest ally is Daisuke Jigen, an expert marksman who can accurately shoot a target in 0.3 seconds. Although Lupin and Jigen frequently work as a two-man team, they are often joined by Goemon Ishikawa XIII, a master swordsman whose sword can cut anything, or Fujiko Mine, a femme fatale and Lupin's love interest. Although Fujiko usually works together with the others, she occasionally exploits Lupin's interest in her to steal the treasure for herself. Lupin and his gang <b>are</b> <b>constantly</b> chased by Inspector Koichi Zenigata of the ICPO, who has made it his life's work to arrest them, pursuing Lupin across the globe.|$|E
5|$|As {{described}} by quantum chromodynamics, {{the strong interaction between}} quarks is mediated by gluons, massless vector gauge bosons. Each gluon carries one color charge and one anticolor charge. In the standard framework of particle interactions (part {{of a more}} general formulation known as perturbation theory), gluons <b>are</b> <b>constantly</b> exchanged between quarks through a virtual emission and absorption process. When a gluon is transferred between quarks, a color change occurs in both; for example, if a red quark emits a red–antigreen gluon, it becomes green, and if a green quark absorbs a red–antigreen gluon, it becomes red. Therefore, while each quark's color constantly changes, their strong interaction is preserved.|$|E
5|$|As the environments of most organisms <b>are</b> <b>constantly</b> changing, the {{reactions}} of metabolism must be finely regulated to maintain a constant set of conditions within cells, a condition called homeostasis. Metabolic regulation also allows organisms to respond to signals and interact actively with their environments. Two closely linked concepts are important for understanding how metabolic pathways are controlled. Firstly, the regulation of an enzyme in a pathway is how its activity is increased and decreased in response to signals. Secondly, the control exerted by this enzyme is the effect that these changes in its activity have on the overall rate of the pathway (the flux through the pathway). For example, an enzyme may show large changes in activity (i.e. it is highly regulated) but if these changes have {{little effect on the}} flux of a metabolic pathway, then this enzyme is not involved in the control of the pathway.|$|E

5|$|In 2008, Gorrostieta Salazar {{was elected}} mayor of Tiquicheo. Several drug {{trafficking}} organizations, particularly the La Familia Michoacana and the Knights Templar Cartel, {{are based in}} the area. Michoacán is a leading producer of marijuana and opium poppy, making it a lucrative route for smugglers taking narcotics into the United States. Despite receiving threats, Gorrostieta Salazar publicly denounced the activities of these groups. The drug cartels, which <b>are</b> <b>constantly</b> fighting each other for territorial control, often target mayors who confront them. Other mayors, however, are corrupted and bribed by the cartels. Mexico has more than 2,500 municipalities, {{many of which are}} far from the capital cities and lack amenities available {{in other parts of the}} country. Many of these areas are plagued with drug-related violence, so the political parties have faced difficulties finding people interested in holding the post of mayor.|$|E
5|$|Much like elephants, {{manatees}} are polyphyodonts, and continuously replace {{their teeth}} {{from the back}} of the jaw. Adults lack incisors, canines, and premolars, and instead have 8 to 10 cheek teeth in their mouth. Manatees have an infinite supply of teeth moving in from the back and shedding in the front, which are continuously formed by a dental capsule behind the tooth-row. These teeth <b>are</b> <b>constantly</b> worn down by the abrasive vascular plants they forage, particularly aquatic grasses. Unlike in manatees, the dugong's teeth do not continually grow back via horizontal tooth replacement. The dugong has two tusks which emerge in males during puberty, and sometime later in life for females after reaching the base of the premaxilla. The number of growth layer groups in a tusk indicates the age of a dugong.|$|E
5|$|The Hamsa mendicants <b>are</b> <b>constantly</b> on the move, {{staying in}} villages {{for just one}} night, in towns {{no more than five}} nights, and in sacred places for no more than seven nights. The ascetic {{practice}} of Hamsa monks includes daily consumption of the urine and dung of a cow. The Hamsa monks practice the Chandrayana cycle in their food eating habit, wherein they vary the amount of food they eat with the lunar cycle. They eat a single mouthful of food on the day after the dark new moon night, increase their food intake by an extra mouthful each day as the size of the moon increases, and reach the maximum fifteen mouthfuls of food for the day after full moon night. Thereafter, they decrease their food intake by a mouthful each day until they reach the new moon night and begin the cycle again with one mouthful the following day.|$|E
