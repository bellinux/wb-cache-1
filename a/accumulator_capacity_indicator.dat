This paper presents our {{study of a}} regenerative hydraulic shock absorber system which converts the oscillatory motion of a vehicle suspension into unidirectional rotary motion of a generator. Firstly a model which {{takes into account the}} influences of the dynamics of hydraulic flow, rotational motion and power regeneration is developed. Thereafter the model parameters of fluid bulk modulus, motor efficiencies, viscous friction torque, and voltage and torque constant coefficients are determined based on modelling and experimental studies of a prototype system. The model is then validated under different input excitations and load resistances, obtaining results which show good agreement between prediction and measurement. In particular, the system using piston-rod dimensions of 50 – 30 mm achieves recoverable power of 260 W with an efficiency of around 40 % under sinusoidal excitation of 1 Hz frequency and 25 mm amplitude when the <b>accumulator</b> <b>capacity</b> is set to 0. 32 L with the load resistance 20 Ω. It is then shown that the appropriate damping characteristics required from a shock absorber in a heavy-haulage vehicle can be met by using variable load resistances and <b>accumulator</b> <b>capacities</b> in a device akin to the prototype. The validated model paves the way for further system optimisation towards maximising the performance of regeneration, ride comfort and handling...|$|R

In this study, we examined variation in body size, functional capacities and motivation for achievement, competitiveness and deliberate practice of youth basketball players associated with differences in biological maturity status and chronological age. Reflecting the importance of interactive effects, we examined the relationships between the psychological variables and functional capacities. Fifty-eight male basketball players aged 9. 5 to 15. 5 years were considered. Variables included chronological age, estimated age at PHV, stature, body mass and sitting height by anthropometry; the Work and Family Orientation and Deliberate Practice Motivation Questionnaires were also used. Finally, the Line Drill test and Yo-Yo Intermittent Recovery level 1 (Yo-Yo IR 1) tests were used as functional <b>capacities</b> <b>indicators</b> for basketball. Variance components models derived from series of multilevel linear regression models revealed a significant variation by maturity status for body size, functional <b>capacities</b> <b>indicators,</b> mastery and will to excel. The influence of estimated maturity status on mastery and will to excel was independent of chronological age. Furthermore, after controlling for age, an influence of estimated maturity on competitiveness was apparent.

40|$|Sustainability is {{commonly}} assessed along environmental, societal, economic and technological dimensions. A crucial aspect of sustainability is that inter-generational equality must be ensured. This requires that sustainability is attained {{in the here}} and now as well as into the future. Therefore, what is perceived as ‘sustainable’ changes as a function of societal opinion and technological and scientific progress. A concept that describes the ability of systems to change is adaptive capacity. Literature suggests that the ability of systems to adapt is an integral part of sustainable development. This paper demonstrates that <b>indicators</b> measuring adaptive <b>capacity</b> are underrepresented in current urban water sustainability studies. Furthermore, it is discussed under which sustainability dimensions adaptive <b>capacity</b> <b>indicators</b> are lacking and why. Of the > 90 indicators analysed, only nine are adaptive <b>capacity</b> <b>indicators,</b> of which six are socio-cultural, two technological, one economical and none environmental. This infrequent use of adaptive <b>capacity</b> <b>indicators</b> in sustainability assessments led to the conclusion that the challenge of dynamic and uncertain urban water systems is, with the exception of the socio-cultural dimension, not yet sufficiently reflected in the application of urban water sustainability indicators. This raises concerns about the progress towards urban water systems that can transform as a response variation and change. Therefore, research should focus on developing methods and indicators that can define, evaluate and quantify adaptive capacity under the economic, environmental and technical dimension of sustainability. Furthermore, it should be evaluated whether sustainability frameworks that focus on the control processes of urban water systems are more suitable for measuring adaptive capacity, than the assessments along environmental, economic, socio-cultural and technological dimensions. </p...|$|R

Understanding the {{factors that contribute to}} the global food system’s ability to respond and adapt to such disruptions (i. e. resilience) is critical for understanding the long-term sustainability of human populations. Variable impacts of production shocks on food supply between countries indicate a need for national-scale resilience indicators that can provide global comparisons. However, methods for tracking changes in resilience have had limited application to food systems. We developed an indicator-based analysis of food systems resilience for the years 1992 - 2011. Our approach is based on three dimensions of resilience: socio-economic access to food in terms of income of the poorest quintile relative to food prices, biophysical capacity to intensify or extensify food production, and the magnitude and diversity of current domestic food production. The socio-economic indicator has large variability, but with low values concentrated in Africa and Asia. The biophysical <b>capacity</b> <b>indicator</b> is highest in Africa and Eastern Europe, in part because of high potential for extensification of cropland and for yield gap closure in cultivated areas. However, the biophysical <b>capacity</b> <b>indicator</b> has declined globally in recent years. The production diversity indicator has increased slightly, with a relatively even geographic distribution. Few countries had exclusively high or low values for all indicators. Collectively, these results are the basis for global comparisons of resilience between nations, and provide necessary context for developing generalizations about the resilience in the global food system...|$|R

This trial concerns India's approach to addressing an increase in malaria-attributable deaths by training community health workers to diagnose, treat and prevent malaria, while using LQAS to monitor sub-district performance and make programme improvements. METHODS The Ministry of Health introduced LQAS into four matched high malaria burden districts (Annual Parasite Incidence > 5) (N > 5 million). In each sub-district, we sampled four populations in three 6 -monthly surveys: households, children < 5 years, people with fever in the last 2 weeks and community health workers. In three districts, trained local staff collected, analysed and used data for programme management; in one control district, non-local staff collected data and did not disseminate results. For eight indicators, we calculated the change in proportion from survey one to three and used a Difference-in-Differences test to compare the relative change between intervention and control districts. RESULTS Coverage increased from survey one to three for 24 of 32 comparisons. Difference-in-Differences tests revealed that intervention districts exhibited significantly greater change in four of six vertical strategies (insecticide treated bed-nets and indoor residual spraying), one of six treatment-seeking behaviours and four of 12 health worker <b>capacity</b> <b>indicators.</b> The control district displayed greater improvement than two intervention districts for one health worker <b>capacity</b> <b>indicator.</b> One district with poor management did not improve.
