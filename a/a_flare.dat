5|$|Mackintosh later joined Ernest Joyce {{and others}} on a journey across the Great Ice Barrier to Minna Bluff, to lay a depot for Shackleton's polar party, whose return from their {{southern}} march was awaited. On 3 March, while keeping watch {{on the deck of}} Nimrod, Mackintosh observed <b>a</b> <b>flare,</b> which signalled the safe return of Shackleton and his party. They had fallen just short of their South Pole objective, having reached a Farthest South of 88° 23' S.|$|E

5|$|On 25 June 1916, Brussels left Hoek van Holland {{bound for}} Harwich. Lights were shown {{from the beach}} and <b>a</b> <b>flare</b> was fired. A {{passenger}} {{is reported to have}} remained on deck and signalled to shore. Five German destroyers surrounded Brussels. The passengers were told to prepare to take to the lifeboats and orders were given for official papers to be destroyed, which was done successfully. Brussels was taken by the Germans, and the radio was destroyed. She was escorted into Zeebrugge and then to Bruges.|$|E

On the way, Stewie accidentally causes a traffic pileup by {{discharging}} <b>a</b> <b>flare</b> pistol in the cab of the truck, which catches fire and explodes. Crashing his car in a chain reaction, Brian becomes angry and tells Stewie that Santa does not exist. Stewie becomes frustrated and continues to attempt to hitchhike, corecing Brian to join him. The pair then encounter a Canadian who gives them his snowmobile.|$|E
5|$|Bond goes to Osato Chemicals to meet Mr. Osato himself, {{masquerading}} {{as a potential}} new buyer. Osato humours Bond, but after their meeting he orders his secretary, Helga Brandt, to have him killed. Outside the building, assassins open fire on Bond before Aki rescues him again. Bond and Aki drive to Kobe, where the Ning-Po is docked. They investigate the company's dock facilities and discover that the ship was delivering elements for rocket fuel. They are discovered, but Bond eludes the henchmen until Aki gets away; however, Bond is captured and knocked out. He wakes, tied up in SPECTRE operative Helga Brandt's cabin on the Ning-Po. In a sexy cocktail dress, she interrogates Bond, but he thinks of managing to bribe his way to freedom when she suddenly chooses to enjoy herself by kissing and freeing him {{in order to have}} sex. Brandt then flies Bond to Tokyo, but en route she sets off <b>a</b> <b>flare</b> in the plane and bails out, finally persuaded to kill him. Bond manages to land the plane.|$|E

5|$|Mulder and Ludwig {{venture into}} the {{volcanic}} caves to find Trepkos. When they find Firewalker, Trepkos shoots Ludwig {{in the back with}} <b>a</b> <b>flare</b> gun, killing him. He then burns Ludwig's body, as he was infected with the spore as well. Trepkos tells Mulder that after Firewalker returned from its first descent, Erickson pulverized a rock in one of its samples, resulting in his death and the infection of all the scientists immediately surrounding him. Trepkos says that the spore is parasitic in nature, making its hosts pass itself on to others. Meanwhile, in the lab, an infected O'Neil handcuffs herself to Scully to expose her to the spore, forcing Scully to use a hammer to split the chains but to no avail, so she instead protects herself by throwing O'Neil into a sealed chamber and closing the door. A protrusion then bursts out of O'Neil's throat, killing her without spreading the spore to Scully.|$|E
5|$|Once the {{infantry}} {{had reached the}} German trenches, the artillery shifted from the creeping barrage to the standing barrage, a static barrage that would protect {{the infantry}} from counter-attack while they consolidated the position. A variant was the box barrage, in which three or four barrages formed a box—or more often three sides of a box—around a position to isolate and prevent reinforcements being brought up into the front line. This was normally used to protect trench raids, although {{it could also be}} used offensively against a German unit. Another type of barrage was the SOS barrage, fired in response to a German counterattack. An SOS barrage could be brought down by firing <b>a</b> <b>flare</b> signal of a pre arranged colour, as a German barrage tended to cut the telephone lines. A pre-registered barrage would then descend on No Man's Land.|$|E

As Mars sings the bridge, the two rappers find {{their way out of}} the tunnels, through a manhole which leads them to a field where Mars sings. As the sun starts to set, couples, along with Bad Meets Evil, gather to see a large group of rising sky lanterns aglow. Beats by Dr. Dre headphones are advertised in the video and one couple gathers in front of a Chrysler 300. As the video reaches its conclusion, the setting gets dark and Mars sings the last lines.|$|E

5|$|Wales {{were seen}} to have their best chance in {{reaching}} a major tournament after their group was selected for qualification for the 1994 FIFA World Cup. However a Gheorghe Hagi-inspired Romania defeated Wales 5–1 in Bucharest to open the Wales campaign. Victories over the Faroe Islands and Belgium and two draws with the Representation of Czechs and Slovaks put Wales back on track, and a victory over Romania in Cardiff in the last game of the tournament {{would be enough to}} secure a place in the World Cup. However Southall allowed a 25-yard strike from Hagi slip under his body and into the net and was nutmegged by Florin Răducioiu as Wales were beaten 2–1. Once again a death put Welsh footballing hopes into perspective, as Southall attended the funeral of retired postman John Hill, who was killed after being struck by <b>a</b> <b>flare</b> released {{at the end of the}} match.|$|E
5|$|Wolf 359 {{is one of}} {{the faintest}} and lowest-mass stars known. At the {{light-emitting}} layer called the photosphere, it has a temperature of about 2,800 K, which is low enough for chemical compounds to form and survive. The absorption lines of compounds such as water and titanium(II) oxide have been observed in the spectrum. The surface has a magnetic field that is stronger than the average magnetic field on the Sun. As a result of magnetic activity caused by convection, Wolf 359 is <b>a</b> <b>flare</b> star that can undergo sudden increases in luminosity for several minutes. These flares emit strong bursts of X-ray and gamma ray radiation that have been observed by space telescopes. Wolf 359 is a relatively young star with an age of less than a billion years. No companions or disks of debris have been detected in orbit around it.|$|E
5|$|After Daniel parachutes from {{a failing}} {{helicopter}} onto the island, he uses Naomi's phone to contact George Minkowski (Fisher Stevens) {{on the ship}} that he came from. The next morning, on December 22, 2004, two of the flight 815 survivors – Jack Shephard (Matthew Fox) and Kate Austen (Evangeline Lilly) – help Daniel find his colleagues, as the rival group led by Locke attempts to do the same. Jack and Kate find Miles, who demands to see Naomi's body, and ascertains that Naomi was killed by Kate as Naomi said a code on the phone before dying. Kate confesses then that Naoimi was killed by John Locke. Locke's group finds Charlotte, takes her prisoner, and disposes of her tracking device. Daniel's third colleague, helicopter pilot Frank, fires <b>a</b> <b>flare</b> into the sky, leading Jack's group to him. Frank tells Jack's group that he managed to land the helicopter intact. After finding out that Juliet Burke (Elizabeth Mitchell) {{is one of the}} Others, Miles demands to know where Ben (Michael Emerson) is, as locating him is the freighter crew's primary objective. In Locke's group, several people become discontent with Locke's revelation that he is following the instructions of Walt Lloyd (Malcolm David Kelley), who had left the island a month earlier, and they also question why Ben is being kept alive. Locke holds him at gunpoint, and Ben starts to reveal information about the Kahana crew, specifically Charlotte's identity and that he has a spy aboard the ship.|$|E

5|$|Following David and Shaw's exodus for the Engineer home world, {{they arrive}} at a temple {{surrounded}} by scores of Engineers. David carpet bombs them with the mutagen, resulting in the extinction of all non-floral life on the planet, as well as mutations in the flora that can infect and impregnate organisms with Neomorphs. The Engineer ship crashes afterwards and Shaw dies from unknown means, though David preserves and utilizes her body in his eugenics experiments. Ten years later, a team from the colony ship Covenant is attacked by two Neomorphs that burst from two of their bodies. David intervenes by frightening them away with <b>a</b> <b>flare</b> gun. He urges the survivors to follow him to the temple, where he has established his laboratory. Sporting overgrown hair, David introduces himself and offers them shelter, while learning about the 2,000 colonists and hundreds of embryos in stasis aboard Covenant. He takes {{a special interest in}} the successor model from his own synthetic line, Walter, and tells him that Shaw died when the Engineer ship crashed. David claims to have loved Shaw and compares it to Walter's attachment to the terraforming expert Daniels, which Walter dismisses as being impossible. David attempts to bond with Walter by teaching him to play the flute. They recognize that while Walter is more advanced, he has been inhibited from creating, due to disturbances caused by David models with that feature.|$|E
5|$|In {{preparation}} for the attack, Godsal and Lynes had carefully consulted available charts of Ostend following the previous operation's failure caused by German repositioning of navigation buoys. This careful study was, however, rendered worthless by a sudden fog which obliterated all sight of the shore. Steaming {{back and forth across}} the harbour entrance in the fog as the monitors and German shore batteries engaged in a long range artillery duel over the lost cruiser, Godsal looked for the piers marking the entrance to the canal. As he searched, two German torpedo boats sailed from Ostend to intercept the cruiser, but in the heavy fog they collided and, disabled, limped back to shore. During this period, Godsal's motor launches lost track of the cruiser in the murk, and it was not until the third pass that Vindictive found the entrance, accompanied by only one of the launches. Heading straight into the mouth of the canal, guided by <b>a</b> <b>flare</b> dropped by the launch, Vindictive became an instant target of the German batteries and was badly damaged, the shellfire exacerbating the damage suffered in the earlier Zeebrugge Raid and seriously damaging Vindictives port propeller.|$|E
