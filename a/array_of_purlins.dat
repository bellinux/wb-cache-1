A new kind <b>of</b> <b>purlin</b> connection was put forward in this paper. The mechanical behavior of the new connection was studied by finite element analysis using software ANSYS. As {{can be seen from}} the simulation results, the new connection can enhance the stiffness <b>of</b> <b>purlin,</b> and effect <b>of</b> each new wave connection is better than the promotion <b>of</b> <b>purlin</b> stiffness in the vibration wave connection.

To {{investigate}} the validity of this design assumption, non-linear analytical and finite element models for analyzing how the gravity load affects the maximum mid-span stresses in cold-formed steel purlins attached to the roof sheeting are presented in this paper. The second-order effect of tensile stresses induced by the gravity load in the free flange <b>of</b> <b>purlins</b> is investigated by emphasizing on Z and C sections. The results obtained from the two models are compared with Eurocode 3, and they are included in this article.

As the strength <b>of</b> the attached <b>purlins</b> is considerably increased due to the lateral and rotational restraints provided by the sandwich panels, estimating these restraints {{is important in the}} design <b>of</b> <b>purlins.</b> The rotational restraint is generally determined by experiments, as no design rules exist for sandwich purlin-sheeting systems. In this paper, a non-linear finite element model is presented to estimate the rotational restraint provided by the sandwich panels to the attached purlin. The model is validated with experimental tests and is in good agreement. In order to develop a design method for estimating the rotational restraint in sandwich purlin-sheeting systems, the model could be useful for parametric studies to investigate the influencing factors.

40|$|Lapped joints of cold-formed steel (CFS) Z-shaped purlins are {{extensively}} used {{in metal}} building roof systems. The {{research that has}} been carried out so far for these lapped connections is primarily focused on connections with round holes. However, the lapped connections with vertical slotted holes are extensively used in current construction practice to simplify the erection of continuous Z-shaped roof purlins. There is no design guideline or recommendation available for CFS Z-purlin lapped connections with vertical slotted holes. Presented in this paper are the results of an experimental study and analysis of the structural behaviour of lapped CFS Z-shaped purlin connections with vertical slotted holes. 42 flexural tests were performed on lapped CFS Z-shaped purlins with vertical slotted connections with different lap lengths, purlin depths, thicknesses and spans. The flexural strength and deflection of each specimen were measured. The characteristics of moment resistance and flexure stiffness <b>of</b> the lapped <b>purlins</b> were computed. The test results show that the lapped purlins with vertical slotted holes may be more flexible than the lapped purlins with round holes or continuous purlins without lapped joint. Thus, the slotted connections may need greater lap lengths to achieve full stiffness <b>of</b> continuous <b>purlins.</b> The results also indicate that the characteristics of moment resistance and flexural stiffness in the slotted connections are dependent on the ratio of lap length to purlin depth, the ratio of lap length to purlin thickness, the ratio <b>of</b> <b>purlin</b> depth to purlin thickness, and the ratio of lap length to span. Based on the results, design recommendations for evaluating the moment resistance and flexural stiffness of lapped slotted connections were proposed...|$|R
