[...] At 21, Ron was a musician and composer in Greenwich Village who met and became {{good friends with}} 28 year old Shel Silverstein, [...] an American poet, singer-songwriter, cartoonist, screenwriter, and author of children's books. Haffkine formed and managed a band called The Gurus. Wanting to record the group he walked into Regent Sound in Ny and explained to a sound engineer named Bill Szymczyk, the soon to be producer of The Eagles, {{that he wanted to}} make a record, but knew nothing about the process, Bill agreed to help. During the sessions, Ron would tell Bill: [...] "I’d like to hear this or I’d like to hear that, or… there’s not enough of this or there’s too much of that". When finished, Ron played it for Shel, known as the writer of [...] "A Boy Named Sue," [...] which Johnny Cash parlayed into a hit, he was so impressed that he told Ron <b>about</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> films that he was writing the soundtrack for and that he needed someone to produce the music.|$|E

40|$|Based on {{original}} data, {{this article}} discusses rural‒urban mobilities and the contemporary employment‒migration relationship. Starting with the observation of reduced rural population but maintained family-farm numbers, it engages with multiple issues, including rural employment, the process of urban migration, settlement in the city, the relation of migrants to the rurality and (return) counter-migration. It supports the thesis that migration {{is not so much}} <b>about</b> <b>a</b> ‘movement from one place to another’, the classical migration definition, and more <b>about</b> <b>a</b> <b>coupling</b> <b>of</b> practices (related to mobilities, residence, employment, etc.) with places over time. Thus, migration and counter-migration are conceptualized as socio-spatial strategies, conceptualized as ‘multi-place living’ or ‘dual life’, which are based on variable engagements with rural farming, urban wage labour and return movements (for retirement, refuge, etc.). The newly emergent and growing dual/multi-place structures that result from this are re-shaping village life in particular, expressed in various ways, such as in a changing village demography and function...|$|R

40|$|Analytic and six-degree-of-freedom motion base {{simulator}} {{studies have}} been conducted to better understand how the coupled roll-spiral and coupled roll-aileron actuator modes affect aircraft handling qualities. The results reported herein are preliminary and are subject to change until other aircraft and several more data points can be examined. The results obtained thus far indicate that when the roll-spiral coupled mode is brought about by unusual values of an aircraft's stability and control derivatives, the lateral-directional handling qualities will invariably be degraded. However, when the roll spiral coupling is brought <b>about</b> by <b>a</b> roll-rate command/roll-attitude hold stability and control augmentation system (SCAS), the requirements for satisfactory handling qualities can be correlated to the natural frequency and the damping <b>of</b> the <b>coupled</b> mode. Satisfactory handling qualities were also achieved when the lateral SCAS brought <b>about</b> <b>a</b> <b>coupling</b> <b>of</b> the roll mode with the aileron actuator mode. In this case, the pilot ratings indicate that the handling qualities may be correlated to the natural frequency <b>of</b> the <b>coupled</b> roll-aileron mode...|$|R
