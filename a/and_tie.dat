5|$|In 1998 {{the festival}} {{was once again}} struck with severe floods and storms, and again some festival goers {{departed}} early – but those who stayed were treated to performances from acts such as Pulp, Robbie Williams and Blur. Tony Bennett, however, overcame the messy environment in an immaculate white suit <b>and</b> <b>tie.</b> 1998 {{was also the first}} year that attendance officially broke the 100,000 mark.|$|E

5|$|Hitler {{earmarked}} three field armies for the offensive: the 7th and the Fifth and Sixth Panzer. These {{accumulated over}} 240,000 soldiers, spread over seven panzer divisions, two panzer brigades and thirteen infantry divisions. The {{bulk of the}} offensive's armored strength was in the Sixth Panzer Army, which was tasked with the capture of the Belgian port of Antwerp. To its south was the Fifth Panzer Army, outfitted to protect the Sixth's flank while it crossed the Meuse river. The southernmost flank was covered by the Seventh Army, composed of three infantry corps and ordered to protect the Fifth Army's southern flank <b>and</b> <b>tie</b> down American reserves in Luxembourg.|$|E
5|$|However, this outward {{dullness}} concealed a sharp {{mind and}} great administrative talent. He operated mainly {{behind the scenes}} and cultivated {{an image of a}} colourless bureaucrat – for example, he was the only Bolshevik leader who always wore a suit <b>and</b> <b>tie.</b> In 1928 Molotov replaced Nikolai Uglanov as First Secretary of the Moscow Communist Party and held that position until 15 August 1929. In a lengthy address to the Central Committee in 1929, Molotov told the members the Soviet government would initiate a compulsory collectivisation campaign to solve the agrarian backwardness of Soviet agriculture.|$|E
5|$|In 1998 {{he made an}} {{unlikely}} but successful appearance at a mud-soaked Glastonbury in an immaculate suit <b>and</b> <b>tie.</b> Bennett also published The Good Life: The Autobiography of Tony Bennett in 1998.

5|$|In {{his later}} {{political}} career, he became known for wearing {{a bright red}} vest <b>and</b> <b>tie.</b> He adopted this dress during his term as vice-president when he and James Reeside, a mail contractor known for his drab dress, passed a tailor's shop that displayed a bright red cloth in the window. Johnson suggested that Reeside should wear a red vest because the mail coaches he owned and operated were red. Reeside agreed to do so if Johnson would also. Both men ordered red vests and neckties, and were known for donning this attire {{for the rest of}} their lives.|$|E
5|$|Logging resumed in 1912 in {{the north}} part of the canyon, where The Boone's Ferry Wood <b>and</b> <b>Tie</b> Company had a site near what became Alfred Street. A sawmill and steam donkey engine {{operated}} near the future sites of Beaver Bridge and Obie's Bridge. The lumber was used chiefly for railroad ties, cordwood and flagpoles, and left huge cedar stumps that remain in the park. Intermittent logging continued through 1961, and a 1962 windstorm known as the Columbus Day Storm blew down many remaining trees.|$|E
5|$|On {{the day of}} the tournament, Homer threatens Bart to win {{no matter}} what. In an {{extremely}} close match, Bart and Todd each do well, <b>and</b> <b>tie</b> by the time they reach the eighteenth hole. Bart and Todd agree that the competition is not worth the stress, that they are equally good and that they should call it a draw, splitting the award evenly. As a result, Ned and Homer are forced to wear their respective wives' Sunday dresses and mow each other's lawn. People around the neighborhood laugh at them and Ned actually enjoys it (commenting that it reminds him of his fraternity days in college), much to Homer's dismay.|$|E

5|$|The evening draw, which {{consisted}} of men's team play, saw Team North America extending their lead to five points. Heath McCormick dominated against Thomas Ulsrud, who lost second Christoffer Svae {{in the middle of}} the game due to illness. Kevin Martin established an early lead in the first half of the game versus Niklas Edin and held his lead to win. Glenn Howard had a chance to make the draw a North America sweep, starting off with a small lead against Tom Brewster, but a mistake in the eighth end from Brent Laing led to a chance for Brewster to come back <b>and</b> <b>tie</b> the game, which he did. At the end of the day, Team North America led Team World 13–8.|$|E
5|$|The {{roof of the}} south, {{east and}} west stands built for the {{athletics}} stadium configuration {{was supported by the}} cable net system.

After the games the track and field were excavated. The temporary bleachers at the north end were removed and the North Stand and lower tier of seats constructed on the prepared excavation. The North Stand roof was completed by adding rafters, purlins and cladding.|$|E
5|$|To {{ensure the}} success of the Chinese counterattack against ROK II Corps, the PVA 40th Corps was {{assigned}} the mission of protecting the PVA 38th Corps' flank against the US 2nd Infantry Division. To accomplish this mission, the PVA 119th Division of the 40th Corps would first attack Somin-dong and to prevent the Americans from reinforcing the Koreans. The 120th Division would then fight its way across the Ch'ongch'on River <b>and</b> <b>tie</b> down the bulk of the US 2nd Infantry Division. Finally, the 118th Division would flank the Americans from the west and capture Kujang-dong from the rear.|$|E

5|$|At 10:10 of {{the third}} quarter Roethlisberger {{completed}} a 65-yard touchdown pass to Nate Washington to give the Steelers a 14–9 lead. Later in the quarter, a Steelers 53-yard touchdown pass was negated due to a holding penalty and Pittsburgh was forced to punt. In the final quarter Pittsburgh kept New York out of the end zone on three plays inside the 10-yard line, however, the Giants connected on a field goal to bring the Giants to within two points. On the next drive, James Harrison—who was called in to replace injured long snapper Greg Warren—snapped the ball out of the end zone to give the Giants a safety <b>and</b> <b>tie</b> the game. The Giants drove after receiving the safety's kickoff to score a touchdown—taking a 21–14 lead with 3:07 remaining. Pittsburgh was unable to convert on their final two drives, as Roethlisberger threw his fourth interception of the day.|$|E
5|$|At Tabata's suggestion, Naora {{expanded}} the color palette {{to increase the}} game's realism <b>and</b> <b>tie</b> in with XVs art style. The original idea was to change the original red hue to a golden one to match the redone logo, but the graphics looked too dark on the large screen even with the adjustment, so blue tones were added to brighten up the scenery. Additional bass sounds {{were added to the}} sound effects, as the original platform's speaker system had previously limited the range and strength of sounds. The original camera behavior needed to be developed from scratch, as the camera angles used in the original looked out of place on the large screen. During the run-up to release, the team made modifications to the camera after receiving negative comments during demonstrations, addressing scenery collisions and the visibility of player and enemy characters during active gameplay. Because of these modifications, character speed and movement could be increased and improved. By December 2014, the game was in its final stages of development and undergoing debugging.|$|E
5|$|At {{the inaugural}} 12th Johor State Assembly Seating in April 2008, a minor {{controversy}} erupted when one opposition {{member of parliament}} (MP), Gwee Tong Hiang, flouted dress regulations by appearing in a lounge suit <b>and</b> <b>tie</b> {{instead of the usual}} official attire and songkok. This resulted in him being dismissed from the assembly chamber shortly before the Sultan's arrival. Gwee, a Democratic Action Party (DAP) MP, reportedly argued that there was no stated order to wear the official attire and songkok and stated his desire to wear a western suit, promptly drew flak from other MPs and the Menteri Besar, Abdul Ghani Othman who had earlier on met to agree to don in the official attire and songkok prior to the assembly, whereby Gwee was absent. The Sultan, apparently angry at Gwee, sharply criticised him two days later and publicly called upon Gwee to seek an audience with him.|$|E
