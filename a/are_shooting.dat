5|$|The steel casket {{containing}} the gold is traced {{by the police}} allowing them to track down Diabolik's hideout. They close in on Diabolik, who is melting the gold and turning it into ingots. Because the police <b>are</b> <b>shooting</b> at him, Diabolik is unable to control the heating of the gold, and the whole cavern ends up being covered in molten gold. Again, Diabolik {{is believed to be}} dead, with his heat-proof suit now covered in solidified gold. The police seal off the cavern intending to recover the gold later. Eva is allowed to pay her respects to Diabolik, who winks at her.|$|E

This gesture is made by UTEP Miners fans when UTEP players <b>are</b> <b>shooting</b> free throws at basketball games, or any time UTEP kicks off at a football game. It was first introduced by the UTEP cheerleading squad during the 1976–77 football season.|$|E

Over 1,000 unique {{lines have been}} recorded for each survivor. Additional communication of player actions is conveyed through character lights. Also, weapon-mounted flashlights and muzzle flashes help the players in determining whether their companions <b>are</b> <b>shooting,</b> performing melee attacks, reloading or moving. Due to control issues {{and the likelihood of}} players using a headset, the Xbox 360 version of Left 4 Dead omits the quick phrases feature.|$|E
25|$|The {{majority}} of the violence that took place on 11 April 2002 was near the Llagano Overpass. There is no consensus as to {{who was responsible for}} the deaths on that day, and this remains a very controversial issue. The opposition version of events puts the blame on Chávez, or at least on his supporters. Many groups of the Bolivarian Circles gathered near the Llagano Overpass before the march reached the area. A Venevisión camera positioned on a rooftop that afternoon captured images of people using handguns to shoot from the pro-Chávez counter-march being held on the Llagano Overpass, an overpass that crosses one of central Caracas's busiest avenues; it is unclear who they <b>are</b> <b>shooting</b> at, but the opposition narrative is that they were shooting at the opposition march and responsible for the deaths.|$|E
500|$|The House Committee on National Security {{hearing on}} 3 August was {{presided over by}} Congressman Bob Dornan and lasted one day. At the hearing, Pilkington and Andrus {{explained}} how the USAF accident investigation was conducted and emphasized that Wickson and May violated the OPC rules of engagement by conducting a VID pass of the Black Hawks that was inadequate to determine the helicopter's national origin. Andrus stated, [...] "Sir, as a pilot, I would have made another pass. You would never fire until {{you know what you}} <b>are</b> <b>shooting</b> at." [...] Retired USAF colonel and pilot Jerry Cox expressed concern to the Committee with the F-15 pilots for not taking responsibility for their actions.|$|E

5000|$|Showtime {{approached}} Corman {{with the}} idea of doing a series of science fiction and horror feature films. They started filming in January 1995 and finished shooting 13 films in mid June. Corman said, [...] "I don't think a day went by that we weren't <b>shooting.</b> We <b>were</b> <b>shooting</b> on weekends, we <b>were</b> <b>shooting</b> at our studio here. We <b>were</b> <b>shooting</b> at local locations, and we shot one film in Moscow and one film in Manila. So we were all over the world with this thing." ...|$|R
500|$|At least 120 {{people were}} injured {{according}} to medical officials. Salmaniya hospital was [...] "overwhelmed" [...] with casualties, {{some of whom were}} taken to private hospitals. Doctors said that nine of the thirty-two casualties who reached Salmaniya hospital were in critical condition. Some medics cried while treating the injured, some of whom had bullets still lodged into their bodies, X-rays showed. A doctor interviewed by Al Jazeera English pleaded for help from [...] "all countries in the world". Describing the situation in hospital as a war, Dr. Ghassan said, [...] "They <b>are</b> <b>shooting</b> at people's heads. Not at the legs. People are having their brains blown out". Two doctors said they treated patients who [...] "seemed to be [...] live bullets rather than shotgun pellets, judging by the entry and exit holes".|$|E
500|$|Jon Favreau {{said it was}} {{originally}} his intent to create a film trilogy for Iron Man, with Obadiah Stane (Jeff Bridges) becoming Iron Monger during the sequels. After a meeting between Favreau and various comic book writers, including Mark Millar, Stane became the main villain in Iron Man. Millar argued the Mandarin, whom Favreau originally intended to fill that role, was too fantastical. Favreau concurred, deciding, [...] "I look at Mandarin more like how in Star Wars you had the Emperor, but Darth Vader is the guy {{you want to see}} fight. Then you work your way to the time when lightning bolts <b>are</b> <b>shooting</b> out of the fingers and all that stuff could happen. But you can't have what happened in Return of the Jedi happen in A New Hope. You just can't do it." [...] Favreau also discussed in interviews how the films' version of Mandarin [...] "allows us to incorporate the whole pantheon of villains". He mentioned that S.H.I.E.L.D. would continue to have a major role.|$|E
500|$|Asked {{about the}} {{greatest}} challenge in filming the battle, Sapochnik said: [...] "Every time we charge the horses it takes 25 minutes to reset all the fake snow {{on the field and}} rub out the horseshoe prints. So how many times can we afford to charge the horses each day knowing we need to give time for a reset that's 10 times longer than the actual shot? Another thing was how to make 500 extras look like 8,000 when you <b>are</b> <b>shooting</b> in a field where there's just nowhere to hide your shortfall. It becomes a bit like a bonkers math equation. And finally: How do you get these guys riled up enough to run at each other and get covered in mud and stand in the rain and then run at each other again and again for 25 days, 10 hours a day, without them just telling you to piss off?" [...] In an interview, he said that the single most difficult thing he was asked to depict was [...] "having 3,000 horses running at each other, especially after we discovered that horses cannot touch each other. It’s illegal — it’s a very valid rule about protecting the horses. So the very thing we were trying to do was not allowed. And we only had 70 horses ... you would have one guy run into the frame, and then the horse rider would pull the horse, which means make the horse fall and lie down on its side. Later we would digitally superimpose another C.G.I. horse and make it seem like it had impacted the live one." ...|$|E

2500|$|Other reviews {{were more}} negative. Roger Ebert found the film highly {{offensive}} and [...] "morally reprehensible", giving it {{one out of}} four stars. He cited the coarse language and violence, particularly the scene in which Hit-Girl is nearly killed by D'Amico. [...] "When kids in the age range of this movie's home video audience <b>are</b> <b>shooting</b> one another every day in America, that kind of stops being funny." [...] Ebert's only notes of praise were for the performances of Cage, Johnson and Moretz. The movie made that week's [...] "Your Movie Sucks" [...] list of one-star movies.|$|E
2500|$|John J. O'Connor, {{writing for}} The New York Times in January 1993, noted that pre-release {{advertisements}} for [...] offered [...] "a new Star Trek era" [...] and added, [...] "Welcome to the Dark Side. The determinedly optimistic Mr. Roddenberry was partial to plots that made uplifting moral points. The new creators and executive producers, Rick Berman and Michael Piller, <b>are</b> <b>shooting,</b> so to speak, {{for something more}} ambivalent, less perfect." [...] In September 1996, {{before the start of}} Season Four, O'Connor was not sure the series was tackling contemporary themes adequately. He wrote, [...] "Inevitably, though, {{there is an element of}} exhaustion seeping through the concept. With the Cold War over, perhaps the Roddenberry optimism seems merely naive as headlines bring news of murderous divisions between Serbs and Muslims, Kurds and Turks, Israelis and Palestinians, Irish Catholics and Protestants, and so on across an increasingly depressing globe. Star Trek offered a vision that leapt 300 years into the future. For too many people today, three years would seem a stretch." ...|$|E
2500|$|CNN's Glenn Beck later invited Yigal Carmon {{onto his}} program {{to comment on}} the alleged mistranslation. Carmon criticized CNN's translators {{understanding}} of Arabic stating: [...] "Even someone who doesn't know Arabic would listen to the tape and would hear the word 'Jews' is at the end, and also it means it is something to be done to the Jews, not by the Jews. And she insisted, no the word is in the beginning. I said: 'Octavia, you just don't get it. It is at the end.'" [...] He was referring to Arabic native speaker Octavia Nasr, a Greek-orthodox Christian from Lebanon, who was later fired by CNN for a tweet praising late Ayatollah Hussein Fadlallah. Brian Whitaker, a Middle East editor for the British Guardian newspaper later pointed out that the word order in Arabic {{is not the same as}} in English: [...] "the verb comes first and so a sentence in Arabic which literally says 'Are shooting at us the Jews' means 'The Jews <b>are</b> <b>shooting</b> at us.'" ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{center is}} {{considered}} a necessary component for a successful team, especially in professional leagues such as the NBA. But recently, the NBA {{has turned into a}} point guard league and many centers <b>are</b> <b>shooting</b> threes now. Great centers have been the foundation for most of the dynasties in both the NBA and NCAA. The 6'10" [...] (2.08 m) George Mikan pioneered the Center position, shattering the widely held perception that tall players could not develop the agility and coordination to play basketball well, and ushering {{in the role of the}} dominant big man. He led DePaul University to the NIT title, then, after turning professional, won seven National Basketball League, Basketball Association of America and NBA Championships in his ten-year career (1946–56), nine of them with the Minneapolis Lakers. Using his height to dominate opposing players, Mikan invented the hook shot and the shot block; as a consequence, the NCAA, and later NBA, adopted the goaltending rule, and, in 1951, the NBA widened the foul lane, a decision known as the 'Mikan rule'.|$|E
2500|$|Industry {{and agency}} {{officials}} say {{there has been a}} shift in where porn is made, and estimated the potential economic impact is estimated at US$6 billion. In November 2013, Diane Duke, executive director of industry trade group Free Speech Coalition, said, [...] "Fewer people <b>are</b> <b>shooting</b> (adult film) in L.A. County, and some have moved to other areas around California or other states...". Two months later, The Verge reported, [...] "in the midst of rampant piracy on top of Measure B, many studios have relocated to Las Vegas, where filmmaking is cheaper and regulations are more lax." [...] Then in September 2014, Robert Lang, director of Brookings Mountain West (a collaboration of UNLV and the Brookings Institution to study issues facing the Intermountain West region), was quoted as saying, [...] "Some big part of it will stay (in LA) and production companies will continue to be based there, so it’s not accurate to say that all of that $6 billion translates to Southern Nevada. But what it also gives to Las Vegas is that it’s building technical capacity that undergirds non-pornographic production and media. It adds some competitive advantage in scale to Los Angeles." ...|$|E
