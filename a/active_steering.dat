2500|$|Along {{with these}} chassis refinements, Sport package {{equipped}} models came with firmer rear shocks, bigger front brake calipers, and larger [...] rotors all around (up from 12.6/12.1-inch front/rear). Sport package equipped cars {{also get a}} viscous limited slip differential. An all-new <b>Active</b> <b>Steering</b> package can be ordered for sport package equipped models. It features a planetary gearset on the steering shaft (similar to BMW), that varies the steering ratio between 12.0:1 and 18.5:1. A rear-wheel steering system that induces up to one degree of rear steer is also included in this package. The <b>Active</b> <b>Steering</b> package includes even stiffer shocks than the sport package at all four corners and the ride has been repeatedly reported as being too stiff for most customers except the most [...] "enthusiastic" [...] drivers.

2500|$|The R31 Skyline {{introduced}} {{many new}} technologies and features. The HR31 was the first Skyline to be equipped with the new RB-series of engines. The HR31 RB engines are {{often referred to as}} [...] "Red Top" [...] engines because of the red cam covers. There were three variants. The earliest series of DOHC, 24-valve, RB engines used the NICS (Nissan Induction Control System) injection system with 12 very small intake runners, and a butterfly system to divide the intake ports in half for better low RPM performance. Later versions used ECCS (Electronically Concentrated Control System) engine management, discarded the twelve tiny runners for six much larger ones (though the cylinder heads still retained twelve individual intake ports separated by casting), and received a slightly larger turbocharger. Nissan's RD28, a 2.8 straight-six engine, featured for a diesel option. Another technological first for the R31 was the introduction of Nissan's proprietary 4-wheel steering system, dubbed HICAS (High Capacity <b>Active</b> <b>Steering).</b> The R31 series were also the only models in the Skyline family to feature a four-door hardtop variation. These models were generally badged as the Passage GT.|$|E

Brembo brakes were removed for the 2005 and 2006 models, and the brakes were redesigned with larger discs and a different caliper design. This was partly in response to a number of complaints about the previous years' brakes, which included a class action lawsuit filed in California related to premature wear on 2003–2004 models. A sport-tuned suspension package was standard on all six-speed manual equipped models, which included a viscous limited slip differential and the higher output VQ35DE [...] "Rev-UP" [...] engine. The 2006 models received minor updates. On the exterior there were new headlights, taillights, spoiler, sport side sills, and front bumper.

We present the controller performances for the lateral dynamic behaviour, the yaw stability and the manoeuvrability of a vehicle when subjected to a sudden threat or disturbance such as a gust of wind, a road bank angle or a split-μ road surface in order to enable a fast safe lane-change trajectory to be followed. The vehicle was driven at a medium forward speed and a high forward speed in order {{to investigate}} {{the effectiveness of the}} proposed approach in avoiding the threat, maintaining the stability and enablinge a fast safe lane-change trajectory to be followed. We compared two different controllers (a model predictive controller and a switching model predictive controller) for two different control manoeuvres (<b>active</b> rear <b>steering</b> with differential braking control and <b>active</b> rear <b>steering</b> with direct yaw moment control). The simulation results demonstrate that the proposed switching model predictive control method provides an improved fast safe lane-change manoeuvre in a threat avoidance scenario for both control manoeuvres. It also demonstrated that the proposed <b>active</b> rear <b>steering</b> with differential braking control is more useful for maintaining the stability of the vehicle in a threat avoidance scenario with disturbance effects than is <b>active</b> rear <b>steering</b> with direct yaw moment control...|$|R

40|$|This article {{presents}} an active safety {{system for a}} wheeled armored vehicle to encounter {{the effect of the}} firing force. The firing force which acts as an external disturbance causes unwanted yaw moment occurred at the center of gravity of the wheeled armored vehicle. This effect causes the wheeled armored vehicle lose its handling stability and the traveling path after the firing condition. In order to overcome the stability problem, a Firing-On-the-Move assisted by an <b>Active</b> Front Wheel <b>Steering</b> system is proposed in this study. This system is developed based on two established systems, namely, Firing-On-the-Move and <b>Active</b> Front Wheel <b>Steering</b> systems. The proposed system is designed to improve the handling and directional stability performances of the armored vehicle while fires in dynamic condition. Four types of control strategies are designed and investigated in this study to identify the most optimum control strategy as the Firing-On-the-Move assisted by an <b>Active</b> Front Wheel <b>Steering</b> system using optimization tool, genetic algorithm. The control strategies for the Firing-On-the-Move assisted by an <b>Active</b> Front Wheel <b>Steering</b> are evaluated using various types of vehicle speeds and firing angle in order to obtain an appropriate control structure as the Firing-On-the-Move assisted by an <b>Active</b> Front Wheel <b>Steering</b> system for the wheeled armored vehicle...|$|R

50|$|To {{improve the}} roll {{stability}} in transient conditions, the prototype CLEVER vehicle was fitted with an <b>active</b> <b>steering</b> system in 2012; this allowed {{the use of}} a combined Steering Direct Tilt Control (SDTC) strategy. The <b>active</b> <b>steering</b> system output {{is a function of the}} vehicle’s tilt angle error (the difference between the actual and ideal tilt angle), therefore at steady state when there is little or no tilt angle error the front wheel steer angle matches the driver’s steer demand. However, in transient situations, such as upon turn-in, a tilt angle error exists and the <b>active</b> <b>steering</b> system acts to reduce or eliminate the driver’s steering input. In extreme conditions it will also initiate a countersteering action whereby the front wheel momentarily steers in the opposite direction to that intended by the driver. As the cabin approaches the desired tilt angle, the magnitude of the tilt angle error is reduced and the front wheel steer angle takes on the value demanded by the driver.|$|E
