5|$|Phytophthora cinnamomi dieback has {{not been}} {{identified}} <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>threat</b> <b>to</b> this species, but testing has {{found it to be}} highly susceptible; in one study it exhibited the highest susceptibility of 49 Banksia species studied, with 80% of plants dead within 96days of inoculation with the disease, and 100% dead within a year.|$|E
5|$|The Gospels {{say that}} Jesus was betrayed to the {{authorities}} by a disciple, and many scholars consider this report to be highly reliable. He was executed on the orders of Pontius Pilate, the Roman prefect of Judaea. Pilate most likely saw Jesus' reference to the Kingdom of God <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>threat</b> <b>to</b> Roman authority and worked with the Temple elites to have Jesus executed. The Sadducean high-priestly leaders of the Temple more plausibly had Jesus executed for political reasons than for his teaching. They may have regarded him <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>threat</b> <b>to</b> stability, especially after he caused a disturbance at the Second Temple. Other factors, such as Jesus' triumphal entry into Jerusalem, {{may have contributed to}} this decision. Most scholars consider Jesus' crucifixion to be factual, because early Christians would not have invented the painful death of their leader.|$|E
5|$|Adams also {{rebuilt the}} Navy, adding six fast, {{powerful}} frigates, {{most notably the}} USS Constitution. To pay for the military buildup, Congress imposed new taxes on property: the Direct Tax of 1798. It was the first (and last) such federal tax. Taxpayers were angered, especially in southeast Pennsylvania, where the bloodless Fries's Rebellion broke out among rural German-speaking farmers who protested what they saw <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>threat</b> <b>to</b> their republican liberties and to their churches.|$|E

5|$|Between 1025 and 1028, the Fatimids {{reached an}} {{agreement}} with Salih's Jarrahid/Tayyi allies, allowing them to maintain their foothold in interior Palestine, while Anushtakin was recalled to Cairo. In contrast to the Mirdasids, the Tayy consistently plundered their territory and its inhabitants. Moreover, the Fatimids would not tolerate independent rule in Palestine, which they viewed <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>threat</b> <b>to</b> the Caliphate's survival.|$|E
5|$|From {{the early}} 1960s, {{molecular}} biology was increasingly seen <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>threat</b> <b>to</b> the traditional core of evolutionary biology. Established evolutionary biologists—particularly Ernst Mayr, Theodosius Dobzhansky, and George Gaylord Simpson, {{three of the}} architects of the modern synthesis—were extremely skeptical of molecular approaches, especially {{when it came to the}} connection (or lack thereof) to natural selection. The molecular-clock hypothesis and the neutral theory were particularly controversial, spawning the neutralist-selectionist debate over the relative importance of mutation, drift and selection, which continued into the 1980s without a clear resolution.|$|E
5|$|Habitat {{destruction}} {{represents a}} threat to biodiversity in Croatia, as developed and agricultural land is expanded into previous natural habitats, while habitat fragmentation occurs as roads are created or expanded. A further threat to biodiversity is the introduction of invasive species, with Caulerpa racemosa and C. taxifolia identified as especially problematic ones. The invasive algae are monitored and regularly removed to protect the benthic habitat. Agricultural monocultures have also been identified <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>threat</b> <b>to</b> biodiversity.|$|E

5|$|In her {{treatment}} of the novel, María Regina Ruiz claims that power gives its wielder {{the ability to make}} prohibitions; prohibitions that are reflected in history, the study of which reveals what is and what is not told. The government's actions in The Feast of the Goat demonstrate the discourse of prohibition: foreign newspapers and magazines were prohibited from entering Trujillo's country as they were seen <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>threat</b> <b>to</b> the government's ideas. Mario Vargas Llosa takes part in this discourse by recounting what was prohibited.|$|E
5|$|No Game No Life {{is a light}} novel series {{written and}} {{illustrated}} by Yū Kamiya. It is published under the MF Bunko J imprint; nine volumes were published by Media Factory between April 25, 2012 and August 25, 2016. In August 2014, Yen Press announced No Game No Life will be one of its titles published under its newly launched imprint, Yen On, in 2015. Non-English localization include Brazil, Taiwan and Russia; distribution in China was banned due to the government viewing the series <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>threat</b> <b>to</b> communism.|$|E
5|$|Octavian {{began to}} make common cause with the Optimates, the former enemies of Caesar. In September, the leading Optimate orator Marcus Tullius Cicero began to attack Antony {{in a series of}} speeches portraying him <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>threat</b> <b>to</b> the Republican order. With opinion in Rome turning against him and his year of {{consular}} power nearing its end, Antony attempted to pass laws that would lend him control over Cisalpine Gaul, which had been assigned as part of his province, from Decimus Junius Brutus Albinus, one of Caesar's assassins.|$|E

5|$|Some of {{the militias}} that were then {{competing}} for power interpreted the UN troops' presence <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>threat</b> <b>to</b> their hegemony. Consequently, several gun battles {{took place in}} Mogadishu between local gunmen and peacekeepers. Among these was the Battle of Mogadishu of 1993, a US apprehension of two high-ranking lieutenants of faction leader Aidid. The UN soldiers eventually withdrew altogether from the country on 3 March 1995, having incurred more significant casualties.|$|E
5|$|Steamboat {{companies}} rightly saw nationwide railroads <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>threat</b> <b>to</b> their business. On May 6, 1856, {{just weeks}} after the bridge was completed, a steamboat captain deliberately crashed the Effie Afton into the bridge. The owner of the Effie Afton, John Hurd, {{filed a lawsuit against}} the Rock Island Railroad Company. Abraham Lincoln was the lead defense lawyer for the railroad company. The decision of the United States Supreme Court upheld the right to bridge navigable streams, therefore the bridge was allowed to remain.|$|E
5|$|The Habsburg Charles II of Spain {{was dying}} {{at this time}} and had no children. At Charles' request, Innocent advised that the throne pass to Philip of Anjou, {{grandson}} of Louis XIV of France, due to the close kinship between Louis and Charles. Philip succeeding to the Spanish throne was seen <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>threat</b> <b>to</b> {{the balance of power}} by other European nations, leading to the War of the Spanish Succession upon Charles' death, which took place six weeks after Innocent's own.|$|E

5|$|The Israeli Defense Minister Israel Navon (Doron Tavory) {{moves to}} {{a house on the}} border between Israel and the West Bank, with the {{building}} sitting on the Israeli side just next to the dividing line. The Israeli Secret Service views the neighboring lemon grove of Salma Zidane (Hiam Abbass), a Palestinian widow whose family has cared for the area for generations, <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>threat</b> <b>to</b> the minister and his wife. The security forces soon set up a guard post and a fence around the grove. They then obtain an order to uproot the lemon trees.|$|E
5|$|According to Philip Van Tricht, Theodore's {{actions were}} {{motivated}} by several factors, which led him to regard Peter <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>threat</b> <b>to</b> himself and his principality. Peter's attempt to return Dyrrhachium to Venice, {{even if it had}} failed for the moment, boded ill for the future. Peter's recognition of the rights of Demetrius' half-brother William VI of Montferrat over Thessalonica opened the way for William to take power there, and Theodore was loath to see Thessalonica—whose rulers still claimed suzerainty over Epirus—strengthened, particularly given the presence of his exiled nephew Michael II in the court of the Latin Principality of Achaea. At the same time, Theodore and his court resented the increased papal interference in Greek affairs, especially {{in the aftermath of the}} mission of Cardinal Pelagius, the previous papal legate to Constantinople, whose actions had deepened the rift between Greeks and Latins further.|$|E
5|$|After the lynchings {{of their}} {{prominent}} competitors, the WSGA's {{control over the}} range was undisputed, until a group of smaller ranchers led by a local cowboy named Nate Champion formed the Northern Wyoming Farmers and Stock Growers' Association (NWFSGA) {{to compete with the}} WSGA. Upon hearing this, the WSGA immediately viewed Champion's association <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>threat</b> <b>to</b> their hold on the stock interests. The WSGA then blacklisted members of the NWFSGA from the round-ups in order to stop their operations. However, the latter refused the orders to disband and instead publicly announced their plans to hold their own round-up in the spring of 1892.|$|E

5|$|As the {{hurricane}} turned northward and was seen <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>threat</b> <b>to</b> the Hawaiian Islands, {{officials in the}} Papahanaumokuakea requested that all 17personnel in the region be evacuated. Several days before the storm passed through the islands, an AC-130 aircraft was flown to the area and evacuated the people stationed on Tern Island, while a National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration vessel evacuated the temporary residents on Laysan Island. Hurricane Neki caused relatively little damage in the Papahanaumokuakea Marine National Monument. All of the structures were undamaged; however, two small natural habitat islands, Round and Disappearing Islands, were affected substantially. The former lost some land area and the latter was completely washed away.|$|E
5|$|Cambodian Rocks is a {{compilation}} of 22 uncredited, untitled Cambodian psychedelic and garage rock songs from the late 1960s and early 1970s. When the tracks were recorded, musicians in the thriving music scene were combining Western rock and pop genres with their own styles and techniques. When the Khmer Rouge {{came to power in}} 1975, artists were among those viewed <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>threat</b> <b>to</b> the regime's agrarian socialist vision, and several of the performers on the album are believed to have been among those killed during the ensuing Cambodian Genocide of 1975-1979. Little information about them or their creative output has survived.|$|E
5|$|Carl (Martin Sheen's character) {{represents}} {{the working class}} in the film: he is the union leader for the maintenance workers at Bluestar. He constantly attacks big business, money, mandatory drug screening, greedy manufacturers, and anything that he sees <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>threat</b> <b>to</b> his union. The conflict between Gekko's relentless pursuit of wealth and Carl Fox's leftward leanings {{form the basis of}} the film's subtext. This subtext could be described as the concept of the two fathers battling for control over the morals of the son, a concept Stone had also used in Platoon. In Wall Street the hard-working Carl Fox and the cutthroat businessman Gordon Gekko represent the fathers. The producers of the film use Carl as their voice in the film, a voice of reason amid the creative destruction brought about by Gekko's unrestrained personal philosophy.|$|E
