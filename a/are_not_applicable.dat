25|$|Due to its {{aromatic}} character, pyrrole {{is difficult}} to hydrogenate, does not easily react as a diene in Diels–Alder reactions, and does not undergo usual olefin reactions. Its reactivity {{is similar to that}} of benzene and aniline, in that it is easy to alkylate and acylate. Under acidic conditions, pyrroles polymerize easily, and thus many electrophilic reagents that are used in benzene chemistry <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>applicable</b> to pyrroles. In contrast, substituted pyrroles (including protected pyrroles) have been used in a broad range of transformations.|$|E

In India, as a whole, there are religion-specific civil codes that separately govern adherents of different religions.

25|$|Certain {{physical}} paradoxes defy {{common sense}} predictions about physical situations. In some cases, {{this is the}} result of modern physics correctly describing the natural world in circumstances which are far outside of everyday experience. For example, special relativity has traditionally yielded two common paradoxes: the twin paradox and the ladder paradox. Both of these paradoxes involve thought experiments which defy traditional common sense assumptions about time and space. In particular, the effects of time dilation and length contraction are used in both of these paradoxes to create situations which seemingly contradict each other. It turns out that the fundamental postulate of special relativity that the speed of light is invariant in all frames of reference requires that concepts such as simultaneity and absolute time <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>applicable</b> when comparing radically different frames of reference.|$|E
25|$|A study {{conducted}} by measuring the intraoral vapour levels over a 24-hour period in patients with at least nine amalgam restorations showed that the average daily dose of inhaled mercury vapour was 1.7 μg (range from 0.4 to 4.4 μg), which is approximately 1% of the threshold limit value of 300 to 500 μg/day established by the WHO, based on a maximum allowable environmental level of 50 μg/day in the workplace. Critics point out that: (1) the workplace safety standards are based on allowable maxima in the workplace, not mercury body burden; (2) the workplace safety numbers <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>applicable</b> to continuous 24-hour exposure, but are limited to a normal work day and a 40-hour workweek; and (3) the uptake/absorption numbers are averages and not worst-case patients (those most at risk).|$|E
