[...] The third child of Scottish {{business}} manager John Gibson and English born wife Ellen née Lawson, he was schooled at Melbourne Grammar and the University of Melbourne. He briefly studied art at the National Gallery of Victoria drawing school, but concluded that art was not his vocation. He said of that time that [...] "with little resistance I <b>allowed</b> <b>myself</b> <b>to</b> be guided into commercial fields".|$|E
500|$|... "Can't B Good" [...] {{was written}} and {{produced}} by D. DoRohn Gough and Ne-Yo. It was recorded between 2007 and 2008 at SouthSide Studios, in Atlanta, Georgia. Although Jackson didn't write the song, Jackson described [...] "Can't B Good" [...] as a song reflecting her seven-year relationship with songwriter/producer Jermaine Dupri, saying, [...] "I'd been hurt before, and I {{was trying to}} protect myself. I'm glad I <b>allowed</b> <b>myself</b> <b>to</b> accept it. He's very attentive and affectionate, a beautiful soul".|$|E
500|$|According to {{the sheet}} music {{published}} at Musicnotes.com by Alfred Publishing, {{the song is}} written in the key of G minor and is set in time signature of common time with a tempo of 115 beats per minute. Timbaland's bhangra beats are featured at the start {{and the end of}} the song. Madonna and Timberlake's vocal range spans two octaves, from F3 to Bb5. The song has a sequence of D–G–C–F–B–D in the verses and E5–D5–C5–D5 in the chorus, as its chord progression. The lyrics of [...] "4 Minutes" [...] carry a message of social awareness, inspired by Madonna's visit to Africa and the human suffering she witnessed. Jon Pareles of The New York Times stated that [...] "owever, the song sounds as if four minutes is the time taken for a song to be a guaranteed pop hit or the time required for a quickie; in reality it is the only song from Hard Candy album which contains a message of social awareness in it." [...] The sound of a clock ticking away emphasizes this message further. Madonna explained in New York magazine that the line [...] "The road to hell is paved with good intentions" [...] did not relate to her charity work. Instead it was her question to herself: [...] "Do I understand this opinion that I've adopted or this Zeitgeist that I've <b>allowed</b> <b>myself</b> <b>to</b> be swept up in? Because you could have the best intentions but not have enough information and make huge mistakes." [...] Regarding the line [...] "Sometimes I feel what I need is a you intervention", Madonna explained, [...] "eah, meaning, sometimes I think you need to save me." ...|$|E

2500|$|Van Gogh {{argued with}} Bernard and, especially, Paul Gauguin {{as to whether}} one should paint from nature, as Van Gogh preferred, or paint what Gauguin called [...] "abstractions": {{paintings}} conceived in the imagination, or de tête. In the letter to Bernard, Van Gogh recounted his experiences when Gauguin lived with him for nine weeks {{in the fall and}} winter of 1888: [...] "When Gauguin was in Arles, I once or twice <b>allowed</b> <b>myself</b> <b>to</b> be led astray into abstraction, as you know[...] [...] [...] But that was delusion, dear friend, and one soon comes up against a brick wall[...] [...] [...] And yet, once again I <b>allowed</b> <b>myself</b> <b>to</b> be led astray into reaching for stars that are too big—another failure—and I have had my fill of that." [...] Van Gogh here is referring to the expressionistic swirls which dominate the upper center portion of The Starry Night.|$|E
2500|$|After {{hearing from}} Verdi's publisher, Giovanni Ricordi, {{that he would}} like an {{assurance}} that no French copyright might exist (given that he'd heard about a French play on the same subject), Solera, in his response to the publisher, denied any assertion that Schiller's play was the source, and he claimed that the work was [...] "an entirely original Italian drama... I have not <b>allowed</b> <b>myself</b> <b>to</b> be imposed upon by the authority either of Schiller or Shakespeare...My play is original".|$|E

After trying to abduct his nephew Wiccan so he can assist him in finding his sister, he is stopped by {{his father and his}} other nephew, Speed. After Wiccan {{suggests}} that maybe Magneto actually did want to make up for his past, he became angry and said, [...] "Nephew the last time I <b>allowed</b> <b>myself</b> <b>to</b> believe that..... My father tried to kill me". Quicksilver prepares to fight his father but when debris from his rampage strikes his sister it is found that the Scarlet Witch there is actually a Doombot in disguise. The journey takes Quicksilver and his comrades all the way to Latveria so they rescue the Scarlet Witch. After the Scarlet Witch turns herself in to the X-Men and the Avengers a fight breaks out between the two groups. After being knocked out along with all the other Avengers and X-Men by his sister, he is finally reunited with his sister.|$|E

2500|$|Halep {{began the}} year as the Romanian No. 2, ranked No. 47 in the world, 20 places behind Sorana Cîrstea. Her first three tournaments, ASB Classic, Hobart International and Australian Open, ended in defeats. Her first major tournament {{breakthrough}} came at the Internazionali BNL d'Italia in May, gaining three of the biggest victories of her career. Halep defeated two-time Grand Slam champion Svetlana Kuznetsova, world No. 4 Agnieszka Radwańska, and two-time tournament champion and former world No. 1 Jelena Janković (but saved 2 match points) to reach the semifinals, where she was defeated soundly by eventual champion Serena Williams in straight sets. She later said that [...] "What changed was that I <b>allowed</b> <b>myself</b> <b>to</b> be relaxed on the court by taking the pressure off. I told myself to enjoy it and play with pleasure." [...] At the French Open, Halep suffered her second successive first-round exit at a Grand Slam, falling to Carla Suárez Navarro, despite taking the first set comfortably. She rebounded well, however, going on to win her first two WTA titles back-to-back, first at the Nürnberger Versicherungscup in June, where she defeated Andrea Petkovic in the final, {{and then at the}} Topshelf Open, where she defeated world No. 11 Roberta Vinci with the loss of just one game in the second round, before defeating Kirsten Flipkens in the final. She became the first Romanian tennis player to win back-to-back tournaments on different surfaces. She claimed her first Grand Slam match win of the year at Wimbledon, defeating Olga Govortsova of Belarus, before falling to Li Na in three sets. After Wimbledon, in July, Halep entered the top-30 rankings for the first time.|$|E
