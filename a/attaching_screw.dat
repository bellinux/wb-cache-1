40|$|Abstract — This paper {{considers}} {{the requirements for}} sta-ble control of simple devices that consist of a permanent magnet rigidly <b>attached</b> to a <b>screw</b> operating in soft tissue. Placing these devices in a rotating magnetic field causes the device’s permanent magnet to rotate synchronously with the applied field, making the <b>attached</b> <b>screw</b> generate forward propulsion. Although there has been significant {{research in the area}} of magnetic screws, this paper describes magnetic phenomena that have not been addressed in prior work, yet will be critical in the design of future steering and control strategies for medical applications. Using a time-averaged model of magnetic torque, we analyze the magnetic torque present when intentionally steering the screw or due to naturally occurring disturbances in the screw’s heading. We predict and experimentally demonstrate the existence of magnetic torques that simultaneously act to stabilize and destabilize magnetic screws operating in tissue. We find that there exists an applied field rotation speed, above which screws may become unstable, and we find that the interaction between the stabilizing and destabilizing magnetic torques may cause potentially undesired but predictable behavior while steering.

5000|$|As {{a solvent}} based plastic, {{celluloid}} tends to shrink over the years, making the pickguard curl around the edges. It puts extra {{stress on the}} wood beneath the pickguard and sometimes cracks appear. This is very common on older Martin acoustic guitars.

50|$|Length {{and size}} of screws holding the shelf to the wall differ {{depending}} on the material of the wall.

30|$|This {{study used}} a {{specially}} designed accuracy assessment phantom (Koivukangas 2012) to assess the accuracy of a commercial surgical navigator, the StealthStation S 7 (Medtronic Inc., Louisville, CO, USA). The navigator enabled the interchangeable use of both OTS and EMTS. The phantom consisted of three separate levels <b>attached</b> with <b>screws</b> to form the total reference volume. On each level a total of 49 accuracy assessment points were machined with 20 mm displacement between the beveled holes. This gave a specific region of surgical interest (ROSI) volume of 120 x 120 x 100 mm. The phantom was industrially verified at Oulu PMC using the Mitutoyo Strato 9166 (Mitutoyo, Japan) accuracy sensing device.
