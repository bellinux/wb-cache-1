5|$|First Great Western {{declined}} a {{contractual option}} {{to continue the}} Greater Western passenger franchise (of which services at Nailsea and Backwell are a part) beyond 2013, citing a desire for a longer-term contract due to the impending upgrade to the Great Western Main Line. The franchise was put out to tender, but the process was halted and later scrapped due to {{the fallout from the}} collapse of the InterCity West Coast franchise competition. A two-year franchise extension until September 2015 was agreed in October 2013, and subsequently extended until March 2019.

5|$|Later, Hill {{attacked}} both Fielding <b>and</b> <b>Smart,</b> 13 August 1752, in {{the only}} issue of The Impertinent to be produced. Although the work was published anonymously, it was commonly known that it was produced by Hill, and he soon followed up the pamphlet with his 25 August 1752 The Inspector column in the London Daily Advertiser. With the column, he harshly criticized Smart's Poems on Several Occasions. Fielding eventually left the dispute after the sixth issue of The Covent-Garden Journal was published.|$|E

5|$|Upon release, Conker's Bad Fur Day {{received}} {{critical acclaim}} from video game journalists, who praised its visual appeal <b>and</b> <b>smart,</b> funny humour.

5|$|In 2013, China led {{the world}} in {{renewable}} energy production, with a total capacity of 378 GW, mainly from hydroelectric and wind power. As of 2014, China leads {{the world in}} the production and use of wind power, solar photovoltaic power <b>and</b> <b>smart</b> grid technologies, generating almost as much water, wind and solar energy as all of France and Germany's power plants combined. China's renewable energy sector is growing faster than its fossil fuels and nuclear power capacity. Since 2005, production of solar cells in China has expanded 100-fold. As Chinese renewable manufacturing has grown, the costs of renewable energy technologies have dropped. Innovation has helped, but the main driver of reduced costs has been market expansion.|$|E

5|$|Peyton {{has noted}} that the {{distinct}} personalities of the series' characters meant that he considered some of them {{much more difficult to}} convincingly write for than others. He found Cooper to be particularly tricky to write for, as the character had an idiosyncratic view of the world which needed to be maintained; but found Audrey Horne to be his favourite to work on as he considered the character—and actress Sherilyn Fenn—to be both sexy <b>and</b> <b>smart,</b> and to have developed substantially as the series progressed. The character of Madeline Ferguson was named for characters in Alfred Hitchcock's 1958 film Vertigo—Kim Novak's Madeleine Elster and James Stewart's Scottie Ferguson. Ferguson's cousin, the murdered schoolgirl Laura Palmer, was similarly named after the titular character in Otto Preminger's 1944 film Laura; while other characters in the series would also be named for film noir characters.|$|E
5|$|The Spokane {{metropolitan}} area consists of Spokane County. As of the 2013 census estimates, the Spokane {{metropolitan area}} had {{a population of}} 535,724. Directly east of Spokane County is the Coeur d'Alene Metropolitan Statistical Area, which consists of Kootenai County, Idaho, anchored {{by the city of}} Coeur d'Alene. The urban areas of the two MSAs largely follow the path of Interstate 90 between Spokane and Coeur d'Alene. The Spokane area has suffered from suburbanization and urban sprawl in past decades, despite Washington's use of urban growth boundaries; the city ranks low among major Northwest cities in population density <b>and</b> <b>smart</b> growth. The Spokane and Coeur d'Alene Metropolitan Statistical Areas (MSA) are now included in a single Combined Statistical Area (CSA) by the Office of Management and Budget. The Spokane–Coeur d'Alene CSA had around 698,170residents in 2015.|$|E
5|$|The {{fortress}} {{was gradually}} modernised {{in the decades}} following the Second World War, including newer main artillery {{for some of the}} forts and newer secondary artillery for all forts as well as other improvements. But the development of new weapons and the evolution of warfare during the Cold War gradually decreased the importance of the fortifications. Weapons such as cruise missiles <b>and</b> <b>smart</b> bombs made large static fortifications such as Boden Fortress obsolete when they demonstrated their worth during the Gulf War in 1991. Mjösjöberget Fort had been decommissioned and removed from the wartime organisation twelve years earlier in 1979, and less than ten years after the Gulf War and the collapse of the Soviet Union, the four other forts followed suit. The last shot was fired from Rödberget on 14:11 local time on 31 December 1997, and exactly one year later, on 31 December 1998, that last fort was decommissioned after 90 years in service.|$|E

5|$|The {{legal status}} of {{psilocybin}} mushrooms varies worldwide. Psilocybin and psilocin are listed as Class A (United Kingdom) or Schedule I (US) drugs under the United Nations 1971 Convention on Psychotropic Substances. The possession and use of psilocybin mushrooms, including P.semilanceata, is therefore prohibited by extension. Although many European countries remained open to the use and possession of hallucinogenic mushrooms after the US ban, starting in the 2000s (decade) {{there has been a}} tightening of laws and enforcements. In The Netherlands, where the drug was once routinely sold in licensed cannabis coffee shops <b>and</b> <b>smart</b> shops, laws were instituted in October 2008 to prohibit the possession or sale of psychedelic mushrooms—the final European country to do so.|$|E
5|$|The Green Goblin is {{armed with}} a variety of bizarre devices. He wears a green costume {{underneath}} bulletproof chainmail with an overlapping purple tunic. His mask has a built-in gas filter to keep him safe from his own gasses. The Green Goblin's trademark weapons are his pumpkin bombs and razor bats. As their name suggests, the bombs were designed with the appearance of jack-o'-lanterns. These varied in function from smoke bombs to traditional explosives, while the razor edged bat-shaped boomerangs-could cut through very durable surfaces and materials. The gloves of the Goblin uniform were fashioned with minuscule conductors that allowed for the release of electricity at nearly 10,000 amps of an undetermined voltage. Originally, Osborn used a mechanical broomstick to fly through the air during his first few exploits as the Green Goblin. The Flying Broomstick did not last long, however, and was improved upon, creating the Goblin Glider. The Goblin Glider was a more efficient flight system than Norman's Flying Broomstick. The Glider allowed the Goblin to carry a wide array of armaments, including heat-seeking <b>and</b> <b>smart</b> missiles, machine guns, extending blades, a flamethrower and a pumpkin bomb dispenser/launcher with him as he flew and had much greater speed and mobility than the Broomstick.|$|E
