Western scholars <b>are</b> <b>hesitant</b> <b>to</b> designate such settlements as belonging to the Shang dynasty. Also unlike the Shang, there is no known evidence that the Sanxingdui culture had a system of writing.|$|E
25|$|ISO 22000 is a {{standard}} designed to help augment HACCP on issues related to food safety. Although several companies, especially big ones, have either implemented or are {{on the point of}} implementing ISO 22000, there are many others which <b>are</b> <b>hesitant</b> <b>to</b> do so. The main reason behind that is the lack of information and the fear that the new standard is too demanding in terms of bureaucratic work.|$|E
25|$|Lack of {{behavior}} change: Some communities have toilets, yet people prefer to defecate in the open. In some cases, these toilets {{are provided by}} the government or other organizations and the people do not like them, or do not value them. They continue to defecate in the open. Also, older people are often found to defecate in the open and they <b>are</b> <b>hesitant</b> <b>to</b> change their behavior and go inside a closed toilet.|$|E

25|$|Even {{though the}} U.S. offers {{protection}} for trafficking victims, few victims seek the government's aid due to fear of corruption, fear of deportation, or fear of reprisals with their family. Victims of trafficking may be citizens of countries with corrupt governments that actually aid trafficking. Where victims' home countries lack reliable police systems, trafficking victims <b>are</b> <b>hesitant</b> <b>to</b> {{reach out to}} the law for aid. Jessa Dillow Crisp was of many victims of human trafficking, who had encountered the police in her town to be corruptive and involved in the trafficking.|$|E
25|$|Adult {{tarantula}} hawks are nectarivorous. The {{consumption of}} fermented fruit sometimes intoxicates {{them to the}} point that flight becomes difficult. While the wasps tend to be most active in daytime summer months, they tend to avoid high temperatures. The male tarantula hawk does not hunt; instead, it feeds off the flowers of milkweeds, western soapberry trees, or mesquite trees (females feed on these same plants, as well). Male tarantula hawks have been observed practicing a behavior called hill-topping, in which they sit atop tall plants and watch for passing females ready to reproduce. Females are not very aggressive, in that they <b>are</b> <b>hesitant</b> <b>to</b> sting, but the sting is extraordinarily painful.|$|E
25|$|Stigma {{has been}} {{associated}} with HIV in Jamaica {{since the beginning of the}} epidemic, partly because of its association with male homosexuality. Jamaican men, in particular, are so concerned about being associated with homosexuality that they <b>are</b> <b>hesitant</b> <b>to</b> seek HIV treatment and prevention services. Poor men living with HIV are assumed to have participated in same-sex sexual acts, and poor men who participate in those acts are assumed to be HIV positive. Some people in Jamaica become suicidal when they first receive their HIV diagnosis, rooted in the fear of isolation and discrimination that will result from others finding out and not from the potential of death associated with it. HIV is a reportable disease, resulting in a visit by a contact investigator who asks for the names of sexual partners.|$|E

25|$|According to the Deloitte 2007 Holiday Survey, for {{the fourth}} {{straight}} year, gift cards {{are expected to be}} the top gift purchase in 2007, with more than two-thirds (69 percent) of consumers surveyed planning to buy them, compared with 66 percent in 2006. In addition, holiday shoppers are planning to buy even more cards this year: an average of 5.5 cards, compared with the 4.6 cards they planned to buy last year. One in six consumers (16 percent) plan to buy 10 or more cards, compared with 11 percent last year. Consumers are also spending more in total on gift cards and more per card: $36.25 per card on average compared with $30.22 last year. Gift cards continue to grow in acceptance: Almost four in 10 consumers surveyed (39 percent) would rather get a gift card than merchandise, an increase from last year’s 35 percent. Also, resistance to giving gift cards continues to decline: 19 percent say they don’t like to give gift cards because they’re too impersonal (down from 22 percent last year). Consumers said that the cards are popular gifts for adults, teens and children alike, and almost half (46 percent) intend to buy them for immediate family; however, they <b>are</b> <b>hesitant</b> <b>to</b> buy them for spouses or significant others, with only 14 percent saying they plan to buy them for those recipients.|$|E
25|$|The {{presence}} of claim jumpers {{is seen as}} problematic by some regulars in the lower series, who complain about more accomplished Cup drivers taking the top prize money and thus leading to loss of sponsorship for their efforts. Cup drivers often run in cars fielded by or affiliated with their Cup Series teams, giving them superior equipment and increased resources. The {{presence of}} the Cup teams have driven up the costs of competition, forcing many independent Nationwide Series teams to shut their doors. Many sponsors <b>are</b> <b>hesitant</b> <b>to</b> put financial backing behind an unproven driver, insisting that Cup drivers run in {{at least part of}} the schedule, which has led to several incidents of young drivers receiving part-time schedules or being pulled from an entry before (or during) a race in favor of a Cup driver. In 2008, for example, Kelly Bires was forced to sit out the Daytona season opener due to contractual obligations with JR Motorsports' sponsor Unilever stating that Dale Earnhardt Jr. drive a certain number of races for the team. Other criticisms of Buschwacking cite the lack of Busch Series veterans left in the series. Long-time series regulars and champions (such as Steve Grissom, David Green, Randy LaJoie, Jason Keller, Casey Atwood, and Ashton Lewis, Jr.) have seen their exit from the series in the 2000s, while 2000 champion Jeff Green has driven primarily in start and park entries since 2011.|$|E
500|$|The story {{takes place}} during three years (1933–35) of the Great Depression in the fictional [...] "tired old town" [...] of Maycomb, Alabama, {{the seat of}} Maycomb County. It focuses on six-year-old Jean Louise Finch (nicknamed Scout), who lives with her older brother, Jeremy (nicknamed Jem), and their widowed father, Atticus, a middle-aged lawyer. Jem and Scout befriend a boy named Dill, who visits Maycomb to stay with his aunt each summer. The three {{children}} are terrified yet fascinated by their neighbor, the reclusive Arthur [...] "Boo" [...] Radley. The adults of Maycomb <b>are</b> <b>hesitant</b> <b>to</b> talk about Boo, and few of them have seen him for many years. [...] The children feed one another's imagination with rumors about his appearance and reasons for remaining hidden, and they fantasize {{about how to get}} him out of his house. After two summers of friendship with Dill, Scout and Jem find that someone leaves them small gifts in a tree outside the Radley place. Several times the mysterious Boo makes gestures of affection to the children, but, to their disappointment, he never appears in person.|$|E

500|$|In her {{analysis}} of the fish, MacDonald asserts that it represents {{the voice of the}} children's absent mother. Its conflict with the Cat, not only over the Cat's uninvited presence but also their inherent predator-prey relationship, provides the tension of the story. She points out that on the last page, while the children <b>are</b> <b>hesitant</b> <b>to</b> tell their mother about what happened in her absence, the fish gives a knowing look to the readers to assure them [...] "that something did go on but that silence is the better part of valor in this case". Alison Lurie agrees, writing, [...] "there is a strong suggestion that they might not tell her." [...] She argues that, in the Cat's destruction of the house, [...] "the kidsand not only those in the story, but those who read ithave vicariously given full rein to their destructive impulses without guilt or consequences." [...] For a 1983 article, Geisel told Jonathan Cott, [...] "The Cat in the Hat is a revolt against authority, but it's ameliorated {{by the fact that the}} Cat cleans up everything at the end. It's revolutionary in that it goes as far as Kerensky and then stops. It doesn't go quite as far as Lenin." ...|$|E

2500|$|Similarly, on December 8, 2011, the EDRO III ran aground off {{the coast}} of Cyprus.

2500|$|Significant {{portions}} of the increases in Russia's military procurement budget are being eaten up by inflation: while the country's overall inflation rate in 2008 was 13%, in certain weapon categories the figure was more than 30%. Many skilled workers are nearing retirement age, and young graduates <b>are</b> <b>hesitant</b> <b>to</b> enter the industry due to low wages and insufficient career opportunities. In 2009, a senior official said that the Russian military industry had effectively [...] "reached its ceiling" [...] and could not take on any more orders. Further growth will require a serious upgrade of production facilities, as well as investment in skills and training. Yury Solomonov, chief designer of the Topol-M and Bulava ICBMs, has said that Russia is 10–15 years ahead of its rivals {{in the development of}} strategic nuclear weapons, but 30 years behind in the development of conventional arms. After collapse of the Soviet Union, Russia's nuclear shipbuilding industry has been transformed into something much smaller. Key enterprises on the Black Sea coast appeared to be on the territory of now-independent Ukraine - which proclaimed non-nuclear status. Admittedly, these enterprises {{had little to do with}} nuclear propulsion technology, except for some ambitions in the late 1980s when the Soviet navy planned the construction of nuclear-powered aircraft carriers. Russian defence industry proved unequal to the challenge of manufacturing battleships and other BMP-3, BMD heavy combatants T-90 tanks, artillery, missiles, space technology, nuclear technology even lack of funds from state.|$|E
