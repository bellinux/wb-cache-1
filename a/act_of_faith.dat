25|$|Adventists {{do not see}} the Sabbath as a works-based doctrine, {{but rather}} righteousness comes solely through faith in Christ alone. The Sabbath commandment is seen as an <b>act</b> <b>of</b> <b>faith</b> in God's ideal for the believer, {{although}} its significance may not be seen by non-believers.|$|E
25|$|Catholic {{spirituality is}} the spiritual {{practice}} of living out a personal <b>act</b> <b>of</b> <b>faith</b> (fides qua creditur) following {{the acceptance of}} faith (fides quae creditur). Although all Catholics are expected to pray together at Mass, {{there are many different}} forms of spirituality and private prayer which have developed over the centuries. Each of the major religious orders of the Catholic Church and other lay groupings have their own unique spirituality - its own way of approaching God in prayer and in living out the Gospel.|$|E
25|$|Macquarie grew {{during the}} seventies and eighties with rapid {{expansion}} in courses offered, student numbers {{and development of}} the site. In 1972, the university established the Macquarie Law School, the third law school in Sydney. In their book Liberality of Opportunity, Bruce Mansfield and Mark Hutchinson describe the founding of Macquarie University as 'an <b>act</b> <b>of</b> <b>faith</b> and a great experiment'. An additional topic considered in this book is the science reform movement of the late 1970s that resulted in the introduction of a named science degree, thus facilitating the subsequent inclusion of other named degrees in addition to the traditional BA.|$|E

25|$|A {{prayer of}} {{petition}} is {{a request to}} God that asks him to fulfill a need. By prayer of petition, Catholics acknowledge their dependence on God. This expression {{is not intended to}} instruct or direct God what to do, but to appeal to his goodness for the things we need; and the appeal is necessary, not because He is ignorant of our needs or sentiments, but to give definite form to our desires, to concentrate our whole attention on what we have to recommend to him, to help us appreciate our close personal relation with him. The expression need not be external or vocal; internal or mental is sufficient. The prayer of petition is at its heart an <b>Act</b> <b>of</b> <b>Faith</b> in that the one praying must believe first, in the existence of God; and second, that God is both willing and able to grant the petition. The Catechism states that asking forgiveness, coupled with trusting humility, should be the first movement of a prayer of petition. Jesus said to bring our every need to God in his name and assures that “whatever you ask the Father in my name he will give you.” (John 16:23) Through petition one can ask for God's help with every need no matter how great or small. According to the Catechism, Christ is glorified by what we ask the Father in his name.|$|E
25|$|At its core, the Tanakh is {{an account}} of the Israelites' {{relationship}} with God from their earliest history until the building of the Second Temple (c. 535 BCE). Abraham is hailed as the first Hebrew and the father of the Jewish people. As a reward for his <b>act</b> <b>of</b> <b>faith</b> in one God, he was promised that Isaac, his second son, would inherit the Land of Israel (then called Canaan). Later, the descendants of Isaac's son Jacob were enslaved in Egypt, and God commanded Moses to lead the Exodus from Egypt. At Mount Sinai, they received the Torah—the five books of Moses. These books, together with Nevi'im and Ketuvim are known as Torah Shebikhtav as opposed to the Oral Torah, which refers to the Mishnah and the Talmud. Eventually, God led them to the land of Israel where the tabernacle was planted in the city of Shiloh for over 300 years to rally the nation against attacking enemies. As time went on, the spiritual level of the nation declined to the point that God allowed the Philistines to capture the tabernacle. The people of Israel then told Samuel the prophet that they needed to be governed by a permanent king, and Samuel appointed Saul to be their King. When the people pressured Saul into going against a command conveyed to him by Samuel, God told Samuel to appoint David in his stead.|$|E
500|$|The {{launching}} of PAVN's Nguyen Hue Offensive in April 1972 {{had the effect}} of returning major American air assets to the theater and eventually increased the tempo of operations in northeastern Laos. As a result, Royal Lao armed forces, Hmong, and Thai mercenaries went on the offensive, as did PAVN and the Pathet Lao, all of whom wished to become [...] "well postured for the peace negotiations." [...] Although there was no provision for a Laotian cease-fire written into the Paris Peace Accord that was signed on 27 January 1973, it had been verbally agreed between the U.S. and North Vietnamese representatives that one would be instituted within 15 days of the signing of the agreement. The fates of Laos and Cambodia were disposed of in Article 20 of the agreement, in which the North Vietnamese and the U.S. promised to respect the neutrality of both nations and to end their military intervention. Unfortunately, there was no means by which to enforce the agreement. That the North Vietnamese would uphold it, after violating two previous neutrality accords, [...] "took optimism bordering on an <b>act</b> <b>of</b> <b>faith</b> that they would now abandon the ambitions and struggles of thirty years because of a clumsily drafted afterthought in a document they had no intention of honoring anyway." ...|$|E

500|$|Churches of Christ {{consistently}} {{teach that}} in baptism a believer surrenders {{his life in}} faith and obedience to God, and that God [...] "by the merits of Christ's blood, cleanses one from sin and truly changes {{the state of the}} person from an alien to a citizen of God's kingdom. Baptism is not a human work; it is the place where God does the work that only God can do." [...] Baptism is a passive <b>act</b> <b>of</b> <b>faith</b> rather than a meritorious work; it [...] "is a confession that a person has nothing to offer God". While Churches of Christ do not describe baptism as a [...] "sacrament", their view of it can legitimately be described as [...] "sacramental". They see the power of baptism coming from God, who chose to use baptism as a vehicle, rather than from the water or the act itself, and understand baptism to {{be an integral part of}} the conversion process, rather than as only a symbol of conversion. A recent trend is to emphasize the transformational aspect of baptism: instead of describing it as nothing more than a legal requirement or sign of something that happened in the past, it is seen as [...] "the event that places the believer 'into Christ' where God does the ongoing work of transformation". There is a minority that downplays the importance of baptism in order to avoid sectarianism, but the broader trend is to [...] "reexamine the richness of the Biblical teaching of baptism and to reinforce its central and essential place in Christianity".|$|E
500|$|McKellen has {{appeared}} in limited release films, such as Emile (which was shot in three weeks following the X2 shoot), Neverwas and Asylum. He appeared as Sir Leigh Teabing in The Da Vinci Code. During a 17 May 2006 interview on The Today Show with the Da Vinci Code cast and director, Matt Lauer posed a question to the group about how they would have felt if the film had borne a prominent disclaimer {{that it is a}} work of fiction, as some religious groups wanted. McKellen responded, [...] "I've often thought the Bible should have a disclaimer in the front saying 'This is fiction.' I mean, walking on water? It takes... an <b>act</b> <b>of</b> <b>faith.</b> And I have faith in this movie– not that it's true, not that it's factual, but that it's a jolly good story." [...] He continued, [...] "And I think audiences are clever enough and bright enough to separate out fact and fiction, and discuss the thing when they've seen it". McKellen appeared in the 2006 BBC series of Ricky Gervais' comedy series Extras, where he played himself directing Gervais' character Andy Millman in a play about gay lovers. McKellen received a 2007 Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Guest Actor - Comedy Series nomination for his performance. In 2009 he portrayed Number Two in The Prisoner, a remake of the 1967 cult series The Prisoner. In 2013, McKellen co-starred in the ITV sitcom Vicious as Freddie Thornhill, alongside Derek Jacobi. The series revolves around an elderly gay couple who have been together for 50 years. On 23 August 2013 the show was renewed for a six-episode second series which began airing in June 2015.|$|E

This view is maintained, among others, by the Scottish statesman Arthur Balfour in his book The Foundations of Belief (1895). The opinions set forth in this work were adopted in France by Ferdinand Brunetière, the editor of the Revue des deux Mondes.

40|$|The {{basic premise}} {{of this article}} is that {{meditation}} on the psalms leads us to look at them from a liturgical perspective.

This article illustrates the way the psalms provide the building material for various liturgical procedures. We shall be reading Psalm 24 very attentively with a view to sermon writing. This article is dedicated to the memory of the late Prof W S Prinsloo, an outstanding reader and exegete of the psalms. Continued 2001 as 'Verbum et Ecclesia'[URL]...|$|R
