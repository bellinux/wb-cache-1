The study was based on three on-site large volume solid phase extracted water samples collected upstream and downstream of the untreated wastewater discharge. Chemical screening with liquid chromatography high resolution mass spectrometry (LC-HRMS) was applied together with a battery of in vitro cell-based bioassays covering important steps of the cellular toxicity pathway to evaluate effects on the activation of metabolism (arylhydrocarbon receptor AhR, peroxisome proliferator activated receptor gamma PPARγ), specific modes of action (estrogen receptor ERα, androgen receptor AR) and adaptive stress responses (oxidative stress, inflammation). Increased effects, significantly changed contamination patterns and higher chemical concentrations were observed downstream of the wastewater discharge. A mass balance approach showed that enhanced endocrine disruption was in good agreement with concentrations of detected hormones, while only a smaller fraction of the effects on xenobiotic metabolism (< 1 %) and adaptive stress responses (0 – 12 %) could be explained by the detected chemicals. The chemical and effects patterns observed upstream of the discharge point were fairly re-established at about 7 km downstream, demonstrating the enormous dilution capacity of this large river.

40|$|Lough Gowna, {{located on}} the borders of Counties Cavan and Longford is an {{important}} coarse fish angling lake, and also has stocks of brown trout. The lake attracts thousands of British, European and local anglers and has been the venue for the All Ireland Course Angling Competition. Lough Gowna is popular for swimming, water skiing and power boat racing. The lake is also used for abstraction of public water supplies by Longford and Cavan County Councils. Suitable water quality criteria to protect the above mentioned uses are; (i) EC (Quality of Salmonid Waters) Regulations, 1988. (ii) EC (Quality of Surface Water Intended for the <b>Abstraction</b> <b>of</b> <b>Drinking</b> <b>Water)</b> Regulations, 1989. The water quality monitoring data complied by Cavan and Longford County Councils, the E. P. A. and the Northern Regional Fisheries Board is reviewed and compared with studies {{carried out in the}} 1970 ’s and 1980 ’s by An Foras Forbartha. High phosphorus and chlorophyll a concentrations and very low transparency levels together with the dominance of blue-green algae in the phytoplankton indicate the lake is eutrophic. Stratification of the lake in the summer months gives rise to severe deoxygenation in the hypolimnion. “Excessive” and “permissible” annual phosphorus loadings for Lough Gowna were calculated using Vollenweider’s equation (Vollenweider 1976). The “permissible” annual loading of phosphorus is 174 mg P rh 2 yr' 1 and the “excessive” annual loading is 349 mg P m 2 yr" 1; this corresponds to 2. 24 tonnes P and 4. 5 tonnes P respectively. The actual orthophosphorus loading is 527 mg P m 2 yr" 1. This is calculated from average lake orthophosphorus concentrations using another equation by Vollenweider (Vollenweider 1980).

40|$|Cryptosporidium and Giardia are two {{important}} pathogenic parasites that have caused many waterborne outbreaks which affected {{hundreds of thousands}} of people. Contamination from effluent discharged by sewage treatment plants have been implicated in previous waterborne outbreaks of Cryptosporidium and Giardia. This study evaluated the reduction of Cryptospotidium and Giardia (oo) cysts in two sewage treatment plants (STPA and STPB) in Malaysia which employed different treatment processes for a period of a year. Raw sewage influents and treated sewage effluents were concentrated by repeated centrifugation, subjected to sucrose density flotation and concentrated to a minimal volume depending upon the levels of contaminating debris. Cryptosporidium oocysts and Giardia cysts were enumerated using epifluorescence microscopy. The parasite concentrations in raw sewage were 18 - 8480 of Giardia cysts/litre and 1 - 80 of Cryptosporidium oocysts/litre. In treated sewage, the concentration of parasites ranged from 1 - 1462 cysts/litre and 20 - 80 oocysts/ litre for Giardia and Cryptosporidium respectively. Statistical analysis showed that sewage treatment process which employed extended aeration could reduce the concentration of Cryptosporidium and Giardia (oo) cysts significantly but treatment process which encompasses aerated lagoon could only reduce the concentration of Giardia cysts but not Cryptosporidium oocysts significantly. This phenomenon is of great concern in areas whereby effluent of sewage treatment plants is discharged into the upstream of rivers that are eventually used for <b>abstraction</b> <b>of</b> <b>drinking</b> <b>water.</b> Therefore, it is important that wastewater treatment authorities rethink the relevance of Cryptosporidium and Giardia contamination levels in wastewater and watersheds and to develop countermeasures in wastewater treatment plants.

40|$|The {{need for}} {{coordination}} Coastal zones are complex areas {{with a highly}} specific natural character. As a contact zone between land and sea they possess an exceptional diversity of environments, biotic communities, and animal- and plant species. Coastal areas are, owing to their specific characteristics, also very attractive, commercially, {{for the development of}} coastal-related economic activities, e. g. port development, fishing, the <b>abstraction</b> <b>of</b> <b>drinking</b> <b>water</b> in the sand dunes, tourism and recreation. All of these activities lead to a highly dynamic coastal region. Examples of these regional dynamics include mobility, construction activities, street furniture and signage, and other public infrastructure. Because of the key role the coast fulfils of being a place to work, live and relax in, adequate standards of safety must be ensured as well. And that implies a well-conceived system of coastal protection. Since numerous activities take place on that 65 km-long coastline, disputes arise, inevitably, between the users of the seaboard. But precisely because of those multitudinous users, there are many unique opportunities out there too, which have to be seized in an acceptable way. To keep all this on the right track a well thought tuning is needed. Which is why three partners submitted a project proposal to establish and develop a coordination centre for a fully-integrated management of our coastal zone. The coordination centre is meant to be a neutral point of contact in the coastal zone. The partners are:-the provincial government of West Flanders, acting as project leader;-the Flemish government, for the account of the Flemish Minister for the Environment and in its role as chairman of an inter-ministerial steering committee on Integrated Coastal Zone Management (ICZM);-the Flanders Marine Institute (VLIZ); as a data- and information centre. Objectives of the coordination centre In order to steer integrated management on the Belgian coast in the right direction, the coordination centre has, as its object, the following key tasks:-to promote the integration of planning and policy of the sectors and policy-making levels by monitoring new developments in planning and policy, and by playing a part, in an advisory capacity, during the realization thereof. The intended result is a better attunement of planning and policy between the respective players on the coast and a sustainable approach to coastal development. -to foster cooperation between the policy-making levels and sectors via consultative meetings, and by citing, as much as possible, initiatives at other levels or in other sectors and by actively encouraging cooperation. -to act as an (international) point of contact for Integrated Coastal Zone ManagementThe aim of the coordination centre is to serve as a central point of contact for the various levels of government and other key players on the coast and to offer every private individual, agency or government body the opportunity, via a centralized forum, to ask coast-related questions. -to monitor international and European developments in Integrated Coastal Zone Management by participating in coastal forums or other consultative platforms on coastal zone management. In addition to these four key tasks, the coordination centre will also:-monitor significant activities that serve to develop the coast and try and shed light on the motives thereof within an overall strategy of sustainable development;-keep a record of the data and then, out of that, distil a set of effective sustainability indicators for the coastal zone; -keep an up-to-date inventory of ongoing and new projects and initiatives in the coastal zone; commission others to make goal-oriented studies;-communicate about integrated management at the Belgian coast.
