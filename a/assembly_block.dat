40|$|Top-Down (Metabolic) Control Analysis (TDCA) {{was used}} to examine, quantitatively, lipid {{biosynthesis}} in tissue cultures from two commercially important oil crops, olive (Olea europaea L.) and oil palm (Elaeis guineensis Jacq.). A conceptually simplified system was defined comprising two blocks of reactions: fatty acid synthesis (Block A) and lipid <b>assembly</b> (<b>Block</b> B), which produced and consumed, respectively, a common and unique system intermediate, cytosolic acyl-CoA. We manipulated the steady-state levels of the system intermediate by adding exogenous oleic acid and, using two independent assays, measured {{the effect of the}} addition on the system fluxes (J(A) and J(B)). These were the rate of incorporation of radioactivity: (i) through Block A from [1 -(14) C]acetate into fatty acids and (ii) via Block B from [U-(14) C]glycerol into complex lipids respectively. The data showed that fatty acid formation (Block A) exerted higher control than lipid <b>assembly</b> (<b>Block</b> B) in both tissues with the following group flux control coefficients (C) :(i) Oil palm: *C(J(TL)) (BlkA) = 0. 64 +/- 0. 05 and *C(J(TL)) (BlkB) = 0. 36 +/- 0. 05 (ii) Olive: *C(J(TL)) (BlkA) = 0. 57 +/- 0. 10 and *C(J(TL)) (BlkB) = 0. 43 +/- 0. 10 where *C indicates the group flux control coefficient over the lipid biosynthesis flux (J(TL)) and the subscripts BlkA and BlkB refer to defined blocks of the system, Block A and Block B. Nevertheless, because both parts of the lipid biosynthetic pathway exert significant flux control, we suggest strongly that manipulation of single enzyme steps will not affect product yield appreciably. The present study represents the first use of TDCA to examine the overall lipid biosynthetic pathway in any tissue, and its findings are of immediate academic and economic relevance to the yield and nutritional quality of oil crops...|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe {{vaccinia virus}} E 6 R gene (VACVWR 062) is conserved in {{all members of}} the {{poxvirus}} family and encodes a protein associated with the mature virion. We confirmed this association and provided evidence for an internal location. An inducible mutant that conditionally expresses E 6 was constructed. In the absence of inducer, plaque formation and virus production were severely inhibited in several cell lines, whereas some replication occurred in others. This difference could be due to variation in the stringency of repression, since we could not isolate a stable deletion mutant even in the more “permissive” cells. Under non-permissive conditions, viral late proteins were synthesized but processing of core proteins was inefficient, indicative of an <b>assembly</b> <b>block.</b> Transmission electron microscopy of sections of cells infected with the mutant in the absence of inducer revealed morphogenetic defects with crescents and empty immature virions adjacent to dense inclusions of viroplasm.

40|$|SummaryThe endosomal sorting {{complexes}} {{required for}} transport (ESCRTs) constitute hetero-oligomeric machines that mediate topologically similar membrane-sculpting processes, including cytokinesis, retroviral egress, and multivesicular body (MVB) biogenesis. Although ESCRT-III drives membrane remodeling that creates MVBs, its {{structure and the}} mechanism of vesicle formation are unclear. Using electron microscopy, we visualize an ESCRT-II:ESCRT-III supercomplex and propose how it mediates vesicle formation. We define conformational changes that activate ESCRT-III subunit Snf 7 and show that it assembles into spiraling ∼ 9  nm protofilaments on lipid monolayers. A high-content flow cytometry assay further demonstrates that mutations halting ESCRT-III <b>assembly</b> <b>block</b> ESCRT function. Strikingly, the addition of Vps 24 and Vps 2 transforms flat Snf 7 spirals into membrane-sculpting helices. Finally, we show that ESCRT-II and ESCRT-III coassemble into ∼ 65  nm diameter rings indicative of a cargo-sequestering supercomplex. We propose that ESCRT-III has distinct architectural stages that are modulated by ESCRT-II to mediate cargo capture and vesicle formation by ordered assembly...|$|E

HIV- 1 -infected mouse cells that express transfected human cyclin T 1 synthesize abundant Gag precursor polyprotein, but inefficiently assemble and release virions. This assembly defect may result from {{a failure of the}} Gag polyprotein precursor to target to the cell membrane. Plasma membrane targeting of the precursor is mediated by the amino-terminal region of polyprotein. To compensate for the <b>assembly</b> <b>block,</b> we substituted the murine leukemia virus matrix coding sequences into an infectious HIV- 1 clone. Transfection of murine fibroblasts expressing cyclin T 1 with the chimeric proviruses resulted in viruses that were efficiently assembled and released. Chimeric viruses, in which the cytoplasmic tail of the transmembrane subunit, gp 41, was truncated to prevent potential interference between the envelope glycoprotein and the heterologous matrix, could infect human and murine cells. They failed to further replicate in the murine cells, but replicated with delayed kinetics in human MT- 4 cells. These findings may be useful for establishing a murine model for HIV- 1 replication...|$|E

An extensive dimerization interface, using almost a quarter of the solvent accessible surface, and key salt bridge interactions explain the stability of the dimer.

Cells from four patients affected with non-myeloma secondary amyloidosis were also studied as controls. In primary amyloidosis, monoclonal plasma cell populations were demonstrated by immunofluorescence {{in virtually every}} case, even in patients without serum and urine monoclonal immunoglobulin and with a normal percentage of bone marrow plasma cells. Biosynthesis experiments showed the secretion of large amounts of free light chains, most often of the lambda type, in every primary or myeloma amyloidosis case {{and the presence of}} light chain fragments in almost all cases. Special features in certain patients were the synthesis of short gamma chains (two cases), <b>assembly</b> <b>block</b> at the HL half molecule level of a monoclonal IgA (one case) and secretion of decameric abnormally large kappa chains (one case). This is in contrast with non-myelomatous secondary amyloidosis where the distribution of bone marrow plasma cells was normal by immunofluorescence and where normal sized immunoglobulins were synthesized, without free light chain secretion and fragments.

40|$|Vibrio cholerae has {{a single}} polar {{sheathed}} flagellum that propels the cells of this bacterium. Flagellar synthesis, motility, and chemotaxis have all been linked to virulence in this human pathogen. V. cholerae expresses flagellar genes in a hierarchy consisting of σ 54 - and σ 28 -dependent transcription. In other bacteria, σ 28 transcriptional activity is controlled by an anti-σ 28 factor, FlgM. We demonstrate that the V. cholerae FlgM homologue (i) physically interacts with σ 28, (ii) has a repressive effect on some V. cholerae σ 28 -dependent flagellar promoters, and (iii) is secreted through the polar sheathed flagellum, consistent with anti-σ 28 activity. Interestingly, FlgM {{does not have a}} uniform repressive effect on all σ 28 -dependent promoters, as determined by measurement of σ 28 -dependent transcription in cells either lacking FlgM (ΔflgM) or incapable of secretion (ΔfliF). Further analysis of a ΔfliF strain revealed that this flagellar <b>assembly</b> <b>block</b> causes a decrease in class III (FlrC- and σ 54 -dependent) and class IV (σ 28 -dependent), but not class II (FlrA- and σ 54 -dependent), flagellar transcription.

40|$|AbstractThis study {{provides}} the initial biochemical, microscopic, and genetic {{characterization of the}} product of the vaccinia virus E 10 R gene, which belongs to the ERV 1 /ALR family of eukaryotic proteins, is conserved in all poxviruses and has homologs in other cytoplasmic DNA viruses. DNA encoding a short epitope tag was appended to the C-terminus of the 95 -amino-acid open-reading frame without affecting virus reproduction. The E 10 R protein was synthesized after DNA replication and was associated with purified intracellular mature virions (IMV), from which it could be extracted with a nonionic detergent. Antibody to the tag decorated the surface of IMV, consistent with the anchorage of the E 10 R protein to the membrane via its hydrophobic N-terminus. Immunoelectron microscopy revealed that the E 10 R protein was associated with crescent membranes, immature virions, IMV, and extracellular particles. To investigate the role of E 10 R in the virus life cycle, we constructed an inducer-dependent null mutant. In the absence of inducer, the formation of infectious virus was severely inhibited and electron microscopy revealed an <b>assembly</b> <b>block</b> with accumulation of crescent membranes and immature virions.
