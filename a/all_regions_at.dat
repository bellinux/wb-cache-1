40|$|Nineteen subpopulations of {{polar bears}} (Ursus maritimus) are found {{throughout}} the circumpolar Arctic, and in all regions they depend on sea ice as a platform for traveling, hunting, and breeding. Therefore polar bear phenology – the cycle of biological events – {{is linked to the}} timing of sea-ice retreat in spring and advance in fall. We analyzed the dates of sea-ice retreat and advance in all 19 polar bear subpopulation regions from 1979 to 2014, using daily sea-ice concentration data from satellite passive microwave instruments. We define the dates of sea-ice retreat and advance in a region as the dates when the area of sea ice drops below a certain threshold (retreat) {{on its way to the}} summer minimum or rises above the threshold (advance) on its way to the winter maximum. The threshold is chosen to be halfway between the historical (1979 – 2014) mean September and mean March sea-ice areas. In all 19 regions there is a trend toward earlier sea-ice retreat and later sea-ice advance. Trends generally range from − 3 to − 9  days decade − 1 in spring and from + 3 to + 9  days decade − 1 in fall, with larger trends in the Barents Sea and central Arctic Basin. The trends are not sensitive to the threshold. We also calculated the number of days per year that the sea-ice area exceeded the threshold (termed ice-covered days) and the average sea-ice concentration from 1 June through 31 October. The number of ice-covered days is declining in <b>all</b> <b>regions</b> <b>at</b> the rate of − 7 to − 19  days decade − 1, with larger trends in the Barents Sea and central Arctic Basin.

This study, carried out in French Guiana where malaria is endemic, evaluated the value and the limitations of a non-specific alert system including all patients admitted to the emergency department of Cayenne Hospital, between 1 January 1996 and June 2001. Four indices were studied on a weekly basis: the emergency malaria negative index (EMN), the EMN thrombocytopenia index (EMNT), the dengue suspected index: EMNT/EMN ratio; {{and the number of}} hospitalized patients with dengue fever according to the Department of Medical Information.

40|$|Distributed {{optimization}} {{has attracted}} lots {{of attention in}} the operation of power systems in recent years, where a large area is decomposed into smaller control regions each solving a local optimization problem with periodic information exchange with neighboring regions. However, most distributed optimization methods are iterative and require synchronization of <b>all</b> <b>regions</b> <b>at</b> each iteration, which is hard to achieve without a centralized coordinator and might lead to under-utilization of computation resources due to the heterogeneity of the regions. To address such limitations of synchronous schemes, this paper investigates the applicability of asynchronous distributed optimization methods to power system optimization. Particularly, we focus on solving the AC Optimal Power Flow problem and propose an algorithmic framework based on the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM) method that allows the regions to perform local updates with information received from a subset of but not all neighbors. Through experimental studies, we demonstrate that the convergence performance of the proposed asynchronous scheme is dependent on the communication delay of passing messages among the regions. Under mild communication delays, the proposed scheme can achieve comparable or even faster convergence compared with its synchronous counterpart, which {{can be used as a}} good alternative to centralized or synchronous distributed optimization approaches.

30|$|Images {{from the}} first day, {{acquired}} 60 [*]min post-injection and reconstructed following EARL settings were assessed by three experienced observers (AB, RB, WN). The observers were blind to these conditions {{and did not know}} what images were being assessed. These images were chosen for their compliance with EANM Guidelines for NSCLC studies [22]. The observers performed segmentations assisted by the same in-house developed software used for the semi-automatic delineations. A whole-body automatic delineation of all [18 F]FDG avid regions of the PET images was drawn using the SUV 40 method, then the observers had to remove any region they considered to be physiological uptake and not a lesion. Next, the observers could add any region perceived as lesion that was missed by the automatic method. The SUV threshold for the delineations was adjusted with a slider, fine-tuning the segmentation of <b>all</b> <b>regions</b> <b>at</b> once. This procedure was repeated after 12 (AB), 7 (RB), and 13 (WN) days with images from the second day of scans (again 60 [*]min post-injection scan; EARL compliant reconstruction).

Most importantly, the intersection of these delineations was evaluated at each day and, with a consensus approach, a reference delineation (RD) was created for each day: RD 1 and RD 2, respectively.|$|E
40|$|Morphological {{variation}} and life cycle category {{were examined in}} 121 clones of Myzus persicae (Sulzer). The clones were collected from tobacco from three localities in Greece (Xanthi, Nea Efessos and Naphplion), one in Germany (Rheinstetten), one in France (Bergerac) and one in Spain (Madrid). Before morphometrics, all aphids were laboratory-reared on potato. The morphological variation was investigated using both canonical variates analysis and a novel non-parametric classification tree method. The life cycle category was examined by rearing the clones for three generations under short day conditions. In Nea Efessos a relative high proportion of clones was found to overwinter as eggs on the primary host. In the other regions all collected clones were non-holocyclic. Intermediate genotypes were found in <b>all</b> <b>regions</b> <b>at</b> percentages ranging from 4. 0 to 24. 0 %.

The canonical variates analysis and the tree classification method revealed important intrapopulation polymorphisms in clones from Bergerac, Nea Efessos and Madrid. Both methods separated the populations originating from Greece from those collected elsewhere in western Europe. The observed morphological variation was probably due to genetic differences, since all clones were reared in a common environment. The results are discussed in relation to factors responsible for genetic divergence in M. persicae populations...|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND/AIMS: Dopamine is an {{important}} neurotransmitter involved in the pathophysiology of depression and anhedonia. Dopamine transporters (DAT) may {{play a crucial role}} in the pathophysiology of dopaminergic transmission. We investigated the relationship between striatal DAT availability and depression, pointing out possible correlations with anhedonia and treatment outcomes. METHODS: Ten depressed patients with anhedonia, 10 depressed patients without anhedonia and 20 healthy controls underwent single photon emission computed tomography using (123) I-FP-CIT [(123) I-N-ω-fluoropropyl-carbomethoxy- 3 β-(4 -iodophenyl) tropane]. Psychometric measures included the Snaith-Hamilton Pleasure Scale and the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale. A further assessment of DAT availability was performed in the 10 patients with marked anhedonia after a 3 -month pharmacological treatment. RESULTS: Depressed patients with and without anhedonia showed significantly lower (123) I-FP-CIT binding ratios in the bilateral striatum, caudate and putamen. No significant changes were detected after treatment in the 10 patients with marked anhedonia. When considering clinical outcomes, subjects with remission of depression showed a significant reduction of (123) I-FP-CIT binding ratios in <b>all</b> <b>regions</b> <b>at</b> baseline, but after treatment no differences were found any longer. CONCLUSIONS: We suppose that a hypofunction of the striatal dopaminergic system may be a 'state' feature of a depressive condition as a whole rather than anhedonia itself. On the other hand, some anhedonic features mainly represent an enduring trait that persists independently of mood state...|$|E
40|$|The genetic {{structure}} of green turtle (Chelonia mydas) rookeries located around the Australian coast {{was assessed by}} (1) comparing the structure found within and among geographic regions, (2) comparing microsatellite loci vs. {{restriction fragment length polymorphism}} analyses of anonymous single copy nuclear DNA (ascnDNA) loci, and (3) comparing the structure found at nuclear DNA markers to that of previously analyzed mitochondrial (mtDNA) control region sequences. Significant genetic structure was observed over <b>all</b> <b>regions</b> <b>at</b> both sets of nuclear markers, though the microsatellite data provided greater resolution in identifying significant genetic differences in pairwise tests between regions. Inferences about population structure and migration rates from the microsatellite data varied depending on whether statistics were based on the stepwise mutation or infinite allele model, with the latter being more congruent with geography. Estimated rates of gene flow were generally higher than expected for nuclear DNA (nDNA) in comparison to mtDNA, and this difference was most pronounced in comparisons between the northern and southern Great Barrier Reef (GBR). The genetic data combined with results from physical tagging studies indicate that the lack of nuclear gene divergence through the GBR is likely due to the migration of sGBR turtles through the courtship area of the nGBR population, rather than male-biased dispersal. This example highlights the value of combining comparative studies of molecular variation with ecological data to infer population processes...|$|E

Spatial, spectral and temporal information were combined in multiple crop-modelling steps, supported by on ground training data sampled across space and time for the classes Crop and No-Crop. Temporal information within summer and winter growing seasons for each year were summarised, and combined with various vegetation indices and band ratios computed from a mid-season spectral-composite image.

Global sea-level rise during the 20 th century has been estimated between 10 and 20 cm and similar changes appear to have occurred along Turkish coasts, although available data is poor. Coastal cities cover less than 5 % of the total surface area of Turkey, but they have over 30 million inhabitants and are growing rapidly. The Marmara region around Istanbul has the highest population density of <b>all</b> <b>regions.</b> <b>At</b> the same time, more than 60 % of the Turkish Gross National Product (GNP) is produced in the coastal strip from Tekirdag to Kocaeli (along the northern shoreline of the Marmara Sea). Analysis suggests that the effects of a 1 -m rise in sea level could be significant and adaptation costs substantial. This preliminary assessment suggests a capital loss of about 6 % of current GNP, whereas simple protection/adaptation could cost 10 % of current GNP. Continued urbanisation and tourist development will further increase exposure to sea-level rise. Currently, the consequences of sealevel rise and climate change are ignored in coastal management, and although strengthening of coastal management mechanisms is required for a number of reasons, sea-level rise and climate change should be considered an important long-term issue. To assist this, detailed case studies are recommended around Turkey's diverse coast, starting with the strategically important Istanbul area...|$|E

By 7 July 2003 and 7 June 2004, the total numbers of A. pullulans cells/mm 2 were significantly higher (P < 0. 05) on the midvein and other veins than in the interveinal regions. This pattern remained consistent thereafter. The primary colonizing morphotype in <b>all</b> <b>regions</b> <b>at</b> all dates was the SCC form, although blastospores always occurred in low numbers.

Except for early collections, when A. pullulans cell numbers were low, the percent occupancy of interveinal regions was lower than that of the midvein or other veinal regions. A. pullulans was distributed primarily as single cells throughout the seasons in interveinal regions. On the midvein and other veins, colonies of ≥ 4 cells developed over time, and more cells occurred in colonies than as singletons by August.
