500|$|Although {{they had}} ample opportunity, {{at no time}} did any of them even hint that [...] "Earnest" [...] was a synonym for {{homosexual}}, or that [...] "bunburying" [...] may have implied homosexual sex. The first time I heard it mentioned was in the 1980s <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>immediately</b> consulted Sir John Gielgud whose own performance of Jack Worthing in the same play was legendary and whose knowledge of theatrical lore was encyclopaedic. He replied in his ringing tones: [...] "No-No! Nonsense, absolute nonsense: I would have known".|$|E
500|$|Beahan {{had been}} {{thinking}} of releasing a tribute record through his company for a long time, {{following the death of}} musicians Arthur Lee and Syd Barrett in 2006. However, he changed his mind and instead chose Madonna, believing her songs could be recorded as serious sounding tracks, thereby eliminating chances of it being a novelty release. The idea for Through the Wilderness originated from an epiphany Beahan had about Madonna. Although not a fan of the singer, he was intrigued about how her songs would sound when treated by alternative musicians. [...] "The Madonna tribute came to me in a dream last fall, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>immediately</b> started making calls and emails to Winter Flowers, Chapin Sisters, and Banhart asking them to record a song for it," [...] Beahan clarified to Spin magazine.|$|E
500|$|The {{video screens}} showed both live shoots and special footage {{directed}} by Robson. Cohen worked by Danny O'Brien at BCC Video to create double-sided custom video LED cubes that hanged above stage right. There were three larger-sized video screens above the stage area. The gyrating wheel in which Spears opened {{the show was}} made by Branam Enterprises and was attached to a platform also created by Tait Towers. 171 white light [...] were provided by Spectra. The giant music box from which Spears emerged in [...] "Born to Make You Happy" [...] (1999) was designed by Michael Cotton. Confetti was shot from machines provided by Pyrotek. Pyrotechnics were done by Gerb Fountains, whereas artificial snow was provided by Little Blizzard. During the encore performance of [...] "...Baby One More Time" [...] (1998), there was a water screen {{in which it was}} poured nearly two tons of water pumped at 360 gallons a minute. Cohen said, [...] "The water screen is the keystone of the entire design because it impacts every systemâ€”electrics, staging, dancing. Rob discovered the company (Chameleon Productions of Orlando, Florida) that makes the screen, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>immediately</b> looked at what they had in stock, which was a straight line. And I knew we didn't want a straight line. We wanted a circular water screen so we could physically build a shower for her to stand in the middle of and not get wet and then walk through when she wanted to. Of course, everyone thought I was crazy, so I suggested a six-sided shape. Everyone was concerned that the gaps between the sections might cause gaps in the actual sheets of water. But I kept saying that if you put them 40' to 50' up in the air, gravity will cause the water to attach to itself, so you end up getting a solid sheet." ...|$|E

Burden, describing a property he had found four miles west of Redlands, five and one-half miles southeast of San Bernardino, and eight miles northeast of Riverside. As I read his letter, I was impressed that {{this was one of the}} places I had seen in vision, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>immediately</b> telegraphed him to secure the property without delay. He did so, and as the result, Loma Linda is in our possession." ...|$|E
2500|$|However, Ellis, {{releasing}} a letter Monday evening {{that he sent}} Saturday to county Chief Operating Officer Robert W. Graf, denies violating the agreement. The letter, in part, states: [...] "As for Ms. Bradley and myself, that case was amicably closed April 1 and never violated by either party. As I told Ms. Jackson, I did mistakenly dial Ms. Bradley on her cell when trying to call someone with a very close number and I dialed too quickly...after four years, {{it was an old}} habit. Nothing was said <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>immediately</b> hung up when I realized my mistake. That happened one time in a month. I have said nothing to Ms. Bradley nor seen her in or out of the county workplace." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "I want {{to explain}} what happened. Sunday night when you {{requested}} to have someone over I didn't realize you wanted the room in private. I went to Molly's room and I was showing her how I set up my computer so I can access it from anywhere. I turned on my camera and saw you {{in the corner of}} the screen <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>immediately</b> closed it. I felt uncomfortable and guilty of what happened. Obviously I told people what occurred so they could give me advice. Then Tuesday when you requested the room again I wanted to make sure what happened Sunday wouldn't happen again and not to video chat me from 930 to 12. Just in case, I turned my camera away and put my computer to sleep so even if anyone tried it wouldn't work. I wanted to make amends for Sunday night. I'm sorry if you heard something distorted and disturbing but I assure you all my actions were good natured." ...|$|E
60|$|That gentleman made a {{suitable}} reply with a cordiality and frankness peculiarly his own, and glanced {{with a smile}} towards two persons behind the door, whom I had not at first observed, <b>and</b> whom <b>I</b> <b>immediately</b> recognised as Mr. Samuel Weller and his father.|$|R

2500|$|The first {{thoughts}} and attempts I made to practice [...] were suggested by a question which {{occurred to me}} in 1946 as I was convalescing from an illness and playing solitaires. The question was {{what are the chances}} that a Canfield solitaire laid out with 52 cards will come out successfully? After {{spending a lot of time}} trying to estimate them by pure combinatorial calculations, I wondered whether a more practical method than [...] "abstract thinking" [...] might not be to lay it out say one hundred times and simply observe and count the number of successful plays. This was already possible to envisage with the beginning of the new era of fast computers, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>immediately</b> thought of problems of neutron diffusion and other questions of mathematical physics, and more generally how to change processes described by certain differential equations into an equivalent form interpretable as a succession of random operations. Later , I described the idea to John von Neumann, and we began to plan actual calculations.|$|E
2500|$|Less than 24 {{hours after}} Jackson's death, [...] "Better on the Other Side" [...] was {{released}} by Diddy on his Twitter account. [...] "Better on the Other Side" [...] made its debut on the morning radio show [...] "Big Boy's Neighborhood" [...] {{as well as on}} Game affiliate DJ Skee's satellite radio show, [...] "Skeetox." [...] DJ Skee, said of being {{one of the first to}} give the song radio airplay, [...] "I told Game yesterday that Michael Jackson died, and he didn't believe me. He said, 'I'll call you right back. Then this morning, he hit me with this track, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>immediately</b> started blasting it out." [...] "Better on the Other Side" [...] was also released as a digital download. [...] "Better on the Other Side" [...] did not chart on any music charts from radio play or digital download sales. [...] "Better on the Other Side" [...] was received well by contemporary music critics. Rahman Dukes and Shaheem Reid, of MTV, described [...] "Better on the Other Side" [...] as a being a [...] "heartfelt tribute".|$|E
2500|$|... "I think {{having a}} pilot's licence helped a little bit. One of my road crew said {{we found this}} guy that {{used to work in}} the circus and he does a lot of things for TV and special effects and he's made {{something}} that might interest you, it's a piano that spins round, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>immediately</b> responded, oh that sounds interesting. I happened to be within the New York area and I was driven over to Long Island to a guy called Bob McCarthy, and there in the background he had this piano situated. So he called his wife down from upstairs and said, darling could you demonstrate this for Keith? I looked on, I wasn't quite sure what to expect. His wife comes down and sits on the seat and up she goes in the air and proceeds to spin around. I thought, well that's great! Then Bob asked me, {{do you want to have}} a go at it?... Yea, okay. You need to understand, below the keyboard there's an inverted-tee, like a bar. You wrap your legs around the down pipe and put your heels under the inverted-tee. Then you go up in the air and try and do your best to play. It was a little difficult to play at first because of the centrifugal force, so it wasn't easy. I think we actually used it for the first time at Madison Square Garden, it was a Christmas concert. People in the audience were so astounded they couldn't quite believe what they were seeing. Later on that coming year the California Jam came up and I said we have to do that there. Bob drove the whole contraption down to the California Jam and there was very little space to set it up. There were loads of bands up on that stage, all having to do their set and then getting their equipment off. Now, with the moog, the Hammonds, Carl's gongs and everything, it was hard enough to just get that off stage. We had the spinning piano and everything that went along with it and we tried to find a place to situate it. It ended up going just at the end of the stage, so when the piano went up it was literally over the heads of the audience. After that every TV show I did came the question... Keith, how do you spin around on that piano? I'd say what about my music? When I had the honor of meeting the great jazz pianist Dave Brubeck just before he died, he said, Keith you've got to tell me how do you spin around on that piano? Dave Brubeck was 90 years old then and I said, 'Dave, don't try it!'" ...|$|E

60|$|As a truthful historian, I must {{add that}} Burton <b>and</b> <b>I,</b> <b>immediately</b> after this highly {{emotional}} close of our school career, were both {{called upon to}} climb into the family carriage and drive away into the black night, back to the farm,--an experience which seemed to us {{at the time a}} sad anticlimax.
