5|$|After Mussolini {{had made}} clear in 1922 {{that he would}} never give up the region of South Tyrol from being in Italy, Hitler adopted this position. Hitler in Mein Kampf had {{declared}} that concerns over the rights of Germans in South Tyrol under Italian sovereignty was a non-issue considering the <b>advantages</b> <b>that</b> would be gained from a German-Italian alliance with Mussolini's Fascist regime. In Mein Kampf Hitler also made clear that he was opposed to having a war with Italy for the sake of obtaining South Tyrol. This position by Hitler of abandoning German land claims to South Tyrol produced aggravation among some NSDAP members who up to the late 1920s found it difficult to accept the position.|$|E
5|$|Common {{agreement}} about the day's layout or schedule confers so many <b>advantages</b> <b>that</b> a standard DST schedule {{has generally been}} chosen over ad hoc efforts to get up earlier. The advantages of coordination are so great that many people ignore whether DST is in effect by altering their nominal work schedules to coordinate with television broadcasts or daylight. DST is commonly not observed during most of winter, because its mornings are darker; workers may have no sunlit leisure time, and children may need to leave for school in the dark. Since DST is applied to many varying communities, its effects may be very different depending on their culture, light levels, geography, and climate; {{that is why it}} is hard to make generalized conclusions about the absolute effects of the practice. Some areas may adopt DST simply as a matter of coordination with others rather than for any direct benefits.|$|E
5|$|Since {{they lacked}} the forces to take Nikolaev {{in a single}} campaign, the seizure of Kinburn proved to have limited {{strategic}} effect. Nevertheless, the attack on Kinburn was significant in that it demonstrated that the French and British fleets had developed effective amphibious capabilities and had technological <b>advantages</b> <b>that</b> gave them a decisive edge over their Russian opponents. The destruction of Kinburn's coastal fortifications completed the Anglo-French naval campaign in the Black Sea; the Russians no longer had any meaningful forces left to oppose them at sea. The British and French navies planned to transfer forces to the Baltic Sea the following year to strengthen operations there. Diplomatic pressure from still-neutral Austria convinced Czar Nicholas I of Russia to sue for peace, which was concluded the following February with the Treaty of Paris.|$|E

5|$|While at Princeton, she got {{involved}} with the Third World Center (now known as the Carl A. Fields Center), an academic and cultural group that supported minority students, running their day care center, which also included after school tutoring. She challenged the teaching methodology for French because she felt {{that it should be}} more conversational. As part of her requirements for graduation, she wrote a thesis titled Princeton-Educated Blacks and the Black Community. She researched her thesis by sending a questionnaire to African American graduates, requesting they specify when and how comfortable they were with their race prior to their enrollment at Princeton and how they felt about it when they were a student and since then. Of the 400 alumni to whom she sent the survey, fewer than 90 responded, and her findings did not support her hope that the black alumni would still identify with the African American community, even though they had attended an elite university with all of the <b>advantages</b> <b>that</b> accrues to its graduates. She majored in sociology and minored in African American studies, graduating cum laude with a Bachelor of Arts in 1985.|$|E

25|$|Sociologist Rodney Stark in {{his book}} The Rise of Christianity has also argued that—contrary to popular belief—Christianity was not a {{movement}} of the lower classes and the oppressed, but instead of the upper and middle classes in the cities and of Hellenized Jews.

For this reason the Combined Cycle Plants with maximum supplementary firing are only of minimal importance today, {{in comparison to}} simple Combined Cycle installations.

25|$|At {{the start}} of the war, the belligerents, {{especially}} the British and Germans, began distributing propaganda, both domestically and on the Western front. The British had several <b>advantages</b> <b>that</b> allowed them to succeed in the battle for world opinion; they had one of the world's most reputable news systems, with much experience in international and cross-cultural communication, and they controlled much of the undersea cable system then in operation. These capabilities were easily transitioned to the task of warfare.|$|E
25|$|Most modern PID {{controllers}} {{in industry}} are implemented in {{distributed control systems}} (DCS), programmable logic controllers (PLCs), or as a panel-mounted digital controller. Software implementations have the <b>advantages</b> <b>that</b> they are relatively cheap and are flexible {{with respect to the}} implementation of the PID algorithm. PID temperature controllers are applied in industrial ovens, plastics injection machinery, hot-stamping machines and packing industry. PID controllers are at the core of multirotor drones as well, in the form of self-stabilising flight controllers.|$|E

According to both ProKarelian research and Arto Lahti's estimate, the price of return would be about 30 billion euro.|$|E
25|$|Many of the {{advantages}} for postalcoholic fermentation answer the disadvantages of early inoculation (namely less antagonism and potential for undesirable byproducts).
