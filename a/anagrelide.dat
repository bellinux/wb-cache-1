50|$|However, {{in primary}} thrombocytosis, if {{platelet}} counts are over 750,000 or 1,000,000, and {{especially if there}} are other risk factors for thrombosis, treatment may be needed.

50|$|Essential {{thrombocytosis}} (ET-Also {{known as}} essential thrombocythemia) is a disorder characterized by extremely {{high numbers of}} circulating platelets. The disease occurs in 1-2 per 100,000 people. The current WHO requirements for diagnosis include > 600,000 platelets/μL of blood (normal 150,000-400,000) and a bone marrow biopsy. Some {{of the consequences of}} having such high numbers of platelets include thrombosis or clots throughout the body. Thrombi form more frequently in arteries than veins. It seems ironic that having platelet counts above 1,000,000 platelets/μL can lead to hemorrhagic events. Recent evidence suggests that the majority of ET cases are due to a mutation in the JAK2 protein, a member of the JAK-STAT pathway. Evidence suggests that this mutation renders the megakaryocyte hypersensitive to thrombopoietin and causes clonal proliferation of megakaryocytes. There is a significant risk of transformation to leukemia with this disorder. The primary treatment consists of <b>anagrelide</b> or hydroxyurea to lower platelet levels.|$|E

40|$|The platelet-lowering drug <b>anagrelide</b> {{inhibits}} {{bone marrow}} megakaryocytopoiesis {{by an unknown}} mechanism. Recently, {{it was found that}} <b>anagrelide</b> is bio-transformed in humans into two major metabolites (6, 7 -dichloro- 3 -hydroxy- 1, 5 dihydro-imidazo[2, 1 -b]quinazolin- 2 -one (BCH 24426) and 2 -amino- 5, 6 -dichloro- 3, 4,-dihydroquinazoline (RL 603). Whether these metabolites have biological activities that may underlie the mode of action of the parent drug is presently unclear. To clarify this question here we have compared the activities of <b>anagrelide,</b> BCH 24426 and RL 603 on the growth and differentiation of CD 34 + haematopoietic progenitor cells in liquid culture and on the migration of differentiated megakaryocytes. Incubation with either <b>anagrelide,</b> BCH 24426 or RL 603 did not affect the early expansion of CD 34 + cells stimulated by thrombopoietin. In contrast, both <b>anagrelide</b> and BCH 24426 potently inhibited the development of megakaryocytes (IC 50 ±s. e. m. = 26 ± 4 and 44 ± 6 [*]nM, respectively), whereas RL 603 showed no significant effect. <b>Anagrelide</b> and BCH 24426 did not affect erythroid or myelomonocytic differentiation stimulated by erythropoietin or granulocyte–macrophage colony-stimulating factor, demonstrating the selectivity of these compounds against the megakaryocytic lineage. Neither <b>anagrelide</b> nor its metabolites showed a significant effect on the migratory response of megakaryocytes towards stromal cell-derived factor- 1 α. Although BCH 24426 was shown to be considerably more potent than <b>anagrelide</b> as an inhibitor of phosphodiesterase type III (PDEIII) (IC 50 = 0. 9 vs 36 [*]nM) this activity did not correlate with the potency of inhibition of megakaryocyte development. Furthermore, other PDEIII inhibitors of widely differing potency were shown to have negligible effects on megakaryocytopoiesis.

40|$|The {{pharmaceutical}} agent <b>anagrelide</b> 1 {{is used to}} reduce the levels of circulating blood platelets {{in the treatment of}} myeloproliferative disorders by inhibiting the growth of megakaryocytes (the precursors of platelets). It is metabolised extensively in vivo into two major metabolites: 3 -hydroxyanagrelide (or BCH 24426 2) and RL 603 3 (Figure i). BCH 24426 2 is also active against megakaryocyte growth, whereas RL 603 3 is an inactive metabolite. Both <b>anagrelide</b> 1 and BCH 24426 2 are known to inhibit the enzyme phosphodiesterase (PDE) III, which causes positive inotropic effects. This can manifest itself as undesirable side effects, such as heart palpitations and, in severe cases, heart attacks. In addition to this unwanted PDE III inhibition, <b>anagrelide</b> also has a poor pharmacokinetic profile. It undergoes rapid metabolism, and as such has to be administered up to four times per day. Analogues of <b>anagrelide</b> that prevent or reduce metabolism to a 3 -hydroxylated metabolite would likely decrease the side effects and may improve the pharmacokinetic profile of the drug by increasing the half life of the parent compound.

40|$|PURPOSE: Essential thrombocythemia (ET) manifests {{substantial}} interpatient heterogeneity {{in rates}} of thrombosis, hemorrhage, and disease transformation. Bone marrow histology reflects underlying disease activity in ET but many morphological features show poor reproducibility. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We evaluated the clinical significance of bone marrow reticulin, a measure previously {{shown to have}} relatively high interobserver reliability, in a large, prospectively-studied cohort of ET patients. RESULTS: Reticulin grade positively correlated with white blood cell (P =. 05) and platelet counts (P =. 0001) at diagnosis. Elevated reticulin levels at presentation predicted higher rates of arterial thrombosis (hazard ratio [HR], 1. 8; 95 % CI, 1. 1 to 2. 9; P =. 01), major hemorrhage (HR, 2. 0; 95 % CI, 1. 0 to 3. 9; P =. 05), and myelofibrotic transformation (HR, 5. 5; 95 % CI, 1. 7 to 18. 4; P =. 0007) independently of known risk factors. Higher reticulin levels at diagnosis were associated with greater subsequent falls in hemoglobin levels in patients treated with <b>anagrelide</b> (P <. 0001), but not in those receiving hydroxyurea (P =. 9). Moreover, serial trephine specimens in patients randomly assigned to <b>anagrelide</b> showed significantly greater increases in reticulin grade compared with those allocated to hydroxyurea (P =. 0003), and four patients who developed increased bone marrow reticulin on <b>anagrelide</b> showed regression of fibrosis when switched to hydroxyurea. These data suggest that patients receiving <b>anagrelide</b> therapy should undergo surveillance bone marrow biopsy every 2 to 3 years and that those who show substantially increasing reticulin levels {{are at risk of}} myelofibrotic transformation and may benefit from changing therapy before adverse clinical features develop.

At start of <b>Anagrelide</b> treatment the mean PLT count (109 /L) was 907 (> 1000 in 32 %). The 68 % of patients were receiving an antiplatelet treatment and the 74 % received cytoreductive drugs (Alkylating agents and HU 17 %, HU alone 20 %, HU and IFN 21 %, IFN alone 16 %). The treatment with <b>Anagrelide</b> was started mainly because of the young age of patients, inefficacy and/or high dose required, toxicity and/or side effects of the other drugs and patient request. The mean daily <b>Anagrelide</b> dose from the baseline of 1. 3 mg was increased to 1. 5 mg after 1 month and to 1. 8 mg since the 12 th month. The most common side effects were cephalea/vertigo (24 %), palpitation/tachycardia (24 %), gastrointestinal (9 %), asthenia (8 %), oedema (5 %). A transitory interruption of <b>Anagrelide</b> treatment was observed in 44 / 220 cases (20 %) as a consequence of drug toxicity (3. 7 %), side effects (5 %), no drug availability (4. 5 %), other causes (6. 8 %). A drug withdrawal was registered in 54 / 220 patients (24. 5 %) after a median treatment duration of 17 months when the mean <b>Anagrelide</b> dose was 1. 8 mg/day and the mean PLT count was 665 x 109 /L), because of inefficacy (3 %), toxicity (3 %), side effects (9. 5 %), compliance loss (1 %), no drug availability (3 %),other causes (5 %). The mean follow-up of all 220 patients was 21 months. The mean PLT count (109 /L) from the baseline value of 907 decreased to 586, 505, 490, 458 and 449 after 1, 6, 12, 36 and 60 months, respectively. The mean WBC count (109 /L) was 7. 7 at the baseline and 9. 2 after 60 months. The mean Hb level (g/dL) from the baseline of 13. 2 decreased to 12. 8 and 12. 4 at months 6 and 60, respectively.

The rate of CV-AEs was: 24. 1 % for palpitations, 4. 3 % for angina, 3. 5 % for arterial hypertension, 3. 0 % for congestive heart failure, 1. 8 % for arrhythmia, 0. 9 % for AMI, 0. 4 % for pericardial effusion. CV-AEs led to treatment discontinuation in nine (3. 9 %) patients, while in the remaining cases they were managed by pharmacological intervention and/or patient life style improvement. CV-AEs had no relationship with patient characteristics (including older age). A significant relationship was found only with a higher <b>anagrelide</b> induction dose.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Management of {{essential}} thrombocythemia (ET) in high-risk patients {{is difficult because}} high platelet numbers can lead to vascular occlusive events and bleeding. Therapeutic interventions in ET are limited to hydroxyurea and anagrelide; however, in Europe, <b>anagrelide</b> is contraindicated in patients with chronic renal disease. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this case report was to describe the use of <b>anagrelide</b> in a patient with ET and renal impairment. CASE SUMMARY: A 73 -year-old white female patient with severe renal impairment who was diagnosed with ET was receiving treatment with hydroxyurea 1 g/d since 2001. At this time she was also receiving aspirin 80 mg/d; calcium carbonate 1 g/d; pravastatin 40 mg/d; folic acid 5 mg/d; furosemide 40 mg/d; cetirizine 10 mg/d; erythropoietin 10, 000 U once monthly; a vitamin B complex, 1 tablet a day; and iron tablets 105 mg/d. In February 2007, because her {{white blood cell count}} fell to 2. 1 x 10 (9) /L, myelodepression was suspected and hydroxyurea was stopped. This led to enhanced platelet levels and the introduction of <b>anagrelide</b> at an initial dose of 0. 5 mg/d that was steadily increased to 2. 5 mg/d. All other treatments were continued with some dosage adjustments. Sodium bicarbonate 1 g/d and vitamin D were added to her regimen. After 18 months of <b>anagrelide</b> treatment, a sudden but moderate fall of platelets to 142 x 10 (3) /microL with severe anemia (hemoglobin, 6. 5 g/dL) was observed. The patient had anemia since 2004, but the condition worsened due to bleeding related to an ulcer at the cecal valve. The patient refused blood and platelet transfusions and surgical intervention for religious reasons. Because of hemodynamic instability, she was admitted to the intensive care unit in December 2008 and died 24 hours after admission. Conclusion: We report a case of ET and chronic renal failure treated with <b>anagrelide</b> and low-dose aspirin in a patient who did not receive transfusion and surgical intervention due to religious reasons, and had a fatal outcome.

40|$|International audienceEssential thrombocythaemia (ET) is an {{acquired}} myeloproliferative disorder with a prolonged clinical course and a near-normal life expectancy. Therapy is stratified according to risk of thrombohaemorrhagic events. In high-risk patients, platelet reduction is generally recommended. In intermediate-risk patients, therapy {{should be considered}} depending on the severity of associated risk factors, especially cardiovascular. In low-risk patients, a watch-and-wait approach is appropriate. Hydroxycarbamide is generally first-line therapy. Concerns for possible leukemogenicity make <b>anagrelide</b> or interferon-α possible choices in younger patients {{and those who are}} resistant or intolerant to hydroxycarbamide. Each pharmacotherapy is associated with specific long-term risks and benefits. The potential risk of major bleeding is the main drawback of aspirin. Hydroxycarbamide is an established, effective drug for ET, but it may increase the risk of transformation to acute myeloid leukaemia and may give mucocutaneous ulcers. <b>Anagrelide</b> is a licensed treatment that also reduces platelet counts and is generally well tolerated, with evidence that some common side effects diminish over time. <b>Anagrelide</b> can have cardiac effects due to inhibition of phosphodiesterase III and therefore requires cautious use in patients with cardiac insufficiency. There is no evidence of leukaemogenicity with <b>anagrelide</b> or interferon-α therapy. Interferon-α is the only treatment suitable for use during pregnancy, although it is not licensed in ET. While it is effective for platelet reduction, the use of interferon-α is restricted by psychiatric side effects. Our knowledge of the optimum pharmacotherapy for each patient with ET continues to evolve through research and clinical trials, particularly into the molecular basis of the disease...|$|E
40|$|The {{myeloproliferative}} disorder, essential thrombocythaemia (ET), {{is extremely}} rare in children. In adults, thrombosis {{is the most}} common complication whereas a low number of children develop thrombosis and/or haemorrhages. Diagnosis of ET is often difficult, but identifying ET from other causes of thrombocytosis is essential, otherwise therapy may be ineffective as the wrong disease will be treated. Only anecdotal experiences have been published with regard to the treatment of paediatric ET. A watch-and-wait strategy seems appropriate in asymptomatic cases and low-dose aspirin should be used to reduce microvascular disturbances. <b>Anagrelide</b> or IFNs may be considered as first-line, and hydroxyurea as second-line therapy. <b>Anagrelide</b> may become the treatment of choice for ET in children if a lack of leukaemogenic potential is confirmed...|$|E
40|$|AbstractEssential thrombocythemia (ET), {{a chronic}} {{myeloproliferative}} disease, {{is characterized by}} an increased number of platelets and risk of vascular thrombosis. A case of a patient treated for ET who had acute myocardial infarction (MI) and reinfarction within a month is presented. A 55 -year-old male patient was hospitalized because of subacute inferolateral non-ST-segment-elevation MI, without risk factors for cardiovascular diseases. The patient has been treated for ET for the past 8 years, received <b>anagrelide</b> {{for the past two}} years. The first coronary-angiography did not detect significant stenosis of epicardial vessels; the patient was discharged in stable condition with <b>anagrelide</b> therapy. Two weeks later, the patient had an acute anterolateral ST-segment-elevation MI. Primary percutaneous coronary intervention showed thrombus in the distal part of the left anterior descending coronary artery. Percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty was performed and eptifibatide was administered after the procedure. There was no residual stenosis, prescribed therapy included clopidogrel and low-molecular-weight heparin. <b>Anagrelide</b> therapy was replaced with hydroxyurea (HU) and acetylsalicylic acid (ASA). It is necessary to treat ET in line with the standard treatment protocol for coronary diseases. In the treatment of high-risk hematology patients <b>anagrelide</b> proved to be a worse option than the combination of HU and ASA. <Learning objective: It is known that the myeloproliferative disorders carry the risk of vascular thrombosis and myocardial infarction. The occurrence of vascular events is usually the first sign of the disease. A case of a patient with history of hematological disease, who was receiving active treatment and was well-regulated with oral medication, is presented here. Various approaches to treatment of such patients are possible and treatment decision-making is important for clinicians. Therefore, this article presents both our view on this issue and an overview of the literature in this area. ...|$|E
