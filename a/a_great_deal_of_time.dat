By 1857, Marx had accumulated over 800 pages of notes and short essays on capital, landed property, wage labour, the state and foreign trade and the world market, though this work did not appear in print until 1939 under the title Outlines of the Critique of Political Economy.|$|E

Willoughby's aunt Lady Allen disinherited him upon discovering this.|$|E
5|$|The {{affair with}} Sejanus {{and the final}} years of treason trials {{permanently}} damaged Tiberius' image and reputation. After Sejanus's fall, Tiberius' withdrawal from Rome was complete; the empire continued to run under the inertia of the bureaucracy established by Augustus, rather than through the leadership of the Princeps. Suetonius records that he became paranoid, and spent <b>a</b> <b>great</b> <b>deal</b> <b>of</b> <b>time</b> brooding over the death of his son. Meanwhile, during this period a short invasion by Parthia, incursions by tribes from Dacia and from across the Rhine by several Germanic tribes occurred.|$|E

5|$|Woodfull was {{appointed}} as vice-captain to Jack Ryder for the 1928–29 home Ashes series. The Australian board had spent <b>a</b> <b>great</b> <b>deal</b> <b>of</b> <b>time</b> arguing over whether Woodfull or Victor Richardson should be Ryder's deputy, before realising that he selectors had omitted the latter. With {{six members of}} the team that played in the last Test in 1926 having retired, Australia would field and young and inexperienced team. Woodfull prepared for the Tests with an unbeaten 67 for Victoria in a drawn tour match against Percy Chapman's touring Englishmen.|$|E
5|$|Bresslau became Albert's confidant but did {{not give}} up her own life for his. In fact, they spent <b>a</b> <b>great</b> <b>deal</b> <b>of</b> <b>time</b> {{away from each other}} and {{maintained}} a nontraditional relationship (together but not exclusive). They felt secure remaining undefined as a couple, relying on their friendship through documented letters. The turning point for their relationship occurred when they married on June 18, 1912 in Gunsbach. At this point in their lives, they both decided to marry and go to Africa to fulfill their desire to care for others in need.

On Good Friday of 1913, she travelled with Albert to Lambaréné, Gabon, beginning her medical missionary adventure.|$|E
5|$|In general, seabirds live longer, breed {{later and}} have fewer young than other birds do, but they invest <b>a</b> <b>great</b> <b>deal</b> <b>of</b> <b>time</b> in their young. Most species nest in colonies, which can vary {{in size from}} a few dozen birds to millions. Many species are famous for {{undertaking}} long annual migrations, crossing the equator or circumnavigating the Earth in some cases. They feed both at the ocean's surface and below it, and even feed on each other. Seabirds can be highly pelagic, coastal, {{or in some cases}} spend a part of the year away from the sea entirely.|$|E

He now had a dozen Cheyenne informants, including Wooden Leg. With them, from June 1928, communicating mainly with sign language or through interpreters, he consulted maps and went on field trips to the battle site. He also corresponded with George Bird Grinnell, Generals Hugh L. Scott and Edward S. Godfrey, and with Custer's widow Elizabeth Custer. He also started loaning out some of his Custer memorabilia for exhibitions. Personal contacts during this period included Laton Alton Huffman, a well-known Montana frontier photographer, W.H. Banfill of the Billings Gazette, who wrote Western history articles, artist and author Will James, and James Willard Schultz, author and explorer.|$|E
5|$|Little {{is known}} about the {{preparations}} for the 6th Congress. It was convened a decade after the 5th WPK Congress (in 1970), outside the party norm of a quadrennial meeting. There was no official reason for its postponement, but it was probably {{due to the fact that}} WPK General Secretary Kim Il-sung spent much of the 1970s gathering support (and creating an independent power base) for his son and planned successor Kim Jong-il. In addition, <b>a</b> <b>great</b> <b>deal</b> <b>of</b> <b>time</b> was spent restructuring party organizations and functions. The primary reason for the 6th Congress was to formalize Kim Jong-il as Kim Il-sung's chosen successor.|$|E
5|$|Neither Jogaila nor Vytautas {{had gained}} a clear {{advantage}} and the territories of the Grand Duchy {{affected by the}} civil war were being devastated. Polish nobles were dissatisfied with the war; Jogaila was spending <b>a</b> <b>great</b> <b>deal</b> <b>of</b> <b>time</b> on Lithuanian matters and the expected benefits of the Union of Krewo had not materialized. The Union was meant to strengthen Polish control over Galicia, Moldavia, and Wallachia rather than to create fresh troubles in the north. Jogaila was preoccupied with the management of his court, battles in the southeast, and his sickly wife. He attempted to replace Skirgaila with his younger brother Vygantas, but this brother died under unclear circumstances – according to rumor he was poisoned by either Vytautas or Skirgaila. Klemens Moskarzewski was replaced with Jan Oleśnicki from Kraków as governor of Vilnius. Jogaila decided to seek a compromise with Vytautas.|$|E

5|$|The Soviet leadership, {{through their}} {{intelligence}} agencies and foreign sources, {{learned about the}} German intentions, and therefore the multiple delays by the German high command, OKW, allowed them <b>a</b> <b>great</b> <b>deal</b> <b>of</b> <b>time</b> to prepare their defences. Employing defence in depth, they constructed a series of defensive lines to wear down the attacking panzer formations. Three belts made up of extensive minefields, anti-tank ditches, and anti-tank gun emplacements were created; behind those were an additional three belts, which were mostly unoccupied and less fortified. The Voronezh Front, commanded by General Nikolai Vatutin, defended the southern face of the salient. The Steppe Front, commanded by Colonel General Ivan Konev, formed the strategic reserve. It was to be held back east of the salient until {{the time was right}} for the Soviet counteroffensive. This formation included Lieutenant General Alexei Zhadov's 5th Guards Army and Lieutenant General Pavel Rotmistrov's 5th Guards Tank Army.|$|E
5|$|Alcoholism, {{also known}} as alcohol use {{disorder}} (AUD), is a broad term for any drinking of alcohol that results in mental or physical health problems. It was previously divided into two types: alcohol abuse and alcohol dependence. In a medical context, alcoholism is said to exist when {{two or more of}} the following conditions is present: a person drinks large amounts over a long time period, has difficulty cutting down, acquiring and drinking alcohol takes up <b>a</b> <b>great</b> <b>deal</b> <b>of</b> <b>time,</b> alcohol is strongly desired, usage results in not fulfilling responsibilities, usage results in social problems, usage results in health problems, usage results in risky situations, withdrawal occurs when stopping, and alcohol tolerance has occurred with use. Risky situations include drinking and driving or having unsafe sex among others. Alcohol use can affect all parts of the body but particularly affects the brain, heart, liver, pancreas, and immune system. This can result in mental illness, Wernicke–Korsakoff syndrome, an irregular heart beat, liver failure, and an increase in the risk of cancer, among other diseases. Drinking during pregnancy can cause damage to the baby resulting in fetal alcohol spectrum disorders. Generally women are more sensitive to alcohol's harmful physical and mental effects than men.|$|E
5|$|The provincial presidents were {{appointed}} by the national government and were, in theory, charged with governing the province. In practice, however, their power was intangible, varying from province to province based upon each president's relative degree of personal influence and personal character. Since the national government wanted to ensure their loyalty, presidents were, in most cases, sent to a province {{in which they had}} no political, familial or other ties. In order to prevent them from developing any strong local interests or support, presidents would be limited to terms of only a few months in office. As the president usually spent <b>a</b> <b>great</b> <b>deal</b> <b>of</b> <b>time</b> away from the province, often traveling to their native province or the imperial capital, the de facto governor was the vice-president, who was chosen by the Provincial Assembly and was usually a local politician. With little power to undermine provincial autonomy, the president was an agent of the central government with little function beyond conveying its interests to the provincial political bosses. Presidents could be used by the national government to influence, or even rig, elections, although to be effective the president had to rely on provincial and local politicians who belonged to his own political party. This interdependency created a complex relationship which was based upon exchanges of favors, private interests, party goals, negotiations, and other political maneuvering.|$|E
