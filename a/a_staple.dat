5|$|In {{the early}} 20th century, the novel was {{considered}} a classic for primary school children in the UK, and in the United States it was <b>a</b> <b>staple</b> of high-school suggested reading lists. Modern critics consider the book's worldview to be dated and imperialist, but although less popular today, The Coral Island was adapted into a four-part children's television drama broadcast by ITV in 2000.|$|E
5|$|In this period, one of {{the major}} {{incentives}} for the growth of Transylvanian towns was the trade with Wallachia and Moldavia. For instance, Braşov was granted <b>a</b> <b>staple</b> right in 1369 with respect to the trade in cloth from Poland or Germany. Thereafter, foreign merchants had to sell their most sought-after merchandise, broadcloth to the tradesmen of Braşov who resold it in Wallachia in exchange for animals, cotton, wax and honey.|$|E

5|$|Lemoine's work defined many of {{the noted}} traits of this movement. His Géométrographie and {{relation}} of equations to tetrahedrons and triangles, {{as well as his}} study of concurrencies and concyclities, contributed to the modern triangle geometry of the time. The definition of points of the triangle such as the Lemoine point was also <b>a</b> <b>staple</b> of the geometry, and other modern triangle geometers such as Brocard and Gaston Tarry wrote about similar points.|$|E

5|$|Sonic Colors {{introduced}} the Wisp power-ups, which {{would go on}} to become <b>a</b> <b>staple</b> of the Sonic franchise.

5|$|The diet of {{tilefish}} larvae is unknown, but it {{is believed}} to be zooplankton. Juvenile and adults are omnivorous with a preference for small benthic invertebrates, with <b>a</b> <b>staple</b> being crabs and lobster. Great northern tilefish also consume bivalve molluscs, salps, squid, Atlantic dogfish, mackrel, hagfish, and herring. Human trash is also eaten, including potato peels and meat bones. They also eat other tilefish in a display of cannibalistism.|$|E
5|$|The {{idea for}} Noodles & Company was {{conceived}} by former Pepsi marketing executive Aaron Kennedy, after eating at Mamie's Asian Noodle Shop in Greenwich Village, New York.

Kennedy started developing recipes out of his mother-in-law's kitchen with the future COO, Joe Serafin, and head chef, Ross Kamens, in 1994.|$|E
5|$|As {{the city}} grew, the hotels {{reflected}} ambitions {{of the strong}} economy, {{as evidenced by the}} eleven-story skyscraper Lamar Hotel built in 1927.

Young Hotel was built in 1931. <b>A</b> <b>staple</b> in the African-American business district that developed west of the city's core, the hotel was one of the only places in the city during the years of segregation where a traveling African American could find a room.|$|E

5|$|By 1910, Sunday {{began to}} conduct {{meetings}} (usually {{longer than a}} month) in small cities like Youngstown, Wilkes-Barre, South Bend, and Denver, and then finally, between 1915 and 1917, the major cities of Philadelphia, Syracuse, Kansas City, Detroit, Boston, Buffalo, and New York City. During the 1910s, Sunday was front page news in the cities where he held campaigns. Newspapers often printed his sermons in full, and during World War I, local coverage of his campaigns often surpassed that of the war. Sunday {{was the subject of}} over sixty articles in major periodicals, and he was <b>a</b> <b>staple</b> of the religious press regardless of denomination.|$|E
5|$|Defining {{themselves}} as both Swedish and American, the Swedish-American community retained a fascination {{for the old}} country {{and their relationship to}} it. The nostalgic visits to Sweden which had begun in the 1870s continued well into the 20th century, and narratives from these trips formed <b>a</b> <b>staple</b> of the lively Swedish-American publishing companies. The accounts testify to complex feelings, but each contingent of American travellers were freshly indignant at Swedish class pride and Swedish disrespect for women. It was with renewed pride in American culture that they returned to the Midwest.|$|E
5|$|Hearths and oblong shaped ovens {{were found}} in a semicircular hut. The white colour of the soil around the hearth and the ovens found at the site pointed to animal meat roasted in the ovens, likely for {{community}} feeding. Rice was <b>a</b> <b>staple</b> food. Mud boundary walls of houses were traced. Burnt chunks of clay with reed or bamboo impressions suggest that houses were destroyed by fire. Houses were larger in size in the Chalcolithic period compared to the Neolithic period, made of reeds and bamboo with mud plaster and flooring of fired earth. A circular hearth and a few post-holes were also found.|$|E
40|$|Transanal total mesorectal {{excision}} (taTME) is {{an emerging}} technique in rectal cancer surgery. As with all novel techniques, new challenges arise, requiring small modifications. Transanal TME presents the surgeon with a challenge when forming <b>a</b> <b>stapled</b> anastomosis because <b>a</b> linear stapler {{is not used}} to transect the rectum during this procedure, instead the distal rectal wall is divided {{at the start of}} the transanal dissection. This leaves the distal rectal end open, requiring the use of a purse-string suture to close it before <b>a</b> <b>stapled</b> anastomosis can be fashioned. Accurate positioning of the stapler from the transanal side may be difficult without <b>a</b> <b>stapled</b> closure of the distal rectal stump because the shaft of the stapler must pass through the centre of the purse-string. To overcome this, some surgeons have used a long-shaft haemorrhoid stapler, but the functional impact of this stapler with its wider diameter and extra tissue bulk incorporated into the anastomosis is unknown. We present a simple technique that we have devised to facilitate <b>a</b> <b>stapled</b> anastomosis following <b>a</b> transanal TME using a standard circular stapler.

40|$|Since the {{introduction}} of stapling instruments in the 1970 s various studies have compared the results of sutured and <b>stapled</b> bowel anastomoses. <b>A</b> literature search was performed from 1960 to 2010 and articles relating to small bowel, colonic and colorectal anastomotic techniques were reviewed. References from these articles were also reviewed, and relevant articles obtained. Either <b>a</b> <b>stapled</b> or sutured gastrointestinal tract anastomosis is acceptable in most situations. The available evidence suggests that in the following situations, however, particular anastomotic techniques may result in fewer complications: <b>A</b> <b>stapled</b> side-to-side ileocolic anastomosis is preferable following a right hemicolectomy for cancer. <b>A</b> <b>stapled</b> side-to-side anastomosis is likely also preferable after an ileocolic resection for Crohn&#x 2019;s disease. Colorectal anastomoses can be sutured or stapled with similar results, although the incidence of strictures is higher following stapled anastomoses. Following reversal of loop ileostomy {{there is some evidence}} to suggest that <b>a</b> <b>stapled</b> side-to-side anastomosis or sutured enterotomy closure (rather than spout resection and sutured anastomosis) results in fewer complications. Non-randomised data has indicated that small bowel anastomoses are best sutured in the trauma patient. This article reviews the theory, practice and evidence base behind the various gastrointestinal anastomoses to help the practising general surgeon make evidence based operative decisions...|$|R
