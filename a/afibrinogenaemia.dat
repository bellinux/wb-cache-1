40|$|<b>Afibrinogenaemia</b> is an {{autosomal}} recessive disease {{with an estimated}} prevalence of approximately one in a million. The most common symptoms of <b>afibrinogenaemia</b> are umbilical cord bleeding, bleeding into skin, mouth, muscles, gastrointestinal and genitourinary tracts and the central nervous system. Other recognized complications include; haemarthroses, spontaneous splenic rupture, epistaxis, menorrhagia, recurrent abortion and venous and arterial thromboembolism. Bone cysts have also {{been described as a}} rare complication of <b>afibrinogenaemia.</b> The aim {{of this study was to}} conduct a systematic literature review, summarize the reported cases and to report two new cases. Three electronic databases were searched for relevant publications: PubMed, Medline and EMBASE. The following search criteria were used: '(bone cysts OR intraosseous haematoma OR intraosseous haemorrhage) AND (<b>afibrinogenaemia</b> OR fibrinogen deficiency) '. The reference lists of the selected papers were searched for more relevant literature. In total, eight patients had bone cysts as complication of <b>afibrinogenaemia</b> and six of them suffered from pain in their extremities. Bone cysts were primarily located in the vicinity of the cortex or trabeculae in the diaphysis of the long bones, especially in the femora, tibiae and humeri. Some were regressive, probably due to reactive bone remodelling. A number of cysts were filled with serosanguinous fluid. It might be useful to check for bone cysts when patients with congenital <b>afibrinogenaemia</b> complain of 'rheumatic' pains in their extremities. Whole body magnetic resonance imaging is the diagnostic imaging technique of choice. Recurrent episodes of pain, but not radiological deterioration, appear to benefit from prophylactic therapy with fibrinogen concentrate...|$|E
40|$|This article {{reviews the}} {{substantial}} progress made {{in understanding the}} molecular basis of inherited <b>afibrinogenaemia</b> (or congenital <b>afibrinogenaemia),</b> an autosomal recessive disorder characterised by the complete absence of detectable fibrinogen. The identification in 1999 of the first genetic defect, recurrent homozygous deletions of approximately 11 kb of the fibrinogen alpha-chain (FGA) gene, revealed that the disease was caused by defective fibrinogen synthesis, {{and led to the}} subsequent analysis of the three fibrinogen genes in other affected individuals with the identification of numerous causative mutations. Combined analyses of more than thirty unrelated <b>afibrinogenaemia</b> families from various ethnic groups have shown that the majority of patients have truncating mutations in the FGA gene although intuitively all three fibrinogen genes might be equally implicated. These results will facilitate molecular diagnosis of the disorder, permit prenatal diagnosis for families who so desire, and pave the way for new therapeutic approaches such as gene therapy...|$|E
40|$|Objective: To {{investigate}} the doses of antivenom administered to adult patients with severe brown snake envenoming. Design and setting: Review of charts from Western Australian adult teaching hospitals, December 1991 to December 2001. Patients: 35 patients with severe brown snake envenoming, defined prospectively as <b>afibrinogenaemia</b> (< 0. 3 g/L) after a bite by a brown snake (genus Pseudonaja). Main outcome measure: The dose of antivenom required to neutralise venom, defined prospectively as the dose of antivenom given before {{the return of}} detectable fibrinogen levels. Results: Of 88 patients with brown snake envenoming admitted over the 10 years, at least 35 had severe envenoming. <b>Afibrinogenaemia</b> persisted for 10 hours (range, 1. 4 – 68 hours) after the first dose of antivenom; in four patients <b>afibrinogenaemia</b> lasted more than 24 hours. The dose of antivenom given before venom neutralisation ranged from one to 23 ampoules. In two-thirds of cases, venom was neutralised with five ampoules, and 89...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Inherited {{disorders}} of fibrinogen {{are rare}} and affect either the quantity (hypofibrinogenaemia and <b>afibrinogenaemia)</b> or {{the quality of}} the circulating fibrinogen (dysfibrinogenaemia). Extensive allelic heterogeneity has been found for all three disorders: in congenital <b>afibrinogenaemia</b> > 30 mutations, the majority in FGA, have been identified in homozygosity or in compound heterozygosity. Several mutations have also been identified in patients with hypofibrinogenaemia; many of these are heterozygous carriers of <b>afibrinogenaemia</b> null mutations. OBJECTIVE: To report the case of a patient from Slovakia diagnosed with hypofibrinogenaemia characterised by fibrinogen concentrations of around 0. 7 g/l. RESULTS: The patient was found to be heterozygous for a novel missense mutation W 253 C (W 227 C in the mature protein) in the C-terminal globular domain of the fibrinogen gamma chain. Co-expression of the W 253 C FGG mutant cDNA (fibrinogen Bratislava) in combination with wild-type FGA and FGB cDNAs showed that fibrinogen molecules containing the mutant gamma chain can assemble intracellularly but are not secreted into the media, confirming the causative nature of the identified mutation. CONCLUSIONS: Current analysis of fibrinogen Bratislava indicates that the domains important for the processes of hexamer assembly and hexamer secretion should not be considered as strictly restricted to one or other fibrinogen chain...|$|E

40|$|Transfusion of {{allogeneic}} {{blood products}} {{is associated with}} increased morbidity and mortality. Therefore, strategies for reducing transfusion of these products during trauma management are valuable. We report a case of severe blunt abdominal trauma, successfully treated with antifibrinolytic medication and fibrinogen concentrate. Rotational thromboelastometry (ROTEM) was used to identify hyperfibrinolysis and <b>afibrinogenaemia.</b> In order to achieve haemostasis, over a 3 -h period, the patient received a total of 1 g of tranexamic acid, 7 U of packed red blood cells, 16 g of fibrinogen concentrate (Haemocomplettan P), 3500 ml of colloids and 5500 ml of lactated Ringer's solution. Together with surgical measures, this treatment stopped the bleeding and stabilised the patient. There was no transfusion of either fresh-frozen plasma or platelets. The limited need for allogeneic blood products is of particular interest, and clinical studies of the approach used here appear to be warranted...|$|E
40|$|A snake breeder, 47 -years-old man, was {{bitten by}} the saw-scaled viper (Echis carinatus sochureki). After {{admission}} to Toxinology Centre, within 1. 5 h, laboratory evaluation showed clotting times prolonged to non-measurable values, <b>afibrinogenaemia,</b> significantly elevated D-dimers, haemolysis and myoglobin elevation. Currently unavailable antivenom was urgently imported and administered within 10 hours. In 24 hours, oligoanuric acute kidney injury (AKI) and mild {{acute respiratory distress}} syndrome (ARDS) developed. Despite administration of 10 vials of urgently imported Polyvalent Snake Antivenom Saudi Arabia, the venom-induced consumption coagulopathy (VICC) and AKI persisted. Another ten vials of antivenom were imported from abroad. VICC slowly subsided during the antivenom treatment and disappeared after administration of total 20 vials during 5 day period. No signs of haemorrhage were present during treatment. After resolving VICC, patient was transferred to Department of Nephrology for persisting AKI and requirement for haemodialysis. AKI completely resolved after 20 days. Despite rather timed administration of appropriate antivenom, VICC and AKI developed and the quantity of 20 vials was needed to cease acute symptoms of systemic envenoming. The course illustrates low immunogenicity of the venom haemocoagulation components and thus higher requirements of the antivenom in similar cases...|$|E
40|$|Congenital {{fibrinogen}} {{disorders are}} rare diseases affecting either the quantity (<b>afibrinogenaemia</b> and hypofibrinogenaemia) or the quality (dysfibrinogenaemia) or both (hypodysfibrinogenaemia) of fibrinogen. In addition to bleeding, unexpected thrombosis, spontaneous spleen ruptures, painful bone cysts and intrahepatic inclusions can complicate the clinical course {{of patients with}} quantitative fibrinogen disorders. Clinical manifestations of dysfibrinogenaemia include absence of symptoms, major bleeding or thrombosis as well as systemic amyloidosis. Although the diagnosis of any type of congenital fibrinogen disorders is usually not too difficult {{with the help of}} conventional laboratory tests completed by genetic studies, the correlation between all available tests and the clinical manifestations is more problematic in many cases. Improving accuracy of diagnosis, performing genotype, analysing function of fibrinogen variants and carefully investigating the personal and familial histories may lead to a better assessment of patients' phenotype and therefore help in identifying patients at increased risk of adverse clinical outcomes. This review provides an update of various tests (conventional and global assays, molecular testing, fibrin clot analysis) and clinical features, which may help to better predict the phenotype of the different types of congenital fibrinogen disorders...|$|E
40|$|Congenital <b>afibrinogenaemia</b> is an {{autosomal}} recessive disorder characterised by the {{complete absence of}} detectable fibrinogen. We previously identified the first known causative mutations for this disorder in a non-consanguineous Swiss family. The four affected male individuals (two brothers and their first two cousins) were shown to have homozygous deletions of approximately 11 kb of the fibrinogen alpha chain (FGA) gene. Haplotype data suggested that the deletions occurred on three distinct ancestral chromosomes, implying that the FGA region of the fibrinogen locus is susceptible to deletion by a common mechanism, but the sequences responsible for the recombination remained to be identified. Here, we report the detailed characterisation of the deletion by nucleotide sequence analysis of all three deletion junctions and comparison with normal sequences. We found that all three deletions were identical to the base-pair and probably resulted from non-homologous (illegitimate) recombination. The centromeric and telomeric deletion junctions featured both a 7 bp direct repeat, AACTTTT, situated in FGA intron 1 and in the FGA-FGB intergenic sequence {{and a number of}} inverted repeats which could be involved in the generation of secondary structures. Analysis with closely linked flanking polymorphic markers revealed the existence of at least two haplotypes, further suggesting independent origins of the deletions in this family...|$|E
40|$|Summary. Inherited {{deficiencies}} of plasma proteins involved in blood coagulation generally lead to lifelong bleeding disorders. The severity of these disorders is generally {{inversely proportional to}} the degree of factor deficiency. Among all the autoso-mal recessive rare bleeding disorders, which include <b>afibrinogenaemia,</b> factor (F) II, FV, FV + VIII, FVII, FX, FXI, FXIII, the combined deficiency of coag-ulation FV and FVIII (F 5 F 8 D or FV + FVIII) is exceptional because it is due to mutations in genes encoding proteins involved in the FV and FVIII intracellular transport (LMAN 1 and MCFD 2) rather than DNA defects in the genes that encode the corresponding coagulation factors. F 5 F 8 D is estimated to be extremely rare (1 : 1. 000. 000) in the general population, but an increased frequency is observed in regions where consanguineous mar-riages is practiced. F 5 F 8 D is characterized by concomitantly low levels (usually between 5 % and 20 %) of both FV and FVIII, and is associated with a mild to moderate bleeding tendency. Treat-ment of bleeding episodes requires a source of both FV and FVIII; replacement of FV is achieved through the use of fresh frozen plasma, and that of FVIII by desmopressin or specific FVIII con-centrates, plasma-derived or recombinant FVIII products. We focus here on the clinical, mole-cular, treatment-related and diagnostic features o...|$|E
40|$|Frequent {{arterial}} and venous thromboembolism {{in patients}} with congenital <b>afibrinogenaemia</b> (CA) is neither understood nor is a safe and effective treatment established. It was our objective {{to report on the}} clinical observations and laboratory data contributing {{to the understanding of the}} frequency, physiopathology, prognosis and treatment of CA. We observed the long-term clinical course and laboratory data in a cohort of four patients with CA and thromboembolic complications, and conducted a systematic review retrieving all available data. Four patients with CA developed recurrent and extensive arterial and venous thromboembolism (TE) from an age of 25 - 38 years. In two patients, a treatment strategy targeting at maintaining constantly measurable Fbg levels (≥ 0. 5 g/l) either by regular Fbg replacement or by orthotopic liver transplantation resulted in long-term remissions. Radiological imaging documented resolved arterial thrombi after 6 - 12 months. In contrast, recurrent thromboembolic events were observed in two other patients with infrequent Fbg replacement. A systematic review of the literature revealed 48 reports of TE {{in patients with}} CA (median age at first event 31 years), and a favourable outcome in most patients with frequent application of Fbg, aimed at constant measurable trough levels. Present data suggests that patients with CA are at high risk of arterial and venous thromboembolic events, probably caused by thrombin excess owing to lack of thrombin scavenging by Fbg/fibrin. Regular low-dose Fbg replacement might be a safe and effective treatment option in patients with CA and thromboembolic complications...|$|E
