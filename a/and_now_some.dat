25|$|The skikimate pathway is {{a target}} for {{herbicides}} and other non-toxic drugs because the shikimate pathway is not present in humans. Glyphosate, a commonly used herbicide, is an inhibitor of 5-enolpyruvylshikimate 3-phosphate synthase or EPSP synthase, an enzyme in the shikimate pathway. The problem is that this herbicide has been utilized for about 20 years <b>and</b> <b>now</b> <b>some</b> plants have now emerged that are glyphosate-resistant. This has relevance to research on shikimate dehydrogenase because {{it is important to}} maintain diversity in the enzyme blocking process in the shikimate pathway and with more research shikimate dehydrogenase could be the next enzyme to be inhibited in the shikimate pathway. In order to design new inhibitors the structures for all the enzymes in the pathway have needed to be elucidated. The presence of two forms of the enzyme complicate the design of potential drugs because one could compensate for the inhibition of the other. Also there the TIGR data base shows that there are 14 species of bacteria with the two forms of shikimate dehydrogenase. This is a problem for drug makers because there are two enzymes that a potential drug would need to inhibit at the same time.|$|E
2500|$|The anthropic {{idea that}} {{fundamental}} parameters are {{selected from a}} multitude of different possibilities (each actual in some universe or other) contrasts with the traditional hope of physicists for a theory of everything having no free parameters. As Einstein said: [...] "What really interests me is whether God had any choice {{in the creation of}} the world." [...] In 2002, proponents of the leading candidate for a [...] "theory of everything", string theory, proclaimed [...] "the end of the anthropic principle" [...] since there would be no free parameters to select. Ironically, string theory now seems to offer no hope of predicting fundamental parameters, <b>and</b> <b>now</b> <b>some</b> who advocate it invoke the anthropic principle as well (see below).|$|E
2500|$|Road {{departments}} and private industry may apply liquid or powdered magnesium chloride to control dust and erosion on unimproved (dirt or gravel) roads and dusty job {{sites such as}} quarries because it is relatively inexpensive to purchase and apply. Its hygroscopy makes it absorb moisture from the air, {{limiting the number of}} smaller particles (silts and clays) that become airborne. The most significant benefit of applying dust control products is the reduction in gravel road maintenance costs. However, recent research and updates indicate biological toxicity in the environment in plants as an ongoing problem. [...] Since 2001, truckers have complained about [...] "Killer Chemicals" [...] on roads <b>and</b> <b>now</b> <b>some</b> states are backing away from using salt products.|$|E

2500|$|The tractrix horn is {{very similar}} in many respects to the {{exponential}} horn and has gained adherents among DIY horn enthusiasts, audiophile consumers, <b>and</b> <b>now</b> <b>some</b> manufactures as well. [...] It uses a curve formula derived by assuming that a tangent to any point on the horn's inner curve will reach the central axis of the horn with a line segment of set length. At the mouth, the tangent line segment becomes perpendicular to the axis and describes the radius of the mouth. This horn concept was studied by Paul G.A.H. Voigt in the mid-1920s and patented in 1927. The size of the tractrix horn is generated by specifying the desired low frequency [...] "cutoff" [...] or limit which will determine the mouth diameter. Two incremental improvements over the exponential horn include slightly better support for low frequency extension and a somewhat broader high-frequency coverage pattern.|$|E
2500|$|The {{choice to}} {{integrate}} multimodal {{forms in the}} classroom is not accepted unproblematically by everyone in educational communities. In Charles Bazerman’s essay, “The Case for Writing Studies as a Major Discipline,” he states “multimodal compositions are seen in the classrooms across the country but {{there seems to be a}} lack of support from the institutions to advance what the instructors are bringing into the classroom." [...] The idea of learning has changed over the years <b>and</b> <b>now,</b> <b>some</b> argue, must adapt to the personal and affective needs of new students. According to Kress and Bezemer, “education has to accommodate to ‘life-long’, ‘life-wide’ learning, that is, learning at all times, by those who demand that their interests be taken with utmost seriousness, in all sites, in all phases of professional and personal life.” As a result, some administrations may be reluctant to institute wide-spread change without assurance of results. In order for classroom communities to be legitimately multimodal, all members of the community must share expectations about what can be done with through integration, requiring a [...] "shift in many educators’ thinking about what constitutes literacy teaching and learning in a world no longer bounded only by print text." ...|$|E
