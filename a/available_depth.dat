The method traces safety contour, and computes dynamically obstacle areas with instantaneous water level. The feasibility is tested by {{the intersection of the}} subsection in a route and time-varying obstacle areas, and navigable time window is computed. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method can conclude effectively feasibility of the route considering instantaneous water level; moreover it can lead to greater <b>available</b> <b>depths</b> in a route and a shorter distance for safe navigation...|$|R
40|$|This study {{examines}} {{the relationship between}} Pecos River flow rates and in-stream water depth and velocity. Recent studies of the threatened Pecos Bluntnose Shiner Minnow (PBSM) suggest that water depth and water velocity are key parameters in defining minnow habitat preference.

This article discusses available biologic data defining PBSM preferred habitat and develops a predictive model that relates river flows to <b>available</b> <b>depths</b> and velocities across the Pecos River.

25|$|Underwater {{sites are}} inevitably {{difficult}} to access, and more hazardous, compared with working on dry land. In order {{to access the}} site directly, diving equipment and diving skills are necessary. The depths that can be accessed by divers, {{and the length of}} time <b>available</b> at <b>depths,</b> are limited. For deep sites beyond the reach of divers, submarines or remote sensing equipment are needed.|$|R
50|$|A small tidal rise {{spreading}} tidal {{water over}} a large expanse of lagoon or inland backwater causes the influx and efflux of the tide to maintain a deep channel through a narrows no longer confined by a bank on each side, becomes dispersed, and owing to the reduction of its scouring force, is no longer able at a moderate distance from the shore effectually to resist the action of tending to form a continuous beach {{in front of the}} outlet. Hence a bar is produced that diminishes the <b>available</b> <b>depth</b> in the approach channel. By carrying out a solid jetty over the bar, however {{on each side of the}} outlet, the tidal currents are concentrated in the channel across the bar, and lower it by scour. Thus the <b>available</b> <b>depth</b> of the approach channels to Venice through the Malamocco and Lido outlets from the Venetian Lagoon have been deepened several feet (metres) over their bars by jetties of rubble, carried out across the foreshore into deep water on both sides of the channel. Other examples are provided by the long jetties extended into the sea in front of the entrance to Charleston harbour, formerly constructed of fascines weighed down with stone and logs, but subsequently of rubble stone, and by the two converging rubble jetties carried out from each shore of Dublin Bay for deepening the approach to Dublin harbour.|$|E

50|$|Canalization secures a {{definite}} <b>available</b> <b>depth</b> for navigation; and {{the discharge of}} the river generally is amply sufficient for maintaining the impounded water level, {{as well as providing}} the necessary water for locking. Navigation, however, is liable to be stopped during the descent of high floods, which in many cases rise above the locks; and it is necessarily arrested in cold climates on all rivers by long, severe frosts, and especially by ice. Many small rivers, like the Thames above its tidal limit, have been rendered navigable by canalization, and several fairly large rivers have thereby provided a good depth for vessels for considerable distances inland. Thus the canalized Seine has secured a navigable depth of 10 feet (3.2 metres) from its tidal limit up to Paris, a distance of 135 miles, and a depth of 6 feet (2.06 metres) up to Montereau, 62 miles higher up.|$|E

Adjacent to the loading quay, a waiting berth for ore carriers is available.

50|$|Even though, in places, {{hydrographic survey}} data may be {{collected}} in sufficient detail to portray bottom topography in some areas, hydrographic charts only show depth information relevant for safe navigation {{and should not}} be considered as a product that accurately portrays the actual shape of the bottom. The soundings selected from the raw source depth data for placement on the nautical chart are selected for safe navigation and are biased to show predominately the shallowest depths that relate to safe navigation. For instance, if there is a deep area that can not be reached because it is surrounded by shallow water, the deep area may not be shown. The color filled areas that show different ranges of shallow water are not the equivalent of contours on a topographic map since they are often drawn seaward of the actual shallowest depth portrayed. A bathymetric chart does show marine topology accurately. Details covering the above limitations can be found in Part 1 of Bowditch's American Practical Navigator. Another concept that affects safe navigation is the sparsity of detailed depth data from high resolution sonar systems. In more remote areas, the only <b>available</b> <b>depth</b> information has been collected with lead lines. This collection method drops a weighted line to the bottom at intervals and records the depth, often from a rowboat or sail boat. There is no data between soundings or between sounding lines to guarantee {{that there is not a}} hazard such as a wreck or a coral head waiting there to ruin a sailor's day. Often, the navigation of the collecting boat does not match today's GPS navigational accuracies. The hydrographic chart will use the best data available and will caveat its nature in a caution note or in the legend of the chart.|$|E

40|$|Depth image based {{rendering}} (DIBR) is {{the process}} of synthesizing new ``virtual'' views from a set of ``real'' views which include color and depth images. Because of its photorealism and less stringent computational requirement, DIBR has many applications such as 3 D TV, remote reality, and video conferencing, and {{has become one of the}} hot research areas in visual computing in recent years. Since the general purpose graphics processing unit (GPGPU) is an ideal computing platform for image rendering, we consciously develop a novel and necessary image processing algorithm suitable for GPGPU by exploiting massive parallelism. The proposed 3 D propagation algorithm for DIBR combines images from multiple color and depth cameras at arbitrary positions in 3 D space and efficiently renders novel images at arbitrary virtual views by propagating all <b>available</b> <b>depth</b> information from depth cameras to color cameras, and then all <b>available</b> <b>depth</b> and color information from the color cameras to the virtual views. Furthermore, we consider the case when only low resolution depth images are obtained. A novel depth filling and enhancement technique for enhancing depth image quality using high resolution color images is proposed and significantly improves the rendering quality. Finally, the paper also describes the abundant but irregular parallelism of our algorithm and outlines a mapping onto massively parallel architectures such as GPGPUs...|$|E
40|$|We {{proposed}} {{to construct a}} complete bathymetric map of the oceans at a 3 - 10 km resolution by combining all of the <b>available</b> <b>depth</b> soundings collected over the past 30 years with high resolution marine gravity {{information provided by the}} Geosat, ERS- 1 / 2, and Topex/Poseidon altimeters. Detailed bathymetry is essential for understanding physical oceanography and marine geophysics. Currents and tides are controlled by the overall shapes of the ocean basins as well as the smaller sharp ocean ridges and seamounts. Because erosion rates are low in the deep oceans, detailed bathymetry reveals the mantle convection patterns, the plate boundaries, the cooling/subsidence of the oceanic lithosphere, the oceanic plateaus, and the distribution of off-ridge volcanoes. We {{proposed to}}: (1) Accumulate all <b>available</b> <b>depth</b> soundings collected over the past 30 years; (2) Use the short wavelength (< 160 km) satellite gravity information to interpolate between sparse ship soundings; (3) Improve the resolution of the marine gravity field using enhanced estimates along repeat altimeter profiles together with the dense altimeter measurements; (4) Refine/improve bathymetric predictions using the improved resolution gravity field and also by investigating computer-intensive methods for bathymetric prediction such as inverse theory; and (5) Produce a 'Globe of the Earth' similar to the globe of Venus prepared by the NASA Magellan investigation.

In this paper, we present a method for real-time haptic interaction with videos containing depth data. Forces are computed based on the depth information. Spatial and temporal filtering of the depth stream is used to provide stability of force feedback delivered to the haptic device. Fast collision detection ensures the proposed approach {{to be used in}} real-time. The usefulness of the approach is illustrated by a tangible video application example...|$|E

40|$|The {{stable isotope}} {{compositions}} of soil water (δ 2 H and δ 18 O) carry important {{information about the}} prevailing soil hydrological conditions and for constraining ecosystem water budgets. However, they are highly dynamic, especially during and after precipitation events. In this study, we present an application of a method based on gas-permeable tubing and isotope-specific infrared laser absorption spectroscopy for in situ determination of soil water δ 2 H and δ 18 O. We conducted a laboratory experiment where a sand column was initially saturated, exposed to evaporation {{for a period of}} 290 days, and finally rewatered. Soil water vapor δ 2 H and δ 18 O were measured daily at each of eight <b>available</b> <b>depths.</b> Soil liquid water δ 2 H and δ 18 O were inferred from those of the vapor considering thermodynamic equilibrium between liquid and vapor phases in the soil. The experimental setup allowed for following the evolution of soil water δ 2 H and δ 18 O profiles with a daily temporal resolution. As the soil dried, we could also show {{for the first time the}} increasing influence of the isotopically depleted ambient water vapor on the isotopically enriched liquid water close to the soil surface (i. e., atmospheric invasion). Rewatering at the end of the experiment led to instantaneous resetting of the stable isotope profiles, which could be closely followed with the new method...|$|R
