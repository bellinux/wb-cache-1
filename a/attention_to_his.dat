5|$|By {{contrast}} Sherman was {{a popular}} hero in the North and well regarded by his soldiers. Military historians have paid special <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> Atlanta campaign and the March to the Sea, generally giving him high marks as an innovative strategist and quick-witted tactician.|$|E
5|$|In Europe, audiences {{had a very}} {{different}} take on his work. Many perceived it as a subversive and Marxist satire on American capitalism. If not subversive, {{it was at least}} considered a Marxist critique of pop culture. Given Warhol's apolitical outlook in general this is not likely the intended message. It is likely that his pop art was nothing more than an attempt to attract <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> work.|$|E

5|$|A {{production}} called Madman Muntz: American Maverick was screened at film festivals through 2007. Directed by Dan Bunker and Judy ver Mehr, it {{was produced}} by Jim Castoro, an owner of an original Muntz Jet. The film was an official 2005 selection at the San Fernando Valley International Film Festival and the Ole Muddy Film Festival. The film documents Muntz's life, paying particular <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> colorful career, and includes interviews with people who knew him and home movie footage contributed by his children.|$|E
5|$|Beckett grew up idolizing fellow Texans Nolan Ryan and Roger Clemens. As a youth, he starred on Little League All-Star teams. He later {{attended}} Spring High School in Spring, Texas. He {{had trouble}} with grades and not paying <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> coach during his freshman year. His coach was so frustrated with him he threw him off the team. He went through a growth spurt before his sophomore year and added speed to his fastball. He also raised his GPA {{and was able to}} get back on the team, where he had a 9–3 record with a 1.18 earned run average (ERA) as a sophomore, tossing three no-hitters.|$|E
5|$|By 23BC, {{some of the}} un-Republican {{implications}} {{were becoming}} apparent concerning the settlement of 27BC. Augustus' retention of an annual consulate drew <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> de facto dominance over the Roman political system, and cut in half the opportunities for others to achieve what was still nominally the preeminent position in the Roman state. Further, he was causing political problems by desiring to have his nephew Marcus Claudius Marcellus follow in his footsteps and eventually assume the Principate in his turn, alienating his three greatest supporters– Agrippa, Maecenas, and Livia. Feeling pressure from his core group of adherents, Augustus turned to the Senate for help.|$|E

His wife has found a lucrative new {{vocation}} in his absence, teaming with her sister Lyde to run Evander's butcher shop. She asks her husband to consider joining them. Pullo, at a loss as to where to go or what to do next, turns <b>his</b> <b>attentions</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> rescued slave, Eirene.|$|R
5|$|During the 1860s and 1870s Verdi paid great <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> estate around Busseto, {{purchasing}} additional land, {{dealing with}} unsatisfactory (in one case, embezzling) stewards, installing irrigation, and coping with variable harvests and economic slumps. In 1867, both Verdi's father Carlo, {{with whom he}} had restored good relations, and his early patron and father-in-law Antonio Barezzi, died. Verdi and Giuseppina decided to adopt Carlo's great-niece Filomena Maria Verdi, then seven years old, as their own child. She was to marry in 1878 the son of Verdi's friend and lawyer Angelo Carrara and her family became eventually the heirs of Verdi's estate.|$|E
5|$|In 1880 Sienkiewicz wrote a {{historical}} novella, Niewola tatarska (Tartar Captivity). In late 1881 he became editor-in-chief {{of a new}} Warsaw newspaper, Słowo (The Word). This substantially improved his finances. The year 1882 saw him heavily engaged in {{the running of the}} newspaper, in which he published a number of columns and short stories. Soon, however, he lost interest in the journalistic aspect and decided to focus more on his literary work. He paid less and less <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> post of editor-in-chief, resigning it in 1887 but remaining editor of the paper's literary section until 1892.|$|E
5|$|In time, Prus {{adopted the}} French Positivist critic Hippolyte Taine's {{concept of the}} arts, {{including}} literature, as a second means, alongside the sciences, of studying reality, and he devoted more <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> sideline of short-story writer. Prus' stories, which met with great acclaim, owed much to the literary influence of Polish novelist Józef Ignacy Kraszewski and, among English-language writers, to Charles Dickens and Mark Twain. His fiction would also be influenced by French writers Victor Hugo, Gustave Flaubert, Alphonse Daudet and Émile Zola.|$|E

60|$|She {{felt the}} more that she was right in this decision, when she {{encountered}} her father's broad grin of surprise and diversion, at seeing the young Baron help her to dismount. It was a look of receiving an idea both new, comical, and flattering, {{but by no means}} the look of a father who would resent the indignity of <b>attentions</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> daughter from a man whose rank formed an insuperable barrier to marriage.|$|R
5|$|O'Donoghue complained {{directly}} to Belushi {{that he thought}} his parody of Shatner during the dress rehearsals was inadequate and needed much improvement. Further, actor Chevy Chase was annoyed that he was satirizing Leonard Nimoy as Spock; {{he did not like}} the idea of playing second-fiddle to Belushi. During all of the rehearsals, Chase attempted to attract more <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> character's role and dominate the scene. Just prior to the actual on-air performance of the sketch, O'Donoghue admonished Belushi and implored him to perform an effective parody. Belushi's dress rehearsal performance had worried executives so much that they had discussed canceling the entire sketch altogether.|$|E
5|$|With {{the help}} of several of Roger's friends, Barbara {{attempts}} to oversee his finances and takes {{him out of the}} still-chaotic city. At Tamworth, Roger gradually becomes worse and dies. Stricken and in mourning, Barbara holds a public memorial in London for her deceased husband, despite being warned that it would draw <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> estate during the Parliamentary inquest into the financial crisis. To give her peace, the Duchess develops a scheme of spiriting her granddaughter out of the country by having her visit their plantation in Virginia. The novel ends with Barbara and several servants leaving on a ship intended for the colonies.|$|E
5|$|Francis has {{individualized}} features, to {{the point}} that the <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> face gives it the quality of a portrait such as van Eyck's c. 1431 Portrait of Cardinal Niccolò Albergati. The head and face are minutely detailed. Francis is in his mid-thirties, wears stubble and has a somewhat jowly face and receding hairline. He is presented as a highly intelligent but perhaps detached and impassive individual. He is given a complex and inscrutable expression; physiological traits not uncommon in contemporary Flemish painting. He kneels on a bed of flowers, and his heavy robe and folded drapery have a choppy and overflowing feel. His lower limbs seem disconnected, positioned in an anti-naturalistic manner; giving the impression that he is levitating.|$|E

5|$|Inspired by German and American examples, he {{successfully}} {{asked the}} council to construct a system of villas at Bexley, advocated the separate treatment of acute and chronic cases, and introduced parole-style rewards for 'industrious' patients. Like some of his earlier administrative innovations, villas became popular and inspired similar designs elsewhere. Stansfield also served in the Royal Army Medical Corps during World War I, and as a consultant on nervous diseases to the Eastern Command. Although he was appointed a CBE in 1919 for his war work, historians have drawn <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> scepticism about shell shock, his attitudes towards eugenics and heredity, and his potentially misogynistic views about medical officers marrying. He nonetheless married twice, settling with his first wife at a house in Wimbledon where he enjoyed tending to the gardens; after her death, he married a second time in 1929 {{and moved to a}} villa in Sanremo, Italy, where he lived out his retirement.|$|E
5|$|Moving to Northern California, McNallen began {{a career}} as a school teacher; during the summer {{vacations}} he travelled the world as a military journalist, writing articles for Soldier of Fortune magazine. Concerned by what he saw as the growth of liberal, universalist ideas in Heathenry, he returned to active involvement in the Heathen movement in the mid-1990s, establishing the Asatrú Folk Assembly, which was headquartered in Grass Valley, California. In 1997 he was involved in the establishment of the International Asatru/Odinist Alliance alongside Murray's AA and the British Odinic Rite. He brought greater <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> group after they became involved in the debate surrounding the Kennewick Man, arguing that it constituted evidence for a European presence in prehistoric America. In the 21st century he became more politically active, becoming involved in both environmentalist campaigns and a group promoting the rights of European Americans.|$|E
5|$|On July 5, 1861, at {{nineteen}} Myers {{became a}} teller and cashier at the Mohawk Valley Bank. General Francis E. Spinner was the {{treasurer of the}} bank at the time. His first year as a trainee was without pay. Myers then received a salary of $100 per year, being higher than normal since he put in extra <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> work habits. He opened his own little telegraph office in July 1863 within the counting office of the bank. This was the first telegraph office for the town of Mohawk, New York. He constructed all the necessary telegraph equipment needed and taught himself Morse code. Myers' income from this bank telegraph business was one-half of his total income. He eventually {{had to give up}} being a part-time telegraph operator within the bank, as his bank responsibilities took up most of his time. He turned over the telegraph business to the local post office with Austin Shall as the operator.|$|E
50|$|The {{description}} of Bach's last position as Thomascantor is relatively short, with most <b>attention</b> going <b>to</b> <b>his</b> visit <b>to</b> Potsdam in 1747, and the composer's death in 1750 (pp. 166-167).|$|R
50|$|After {{failing in}} railway reform, Greenway turned <b>his</b> <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> education. <b>His</b> {{controversial}} reforms of Manitoba's school system provoked a national {{crisis in the}} 1890s, and are still regarded as his administration's most notable accomplishment.|$|R
50|$|In {{later years}} Low turned <b>his</b> <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> {{developing}} <b>his</b> own properties. He built the Sans Souci hotel and {{factories in the}} Town of Ballston (Saratoga County). Low Street in Ballston Spa is named after him.|$|R
5|$|The February 1974 {{election}} {{proved to}} be the high water-mark of Thorpe's career. Thereafter his and his party's fortunes declined, particularly from late 1975 when rumours of his involvement in a plot to murder Scott began to multiply. Thorpe finally resigned the leadership in May 1976, when his position became untenable. When the matter came to court three years later, Thorpe chose not to give evidence {{on the grounds that the}} prosecution had not established its case. This stance left many questions unanswered; despite his acquittal, Thorpe was discredited and could not return to public life. From the mid-1980s he was disabled by Parkinson's disease. During his long retirement he gradually recovered the affections of his party, and by the time of his death was honoured by a later generation of leaders, who drew <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> record as an internationalist, a supporter of human rights, and an opponent of apartheid and all forms of racism.|$|E
5|$|The pilot episode, {{which was}} filmed {{over a period}} of 21 days, served as the basis for {{additional}} tweaking of intended story lines. Long creative discussions took place among the writers and the network, leading to the postponement of the filming of the second episode for fourteen months. One major change was the addition of extra material for Brother Justin's side of the story. Brother Justin was originally conceived as a well-established preacher, and as a recurring character rather than a regular one. However, after perusing the preliminary version of the pilot, Knauf and the producers realized that {{there was no room for}} Justin to grow in a television series. Hence, it was decided to make Brother Justin an ordinary Methodist minister in a small town, setting him back in his career by about one or two years. Expanding Brother Justin's role opened new possibilities, and his sister Iris was created as a supporting character. Little was changed on Ben Hawkins' side except for the addition of the cootch (striptease) family; a Carnivàle consultant had elated the producers by calling <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> research about families managing cootch shows in the 1930s.|$|E
5|$|Verdi paid close <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> {{financial}} contracts, {{making sure}} he was appropriately remunerated as his popularity increased. For I Lombardi and Ernani (1844) in Venice he was paid 12,000 lire (including supervision of the productions); Attila and Macbeth (1847), each brought him 18,000 lire. His contracts with the publishers Ricordi in 1847 were very specific about the amounts he was to receive for new works, first productions, musical arrangements, and so on. He began to use his growing prosperity to invest in land near his birthplace. In 1844 he purchased Il Pulgaro, 62 acres (23 hectares) of farmland with a farmhouse and outbuildings, providing a home for his parents from May 1844. Later that year, he also bought the Palazzo Cavalli ({{now known as the}} Palazzo Orlandi) on the via Roma, Busseto's main street. In May 1848, Verdi signed a contract for land and houses at Sant'Agata in Busseto, which had once belonged to his family. It was here he built his own house, completed in 1880, now known as the Villa Verdi, where he lived from 1851 until his death.|$|E
