50|$|The {{atomic mass}} and {{relative}} isotopic mass are sometimes confused, or incorrectly used, as synonyms of standard <b>atomic</b> <b>weight</b> (also known as <b>atomic</b> <b>weight)</b> {{and the standard}} <b>atomic</b> <b>weight</b> (a particular variety of <b>atomic</b> <b>weight,</b> {{in the sense that}} is a standardized <b>atomic</b> <b>weight).</b> However, as noted in the introduction, <b>atomic</b> <b>weight</b> and standard <b>atomic</b> <b>weight</b> represent terms for (abundance-weighted) averages of atomic masses in elemental samples, not for single nuclides. As such, <b>atomic</b> <b>weight</b> and standard <b>atomic</b> <b>weight</b> often differ numerically from relative isotopic mass and atomic mass, and they can also have different units than atomic mass when this quantity is not expressed in unified atomic mass units (see the linked article for <b>atomic</b> <b>weight).</b>|$|R

50|$|Dmitri Mendeleev {{claimed that}} he {{arranged}} his first periodic tables in order of <b>atomic</b> <b>weight</b> ("Atomgewicht").

5000|$|The {{well-known}} standard <b>atomic</b> <b>weight,</b> or <b>atomic</b> <b>weight,</b> is {{a specific}} usage of relative atomic mass: it is the relative atomic mass, with the sources being terrestrial (taken from Earth).

50|$|In {{the early}} 20th century, {{measurements}} of the <b>atomic</b> <b>weight</b> of lead showed significant variations depending {{on the origin of}} the sample. These differences were considered to be an exception attributed to lead isotopes being products of the natural radioactive decay chains of uranium. In 1930s, however, Malcolm Dole reported that the <b>atomic</b> <b>weight</b> of oxygen in air was slightly different from that in water. Soon thereafter, Alfred Nier reported natural variation in the isotopic composition of carbon. It was becoming clear that <b>atomic</b> <b>weights</b> are not constants of nature. At the Commission’s meeting in 1951, it was recognized that the isotopic-abundance variation of sulfur had a significant effect on the internationally accepted value of an <b>atomic</b> <b>weight.</b> In order to indicate the span of atomic-weight values that may apply to sulfur from different natural sources, the value ± 0.003 was attached to the <b>atomic</b> <b>weight</b> of sulfur.

40|$|John Dalton first {{proposed}} {{the concept of}} <b>atomic</b> <b>weights</b> of the elements {{in the first decade}} of the nineteenth century. These <b>atomic</b> <b>weights</b> of the chemical elements were thought of as constants of nature, similar to the speed of light. Dmitri Mendeleev arranged the <b>atomic</b> <b>weights</b> of the elements in ascending order of value and used the systematic variation of their chemical properties to produce his Periodic Table of the Elements in 1869. Measurement of <b>atomic</b> <b>weight</b> values became an important chemical activity for a century and a half. Theodore Richards received a Noble Prize for his work in this area. In 1913, Fredrick Soddy found a species of radium, which had an <b>atomic</b> <b>weight</b> value of 228, compared to the familiar radium gas value of 226. Soddy coined the term 'isotope' (Greek for 'in the same place') to account for this second <b>atomic</b> <b>weight</b> value in the radium position of the Periodic Table. Both of these isotopes of radium are radioactive. Radioactive isotopes are energetically unstable and will decay (disintegrate) over time. The time it takes for one half of a sample of a given radioactive isotope to decay is the half-life of that isotope. In addition to having different <b>atomic</b> <b>weight</b> values, radium- 226 and radium- 228 also have different half-life values. Around the same time as Soddy's work, J. J. Thomson (discoverer of the electron) identified two stable (non-radioactive) isotopes of the same element, neon. Over the next 40 years, the majority of the known chemical elements were found to have two or more stable (or long-lived radioactive isotopes that contribute significantly to the determination of the <b>atomic</b> <b>weights</b> of the elements) ...|$|R

However, more careful measurements of the <b>atomic</b> <b>weights,</b> such as those compiled by Jöns Jakob Berzelius in 1828 or Edward Turner in 1832, appeared to disprove it.
