5|$|I don't see {{the point}} of playing in a band and going just one way when you can do everything. It would be {{impossible}} for us to play just death metal; that is our roots, but we are now a mishmash of everything, and not purists to any form of music. It's impossible for us to do that, <b>and</b> <b>quite</b> <b>frankly</b> I would think of it as boring to be in a band that plays just metal music. We're not afraid to experiment, or to be caught with our pants down, so to speak. That's what keeps us going.|$|E

2500|$|Eventually, Schultzberg {{did indeed}} leave the band in September 1996, on a United States tour. Before going on stage {{for their first}} show {{in the state of}} New York, Olsdal {{informed}} Schultzberg that he wasn't going on the tour in Germany that was following the US one. At the manager's request, Schultzberg did two more shows with the band in Paris after the US tour, the last of which was a performance on the French TV series Nulle part ailleurs. According to Schultzberg [...] "Molko said that he was 'tired of being the focus of Robert's rages against the world', <b>and</b> <b>quite</b> <b>frankly,</b> I was tired of being his". While Schultzberg was with the band, several early works were recorded, including their first 7" [...] single [...] "Bruise Pristine", the [...] "Come Home" [...] EP, the single version of [...] "Nancy Boy" [...] (with B-sides [...] "Slackerbitch", [...] "Miss Moneypenny" [...] and the Smiths cover [...] "Bigmouth Strikes Again") and their eponymous debut album. On the track [...] "I Know", Schultzberg played didgeridoo as well as drums. Hewitt eventually joined Placebo as a full-time member at Molko's request.|$|E

2500|$|Jones, a Sydney-based broadcaster, has criticised Sydney Lord Mayor Clover Moore's {{efforts to}} close lane ways and parking {{areas in the}} city of Sydney to cars. Jones says that this unduly inconveniences long-distance commuters and {{adversely}} affects city based businesses. On 29 June 2011, Jones said of the Lord Mayor of Sydney ... "put her in the same chaff bag as Julia Gillard and throw them both out to sea" [...] and about Greens leader Bob Brown ... "The woman's [...] off her tree <b>and</b> <b>quite</b> <b>frankly</b> they should shove her and Bob Brown in a chaff bag and take them as far out to sea as they can and tell them to swim home." [...] In February 2011, Jones asked Gillard on-air how she felt about being called [...] "Ju-liar" [...] and that [...] "......are saying that we've got a liar running the country" [...] following the reversal of her pre-election pledge not to introduce a new carbon tax. He also criticised her for being 10 minutes late for his program. These comments attracted condemnation from critics, including ABC Television's Jonathan Holmes of Media Watch.|$|E
2500|$|Recording artist Prince {{played the}} guitar on three {{songs from the}} album, [...] "Like a Prayer", [...] "Keep It Together", and [...] "Act of Contrition", though he {{remained}} uncredited. [...] Prince and Madonna also worked together on the track [...] "Love Song". The song was recorded at Prince's Studio on Paisley Park; [...] "We were friends and talked about working together, so I went to Minneapolis to write some stuff with him, {{but the only thing}} I really dug was 'Love Song' [...] We ended up writing it long-distance, because I had to be in L.A. and he couldn't leave Minneapolis, <b>and</b> <b>quite</b> <b>frankly</b> I couldn't stand Minneapolis. When I went there, it was like 20 degrees below zero, and it was really desolate. I was miserable and I couldn't write or work under those circumstances", Madonna recalled. [...] For the artwork, the singer chose to work with photographer Herb Ritts. Initially, photos from the session with Ritts were also to be used for the lead single's packaging. For the photoshoot, she decided to dye her blonde hair brown; she commented [...] "I love blonde hair, but it really does something different to you. I feel more grounded when I have dark hair. It's unexplainable. I also feel more Italian when my hair is dark". The cover art features a close-up of the singer's jean-clad midsection and bare midriff. The cover has been seen as a reference to Sticky Fingers by The Rolling Stones. The packaging on the first pressings of the CD, cassette, and LP were scented with patchouli oils to simulate church incense. [...] A publicist for Warner Bros. Records revealed this had been the singer's idea; [...] "She wanted to create a flavor of the 60's and the church. She wanted to create a sensual feeling you could hear and smell". Initial pressings also included an insert with safe sex guidelines and a warning about the dangers of AIDS, to which Madonna had lost friends. Its inclusion was decided after Warner Bros. had agreed to release an album by stand-up comedian Sam Kinison the year before, although he had stated that AIDS came from gay men involved in bestiality. Madonna dedicated the album to [...] "My mother, who taught me how to pray".|$|E
6000|$|She {{remained}} {{after she}} had spoken; it was like holding a parley with a possible adversary, and her intense, her exalted little smile asked for formal leave. [...] "May I come nearer now?" [...] she seemed to say--as to which, however, the next minute, she saw Charlotte's reply lose itself in a strange process, a thing of several sharp stages, which she could stand there and trace. The dread, after a minute, had dropped from her face; though, discernibly enough, she still couldn't believe in her having, in so strange a fashion, been deliberately made up to. If she had been made up to, at least, it was with an idea--the idea that had struck her at first as necessarily dangerous. That it wasn't, insistently wasn't, this shone from Maggie with a force finally not to be resisted; and on that perception, on the immense relief so constituted, everything had {{by the end of}} three minutes extraordinarily changed. Maggie had come out to her, really, because she knew her doomed, doomed to a separation that was like a knife in her heart; and in the very sight of her uncontrollable, her blinded physical quest of a peace not to be grasped, something of Mrs. Assingham's picture of her as thrown, for a grim future, beyond the great sea and the great continent had at first found fulfilment. She had got away, in this fashion--burning behind her, almost, the ships of disguise--to let her horror of what was before her play up without witnesses; and even after Maggie's approach had presented an innocent front it was still not to be mistaken that she bristled with the signs of her extremity. It was not to be said for them, either, that they were draped at this hour in any of her usual graces; unveiled and all but unashamed, they were tragic to the Princess in spite of the dissimulation that, with the return of comparative confidence, was so promptly to operate. How tragic, in essence, the very change made vivid, the instant stiffening of the spring of pride--this for possible defence if not for possible aggression. Pride indeed, the next moment, had become the mantle caught up for protection and perversity; she flung it round her as a denial of any loss of her freedom. To be doomed was, in her situation, to have extravagantly incurred a doom, so that to confess to wretchedness was, by the same stroke, to confess to falsity. She wouldn't confess, she didn't--a thousand times no; she only cast about her, <b>and</b> <b>quite</b> <b>frankly</b> and fiercely, for something else that would give colour to her having burst her bonds. Her eyes expanded, her bosom heaved as she invoked it, and the effect upon Maggie was verily to wish she could only help her to it. She presently got up--which seemed to mean [...] "Oh, stay if you like!" [...] and when she had moved about awhile at random, looking away, looking at anything, at everything but her visitor; when she had spoken of the temperature and declared that she revelled in it; when she had uttered her thanks for the book, which, a little incoherently, with her second volume, she perhaps found less clever than she expected; when she had let Maggie approach sufficiently closer to lay, untouched, the tribute in question on a bench and take up obligingly its superfluous mate: when she had done these things she sat down in another place, more or less visibly in possession of her part. Our young woman was to have passed, in all her adventure, no stranger moments; for she not only now saw her companion fairly agree to take her then for the poor little person she was finding it so easy to appear, but fell, in a secret, responsive ecstasy, to wondering if there were not some supreme abjection with which she might be inspired. Vague, but increasingly brighter, this possibility glimmered on her. It at last hung there adequately plain to Charlotte that she had presented herself once more to (as they said) grovel; and that, truly, made the stage large. It had absolutely, within the time, taken on the dazzling merit of being large for each of them alike.|$|E

Jim was a great wag and a delightful story teller, but he was in deadly earnest as a reformer, and always ready to speak on The Single Tax. He took his art very seriously also, and was one of the best stage directors of his day.

40|$|The {{question}} of whether the state has the right to “take” (in the form of regulation) land in its coastal zones is a much more complex question that the courts, to date, {{have not been able to}} manage adequately. The problems faced along the coasts are difficult problems, and will likely not be settled by asking judges to determine the “rightness” of claims made through an adversarial process that tends to oversimplify situations in the process of constructing winnable legal arguments. Nor can we rely simply on administrative agencies or legislatures to protect the rights of individuals or protect them adequately from natural disasters. Clearly, the citizenry needs to be more active in these matters, and the administrative process needs to be both transparent <b>and</b> simplified. <b>Quite</b> <b>frankly,</b> it makes as much sense to have these cases drag out over decades as it does to have them framed in a way that oversimplifies the complex political challenges facing the governments attempting to regulate their coasts. The courts should stand ready to engage in oversight of these processes; but, if we can learn anything from Palazzolo, it may be that litigating with an overly simple goal of increasing private property rights could, in fact, only make matters more difficult because it will force the courts to continue muddling the waters of the takings clause. From a social science perspective, the longer the resolution, the more complicated and difficult the situation becomes. Prolonging the process into decades, then, is the last thing that should happen...|$|R
