5|$|A {{few days}} prior to Irma's passage, the Philippines {{archipelago}} was affected by Typhoon Hazen, which left 2,000homeless. As Irma neared landfall, radio and television authorities warned residents to take precautions. Relief <b>agencies</b> <b>were</b> placed on standby. Schools were closed. Much of the Philippines, including {{the capital city of}} Manila, was placed on typhoon alert.|$|E
5|$|According to the Philippine Red Cross, 26,845 {{families}} necessitated emergency assistance. Government <b>agencies</b> <b>were</b> {{ordered to}} arrest profiteers, hoarders and looters. President Ferdinand Marcos ordered all relief agencies to submit damage reports so emergency funds can be issued.|$|E
5|$|Hospice is a {{competitive}} business. In any given service area, {{there may be}} hundreds of different non-profit and commercial providers. Hospices can be small community-based operations, part of regional and national corporations, or part of a hospital or other health system. Data from the National Hospice and Palliative Care Organization indicated that in 2008 58.3% of hospice <b>agencies</b> <b>were</b> independent, with 20.8% based in hospitals, 19.7% geared for home health care and 1.3% in conjunction with nursing homes. In 2007, {{the mean number of}} patients being treated in hospice facilities on any given day was 90.2. 79.4% of hospice providers admitted fewer than 500 patients per year. The number of for-profit and non-profit providers has become more balanced as the for-profit sector has grown. In 2007, 47.1% of <b>agencies</b> <b>were</b> for-profit, with 48.6% non-profit. The remaining 4.3% were government-owned providers.|$|E
50|$|The USG {{has three}} {{different}} types of agencies; independent, quasi-independent, and joint. Independent <b>agencies</b> <b>are</b> <b>agencies</b> that <b>are</b> not aligned with the Legislative or Executive Branches. Ultimately the President is responsible for ensuring that these <b>agencies</b> <b>are</b> functioning properly. Quasi-Independent <b>are</b> <b>agencies</b> that report directly to the President. Joint <b>Agencies</b> <b>are</b> <b>agencies</b> that <b>are</b> created by the President and the Senate.|$|R

30|$|Perception of {{successful}} <b>agency</b> <b>is</b> {{a sense of}} determination {{to be successful in}} pursuing goals, by which hope is fueled (Snyder et al., 1991). Perception {{of successful}} <b>agency</b> <b>is</b> conceptually similar to self-efficacy, and they are shown to be positively and moderately correlated (Magaletta & Oliver, 1999). However, successful <b>agency</b> <b>is</b> more future-oriented than is self-efficacy (Snyder et al., 1991). Thus, perception of successful <b>agency</b> <b>is</b> more closely related to achievement goals compared to self-efficacy.|$|R
5|$|According to a {{study by}} economists at St Gallen University credit rating {{agencies}} have fuelled rising euro zone indebtedness by issuing more severe downgrades since the sovereign debt crisis unfolded in 2009. The authors concluded that rating <b>agencies</b> <b>were</b> not consistent in their judgments, on average rating Portugal, Ireland, and Greece 2.3 notches lower than under pre-crisis standards, eventually forcing them to seek international aid. On a side note: as of end of November 2013 only three countries in the eurozone retain AAA ratings from Standard & Poor, i.e. Germany, Finland and Luxembourg.|$|E
5|$|Faced with a poor {{economy in}} 1974, Filipino President, Ferdinand Marcos {{implemented}} a labour code which began his country's export of labour {{in the form}} of overseas workers. The Philippine government encouraged this labour export to reduce the unemployment rate and enrich its treasury with the workers' remittances. The economy of the Philippines became increasingly dependent on labour export; in 1978 labour-export recruiting <b>agencies</b> <b>were</b> privatised, and became a cornerstone of the economy.|$|E
5|$|River {{development}} {{occurred within}} {{the structure of}} the 1909 International Boundary Waters Treaty between the US and Canada. The United States Congress passed the Rivers and Harbors Act of 1925, which directed the Army Corps of Engineers and the Federal Power Commission to explore the development of the nation's rivers. This prompted agencies to conduct the first formal financial analysis of hydroelectric development; the reports produced by various <b>agencies</b> <b>were</b> presented in House Document308. Those reports, and subsequent related reports, are referred to as 308 Reports.|$|E
50|$|The <b>agency</b> <b>was</b> first {{established}} in 1967. In 1974, the <b>agency</b> <b>was</b> incorporated into New Jersey Department of the Public Advocate.|$|R
50|$|Government <b>agencies</b> <b>are</b> {{often given}} names ending in directorate, inspectorate, {{administration}} (verk) or authority. Among the organisations organised as <b>agencies</b> <b>are</b> the universities and colleges. All government <b>agencies</b> <b>are</b> audited by the Office of the Auditor General of Norway. Municipalities and counties often divide their organization into etats, {{with only the}} central administration left in the core. Typically these <b>agencies</b> then <b>are</b> responsible for schools, healthcare, culture etc.|$|R
50|$|Currently the <b>agency</b> <b>is</b> {{headquartered}} in the White Cap Business Park in Williston. The <b>agency</b> <b>was</b> previously headquartered at the Waterbury State Office Complex in Waterbury.|$|R
5|$|The {{short-range}} {{committee was}} made up of members representing six computer manufacturers and three government agencies. The six computer manufacturers were Burroughs Corporation, IBM, Minneapolis-Honeywell (Honeywell Labs), RCA, Sperry Rand, and Sylvania Electric Products. The three government <b>agencies</b> <b>were</b> the US Air Force, the Navy's David Taylor Model Basin, and the National Bureau of Standards (now the National Institute of Standards and Technology). The committee was chaired by Joseph Wegstein of the US National Bureau of Standards. Work began by investigating data description, statements, existing applications and user experiences.|$|E
5|$|A CBC investigation, {{intended}} to test {{access to information}} following Bill 29, discovered that some departments and <b>agencies</b> <b>were</b> refusing to release previously available details about how much public employees take home above their base salaries. When the media was briefed on Bill 29 the-then Deputy Minister of Justice, Donald Burrage, said that {{the provisions of the}} act which enabled the public to see bonuses offered to public service employees had not been changed. Minister Hutchings confirmed that only the base salary, or a salary range, plus a range of possible bonuses, are now available. However, he said {{that this was not a}} change due to Bill 29 and that the information on salaries is only voluntary.|$|E
5|$|Beginning on September1, 1948, the then-active volcano Mount Hibok-Hibok on Camiguin Island in the Philippines {{began to}} release lava {{in a series}} of {{eruption}} events which continued for the ensuing three years. On December4, 1951, a large, Peléan eruption event later rated between a 2 and 3 on the Volcanic Explosivity Index, sending pyroclastic flows and lahars down the northeast flank of the volcano. The resultant ash flows alone killed an estimated 500people on the island, {{making it one of the}} deadliest volcanic eruption events in recorded history. As the typhoon approached the archipelago, relief <b>agencies</b> <b>were</b> forced to divert aid operations to victims of the recent eruption, slowing the recovery process.|$|E
5000|$|March 20, 1947, Intelligence <b>Agency</b> <b>was</b> established, {{under the}} Ministry of Defense - General Command Vietnam National Army. April May 1950, the Intelligence <b>Agency</b> <b>is</b> dissolved.|$|R
50|$|<b>Agencies</b> <b>are</b> {{representatives of}} the student candidates. The <b>agencies</b> <b>are</b> engaged {{in the search for}} {{vacancies}} with sponsors, will organize the vacancies and prepare the necessary documents for participation. <b>Agencies</b> <b>are</b> also engaged in health and safety issues and are available to help solve any problems which may arise for students during their stay in the USA.|$|R
50|$|The {{worldwide}} {{commission rate}} for advertising <b>agencies</b> <b>is</b> fixed at 15% {{of the total}} billing. This is {{the only source of}} income they earn from media. The 15% must cover costs such as payroll, fixed and variable costs. <b>Agencies</b> <b>are</b> demanding to increase the commission rate but clients are not even willing to give the 15% even though it's the only source of revenue for the <b>Agency.</b> There <b>are</b> cases that <b>agencies</b> <b>are</b> forced to lower their rates to the level of 5% to 10% due to competition. So in some cases there <b>are</b> <b>agencies</b> that <b>are</b> not even getting the fixed 15%.|$|R
5|$|Cook and Lemish {{speculate}} that the 610 Office was created outside the traditional state-based security system for several reasons: first, a number of officials within the military and security <b>agencies</b> <b>were</b> practicing Falun Gong, leading Jiang and other CPC leaders to fear that these organizations had already been quietly compromised; second, {{there was a need}} for a nimble and powerful organization to coordinate the anti-Falun Gong campaign; third, the creation of a top-level party organization sent a message down the ranks that the anti-Falun Gong campaign was a priority; and finally, CPC leaders did not want the anti-Falun Gong campaign to be hindered by legal or bureaucratic restrictions, and thus established the 610 Office extrajudicially.|$|E
5|$|On October29, in {{the wake}} of Omar, President George W. Bush signed a major {{disaster}} declaration for the United States Virgin Islands, allowing public aid to assist the islands. The Federal Emergency Management Agency or FEMA, had received 60 requests for public assistance throughout the area. Monetary value for the assistance was estimated at $3million and growing. Twenty-five departments and <b>agencies</b> <b>were</b> approved of for federal support, namely the U.S. V.I. Department of Public Works. Several non-profit organizations also received support from FEMA, while those that did not meet the criteria were referred to the Small Business Administration’s low-interest loan program.|$|E
5|$|Prior to the storm's first {{landfall}} {{in southern}} Florida, the Weather Bureau issued hurricane warnings beginning on August29 for areas of Florida's east coast from Palm Beach south to Key West, while storm warnings were issued from Key West to Boca Grande on the peninsula's western coast. Electrical power was purposely stopped in Miami as a precautionary measure {{prior to the}} storm's landfall. Two Red Cross officials were sent to Miami to monitor the area during the storm's passage. Other relief <b>agencies</b> <b>were</b> also preparing supplies {{in the event of}} an emergency. In Pahokee and Belle Glade, an estimated 2,000people evacuated to Okeechobee, fearing a repeat of the 1928 Okeechobee hurricane.|$|E
50|$|Government <b>agencies</b> <b>are</b> {{established}} {{to participate in}} the shaping of a policy and to implement such policy. Government <b>agencies</b> <b>are</b> public legal bodies financed from the state budget.|$|R
50|$|In 1878, the Fort Peck <b>Agency</b> <b>was</b> {{relocated}} to its present-day location in Poplar, because the original <b>agency</b> <b>was</b> {{located on a}} flood plain. It suffered floods each spring.|$|R
50|$|The Thiel <b>Agency</b> <b>was</b> {{involved}} in infiltrating and breaking {{a number of}} labor union strikes in the United States and Canada, much as the Pinkerton <b>agency</b> <b>was.</b> After the Homestead Strike, the Thiel Detective Agency, along with the Illinois Detective Agency, U.S. Detective Agency, and Mooney and Boland's Detective <b>Agency</b> <b>were</b> investigated by both chambers of the United States Congress.|$|R
5|$|Several relief <b>agencies</b> <b>were</b> already {{positioned}} {{in the region}} {{in response to a}} magnitude 6.9 earthquake in January of that year that killed over 20,000 people. Additional disaster relief teams were deployed to the region to further prepare residents for the cyclone. Food, water and other necessities were stored and ready to be provided to victims of the storm. Large swells produced by the storm affected {{a large portion of the}} western Indian coastline, especially in the city of Bombay. In the Valsad district, two coastal communities lost a combined 200 homes due to large swells produced by the storm. Offshore, between 1,500 and 2,000 fishing vessels had lost contact with the mainland. Later reports indicated that between 120 and 900 fishermen had gone missing as a result of the cyclone.|$|E
5|$|The {{national}} flag {{has been in}} use since June 7, 1995, one of two symbols adopted in the 1995 referendum. The main elements of the flag is a red and green bicolor, then decorated with an ornament pattern at the hoist position. The current flag is a modification of the 1951 flag used while the country was a republic of the Soviet Union. In the Soviet version, a hammer and sickle was placed near the top-hoist corner and the ornament colors were inverted. Several flags used by government officials and <b>agencies</b> <b>were</b> based on the {{national flag}}.|$|E
5|$|The police {{school was}} {{established}} in 1920 and the Governor of Svalbard was created in 1925. To increase the police force's flexibility, the municipal funding was cut and replaced with state funding in 1937. That year also saw the first two specialty <b>agencies</b> <b>were</b> created, the Police Surveillance Agency (later the Police Security Service) and the Mobile Police Service. After a border agreement was reached between Norway and the Soviet Union in 1949, the Norwegian Border Commission was established the following year. The Criminal Investigation Service {{was established in}} 1959, and the search and rescue system with two joint coordination centers and sub-centers for each police district was created in 1970.|$|E

5|$|The {{tour was}} a {{commercial}} success, grossing over $156 million, being seen by over 1.7 million ticket holders, and finishing as the third-highest grossing {{tour in the}} world for 2009 even though the tour faced some logistical issues. Ticket sales were botched by Ticketmaster, a situation further exacerbated by revelations of their holding seats back for their secondary market TicketsNow. Before long, legislatures and attorneys general of several states, as well as members of the U.S. Congress and federal regulatory <b>agencies,</b> <b>were</b> weighing in on the matter, with various lawsuits, settlements, and proposed laws as the result.|$|E
5|$|Thousands {{of people}} {{evacuated}} from northern {{areas of the}} Philippines as Ivan approached. Power was shut off prior to the storm {{to reduce the risk}} of electrocution. Four flights were cancelled in Taiwan, Hong Kong, and the Philippines due to the storm. Residents in Taiwan were advised to take precautions for Typhoon Ivan, though autumn typhoons are rare in the island. Vessels were urged to stay at port due to rough seas throughout the Philippines. Disaster <b>agencies</b> <b>were</b> put on high alert; relief supplies were then stockpiled, the navy was placed on standby, and military search and rescue vehicles were prepped.|$|E
5|$|Under US and UN pressure, Pakistan {{arrested a}} few members of Jamaat ud-Dawa and briefly put its founder under house arrest, but he was found to be free a few days later. A year after the attacks, Mumbai police {{continued}} to complain that Pakistani authorities were not co-operating by providing information for their investigation. Meanwhile, journalists in Pakistan said security <b>agencies</b> <b>were</b> preventing them from interviewing people from Kasab's village. Home Minister P. Chidambaram said the Pakistani authorities had not shared any information about American suspects Headley and Rana, but that the FBI had been more forthcoming.|$|E

40|$|Competent public <b>agencies</b> <b>are</b> {{associated}} with better economic outcomes. Beyond competence, political leaders need {{to secure the}} loyalty of their agencies. Unfortunately, several theories predict a tradeoff between these two valued features. This paper finds that recruitment into <b>agencies</b> <b>is</b> meritocratic where (1) agency officials have poor outside options, (2) careers in <b>agencies</b> <b>are</b> long-lasting, and (3) <b>agency</b> loyalty <b>is</b> important. Moreover, <b>agency</b> competence <b>is</b> lower when (4) loyalty is important but the time horizon is short, and (5) outside opportunities improve but the time horizon is long. This evidence fits best with a theory of loyalty as non-contractible behavior...|$|R
