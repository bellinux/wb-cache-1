5|$|Finn wanders {{all over}} Ooo until {{he manages to}} locate Jake, who is {{fulfilling}} a bizarre lifelong ambition of being a brick inside a shack as it collapses. Finn expresses his support, but decides {{to head back to}} the Tree Fort. He leaves a walkie talkie with Jake. After a period of time passes, Jake begins <b>absentmindedly</b> narrating the events around him.

5|$|The impasse {{is broken}} by the return of Miss Prism, whom Lady Bracknell {{recognises}} as the person who, twenty-eight years earlier, as a family nursemaid, had taken a baby boy {{for a walk in}} a perambulator (baby carriage) and never returned. Challenged, Miss Prism explains that she had <b>absentmindedly</b> put the manuscript of a novel she was writing in the perambulator, and the baby in a handbag, which she had left at Victoria Station. Jack produces the very same handbag, showing that he is the lost baby, the elder son of Lady Bracknell's late sister, and thus Algernon's elder brother. Having acquired such respectable relations, he is acceptable as a suitor for Gwendolen after all.|$|E

In this episode, Jake tries to fulfill a bizarre lifelong {{ambition}} of being a brick inside a shack as it collapses. Finn, being supportive, leaves a walkie talkie with Jake, who <b>absentmindedly</b> begins to narrate the events around him. Finn and BMO are drawn into Jake's storytelling, and Finn uses Starchy's radio station to broadcast Jake's narration of the trials and tribulations of a rabbit. All of Ooo is soon engrossed in the radio broadcast, unbeknownst to Jake.|$|E
5|$|On June 30, 1959, Musial was {{the batter}} {{in one of}} the oddest plays in {{baseball}} history. In a game between the Cardinals and Chicago Cubs, he was at the plate with a count of 3–1. Bob Anderson's next pitch was errant, evading catcher Sammy Taylor and rolling {{all the way to the}} backstop. Umpire Vic Delmore called ball four, even as Anderson and Taylor contended that Musial had foul tipped the ball. Because the ball was still in play and Delmore was embroiled in an argument with the catcher and pitcher, Musial kept running in attempt to make second base. Seeing that Musial was trying for second, Alvin Dark ran to the backstop to retrieve the ball. The ball wound up in the hands of field announcer Pat Pieper, but Dark ended up getting it back anyway. <b>Absentmindedly,</b> however, Delmore pulled out a new ball and gave it to Taylor. Anderson finally noticed that Musial was trying for second, took the new ball, and threw it to second baseman Tony Taylor. Anderson's throw flew over Taylor's head into the outfield. Dark, at the same time that Anderson threw the new ball, threw the original ball to shortstop Ernie Banks. Musial did not see Dark's throw and only noticed Anderson's ball fly over the second baseman's head, so he tried to go to third base. On his way there, he was tagged by Banks, and after a delay he was ruled out.|$|E
25|$|Dreams of {{absent-minded}} transgression (DAMT) are dreams {{wherein the}} dreamer <b>absentmindedly</b> performs {{an action that}} he or she has been trying to stop (one classic example is of a quitting smoker having dreams of lighting a cigarette). Subjects who have had DAMT have reported waking with intense feelings of guilt. One study found a positive association between having these dreams and successfully stopping the behavior.|$|E
25|$|On January 2, 1972, Gacy {{picked up}} 16-year-old Timothy Jack McCoy from Chicago's Greyhound bus terminal. Gacy took McCoy—who was {{traveling}} from Michigan to Omaha—on a sightseeing tour of Chicago, and then {{drove him to}} his home with the promise that he could spend the night and be driven back to the station {{in time to catch}} his bus. According to Gacy's later account of the murder, he awoke the following morning to find McCoy standing in his bedroom doorway with a kitchen knife in his hand. Gacy leapt from his bed and McCoy raised both arms in a gesture of surrender, tilting the knife upwards and accidentally cutting Gacy's forearm (Gacy had a scar on his arm to support this account). He then twisted the knife from McCoy's wrist, banged his head against his bedroom wall, kicked him against his wardrobe and walked towards him. McCoy then kicked him in the stomach and Gacy grabbed the youth, wrestled him to the floor, then stabbed him repeatedly in the chest as he straddled him with his body. Gacy claimed he then went to his kitchen and saw an opened carton of eggs and a slab of unsliced bacon on his kitchen table. McCoy had also set the table for two; he had walked into Gacy's room to wake him while <b>absentmindedly</b> carrying the kitchen knife in his hand. Gacy subsequently buried McCoy in his crawl space and later covered the youth's grave with a layer of concrete.|$|E
2500|$|Elsewhere Weill uses {{other such}} non-classical {{instruments}} as the accordion, and he uses other popular influences, {{including those of}} his native Germany. The most enduring feature of Gebrauchsmusik in Mahagonny, however, are the tunes. This reflects Weill's greatest desire to create simple music that would {{go straight to the}} heart of the audience. Many of the songs in Mahagonny are very simple and accessible. The [...] "Alabama Song", for example, can be picked up <b>absentmindedly</b> and hummed. And while it seems carefree, something seems wrong with it, despite or perhaps because of its simplicity.|$|E
2500|$|The series {{centers on}} Zim (voiced by Richard Steven Horvitz), {{a member of}} the imperialistic Irken race, an {{extraterrestrial}} species whose social hierarchy is based on height, rather than any type of skill. The Irken leaders, known as The Almighty Tallest (Wally Wingert and Kevin McDonald), rule the Irken Empire together because they are exactly the same height. As recounted during the series premiere, [...] "The Nightmare Begins," [...] Zim, who is both very short and very naive, was banished to the planet Foodcourtia for <b>absentmindedly</b> attacking his own planet and allies during Operation Impending Doom I.|$|E
2500|$|Returning to South Australia {{he worked}} in various jobs {{for several years and}} a certain level of {{frugality}} allowed him to save a year’s wages, which he had in his pocket when he visited a brothel in the city. [...] He left the brothel somewhat <b>absentmindedly</b> leaving his wallet and its contents behind. [...] When he returned for his wallet, the establishment’s pimp refused to let him back in and in his anger he threw a rock through one of the windows. The police were called, and a chase saw him captured and sentenced to time in Adelaide Gaol.|$|E
2500|$|More than 2000 people {{gathered}} {{to watch the}} burning prefectural office, but no one dared to extinguish the fire. They {{were looking at the}} burning office <b>absentmindedly,</b> thinking of the future of Japan, according to a newspaper. Another document recorded that people who had endured the government policy and Mabiki sokai (forced evacuation of houses), shouted, [...] "This is the Heaven's punishment against the evacuation of my house, I want to see the face of those who performed the bad policy {{in the name of the}} emperor." [...] The force of fire was strong and fearful; the prefectural office was on the other side of Matsue O-hashi bridge, but a housewife stated she had felt that the fire would come to the other side of the bridge.|$|E
2500|$|It was {{considered}} to film the Fire Bulge in Kursk, but the old battlefield was littered with unexploded ammunition. Therefore, a special set was constructed {{in the vicinity of}} Pereiaslav-Khmelnytskyi where art director Alexander Myaghkov was free to use live explosives. The combat scenes in the first two parts were shot there, in the summer of 1967. 3,000 troops, 100 tanks, 18 military aircraft and hundreds of artillery pieces were used to recreate the Battle of Kursk; 30 kilometers of trenches were dug to resemble the wartime fortifications. Ozerov supervised the set from a specially-built tower, using a handkerchief to signal the engineers when to detonate the charges. On one occasion, the director <b>absentmindedly</b> blew his nose, and [...] "one and half tons of TNT went off". The outdoor photography for Main Blow took place in Lithuania, near Pabradė, since the marshes in Belarus – the location of the 1944 battles depicted in the film – were being drained. The Italian parts were shot in Rome, while the Yalta Conference was filmed in the Livadia Palace.|$|E
2500|$|One sketch {{featured}} {{an employee}} (McCulloch) at a counter who loans a customer (McDonald) his ballpoint. After conducting his business, the customer <b>absentmindedly</b> pockets {{the pen and}} walks off. The employee sets off in a mad pursuit, all the while screaming [...] "MY PEN!" [...] The employee chases the customer outside, {{in time to see}} him climbing into a taxi. He has horrific fantasies of the customer sticking the pen into his ear, using it to stab a bystander, and reinserting the bloody pen into his own ear. The employee chases the taxi down the street and, leaping through the air, lands on the vehicle, holding onto the passenger side door with his finger tips. After a drive around town, the taxi pulls over, the customer issues a cursory apology before returning the pen, after which the employee curls up with it in the street, and some of his co-workers come out with a comfort blanket to collect him. The sketch ends with another customer asking for the pen, only for the audience to see that the employee now wears a large, weighty helmet with a chinstrap and a chain attached at the forehead, the other end of which secures the pen. [...] This short film, as well as many other The Kids in the Hall shorts, was directed by Michael Kennedy.|$|E

60|$|She {{made herself}} {{ready to go}} downstairs, <b>absentmindedly,</b> but her fingers were so well trained that they did the work of {{preparing}} her almost of their own accord. When she was actually on the way downstairs, the blood began to circle through her body {{of its own accord}} too, for her mind felt very dull.|$|E
60|$|Anne had to {{live through}} more than two weeks, as it happened. Almost a month having elapsed since the {{liniment}} cake episode, it was high {{time for her to}} get into fresh trouble of some sort, little mistakes, such as <b>absentmindedly</b> emptying a pan of skim milk into a basket of yarn balls in the pantry instead of into the pigs' bucket, and walking clean {{over the edge of the}} log bridge into the brook while wrapped in imaginative reverie, not really being worth counting.|$|E
60|$|As soon as {{his mind}} {{came back from}} his home leave, he {{detached}} himself from the rail and, walking forward, stood by the break of the poop, looking along the port side of the main deck. Lingard on his own side stopped in his walk and also gazed <b>absentmindedly</b> before him. In the waist of the brig, in the narrow spars that were lashed {{on each side of}} the hatchway, he could see a group of men squatting in a circle around a wooden tray piled up with rice, which stood on the just swept deck. The dark-faced, soft-eyed silent men, squatting on their hams, fed decorously with an earnestness that did not exclude reserve.|$|E
60|$|His words multiplied, his {{importance}} increased. In {{a little}} while he was restored to something of his old self. He was enormously excited. He seemed unable to sit down anywhere. He came into the breakfast-room so soon as Kipps was sure of him, shook hands with Mrs. Kipps parenthetically, sat down and immediately got up again. He went to the bassinette {{in the corner and}} looked <b>absentmindedly</b> at Kipps, junior, and said he was glad if only for the youngster's sake. He immediately resumed the thread of his discourse.... He drank a cup of coffee noisily and walked up and down the room talking, while they attempted breakfast amidst the gale of his excitement. The infant slept marvellously through it all.|$|E
6000|$|As {{the curtain}} rises, CHRIS and ANNA are discovered. ANNA is {{seated in the}} rocking-chair by the table, with a {{newspaper}} in her hands. She is not reading but staring straight in front of her. She looks unhappy, troubled, frowningly concentrated on her thoughts. CHRIS wanders about the room, casting quick, uneasy side glances at her face, then stopping to peer <b>absentmindedly</b> out of the window. His attitude betrays an overwhelming, gloomy anxiety which has him on tenter hooks. He pretends {{to be engaged in}} setting things ship-shape, but this occupation is confined to picking up some object, staring at it stupidly for a second, then aimlessly putting it down again. He clears his throat and starts to sing to himself in a low, doleful voice: [...] "My Yosephine, come aboard de ship. Long time Ay wait for you." ...|$|E

5000|$|The Guardian's John Fordham {{gave it a}} 4 {{star rating}} and {{observed}} [...] "Devoted fans need not panic: this album has the characteristic <b>absentmindedly</b> drifting, cannily misleading intros, the gathering clamour of melodies and countermelodies and the irresistible blend of song shapes, ambiance and impressionism. However, this is a faster, more jubilant and less trancelike Mehldau band. Not necessarily better - just noticeably different".|$|E

50|$|Rescue Shot, {{known as}} Rescue Shot Bubibo (レスキューショット ブービーぼー) in Japan, is a 3D light gun video {{game for the}} PlayStation console which was {{released}} in Japan and Europe in 2000.

Players watch over the game's hero, Bo, as he <b>absentmindedly</b> makes his way through each location, dealing with enemies and manoeuvering him past dangers.|$|E
