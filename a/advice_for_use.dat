40|$|Effective {{information}} technology use {{can be a}} key cause {{of the success of}} a construction project. Technology used for project management in the New Zealand construction industry is discussed in this paper. The results reveal on many levels a lack of understanding of current available {{information technology}} to assist with overall management and control of the construction projects in New Zealand. This paper discusses the results of a survey to construction companies in the New Zealand which profess to offer project management as one of their main services. Amongst others, the findings suggest an awareness of the technology available, but a reluctance to invest time and money in it. The paper will assess the reasons for this reservation and provide <b>advice</b> <b>for</b> <b>use</b> of alternative methods for project management planning and control for the New Zealand construction industry.

40|$|Evidence based {{medicine}} {{tells us}} {{that we should not}} accept published research at face value. Even research from established teams published in the highest impact journals can have methodological flaws, biases and limited generalisability. The critical appraisal of research studies can seem daunting, but tools are available to make the process easier for the non-specialist. Understanding the language and process of quality assessment is essential when considering or conducting research, and is also valuable for all clinicians who use published research to inform their clinical practice. We present a review written specifically for the practising geriatrician. This considers how quality is defined in relation to the methodological conduct and reporting of research. Having established why quality assessment is important, we present and critique tools which are available to standardise quality assessment. We consider five study designs: RCTs, nonrandomised studies, observational studies, systematic reviews and diagnostic test accuracy studies. Quality assessment for each of these study designs is illustrated with an example of published cognitive research. The practical applications of the tools are highlighted, with guidance on their strengths and limitations. We signpost educational resources and offer specific <b>advice</b> <b>for</b> <b>use</b> of these tools. We hope that all geriatricians become comfortable with critical appraisal of published research and that use of the tools described in this review – along with awareness of their strengths and limitations – become a part of teaching, journal clubs and practice...|$|E

Hyperinsulinemia, insulin resistance, androgen excess, ovulatory dysfunction, polycystic ovaries, gonadotropin abnormalities, obesity, adipose tissue dysfunction, difficulty to conceive and high-risk pregnancy {{are the most common}} PCOS-associated complications. The aim of this review was to describe and evaluate the effects of dietary interventions on PCOS-associated outcomes and to provide some evidence-based dietary <b>advice</b> <b>for</b> <b>use</b> in clinical practice. There is no optimal diet or macronutrient composition for PCOS. However, lifestyle modification, including a small-to-moderate weight loss of 5 – 10 % (combined diet with regular physical activity) with any dietary pattern of choice, depending on the individuals’ preferences, culture, habits and metabolic needs (ie, Mediterranean diet, Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension [DASH] diet or moderately low-carbohydrate diets [30 – 45 % of energy]), as well as alternative dietary interventions, including small, frequent meal (five to six meals daily) consumption at regular times, with the majority of carbohydrates consumed at lunch time or equally distributed throughout the day, seems to offer the evidence-based first-line strategy for the management of PCOS symptoms and insulin resistance. No conclusions can be drawn at this time for high protein diets, polyunsaturated fatty acids or micronutrient supplementation.

40|$|Context: About 490 {{million cases}} of curable Reproductive Tract Infections (RTI) occur {{throughout}} the world, of which 79 million cases occur in India annually. Sexually Transmitted Infections/Reproductive Tract Infections (STI/RTI) confers a huge economic {{burden on the}} individual and the health system. Complications of RTI/STI are many, ranging from chronic pain syndrome to infertility. Most of these complications can be prevented by early diagnosis and treatment. Aims: To assess knowledge, attitude and practices on STI/RTIs among married women aged 15 - 45 years in rural Haryana. Setting and Design: Cross-sectional study, conducted in selected villages under the primary health centre Mandi, Sonepat, Haryana. Subjects and Methods: Systematic sampling was used to cover 10 villages. In each village, every tenth house was sampled, taking first house {{from the center of the}} village. Face-to-face interview was conducted using pretested questionnaire. Statistical Analysis Used: Descriptive statistics and results were described in percentages. Results: A total of 344 women were interviewed. About 44 % women had never heard of STI/RTI. The prevalence of self-reported symptoms of STI/RTI was very high (60 %). Only 40 % of them opted for treatment and most common cause for not opting for treatment was that they considered it as a minor problem. <b>Advice</b> <b>for</b> <b>use</b> of condom during the treatment was received by only 20 % of patients and only 26. 5 % of their husbands also received treatment. Conclusions: Overall knowledge, attitude and practices relating to STI/RTI among married women in rural Haryana was poor.

40|$|Objective: To {{present a}} summary of the 2016 version of the European Association of Urology (EAU) – European Society for Radiotherapy & Oncology (ESTRO) – International Society of Geriatric Oncology (SIOG) Guidelines on the {{treatment}} of relapsing, metastatic, and castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). Evidence acquisition: The working panel performed a literature review of the new data (2013 – 2015). The guidelines were updated, and the levels of evidence and/or grades of recommendation were added based on a systematic review of the literature. Evidence synthesis: Relapse after local therapy is defined by a rising prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level > 0. 2 ng/ml following radical prostatectomy (RP) and > 2 ng/ml above the nadir after radiation therapy (RT). 11 C-choline positron emission tomography/computed tomography is of limited importance if PSA is 10 ng/ml. Multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging and biopsy are important to assess biochemical failure following RT. Therapy for PSA relapse after RP includes salvage RT at PSA levels < 0. 5 ng/ml and salvage RP, high-intensity focused ultrasound, cryosurgical ablation or salvage brachytherapy of the prostate in radiation failures. Androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) remains the basis for treatment of men with metastatic prostate cancer (PCa). However, docetaxel combined with ADT should be considered the standard of care for men with metastases at first presentation, provided they are fit enough to receive the drug. Follow-up of ADT should include analysis of PSA, testosterone levels, and screening for cardiovascular disease and metabolic syndrome. Level 1 evidence for the treatment of metastatic CRPC (mCRPC) includes, abiraterone acetate plus prednisone (AA/P), enzalutamide, radium 223 (Ra 223), docetaxel at 75 mg/m 2 every 3 wk and sipuleucel-T. Cabazitaxel, AA/P, enzalutamide, and radium are approved for second-line treatment of CRPC following docetaxel. Zoledronic acid and denosumab can be used in men with mCRPC and osseous metastases to prevent skeletal-related complications. Conclusions: The knowledge in the field of advanced and metastatic PCa and CRPC is changing rapidly. The 2016 EAU-ESTRO-SIOG Guidelines on PCa summarise the most recent findings and <b>advice</b> <b>for</b> <b>use</b> in clinical practice. These PCa guidelines are the first endorsed by the European Society for Therapeutic Radiology and Oncology and the International Society of Geriatric Oncology and reflect the multidisciplinary nature of PCa management. A full version is available from the EAU office or online ([URL] Patient summary: In men with a rise in their PSA levels after prior local treatment for prostate cancer only, it is important to balance overtreatment against further progression of the disease since survival and quality of life may never be affected in many of these patients. For patients diagnosed with metastatic castrate-resistant prostate cancer, several new drugs have become available which may provide a clear survival benefit but the optimal choice will have to be made on an individual basis...|$|E

40|$|So-called energy {{shots are}} {{a new kind of}} energy drinks that contain {{caffeine}} and taurine. In advertisements, these are claimed to increase concentration and capacity or physical performance. They are marketed in smaller portions (25 - 75 ml) than the more common energy drinks yet contain a higher concentration of caffeine and in some cases taurine per litre than energy drinks. The compositions of energy shots known to BfR vary significantly and contain between 50 - 200 mg caffeine and 200 - 1000 mg taurine per portion. In contrast to energy drinks, these energy shots are labelled with the manufacturer’s suggested intake levels. All of those known to BfR thus far uniformly recommend one portion per day. In BfR’s opinion, energy shots that contain the constituents listed above pose no health risk if consumed in accordance with the manufacturer’s intended use, i. e. one portion per day, and other product labels. Health risks can result if the suggested intake level is exceeded considerably. According to BfR, there is a risk that energy shots are not used in accordance with the manufacturer’s <b>advice</b> <b>for</b> intended <b>use.</b> The Institute assumes that energy shots are sometimes consumed in place of energy drinks and thus consumed – like these – at the discretion of the consumer without quantitative limit. According to BfR, the desire to improve performance produces a risk of excessive energy shot intake. As consumers can be expected to disregard the <b>advice</b> <b>for</b> intended <b>use,</b> thus taking in high doses of caffeine which could result in adverse effects, the Institute deems energy shots unsafe. BfR estimates that such expected consumer behaviour cannot be prevented by the manufacturer’s <b>advice</b> <b>for</b> intended <b>use...</b>|$|R

40|$|A set of {{research}} studies has been performed {{over a period}} of 10 years on the silvicultural cycle of an even-aged beech forest in Normandy, France. The striking results about both soil functioning (litter decomposition, N cycling, soil C stock) and soil biota (microorganisms, mesofauna, and macrofauna) are presented with the goal of developing an empirical model of the successional patterns of aboveground-belowground relationships in forests. Our purpose was to test the hypothesis stating that the best performance of this forest ecosystem, as high organic matter recycling and low biogenic element losses, is achieved in an ecological stage exhibiting limiting similarity in functional traits and maximizing traits complementary for both plant and soil communities. The present synthesis showed that this hypothesis seems to be confirmed for a late successional stage, i. e., a mature even-aged forest with a closed canopy. The most organized communities, on the basis of ecological requirement similarity, were found in 130 year-old stands. These stands also support the greatest values in microbial functional diversity, in soil C stock and in nitrogen mineralization. Nitrogen losses were the lowest in 95 year-old stands.
