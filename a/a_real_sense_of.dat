500|$|New York Times {{reviewer}} A.O. Scott {{thought the}} film was [...] "edited crisply enough {{to keep it from}} feeling like 90 minutes of C-SPAN and shaped to give Mr. Gore's argument <b>a</b> <b>real</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> drama," [...] and [...] "as unsettling as it can be," [...] Scott continued, [...] "it is also intellectually exhilarating, and, like any good piece of pedagogy, whets the appetite for further study." ...|$|E
500|$|Edward {{received}} {{criticism for}} his apparent pursuit of self-indulgent pleasure, but he received great praise for his affable and kind good manners, and his diplomatic tact. As his grandson Edward VIII wrote, [...] "his lighter side... obscured {{the fact that}} he had both insight and influence." [...] "He had a tremendous zest for pleasure but he also had <b>a</b> <b>real</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> duty", wrote J. B. Priestley. Lord Esher wrote that Edward was [...] "kind and debonair and not undignified – but too human".|$|E
500|$|In Italy {{there was}} {{widespread}} condemnation of Schumacher. The daily newspaper l'Unità called {{for him to}} be fired by Ferrari. [...] "Schumacher ought to face charges in a Spanish court for the grave deed he committed" [...] it reported. [...] "The driver covered himself, Ferrari and Italian sport as a whole with shame. We are waiting for Ferrari to announce that it is throwing out Michael Schumacher and hiring a new driver who is more intelligent, has more wisdom and <b>a</b> <b>real</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> morality." ...|$|E
5000|$|Richard Seymour (writer) {{writes that}} the film {{provides}} <b>a</b> very <b>real</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> just [...] "how much the workers and poor believe the revolution to be theirs... it is that very old-fashioned idea, of socialism from below, that gives the documentary its most hopeful and critical edge." ...|$|R
60|$|Mrs. Trefusis ceased crying, chilled by {{this first}} intimation that her father's house {{was no longer}} her home. <b>A</b> more <b>real</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> desolation came upon her.

5000|$|... "As Julie, Teal Wicks conveys so much {{character}} succinctly and clearly, {{but does}} so with <b>a</b> wonderfully <b>real</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> no-nonsense, New England restraint. As the plot unfolds, and Julie's relationship with Billy undergoes an increasingly dire set of challenges, Wicks allows {{the emotion of}} her character to radiate from within. [...] " ...|$|R
500|$|Regarding Madonna's {{influence}} on the record industry and younger artists, Debbie Gibson's then manager Doug Breitbart commented: [...] "Madonna has brought back a really strong, melodic component to pop music. She has a very youth-oriented, up, bubbly, fun sound." [...] Slant Magazine listed the album at number 60 on their list of [...] "The 100 Best Albums of the 1980s" [...] and stated that [...] "True Blue was the album on which it became readily apparent that Madonna {{was more than just}} a flash-in-the-pan pop star." [...] They added, [...] "It's when she began manipulating her image—and her audience—with <b>a</b> <b>real</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> clarity and purpose and made sure she had quality songs to back up her calculation and world-dominating ambition." ...|$|E
500|$|Based {{on their}} success with {{producers}} Brian Eno and Daniel Lanois on The Unforgettable Fire, U2 wanted the duo to produce their new album. Mullen {{was excited about}} working with them again, as he felt the pair, Lanois in particular, were the band's first producers who [...] "really [...] {{an interest in the}} rhythm section". Mark [...] "Flood" [...] Ellis was selected to be the recording engineer for the sessions, marking the first time he worked with U2. The band were impressed by his work with Nick Cave, and Bono's friend Gavin Friday recommended Flood based on their work experiences together when Friday {{was a member of the}} Virgin Prunes. The band asked Flood for a sound that was [...] "very open... ambient... with <b>a</b> <b>real</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> space of the environment you were in", which he thought was a very unusual request at that time.|$|E
500|$|Dan Martin of The Guardian singles out {{the scene}} where Gwen and Rhys become stowaways in Children of Earth as [...] "just lovely" [...] and [...] "a credit to both actors, {{particularly}} Kai Owen, who has finally made Rhys likable", whilst IGN writer Asham Haque also feels that Rhys' [...] "meatier role" [...] provides [...] "some great sequences" [...] for the couple. Rawson-Jones speaks favourably on Owen's role in the overall ensemble opining that he, along with Barrowman, Myles and David-Lloyd managed to guide the audience through the serial with [...] "panache and verve". The Chicago Tribune Maureen Ryan feels that the initiated Rhys {{is key to the}} show, and is a [...] "very enjoyable character", describing his appeal to government PA Lois Habiba to pay for his and Gwen's dinner as [...] "priceless". Speaking of the show's fourth series premiere, Simon Brew highlights the central returning trio of Barrowman, Myles and Owen as the show's most engaging actors, and further describes Owen's performance as mixing [...] "humour with an earnest, and <b>a</b> <b>real</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> drive".|$|E
50|$|Unable {{to secure}} music rights for a {{theatrical}} release, {{the movie was}} only shown on television. The movie was filmed between December 8, 1980 - December 13, 1980. On {{the night of the}} first day of filming, the crew learned that John Lennon had been assassinated. This news gave the movie <b>a</b> very <b>real</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> melancholy.|$|R
5000|$|The Student of Prague is {{considered}} to be the first German art film, and it helped lift cinema from its low-class, fairground origins to a viable art form. [...] It was a critical and commercial success. Audiences flocked to see the film, in part because it tapped into <b>a</b> very <b>real</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> dissociation and alienation inherent in a society that was struggling with the burgeoning collapse of the German empire.|$|R
5000|$|On 8 March 2009, Dan Cairns from The Times claimed that, [...] "What {{has changed}} is that the self-consciousness and anxiety that marred 2005's On the Outside has gone. On All the Plans, Starsailor sound like a band in love again with being a band," [...] and added that [...] "there is <b>a</b> <b>real</b> <b>sense</b> here <b>of</b> <b>a</b> band finally {{settling}} into their own skin, and rather liking the feeling." ...|$|R
500|$|Tracks on {{this album}} include [...] "E Pari Ra", [...] "One Fine Day", [...] "Let Me Lie", [...] "Danny Boy", and [...] "Abide with Me". Westenra co-wrote four of the fifteen tracks, and the album also {{features}} singer Humphrey Berney. The US/Australia/NZ edition followed in March under the name Celtic Treasure. Westenra dedicated the album to her grandmother, Shirley Ireland. Inside the sleeve of the British edition, she wrote: [...] "I come from a musical family, and one with <b>a</b> <b>real</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> history. My forefathers were on the maiden voyage from Ireland to Christchurch, New Zealand in 1850 – there's even a commemoration plaque in Cathedral Square, Christchurch, which bears the name Westenra. My grandmother used to sit me on her knee and sing songs like Danny Boy from as early as I can remember. A singer herself in her earlier years, {{she has always been}} a never-ending source of songs. It's this legacy of music that she's been passing down to me since my childhood, and it's many of these beautiful old songs that I've explored here on my album." ...|$|E
500|$|Reviews of {{the episode}} tended to be mixed. Noel Murray from The Onions The A.V. Club graded the episode with a D+, writing that [...] "Unlike the {{previous}} two weeks’ episodes, which juggled a number of storylines and locations and generated <b>a</b> <b>real</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> Fringe’s expanding milieu, 'Fracture' is so curtailed that it almost feels like it was made for the Fox accountants. The cast is small, the sets are few, and not much happens. The plot’s practically twist-free, until the very end. Large chunks {{of the episode}} are given over to Peter talking to Walter about finding a new {{place for them to}} live, and Walter trying to learn more about Astrid—and really not discovering much, except that she doesn’t like it when he experiments on fruit. So Astrid’s underused yet again, even in an episode where she gets a lot of lines... The story's too simple and the acting too broad, and yet the episode still felt choppy, as though the Fringe creative team had to scramble to fix 'Fracture' in post." ...|$|E
500|$|Destructoids Chris Carter commended Ashly Burch and Lance Reddick {{for their}} performances, with the {{character}} of Aloy receiving credit for maintaining a [...] "captivating" [...] and [...] "interesting" [...] consistency in the narrative and action sequences. Carter also lauded the focus on exploration and discovery, which he said grew more effective as he traversed more of the land. The game world itself was subject to compliment for its [...] "beautiful" [...] day-night cycle and weather system. According to Carter, the challenging nature of the machines and varied methods with which to battle them brought <b>a</b> <b>real</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> fun to the combat. Matt Buchholtz of Electronic Gaming Monthly likewise praised Burch {{as well as the}} game world, which he found to be mesmerising. Thought as the most powerful part of the game, the Focus feature gained approval for complementing the combat in a way that [...] "forces you to become a hunter". Writing for Game Informer, Jeff Marchiafava opined that, unlike with other open world video games, searching for audio logs and emails provided the plot with a [...] "remarkable sense of discovery". He was thankful that story-based missions dominated the overall experience, arguing that they worked to detail the game world and inspired variation in the gameplay.|$|E
2500|$|Four {{weeks of}} gruelling {{rehearsal}} resulted in Starfish, {{which focused on}} capturing the band's core sound. Bright, spacious and uncluttered, the recording was {{a departure from the}} layered orchestrations of Heyday. The group wanted as live and dynamic an album as possible, Willson-Piper said that trying to record a live atmosphere lacked <b>a</b> <b>real</b> gig's <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> [...] "being there". They found the results bare and simplistic; however, the public reception was unexpected.|$|R
5000|$|Critical {{reception}} for Cut was overwhelmingly positive, with Kirkus Reviews calling the book [...] "a thoughtful look at teenage {{mental illness and}} recovery". Booklist praised McCormick's depiction of Callie, saying {{that she was an}} [...] "exceptional character study". Publishers Weekly positively reviewed both the paperback and audio versions, writing that the book [...] "sympathetically and authentically renders the difficulties of giving voice to <b>a</b> very <b>real</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> harm and powerlessness" [...] as well as praising Clea Lewis for her narration.|$|R
2500|$|Claude Lanzmann, {{director}} of the documentary Shoah, gave the film high praise, stating that [...] "it's a very new film, very original, very unusual. It's a film that gives <b>a</b> very <b>real</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> {{what it was like}} to be in the Sonderkommando. It's not at all melodramatic. It's done with a very great modesty". Philosopher Georges Didi-Huberman also praised the film, and he wrote a 25-page open letter to Nemes, which opened with [...] "Your film, ‘Son of Saul,' is a monster. A necessary, coherent, beneficial, innocent monster".|$|R
500|$|The game's {{aesthetics}} {{were strongly}} praised. One reviewer appreciated {{the variety of}} styles in the music; it {{has been compared to}} Yanni, Enya, John Tesh, and sci-fi scores. Alan Dang contrarily found the music at times [...] "neutral" [...] and generic; Paul Ward found it pleasant but sparse. Numerous critics praised the voice acting and dialogue. The game's cinematic cutscenes were also acclaimed; Computer and Video Games noted they were [...] "superbly used for laughs or to create <b>a</b> <b>real</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> dramatic tension", while Next Generation wrote that Anachronox would be remembered as the germination point for blending interactive gaming and cinema. The Guardian, while also giving praise, found them somewhat predictable. Several reviewers praised the field map and level design of all but the last levels. Earlier ones were said to contain many [...] "little details that bring the game to life" [...] and significant immersion. The later levels were less well received, with one reviewer suspecting that ION Storm ran out of time to polish the game, as some end-game locations were [...] "hideously ugly, with huge slab-like polygons, dodgy backdrops and pixelated low resolution textures". The Guardian felt the lighting was too dark in general, while Kevin Cheung of The Sydney Morning Herald found the graphics blocky.|$|E
500|$|IGN Todd Gilchrist {{called it}} Bay's best film, and [...] "one {{of the few}} {{instances}} where it's OK to enjoy something for being smart and dumb at the same time, mostly because it's undeniably also {{a whole lot of}} fun". The Advertiser Sean Fewster found the visual effects so seamless that [...] "you may come to believe the studio somehow engineered artificial intelligence". The Denver Post Lisa Kennedy praised the depiction of the robots as having [...] "a believably rendered scale and intimacy", and ABC presenter Margaret Pomeranz was surprised [...] "that a complete newcomer to the Transformers phenomenon like myself became involved in the fate of these mega-machines". Ain't It Cool News's Drew McWeeny felt most of the cast grounded the story, and that [...] "it has <b>a</b> <b>real</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> wonder, one of the things that's missing from so much of the big CGI lightshows released these days". Author Peter David found it ludicrous fun, and said that [...] " [...] manages to hold on to his audience's suspension of disbelief long enough for us to segue into some truly spectacular battle scenes". Roger Ebert gave the film a positive review, giving it 3 stars out of a possible 4, writing: [...] "It's goofy fun with a lot of stuff that blows up real good, and it has the grace not only to realize how preposterous it is, but to make that into an asset." ...|$|E
500|$|Conversely, Allmusic {{contributor}} Gregory Heaney {{gave the}} album an overall score of {{three out of}} a possible five, noting that the lyrics [...] "feel more genuinely personal than his earlier work", and that [...] "there's <b>a</b> <b>real</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> urgent catharsis at work". He concludes, [...] " [...] combination of a tight, talented band and a tortured frontman doesn't necessarily make Falling in Reverse a revelatory band, but is does make The Drug in Me Is You a very solid album." [...] Molly Walter of The University Leader felt the album was an attempt to recreate Escape the Fate prior to Radke's departure and noted that [...] "he fell short big time", calling the album's music [...] "out of date and overdone". Walter did comment on Radke's singing but felt the lyrical content was conceited, concluding the review saying, [...] "Face it, Ronnie, you did not magically turn tragedy into melody. You’re just not king of the music scene." [...] The [...] Jam! gives 3.5/5 stars to The Drug in Me Is You and said, [...] "In a world of poseurs, Ronnie Radke is the real deal. The lewd, crude and tattooed punk has survived jail, rehab and being turfed from Escape the Fate. Now he’s on the loose and up to no good with a new band — and a CD of post-hardcore anthems that render his foul-mouthed tales of sex, drugs and rock ’n’ roll with a mix of metalcore power and pop-punk melody. Lock up everything." ...|$|E

50|$|In 1735, {{largely on}} account of his {{knowledge}} of military engineering, Karl Alexander, Duke of Württemberg (reigned 1733-1737) made him a privy councillor, but his hands were tied owing to the frivolous atmosphere of the court. On the death of the duke, however, he {{became a member of the}} Regency Council, and devoted himself with energy and success to the reorganization of the state. In the departments of education, state-religion, agriculture and commerce, his administration was uniformly successful, and he became in <b>a</b> <b>real</b> <b>sense</b> the head <b>of</b> the state. He died at Stuttgart.|$|R
5000|$|Director Ilkka Järvi-Laturi wanted Bill Pullman for {{the lead}} {{character}} of Harry. [...] "When we started casting, I knew right away that Bill was our man to play Harry ... He's an absolute natural for the part—intelligent, wry, and charmingly good looking." [...] Producer Kerry Rock saw Bill in more practical terms: [...] "Bill was {{the cornerstone of the}} casting process. We needed someone the right age, who was enough of a name, who could do the humor as well as being scary and believably violent at the tough spots of the story." [...] Co-star Bruno Kirby also found Bill to be the perfect match: [...] "The great thing about Bill is that he looks very straight, but if you look him in the eye, there's <b>a</b> <b>real</b> crazy <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> humor there." ...|$|R
500|$|Slant Magazines Joe Sweeney {{felt that}} [...] "Work" [...] was the album's {{standout}} track {{and believed that}} it portrayed <b>a</b> <b>real</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> Azalea's potential as a storyteller, and commended her delivery, [...] "You can hear every inch of how far she's come". Sweeney's view was shared by Andy Gill from The Independent who also named [...] "Work" [...] the highlight on The New Classic, and said Azalea's double-time delivery was best-employed on the song. HipHopDX's Marcus Dowling wrote that [...] "Work" [...] was [...] "an extraordinarily well-rounded listen" [...] and the [...] "honest and intriguing greatness" [...] of The New Classic. Dowling commented that the line, [...] "No money, no family, 16 {{in the middle of}} Miami", provided an [...] "ocean of depth [...] that makes the rest of the album feel like swimming in a kiddie pool". Matt Jost of RapReviews.com concurred, and called the song [...] "the sure winner" [...] and [...] "lyrically most ambitious offering" [...] of the album. Jost opined that the track was [...] "memorable" [...] and its production [...] "cleverly subverts expectations", and explained, [...] "It's when she keeps it simple and relies on her indeed present swagger that the Iggy Azalea character works best". Similarly, Alex Scordelis of Paper described the track as [...] "the cornerstone" [...] of the album and complimented its [...] "insanely catchy chorus". Scordelis believed it marked a heightened evolution in Azalea's growth as a rapper, and stated, [...] " [...] a song you can easily imagine Azalea performing for years to come".|$|E
500|$|Its {{writing and}} theme {{have been widely}} praised by critics. Michael S. Mammano of Den of Geek called the plot [...] "smartly-written" [...] and praised the animation. Jenifer Rosenberg of ComicMix liked the {{emphasis}} on family, friends, community, and education. According to Nick Hartel, the series touches on [...] "genocide and self-doubt" [...] themes without frightening younger children; rogue characters are redeemable, sending an important message that people can change and are not bonded to [...] "destiny". Chris Mitchell called the plot [...] "fantastic". D. F. Smith compared the series' plot to Japanese action cartoons, calling its tone and dialogue [...] "very American" [...] and praising the humor leavening an epic, dramatic theme suitable for all ages. Rob Keyes also praised the series' humor and affecting plot: [...] " [...] will capture your hearts". According to Mike Noyes, the series amalgamates elements of [...] "classic fantasy epics". Todd Douglass, Jr. called the plot engaging, well-thought-out and meaningful. The series' concept is [...] "well-realized", with a consistent story. Douglass wrote that the characters [...] " [...] <b>a</b> <b>real</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> progression", and praised the writers for their humor, drama, and emotion. Joshua Miller called the series surprisingly dark despite its [...] "silly" [...] theme; the plot is livelier than Lost and, similar to the latter, emphasizes character development. According to Miller, its writing was [...] "true adult levels of storytelling". Tim Janson described the series as more than fantasy- and superhero- themed, seeing the characters as central and relateable. [...] "Cricket" [...] Te praised the series' use of Buddhist philosophies and the diverse presentation of its themes of courage and life.|$|E
500|$|The album opens {{out with}} 'Howl', a grinding, but graceful opener. The song starts with an opening {{two minutes of}} intense and spacious drone synthesisers. The {{following}} two minutes of the song break into [...] "unrelenting and brutal" [...] mathcore with Eva Spence making her vocal debut with her [...] "gleefully guttural vocal register". The song is used {{as an example of}} how the band is using more complex, but 'more rewarding' song structures in their music. ‘Ex Luna Scientia’, the opening single for the album is seen as a more expansive and more melodic song in comparison to their previous work, placing emphasis on Eva Spence’s singing rather than her trademark 'guttural' style. Rock Sound reviewer Oliver Robertson used the song as an example for the sonic development of the album as it is [...] "more focused on making each element stand out now, rather than creating simply a cacophony of noise." [...] The introduction to 'Empiresk' is seen as being [...] "completely caked in reverb" [...] and ends with a stoner riff. The [...] "sparse piano chords" [...] that open both 'Empiresk' and 'Prelude II', among the atmospheric breaks that are featured on other tracks on the album defy the aggression featured on the rest of Astraea. Songs like 'The Scales of Balance', 'Remancer' and 'Gloam' are seen as having a fimiliar style to the Rolo Tomassi's previous work. 'Gloam', specifically the last half of the song, showcases a [...] "battle between melodic keyboard and screamed vocals with <b>a</b> <b>real</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> urgency and threat." [...] 'Remancer' specifically has been considered as almost like Mastodon. The album closes with 'Illuminare', a song which Metal Hammer reviewer Merlin Alderslade cites as showing Radiohead and Sigur Rós influences.|$|E
50|$|With {{the plague}} as {{a reality in}} their daily life, the populations of these Central Italian cities were no strangers to fear and to {{the horror of the}} Black Death. Depictions of the wrath of God and the {{sacrifice}} of Jesus in the processional gonfaloni heightened their urgency to find ways to appease God and their own guilt. The confraternity flagellations provided <b>a</b> <b>real</b> and dramatic <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> atonement. Thus, the plague aided in institutionalizing flagellation as part of personal devotion to God.|$|R
5000|$|The Right Attitude to Rain {{presents}} {{the culmination of}} a relationship that had been suggested since the first appearance of Isabel and Jamie in The Sunday Philosophy Club. McCall Smith admits that there has always been “tension” and “affection” between the two characters but was originally unsure of whether to develop their friendship into a sexual relationship: “I think that’s something one would have to handle very carefully because ... Isabel has <b>a</b> very <b>real</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> what can be and what can’t be. Some people have said to me, ‘Oh, why don’t you make that develop,’ but I’m not sure whether in real life it would develop.” [...] McCall Smith also found that the unfulfilled nature of the relationship was good for the novel, commenting that “Erotic tension is much sexier than fulfilment” and that reading about other people not getting what they want is interesting because “It's the story of all our lives.” ...|$|R

2500|$|Critic Peter Bradshaw of The Guardian {{stated that}} [...] "the savoury, serio-comic tang of the Coens' film-making style is recognisably present, as is their predilection for the weirdness of hotels and motels".

2500|$|... "The {{characters}} {{could be}} from an Almodovar movie {{as they seem}} to need to behave in extraordinary ways in order to draw some sexual, psychological advantage...

The discussion is presented within a framework of retail restructuring and spatial diffusion. ...|$|R
