Adam Harper of Dummy called it a [...] "pastiche [...] a kind of music you never knew you knew existed: techno-capitalist stock promotional music for the era of the personal computer ... Each track is bristling with the maximalist promise of a world of possibilities waiting behind the screen for your double-click, and evokes <b>a</b> <b>time</b> <b>when</b> <b>we</b> were much less familiar with and cynical about the virtual world technology has brought us into." ...|$|E
500|$|Writing in the South Australian Register, George William Francis, {{director}} of the Botanic Garden, said that the 32species of timber Ninnis had collected settled [...] "that important question, is there timber around [...] or not?" [...] Noting that the member of the expedition originally intended to return biological specimens to Adelaide had failed to do so, Francis wrote that [...] "we are very much indebted to this gentleman [...] who has thus supplied us at <b>a</b> <b>time</b> <b>when</b> <b>we</b> have failed in obtaining information through the appointed channel." [...] Upon {{the conclusion of the}} expedition in 1866, Ninnis received the thanks of the Parliament of South Australia for his work. His research on the expedition later formed the basis of a published work, Remarks on the Natural History, Meteorology, and Native Population of Northern Australia.|$|E
500|$|I {{definitely}} don't go {{the straight}} and narrow path, and you know, I definitely kinda like to experiment and collaborate. And so, I think it's taken me and Max this long to work together because of that, because what he does is genius and he is a classic hitmaker. But when I was coming out it was at <b>a</b> <b>time</b> <b>when</b> <b>we</b> had the huge pop explosion, and he was all over radio and I just wanted to work with others like Linda Perry and do that route and do [...] "Beautiful" [...] and songs like that. We built a level of respect for each other. So at this point, coming together, especially embracing my true pop-starness, at this point in my career having come full circle, I was able to really truly embrace it, and embrace him. He gave me the freedom to really sing on these songs, and have a little more creative freedom because I heard he is a stickler for melody and a melody king and I was scared, I was like 'Oh my God! I won't be able to collaborate here.' But he couldn't have been more great, and this is a really fun song, super up-tempo. It's probably the most dancey-ish song on my record, but it's called 'Let There Be Love' but it's free and representative of what this album is about.|$|E

500|$|Jocelyn Vena from MTV News {{gave the}} song a {{positive}} review, writing [...] " [...] {{has found a}} chart-topping formula, combin killer beats with lyrics about super-fun parties and hot pants." [...] Vena commented that, although the song was not groundbreaking and did not stray {{too far away from}} previous singles [...] "Tik Tok" [...] or [...] "Take It Off", that hardly matters as [...] "it's another uber-fun tune about how awesome it is to dance the night away" [...] with an [...] "inspired [...] the recent rash of suicides among gay youth." [...] Jason Lipshutz from Billboard gave the song a positive review; he praised Dr. Luke's production and the song's chorus. Lipshutz commented on the song's similarity to [...] "Tik Tok", writing, [...] "Instead of straying from the 'TiK ToK' formula, 'We R Who We R,' ... smartly maximizes [...] most appealing qualities." [...] The review concluded that the song [...] "demonstrates that [...] still has mileage left in her electro-pop sound as she gears up for her next album." [...] Leah Greenblatt of Entertainment Weekly called the song a [...] "companion piece" [...] to Pink's [...] "Raise Your Glass" [...] citing their similar subject matter and close releases. Nitsuh Abebe from NY Magazine complimented the song's chorus and trance pop elements. Abebe wrote that the song embodied a [...] "hollowed-out, free-of-yourself feeling", commenting that almost all electronic dance music imbues feelings [...] "that are almost spiritual, that sense of being subsumed and out-of-body". Melinda Newman of HitFix called the song [...] "incredibly stupid, but it has the main ingredients to make it a global hit: an insistent beat and positive lyrics that promise to suspend time and keep us 'forever young,' or better yet, transport us back to <b>a</b> <b>time</b> <b>when</b> <b>we</b> felt like we were." [...] Newman referred to herself as one of the singer's biggest detractors, but wrote [...] "I like one of her songs--or at least begrudgingly admire its crass charms." [...] In an album review of Cannibal, Newman referred to the song as a [...] "great self-acceptance anthem.' ...|$|E

Arguing that Wright and Trinity United Church of Christ had been misrepresented by [...] "the snippets of those sermons that have run in an endless loop on the television and YouTube", Obama spoke of Wright's service to the poor and needy, and of the role Wright played in Obama's own journey to Christianity.|$|E

Several of the firms invited to testify at the hearings sent lobbyists that had formerly worked for Senator Max Baucus, {{the chair of the}} committee.

2500|$|In November 1911, a {{group of}} Ohio Republicans {{endorsed}} Roosevelt for the party's nomination for president; the endorsers included James R. Garfield and Dan Hanna. This was notable, as the endorsement was made by leaders of President Taft's home state. Roosevelt conspicuously declined {{to make a statement}} requested by Garfield—that he flatly refuse a nomination. Soon thereafter, Roosevelt said, [...] "I am really sorry for Taft... I am sure he means well, but he means well feebly, and he does not know how! He is utterly unfit for leadership and this is <b>a</b> <b>time</b> <b>when</b> <b>we</b> need leadership." [...] In January 1912, Roosevelt declared [...] "if the people make a draft on me I shall not decline to serve". Later that year, Roosevelt spoke before the Constitutional Convention in Ohio, openly identifying as a progressive and endorsing progressive reforms—even endorsing popular review of state judicial decisions. In reaction to Roosevelt's proposals for popular overrule of court decisions, Taft said, [...] "Such extremists are not progressives—they are political emotionalists or neurotics".|$|E
2500|$|Fox News {{picked up}} the story and their {{commentator}} John Gibson categorized Ellison's comments as accusing [...] "Bush of planning and executing the 9/11 attacks". In Congress, Representatives Eric Cantor and Zach Wamp wrote House Speaker Nancy Pelosi demanding she [...] "swiftly and immediately" [...] reprimand Ellison for his remarks. The letter said, [...] "Even if Ellison asserts {{that he was not}} implying that 9/11 was orchestrated by the administration, the comparison he draws between Hitler and the President of United States is disgraceful. These comments inflame hatred and division at <b>a</b> <b>time</b> <b>when</b> <b>we</b> should be promoting our unity and reconciliation." [...] The Anti-Defamation League also stated [...] "Whatever his views may be on the administration's response to 9/11 and the conduct of the war on terrorism, likening it to Hitler's rise to power and Nazism is odious and demeans the victims of 9/11 and the brave American men and women engaged in the war on terror. Furthermore, it demonstrates a profound lack of understanding about the horrors that Hitler and his Nazi regime perpetrated." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{movie is}} based on Sully's {{autobiography}} , rights to which were optioned by producers Frank Marshall and Allyn Stewart in 2010. They developed the screenplay with Stewart's partner executive producer Kipp Nelson, hiring screenwriter Todd Komarnicki. From the start, Sullenberger wanted the film to encompass [...] "that sense of our common humanity", noting that the incident had taken place shortly after the 2008 Great Recession. He explains: [...] "People were wondering if everything was about self-interest and greed. They were doubting human nature. Then all these people acted together, selflessly, to get something really important done. In a way, I think it gave everyone {{a chance to have}} hope, at <b>a</b> <b>time</b> <b>when</b> <b>we</b> all needed it." [...] Komarnicki said the difficulty was not depicting the landing in the river, but the investigation afterwards: [...] "It wasn't really a challenge {{of what to do with}} the event since that is the thing everyone knows about, it was more about how you parse out the information about the man slowly falling apart and becoming a hero in the eyes of the world when internally and with the investigators it was actually seemingly going the other way." ...|$|E

The joy in writing the show was that everyone was behind it and wanted to do it. And I love her. So part of the joy and excitement and happiness would have gone out of me if she had not been on board 100 percent. I wasn't able to say this at the time, but in retrospect it was a blessing for it to end at <b>a</b> <b>time</b> <b>when</b> <b>we</b> all enjoyed doing it. That's not to say that if the network had ordered more shows that I wouldn't have given it my best. But there was a rightness in how short the season was. This was a show about adolescence and sort of ended in its own adolescence. There was an aura about how short the series was like all things that die young. The show ended at a point that it was still all potential." ...|$|E
