We point out the <b>anisotropic</b> <b>interaction</b> between the effective-spins on the nearest neighbor bonds is sufficient to reproduce the spin-wave dispersion of the fully polarized state {{in the presence of}} strong magnetic field normal to the triangular plane. We further evaluate the effective-spin correlation within the mean-field spherical approximation. We explicitly demonstrate that, the nearest-neighbor anisotropic effective-spin interaction, originating from the strong spin-orbit coupling, enhances the effective-spin correlation at the M points in the Brillouin zone. We identify these results as the strong evidence for the <b>anisotropic</b> <b>interaction</b> and the strong spin-orbit coupling in YbMgGaO$_ 4 $. Comment: 6 +epsilon pages, 3 figures.

40|$|First {{principles}} density functional theory (DFT) is used {{to investigate}} the electronic structure of β-MnO 2. From collinear spin polarized calculations we find that DFT+U_Eff predicts a gapless ferromagnet in contrast with experiment which indicates an insulating antiferromagnet. The inclusion of anisotropic Coulomb and exchange interactions in the DFT+U approach, defining U and J explicitly, corrects these errors and leads to an antiferromagnetic ground state with a fundamental gap of 0. 8 eV consistent with low temperature experiments. To our knowledge, this work on β-MnO 2 represents the first demonstration of {{a case in which}} the application of fully <b>anisotropic</b> <b>interactions</b> in DFT+U determines the magnetic order and consequent band gap, while the more commonly used effective U approach fails. Such effects are argued to be of importance in many insulating materials. The mechanism leading to an increase in band gap due to <b>anisotropic</b> <b>interactions</b> is highlighted by analytical calculation of DFT+U d-orbital eigenvalues obtained within a Kanamori-type model. Magnetic coupling constants obtained by the fitting of a Heisenberg spin Hamiltonian to the energies of a range of magnetic states assist in rationalizing the finding that <b>anisotropic</b> <b>interactions</b> enhance the stability of the experimentally observed helical antiferromagnetic order. The plane wave PAW method yields poorer results for the exchange couplings than full-potential LAPW calculations. Finally, we compare the DFT+U results with exchange couplings obtained from hybrid functionals. It is argued that <b>anisotropic</b> <b>interactions</b> should be included in DFT+U if the results are to be properly compared with those from hybrid functionals. Comment: 9 pages, 3 figure...|$|R
40|$|We {{develop a}} non-perturbative {{theoretical}} framework to treat collisions with generic <b>anisotropic</b> <b>interactions</b> in quasi-one-dimensional geometries. Our method avoids {{the limitations of}} pseudopotential theory allowing to include accurately long-range <b>anisotropic</b> <b>interactions.</b> Analyzing ultracold dipolar collisions in a harmonic waveguide we predict dipolar confinement-induced resonances (DCIRs) which are attributed to different angular momentum states. The analytically derived resonance condition reveals in detail the interplay of the confinement with the anisotropic nature of the dipole-dipole interactions.

The exact knowledge of the positions of DCIRs may {{pave the way for}} the experimental realization e. g.

40|$|Melting and {{freezing}} transitions in two dimensional (2 D) systems {{are known to}} show highly unusual characteristics. Most of the earlier studies considered atomic systems: the melting of 2 D molecular solids is still largely unexplored. In {{order to understand the}} role of anisotropy as well as multiple energy and length scales present in molecular systems, here we report computer simulation studies of melting of 2 D molecular systems. We computed a limited portion of the solid-liquid phase diagram. We find that the interplay between the strength of isotropic and anisotropic interactions can give rise to rich phase diagram consisting of isotropic liquid and two crystalline phases-honeycomb and oblique. The nature of the transition depends on the relative strength of the <b>anisotropic</b> <b>interaction</b> and a strongly first order melting turns into a weakly first order transition on increasing the strength of the isotropic interaction. This crossover can be attributed to an increase in stiffness of the solid phase free energy minimum on increasing the strength of the <b>anisotropic</b> <b>interaction.</b> The defects involved in melting of molecular systems are quite different from those known for the atomic systems...|$|E

40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the impact of}} spin <b>anisotropic</b> <b>interactions,</b> promoted by spin-orbit coupling, on the magnetic phase diagram of the iron-based superconductors. Three distinct magnetic phases with Bragg peaks at (π, 0) and (0,π) are possible in these systems: one C_ 2 (i. e. orthorhombic) symmetric stripe magnetic phase and two C_ 4 (i. e. tetragonal) symmetric magnetic phases. While the spin <b>anisotropic</b> <b>interactions</b> allow the magnetic moments to point in any direction in the C_ 2 phase, they restrict the possible moment orientations in the C_ 4 phases. As a result, an interesting scenario arises in which the spin <b>anisotropic</b> <b>interactions</b> favor a C_ 2 phase, but the other spin isotropic interactions favor a C_ 4 phase. We study this frustration via both mean-field and renormalization-group approaches. We find that, to lift this frustration, a rich magnetic landscape emerges well below the magnetic transition temperature, with novel C_ 2, C_ 4, and mixed C_ 2 -C_ 4 phases. Near the putative magnetic quantum critical point, spin anisotropies promote a stable Gaussian fixed point in the renormalization-group flow, which is absent in the spin isotropic case, and {{is associated with a}} near-degeneracy between C_ 2 and C_ 4 phases. We argue that this frustration is the reason why most C_ 4 phases in the iron pnictides only appear inside the C_ 2 phase, and discuss additional manifestations of this frustration in the phase diagrams of these materials.

40|$|This thesis {{describes}} {{an investigation of}} interactions between colloidal particles immersed in a liquid crystal. The presence of colloidal particles in the liquid crystal distorts the director field distorted from its uniform orientation. These elastic distortions produce topological defects around the particles, which induce <b>anisotropic</b> <b>interactions</b> between them, and these <b>anisotropic</b> <b>interactions</b> {{can be used to}} manufacture non-closed packed colloidal crystals, such as diamond lattices, which are interesting in photonic applications. First, different types of liquid crystals, the mathematical tools to describe the anisotropic nature of liquid crystals, the Landau-de Gennes free-energy model to investigate the particle’s interaction, and different kinds of topological defects are described. Moreover, previous work regarding the interaction of particles with the same applied boundary conditions in both nematic and cholesteric liquid crystal are discussed. Second, the lattice Boltzmann method is introduced in order to couple the molecular dynamics particles to the computational fluid mesh, and the simulation is performed in the open source molecular dynamics package, LAMMPS. Next, we explore <b>anisotropic</b> <b>interactions</b> with minima at specific orientations of particles with heterogeneous boundary conditions inside both nematic and cholesteric liquid crystals, which have not been observed so far.
