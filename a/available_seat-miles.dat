40|$|Using data envelopment {{analysis}} and the Malmquist productivity index, this paper examines changes in the productivity of the major United States passenger airlines from 2000 to 2004. The analysis finds {{that there was a}} significant improvement in the productivity of the carriers at transforming labor, fuel and passenger seating capacity into <b>available</b> <b>seat-miles</b> during this period. Most of the productivity improvements came about from the efficiency laggards catching up with the efficiency leaders in the industry. To a lesser extent, the adoption of new technologies improved productivity over this period. ...|$|E
40|$|The ongoing {{discussion}} about the future implementation of high-speed rail (HSR) in the Northeast Corridor (NEC) is full of questions on the feasibility of HSR {{and the ability of}} Amtrak to implement it. Indeed, the introduction of the Acela Express in the past decade was not free from operating problems, but even with trains running below their full potential, the Amtrak NEC had substantial market growth. Thus, it is not clear if a true HSR service is feasible in the NEC, and if the current prospects are potentially effective. To evaluate the performance of the NEC and its main services in FY 2002 - 2012, and make inferences about HSR in the NEC for the next 30 years, we use productivity analysis. We employ a non-parametric single factor productivity (SFP) Trnqvist trans-log index approach with several metrics. We set ridership, revenue, revenue passenger-miles (RPM), and <b>available</b> <b>seat-miles</b> (ASM) as outputs, and operating costs as input. In this way, we provided guidelines and...|$|E
40|$|Data envelopment {{analysis}} {{is used to}} evaluate the technical efficiencies of a number of major passenger airlines in the United States at transforming their inputs (labor, fuel and fleet-wide seating capacity) into <b>available</b> <b>seat-miles.</b> A tobit regression model is then used to identify the underlying drivers of airline efficiency, as measured by the data envelopment analysis efficiency score. The impact of unionization on airline efficiency is found to be statistically insignificant, controlling for the influences of other hypothesized determinants of airline efficiency: the average age of an airline's fleet, the average size of its aircraft, its average stage length, {{the extent to which the}} airline relies of hubbing within its route structure, the percent of its passenger enplanements that are international, and whether the airline is a legacy carrier. The statistically significant drivers of airline efficiency, at a ten percent level of significance, are average aircraft size, average stage length and the extent to which the airline relies on hubbing and connecting flights within its route structure. The stage length variable is not significant at a five percent level of significance, however. An increase in average aircraft size or in average stage length enhances an airline's efficiency whereas an increase in hubbing reduces it.

40|$|Golf courses {{have two}} {{strategic}} levers, round duration control and demand-based pricing {{that they can}} deploy in a revenue management programme. Before embarking on a revenue management programme, golf courses must first clearly define their capacity. This study uses simulation to study the most controllable factor of capacity: the tee time interval. Intuitively, reducing the interval between parties will {{lead to an increase}} in revenue; however, this paper shows that interval reductions may actually lead to decreased revenue. Research in revenue management (RM) has previously addressed the theoretical and practical problems facing airlines and hotels, among other industries, but has given little attention to the golf course industry (Kimes, 1989; Weatherford and Bodily, 1992). The golf course business is similar enough to hotel and airline operations that golf courses should be able to apply RM principles (Kimes, 2000). Industries using RM generally measure their performance by calculating their revenue (or contribution) per available time-based inventory unit. For example, hotels calculate their revenue per available room-night (RevPAR), airlines determine their revenue per <b>available</b> <b>seat-mile</b> (RevPAS), and restaurants rely on revenue per available seat-hour (RevPASH). Based on this logic, golf courses should measure their revenue per available tee-time (RevPATT), but the definition of availability is not as precise as in other industries. The number of available tee times is affected by both controllable and uncontrollable factors. Controllable factors include the length of a round of golf, the dispatching rule used, maintenance and the tee time interval. Uncontrollable factors include the number of hours of daylight and weather. Unless golf course operators have a clear definition of their capacity, {{they will not be able}} to measure the performance of their RM systems. This paper focuses on the most easily controllable factor affecting course capacity: the tee time interval. A dynamic simulation model was developed, which can be used to quantify the trade-offs in determining an appropriate tee time interval. Intuitively, reducing the time interval between parties might lead to an increase in throughput and revenue; however, tee time interval reductions may amplify the effects of the variations in pace of play and result in a reduced RevPATT...|$|R
5000|$|The first {{commercial}} {{orders for the}} 707 came on October 13, 1955, when Pan Am committed to 20 707s and 25 Douglas DC-8s, dramatically increasing their passenger capacity (in <b>available</b> revenue passenger <b>seat-miles</b> per hour/per day) over its existing fleet of propeller aircraft. The competition between the 707 and Douglas DC-8 was fierce. Pan American ordered these planes; when and as they did, {{so that they would}} be the operators of the, [...] "first-off" [...] production line for each aircraft type. And until their initial batch of the aircraft had been delivered to them; and, put into operation; Pan American would have the distinction of being not only the [...] "Launch Customer" [...] for both transcontinental American jets; but the exclusive operator of American intercontinental jet transports for at least a year.|$|R
40|$|An {{aircraft}} {{systems analysis}} was conducted to evaluate the net benefits of advanced technologies on two conceptual civil transport rotorcraft, to quantify the potential of future civil rotorcraft to become operationally viable and economically competitive, with {{the ultimate goal of}} alleviating congestion in our airways, runways and terminals. These questions are three of many that must be resolved for the successful introduction of civil transport rotorcraft: 1) Can civil transport rotorcraft actually relieve current airport congestion and improve overall air traffic and passenger throughput at busy hub airports? What is that operational scenario? 2) Can advanced technology make future civil rotorcraft economically competitive in scheduled passenger transport? What are those enabling technologies? 3) What level of investment is necessary to mature the key enabling technologies? This study addresses the first two questions, and several others, by applying a systems analysis approach to a broad spectrum of potential advanced technologies at a conceptual level of design. The method was to identify those advanced technologies that showed the most promise and to quantify their benefits to the design, development, production, and operation of future civil rotorcraft. Adjustments are made to sizing data by subject matter experts to reflect the introduction of new technologies that offer improved performance, reduced weight, reduced maintenance, or reduced cost. This study used projected benefits from new, advanced technologies, generally based on research results, analysis, or small-scale test data. The technologies are identified, categorized and quantified in the report. The net benefit of selected advanced technologies is quantified for two civil transport rotorcraft concepts, a Single Main Rotor Compound (SMRC) helicopter designed for 250 ktas cruise airspeed and a Civil Tilt Rotor (CTR) designed for 350 ktas cruise airspeed. A baseline design of each concept was sized for a representative civil passenger transport mission, using current technology. Individual advanced technologies are quantified and applied to resize the aircraft, thereby quantifying the net benefit of that technology to the rotorcraft. Estimates of development cost, production cost and operating and support costs are made with a commercial cost estimating program, calibrated to Boeing products with adjustments for future civil production processes. A cost metric of cash direct operating cost per <b>available</b> <b>seat-mile</b> (DOC ASM) is used to compare the cost benefit of the technologies. The same metric is used to compare results with turboprop operating costs. Reduced engine SFC was the most advantageous advanced technology for both rotorcraft concepts. Structural weight reduction was the second most beneficial technology, followed by advanced drive systems and then by technology for rotorcraft performance. Most of the technologies evaluated in this report should apply similarly to conventional helicopters. The implicit assumption is that resources will become available to mature the technologies for fullscale production aircraft. That assumption is certainly the weak link in any forecast of future possibilities. The analysis serves the purpose of identifying which technologies offer the most potential benefit, and thus the ones that should receive the highest priority for continued development. This study directly addressed the following NASA Subsonic Rotary Wing (SRW) subtopics: SR W. 4. 8. I. J Establish capability for rotorcraft system analysis and SRW. 4. 8.

40|$|After {{decades of}} growth in {{domestic}} flights, seats, and <b>available</b> <b>seat-miles,</b> airlines reduced capacity at airports across the United States from 2007 - 2012 {{in response to a}} global economic downturn and high and volatile fuel prices. Despite an economic recovery and more stable fuel prices, airlines continued to keep domestic capacity low relative to historical levels. This strategy, which has been referred to as "capacity discipline," has had widespread implications for the entire U. S. air transportation network. This thesis examines the effects of capacity discipline on service availability, network connectivity, and fares in the U. S. air transportation network, particularly at smaller airports. We find that airlines cut flights at large airports by 8. 8 % from 2007 - 2012, as compared to a 21. 7 % reduction in flights at smaller airports over the same time period. As a result, some smaller airports may be particularly vulnerable to losing all network carrier service. Capacity discipline also changed the mix of carriers that served smaller airports. In many cases, network carriers providing service from smaller airports to connecting hubs were replaced by ultralow- cost carriers providing less-frequent service. We create an airport connectivity index to explore these effects of capacity discipline on airports' connections to the global air transportation network. The index model suggests that smaller airports lost more connectivity than larger airports in multi-airport regions. Finally, we examine changes in airfares as a result of capacity discipline. We find that medium-sized airports saw the largest increases in airfares- 11. 9 % on average-from 2007 - 2012. Additionally, while the presence of low-cost carriers is still associated with in a decrease in the average one-way fare at an airport, the effects of some LCCs such as Southwest Airlines have diminished over time. Capacity discipline may be an unstable equilibrium when viewed in the game-theoretic context of the "prisoner's dilemma. " With lower levels of connectivity and increasing fares, smaller airports in multi-airport regions will need to employ creative strategies to prevent passengers from leaking to primary hubs. Whether these airports can recover from service consolidation will also depend on how long this capacity discipline equilibrium remains in effect among U. S. airlines. by Michael D. Wittman.

In this way, we provided guidelines and a robust structure of analysis that can be useful for subsequent passenger rail productivity studies. We find that the NEC experienced highly volatile, but considerable productivity growth in FY 2002 - 2012 (in the range of ~ 1 - 3 % per year). Amtrak increased its ability to fill up and economically exploit the available capacity, but did not perform equally well on the supply side. Service changes, technical problems with train sets, targeted capital investments, and economic recession and recovery were the main drivers of productivity change. The Acela Express and Northeast Regional were very sensitive to external events, had large economies of scale, and implemented slow adjustment of capacity via rolling stock and infrastructure improvements, which varied depending on the service. The characteristics of the NEC reveal a potential for a successful introduction of HSR, but although Amtrak's Vision for HSR in the NEC is realistic (in terms of productivity), it is risky and perhaps the time scale is not ambitious enough. We recommend revising the current projections, incorporate additional planning approaches, accelerate key stages of the Vision and include the FAA in the planning process. by Andrés Felipe Archila Téllez.
