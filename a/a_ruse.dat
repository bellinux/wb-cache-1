5|$|At the time, many Japanese politicians, {{including}} Admiral Isoroku Yamamoto (who was {{an outspoken}} critic of an alliance with Nazi Germany), were shocked by the Anglo-German Naval Agreement. Nevertheless, the leaders of the military clique then in control in Tokyo concluded that it was <b>a</b> <b>ruse</b> designed to buy the Nazis time to match the British navy.|$|E
5|$|Deliberate self-harm is {{especially}} prevalent in prison populations. A proposed {{explanation for this}} is that prisons are often violent places, and prisoners who wish to avoid physical confrontations may resort to self-harm as <b>a</b> <b>ruse,</b> either to convince other prisoners that they are dangerously insane and resilient to pain or to obtain protection from the prison authorities. Self-harm also occurs frequently in inmates who are placed in solitary confinement.|$|E
5|$|The natives' {{relationship}} with the sailors is initially cordial, so Too-Wit and the captain begin trading. Their friendliness, however, {{turns out to be}} <b>a</b> <b>ruse</b> and {{on the eve of the}} ship's proposed departure, the natives ambush the crew in a narrow gorge. Everyone except Pym and Peters is slaughtered, and the Jane Guy is overrun and burned by the malevolent tribe.|$|E

5|$|There is no {{encryption}} algorithm {{present in the}} Agrippa binary; consequently, the visual encryption effect that displays when the poem has finished is <b>a</b> <b>ruse.</b> The visual effect {{is the result of}} running the decrypted ciphertext (in memory) through the re-purposed bit-scrambling decryption algorithm, and then abandoning the text in memory. Only the fake genetic code is written back to disk.|$|E
5|$|While he {{is leaving}} court, Uncle Junior is {{hit in the}} head with a boom mic and falls down several steps.

Later, Eugene Pontecorvo intimidates a juror, resulting in a deadlocked jury, forcing the judge to declare a mistrial.|$|E
5|$|Beauchamp was {{admitted}} to the bar in April 1823. He and Anna Cooke married in June 1824. Still determined to defend the honor of his wife, Beauchamp devised <b>a</b> <b>ruse</b> to lure Sharp to Bowling Green. He wrote letters to Sharp under various pseudonyms, each asking for his help in some sort of legal matter, and each sent from a different post office. When Sharp failed to respond, Beauchamp decided to go to Frankfort again and confront him.|$|E

5|$|De Grasse had {{notified}} {{his counterpart}} in Newport, the Comte de Barras Saint-Laurent, of his intentions and his planned arrival date. Barras sailed from Newport on 27 August with 8 ships of the line, 4 frigates, and 18 transports carrying French armaments and siege equipment. He deliberately sailed via a circuitous route {{in order to}} minimize the possibility of an encounter with the British, should they sail from New York in pursuit. Washington and Rochambeau, in the meantime, had crossed the Hudson on 24 August, leaving some troops behind as <b>a</b> <b>ruse</b> to delay any potential move on the part of General Clinton to mobilize assistance for Cornwallis.|$|E
5|$|Declared {{the winner}} by Sakamochi, Shogo is escorted to his {{transport}} off the island, surrounded by soldiers. Sakamochi, however, reveals {{that he knows}} Nanahara and Nakagawa are alive and that his supposed execution of Noriko and Shuya was <b>a</b> <b>ruse</b> after he {{found a way to}} disable their collars, and attempts to kill Shogo. Shogo kills him as a hidden Nanahara and Nakagawa hijack the ship and kill the soldiers on board. As the boat sails towards the mainland, Shogo succumbs to his wounds sustained during the hijacking, and dies, but not before thanking Shuya and Noriko for being his friends.|$|E
5|$|In June 1963, Kenyatta {{met with}} the Tanganyikan President Julius Nyerere and Ugandan President Milton Obote in Nairobi. The trio {{discussed}} the possibility of merging their three nations into a single East African Federation, agreeing {{that this would be}} accomplished {{by the end of the}} year. Privately, Kenyatta was more reluctant regarding the arrangement and as 1964 came around the federation had not come to pass. In May 1964, Kenyatta rejected a back-benchers resolution calling for speedier federation. He publicly stated that talk of a federation had always been <b>a</b> <b>ruse</b> to hasten the pace of Kenyan independence from Britain, but Nyerere denied that this was true.|$|E

5|$|In the 1083 {{campaign}} in Thessaly against the Normans, who, under Guiscard's son Bohemond were besieging Larissa, Melissenos {{was used by}} Alexios as the centerpiece to <b>a</b> <b>ruse.</b> The emperor gave him the imperial insignia and a detachment of the army, which Bohemond proceeded to attack {{in the belief that}} this was the main Byzantine force, since the emperor was present with it. While the Normans pursued Melissenos's men, Alexios with the main army took and looted the Norman camp, forcing Bohemond to lift the siege and withdraw.|$|E
5|$|Norton was {{the subject}} of many tales; one popular story {{suggested}} {{he was the son of}} Emperor Napoleon III, and that his claim of coming from South Africa was <b>a</b> <b>ruse</b> to prevent persecution. Another popular story suggested Norton was planning to marry Queen Victoria. While this claim is unsupported, Norton did write to the Queen on several occasions, and he is reported to have met Emperor Pedro II of Brazil. Rumors also circulated that Norton was supremely wealthy—only affecting poverty because he was miserly.|$|E

Guillaume is accepted at the court of Emperor Conrad who has {{fallen in love with}} Liénor despite his earlier aversion to love and marriage.

5000|$|German {{commando}} Otto Skorzeny led {{his troops}} wearing American uniforms to infiltrate American lines in Operation Greif during the Battle of the Bulge. Skorzeny later {{reported that he}} was told by experts in military law that wearing American uniforms was <b>a</b> defensible <b>ruse</b> de guerre, provided his troops took off their American uniforms, and put on German uniforms, prior to firing their weapons. Skorzeny was acquitted by a United States military court in Dachau in 1947, after his defense counsel argued that the [...] "wearing of American uniforms was <b>a</b> legitimate <b>ruse</b> of war for espionage and sabotage" [...] as described by The New York Times.|$|R
50|$|The {{battle of}} Kafer Qal'eh {{resulted}} in a tactical victory for Nader after which Allahyar Khan was pursued and re-engaged. At {{the height of the}} battle Nader's scouts brought word of Zulfaqar Khans approach prompting Nader to carry out <b>an</b> ingenious <b>ruse.</b> <b>A</b> column of Persian troops was sent on a march round Allahyar Khan's army with their victory drums & horns sounding loudly which led him to believe that Zulfaqar Khan's men had already been defeated forcing him to beat another hasty retreat.|$|R

5|$|As {{they reach}} the lobby, Denham and Shaw return, {{revealing}} the Thanksgiving court date as <b>a</b> <b>ruse.</b> Denham notes the missing car and Shaw's safe and, for violating his bail by not declaring the latter, has him remanded back into federal custody until his real court date. Denham and the FBI arrest Josh and the crew (except Slide) as they walk outside the Tower. Miss Iovenko arrives, telling the FBI that she passed her bar exam three days ago and is acting as Josh's attorney. She shows them Shaw's ledger and tells them she will turn it over in exchange for everyone's freedom. The FBI accepts {{on the condition that}} Josh, being the primary conspirator, must serve a minimal two-year sentence, but Denham lowers it to 16 months to make sure Josh gets out for good behavior. Shaw is convicted and sentenced to prison {{for the rest of his}} life.|$|E
5000|$|In the third-season {{finale of}} The Mentalist, the {{characters}} use a canary trap (giving different hotel room numbers to different suspects) to uncover a mole within their agency. <b>A</b> similar <b>ruse</b> {{is used in the}} TV series Ashes to Ashes.|$|R

5000|$|Journalist Michael C. Moynihan wrote:When Wechsler {{testified before}} McCarthy’s Senate committee, the senator’s deep {{paranoia}} was on prominent display. He suggested that Wechsler’s well-documented hostility to Stalin was <b>an</b> elaborate <b>ruse.</b> <b>As</b> his quarry {{shifted in his}} chair, McCarthy speculated that Post editorials critical of his committee were planted by the Manchurian editor: 'Perhaps {{the most effective way}} of for communism would be to claim that we deserted the party and, if we got in control of the paper, use that paper to attack and smear anybody who actually was fighting Communism.' ...|$|R
5|$|At the palace, Nero tells Agrippina of his {{troubles}} {{and decides to}} renounce love for political ambition ("Come nube che fugge dal vento"). But Pallas and Narcissus have by now revealed Agrippina's original plot to Claudius, so that when Agrippina urges the Emperor to yield the throne to Nero, he accuses her of treachery. She then claims that her efforts to secure the throne for Nero had all along been <b>a</b> <b>ruse</b> to safeguard the throne for Claudius ("Se vuoi pace"). Claudius believes her; nevertheless, when Poppaea, Otho, and Nero arrive, Claudius announces that Nero and Poppaea will marry, and that Otho shall have the throne. No one is satisfied with this arrangement, as their desires have all changed, so Claudius {{in a spirit of}} reconciliation reverses his judgement, giving Poppaea to Otho and the throne to Nero. He then summons the goddess Juno, who descends to pronounce a general blessing ("V'accendano le tede i raggi delle stelle").|$|E
5|$|At {{the same}} time, Jack Donaghy (Alec Baldwin) is {{informed}} by Don Geiss's (Rip Torn) estate lawyer Thomas (Burke Moses) {{that he is in}} Don Geiss's will. Jack is excited at the idea of owning a piece of Geiss's legacy as Jack considered Geiss his mentor. At the will reading, Jack inherits Geiss's beloved pet peacock named Argus. When Argus begins acting peculiar, Jack enlists the help of NBC page Kenneth Parcell (Jack McBrayer). Kenneth—who knows all the peafowl calls—tells Jack that Argus muttered senpai and kōhai—master and pupil—nicknames that Geiss and Jack had for each other (<b>a</b> <b>ruse</b> conceived by Liz, who knew of the nicknames). Immediately, Jack is convinced that Geiss's soul has inhabited Argus, prompting Jack to release his grief to Argus and finally accepting Geiss's death.|$|E
5|$|Eliab Harvey {{was born}} in Chigwell, Essex to William and Emma Harvey. His father William Harvey was a Member of Parliament for Essex, but died when Harvey was only five years old, in 1763. Until 1768, Harvey was raised at the family estate of Rolls Park in Chigwell, which had passed to his elder brother William {{on the death of}} their father. Harvey then {{attended}} Westminster School for two years before moving to Harrow School in 1770. At the age of thirteen in 1771, Harvey was entered onto the books of the naval schooner HMS Mary, although he did not actually serve aboard the ship. Utilising a standard legal fiction of the time, Harvey's name was entered on the ship's books without his actual presence, <b>a</b> <b>ruse</b> that would provide him with sufficient seniority to gain rapid promotion when he did enter the navy. In his summer holidays from school, Harvey served at sea, joining HMS Orpheus in 1773.|$|E
