40|$|Teachers, {{speech and}} {{language}} therapists, teaching <b>assistants</b> and <b>nursery</b> <b>nurses</b> {{are required to}} work together in a range of contexts in Foundation Stage (FS) school settings in the UK. In some cases these groups of practitioners are mutually involved in the implementation of a strategy or intervention and in the use of a particular tool or resource with children in these settings. The use of graphic symbols with children in the FS of education is increasingly common in mainstream and special school settings and is an activity that may involve any combination of practitioners in these professional groups. Graphic symbols are used {{with a wide range of}} children for a diverse range of purposes. A study was conducted in which the experiences of teachers, speech and language therapists, teaching <b>assistants</b> and <b>nursery</b> <b>nurses</b> using graphic symbols in FS school settings were explored. Practitioners in each of these groups working in the East Midlands region of the UK were interviewed about their experiences of using graphic symbols. The findings of this study encompassed a thematic framework and theoretical model depicting the patterns and themes emerging in the practitioners’ accounts. The proposed theoretical model suggests that practitioners are influenced by their unique professional reasoning processes, as well as the ways they perceive their own professional role and the roles of others. This article introduces the proposed theoretical model reflecting the factors influencing the collaborative implementation of graphic symbols in these FS school settings. Implications for collaborative practice in schools are considered...|$|R

40|$|Assistants {{have been}} working in schools for many years. There are {{numerous}} types of assistants at the moment, such as: school caretakers, cleaners, cooks, dinner ladies, classroom <b>assistants</b> (including <b>nursery</b> <b>nurses)</b> and school secretaries. They relieve teaching staff from non-professional or time-consuming tasks, which could {{be carried out by}} a responsible adult, rather than a qualified teacher. The ST A initiative introduced a different set of tasks for classroom assistants. These placed a direct emphasis on assistants "contributing to teaching and learning of basic skills" (DfE 1993 : par. 33). STAs were trained to work in the classroom supporting children with mathematics and English activities as opposed to carrying out non-teaching tasks such as: photocopying, making booklets or preparing resources for lessons, previously expected of assistants. The ST A scheme was the first initiative to acknowledge explicitly that assistants could contribute to teaching; a professional duty expected of a teacher. The National Union of Teachers (NUT) and the Association of Teachers and Lecturers (ATL) construed this as a challenge to teachers' professionalism; but the STA initiative has not created a new challenge. The vision that assistants can contribute to teaching has been known for some time. The Plowden Report (CACE 1967) first discussed the prospect of introducing teacher aides almost thirty years ago, but at that time it was not realised. Since then to the present day, assistants have seen their deployment change through the plethora of educational policy and the demands they have placed on teachers in their classrooms. This has led teachers to use the support they receive of assistants in different ways to maintain and raise standards in education. Assistants' roles, in recent years, have vi changed and they are likely to continue to change, as announcements from the government indicate (DfEE 1998). However, a concern regarding the STA scheme is that a minority of STAs' roles went much further than what might be expected. They were used as surrogate teachers with qualified teacher responsibilities...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{explores the}} job of <b>nursery</b> <b>nurses</b> working in English Primary and Infant Schools {{in terms of their}} tasks and {{perceptions}} of their jobs. Educational management theory presently overlooks the increasingly important role of support staff, and in particular <b>nursery</b> <b>nurses,</b> who receive a professional training. The literature review reveals that there is no coherent body of research on <b>nursery</b> <b>nurses</b> and shows that their job as support or complementary staff is patchily under researched. The literature reviewed also deals with the problematic question of how can school effectiveness be maximised if the contribution of members of staff, such as <b>nursery</b> <b>nurses,</b> is not fully recognised.;This is a descriptive study and it analyses data from covert participant observation; questionnaires; group interviews and telephone interviews, obtained from the majority of <b>nursery</b> <b>nurses</b> working in one County. The purpose of the research was to establish the extent of the nursery nurses' jobs and to find out their opinions on their current position in schools, working with three-five year olds.;The findings portray <b>nursery</b> <b>nurses</b> as often invisible within the school culture, and their increasingly unrecognised workload. <b>Nursery</b> <b>nurses</b> perceive that various groups within the school and outside it are not aware of the extent of their role, nor do they ascribe appropriate value to it.;It is argued that the way forward is for the school sector and others in Early Years education to recognise and reward professionals other than Early Years teachers. A case for increased research, focused on <b>nursery</b> <b>nurses</b> as complementary colleagues, is made. Given the current political and educational emphases on Early Years, this group of professionals is in danger of being a wasted, unrecognised and invisible resource...|$|R

40|$|There {{has been}} a recent {{increase}} {{in the use of}} graphic symbols in school settings (Abbott and Lucey, 2003). However, the use of graphic symbols in schools remains, to date, an under-researched area. In order to address this and develop understanding of practitioners’ experiences of using graphic symbols in school settings, exploratory research was conducted investigating the experiences of a range of practitioners using symbols in Foundation Stage school settings. A qualitative research design was used drawing upon an interpretive phenomenological philosophical framework. The research sample consisted of three groups of practitioners; teachers, early years practitioners (teaching assistants, learning support <b>assistants</b> and <b>nursery</b> <b>nurses)</b> and speech and language therapists. Data were collected through semi-structured interviews which were conducted face-to-face by the researcher. In the interviews participants were encouraged to explore their experiences of using graphic symbols and their associated beliefs and attitudes about this topic. Interview data was analysed using thematic analysis which was facilitated by the use of qualitative data management software QSR NVivo 2. Prolonged engagement with the data {{led to the development of}} a theoretical framework based on a set of themes and subthemes. Four major themes were identified: practitioners’ beliefs about which children to use symbols with; practitioners’ thoughts about children’s understanding of symbols; practitioners’ accounts of the ways symbols are used; and, practitioners’ experiences of the implementation of symbols. Interpretations of the data were extended further to develop two original theoretical constructs; ‘models of reasoning’ and ‘perceptions of professional roles’. These constructs were developed to provide an over-arching framework depicting the researcher’s interpretations of the data set as a whole. The findings suggest that practitioners go through a process of reasoning and decision making surrounding the use of symbols. Practitioners in this study also appeared to be influenced by their perceptions of their own professional role and those of others in their decisions surrounding the implementation of symbols. The theoretical model may provide some explanation for the ways in which individual practitioners interact and work alongside practitioners from the same and different professional groups. The findings of the research were related to existing literature in the fields of symbolic development, symbols and literacy, and, collaborative working. The findings led to the development of five suggestions for future research...|$|R
40|$|During March and April 2004 5, 000 local {{authority}} employed <b>nursery</b> <b>nurses</b> in Scotland {{were involved in}} a national all-out strike.

40|$|There is {{debate among}} early years experts about the {{appropriate}} degree of emotional engagement between <b>nursery</b> <b>nurses</b> {{and the children}} in their care. Through research into the learning cultures of further education (in the Economic and Social Research Council’s Teaching and Learning Research Programme), the author considers how prospective <b>nursery</b> <b>nurses</b> first learn to deploy emotion in their work. Few researchers have investigated the learning of feelings for caring occupations, and this article presents a detailed case study, based on both quantitative and qualitative data, {{of a group of}} childcare students throughout their two-year course. In analysing its official, unwritten, and hidden curricula, and the social practices of learning it entails, the author draws on feminist readings of Marx and Bourdieu to reveal how gendered and class-fractional positionings combine with vocational education and training to construct imperatives about ‘correct’ emotions in childcare. The author compares theorisations of emotional capital and emotional labour, and suggests we need social rather than individualised understandings of how feelings are put to work. The author concludes that emotional labour carries costs for the <b>nursery</b> <b>nurse,</b> not because children consume her emotional resources, but because her emotional labour power is controlled and exploited for profit by employers...|$|R

40|$|The {{present study}} {{compared}} deployment of working—class mothers, teachers and <b>nursery</b> <b>nurses</b> in day—to—day activities in pre—school set— tings. Naturalistic observation {{was used in}} two pre—schools run on free—play lines located in socially deprived areas. Mothers were observed in the room their "Own" children attended. Teachers and mothers were studied alone {{and with the other}} present in order to discover {{the extent to which the}} presence of one affects the behaviour of the other. Time spent by mothers in direct contact; indirect contact, dealing with equipment, interaction with adults and not involved was compared with that spent by the other two groups. Direct and indirect contact were analysed at two different levels: (a) all time mothers spent with chil— dren was considered, (b) time spent with "Own" children was disregarded. Significantly larger within group differences were observed for mothers when compared with teachers and <b>nursery</b> <b>nurses</b> in direct contact and no activity. Significant differences in direct contact were observed for mothers compared with the other two groups. Significant differences in direct contact were due to: (a) wider within group differences for the group of mothers than nursery nurses; (b) more time spent by teachers than mothers. Time spent involved in no activity showed: (a) signifi— cantly more varied behaviour than teachers, (b) significantly more time than <b>nursery</b> <b>nurses.</b> Behaviours observed for mothers appeared to be influenced by how they became involved; those invited by teachers show— ing more time with the children and less not involved. It was also found that teachers spent little time with "Own" children (large within group differences were found). However, teacher—"Own" child interaction was found to be somewhat lessened for some children due to the presence of the mothers.

40|$|The {{evidence}} that breastfeeding reduces mortality and {{short and long-term}} morbidity among premature and small babies is well established but breastfeeding rates in neonatal units in the UK remain low. The {{aim of this study}} was to develop and evaluate an eLearning module that addresses the learning needs of neonatal clinicians to support breastfeeding on Neonatal Intensive Care Units (NICU). The module focussed on the knowledge areas of anatomy and physiology of lactation and expression. Mixed methodology was used to evaluate the eLearning module and inform its iterative development. This consisted of quasi-experimental pre-test/post-test studies using The Neonatal Unit Clinical Assessment Tool (NUCAT), an on-line objective knowledge test with self ratings of confidence to test the effects of the eLearning module on knowledge, confidence in knowledge and confidence in practice. Semi-structured interviews explored neonatal clinicians’ experiences of undertaking the eLearning module and their perceptions of the feasibility and applicability of the eLearning module as well as their opinions and experiences of breastfeeding support and training. In total 101 neonatal clinicians, including neonatal nurses, doctors, Advanced Neonatal <b>Nurse</b> Practitioners (ANNPs), <b>nursery</b> <b>nurses</b> and students undertook the initial NUCAT assessment of knowledge and confidence. A further 90 clinicians went on to complete the training and post intervention assessment, 60 repeated the post intervention assessment at 6 - 8 weeks. Baseline knowledge was greater in the area of breast milk expression than in the anatomy and physiology of lactation. Neonatal nurses were found to have greater baseline knowledge of breast milk expression than doctors or <b>nursery</b> <b>nurses.</b> Doctors/ANNPs were more knowledgeable about the anatomy and physiology of lactation. Following the training intervention doctors/ANNPs showed the greatest improvement in knowledge scores and <b>nursery</b> <b>nurses</b> the least. Knowledge and confidence was significantly increased immediately following the intervention and at 6 - 8 weeks in all groups. The semi-structured interviews conducted after the study showed the feasibility and applicability of the eLearning module for clinicians in NICU. On-line assessment and training provide a potentially effective multidisciplinary training method to improve breastfeeding knowledge and confidence. <b>Nursery</b> <b>nurse</b> may have differing learning needs and require further support and training...|$|R
