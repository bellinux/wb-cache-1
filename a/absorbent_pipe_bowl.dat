This firm top layer and looser bottom layer produce a long burn with fewer re-lights, suitable for competition smoking or general pipe smoking.|$|R

5000|$|... "Drug Containing" [...] {{cannabis}} (aka marijuana) can be smoked in {{a variety}} of pipe-like implements made in different shapes and of different materials ("bowls"), water pipes ("bongs"), cigarettes ("joints"), or blunts. When smoking a joint or blunt with someone else or a group of people, it is common courtesy to take no more than two inhalations ("pulls", [...] "hits", [...] "rips") then pass it on. With a <b>pipe,</b> <b>bowl,</b> bong, or vape, one inhalation is the norm.|$|R

50|$|One {{traditional}} {{method of}} manufacture {{is the use of}} bow drills made with hard white quartz points for drilling sacred objects from stone.

50|$|The {{wood of the}} {{mountain}} laurel is heavy and strong but brittle, with a close, straight grain.

It can be used for handrails or guard rails.|$|R
6000|$|He went {{straight}} to a wigwam which stood near the fort, lifted the skin door, entered, and sat down beside the fire opposite to a hunter not unlike himself.
