5|$|The {{options for}} the new stadium {{included}} adding a third tier to the existing National Stadium, or moving to a new site. This last option was discounted {{because it would have}} required a vast car parking facility, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> put severe short-term pressures on the local transport infrastructure, creating traffic jams and pollution. The committee eventually chose a new stadium on the same site but with considerable increase in its capacity. It would also involve moving the alignment of the stadium from west-east to north-south. This was the option supported by the Millennium Commission. It would become the fourth redevelopment of the Cardiff Arms Park site. It was also decided that the new stadium should have a sliding roof to accommodate a multi-use venue, with a grass pitch for rugby and football. The only other sliding roofs in Europe at the time were at two Dutch stadia – the Amsterdam Arena, completed in 1996 with a capacity of 50,000; and Gelredome in Arnhem, a 30,000-capacity ground built from 1996 to 1998.|$|E
25|$|On November 15, 1979, {{a meeting}} took {{place with a}} US {{delegation}} and the Portuguese government and military command to discuss the acquisition of the new fighters. A first proposal was {{for the purchase of}} 20 F-5 Tiger II to be delivered between May and October 1981, at a cost of 120 million dollars; additional spare parts were not included. Since the agreement {{for the use of the}} Lajes Air Base by the United States was only valued at 72 million dollars, Portugal would have been required to take out a 48 million dollar loan through the FMS, which would also dry up funds to acquire other types of aircraft and would require the additional payment of loan interest rates. Another proposal valued at 79 million dollars was for 12 F-5 fighters to be delivered between May and August 1981. This proposal would still have required a loan of 7 million dollars through the FMS and would not even have allowed for the formation of a complete squadron. The final proposal was for the acquisition of 30 A-7A Corsair II for 49 million dollars, which would be paid completely with the money from the Lajes agreement <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> still have left funds for the modernization of the aircraft.|$|E
25|$|After {{the siege}} General Díaz was {{informed}} that Hungarian troops {{are present in the}} city. At the moment the Hungarian cavalry found shelter in the National Palace, when Díaz personally sent for Major Csizmadia and granted him a meeting. The two had known each other {{for quite a long time}} as Csizmadia served as a prison lieutenant in Puebla when Díaz was held as captive there. On one occasion Díaz refused to be taken to the bathroom by a low-rank prison guard when Csizmadia offered to personally escort him there, which was an unusual courtesy. He even invited the General for a lunch at his house, who accepted it. The lieutenant dealt with his inmate amicably and they even attended a bullfight together. Díaz only refused a closer friendship to evolve because he feared to having been labeled pro-Imperialist, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> ruined his image. On 20 September 1865 he successfully escaped from the prison using a rope and a dagger with the acquiescence and consent of the Hungarian officer. He praised Csizmadia's generous and noble attitude towards him several times in his later memoirs. This was the reason he was looking for the captured Csizmadia after the siege and allowed him and his Hungarian regiment to move to Vera Cruz and to be taken home on the board of the Austrian ship SMS Novara along with the rest of the Austrian corps. Csizmadia also helped to negotiate the same terms of surrender for the Austrians as well.|$|E

2500|$|The 1982 NBA draft saw the Jazz pick Dominique Wilkins. The Jazz {{would have}} {{preferred}} to take either James Worthy or Terry Cummings, but those players went 1-2 to the Lakers and Clippers, respectively; Utah had been confident that the Lakers would take Wilkins <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> given them a shot at either of the other top forwards (they favored Cummings over Worthy because Cummings had shown he could play both small and power forward), and Utah wasn't aware that the Lakers had researched both Worthy and Wilkins and decided on Worthy out of concern about Wilkins' perceived selfishness. [...] Battistone's continued financial problems, combined with Wilkins making it clear {{he did not want to}} play in Utah, resulted in the Jazz sending Wilkins to Atlanta in return for John Drew and Freeman Williams. [...] This trade, even considering the circumstances, turned out to be one of the worst trades in NBA history. [...] Wilkins would go on to a Hall of Fame career, while Drew and Williams would only play a combined four seasons with the Jazz.|$|E
