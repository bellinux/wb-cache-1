30|$|Personnel, {{time and}} {{financial}} resources required for the adaptation also must be addressed. It is difficult to calculate {{the extent of the}} adjustment effort in advance because details concerning the adaptation do not fully emerge until the actual adaptation is in progress. For our adaptation we guesstimated roughly one full-time senior-level position and one full-time research assistant for half a year to conduct the <b>adaptation</b> <b>study</b> <b>and</b> one full-time senior-level position for IT support for 2  months. It would also be helpful to interview test developers for the required test development resources. If we had taken only one task from ALUSIM and conducted a pilot study including appropriate IT components, we would have gained important insights into the adaptation process and details, found pitfalls in advance, and perhaps we would have decided to develop (parts) of the simulation from the beginning. Thus, in cases of uncertainty, it is highly advisable to implement preliminary adaptations in the field before adapting an entire computer-based test.|$|R

40|$|This M. F. A. thesis in dramaturgy {{presents}} the first-ever stage adaptation of South African writer Marlene van Niekerk’s 2004 novel Agaat. Van Niekerk is an internationally acclaimed novelist, short story writer, poet, and dramatist particularly {{known for her}} lengthy novelistic excavations of Afriakner identity, in which sexuality, race, and gender collide in compelling but fraught ways. Covering nearly fifty-years of South African history—from the establishment of apartheid in 1948 through the nation’s transition to democracy in 1994 —Agaat investigates everyday cycles of abuse and intimacy through the story of white farmer Milla de Wet and her coloured adopted daughter-cum-maid, Agaat Lourier. This thesis foregrounds the interconnections {{between theory and practice}} by presenting both the adaptation itself and a prolonged engagement with theories of adaptation and dramaturgy. It is framed, then, around a simple question: How might dramaturgy and adaptation, as cultural and artistic processes and products, encounter one another? Through analysis of current discussions in the fields of <b>Adaptation</b> <b>Studies</b> <b>and</b> dramaturgy, and reflections on the particular challenges and possibilities of adapting van Niekerk’s novel to the stage, the thesis argues that adaption can be understood as a mode of encounter that opens up spaces for connection between people, texts, and cultures. A dramaturgical method of adaptation is concerned not with hierarchy, authority, and fidelity, but rather with viewing adaptation as a conversation between a network of resonances. The thesis begins with an overview of van Niekerk’s work and context, moves to an examination of current conversations in <b>Adaptation</b> <b>Studies</b> <b>and</b> dramaturgy, and concludes with a prolonged reflection on the process of adapting Agaat to the stage...|$|E
30|$|Tendon {{stiffness}} is {{the most}} frequently used parameter to study tendon adaptation due to maturation (Waugh et al. 2011), aging (Narici and Maganaris. 2006), training (Foure et al. 2010;Westh et al. 2008), inactivity (Reeves et al. 2005) and disease (Zhao et al. 2009). However, it has been postulated that human tendons are viscoelastic and that their mechanical properties, like stiffness, depend on {{the rate at which the}} load is applied (Fung. 1993;Pioletti et al. 1998;Sanjeevi. 1982). This study was motivated by the observation that in the published literature, there is currently no consensus about the loading rate dependency or hysteresis of human tendons in vivo. In addition, viscoelastic behaviour is often disregarded in tendon <b>adaptation</b> <b>studies</b> <b>and</b> mechanical properties are determined at a variety of different loading rates.|$|E
40|$|Contemporary studies about film {{adaptations of}} {{literary}} texts face many obstacles {{when it comes}} to compare two different media.

Regarding Blancanieves not only as an adaptation of the Grimms’ text(s), but also and above all as a reconfiguration of numerous media forms (film, photography, opera, among others), reveals how the Spanish director differentiates himself from the German tale and creates a new story with renewed meanings which echo the current social, economical and political situation of Spain...|$|E

40|$|Pitch {{constancy}} {{relates to}} perceiving the same pitch from tones with differing spectral shapes {{and is one}} key criteria for identifying a pitch selective neural representation in auditory cortex. Here we used an event-related potential (ERP) <b>adaptation</b> <b>study</b> <b>and</b> a behavioural task (target same/different) to investigate whether pitch coding is invariant to changes in timbre. Adaptation is observed as a decrease in N 100 -P 200 when the same stimulus is repeated because overlapping neuronal populations encode the stimulus. Reduced adaptation indicates that new neuronal populations are recruited to encode a change in an acoustic feature of interest (i. e. pitch, timbre or both). If neurons are selective to pitch (invariant to timbre), reduced adaptation should occur for pitch changes only. If selective to both (non-invariant to timbre), reduced adaptation should occur for pitch and timbre changes. Similarly, stimulus discrimination during the behavioural task should not require any additional processing resources if neurons are selective to pitch only, and hence reaction times and accuracy should be equivalent across conditions. If neurons are selective to both pitch and timbre, longer reaction times and poorer accuracy should be observed for timbre changes. We found reduced adaptation in the N 100 -P 200 and increased reaction times and poorer accuracy for timbre changes. This suggests that neurons in auditory cortex are selective to both pitch and timbre, i. e. pitch coding is non-invariant to timbre. This supports recent evidence suggesting interdependence between pitch...|$|R

Washed cells released chloride in stoichiometric amounts from o-, m-, and p-dichlorobenzene, 2, 5 -dichlorophenol, 4 -chlorophenol, 3 -chlorocatechol, 4 -chlorocatechol, and 3, 6 -dichlorocatechol. Initial steps in the pathway for p-dichlorobenzene degradation were determined by isolation of metabolites, simultaneous <b>adaptation</b> <b>studies,</b> <b>and</b> assay of enzymes in cell extracts. Results indicate that p-dichlorobenzene was initially converted by a dioxygenase to 3, 6 -dichloro-cis- 1, 2 -dihydroxycyclohexa- 3, 5 -diene, which was converted to 3, 6 -dichlorocatechol by an NAD+-dependent dehydrogenase. Ring cleavage of 3, 6 -dichlorocatechol was by a 1, 2 -oxygenase to form 2, 5 -dichloro-cis, cis-muconate. Enzymes for degradation of haloaromatic compounds were induced in cells grown on chlorobenzene or p-dichlorobenzene, but not in cells grown on benzene, succinate, or yeast extract.

40|$|Coastal climate adaptation, as a {{response}} to managing the increasing risk of inundation of coastal settlements and infrastructure, is a global challenge. As a result, there is a burgeoning body of studies recommending adaptation options, pathways and strategies generated by the research and increasingly private consulting sector. However, recent reviews of global adaptation performance repeatedly highlight a lack of implementation of many <b>adaptation</b> <b>studies</b> <b>and</b> plans. It is suggested here {{that one of the reasons}} why many coastal adaptation plans have not been applied is due to inadequate consideration of the political risk, underpinned by lack of consideration of potential allocation and distributional impacts of adaptation strategies. The work presented here identifies the political risk of the most common coastal adaptation pathways and approaches ('retreat', 'protect' and 'manage'). This work especially highlights the major political risk of pre-emptive planned retreat adaptation strategies, which may seem the most obvious adaptation approach from the perspective of minimising future risks to settlements and infrastructure. However, it carries the largest political risk and potential distributional impacts, which is likely to hinder the adoption of this adaptation strategy in the short term. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd...|$|E

40|$|Contemporary {{theoretical}} {{trends in}} <b>Adaptation</b> <b>Studies</b> <b>and</b> Translation Studies (Aragay 2005; Catrysse 2014; Milton 2009; Venuti 2007) envisage synergies {{between the two}} areas that {{can contribute to the}} sociocultural and artistic value of adaptations. This suggests the application of theoretical insights derived from Translation Studies to the adaptation of novels for the screen (i. e., film adaptations). It is argued that the process of transposing a novel into a filmic product entails an act of bidirectional communication between the book, the novel and the involved contexts of production and reception. Particular emphasis is placed on the role that context plays in this communication. Context here is taken to include paratextual material pertinent to the adapted text and to the film. Such paratext may lead to fruitful analyses of adaptations and, thus, surpass the myopic criterion of fidelity which has traditionally dominated Adaptation Studies. The analysis uses examples of adaptation shifts (i. e., changes between the source novel and the film adaptation) from the film P. S. I Love You (LaGravenese 2007), which are examined against interviews of the author, the director and the cast, the film trailer and one film review...|$|E

40|$|Increasing {{awareness}} of the risks to coastal communities and infrastructure posed by sea level rise and possible climate-induced changes to the frequency and intensity of catchment flooding events have triggered {{a large number of}} studies that have assessed the risk, and developed a prioritisation of actions. These prioritised action recommendations are typically encapsulated in climate adaptation plans and pathways documents, risk reduction strategies, and climate action plans. These studies typically involve a vulnerability assessment task and an action prioritisation task, often performed in the same study. Most of the focus on research and method development over recent decades has been on the first task that aims to quantify the vulnerability of coastal communities and infrastructure. It is argued here {{that as a result of}} this emphasis on assessing vulnerability, at the cost of adequate consideration of response actions, along with the linear ‘fix and forget’ management approach to climate adaptation, has led to a lack of uptake in coastal climate <b>adaptation</b> <b>studies</b> <b>and</b> strategies.
