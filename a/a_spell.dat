5|$|During battle, {{the player}} can {{converse}} with enemies, {{though they are}} restricted to a single set of dialogue options instead of four as in the original Persona.

In the Velvet Room, the player can summon a new Persona that belongs to <b>a</b> <b>spell</b> card's particular Persona family group. As a character gains experience levels, more powerful Personas from <b>a</b> <b>spell</b> card's group become available. In addition to pre-set spell cards, the player can also obtain blank skill cards by forming contracts with enemies through the right conversation. These blank skill cards can be tailored to fit a chosen Persona family.|$|E

With his powers restored, Castiel helps Claire find her long-lost mother, but although Amelia sacrifices herself to save Claire, Claire accepts that the Winchesters and Castiel meant well, even speculating that she will become a Hunter herself. When Rowena – Crowley's long-lost mother – casts <b>a</b> <b>spell</b> to remove the Mark, she also casts <b>a</b> <b>spell</b> that causes Castiel to attack Crowley while she escapes, leaving Castiel driven by a greater rage to the point that he kills two angels until Rowena is forced to cure him.|$|E

50|$|There are {{generally}} {{four types of}} <b>spelling</b> tests. In <b>an</b> oral <b>spelling</b> test, the teacher pronounces each word out loud and the students write each word down. In <b>a</b> <b>spelling</b> bee-type test (see spelling bee below), each student is asked individually one-at-a-time to <b>spell</b> <b>a</b> (different) specific word out loud. In a proofreading-style test, sentences or paragraphs are given to the student on one or more sheets of paper, and the student must find the incorrectly spelled words and supply the correct spellings in the spaces provided. In <b>a</b> multiple choice <b>spelling</b> test, two or more spellings are given for each word in the test, and the student must place a mark next {{to the one that}} is correct. The main difference between most spelling tests at school and <b>a</b> <b>spelling</b> bee is that in <b>a</b> <b>spelling</b> bee the students do not get to know in advance which words will be tested, but for regular spelling tests they do.|$|R

5|$|Gautier thought Heine's Wilis and Hugo's fifteen-year-old Spanish {{girl would}} make a good ballet story. His first idea was to present an empty ballroom {{glittering}} with crystal and candlelight. The Wilis would cast <b>a</b> <b>spell</b> over the floor. Giselle and other dancers would enter and whirl through the room, unable to resist the spell to keep them dancing. Giselle would try to keep her lover from partnering other girls.

5|$|Since around 1937, Verity had {{expected}} {{the outbreak of}} the Second World War and had prepared for it through reading military literature. He and Bowes decided to enlist together, and after briefly serving in the Air Raid Precautions in Guiseley until Bowes' wife gave birth, they attempted to join the infantry. However, Bowes was hampered by an old knee complaint and later became a gunnery officer. After serving as a sapper in the Royal Engineers, Verity was commissioned in January 1940 as a second lieutenant in the Green Howards, and later promoted to captain. Following <b>a</b> <b>spell</b> at the Infantry Training Centre, he was posted to the 1stBattalion. He served at the regimental depot in Richmond, North Yorkshire, where he was responsible for training recruits. In the spring of 1941, the battalion moved to Omagh in Northern Ireland for further training. Verity's Yorkshire and England teammate Norman Yardley was also in the 1st Battalion; the fame of these cricketers made an impression on the local population. Playing several cricket matches, Verity frequently took wickets on rough pitches that were unsuitable for batting. There was even time for his appearance in a charity match at Lord's. In August, he returned to England and after <b>a</b> <b>spell</b> in London, he was posted overseas.|$|E

Although suspecting the English are lying, the Bishop abandons Joan to her fate, and she is burned alive in the marketplace of Rouen, though a postscript adds that she was canonized as a saint in the 20th century.|$|E
