5|$|During {{training}} camp in September 1995, Islanders head coach Mike Milbury heralded Bertuzzi as the team's best performing forward. Making his NHL debut on October 7, 1995, he scored <b>a</b> <b>wrap</b> around goal against goaltender Blaine Lacher in a 4–4 tie with the Boston Bruins. Beginning the season on the team's top line with Zigmund Palffy and Travis Green, Bertuzzi finished his rookie year with 18 goals and 39 points over 76 games. The following season, Bertuzzi recorded 23 points in 64 games. The Islanders did not qualify for the playoffs in either of his two full seasons with the club, ranking second-last in the Eastern Conference in 1995–96 and 1996–97.|$|E

Then when Hov called he said, 'I'm gonna do it with you.' I was like, 'Dag, this is big.' But when I did it, I kept it me and kept it 'hood. At first I ain't think she was gonna like it but she called and said she loved it. From there it was <b>a</b> <b>wrap.</b> That's history.

25|$|Traditional babywearing in Japan {{was done}} with <b>a</b> <b>wrap</b> carry, using an obi (sash). In the 1940s, a carrier known as the onbuhimo became popular. Similar to the Hmong and Mei tai carriers, the onbuhimo has long top straps and a {{rectangular}} body. But {{at the bottom of}} the rectangle, loops or rings allow the top straps to be threaded through and tightened, while the straps are tied at the waist. The body is much smaller than the bodies of most mei tais and other Asian-style carriers, and the onbuhimo is traditionally used on the back. Variations may have stiff headrests or padding in the body.|$|E

40|$|We {{report a}} new organic {{photovoltaics}} (OPV) design, <b>a</b> <b>wrapped</b> OPV, which can circumvent both challenges of short exciton diffusion length [1], and low charge carrier mobility [2] of organic semiconductors by orienting the OPV vertically, to capture; manage; guide and use all incident photons and therefore, generate higher current.

25|$|Roti is eaten widely {{across the}} Caribbean, {{especially}} {{in countries with}} large Indo-Caribbean populations such as Trinidad and Tobago, Guyana, Suriname, Jamaica. Originally brought to the islands by indentured laborers from the Indian subcontinent, roti has become a popular staple in the culturally rich cuisines of Trinidad and Tobago, Suriname, Guyana, and Jamaica. In the Caribbean, roti is commonly eaten as an accompaniment to various curries and stews. The traditional way of eating roti is to break the roti by hand, using it to sop up sauce and pieces of meat from the curry. However, in the Caribbean, the term roti may refer to both the flat-bread (roti) itself {{as well as the}} more popular street food item, in which the roti is folded around a savory filling in the form of <b>a</b> <b>wrap.</b>|$|E
25|$|Outside Western cultures, male {{clothing}} includes {{skirts and}} skirt-like garments. One common form {{is a single}} sheet of fabric folded and wrapped around the waist, such as the dhoti/veshti or lungi in India, and sarong in South and Southeast Asia, and Sri Lanka. In Myanmar {{both women and men}} wear a longyi, a wraparound tubular skirt like a sarong that reaches to the ankles for women and to mid-calf for men. There are different varieties and names of sarong depending on whether the ends are sewn together or simply tied. There is a difference in the way a dhoti and lungi is worn. While a lungi is more like <b>a</b> <b>wrap</b> around, wearing the dhoti involves the creation of pleats by folding it. A dhoti also passes between the legs making it more like a folded loose trouser rather than a skirt.|$|E

James McAvoy defended the decision of casting Hathaway by stating that a director should, [...] "find the right actor…and [...] is undoubtedly brilliant." [...] Hathaway herself admitted the persistent tendency to [...] "sound too much like myself and not at all like Jane", blaming cold weather in Ireland, which meant she had to do voice retakes for several scenes.
