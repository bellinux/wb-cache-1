5|$|A {{number of}} Armenians joined the {{advancing}} 11th Soviet Red Army. Afterward, Turkey <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>newly</b> proclaimed Soviet republics in the Caucasus negotiated the Treaty of Kars, in which Turkey resigned from its claims to Batumi to Georgia {{in exchange for}} the Kars territory, corresponding to the modern-day Turkish provinces of Kars, Iğdır, and Ardahan. The medieval Armenian capital of Ani, as well as the cultural icon of the Armenian people Mount Ararat, were located in the ceded area. Additionally, Joseph Stalin, then acting Commissar for Nationalities, granted the areas of Nakhchivan and Nagorno-Karabakh (both of which were promised to Armenia by the Bolsheviks in 1920) to Azerbaijan.|$|E
5|$|A rift {{opened and}} {{subsequently}} flooded {{the region as}} part of the breakup of the supercontinent Rodinia in the Neoproterozoic (by about 755million years ago) and the creation of the Pacific Ocean. A shoreline similar to the present Atlantic Ocean margin of the United States lay to the east. An algal mat-covered carbonate bank was deposited, forming the Noonday Dolomite. Subsidence of the region occurred as the continental crust thinned <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>newly</b> formed Pacific widened, forming the Ibex Formation. An angular unconformity (an uneven gap in the geologic record) followed.|$|E
5|$|After Israel {{captured}} East Jerusalem from Jordan in 1967, {{a number}} of plans were submitted {{for the design of}} a new building. After years of deliberation and indecision, a commemorative arch was erected instead at the site in 1977, itself becoming a prominent landmark of the Jewish Quarter.

5|$|After {{making a}} recovery, Kizirian and the Marine units took {{the capital city}} of NaHa and were {{preparing}} for another assault. Kizirian's unit had fought its way to the crest of a hill and dug in. Kizirian was standing watch at the company command post inside an Okinawa burial ground. When replacements joined the company, many Japanese soldiers harassed the lines by infiltrating the positions of the more inexperienced soldiers. Kizirian ordered that flares should be fired at irregular intervals to would illuminate the scene and distract the enemy. The idea proved successful <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>newly</b> arrived Marines soon had the situation under control.|$|E
5|$|After {{several months}} of {{increasing}} tension between the factions struggling for power within the insurgency, {{the first of the}} pro-Chetnik coups occurred, in the Ozren Partisan Detachment.

Fighting ensued between pro-Chetnik members of the detachment and the Shock Battalion. Vukmanović-Tempo then abandoned the Ozren Partisan Detachment, taking the detachment staff and remaining loyal Partisans with him.|$|E

Charles and Zita left for exile in Switzerland and later Madeira, where Charles died in 1922. After her husband's death, Zita and her son Otto served as symbols of unity for the exiled dynasty.

5|$|Although {{the outward}} {{terminal}} {{of the line}} {{was to be the}} quay at Watchet, the west pier had been practically unusable for some considerable time, and boats were beached and loaded direct from carts brought on to the foreshore. After considerable public pressure, the Watchet Harbour Act was passed in 1857, placing it under the control of Commissioners; they built a new east pier and rebuilt the west pier; the work was finished in 1862, and 500ton vessels could enter the harbour. The WSMR used the west pier, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>newly</b> arrived, broad gauge West Somerset Railway, a branch from the Bristol and Exeter Railway, used the east pier.|$|E
5|$|Around 1279BC, Ramesses II, {{also known}} as Ramesses the Great, ascended the throne, {{and went on to}} build more temples, erect more statues and obelisks, and sire more {{children}} than any other pharaoh in history. A bold military leader, Ramesses II led his army against the Hittites in the Battle of Kadesh (in modern Syria) and, after fighting to a stalemate, finally agreed to the first recorded peace treaty, around 1258BC. With both the Egyptians and Hittite Empire proving unable to gain the upper hand over one another, and both powers also fearful of the expanding Middle Assyrian Empire, Egypt withdrew from much of the Near East. The Hittites were thus left to compete unsuccessfully with the powerful Assyrians <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>newly</b> arrived Phrygians.|$|E
5|$|CFS {{was inaugurated}} at Point Cook, Victoria, in March 1913, and trained over 150 pilots of the Australian Flying Corps during World WarI.

Re-formed under EATS at Point Cook in April 1940, CFS relocated to New South Wales the following month, based first at Camden, then at Tamworth from April 1942, and finally at Parkes from January 1944. It returned to Point Cook in September 1944. By {{the end of}} World WarII, the school had produced more than 3,600 instructors. It transferred to East Sale in November 1947.|$|E

5|$|Central Area was disbanded in August 1941 and its {{responsibilities}} divided between Southern Area, Northern Area, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>newly</b> formed No.2 (Training) Group. The {{outbreak of the}} Pacific War resulted in Northern Area being split in January 1942 into North-Western and North-Eastern Areas, to counter separate Japanese threats to Northern Australia and New Guinea. Southern Area was also considered appropriate for division owing to its size, so the Australian Air Board proposed assigning responsibility for operational and maintenance units within New South Wales to a new area command, Eastern Area, which would also assume control of units in southern Queensland from North-Eastern Area.|$|E
5|$|Development {{within the}} Albert Dock was rapid <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>newly</b> renovated Edward Pavilion (formerly north east stack) was ready {{in time for}} the 1984 Cutty Sark Tall Ship Race. The race was a big success for the city with over one million {{visitors}} into Liverpool over a period of four days, of which 160,000 visited the Albert Dock. In total it is estimated that the two flagship regeneration schemes of the MDC, the tall ships race and International Garden Festival, attracted over 3.5 million visitors to Liverpool in 1984. Also completed in 1984 was the renovation of the dock traffic office, which was fitted out and leased to Granada Television.|$|E
5|$|Edward had {{a normal}} {{upbringing}} for {{a member of}} a royal family. The prince was interested in horses and horsebreeding, and became a good rider; he also liked dogs, in particular greyhounds. In his letters, he shows a quirky sense of humour, joking about sending unsatisfactory animals to his friends, such as horses who disliked carrying their riders, or lazy hunting dogs too slow to catch rabbits. He was not particularly interested in hunting or falconry, both popular activities in the 14th century. He enjoyed music, including Welsh music <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>newly</b> invented crwth instrument, as well as musical organs. He did not take part in jousting, either because he lacked the aptitude or because he had been banned from participating for his personal safety, but he was certainly supportive of the sport.|$|E
