5|$|After {{leaving the}} Nation of Islam, MalcolmX {{announced}} {{his willingness to}} work with leaders {{of the civil rights}} movement, though he advocated some changes to their policies. He felt that calling the movement <b>a</b> <b>struggle</b> <b>for</b> civil rights would keep the issue within the United States, while changing the focus to human rights would make it an international concern. The movement could then bring its complaints before the United Nations, where MalcolmX said the emerging nations of the world would add their support.|$|E
5|$|Although coal, hydrocarbons, iron ore, platinum, copper, chromium, nickel, {{gold and}} other {{minerals}} have been found, {{they have not}} been in large enough quantities to exploit. The 1991 Protocol on Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty also restricts <b>a</b> <b>struggle</b> <b>for</b> resources. In 1998, a compromise agreement was reached to place an indefinite ban on mining, to be reviewed in 2048, further limiting economic development and exploitation. The primary economic activity is the capture and offshore trading of fish. Antarctic fisheries in 2000–01 reported landing 112,934tonnes.|$|E

5|$|If Malcolm {{exercised}} {{control over}} Moray, {{which is far}} from being generally accepted, then the annals record a number of events pointing to <b>a</b> <b>struggle</b> <b>for</b> power in the north.

It seems that Máel Coluim mac Máil Brigti took control of Moray, for his death is reported in 1029.|$|E

5|$|According to the thirteenth-century Historia Gruffud vab Kenan, {{the mother}} of Cynan's son was Ragnailt ingen Amlaíb, a {{paternal}} granddaughter of Sitriuc. Further revealed by this source {{is the fact that}} this woman's father, Amlaíb mac Sitriuc, built and commanded a Welsh fortress called Castell Avloed. Although it is unknown how long the Dubliners possessed the fortress, in 1036 another son of Sitriuc was slain in Wales by an apparent kinsman, an event which could be evidence of <b>a</b> <b>struggle</b> <b>for</b> control of the site. Echmarcach's aforesaid expulsion of Sitriuc from Dublin in the same year could in turn indicate that this exiled monarch sought refuge in Wales.|$|E
5|$|During the 1950s, {{tensions}} arose {{between the}} ARF and Armenian SSR. The death of Catholicos Garegin of the Holy See of Cilicia prompted <b>a</b> <b>struggle</b> <b>for</b> succession. The National Ecclesiastic Assembly, which was largely {{influenced by the}} ARF, elected Zareh of Aleppo. This decision {{was rejected by the}} Echmiadzin-based Catholicos of All Armenians, the anti-ARF coalition, and Soviet Armenian authorities. Zareh extended his administrative authority over {{a large part of the}} Armenian diaspora, furthering the rift that had already been created by his election. This event split the large Armenian community of Lebanon, creating sporadic clashes between the supporters of Zareh and those who opposed his election.|$|E
5|$|Hugh de Lacy died childless around 1115, and Henry I gave Ludlow Castle {{and most}} of the {{surrounding}} estates to Hugh's niece, Sybil, marrying her to Pain fitzJohn, one of his household staff. Pain used Ludlow as his caput, the main castle in his estates, using the surrounding estates and knight's fees to support the castle and its defences. Pain died in 1137 fighting the Welsh, triggering <b>a</b> <b>struggle</b> <b>for</b> the inheritance of the castle. Robert fitzMiles, who had been planning to marry Pain's daughter, laid claim to it, as did Gilbert de Lacy, Roger de Lacy's son. By now, King Stephen had seized the English throne, but his position was insecure and he therefore gave Ludlow to fitzMiles in 1137, in exchange for promises of future political support.|$|E

Rinaldo and Almirena celebrate their love and forthcoming marriage.

Goffredo expresses his forgiveness to his beaten foes and sets them free, before victors and vanquished join in a chorus of reconciliation.|$|E
5|$|James {{was born}} on December 30, 1984 in Akron, Ohio to a 16-year-old mother, Gloria Marie James, who raised the child on her own. When James was growing up, life was often <b>a</b> <b>struggle</b> <b>for</b> the family, as they moved from {{apartment}} to apartment in the seedier neighborhoods of Akron while Gloria struggled to find steady work. Realizing that her son {{would be better off}} in a more stable family environment, Gloria allowed him to move in with the family of Frank Walker, a local youth football coach, who introduced James to basketball when he was nine years old.|$|E
5|$|The Adriatic {{campaign}} of 18071814 was <b>a</b> <b>struggle</b> <b>for</b> supremacy in the Adriatic Sea between the French Navy and the British Royal Navy during the Napoleonic Wars. The {{early stages of}} the campaign saw extensive activity between rival frigate squadrons, climaxing at the Battle of Lissa in 1811 at which the last major French force was destroyed and its commander killed. The subsequent campaign was characterised by sustained raids by British warships on French and Italian convoys, warships and coastal positions across the Adriatic, culminating in the capture of several key French port cities in 1813, during the War of the Sixth Coalition.|$|E

5|$|The game {{is set on}} a {{group of}} islands in a vast sea, a {{departure}} for the series. The player controls series protagonist Link as he attempts to save his sister from the sorcerer Ganon and becomes embroiled in <b>a</b> <b>struggle</b> <b>for</b> the Triforce, a sacred relic that grants its holder's wishes. Aided by allies including pirate captain Tetra – an incarnation of Princess Zelda – and a talking boat named the King of Red Lions, Link sails the ocean, explores islands, and traverses dungeons to acquire the power necessary to defeat Ganon. Wind, which facilitates sailing, plays a prominent role, and can be controlled with a magic conductor's baton called the Wind Waker.|$|E
5|$|At {{the start}} of his reign, Jogaila was preoccupied with unrest in the Lithuanian Rus' lands. In 1377–78, Andrei of Polotsk, the eldest son of Algirdas, {{challenged}} Jogaila's authority and sought to become Grand Duke. In 1380, Andrei and another brother, Dmitry, sided with Prince Dmitri of Moscow against Jogaila's alliance with emir Mamai, de facto khan of the Golden Horde. Jogaila failed to support Mamai, lingering {{in the vicinity of the}} battlefield, which led to Mamai's army's significant defeat at the hands of Prince Dmitri in the Battle of Kulikovo. The Muscovites' Pyrrhic victory over the Golden Horde, in the long term, signified, however, the beginning of a slow climb to power by the Grand Duchy of Moscow, which became within a century the most serious rival and threat to the integrity, well-being and survival of Lithuania. However, in 1380 Muscovy was greatly weakened by tremendous losses suffered during the battle and thus, in the same year, Jogaila was free to begin <b>a</b> <b>struggle</b> <b>for</b> supremacy with Kęstutis.|$|E
5|$|Obtaining {{funding for}} the battleships was <b>a</b> <b>struggle</b> <b>for</b> the Japanese government. The initial request was {{submitted}} in the budget of Prime Minister Matsukata Masayoshi in 1891, but was deleted by the Diet of Japan due to political infighting. Matsukata submitted the request again and, when again denied, was forced to dissolve his cabinet. His successor, Prime Minister Itō Hirobumi, attempted to pass the funding measure in 1892, but he also failed. This led to an extraordinary personal intervention by Emperor Meiji in a statement dated 10 February 1893, wherein the emperor offered to fund {{the construction of the}} two battleships himself, through an annual reduction in the expenses of the Imperial Household, and asked that all government officials likewise agree to a reduction in their salaries by ten percent. The funding measure for the Fuji-class battleships was passed by the Japanese Diet soon after. Completion of the ships was originally scheduled for 1899, but the start of the First Sino-Japanese War shortly before they were laid down in 1894 caused the government to accelerate the schedule by two years.|$|E
