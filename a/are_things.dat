25|$|Several {{cultures}} built temples (Khajuraho, India) {{or other}} structures (Sagaholm, barrow, Sweden) with zoophilic carvings on the exterior, however at Khajuraho these depictions {{are not on}} the interior, perhaps depicting that these <b>are</b> <b>things</b> that belong to the profane world rather than the spiritual world, and thus are to be left outside.|$|E
25|$|These {{sketches}} {{begin by}} announcing {{an activity that}} shouldn't be done whilst naked and assigning the activity a number. The sketches then depict one of the cast members performing the activity. The humour {{comes from the fact}} that the activities <b>are</b> <b>things</b> that shouldn't be done at all, naked or otherwise such as eating a surfboard, towel whipping a bear or impersonating the Crazy Frog ring tone. According to the Season 1 DVD commentary, when Heath Franklin appears in one of these sketches he is the only actor to do his naked scenes in the nude, the rest of the cast wore flesh-coloured underwear.|$|E
25|$|Most {{chapters}} {{begin with}} brief re-tellings of creation myths that emerged as attempts {{to explain the}} origin of particular observed phenomena. Dawkins selects these myths from throughout the world, including Babylonian, Judeo-Christian, Aztec, Maori, Ancient Egyptian, Australian Aboriginal, Nordic, Hellenic, Chinese, Japanese, and other traditions. Chapter 9 ("Are we alone?") includes contemporary alien-abduction mythology; Chapter 4 ("What <b>are</b> <b>things</b> made of?") omits mythology altogether as Dawkins says that really small phenomena were unknown to primitive peoples prior to the invention of advanced optical magnification equipment, any texts they believed to be divinely inspired having failed to mention such useful knowledge as beyond human experience at the time. Dawkins also revisits his childhood and recalls his initial thoughts on these various phenomena or those thoughts expressed by his young contemporaries. Dawkins gives his critique {{of many of the}} myths, such as when he points out that much mythology involves some god's symbolic transgressive act performed just once, with Dawkins saying that such one-time acts would be inadequate to explain the mechanism as to why the phenomena continue to happen in unbroken cycles.|$|E

60|$|Appearance is, in fact, {{a matter}} of effect merely, and {{it is with the}} effects of nature that you have to deal, not with the real {{condition}} of the object. What you, as painters, have to paint <b>is</b> not <b>things</b> as they <b>are</b> but <b>things</b> as they seem to <b>be,</b> not <b>things</b> as they <b>are</b> but <b>things</b> as they <b>are</b> not.|$|R

25|$|Social {{motivation}} {{is tied to}} one's activity in a group. It cannot form from a single mind alone. For example, bowling alone is naught but the dull act of throwing a ball into pins, and so people are {{much less likely to}} smile during the activity alone, even upon getting a strike because their satisfaction or dissatisfaction {{does not need to be}} communicated, and so it is internalized. However, when with a group, people are more inclined to smile regardless of their results because it acts as a positive communication that is beneficial for pleasurable interaction and teamwork. Thus the act of bowling becomes a social activity as opposed to a dull action because it becomes an exercise in interaction, competition, team building, and sportsmanship. It is because of this phenomenon that studies have shown that people are more intrigued in performing mundane activities so long as there is company because it provides the opportunity to interact in one way or another, be it for bonding, amusement, collaboration, or alternative perspectives. Examples of activities that may one may not be motivated to do alone but could be done with others for social benefit <b>are</b> <b>things</b> such as throwing and catching a baseball with a friend, making funny faces with children, building a treehouse, and performing a debate.|$|E

500|$|Water {{served as}} a motif in the film. It was {{developed}} after researching the wake scene {{at the beginning of}} the film informed the director that corpses were kept on ice in the 1920s to keep bodies from decomposing. The notion was interwoven into the film, which linked the presence of water with death. Mendes reflected on the theme, [...] "The linking of water with death... speaks of the mutability of water and links it to the uncontrollability of fate. These <b>are</b> <b>things</b> that humans can't control." ...|$|E

500|$|Later in the century, the mutakallim Adud al-Din al-Iji (1281â€“1355) {{rejected}} {{the principle of}} uniform and circular motion, following the Ash'ari doctrine of atomism, which maintained that all physical effects were caused directly by God's will rather than by natural causes. [...] He maintained that the celestial spheres were [...] "imaginary things" [...] and [...] "more tenuous than a spider's web". His views were challenged by al-Jurjani (1339â€“1413), who argued {{that even if the}} celestial spheres [...] "do not have an external reality, yet they <b>are</b> <b>things</b> that are correctly imagined and correspond to what [...] in actuality".|$|E

500|$|GoldenEye 007 was {{developed}} by an inexperienced team; eight of its ten developers had never previously worked on video games. As programmer David Doak recalls, [...] "Looking back, there <b>are</b> <b>things</b> I'd be wary of attempting now, but as none of the people working on the code, graphics, and game design had worked on a game before, there was this joyful naÃ¯vetÃ©." [...] Due {{to the success of}} Donkey Kong Country, GoldenEye 007 was originally suggested as a 2D side-scrolling platformer for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System, but Martin Hollis, the director and producer of the game, proposed [...] "a 3D shooting game" [...] for Nintendo's in-development [...] "Ultra 64" [...] console.|$|E

5000|$|The idealistic BBC {{motto is}} most likely based on biblical verses from the Book of Micah and the Book of Isaiah: [...] "Nation shall not lift up sword against nation, neither shall they learn war anymore.In 1934 the motto was changed to [...] "Quaecunque", meaning [...] "Whatsoever". This was {{inspired}} by St Paul's Epistle to the Philippians 4:8: English (King James Bible):Finally, brethren, whatsoever <b>things</b> <b>are</b> true, whatsoever <b>things</b> <b>are</b> honest, whatsoever <b>things</b> <b>are</b> just, whatsoever <b>things</b> <b>are</b> pure, whatsoever <b>things</b> <b>are</b> lovely, whatsoever <b>things</b> <b>are</b> of good report; if there be any virtue, and if there be any praise, think on these things. This inspired the dedication that appears in the entrance hall of Broadcasting House: English:This Temple of the Arts and Muses is dedicated to Almighty God by the first Governors of Broadcasting House in the year 1931, Sir John Reith being Director-General. It is their prayer that good seed sown may bring forth a good harvest, that all things hostile to peace or purity may be banished from this house, and that the people, inclining their ear to whatsoever <b>things</b> <b>are</b> beautiful and honest and of good report, may tread the path of wisdom and uprightness.|$|R
500|$|In mid-2002, Slipknot went on hiatus {{because of}} {{internal}} conflicts, and band members focused on side projects. Vocalist Taylor and guitarist Root revived their band Stone Sour, drummer Jordison created Murderdolls with vocalist Wednesday 13, percussionist Crahan founded To My Surprise and DJ Wilson went solo as DJ Starscream. For a while, {{the future of}} Slipknot was uncertain and there was much speculation about whether {{there would be a}} third album, or if the split would become permanent. [...] "I don't have a problem with anyone in Slipknot," [...] Jordison protested. [...] "I've seen comments from Corey saying there <b>are</b> <b>things</b> to be resolved, but I have no fucking idea what he's talking about." ...|$|E
500|$|Up {{until the}} middle of 1991, Sega of America had been kept largely uninformed of the details of the project, without a {{functioning}} unit to test (although Sega of America was provided with preliminary technical documents earlier in the year). According to former Sega of America executive producer Michael Latham, [...] "When you work at a multinational company, there <b>are</b> <b>things</b> that go well and there <b>are</b> <b>things</b> that don't. They didn't want to send us working Sega CD units. They wanted to send us dummies and not send us the working CD units until the last minute because they were concerned about what we would do with it and if it would leak out. It was very frustrating." [...] Even though they were not provided a functioning unit, Latham and Sega of America vice president of licensing Shinobu Toyoda put together a functioning Sega CD by acquiring a ROM for the system and installing it in a dummy unit. Further frustrating the Sega of America staff was the construction of the add-on. [...] "The Mega-CD was designed with a cheap, consumer-grade audio CD drive, not a CD-ROM," [...] stated Scot Bayless, former Sega of America senior producer. [...] "Quite late in the run-up to launch, the quality assurance teams started running into severe problems with many of the unitsâ€”and when I say severe, I mean units literally bursting into flames. We worked around the clock, trying to catch the failure in-progress, and after about a week we finally realized what was happening," [...] citing the need for game titles to utilize more time seeking data than the CD drive was designed to provide.|$|E
500|$|The {{episode was}} written by series creator Chris Carter and {{directed}} by Rob Bowman. Bowman was {{not a fan of}} the episode, saying [...] "The show proved to be much more difficult than I anticipated, and there wasn't enough time to shoot the show properly because we were so close to the Christmas break. I felt extremely pressured and frustrated, although there <b>are</b> <b>things</b> in it I love, particularly the banter between Mulder and Scully. But overall, I thought the show was very oblique. I don't feel that the characters ever {{knew what was going on}} and I don't think it is all that cool that kids are murdering people. I didn't feel like I was shooting an episode of the X-Files, and I think I let Chris Carter down a bit." ...|$|E
5000|$|The {{motto of}} the university, Quaecumque vera, {{translates}} to [...] "whatsoever <b>things</b> <b>are</b> true." [...] The original motto lux et lex, was first adopted in 1907, and was translated as [...] "light and law" [...] in Latin. The motto was substituted {{with the present}} motto in 1909. The motto was adopted from the Latin Vulgate version of the Bible, the Epistle to the Philippians, where it states that, [...] Epistle to the Philippians, Chapter 4, Verse 8: â€”:Finally, brethren, whatsoever <b>things</b> <b>are</b> true, whatsoever <b>things</b> <b>are</b> honest, whatsoever <b>things</b> <b>are</b> just, whatsoever <b>things</b> <b>are</b> pure, whatsoever <b>things</b> <b>are</b> lovely, whatsoever <b>things</b> <b>are</b> of good report; if there be any virtue and there be any praise, think on these things.
