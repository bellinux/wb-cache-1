5|$|Active-swimming predators, {{groups of}} leopard sharks often follow the tide onto {{intertidal}} mudflats to forage for food, mainly clams, spoon worms, crabs, shrimp, bony fish, and fish eggs. Most leopard sharks tend to remain within <b>a</b> <b>particular</b> <b>area</b> rather than undertaking long movements elsewhere, {{which has led}} to genetic divergence between populations of sharks living in different regions. This species is aplacental viviparous, meaning that the young hatch inside the uterus and are nourished by yolk. From March to June, the female gives birth to as many as 37 young after a gestation period of 10â€“12 months. It is relatively slow-growing and takes many years to mature.|$|E
5|$|Augmentation {{involves}} the supplemental release of natural enemies {{that occur in}} <b>a</b> <b>particular</b> <b>area,</b> boosting the naturally occurring populations there. In inoculative release, small numbers of the control agents are released at intervals {{to allow them to}} reproduce, in the hope of setting up longer-term control, and thus keeping the pest down to a low level, constituting prevention rather than cure. In inundative release, in contrast, large numbers are released in the hope of rapidly reducing a damaging pest population, correcting a problem that has already arisen. Augmentation can be effective, but is not guaranteed to work, and depends on the precise details of the interactions between each pest and control agent.|$|E
5|$|Biological {{pest control}} is a method of {{controlling}} pests such as insects and mites by using other organisms. It relies on predation, parasitism, herbivory or other natural mechanisms, but typically also involves an active human management role. Classical biological control involves the introduction of natural enemies of the pest that are bred in the laboratory and released into the environment. An alternative approach is to augment the natural enemies that occur in <b>a</b> <b>particular</b> <b>area</b> by releasing more, either in small, repeated batches, or in a single large-scale release. Ideally, the released organism will breed and survive, and provide long-term control. Biological control {{can be an important}} component of an integrated pest management programme.|$|E

Traumatic brain injury, for example in contact sport, after a fall, or in traffic or work accidents, can be associated with both immediate and longer-term problems. Immediate problems that develop may include bleeding within the skull, compressing the brain tissue or damaging its blood supply, skull fractures, injury to <b>a</b> <b>particular</b> <b>area,</b> deafness, and concussion. In addition to the site of injury, the opposite side of the brain may be affected, termed a contrecoup injury. Longer-term issues that may develop include post-traumatic stress, hydrocephalus, and chronic traumatic encephalopathy.|$|E

5|$|Pope John XXIII issued eight Papal Encyclicals {{during his}} five-year reign as Pope of the Roman Catholic Church, from his {{election}} on October 28, 1958 {{until his death}} on June 3, 1963. Two of his encylicals, Mater et magistra and Pacem in terris, are especially important. A Papal Encyclical is a letter sent by the Pope which is addressed to Roman Catholic bishops in <b>a</b> <b>particular</b> <b>area</b> or the whole world. Encyclicals may condemn errors, point out threats to faith and morals, exhort faithful practices, or provide remedies for present and future dangers to the church. The authority of the encyclical varies depending on the circumstances and is not necessarily ex cathedra. The title of a Papal Encyclical is usually taken from its first few words.|$|E

5|$|Primarily a nocturnal grazer, the bohor reedbuck {{may also}} feed at daytime. A {{study showed that}} feeding peaked at dawn and late afternoon. In the night, two feeding peaks were {{observed}} once again: at dusk and midnight. They traverse {{a long way from}} their daytime refuges while grazing. Seasonal differences in {{the amount of time spent}} while grazing in <b>a</b> <b>particular</b> <b>area</b> is possibly related to the availability and quality of grasses there. The bohor reedbuck often grazes in association with other grazers such as hartebeest, topi, puku and kob. In Kenyan farmlands, the reedbuck may feed on growing wheat and cereals.|$|E
5|$|Super Mario Galaxy is set {{in outer}} space, where Mario travels through {{different}} galaxies to collect Power Stars, earned by completing missions, defeating a boss, or reaching <b>a</b> <b>particular</b> <b>area.</b> Each galaxy contains planetoids and orbiting structures for the player to explore. Each astronomical object has its own gravitational force, allowing the player to completely circumnavigate the planetoids, walking sideways or upside down. The player can usually jump from one independent object and fall towards another one nearby. Although the main gameplay is in 3D, there are several areas in the game in which the player's movements are restricted to a 2-dimensional plane.|$|E
5|$|The {{individuals}} within <b>a</b> <b>particular</b> <b>area</b> often {{differ in their}} foraging methods and prey types, and tend to follow the same patterns as their mothers. The diet of local populations also changes over time, as sea otters can significantly deplete populations of highly preferred prey such as large sea urchins, and prey availability is also affected by other factors such as fishing by humans. Sea otters can thoroughly remove abalone from an area except for specimens in deep rock crevices, however, they never completely wipe out a prey species from an area. A 2007 Californian study demonstrated, in areas where food was relatively scarce, {{a wider variety of}} prey was consumed. Surprisingly, though, the diets of individuals were more specialized in these areas than in areas where food was plentiful.|$|E

5|$|Trillium grandiflorum {{has been}} studied {{extensively}} by ecologists due {{to a number of}} unique features it possesses. It is a representative example of a plant whose seeds are spread through myrmecochory, or ant-mediated dispersal, which is effective in increasing the plant's ability to outcross, but ineffective in bringing the plant very far. This has led ecologists to question how it and similar plants were able to survive glaciation events during the ice ages. The height of the species has also been shown to be an effective index of how intense foraging by deer is in <b>a</b> <b>particular</b> <b>area.</b>|$|E
5|$|A {{weather map}} {{displays}} various meteorological features across <b>a</b> <b>particular</b> <b>area</b> {{at a particular}} point in time and has various symbols which all have specific meanings. Such maps have been in use since the mid-19th century and are used for research and weather forecasting purposes. Maps using isotherms show temperature gradients, which can help locate weather fronts. Isotach maps, analyzing lines of equal wind speed, on a constant pressure surface of 300 or 250hPa show where the jet stream is located. Use of constant pressure charts at the 700 and 500hPa level can indicate tropical cyclone motion. Two-dimensional streamlines based on wind speeds at various levels show areas of convergence and divergence in the wind field, which are helpful in determining the location of features within the wind pattern. A popular type of surface weather map is the surface weather analysis, which plots isobars to depict areas of high pressure and low pressure. Cloud codes are translated into symbols and plotted on these maps along with other meteorological data that are included in synoptic reports sent by professionally trained observers.|$|E

5|$|During the day, whitetip reef sharks {{spend much}} of their time resting inside caves. Unlike other requiem sharks, which rely on ram {{ventilation}} and must constantly swim to breathe, this shark can pump water over its gills and lie still on the bottom. At night, whitetip reef sharks emerge to hunt bony fishes, crustaceans, and octopus in groups, their elongate bodies allowing them to force their way into crevices and holes to extract hidden prey. Individuals may stay within <b>a</b> <b>particular</b> <b>area</b> of the reef for months or years, frequently returning to the same shelter. This species is viviparous, in which the developing embryos are sustained by a placental connection to their mother. One of the few sharks in which mating has been observed in the wild, receptive female whitetip reef sharks are followed by prospective males, which attempt to grasp her pectoral fin and maneuver the two of them into positions suitable for copulation. Females give birth to one to six pups every other year, after a gestation period of 1013 months.|$|E
