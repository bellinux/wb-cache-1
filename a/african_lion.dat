5|$|Between 2008 and 2016, IUCN Red List {{assessors}} for lions {{used only}} two subspecific names, P. l. leo for <b>African</b> <b>lion</b> populations and P. l. persica for the Asiatic lion population.|$|E
5|$|Another change {{under the}} second and third Qajar king was the Africanization of the motif. At this time, the lion was an <b>African</b> <b>lion</b> which had a longer mane and bigger body {{compared}} to the Persian lion. Yahya Zoka suggests that this modification was influenced by contact with Europeans.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{discovery}} of the decline of lion population in Africa, several coordinated efforts involving lion conservation have been organised in an attempt to stem this decline. Lions are one species included in the Species Survival Plan, a coordinated attempt by the Association of Zoos and Aquariums to increase its chances of survival. The plan was originally started in 1982 for the Asiatic lion, but was suspended when it was found that most Asiatic lions in North American zoos were not genetically pure, having been hybridised with African lions. The <b>African</b> <b>lion</b> plan started in 1993, focusing especially on the South African subspecies, although there are difficulties in assessing the genetic diversity of captive lions, since most individuals are of unknown origin, making maintenance of genetic diversity a problem.|$|E
5|$|While the subspecific {{status of}} the Asiatic lion (P. l. persica) is {{generally}} accepted, the systematic relationships among <b>African</b> <b>lions</b> are still not completely resolved. Mitochondrial variation in living <b>African</b> <b>lions</b> seemed to be modest according to some newer studies; therefore, all sub-Saharan lions have sometimes been considered a single subspecies. However, a recent study revealed that lions from western and central Africa differ genetically from lions of southern or eastern Africa. According to this study, West-Central <b>African</b> <b>lions</b> are {{more closely related to}} North <b>African</b> and Asian <b>lions</b> than to Southern or East <b>African</b> <b>lions.</b> These findings might be explained by a late Pleistocene extinction event of lions in western and central Africa, and a subsequent recolonisation of these parts from Asia.|$|R

5|$|Most lions {{now live}} in eastern and {{southern}} Africa, and their numbers there are rapidly decreasing, with an estimated 30–50% decline per 20 years in the late {{half of the twentieth}} century. Estimates of the <b>African</b> <b>lion</b> population range between 16,500 and 47,000 living in the wild in 2002–2004, down from early 1990s estimates that ranged as high as 100,000 and perhaps 400,000 in 1950. Primary causes of the decline include disease and human interference. Habitat loss and conflicts with humans are considered the most significant threats to the species. The remaining populations are often geographically isolated from one another, which can lead to inbreeding, and consequently, reduced genetic diversity. The lion population in the region of West Africa is isolated from those of Central Africa, with little or no exchange of breeding individuals. The number of mature individuals in West Africa is estimated by two separate recent surveys at 850–1,160 (2002/2004). There is disagreement over the size of the largest individual population in West Africa: the estimates range from 100 to 400 lions in Burkina Faso's Arly-Singou ecosystem. Another population in northwestern Africa is found in Waza National Park, where approximately 14–21 animals persist. Therefore, the lion is considered a vulnerable species by the International Union for Conservation of Nature, while the Asiatic subspecies is endangered. However, in contrast to the <b>African</b> <b>lion,</b> the Asiatic lion's number has risen over the years.|$|E
5|$|The lion (Panthera leo) {{is one of}} the big cats in the Felidae {{family and}} a member of genus Panthera. It has been listed as Vulnerable on the IUCN Red List since 1996, as populations in African range {{countries}} declined by about 43% since the early 1990s. Lion populations are untenable outside designated protected areas. Although the cause of the decline is not fully understood, habitat loss and conflicts with humans are the greatest causes of concern. The West <b>African</b> <b>lion</b> population is listed as Critically Endangered since 2016. The only lion population in Asia survives in and around India's Gir Forest National Park and is listed as Endangered since 1986.|$|E

Gorilla Rainforest, an exhibit opened in 2012, houses a troop of western lowland gorillas: a silverback male named Harry, two adult females named Lena and Mayani, and two young gorillas named Kituba (the son of Lena) and Kambiri (the daughter of Mayani), {{both of which were}} born in 2011. Other animals displayed in the African Plains area include common chimpanzees, African wild dogs, hippopotamus, sooty mangabeys, African spurred tortoises, Abyssinian ground hornbills, okapis and eastern bongo. The area also features an Africa-themed restaurant (named the Nakuru restaurant) and gift shop.

2500|$|The zoo {{attracted}} flak {{from the}} scientific community in general, because of cross breeding experiments between lions and tigers to produce strains like tigons, and litigons (see Panthera hybrid). The zoo bred two tigons in the 1970s – Rudrani (b. 1971) and Ranjini (b. 1973) were bred from the cross between a royal Bengal tiger and an <b>African</b> <b>lion.</b> Rudrani went on to produce 7 offsprings by mating with an Asiatic lion, producing [...] "litigon"s. One of these litigons, named Cubanacan survived to adulthood, stood over [...] tall, measured over [...] and weighed over 800 pounds. It died in 1991 {{at the age of}} 15. It was marketed by the zoo as the world's largest living big cat. All such hybrid males were sterile. Quite a few of these creatures suffered from genetic abnormalities and many died prematurely. Rangini, the last tigon in the zoo, died in 1999 as the oldest known tigon. The zoo has stopped breeding hybrids after the 1985 legislation passed by the Government of India banning breeding of panthera hybrids after a vigorous campaign by the World Wide Fund for Nature (then World Wildlife Fund).|$|E
