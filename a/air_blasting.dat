This process involves blasting acrylic, melamine or polyester microplastic scrubbers at machinery, engines and boat hulls to remove rust and paint. As these scrubbers are used repeatedly until they diminish in size and their cutting power is lost, they often become contaminated with heavy metals such as cadmium, chromium, and lead.|$|E

40|$|<b>Air</b> <b>blast,</b> {{a sudden}} mass {{movement}} of air, {{can occur in}} underground mining system where caving develops an extensive mass of unsupported rock spanning a large void. <b>Air</b> <b>blast</b> can result in injury to mine personnel, damage to equipment or disrupts mine operation. Evaluation of <b>air</b> <b>blast</b> parameters is, therefore, an essential part to develop strategies to mitigate the hazard. The properties of a muckpile or a caved zone are significant factors affecting the magnitude of <b>air</b> <b>blast</b> in particular on the undercut and extraction levels. This research investigates the effect of muckpile properties on air flow using the numerical code, PFC 2 D. The critical parameters such as thickness, block size and porosity (swell factor) of the muckpile have been studied to quantify how much they could change the magnitude of air pressures and velocities while the air flows through the muckpile. It {{was found that the}} porosity of the muckpile is the most effective parameter on the magnitude of <b>air</b> <b>blast</b> and by designing a thick layer of blasted rock with low porosity in the caved zone, the intensity of the <b>air</b> <b>blast</b> can be significantly reduced. The findings of this study can be used to design <b>air</b> <b>blast</b> plugs or bulkheads in order to isolate any potential <b>air</b> <b>blast</b> from the active workings, or to quantify the minimum thickness of the muckpile above extraction levels to manage <b>air</b> <b>blast</b> hazards...|$|R
2500|$|The Lowe {{process is}} {{performed}} {{in a series of}} three chambers, the generator, the carburettor and the superheater. [...] The original <b>air</b> <b>blast</b> is used to produce air gas in the generator. [...] The heat of primary combustion heats the coal sufficiently, while the air gas is burned by a second <b>air</b> <b>blast</b> in the other two chambers in which the oil for carburetting is decomposed. These chambers contain a quantity of loose fire brick called “checker work,” and the air gas is burned in them during the time the <b>air</b> <b>blast</b> is on the main producer. When the coal and checker work are hot enough, the <b>air</b> <b>blast</b> is shut off and the steam blast is turned on. Heat stored in the checker work pyrolyzes the mixture of water gas and oil, which is led through the chambers while the steam blast is on the producers. The Lowe process is endothermic, and cools the generator and checker work, so the process has to alternate between <b>air</b> <b>blast</b> for heating and steam blast for gas production.|$|R
50|$|Cleaning {{operations}} using {{abrasive blasting}} can present risks for workers' health and safety, specifically in portable <b>air</b> <b>blasting</b> or blast room (booth) applications. There {{is a large}} amount of dust created through abrasive blasting from the substrate and abrasive. Although many abrasives used in blasting rooms are not hazardous in themselves, (steel shot and grit, cast iron, aluminum oxide, garnet, plastic abrasive and glass bead), other abrasives (silica sand, copper slag, nickel slag, and staurolite) have varying degrees of hazard (typically free silica or heavy metals). However, in all cases their use can present serious danger to operators, such as burns due to projections (with skin or eye lesions), falls due to walking on round shot scattered on the ground, exposure to hazardous dusts, heat exhaustion, creation of an explosive atmosphere, and exposure to excessive noise. Blasting rooms and portable blaster's equipment have been adapted to these dangers. Blasting lead-based paint can fill the air with lead particles which can be harmful to the nervous system.|$|E

40|$|PURPOSE: This study {{evaluated}} whether <b>air</b> <b>blasting</b> or rinsing particle remnants {{with water}} would impair adhesion of resin composite to metal. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Commercially pure titanium plates (1 mm x 25 mm x 50 mm) were wet polished down to 1200 -grit silicone carbide abrasive and ultrasonically cleaned. They were then embedded in auto-polymerizing acrylic with the bonding surfaces exposed. Specimens {{were randomly assigned}} to one of the following particle deposition protocols (N = 60, n = 10 per group) : group 1 : particle deposition with aluminum trioxide (50 µm Al 2 O 3) (AL) + <b>air</b> <b>blasting</b> + silane (ESPE-Sil); group 2 : particle deposition with 30 µm SiO 2 (CoJet) (CSC) + <b>air</b> <b>blasting</b> + silane; group 3 : particle deposition with Rocatec Pre 110 µm Al 2 O 3 +Rocatec Plus 110 µm SiO 2 (LSC) + <b>air</b> <b>blasting</b> + silane. In groups 4 (AL-W), 5 (CSC-W) and 6 (LSC-W), the same protocols were used, but instead of <b>air</b> <b>blasting</b> only, particle-deposited specimen surfaces were rinsed with water and air blasted. Adhesive resin (VisioBond) was applied and resin composite (Quadrant Posterior, Cavex) was bonded using polyethylene molds and photopolymerized. The specimens were then submitted to thermocycling (6000 cycles, 5 °C- 55 °C, dwell time: 30 s, transfer time: 5 s). Pre-test failures during thermocycling were assigned a value of 0 MPa. Failure modes were identified using an optical microscope. SEM images of particles were obtained. Bond strength data (MPa) were statistically analyzed using two-way ANOVA and Tukey's post-hoc tests (a = 0. 05). RESULTS: Particle type significantly affected the bond results (p 0. 05). While AL groups showed exclusively adhesive failure between the resin composite and the substrate, the incidence of cohesive failures in the composite was more frequent in groups CSC and LSC after either <b>air</b> <b>blasting</b> or rinsing. SEM images of particles showed sharp morphology of the particles in AL compared to CSC and LSC. Conclusion: Rinsing and <b>air</b> <b>blasting</b> following particle deposition methods did not impair adhesion of resin composite to titanium. Particle deposition with silica particles provided better adhesion of resin composite to this substrate compared to the use of alumina particles...|$|E

40|$|An {{issue of}} {{improvement}} {{of the effectiveness of}} the operation of a block of hot blast stoves of the blast furnace in order to rise the temperature of the blast-furnace air was considered. It was shown that an increase of the temperature of the blast-furnace air without the use of natural gas and oxygen for combustion is possible due to the changing of the operation modes of a block of hot blast stoves and at the increase of the pressure of the exchange gas. An analysis of the recent researches and publications describing the methods for determining the parameters of the operation of the block of hot blast stoves of the blast furnace was performed; their advantages and disadvantages were described. The goal of the research was set. A database of process parameters of the block was processed to determine the main characteristics of the operation of hot blast stoves of the blast furnace. Averaged values of the basic technical and design parameters were obtained; they characterize the operation of each hot blast stove of the block with the use of which the adjustment of a mathematical model of the operation of each of hot blast stove of the block was achieved. A method for determining the main unit operating parameters on the block on the account of the desired blast temperature was designed. The values of the duration of the cycle "heating + air blasting" depending on the set-point temperature of the smoke at various values of <b>air</b> <b>blasting</b> temperatures were determined for each hot blast stove of the block using a mathematical model. The authors suggested to use such dependencies to determine the temporal parameters of the operation of the block of hot blast stoves. The obtained values of the duration of heating periods and <b>air</b> <b>blasting</b> of each hot blast stove of the block should be corrected if the continuity of the air blast supply to the blast furnace is not ensured. The examples of the use of this technique were given and the obtained results were described.

40|$|The {{scope of}} the project is two fold: (1) {{examining}} particle size effect on interfacial properties of CWS fuels by measuring static and dynamic surface tension properties of specially prepared CWS samples containing different ranges of coal particle sizes, and (2) studying the effect of particle size on CWS atomization characteristics by measuring mean diameters of several different CWS sprays generated by sonic <b>air</b> <b>blasting.</b> The results show that both static and dynamic surface tensions decrease with increasing coal particle size and mean droplet diameter of CW-S sprays also decreases with increasing coal particle size. Based on the experimental evidence we conjecture that three different energies are competing in slurry atomization: (1) the internal capillary holding between particles and water, (2) the interfacial surface tensile energy at the slurry surface contacting air, and (3) the external air blast shear energy acting against the former two energies. The internal capillary holding force decreases with increasing particle size. This force is believed {{to play a major}} role in determining the effect of particle size on CWS atomization...|$|E

Pseudomonas spp. appeared to be responsible for the development of sweet, fruity spoilage odors in haddock fillets coinciding with increasing response of the electronic nose CO sensor suggesting that alcohols, aldehydes and esters contributed to the spoilage odors. H 2 S-producing bacteria were associated with the H 2 S sensor’s response at abusive temperature conditions.

40|$|The {{effects of}} {{freezing}} temperature (- 80, - 40 or - 24 °C) and thawing mode (microwave or overnight at 4 °C) on quality parameters of mashed potatoes made from tubers (cv Kennebec) and from potato flakes were examined, {{as was the}} effect of long-term frozen storage {{on the quality of}} mashed potatoes. Mashed potatoes were tested for texture profile analysis (TPA) and cone penetration, oscillatory and steady rheometry, colour, dry matter, Brix and sensory analyses. In natural mashed potatoes, TPA hardness and oscillatory parameters showed that processing resulted in a softer product than the fresh control. The parameters were lower in the samples thawed at 4 °C than in those thawed by microwave at all the freezing temperatures used, which may be ascribed to gelatinisation of the starch released from damaged cells. Differences from the freshly prepared product decreased when the samples were frozen at - 80 °C and thawed by microwave. No difference was found in sensory acceptability between samples frozen at - 80 and - 40 °C, which probably reflects the panellists' mixed preferences for air-thawed versus microwave-thawed samples. Increasing the time in frozen storage led to a natural mash with a firmer texture, higher L*/b* value and Brix; nonetheless, panellists found the samples at 0, 3 and 12 months of frozen storage equally acceptable. In commercial mash, penetration and oscillatory parameters showed that processing made for a firmer product than the fresh control, probably owing to retrogradation of gelatinised starch. Thawing mode had a significant effect on parameters, which were lower in the samples thawed at 4 °C. The structure and quality of commercial mash was more detrimentally affected by freezing and, therefore, we would not recommend either freezing or frozen storage of this mashed potato in the used conditions. Natural mash made from Kennebec potatoes should be frozen quickly and thawed by microwave in the conditions described to obtain a product more similar to that freshly made.
