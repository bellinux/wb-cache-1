People {{do all kinds of}} things to get noticed in politics, but Ann wasn't there for anyone but Ann. She was someone who loved the movies, loved the tactile {{experience}} of being in the movie theater, loved talking about movies, loved meeting filmmakers– I think she was more excited to meet filmmakers than foreign dignitaries. At the Texas Film Hall of Fame, she was as much a celebrity at that event as anyone honored. People paid money to see her as much as anyone else there. She would often ride down to Austin on the New York plane with the celebrities being honored. One year it was with Ethan Hawke. All she wanted to talk about, at the pre-party, was that [...] "Ethan Hawke is so cute." [...] She loved him. This was not something that could be faked. She was starstruck. She loved these guys … (Watching a clip from Terrence Malick’s [...] "Days of Heaven" [...] at a Hall of Fame ceremony), she is mesmerized by this image. I mean, her eyes are glued to that screen. Again {{this is not something that}} you can fake. <b>And</b> <b>she</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> me and she said [...] "I love the movies" [...] with this childlike voice, this passion. Standing next to me at that moment was not the former governor, a political swordsman... she was like all the rest of us, just someone who loved the movies. It’s a terrible loss for Texas in so many ways, but for the cultural community to have an advocate in that position, you don’t have that but once a generation, if you’re lucky."– ...|$|E

60|$|<b>And</b> <b>she</b> <b>looks</b> <b>at</b> me so pitiful that I {{goes up to}} her {{and puts}} my arm round her and pats her on the back.|$|R
6000|$|... "I'm {{scared to}} death of her," [...] she admitted. [...] "She's so beautiful, <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>looks</b> <b>at</b> you always as though you were {{something}} a long way off." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "She has {{the same}} fluffy, light hair--hairpins can't keep it down, <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>looks</b> <b>at</b> you in that same sort of {{surprised}} way with her head on one side when you hand in your check." ...|$|R
60|$|A flush {{crept into}} the girl's face, <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> him reproachfully.|$|E

60|$|Her {{face turned}} quite white, her rosy lips parted, <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> me wildly with her {{beautiful}} dark eyes.|$|E

60|$|<b>She</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> {{the extra}} cup <b>and</b> plate. <b>She</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> the wing-chair. It was so empty.|$|R
60|$|Lucian reddened <b>and</b> hesitated. <b>She</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> him, mutely {{encouraging}} {{him to be}} generous.|$|R
60|$|He glanced doubtfully <b>at</b> Ann, <b>and</b> <b>she</b> was <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> {{him even}} fondly.|$|R
60|$|No {{one was in}} {{the room}} but Marian. She was reading, <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> her watch, in surprise, when I came in.|$|E
60|$|I {{looked at}} her, <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> me. Then I took the double-barrelled pistol {{out of my}} pocket and gave it to her.|$|E

60|$|He {{glanced up}} at her abrupt pause, <b>and</b> <b>she</b> was <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> the house.|$|R
60|$|It was {{a letter}} of two pages, <b>and</b> <b>she</b> {{immediately}} <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> the signature.|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{travel for}} pleasure--no?" [...] said Maria Valenzuela; <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> him as only Maria Valenzuela could look, her eyes warm with the promise.|$|E
60|$|The Frau Professor gave an exclamation, <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> her {{daughter}} in dismay. The thought which was in Anna's head had flashed across hers.|$|E

5000|$|Rose {{commented that}} Elena matured {{between the first}} game and the sequel: [...] "In the first game, she's a lot younger, she's a lot more naive, <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>looks</b> <b>at</b> things as being very possible, {{and in the second}} (game), has seen murders and adventure...the way that any person grows, you see that in her.
