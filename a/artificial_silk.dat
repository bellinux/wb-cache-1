5|$|Starting {{from the}} Long Depression (1873–1896), Lyonnais silk {{production}} had become totally industrialized, and hand looms were rapidly disappearing. The 19th century saw the textile industry's progress caused by advances in chemistry. The synthesis of aniline {{was used to}} make mauveine (aniline purple) dye and the synthesis of quinine was used to make indigo dye. In 1884 Count Hilaire de Chardonnet invented <b>artificial</b> <b>silk</b> and in 1891 opened a factory dedicated {{to the production of}} <b>artificial</b> <b>silk</b> (viscose), which cost much less and in part replaced natural silk.|$|E

25|$|In 1931, Ford hired chemists Robert Boyer and Frank Calvert {{to produce}} <b>artificial</b> <b>silk.</b> They {{succeeded in making}} a textile fiber of spun soy protein fibers, {{hardened}} or tanned in a formaldehyde bath, which was given the name Azlon. It was usable {{in the making of}} suits, felt hats, and overcoats. Though pilot production of Azlon reached 5000pounds per day in 1940, it never reached the commercial market; Dupont's nylon was the winner in the quest to produce <b>artificial</b> <b>silk.</b> In 1932–33, the Ford Motor Company spent approximately $1,250,000 on soybean research. By 1935, every Ford car had soy involved in its manufacture. For example, soybean oil was used to paint the automobiles, as well as fluid for shock absorbers. Ford's involvement with the soybean opened many doors for agriculture and industry to be linked more strongly than ever before.|$|E

40|$|Spider {{dragline}} (major ampullate) silk outperforms {{virtually all}} other natural and manmade materials {{in terms of}} tensile strength and toughness. For this reason, the mass-production of <b>artificial</b> spider <b>silks</b> through transgenic technologies {{has been a major}} goal of biomimetics research. Although all known arthropod silk proteins are extremely large (. 200 kiloDaltons), recombinant spider silks have been designed from short and incomplete cDNAs, the only available sequences. Here we describe the first full-length spider silk gene sequences and their flanking regions. These genes encode the MaSp 1 and MaSp 2 proteins that compose the black widow’s high-performance dragline silk. Each gene includes a single enormous exon (. 9000 base pairs) that translates into a highly repetitive polypeptide. Patterns of variation among sequence repeats at the amino acid and nucleotide levels indicate that the interaction of selection, intergenic recombination, and intragenic recombination governs the evolution of these highly unusual, modular proteins. Phylogenetic footprinting revealed putative regulatory elements in non-coding flanking sequences. Conservation of both upstream and downstream flanking sequences was especially striking between the two paralogous black widow major ampullate silk genes. Because these genes are co-expressed within the same silk gland, there may have been selection for similarity in regulatory regions. Our new data provide complete templates for synthesis of recombinant silk proteins that significantly improve the degree to which <b>artificial</b> <b>silks</b> mimic natural spider dragline fibers...|$|R

40|$|Spider silks are {{renowned for}} their {{excellent}} mechanical properties and biomimetic and industrial potentials. They are formed {{from the natural}} refolding of water-soluble fibroins with α-helical and random coil structures in silk glands into insoluble fibers with mainly β-structures. The structures of the fibroins at atomic resolution and silk formation mechanism remain largely unknown. Here, we report the 3 D structures of individual domains of a ≈ 366 -kDa eggcase silk protein that consists of 20 identical type 1 repetitive domains, one type 2 repetitive domain, and conserved nonrepetitive N- and C-terminal domains. The structures of the individual domains in solution were determined by using NMR techniques. The domain interactions were investigated by NMR and dynamic light-scattering techniques. The formation of micelles and macroscopic fibers from the domains was examined by electron microscopy. We find that either of the terminal domains covalently linked {{with at least one}} repetitive domain spontaneously forms micelle-like structures and can be further transformed into fibers at ≥ 37 °C and a protein concentration of > 0. 1 wt%. Our biophysical and biochemical experiments indicate that the less hydrophilic terminal domains initiate the assembly of the proteins and form the outer layer of the micelles whereas the more hydrophilic repetitive domains are embedded inside to ensure the formation of the micelle-like structures that are the essential intermediates in silk formation. Our results establish the roles of individual silk protein domains in fiber formation and provide the basis for designing miniature fibroins for producing <b>artificial</b> <b>silks...</b>|$|R

2500|$|Flintshire - A {{subsidiary}} of a German company, the British Glanzstoff Manufacturing Company started an <b>artificial</b> <b>silk</b> factory in Flint in 1907. During World War I the factory closed down but {{was taken over}} by Courtaulds in 1917. In 1913, the company had started making the synthetic fibre viscose rayon, made from cellulose derived from imported wood pulp or cotton waste. Courtaulds in September 1919 bought the old Muspratt Alkali factory in Flint from United Alkali Co Ltd and called it Castle Works, where after conversion they started production in 1922 of manufactured viscose rayon yarn. Courtaulds also in December 1927 bought the Holywell Textile Mill in Flint which they called Deeside Mill and after reconstruction and alterations was used for yarn processing. At its height Courtaulds employed over 10,000 people at four sites. At Greenfield, some [...] further down the Dee estuary, two additional large rayon production facilities existed from 1936 onwards, named Number 1 and Number 2. These mills employed over 3,000 people. Textile production declined from 1950, and Aber works shut initially in 1957, opened for rayon in 1966, and pulled down in 1984. Castle works closed in 1977 and Deeside Mill in 1989. The number 1 facility at Greenfield was mothballed in 1978, and the entire site was decommissioned in the mid 1980s.|$|E

25|$|Silk's {{absorbency}} {{makes it}} {{comfortable to wear}} in warm weather and while active. Its low conductivity keeps warm air close to the skin during cold weather. It is often used for clothing such as shirts, ties, blouses, formal dresses, high fashion clothes, lining, lingerie, pajamas, robes, dress suits, sun dresses and Eastern folk costumes. For practical use, silk is excellent as clothing that protects from many biting insects that would ordinarily pierce clothing, such as mosquitoes and horseflies. Silk's attractive lustre and drape makes it suitable for many furnishing applications. It is used for upholstery, wall coverings, window treatments (if blended with another fiber), rugs, bedding and wall hangings.

40|$|The {{development}} and research of {{new types of}} materials {{is one of the}} most important steps ensuring technological progress. However, the development of society leads to a change in the approach to {{development and}} to the requirements to put forward to new materials. Modern society needs materials that not only have better characteristics, but are also safe and environmentally friendly. Spider silk satisfies all these requirements. This Master`s thesis is devoted to the study of protein solutions, which can be used to create <b>artificial</b> spider <b>silk</b> fibers, which properties are close to the properties of natural spider silk fibers. The study was carried out by using Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy. A special measuring cell was developed for the study of protein solutions. The dependencies of impedance on concentration of proteins in the solution, time and temperature were obtained. Several theories about processes of adsorption and aggregation and their impact on the impedance of the system were created on the basis of these dependencies. In addition, an equivalent circuit was selected and a test fitting was performed...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{examines}} the dynamic mechanical properties of natural silk fibres, mainly from silkworm species Bombyx mori (B. mori) and spider species Nephila edulis, using dynamic mechanical thermal analysis, DMTA. The aim {{is not only}} to provide novel data on mechanical properties of silk, but also to relate these properties to the structure and morphology of silk. A systematic approach is adopted to evaluate the effect of the three principal factors of stress, temperature and hydration on the properties and structure of silk. The methods developed in this work are then used to examine commercially important aspects of the ‘quality’ of silk. I show that the dynamic storage modulus of silks increases with loading stress in the deformation through yield to failure, whereas the conventional engineering tensile modulus decreases significantly post-yield. Analyses of the effects of temperature and thermal history show a number of important effects: (1) the loss peak at - 60 °C is found to be associated the protein-water glass transition; (2) the increase in the dynamic storage modulus of native silks between temperature + 25 and 100 °C is due simply to water loss; (3) a number of discrete loss peaks from + 150 to + 220 °C are observed and attributed to the glass transition of different states of disordered structure with different intermolecular hydrogen bonding. Excess environmental humidity results in a lower effective glass transition temperature (Tg) for disordered silk fractions. Also, humidity-dynamic mechanical analysis on Nephila edulis spider dragline silks has shown that the glass transition induces a partial supercontraction, called Tg contraction. This new finding leads to the conclusion of two independent mechanisms for supercontraction in spider dragline silks. Study of three commercial B. mori cocoon silk grades and a variety of processed <b>silks</b> or <b>artificial</b> <b>silks</b> shows that lower grade and poorly processed silks display lower Tg values, and often have a greater loss tangent at Tg due to increased disorder. This suggests that processing contributes significantly to the differences in the structural order among natural or unnatural silks. More importantly, dynamic mechanical thermal analysis is proposed to be a potential tool for quality evaluation and control in silk production and processing. In summary, I demonstrate that DMTA is a valuable analytical tool for understanding the structure and properties of silk, and use a systematic approach to understand quantitatively the important mechanical properties of silk in terms of a generic structural framework in silk proteins.

Spider silk is biocompatible, strong and elastic, and hence an attractive biomaterial for applications in connective tissue repair. Recently, <b>artificial</b> spider <b>silk,</b> with mechanical and structural characteristics {{similar to those}} of native spider silk, has been produced from recombinant minispidroins. In the present study, supersaturated simulated body fluid was used to deposit calcium phosphate coatings on recombinant spider silk fibres. The mineralization process was followed in time using scanning electron microscopy equipped with an energy dispersive x-ray (EDX) detector and Raman spectroscope. Focused ion beam technology was used to produce a cross section of a coated fibre, which was further analysed by EDX. Preliminary in vitro experiments using a culture of bone marrow-derived human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) on coated fibres were also performed. This study showed that recombinant spider silk fibres were successfully coated with a homogeneous and thick crystalline calcium phosphate layer. In the course of the mineralization process from modified simulated body fluid, sodium chloride crystals were first deposited on the silk surface, followed by the deposition of a calcium phosphate layer. The coated silk fibres supported the attachment and growth of hMSCs...|$|R
40|$|Honeybee larvae produce silken cocoons {{that provide}} {{mechanical}} stability to the hive. The silk proteins {{are small and}} non-repetitive and therefore can be produced at large scale by fermentation in E. coli. The recombinant proteins can be fabricated into a range of forms; however the resultant material is soluble in water and requires a post production stabilizing treatment. In this study, we describe the structural and mechanical properties of sponges fabricated from <b>artificial</b> honeybee <b>silk</b> proteins that have been stabilized in aqueous methanol baths or by dry heating. Aqueous methanol treatment induces formation of ß-sheets, {{with the amount of}} ß-sheet dictated by methanol concentration. Formation of ß-sheets renders sponges insoluble in water and generates a reversibly compressible material. Dry heat treatments at 190 °C produce a water insoluble material, that is stiffer than the methanol treated equivalent but without significant secondary structural changes. Honeybee silk proteins are particularly high in Lys, Ser, Thr, Glu and Asp. The properties of the heat treated material are attributed to generation of lysinoalanine, amide (isopeptide) and/or ester covalent cross-links. The unique ability to stabilize material by controlling secondary structure rearrangement and covalent cross-linking allows us to design recombinant silk materials {{with a wide range of}} properties...|$|R

These {{mechanical properties}}, which {{are due to}} a combination of strength and extensibility, can be tailored to a large variety of uses, ranging from tissue regeneration matrices to bulletproofing.

To address these obstacles in a goat, new systems for creating transgenic goats are being used.
