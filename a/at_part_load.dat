40|$|Abstract: Experience {{with heat}} {{recovery}} steam generators (HRSGs) designed for larger-heat-input and higher-steam conditions highlights limitations in some features of traditional designs extrapo-lated from smaller HRSGs that operated predominantly continuously. Many combined-cycle units may {{be subjected to}} periods of regular overnight shut-down much earlier than expected and, unless anticipated during the initial design, there will be significant adverse impact on reliability and durability. Very premature problems already experienced on large HRSG designs in combined-cycle and cogeneration applications give an early warning that more widespread problems will arise as HRSGs are subjected to more thermal cycling.

40|$|AbstractBased on {{different}} sources a gas turbine model including a cooling {{model has been}} set up using the simulation software EBSILON® Professional. A gas turbine (GT) in simple cycle and a natural gas combined cycle (NGCC) including a triple pressure HRSG have been investigated and used as reference cycles. The NGCC has been modified to a semi-closed oxyfuel combined cycle (SCOC) with CO 2 capture. Results from the ENCAP project [1] have been used to evaluate the simulation results of this work. As a novel configuration a supercharged SCOC process (S-SCOC) has been presented. Both design-point and part-load simulations have been performed. In design-point the NGCC achieves a net efficiency of 56. 6 %. For the SCOC process the net efficiency is lowered by 8. 3 %-points due to the capture of CO 2. At part-load a sliding pressure (variable supercharge) has been introduced for the S-SCOC process. The sliding pressure for part-load leads to a constant volumetric flow rate through the GT over the whole load range. Therefore, the supercharged process yields a constant pressure ratio and a constant exhaust temperature <b>at</b> <b>part</b> <b>load.</b> Sliding pressure operation allows for a superior performance of the GT for the whole load range. The influence of a higher pressure of the exhaust gas stream on the heat transfer in the HRSG has been investigated. Fuel mass flow and flow conditions have been kept constant for the different processes. It has been found that the flow conditions for both processes (SCOC: constant density, volumetric flow rate changes; S-SCOC: vice versa) lead approximately to the same results for the Reynolds number on the flue gas side <b>at</b> <b>part</b> <b>load.</b> Although the conditions differ for the atmospheric SCOC process and the S-SCOC process with sliding pressure, the impact of part-load operation on the heat transfer is very similar. Since the efficiency of the supercharged GT hardly changes <b>at</b> <b>part</b> <b>load,</b> the net efficiency of the S-SCOC <b>at</b> <b>part</b> <b>load</b> remains very high.
