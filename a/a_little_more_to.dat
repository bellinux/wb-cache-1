5|$|That wasn't just a {{faith in}} {{herself and her}} talent, but also the ability to let herself go, to pray to God, and to trust in what would happen. These were, by far, her most inspiring words to date, letting others know {{that no matter what}} they were doing, no matter how {{difficult}} things were, with help they would win through. Musically, the piece had a restrained dance beat, very Mowtownish, that owed <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>more</b> <b>to</b> gospel, with a chorus - sung by Mariah, Trey and Patrique - that rose gloriously from the verse to repeat and drive and its very positive message home.|$|E
25|$|GreenLeft {{voters have}} an {{eccentric}} position in their preferences for particular policies. Between 1989 and 2003 {{they were the}} most leftwing voters in the Netherlands, often <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>more</b> <b>to</b> the left than voters of the SP. These voters are in favor of the redistribution of wealth, free choice for euthanasia, opening the borders for asylum seekers, the multicultural society and are firmly against building new nuclear plants.|$|E
25|$|Perhaps {{the most}} {{promising}} approach utilizes passive dynamics where the momentum of swinging limbs is used for greater efficiency. It {{has been shown that}} totally unpowered humanoid mechanisms can walk down a gentle slope, using only gravity to propel themselves. Using this technique, a robot need only supply a small amount of motor power to walk along a flat surface or <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>more</b> <b>to</b> walk up a hill. This technique promises to make walking robots at least ten times more efficient than ZMP walkers, like ASIMO.|$|E

The Marquis, as their coffee was brought, {{began to wonder}} dimly whether it was {{possible}} that the thread of their conversation was <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>more</b> difficult <b>to</b> hold together than in the past; whether that bridge between their interests and daily life became <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>more</b> difficult <b>to</b> traverse as the years passed.

25|$|Well-known {{streets in}} Rotterdam are the Lijnbaan (the {{first set of}} {{pedestrian}} streets of the country, opened in 1953), the Hoogstraat, the Coolsingel with the city hall, and the Weena, which runs from the Central Station to the Hofplein (square). A modern shopping venue is the Beurstraverse ("Stock Exchange Traverse"), better known by its informal name 'Koopgoot' ('Buying/Shopping Gutter', after its subterranean position), which crosses the Coolsingel below street level). The Kruiskade is a more upscale shopping street, with retailers like Michael Kors, 7 For All Mankind, Calvin Klein, Hugo Boss, Tommy Hilfiger and the Dutch well known men's clothier Oger. Another upscale shopping venue is a flagship store of department store De Bijenkorf.
