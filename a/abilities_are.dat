5|$|A feature new to {{the series}} {{involves}} Crash storing a Titan {{in his pocket and}} utilizing it when it is most advantageous. When Crash is riding a Titan, any Mojo collected goes to the Titan. If enough is collected, the Titan's <b>abilities</b> <b>are</b> upgraded rather than Crash's.|$|E
5|$|<b>Abilities</b> <b>are</b> {{classified}} into action and support categories. Action abilities consume magic points (MP) and include magic spells and special moves {{that are used}} in battle. Support abilities provide functions that remain in effect indefinitely and must be equipped with magic stones to be functional. The maximum number of these stones increases as the characters level up.|$|E
5|$|Locomotion <b>abilities</b> <b>are</b> best {{studied for}} Tyrannosaurus {{and there are}} two main issues {{concerning}} this: how well it could turn; and what its maximum straight-line speed was likely to have been.Tyrannosaurus may have been slow to turn, possibly taking one to two seconds to turn only 45°– an amount that humans, being vertically oriented and tail-less, can spin in a fraction of a second. The cause of the difficulty is rotational inertia, since much of Tyrannosaurus’ mass was some distance from its center of gravity, like a human carrying a heavy timber.|$|E
50|$|Seakeeping <b>ability</b> <b>is</b> {{a measure}} of how well-suited a {{watercraft}} is to conditions when underway. A ship or boat which has good seakeeping <b>ability</b> <b>is</b> said to be very seaworthy and is able to operate effectively even in high sea states.|$|R
50|$|The Sakurada City Administration Bureau task force's leader. His <b>ability</b> <b>is</b> to 'reset' a {{particular}} person or object {{to an earlier}} 'version' of them. His <b>ability</b> <b>is</b> similar to Haruki's Reset although it only affects objects he can make physical contact with.|$|R
5000|$|Meteorburn: Whenever {{the event}} stated occurs, the player {{may use the}} {{creature}}'s Meteorburn ability if the player destroys a card under the creature. This <b>ability</b> <b>is</b> common on creatures with the Phoenix race. A creature with the Meteorburn <b>ability</b> <b>is</b> Ultimate Galaxy Universe.|$|R
5|$|Neville Longbottom is a plump, diffident boy, so forgetful {{that his}} {{grandmother}} {{gives him a}} Remembrall, although he cannot remember why. Neville's magical <b>abilities</b> <b>are</b> weak and appeared {{just in time to}} save his life when he was eight. Despite his timidity, Neville will fight anyone after some encouragement or if he thinks it is right and important.|$|E
5|$|Special <b>abilities</b> <b>are</b> another {{important}} aspect of Chocobo Racing. Before each race, the player is prompted to assign a special ability to the selected character. During a race, the player can only activate the chosen special ability when the meter in the upper left-hand corner of the screen is full. After using the special ability, the player must wait for the meter to recharge to use it again.|$|E
5|$|Battles {{occur when}} the player {{character}} encounters an enemy while traversing the world. Combat takes place in real-time, and in the location the player found the enemy rather than a separate battle screen. The main character can equip a variety of weapons, armors, and accessories. Weapons let the player perform abilities in combat. Referred to as Special Techs, these <b>abilities</b> <b>are</b> powerful attacks by the main characters and support characters {{that can be used}} when the special move meter is full. This meter fills as the player damages enemies. Each weapon, such as a sword or spear, has a set number of special attacks to learn, which can hit single or multiple targets and can be assigned to different buttons on the controller.|$|E
30|$|The spatial {{extent of}} device {{operation}} OP is {{the union of}} the operation spatial extent for terminal t 1 and t 2, i.e., {(x 01,y 01),π×((r 1 +Δ r 1) 2 −r 12)}∪{(x 02,y 02),π×((r 2 +Δ r 2) 2 −r 22)}. The device operation <b>ability</b> <b>is</b> a piecewise function: in the intersection of two terminal’s operation space σ(r 1,r 2), the <b>ability</b> <b>is</b> (l 1 ×r 1 +l 2 ×r 2), i.e., the joint result of two terminals; in the terminal t 1 ’s operation space, the <b>ability</b> <b>is</b> l 1 ×r 1, i.e., the result of terminal t 1; and in the terminal t 2 ’s operation space, the <b>ability</b> <b>is</b> l 2 ×r 2, i.e., the result of terminal t 2.|$|R
5000|$|Most {{quantitative}} {{studies of}} {{winning and losing}} streaks, and the associated concept of psychological momentum, have failed to find any evidence that [...] "streaks" [...] actually exist, except {{as a matter of}} random chance. [...] A team with low <b>ability</b> <b>is</b> more likely to lose frequently, and a team with high <b>ability</b> <b>is</b> more likely to win, but once <b>ability</b> <b>is</b> controlled for, {{there is no evidence that}} a [...] "winning" [...] or [...] "losing" [...] streak affects the result of the match. [...] In fact, one study of European association football matches using a Monte Carlo methodology found that once <b>ability</b> <b>was</b> accounted for, a team was actually slightly less likely to win or lose when it had experienced the same result in the previous match.|$|R
5000|$|Kei and Haruki's classmate {{who survived}} an {{accident}} {{thanks to a}} Reset. She's interested in supernatural phenomena, thus she became happy {{when she found out}} that her <b>ability</b> <b>is</b> to turn into a [...] "Ghost" [...] {{for a period of time}} although the rules regarding her <b>ability</b> <b>are</b> undefined.|$|R
5|$|Inspired {{by their}} own daughters, Schooley and McCorkle {{conceived}} Kim as a teenage girl capable of doing anything, basing the character on their own childhood hero James Bond. Upon noticing the lack of strong female leads in children's animated television, they decided to reverse traditional gender roles by making Kim the show's action hero accompanied by a male comedic sidekick {{in the form of}} best friend-turned-boyfriend Ron Stoppable. Devoid of both superpowers and a secret identity unlike traditional superheroes, the character's crime-fighting <b>abilities</b> <b>are</b> instead drawn from her cheerleading experience, thus making her more relatable to young viewers. Originally designed as a bombshell based on video game character Lara Croft, Kim's appearance was ultimately altered to resemble a teenage girl instead.|$|E
5|$|Reach {{features}} updated {{versions of}} old weapons, plus new weapons fulfilling various combat roles. In Halo 3, players can carry single-use equipment power-ups that offer temporary offensive or defensive advantages. This system of single-use equipment is replaced in Reach by reusable and persistent armor abilities that remain with a character {{until they are}} replaced. The <b>abilities</b> <b>are</b> a jetpack; active camouflage; sprint; hologram, which creates a facsimile of the player running towards a target point; drop shield, which creates a bubble that heals those inside and protects them from {{a limited amount of}} damage; and armor lock, which immobilizes the player but grants invincibility for a brief period of time. When playing as Covenant Elites, players also have access to an evade armor ability.|$|E
5|$|The Game Boy Advance version shares basic {{elements}} with its console counterparts. Displayed from a side-scrolling view, the Prince navigates {{the palace of}} Azad using his acrobatic skills. The Rewind ability is still present to save the Prince's life, and is also involved in solving some puzzles and fighting bosses. New moves and <b>abilities</b> <b>are</b> gained by the Prince by performing moves and solving puzzles. Farah is featured as a second playable character in some sections, with switching between the two being key to some puzzles. The mobile version is similarly a side-scroller, featuring simple puzzles and traps. The powers linked to the Sands are absent, but enemies must still be killed by stabbing them with the Dagger. There are three enemy types: archers, flying enemies, and foot soldiers.|$|E
50|$|A {{person with}} this <b>ability</b> <b>is</b> called a Truthseer.|$|R
50|$|Aggregate line {{connection}} <b>ability</b> <b>was</b> limited by processing speed.|$|R
50|$|Lauren Sherwood's <b>abilities</b> <b>were</b> similar, but {{developed}} more rapidly.|$|R
5|$|The {{dead man}} is autopsied; his corpse had been dismembered and reconstructed. Michaels notes {{that this is}} a Seneca ritual aimed at {{reviving}} the dead to learn of spiritual matters. Later, Black and Michaels are called the construction site, where Powell is attempting to package and remove the ancient remains. Reynard and Powell begin fighting; the latter soon dies of a heart attack. When Black returns to his car, he finds a native face mask placed inside; Michaels explains that it represents the ability to cross from the material world into the spirit world. Black believes a secret native tribe is awaiting the downfall and apocalypse of the society of the white settlers; he theorizes that they believe his <b>abilities</b> <b>are</b> key to their prophecies {{of the end of the}} world.|$|E
5|$|The jaguar is a stalk-and-ambush {{rather than}} a chase predator. The cat will walk slowly down forest paths, {{listening}} for and stalking prey before rushing or ambushing. The jaguar attacks from cover and usually from a target's blind spot with a quick pounce; the species' ambushing <b>abilities</b> <b>are</b> considered nearly peerless in the animal kingdom by both indigenous people and field researchers, and are probably a product of its role as an apex predator in several different environments. The ambush may include leaping into water after prey, as a jaguar is quite capable of carrying a large kill while swimming; its strength is such that carcasses {{as large as a}} heifer can be hauled up a tree to avoid flood levels.|$|E
5|$|There are a {{total of}} five Monsters {{featured}} in Evolve. Similar to the Hunters, players need to inflict a certain amount of damage before unlocking a new Monster. The five different Monster-types also have different abilities, both offensive and defensive. Players control the Monster from a third-person perspective, and it features gameplay similar to an action game, unlike the Hunters. More <b>abilities</b> <b>are</b> given to a Monster after its evolution. Gameplay mechanics do not change much after the release of Stage 2, but monsters are made more powerful. They are given more health, stamina, armor, and skill points to unlock all abilities. Cooldown time abilities also shortened and recharge rate becomes significantly faster.|$|E
50|$|A master fortune-teller {{as popular}} for her beauty as her <b>abilities,</b> Lucia <b>is</b> sent by her mistress, Carla, {{with the party}} to train her <b>abilities.</b> She <b>is</b> short-sighted, flighty, and tends to speak without thinking. Her Tarot Cards <b>ability</b> <b>is</b> risky, while her Aroma Therapy is an {{incredibly}} versatile supportive ability.|$|R

5|$|Unlike in {{previous}} games, magical <b>abilities</b> <b>are</b> learned with {{the acquisition of}} a new weapon, giving each weapon its own magic attack; for example, the Army of Sparta may only be used with the Blades of Exile. Magic gives Kratos {{a variety of ways}} to attack and kill enemies, such as the Claws of Hades' Soul Summon ability, which conjures souls to attack enemies. Other magic includes the Nemean Cestus' Nemean Roar and the Nemesis Whip's Nemesis Rage. In addition to four primary weapons, three secondary ones, known as Items, are acquired: the Bow of Apollo, the Head of Helios, and the Boots of Hermes. All three are required to advance in certain stages of the game; for example, the Head of Helios {{can be used as a}} lantern in dark areas and to reveal hidden doorways.|$|E
5|$|A {{growing body}} of {{research}} suggests that self-control is akin to a muscle that can be strengthened through practice. In other words, self-control <b>abilities</b> <b>are</b> malleable, a fact that can be a source of hope for those who struggle with this skill. In psychotherapy, treatment for impulse-control issues often involves teaching individuals to realize the downsides of acting on immediate urges and in turn to practice delaying gratification. In anxiety disorders, this process occurs through exposure to a feared situation – which is very uncomfortable at first, but eventually becomes tolerable and even trains a person's mind and body that these situations are less threatening than originally feared. Exposure therapy is only effective if an individual can delay gratification and resist the urge to escape the situation early on. To shed insight on the tradeoff between short- and long-term gains, therapists might also help individuals construct a pro-con list of a certain behavior, with sections for short-term and long-term outcomes. For maladaptive coping behaviors such as self-injury, substance use or avoidance, there are generally no long-term pros. Meanwhile, abstinence from acting on a harmful urge (i.e., delayed gratification) generally results in long-term benefits. This realization can be a powerful impetus for change.|$|E
5|$|Both Germany and the United States have {{developed}} several other rounds. These include the German DM12 multi-purpose anti-tank projectile (MPAT), {{based on the}} technology in a high explosive anti-tank (HEAT) warhead. However, {{it has been found}} that the DM12's armor-killing <b>abilities</b> <b>are</b> limited by the lack of blast and fragmentation effects, and that the round is less valuable against lightly armored targets. The United States also has a MPAT type projectile, known as the M830. This was later developed into the M830A1, which allows the M1 Abrams to use the round against helicopters. The M1 Abrams can use the M1028 canister round, which is an anti-personnel/anti-helicopter munition, packed with over 1,000 tungsten balls. The United States Armed Forces accepted a new demolition round, called the M908 Obstacle Defeating Round, based on the M830A1 MPAT, but with the proximity fuse replaced by a hardened nose cap. The cap allows the round to impact and embed itself in concrete, then exploding inside the target and causing more damage.|$|E

5|$|Croc's {{maneuvering}} <b>abilities</b> <b>are</b> somewhat {{comparable to}} that of Mario's in Super Mario 64, with his primary methods of movement consisting of the abilities to run, jump, climb, and swim using either the analog stick or the D-pad, as well as touting the abilities to perform a sidestep and a 180-degree quick turn as other methods of maneuver. Croc's main method of attack consists of a full-circle tail swipe that is used to defeat enemies and bosses, as well as a hit drop move {{that can be used to}} break open crates containing collectibles. Croc's in-game health is represented by the crystals that the player collects throughout the game; when Croc is hurt by an enemy, all of his crystals are lost and scattered around him in several directions (similar to a mechanic commonly used in Sonic the Hedgehog). If Croc is hurt while he has no crystals, the player loses a life and is sent back to the beginning of the segment of the level they are currently in.|$|E
5|$|In {{completing}} missions, {{the player}} can have Talion engage in melee, ranged combat, and stealth approaches, with some missions rewarding the player more for completing the mission {{in a specific}} manner. Talion's ranger <b>abilities</b> <b>are</b> enhanced through Celebrimbor, allowing the player to mix combat with special focus-based attacks; these latter attacks {{can be used to}} slow time down while aiming with the bow, drain focus out of an enemy foe, or, later in the game, brand the foe to become an ally of Talion. The combat system uses an attack-chain system that enables the player to perform special moves after building the chain to a large enough value, such as instantly draining a foe of focus or performing an area focus attack. With the combat system, they can also counter and dodge attacks. Stealth is a critical element in some missions; several areas are considered Strongholds and should Talion's presence be discovered, an alarm will sound and more Uruks will arrive to try to kill him.|$|E
5|$|In the Shin Megami Tensei: Digital Devil Saga {{role-playing}} games, players {{take control}} of the characters Serph, Heat, Argilla, Gale and Cielo, with the characters Sera and Roland becoming playable in Digital Devil Saga 2. These characters are able to transform into a demon form, which is their main form in battle. Characters navigate to-scale environments, fighting enemies in both random encounters and story-focused boss battles. After each battle, experience points are awarded to characters. Character <b>abilities</b> <b>are</b> governed by Mantra Grids, a system where Mantras are bought using the in-game currency Macca, then mastering them using Atma Points gained from defeated enemies. The maximum number of abilities that a character can learn is eight. If two or more characters equip a certain ability, they can perform a stronger version of it through a combo. Each character can learn abilities from one of four categories: Physical, Magic, Shield and Auto.|$|E
25|$|Students' {{achievements}} {{and the quality}} of their learning are good, as was apparent from their written work, in lessons and from public examination results. No differences in attainment relative to <b>ability</b> <b>were</b> noted between different groups of pupils so that the progress over time made by those of all <b>abilities</b> <b>is</b> good.|$|R
40|$|We extend Philippe Aghion and Patrick Bolton's (1987) classic {{model to}} analyze the {{equilibrium}} incidence and impact of exclusive contracts in a setting where research and development (R&D) drives industry performance. An exclusive contract between an incumbent supplier and a buyer arises when patent protection and/or the incumbent's R&D <b>ability</b> <b>are</b> sufficiently pronounced. The exclusive contract generally reduces the entrant's R&D, and can reduce the incumbent's R&D. Exclusive contracts reduce welfare if the incumbent's R&D <b>ability</b> <b>is</b> sufficiently limited, but can increase welfare if patent protection and the incumbent's R&D <b>ability</b> <b>are</b> sufficiently pronounced.

50|$|In {{the first}} part of the book Herrnstein and Murray chart how American society was {{transformed}} in the 20th century. They argue that America evolved from a society where social origin largely determined one's social status to one where cognitive <b>ability</b> <b>is</b> the leading determinant of status. The growth in college attendance, a more efficient recruitment of cognitive ability, and the sorting of cognitive ability by selective colleges are identified as important drivers of this evolution. Increased occupational sorting by cognitive <b>ability</b> <b>is</b> discussed. The argument is made, based on published meta-analyses, that cognitive <b>ability</b> <b>is</b> the best predictor of worker productivity.|$|R
