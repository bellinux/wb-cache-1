5|$|Free-fed feral {{cats and}} house cats tend to consume many small meals {{in a single}} day, {{although}} the frequency and size of meals varies between individuals. Cats use two hunting strategies, either stalking prey actively, or waiting in <b>ambush</b> until an animal comes close enough to be captured. Although it is not certain, the strategy used may depend on the prey species in the area, with cats waiting in <b>ambush</b> outside burrows, but tending to actively stalk birds.|$|E
5|$|Mostly nocturnal, {{they rarely}} forage actively, preferring instead to <b>ambush</b> prey {{as it happens}} by. Their prey {{includes}} mammals, birds, amphibians, and lizards.|$|E
5|$|On 10 June a patrol—designated Operation Faun Fare—consisting of 7 Platoon, C Company under Lieutenant Robert Guest, {{accompanied}} the company commander Major Ivor Hodgkinson, the Intelligence Officer and a fire control party, {{left the company}} base at Serikin to mount an <b>ambush</b> on the Sungei Koemba river. The site of the <b>ambush</b> {{was to be a}} little further downstream from the successful action the previous month, being more towards the Indonesian positions at Siding. The Australian patrol occupied its intended <b>ambush</b> position early the next morning and proceeded to wait. During the day two boats occupied by civilians were observed and allowed to pass unhindered, as were three more the next morning.|$|E

5|$|The Buffalo Grove <b>ambush</b> was an <b>ambush</b> that {{occurred}} on May 19, 1832 {{as part of}} the Black Hawk War. A six-man detail carrying dispatches from United States Colonel James M.

William Durley was killed and buried near the site of the <b>ambush.</b> Durley's remains were initially interred by the party that would become victims of the St. Vrain massacre. Two other men had bullet holes in their clothing, but were uninjured. In 1910 the Polo Historical Society moved Durley's remains to a plot beneath a memorial they erected west of Polo, Illinois.|$|E

50|$|Because the {{training}} was located a three-day march {{from the nearest}} People's Army of Vietnam troops, a three-day curriculum was set up. On day one, three parachuted pre-packed loads were broken down and issued to recruits; they then learned to use rifles and light crew-served weapons. Day two saw the new soldiers learn the skills of <b>ambushing</b> the enemy; first they practiced setting squad-size <b>ambushes,</b> then moved up to using platoons. The third day covered squad, platoon, and company-size <b>ambushes,</b> as well as booby traps. The first two ADC companies in Momentum graduated on 20 January 1961. The following day, 20 of the graduates <b>ambushed</b> and killed 15 Lao communist soldiers. By the 22nd, both companies cut Route 4 20 kilometers south of Xieng Khouang.|$|R

5|$|The two armies clashed at Kalavrye on the Halmyros {{river in}} what is now European Turkey. Alexios Komnenos, whose army was {{considerably}} smaller and far less experienced, tried to <b>ambush</b> Bryennios's army. The <b>ambush</b> failed, and the wings of his own army were driven back by the rebels. Alexios barely managed to break through with his personal retinue, but succeeded in regrouping his scattered men. At the same time, and despite having seemingly won the battle, Bryennios's army fell into disorder after its own Pecheneg allies attacked its camp. Reinforced by Turkish mercenaries, Alexios lured the troops of Bryennios into another <b>ambush</b> through a feigned retreat. The rebel army broke and Bryennios was captured.|$|E

5|$|An <b>ambush</b> predator, the Pacific {{angelshark}} conceals {{itself on}} the sea floor and waits for approaching prey, primarily bony fishes and squid. Prey are targeted visually and, with a quick upward thrust of the head, snatched in protrusible jaws. Individual sharks actively choose ideal <b>ambush</b> sites, where they stay for several days {{before moving on to}} a new one. This species is more active at night than during the day, when it stays buried in sediment and seldom moves. Reproduction is ovoviviparous, with the embryos hatching inside the mother's uterus and being sustained by a yolk sac until birth. Females give birth to an average of six young every spring.|$|E
5|$|Establishing {{themselves}} {{along the}} Mersing–Jemaluang road, 'D' Company was deployed {{to the north}} {{on the western side}} of the road as the lookout force, while 'B' Company was positioned further to the south {{on the opposite side of}} the road. South of them, 'A' Company formed the blocking force, with their position stretched across the road oriented to the north. Behind them, 'C' Company was positioned in reserve, further south. The plan had been for the <b>ambush</b> to be sprung during the day, but the Japanese advance had proceeded more slowly than thought, and it was not until after dark that they entered the <b>ambush</b> site. In order to inflict as many casualties as possible, the Japanese force, which was estimated to be battalion-sized, was allowed to pass through 'D' and 'B' Companies. By 3:00am they came up against 'A' Company's blocking position and the <b>ambush</b> was finally initiated. Devastating indirect fire from artillery and mortars inflicted heavy casualties on the Japanese; however, as the northernmost company—'D'—turned south to attack the Japanese from the rear, they came up against determined resistance from a force of Japanese that had managed to infiltrate the <b>ambush</b> site and dig in on a small feature to the east of the estate's pig farm, north of 'B' Company. This effectively cut them off from the rest of the battalion.|$|E

5|$|Having {{restored}} his surviving {{forces to}} order, and {{aware of the}} confusion in Bryennios's forces, Alexios decided to counter-attack. The plan he laid out made far greater use of the particular skills of his Turkish horse-archers. He divided his force into three commands, of which two were left behind in <b>ambush.</b> The other, formed from the Immortals and the Chomatenoi under Alexios's own command, was not arrayed in one continuous line, but broken up in small groups, intermingled with other groups of Turkish horse-archers. This command would advance on the rebels, attack them, then feign retreat and draw them into the <b>ambush.</b>|$|E

Cortez soon voices his suspicion that Diaz might have organised the <b>ambush.</b> With the help of Lance Vance (Philip Michael Thomas), whose brother died in the <b>ambush,</b> Tommy kills Diaz; as a result, Tommy and Lance become Vice City's drug kingpins, allowing Tommy to create his own organisation and distance himself from the Forelli family. Tommy also works with the Cuban gang's leader Umberto Robina (Danny Trejo) in their fight against the Haitians. After destroying the Haitians' drug factory, Umberto becomes Tommy's partner in the drug trade. Tommy also earns the respect and friendship of Mitch Baker (Lee Majors), leader of a biker gang, whose bikers work alongside the Cubans to become protectors of Vercetti family business. Tommy also expands his empire by purchasing assets in nearly bankrupt companies and turning them back into competitive businesses.|$|E
