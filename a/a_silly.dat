5|$|Carly Beth Caldwell is a naive, timid and gullible 11-year-old {{girl who}} is afraid of pretty much everything. Thus, she is a {{constant}} target for pranks, jokes and tricks, most of them being inflicted on her by Steve Boswell and Chuck Greene at Walnut Avenue Middle School. In the opening chapter, Carly Beth and Sabrina discuss what costumes {{they are going to}} wear for Halloween, and Carly Beth is tricked by Steve into eating a sandwich containing a live worm. Horrified, Carly Beth flees and vows revenge. After school, she goes home and finds her mother has made her <b>a</b> <b>silly</b> duck costume for Halloween, and also a very realistic plaster of Paris model of Carly Beth's head. When she goes to her room, the duck costume seemingly comes alive and attacks Carly Beth. It turns out it is her younger brother, Noah, playing another trick on her. Sabrina calls, and they discuss the school science fair.|$|E
5|$|Toshack's {{performance}} in the First Test at Trent Bridge was a quiet one, taking a wicket in each innings. He was involved in an aggressive final wicket partnership of 32 with Johnston, scoring 19runs, his best at Test level to date in just 18minutes. Toshack's best Test performance was his 5/40 in the second innings of the Second Test at Lord's when Miller was unable to bowl after being injured, including the wickets of Cyril Washbrook, Bill Edrich, captain Yardley and Alec Coxon. During this performance, he employed two short legs and <b>a</b> <b>silly</b> mid-off. He had a moderately successful Third Test, taking figures of 3/101 in the only Test that Australia did not win. His knee injury flared again in the Fourth Test after taking an ineffective 1/112 in the first innings, {{he was unable to}} bowl in the second innings of an Australian win. He made a recovery and it was hoped that {{he would be able to}} play in the Fifth Test, but he injured again himself in the lead-up match against Lancashire. He was taken to London for cartilage surgery, ending his tour and his Test career. An inept batsman with an average of 5.78 in first-class fixtures, Toshack managed a Test average of 51 on the 1948 tour after being out only once, behind only Arthur Morris, Sid Barnes, Bradman and Neil Harvey. The unbeaten 20 he managed in the Lord's Test was his best first-class score, made in an uninhibited tenth-wicket stand with Johnston. Due to the fragility of his knee, Toshack was used sparingly in the tour games, playing in only 11 of the 29 non-Test matches on the tour. Toshack totalled 50 wickets at the average of 21.12 for the tour.|$|E

25|$|During {{the late}} 19th century Puerto Rico was {{to witness the}} {{introduction}} of organized team sports. The game of baseball was first introduced to the island {{by a group of}} Puerto Ricans and Cubans who had learned the game in the United States. At first the sport was not well received by the local press and general public, it was looked upon as <b>a</b> <b>silly</b> game. The first two baseball clubs were founded in 1897.

It obviously wasn't <b>a</b> <b>silly</b> mistake; nor was it a simple oversight. Nobody really had any comment on it—they just took one look and went away shaking their heads in wonder at the enormity of it. It was a 'classic smear'.|$|E

25|$|Before the 3rd Test against India in March 2013, {{the team}} {{management}} of Michael Clarke, {{who was also}} a selector at the time, and coach Mickey Arthur, dropped four players from the 3rd test, which included vice-captain Shane Watson, along with James Pattinson, Mitchell Johnson and Usman Khawaja for failing to make a presentation on team performance. Watson had subsequently flown back to Australia due to the birth of his first child. Michael Clarke and coach Mickey Arthur were severely criticized and ridiculed by the public, media and former players for such <b>a</b> <b>silly</b> decision. Watson returned to the team for the fourth and final test of the series, and captained the test side (due to an injury to Clarke) for the only time in his career. After the tour, Watson resigned as vice-captain, while Cricket Australia sacked Mickey Arthur as coach and stripped Michael Clarke as a selector in the following weeks.|$|E
25|$|Benaud {{was not a}} large spinner of the ball, but he {{was known}} for his ability to extract {{substantial}} bounce from the surface. In addition to his accurate probing consistency, he possessed a well-disguised googly and topspinner which tricked many batsmen and yielded him many wickets. In his later career, he added the flipper, a combination of the googly and top spinner which was passed to him by Bruce Dooland. Coupled with his subtle variations in flight and angle of the delivery, he kept the batsman under constant pressure. Benaud had the tendency to bowl around the wicket {{at a time when he}} was one of the first players to do so; it had an influence on spin bowlers like Shane Warne and Ashley Giles. Benaud was regarded as one of the finest close-fielders of his era, either at gully or in <b>a</b> <b>silly</b> position. As a batsman, he was tall and lithe, known for his hitting power, in particular his lofted driving ability from the front foot.|$|E

25|$|Ethel {{has several}} romances with senior bachelors on Albert Square. Her ex-boyfriend {{from the war}} years, Ernie Mears (Ken Wynne), returns to Albert Square in 1985 and proposes to her. However, the offer is conditional. Ernie is {{allergic}} to dogs and Willy, Ethel's constant companion for the past 9 years, would have to go. Ethel seriously considers Ernie's offer but gently declines. In 1988 she finds romance again {{with a friend of}} Dr. Legg's, Benny Bloom (Arnold Yarrow). Dot loathes Benny and does everything she can to talk Ethel out of dating him. Ethel and Benny discuss marriage, which Ethel agrees to, mainly to spite Dot, who calls her <b>a</b> <b>silly</b> fool for wanting to remarry at her time of life. However, after discovering pets aren't allowed in the manor where Benny lives, the engagement was called off, once again because of Willy. A few months later Ethel hears news that Benny has died and has left her £2000, although his daughter tries to contest the will for a while.|$|E
25|$|Before {{the meeting}} in Cologne, Papen and Hitler had been photographed going into Schröder's house {{and the next day}} 5 January 1933 the news of the Hitler-Papen summit was front-page news all over Germany. Schleicher did not regard the Papen-Hitler talks as a threat, {{regarding}} Papen as <b>a</b> <b>silly</b> and foolish man unable to accomplish anything. On 9 January 1933, Papen met with Hindenburg to tell him that he believed that Hitler was now willing to support a presidential government headed by himself. That same day, Papen met with Schleicher to tell him that he had only been seeking to have Hitler support his government at the Cologne meeting, and furthermore he had was not angry about being ousted by him or Schleicher's attacks on him in public. Based on what Papen had told him, Schleicher now believed Hitler was now only seeking to be the defense or interior minister in his government. To continue the talks which started in Cologne, it was decided that henceforth that Papen and Hitler would meet at the house of Joachim von Ribbentrop in Berlin as Ribbentrop was a Nazi who was also an old friend of Papen's going back to their service together in the Ottoman Empire in 1917-18.|$|E

500|$|In 1976, John Halverson {{argued that}} Leach's {{argument}} about taboos was [...] "specious", and his [...] "categorisation {{of animals in}} terms of 'social distance' and edibility is inconsistent in itself and corresponds neither to reality nor to the scheme of social distance and human sexuality it is claimed to parallel".
