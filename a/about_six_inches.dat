25|$|When Davenport was 14, she jointed the United States Tennis Association junior {{national}} team. She had a {{rapid growth}} spurt — <b>about</b> <b>six</b> <b>inches</b> {{in two years}} — which affected her coordination, but did not hinder her performance. She excelled at junior level competitions and swept the singles and doubles titles at the National Girls' 18s and Clay Court Championships in 1991 and won the Junior U.S. Open in '92.|$|E
25|$|Her {{outer garment}} {{was a bright}} colored plaid worsted cloak {{reaching}} to within <b>about</b> <b>six</b> <b>inches</b> of the floor. Its size was most voluminous, but its fashion was extremely simple. It had a wide yoke across the shoulders, into which the broad plain breadths were gathered; and it was fastened at the throat by a huge ornamented brass hook and eye, from which hung a short chain of round twisted links. Her right arm protruded through a vertical slit {{at the side of}} the cloak and she held in her hand a sheet of paper covered with figures. The left arm on which she carried a large basket or bag — I couldn't tell which — was hidden by the ample folds of the garment. Her countenance was keen and nervous, but benignant.|$|E
500|$|In {{reaction}} to this attempt, the Secret Service began keeping Ford at a more secure distance from anonymous crowds, a strategy that may have saved his life seventeen days later. As he left the St. Francis Hotel in downtown San Francisco, Sara Jane Moore, standing in a crowd of onlookers across the street, pointed her [...]38-caliber revolver at him. Moore fired a single round but missed because the sights were off. Just before she fired a second round, retired Marine Oliver Sipple grabbed at the gun and deflected her shot; the bullet struck a wall <b>about</b> <b>six</b> <b>inches</b> above {{and to the right}} of Ford's head, then ricocheted and hit a taxi driver, who was slightly wounded. Moore was later sentenced to life in prison. She was paroled on December 31, 2007, after serving 32 years.|$|E

500|$|From 2004 to 2007, {{the number}} of people {{confined}} in the Hole increased from 40 to up to 100. They slept in cots or sleeping bags, squeezed into every available floor space or on desktops. Men would sleep around the conference table while women slept in cubicles and small offices around the main conference room. They were so crowded that there was barely any room to move, according to one of those present: [...] "Everyone sleeping with only <b>about</b> <b>six</b> <b>inches</b> on either side. Above you. Below you. Getting {{up in the middle of}} the night, you'd disturb everyone." [...] They were only allowed to leave to attend Church events or to be taken to a shower in a nearby maintenance garage, to which they were taken two at a time under guard. Food was brought to them on golf carts from the Gold Base mess hall, as the executives were not allowed to eat with the rest of the staff, and they were only given ten to fifteen minutes to eat. According to one of the executives, the food was [...] "like leftovers, slop, bits of meat, soupy kind of leftovers thrown into a pot and cooked and barely edible." [...] The building was said to be infested with ants and on several occasions the electricity was turned off, causing the temperature inside to reach [...] due to the lack of air conditioning.|$|E

2500|$|British occultist Aleister Crowley {{reported}} witnessing what {{he referred}} to as [...] "globular electricity" [...] during a thunderstorm on Lake Pasquaney in New Hampshire in 1916. [...] He was sheltered in a small cottage when he [...] "noticed, with what I can only describe as calm amazement, that a dazzling globe of electric fire, apparently between six and twelve inches (15–30cm) in diameter, was stationary <b>about</b> <b>six</b> <b>inches</b> below {{and to the right}} of my right knee. As I looked at it, it exploded with a sharp report quite impossible to confuse with the continuous turmoil of the lightning, thunder and hail, or that of the lashed water and smashed wood which was creating a pandemonium outside the cottage. I felt a very slight shock {{in the middle of my}} right hand, which was closer to the globe than any other part of my body." ...|$|E

He was then about 64 and in excellent health...handsome and erect and <b>about</b> <b>six</b> feet, <b>six</b> <b>inches</b> tall. His eyes were merry, mischievous, and bright, and his clipped white moustache made one think of a colonel from Esquire, except {{that he was not}} at all heavy for his height." ...|$|R
50|$|Although he {{traveled}} {{in order to}} find subjects for his art, to visit exhibitions, and to meet with other artists, Menzel {{spent most of his life}} in Berlin, and was, despite numerous friendships, by his own admission detached from others. It is likely that he felt socially estranged for physical reasons alone—Menzel had a large head, and stood <b>about</b> four foot <b>six</b> <b>inches.</b>|$|R
2500|$|In a fully upright stance, {{the boxer}} stands with the legs shoulder-width apart and the rear foot a {{half-step}} {{in front of}} the lead man. Right-handed or orthodox boxers lead with the left foot and fist (for most penetration power). Both feet are parallel, and the right heel is off the ground. The lead (left) fist is held vertically <b>about</b> <b>six</b> <b>inches</b> {{in front of the}} face at eye level. The rear (right) fist is held beside the chin and the elbow tucked against the ribcage to protect the body. The chin is tucked into the chest to avoid punches to the jaw which commonly cause knock-outs and is often kept slightly off-center. Wrists are slightly bent to avoid damage when punching and the elbows are kept tucked in to protect the ribcage. Some boxers fight from a crouch, leaning forward and keeping their feet closer together. The stance described is considered the [...] "textbook" [...] stance and fighters are encouraged to change it around once it's been mastered as a base. Case in point, many fast fighters have their hands down and have almost exaggerated footwork, while brawlers or bully fighters tend to slowly stalk their opponents.|$|E
2500|$|The stripes {{are about}} four inches wide. The tent itself is {{about four feet}} wide by three feet deep, and inside {{headroom}} is well over six feet. A long white zipper runs up {{the middle of the}} front, while the back is open and contoured to fit the bus. The frame consists of four metal poles which fit into pockets inside the top of the tent and lock together to form a square. Legs on two of the poles fit into brackets which were bolted to the camper's roof. Two additional poles dogleg into the top frame and have small chain-hooks to hold the doors open. The lower ends of these poles fit into holes in the jack supports. Rubber grommets help protect the paint on the doors and the jack points. The lower edge of the tent is secured to the ground with about a dozen metal stakes. Each stake is <b>about</b> <b>six</b> <b>inches</b> long and is formed from hardened 1/4" [...] rods with a loop at one end. Two storage bags made of (usually matching) canvas with leather straps are supplied for the tent and poles.|$|E

25|$|A Buddhist priest {{ascribed}} the “wisdom of zen”, {{his life}} is consumed with an obsession over his nose, which dangles past his mouth at <b>about</b> five or <b>six</b> <b>inches.</b> He looks through the scriptures to find reference of others with his peculiar predicament, but achieves no success. When he finds a method to shorten his nose, he becomes flippant when people laugh at his vanity. Eventually, when his nose grows back, he rejoices in his condition.|$|R

50|$|Citrus medica var. sarcodactylis is, {{like any}} other citron variety, a shrub or small tree with long, {{irregular}} branches covered in thorns.

40|$|In {{this paper}} the authors report <b>about</b> the <b>six</b> <b>inch</b> wafer level vacuum {{packaging}} of electro-statically driven two dimensional micro-mirrors. The packaging {{was done by}} means of two types of wafer bonding methods: anodic and glass frit. The resulting chips after dicing are 4 mm wide, 6 mm long and 1. 6 mm high and the residual pressure inside the package after dicing {{was estimated to be}} between 2 and 20 mbar. This allowed us to reduce the driving voltage of the micro-mirrors by more than 40 % compared to the driving voltage without vacuum packaging. The vacuum stability after 5 months was verified by measurement using the so called "membrane method". Persistence of the vacuum was proven. No getter materials were used for packaging...|$|R
