5|$|The red-billed chough breeds {{from three}} years of age, and {{normally}} raises only one brood a year, although the <b>age</b> <b>at</b> <b>first</b> breeding is greater in large populations. A pair exhibits strong mate and site fidelity once a bond is established. The bulky nest is composed of roots and stems of heather, furze or other plants, and is lined with wool or hair; in central Asia, the hair may be taken from live Himalayan tahr. The nest is constructed in a cave or similar fissure in a crag or cliff face. In soft sandstone, the birds themselves excavate holes nearly a metre deep. Old buildings may be used, and in Tibet working monasteries provide sites, as occasionally do modern buildings in Mongolian towns, including Ulaanbaatar. The red-billed chough will utilise other artificial sites, such as quarries and mineshafts for nesting where they are available.|$|E

25|$|The {{spawning}} stock of North-East Arctic cod {{was more than}} a million tons following World War II, but declined to a historic minimum of 118,000 tons in 1987.

Since 2000, the {{spawning stock}} has increased quite quickly, helped by low fishing pressure. However, there are worries about a decreased <b>age</b> <b>at</b> <b>first</b> spawning (often an early sign of stock collapse), combined with the level of discards and unreported catches.

25|$|Other {{risk factors}} that {{influence}} the development of alcohol abuse or alcoholism include social and genetic factors. Several {{researchers have found that}} starting drinking before the age of 15 is associated with a fourfold increased risk for developing alcoholism compared to people that delay drinking until age 20 or later. It has been estimated by some that if the age at which people started drinking could be delayed to age 20, there would be a 50 percent {{reduction in the number of}} cases of alcohol use disorder. However, it is unclear whether this is a causal relationship, or a function of confounding familial (and other) factors associated with both <b>age</b> <b>at</b> <b>first</b> drink and propensity for alcoholism.|$|E
25|$|The {{phenomenon}} of lowest-low fertility, defined as total fertility below 1.3, is emerging throughout Europe and is attributed {{by many to}} postponement of the initiation of childbearing. Ukraine, where total fertility (a very low 1.1 in 2001), {{was one of the}} world's lowest, shows that {{there is more than one}} pathway to lowest-low fertility. Although Ukraine has undergone immense political and economic transformations during 1991–2004, it has maintained a young <b>age</b> <b>at</b> <b>first</b> birth and nearly universal childbearing. Analysis of official national statistics and the Ukrainian Reproductive Health Survey show that fertility declined to very low levels without a transition to a later pattern of childbearing. Findings from focus group interviews suggest explanations of the early fertility pattern. These findings include the persistence of traditional norms for childbearing and the roles of men and women, concerns about medical complications and infertility at a later age, and the link between early fertility and early marriage.|$|E

25|$|Risk {{factors for}} {{developing}} breast cancer include being female, obesity, lack of physical exercise, drinking alcohol, {{hormone replacement therapy}} during menopause, ionizing radiation, early <b>age</b> <b>at</b> <b>first</b> menstruation, having children late or not at all, older age, and family history. About 5–10% of cases are due to genes inherited from a person's parents, including BRCA1 and BRCA2 among others. Breast cancer most commonly develops in cells from the lining of milk ducts and the lobules that supply the ducts with milk. Cancers developing from the ducts are known as ductal carcinomas, while those developing from lobules are known as lobular carcinomas. In addition, {{there are more than}} 18 other sub-types of breast cancer. Some cancers, such as ductal carcinoma in situ, develop from pre-invasive lesions. The diagnosis of breast cancer is confirmed by taking a biopsy of the concerning lump. Once the diagnosis is made, further tests are done to determine if the cancer has spread beyond the breast and which treatments it may respond to.|$|E
25|$|Several mid-level {{evolutionary}} theories inform evolutionary psychology. The r/K selection theory {{proposes that}} some species prosper by having many offspring, while others follow {{the strategy of}} having fewer offspring but investing much more in each one. Humans follow the second strategy. Parental investment theory explains how parents invest {{more or less in}} individual offspring based on how successful those offspring are likely to be, and thus how much they might improve the parents' inclusive fitness. According to the Trivers-Willard hypothesis, parents in good conditions tend to invest more in sons (who are best {{able to take advantage of}} good conditions), while parents in poor conditions tend to invest more in daughters (who are best able to have successful offspring even in poor conditions). According to life history theory, animals evolve life histories to match their environments, determining details such as <b>age</b> <b>at</b> <b>first</b> reproduction and number of offspring. Dual inheritance theory posits that genes and human culture have interacted, with genes affecting the development of culture, and culture, in turn, affecting human evolution on a genetic level (see also the Baldwin effect).|$|E
25|$|Hormonal {{contraceptives}} {{may produce}} {{a slight increase}} in {{the risk of breast cancer}} diagnosis among current and recent users, but this appears to be a short-term effect. In 1996 the largest collaborative reanalysis of individual data on over 150,000 women in 54 studies of breast cancer found a relative risk (RR) of 1.24 of breast cancer diagnosis among current combined oral contraceptive pill users; 10 or more years after stopping, no difference was seen. Further, the cancers diagnosed in women who had ever used hormonal contraceptives were less advanced than those in nonusers, raising the possibility that the small excess among users was due to increased detection. The relative risk of breast cancer diagnosis associated with current and recent use of hormonal contraceptives did not appear to vary with family history of breast cancer. Some studies have suggested that women who began using hormonal contraceptives before the age of 20 or before their first full-term pregnancy are at increased risk for breast cancer, but it is not clear how much of the risk stems from early <b>age</b> <b>at</b> <b>first</b> use, and how much stems from use before the first full-term pregnancy.|$|E
6000|$|Solution.--Let the <b>ages</b> <b>at</b> <b>first</b> be x, y, (x + y). Now, if a + b = 2c, then (a-n) + (b-n) = 2(c-n), {{whatever}} be {{the value}} of n. Hence the second relationship, if ever true, was always true. Hence it was true <b>at</b> <b>first.</b> But it cannot be true that x and y are together double of (x + y). Hence it must be true of (x + y), together with x or y; {{and it does not}} matter which we take. We assume, then, (x + y) + x = 2y; i.e. y = 2x. Hence the three <b>ages</b> were, <b>at</b> <b>first,</b> x, 2x, 3x; and the number of years, since that time is two-thirds of 6x, i.e. is 4x. Hence the present ages are 5x, 6x, 7x.

25|$|Plácido Domingo {{was born}} on January 21, 1941 in the Retiro {{district}} of Madrid, Spain. His mother recalled {{that she and her}} husband knew he would be a musician from the age of five, due to his ability to hum complex music from a zarzuela after seeing a performance of it. In 1949, just days before his eighth birthday, he moved to Mexico with his family. His parents, both singers, had decided to start a zarzuela company there after a successful tour of Latin America. Soon after arriving in Mexico, Domingo won a singing contest for boys, and his parents occasionally recruited him and his sister for children's roles in their zarzuela productions. Domingo studied piano from a young <b>age,</b> <b>at</b> <b>first</b> privately and later at the National Conservatory of Music in Mexico City, which he entered when he was fourteen. At the conservatory, he also attended conducting classes taught by Igor Markevitch and studied voice under Carlo Morelli, the brother of Renato Zanelli.

Domingo's conservatory classes constituted the entirety of his formal vocal instruction; he never studied privately with a singing teacher.|$|E
