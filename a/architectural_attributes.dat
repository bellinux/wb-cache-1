40|$|We {{present a}} novel {{approach}} {{to the analysis of}} the reliability of a component-based system that takes into account an important <b>architectural</b> <b>attribute,</b> namely the error propagation probability. This is the probability that an error, arising somewhere in the system, propagates to other components, possibly up to the system output. As we show in the paper, this attribute may heavily affect decisions on crucial architectural choices. Nonetheless, it is often neglected in modeling the reliability of component-based systems. Our modeling approach provides a useful support to the reliability engineering of component-based systems, since {{it can be used to}} drive several significant tasks, such as: (i) placing error detection and recovery mechanisms, (ii) focusing the design, implementation and selection efforts on critical components, (iii) devising cost-effective testing strategies. We illustrate the approach on an ATM example system...|$|R

50|$|The Emperor Shomu who had {{the temple}} {{originally}} built was a practitioner of Buddhism.

The original temple was rebuilt in 1602 so there is no real documentation on what it actually looked like. However, the rebuilt Hogon-ji Temple strongly resembles the common <b>architectural</b> <b>attributes</b> of a Buddhist Amida Hall. Amida Halls, however, did not reportedly start being built until around 1051 C.E. It is therefore apparent that the style of architecture changed with the reconstruction.|$|E
50|$|IBM FlashSystem {{products}} {{are based on}} a custom hardware architecture that incorporates field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs). The FlashSystem design omits traditional server-based array controllers. The primary components of each FlashSystem unit include custom flash modules, external storage area network interfaces, and FPGA logic that spreads data through the system. Each flash module within a FlashSystem incorporates enterprise multi-level cell or single-level cell flash chips and FPGAs that provide IBM Variable Stripe RAID data protection as well as standard flash memory controller functions. IBM claims that these <b>architectural</b> <b>attributes</b> provide strong performance, reliability, and efficiency. In August 2013, IBM submitted a single FlashSystem 820 SPC-1 benchmark result to the Storage Performance Council that showed fast response time (SPC-1 LRT) and high SPC-1 IOPS per external storage port - common measures of high storage performance - as well as low power consumption.|$|E

40|$|From {{the point}} of view of developers, there is the belief that {{location}} determines the main characteristics of real estate projects. On the contrary, the bid rent theory proposes that land receives value from that which it supports, as expressed by means of <b>architectural</b> <b>attributes.</b> In light of two case studies in Santiago, Chile, the relationship between land value and real estate value was studied with the aim of identifying the meaning of this causality and the role of sustainability characteristics – as an expression of emergent <b>architectural</b> <b>attributes</b> – in price formation. It was observed that the interaction between land value and architectural characteristics generates property price through circular causality, where there is a certain typology for each location that can produce submarkets. In this sense, sustainability attributes effectively influence the creation of value – but not linearly – which clearly suggests the presence of housing submarkets according to price level, and a new element in the relationship between land and <b>architectural</b> <b>attributes.</b> Postprint (published version...|$|E

A comprehensive architectural analysis was then conducted of seven key <b>architectural</b> <b>attributes</b> of the five selected gliders. The architectural analysis compared various implementations of the key <b>architectural</b> <b>attributes</b> relative to desirable traits and capabilities for a notional U. S. Navy glider.

The conclusion is clear; there is a strong need to adopt the concept of architecture to overcome problems in current system development and to exploit the potential in architecture based development in order to better manage the design of complex systems. To clarify and define the scope of this concept, a definition of the term “system architecture ” is elaborated.
