500|$|Since I Left You was {{originally}} developed to be a concept album. Chater described its initial theme as a love story, [...] "an international search for love {{from country to}} country. The idea of a guy following a girl {{around the world and}} always being one port behind. <b>And</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> because we had all these records from all over the world, and we'd like to use all that stuff." [...] The concept album idea was abandoned when the group felt they should not make their themes too obvious. The album's sound was in response to dance music at that time, that Chater felt was [...] "about big drums, big production: think of a record like the Chemical Brothers [...] "Block Rockin' Beats", with those amazing drums, and how huge those records sounded". The Avalanches felt their early music could not compare to that sound and desired a recording with less bass that was influenced by 1960s music such as the Beach Boys and Phil Spector.|$|E
2500|$|To the students’ surprise, the {{government}} {{released a statement}} on February 13 [...] announcing {{that it would not}} allow the students to enter Yangon and that it would take measures to restore stability if the students did not halt their march. The students immediately held a meeting that evening to decide whether they should continue. The day before on February 12, the students sent a delegate to meet with Aung San Su Kyi who then told the students that {{it would be impossible to}} achieve all their demands <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> the nature of democracy.|$|E
2500|$|The decade also {{contained}} great individual achievements as well. On April 8, 1974, Hank Aaron of the Atlanta Braves hit his 715th career home run, surpassing Babe Ruth's all-time record. He would retire in 1976 with 755 <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> one of numerous records he achieved, many of which, including Total bases scored, still stand today. There was great pitching too: between 1973 and 1975, Nolan Ryan threw 4 [...] "no-hit" [...] games. He would add a record-breaking fifth in 1981 {{and two more}} before his retirement in 1993, by which time he had also accumulated 5,714 strikeouts, another record, in a 27-year career.|$|E
50|$|Critics {{argue that}} conceptualist {{approaches}} only answer the psychological question of universals. If the same concept is correctly and non-arbitrarily applied to two individuals, {{there must be}} some resemblance or shared property between the two individuals that justifies their falling under the same concept <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>just</b> the metaphysical problem <b>that</b> universals <b>were</b> brought in to address, the starting-point of the whole problem (MacLeod & Rubenstein, 2006, §3d). If resemblances between individuals are asserted, conceptualism becomes moderate realism; if they are denied, it collapses into nominalism.|$|R
3000|$|... access: {{represents}} two particular {{types of}} relations: accesses to fields or method calls. Thus, access {{is a particular}} case of a depend relation. For example, an object may hold a reference to an object in another domain (depend), {{but it may not}} use its services (access). A typical example is an object received as argument in a Facade method <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>just</b> passed to another method behind the Facade (i.e. the Facade does not call any method or access any field from this object).|$|R

2500|$|In 2010, Linehan {{discussed}} the dramatic effect this choice {{had on the}} tone of the series: [...] "'Woman of the World' was kind of like a jaunty, plinky-plonky song, and we wanted that song. He [...] gave us two choices: he gave us that, and [...] "Songs of Love", and we wanted the plinky-plonky song because our idea was we were making fun of sitcoms. We were saying, you know, we don't like sitcoms. This is a parody of sitcoms. This is a kind of satire on sitcoms. And I remember Geoffrey [...] looking really glum and sad about this, you know? And then he said, 'Why do you want to make fun of your characters?' He said, 'People will love these characters.' <b>And</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> a real revelation for me, and after that, whatever he said went, as far as I was concerned." ...|$|E
2500|$|Developers updated their {{engine to}} allow for 150 units {{to be on the}} {{battlefield}} at one time. The game is powered by an upgraded version of Pandemic Studios' Zero engine, and was developed by the same team that worked on the first two [...] installments. Conquest director Eric Gewirtz said the team was [...] "throwing around these ideas, and in perfect serendipity, happened to get access to the Lord of the Rings license, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> the center for us on making this game." [...] Howard Shore's music, composed for the film trilogy, was used in the game. The film actors reprise their roles in cutscenes, which are archived footage from the film. In-game likenesses are based on their film counterparts. Hugo Weaving reprises his role as Elrond and serves as the game's narrator. All other cast members were replaced by voice doubles. Chris Edgerly voices Aragorn, Crispin Freeman voices Legolas, Martin Jarvis voices the white wizard Gandalf, and Yuri Lowenthal stands in for Elijah Wood as Frodo Baggins.|$|E

25|$|Though not {{linked to}} flying saucers or odd aerial lights, {{it is perhaps}} worth noting <b>that</b> there <b>is</b> {{a long history of}} claims of contact with non-earthly intelligences. The {{founding}} revelations of many of the world's religions involve contact between the founder and a supernatural source of wisdom, such as a god in human form or an angel. In this context, it might <b>be</b> expected <b>that</b> most of the 1950s contactees would form their own religions, with the contactee as sole spiritual leader, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>just</b> what happened, almost invariably.|$|R

6000|$|... "That's {{just what}} he did!" [...] cried the youth who had been struck down. [...] "I {{remember}} now!

60|$|Louisa said nothing: the blank, hopeless {{disappointment}} following on {{the excitement}} of the past two hours was exceedingly difficult to bear. The ruling passion--strong {{even in the midst of}} despair--the pride that was in her, alone kept her from an utter breakdown. She was grateful to her uncle, who very tactfully interposed his tall figure between her and the indifferent eyes of the doctor. Mr. Warren looked more sympathetic than ever, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> as trying to bear as the pompousness of Doctor Newington.|$|E
3000|$|Last but not least: the {{practice}} of writing dissertations and habilitation research is rapidly shifting from the traditional monograph-type, book-length piece of research to “cumulative” dissertations and habilitation volumes, where three, four, or more refereed journal publications are bound together. Some estimates that I have—just from the German “demand” for A and B journal publications—suggest {{that in the next}} few years an additional 40 to 60 aspiring Ph.D. students in the field of logistics and supply chain management will want to place their three or more papers in A and B journals per annum to substitute what used to <b>be</b> monograph dissertations. <b>And</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>just</b> Germany, accounting for less than a quarter of the European logistics community!

60|$|My indignation ebbed away, {{and into}} my being rushed the tides of fear. I saw at last, clear-eyed, what I was up against. I grew meek and lowly. Each day I {{resolved}} more emphatically to make no rumpus when I got out. All I asked, when I got out, {{was a chance to}} fade away from the landscape. <b>And</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> what I did do when I was released. I kept my tongue between my teeth, walked softly, and sneaked for Pennsylvania, a wiser and a humbler man.|$|E
6000|$|That terrible unspoken truth, long known, {{but never}} confessed, even to himself, struck {{like a knife}} on Ernest's heart. He raised his hat blindly, and walked with {{unsteady}} {{steps out of the}} sick-room. At that moment, his own conscience smote him with awful vividness. Looking into the inmost recesses of his angry heart, he felt with a shudder that Harold had spoken the simple truth, and he dared not lie by contradicting him. In Harold's place he would have done exactly as Harold did! <b>And</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> what made his deathless anger burn all the more fiercely and fervidly against his brother! ...|$|E
60|$|One of the {{earliest}} marks of these dégringolades is, that the victim begins to disappear from the New Town thoroughfares, and takes to the High Street, like a wounded animal to the woods. And such an one {{is the type of}} the quarter. It also has fallen socially. A scutcheon over the door somewhat jars in sentiment where there is a washing at every window. The old man, when I saw him last, wore the coat in which he had played the gentleman three years before; <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> what gave him so pre-eminent an air of wretchedness.|$|E

You see, he couldn't look Old Mother Nature in the face and tell a lie, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> what he had been trying to do.

6000|$|... "Then I {{asked what}} he was doing here, and the man {{answered}} that I had best put that question to the Holy Father and to the Queen of Spain. Lastly, after I had given the soldier another cup, I asked where the don lived, and whether he had any other name. He replied that he lived at Granada for the most part, and that if I called on him there I should see some pretty ladies and other nice things. As for his name, it was the Marquis of Nichel. I said that meant Marquis of Nothing, whereon the soldier answered that I seemed very curious, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> what he meant to tell me--nothing. Also he called to his comrades that he believed I was a spy, so I thought it time to be going, as they were drunk enough to do me a mischief." ...|$|E
6000|$|Presently after came Captain Coles, whom we had {{not seen}} since the short visit when we had idolised the big {{overgrown}} midshipman, whom Clarence exhibited to our respectful and distant admiration nearly twenty years ago. My mother used to call him a gentlemanly lad, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> what he was still, with a singularly soft gentle manner, gallant officer and post-captain as he was. He cheered me much, for he made no doubt of Clarence's ultimate recovery, and he added that he had found the dear fellow so valued and valuable, so useful in all good works, and so much respected by all the English residents, 'that really,' said the captain, 'I did not know whether to deplore that the service should have lost such a man, or whether to think it had been a good thing for him, though not for us, that-- that he got into such a scrape.' ...|$|E
3000|$|Anne: “When I’m have {{having trouble}} with [content] it’s like ‘It’s {{probably}} because I'm stupid and don't understand.’ But then [talking with other students helps me realize] ‘OK, everyone else is struggling with the same concept.’ Or, ‘Someone else has the same question.’ So I think it probably helps with more dense concepts <b>and</b> subjects <b>that</b> <b>are</b> <b>just</b> complicated.

40|$|Sociology has a Trump problem. And a Brexit problem. And a Populism problem. And a {{white people}} problem, and a class problem, {{and a man}} problem. What does this mean? Confusion is {{expected}} because, unfortunately, sociology has these problems in numerous ways. For example, sociology has a real Trump and Brexit problem in the straightforward sense <b>that</b> it <b>is</b> institutionally dependent on higher education and research funding which are directly threatened by Trump’s election and Britain’s secession from the EU. It has a populism problem {{in the sense that}} populism’s assertion of popular authority against elites, including elite “experts”, sanctioned to speak by their sheepskin credentials, moves sociologists from being observers of society to an interested position in political struggle and even a political adversary for many of the people we might want to study. It has a white, privileged, male problem because too many elite academics are white privileged males <b>and</b> the effect <b>is</b> <b>that</b> their distinct dispositions and views become normalized while others <b>are</b> reduced curiosities. <b>And</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>just</b> to name a few of the dimensions to these problems.

6000|$|Many {{of these}} men had served their country well with that {{strength}} and courage which brought them fame. Cribb was, if I mistake not, in the Royal Navy. So was the terrible dwarf Scroggins, all chest and shoulders, whose springing hits for many a year carried all before them until the canny Welshman, Ned Turner, stopped his career, only to be stopped in turn by the brilliant Irishman, Jack Randall. Shaw, who stood high among the heavy-weights, was cut to pieces by the French Cuirassiers in the first charge at Waterloo. The brutal Berks died greatly in the breach of Badajos.

She was living there in that way to save money for me, to keep me here. She wanted me to have just as good a chance as any of the rest of you. This room, the clothes I have on, my trinkets, everything came from her, and now there's no telling what may happen to her. That article threatens all kinds of persecution.

60|$|Mark {{questioned}} {{these two}} friends concerning the contemplated movement of Waally, with great minuteness, Unus was intelligent for a savage, {{and appeared to}} understand himself perfectly. He was of opinion that his countrymen would endeavour to cross, the first calm day, or the first day when the breeze should be light; <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> the time when our colonists did not desire to meet the savages out at sea. He described the party as formidable by numbers and resolution, though possessing few arms besides those of savages. There were half a dozen old muskets in the canoes, with a small supply of ammunition; but, since the desertion of Jones and Peters, no one remained {{who knew how to}} turn these weapons to much account. Nevertheless, the natives were so numerous, possessed so many weapons that were formidable in their own modes of fighting, and were so bent on success, that Unus did not hesitate to give it as his opinion, the colonists would act wisely in standing off for some other island, if they knew where another lay, even at the cost of abandoning most of their effects.|$|E
