40|$|It {{is known}} that the network design problem with the {{assumption}} of user optimal flows can be modeled as a 0 - 1 mixed integer programming problem. Instead, we formulate the network design problem with continuous investment variables subject to equilibrium assignment as a nonlinear optimization problem. We show that this optimization problem is equivalent to an unconstrained problem which we solve by direct search techniques. For convex investment cost functions, the performance of both Powell's method and the method of Hooke and Jeeves is approximately the same with respect to computational requirements for a 24 node, 76 <b>arc</b> <b>network.</b> For the case of concave investment functions, Hooke and Jeeves was superior. The solution to the concave continuous model was {{very similar to that}} of the 0 - 1 model. Furthermore, the required solution time was far less than that required by the corresponding discrete model of the same network. The advantages and disadvantages of the continuous approach as well as the computational requirements are discussed. ...|$|E

These changes encompass {{the construction of new}} arcs or improvement of existing <b>arcs.</b> <b>Network</b> flows are estimated by means of a Traffic Assignment Model using a Base Origin-Destination Matrix, generated by sampling and traffic counts. In addition to flows, we obtain speeds and calculate the estimated-flow/capacity ratio for each <b>arc</b> of the <b>network.</b> Emissions for each pollutant are estimated using speed and emission factors obtained from MOBILE Mexico City. Estimated emissions and the estimated-flow/capacity ratio (which is related to congestion) are displayed using a Geographic Information System (GIS).

We formulate the problems as integer programming models and solve them. Column generation technique to solve the linear programming relaxation is proposed with {{two types of}} columns.

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedThe U. S. Army Wartime Ammunition Distribution System (WADS) will experience an unprecedented demand for ammunition under the operational concept of Airland Battle. To meet demand, proper storage facility location and an efficient {{flow through the}} distribution network will be required. Using information from Army Field Manuals, maps and simulation data for demand, both a mixed integer program (MIP) and a sequential, optimization-based heuristic are developed to model the WADS. The Generalized Algebraic Modelling System is used to implement both models. The sequential heuristic locates ammunition facilities with a binary integer program and then directs ammunition through those facilities utilizing a network flow model with side constraints. The MIP integrates location and flow decisions in the same model. For a general scenario, the sequential heuristic locates a 21 node, 30 <b>arc</b> <b>network</b> with ammunition flows over 30 time periods in 22 CPU seconds on an IBM 3033 AP. For the same scenario the MIP obtains a solution for only a 3 time period problem in 87 CPU seconds. Keywords: Ammunition, Integer programming, Heuristic, Networks[URL] United States Arm...|$|E
40|$|Using limited resources, {{a network}} interdictor {{attempts}} to disable {{components of a}} capacitated network {{with the objective of}} minimizing the maximum network flow achievable by the network user. This problem has applications to reducing the importation of illegal drugs and planning wartime air attacks against an enemy's supply lines. A deterministic model using Benders decomposition is developed and improved upon with an original "flow-dispersion heuristic. " An extension is made to accommodate probabilistic scenarios, where each scenario is an estimate of uncertain arc capacities in the actual network. A unique sequential- approximation algorithm is utilized to investigate cases where interdiction successes are binary random variables. For a network of 3200 nodes and 6280 arcs, Benders decomposition solves the network interdiction problem in less than one-third of the time required by a direct branch-and-bound method. The flow-dispersion heuristic can decrease solution time to one-fifth or less of that required for the Benders decomposition algorithm alone. With six allowable but uncertain interdictions in a network of 100 nodes and 84 possible interdiction sites among 180 arcs, a stochastic network interdiction problem is solved to optimality in 24 minutes on a IBM RISC/ 6000 Model 590. With uncertain arc capacities in five scenarios, and three allowable and certain interdictions, a 900 node and 1740 <b>arc</b> <b>network</b> is solved to optimality in 17 minutes on a 60 MHZ Pentium PC.

50|$|Concerned {{about the}} toll on ratings of complex story <b>arcs,</b> <b>networks</b> {{sometimes}} ask showrunners to reduce serialization. Network executives believe that standalone episodes {{serve as a}} better jumping on point for new viewers, although this {{may result in a}} conflict with regular watchers who tend to prefer more focus on story arcs.Alias began as a more serialized show but later became more stand-alone under network pressure. During season 3 of the re-imagined Battlestar Galactica, showrunner Ronald D. Moore was also pressured to make episodes more stand-alone. This move resulted in negative criticism from both fans and critics, and Moore revealed in the Season 3 finale podcast that the network finally accepted that standalone episodes simply do not work for the story he is trying to tell.Moore has also stated that the network was reluctant to greenlight Caprica mainly because story-arc-heavy series notoriously have difficulty in picking up new viewers, as compared to a series composed of mostly standalone episodes.|$|R

40|$|Abstract: We {{evaluate}} the possible benefit from improving the workload distribution in a {{directed acyclic graph}} (DAG) (e. g. a project network), by determining a lower bound for the project completion time. It is shown that a lower bound {{can be obtained by}} equally distributing the workload over the max-cut in the graph which separates the nodes 1 and n. It is also shown that for a complete n-node DAG, practitioners can quickly compute a lower bound for the project completion time. The max-cut can be found by any linear programming algorithm or by reducing the problem to the problem of finding a maximum matching in a bipartite graph. Our results can help planners and project managers to characterize the "ideal case " in which the optimal workload distribution among the <b>arc</b> <b>networks</b> minimizes the project completion time. That can be done for a non-complete DAG as well as for a complete one. A lower bound can then be used to {{evaluate the}} maximum potential for reducing the project completion time in real-life cases...|$|R
