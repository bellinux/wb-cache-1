25|$|The river Mazarus, {{which at}} that time appears to have formed the {{boundary}} with Segesta, was only about 25km west of Selinunte; and {{it is certain that}} at a somewhat later period the territory of Selinunte extended to its banks, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>that</b> city had a fort and emporium at its mouth. On the other side Selinunte's territory certainly extended as far as the Halycus (modern Platani), at the mouth of which it founded the colony of Minoa, or Heracleia, as it was afterward called. It is clear, therefore, that Selinunte had already achieved great power and prosperity; but very little information survives about its history. Like most of the Sicilian cities, it passed from an oligarchy to a tyranny, and about 510BCE was subject to a despot named Peithagoras, who was overthrown {{with the assistance of the}} Spartan Euryleon, one of the companions of Dorieus. Euryleon himself ruled the city, for a little while, but was speedily overthrown and put to death by the Selinuntines. The Selinuntines supported the Carthaginians during the great expedition of Hamilcar (480BCE); they even promised to send a contingent to the Carthaginian army, but this did not arrive until after Hamilcar's defeat at the Battle of Himera.|$|E

25|$|Tristan und Isolde {{proved to}} be a {{difficult}} opera to stage, and Wagner considered various possibilities for the venue. In 1857 he was invited by a representative of Pedro II, Emperor of Brazil, to stage his operas in Rio de Janeiro (in Italian, the language of the Imperial Opera); he told Liszt he was considering settling in Rio, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>that</b> city would be given the honour of premiering Tristan. Wagner sent the Emperor bound copies of his earlier operas in expression of his interest, but nothing more came of the plan. He then proposed that the premiere take place in Strasbourg, following interest in the project shown by the Grand Duchess of Baden. Again, the project failed to eventuate. His thoughts then turned to Paris, the centre of the operatic world {{in the middle of the}} 19th century. However, after a disastrous staging of Tannhäuser at the Paris Opéra, Wagner offered the work to the Karlsruhe opera in 1861. When he visited the Vienna Court Opera to rehearse possible singers for this production, the management at Vienna suggested staging the opera there. Originally, the tenor Alois Ander was employed to sing the part of Tristan, but later proved incapable of learning the role. Parallel attempts to stage the opera in Dresden, Weimar and Prague failed. Despite over 70 rehearsals between 1862 and 1864, Tristan und Isolde was unable to be staged in Vienna, winning the opera a reputation as unperformable.|$|E
25|$|Gothic art {{was often}} typological in nature, {{reflecting}} {{a belief that}} the events of the Old Testament pre-figured those of the New, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>that</b> was indeed their main significance. Old and New Testament scenes were shown side by side in works like the Speculum Humanae Salvationis, and the decoration of churches. The Gothic period coincided with a great resurgence in Marian devotion, in which the visual arts played a major part. Images of the Virgin Mary developed from the Byzantine hieratic types, through the Coronation of the Virgin, to more human and initimate types, and cycles of the Life of the Virgin were very popular. Artists like Giotto, Fra Angelico and Pietro Lorenzetti in Italy, and Early Netherlandish painting, brought realism and a more natural humanity to art. Western artists, and their patrons, became much more confident in innovative iconography, and much more originality is seen, although copied formulae were still used by most artists. The book of hours was developed, mainly for the lay user able to afford them – the earliest known example seems to have written for an unknown laywoman living in a small village near Oxford in about 1240 – and now royal and aristocratic examples became the type of manuscript most often lavishly decorated. Most religious art, including illuminated manuscripts, was now produced by lay artists, but the commissioning patron often specified in detail what the work was to contain.|$|E

[...] Although Giddins dismissed the message, Agharta grew {{to become one of}} his favorite albums from the trumpeter's electric period, as he reevaluated its elements of drama, relentless tension, and what he considered the best performances of Fortune and Cosey's careers. [...] "There really is not a moment when the music fails to reflect the ministrations of the sorcerer himself", Giddins later said. Nathan Cobb from The Boston Globe reviewed the record favorably in 1976, calling it [...] "a kind of firestorm for the '70s" [...] with a [...] "positively cosmic" [...] rhythmic foundation and Davis [...] "the one who leads the others through the unknown waters of electronic jazz rock". In Down Beat, Gilmore said the band performed best on the breakneck segments opening each of the two discs, where Cosey's ferocious improvisations [...] "achieved a staggering emotional dimension" [...] lacking on the slower passages, which he felt were redeemed by Davis' elegiac trumpet playing. Lester Bangs found Agharta too difficult to definitively assess but nonetheless more fascinating than most other music being released at the time. He wrote in Phonograph Record that Davis' new music was the product of his heart's once luminous [...] "emotional capacities" [...] having been shattered by [...] "great, perhaps unbearable suffering", but that [...] "the soul beyond it" [...] could never be destroyed and interestingly [...] "almost glows uniquely brighter in its own dark coldness; <b>and</b> <b>that,</b> <b>that</b> which is all that is left, is merely the universe".|$|E
