40|$|This paper {{examines}} rent-creating state {{interventions in}} Colombia and the Philippines, where {{the authority to}} mobilise <b>agricultural</b> <b>levies</b> collected from leading agro-export sectors were delegated to producer associations. It investigates why coffee levies in Colombia are associated with production and welfare-enhancing outcomes, while coconut levies in the Philippines are depicted as non-developmental rent capture. The paper forwards an explanation based on {{a comparison of the}} basis in political economy of the power exercised by the leading sectoral organisations, FEDECAFE in Colombia and COCOFED in the Philippines. It finds that variations in historical political economy mean that conditions for collective action and the exercise of political power to influence rent mobilisation for developmental purposes were more robust for Colombian coffee than Philippine coconut producers. This paper explains the variations in terms of: (1) the economic basis of the power exercised by the producers; (2) the historical basis of productive expansion in the sectors; and (3) the political basis of the collection and mobilisation of the levies...|$|E
40|$|Without any tax {{sovereignty}} {{of its own}} and faced with a substantial decline in the volume of "traditional own resources" (customs duties, <b>agricultural</b> <b>levies,</b> sugar levies), the European Union is left with a very low level of revenue autonomy. The EU budget is financed primarily from national contributions by the member states. Hence, controversies {{are more and more}} likely to arise over the EU budget and, in the long run, the Union is at risk of being underfinanced. Moreover, there is a growing contradiction between the absence of EU {{tax sovereignty}}, on the one hand, and the intensified pace of European integration, on the other hand. Despite the associated increase of cross-border externalities (mainly environmental damage), no recourse is being taken to taxation at the European level as a steering instrument. Another point worth noting in this context is that EU funds are used to finance a range of "European public goods" and activities with positive cross-border externalities. This holds, in particular, for expenditure for research, education and the transport infrastructure, which is subject to decisions taken at the European level. With a view to fiscal equivalence, it would be appropriate also to collect the taxes required to finance such expenditure at the European level. Apart from that, any attempt to reform the EU's system of own resources should also be aimed at its simplification. EU Finanzrahmen 2006 - 2013 Finanzierung...|$|E

The policy analysis is structured around three layers of risk that require a differentiated policy response: normal (frequent) risks that should be retained by the farmer, marketable intermediate risks that can be transferred through market tools, and catastrophic risk that requires government assistance. The risk management policy in New Zealand is focused on prevention of pest and disease incursions. Assistance related to natural catastrophes is delivered within the Adverse Events Framework programme.

50|$|The <b>agricultural</b> {{emissions}} research <b>levy</b> was {{a controversial}} tax proposal in New Zealand.

40|$|The European Commission {{has allowed}} the {{authorities}} in Nordrhein Westphalia to extend aid to beef farmers to compensate for income losses arising from the BSE crisis. Normally such income aid is not allowed under EU rules. However {{it was felt that}} the exceptional circumstances created {{as a result of the}} BSE crisis justified such aid payments. While the total payment announced on March 12 th was relatively small (Euro 1 million), this was followed on April 3 rd by the approval of a similar national aid programme for French beef farmers totalling Euro 75. 5 million and the approval on April 12 th of a similar Euro 4. 8 million programme for Luxembourg beef farmers. Comment: Since 2000, EU beef prices have fallen by 20 %. The Commission has estimated that two-thirds of these price declines were the result of the reduction in the beef intervention price introduced as part of the reform of the beef sector. EU beef farmers were compensated for these price declines by increased direct aid payments. One-third of the price declines however were a consequence of the BSE and FMD crisis, for which no compensation payments had until recently been made. This situation has now been changed with the various national schemes for which the Commission has given exceptional approval. The situation of EU beef farmers is in stark contrast to that of ACP beef suppliers who have seen their hard currency earnings on exports to the EU falling between 28 % and 30 % depending on the meat cuts exported. In the case of Namibia, the decline in the earnings in 2001, compared to the pre-CAP reform period, led to income losses of around N$ 60 million. This has led southern African beef exporters to call for the introduction of a series of compensatory trade measures including: abolition of the remaining 8 % <b>agricultural</b> <b>levy</b> charged on ACP beef exports, which currently costs ACP beef exporters around Euro 0. 1 per kg of exported beef; a broadening of the beef product range which can be exported within the scope of the beef protocol, allowing the export of higher value products and reducing dependence on declining commodity markets; reform of the licensing arrangements to allow greater flexibility to respond to market signals. These are the kind of issues which could usefully be taken up by the ACP group with the European Commission in order to ensure that ACP countries retain benefits from their preferential trade relationship with the EU despite reform of the CAP which is eroding the market value of existing trade preferences.

2500|$|Anger at Qing {{concessions}} and surprise at their weakness was already prompting rebellions before disastrous flooding {{in the early}} 1850s – inter alia, shifting {{the mouth of the}} Yellow River from south of the Shandong peninsula to north of it – ruined and dislocated millions. In 1851, Hong Xiuquan began a revolt against the Qing dynasty, proclaiming its rulers to be [...] "filthy barbarians and beasts" [...] who had [...] "led China into despair". His Taiping Rebellion quickly took control of much of southeastern China. With aid from the British and French, the Qing defeated the rebels, but at an ultimate cost of over 20 million lives. Lasting until 1871, the Taiping Rebellion was one of the bloodiest wars in history and devastated the Qing economy, which had not been helped by the outbreak of a Second Opium War in 1856. At the same time, unrest in the Altishahr and Tarim Basin areas of Xinjiang in China's far north west proved a further drain on the imperial treasury. The maintenance of army garrisons to maintain order in Xinjiang and its adjunct administration cost tens of thousands of taels of silver annually, which required subsidies from <b>agricultural</b> taxes <b>levied</b> in the wealthier provinces.|$|R

Zusho also increased the level of illicit trade taking place with Qing Dynasty China, via the Ryukyu Islands. Zusho also put a monopoly system in place on the local sugar trade, and increased trade and production levels; by 1840, this had produced a 2,500,000 ryō surplus for the Satsuma budget.|$|R
40|$|The goods {{transported by}} way of the Grand Canal under the Ch‘ing Dynasty were mostly rice, millet, wheat and soy beans {{collected}} in those days as taxes. Among them the chief cargo was rice, the amount of which, according to the statistics compiled in the 9 th year of Tao-Kuang (道光), formed no less than 87. 7 % of the whole cargoes. The areas concerned with this transportation included the fertile lands and navigable water-ways in the eight provinces of Shan-tung, Ho-nan, Chiang-su, An-hui, Che-chiang, Chiang-his,Hu-pei and Hu-nan. (See Fig. Ⅱ). Millet, wheat and soy beans came from the arid northrn provinces of Shan-tung and Ho-nan, while rice from the damp, marshy southern Provinces. (See Table Ⅱ). It is surprising to note that the amount of rice sent out from the comparatively limited areas of Chiang-nan (江南, the southern part of Chiang-su and the northern part of Che-chiang) was as large as 54. 6 % of the aggregate of the <b>levied</b> <b>agricultural</b> products. (Ｓｅｅ Table Ⅲ). The number of the transport-vessels employed for this purpose exceeded 6, 000, which were composed into fleets each consisting of 30 - 100 ships and engaged in carrying those cereals either to peking or Tung-chow (通州). It is a matter of course that in chiang-nan areas where the largest amount of rice was collected, the vessels employed were far more numerous than elsewhere. This means that through transpotation, Chiang-nan areas played a very important part in the state economy theoughout the ch‘ing Dynasty and that the Grand Canal linked the Metropolis with the provincial areas...|$|R
