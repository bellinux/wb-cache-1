5|$|Stoke {{slipped down}} {{the league in}} an {{extremely}} tight 1937–38 season, and, annoyed by rumours circulating the city of resentment {{in the dressing room}} against him for his England success, Matthews requested a transfer in February; his request was denied. His request became public knowledge, and, disturbed by the attention and harassment he was receiving from Stoke supporters urging him to stay, Matthews decided to take <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>days</b> <b>off</b> from the club to relax in Blackpool. Finding no peace there either, Stoke chairman Albert Booth told Matthews he {{would not be allowed to}} leave the club, and 3,000 City supporters organized a meeting to make their feelings known – they too demanded that he stay. Touched by their strength of feeling and worn out by the attention he was receiving, Matthews agreed to stay. Despite playing regularly for the national side, Matthews put in 38 games for Stoke in 1938–39, helping them to a seventh-place finish – there would not be another full season of Football League action until 1946.|$|E

Although a sore throat prevented him seeing Murray off, French wrote to him (29 January) saying he hoped to see him back as an army commander before long. Haig wrote (diary 26 January) that “Murray was a kindly fellow but not a practical man in the field”.|$|E
500|$|The men {{found other}} ways to keep busy besides sports. Throughout the year, every ship in the {{squadron}} produced theater productions, and motion pictures were shown whenever possible. Furthermore, leave was granted to the men on a frequent basis whenever the ships were in Rosyth for repairs.

Strindberg {{was at that time}} fatally ill with cancer; he died on 14 May 1912. 1912 was altogether a year of death and disaster for the Bosse and Strindberg families: Alma Fahlstrøm's son Arne went down with the Titanic on 15 April; Strindberg's first wife Siri von Essen died later the same month; von Essen's and Strindberg's daughter Greta, a promising young actress, was killed in a train crash in June; and Bosse's divorced husband Gunnar Wingård shot himself on 7 October. Strindberg's funeral was a national event. Gunnar Wingård, a popular and charming actor, was also the subject of public grief. [...] Throughout these shattering events, which left both her children fatherless, Bosse kept up her busy schedule, apart from <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>days</b> <b>off,</b> distraught and grief-stricken, after Wingård's suicide.

500|$|Ultima Underworld II was {{developed}} in nine months. It was originally slated for a February 1993 release, but the date was later moved up to December 1992. The game underwent {{two and a half}} months of playtesting by Origin and Looking Glass employees, and by remote testing firms. According to Church, the testing phase took more time than expected because of complaints from playtesters and the presence of numerous bugs. Church went to Origin's headquarters in Texas during the final stages of development. The team [...] "tried desperately to make Christmas", and the game was completed around December 18. Church compiled the final version on his laptop in Spector's office. However, the game was held back for further playtesting even though it could have shipped on schedule. Church later commented, [...] "here was one bug we couldn't reproduce, and everyone really wanted to go home for Christmas. We ended up taking <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>days</b> <b>off,</b> checking it a few more days and using that version anyway." [...] The delay caused the game to miss the holiday season.

500|$|The script had {{two major}} roles: princes in a kingdom, the elder {{of whom was}} the hero and the younger the villain. M. K. Radha was offered the part of Sasankan, the younger prince. Since he was then known for heroic roles, Radha was unwilling to play a villain and instead agreed to play the older prince, Veerasimhan. His wife persuaded Vasan to cast Radha in the role. K. J. Mahadevan (a member of Gemini's story department) was chosen to play Sasankan, and T. G. Raghavachari agreed to direct the film. Although some footage of Mahadevan was filmed, his {{performance}} was considered [...] "too soft" [...] and he was replaced; however, he remained on the project as a scriptwriter and an assistant director. When Raghavachari suggested Ranjan as Sasankan, Vasan was reluctant; although the producer initially considered the actor too effeminate to play a [...] "steel-hard villain", Vasan eventually relented. Ranjan had committed to B. N.

Dodging an attack by three German fighters, as well as anti-aircraft fire, he landed in a deserted field, {{only to find that}} the agent refused {{to get out of the}} aircraft. While he was on reconnaissance duties with No. 8 Squadron, the London Gazette announced that he had been awarded the Military Cross [...] "for conspicuous skill and gallantry on many occasions," [...] particularly for [...] "one occasion [...] he attacked six in one flight". This was not unusual; throughout his career, Ball generally attacked on sight and heedless of the odds.

5000|$|The feast {{is found}} only in the special {{calendar}} of some dioceses and religious orders, and is celebrated with proper Mass and Office either on the third Sunday of July or on 23 October. In Venice this feast has been observed {{for more than three}} centuries with great solemnity. Moroni in his [...] "Dizionario" [...] gives some interesting data concerning the origin of this feast. In 1576 a plague broke out in Venice which in <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>days</b> carried <b>off</b> thousands of victims. To avert this scourge the Senate vowed to erect a splendid temple to the Redeemer of mankind, and to offer therein each year on the third Sunday of July public and solemn services of thanksgiving. Scarcely had the plague ceased when they began to fulfil their vow. The church was designed by the famous Andrea Palladio, and the corner-stone was laid by the Patriarch Trevisan on 3 May, 1577. The celebrated painters Paolo Veronese and Jacopo Tintoretto decorated the interior. The church was consecrated in 1592, and, at the urgent solicitations of Pope Gregory XIII, placed in charge of the Capuchin Fathers.|$|R
50|$|The {{eggs are}} white {{to begin with}} but change to a bright orange after <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>days</b> before darkening <b>off</b> just before hatching. Because the larvae feed almost {{exclusively}} on the flowers and developing seedpods there is rarely enough food to support more than one larva per plant. If two larvae meet one will often be eaten by the other to eliminate its competitor. Newly hatched larvae will also eat unhatched eggs for the same reason. To stop eggs from being laid on plants already laid on the female leaves a pheromone to deter future females from laying. There are five larval instars. The green and white caterpillar is attacked by several natural enemies (notably tachinid flies and braconid wasps).|$|R

Life was a rare good thing, and to be squashed out of it with your powers at full, a wretched mistake in Nature's arrangements, a wretched villainy on the part of Man--for his own death, like all those other millions of premature deaths, would have been due to the idiocy and brutality of men!
