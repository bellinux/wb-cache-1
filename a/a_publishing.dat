40|$|Shown in {{publication}} to be internally coherent by orthodox com-parative methodology (i. e., {{all members}} should {{be related to}} each other). • Not demonstrably related (in publication) to any other family by orthodox comparative methodology This delineation {{is meant to be}} authoritative (wherefore a "canonical source " is given), and any errors/omissions/inconsistences pointed out will be greatly appreciated. 2. For each language family, the "most extensive " descriptive source for the most well-described language of the group. Most extensive descrip-tive source is defined according to the following hierarchy: (<b>a)</b> <b>A</b> <b>published</b> (full-length) descriptive grammar (b) <b>A</b> <b>published</b> grammar sketch (c) <b>A</b> <b>published</b> description of some element of grammar (i. e. noun class system, verb morphology etc) (d) <b>A</b> <b>published</b> phonological description (e) <b>A</b> <b>published</b> dictionary (f) <b>A</b> <b>published</b> text (collection) (g) <b>A</b> <b>published</b> wordlist (h) <b>A</b> <b>published</b> document with meta-information about the language (i. e., where spoken, non-intelligibility to other languages etc.) (i) Notes on unpublished manuscripts or people engaged in studying the language 3. For many conventional subgroups, the most extensive descriptive source (as above) is listed for each subgroup as well. 2 Subgroup here means conventional subgroup, not well-argued genetic subgroup. The subgrouping is merely a re-statement of mostly ad-hoc groups of tractable size mentioned in the lit-erature. It should not be taken to imply that I agree with these subgroups or that they are sufficiently comparable units. In contrast to the higher level grouping ("family"), the subgrouping is not meant to be authoritative...|$|R

5|$|The game began {{development}} in September 1995, {{as part of}} <b>a</b> <b>publishing</b> deal with BMG Interactive. When this deal fell through, the development team turned their focus to the Nintendo 64, which allowed for a more advanced environment and model processing. The hardware also shaped the game's humour and style, with a soft focus look leading to a style akin to Plasticine models. The game's distinct British humour was also used to distinguish it from other games. Similarly, the game's music was created to resemble B movies.|$|E

5|$|Browning, Gyles' attorney, cited a case {{which had}} also {{appeared}} before Hardwicke, that of Read v Hodges.

Hardwicke rejected the argument, however, declaring that the former case had been decided merely on a motion, and that he had given his decision and statements without the thought he would have given a normal hearing. Hardwicke further took contention with the Attorney General for England and Wales' assertion that the Statute of Anne provided <b>a</b> <b>publishing</b> monopoly, instead interpreting the act as one meant to promote public education and the public good.|$|E

He negotiated <b>a</b> <b>publishing</b> agreement for the magazine with Pendulum Publications, but only three issues of New Worlds were subsequently produced before Pendulum's bankruptcy in late 1947. A group of science fiction fans formed a company called Nova Publications to revive the magazine; the first issue under their management appeared in mid-1949. New Worlds continued to appear on a regular basis until issue 20, published in early 1953, following which a change of printers led to a hiatus in publication. It was not until early 1954, when Maclaren & Sons acquired control of Nova Publications, that the magazine returned to a stable monthly schedule.|$|E
5|$|In 1934, Himmler {{founded the}} first SS {{business}} venture, Nordland-Verlag, <b>a</b> <b>publishing</b> house that released propaganda material and SS training manuals. Thereafter, he purchased Allach Porcelain, which {{then began to}} produce SS memorabilia. Because of the labor shortage and a desire for financial gain, the SS started exploiting concentration camp inmates as slave labor. Most of the SS businesses lost money until Himmler placed them under the administration of Pohl's Verwaltung und Wirtschaftshauptamt Hauptamt (Administration and Business office; VuWHA) in 1939. Even then, most of the enterprises were poorly run and did not fare well, as SS men were not selected for their business experience, and the workers were starving. In July 1940 Pohl established the Deutsche Wirtschaftsbetriebe GmbH (German Businesses Ltd; DWB), an umbrella corporation under which he took over administration of all SS business concerns. Eventually the SS founded nearly 200 holding companies for their businesses.|$|E

Part {{of the first generation}} raised under French colonization, Rabearivelo grew up impoverished and failed to complete secondary education.
