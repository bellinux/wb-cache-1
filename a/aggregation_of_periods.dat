The main driver for the increase in robustness is that longer time frames result in allocations where resources are assigned in longer contiguous time blocks.

40|$|The optimization-based {{design of}} {{renewable}} energy systems is a computationally demanding task {{because of the high}} temporal fluctuation of supply and demand time series. In order to reduce these time series, the <b>aggregation</b> <b>of</b> typical operation <b>periods</b> has become common. The problem with this method is that these aggregated typical periods are modeled independently and cannot exchange energy. Therefore, seasonal storage cannot be adequately taken into account, although this will be necessary for energy systems with a high share of renewable generation. To address this issue, this paper proposes a novel mathematical description for storage inventories based on the superposition of inter-period and intra-period states. Inter-period states connect the typical periods and are able to account their sequence. The approach has been adopted for different energy system configurations. The results show that a significant reduction in the computational load can be achieved also for long term storage-based energy system models in comparison to optimization models based on the full annual time series.

40|$|The {{influences}} of upper air characteristics {{along the coast}} of California upon the winter time precipitation in the Sierra Nevada region were investigated. Most precipitation episodes in the Sierra are associated with moist southwesterly winds and also tend to occur when the 700 -mb temperature is close to - 2 C. This favored wind direction and temperature signifies the equal importance of moisture transport and orographic lifting for maximum precipitation frequency. Making use of this observation, simple linear models were formulated to quantify the precipitation totals observed at different sites as a function of moisture transport. The skill of the model is least for daily precipitation and increases with time scale <b>of</b> <b>aggregation.</b> In terms <b>of</b> incremental gain, the skill of the model is optimal for an <b>aggregation</b> <b>period</b> <b>of</b> 5 - 7 days, which is also the duration of the most frequent precipitation events in the Sierra.

After dealing with the relevant conceptual framework, the report commences with a section highlighting the current diversity of social security systems in SADC countries and the problems this diversity creates for the mobility of people in SADC and their social security status. Restrictions contained in the legal system are in particular emphasized. The next section gives a high-level overview of those developments, initiatives and measures at a national, regional and international level which enhance the social security status of non-citizens in SADC. Finally, based on this descriptive and analytical section, the report proceeds with an analysis of how the problems experienced by non-citizens in SADC in social security terms, might be solved, where the shortcomings of the current initiatives are, and how to overcome these shortcomings. In this regard this final part also considers the potential to introduce cross-border social security arrangements, with particular reference to the maintenance of acquired social security rights, the <b>aggregation</b> <b>of</b> insurance <b>periods,</b> and the portability of social security benefits.

Recent evidence indicates that accumulation and <b>aggregation</b> <b>of</b> intracellular amyloid β peptides may {{also play a role}} in disease pathogenesis. This would suggest that intracellular Heat Shock Proteins (HSP) that maintain cellular protein homeostasis might be candidates for disease amelioration. We recently found that DNAJB 6, a member of DNAJ family of heat shock proteins, effectively prevented the <b>aggregation</b> <b>of</b> short aggregation-prone peptides containing large poly glutamines (associated with CAG repeat diseases) both in vitro and in cells. Moreover, recent in vitro data showed that DNAJB 6 can delay the <b>aggregation</b> <b>of</b> Aβ 42 peptides.

40|$|Ubiquitous natural {{organic matter}} (NOM) plays an {{important}} role in the <b>aggregation</b> state <b>of</b> engineered silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) in aquatic environment, which determines the transport, transformation, and toxicity of AgNPs. As various capping agents are used as coatings for nanoparticles and NOM are natural polymer mixture with wide molecular weight (MW) distribution, probing the particle coating-dependent interaction of MW fractionated natural organic matter (M-f-NOM) with various coatings is helpful for understanding the differential aggregation and transport behavior of engineered AgNPs as well as other metal nanoparticles. In this study, we investigated the role of pristine and M-f-NOM on the <b>aggregation</b> <b>of</b> AgNPs with Bare, citrate, and PVP coating (Bare-, Cit-, and PVP-AgNP) in mono- and divalent electrolyte solutions. We observed that the enhanced <b>aggregation</b> or dispersion <b>of</b> AgNPs in NOM solution highly depends on the coating of AgNPs. Pristine NOM inhibited the <b>aggregation</b> <b>of</b> Bare-AgNPs but enhanced the <b>aggregation</b> <b>of</b> PVP-AgNPs. In addition, M-f-NOM fractions have distinguishing roles on the <b>aggregation</b> and dispersion <b>of</b> AgNPs, which also highly depend on the AgNPs coating as well as the MW of M-f-NOM. Higher MW M-f-NOM (> 100 kDa and 30 - 100 kDa) enhanced the <b>aggregation</b> <b>of</b> PVP-AgNPs in mono- and divalent electrolyte solutions, whereas lower MW M-f-NOM (10 - 30 kDa, 3 - 10 kDa and < 3 kDa) inhibited the <b>aggregation</b> <b>of</b> PVP-AgNPs. However, all the M-f-NOM fractions inhibited the <b>aggregation</b> <b>of</b> Bare-AgNPs. For PVP- and Bare-AgNPs, the stability of AgNPs in electrolyte solution was significantly correlated to the MW of M-f-NOM. But for Cit-AgNPs, pristine NOM and M-f-NOM has minor influence on the stability of AgNPs. These findings about significantly different roles <b>of</b> M-f-NOM on <b>aggregation</b> <b>of</b> engineered AgNPs with various coating are important for better understanding of the transport and subsequent transformation of AgNPs in aquatic environment...|$|R

We comment on Lo’s (2002) results for the time <b>aggregation</b> <b>of</b> SR considering a different approach to deal with the conditional heteroskedasticity of returns. Based on a theorem proposed by Diebold (1986, 1988) we verify, for the series of financial returns with no serial correlation, that the most common method for time <b>aggregation,</b> the product <b>of</b> the higher-frequency SR by the square root of the number <b>of</b> <b>periods</b> contained in the lower-frequency holding period, can still be used in the presence of heteroskedasticity, when higher-frequency returns have been generated by a GARCH process and aggregated returns converge to the normal distribution. In an empirical application based on 65 investment funds, the convergence to normality is illustrated, showing that in 70 % of the cases the convergence is held at least when daily returns are aggregated into annual frequency. Moreover, we show that serial correlation tends to disappear when the number <b>of</b> <b>periods</b> in the <b>aggregation</b> process tends to infinity and the most common method <b>of</b> SR time <b>aggregation</b> should not be disregarded as a valid method.

40|$|ABSTRACT The {{effects of}} ionic {{strength}} and cationic valency of the fluid medium {{on the surface}} potential and dextran-induced <b>aggregation</b> <b>of</b> red blood cells (RBC's) were investigated. The zeta potential was calculated from cell mobility in a microelectrophoresis apparatus; the degree <b>of</b> <b>aggregation</b> <b>of</b> normal and neuraminidase-treated RBC's in dextrans (Dx 40 and Dx 80) was quantified by microscopic observation, measurement of erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and determination of low-shear viscosity. A decrease in ionic strength caused a reduction in <b>aggregation</b> <b>of</b> normal RBC's in dextrans, but {{had no effect on}} the <b>aggregation</b> <b>of</b> neuraminidase-treated RBC's. These findings reflect an increase in electrostatic repulsive force between normal RBC's by the reduction in ionic strength due to (a) a decrease in the screening of surface charge by counter-ions and (b) an increase in the thickness of the electric double layer. Divalent cations (Ca + +, Mg ++, and Ba++) increased <b>aggregation</b> <b>of</b> normal RBC's in dextrans, but had no effect on the <b>aggregation</b> <b>of</b> neuraminidase-treated RBC's. These effects of the divalent cations are attributable to a decrease in surface potential of normal RBC's and a shrinkage of the electric double layer.
