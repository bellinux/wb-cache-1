The men's basketball team has featured several notable alumni including former Texas Longhorns' all-time leading free-throw shooter, Brandy Perryman. On March 10, 2010, former head coach Jeff Tanner resigned after 12 years as head boys' basketball coach.

Undergraduates enrolled in The Honors College participate in smaller classes with faculty, including individual research programs or assigned {{research in the area}} of a sponsoring faculty member. <b>Another</b> <b>program</b> offered by the college is Honors in the Major, which allows juniors and seniors to conduct original research within their major and write an undergraduate honors thesis. The latest Honors College incoming class had an average SAT score of 1373 and a 4.16 grade-point average.

5|$|The {{architectural}} firm Ellerbe Becket, {{in association with}} Loschky Marquardt & Nesholm Architects of Seattle, designed the 1,500,000sqft(140,000m2) project. Allen was closely involved during the design process. While growing up he attended games at the University of Washington's outdoor Husky Stadium. His goal {{was to create a}} similar experience and atmosphere at the new venue. The exhibition center portion of the project was designed over a period of 14months by Loschky Marquardt & Nesholm Architects while First & Goal managed the construction. Town meetings were held to discuss the impact on the public, and the company created a $6million mitigation fund for nearby neighborhoods. In accordance with a program established by the building team, contracts totaling $81million were awarded to minority- and women-owned businesses. Union apprentices made up 19% of the workforce through <b>another</b> <b>program</b> with local trade unions.|$|E

5|$|In the 38th Canadian Parliament Dosanjh was {{appointed}} Minister of Health {{in the federal}} Cabinet. As Health Minister, Dosanjh strongly supported Canada's existing single-tier, publicly funded health-care system. Dosanjh introduced legislation to make cigarettes fire safe, new regulations to further limit lead content in children's jewelry, and supported an NDP motion to ban trans fats. He advocated that Canada ratify the World Health Organization Framework Convention on Tobacco Control, which they did in November 2004. Dosanjh funded a program to revise the Canada food guide to include more multicultural foods and <b>another</b> <b>program</b> to integrate foreign-trained medical professionals into the health-care system. Supported by a unanimous vote in the House of Commons, the government agreed to compensate the 6,000 Canadians infected with hepatitis C from tainted blood transfusion. Along with Prime Minister Martin, a 10-year, $41 billion funding plan was negotiated with the provinces to deliver health care – with $5.5 billion to specifically address wait times that had been an election issue during the 2004 federal election – but they rejected Premiers' demands for a national program to purchase pharmaceuticals in bulk. As the Minister of Health, Dosanjh introduced Bill C-12 An Act to prevent the introduction and spread of communicable diseases which updated the 1985 Quarantine Act; it was given royal assent in May 2005.|$|E
5|$|Since {{the late}} 20th century, the MTA has started several {{projects}} to maintain and improve the subway. In the 1990s, it started converting the BMT Canarsie Line to use communications-based train control, utilizing a moving block signal system that allowed more trains to use the tracks and thus increasing passenger capacity. After the Canarsie Line tests were successful, the MTA expanded the automation program in the 2000s and 2010s to include other lines. As part of <b>another</b> <b>program</b> called FASTRACK, the MTA started closing certain lines during weekday nights in 2012, {{with each of the}} lines closing overnight for a week in order to allow workers to clean these lines without being hindered by train movements. It expanded the program beyond Manhattan the next year after noticing how efficient the FASTRACK program was compared to previous service diversions. In 2015, the MTA announced a wide-ranging improvement program as part of the 2015–2019 Capital Program. Thirty stations would be extensively rebuilt under the Enhanced Station Initiative, and new R211 subway cars would be able to fit more passengers.|$|E

25|$|Among other things, a {{multiprogramming}} {{operating system}} kernel must {{be responsible for}} managing all system memory which is currently in use by programs.
