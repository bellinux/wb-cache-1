40|$|Physical and {{mathematical}} modelling of fluid flow phenomena {{play an important}} role in studies of steel quality associated with the various steps in steelmaking and steel processing operations. In the continuous casting process, the tundish not only serves as an intermediate buffer, but with increasing demands for high quality steel, it has also evolved into a useful reactor for liquid steel refining. It is now a proven fact that a modern tundish is designed to carry out different metallurgical operations such as inclusion separation and floatation, alloy trimming, superheat control, calcium doped inclusion modification, thermal and particulate homogenization. To carry out those operations effectively, certain parameters like Residence Time Distribution (RTD), Residual Ratio of Inclusions (RRI), Slag Entrainment and Vortex formation phenomena are generally studied and optimized using various tundish designs, and flow modification devices. These are usually specific to a given plant practice and to a targeted grade of steel. A full scale physical model of a delta shaped, four strand tundish using water as the simulating fluid for liquid steel was used to study the fluid flow behavior of a 12 t tundish producing <b>aluminium-killed</b> <b>steel</b> billets., The above mentioned parameters were studied to predict the performance of the tundish using two different types of flow modification systems...|$|E
40|$|Abstract This thesis {{studies the}} factors that govern {{transverse}} cracking during continuous casting of low carbon, niobium microalloyed and boron microalloyed steels. Crack susceptibility in the thick slab, billet and thin slab casting processes are compared by using typical conditions in laboratory hot ductility tests. There is limited published literature on hot ductility in aluminium-killed and siliconkilled boron microalloyed steels and the proposed mechanisms of failure by transverse cracking are contradictory. Few published papers specifically compare hot ductility behaviour of any steels between thick slab, billet and thin slab continuous casting processes. Thus, {{the basis of this}} research is to assess the influence of casting parameters and compositional variations on hot ductility behaviour in low carbon steels, niobium microalloyed <b>steels,</b> <b>aluminium-killed</b> boron microalloyed <b>steels</b> and silicon-killed, boron microalloyed steels. The typical temperature ranges, cooling rate and strain rate conditions of the continuous casting processes were used in reheated and in situ melted hot tensile tests performed on steel specimens. Solidification, transformation and precipitation temperatures were calculated using solubility equations and modelled using the Thermo-CalcTM thermodynamics program. Scanning electron microscopy and transmission electron microscopy were used to determine the modes of failure in the tested specimens. In the low carbon steels, hot ductility was improved by increasing the strain rate; by calcium treatment, which minimises copper sulphide and iron sulphide formation; and by maintaining a nickel to copper ratio of 1 : 1. It was shown that thin slab casting conditions provided the best hot ductility results for the low carbon steels. All the niobium steels showed poor ductility in the single-phase austenite temperature region, indicating that intergranular precipitation of fine niobium carbonitrides was the cause of the poor ductility. It was shown that the hot ductility was greatly improved by calcium treatment, by decreasing the cooling rate and by increasing the strain rate. Slow iv thin slab and thick slab casting conditions provided the best hot ductility results for the niobium steels. Hot ductility was substantially improved in the <b>aluminium-killed</b> boron <b>steels</b> by increasing the boron to nitrogen ratio from 0. 19 to 0. 75. The results showed that, at cooling rates generally associated with thick slab, bloom and slow thin slab casting, a boron to nitrogen ratio of ≥ 0. 47 was sufficient to avoid a ductility trough altogether. However, under conditions typically experienced in fast thin slab and billet casting, a boron to nitrogen ratio of 0. 75 was required to provide good hot ductility. The mechanism of the ductility improvement with increasing boron to nitrogen ratio was found to be enhanced precipitation of boron nitride, leading to a decrease in nitrogen available for aluminium nitride precipitation. In the silicon-killed boron steels, {{it was found that the}} boron to nitrogen ratio had the overriding influence on hot ductility and hence on crack susceptibility. Excellent hot ductility was found for boron to nitrogen ratios above 1. Additionally, analysis of industrial casting data showed that the scrap percentage due to transverse cracking increased significantly at manganese to sulphur ratios below fourteen. An exponential decay relationship between the manganese to sulphur ratio and the average scrap percentage due to transverse cracking was determined as a tool to predict scrap levels in the casting plant...|$|R
40|$|In this study, {{the goal}} is to {{optimize}} the process and to reduce the clogging tendency during the continuous casting process. The focus is on clogging when the refractory base material (RBM) in the SEN is in contact with the liquid steel. It is difficult or impossible to avoid non-metallic inclusions in the liquid steel, but by a selection of a good RBM in the SEN clogging can be reduced.   Different process steps were evaluated during the casting process {{in order to reduce the}} clogging tendency. First, the preheating of the SEN was studied. The results showed that the SEN can be decarburized during the preheating process. In addition, decarburization of SEN causes a larger risk for clogging. Two types of plasma coatings were implemented to protect the RBM, to prevent reactions with the RBM, and to reduce the clogging tendency. Calcium titanate (CaTiO 3) mixed with yttria stabilized zirconia (YSZ) plasma coatings were tested in laboratory and pilot plant trials, for casting of <b>aluminium-killed</b> low-carbon <b>steels.</b> For casting of cerium alloyed stainless steels, YSZ plasma coatings were tested in laboratory, pilot plant and industrial trials. The results showed that the clogging tendency was reduced when implementing both coating materials.   It is also of importance to produce clean steel in order to reduce clogging. Therefore, the steel cleanliness in the tundish was studied experimentally. The result showed that inclusions originated from the slag, deoxidation products and tundish refractory and that they were present in the tundish as well as in the final steel product.

40|$|AbstractImproving {{the quality}} of steel and the {{steelmaking}} process has {{been a matter of}} routine for metallurgical engineers and steelmaking companies in a demanding market for quality products at highly competitive price. The chemical and temperature adjustment are made during the secondary refining process, as well as the inclusion modification required to product quality, and also the demand for castability accuracy. Continuous casting process is the most used solidification casting process, in which the flow of pouring liquid metal through the submerged entry nozzle is assured by the correct temperature and the formation of liquid inclusion in the casting temperature. Thermocalc and CEQCSI were the software used in this work to assess the effect of carbon, silicon and sulphur in the castability window of the aluminium vs calcium phase diagrams. They have proved to be highly suitable and effective and the results showed that the chemical elements used directly affected the position of the castability window of carbon steel. An analysis of a 0. 2 %C billet sample using Scanning Electron Microscopy showed that there is a great heterogeneity of inclusions in <b>aluminium-killed</b> and calcium-treated <b>steel...</b>|$|R
