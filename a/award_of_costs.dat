25|$|During first {{instance}} proceedings, {{a decision on}} apportionment of costs forms part of the main decision of the Opposition Division. The main decision however only deals with the obligation on the party or parties concerned to bear costs (apportionment), whereas the actual amounts to be paid by one party to another are dealt with in another decision, namely a decision on the award (fixing) of costs. A decision on the <b>award</b> <b>of</b> <b>costs</b> is taken only after a decision apportioning the costs has been taken and if a request is submitted to that effect. When a Board of Appeal has to rule on an apportionment of costs, both the apportionment of costs and the fixing of costs to be apportioned are dealt with in a single decision.|$|E

40|$|The <b>awarding</b> <b>of</b> {{arbitration}} <b>costs</b> and attorneys’ fees {{in international}} arbitrations is often arbitrary and unpredictable. In one recent investment arbitration where the tribunal deciding a case {{under the auspices}} of the international Centre for the Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID) had broad discretion to award costs and fees, the tribunal allocated arbitration costs evenly amongst the claimant and respondent and required each party to bear its own fees and expenses, even though the claimant prevailed. In another case where the claimant was successful on its substantive claim, the ICSID tribunal ordered the respondent to pay the claimant US$ 6 million for legal fees, but required the parties to bear the <b>costs</b> <b>of</b> the arbitration equally. And in still another recent investment arbitration the unsuccessful respondent was ordered to pay the <b>costs</b> <b>of</b> the arbitration, but each party was responsible for its own legal fees. These results are not unique to investment arbitrations; they can also be found in international commercial arbitrations. The lack of uniformity in the <b>awarding</b> <b>of</b> <b>costs</b> and fees poses two major problems. First, arbitrary awards undermine the legitimacy of the dispute resolution system. Second, the lack of predictability may hinder parties from being able to settle the dispute and could rob arbitration of its efficiency. These problems are exacerbated in the international context because the costs and fees in transnational disputes can run into the millions of dollars. Indeed, in one recent celebrated arbitration, the costs and fees totaled over US$ 21 million. This article examines the <b>awarding</b> <b>of</b> <b>costs</b> and fees in international commercial arbitrations and transnational investment disputes. My study finds that <b>awards</b> <b>of</b> <b>costs</b> and fees are arbitrary and unpredictable under both systems. To remedy these problems, I propose two different approaches: one for ICSID tribunals and another for international commercial arbitrations. In the case of ICSID arbitrations, the parties should share equally the <b>costs</b> <b>of</b> the arbitration and bear their own legal expenses. In essence, I propose that ICSID adopt what has become known as the American Rule with respect to the <b>awarding</b> <b>of</b> <b>costs</b> and fees. This approach is needed to bring predictability to the field, provide greater administrative efficiency, and reduce the overall costs. In the case of international commercial arbitrations, I argue that parties should be free to select the method for resolving claims for costs and fees, including authorizing the tribunal to resolve such claims pursuant to the principle of “costs follow the event” or the “loser pays” rule. In this context, the adoption of the American Rule would not achieve the same administrative and economic benefits, and the principle of party autonomy calls for this different approach...|$|R

5000|$|After-the-event (ATE) {{insurance}} {{is taken out}} after an event, such as an accident which has caused an injury, to insure the policyholder for disbursements, {{as well as any}} costs should they lose their case. After-the-event {{insurance is}} usually used by people who do not have before-the-event insurance. If the policyholder loses the case, then the insurance company will pay the opponent's legal costs and expenses, as well as the policyholder's own disbursements. Solicitors who take on, for example, personal injury cases on a [...] "no win no fee" [...] basis, may require their clients (whether defendants or plaintiffs) to take out after-the-event insurance so that costs will be covered if the case is lost. The premium payments, especially in a [...] "no win no fee" [...] arrangement, may be deferred until the conclusion of the case; thus in most cases the premium itself is self-insured. This insurance is often offered by solicitors and claims management companies [...] Where the ATE insurance policy was incepted before 1 April 2013, its cost will often be recoverable by the successful party from the losing side as part of an <b>award</b> <b>of</b> <b>costs.</b> Where the ATE insurance policy was incepted on or after 1 April 2013, its cost will not be recoverable by the successful party from the losing side.

Gunns has maintained the position that they were merely trying to prevent parties enjoined to the writ from undertaking unlawful activities that disrupt their business. The statement of claim alleged incidents of assault against forestry workers and vandalism. At a hearing before the Supreme Court of Victoria, an amended statement of claim lodged by the company and served on defendants on July 1, 2005 was dismissed. However, the judge in the case granted the company leave to lodge a third version of their statement of claim with the court no later than August 15, 2005. The application continued before the court, before being brought to a close on October 20, 2006. In his ruling, the Honourable Justice Bongiorno made an <b>award</b> <b>of</b> <b>costs</b> in favour of the respondents only as far as it covered those costs incurred with striking out the third version of the statement of claim, and costs incurred associated with their application for costs.
