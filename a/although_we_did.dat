On some songs, like [...] "Jellybelly", the first string was tuned down an additional whole step to C (referred to by Corgan as [...] "the 'grunge tuning'"). There was a greater variety {{to the number of}} guitar overdubs utilized than on previous albums. Iha said, [...] "n the past, everything had to be overdubbed and layered—guitar overkill. That wasn't really the train of thought this time, <b>although</b> <b>we</b> <b>did</b> that too." [...] "To Forgive" [...] consists of only one live guitar take, while [...] "Thru the Eyes of Ruby" [...] contains approximately 70guitar tracks. The various sections of [...] "Porcelina of the Vast Oceans" [...] were recorded at various times, with different instruments and recording setups, and were digitally composited in Pro Tools. Corgan and Iha shared soloing duties; Iha estimated that the guitar solo duties were divided [...] "half and half" [...] on the record.|$|E

Cao Pi honoured him with the posthumous title [...] "Marquis Dao" [...] (悼侯) and wrote an official eulogy for him: [...] "(Xiahou) Shang had been a close companion to me since my childhood. He was loyal, sincere and faithful. <b>Although</b> <b>we</b> <b>did</b> not have the same parents, we were as close as brothers. He was like my stomach and heart, and like claws and teeth to me. He was intelligent, perceptive and exceptionally brilliant. It is a pity that his life ended so early. Alas, such is life!

They had not forgiven Bastin his sacrilege or for his undermining of their authority by the preaching of new doctrines which, if adopted, would destroy them as a hierarchy. Nor had they forgiven Bickley for shooting one of their number, or any of us for our escape from the vengeance of their god.|$|E

He looked so seedy and forlorn, so homeless and friendless and forsaken, that I yearned toward him as a brother. I wanted to claim kinship with him and go about and enjoy our wretchedness together. The drawing toward each other must have been mutual; at any rate we got to falling together oftener, though still seemingly by accident; and <b>although</b> <b>we</b> <b>did</b> not speak or evince any recognition, I think the dull anxiety passed out of both of us when we saw each other, and then for several hours we would idle along contentedly, wide apart, and glancing furtively in at home lights and fireside gatherings, out of the night shadows, and very much enjoying our dumb companionship.|$|E

60|$|I {{think he}} said things like this to give courage to us three, but I don't believe we needed it, particularly.

I was pretty much of the same mind, but poor Corny was in a sad way.

But we could say nothing positive about this, of course, <b>although</b> <b>we</b> <b>did</b> all that we could, in a general way, to make her feel that everything would turn out all right.

6000|$|The {{death of}} poor Fred Borders cast a gloom over the ship for many days. Every one had respected, {{and many of}} us had loved the lad, so that we mourned for him long and truly. But a sailor's life is such a rough one, {{requiring}} so much energy and hearty good-will to his work, that he cannot afford to allow the sorrows of his heart to sit long on his countenance. In a day or two after no one would have supposed we had lost one of our best men. Whales appeared in great numbers around us. The old cry of [...] "There she blows!" [...] ran out frequently from the mast-head, and the answering cry from the captain, [...] "Where away?" [...] was followed by the [...] "Stand by to lower!--lower away." [...] Then came the chase, with all its dangers and excitement--the driving of the harpoon, the sudden rush of the struck fish, the smoke and sparks of fire from the logger-head, the plunging of the lance, the spouting blood, the [...] "flurry" [...] at the end, and the wild cheer as we beheld our prize floating calmly on the sea. And in the midst of such work we forgot for a time the solemn scene we had so recently witnessed. But our hearts were not so light as before, and <b>although</b> <b>we</b> <b>did</b> not show it, I knew full well that many a joke was checked, and many a laugh repressed, for the memory of our dead shipmate.|$|E
6000|$|One awoke of {{a morning}} to the twittering of birds, to walk to school amidst delicate, lace-like shadows of great trees acloud with old gold: the buds lay curled like tiny {{feathers}} on the pavements. Suddenly the shade was dense, the sunlight white and glaring, the odour of lilacs heavy in the air, spring in all its fulness had come,--spring and Nancy. Just so subtly, yet with the same seeming suddenness had budded and come to leaf and flower a perfect understanding, which nevertheless remained undefined. This, I had no doubt, was my fault, and due to the incomprehensible shyness her presence continued to inspire. <b>Although</b> <b>we</b> <b>did</b> not altogether abandon our secret trysts, we began to meet in more natural ways; there were garden parties and picnics where we strayed together through the woods and fields, pausing to tear off, one by one, the petals of a daisy, [...] "She loves me, she loves me not." [...] I never ventured to kiss her; I always thought afterwards I might have done so, she had seemed so willing, her eyes had shone so expectantly as I sat {{beside her on the}} grass; nor can I tell why I desired to kiss her save that this was the traditional thing to do to the lady one loved. To be sure, the very touch of her hand was galvanic. Paradoxically, I saw the human side of her, the yielding gentleness that always amazed me, yet I never overcame my awe of the divine; she was a being sacrosanct. Whether this idealism were innate or the result of such romances as I had read I cannot say.... I got, indeed, an avowal of a sort. The weekly dancing classes having begun again, on one occasion when she had waltzed twice with Gene Hollister I protested.|$|E
