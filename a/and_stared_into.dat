6000|$|... "I don't {{suppose he}} has spoken to a girl for years. What a lesson this is to us, Jeeves, not to shut {{ourselves}} up in country houses <b>and</b> <b>stare</b> <b>into</b> glass tanks. You can't be the dominant male {{if you do that}} sort of thing. In this life, you can choose between two courses. You can either shut yourself up in a country house <b>and</b> <b>stare</b> <b>into</b> tanks, or you can be a dasher with the sex. You can't do both." ...|$|R

60|$|No {{person was}} to be seen, and no young rabbits. The kitchen was empty and silent; the clock had run down. Peter and Benjamin {{flattened}} their noses against the window, <b>and</b> <b>stared</b> <b>into</b> the dusk.|$|E
60|$|Maud {{rested her}} chin on her hand, <b>and</b> <b>stared</b> out <b>into</b> the velvet darkness.|$|R
50|$|Renée {{returns from}} Switzerland to find Alexandre holding a ball celebrating Maxime's {{engagement}} to Anne.

"'You {{just sit}} <b>and</b> <b>stare</b> <b>into</b> space <b>and</b> {{think about what}} you'd really like to be doing,' the 41-year-old District {{resident}} recalls of her final months at WMAL radio five years ago.

The painting depicts Mahler in a peaceful sleep beside Kokoschka, who is awake <b>and</b> <b>stares</b> <b>into</b> space.

60|$|He {{dropped his}} head <b>and</b> <b>stared</b> <b>into</b> the fire, {{fingering}} his moustache the while.

5000|$|The {{story begins}} with the narrator calling [...] "Halloa! Below there!" [...] into a railway cutting. The {{signalman}} standing on the railway below does not look up, as the narrator expects, but rather turns about <b>and</b> <b>stares</b> <b>into</b> the railway tunnel that is his responsibility to monitor.

60|$|The King turned also, <b>and</b> <b>stared</b> out <b>into</b> the dark, {{where the}} great lamps that commemorated the battle were already flaming.|$|R
60|$|She {{raised her}} eyes, <b>and</b> Lieut. D'Hubert <b>stared</b> <b>into</b> them incredulously.|$|R
60|$|Finally the upstairs-and-downstairs passage seemed {{coming to}} an end, for {{daylight}} again appeared ahead of the two girls and Ozma replaced her wand in the bosom of her gown.

60|$|When {{the next}} night was nearly gone, but before it was yet day, Nod awoke, cool and clear, <b>and</b> <b>stared</b> <b>into</b> the musty {{darkness}} of the Dragon-tree, wondering in vain where he was.

60|$|The proud girl started <b>and</b> <b>stared</b> <b>into</b> {{her face}} with a ghastly look, but a wild-and mournful {{expression}} passed across {{the features of the}} gentle one, and, weak and helpless, she sank down on the bed, her head pillowed beside that of the corpse and her hair mingling with his dark locks. A creature of hope and joy, the first draught of sorrow had bewildered her.|$|E
50|$|One day soon after, Julia {{thinks she}} sees Valentina while out shopping. Julia grabs Valentina's arm <b>and</b> <b>stares</b> <b>into</b> her eyes. Julia isn't {{sure that this}} is her dead sister; however, she has suspicions. She sees that the girl she thinks is Valentina is pregnant. Elspeth (in Valentina's body) runs off and informs Robert that they need to move to Sussex so that she won't be recognized. Elspeth has always wanted to live in Sussex.|$|R
60|$|Katharine stirred her spoon round <b>and</b> round, <b>stared</b> <b>into</b> {{the swirl}} of the tea, and {{remained}} silent. Mr. Clacton, meanwhile, framed a question which, after a moment's hesitation, he put to Katharine.|$|R

60|$|As {{they reached}} the hall the doors flew open before them; but then they all stopped <b>and</b> <b>stared</b> <b>into</b> the domed cavern with faces of astonishment and dismay.

60|$|It was a small, narrow kitchen. He {{dropped his}} {{cap on the}} table that was covered with {{yellowish}} American cloth, and took a seat {{with his back to}} the wall, near the oven. His wife still sat with her knees apart, her feet on the steel fender <b>and</b> <b>stared</b> <b>into</b> the fire, motionless. Her skin was smooth and rosy in the firelight. Everything in the house was very clean and bright. The man sat silent, too, his head dropped. And thus they remained.|$|E
60|$|The two {{brothers}} sat {{up on their}} bolster <b>and</b> <b>stared</b> <b>into</b> the darkness. The room was full of water, and by a misty moonbeam, which found its way {{through a hole in}} the shutter, they could see in the midst of it an enormous foam globe, spinning round and bobbing up and down like a cork, on which, as on a most luxurious cushion, reclined the little old gentleman, cap and all. There was plenty of room for it now, for the roof was off.|$|E
6000|$|... 'That's John Crumb,' said Roger. Hetta {{had never}} heard of John Crumb, <b>and</b> simply <b>stared</b> <b>into</b> her cousin's face. 'You have not been told about John Crumb? No;--you would not hear of him.' ...|$|R
60|$|So {{were the}} others, <b>and</b> they <b>stared</b> <b>into</b> the {{darkness}} under the apple trees in perplexity. The dog was coming closer, {{and to get}} away by running appeared {{to be out of}} the question.|$|R
50|$|A low budget {{music video}} {{was made in}} {{promotion}} of the single.
