40|$|SUMMARY: From {{strains of}} Pasteurella pseudotuberculosis {{representing}} {{each of the}} five serological groups and some Rough ’ forms, lipopolysaccharides were isolated after disintegration of acetone-dried saline extracted organisms with phenol. The materials appear to carry the specificities on which the serological classification of the species is based; they are relatively poor antigens when isolated but antigenicity can be enhanced by combining with lipoprotein. Analyses show some unusual features, an <b>aldoheptose</b> sugar being present in all of the materials and some of the ‘Smooth’ cell products contain dideoxy sugars; rhamnose is absent. The ‘Rough ’ cell products are somewhat similar in composition to the ‘Rough ’ somatic polysaccharide of Pasteurella pestis, to which they are also related serologically. The principal antigenic features and the basis of the present serological classification of Pasteurella pseudotuberculosis were established by Schiitze (1928, 1932). Strains were classified into three serological groups by bacterial agglutination, heat-stable Smooth ‘ 0 ’ somatic antigens analogous to those of the Salmonellas being postulated to account for this. Another heat-stabl...|$|E
40|$|Lipopolysaccharides (LPS, O-antigens) of 12 {{strains of}} the {{photosynthetic}} bacterium Rhodopseudomonas gelatinosa were obtained by the phenol/chloroform/petroleum ether method, recommended for extracting lipophilic glycolipids of enterobacterial R-mutants. All R. gelatinosa LPS have essentially the same chemical composition. Similar to LPS of Salmonella R-mutants of chemotypes Rd 1 and Rd 2, the sole neutral sugar constituent is an <b>aldoheptose.</b> The heptose of R. gelatinosa LPS has the D-glycero-D-manno- configuration, {{in contrast to the}} L-glycero-D-mannoheptose of enterobacterial LPS. 2 -Keto- 3 -deoxyoctonate forms the acid-labile linkage between the lipid moiety (lipid A) and the oligosaccharide moiety of R. gelatinosa LPS. Like enterobacterial lipid A, lipid A of this species contains phosphate and D-glucosamine as the sole amino sugar. The fatty acid spectrum conprises beta-hydroxycapric, lauric, and myristic acids. Beta-Hydroxymyristic acid, the typical fatty acid of enterobacterial LPS, is lacking. The R. gelatinosa LPS show O-antigenic acitivity; passive hemagglutinations with untreated or heat-treated (not well alkali-treated) LPS and antisera prepared against heat-killed cells yield high titers. According to the serological cross-reactions observed, the LPS of the 12 strains could be arranged into two different serotypes: serotype I comprising strains 29 / 1, 29 / 2, 25 / 2, and serotype II comprising strains 44 /K/ 6, 3 / 1, IS/ 10, 39 / 2, Dr 2, 2150, P 8 P 9, K 32, P 18 f 3. 1. No serological cross-reactions were observed between LPS of these two different serotypes in passive hemagglutinations...|$|E

Starting from selected <b>aldoheptoses,</b> which are readily available {{by means of the}} Kiliani&# 8211;Fischer C-elongation reaction of the corresponding aldohexoses, glycoconjugates presenting D- gluco, D- manno and D- galacto as well as GlcNAc motifs have been synthesised. Following this strategy, non-natural C -glycosyl type glycoconjugates, which can be utilised as building blocks for the composition of larger molecular constructions, are available by a very short synthetic approach...|$|R
