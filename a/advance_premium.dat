SHADAC released its second quarterly health data snapshot which covers the April-June, 2015 timeframe. Highlights of this latest health data snapshot include: From December 2013 to June 2015, Kentucky's uninsurance rate dropped from 20. 4 % to 9. 0 % - a steeper decline than that of neighboring states and {{the nation as a}} whole. Medicaid funded thousands of preventive services during the quarter, including more than 10, 000 breast cancer screenings. Over 9, 000 of these breast cancer screenings were among Medicaid expansion enrollees, and nearly 1, 200 were among traditional Medicaid enrollees. Children obtained the majority of Medicaid's dental visits, representing 66 % of the more than 250, 000 dental visits provided during the quarter (among Kentuckians ages 0 - 64). The proportion of marketplace (kynect) enrollees receiving premium assistance in the form of <b>advance</b> <b>premium</b> tax credits was lower than the national proportion (approx. 70 % in Kentucky compared to around 84 % for the nation). Kentucky's 11. 4 percentage point drop in the rate of uninsured residents continued to outpace neighboring states (Illinois, Indiana, Missouri, Ohio, Tennessee, Virginia and West Virginia) which averaged a 5. 2 percentage point drop.

40|$|The tort crisis, {{sometimes}} called the insurance crisis, still afflicts us. Although today some commentators are claiming that the crisis has subsided, they are confusing the recent softening within some insurance lines with the long-term, perhaps permanent, changes in underlying insured activity that has made possible the softening. The playground equipment removed from public parks and the diving boards removed from city schools have not been replaced. The large numbers of products withdrawn from consumer markets remain withdrawn. The huge premium increases of early 1986 are largely intact, thus, necessitating continued price increases and sustaining diminished consumer demand for insured products and services. Many manufacturers, service-providers, and, especially, municipalities no longer openly complain about insurance unavailability because they have continued operations either without market insurance by self-insuring or by joining mutual insurance groups. This adjustment, however, no more than delays the impact of increased tort liability. These entities have chosen to put off paying <b>advance</b> <b>premiums</b> equal to expected liability only to suffer actual liability once it occurs. The single most important phenomenon of the recent tort crisis, crucial for its diagnosis, is {{the withdrawal of the}} insurance industry from the business of insurance. The withdrawal of the industry is obvious with respect to those few insurance lines for which market insurers have refused to offer coverage altogether: nurse-midwives, day care, municipal liability. But the withdrawal from the insurance business is reflected in other, more widespread, changes in commercial casualty insurance offerings. In particular, the adoption of the claims-made as the basic commercial casualty policy, the general increase in retention (insured deductibles), the decline in levels of aggregate coverage, and the introduction of specific coverage exclusions reflect such changes...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{provides}} {{a theory of}} rationing where rationing functions as an effective mechanism for second degree price discrimination by a monopoly seller. When a seller charges multiple prices on homogenous products to all consumers, supply at the lowest price is limited and rationed among consumers. The supply shortage differentiates products sold at the lowest price and those sold at a higher price. When high-valuation consumers identify themselves at the higher price, the seller may extract more consumer surplus and increase his profit. In the paper, we address two common rationing-based price discrimination strategies, multiple-price menu and <b>premium</b> <b>advance</b> selling [...] We also show that rationing-based price discrimination can be combined with other classical price discrimination strategies to further increase the seller’s profit. ...|$|R

The extent of its growth and usage raises {{critical}} issues associated with its design principles {{that need to be}} addressed before it reaches its limits. Many emerging applications have increasing requirements in terms of bandwidth, QoS and manageability. Moreover, applications such as Cloud computing and 3 D-video streaming require optimization and combined provisioning of different infrastructure resources and services that include both network and IT resources. Demands become more and more sporadic and variable, making dynamic provisioning highly needed. As a huge energy consumer, the Internet also needs to be energy-conscious.

40|$|The {{failure of}} {{uncovered}} interest rate parity (UIP) {{is a well-known}} phenomenon of the last thirty years. UIP failure is more prominent in advanced economies than in emerging market economies. Typically, UIP estimation for an advanced economy generates a negative coefficient, meaning that a higher interest rate in advanced economy A {{will result in the}} appreciation of economy A's exchange rate. For emerging market economies, higher interest rates usually correspond to future depreciation, although this depreciation is not sufficient for UIP to hold. This paper shows that UIP holds in Russia better than in other emerging market economies when the UIP equation accounts for a constant risk premium. Consequently, there is no forward premium puzzle for Russian data for 2001 – 2014. To determine the results for Russia and to compare them with the results for other countries, we estimate UIP first for Russia and then for advanced and emerging market economies using seemingly unrelated regressions and panel data analysis. By comparing the profitability of static and dynamic carry trade strategies, we also confirm that in emerging market economies, risk premiums are often constant, whereas in <b>advanced</b> economies, risk <b>premiums</b> are almost always volatile. This may explain why UIP holds better in emerging market economies. It also enables us to formulate a hypothesis that macroeconomic policies of emerging market economies (e. g., the accumulation of large foreign exchange reserves) stabilize risk premiums...|$|R

There are, {{be that as}} it may, negative social acknowledgments about data mining, among which potential security assault and potential partition. The last embodies preposterously treating people on the reason of their having a spot with a specific social event. Computerized information gathering and information mining methods, for example, order principle mining have prepared to settling on mechanized choices, {{in the same way as}} <b>advance</b> giving/dissent, protection <b>premium</b> reckoning, and so on. In the event that the preparation information sets are one-sided in what respects prejudicial (touchy) properties like sex, race, religion, and so forth., oppressive choices may follow. Consequently, antidiscrimination methods including segregation revelation and counteractive action have been presented in information mining. Separation can be either immediate or roundabout. Direct separation happens when choices are made taking into account touchy traits. Backhanded segregation happens when choices are made in view of nonsensitive qualities which are firmly connected with one-sided touchy ones. In this paper, we handle separation counteractive action in information mining and propose new procedures relevant for immediate or aberrant segregation avoidance exclusively or both in the meantime. We examine how to clean preparing information sets and outsourced information sets in such a route, to the point that direct and/or backhanded oppressive choice principles are changed over to authentic (nondiscriminatory) arrangement rules. We likewise propose new measurements to assess the utility of the proposed methodologies and we think about these methodologies. The trial assessments show that the proposed methods are viable at evacuating direct and/or roundabout separation predispositions in the first information set while saving information quality...|$|R

Dissertations, Academic [...] University of Missouri [...] Columbia [...] Economics. "May 2012 "This dissertation comprises three essays on the same topic: advance selling of new to-be-released products. The first essay studies the retailer's optimal strategy in a model where the demand uncertainty comes from both the market size and the distribution of consumers' valuations. I find that there are three types of advance selling strategies: advance selling at a deep discount, advance selling at a moderate discount and no advance selling. I also characterize the conditions under which the retailer adopts advance selling and perform comparative statics analysis. The second essay studies the retailer's optimal advance selling strategy in a model with the presence of experienced consumers. We divide consumers into two groups, experienced and inexperienced. Pre-orders from experienced consumers lead to a more precise forecast of future demand by the firm. We show that the firm will always adopt advance selling and that the optimal pre-order price {{may or may not be}} at a discount to the regular selling price. The third essay investigates advance selling at a price premium. I show that advance selling at a price premium always yields more profit for the retailer compared with advance selling at the regular selling price. In addition, I analyze conditions under which the retailer is more likely to implement advance selling at a price premium instead of a price discount. Sensitivity analysis is also presented to show how the retailer's optimal <b>advance</b> selling price <b>premium</b> and optimal total profit are affected by some important parameters in the model...|$|R
40|$|The {{deployment}} of optical fibre {{in place of}} copper cable in access networks has experienced remarkable growth {{over the past several}} years due to a wide range of benefits. A major benefit of optical fibre over copper cable is that it is more secure and immune to electromagnetic interferences. Optical fibre has also provided the capability of handling higher throughputs for longer distances, and experiences no crosstalk between other fibre optic cables. However, the last mile reach to end-users with optical fibre is very costly. This alternative replacement results in increased costs for manual labour and energy consumption in the access network. The current demand in all areas of telecommunications, and especially access networks, is greener networking. In order to offset the high costs of optical access implementations and to satisfy this demand, an investigation into integrated wireless optical access networks (IWOAN) is warranted. The proliferation of wireless devices has also motivated the interest in IWOAN as it combines the flexibility and efficiency of wireless with the security and stability provided by optical. With the emergence of smart phones and tablets, wireless access networks are now supporting an increasing amount of traffic volume with improved throughput and accessibility. We employ a Passive Optical Network (PON) infrastructure from the central office to the customer, traced from the Optical Line Terminal (OLT) to the customer premises devices known as Optical Network Units (ONUs) for IWOAN. At the ONU, the optical fibre is terminated and wireless communication is implemented. The ONU acts as a wireless access point/gateway for wireless Base Stations (BS) serving different coverage areas in point-to-point topology. With recent trends of <b>advanced</b> wireless technologies, <b>premium</b> rich applications such as multimedia streaming, interactive gaming and cloud computing are delivered in a satisfactory and economic way. This wireless-optical integration aims to reduce and solve the cost of replacing copper cables. However, another issue is raised with increased costs in energy consumption due to the integration of wireless and optical communication. Typically a large number of ONUs need to be deployed in order to serve many wireless BSs located in different coverage areas. As a result, any cost savings gained by the integration process is exhausted with the increased cost of power consumption...|$|R
40|$|Advance selling {{occurs when}} sellers allow buyers to {{purchase}} {{at a time}} preceding consumption (Shugan and Xie 2000). Electronic tickets, smart cards, online prepayments, and other technological advances make advance selling possible for many, if not all, service providers. These technologies {{lower the cost of}} making complex transactions at a greater distance from the seller's site. They also give sellers more control over advance selling by decreasing arbitrage. As technology enhances the capability to advance sell, more academic attention is vital. This paper strives to exploit these technologies by developing advance-selling strategies. Until recently, advance-selling research focused on the airline industry and specific characteristics of that industry. These characteristics included the price insensitivity of late arrivals (e. g., business travelers) compared with early arrivals (e. g., leisure travelers), demand uncertainty across flights on the same day, and capacity constraints. Recent findings by Shugan and Xie (2000) show that advance selling is a far more general marketing tool than previously thought. It does not require these industry-specific characteristics. It only requires the existence of buyer uncertainty about future valuations. Moreover, sellers without the ability to price discriminate can use advance selling to improve profits to the level of first-degree price discrimination. This finding is important because buyers are nearly always uncertain about their future valuations for most services (e. g., the utility of next year's vacation or a future college education). In this paper, we take the next step from Shugan and Xie (2000). We show that advance-selling profits do not come from buyer surplus, but from more buyers being able to purchase. We determine when and how to advance sell in a variety of situations, including situations with limited capacity, second-period arrivals, refunds, buyer risk aversion, exogenous credibility, continuous preference distributions, and premium pricing. We determine when advance selling improves profits and, when it does, how to set advance prices. We ask and answer seven questions. First, when should sellers advance sell? Second, how much can advance selling improve profits compared with only spot selling? Third, what factors impact the profitability of advance selling and how? Fourth, should advance prices be higher or lower or the same as spot prices? Fifth, how do capacity constraints impact advance-selling strategies? Sixth, should sellers limit the number of advance sales? Finally, what is the possible impact of buyer risk aversion? First, we provide precise conditions when sellers should advance sell. For example, without capacity constraints, we show that sellers should advance sell when marginal costs are sufficiently low to make it profitable to sell to buyers with low valuations and sufficiently high to convince buyers that the spot price will be higher than the advance price. Second, we find that advance selling can almost double the profits from optimal spot selling to early arrivals. We also show that advance selling has no impact on consumer surplus in markets with homogenous consumers and no capacity constraints. Therefore, advance selling can increase social welfare because seller profits increase. Third, we find that two very important factors impacting the profitability of advance selling are seller credibility and marginal costs. Buyers only advance buy when they expect an advantage from advance buying over spot buying. Without capacity constraints, sellers must credibly convince buyers that the advance price is at a discount to the spot price. We show that this condition is met under different circumstances. For example, large marginal costs can create credibility because buyers believe that these costs will lead to high spot prices. Fourth, we find (although optimal advance prices can be at a discount to the spot price) that sometimes a premium is optimal. Premiums are optimal when capacity is large (but limited) and marginal costs are not too large. Buyers advance purchase at a premium to spot prices when capacity is limited and spot prices are low. (Note {{that this is not a}} risk premium, and risk aversion is not required.) No prior research has suggested this strategy because that research relies on the assumption that early arrivals are more price sensitive than later ones. Without that assumption, <b>premium</b> <b>advance</b> pricing is sometimes optimal. Fifth, we find that binding capacity constraints can impact the profitability of advance selling in opposite ways. On one hand, capacity constraints create seller credibility. Buyers believe that spot prices will be high when they know spot capacity is limited (and, perhaps, more limited by advance sales). On the other hand, when capacity is limited, the need to increase sales from discounted advance prices diminishes. Sixth, consistent with Desiraju and Shugan (1999) we find that limiting advance sales can be profitable, but only under restrictive conditions. These conditions are: (1) selling to all early arrivals would leave insufficient capacity in the spot period to sell to all second-period arrivals with high valuations, (2) the optimal spot price is high, and (3) marginal costs are sufficiently small to make advance selling profitable. Finally, we find that buyer risk aversion can sometimes increase the profitability of advance selling. Our findings provide precise guidelines for a large number of service providers that will have the technical capability to advance sell. For those service providers, advance selling provides a creative pricing strategy that can potentially provide substantial improvements in profits.
