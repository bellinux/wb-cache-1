5|$|Relations between Parthia and Greco-Bactria {{deteriorated}} {{after the}} death of Diodotus II, when Mithridates' forces captured two eparchies of the latter kingdom, then under Eucratides I (r. c.170–145BC). Turning his sights on the Seleucid realm, Mithridates invaded Media <b>and</b> <b>occupied</b> Ecbatana in 148 or 147BC; the region had been destabilized by a recent Seleucid suppression of a rebellion there led by Timarchus. This victory was followed by the Parthian conquest of Babylonia in Mesopotamia, where Mithridates had coins minted at Seleucia in 141BC and held an official investiture ceremony. While Mithridates retired to Hyrcania, his forces subdued the kingdoms of Elymais and Characene <b>and</b> <b>occupied</b> Susa. By this time, Parthian authority extended as far east as the Indus River.|$|E
