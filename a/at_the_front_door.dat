5|$|Other {{spirits are}} also said {{to remain at}} The Octagon as well. Dolley Madison's spirit has been seen near the {{fireplace}} in the main ballroom as well as heading through a closed door to the garden, and her ghost's presence is accompanied {{by the smell of}} lilacs, her favorite flower. A slave girl in the house was allegedly thrown from the third floor landing to the first floor below and killed by a British soldier during the War of 1812, and eyewitnesses have reported hearing her scream. The specter of a British soldier in War of 1812 dress was seen by caretaker James Cypress in the 1950s, and museum superintendent Alric H. Clay claimed that in the 1960s spirits would often turn on the lights and open The Octagon's doors late at night. A gambler shot to death in the house's third-floor bedroom in the late 19th century has sometimes been seen still in the bed he died in, and ghostly footmen have been seen <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>door</b> waiting to receive guests. He was said to have rung a bell shortly before his death and that the ring of the bell often heard in the house is from him. Various witnesses have also reported hearing assorted moans, screams, and footsteps.|$|E

25|$|In 1871, two stone lions {{were placed}} <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>door</b> of the Fourth Avenue Building, {{as symbols of}} {{guardianship}} of the people’s money. The stately lions guarding the entrance were sculpted by Max Kohler, each from a single block of quarry-bedded brownstone. A project to restore the lions began in September 2009 and was completed in June 2013. The two new exact replica lions were created by Master Carver Nicolas Fairplay. The original lions sit inside the Fourth Avenue building.|$|E

Before either mother or father can react, the children shoot their parents to death. Thinking that mom and dad are playing dead, the young boy and girl rush off outside to find another game.|$|E
25|$|Zavistonovičius {{first went}} to the most distant farm from his house. Its owner, Jonas Bareikas, {{was shot and killed}} in his bed.

Afterwards, he {{approached}} Bareikas' neighbour Leonas Garbatavičius, whom he shot dead <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>door</b> of his house. His next stop was at the Vrubliauskas farm, where he killed Vytautas Vrubliauskas and wounded his mother Jadvyga and sister Zofija. Zofija Vrubliauskaitė, who lived in Širvintos and came to visit the family on the weekend, died the same night in Širvintos hospital while undergoing surgery. Jadvyga Vrubliauskienė died a week later in Vilnius Red Cross Hospital.|$|E
50|$|Traditionally, stables in Great Britain had a hayloft {{on their}} first (i.e. upper) floor and a {{pitching}} <b>door</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>front.</b> <b>Doors</b> and windows were symmetrically arranged. Their interiors were divided into stalls and usually included a large stall for a foaling mare or sick horse. The floors were cobbled (or, later, bricked) and featured drainage channels. Outside steps {{to the first floor}} were common for farm hands to live in the building.|$|R

25|$|The Green Line is {{the most}} heavily {{traveled}} light rail line in the United States, {{with an average of}} 230,000 riders each weekday. Because of this heavy ridership, at selected stops on the Green Line the MBTA implemented a system known as Show-N-Go, which allows riders to flash their monthly passes and enter through the rear doors of a train, reducing congestion <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>door.</b> This worked well when monthly passes were on paper tickets, as each month's pass differed visually from the previous month, but became an issue when the MBTA encouraged riders to store their monthly passes on their CharlieCards, as passes held this way cannot be verified visually.|$|E
25|$|The Octagon Drawing Room (7 {{on first}} floor plan) completes the short enfilade {{beginning}} <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>door.</b> It {{is the principal}} room of the house. Unfinished by Carr, the room has an ornate gilded ceiling with recessed panels in the Italian Renaissance style, installed in 1840. Of the room's eight sides, three have windows forming a large bay, at the centre {{of which is a}} large Venetian window echoing the Palladian inspiration of the mansion. Throughout the 19th and 20th centuries this room was used to display the finest art its owners possessed. Today, hung with red felt, it contains works by Pompeo Batoni and Giovanni Battista Pittoni. The room contains fine neoclassical furniture, including items made to designs by Robert Adam, and curtains originally made for the state rooms of Blenheim Palace.|$|E
25|$|The betrothal is {{cancelled}} with a forged medical certificate, backdated a month, declaring Satoko to be mentally ill. In February 1914, Honda gives Kiyoaki {{money to}} travel to the convent in an effort to meet Satoko. He turns up <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>door</b> repeatedly but is always rebuffed, and his health declines as he forces himself to trudge through the snow from the inn in Obitoke to the convent and back again as a form of penance. Eventually Honda comes looking for him after receiving a telegram, and is shocked to see how ill he is; concluding that a meeting with Satoko is vital, he goes to the convent alone on February 27, but the Abbess firmly refuses to allow any such meeting, and on the same night Honda and Kiyoaki leave for Tokyo.|$|E

25|$|Of the 150 or 160 {{crates of}} silver {{known to be}} on board the vessel, 70 were {{retrieved}} by a merchant of Hirado in 1617. Later salvage efforts only turned up three bars of silver and a few trinkets in 1653, and a cannon and some silver in 1658. Modern attempts from 1928 to 1933 found another cannon (now placed <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>door</b> of the Tenri Central Library in Nara), two iron helmets, an anchor, some oyster-shell window panes, an astrolabe, among others. A suspected wreck of the Nossa Senhora da Graça was discovered by the local carpenter and amateur underwater archaeologist Matsumoto Shizuo {{in the period of}} 1987–2000, 600 m from Fukuda and 45 m underwater. Matsumoto erected a life-sized Virgin Mary statue in the nearest island of Matsushima (松島) to commemorate the occasion.|$|E
25|$|On {{the night}} of October 14, 1880, Bull, now partnered with gambler Jim Moon, became {{involved}} in an altercation with two city policemen. Moon's wife and another {{woman who had been}} dating Bull also became involved, throwing chinaware at the officers, causing them to retreat. Bull and Moon met the officers, who returned with more policemen, <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>door,</b> pistols drawn, but after seeing that they could not win, both Bull and Moon surrendered. Less than a month later, Moon killed a man named Sam Hall by beating him on the head with his pistol. He was acquitted on the grounds of self defense in the trial that followed. Seven months later, Moon, a jealous man, attacked a gambler named Clay Wilson, believing Wilson was paying too much attention to his (Moon's) wife. Wilson shot Moon twice, killing him.|$|E
500|$|Today, GO Transit {{operates}} {{a combination of}} single-level coach buses and commuter-type double-decker buses. All buses are equipped with bike racks and are wheelchair accessible. Most of the older buses in the fleet are , single-level D4500CT coach buses built by Motor Coach Industries, which can seat 57 people and features a wheelchair lift for disabled users. The first models of this type entered service in 2001 and orders have continued until 2015. In April 2008, GO began operating [...] Enviro 500 double-decker buses built by British manufacturer Alexander Dennis in the United Kingdom.

2500|$|The 1950 Imperial was {{essentially}} a New Yorker with a custom interior.

Unlike the standard Imperial, the Imperial Crown had a side treatment in which the rear fender moldings and stone guard were separate. Body sill moldings were used on all Imperials, but were of a less massive type on the more massive Crown models. A special version of the limousine was available. It featured a unique leather interior and a leather-covered top that blacked out the rear quarter windows. Power windows were standard on the Imperial Crown [...]|$|R

500|$|Following Katz, {{the vast}} {{majority}} of Fourth Amendment search cases have turned on the right to privacy, but in United States v. Jones (2012), the Court ruled that the Katz standard did not replace earlier case law, but rather, has supplemented it. In Jones, law enforcement officers had attached a GPS device on a car's exterior without Jones' knowledge or consent. The Court concluded that Jones was a bailee to the car, and so had a property interest in the car. Therefore, since the intrusion on the vehicle—a common law trespass—was for the purpose of obtaining information, the Court ruled that it was a search under the Fourth Amendment. The Court used similar [...] "trespass" [...] reasoning in Florida v. Jardines (2013), to rule that bringing a drug detection dog to sniff <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>door</b> of a home was a search.|$|E
500|$|On 14 December 1962 Keeler and Rice-Davies were {{together}} at 17 Wimpole Mews when Edgecombe arrived, demanding to see Keeler.

In brief press accounts, Keeler was described as [...] "a free-lance model" [...] and [...] "Miss Marilyn Davies" [...] as [...] "an actress". [...] In the wake of the incident, Keeler began to talk indiscreetly about Ward, Profumo, Ivanov and the Edgecombe shooting. Among those to whom she told her story was John Lewis, a former Labour MP whom she had met by chance in a night club. Lewis, a long-standing enemy of Ward, passed the information to his one-time parliamentary colleague George Wigg, who began his own investigation.|$|E

50|$|This time, {{apart from}} the {{standard}} and 90 stages of tune, there was also, for a brief time, a Brabham SL/90 HB that was purported to have been developed {{with the aid of}} world racing champion Jack Brabham. Brabham models were marked out externally by distinctive lateral black stripes <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> of <b>the</b> bonnet that curved down the wings and then headed back to end in a taper <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>doors.</b> This model is almost impossible to find today. This model and the Viva GT are the two most sought after models made. The Brabham model differed from the standard Viva SL/90 in having a different cam-shaft, uprated suspension with anti-roll bars, different exhaust manifolds, and a unique twin-carb manifold, as well as differing interior trim. The Viva GT had substantially different engine and running gear and interior from the standard Viva HB models. It was distinguished by having a black bonnet with twin louvres and being all-over white. Later GTs came in different colours.|$|R

The two were part of a gang of at least a dozen men who had headed off to beat up Wessel. They went to the flat, where Wessel, who was expecting a visit from the leader of another SA Sturm group, opened the door. Wessel was shot almost immediately, although it was later claimed that Wessel had attempted to pull out a gun, and therefore had been shot in self-defense; this was denied by eyewitnesses, who said that Wessel did not have time enough to react. The attackers searched the room, removed a pistol from the wardrobe and a rubber truncheon, and then fled the scene, meeting up {{with the rest of the}} men in the street.

500|$|The {{music video}} follows the storyline of the song's lyrics. [...] "She {{told me to}} pack up all my stuff, I'm getting kicked out—the video starts off like that", said Roache. It opens with Beyoncé filing her nails in silence, as her ex-partner packs up his property, as Beyoncé orders him to leave. Mid-way in the video, Beyoncé follows her then-ex-boyfriend outside the house and leans on a 2007 Jaguar XK. She appears to be pretentiously caressing him; only for the {{audience}} {{to find out that}} she is repossessing things she bought for him. He leaves her and the car, about to ride off in a taxi. Between cuts, Beyoncé manages herself in front of a mirror; putting on a lipstick, wearing huge curlers and a high-waisted skirt. There are additional beats mixed to the arrangement for the video version that can be heard, when Beyoncé sings with her all-female band, Suga Mama, towards the end. It ends with Beyoncé greeting her new boyfriend <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>door.</b>|$|E

Realizing that the couple are actually pagan gods, Sam and Dean break into their home, finding human remains in the basement. However, they are captured by the Carrigans and tied to chairs in the kitchen. The gods reveal {{that they have been}} attempting to blend into human society, reducing their annual sacrifices to only a few. They begin preparing Sam and Dean to be sacrificed, but are interrupted by a neighbor <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>door.</b> When the Carrigans return, they find that the brothers have broken free. Knowing that the gods can be killed by evergreen wood, Sam and Dean stab them to death with branches of the Christmas tree. Later on, Dean is surprised to find that Sam has decorated their motel room with Christmas paraphernalia. They exchange gifts, all which were bought from the local gas station, and happily watch a football game on TV.|$|E
