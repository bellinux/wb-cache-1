The findings of the study showed that principals follow the budget guideline specifications in planning and implementing budget, but do not buy science equipment, maintain school vehicles, buildings and furniture, they do not organize workshops, seminars and conferences, and do not defend budget with their bursars. Based on the above findings, it was recommended among others, that Nigerian principals should work cooperatively with their staff.

40|$|I {{analyze the}} optimal design of banking {{supervision}} {{in the presence}} of cross-border lending. Cross-border lending could imply that an individual bank failure in one country could trigger negative spillover effects in another country. Such cross-border contagion effects {{could turn out to be}} important in the EU because national banking problems could easily spread via the highly integrated interbank market. I show that if benevolent supervisors are accountable only to their own jurisdiction, they will not take cross-border contagion effects into <b>account.</b> <b>Supervisors</b> with such a national mandate fail to implement the optimum from a supranational perspective. In consequence, the probability of a bank failure will be inefficiently high. Against the background of this result, I argue in favor of institutionalizing an EU ”Supervisory Coordination Authority” to which national supervisors are accountable. banking supervision, systemic risk, cross-border contagion...|$|R
40|$|Purpose - The {{purpose of}} this paper is to discuss the impact of an Enterprise Resources Planning (ERP) system on the role of accountants, to provide job {{qualifications}} for their reference. Design/methodology/approach - This research adopts the case study method, using on-the-spot interviews and a questionnaire to find out the effects of an ERP system on the role of accountants. Findings - The role of accountants is mainly to be transaction data handlers and financial report providers. Clearly, accountants must have certain degree of knowledge in the realm of traditional finance accounting. In addition, <b>accounting</b> <b>supervisors</b> think implementing an ERP system changes the role of accountants. Research limitations/implications - The data collected by the authors are mainly from the Shanghai Financial Center and regional businesses in Shanghai, Beijing and Taiwan. The authors are only able to study the impact of ERP systems on the role of accountants in the short-term rather than in the long-term. Originality/value - It is widely accepted that an ERP system is more than just an accounting information system, so implementing an ERP system will not necessarily promote the positions of the accounting department and accountants on the subjective cognition of accountants. Accountants need to have knowledge of financial accounting, IT and management after ERP implementation...|$|R

40|$|A {{recent and}} rapid {{increase}} in U. S. listed Chinese firms has occurred since the 1990 ’s, with at least 495 firms attempting to raise capital on U. S. listing boards. This means of fundraising has allowed investors {{to participate in the}} opportunities provided by China’s growth, while enjoying the perceived benefits of the U. S. regulatory oversight. One such regulatory requirement is compliance with the provisions of the Sarbanes Oxley Act of 2002, which is largely focused on the internal controls of publically listed firms. This study examines the internal control effectiveness and associated characteristics of 198 U. S. listed Chinese firms, for the fiscal year 2009. With the use of Sarbanes Oxley Section 302 data, this study provides support for a number of previous studies and contributes new findings to the academic literature relating to audit committee financial expertise and CEO duality. This study also provides interesting findings regarding the impact of regulatory environments, when the sample listing type is divided into direct listed firms and cross listed firms. Specifically, this study finds that with U. S. listed Chinese firms, higher percentages of audit committee <b>accounting,</b> <b>supervisor</b> and user financial expertise are positively associated with internal control effectiveness. This study next finds that for direct listed firms, only higher percentages of audit committee accounting and user financial expertise are positively associated with internal control effectiveness. Finally, this study finds that for direct listed firms, CEO duality is negatively associated with internal control effectiveness. published_or_final_versionBusinessDoctoralDoctor of Philosoph...|$|R

The Coleco Cabbage Patch Kids had large, round vinyl heads (originally of a different, hard plastic), and soft fabric bodies, and were produced from 1982 to 1989, many at a factory in Amsterdam, New York. The first two years production was all from the Far East, with nine head variations produced and computer-matched with bodies to ensure each doll was [...] "different." [...] It was, in fact a marketing ploy that worked quite well as a wide range of variations resulted.

50|$|Public {{relations}} (PR) is {{the practice}} of managing the spread of information between an individual or an organization (such as a business, government agency, or a nonprofit organization) and the public. Public relations may include an organization or individual gaining exposure to their audiences using topics of public interest and news items {{that do not require}} direct payment. This differentiates it from advertising as a form of marketing communications. Public relations is the idea of creating coverage for clients for free, rather than marketing or advertising. An example of good public relations would be generating an article featuring a client, rather than paying for the client to be advertised next to the article. The aim of public relations is to inform the public, prospective customers, investors, partners, employees, and other stakeholders and ultimately persuade them to maintain a positive or favorable view about the organization, its leadership, products, or political decisions. Public relations professionals typically work for PR and marketing firms, businesses and companies, government, and public officials as PIOs and nongovernmental organizations, and nonprofit organizations. Jobs central to public relations include account coordinator, account executive, <b>account</b> <b>supervisor,</b> and media relations manager. Public relation is an action of convincing people. The PR person talks with others that make them think about the things the person wants them to think, and the people regard the person as their believes. Public relation helps people to build up the connection to media and society that they can talk steadily.|$|E

40|$|The {{increasing}} number of master's degrees in accounting as well as specialist MBA's mean that an understanding of research methods is now {{an important part of}} the toolkit of accounting educators. In the literature there has been an increasing interest in qualitative accounting research. Whilst this interest has been mirrored by an increase in qualitative methods textbooks, less is known about the experience of undertaking such research. This presents a problem for educators, as they need material for students to work with and analyse before they are able to design their own research projects. This paper presents a case study based upon an extensive piece of qualitative research concerned with the use of accounting information in decision-making processes in banking.

However, there is lack of consensus between researchers in identifying occupational accident indirect cost components. This study proposed {{an assessment of the}} indirect cost model by using confirmatory factor analysis (CFA). In total, there are 344 cases (which occurred between 2008 and 2013) were considered in developing the model and those cases were obtained from six different sectors in manufacturing industry. Data collection process involves reviewing previous accident record in that particular company. Besides, several interview sessions with site safety officers, representatives from human resource and <b>account</b> department, <b>supervisors</b> and operators were conducted in order to estimate each of indirect cost components. Both approaches also known as local specific approach. Then, CFA is performed to validate the model proposed by examining the relationship between observed variable and its latent construct. The observed variables are productivity loss, worker replacement cost, administration and legal cost, investigation cost, machine and equipment damage cost and product damage cost whereas latent construct used in this study is accident indirect cost. The CFA result shows that the occupational accident indirect cost model has acceptable goodness of fit. In conclusion, indirect cost components are productivity loss, worker replacement cost, administration and legal cost, investigation cost, machine and equipment damage cost and product damage cost...|$|R
