2500|$|On 16 June Siemens and Mitsubishi Heavy Industries (MHI) {{submitted}} a competing proposal in which Siemens would acquire Alstom's gas turbine activities for €3.9 billion and MHI would form {{joint ventures with}} Alstom, acquiring 40, 20 and 20% stakes in Alstom's steam and nuclear, electrical grid, and hydroelectric businesses respectively, for €3.1billion. The proposal included an additional offer to acquire a further 10% stake from shareholder Bouygues and the option to form a joint venture in rail transport. On 19 June, GE revised its bid, valuing the assets at the same price, but with a lower cash transaction value. [...] The revised bid proposed to form a 50:50 joint venture combining GE's and Alstom's renewable and electric grid business, and a 50:50 joint venture in Alstom's steam turbine and nuclear power business. GE also announced a memorandum of understanding between the two firms in the rail transport sector, where GE would sell its rail signalling business to Alstom. On 20 June, Siemens and MHI modified their offer, with MHI increasing its stake in Alstom's steam, hydro, and grid businesses to 40% in all three (total €3.9billion), and with Siemens increasing its offer by €400million to €4.3billion. Subsequently, Economy minister Arnaud Montebourg stated he would block both bids, but stated the French government was now backing the GE offer, and had given GE <b>additional</b> <b>specifications</b> regarding commitments and guarantees. It also announced it intended to take two thirds of Bouygues' shareholding (20%). [...] The Alstom board met {{the next day and}} backed GE's revised bid. On 22 June, the French state agreed terms with Bouygues, enabling the purchase of part of their shareholding in Alstom, taking a 20% stake in [...] Alstom from Bouygues before payment, with an agreement to buy the shares at a 2–5% discount on a value of a minimum of ≈€35 per share. Analysts commented Bouygues would be under pressure to make a deal with the state in order to gain positive political capital due to regulation issues the company was facing in the French telecoms sector.|$|E

50|$|In {{addition}} to the scientific article itself a brief abstract is usually required for publication. The abstract should, however, be composed to function as an autonomous text, even if some authors and readers may {{think of it as}} an almost integral part of the article. The increasing importance of well-formed autonomous abstracts may well be a consequence of the increasing use of searchable digital abstract archives, where a well-formed abstract will dramatically increase the probability for an article to be found by its optimal readership. Consequently, there is a strong recent trend toward developing formal requirements for abstracts, most often structured on the IMRAD pattern, and often with strict <b>additional</b> <b>specifications</b> of topical content items that should be considered for inclusion in the abstract. Such abstracts are often referred to as “structured abstracts”. The growing importance of abstracts in the era of computerized literature search and information overload has led some users to modify the IMRAD acronym to AIMRAD, in order to give due emphasis to the abstract.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: In {{previous}} work {{it has already}} been shown that syntax-directed and free-hand editing can be gainfully integrated into a single diagram editor. That way, the user can arrange diagram components on the screen without any restrictions in free-hand editing mode, whereas syntax-directed editing operations provide pow-erful assistance. So far, editing operations had to be specified or programmed by the editor developer. In contrast, this paper proposes an approach where diagram-specific editing operations are generated on the fly during the editing process and without any <b>additional</b> <b>specification</b> effort. These operations provably preserve the correctness of the diagram. The proposed approach requires a specification of the visual language by a hypergraph grammar...|$|R
