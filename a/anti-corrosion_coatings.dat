40|$|AbstractMany {{industries}} {{all over}} the world have special, sector-specific requirements concerning anti-corrosion protection. This contributes to large savings in corrosion-related costs, which account for about 6 % of the Gross Domestic Product in developed countries. In 1999, the General Directorate for Public Roads published, {{for the first time in}} Poland, its requirements concerning the application and acceptance of <b>anti-corrosion</b> <b>coatings</b> for steel components of road and bridge structures. They were updated in 2006. In 2010, the military department of the General Directorate for National Roads and Motorways issued anti-corrosion instructions applicable to assemblable bridge structures stored as part of the military mobilization reserves of the State. The General Directorate decided to publish them due to the openwork design of these structures and the unusual conditions of their use and storage. In 2013, the Road Management Authorities in Warsaw commissioned a catalogue of anti-corrosion technologies for structures made of thin-walled sections or sheet metal with a thickness of up to 3 mm. In particular, the catalogue focuses on highly durable <b>anti-corrosion</b> <b>coatings</b> for metal constructions of noise barriers. All these documents have been developed by the Road and Bridge Research Institute. As set out in the first two of these documents, the maximum duration of anti-corrosion protection is 15 years, in conformity with ISO 12944. The last document provides for <b>anti-corrosion</b> <b>coatings</b> with durability of over 25 years. It also pays more attention to aesthetic qualities of <b>anti-corrosion</b> <b>coatings,</b> whose colour may not change in a noticeable way during the first 10 years of their use (ΔE < 2, while the reduction of gloss may not exceed 20 %). The new coating materials are based on resins that have never been used before, such as polysiloxane resins, polyfluorinated resins, polyurea resins, new fillers and pigments. Modern, eco-friendly powder coatings (including paints with the zinc fillers) are also being used on an ever-increasing scale, especially for outdoor applications of high durability. Other new generation products include conversion coatings, which improve the adhesion and durability of systems, as well as nano-ceramic coatings, self assembling molecules, baths based on transitional metal compounds with complex-forming properties such as titanium and zirconium (also with polymers), etc. Application of these materials makes it necessary to use more and more sophisticated inspection methods and devices. This creates new requirements for professionals, from the designer and the investor to contractors and inspectors, who all need to be well aware of corrosion-related issues. The analysis of these documents focus on the development of anti-corrosion materials and anti-corrosion protection technologies.

The wear rate of PPS surfaces was reduced three times when 5 wt% boehmite was incorporated into the PPS. During exposure for 15 days at 300 C, the PPS underwent hydrothermal oxidation, leading to the substitution of sulfide linkages by the sulfite linkages.

30|$|Electroless nickel-phosphorus (Ni-P) plating {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{effective}} surface technology for Mg alloys, since it has excellent comprehensive advantages in low-cost, efficient, corrosion resistance, and wear resistance [14, 15]. Therefore, electroless Ni-P coating plays an important role in the anti-corrosion field of Mg alloys. To further improve the performance of the Ni-P coating, nanoparticles, for instance, SiC, ZrO 2, TiO 2, SiO 2, and Al 2 O 3, etc. are usually added into electroless plating bath to prepare Ni-P nanoparticle composite coatings [16 – 20]. According to previous studies [20 – 23], the performance of the Ni-P coating is effectively improved by nanoparticles. Although the Ni-P nanoparticle composite coatings have relatively high performance compared with the Ni-P coating, there are three problems that have to be noted. Firstly, nanoparticles are easy to aggregate and form the active center in the electroless plating bath, which reduces the stability of plating solution. Secondly, process parameters of composite plating bath usually determine the content and distribution of nanoparticles in the coatings, and they are also key factors for improving the properties of coatings. Thirdly, the process of nanoparticle co-deposition with Ni-P is another influence factor on coating properties. Hence, these factors are worth the attention. Nano-Al 2 O 3 particles are a cheap abrasive, which have high hardness and good chemical stability [24, 25]. It can be dispersed in the electroless nickel plating bath well. Therefore, Ni-P-Al 2 O 3 composite coatings are usually employed as <b>anti-corrosion</b> and anti-wear <b>coatings</b> to protect steel or copper substrate. However, only a few reports focused on the electroless Ni-P-Al 2 O 3 plating on magnesium alloy substrate [20, 22, 26]. Moreover, the study of the growth process of the Ni-P-Al 2 O 3 coating on Mg alloys and the stability of composite plating bath is rather rare. Therefore, more details about the performance of composite bath and co-deposition process of Ni-P-Al 2 O 3 need to be studied.|$|R
40|$|Organic {{coatings}} play {{a prominent}} economical role for protection of steel against corrosion. The driving forces {{for the development}} and application of water based coatings for corrosion protection are the challenges of increasing environmental requirements and the compliance with legislative regulations. In terms of these requirements, anti-corrosive coatings, based on polymer dispersions, e. g. acrylates and acrylate co-polymers, may offer best preconditions since they have further advantages concerning toxicity and work hygiene. Up to now polymer dispersions show intrinsic weaknesses in anti-corrosive behaviour. Especially in contrast to coatings, based on two-pack EP binders, coatings with polymer dispersions reveal low performance under salt spray conditions, according to corrosivity categories {{greater than or equal}} to C 3. One objective of this study is the search for the causes of these weaknesses, in order to find out principles or criteria for selecting polymer dispersions with a high anticorrosive potential for coatings. The other approach is to study specific contributions and synergies of fillers and anticorrosive pigments. Functional additives and their structure/property-relationships with polymer dispersions for significantly improving the barrier properties of coatings are studied as well. Derived from the frequently occurring failure modes, i. e. blistering and undercreepage due to cathodic delamination, another focus of this work is on the question, how to block the pathways for water, electrolytes and oxygen through the coating film and along the interface between coating film and steel surface, to improve the lateral barrier against cathodic delamination. This could be done via means of better modelling of the polymer to/on the steel surface topography. Also under consideration is the role of electrolytes, trapped as traces in polymer films, as an inherent weakness of polymer dispersions, originating from the polymerization process. Within this work a screening with over ten different polymer dispersions, based on styrene acrylates, formulated in three variants, is performed. The formulated coatings are applied to blasted steel surfaces. After standardized drying, the coated samples are tested with standard short-time corrosion tests, under salt spray and condensation-water atmosphere. The undercreepage on defined scribes, respectively the extent of blistering on the coating surface, were evaluated as a function of polymer dispersion type, pigmentation, anticorrosion pigment, film thickness, and single or two layer systems. Studies of water and electrolyte penetration through the polymer film to and along the interfaces between steel and organic coating with EIS, SKP and sorption kinetics measurements will give insights into the start, progress and extent of the corrosion process and are a measure for the estimation of the corrosion protection performance of the system. These results can help to identify the main factors of polymer dispersions influencing the <b>anti-corrosion</b> properties of <b>coatings,</b> and, in addition, important indications for paint producers and suppliers of polymer dispersions can be derived...|$|R

However, poor processability of polythiophenes caused by their low solubility in solvents has impeded their practical applications. Even after grafting flexible hydrocarbon chains onto the polymer backbone, their solubility in most of organic solvents and water is too low. Despite the intensive research efforts for developing highly soluble and easily processable polythiophenes, yields of soluble polythiophenes were extremely low and/or synthetic processes demanded high costs and use of toxic solvents [9, 10].|$|E

40|$|Abstract-Al 7075 T 6 alloys {{are widely}} used in the aircraft, {{automotive}} and die and mold making industry, yet at any time aluminium components should be designed with a third body or in an harsh environment they must be protected with an overlying coating inorder to increase their useful lifespan and improve their surface performance especially in wear and corrosion. The most wide spread technique used to modify the surface properties of Al 7075 T 6 among them {{one of the most}} promosing technology is plasma spraying. It is widely used to manufacture anti- wear and <b>anti-corrosion</b> <b>coatings</b> on to a large class of bulk materials. Extreme performance and high flexibility are the Main characteristic of the coatings achievable by Plasma Spray process. In this work Nickel Carbide + Chromium Composite coating was successfully prepared and deposied with various thicknesses on the Aluminium alloy surface. Nickel Carbide + Chromium composite coating exhibits a significantly increased wear resistance property in the material. The result obtained in this work indicated that the plasma spraying method will be the promising process to coat the composite coating on aluminium based alloy...|$|E
