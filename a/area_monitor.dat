40|$|Abstract [...] With the {{deregulation}} of power industry, many tie lines between control areas are driven to operate near their maximum capacity, especially those serving heavy load centers. Wide area controllers (WACs) using wide-area or global signals can provide remote auxiliary control signals to local controllers such as automatic voltage regulators, power system stabilizers, etc to damp out inter-area oscillations. The power system is highly nonlinear system with fast changing dynamics. In {{order to have}} an efficient WAC, an online system monitor/predictor is required to provide inter-area information to the WAC from time to time. This paper presents the design of an online Wide <b>Area</b> <b>Monitor</b> (WAM) using a neural network called the Wide Area Neuroidentifier (WANI).

The SMPS values were based on a mobility size distribution assuming spherical particles using the appropriate size-dependent alveolar-deposition factors provided by the ICRP. In most cases, the two instruments showed good linear agreement. With petrol emissions and ETS, the linearity extended to over 103 μm 2 cm- 3. With printer emissions, there was good linearity up to about 300 μm 2 cm- 3 while the NSAM increasingly overestimated the surface area at higher concentrations. The presence of a nucleation event in ambient air caused the NSAM to over-estimate the surface area by a factor of 2.

40|$|Tissue Equivalent Proportional Counters (TEPCs) are {{devices that}} can measure the {{radiation}} dose levels for the mixed neutron and gamma ray fields that are encountered in nuclear facilities.

TEPC technology has great potential for use in low energy neutron fields, such as those in nuclear power plants, however, what hinders its use as a portable <b>area</b> <b>monitor</b> in such fields is its large physical size.

40|$|Abstract—Low {{frequency}} power oscillations may {{be triggered}} by many events in the system. Most oscillations are damped by the system, but undamped oscillations can lead to system collapse. Oscillations develop {{as a result of}} rotor acceleration/deceleration following a change in active power transfer from a generator. Like the operations limits, the monitoring of power system oscillating modes is a relevant aspect of power system operation and control. Unprevented low-frequency power swings can be cause of cascading outages that can rapidly extend effect on wide region. On this regard, a Wide <b>Area</b> <b>Monitoring,</b> Protection and Control Systems (WAMPCS) help in detecting such phenomena and assess power system dynamics security. The monitoring of power system electromechanical oscillations is very important in the frame of modern power system management and control.

" Given recent advances in radiation detection technology, this thesis considers how this concept could be strengthened by the use of detectors for maritime interdiction of illicit radioactive materials, a problem that spans both policy and technical issues. To address this problem, the thesis incorporates analysis of both legal and technical factors related to detection of illicit radioactive materials. It includes a comprehensive compilation and examination of the legal and institutional issues related to probable cause determination, as well as technical evaluations of a state-of-the-art remote radiation detection system known as the Adaptable Radiation <b>Area</b> <b>Monitor</b> (ARAM) to determine its suitability in supporting probable cause determinations in a maritime environment.

40|$|One of the {{emerging}} risks in the engineering and electronic industries is the exposure of workers to ultrafine particles during (micro-) welding operations, i. e., processes used for joining two metal parts heated locally, which constitute the base metal, with or without addition of another metal which is the filler metal, melted between the edges to be joined. The process is accompanied by formation of metallic fumes arising from the molten metal {{as well as by}} the emission of metal fumes of variable composition depending on the alloys welded and fused. The aim of this paper is to investigate the number, concentration and size distribution of submicron particles produced by (micro-) welding processes. Particle number size distribution is continuously measured during (micro-) welding operations by means of two instruments, i. e., Fast Mobility Particle Sizer and Nanoparticle Surface <b>Area</b> <b>Monitor.</b> The temporal variation of the particle number size distribution across the peaks evidences the strong and fast-evolving contribution of nucleation mode particles: peak values are maintained for less than 10 s.

40|$|Two long gamma-ray bursts, GRB 060505 and GRB 060614, {{occurred}} in nearby galaxies at redshifts of 0. 089 and 0. 125 respectively. Due to their proximity and durations, deep follow-up campaigns {{to search for}} supernovae (SNe) were initiated. However none were found in either case, to limits more than two orders of magnitude fainter than the prototypical GRB-associated SN, 1998 bw. It was suggested that the bursts, {{in spite of their}} durations (4 and 102 s), belonged to the population of short GRBs which {{has been shown to be}} unrelated to SNe. In the case of GRB 060614 this argument was based on a number of indicators, including the negligible spectral lag, which is consistent with that of short bursts. GRB 060505 has a shorter duration, but no spectral lag was measured. We present the spectral lag measurements of GRB 060505 using Suzakus Wide <b>Area</b> <b>Monitor</b> and the Swift Burst Alert Telescope. We find that the lag is 0. 36 +/- 0. 05 s, inconsistent with the lags of short bursts and consistent with the properties of long bursts and SN-GRBs.
