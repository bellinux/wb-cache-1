50|$|Ignition of the Argus pulsejet was {{accomplished}} using an automotive type spark plug located about 76 cm behind the intake shutters, with current supplied from a portable starting unit. Three <b>air</b> <b>nozzles</b> {{in the front}} of the pulsejet were at the same time connected to an external high-pressure air source that was used to start the engine. Acetylene gas was typically used for starting the engine, and very often a panel of wood or similar material was held across the end of the tailpipe to prevent the fuel from diffusing and escaping before ignition.The V-1 was fuelled by 625 L of 75 octane gasoline.|$|E
50|$|External mix nozzles {{contacts}} fluids {{outside the}} nozzle {{as shown in}} the schematic diagram. This type of spray nozzle may require more atomizing air and a higher atomizing air pressure drop because the mixing and atomization of liquid takes place outside the nozzle. The liquid pressure drop is lower for this type of nozzle, sometimes drawing liquid into the nozzle due to the suction caused by the atomizing <b>air</b> <b>nozzles</b> (siphon nozzle). If the liquid to be atomized contains solids an external mix atomizer may be preferred. This spray may be shaped to produce different spray patterns. A flat pattern is formed with additional air ports to flatten or reshape the circular spray cross-section discharge.|$|E

50|$|A similar type of thrust {{augmentation}} {{but using}} additional fuel burnt in a turbofan's cold bypass air only, {{instead of the}} combined cold and hot gas flows as in a conventional afterburning engine, is Plenum chamber burning (PCB), developed for the vectored thrust Bristol Siddeley BS100 engine for the Hawker Siddeley P.1154. In this engine, where the cold bypass and hot core turbine airflows are split between two sets of nozzles, front and rear, {{in the same manner}} as the Rolls-Royce Pegasus, additional fuel and afterburning was applied to the front cold <b>air</b> <b>nozzles</b> only.

5000|$|External mixing guns have {{a nozzle}} {{spraying}} {{water as a}} stream and <b>air</b> <b>nozzles</b> shooting air through this water stream to break it up into much smaller water particles. These guns are sometimes equipped {{with a set of}} internal mixing nozzles that are known as nucleators. These help create a nucleus for the water droplets to bond to as they freeze. External mixing guns are typically tower guns and rely on a longer hang time to freeze the snow. This allows them to use much less air. External mixing guns are usually reliant on high water pressure to operate correctly so the water supply is opened completely, though in some the flow can be regulated by valves on the gun.|$|E

30|$|The {{non-contact}} wettability assessment {{system was}} mainly {{composed of two}} parts: (1) an air-jet application part and (2) a part for the acquisition and analysis of liquid behavior. The air-jet application part had a compressed air line from an air compressor as an air source (PC 3 - 5.5 T; Yaezaki Kuatsu, Tokyo, Japan) to an <b>air</b> <b>nozzle</b> and the line was equipped with a pressure regulator (IR 2000 -A; SMC Corporation, Tokyo, Japan), a particle filter (ZFC 53; SMC), and solenoid valve (custom-made; SMC). Both pressures {{before and after the}} solenoid valve were monitored by pressure sensors (PSE 540; SMC). The air-jet was switched by the solenoid valve that was controlled from a laptop computer (ProBook 650 G 1; HP, Palo Alto, CA).

50|$|Regarding sound {{generated}} {{inside the}} building, {{there are two}} principal types of transmission. Firstly, airborne sound travels through walls or floor and ceiling assemblies and can emanate from either human activities in adjacent living spaces or from mechanical noise within the building systems. Human activities might include voice, noise from amplified sound systems, or animal noise. Mechanical systems are elevator systems, boilers, refrigeration or air conditioning systems, generators and trash compactors. Aerodynamic sources include fans, pneumatics, and combustion. Noise control for aerodynamic sources include quiet <b>air</b> <b>nozzles,</b> pneumatic silencers and quiet fan technology. Since many mechanical sounds are inherently loud, the principal design element is to require the wall or ceiling assembly to meet certain performance standards, (typically Sound transmission class of 50), which allows considerable attenuation of the sound level reaching occupants.|$|E

50|$|Nitro-powered cars operate like {{full-sized}} fuel vehicles {{more than}} their electric counterparts do, making use of a two stroke engine rather than an electric motor. The sound of the engine noise is a main selling points to nitro enthusiasts, even though brushless electric equivalents are generally faster and do not require special fuel. However, their exhaust contains unburned oil, which usually ends up coating the chassis. This, in turn, requires more cleaning than an electric-powered equivalent. Cleaning is usually achieved {{by the use of}} compressed <b>air</b> <b>nozzles</b> and solvents (such as denatured alcohol). Tuning a fuel-powered vehicle requires learning to maintain optimum performance and fuel economy, and to minimize engine wear and overheating, even in ready-to-run vehicles. Running a nitro-fuel motor without tuning or tuning improperly can hurt performance in rich conditions, and cause severe damage in lean conditions.|$|E

Compared with the BE, the MFSE could produce nanofibers under a much higher applied voltage which would result in decreasing the nanofiber diameter, enhancing the diameter distribution, and improving the nanofiber throughput.|$|R

5000|$|Air knife designs {{today have}} evolved to where some {{manufacturers}} produce a very efficient “teardrop” shape with a [...]95 coefficient of discharge. These blower-powered air knife designs typically have a profile of approximately 3.5 in wide x 5.5 in tall x any length, but the teardrop profile can range from 1.5 to 10 in tall depending on the criteria of the product for which the impact air velocity must be engineered. With construction ranging from 1/8 in thick aluminum extrusion to 11 gauge fabricated stainless steel, air knives can weigh 1 lb/ft to 25 lbs/ft. Depending on the width and speed of the product, the air knife can provide effective blow-off performance from 0.5 to 12 in or more away {{from the surface of}} the product.

5000|$|In a CFB combustor, coal {{or other}} fuels, air, and crushed {{limestone}} or other sorbents are {{injected into the}} lower portion of the combustor for initial burning of the fuel. The combustion actually occurs in a bed of fuel, sorbent, and ash particles that are fluidized by <b>air</b> <b>nozzles</b> {{in the bottom of}} the combustor. The air expands the bed, creates turbulence for enhanced mixing, and provides most of the oxygen necessary for combustion of the fuel. As the fuel particles decrease in size through combustion and breakage, they are transported higher in the combustor where additional air is injected. As the particles continue to decrease in size, unreacted fuel, ash, and fine limestone particles are swept out of the combustor, collected in a particle separator (also called a cyclone), and recycled to the lower portion of the combustor. This is the [...] "circulating" [...] nature of the combustor. Drains {{in the bottom of the}} combustor remove a fraction of the bed composed primarily of ash while new fuel and sorbent are added. The combustion ash is suitable for beneficial uses such as road construction material, agricultural fertilizer, and reclaiming surface mining areas.|$|E
50|$|Ignition was {{initiated}} by an automotive-type spark plug located about 0.75 m behind the shutter system, electricity to the plug being supplied from a portable starting unit. Three <b>air</b> <b>nozzles</b> {{in the front}} of the pulse jet were connected to an external high pressure air source which was used to start the engine. Acetylene was used for starting, and very often a panel of wood or similar was held across the end of the tailpipe to prevent the fuel from diffusing and escaping before ignition was complete.Once the engine had been started and the temperature rose to the minimum operating level, the external air hose and connectors were removed and the resonant design of the tailpipe kept the pulse jet firing. Each cycle or pulse of the engine began with the shutters open; fuel was injected behind them and ignited, and the resulting expansion of gases forced the shutters closed. As the pressure in the engine dropped following combustion, the shutters reopened and the cycle was repeated, roughly 45 to 55 times per second. The electrical ignition system was needed only to start the engine - a V-1 carried no coils or magnetos to power the spark plug once launched.|$|E
