5|$|Born in 1541, {{in either}} the village of Fodele or Candia (the Venetian name of Chandax, present day Heraklion) on Crete, El Greco was descended from a prosperous urban family, which had {{probably}} been driven out of Chania to Candia after an uprising against the Catholic Venetians between 1526 and 1528. El Greco's father, Geórgios Theotokópoulos (d. 1556), was a merchant and tax collector. Nothing is known <b>about</b> <b>his</b> <b>mother</b> or his first wife, also Greek. El Greco's older brother, Manoússos Theotokópoulos (1531– 13 December 1604), was a wealthy merchant and spent {{the last years of}} his life (1603–1604) in El Greco's Toledo home.|$|E

5|$|As {{an adult}} Reich wrote extensively, in his diary, about his sexual precocity. He {{maintained}} {{that his first}} sexual experience was {{at the age of}} four when he tried to have sex with the family maid (with whom he shared a bed), that he would regularly watch the farm animals have sex, that he used a whip handle sexually on the horses while masturbating, and that he had almost daily sexual intercourse from the age of 11 with another of the servants. He wrote of regular visits to brothels, the first when he was 15, and said he was visiting them daily from the age of around 17. He also developed sexual fantasies <b>about</b> <b>his</b> <b>mother,</b> writing when he was 22 that he masturbated while thinking about her.|$|E

5|$|Angelica tasks Chuckie {{to pick a}} {{dandelion}} {{to decorate}} her sculpture. He is unable to obtain it after being chased by a bee and Stu's malfunctioning Mother's Day invention, which is a vacuum-like machine that destroys {{a majority of the}} lawn. After Chuckie breaks her macaroni head, Angelina orders him to stay in the closet along with Tommy, Phil, and Lil. While the babies console Chuckie, he realizes that his dad meets all the requirements of a good mother. They open Chaz's box, finding a spade, a journal of pressed flowers, and a photograph of Chuckie's mother. Meanwhile, Stu's invention continues to vacuum up mud before finally exploding inside the house. Didi is disappointed that Minka did not like the spa, but Minka says she only wanted to spend time with her daughter for Mother's Day. Chuckie gives Chaz the picture of his mother as a Mother's Day present.

25|$|The first {{interviews}} for the autobiography frustrated Haley. Rather than discussing his own life, MalcolmX spoke about Elijah Muhammad, {{the leader of}} the Nation of Islam; he became angry about Haley's reminders that the book was supposed to be about MalcolmX. After several meetings, Haley asked MalcolmX to tell him something <b>about</b> <b>his</b> <b>mother.</b> That question drew MalcolmX into recounting his life story.|$|E
25|$|Since this theory, the 'closet scene' {{in which}} Hamlet confronts {{his mother in}} her private {{quarters}} has been portrayed in a sexual light in several performances. Hamlet is played as scolding his mother for having sex with Claudius while simultaneously wishing (unconsciously) that he could take Claudius' place; adultery and incest is what he simultaneously loves and hates <b>about</b> <b>his</b> <b>mother.</b> Ophelia's madness after her father's death may be read through the Freudian lens {{as a reaction to}} the death of her hoped-for lover, her father. Her unrequited love for him suddenly slain is too much for her and she drifts into insanity.|$|E

25|$|On July 31, 2013, Applegate was {{featured}} on the second episode of the fourth season of the revived American version of TLC's, Who Do You Think You Are? The broadcast centered around Applegate {{trying to find out}} for her father, Robert Applegate, <b>about</b> <b>his</b> <b>mother,</b> Lavina Applegate Walton, who was mysteriously absent for most of her son's life and who died early in his life. Applegate also hoped {{to find out if the}} hearsay concerning her grandmother's tragic death were true.

25|$|Already {{before the}} Romantic period proper, critics {{had begun to}} stress the {{elements}} of the play that would cause Hamlet to be seen, in the next century, as the epitome of the tragedy of character. In 1774, William Richardson sounded the key notes of this analysis: Hamlet was a sensitive and accomplished prince with an unusually refined moral sense; he is nearly incapacitated by the horror of the truth <b>about</b> <b>his</b> <b>mother</b> and uncle, and he struggles against that horror to fulfill his task. Richardson, who thought the play should have ended shortly after the closet scene, thus saw the play as dramatizing the conflict between a sensitive individual and a calloused, seamy world.|$|E
25|$|The Oxford Dictionary of National Biography {{traces the}} story of Christiana's {{supposed}} contribution to cricket, noting that her son Edward Hodges wrote <b>about</b> <b>his</b> <b>mother</b> playing cricket with her brother John Willes, a Kent county player identified with the round-arm bowling style. Hodges' account makes mention neither of crinoline nor of roundarm bowling, merely that Christiana, John and their dog could beat any eleven in England. The ODNB states that the story was picked up in Hodges' obituary in Wisden Cricketers' Almanack and subsequently retold by F. S. Ashley-Cooper in Highways and Byways (1927); it was rejected by Rowland Bowen in Cricket: A History of its Growth and Development (1970); but tentatively accepted by other writers {{as part of the}} folklore of cricket.|$|E

500|$|When {{the family}} {{returned}} to California, Alfred Knopf asked Brodie to edit {{and write a}} new introduction for Sir Richard Francis Burton's memoir, The City of the Saints and Across the Rocky Mountains to California (1862). Almost immediately she [...] "was lost" [...] to Burton, a man whom she described as [...] "fascinating beyond belief." [...] She soon planned a full biography. Like Brodie, Burton was an agnostic who was fascinated by religion and all things sexual. Brodie consulted with the psychoanalyst community and used her own free association to make Burton reveal his subconscious. For instance, she noted that immediately before and after Burton wrote <b>about</b> <b>his</b> <b>mother,</b> he talked [...] "about cheating, decapitation, mutilations, smashings—all the stories and metaphors are violent, negative, and hostile." ...|$|E

500|$|Barney's father, Arnie Gumble, was a World War II {{veteran who}} died in 1979 in a parade float accident. Little is known <b>about</b> <b>his</b> <b>mother,</b> except that she lives in Norway and that she served in the United States Navy, {{including}} duty on a submarine. She {{is seen in the}} season nine episode [...] "Simpson Tide". In Treehouse of Horror XVII, Barney stated that he was Polish, after mistakenly saying he was Irish in a drunken stupor. Barney was born on April 20 (which Homer remembers is also Hitler's birthday in [...] "Viva Ned Flanders" [...] and Barney's entry into the Springfield Film Festival in [...] "A Star Is Burns" [...] where Barney states that he is 40 years old). In the episode [...] "$pringfield", he claims that he studied dance for several years, including modern and tap.|$|E
500|$|David Starkey {{was born}} on 3 January 1945 in Kendal, Westmorland. [...] He is {{the only child of}} Robert Starkey and Elsie Lyon, Quakers who had married 10 years {{previously}} in Bolton, at a Friends meeting house. His father, the son of a cotton spinner, was a foreman in a washing-machine factory, while his mother followed in her father's footsteps and became a cotton weaver and later a cleaner. Starkey is equivocal <b>about</b> <b>his</b> <b>mother,</b> describing her as both [...] "wonderful", in that she helped develop his ambition, and [...] "monstrous", intellectually frustrated and living through her son. [...] "She was a wonderful but also very frightening parent. Finally, she was a Pygmalion. [...] She wanted a creature, she wanted something she had made." [...] Her dominance contrasted sharply to his father, who was [...] "poetic, reflective, rather solitary...as a father he was weak." [...] Their relationship was [...] "distant", but improved after his mother's death in 1977.|$|E
500|$|The {{ideal that}} respectable women should remain {{out of the}} public eye was so entrenched in {{classical}} Athens that simply naming a citizen woman could be a source of shame. [...] Priestesses were the only group of women to be exempt from this rule. Thucydides wrote in his History of the Peloponnesian War, [...] "Great honour is hers whose reputation among males is least, whether for praise or blame". Women were identified by their relationships to men, which could create confusion if two sisters were both referred to as the son (or brother) of the same man. In law-court speeches, where a woman's position is often a key point (especially in inheritance cases), orators seem to have deliberately avoided naming them. Although Demosthenes speaks <b>about</b> <b>his</b> <b>mother</b> and sister in five extant speeches relating to his inheritance, neither is ever named; in his body of extant work, only 27 women are named, compared with 509 men.|$|E
