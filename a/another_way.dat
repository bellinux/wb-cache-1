5|$|In {{a simple}} {{exchange}} economy, the contract curve describes {{the set of}} bundles that exhaust the gains from trade. But in a Robinson Crusoe/Friday economy, there is <b>another</b> <b>way</b> to exchange goods – to produce less of one good {{and more of the}} other.|$|E
5|$|The Cygwin {{emulation}} {{layer is}} <b>another</b> <b>way</b> of running Perl under Windows. Cygwin provides a Unix-like environment on Windows, and both Perl and CPAN are available as standard pre-compiled packages in the Cygwin setup program. Since Cygwin also includes gcc, compiling Perl from source is also possible.|$|E
5|$|The {{advantage}} of this re-statement is that one can exploit theorems from linear algebra on {{the maximum number of}} linearly independent, simultaneously perpendicular vectors. This gives <b>another</b> <b>way</b> to calculate the maximum number of solutions and extend the theorem to higher-dimensional spaces.|$|E

50|$|The {{large number}} of fielders means that they will often get in one <b>another's</b> <b>way.</b> Also, they will often tend to clump {{together}} to talk as the ball may not come to them for a while. Therefore, some individuals who have greater fielding skills may disperse themselves throughout the field.|$|R

Then, besides, if you fill the wheelbarrows together, and wheel together, you will always be in company,--which is pleasanter.” ...|$|R
5|$|There are two campgrounds in the park, North Campground and Sunset Campground. Loop A in North Campground is open year-round. Additional {{loops and}} Sunset Campground are open from late spring to early autumn. The 114-room Bryce Canyon Lodge is <b>another</b> <b>way</b> to stay {{overnight}} in the park.|$|E
5|$|<b>Another</b> <b>way</b> enzyme {{malfunctions}} {{can cause}} disease comes from germline mutations in genes coding for DNA repair enzymes. Defects in these enzymes cause cancer because cells are {{less able to}} repair mutations in their genomes. This causes a slow accumulation of mutations and results {{in the development of}} cancers. An example of such a hereditary cancer syndrome is xeroderma pigmentosum, which causes the development of skin cancers in response to even minimal exposure to ultraviolet light.|$|E
5|$|<b>Another</b> <b>way</b> {{of life of}} chemotrophs in {{the absence}} of {{possible}} electron acceptors is fermentation, wherein the electrons taken from the reduced substrates are transferred to oxidised intermediates to generate reduced fermentation products (e.g., lactate, ethanol, hydrogen, butyric acid). Fermentation is possible, because the energy content of the substrates is higher than that of the products, which allows the organisms to synthesise ATP and drive their metabolism.|$|E

5|$|Armatus, as magister militum, {{was sent}} with all {{available}} forces in Asia Minor, {{to oppose the}} advancing army of the Isaurians, but secret messages from Zeno, who promised {{to give him the}} title of magister militum for life and to confer the rank of Caesar on his son, induced him to betray his master. Armatus avoided the road by which Zeno was advancing and marched into Isauria by <b>another</b> <b>way.</b> This betrayal decided the fate of Basiliscus.|$|E
5|$|Different species use {{different}} pheromones. Scarab beetles {{such as the}} Rutelinae use pheromones derived from fatty acid synthesis, while other scarabs such as the Melolonthinae use amino acids and terpenoids. <b>Another</b> <b>way</b> beetles find mates {{is seen in the}} fireflies (Lampyridae) which are bioluminescent, with abdominal light-producing organs. The males and females engage in a complex dialogue before mating; each species has a unique combination of flight patterns, duration, composition, and intensity of the light produced.|$|E

5|$|Drives which encrypt all {{writes on}} the fly can {{implement}} ATA Secure Erase in <b>another</b> <b>way.</b> They simply zeroize and generate a new random encryption key each time a secure erase is done. In this way the old data cannot be read anymore, as it cannot be decrypted. Some drives with an integrated encryption may require a TRIM command {{be sent to the}} drive to put the drive back to its original out-of-box state.|$|E
5|$|In a side plot, Walternate (John Noble) has {{recovered}} {{the portion of}} the doomsday machine that Fauxlivia has secured from the prime universe, and has discovered the formulation for Cortexiphan from his tests on Olivia, but refuses to allow it to be tested on children. When he hears of Fauxlivia's pregnancy with his grandchild, Walternate comforts her and offers his complete support for her, believing the child to be <b>another</b> <b>way</b> to bring Peter voluntarily back to the parallel universe.|$|E
5|$|In {{the first}} two examples, notice that if the Sudoku is rotated 180 degrees, and the clues relabeled with the {{permutation}} (123456789) -> (987654321), it returns to the same Sudoku. Expressed <b>another</b> <b>way,</b> these Sudokus have the property that every 180 degree rotational pair of clues (a, b) follows the rule (a) + (b) = 10.|$|E

5|$|Membranophones, {{which produce}} sound by a {{vibrating}} a stretched membrane; {{they may be}} drums (further sorted by {{the shape of the}} shell), which are struck by hand, with a stick, or rubbed, but kazoos and other instruments that use a stretched membrane for the primary sound (not simply to modify sound produced in <b>another</b> <b>way)</b> are also considered membranophones.|$|E
5|$|The Internet {{has helped}} autistic {{individuals}} bypass nonverbal cues and emotional sharing {{that they find}} so hard to deal with, and has given them a way to form online communities and work remotely. Sociological and cultural aspects of autism have developed: some in the community seek a cure, while others believe that autism is simply <b>another</b> <b>way</b> of being.|$|E
5|$|<b>Another</b> <b>way</b> of {{estimating}} {{the age of}} the cluster is by looking at the lowest-mass objects. In normal main-sequence stars, lithium is rapidly destroyed in nuclear fusion reactions. Brown dwarfs can retain their lithium, however. Due to lithium's very low ignition temperature of 2.5 × 106 K, the highest-mass brown dwarfs will burn it eventually, and so determining the highest mass of brown dwarfs still containing lithium in the cluster can give an idea of its age. Applying this technique to the Pleiades gives an age of about 115 million years.|$|E

In the practical part of this thesis the theoretical information are applied to the specific solid wood structure and thermal characteristics of it's particular components are evaluated...|$|R
5|$|<b>Another</b> <b>way</b> to view {{surface tension}} is {{in terms of}} energy. A {{molecule}} in contact with a neighbor is in a lower state of energy than if it were alone (not in contact with a neighbor). The interior molecules have as many neighbors as they can possibly have, but the boundary molecules are missing neighbors (compared to interior molecules) and therefore have a higher energy. For the liquid to minimize its energy state, the number of higher energy boundary molecules must be minimized. The minimized number of boundary molecules results in a minimal surface area.|$|E
5|$|Barnacles are {{normally}} sessile animals unable to evade predators. When they {{are attached to}} a scallop they benefit from the defence response of the mollusc to threats which enables it to avoid predation. The scallop is disadvantaged because the presence of barnacles may reduce its ability to swim. It {{has been found that}} encrusting sponges emit chemicals that discourage barnacle larvae from settling nearby. The larvae preferentially settle on shells that are not encrusted with sponges. This is <b>another</b> <b>way</b> in which encrusting sponges are of advantage to the scallops which are less impeded in their ability to swim by sponges than they are by barnacles.|$|E
5|$|Elsewhere, {{during their}} girls night out, Ruby {{is trying to}} {{convince}} Ashley to find another guy since Sean is always working. Ashley tells Mary Margaret that all she wants is to be with Sean. Mary Margaret understands since her own romantic arrangement is not ideal. Sean shows up on a break from work and proposes to Ashley; she accepts and they {{go out for a}} drive. David shows up next to give Mary Margret her Valentine, but mistakenly gives her Kathryn's. Mary Margaret says she thought if two people were meant to be together they would find a way, but maybe she and David need <b>another</b> <b>way.</b> She tells him he should probably go home.|$|E
