25|$|The initial {{focus of}} the library project was on {{upgrading}} the existing building. When the second floor was built {{on top of the}} library in the early 1970s, it initially housed the Council <b>Area</b> <b>Office,</b> though it was conceived even then that it would eventually be used as library space. However, investigations in 1999 by engineers revealed that the second level floor was too weak to support the weight of books without significant strengthening, which would be expensive to undertake. As well, the existing building was showing increasing signs of deterioration, most significantly a leaking ceiling. While it could be repaired, long-term maintenance would negate the short-term cost advantage of doing so. Thus, the option of a completely new building was brought under consideration.|$|E
25|$|It {{is named}} after United States Army Air Service General Billy Mitchell, {{who was raised in}} Milwaukee and is often {{regarded}} as the father of the United States Air Force.

It is also used by travellers throughout Wisconsin and Northern Illinois. An Amtrak railway station opened at the airport in 2005; the station is served by Amtrak's Hiawatha Service running between Chicago and Milwaukee several times daily. Since March 1941, the airport's weather station has been used as the official point for Milwaukee weather observations and records by the National Weather Service, whose <b>area</b> <b>office</b> is located in Sullivan.|$|E
