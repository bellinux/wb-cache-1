5|$|Originally, the weight-reduction phase had {{included}} removing the <b>anchors</b> from the battleship, but Wallin ordered {{one of the}} <b>anchors</b> to be reattached. His reason for doing so was that the anchor would effectively shift Missouris center of gravity forward to a narrower part of the battleship, thereby reducing the friction at her widest point.

From the typological classification of the <b>anchors</b> it is inferred that Dwarka had flourished as a port during the period of the Middle kingdoms of India.

40|$|When people {{estimate}} a numeric value after judging {{whether it}} is larger or smaller than a high or low <b>anchor</b> value (comparative question), estimates are biased {{in the direction of}} the <b>anchor.</b> One explanation for this <b>anchoring</b> effect is that people selectively access knowledge consistent with the <b>anchor</b> value as part of a positive test strategy. Two studies (total N = 184) supported the alternative explanation that people access knowledge consistent with their own answer to the comparative question. Specifically, <b>anchoring</b> effects emerged when the answer to the comparative question was unexpected (lower than the low <b>anchor</b> or higher than the high <b>anchor).</b> For expected answers (lower than the high <b>anchor</b> or higher than the low <b>anchor),</b> however, <b>anchoring</b> effects were attenuated or reversed.

5|$|Droits de l'Homme {{had been}} more seriously damaged than the British frigates, and was closer to shore at the time land was spotted.

With the ship virtually unmanageable, Lacrosse ordered the <b>anchors</b> lowered in an attempt to hold the ship in position until repairs could be made. This effort was futile, as all but two <b>anchors</b> had been lost during efforts to hold position in Bantry Bay, and British gunfire had damaged one of the anchor cables and rendered it useless. The final anchor was deployed, but it failed to restrain the ship and at 07:00 (according to the French account), the Droits de l'Homme struck a sandbank close to the town of Plozévet. This broke off the remaining mast and caused the ship to heel over onto her side.|$|E

The results confirmed the elastic-flexible <b>anchor</b> especially applied to the support structure with the requirements of large deformation and dynamic load, and worth popularizing in the <b>anchor</b> retaining wall engineering...|$|R
