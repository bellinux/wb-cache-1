5|$|The {{goal of this}} {{executive}} order is to help address questions about favoritism in city contracting by preventing conflicts of interest, or even the appearance of such conflicts.... There should be a level playing field, where no one has an advantage—or a disadvantage—in obtaining city contracts, simply because they know me or anyone else in government.... Under the steps I'm taking today and recommending to the City Council, the public can easily learn {{everything there is to}} know about a city contract: who is involved, who will benefit and whether the city is paying a fair price. I <b>and</b> <b>every</b> <b>other</b> city official must be prepared to defend every contract on its merits.|$|E

25|$|Analysis {{is always}} an {{analysis}} ad infinitum and one can never reach the absolute. It consists in dividing the object based on the chosen viewpoint and translating the divided fragments into symbols, wherein a spectre of the original can be reconstructed. These symbols always distort {{the part of the}} object they represent, as they’re generalized to include it <b>and</b> <b>every</b> <b>other</b> part they represent.

25|$|Textiles and {{garments}} are {{intricate and}} require one individual operator, {{in contrast to}} the collective farming of coffee and cocoa beans. Textiles are not a straightforward commodity because to be fairly traded, there must be regulation in cotton cultivation, dyeing, stitching, <b>and</b> <b>every</b> <b>other</b> step in the process of textile production. Fair trade textiles must not be confused with the sweat-free movement although the two movements intersect at the worker level.|$|E

Shortly after the 1963 buyout, Hydro ordered {{a second set of}} two units, to be built next to the first two, and gave the construction contract to Shawinigan Engineering. Work started in March 1965, and the last unit was delivered in February 1968.|$|E
25|$|The Buccaneers {{took their}} place in the NFC Central Division, while the other 1976 {{expansion}} team, the Seattle Seahawks, switched conferences with Tampa Bay and joined the AFC West.

Tampa Bay's 1977 schedule consisted of a game against each of the other thirteen NFC teams, and the Seahawks.|$|E
25|$|To avoid {{decisions}} and branches in the counting loop, the rules can be rearranged from an egocentric {{approach of the}} inner field regarding its neighbours to a scientific observer's viewpoint: if {{the sum of all}} nine fields is 3, the inner field state for the next generation will be life (no matter of its previous contents); if the all-field sum is 4, the inner field retains its current state <b>and</b> <b>every</b> <b>other</b> sum sets the inner field to death.|$|E

25|$|The Seahawks are {{the only}} NFL team to switch {{conferences}} twice in the post-merger era. The franchise began play in 1976 in the NFC West division but switched conferences with the Buccaneers after one season and joined the AFC West. This realignment was dictated by the league {{as part of the}} 1976 expansion plan, so that both expansion teams could play each other twice <b>and</b> <b>every</b> <b>other</b> NFL franchise.

25|$|Since Neolithic {{times in}} China, {{agriculture}} {{was a key}} element {{to the rise of}} China's civilization <b>and</b> <b>every</b> <b>other</b> civilization. The food that farmers produced sustained the whole of society, while the land tax exacted on farmers' lots and landholders' property produced much of the state revenue for China's pre-modern ruling dynasties. Therefore, the farmer was a valuable member of society, and even though he was not considered one with the shi class, the families of the shi were still landholders that often produced crops and foodstuffs.|$|E

25|$|George Earl Toolson was {{a pitcher}} with the Newark Bears in 1949, a farm {{team for the}} New York Yankees in the AAA-class International League. He {{believed}} he {{was good enough to}} play in the major leagues, if not for the Yankees then for another team. But due to the reserve clause in his <b>and</b> <b>every</b> <b>other</b> player's contract, under which teams reserved rights to a player for a year after the contract expired, he was effectively bound to the talent-rich Yankees and could not negotiate a new contract with another team.|$|E

Freehan was the starting catcher for the AL All Star team in 1968 (<b>and</b> <b>every</b> <b>other</b> year from 1966 to 1972) and finished second in the 1968 American League MVP voting, behind McLain.|$|E
