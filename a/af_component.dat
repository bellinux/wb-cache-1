40|$|Ni_ 50 -xCo_xMn_ 40 Sn_ 10 {{shape memory}} alloys in the {{approximate}} range 5 < x < 10 display desirable properties for applications {{as well as}} intriguing magnetism. These off-stoichiometric Heusler alloys undergo a martensitic phase transformation at a temperature T_M of 300 - 400 K, from ferromagnetic (F) to nonferromagnetic, with unusually low thermal hysteresis and a large change in magnetization. The low temperature magnetic structures in the martensitic phase of such alloys, which are distinctly inhomogeneous, are of great interest but are not well understood. Our present use of spin echo NMR, in the large hyperfine fields at ^ 55 Mn sites, provides compelling evidence that nanoscale magnetic phase separation into F and antiferromagnetic (AF) regions occurs below T_M in alloys with x in the range 0 to 7. At finite Co substitution the F regions {{are found to be}} of two distinct types, corresponding to high and low local concentrations of Co on Ni sites. Estimates of the size distributions of both the F and AF nanoregions have been made. At x = 7 the <b>AF</b> <b>component</b> is not long-range ordered, even below 4 K, and is quite different to the <b>AF</b> <b>component</b> found at x = 0; by x = 14 the F phase is completely dominant. Of particular interest, we find, for x = 7, that field cooling leads to dramatic changes in the AF regions. These findings provide insight into the origins of magnetic phase separation and superparamagnetism in these complex alloys, particularly their intrinsic exchange bias, which is of considerable current interest.

The Co layers were found to be antiferromagnetically coupled (AF), with a saturating field of 6 kOe. Polarized neutron reflectivityy was used to determine the direction of the sublattice magnetization. In zero applied field, the AF moments are aligned along the Co [0001] axis. In a magnetic field H perpendicular to the Co [0001] axis, the sublattices moments evolve to a canted arrangement, with the <b>AF</b> <b>component</b> always perpendicular to the field. With H along the Co[0001] axis, the AF moments flop in a direction perpendicular to Co[0001] axis. The spin flop transition is not abrupt, but can be described as a gradual rotation that is completed at 2 kOe. The anisotropy of the sublattice magnetization is related to the anisotropy of the magnetoresistance. This has the conventional dumbbell behavior with the field applied perpendicular to the Co[0001] axis, but exhibits an extended plateau near H = 0, and a slight increase up to H {approximately} 2 kOe, when H is parallel to Co[0001] axis...|$|E

IgG(total), IgG subclass, and IgE responses were studied using ELISA, CAP-FEIA, and immunoblotting techniques in patients with pulmonary aspergilloma (PA), which is a model for chronic antigen exposure, and allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA), characterized by transient antigen exposure. Af-IgG(1) was increased in patients with PA compared with those with ABPA. Patients with PA and IgE responses to Af and/or other inhalant allergens showed significantly higher Af-IgG(4) responses than did patients with PA and negative IgE responses or patients with ABPA. Surveillance studies over time in individual patients showed concordance in Af-IgG(1) and Af-IgG(4) responses.

Ni oxides were made using ratios of O(2) to Ar ions ranging from 7 to 33 % during ion-beam deposition. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) has shown that with 7 % O(2) /Ar used during bottom layer deposition, the film produced consisted of fcc Ni (a = 3. 52 angstrom) and rock-salt NiO (a = 4. 21 angstrom) phases. A bottom film layer prepared with 33 % O(2) /Ar consisted of a pure NiO phase with an expanded lattice constant (a = 4. 32 angstrom). A strong temperature dependence of the coercivity (H(c)) and a 20 kOe field-cooled loop shift exchange bias field (H(ex)) were observed below 100 K. In addition, H(ex) increased with increasing O(2) /Ar ratio for the bottom layer antiferromagnetic (<b>AF)</b> <b>component.</b> At 10 K, a NiFe/NiO (33 % O(2) / Ar) bilayer exhibited the higest H(c) (110 Oe) and H(ex) (- 60 Oe).

The magnetotransport studies have shown that these NiFe/NiO bilayers exhibit anisotropic magnetoresistance (AMR) behavior.

40|$|Asbestos {{has been}} used for many years as an {{ablation}} inhibitor in insulating materials. It has been a constituent of the AS/NBR insulation used to protect the steel case of the RSRM (Reusable Solid Rocket Motor) since its inception. This paper discusses the development of a potential replacement RSRM insulation design, several of the numerous design issues that were worked and processing problems that were resolved. The earlier design demonstration on FSM- 5 (Flight Support Motor) of the selected 7 % and 11 % Kevlar(registered) filled EPDM (KF/EPDM) candidate materials was expanded. Full-scale process simulation articles were built and FSM- 8 was manufactured using multiple Asbestos Free (<b>AF)</b> <b>components</b> and materials. Two major problems had to be overcome in developing the AF design. First, bondline corrosion, which occurred in the double-cured region of the aft dome, had to be eliminated. Second, KF/EPDM creates high levels of electrostatic energy (ESE), which does not readily dissipate from the insulation surface. An uncontrolled electrostatic discharge (ESD) of this surface energy during many phases of production could create serious safety hazards. Numerous processing changes were implemented and a conductive paint was developed to prevent exposed external insulation surfaces from generating ESE/ESD. Additionally, special internal instrumentation was incorporated into FSM- 8 to record real-time internal motor environment data. These data included inhibitor insulation erosion rates and internal thermal environments. The FSM- 8 static test was successfully conducted in February 2000 and much valuable data were obtained to characterize the AF insulation design...|$|R

Since AF from most full-term deliveries appeared to contain an inhibitor(s) for thymocyte proliferation, AFs were fractionated by gel filtration prior to IL- 1 assay. IL- 1 activities eluted in two peaks at positions of 90, 000 - 60, 000 MW and 20, 000 - 15, 000 MW. Growth inhibitory activity eluted {{at the position}} of 70, 000 - 50, 000 MW, and its effect appeared to be non-specific because these fractions inhibited the growth of various cell lines. Using isoelectric focusing (IEF) techniques, pI values of 6. 8 - 7. 3 for the higher MW IL- 1 as well as 4. 9 - 5. 5 and 6. 7 - 7. 0 for the lower MW IL- 1 were obtained. Antibody against human IL- 1 alpha partially neutralized {{the activity of the}} lower MW IL- 1, though it exhibited little effect on the higher MW IL- 1. In contrast, antibody against human IL- 1 beta almost completely neutralized the activity of the higher MW IL- 1 and partially neutralized the activity of the lower MW IL- 1. These results suggest that most of the higher MW IL- 1 is beta-type, and the lower MW IL- 1 is a mixture of alpha and beta-types. IL- 1 beta appeared to exist as a complex (combined with <b>AF</b> <b>components)</b> or as an aggregate of the lower MW IL- 1 forms.

40|$|Purpose Multiple {{organization}} indices (OIs) {{have been}} used to predict the outcome of stepwise catheter ablation (step-CA) in long-standing persistent AF (pers-AF), however with limited success. Our study aims at developing innovative OIs from baseline (BL, before ablation) ECG in order to predict the outcome of step-CA. Methods Fourteen consecutive patients (pts) (60 ± 5 y, AF duration 21 ± 9 m) underwent a step-CA consisting in pulmonary veins isolation, left atrial (LA) defragmentation and linear ablations, and right atrial (RA) ablations if non terminated. Chest lead V 6 was placed in the back (V 6 b). After QRST cancellation from chest leads V 1 to V 6 b, two OIs were computed to quantify the harmonic components of ECG atrial activity: 1) phase difference variance (PD) between the <b>AF</b> harmonic <b>components</b> as a measure of AF regularity, and 2) adaptive OI (AOI) evaluating the time evolution of the <b>AF</b> harmonic <b>components.</b> Both indices were compared to classical ones: a spectrum-based OI (SOI) and ECG AF cycle length (AFCL). Results Pers-AF was terminated into sinus rhythm or atrial tachycardia in 10 / 14 pts during step-CA, 8 during LA (LT), 2 during RA (RT) ablation, and 4 were non terminated (NT). The figure shows that LT was best separated from RT/NT before ablation by AOI computed on lead V 1 (A) and PD from lead V 6 b (B) as compared to SOI and AFCL respectively. Conclusion Our results suggest that adaptive OIs computed before ablation perform better than classical OIs for separating LT from RT/NT pts.

Sources of bias operating on <b>AF</b> estimator <b>components</b> include non-portability of risk estimates, inadequate models, inaccurate data including unknown cancer latency and employment turnover and compromises in using the available estimators. Each source of bias operates on a <b>component</b> of the <b>AF</b> estimator.

The methods are illustrated using the example of lung cancer due to occupational exposure to respirable crystalline silica in men. RESULTS: Results are presented graphically for a hierarchy of biases contributing to an overall credibility interval for lung cancer and respirable crystalline silica exposure. An overall credibility interval of 2. 0 % to 16. 2 % was estimated for an AF of 3. 9 % in men. Choice of relative risk and employment turnover were shown to contribute most to overall estimate uncertainty. Bias from using an incorrect estimator makes a much lower contribution.

MethodsCompositions including biochemical components and tumor markers were determined in human AF, umbilical cord serum (UCS) and maternal serum (MS) from the same subject in the range of 15 – 42 weeks of gestation. Results(1) The levels of primary electrolytes such as sodium, chloride, anion gap and osmotic pressure in AF was almost the same as in UCS and MS. (2) The levels of organic substances, including total protein, glucose, triglycerides, cholesterol and various enzymes, were markedly lower in AF than in UCS and MS, especially for total protein, which was 8 - and 12. 5 -fold lower in AF than in UCS and MS, respectively. (3) The levels of tumor markers, including carcinoembryonic antigen, ferritin, cancer antigen 125 and 199, and α-fetoprotein in AF displayed different dynamic changes compared to UCS and MS as gestation advanced. ConclusionThis study demonstrated that AF is not a result of simple filtration from the blood but an independent fluid.

40|$|Computer {{studies are}} often used to study {{mechanisms}} of cardiac arrhythmias, including atrial fibrillation (<b>AF).</b> A crucial <b>component</b> in these studies is the electrophysiological model that describes the membrane potential of myocytes. The models vary from detailed, describing numerous ion channels, to simplified, grouping ionic channels into a minimal set of variables. The parameters of these models, however, are determined across different experiments in varied species. Furthermore, a single set of parameters may not describe variations across patients, and models have rarely been shown to recapitulate critical features of AF in a given patient. In this study we develop physiologically accurate computational human atrial models by fitting parameters of a detailed and of a simplified model to clinical data for five patients undergoing ablation therapy. Parameters were simultaneously fitted to action potential (AP) morphology, action potential duration (APD) restitution and conduction velocity (CV) restitution curves in these patients. For both models, our fitting procedure generated parameter sets that accurately reproduced clinical data, but differed markedly from published sets and between patients, emphasizing the need for patient-specific adjustment. Both models produced two-dimensional spiral wave dynamics for that were similar for each patient.

Seven patients had dominant DEB, 3 had localized recessive DEB, and 7 had severe, generalized recessive DEB. Nonlesional, unscarred skin was obtained from standard body regions. Criteria for the identification of AF were a mandatory union with the lamina densa and the presence of central banding and/or fanning of the extremities. No AF were detected in 9 technically suitable samples from patients with severe recessive DEB. Structurally normal AF were present, but significantly reduced in number, in both dominant and localized recessive DEB, compared with site-matched samples from 12 healthy adults.

In this study we identified morphological and histological alterations of the intestine and the myenteric plexus with two different times of exposure to AF. Methods: The experimental gastroschisis was achieved at two different gestational ages, on day 18. 5 (E 18. 5) and day 19. 5 (E 19. 5) of gestation, in fetal rats which were divided into 3 subgroups: control, sham and gastroschisis. We measured fetal body weight (BW), intestinal weight (IW) and intestinal length (IL). The layers of intestinal wall and myenteric plexus were evaluated by hematoxylin and eosin staining (HE staining) and immunofluorescence (alpha-internexin), respectively. Results: BW was not significantly different among the control, sham and gastroschisis groups at both ages. IW and IL were larger and shorter, respectively, in the gastroschisis fetuses (p< 0. 001) at both ages. Intestinal diameters and wall layers presented significant differences among control, sham and gastroschisis fetuses at both ages (p< 0. 001), but the time of exposure to AF compromised the serous membrane, D-II (diameter II, p< 0. 001) and IL (p = 0. 001). alpha-Internexin presented more intensive immunoreactivity in gastroschisis fetuses at E 18. 5. Conclusions: In gastroschisis, the longer the time of exposure to AF, the more severe bowel impairment will be, {{especially with regard to}} IL and the serous layer, and the more immature the myenteric plexus will be.

40|$|Aminoflavone (<b>AF),</b> {{the active}} <b>component</b> {{of a novel}} anticancer agent (AFP 464) in phase I {{clinical}} trials, is a ligand of the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR). AhR dimerizes with HIF- 1 beta/AhR, which is shared with HIF- 1 alpha, a transcription factor critical for the response of cells to oxygen deprivation. To address whether pharmacologic activation of the AhR pathway might be a potential mechanism for inhibition of HIF- 1, we tested the effects of AF on HIF- 1 expression. AF inhibited HIF- 1 alpha transcriptional activity and protein accumulation in MCF- 7 cells. However, inhibition of HIF- 1 alpha by AF was independent from a functional AhR pathway. Indeed, AF inhibited HIF- 1 alpha expression in Ah(R 100) cells, in which the AhR pathway is functionally impaired, yet did not induce cytotoxicity, providing evidence that these effects are mediated by distinct signaling pathways. Moreover, AF was inactive in MDA-MB- 231 cells, yet inhibited HIF- 1 alpha in MDA-MB- 231 cells transfected with the SULT 1 A 1 gene. AF inhibited HIF- 1 alpha mRNA expression by approximately 50 %. Notably, actinomycin-D completely abrogated the ability of AF to downregulate HIF- 1 alpha mRNA, indicating that active transcription was required for the inhibition of HIF- 1 alpha expression. Finally, AF inhibited HIF- 1 alpha protein accumulation and the expression of HIF- 1 target genes in MCF- 7 xenografts. These results show that AF inhibits HIF- 1 alpha in an AhR-independent fashion, and they unveil additional activities of AF that may be relevant for its further clinical development...|$|R

BackgroundAlthough {{the primary goal of}} AF ablation is QoL improvement, this effect has yet to be demonstrated in the long term. MethodsA total of 502 symptomatic AF ablation recipients were prospectively followed for recurrence, QoL, and AF symptoms. ResultsIn 323 patients with 2 years of follow-up, 72 % achieved AF elimination off antiarrhythmic drugs (AADs), 15 % achieved AF control with AADs, and 13 % had recurrent <b>AF.</b> The physical <b>component</b> summary scores of the Medical Outcomes Study Short Form 36 increased from 58. 8 ± 20. 1 to 76. 2 ± 19. 2 (p < 0. 001) and the mental component summary scores of the Short Form 36 increased from 65. 3 ± 18. 6 to 79. 8 ± 15. 8 (p < 0. 001). Post-ablation QoL improvements were noted across ablation outcomes, including recurrent AF (change in physical component summary: 12. 1 ± 19. 7 and change in mental component summary: 9. 7 ± 17. 9), with no significant differences in QoL improvement across 3 ablative efficacy outcomes. However, in 103 patients who completed additional assessment with Mayo AF Symptom Inventories (on a scale of 0 to 48), those with AF elimination off AADs had a change in AF symptom frequency score of − 9. 5 ± 6. 3, which was significantly higher than those with AF controlled with AADs (− 5. 6 ± 3. 8, p = 0. 03) or those with recurrent AF (− 3. 4 ± 8. 4, p = 0. 02). Independent predictors of limited QoL improvement included higher baseline QoL, obesity, and warfarin use at follow-up. ConclusionsAF ablation produces sustained QoL improvement at 2 years in patients with and without recurrence. AF-specific symptom assessment more accurately reflects ablative efficacy...|$|R
40|$|Aim. To study {{changes in}} {{quality of life}} (QoL) in {{patients}} with atrial fibrillation (AF) treated with warfarin after leaving the international clinical trial. Material and Methods. Patients with AF who were managed at cardiology department of the University Hospital participated in the study. Patients of the main group (n= 79) completed the international clinical trial with warfarin titration to therapeutic doses and subsequent therapy monitoring at least 1 year. Patients of the control group (n= 23) had never taken part in clinical trials. QoL was evaluated with the 36 -Item Short-Form Health Survey (SF 36) questionnaire after international clinical trial living or hospital discharge (initially) and in 3, 6 months of follow-up in outpatient clinic. Results. The most significant changes were observed in the first 3 months. In patients of the main group after clinical trial leaving physical component of QoL decreased from 65 (52. 0 - 77. 0) to 52 (25. 0 – 55. 0) points (p< 0. 05) and emotional component – from 65 (55. 0 - 70. 0) to 60 (50. 0 – 65. 0) points (p< 0. 05). At the same period opposite dynamics was observed in patients of the control group after hospital discharge. Physical component of QoL increased from 55 (25. 0 - 65. 0) to 65 (52. 0 – 77. 0) points (p< 0. 05) and emotional component - from 60 (47. 5 - 65. 0) to 70 (60. 0 – 75. 0) points (p< 0. 05). In the next 3 months QoL levels have not changed significantly in patients of the both groups. Conclusion. International clinical trial living affects QoL in patients with <b>AF.</b> The physical <b>component</b> of QoL worsens most significantly. </p...|$|R
30|$|The {{interplay of}} {{irreversible}} reactions and deformation during regional metamorphism was analyzed in the reaction zones between rodingite and serpentinite. Rodingites are leucocratic rocks found commonly in serpentinites and are considered metasomatic products of Ca-rich fluid. Rodingites occur ubiquitously in serpentinite from the Nomo metamorphic rocks, western Kyushu, a Cretaceous accretionary complex of greenschist to epidote–amphibolite facies condition. We used the singular value decomposition (SVD) method to analyze rodingitization reactions based on mineral compositions of a rodingite sample {{and a possible}} protolith (clinopyroxene gabbro). The resultant reaction implied that the rodingite was formed due to the addition of considerable amounts of CaO and H 2 O to the protolith, whereas other components such as SiO 2, AF (Al 2 O 3 [*]+[*]Fe 2 O 3), and FM (FeO[*]+[*]MgO) were conserved. The Nomo rodingites are associated with reaction zones between serpentinite. A careful study on the compositional variations of diopside and chlorite in the rodingite, serpentinite, and the reaction zones between them showed a disequilibrium crystallization of diopside in the reaction zone. Diopside shows a serrated variation in composition across the reaction zone together with disequilibrium signature within grains (composite grain consisting of Fe-rich and Fe-poor parts). These features clearly indicate that diopside crystallized {{in a relatively short}} period compared to the metamorphism by irreversible reactions. Another conspicuous feature is that perovskite occurs in some reaction zones, whereas titanite is common in rodingites; this indicates that the reaction zone is poorer in SiO 2. The tremolite veins are typically derived from the reaction zone into serpentinite; showing this {{is a good example of}} hydrofracturing associated with the formation of the reaction zone. All the reactions obtained by the SVD method that contribute to the formation of the reaction zones consumed CaO and evolved H 2 O, strongly suggesting that the hydrofracturing is caused by a rapid increment of fluid pressure during the progression of the reactions.

40|$|ABSTRACT In {{the modern}} era, {{the most common}} {{post-operative}} complications following cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) are neurocognitive deficits (NCD) and atrial fibrillation (AF). Both morbidities {{have been linked to}} inflammation resulting from surgery, anesthesia and CPB. Microemboli, inadequate oxygen delivery and the inflammatory response consequent to blood contacting artificial components of the CPB circuit have all been linked to postoperative NCD {{and to a lesser extent}} post-operative <b>AF.</b> The artificial <b>components</b> of the CPB circuit consist of stainless steel, polyvinylchloride (PVC), polycarbonate and other carbon-based plastics. In order to attenuate the negative sequelae of blood-circuit contact related inflammatory response, industry developed the biocompatible circuit (BCC) coating for the disposable CPB circuits. Four such coatings were studied and compared to an uncoated control group in a total of 101 patients undergoing routine CPB-assisted cardiac surgical procedures. Soluble adhesion molecule (SAM) activation was studied at different time points and common clinical outcomes such as white blood cell activation, serum renal function parameters urea and creatinine, postoperative bleeding, transfusion requirements, intensive care and hospital length of stay, CPB pump volume balances, changes in weight, postoperative serum lactate and glucose and the development of AF postoperatively, were compared. Additionally, postoperative neurocognitive testing was performed using a simple bedside neurocognitive test called the antisaccadic eye movement test. The patients in all groups were tested for comparison preoperatively and 72 hr postoperatively. Results: The mandate of BCC coating development and manufacture is to attenuate the well-documented and demonstrated inflammatory response consequent to the contact of blood with artificial CPB surfaces. The studied BCCs significantly decreased platelet transfusions in females. In addition, the BCCs decreased the concentrations of 2 SAMs when measured 6 hours after surgery and CPB. The difference in SAM expression seen between the coated and uncoated groups at 6 hr was no longer apparent at 72 hr. Very little difference was noted between the four BCC groups. Patients who developed AF postoperatively seemed predisposed to do so as the serum levels of soluble vascular cell adhesion molecule was significantly higher at baseline and remained so at 6 and 72 hr. The decreased platelet transfusions in females resulting from BCC use is a highly significant finding within this high-risk group of patient’s. As most platelet transfusions occur soon after the patient is disconnected from CPB, the short-term decrease in SAM activation can be linked to this improved clinical finding. The studied BCC coatings have achieved limited success in their intended mandate to attenuate inflammatory response in terms of improved clinical and laboratory desired outcomes...|$|R
40|$|INTRODUCTION Neurolinguistic {{models have}} {{coalesced}} around {{the view that}} two distinct pathways support different kinds of processing (Hickok & Poeppel, 2004; Saur et al., 2008) : A ventral stream (VS) maps sound to meaning, while a dorsal stream (DS) maps sound to articulation. Dell, Schwartz, Nozari, Faseyitan, & Coslett (2013) found correspondences between this framework and the interactive two-step model of lexical access (Foygel & Dell, 2000). However, {{there is evidence that}} the arcuate fascicle (<b>AF),</b> a major <b>component</b> of the DS, also contributes to semantic processing (Glasser & Rilling, 2008; Fernandez-Miranda et al., 2014). We present preliminary results from a study applying advanced fiber mapping techniques to investigate white matter correlates of word production in aphasia. METHOD Fifteen participants with aphasia due to left hemisphere stroke were given the Philadelphia Naming Test (mean %correct = 70 %, sd = 23 %) and response-type counts were entered into WebFit ([URL] to estimate the semantic (s) and phonological (p) connection weight parameters of the two-step model. Diffusion spectrum imaging data (acquired via Siemens 3 T Tim Trio Scanner, 32 -channel coil, 257 directions with twice-refocused spin-echo EPI sequence, TR = 9616 ms, TE = 152 ms, voxel size = 2. 4 mm 3, bmax = 7000 s/mm 2, FOV = 231 x 231 mm) were reconstructed by generalized q-sampling, a high angular resolution-based approach. Orientation distribution functions (directional probability of diffusion) were used to calculate quantitative anisotropy (QA) values for each tract using whole-brain seeding and defined ROIs. ROIs for the AF were the superior, middle, and inferior temporal gyri. We estimated two regression models with s and p parameters as dependent variables and QA values for the left VS (VSQA; inferior fronto-occipital fascicle, extreme capsule, uncinate fascicle) and DS (DSQA; AF, superior longitudinal fascicle) as predictors. RESULTS VSQA and DSQA were both significant positive predictors of s-weight (p < 0. 05, multiple r-squared = 0. 60, 95 %CI: 0. 07, 0. 88; VSQA semi-partial r-square = 0. 31, 95 %CI: 0. 1, 0. 6; DSQA semi-partial r-squared = 0. 19, 95 %CI: 0. 001, 0. 55) DSQA was a significant negative predictor of p-weight (p = 0. 009, r-squared = 0. 41, 95 %CI = 0. 08, 0. 7), with higher values predicting lower p-weights. DISCUSSION We found significant relationships between VS and DS white matter lesions and semantic word production impairments in aphasia. This is consistent with neurolinguistic models that propose a role for the AF in semantic processing (Glasser & Rilling, 2008; Fernandez-Miranda et al., 2014). They are also consistent with Dell and colleagues (2013), who found that s-weight was associated with lesions in both VS and DS cortical areas. However, when they controlled for lesion volume, relationships with DS areas were absent. Our results must be confirmed in a larger sample with control of lesion volume. We also found a counterintuitive negative relationship between phonological processing and left DS integrity. This suggests that reliance on this pathway may be maladaptive for phonological processing in aphasia. Perhaps patients with more intact dorsal pathways continue to rely on this (still damaged) network, while patients with greater damage are more successful at reorganizing function (cf. Parkinson, Raymer, Chang, FitzGerald, & Crosson, 2009) ...|$|R

An efficient alternative for soil utilization is the use of soil microorganisms aiming at a better exploitation of the nutrients for the plants. The arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) increase the capacity of the plant to absorb water and nutrients of the soil favoring its nutrition. The Agroforestry Systems have for base, to approach the structure and dynamics of a natural forest. The objective {{of this study was to}} evaluate the mycorrhizal interactions in the plant rhizosphere of two Agroforestry Systems. The interactions among chemical and physical characteristics of the soil and leaves nutrients with the mycorrhizal variable in component species of two Agroforestry Systems (AFs) were analyzed at distinct times and localities. Roots colonization by arbuscular mycorrhizae fungi ranged from 6. 8 to 99. 6 % on plants of AFS in the Brasileirinho community and 0. 4 to 52. 4 % in the AFS in the S?o Miguel community. Hyphae predominated in the roots of all the species, with 80 to 100 % of the observed fungal structures, in both the AFs.

40|$|The {{information}} densities in {{magnetic recording}} {{systems have been}} in- creased considerably {{over the last few}} decades. Much af the gain in the in- formation density can be ascribed ta the improvement af the magnetic prop- erties af the recording media. However, recording on a magnetic medium is a camplex process which, despite extensive research in the past, is only partly understood. The purpose af the research described in this thesis is ta contribute towards a better understanding af the recording process. The approach that has been followed is a combination af experiment al study with numerical modelling. The thesis consists af four parts, two on the magnetic hysteresis and two on the recording process. 1 : Experimental study of the hysteresis The technique af magnetic recording is possible only thanks ta the magnetic hysteresis. (Hysteresis is the property af magnetic media ta remain magne- tized af ter a temporary exposure ta a magnetic field.) Two new methods for studying the hysteresis af recording media have been developed. The first methad is based upon a generalization af the Wohlfarth re- lation. With this methad, the interactions between the magnetic units in the medium can be studied. In the original methad, the effects af these interactions could be compared for only two initial states af the material, the bulk-erased and the entirely-magnetized state. The generalization en- ables a comparison ta be made between any two initial remanent states. Application af this new methad on a particulate tape sample has revealed the complexity af the interactions. The second methad cap be used ta study the intrinsic magnetic proper- ties af recording media, irrespective af their easy magnetization direction. The demagnetizing fields that may arise from <b>components</b> <b>af</b> the magne- tization perpendicular ta a sample are compensated in this methad. The methad has been applied ta a sputtered Co-Cr medium and a Metal Evap- orated Go-Ni-O medium. The results show that there is a remarkablë re- semblance between these two media in respect of the angular dependence of their coercivity. 2 : Modelling the hysteresis For an accurate simulation of the magnetic hysteresis process, the well- known moving-Preisach and Stoner-Wohlfarth hysteresis models have been combined. With a simple modification, a fast numerical implementation of the combined hysteresis model has been obtained. The magnetic interac- tions, incorporated in a fashion similar to that used in the moving-Preisach model, can account for many of the details of the minor loops, including the anhysteretic susceptibility. The vector properties of the new hystere- sis model are the same as those of the Stoner- Wohlfarth model. With the combination of the two models, the hysteresis 100 ps of different recording media, including the Metal Evaporated Go-Ni-O medium, can be repro- duced very accurately. Only the very fine details of the hysteresis process, involving the interactions between the magnetic units, are not simulated correctly. This has been demonstrated with the new method for studying these interactions. 3 : Experimental study of the recording process Much about the recording process itself can be learned from specific record- ing experiments. The recording process on thick particulate media has been investigated by applying a new analysis method. This method is based upon a scaling argument. The length of a magnetic transition is assumed to be proportion al to the magnetic potential over the gap of the recording head. With this scaling-based analysis, the spacing 1088 can be estimated from a series of frequency responses measured at selected yalues-of the recording current. The method yields a reasonably accurate indication of the head- to-tape spacing. However, the indicated value is somewhat sensitive to the range of recording currents usesl in the experiments. Application of the method to different particulate recording media shows that the Hi 8 MP tape has the best intrinsic frequency response, whereas un-oriented barium ferrite media have a relatively high optimal recording depth. Entirely different phenomena are encountered when thin Go-Gr me- dia with a perpendicular easy axis orientation are rec?rded with a ring head. Additional minima appear in the frequency response of these media. The occurrence of these minima can be described with a double-transition model, in which the transition recorded at {{the leading edge of the}} recording head is only partially erased at the trailing edge. 4 : Modelling the recording process The basic principles of the recording process can be understood from simple recording models. For a more detailed simulation of the recording process, the combined hysteresis model has been implemented in a numerical record- ing model. A modified Newton iteration scheme reduces the computation time considerably. The scaling-based analysis has been evaluated with this recording model. The assumptions on which the analysis was based proved not to be justified. However, owing to a cancellation of errors, the value of the head-to-tape spacing that results from the analysis is still within 25 % of the actual value. The recording model is still under development. Simulations with the current version show that the basic recording characteristics of very differ- ent tapes can be reproduced within 2 dB. However, similar results can be obtained with simpIer models. Future research will have to show that this new recording model is better suited for also reproducing more complex phenomena such as overwrite and bias recording...|$|R
