500|$|Writer Simon Moore {{finished}} his spec script for The Quick and the Dead in late 1992, writing it as a {{homage to the}} Spaghetti Westerns of Sergio Leone, particularly the Dollars Trilogy starring Clint Eastwood. The writer decided the lead character should be a female. [...] "When you introduce women {{into that kind of}} world, something very interesting happens <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>an</b> interesting dynamic straight away," [...] Moore commented. The names of the lead villain (Herod) and the town (Redemption) were intentional allusions to the Bible. Moore considered directing his own script as an independent film and shooting The Quick and the Dead on a $3–4 million budget in either Spain or Italy.|$|E
2500|$|During Jackson's first {{stint as}} Lucky, the character's {{relationship}} with Elizabeth Webber (Herbst) {{was called a}} supercouple, compared to Lucky's parents Luke and Laura. The characters first became popular during the storyline of Elizabeth's rape in 1998, a storyline that received critical acclaim. Viewers wrote to the series praising the story and how it helped rape victims to heal. The storyline won General Hospital a SHINE Award (Sexual Health IN Entertainment) in 1998. Fans also responded to Jackson's performance; Robyn Flans of Soap Opera Magazine stated in 1998: [...] "Jonathan's sensitive portrayal {{of a young man}} experiencing the awakening of his own male stirrings while horrified by this hideous act of violence has been magnificent, <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>an</b> amazing character – one that Jackson manipulates to perfection." [...] Lucky and Elizabeth's romantic relationship took place gradually as result of the rape, and viewers liked the slow pacing that made the relationship honest and innocent, something unique among soap opera couples at the time. Each character dealing with personal issues, the couple's first kiss happened months into the relationship, and was anticipated and celebrated by fans. The series used the popular teen characters as an opportunity to reach young viewers with a social message through Lucky and Elizabeth's decision to abstain from sex. Executive producer at the time Wendy Riche explained her desire to show the decisions and pressures teenagers face, stating to Soap Opera Weekly: [...] "We have the opportunity with these beloved characters who have struggled together and who have loved together and who are exploring sexuality together to reach an audience that doesn't really want to be preached to, but wants to feel it." [...] Herbst and Jackson's popularity continued after Jackson's April 1999 departure; that July they were voted number one actor, actress and couple by fans of Soaps In Depth.|$|E

60|$|In {{the streets}} {{neighboring}} on Piccadilly {{there are many}} apartments which are effectively small hotels, where you pay a certain price for your rooms, and a certain fixed price for your meals.

This is the ideal, and it is not seriously affected by the reality that your provisions are also apportioned to the needs of your landlord's family.

The stories are known, but especially two of them--viz., that of St. Paul preaching on Mars Hill to the self-wise Athenians, and that of St. Peter passing sentence of death on Ananias--I say, these two strike the mind with the utmost surprise, the passions are so drawn to the life; astonishment, terror, and death in the face of Ananias, zeal and a sacred fire in the eyes of the blessed Apostle, fright and surprise upon the countenances of the beholders in the piece of Ananias; all these describe themselves so naturally that you cannot but seem to discover something of the like passions, even in seeing them.|$|E

It is wanted, he will remember, to give {{weight to}} those side stones, and draw them inwards against {{the thrust of}} the top stone. Take one of the side stones of c2 out for a moment, as at d. Now the proper place of the cusp upon it varies with the weight which it bears or requires; but in {{practice}} this nicety is rarely observed; the place of the cusp is almost always determined by æsthetic considerations, and it is evident that the variations in its place may be infinite. Consider the cusp as a wave passing up the side stone from its bottom to its top; then you will have the succession of forms from e to g (Plate III.), with infinite degrees of transition from each to each; but of which you may take e, f, and g, as representing three great families of cusped arches. Use e for your side stones, <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>an</b> arch as that at h below, which may be called a down-cusped arch. Use f for the side stone, and you have i, which may be called a mid-cusped arch. Use g, and you have k, an up-cusped arch.|$|E

60|$|We {{shook hands}} with our friends, and {{dismounted}} at Padua, where we were to take the diligence for the Po. In the diligence their loss was more than made good by {{the company of the}} only honest man in Italy. Of course this honest man had been a great sufferer from his own countrymen, and I wish that all English and American tourists, who think themselves the sole victims of publican rapacity and deceit in Italy, could have heard our honest man's talk. The truth is, these ingenious people prey upon their own kind with an avidity quite as keen as that with which they devour strangers; and I am half-persuaded that a ready-witted foreigner fares better among them than a traveller of their own nation. Italians will always pretend, on any occasion, that you have been plundered much worse than they but the reverse often happens. They give little in fees; but their landlord, their porter, their driver, and their boatman pillage them with the same impunity that they rob an Inglese. As for this honest man in the diligence, he had suffered such enormities {{at the hands of the}} Paduans, from which we had just escaped, and at the hands of the Ferrarese, into which we were rushing (at the rate of five miles scant an hour), that I was almost minded to stop between the nests of those brigands and pass the rest of my days at Rovigo, where the honest man lived. His talk was amusingly instructive, and went to illustrate the strong municipal spirit which still dominates all Italy, and which is more inimical to an effectual unity among Italians than Pope or Kaiser has ever been. Our honest man of Rovigo was a foreigner at Padua, twenty-five miles north, and a foreigner at Ferrara, twenty-five miles south; and throughout Italy the native of one city is an alien in another, and is as lawful prey as a Russian or an American with people who consider every stranger as sent them by the bounty of Providence to be eaten alive. Heaven knows what our honest man had paid at his hotel in Padua, but in Ferrara the other week he had been made to give five francs apiece for two small roast chickens, besides a fee to the waiter; and he pathetically warned us to beware how we dealt with Italians. Indeed, I never met a man so thoroughly persuaded of the rascality of his nation and of his own exceptional virtue. He took snuff with his whole person; and he volunteered, at sight of a flock of geese, a recipe which I give the reader: Stuff a goose with sausage; let it hang in the weather during the winter; and in the spring cut it up and stew it, <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>an</b> excellent and delicate soup.|$|E
