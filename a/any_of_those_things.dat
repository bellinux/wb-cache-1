500|$|Tom Robinson is {{the chief}} example among several innocents {{destroyed}} carelessly or deliberately throughout the novel. However, scholar Christopher Metress connects the mockingbird to Boo Radley: [...] "Instead of wanting to exploit Boo for her own fun (as she does {{in the beginning of}} the novel by putting on gothic plays about his history), Scout comes to see him as a 'mockingbird'—that is, as someone with an inner goodness that must be cherished." [...] The last pages of the book illustrate this as Scout relates the moral of a story Atticus has been reading to her, and, in allusions to both Boo Radley and Tom Robinson, states about a character who was misunderstood, [...] "when they finally saw him, why he hadn't done <b>any</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> <b>things...</b> Atticus, he was real nice," [...] to which he responds, [...] "Most people are, Scout, when you finally see them." ...|$|E
500|$|Nolan {{has denied}} the film criticizes the Occupy {{movement}} and insists {{that none of}} his Batman films are intended to be political: [...] "I've had as many conversations {{with people who have}} seen the film the other way round. We throw a lot of things against the wall to see if it sticks. We put a lot of interesting questions in the air, but that's simply a backdrop for the story. What we're really trying to do is show the cracks of society, show the conflicts that somebody would try to wedge open. We're going to get wildly different interpretations of what the film is supporting and not supporting, but it's not doing <b>any</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> <b>things.</b> It's just telling a story. If you're saying, 'Have you made a film that's supposed to be criticizing the Occupy Wall Street movement?' – well, obviously, that's not true." ...|$|E

[...] Carol McCain later said, [...] "The breakup of our marriage was not caused by my accident or Vietnam or <b>any</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> <b>things.</b> I don't know that it might not have happened if John had never been gone. I attribute it more to John turning 40 and wanting to be 25 again than I do to anything else." [...] McCain's biographer Robert Timberg believes that [...] "Vietnam did play a part, perhaps not the major part, but more than a walk-on." [...] According to Carol, her husband's five-year captivity in Vietnam had left him wanting to [...] "make up for lost time", and John put it this way: [...] "I had changed, she had changed ... People who have been apart that much change." [...] Ross Perot later said, [...] "After he came home, he walked with a limp, she [...] walked with a limp. So he threw her over for a poster girl with big money from Arizona [...] and the rest is history." ...|$|E
2500|$|Byrd {{served in}} the Senate Democratic leadership. He succeeded George Smathers as {{secretary}} of the Senate Democratic Conference from 1967 to 1971. He unseated Ted Kennedy in 1971 to become majority whip, or the second highest-ranking Democrat, until 1977. Smathers recalled that, [...] "Ted was off playing. While Ted was away at Christmas, down in the islands, floating around having a good time with some of his friends, male and female, here was Bob up here calling on the phone. 'I want to do this, and would you help me?' He had it all committed so that when Teddy got back to town, Teddy didn't know what hit him, but it was already all over. That was Lyndon Johnson's style. Bob Byrd learned that from watching Lyndon Johnson." [...] Byrd himself had told Smathers that [...] " [...] I have never in my life played a game of cards. I have never in my life had a golf club in my hand. I have never in life hit a tennis ball. I have—believe it or not—never thrown a line over to catch a fish.

He asked me what way I had taken in coming to New England, and when I told him, and began to rave of the beauty and quaintness of French Canada, and to pour out my joy in Quebec, he said, with a smile that had now lost all its frost, Yes, Quebec was a bit of the seventeenth century; it was in many ways more French than France, and its people spoke the language of Voltaire, with the accent of Voltaire's time.|$|R

60|$|But in {{the morning}} some of this {{bitterness}} had worn away. His last resolve overnight had been {{to go to the}} brewery before breakfast, at which period of the day Mr. Tappitt was always to be found for half an hour in his counting-house, and curtly tell the brewer that all further negotiations between them must be made by their respective lawyers; but as he was dressing, he reflected that Mr. Tappitt's position was certainly one of difficulty, that amicable arrangements would still be best if amicable arrangements were possible, and that something was due to the man who had for so many years been his uncle's partner. Mr. Tappitt, moreover, was not responsible for <b>any</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> evil <b>things</b> which had been said about Rachel by Mrs. Tappitt. Therefore, priding himself somewhat on his charity, he entered Mr. Tappitt's office without the display <b>of</b> <b>any</b> anger on his face.|$|R
6000|$|And {{then the}} young man stood silent, as though {{there was nothing more}} to be said. Indeed, he had nothing more to say.

The baronet sat for a while, silent also, and a cloud of anger was coming across his brow; but he checked that before he spoke. [...] "Well, my boy," [...] he said, and his voice was almost more than usually kind, [...] "I can understand your thoughts, and we will say nothing of them at present.

50|$|When {{a tenant}} or {{intruder}} approaches a trap, the player may trap them by arming and then activating the trap. Trapping a tenant sometimes {{has no real}} consequences, but often results in a game over. If the player does not trap a solid majority of intruders as they appear, the game ends. Also, while most intruders do no particular harm when they appear, the player must trap any enemies who try to shut off the building's power, disconnect the phone lines, or attack the tenants. If an enemy succeeds in <b>any</b> one <b>of</b> <b>those</b> three <b>things,</b> the game immediately ends.|$|R

So it was very important to me, extremely important to me, that everything that had happened before be well preserved and be enhanced if possible by what we're doing now." [...] He also said, [...] "you could never replace Matt Damon as Jason Bourne. This isn't James Bond. You can't do a prequel.

What shall we say to a man who thus reserves his determination, who threatens to sell a tributary prince to a tyrant, and cannot decide whether he should take from him his forts and pillage him of all he had, whether he should raise 500,000l. upon him, whether he should accept the 220,000l. offered, (which, by the way, we never knew of till long after the whole transaction,) whether he should do <b>any</b> or all <b>of</b> <b>those</b> <b>things,</b> and then, by his own account, going up to Benares without having resolved anything upon this important subject? ...|$|R

60|$|During {{the time}} that {{preparations}} were going on for making examples of these impertinent pirates, who had dared to enter the port of Campeachy, Roc was racking his brains to find some method {{of getting out of}} the terrible scrape into which he had fallen. This was a branch of the business in which a capable pirate was obliged to be proficient; if he could not get himself out of scrapes, he could not expect to be successful. In this case there was no chance of cutting down sentinels, or jumping overboard with a couple of wine-jars for a life-preserver, or <b>of</b> doing <b>any</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> ordinary <b>things</b> which pirates were in the habit of doing when escaping from their captors. Roc and his men were in a dungeon on land, inside of a fortress, and if they escaped from this, they would find themselves unarmed {{in the midst of a}} body of Spanish soldiers. Their stout arms and their stout hearts were of no use to them now, and they were obliged to depend upon their wits if they had any. Roc had plenty of wit, and he used it well. There was a slave, probably not a negro nor a native, but most likely some European who had been made prisoner, who came in to bring him food and drink, and by the means of this man the pirate hoped to play a trick upon the Governor. He promised the slave that if he would help him,--and he told him it would be very easy to do so,--he would give him money enough to buy his freedom and to return to his friends, and this, of course, was a great inducement to the poor fellow, who may have been an Englishman or a Frenchman in good circumstances at home. The slave agreed to the proposals, and the first thing he did was to bring some writing-materials to Roc, who thereupon began the composition of a letter upon which he based all his hopes of life and freedom.|$|R
60|$|My {{meaning in}} regard to the impermanence of {{physical}} entities may perhaps be made clearer by the use of Bergson's favourite illustration of the cinematograph. When I first read Bergson's statement that the mathematician conceives the world after the analogy of a cinematograph, I had never seen a cinematograph, and my first visit to one was determined by the desire to verify Bergson's statement, which I found to be completely true, at least so far as I am concerned. When, in a picture palace, we see a man rolling down hill, or running away from the police, or falling into a river, or doing <b>any</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> other <b>things</b> to which men in such places are addicted, we know that there is not really only one man moving, but a succession of films, each with a different momentary man. The illusion of persistence arises only through the approach to continuity in the series of momentary men. Now what I wish to suggest is that in this respect the cinema is a better metaphysician than common sense, physics, or philosophy. The real man too, I believe, however the police may swear to his identity, is really a series of momentary men, each different one from the other, and bound together, not by a numerical identity, but by continuity and certain intrinsic causal laws. And what applies to men applies equally to tables and chairs, the sun, moon and stars. Each of these is to be regarded, not as one single persistent entity, but as a series of entities succeeding each other in time, each lasting for a very brief period, though probably not for a mere mathematical instant. In saying this I am only urging the same kind of division in time as we are accustomed to acknowledge in the case of space. A body which fills a cubic foot will be admitted to consist of many smaller bodies, each occupying only a very tiny volume; similarly a thing which persists for an hour is to be regarded as composed of many things of less duration. A true theory of matter requires a division of things into time-corpuscles as well as into space-corpuscles.|$|R
60|$|After {{that he did}} go {{into the}} City, and succeeded in finding both Mr Smith and Herr Croll. When he reached Abchurch Lane, the news of Melmotte's death had already been spread abroad; and more was known or said to be known, of his {{circumstances}} than Nidderdale had as yet heard. The crushing blow to him, so said Herr Croll, had been the desertion of Cohenlupe,--that and the sudden fall {{in the value of}} the South Central Pacific and Mexican Railway shares, consequent on the rumours spread about the City respecting the Pickering property. It was asserted in Abchurch Lane that had he not at that moment touched the Pickering property, or entertained the Emperor, or stood for Westminster, he must, by the end of the autumn, have been able to do <b>any</b> or all <b>of</b> <b>those</b> <b>things</b> without danger, simply as the result of the money which would then have been realized by the railway. But he had allowed himself to become hampered by the want of comparatively small sums of ready money, and in seeking relief had rushed from one danger to another, till at last the waters around him had become too deep even for him, and had overwhelmed him. As to his immediate death, Herr Croll expressed not the slightest astonishment. It was just the thing, Herr Croll said, that he had been sure that Melmotte would do, should his difficulties ever become too great for him. 'And dere vas a leetle ting he lay himself open by de oder day,' said Croll, 'dat vas nasty,-- very nasty.' Nidderdale shook his head, but asked no questions. Croll had alluded to the use of his own name, but did not on this occasion make any further revelation. Then Croll made a further statement to Lord Nidderdale, which I think he must have done in pure good-nature. 'Mylor,' he said, whispering very gravely, 'de money of de yong lady is all her own.' Then he nodded his head three times. 'Nobody can toch it, not if he vas in debt millions.' Again he nodded his head.|$|R
