30|$|Patrizia Mondello, MD, {{graduated}} with mark 110 / 110 cum laude in Medicine and Surgery at the University of Messina (Italy) in 2009 defending an experimental thesis entitled “Primary Lymphoma {{of the central}} nervous system” and is currently attending the fourth year of the post-graduate specialization in Oncology. She pursues different cancer specializations, focusing on the hematoncology field. She has received many awards and spent long periods in Germany and the USA, furthering her medical and <b>anguage</b> <b>knowledge.</b> She is currently spending {{a year at the}} Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in New York working in the laboratory of Dr. Anas Younes as research fellow and furthering her knowledge of translational research in the lymphomas field. She is also co-author of scientific papers published in national and international peer-review journals. Her main fields of research focus on pathophysiology in onco- and hematology fields and translational research.|$|E
40|$|We aim at {{identifying}} {{the content and}} design principles of KnowLang, a new formal <b>anguage</b> for <b>knowledge</b> representation in a particular class of autonomic systems termed ASCENS. Autonomic Service-Component Ensembles (ASCENS) are multi-agent systems formed as mobile, intelligent and open-ended swarms of special autonomic service components capable of local and distributed reasoning. Such components encapsulate rules, constraints and mechanisms for self-adaptation and acquire and process knowledge about themselves, other service components, and their environment. With KnowLang we provide a development environment that strives to answer fundamental questions related to knowledge representation and reasoning in ASCENS. Knowledge in such systems is structured into knowledge domains each composed of domain ontology and a logical framework providing knowledge vocabulary and logical foundations used for reasoning. We formalize our approach to KnowLang in terms of formal specification layers, syntax, and parameterization required to cover the specification of the ASCENS knowledge domains and reasoning primitives...|$|R
