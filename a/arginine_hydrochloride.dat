Most of these therapies are neither well tolerated nor totally effective, {{and many are}} associated with significant adverse effects. Vasopressin receptor antagonists, also known as vaptans, are {{a new class of}} agents that now offer an additional treatment option for hyponatremic patients. Conivaptan hydrochloride, a competitive antagonist of vasopressin V 1 a and V 2 receptors, is the first agent in this class to be approved for treatment of euvolemic and hypervolemic hyponatremia in hospitalized patients. Aims: This review critically assesses the evidence that support the use of conivaptan for the treatment of patients with euvolemic and hypervolemic hyponatremia.

40|$|INTRODUCTION: N-Acetylglutamate synthase (NAGS) {{deficiency}} {{is a rare}} urea cycle disorder, {{which may}} present in the neonatal period with severe hyperammonemia and marked neurological impairment. CASE REPORT: We report on a Turkish family with a patient who died due to hyperammonemia in the neonatal period. Reduced activity of NAGS and carbamyl phosphate synthetase were found at autopsy. A second child who developed hyperammonemia {{on the second day}} of life was immediately treated with <b>arginine</b> <b>hydrochloride,</b> sodium benzoate and protein restriction. After NAGS deficiency was suspected by enzyme analysis, sodium benzoate was replaced by N-carbamylglutamate (NCG). A third child who developed slight hyperammonemia on the third day of life was treated with NCG before enzyme analysis confirmed reduced NAGS activity. Neither of the patients developed hyperammonemia in the following years. After the human NAGS gene was identified, mutation analysis revealed that the older sibling on NCG therapy was homozygous for a 971 G>A (W 324 X) mutation. The parents and the younger sibling were heterozygous. Therapy was continued in the older sibling until now without any adverse effects and favourable neurodevelopment outcome. In the younger sibling, therapy was stopped without any deterioration of urea cycle function. CONCLUSION: NAGS deficiency can be successfully treated with NCG and <b>arginine</b> <b>hydrochloride</b> with favourable outcome. Molecular diagnostic rather than enzyme analysis should be used in patients with suspected NAGS deficiency...|$|E

The aims of this study were to develop a novel method for detecting TK activity and to investigate its association with event-free survival over 5 years in Chinese first-ever stroke patients. Methods. We designed a case-control study with 321 stroke patients (174 : ischemic stroke, 147 : hemorrhagic stroke) and 323 healthy local controls. TK activity was measured by a novel assay utilizing the immunological characteristics of TK and the catalysis of benzoyl <b>arginine</b> ethyl ester <b>hydrochloride</b> (BAEE). Results. TK protein levels above 0. 200 [*]mg/L in plasma were not associated with urinary TK activity or the risk of stroke recurrence. TK activity was significantly lower in stroke patients compared with controls (1. 583 ± 0. 673 [*]Eu/mL versus 1. 934 ± 0. 284 [*]Eu/mL, P< 0. 001). After adjusting for traditional risk factors, TK activity was negatively associated, in a dose-response manner, with the risk of overall stroke recurrence and positively associated with event-free survival during a 5 -year follow-up (relative risk (RR), 0. 69; 95 % CI, 0. 57 – 0. 84; P< 0. 001).

Responses to nitrogen nutrients provided growth contour plots illustrating the interaction between ammonium and nitrate nutrients, with optimal growth in the vicinity of 3 mM ammonium and 15 mM nitrate ions. Arginine was able to replace ammonia entirely, nitrate was necessary for good growth. Glutamine and asparagine were also growth effective, whereas little benefit was found with lysine, ornithine, or glutamate, and urea yielded an intermediate response. Higher levels of lysine (3 mM), glutamate (10 mM), or casein hydrolysate (lOmM amino acids) resulted in growth reduction.

A protein solution was mixed with PS particles, and then adsorption of protein was monitored by the concentration and activity of protein in the supernatant after centrifugation.

They are expected interaction between carboxyl groups of hyaluronan and amino groups of amino acids. These interactions were investigated by using ultrasonic spectroscopy, DLS, measuring pH and conductivity. Obtained results were compared with sodium polystyrene sulfonate. With ultrasonic spectroscopy was observed a change of concentration inkrement for titration of amino acid to water or polymers solutions especially for high molecular weight hyaluronan and for NaPSS in combination with 6 AKK in concentration range of added amino acid 0 – 30 mM. The size of this change could mean a degree of interaction between polymers and amino acids. This theory has not been confirmed by other methods. By pH and conductivity measurements interations between arginine and low molecular weight hyaluronan and NaPSS were only confirmed. There was no possibility to make unequivocal conclusions from determination of particle size and zeta potential by DLS. Overall, the issue of the interaction of amino acids with polyanions was proved above expectations complex and will be appropriate to further expand the observations made in this thesis...|$|E

In this work we have applied molecular dynamics with all atom potentials in order to study the thermodynamic effect of additives on proteins.

Extensive study was done on model systems comprising of additives urea, glycerol & <b>arginine</b> <b>hydrochloride</b> and proteins RNaseT 1 and hen egg lysozyme. Trajectories in range 10 - 19 nanoseconds were analyzed in order to validate this method and compared with the experimental results. The method was found to agree with experimental results for the first 2 nanoseconds and the extended runs were studied further to narrow down the cause of deviations. Protein RNaseT 1 {{was found to be}} very unstable and consequently showed very high deviations in preferential binding for longer runs.

40|$|The {{stabilization}} of proteins {{by a variety}} of co-solvents can be related to their property of increasing the surface tension of water. It is demonstrated that, during the thermal unfolding of proteins, this increase of the surface tension can be overcome by the increase in the temperature of the solution at the midpoint of the transition, Tm, and the weak binding of co-solvent molecules. Three such co-solvents were studied: trehalose, lysine hydrochloride (LysHCl), and <b>arginine</b> <b>hydrochloride</b> (ArgHCl). Trehalose and LysHCl increase the midpoint of Tm. The increase of the surface tension by addition of trehalose is completely compensated by its decrease due to the increase in Tm. However, for LysHCl, the increase of the surface tension by the co-solvent is partly reduced by its binding to the protein. For trehalose, preferential interaction measurements with RNaseA demonstrate that it is totally excluded from the protein. In contrast, LysHCl gives evidence of binding to RNaseA. ArgHCl also increases the surface tension of water. Nevertheless, Tm of RNaseA decreases on addition of ArgHCl to the solution. Preferential interaction measurements showed very small values of preferential hydration of the native protein, indicating extensive binding of ArgHCl to the protein. During unfolding, the amount of additional ArgHCl binding is sufficiently large to counteract the surface tension effects, and the protein is destabilized. Therefore, although surface tension appears to be a critical factor in the {{stabilization of}} proteins, its increase by co-solvent does not ensure increased stabilization. The binding of ligands can reduce significantly, or even overwhelm, its effects...|$|E

Triptophan, cystine and 1 -methionin increased the effect of urinary protective colloids both in Ogawa's method and Yamazoe's method in vitro. On the other hand, <b>arginine</b> <b>hydrochloride,</b> isoleutine, lysin and glutamic acid increased the protective colloidal effect only in Yamazoe's method in vitro. Polytamin, mastigen B 12, rutin, neo-strong Minophagen C and its co n stituent components (glycyrrhizine, glycyrrhezic acid and glucose cysteine) incresed the protective colloidal effect both in Yamazoe's method and Ogawa's method in vitro. On the other hand, methio-mastigen B 12 revealed the effect only in Ogawa's method, and chondroitin sulfate revealed the effect only in Yamazoe's method. 2) As a clinical experiment, neo-s t r ong Minophagen C, hyaluronidase and chondroitin sulfate {{were given to the}} patients with urolithiasis. It was found that neo-strong Minophagen C and chondroitin sulfate increased the protective colloidal effect in urine, and hyaluronidase did not show an obvious increasing effect. It is obscure, however, that such an increasing effect of chondroitin sulfate is due to the chondroitin sulfate itself or some unknown substance in the metabolic process of chondroitin sulfate. The protective effect of neo-strong Minophagen C seems to be a direct protection for urinary salts, and glycyrrhizine particularly glycyrrhezic acid, above all other constituent elements of neostrong Minophagen C, seems most effective. 3) From the results of salt p rezipitated experiment, electrodes were inserted into urine, with or without addition of polytamin, neo-strong Minophagen C and its constituent components and chondroitin sulfate, it was recognized that the amount of prezipitated salts were decreased by the addition of these substances.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to determine whether spray drying is an appropriate method for the production of respirable particles of therapeutic proteins. Meeting this objective requires that active, stable, dry powders in the 1 - 5 μm size range be obtained. A model protein, β-galactosidase, was used throughout the study. ^ The first part of the experimental work focused on the effect of various processing and formulation variables on the critical quality attributes of the spray dried protein (residual activity, moisture content, particle size and yield). Statistically designed experiments were used so that both direct and interactive effects of the variables could be identified, and the most appropriate formulation and process established. In order to obtain acceptable product yields and moisture contents, relatively harsh drying conditions were required. This necessitated the inclusion of a stabilizer in the formulation to preserve enzyme activity. Trehalose was found to be the most suitable stabilizer of those evaluated (sucrose, mannitol, <b>arginine</b> <b>hydrochloride</b> and trehalose). ^ Subsequent experiments were carried out to evaluate the in vitro deposition properties of the spray dried β-galactosidase from dry powder inhaler devices. Respirable fractions were determined using the twin impinger and cascade impactor. These in vitro devices divide the 2 ̆ 7 inspired 2 ̆ 7 dose into different size fractions enabling the amount of material in the respirable size range to be calculated. The respirable fractions were comparable with published values for conventional small molecule drugs. The spray dried powders were found to be extremely sensitive to moisture with dramatic reductions in respirable fractions occurring after exposure of the powders to environments of high humidity. ^ The respirable fractions were highly dependent on the inhaler device used, and the powder formulation. With less efficient inhaler devices, the presence of a coarser carrier material blended with the spray dried powder substantially improved the respirable fractions. The cascade impactor and twin impinger gave comparable estimates for respirable fractions and were both found to be suitable evaluation methods for dry powder inhalers. The merits of other size analysis methods in the testing of dry powders for inhalation were also evaluated. ...|$|E
40|$|Previous {{studies have}} shown that the non-alpha-helical, amino-terminal head region of vimentin is {{essential}} for the formation and stability of vimentin intermediate filaments (IFs). In order to specify its target site on companion protein subunits, it was cut off from vimentin at amino acid position 96 with lysine-specific endoproteinase and allowed to react with intact vimentin and other IF proteins. In solution of high salt concentration (500 mM KCl), the isolated polypeptide (vim NT) showed a high affinity for all cytoplasmic IF proteins tested, but not for nuclear lamins. Employing limited digestion of the IF proteins with different proteinases, the binding site was shown to reside in their alpha-helical rod domains. Other polypeptides possessing alpha-helical regions with the potential to form coiled-coil structures like tropomyosin and myosin subfragment 2 did not react with vim NT. The binding to IF proteins was strongly inhibited by phosphorylation of vim NT and totally abolished in the presence of 200 mM <b>arginine</b> <b>hydrochloride,</b> whereas the same concentration of lysine hydrochloride was ineffective. Limited chymotryptic digestion of vim NT produced polypeptides that were unable to react with the alpha-helical region of vimentin at high salt concentration. Consistent with these observations, vim NT strongly inhibited filament formation in vitro from protofilamentous vimentin. A 14 -mer oligopeptide comprising the amino acids 3 to 16 of the amino terminus also inhibited filament formation, though to a lesser extent. Conversely, vim NT and, with a lower efficiency, the 14 -mer oligopeptide also severely affected the structure of preformed vimentin filaments by unraveling them. Phosphorylated vim NT was considerably less active in this respect. Further digestion of the rod domain of vimentin with chymotrypsin yielded 17. 4 and 21 kDa polypeptides, which were tentatively characterized as originating from the carboxy- and amino-terminal half of the rod domain, respectively. Both formed salt-stable complexes with vim NT, the smaller polypeptide with a higher efficiency than the larger one. These results suggest that the staggered, antiparallel arrangement of the two coiled-coils in the protofilaments of IF proteins is, at least in part, determined by the twofold, symmetrical association of the amino-terminal head regions of one coiled-coil rope structure with the carboxy-terminal halves of the alpha-helical rod domains of the other coiled-coil and that similar interactions occur during filament assembly and in the intact filament...|$|E
