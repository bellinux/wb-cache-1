The problem was analyzed mostly {{in the context of}} developing and transition countries, though not only the recent financial crisis showed the severity of corruption also in the world's most developed countries.

This hinders the development of the pervasive spaces. If pervasive systems is going to be included into a particular mass production device, for example cars, {{you should be able to}} give a percentage of how secure is your system. For example, testing the robustness of the new artificial intelligence layers to increase the capabilities of the pervasive spaces will require large amounts of data portraying different scenarios. Then, it is necessary to design realistic simulations of the pervasive spaces to study the possible advantages <b>and</b> <b>limitations</b> <b>of</b> <b>particular</b> collections of actuators, sensors and systems. A first steep in this direction is trying to simulate chain of events from the sensor output space by the use of pattern recognition models. Specifically, we propose the use of Markov Chains to generate patterns of events due to the fact that they have been used successfully to classify chains of events in machine learning and computer vision. In addition, we propose the use of Poisson spike generators for the randomization of the time stamps for these events. Finally, we use a series of distributions over the ranges of each sensor to obtain a realistic spread on the sensor output values. We believe these strategies will make for a more realistic simulation of the space of sensors in a pervasive space.

40|$|Evaluating {{the success}} of adjudicative tribunals is an {{important}} but elusive undertaking. Adjudicative tribunals are created by governments and given statutory authority by legislatures {{for a host of}} reasons. These reasons may and often do include legal aspects, policy aspects and partisan aspects. While such tribunals are increasingly being asked by governments to be accountable, too often this devolves into publishing statistics on their caseload, dispositions, budgets and staffing. We are interested in a different and more basic question – are these tribunals successful? How do we know, for example, whether the remedies ordered by a tribunal actually do advance the purposes for which it was created? Can {{the success of}} an adjudicative tribunal be subject to meaningful empirical validation? While issues of evaluation and accountability cut across national and jurisdictional boundaries, the authors argue that this type of question can only be addressed empirically, by actually looking to the practice of a particular board or boards, {{in the context of a}} particular statute or statutes, and in particular jurisdictions at particular times. Such accounts can and should form the basis for comparative study. Only through comparative study can the value <b>and</b> <b>limitations</b> <b>of</b> <b>particular</b> methodologies become apparent. This study takes as its case study the role of adjudicative tribunals in the health system.

40|$|This article takes up, {{but in a}} {{different}} key, an argument of postmodernists that the over-rationalized conception of society tends to ignore important phenomena such as those belonging to the symbolic domain. It is suggested that the emerging programme of symbolic sociology may contribute toward a new synthetic and interdisciplinary thinking in social sciences. The concept of symbolism as a social phenomenon {{rather than as an}} autonomous linguis-tic or semiotic system is presented; and the argument is made that if social knowledge is constitutive of society, similarly collective sentiments, tempo-rality and collective memory are also symbolically produced. They are created from and create discursive symbolism, symbolic objects and symbolic behaviours. Finally, the article focuses on collective actions where the sociology of symbolic processes is most promising. Key words collective action symbolic power symbolism Synthesis through Symbolism? The last {{decade of the twentieth century}} seemed to portend the development of a synthetic approach in sociological theory, leading it beyond the boundaries <b>and</b> <b>limitations</b> <b>of</b> <b>particular</b> paradigms and their variations. An example of this can be found in the postulate of a synthetic interactionism within the bounds of symbolic interactionism (Fine, 1992). The path was opened for such initiatives by important debates in the 1980 s concerning the problematic dissonance between microsociology and macrosociology, as well as the antimony between investigations of subjective actions or objective structures. Although as yet in the realm of a potential, symbolic processes in collective action constitute a nodal point for a synthesis. It can be claimed that symbolic sociology already exists in many initiatives, but in contrast to so-called symbolic anthropology, it does no...|$|E
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{presents a}} study {{of the ways in which}} concepts of pain were treated across a broad range of late Victorian writing, placing literary texts alongside sermons, medical textbooks and campaigning leaflets, in order to suggest a pattern of representation and evasion to be perceived throughout the different texts assembled. In the first two chapters I establish the cultural and historical background to physical suffering in the late nineteenth century, as the Christian paradigm for suffering (the subject of the first chapter) lost its pre-eminance to that of medicine (Chapter Two). The next two chapters are concerned with the problem of the expressibility of pain. In Chapter Three I argue that despite popular belief, voiced most clearly by Virginia Woolf, that 'there is no language for pain', sufferers find language that is both metaphorical and directly referential to express their bodily suffering. Chapter Four takes up the cultural restrictions placed on the expression of pain, using the acrimonious debate over vivisection that arose at the end of the century. Bringing together the prolific texts of both vivisectionists and antivivisectionists, I display the possibilities <b>and</b> <b>limitations</b> <b>of</b> <b>particular</b> literary forms, arguing, for example, that language appropriate to medical textbooks proved to be too shocking in books with a wider circulation. The final chapter is concerned with the ways in which pain was schematised in the last two decades of the nineteenth century. I explore the basis of belief in pain as a shared, cross-cultural phenomenon and make the case, using the examples of invertebrate neurology, fire-walking and tattooing, that the understanding of pain is sharply affected by class, gender, race and supposed degree of criminality, despite the fact that pain is often invoked as a marker of shared human identity. </p...|$|E

40|$|Good {{practices}} in heritage conservation {{are based on}} accurate information about conditions, materials, and transformation of built heritage sites. Therefore, heritage site documentation and its analysis are essential parts for their conservation. In addition, the devastating effects of recent catastrophic events in different geographical areas have highly affected cultural heritage places. Such areas include and {{are not limited to}} South Europe, South East Asia, and Central America. Within this framework, appropriate acquisition of information can effectively provide tools for the decision-making process and management. Heritage documentation is growing in innovation, providing dynamic opportunities for effectively responding to the alarming rate of destruction by natural events, conflicts, and negligence. In line with these considerations, a multidisciplinary team – including students and faculty members from Carleton University and Yangon Technological University, as well as staff from the Department of Archaeology, National Museum and Library (DoA) and professionals from the CyArk foundation – developed a coordinated strategy to document four temples in the site of Bagan (Myanmar). On-field work included capacity-building activities to train local emerging professionals in the heritage field (graduate and undergraduate students from the Yangon Technological University) and to increase the technical knowledge of the local DoA staff in the digital documentation field. Due to the short time of the on-field activity and the need to record several monuments, a variety of documentation techniques, including image and non-image based ones, were used. Afterwards, the information acquired during the fieldwork was processed to develop a solid base for the conservation and monitoring of the four documented temples. The relevance of developing this kind of documentation in Bagan is related to the vulnerability of the site, often affected by natural seismic events and flooding, as well as the lack of maintenance. Bagan provided an excellent case study to test the effectiveness of the proposed approach, to prevent and manage the damages of catastrophic events, and to support retrofitting actions. In order to test the flexibility of adopted methodology and workflow, temples with different features – in terms of architectural design, shape, and geometry – were selected. The goals of these documentation activities range from testing digital documentation workflows for the metric and visual recording of the site (reviewing strengths <b>and</b> <b>limitations</b> <b>of</b> <b>particular</b> recording techniques), to the definition of effective conditions assessment strategies...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{describes}} {{and examines}} curatorial approaches and models of institutional practice which {{have emerged as}} a response to transformations in contemporary art, particularly as engendered by new media art and socially engaged practices, as well as wider changes regarding the role and functioning of culture in contemporary society. Focusing on institutional and curatorial praxis at the Foundation for Art and Creative Technology (FACT) in Liverpool – the first purpose built gallery for presenting new media art in the UK – this study examines practicalities and challenges of new institutional and curatorial formats in the context of critical debates about the role and shape of art institutions, new models of artistic and curatorial practice, as well as wider socio-political and economic aspects of cultural management. The thesis is a result of collaborative research conducted at FACT, which included an intense period of practical involvement in FACT’s operations through the co-curating of Turning FACT Inside Out exhibition, which celebrated the 10 th anniversary of the FACT building. Combining different methodological tools including curatorial practice, participant observation, interviews and case studies, this research gives behind the scenes insight into FACT’s programming, particularly the modes of production and curatorial practice. It demonstrates how curatorial and production approaches develop within a particular institutional framework and how this institutional framework, in turn, influences the practice of curators. The research examines both advantages <b>and</b> <b>limitations</b> <b>of</b> <b>particular</b> institutional and curatorial models of working while providing insight into different factors shaping institutional agendas as well as complexities and contingencies of cultural production and management.   The analysis of FACT’s curatorial practice described and examined different approaches with the most distinct ones being context-responsive, durational and collaborative curatorial ways of working. With regard to institutional practice, the findings indicate that FACT shares many similarities with institutional models developed within new media centers and the models of art institutions proposed by new institutionalism. The analysis indicates that those curatorial and institutional models and ways of working – although not without their challenges – provide suitable frameworks for supporting a wide range of artistic practices, emerging from socially engaged and new media art. The study also concludes that those models of working, as examined in the context of FACT, imply a shift {{in the role of the}} curator to that of the producer, with particular emphasis on delivery tasks and production of content rather than context. Findings also suggest that economic aspects will play a significant role in defining the future shape of art institutions, which will need to develop strategies towards sustainable business models including flexible employment structures and project-based models of working. These come with a danger of the institution being too delivery focused and loosing sight of its role as a knowledge producer. The flexible and cost effective employment structure may also lead to the dissipation of the institutional knowledge base while contributing to the already precarious labour conditions in the arts...|$|E
40|$|In this dissertation, I {{explore how}} the post-Soviet Latvian state {{and people are}} invited and {{pressured}} to become European through discourses and practices of tolerance promotion, which have emerged as an integral element of contemporary liberal political culture in Europe. I locate this intervention in the broader context of the "minority problem" through which Eastern European states and peoples have been {{and continue to be}} governed by supranational organizations, such as the League of Nations {{at the beginning of the}} 20 th century and the Council of Europe in the present. My work examines concrete practices of tolerance promotion through which local and international human rights and minority organizations, as well as international monitoring bodies, ask Latvians to reflect upon and remake their attitudes and conduct in relation to ethnic, racial, sexual or religious difference. Due to the fact that tolerance promotion initiatives draw legitimacy from the various political treaties and human rights conventions that shape the European present in Latvia, many Latvians exhibit skepticism and resentment towards such initiatives and view them as political and legal injunctions that misrecognize the historical specificity of public and political life in Latvia, especially the way in which the Soviet past bears upon the present. Consequently, in the view of human rights and minority activists and organizations, the problem of intolerance is often closely linked with the problem of Latvian nationalism, which constitutes an obstacle on the road to acquiring political and cultural membership in Europe. In my research, therefore, I focus specifically on how the historical community of Latvians is constituted through arguments about tolerance in Latvia. Rather than explain the Latvians' reluctance to embrace the liberal politics of tolerance as a problem of backward nationalism, I offer a more complex analysis of the historical and political contexts that produce such a reaction. For example, my research shows that the transnational discourses of tolerance tend to take for granted particular notions of sexual, racial, and ethnic identities, which, in turn, give rise to specific understandings of public and political life. Consequently, the Latvians' skepticism and resentment is largely a reaction to the ways in which the discourses and practices of tolerance attempt to remake public and political life. In six chapters, which focus on politics of injury, minority politics, injurious language, anti-racism, gay and lesbian activism, and the practice of critical reflection, I show that arguments about racism in Latvia are not only about whether there is racism in Latvia or not, but also about how public reflection on racism matters for the collective life of Latvians in the current historical moment; or how arguments about intolerant language are not only about which words are injurious and which are not, but also about the historical conditions that enable the question of injury to be posed at all; or how arguments about gay and lesbian politics are not only arguments about normative morality, but also about different conceptions of self and associated forms of political engagement. Most importantly, I show that arguments about the ways in which Latvians should relate to ethnic, racial, or sexual identities are profoundly shaped by concerns that the injunction to publicly reflect on the problem of intolerance misrecognizes the demands that the recent and injurious Soviet past places upon public and political life in the present. The dissertation is based on ethnographic fieldwork I conducted between 2005 and 2008 on the implementation of the European Union funded National Program for the Promotion of Tolerance, which was launched in 2004. My primary research object was the practices through which the problem of intolerance was introduced, addressed, and contested as a matter of public reflection and conduct. My field site was therefore constituted, on the one hand, by the activities of a network of government institutions and human rights and minority organizations that aimed to address problems such as racism, homophobia, and intolerant speech, and, on the other hand, by ordinary Latvians' responses and reflections on these issues. While my ethnographic research focused on the discourses and practices of tolerance that have emerged in the Latvian public sphere during the last seven years, my work is not primarily aimed at a critical examination of tolerance as a particular kind of political rationality. Rather, I am interested in arguments about tolerance that unfold in a specific historical conjuncture in Latvia at the intersection of the Soviet past and the European present. Moreover, I am interested in the kind of political subjects and relations between them that are constituted through arguments about tolerance and what they tell us not only about the post-Soviet Latvian present, but also about the European present more generally. In analyzing the discourses and practices of tolerance, my aim is thus threefold: (1) to trace how the historical community of Latvians is constituted through arguments about tolerance; (2) to show that this historical community of Latvians cannot simply be characterized as animated by deeply rooted nationalism, but is rather an effect of political subjectivation that unfolds at the intersection of imperial, colonial, and communist trajectories; and (3) to show how the historical specificity of public and political life in Latvia illuminates the possibilities <b>and</b> <b>limitations</b> <b>of</b> <b>particular</b> analytical frameworks, such as that of nationalism, as well as of liberal political culture in Europe...|$|E

One of the most disturbing methodological problems is the impossibility of translating individual into collective cus-tomer demands and the impossibility of translating cus-tomer demands into engineering characteristics without violating one or more very reasonable conditions. These problems are due to Arrow’s Impossibility Theorem. I discuss whether a number of alternative QFD approaches are helpful in overcoming these methodological problems and suggest directions for the further development of QFD and for research...|$|R

In the condition where machinic systems seek the unforeseen and the emergent, {{there is also a}} possibility for the unforeseen error to slip into existence. This condition {{can be seen in the}} emerging tradition of artists using error as a creative tool. In his paper “The Aesthetics of Failure: ‘Post-Digital’ Tendencies in Contemporary Music,” Kim Cascone points to the way in which composers, using digital means, exploit the inadequacies <b>of</b> a <b>particular</b> compositional or performative technology (Cascone 13). Cascone cites composers such as Ryoji Ikeda who create minimalist electronic compositions using media as both their form and theme. In these compositions, the errors, imperfections, <b>and</b> <b>limitations</b> <b>of</b> the <b>particular</b> compositional media are the central constituting elements of the piece. In addition to music, this glitch aesthetic is also exploited in the visual arts. Artists such as Tony Scott set up situations in which errors are able to emerge and be exploited in the art making process. In these types of work the artist’s role is to allow a glitch or an error to arise in a specific system, then to reconfigure and exploit the generative qualities of the unforeseen error...|$|R

Web search engine is a tool designed to search for information on the World Wide Web, which may be in the form of web pages, images, information, and other types of files. Search engines for internet-based search of medical literature include Google, Google scholar, Yahoo search engine, etc., and databases include MEDLINE, PubMed, MEDLARS, etc. Commercial web resources (Medscape, MedConnect, MedicineNet) add to the list of resource databases providing some of their content for open access. Several web-libraries (Medical matrix, Emory libraries) have been developed as meta-sites, providing useful links to health resources globally. Availability of specific dermatology-related websites (DermIs, DermNet, and Genamics Jornalseek) is useful addition to the ever growing list of web-based resources. A researcher must keep in mind the strengths <b>and</b> <b>limitations</b> <b>of</b> a <b>particular</b> search engine/database while searching for a <b>particular</b> type <b>of</b> data. Knowledge about types of literature and levels of detail available, user interface, ease of access, reputable content, and period of time covered allow their optimal use and maximal utility in the field of medicine...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{deals with}} the {{experimental}} determination of the shrinkage progress of the polymer cement (PCC) mortars. The main motivation of performed measurements was to compare the results obtained from two different measurement procedures based on the measurement of the relative length changes and relative mass losses of the test specimens during whole time of ageing. Performed experimental analysis, focused on {{the determination of the}} progress of the relative length changes and relative mass losses, showed advantages and disadvantages of investigated measurement procedures. All performed measurements exhibited almost the same total progress of relative mass losses regardless of the used test procedure and size of specimens. The differences in the relative length changes originated from the capabilities, <b>limitations</b> <b>and</b> regulations <b>of</b> <b>particular</b> measurement procedures...|$|R

Design for Sustainable Behaviour (DfSB) is a maturing research area concerned with the application of design strategies to influence consumer behaviour during a products use phase towards more sustainable action. However, current DfSB research has focussed on strategy selection with little research into understanding the real-world impact of the behaviour changing interventions debated. This article presents the results of an extensive literature review of one specific DfSB strategy, feedback – a user agentive performance indicator. These findings exemplify the considerations <b>and</b> <b>limitations</b> <b>of</b> this <b>particular</b> approach to behaviour change, drawing on empirical research conducted by a breadth of authors, including two of the only medium-term case studies in the field of DfSB. Considerations discussed include the frequency, duration and accuracy of feedback; the selection of metrics and the presentation medium and mode; the use of ambience and the location <b>of</b> the installation. <b>Limitations</b> <b>of</b> feedback include the need for additional information and comparisons; the issue with multiple users; technical issues; relegation to background technology and the potential rebound effects. This article provides insights to both improve the effectiveness of future feedback design efforts and also to help facilitate discussion on feedbacks position as a strategy within DfSB...|$|R
40|$|The {{development}} and tuning of flight simulator motion filters relies on understanding human motion perception <b>and</b> its <b>limitations.</b> <b>Of</b> <b>particular</b> interest to flight simulation {{is the study}} of visual-inertial coherence zones. Coherence zones refer to combinations of visual and inertial cues that, although not being physically coherent, still provide the pilot with the perception of a congruent motion, indicating a realistic simulation. Coherence zones have been measured before during passive tasks, for predetermined stimuli. During a pilot-in-the-loop simulation, however, the type of inertial and visual cues being provided are considerably influenced by the pilot's control strategy. For this reason, {{it is important to understand}} how the amplitude and frequency content of the stimuli affect the perception of a coherent motion. Three experiments were performed to measure the effect of cue amplitude and frequency on yaw perception coherence zones. In accordance with previous research, the measured coherence zones were generally wider for higher amplitudes of the visual motion cue. At higher amplitudes of the visual cue, subjects preferred inertial motion amplitudes that were lower than the visual cue amplitude. The stimulus frequency was shown to have an effect on the coherence zones. For a higher frequency stimulus the preferred inertial motion amplitudes were significantly lower than for a lower frequency stimulus. These results are explained using a model of the semicircular canals dynamics. Copyright © 2010...|$|R
5000|$|Levels of Knowing and Existence is {{concerned}} with the principle of general semantics and toward that end provides “invariable contextual insights into understanding Alfred Korzybski's Science and Sanity, discussing epistemological, ethical, aesthetic, etc., problems.” [...] Given the subject matter, the book’s approach, structure, and language are remarkably straightforward and relatively easy to grasp without prior study in the field. This aspect of the book is even more pronounced when compared to Korzybski’s Science and Sanity, which is invariably considered a very difficult book to understand. Furthermore, unlike Science and Sanity, Mr. Weinberg uses almost no mathematical formulas in his text. Notwithstanding these differences the two books cover the same basic material and arrive at the same basic conclusions with regard to the central nervous system’s abstraction process in general and the uses <b>and</b> <b>limitations</b> <b>of</b> language in <b>particular.</b> Some <b>of</b> those conclusions are summarized as follows: ...|$|R
