5|$|In September 2015 at Wageningen University in the Netherlands, {{students}} and entrepreneurs presented a fully automatic, prototype vending machine that cooks frozen potato strips by deep frying them. The final product is served with mayonnaise, ketchup or curry. The process takes around two minutes {{from start to}} finish, in which the product is served in a paper cup. The potato strips are stored in a frozen state inside the machine at −18°C, and it cooks them in oil at 180°C. The unit uses a specially-designed dispenser to prevent the potatoes from being crushed or broken. As of September 2015, only the single prototype is available, which is housed at Wageningen University. Orders are placed using a touchscreen, and <b>a</b> <b>fork</b> <b>and</b> salt are provided separately in a box.|$|E
5|$|The second chorus has {{the girls}} {{dancing on the}} table, {{knocking}} several pieces of food and tuppleware onto the ground. A-Chan is seen lying down on a pillow, whilst Kashiyuka balances a book and an apple on her head. Both of these scenes have them throwing several pieces of food onto the table. Nocchi is seen at the dining table, holding <b>a</b> <b>fork</b> <b>and</b> listen to music through her headphones. She witnesses a small door underneath a stool, opens it, and sees a small green room. In the room, a blurred image of a cup starts to become clear, and holds small candy. As the girls eat the pieces of candy, their cream-coloured dresses turn into the outfits from the cover sleeve from the single. The girls start dancing in the fish bowl, surrounded by glittery lights. The final scene has the girls looking through the small door again, only to witness {{the dining room table}} empty; the small cup with candy appears in beige colouring rather than full-on vibrancy.|$|E

25|$|Similar {{to that in}} Arab countries, {{bread is}} served with most meals and is {{generally}} torn into shreds and used by those eating to envelope foods, {{so that they can}} be picked up and conveyed to the mouth, in a manner similar to a sandwich, and also to soak up liquids on the plate. Since people in Afghanistan normally use their hands to eat, the bread thus acts as both <b>a</b> <b>fork</b> <b>and</b> a spoon.|$|E

We then give an example of <b>a</b> <b>forking</b> <b>and</b> nondividing formula. Altogether, T_n provides a counterexample to a recent question of Chernikov and Kaplan. Comment: 11 page...|$|R

25|$|Vienna is {{well known}} for Wiener Schnitzel, a cutlet of veal (Kalbsschnitzel) or pork (Schweinsschnitzel) that is pounded flat, coated in flour, egg and breadcrumbs, and fried in {{clarified}} butter. It is available in almost every restaurant that serves Viennese cuisine and can be eaten hot or cold. The traditional 'Wiener Schnitzel' though is a cutlet of veal. Other examples of Viennese cuisine include Tafelspitz (very lean boiled beef), which is traditionally served with Geröstete Erdäpfel (boiled potatoes mashed with <b>a</b> <b>fork</b> <b>and</b> subsequently fried) and horseradish sauce, Apfelkren (a mixture of horseradish, cream and apple) and Schnittlauchsauce (a chives sauce made with mayonnaise and stale bread).|$|E
25|$|The Baudelaires {{go see the}} Quagmires {{and tell}} them what happened. Then the Quagmires plot a plan. The Quagmires {{disguise}} themselves as Klaus and Violet, get a sack of flour to represent Sunny, and do the exercises (at night) so that the Baudelaire orphans can study and make staples (Coach Genghis doesn't know that it's the Quagmires that are running because it is night time and he can't see them.) The Quagmires leave their notebooks with Violet and Klaus so that they can study. Violet invents a staple-making device (using a small crab, a potato, metal rods, creamed spinach, and <b>a</b> <b>fork)</b> <b>and</b> makes staples while Klaus reads the notebooks out loud.|$|E
25|$|Bolton {{serves a}} unique {{role in the}} post road, {{as it was the}} border between the flat and {{tranquil}} Connecticut River Valley, and the hilly and turbulent Eastern Upper Highlands. Entering Bolton on Middle Turnpike East, the traveler encountered <b>a</b> <b>fork</b> <b>and</b> could choose to head southeast on Bolton Center Street (later Center Street) to the settlement of Bolton, or stay on Middle Turnpike East to reconnect with Route 44 and head east on the original Mohegan Indian Trail through Bolton Notch, a natural depression in the ridge that dramatically sped up transit and served as a demarcation between the two geologic landscapes. Within the Bolton settlement was White's Tavern, notable for having housed the staff of General Rochambeau, whose unit camped in the settlement during the revolutionary war. To exit Bolton, one heads north on Notch Road until reaching Route 44, just outside Bolton Notch. Route 44 then connects to Coventry.|$|E

500|$|Dubbed an [...] "iconoclast" [...] by Boxoffice, Belle {{continues}} to garner media recognition {{for her role}} in Beauty and the Beast. Established as a cultural icon, the character maintains the distinction of being Disney's first feminist princess. Commentators believe that the character's role in Beauty and the Beast as one of Disney's first strong female characters is responsible for changing the way in which women would be depicted in subsequent animated films. According to Kevin Fallon of The Daily Beast, [...] "being a Disney princess meant singing songs about how much you love combing your hair with <b>a</b> <b>fork</b> <b>and</b> giving away your voice if it meant you got to marry the guy with that dreamy chiseled jaw" [...] prior to Belle's arrival. The Los Angeles Times Charles Solomon ranked Belle among the four Disney Princesses responsible for breaking [...] "the bonds of convention." [...] About.com's David Nusair agreed that Belle successfully [...] "updated the princess formula for an entirely new generation." [...] The Atlantics Lindsay Lowe echoed Nusair's sentiment, citing Belle as the character responsible for ending Disney's [...] "history of ... docile heroines." [...] The Daily Campus Cathy Schmidt recognized Belle and Ariel as [...] "the beginnings of the more modern Disney princesses." [...] Writing for Virgin Media, Limara Salt believes that the character [...] "proved that audiences could {{fall in love with a}} brown-haired intellectual." [...] A survey conducted by Disney after the film's release determined that Belle's love of books inspired young women to read. Justin Humphreys of The Hook expressed, [...] "Belle remains a most successful princess because people can relate" [...] to her. Elina Bolokhova of Parenting believes that Belle's [...] "bravery and independence helped redefine the meaning of a Disney princess." [...] According to Justine McGrath of Teen Vogue, Belle has [...] "become one of the most popular classic Disney princesses of all time." [...] Commending her intelligence and lack of vanity, the character was placed at number one on E!'s ranking of the Disney Princesses, while Cosmopolitan ranked her fourth. In the magazine's [...] "Definitive Ranking Of Disney Princesses", Seventeen ranked Belle fifth. Similarly, BuzzFeed also ranked the character fifth, praising her love of reading. A reader poll conducted by BuzzFeed also determined that Belle is the most popular Disney Princess, having garnered 18% of votes. Belle is the fifth most successful Disney Princess in terms of box office revenue, with Beauty and the Beast having grossed over $350 million. However, Belle was the lowest-selling Disney Princess on eBay in 2013, with sales of less than $7,000 despite the fact that she is often cited as a customer favorite.|$|E

2500|$|In Cambodia, <b>a</b> <b>fork</b> <b>and</b> spoon are {{the typical}} {{utensils}} used in Cambodian dining and etiquette. Spoons {{are used to}} scoop up food or water and the fork is there to help guide the food onto the spoon. Chopsticks are normally used in noodle dishes such as the Kuy Tiev and soup dishes. When eating soup the chopsticks will typically be paired with the spoon, where the chopsticks {{will pick up the}} food and the spoon will be used to drink the broth. Forks are never to touch the mouth, it is thought as rude, thus it is not used to eat such dishes.|$|E
