Having failed to take their chances in a semi-final against eventual champions Borussia Dortmund in 1996–97, Ferguson was resolute to go one step further and emulate Matt Busby's success of 1968, quashing <b>any</b> <b>talk</b> that his team was not good enough.|$|E
25|$|Schneerson's {{supporters}} {{have claimed that}} many Jews felt {{that if there was}} indeed a person worthy of such stature, it was Schneerson. Although Schneerson constantly objected to <b>any</b> <b>talk</b> that he could be the Messiah, this notion sparked controversy, particularly among those who were unfamiliar with these traditional teachings.|$|E
25|$|In October, Loos and {{her brother}} Clifford checked Emerson into a very {{expensive}} sanatorium, where {{he was diagnosed with}} schizophrenia. Loos, who had always left the finances to Emerson, soon discovered that most of her money was no longer in joint accounts but in his own private accounts. Overworked at the studio and under stress from Emerson, she became more and more depressed. After 17 years of his nonsense, she finally asked Emerson for a divorce, and he agreed. Loos promptly bought herself out of her United Artists contract and re-signed with MGM, and bought a beach-front house in Santa Monica. Emerson would continue to find ways to stave off <b>any</b> <b>talk</b> of divorce plans, making finalization impossible. When Emerson was deemed well enough to leave the sanatorium, she paid for a nurse to care for him in an apartment of his own.|$|E

25|$|Nasser, by contrast, {{thought that}} <b>any</b> <b>talk</b> of democracy, or of a multi-party system, {{or of the}} {{withdrawal}} of the army from politics, would allow the Wafd, the Muslim Brotherhood and the other political parties to regain the ground they had lost in 1952. In addition, although on paper Naguib appeared to wield a lot of power, being simultaneously president and prime minister, his authority was curtailed {{by the fact that he}} needed a majority vote of the RCC for any decision to be taken, and his opinion was often ignored by the other members of the RCC. The offices he occupied meant that Naguib was responsible for the government's decisions, even though he rarely sanctioned or supported them, and this meant that he was increasingly becoming merely the puppet of others. Eventually, Naguib presented Nasser, by now the real power in the RCC, with an ultimatum: either he was given real power, or he would resign.|$|E
25|$|At the {{parliament}} of 1789 Gustav III united the other estates against the nobility {{and to gain}} {{support for the war}} and for his constitutional reform. Coming into conflict with the nobility, he had many of its representatives imprisoned. This act lead to a social boycott of the monarch by the female members of the aristocracy, who followed the example of Jeanna von Lantingshausen as well as the King's sister and sister-in-law, Sophie Albertine of Sweden and Hedvig Elisabeth Charlotte. The Queen did not participate in this political demonstration and refused to allow <b>any</b> <b>talk</b> of politics in her presence. She was nevertheless involved in the conflict. When the King informed his son about the event, he discovered the child to be already informed in other ways than what he had intended. He suspected Sophia Magdalena to be responsible, and asked the governor of the prince, Count Nils Gyldenstolpe, to speak to her. Gyldenstolpe, however, sent one of the king's favorites, Baron Erik Boye. The Queen, who despised the favorites of the King, furiously told Boye that she spoke to her son how she wished and that only her contempt for him prevented her from having him thrown out of the window. She was known to dislike the reforms of 1789, and she did let it be known to its representatives. At the celebrations of the Victory at Fredrikshamn in 1790, she refused to be escorted by riksråd Count Joakim Beck-Friis, who was in favor of the reform, and demanded to be escorted by Count Axel von Fersen the Elder, who was in opposition to it.|$|E
500|$|At a 23 March {{meeting in}} Dresden in East Germany, {{leaders of the}} [...] "Warsaw Five" [...] (USSR, Hungary, Poland, Bulgaria and East Germany) {{questioned}} a Czechoslovak delegation over the planned reforms, suggesting <b>any</b> <b>talk</b> of [...] "democratization" [...] was a veiled critique of other policies. Władysław Gomułka and János Kádár were less concerned with the reforms themselves than with the growing criticisms levelled by the Czechoslovak media, and worried the situation might be [...] "similar to the prologue of the Hungarian counterrevolution". Some of the language in April's KSČ Action Programme may have been chosen to assert that no counter-revolution was planned, but Kieran Williams suggests that Dubček was perhaps surprised at, but not resentful of, Soviet suggestions.|$|E

500|$|In {{addition}} to the Royal Commission that investigated the Nyasaland violence (now known as the Devlin Report), the British Government organised a second one, known as the Monckton Report, to advise {{on the future of}} the federation. Released in October 1960, the report advocated sweeping changes to be made to the federal structure, including African majorities in the Nyasaland and Northern Rhodesian legislatures. Welensky was outraged when the report was published, calling it the [...] "death knell of federation" [...] and rejecting it out of hand. African nationalist opinion was just as opposed, but on different grounds. All nationalists wanted an end to federation, and independence for the territories as black-majority-ruled states. Welensky was opposed to <b>any</b> <b>talk</b> of secession, and the Monckton Report suggested it in writing when it stated that the territories should have the option after five years under a new federal constitution.|$|E
500|$|After again {{considering}} a candidacy for the 1988 presidential election, influenced by his personal difficulties and family concerns, and content with {{remaining in the}} Senate, in December 1985 Kennedy publicly cut short <b>any</b> <b>talk</b> that he might run. [...] He added: [...] "I know this decision means I may never be president. But {{the pursuit of the}} presidency is not my life. Public service is." [...] Kennedy used his legislative skills to achieve passage of the COBRA Act, which extended employer-based health benefits after leaving a job. Following the 1986 congressional elections, the Democrats regained control of the Senate and Kennedy became chair of the Labor and Public Welfare Committee. [...] By now Kennedy had become what colleague Joe Biden termed [...] "the best strategist in the Senate," [...] who always knew when best to move legislation. Kennedy continued his close working relationship with ranking Republican Senator Orrin Hatch, and they were close allies on many health-related measures.|$|E
500|$|Arsenal {{started their}} defence {{of the league}} {{championship}} at home to Queens Park Rangers on 17 August 1991. It was the visitors who had led the match right from the 15th minute, but for Arsenal midfielder Paul Merson to earn his side a point after equalising well into stoppage time. The draw according to The Independent showcased the need for reinforcements: [...] "...not just to improve the squad, but also to cause a buzz in the dressing room". Arsenal were beaten 3–1 by Everton at Goodison Park three days after and lost to Aston Villa by the same scoreline. Graham dismissed <b>any</b> <b>talk</b> of crisis, saying [...] "I have been in football too long to {{think it is going}} to be nice and comfortable every season" [...] and felt the performance at Villa showed signs of improvement compared to the earlier league fixtures. A 2–0 win at home to Luton Town was followed by victory against Manchester City, where Alan Smith and Limpar scored a goal apiece.|$|E

500|$|Other {{philosophers}} {{of biology}} argue instead that biological teleology is irreducible, and cannot be removed by any simple process of rewording. Francisco Ayala argued that all statements about processes can be trivially translated into teleological statements, and vice versa, but that teleological statements are more explanatory and cannot be disposed of. Karen Neander similarly {{argued that the}} modern concept of biological 'function' depends on natural selection. So, for example, {{it is not possible}} to say that anything that simply winks into existence, without going through a process of selection, actually has functions. We decide whether an appendage has a function by analysing the process of selection that led to it. Therefore, Neander argues, <b>any</b> <b>talk</b> of functions must be posterior to natural selection, function must be defined by reference to the history of a species, and teleology cannot be avoided. The evolutionary biologist Ernst Mayr likewise stated that [...] "adaptedness... is an a posteriori result rather than an a priori goal-seeking." ...|$|E

2500|$|At most, {{however, the}} Winds system {{was to be}} {{implemented}} only if the communications between Japan and Washington were cut, and since this had not happened prior to the attack, {{there was no need}} for it.

2500|$|Heath {{came to be}} seen as a {{liability}} by many Conservative MPs, party activists and newspaper editors. His personality was cold and aloof, annoying even to his friends.

He was a firm advocate of the federal union of the states and rejected <b>any</b> <b>talk</b> of secession, insisting, [...] "I will die with the Union." [...] Blamed for causing the Panic of 1837, he was unpopular in his early retirement. Jackson continued to denounce the [...] "perfidy and treachery" [...] of banks and urged his successor, Van Buren, to repudiate the Specie Circular as president.|$|E

2500|$|Logical positivists such as Rudolf Carnap and A. J. Ayer viewed <b>any</b> <b>talk</b> of gods as literal nonsense. For {{the logical}} positivists and adherents of similar schools of thought, {{statements}} about religious or other transcendent experiences {{can not have}} a truth value, and are deemed to be without meaning, because such statements do not have any clear verification criteria. As the Christian biologist Scott C. Todd put it [...] "Even if all the data pointed to an intelligent designer, such a hypothesis is excluded from science because it is not naturalistic." [...] This argument limits the domain of science to the empirically observable and limits the domain of God to the unprovable.|$|E
2500|$|The {{commemoration}} in 1996 {{represented a}} significant {{break in the}} silence. Yet, during the commemoration, what happened twenty years earlier was retold innumerable times, though without any reference to the undiscussable parts of that history. There was also no reaction, not even any comment, from the military or any conservative organization. More importantly, the denunciation of state crime avoided imputing blame to any specific individual and the victims' self-sacrifice for society's sake was honored. The role played by King Bhumibol in inciting the military and police and paramilitary forces to attack the student protesters was not mentioned {{so as not to}} target the king as an [...] "individual". Yet, this could also be interpreted as an attempt by the state to whitewash history by wishing away parts that it did not want the public to know or remember. In addition, by emphasizing the theme of healing and reconciliation in the remembrance, the Thai state, and by implication the king, have sought to make clear that the commemoration had no interest in and would not be involved in <b>any</b> <b>talk</b> of [...]|$|E
2500|$|Álvarez fought Erislandy Lara on July 12, 2014, at the MGM Grand in a non-title match. Lara's WBA light middleweight {{title was}} not on the line as the fight took place at a 155-pound catchweight, and both fighters weighed in at {{precisely}} 155 pounds. Álvarez rehydrated to 171 pounds while Lara came into the ring at 166 pounds. In a very close and competitive fight that went to a split decision, Álvarez came out on top with the two judges scoring 115–113 in favor of each fighter and the final judge scoring 117–111 in favor of Álvarez. The final scorecard was controversial as many observers considered it far too wide. According to CompuBox, Lara landed 55 jabs to nine from Álvarez, who landed the jab at a five percent connect rate. Álvarez managed to land 88 power punches while Lara landed 53 power punches. Lara's clean punching, defense, and movement were weighed against Álvarez's effective aggressiveness. Lara came out in dominant fashion, utilizing a stick-and-move style and capturing the early rounds. Álvarez was later able to hammer away to the body when he had Lara on the ropes but never adjusted to Lara's one-two combinations. Lara's lead hand played a huge role in this combination's effectiveness, but his output dropped in the middle rounds. Álvarez was able to cut Lara with a lead left uppercut in the seventh round. Although the decision remains controversial, <b>any</b> <b>talk</b> of a rematch in the future was dismissed by Oscar De La Hoya who went on to say, [...] "No one wants a rematch." ...|$|E
