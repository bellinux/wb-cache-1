25|$|Most {{regulators}} have two stages. The first stage is a fixed-pressure regulator, which releases {{gas from the}} cylinder at a constant intermediate pressure, despite the pressure in the cylinder falling as the gas in it is consumed. This {{is similar to the}} first stage of a scuba-diving regulator. The adjustable second stage of the regulator controls the pressure reduction from the intermediate pressure to the low outlet pressure. The regulator has two pressure gauges, one indicating cylinder pressure, the other indicating hose pressure. The <b>adjustment</b> <b>knob</b> of the regulator is sometimes roughly calibrated for pressure, but an accurate setting requires observation of the gauge.|$|E
2500|$|Some simpler or cheaper oxygen-fuel {{regulators}} {{have only a}} single stage regulator, or only a single gauge. A single-stage regulator will tend to allow a reduction in outlet pressure as the cylinder is emptied, requiring manual readjustment. For low-volume users, this is an acceptable simplification. Welding regulators, unlike simpler LPG heating regulators, retain their outlet (hose) pressure gauge and do not rely on the calibration of the <b>adjustment</b> <b>knob.</b> The cheaper single-stage regulators may sometimes omit the cylinder contents gauge, or replace the accurate dial gauge with a cheaper and less precise [...] "rising button" [...] gauge.|$|E
50|$|<b>Adjustment</b> <b>knobs</b> {{move the}} stage {{up and down}} with {{separate}} adjustment for coarse and fine focusing. The same controls enable the microscope to adjust to specimens of different thickness. In older designs of microscopes, the focus adjustment wheels move the microscope tube up or down relative to the stand and had a fixed stage.|$|R

2500|$|For {{designated}} marksman use, the SG 550 {{is equipped}} with a Kern 4x24 telescopic sight on a quick-detachable mount. The sight weighs [...] and includes a variety of features, such as STANAG 2324/MIL-STD-1913 compliant mounting components, a Bullet Drop Compensation (BDC) elevation <b>adjustment</b> <b>knob</b> for ranges from 100 to 600 m, a tritium-illuminated reticle that enables target acquisition in low-light conditions and a diopter eyesight correction adjustment. Included with the sight is a lens hood for mounting on the ocular that reduces image quality-impairing stray light and a gray filter for glare reduction. The basic model of this optical sight was already used on the Stgw 57.|$|E
2500|$|It may be {{desirable}} for the diver {{to have some}} control over the flow characteristics of the demand valve. The usual adjustable aspects are cracking pressure and the feedback from flow rate to internal pressure of the second stage housing. The inter-stage pressure of surface supplied demand breathing apparatus is controlled manually at the control panel, and does not automatically adjust to the ambient pressure {{in the way that}} most scuba first stages do, as this feature is controlled by feedback to the first stage from ambient pressure. This has the effect that the cracking pressure of a surface supplied demand valve will vary slightly with depth, so some manufacturers provide a manual <b>adjustment</b> <b>knob</b> {{on the side of the}} demand valve housing to adjust spring pressure on the downstream valve, which controls the cracking pressure. The knob is known to commercial divers as [...] "dial-a-breath". A similar adjustment is provided on some high-end scuba demand valves, to allow the user to manually tune the breathing effort at depth ...|$|E
2500|$|The first strobe tuner {{dates back}} to 1936 and was {{originally}} made by the Conn company; {{it was called the}} Stroboconn and was produced for approximately 40 years. However, these strobes are now mainly collector pieces. They had 12 strobe discs, driven by one motor. The gearing between discs was a very close approximation to the 12th root of two ratio. This tuner had an electrically driven temperature-compensated tuning fork; the electrical output of this fork was amplified to run the motor. The fork had sliding weights, an <b>adjustment</b> <b>knob,</b> and a dial to show the position of the weights. These weights permitted setting it to different reference frequencies (such as A4 = 435Hz), although over a relatively narrow range, perhaps a whole tone. [...] When set at A4 = 440Hz the tuning fork produced a 55Hz signal, which drove the four-pole 1650 RPM synchronous motor to which the A disc was mounted. [...] (The other discs were all gear-driven off of this one.) [...] Incoming audio was amplified to feed a long neon tube common to all 12 discs. Wind instrument repair people liked this tuner because it needed no adjustment to show different notes. [...] Anyone who had to move this tuner around was less inclined to like it because of its size and weight: two record-player-sized cases of 30-40 pounds each.|$|E
50|$|They used an S-band (10 cm wavelength) and an X-band (3 cm) set, {{each with}} {{several kinds of}} display, and later {{received}} a K-band set (1 cm) which could resolve {{the structure of a}} nearby gasholder. These sets had around 300 vacuum tubes each, and 10 to 20 <b>adjustment</b> <b>knobs</b> each, and many interconnecting cables. Nearly every day a vacuum tube would fail, and they would have to trace and troubleshoot.|$|R

50|$|To {{protect the}} {{operator}} and the equipment, and reduce power loss, an outer chassis must enclose the tuning circuit and its floating ground. The inner chassis {{can be reduced}} to a mounting platform within the outer chassis, elevated on insulators to separate the floating ground from contact with the other electrical grounds. In particular, the inner tuning circuit's metal mounting chassis, and the metal rods connected to <b>adjustment</b> <b>knobs</b> on the outer chassis must all be kept separate from the surface touched by the operator and from direct electrical contact with the transmitter's ground on its connection cable. This puts difficult constraints on the tuner's construction.|$|R
2500|$|Most {{instruments}} are suspended or {{supported by a}} [...] "U" [...] shaped yoke, or 'trunnion arm' fixed {{to the sides of}} the instrument, normally near its center of gravity. On the end of such, a clamp (known as a hook-clamp, C-clamp, or pipe clamp—pipe referring to battens) is normally fixed, made in a [...] "C" [...] configuration with a screw to lock the instrument onto the pipe or batten from which it is typically hung. Once secured, the fixture can be panned and tilted using tension <b>adjustment</b> <b>knobs</b> on the yoke and clamp. An adjustable c-wrench, ratchet (US) or spanner (UK) is often used to assist the technician in adjusting the fixture.|$|R
50|$|Mechanical {{actuators}} typically convert {{rotary motion}} of a control knob or handle into linear displacement via screws and/or gears {{to which the}} knob or handle is attached. A jackscrew or car jack is a familiar mechanical actuator. Another family of actuators {{are based on the}} segmented spindle. Rotation of the jack handle is converted mechanically into the linear motion of the jack head. Mechanical actuators are also frequently used in the field of lasers and optics to manipulate the position of linear stages, rotary stages, mirror mounts, goniometers and other positioning instruments. For accurate and repeatable positioning, index marks may be used on control knobs. Some actuators include an encoder and digital position readout. These are similar to the <b>adjustment</b> <b>knobs</b> used on micrometers except their purpose is position adjustment rather than position measurement.|$|R

50|$|Mil {{adjustment}} {{is commonly used}} as a unit for clicks in the mechanical <b>adjustment</b> <b>knobs</b> (turrets) of iron and scope sights both {{in the military and}} civilian shooting sports. New shooters are often explained the principle of subtensions in order to understand that a milliradian is an angular measurement. Subtension is the physical amount of space covered by an angle and varies with distance. Thus, the subtension corresponding to a mil (either in a mil reticle or in mil adjustments) varies with range. Knowing subtensions at different ranges can be useful for sighting in a firearm if there is no optic with a mil reticle available, but involve mathematical calculations and are therefore not used very much in practical applications. Subtensions always change with distance, but a mil (as observed through an optic) is always a mil regardless of distance. Therefore, ballistic tables and shot corrections are given in mils thereby avoiding the need for mathematical calculations.|$|R
40|$|OPE {{matching}} and CD-Uniformity {{control are}} now inevitable steps {{for most of}} high volume manufacturing (HVM) of the devices in recent date. OPE matching is a technique to match the CDs of various patterns from different scanners or steppers. CD-Uniformity control stabilizes the CD across an exposure field or across different wafers and lots for HVM. With current OPE matching operations, the exposure tool properties must be imported to the simulation software to improve its prediction accuracy. The data acquisition process from the exposure tool, however, requires {{a great deal of}} man power and tool time. Normally, OPE matching operation must be reiterated several times to obtain the results, which is another demerit of the method. nmj In this paper, we will introduce our latest software tools named OPE-Master and CDU-Master. OPE-Master provides the following advantages to the users. Firstly, it includes a function to automatically import exposure tool properties, which expedites the iteration cycle and saves user’s time without sacrificing the accuracy. Secondly, it provides an optimization algorithm – a hybrid combination of nonlinear optimization and rigorous simulation – which provides better solutions by utilizing all possible <b>adjustment</b> <b>knobs</b> which are not accessible by any third party software. Finally, it has an intuitive interface software that allows the users, even with little experiences in optical simulations, to easily perform OPE matching simulations...|$|R
50|$|Another problem {{encountered}} with mechanical devices is {{the failure}} {{of one or more}} switch contacts to make firm, low resistance electrical connections, often necessitating some wiggling or <b>adjustment</b> of the <b>knob</b> to correct patchy colors on screen or unreliable peripheral response.

5000|$|The C79 sight is {{attached}} to a mounting rail on the receiver of the weapon. On CF weapons, this {{is in the form of}} a modified Weaver rail, also known as a [...] "Diemaco rail". Two <b>adjustment</b> <b>knobs</b> are used to secure the base to the receiver. A bore-sighting device is usually used to roughly zero the sight before a first-time shooter takes it to the range. Adjustments come in 0.25-mil clicks (one mil equals 10 cm at a range of 100 m, so each click adjusts the sight by 2.5 cm at 100 m). Sighting in a C79 sight is normally done at a range of 200 m. Windage adjustments are made on the left hand side of the base, using a flat object such as a flat-head screwdriver or a coin. The windage adjustment is intended only for the initial sighting in procedure of the C79. Elevation adjustments are made via a rotary knob and are adjusted from 200 to 800 m. To bring the sight to a proper elevation zero, a small [...] "gate" [...] must be elevated which disconnects the elevation cam and one mil clicks can now be made. For precise shooting, the gate is usually left open to allow for finer adjustments than the rougher presets. Target shooters will sometimes mark pre-established open gate adjustments with whiteout pens to remind them how many clicks must be made for each range. At close ranges, when rapid aiming is required, the emergency battle sights on top of the sight can be used, although they are very crude and only intended for use inside of 75 m.|$|R
50|$|The {{outlet side}} is {{fitted with a}} {{pressure}} gauge. As gas is drawn from the outlet side, the pressure inside the regulator body falls. The diaphragm is pushed back by the spring and the valve opens, letting more gas in from the supply until equilibrium is reached between the outlet pressure and the spring. The outlet pressure therefore depends on the spring force, which can be adjusted {{by means of an}} <b>adjustment</b> handle or <b>knob.</b>|$|R

50|$|The Moog modular {{synthesizer}} offered musicians {{a revolutionary}} {{new way to}} produce sound when it was released in the 1960s. It was originally intended for use in recording studios and universities and was not intended for (or widely embraced by) musicians for use in live performance. The analog electronics of the system often made sound generation unreliable and unpredictable during live performances. For example, the VCOs were notorious for their inability to hold a fixed frequency for any {{extended period of time}} and would often change pitch and go out of tune, especially in hot or damp environments. Additionally, modular sounds could not be programmed and stored for retrieval due to the instrument's analog nature. Changing sounds on the system was a time-consuming task requiring the physical re-routing of numerous patch cords and manual <b>knob</b> <b>adjustments.</b>|$|R
40|$|Memories {{occupy a}} {{significant}} area of chip {{real estate and}} are major contributors to total system energy consumption. Furthermore, the guard-banding required for masking the effects of ever-increasing manufacturing variability in memories imposes significant power overhead. In this Technical Report, we explore the opportunity for exploiting the intrinsic tolerance of a vast class of applications to some level of error in order to relax this guard-banding and build partially-forgetful memories that may lose some data. We introduce Relaxed Cache as an exemplar of this partially-forgetful memories. Unlike classic approaches which incorporate some type of uniform static guard-banding (e. g., higher voltage and/or sophisticated error correcting codes) for the entire cache at manufacturing-time, we elevate the decision-making to application-level by allowing the software programmer to dynamically adjust the required level of guard-banding at run-time. The programmer can relax the guard-bands for majority of the cache ways using two controlling knobs: (1) number of acceptable faulty bits in a cache block (AFB), and (2) supply voltage for SRAM array (VDD). The programmer also tags non-critical regions of the application’s virtual address space to be potentially mapped to relaxed ways. The data tagging along with <b>knobs</b> <b>adjustment</b> enable the programmer to guide the system to dynamically alternate between different settings during run-time, seeking the optimal energy-performance-fidelity point in that specific phase of execution. Experimental results for sample error-tolerant benchmarks show up to 74 % energy saving w. r. t. a uniformly guard-banded cache...|$|R
