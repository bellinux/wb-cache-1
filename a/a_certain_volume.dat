5|$|The {{alkali metals}} {{all have the}} same crystal {{structure}} (body-centred cubic) and thus the only relevant factors are the number of atoms that can fit into <b>a</b> <b>certain</b> <b>volume</b> and the mass of one of the atoms, since density is defined as mass per unit volume. The first factor depends on the volume of the atom and thus the atomic radius, which increases going down the group; thus, the volume of an alkali metal atom increases going down the group. The mass of an alkali metal atom also increases going down the group. Thus, the trend for the densities of the alkali metals depends on their atomic weights and atomic radii; if figures for these two factors are known, the ratios between the densities of the alkali metals can then be calculated. The resultant trend is that the densities of the alkali metals increase down the table, with an exception at potassium. Due to having the lowest atomic weight of all the elements in their period and having the largest atomic radius for their periods, the alkali metals are the least dense metals in the periodic table. Lithium, sodium, and potassium are the only three metals in the periodic table that are less dense than water: in fact, lithium is the least dense known solid at room temperature.|$|E
25|$|Compared to {{the other}} states of matter, gases have low density and viscosity. Pressure and {{temperature}} influence the particles within <b>a</b> <b>certain</b> <b>volume.</b> This variation in particle separation and speed {{is referred to as}} compressibility. This particle separation and size influences optical properties of gases as {{can be found in the}} following list of refractive indices. Finally, gas particles spread apart or diffuse in order to homogeneously distribute themselves throughout any container.|$|E
25|$|In 1967, the Czech {{physiologist}} Jan Peňáz invented and patented {{the volume}} clamp method of measuring continuous blood pressure. The {{principle of the}} volume clamp method is to dynamically provide equal pressures, {{on either side of}} an artery wall. By clamping the artery to <b>a</b> <b>certain</b> <b>volume,</b> inside pressure—intra-arterial pressure—balances outside pressure—finger cuff pressure. Peñáz decided the finger was the optimal site to apply this volume clamp method. The use of finger cuffs excludes the device from application in patients without vasoconstriction, such as in sepsis or in patients on vasopressors.|$|E

25|$|The Israelite {{system of}} {{measuring}} area was fairly informal; the biblical text merely measures areas by describing how much land could be sown with <b>a</b> <b>certain</b> <b>volume</b> measure of seed, {{for example the}} amount of land able to be sown with 2 seahs of barley. The {{closest thing to a}} formal area unit was the yoke (Hebrew semed) (sometimes translated as acre), which referred to the amount of land that a pair of yoked oxen could plough in a single day; in Mesopotamia the standard estimate for this was 6,480 square cubits, which is roughly equal to a third of an acre.|$|E
25|$|If {{a circle}} {{boundary}} is drawn around the two-dimensional {{view of a}} fractal, the fractal will never cross the boundary, {{this is due to}} the scaling of each successive iteration of the fractal being smaller. When fractals are iterated many times, the perimeter of the fractal increases, while the area will never exceed a certain value. A fractal in three-dimensional space is similar, however, a difference between fractals in two dimensions and three dimensions, is that a three dimensional fractal will increase in surface area, but never exceed <b>a</b> <b>certain</b> <b>volume.</b> This can be utilized to maximize the efficiency of ion propulsion, when choosing electron emitter construction and material. If done correctly, the efficiency of the emission process can be maximized.|$|E
500|$|At Electric Lady, Badu {{applied a}} {{multifaceted}} approach to recording her vocals and opted against editing them in post-production. Using her voice impressionistically, her vocals {{were characterized by}} high scales, varied frequencies, wide intervals, and time-stretched harmonies. Chavarria, who engineered the vocals with Badu, remarked on her singing, [...] "Her voice has so many frequencies, from a subharmonic of her tonic to a thin raspiness, {{and she wants to}} hear all of that." [...] Badu used a Shure SM57 dynamic microphone, finding it to have enough bottom for her voice type, and cut vocal takes while situated between two speakers in the studio's control room with the monitor mix playing. She explained this setting to be more comfortable, noting the ability to hear herself sing and hold the microphone when moving around. Badu preferred to sing in one take rather than edit different takes together: [...] "When I do vocals, I am singing with <b>a</b> <b>certain</b> <b>volume</b> in my voice. I am singing the double and triple harmonies at different volumes. You don't have to adjust it; I have already done it. We mix as we go, so by the time we put the vocals to ½-inch tape, I know it. If you touch a damn thing, I will know it." ...|$|E
50|$|Next, {{definitions}} {{of the end of}} the TTM period vary. Those who look at product development as engineering say the project is finished when engineering department transfers it to manufacturing. Others define the conclusion as when they ship the first copy of the new product or when a customer buys it. High-volume industries will often define the end point in terms of reaching <b>a</b> <b>certain</b> production <b>volume,</b> such as a million units per month.|$|R

2500|$|Gamma rays {{from the}} nuclear {{processes}} preceding the true explosion may be partially {{responsible for the}} following fireball, as they may superheat nearby air and/or other material. The {{vast majority of the}} energy that goes on to form the fireball is in the soft X-ray region of the electromagnetic spectrum, with these X-rays being produced by the inelastic collisions of the high speed fission and fusion products. [...] It is these reaction products and not the gamma rays which contain most of the energy of the nuclear reactions in the form of kinetic energy. [...] This kinetic energy of the fission and fusion fragments is converted into internal and then radiation energy by approximately following the process of blackbody radiation emitting in the soft X-ray region. As a result of numerous inelastic collisions, part of the kinetic energy of the fission fragments is converted into internal and radiation energy. Some of the electrons are removed entirely from the atoms, thus causing ionization, others are raised to higher energy (or excited) states while still remaining attached to the nuclei. Within an extremely short time, perhaps a hundredth of a microsecond or so, the weapon residues consist essentially of completely and partially stripped (ionized) atoms, many of the latter being in excited states, together with the corresponding free electrons. The system then immediately emits electromagnetic (thermal) radiation, the nature of which is determined by the temperature. Since this is of the order of 107 degrees, most of the energy emitted within a microsecond or so is in the soft X-ray region. To understand this one must remember that temperature depends on the average internal energy/heat of the particles in <b>a</b> <b>certain</b> <b>volume,</b> and internal energy or heat is due to kinetic energy.|$|E
