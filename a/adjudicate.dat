The ICJ can also be called upon by other UN organs to provide advisory opinions.|$|E
5|$|Nicholas {{attended}} King John's first {{parliament in}} February 1293 at Scone. He is found witnessing a charter at Newbattle Abbey on 20 November 1293, as Archdeacon William Frere's Official, and on 20 December is mentioned by Frere as a commissary of the Official {{of the diocese}} of St Andrews appointed to <b>adjudicate</b> on 4 January 1294, a case involving Kelso Abbey. He witnessed a charter along with Archdeacon Frere and Bishop William Fraser at Inchmurdo on 13 February 1295.|$|E
5|$|Chinese {{human rights}} lawyers have {{charged that the}} 610 Office {{regularly}} interferes with legal cases involving Falun Gong practitioners, subverting the ability of judges to <b>adjudicate</b> independently. Attorney Jiang Tianyong has noted that cases where the defendants are Falun Gong practitioners are decided by the local 610 Offices, rather than through recourse to legal standards. In November 2008, two lawyers seeking to represent Falun Gong practitioners in Heilongjiang noted that the presiding judge in the case was seen meeting with 610 Office agents. Other lawyers, including Gao Zhisheng, Guo Guoting and Wang Yajun have alleged that the 610 Office interfered with their ability to meet with Falun Gong clients or defend them in court.|$|E
25|$|There {{are also}} several extrajudicial {{administrative}} courts. The Office of Administrative Trials and Hearings <b>adjudicates</b> matters for all city agencies {{unless otherwise provided}} for by executive order, rule, law or pursuant to collective bargaining agreements. The Department of Finance Adjudication Division (Parking Violations Bureau) <b>adjudicates</b> parking violations, and the Tax Appeals Tribunal <b>adjudicates</b> disputes regarding city-administered taxes other than real estate assessment claims, which are <b>adjudicated</b> by the city Tax Commission.

5|$|Either Ælfric or his {{predecessor}} Sigeric {{wrote a letter}} to Wulfsige, Bishop of Sherborne about the duties of bishops {{to make sure that the}} laity did not despoil churches. The letter also urged Wulfsige to exhort the laity to strive for justice in their dealings with others, help widows and orphans, not fight, as well as other moral precepts. Ælfric also ordered the composition of the first Life of Dunstan, a hagiography, or saint's life, of Dunstan, a predecessor as Archbishop of Canterbury. He also acted as a royal judge, once being ordered by King Æthelred to <b>adjudicate</b> a case between thegns, or local noblemen.|$|E
5|$|Like Trollope before him, Pope Hennessy took {{rooms at}} The Shannon Hotel, {{near the river}} and set about trying to {{capture the essence of}} the town which had {{inspired}} Trollope's first novel, The Macdermots of Ballycloran. He proved to be a very popular figure in the town, evidenced {{by the fact that he}} was asked to <b>adjudicate</b> at a local beauty pageant and the horse fair. Pope Hennessy gives particular mention to the Corcoran family, the proprietors of The Shannon Hotel in the 1960s and 1970s, for their help in the production of his work. They sold the hotel in 1977.|$|E
5|$|Many lakes {{had several}} land owners, however, and {{following}} disagreements over Fresh Pond, the lawyer Simon Greenleaf was charged to <b>adjudicate</b> a solution in 1841. Greenleaf {{decided that the}} right to harvest ice would be divided up in proportion with the amount of the shore line owned by the different claimants; from then onwards, the rights to harvest ice could be bought and sold and the value of land adjacent to sites such as Fresh Pond increased rapidly, with one owner who purchased land at $130 ($2,500 in 2010 terms) an acre (0.4 hectares) in the 1820s refusing an offer of $2,000 ($44,000) an acre by the 1850s.|$|E

5|$|On August 6, 1787, the {{convention}} received a tentative draft {{written by a}} Committee of Detail chaired by South Carolina's John Rutledge; Randolph had represented Virginia. The draft was acceptable to Mason {{as a basis for}} discussion, containing such points important to him as the requirement that money bills originate in the House and not be amendable in the Senate. Nevertheless, Mason felt the upper house was too powerful, as it had the powers to make treaties, appoint Supreme Court justices, and <b>adjudicate</b> territorial disputes between the states. The draft lacked provision for a council of revision, something Mason and others considered a serious lack.|$|E
5|$|A delegation, {{consisting}} of {{the representatives of the}} twelve important clans of Medina, invited Muhammad to serve as chief arbitrator for the entire community; due to his status as a neutral outsider. There was fighting in Yathrib: primarily the dispute involved its Arab and Jewish inhabitants, and was estimated to have lasted for around a hundred years before 620. The recurring slaughters and disagreements over the resulting claims, especially after the Battle of Bu'ath in which all clans were involved, made it obvious to them that the tribal concept of blood-feud and {{an eye for an eye}} were no longer workable unless there was one man with authority to <b>adjudicate</b> in disputed cases. The delegation from Medina pledged themselves and their fellow-citizens to accept Muhammad into their community and physically protect him as one of themselves.|$|E
5|$|Alexander III's {{unexpected}} {{death in}} a riding accident in 1286 precipitated a major succession crisis. Scottish leaders appealed to King Edward I of England for help in determining who was the rightful heir. Edward chose Alexander's three-year-old Norwegian granddaughter, Margaret. On her way to Scotland in 1290, however, Margaret died at sea, and Edward was again asked to <b>adjudicate</b> between 13 rival claimants to the throne. A court was set up and {{after two years of}} deliberation, it pronounced John Balliol to be king. However, Edward proceeded to treat Balliol as a vassal, and tried to exert influence over Scotland. In 1295, when Balliol renounced his allegiance to England, Edward I invaded. During the first ten years of the ensuing Wars of Scottish Independence, Scotland had no monarch, until Robert the Bruce declared himself king in 1306.|$|E
25|$|In 1969–1970, extrajudicial {{administrative}} {{courts were}} created to offload a large volume of cases from the Criminal Court: the state DMV Traffic Violations Bureau (TVB), which <b>adjudicates</b> non-parking traffic violations, and the city DOF Parking Violations Bureau, which <b>adjudicates</b> parking violations.|$|R

5|$|Bahá'u'lláh's teachings {{focus on}} the unity of God, religion, and mankind. Similar to other monotheistic religions, God is {{considered}} {{the source of all}} created things. Religion, according to Bahá'u'lláh, is renewed periodically by Manifestations of God, people who are made perfect through divine intervention and whose teachings are the sources of the major world religions throughout history. Bahá'ís view Bahá'u'lláh as the first of these teachers whose mission includes the spiritual unification of the entire planet through the eradication of racism and nationalism. Bahá'u'lláh's teachings include the need for a world tribunal to <b>adjudicate</b> disputes between nations, a uniform system of weights and measures, and an auxiliary language that could be spoken by all the people on earth. Bahá'u'lláh also taught that the cycles of revelatory renewal will continue in the future, with Manifestations of God appearing every thousand years or so.|$|E
5|$|On 9 July 1386, at the Palais de Justice in Paris the two claimants {{faced each}} other {{for the first time since}} their {{confrontation}} at Argentan several months before. Each stepped before the Parlement in turn and presented their case for the King and court, Carrouges throwing down his gauntlet in challenge and Le Gris picking it up signifying his acceptance of the duel. Le Gris also embellished his case by insisting that should he be proven innocent of the offence, he would sue Carrouges or his estate for 40,000 livres. Following the declarations a number of high-ranking noblemen stepped forward to act as seconds in the duel for both men, including Waleran of Saint-Pol for Carrouges and Philip of Artois, Count of Eu for Le Gris. After hearing the challenges and accusations, the Parlement and King debated the case and decided that a full hearing of the evidence from witnesses would be held to determine guilt. If the case could not be decided by normal means, then a judicial duel would be held to <b>adjudicate</b> the dispute, God choosing the victor.|$|E
5|$|On January 16, 1967, President Lyndon Johnson {{nominated}} Combs to the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals, {{replacing the}} deceased Shackelford Miller, Jr., and the Senate confirmed the nomination on April 5, 1967. Because {{of the rules}} of the federal judiciary, Combs had to liquidate his business and banking assets and severely restrict contact with many of his political acquaintances to avoid potential conflicts of interest with cases he might <b>adjudicate</b> on the Court of Appeals. He expressed frustration that the cases that came before the court were frequently appealed to the Supreme Court, which often gave little weight to the opinions rendered by the Court of Appeals. Consequently, he resigned from the court on June 5, 1970, and joined the Louisville law firm of Tarrant, Combs, and Bullitt (later Wyatt, Tarrant & Combs).|$|E

5|$|Polygamy is common, with 39% {{of women}} living in such unions. This is sanctioned by law, which {{automatically}} permits polygamy unless spouses specify that this is unacceptable upon marriage. Although violence against women is prohibited, domestic violence is common. Female genital mutilation is also prohibited, but the practice is widespread and deeply rooted in tradition; 45% of Chadian women undergo the procedure, with the highest rates among Arabs, Hadjarai, and Ouaddaians (90% or more). Lower percentages were reported among the Sara (38%) and the Toubou (2%). Women lack equal opportunities in education and training, {{making it difficult for}} them to compete for the relatively few formal-sector jobs. Although property and inheritance laws based on the French code do not discriminate against women, local leaders <b>adjudicate</b> most inheritance cases in favour of men, according to traditional practice.|$|E
5|$|There {{was already}} a church {{dedicated}} to St. Lawrence in Mereworth {{during the reign of}} Henry II (1154–89), when its advowson belonged to Roger de Mereworth. The original church was said to have been built by the de Clares and was appropriated by the Knights Hospitallers on its foundation. During the reign of Henry II, there was a dispute between de Mereworth and Leeds Priory concerning the patronage of the church. Gilbert, Bishop of Rochester was asked to <b>adjudicate</b> on the dispute. He found in favour of de Mereworth, but the parson of the church was to pay the sum of 40s per annum to the priory as a perpetual benefice. Shortly after the settlement of the dispute the church was granted to Tonbridge Priory, in whose possession it remained until the priory was dissolved in 1525. The church then passed into the possession of Cardinal Wolsey, but was amongst the properties forfeited to the Crown in 1529.|$|E
5|$|Jack Broughton, {{a celebrated}} boxing {{champion}} (and another {{who was also}} a swordsman), had gone some way to defining the rules of prizefighting in 1743, based on earlier work by Figg, but by Johnson's time the rules were still interpreted very loosely. The style of fighting was also very different from modern boxing; the contestants stood facing each other squarely with their feet in line and their fists raised level in front of them, rather than the present-day stance of generally having one foot slightly {{in front of the other}} and one fist leading. Brute strength was the primary factor for success and knock-downs were frequent, a consequence of the instability inherent in the positioning of the fighters' feet. Rounds were not timed but instead lasted until a man was knocked down, with fighters permitted to wrestle each other to the ground. Moving around the ring, known as shifting, was deprecated and sometimes explicitly prohibited by the rules for a fight; going to ground without being hit could lead to claims that the man still standing had won. The fighters usually each provided an umpire of their choice, and there might also be a third, independent umpire present, to <b>adjudicate</b> between them.|$|E
