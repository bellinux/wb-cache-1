5|$|Until the end {{of their}} collaboration, Turunen's singing was a {{trademark}} of Nightwish. She was known as the face and voice of Nightwish while bandleader Holopainen was the soul. Turunen was seen as a key to Nightwish's success. She is respected by other musicians of the metal genre and is an influence on their work; for instance, Simone Simons of Epica names her as her inspiration to study classical music and <b>apply</b> <b>that</b> vocal style to a metal band.|$|E
5|$|For the remake, Freddy {{was brought}} back to his darker roots {{and away from the}} comical {{character}} he had become in later Nightmare on Elm Street sequels. Fuller pointed out that this Freddy does have one-liners, but his comments come from a darker sense of humor and not intended to be as campy as previously seen. In addition, it was decided to follow Craven's original characterization of Freddy as a child molester. The decision to <b>apply</b> <b>that</b> characteristic was based in part on the idea that there would not be much of a story to tell if he simply killed children for no apparent reason. It would be easy for the teenage characters to figure out, whereas it is easier to hide the idea of children being molested and force the teen characters to seek out the truth of what happened. In an effort to keep the story fresh, Heisserer developed the concept of micro-naps. In the story, as the characters prolong their time without sleeping they begin to experience micro-naps, which is where a character will unknowingly start dreaming while they are still awake. The micro-naps allowed the filmmakers the chance to blur the lines between reality and the dreamworld by offering an explanation for how the characters could slip so easily into a dream.|$|E

[...] This is obviously beneficial for the protagonist, but also is helpful to the other group members, allowing them to assume the role of another person and <b>apply</b> <b>that</b> experience to their own life.

500|$|Following his arrest, {{the tribal}} {{court of the}} Spirit Lake Sioux Tribe charged Lara with assaulting the arresting officers, along with four other charges. Lara pleaded guilty to the tribal charge of [...] "violence to a policeman". Soon after, federal {{prosecutors}} charged Lara with assault on a federal officer and {{a federal grand jury}} indicted him. Lara moved to dismiss the charge based on double jeopardy and other constitutional grounds. The Federal District Court, with Magistrate Judge Alice R. Senechal sitting by consent, denied the motions and Lara entered a conditional guilty plea, reserving the right to appeal. Senechal noted that two other trial courts in the circuit had already ruled that double jeopardy did not <b>apply,</b> <b>that</b> the ICRA only recognized the inherent sovereignty of the tribes and did not delegate prosecutorial power to the tribe. She further noted that another circuit court had ruled the same way. Lara also argued that the Petite doctrine, if applied, would preclude his prosecution, and that since it was never applied to federal prosecutions following convictions in tribal court, it discriminated against Indians. Senechal denied this motion, noting that Lara had shown no examples of other races not being prosecuted for like offenses.|$|E
500|$|During the G20 {{summit on}} 6 September, Russian President Vladimir Putin and U.S. President Barack Obama {{discussed}} {{the idea of}} putting Syria's chemical weapons under international control. On 9 September 2013, U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry stated {{in response to a question}} from a journalist that the air strikes could be averted if Syria turned over [...] "every single bit" [...] of its chemical weapons stockpiles within a week, but Syria [...] "isn't about to do it and it can't be done." [...] State Department officials stressed that Kerry's statement and its one-week deadline were rhetorical in light of the unlikelihood of Syria turning over its chemical weapons. Hours after Kerry's statement, Russian foreign minister Sergey Lavrov announced that Russia had suggested to Syria that it relinquish its chemical weapons, and Syrian foreign minister Walid al-Moallem immediately welcomed the proposal, and U.S.–Russian negotiations led to the 14 September 2013 [...] "Framework for Elimination of Syrian Chemical Weapons," [...] which called for the elimination of Syria's chemical weapon stockpiles by mid-2014. Following the agreement, Syria acceded to the Chemical Weapons Convention and agreed to <b>apply</b> <b>that</b> convention provisionally until its formal entry into force on 14 October 2013. On 21 September, Syria ostensibly provided a list of its chemical weapons to the OPCW, before the deadline set by the framework.|$|E

[...] Joseph explained to Janus that, [...] "Through instrumental music, I'm allowed {{to come up with}} musical ideas that allow the listener to create their own impression of my song. If you add lyrics about a girl in the song, the listener doesn't have a choice of what the song is about, it's told to them. My musical writings allow me to express anything. [...] It's easier for me to tell a story of something I've encountered this way than to verbalize it. [...] And my feelings are explored more in my compositions compared to what I could ever say in a few sentences." [...] He believes that [...] "music allows a person to express their deepest thoughts, thoughts that cannot be expressed with just words." [...] He also believes that the spiritual aspect of creating is to [...] "find something deep within yourself that can only be created by you"..."Your spiritual self cannot be copied and that's why it's so significant in life and music", he says. [...] Parsons goes on to say, [...] "The influence of years of touring with Yanni is apparent in the richness of Joseph's sound, but his musical voice is his own." [...] Yanni once said, [...] "Bradley, your extreme sensitivity is your greatest gift".
