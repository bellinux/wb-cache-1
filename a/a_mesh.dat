5|$|Subdivision {{surfaces}} in computer graphics use subdivision rules to refine a surface to any given level of precision. These subdivision surfaces (such as the Catmull-Clark subdivision surface) take a polygon mesh (the kind used in 3D animated movies) and refines it to <b>a</b> <b>mesh</b> with more polygons by adding and shifting points according to different recursive formulas. Although many points get shifted in this process, each new mesh is combinatorially a subdivision {{of the old}} mesh (meaning that for every edge and vertex of the old mesh, you can identify a corresponding edge and vertex in the new one, plus several more edges and vertices).|$|E
5|$|At {{the scale}} of living cells, foam {{patterns}} are common; radiolarians, sponge spicules, silicoflagellate exoskeletons and the calcite skeleton of a sea urchin, Cidaris rugosa, all resemble mineral casts of Plateau foam boundaries. The skeleton of the Radiolarian, Aulonia hexagona, a beautiful marine form drawn by Ernst Haeckel, {{looks as if it}} is a sphere composed wholly of hexagons, but this is mathematically impossible. The Euler characteristic states that for any convex polyhedron, the number of faces plus the number of vertices (corners) equals the number of edges plus two. A result of this formula is that any closed polyhedron of hexagons has to include exactly 12 pentagons, like a soccer ball, Buckminster Fuller geodesic dome, or fullerene molecule. This can be visualised by noting that <b>a</b> <b>mesh</b> of hexagons is flat like a sheet of chicken wire, but each pentagon that is added forces the mesh to bend (there are fewer corners, so the mesh is pulled in).|$|E
5|$|In November 1942 the Military Policy Committee {{approved}} {{the construction of}} a 600-stage gaseous diffusion plant. On 14 December, M. W. Kellogg accepted an offer to construct the plant, which was codenamed K-25. A cost plus fixed fee contract was negotiated, eventually totaling $2.5million. A separate corporate entity called Kellex was created for the project, headed by Percival C. Keith, one of Kellogg's vice presidents. The process faced formidable technical difficulties. The highly corrosive gas uranium hexafluoride had to be used, as no substitute could be found, and the motors and pumps would have to be vacuum tight and enclosed in inert gas. The biggest problem was the design of the barrier, which would have to be strong, porous and resistant to corrosion by uranium hexafluoride. The best choice for this seemed to be nickel, and Edward Adler and Edward Norris created <b>a</b> <b>mesh</b> barrier from electroplated nickel. A six-stage pilot plant was built at Columbia to test the process, but the Norris-Adler prototype proved to be too brittle. A rival barrier was developed from powdered nickel by Kellex, the Bell Telephone Laboratories and the Bakelite Corporation. In January 1944, Groves ordered the Kellex barrier into production.|$|E

40|$|The {{change rate}} of the DC reactor voltage with {{predefined}} protection voltage thresholds is proposed to provide fast and accurate DC fault detection in <b>a</b> <b>meshed</b> multi-terminal HVDC system.

In addition to fast DC fault detection, the proposed scheme can also accurately discriminate the faulty branch from the healthy ones in <b>a</b> <b>meshed</b> DC network by considering the voltage polarities and amplitudes of the two DC reactors connected to the same converter DC terminal. Fast fault detection leads to lower fault current stresses on DC circuit breakers and converter equipment.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} a new method {{for increasing the}} number and the volume of hexahedral and prism elements in <b>a</b> hexdominant <b>mesh</b> by topological transformations. The method takes as input <b>a</b> hex-dominant <b>mesh</b> consisting of hexahedrons, prisms, pyramids and tetrahedrons and modifies the mesh {{to increase the number}} and the volume of hexahedrons and prisms while maintaining the relaxed conformity criteria, which allows a connection from two tetrahedrons to a quadrilateral face of a hexahedron or a prism. If <b>a</b> hex-dominant <b>mesh</b> satisfies the relaxed conformity criteria, it can be used in the finite element analysis by applying an error reduction scheme on non-conforming faces [1 - 3], inserting pyramids on non-conforming faces [4], or converting the <b>mesh</b> to <b>an</b> all-hex <b>mesh</b> by <b>a</b> template method [5, 6].
