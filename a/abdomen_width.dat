40|$|A {{total of}} 174 {{specimens}} of the African palm weevil Rhynchophorus phoenicis (F.) were sampled during 2010, in eight different localities of the Southwest region of Cameroon. Male and female weevils were measured (body length, abdomen length, <b>abdomen</b> <b>width,</b> pronotum length, pronotum width, head size, and length from tip of rostrum to antennal insertion), {{and the different}} pronotum patterns are described. Statistical analysis shows that all morphometric parameters correlate with body length in both males and females, and seven pronotum pattern types are identified, three of which are new. African palm weevil adults show sexual dimorphism: abdomen and head size are significantly greater in females, while pronotum length is significantly greater in males. No statistical differences in the frequencies of pronotum pattern types were seen between males and females, or among localities.

Six morphometric relationships were examined on 105 males and 105 females, ranging in size from 103 to 207 mm and from 104 to 222 mm in total length, respectively. In both the sexes, the relative growth of carapace length, propodus length of raptorial claw and total weight in relation to total length was found positively allometric. Telson width in both the sexes and <b>abdomen</b> <b>width</b> in males showed slightly negative allometry, while the <b>abdomen</b> <b>width</b> of females showed slightly positive allometry, indicating some variation in the growth between sexes which could be attributed to the energy requirement for maturation in females. The propodus of females was also found to be bigger than that of males. It is quite interesting as males only have larger chela in other crustaceans. It has a functional significance in that it is of immense help at the time of intense feeding during maturation of oocytes which requires higher energy...|$|E

Morphology of males did not vary with stream or along an urban gradient. The morphology of females varied with stream and along an urban gradient.

A total of 60 controls were also collected from the same place for comparison. As many as eleven anthropometric traits, viz. height, weight, BMI, percent body fat, percent lean body mass, relative body weight, circumference of the upper arm during an isometric contraction and relaxed position of biceps brachii, circumference of thorax, circumference of <b>abdomen</b> and shoulder <b>width</b> were measured on all the subjects by standard techniques in pre-season. Four anthropometric indices, viz. Quetelet’s index (QI), Oliver’s typologic index (OTI), Lorenz’s constitutional index (LCI) and muscle index (MI) were derived from those anthropometric traits. One way ANOVA was tested followed by post hoc Bonferroni test and Pearson’s correlation coefficients were applied to analyze the data. In findings, the one way ANOVA showed statistically significant differences (p<. 001) in all the variables studied, except LCI among these five sets of data.

40|$|Additional contributor: Craig Longtine (faculty mentor). The ambush bug is a heteropteran {{predatory insect}} with cryptic coloration. Unusual among insects, males remain {{coupled with a}} female for several to many hours after mating, {{resulting}} in a large investment in each mating opportunity for males. Unpaired males, unpaired females, and coupled males and females were collected on goldenrod in late summer in east central Minnesota over two seasons. Each insect was weighed, and the pronotum width, <b>abdomen</b> <b>width,</b> abdomen length, and rear leg length were measured with a digital stereoscopic microscope. Unpaired males and coupled males {{were not significantly different}} for any of the parameters. <b>Abdomen</b> <b>width</b> was significantly greater in coupled females than single females the first year, although mass, pronotum width, and abdomen length of paired and unpaired females were not different. In the second year, paired females were not larger than single females with pronotum width significantly greater in single females. Females were larger than males for all parameters. Size-assortative mating was not observed in either year. Scramble competition for mates occurs in male ambush bugs. Since darker (melanistic) males may reach a temperture necessary for flight more quickly under cool but sunny conditions, we assessed the degree of thoracic pigmentation in coupled and single males with image capture software. The coloration of paired and unpaired males did not differ with respect to size of pigmented area or hue.

Proper identification {{is the first step in}} the process of managing a termite infestation. parts of the body, are used by the termite to detect smells. The termite has chewing mouthparts as found in grasshoppers and ants. The middle region, or thorax, is divided into three sections with each section bearing a pair of legs. Sexually mature males and females (reproductives or alates) also bear two pairs of wings located on the last two segments of the thorax. The wings are long and narrow, extending at least one-half their length beyond the end of the abdomen. The wings are lost after swarming. Workers and soldiers do not have wings. The abdomen makes up the posterior portion of the termite and consists of a series of similar segments occurring immediately behind the thorax.

The morphometric analysis {{was based on}} 23 measurements and was conducted using a multivariate approach.

Specimens were sampled from November 2007 to October 2008 in the Perau Creek (Ibicuí-Mirim sub-basin; Uruguay River basin). All captured specimens were sexed, and their cephalothoracic length (CL), minor and larger propodi length (MPL, LPL, respectively), height of major chela (HMQ), and <b>abdomen</b> <b>width</b> (AW) were measured. The lengthwise growth of males and females was evaluated using the Bertalanffy model, and the morphological sexual maturity was evaluated using the REGRANS program.

40|$|Genetic {{variation}} in honeybee, Apis mellifera, populations can be considerably influenced by breeding and commercial introductions, especially {{in areas with}} abundant beekeeping. However, in southern Africa apiculture {{is based on the}} capture of wild swarms, and queen rearing is virtually absent. Moreover, the introduction of European subspecies constantly failed in the Cape region. We therefore hypothesize a low human impact on genetic {{variation in}} populations of Cape honeybees, Apis mellifera capensis. A novel solution to studying genetic variation in honeybee populations based on thelytokous worker reproduction is applied to test this hypothesis. Environmental effects on metrical morphological characters of the phenotype are separated to obtain a genetic residual component. The genetic residuals are then re-calculated as coefficients of genetic variation. Characters measured included hair length on the <b>abdomen,</b> <b>width</b> and length of wax plate, and three wing angles.

40|$|Introduction Aposematism is {{a defense}} system against predators {{consisting}} of the toxicity warning using conspicuous coloration. If the toxin production and aposematic coloration is costly, only individuals in good physical condition could simultaneously produce abundant poison and striking coloration. In such cases, the aposematic coloration not only indicates that the animal is toxic, but also the toxicity level of individuals. The {{costs associated with the}} production of aposematic coloration would ensure that individuals honestly indicate their toxicity levels. In the present study, we examine the hypothesis that a positive correlation exists between the brightness of warning coloration and toxicity level using as a model the paper wasp (Polistes dominula). Results We collected wasps from 30 different nests and photographed them to measure the brightness of warning coloration in the abdomen. We also measured the volume of the poison gland, as well as the length, and the width of the abdomen. The results show a positive relationship between brightness and poison-gland size, which remained positive even after controlling for the body size and <b>abdomen</b> <b>width.</b> Conclusion The results suggest that the coloration pattern of these wasps is a true sign of toxicity level: wasps with brighter colors are more poisonous (they have larger poison glands) ...|$|E

In addition, a discriminant function analysis was performed in order to classify the males (post hoc prediction) using the biometric data relating to the four distal segments of the endopod of the right cheliped. For the females, only two demographic categories were detected: juvenile females with flat abdomen and adult females with domed abdomen. Morphological maturity was estimated from the allometric relationships between carapace width and propodus length in males or maximum <b>abdomen</b> <b>width</b> in females. For both sexes, allometric relationships were established in the specimens {{of each of the}} demographic categories. Physiological maturity was determined by observing testes or ovary size, colour, morphology, and development. Functional maturity was presumed to be the minimum size at which each sex was morphologically and physiologically able to reproduce. In males, the size at physiological maturity was clearly earlier than the size at morphological maturity, unlike in females where such values were similar...|$|E
40|$|Relative {{growth of}} the male major chela and female abdome was studied in a {{population}} of the fiddler crab Uca leptodactyla Rathbun, 1898 from Itapoá, Santa Catarina coast, southern Brazil. Major chela length (CMQ) was measured from 191 males, and <b>abdomen</b> <b>width</b> (LAB) from 128 females. Carapace width (LC) was the reference dimension for both sexes, which ranged from 3. 9 to 11. 5 mm for males, and from 3. 15 to 10. 65 mm for females. Males grew bigger than females. Relationship between CMQ and LC showed a transition point at 8. 35 mm LC in males, and between LA and LC at 7. 10 mm LC in females. Growth was allometrically positive in the early ontogenesis and isometric after the puberal molting for both sexes. Regressions between LC and CMQ in males read as: logCMQ = - 0, 854536 + 2, 19. logLC for empirical points at left of critical point and logCMQ = 0, 063047 + 1, 24. logLC for those at right. In females, this relation was logLAB = - 0, 603590 + 1, 30. logLC and logLAB = - 0, 361464 + 1, 07. logLC, respectively. These body dimensions were connected with reproductive activity of this species...|$|E
40|$|Sizes at maturity, {{breeding}} period, and fecundity of {{the spider}} crab Leucippa pentagona in Bustamante Bay, Argentina (45. 11 °S, 66. 56 °W) were analyzed. Specimens were collected monthly between May 2006 and February 2008. The size at morphometric maturity was determined based on relative changes in cheliped length for males and <b>abdomen</b> <b>width</b> for females. The presence of spermatophores in the male deferent ducts and of eggs in the female abdomens were the criteria used to determine physiological maturity. The temporal variation of the proportion of ovigerous females was analyzed. Oocyte sizes in ovigerous females were measured to evaluate the occurrence of multiple spawnings. In males, the sizes at morphometric and physiological maturity were 28. 05 and 16. 7 mm carapace length (CL), respectively. In females, the size at morphological maturity was 18. 5 mm CL, whereas size at physiological maturity was 18. 25 CL. Ovigerous females were found between June and February in both years. Ovigerous females {{were found to have}} oocytes with advanced vitellogenesis. Fecundity was similar in both years and varied between 645 and 7114 eggs. The extended breeding period and the presence of vitellogenic oocytes in ovigerous females suggest the occurrence of two or more spawnings per reproductive season. Finally, the distribution range of this species in the Atlantic Ocean was extended from 43. 3 ° to 45. 11 °S...|$|E
40|$|Abstract A {{comparative}} study on {{size and shape}} of Leptuca uruguayensis was carried out between populations from Garças River, Brazil (BP), and Solís Grande River, Uruguay (UP). The size of the onset of sexual maturity was also estimated for UP. A total of 36 crabs BP and 387 crabs UP were analyzed. In the relative growth analysis, carapace width (CW) for both sexes, major cheliped length (LMC) for males and <b>abdomen</b> <b>width</b> (AW) for females were measured. The centroid size of carapace (1. 40 ± 0. 19 cm BP and 1. 88 ± 0. 30 cm UP) and cheliped (1. 16 ± 0. 22 cm BP and 1. 58 ± 0. 45 cm UP) differed significantly (p< 0. 001). The shape also differed significantly (p< 0. 001), having UP wider carapace than BP, rostrum projected forward and posterior margin positioned more anteriorly; the cheliped of UP was also wider than BP. In UP, males' CW ranged 4. 28 - 19. 5 mm and females' 2. 53 - 16. 3 mm CW; males' LMC ranged 1. 79 - 31. 60 mm and females' AW, 0. 80 - 8. 53 mm. The onset of sexual maturity of UP was estimated in 12. 20 mm CW for males and 7. 81 mm for females. These differences are likely related to abiotic variables acting distinctly in the two localities...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: The {{relative}} {{growth of}} the fiddler crab Uca rapax from a population of a tropical lagoon system of southeast Brazil was determined. Carapace height (CH), length (LMC) and height (HMC) of the major cheliped of males and <b>abdomen</b> <b>width</b> of females (AW) were employed as dependent variables and carapace width (CW) as independent variable. A total of 634 crabs, 357 males and 277 females, were sampled. The CW {{of males and females}} ranged from 2. 61 to 21. 94 mm (10. 30 + 2. 53 SD) and from 2. 24 to 18. 22 mm (9. 31 + 2. 23 SD), respectively. The relationship between CW and LMC showed positive allometry in juveniles (logLMC =- 0. 6634 + 1. 857 logCW) and negative one in adult males (logLMC = 0. 4570 + 0. 8465 logCW). The females showed allometric positive growth for CW x AW in juveniles (logAW =- 0. 7485 + 1. 4410 logCW) and adults (logAW =- 0. 4222 + 1. 3127 LogCW) with reduction of the allometry level in the adult phase.

40|$|The {{present study}} {{evaluated}} the relative growth and allometry of Massartella brieni Lestage and Thraulodes sp. (Leptophlebiidae: Ephemeroptera). The morphometric analysis {{was based on}} 23 measurements and was conducted using a multivariate approach. Throughout postembryonic ontogeny, all of the head measurements, {{including those of the}} mouthparts, exhibited negative allometric growth. The mesothorax and wing pad exhibited positive allometric growth. The hind legs lengths in M. brieni and the fore and hind legs lengths in Thraulodes sp. exhibited positive allometry. The abdominal length in these two species exhibited positive allometric growth. Positive allometry was also observed along the <b>abdomen</b> <b>width</b> for M. brieni, and isometry was observed for Thraulodes sp. The relative strengthening of the thorax (in preparation for the winged stage) and the relative increase in the abdomen (which {{may be related to the}} development of the reproductive structures) during growth indicate that many of the structures that exhibit positive allometric growth are related to the transition from the aquatic to the adult stage of development.
