50|$|Gold and {{platinum}} {{are used}} for minority carrier lifetime control. They are used in some infrared detection applications. Gold introduces a donor level 0.35 eV above the valence band and an <b>acceptor</b> <b>level</b> 0.54 eV below the conduction band. Platinum introduces a donor level also at 0.35 eV above the valence band, but its <b>acceptor</b> <b>level</b> is only 0.26 eV below conduction band; as the <b>acceptor</b> <b>level</b> in n-type silicon is shallower, the space charge generation rate is lower and therefore the leakage current is also lower than for gold doping. At high injection levels platinum performs better for lifetime reduction. Reverse recovery of bipolar devices is more dependent on the low-level lifetime, and its reduction is better performed by gold. Gold provides a good tradeoff between forward voltage drop and reverse recovery time for fast switching bipolar devices, where charge stored in base and collector regions must be minimized. Conversely, in many power transistors a long minority carrier lifetime is required to achieve good gain, and the gold/platinum impurities must be kept low.|$|E
50|$|LMCT {{complexes}} {{arise from}} transfer of electrons from MO with ligand-like character {{to those with}} metal-like character. This type of transfer is predominant if complexes have ligands with relatively high-energy lone pairs (example S or Se) or if the metal has low-lying empty orbitals. Many such complexes have metals in high oxidation states (even d0). These conditions imply that the <b>acceptor</b> <b>level</b> is available and low in energy.|$|E
5000|$|Dopant {{ionization}} {{within the}} oxide {{occurs in the}} same way as in other semiconductor crystals. Shallow donors near the conduction band (n-type) allow electrons to be thermally excited into the conduction band, while acceptors near the valence band (p-type) allow electrons to jump from the valence band to the <b>acceptor</b> <b>level,</b> populating the valence band with holes. It is important to note that carrier scattering in these oxides arises primarily from ionized impurity scattering at high dopant levels (>1 at%). Charged impurity ions and point defects have scattering cross-sections that are much greater than their neutral counterparts. Increasing the scattering decreases the mean-free path of the carriers in the oxide, which leads to low electron mobility and a high resistivity. These materials can be modeled reasonably well by the free electron gas theory assuming a parabolic conduction band and doping levels above the Mott Criterion. This criterion states that an insulator such as an oxide can experience a composition-induced transition to a metallic state given a minimum doping concentration nc, determined by: ...|$|E

50|$|Sodium {{incorporation}} {{is necessary}} for optimal performance. Ideal Na concentration {{is considered to be}} approximately 0.1%. Na is commonly supplied by the soda-lime glass substrate, but in processes that do not use this substrate the Na must be deliberately added. Na's beneficial effects include increases in p-type conductivity, texture, and average grain size. Furthermore, Na incorporation allows for performance to be maintained over larger stoichiometric deviations. Simulations have predicted that Na on an In site creates a shallow <b>acceptor</b> <b>level</b> and that Na serves to remove In on Cu defects (donors), but reasons for these benefits are controversial. Na is also credited with catalyzing oxygen absorption. Oxygen passivates Se vacancies that act as compensating donors and recombination centers. Alloying CIS (CuInSe2) with CGS (CuGaSe2) increases in the bandgap. To reach the ideal bandgap for a single junction solar cell, 1.5 eV, a Ga/(In+Ga) ratio of roughly 0.7 is optimal. However, at ratios above ~0.3, device performance drops off. Industry currently targets the 0.3 Ga/(In+Ga) ratio, resulting in bandgaps between 1.1 and 1.2 eV. The decreasing performance has been postulated to be a result of CGS not forming the ODC, which {{is necessary for}} a good interface with CdS.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The {{density of}} {{interface}} traps (Dit) in thermally oxidized SiC is unacceptably high for MOS device fabrication. The most severe problem is {{posed by the}} extremely high concentration of slow acceptor states near the conduction band edge of 4 H-SiC. These states are attributed to near interface traps originating from (probably intrinsic) defects in the oxide. Here a systematic theoretical search is presented for possible defects in the oxide with an appropriate <b>acceptor</b> <b>level.</b> Supercell calculations using a hybrid functional approach (and resulting in a correct gap) on defects in alpha-quartz exclude the oxygen vacancy and the oxygen interstitial, as possible candidates. In contrast, these calculations predict interstitial silicon to have an <b>acceptor</b> <b>level</b> in the appropriate range. The carbon interstitial in silica has an <b>acceptor</b> <b>level</b> somewhat deeper than that. Occupation of these levels give rise to significant rearrangement of the environment, leading to a more extended defect structure...|$|E

40|$|A {{detailed}} analysis of the radiative recombination processes in Ag(InGa) Se 2 thin films grown by a three-stage method was carried out by photoluminescence. The temperature and excitation dependence of the photoluminescence spectra was used to identify the recombination types and determine the ionization energy of the defects in the films. Significant differences were observed between the spectra of the Ag-rich and Ag-poor samples. The Ag-rich films were dominated by two emission peaks of donor acceptor pairs (DAPs). The DAP at lower energy level is attributed to recombination of donor level 13. 8 meV (Agi) with <b>acceptor</b> <b>level</b> 70. 3 meV (AgIn), while the one at high energy level is assigned to recombination of donor level 18. 5 meV (Agi) with <b>acceptor</b> <b>level</b> 108. 9 (AgSe). When Ag/III atomic ratio was near 2. 00, a phonon related-structure began to appear, which is attributed to the phonon replica of the high energy level DAP. In the case of Ag-poor AIGS samples, the dominant broad asymmetric peaks of AIGS films with different Ag/III atomic ratios were related to potential fluctuation at low temperature, and the compensation level decreased with increasing Ag/III atomic ratio. The emission line was assigned to recombination of donor level 12. 7 meV (Agi) with <b>acceptor</b> <b>level</b> 175 meV (Ag Ga 2). When the excitation power and temperature were increased, new free-bound and DAP emission lines began to appear. The free-bound was assigned to the transition from the conduction band to an <b>acceptor</b> <b>level</b> of 80 meV (AgIn).

40|$|When {{beryllium}} is thermally diffused into silicon, {{it gives}} rise to <b>acceptor</b> <b>levels</b> 191 and 145 meV above the valence band.

When lithium is thermally diffused into a beryllium-doped silicon sample, it produces two new <b>acceptor</b> <b>levels</b> at 106 and 81 meV. Quenching and annealing studies indicate that these new levels are due to lithium forming a complex with the defects responsible for the 191 - and 145 -meV beryllium levels, respectively.

The local-density-of-states (LDOS) on the (110) surface associated with the <b>acceptor</b> <b>level</b> is more sensitive to the direction of the Mn magnetic moment when the Mn atom is located further below the surface.
