5|$|Despite {{sovereign}} debt having risen substantially {{in only a}} few eurozone countries, with the three most <b>affected</b> <b>countries</b> Greece, Ireland and Portugal collectively only accounting for 6% of the eurozone's gross domestic product (GDP), it has become a perceived problem for the area as a whole, leading to speculation of further contagion of other European countries and a possible break-up of the eurozone. In total, the debt crisis forced five out of 17 eurozone countries to seek help from other nations by the end of 2012.|$|E
5|$|In {{the wake}} of the hurricane, the road {{networks}} of the <b>affected</b> <b>countries</b> remained severely disrupted for extended periods of time, hampering relief efforts in badly flooded regions. Government and emergency officials opened shelters and distributed food for the thousands that had lost their homes or sources of income. Throughout Central America and Mexico, 116people lost their lives and 16 others went missing. The disaster left swaths of private property, infrastructure, and farmland in complete ruins, leading to damage costs of more than $170million (1993USD).|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Lili was a {{relatively}} long-lived hurricane of the 1996 Atlantic hurricane season that <b>affected</b> <b>countries</b> from Central America to the United Kingdom. Lili formed on October14 from a tropical wave, which emerged from the coast of west Africa on October4. After the storm formed, further strengthening of Lili was gradual, first to tropical storm status on October16 and then to hurricane status on October17. The next day, Lili struck Cuba and moved across the central portion of the island, the first hurricane to hit the country since Hurricane Kate in 1985. After emerging into the Atlantic Ocean, the hurricane accelerated northeastward, briefly peaking as a category3 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale near the Bahamas. For almost an entire week, Hurricane Lili oscillated in intensity while fluctuating several times in forward speed. About two weeks passed before Lili transitioned into an extratropical storm north of the Azores on October27, which subsequently moved across Ireland and Great Britain.|$|E

5|$|Numerous {{tropical}} cyclones <b>affected</b> <b>countries</b> {{bordering the}} Atlantic Ocean throughout 2010. Alex caused 52 deaths {{and up to}} $1.89 billion (2010 USD) in damage as it struck northern Mexico in June. The next month, Tropical Storm Bonnie struck Florida as a weak cyclone, leaving one dead. Tropical Storm Colin led to one drowning death, and rip currents produced by Tropical Depression Five killed two people. Hurricane Danielle passed east of Bermuda while Earl moved parallel to the East Coast of the United States and into Nova Scotia throughout late August, resulting in 2 and 8 deaths, respectively. In early September, Tropical Storm Hermine caused significant flooding across Texas and killed 8 people. The strongest hurricane of the year, Igor, killed four as it traversed the Atlantic and across Newfoundland. Latin America was hard hit by Hurricane Karl and Tropical Storm Matthew, with 22 and 126 deaths, respectively. In late September, Tropical Storm Nicole produced torrential rainfall from the Caribbean into the U.S. East Coast, resulting in 16 fatalities. Hurricane Paula caused a tourist to drown offshore Cozumel in mid-October, while Hurricane Richard left two dead in Belize later that month. The season concluded with Tomas which caused 35 fatalities along its track through the Caribbean and into the Atlantic.|$|E
25|$|The {{desert locust}} is a {{difficult}} pest to control, and control measures are further compounded by the large and often remote areas (16-30 million km²) where locusts can be found. Undeveloped basic infrastructure in some <b>affected</b> <b>countries,</b> limited resources for locust monitoring and control, and political turmoil within and between <b>affected</b> <b>countries</b> further reduce the capacity of a country to undertake the necessary monitoring and control activities.|$|E

40|$|In this paper, {{a robust}} bi-level model is {{proposed}} to optimize decisions related to distribution and evacuation aid after earthquake. Usually in disastrous situation foreign <b>countries</b> help the <b>affected</b> <b>country</b> by sending relief commodities. In this problem, the foreign countries try to minimize their shipping {{costs and the}} <b>affected</b> <b>country</b> seeks to minimize its total costs which include inventory, operation, and transportation expenses. This situation is a game between different decision makers after a catastrophic disaster. To deal with this situation, a bi-level model is proposed in which the <b>affected</b> <b>country</b> is the leader and suppliers are the followers. To validate the proposed robust model, we consider Tehran probable earthquake in region 1 as a case study. Then the advantages of using bi-level modeling against considering just one player's {{point of view is}} provided. The sensitivity analysis of the experiments are presented to explore the effects of various parameters to show managerial insights that can guide DMs under a variety of conditions. ...|$|R

40|$|Currency crises tend to <b>affect</b> <b>countries</b> in {{geographic}} proximity.

Using data for five different currency crises (in 1971, 1973, 1992, 1994, and 1997) we show that currency crises <b>affect</b> <b>countries</b> tied together by international trade. By way of contrast, macroeconomic and financial influences are not {{closely associated with the}} cross-country incidence of speculative attacks. We also show that trade linkages help explain the cross-country intensity of exchange market pressure during crisis episodes, even after controlling for macroeconomic factors...|$|R
