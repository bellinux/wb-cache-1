5|$|On January 25, 2011, the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences {{announced}} that Toy Story 3 {{was not only}} nominated for Best Animated Feature, but also for Best Picture. This makes Toy Story 3 not only the first animated sequel in history to be nominated for Best Picture, but <b>also</b> <b>just</b> the third animated film to ever be so nominated (following Beauty and the Beast and Up), with Toy Story 3 becoming the second Pixar film to be nominated for both awards. Toy Story 3 also became the first ever Pixar film—and the first animated feature film since Shrek—to be nominated for the Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay, though six of Pixar's previous films were nominated for the Best Original Screenplay: Toy Story, Finding Nemo, The Incredibles, Ratatouille, WALL-E, and Up. In 2011, it {{was nominated for a}} Kids' Choice Award for Favorite Animated Movie, but lost to Despicable Me.|$|E
5|$|Linois {{had escaped}} so swiftly that his anchors and boats {{had been left}} in the bay, where he had {{abandoned}} them rather than draw attention to his movements by drawing them in. He had <b>also</b> <b>just</b> missed the transport Côte d'Or with its 326 soldiers, which arrived {{on the evening of}} 13 July and was swiftly surrounded by Centurion and Concorde. Detaching most of his squadron to Madras, Rainier waited off Pondicherry for further French movements and on 15 July spotted Belle Poule just off the coast. Linois had detached the frigate to investigate the anchorage at Madras, but she had been intercepted and followed by the frigate , whose insistent shadowing had forced Captain Alain-Adélaïde-Marie Bruilhac to return to Pondicherry. Belle Poule and Côte d'Or exchange signals during the morning, and at 11:00 the transport suddenly raised sails and departed the anchorage, Terpsichore pursuing closely. Early on 16 July, Terpsichore overtook the transport and fired several shots across her bow, forcing her captain to surrender. Bruilhac had used the distraction to sail Belle Poule to Isle de France without pursuit. Côte d'Or was returned to Pondicherry and, since there was no news of war from Europe, released on 24 July on condition that she only sail to Isle de France and no other destination. Dedaigneuse was detached to ensure that the transport followed these conditions and Rainier returned to Madras, joined by Dedaigneuse the following day once the transport's course was ensured. Rainier immediately ordered his ships to take on military supplies in preparation for military operations, although news of the declaration of war, made on 18 May, did not reach him until 13 September.|$|E
25|$|To promote its new signing, Virgin {{organised}} a UK {{tour for}} Henry Cow and Faust, who had <b>also</b> <b>just</b> signed to the label.

25|$|Daniel was suffocated {{and killed}} in his bedroom, {{and a copy of}} the Bible was left by his body. Daniel had {{internal}} injuries to the throat area, showing no bruises. Daniel's exact time of death is unknown. The reports determined Daniel was sedated with Xanax and likely unconscious when he was killed.

25|$|Exactly how, when, or why Harry Nyquist had {{his name}} {{attached}} to the sampling theorem remains obscure. The term Nyquist Sampling Theorem (capitalized thus) appeared as early as 1959 in a book from his former employer, Bell Labs, and appeared again in 1963, and not capitalized in 1965. It had been called the Shannon Sampling Theorem as early as 1954, but <b>also</b> <b>just</b> the sampling theorem by several other books in the early 1950s.|$|E
25|$|For {{the sixth}} and final season in 2001, the show {{concentrated}} more on the cops' personal lives rather than just focusing on the crimes committed. The Nine Network cancelled the show after six seasons. Executive Producer Kris Noble blamed escalating costs for the cancellation. However, Bisley and Smart had <b>also</b> <b>just</b> quit the show, and the series had already been suffering a ratings battle following the departure of Friels and McClements in 1999.|$|E

25|$|As {{a result}} of Kongo's victory, the Portuguese {{merchant}} community of Luanda revolted against the governor hoping to preserve their ties with the king. Backed by the Jesuits, who had <b>also</b> <b>just</b> recommenced their mission there, they forced João Correia de Sousa to resign and flee the country. The interim government that followed the departure was led by the bishop of Angola. They were very conciliatory to Kongo and agreed to return over a thousand of the slaves captured by Correia de Sousa, especially the lesser nobles captured at the Battle of Mbumbi.|$|E
25|$|Curvature of the back, called roaching, {{might be}} caused by patella {{problems}} with the rear legs, which in turn causes the dog to lean forward onto the forelegs. This might <b>also</b> <b>just</b> be a structural fault with little consequence to the dog. Many Bostons cannot tolerate excessive heat and also extremely cold weather, due to the shortened muzzle, so hot or cold weather combined with demanding exercise can bring harm to a Boston Terrier. A sensitive digestive system is also typical of Boston Terriers. In the absence of good quality, proper diet, flatulence {{is associated with the}} breed. Their large and prominent eyes make Boston Terriers prone to corneal ulcers.|$|E

25|$|The {{village of}} Walden has noted, in its 2005 Comprehensive Plan, the {{difficulties}} {{created by the}} oblique intersection at {{the eastern end of}} the Route208 concurrency. Traffic on northbound 208 comes to a stop sign at the intersection, where 52 comes in from the right at a slightly lower grade and a sharp angle, with the view mostly blocked by a building. It is <b>also</b> <b>just</b> opposite one of two curb cuts for a busy ]. At rush hour, the traffic light at the nearby northern end often backs cars up along 52 for some distance, making the turn into the gas station difficult, especially when vehicles on 52 make the left turn into the curb cut.|$|E

25|$|The {{magazine}} made a {{point of}} underscoring Romania's debt to Western culture, notably by publishing Marino's historical essay, Descoperirea Europei de către români ("Romanians Discovering Europe"). Probably using his contacts in the communist elite, Ivașcu managed to protect and hire at Lumea Doinaș, who was <b>also</b> <b>just</b> returning from prison. The eccentric poet-translator Mircea Ivănescu was also employed by Ivașcu as a columnist. Ivașcu asked him to fictionalize himself into an Italian correspondent, which allowed Ivănescu to study Italian politics. Similar practices were imposed on other staff members of the staff (among them Felicia Antip, Florica Șelmaru, and Cristian Popișteanu), but the magazine also hosted translations from Western intellectuals: Art Buchwald, Sebastian Haffner, Walter Lippmann, Drew Pearson, Jean Schwœbel, and Daily Workers John Gritten.|$|E

25|$|In October, {{while still}} barely formed, the {{division}} {{was assigned to}} 57th Army, which was <b>also</b> <b>just</b> {{in the process of}} forming-up in the Reserve of the Supreme High Command. In December the division and its Army moved to join Southwestern Front, taking part in the winter counter-offensive which {{led to the creation of}} the Izium salient south of Kharkov. By the end of January, 1942, the 335th was in 9th Army in Southern Front, on the southern flank of the salient. It was still holding this position in May, when the 1st Panzer Army overran most of 9th Army just west of the division's sector, on its way to forming the Izium Pocket. While the 335th was not encircled itself, it still suffered heavy casualties in the fighting.|$|E
25|$|On 12 June 2009, the Penguins won the Stanley Cup by {{defeating}} the Detroit Red Wings 2–1 in game 7 of the finals.

His 36 points were the highest playoff total of any player since Wayne Gretzky amassed 40 points in 1993. Malkin received the Conn Smythe Trophy as playoff MVP, becoming the first Russian-born and Asian-born player to do so. He is <b>also</b> <b>just</b> the second player in franchise history to win both the Art Ross and Conn Smythe trophies in the same year.
