5|$|Elizabeth Courtauld, {{wife of the}} {{industrialist}} and art collector Samuel Courtauld, {{promoted a}} popular series of subscription concerts beginning in 1929 and on Schnabel's advice engaged Sargent as chief conductor, with guest conductors as eminent as Bruno Walter, Otto Klemperer and Stravinsky. The Courtauld-Sargent concerts, as they became known, were aimed <b>at</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> had not previously attended concerts. They attracted large audiences bringing Sargent's name before another section of the public. In addition to the core repertory, Sargent introduced new works by Bliss, Honegger, Kodály, Martinů, Prokofiev, Szymanowski and Walton, among others. At first, {{the plan was to}} engage the London Symphony Orchestra for these concerts, but the orchestra, a self-governing co-operative, refused to replace key players whom Sargent considered sub-standard. As a result, in conjunction with Beecham, Sargent set about establishing a new orchestra, the London Philharmonic.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the award}} {{was created by}} The Bookseller, {{the idea of an}} award celebrating books with odd titles was {{proposed}} by Trevor Bounford of the Diagram Group in order to provide entertainment during the Frankfurt Book Fair in 1978. Originally known as the Diagram Group Prize for the Oddest Title at the Frankfurt Book Fair, any book that was at the fair could be nominated, but other books outside of the fair were also included. In 1982, Horace Bent, diarist for The Bookseller, took over administrative duties. Following two occasions in 1987 and 1991 when no prize was given {{due to a lack of}} odd titles, The Bookseller opened suggestions to the readers of the magazine. In 2000, the winner was voted for by the public instead of being decided by Bent. In 2009, online submissions sent on Twitter were accepted. This resulted in the highest number of submissions for the prize in its history, with 90 books being submitted (50 from Twitter), almost three times the number from the previous year (32). However, Bent also expressed his annoyance <b>at</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> gave submissions that broke the rules, with some of the books mentioned being published as far back as 1880. The 2014 prize allowed nominations from self-published works, the first book being Strangers Have the Best Candy by Margaret Meps Schulte, which won the prize.|$|E

25|$|Organ {{donation}} is {{fast becoming}} an important bioethical issue from a social perspective as well. While most first-world nations have a legal system of oversight for organ transplantation, {{the fact remains that}} demand far outstrips supply. Consequently, there has arisen a black market trend often referred to as transplant tourism. The issues are weighty and controversial. On the one hand are those who contend that those who can afford to buy organs are exploiting those who are desperate enough to sell their organs. Many suggest this results in a growing inequality of status between the rich and the poor. On the other hand, are those who contend that the desperate should be allowed to sell their organs and that preventing them from doing so is merely contributing to their status as impoverished. Further, those in favor of the trade hold that exploitation is morally preferable to death, and in so far as the choice lies between abstract notions of justice {{on the one hand and}} a dying person whose life could be saved on the other hand, the organ trade should be legalized. Conversely, surveys conducted among living donors postoperatively and in a period of five years following the procedure have shown extreme regret in a majority of the donors, who said that given the chance to repeat the procedure, they would not. Additionally, many study participants reported a decided worsening of economic condition following the procedure. These studies looked only <b>at</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> sold a kidney in countries where organ sales are already legal.|$|E
500|$|Researchers {{have looked}} for wider {{implications}} of the birthday-number effect on preferences, {{both inside and outside}} the lab. A body of controversial research under the umbrella ofimplicit egotism, starting with Pelham, Mirenberg, and Jones, has investigated whether people unknowingly make life decisions based on their name letters or [...] birthday numbers. Sceptics say that the claim that letters influence life decisions is an extraordinary one that requires extraordinary evidence. Based on analysis of US field data Pelham et al. concluded that people disproportionately live in towns whose names contain numbers that match the numbers in their birthday. They looked <b>at</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> were born on 2 February, 3 March, 4 April, etc. up to 8 August, and <b>at</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> lived in towns with numbers in them, such as Two Rivers, Three Oaks, Four Corners, etc. But in his critical analysis of this study Simonsohn argued that its reliability is questionable, as it found only a small number of residents with matching numbers. Simonsohn tried to replicate the finding in different ways but without success. He found no effect of just the day of birthday on the town (e.g. the 2nd of any month, not just February). He also found no effect of birthday number on street, address, or apartment number.|$|E
500|$|In {{relation}} to the charges of persecution and other inhumane acts the prosecutor cites the physical violence and destruction of property that was committed by the Mungiki members against the ODM supporters as being [...] "other inhumane acts" [...] which constitute crimes against humanity. Since these acts were targeted <b>at</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> were believed to support the Orange Democratic Movement or {{who were part of}} the Luo, Luhya and Kalenjin ethnic groups the prosecutor further claims that these crimes meet the definition of persecution as a crime against humanity.|$|E

He had been at the Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport after a meeting with Apollo founder Pat Roper and was waiting at the carousel for his luggage to arrive. Later, Salvo discussed the concept of the game with Roper, and they {{came up with the idea}} to have the carousel [...] "spewing unmentionables." ...|$|E

2500|$|Costume {{designer}} Catherine George {{explained that}} Mason was initially {{inspired by a}} Smithsonian photograph that production designer Ondrej Nekvasil had found of an older lady amongst {{a room full of}} dead birds at the Museum of Natural History, who was a real person from Swinton's childhood. In designing Mason's costume, George found images of women from their late 60s and early 70s, adding that, [...] " [...] a certain type that I remembered growing up who would wear their fur to go into town and scoff <b>at</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> were less better off, a bit of a Margaret Thatcher type, really." [...] George also designed Mason's suit to look [...] "a typical conservative politician shape and style" [...] with the purple adding a royal quality to the attire. She had [...] "collected pictures of dictators wearing elaborate uniforms and crazy hand-made medals" [...] to experiment with the designs of such a character. George later admitted to the similarities to Ayn Rand, although not intentional. George and Bong travelled to Swinton's home in Scotland with [...] "a couple of suitcases of clothes, wigs, glasses and teeth" [...] to play around with ideas.|$|E

2500|$|He {{has also}} argued that Muslims should be {{prevented}} from building mosques in which to teach Jihad unless they have widespread approval from the local community. Cain campaigned for Muslims to be banned from building an Islamic Center at a site in Tennessee, claiming that it was [...] "an infringement and an abuse of our freedom of religion" [...] and [...] "just another {{way to try to}} gradually sneak Shariah law into our laws". Defending himself against the suggestion that this would be discrimination, during an interview he said: [...] "I'm willing to take a harder look <b>at</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> might be terrorists, that's what I'm saying". [...] On July 18, 2011, Cain declared that communities in the United States had the [...] "right" [...] to ban mosques. He justified his view by arguing that Muslims are trying to promote Shariah law within the U.S, and also that his position did not amount to [...] "religious discrimination". CAIR said that his comments were unconstitutional and could give legitimacy to anti-Muslim bigotry. Southern Baptist Convention leader Richard Land also said that Cain had disregarded the constitutional rights of Muslims.|$|E
2500|$|There {{were many}} testimonies that made mention of Israeli guards outside the cave having opened fire. Israeli {{military}} officials claim that no Israeli troops fired on the Palestinian worshipers. [...] However, The New York Times interviewed over 40 different Palestinian eyewitnesses, {{many of whom}} were confined to hospital beds with gunshot wounds, and thus [...] "unable to compare notes". [...] All witnesses corroborated that three Israeli guards opened fire, likely in panic amid the confusion, as the Muslims fled the shrine, with at least one soldier firing into the crowd. During the inquiry, an Israeli army official said three worshipers died in the stampede following the attack and five Palestinians were killed in street riots within Hebron later that day. The testimony of various Israeli military officials was often contradictory. For instance, Danny Yatom asserted that two of the guards had fired six or seven shots in the confusion [...] "but only in the air," [...] while the two guards themselves, Sgt. Kobi Yosef and Sgt. Niv Drori, later testified to firing four shots [...] "chest high". The guards' testimony was also at odds with the testimony of their ranking officer in claiming they had seen another Jewish settler enter the cave bearing arms. Tikva Honig-Parnass wrote that 10 Palestinians were killed and more than 100 injured by Israeli soldiers who continued to shoot at those who were trying to flee the mosque, at those who were evacuating the wounded, and <b>at</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> were rioting at the Ahli hospital. Arafat Baya’at, for one, is reported as having been shot dead by Israeli troops outside the hospital when he picked up a stone to throw at soldiers after seeing a friend of his being carried out of an ambulance.|$|E
