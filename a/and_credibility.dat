5|$|The {{decision}} to base the creatures on real animals was made early on. To offer players variety, {{a mixture of}} benign and aggressive creatures was deemed necessary. The team decided to implement anthropomorphised bipedal animals, because their humanoid form evoked empathy, <b>and</b> <b>credibility</b> in their potential sentience. Due to technical restraints, bipedal creatures also provided greater flexibility for animation and game dynamics.|$|E
40|$|We {{review the}} history of the {{practical}} development of credibility theory. Emphasis is placed on the two main approaches to credibility theory: limited fluctuation <b>credibility</b> <b>and</b> greatest accuracy <b>credibility.</b> We explain when each approach should and should not be used. The presentation of greatest accuracy credibility theory starts with a review of (exact) Bayesian <b>credibility</b> <b>and</b> then moves to the Buhlmann-Straub model. Estimators of the structure parameters are discussed. Examples are presented to illustrate the concepts. Finally, the hierarchical <b>credibility</b> <b>and</b> crossed classification <b>credibility</b> models are presented...|$|R

The group's self-titled début album, released in May 2014, was also a success in the Netherlands and in other countries.

40|$|This study investigates how {{individuals}} process an online product review when an avatar is included {{to represent the}} peer reviewer. The researchers predicted that both perceived avatar <b>and</b> textual <b>credibility</b> would have {{a positive influence on}} perceptions of source trustworthiness and the data supported this prediction. Expectancy violations theory also predicted that discrepancies between the perceived avatar <b>and</b> textual <b>credibility</b> would produce violations. Violations were statistically captured using a residual analysis. The results of this research ultimately demonstrated that discrepancies in perceived avatar <b>and</b> textual <b>credibility</b> can {{have a significant impact on}} perceptions of source trustworthiness. These findings suggest that predicting perceived source trustworthiness in an online consumer review setting goes beyond the linear effects of avatar <b>and</b> textual <b>credibility...</b>|$|R
40|$|This paper compares {{international}} and domestic inflation expectations <b>and</b> inflation <b>credibility,</b> <b>and</b> hypothesises about a possible link or disconnect between inflation expectations <b>and</b> inflation <b>credibility</b> among South Africans.   No similar tests have previously been performed using South African data, {{and there is also}} a general lack of domestic and international literature on any such possible link or disconnect.   While research shows that inflation expectations are taken into account by all countries targeting inflation, inflation credibility is very seldom considered.   Although the hypothesis is confirmed in certain instances, it is refuted by a disconnect between the inflation expectations <b>and</b> inflation <b>credibility</b> of male <b>and</b> female respondents in South Africa, which cannot be explained by available data...|$|R

25|$|Developmental {{theories}} are sometimes presented not as shifts between qualitatively different stages, but as gradual increments on separate dimensions. Development of epistemological beliefs (beliefs about knowledge) {{have been described}} in terms of gradual changes in people's belief in: certainty and permanence of knowledge, fixedness of ability, <b>and</b> <b>credibility</b> of authorities such as teachers and experts.

40|$|Research in {{the fields}} of {{psychotherapy}} and rehabilitation has established an association between ratings of treatment <b>credibility</b> <b>and</b> patient expectations, and treatment outcomes. However, {{little is known about the}} relationship between <b>credibility</b> <b>and</b> expectation and the outcomes of speech- language pathology treatments. This study aimed to examine the associations between treatment <b>credibility</b> <b>and</b> patient expectations and the outcomes for people with Parkingson’s disease undergoing LSVT ® LOUD for hypokinetic dysarthria. The study also sought to explore the influence of participant variables on treatment <b>credibility</b> <b>and</b> patient expectations. Forty-nine participants completed a <b>credibility</b> <b>and</b> expectancy questionnaire prior to treatment. The treatment outcome measures included the mean change pre- to post-treatment on the total score of the Dysarthria Impact Profile and vocal sound pressure level during a monologue task. Correlation statistics revealed only one fair correlation between treatment <b>credibility</b> <b>and</b> the Dysarthria Impact Profile total score change. The findings support LSVT ® LOUD as an efficacious treatment for participants with hypokinetic dysarthria as substantial improvements were made to their speech, regardless of their perceptions of treatment <b>credibility,</b> expectations, <b>and</b> other participant factors...|$|R

25|$|Stecher, {{although}} an able booker, {{was afraid of}} losing his championship, refusing to wrestle many contenders as a result. This {{made it impossible for}} the Trio to retrieve it. They responded by calling the Munn-Zbyszko match illegitimate, and reinstated Munn as champion, but quickly had him drop it to Lewis. This left two champions, Ed Lewis and Joe Stecher, who were regarded as the dominant wrestlers of the period. Stecher and Lewis agreed to a unification match years later, in 1928, when Stecher gave in and lost the title to Lewis. By this time, the Zbyszko double-cross had already caused irreparable damage, detracting from the Trio's dominance over the wrestling industry. In addition, the build-up of Munn followed by such a humiliating loss had devalued his title <b>and</b> <b>credibility</b> as a major wrestling superstar permanently.|$|E

25|$|For several decades, the Haitian {{government}} had been receiving large loans from both American and French banks, {{and with the}} political chaos was growing increasingly incapable of repaying their debts. If the anti-American government of Rosalvo Bobo prevailed, there was no guarantee of debt repayment, and American businesses refused to continue investing there. Within six weeks of the occupation, U.S. government representatives seized control of Haiti's customs houses and administrative institutions, including the banks and the national treasury. Under U.S. government control, a total of 40% of Haiti's national income was designated to repay debts to American and French banks. While this helped improve the economic stability <b>and</b> <b>credibility</b> of the Haitian government, it led to allegations that the American actions froze Haiti's economic development. For the next nineteen years, U.S., government advisers ruled the country, their authority provided by the United States Marine Corps.|$|E
25|$|Sting {{began to}} {{question}} Hogan's trustworthiness <b>and</b> <b>credibility</b> in {{the weeks leading up}} to Fall Brawl. At the September pay-per-view, Luger brought a baseball bat to the ring and Sting used it to beat Hogan for his sixth and final WCW World Heavyweight Championship, turning heel for the first time in WCW. Sting's heel turn and subsequent attitude change did not resonate with the WCW fans. They still cheered Sting despite the fact he was supposed to be the villain (reminiscent of The Road Warriors' heel turn in late 1988). At Halloween Havoc, Sting retained the title against Hogan after Hogan entered the ring in street clothes and laid down for Sting to pin him. After the match, Sting sounded his disdain of the result and issued an open challenge for later tonight. Later that night, Sting lost an unsanctioned match to Goldberg, who accepted his open challenge and then attacked referee Charles Robinson. Sting was stripped of the title the next night for attacking the official.|$|E
