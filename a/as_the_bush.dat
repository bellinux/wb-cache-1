A field study in Ku-ring-gai Chase National Park found that 88% of {{seeds in the}} scat were still viable {{although}} dormant. The red-necked wallaby (Macropus rufogriseus) feeds on drupes and is a likely seed dispersal agent. Animals can convey seed {{for one or two}} kilometres from where they have fed. Rodents such <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>bush</b> rat (Rattus fuscipes) and black rat (Rattus rattus) eat the drupes but chew the seed so that only fragments leave their digestive system. Foxes have been reported to eat the fruit, and kangaroos and large birds such as currawongs are thought to as well.|$|E

25|$|Federal {{income taxes}} (distinct from payroll taxes) are paid {{overwhelmingly}} by the highest income taxpayers. For example, in 2014 the top 1% of income earners paid 45.7% of federal income taxes; the bottom 80% of earners paid 15%. Therefore, policies that reduce income tax rates, such <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>Bush</b> tax cuts, dis-proportionally benefit the rich, as they pay the lion's {{share of the}} taxes. During President Bush's terms, income inequality grew, a trend since 1980. CBO reported that the share of after-tax income received by the top 1% rose from 12.3% in 2001 to a peak of 16.7% in 2007, before ending at 14.1% in 2008. Comparing 2001 and 2008, the lowest and highest quintiles of the income distribution had {{a larger share of}} the after-tax income, while the middle three quintiles had a lower share.|$|E

He also promoted policies on the economy, health care, education, Social Security reform, and amending the Constitution to prohibit same-sex marriage. He signed into law broad tax cuts, the Patriot Act, the No Child Left Behind Act, the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act, Medicare prescription drug benefits for seniors, and funding for the AIDS relief program known as PEPFAR.

While campaigning for her husband's re-election in 2004, she cited the campaign as their last, though this would later be disputed when she campaigned for Republicans across the country in the 2006 midterm elections. She was credited with having raised $15 million for his campaign as well as the Republican Party while still succeeding in keeping a separate schedule that allowed for her to tend to the traditional duties she had as First Lady.|$|E

On Curtis's claim that al-Qaeda was a creation of neoconservative politicians, Bergen said, [...] "This is nonsense. There is substantial evidence that Al Qaeda was founded in 1988 by bin Laden and a small group of like-minded militants, and that the group would mushroom into the secretive, disciplined organisation that implemented the 9/11 attacks." [...] Bergen further claimed that Curtis's arguments serve as a defence of Bush's failure to capture bin Laden in the 2001 invasion of Afghanistan and his ignoring warnings of a terrorist attack prior to 11 September.|$|E

[...] The exposed end of the bush was then struck with a conical tool applied to the bore. [...] This action slightly flared the exposed end and left the external diameter 0.0038 inch (0.097mm) oversize.

[...] <b>As</b> <b>the</b> <b>bush</b> was being re-inserted its flared end broached the anodised material and a small amount of aluminium from the wall of the hole. [...] This broaching action scored the wall of the hole and left its diameter slightly oversize so the bush was not an interference fit anywhere except at its flared end. [...] Scoring of the wall of the hole and the absence of an interference fit left the inner lower boom vulnerable to developing fatigue cracks at Station 143.|$|E
2500|$|During the Rhodesian Bush War, {{almost the}} entire white male {{population}} between eighteen and fifty-eight was affected by various military commitments, and individuals spent up to five or {{six months of the}} year on combat duty away from their normal occupations in the civil service, commerce, industry, or agriculture. These long periods of service in the field led to an increased emigration of men of military age. In November 1963, state media cited the chief reasons for emigration as uncertainty about the future, economic decline due to embargo and war, and the heavy commitments of national service, which was described as [...] "the overriding factor causing people to leave". Of the male emigrants in 1976 about half fell into the 15 to 39 age bracket. Between 1960 and 1976 160,182 whites immigrated, while 157,724 departed. This dynamic turnover rate led to depressions in the property market, a slump in the construction industry, and a decline in retail sales. The number of white Rhodesians peaked in 1975 at 278,000 and rapidly declined <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>bush</b> war intensified. In 1976 around 14,000 whites left the country, marking the first year since Rhodesia's Unilateral Declaration of Independence in 1965 that more whites had left the country than arrived, with most leaving for South Africa. This became known as the 'chicken run', the earliest use of which was recorded the following year, [...] often by Rhodesians who remained to contemptuously describe those who had left. Other phrases such as 'taking the gap' or 'gapping it' were also used. As the outward flow increased, the phrase 'owl run' also came into use as leaving the country was deemed by many to be a wise choice. Disfavour with the biracial Zimbabwe Rhodesia administration in 1979 also contributed to a mass exodus.|$|E
2500|$|A central {{feature of}} the white {{community}} in Rhodesia right {{from the very beginning}} was its transience as white settlers were just as likely to leave Rhodesia after a few years rather than settle down; for example of the 700 British settlers who were the first white settlers, arriving in 1890, only 15 were still living in Rhodesia in 1924. As the white population of Rhodesia had a low birth rate, to maintain white population growth was largely dependent upon taking in new white immigrants with immigration accounting for 60% of the growth of the white Rhodesian population between 1955-72. However, the American historian Josiah Brownell noted that the turnover rate for white residents in Rhodesia was very high, as Rhodesia took in a total of 255,692 white immigrants between 1955-79 while the same period a total of 246,583 whites emigrated. Even during the boom years of the late 1950s, when Rhodesia took in an average of 13,666 white immigrants per year, mostly from the United Kingdom and South Africa, during the same period an average of about 7,666 whites emigrated annually. Between 1961-65, Rhodesia took in an average of 8,225 white immigrants/per year while also having an average white emigration of 12, 912/per year. Many prospective white immigrants in Rhodesia arrived seeking economic opportunities and departed with fluctuations in the security situation <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>bush</b> war intensified. A substantial number were uninterested in settling there permanently, and did not apply for Rhodesian citizenship despite a much-publicised 1967 campaign urging them to do so. Brownell asserted that patriotism in the white community was [...] "shallow" [...] due to its essentially expatriate character. Brownell also claimed that the majority of white immigrants in the late 1960s and early 1970s were unskilled laborers who competed with the country's black African workforce and did not contribute badly needed technical or professional skills to the country. He argued that this was due to a government policy aimed at making white immigration as [...] "unselective as possible" [...] and guaranteeing every white immigrant a job.|$|E
