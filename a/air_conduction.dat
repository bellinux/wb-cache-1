50|$|For example, if the Rinne test {{shows that}} <b>air</b> <b>{{conduction}}</b> (AC) {{is greater than}} bone conduction (BC) in both ears and the Weber test lateralizes to a particular ear, then there is sensorineural hearing loss in the opposite (weaker) ear. Conductive hearing loss is confirmed in the weaker ear if bone conduction is greater than <b>air</b> <b>conduction</b> and the Weber test lateralizes to that side. Combined hearing loss is likely if the Weber test lateralizes to the stronger ear and bone conduction is greater than <b>air</b> <b>conduction</b> in the weaker ear.|$|E

50|$|As {{electronic}} devices become smaller, {{the problem of}} dispersing waste heat becomes more difficult. Tiny radiators known as heat sinks are used to convey heat from the electronic components into a cooling air stream. Heat is transferred to the <b>air</b> by <b>conduction</b> and convection; a relatively small proportion of heat is transferred by radiation owing to the low temperature of semiconductor devices compared to their surroundings.|$|R

In this simplified model, the cooling jug acts as a psychrometer, and the theoretical prediction of our model is in a good agreement with psychrometric tables. Next, we study dynamics of the jug cooling. The cooling rate is limited by water vapour diffusion through <b>air,</b> heat <b>conduction</b> through <b>air,</b> and heat <b>conduction</b> through {{the body of the}} jug. The derived rate of temperature decrease is in general agreement with the result of our experiment.

However, with bone conduction (performed by placing a vibrator on the mastoid bone behind the ear), both cochleas are stimulated. IA for bone conduction ranges from 0-20 dB (See Figure 2). Therefore, conventional audiometry is ear specific, with regards to both air and bone conduction audiometry, when masking is applied.|$|E
40|$|INTRODUCTION Cholesteatoma {{of the ear}} is {{a common}} disease {{encountered}} by otologists all over the world. Congenital, primary acquired and secondary acquired are the terms described to denote the types of cholesteatoma. All the above types cause deafness but {{the correlation between the}} type and degree of hearing loss remains doubtful. AIM To evaluate the hearing loss in all types of cholesteatoma patients and analyse the association between nature of hearing loss and the type of cholesteatoma. MATERIALS AND METHODS The present study is a cross-sectional cohort study of cholesteatoma patients undergoing surgery. <b>Air,</b> bone <b>conduction</b> thresholds, PTA, <b>air</b> bone gaps and preoperative ossicular status were studied and analysed in all types of cholesteatoma. RESULTS One hundred and sixty two patients aged between 8 and 65 were included in the study. Nineteen patients had congenital cholesteatoma, 58 had primary cholesteatoma and 85 had secondary cholesteatoma. All patients had increased <b>air,</b> bone <b>conduction</b> thresholds, PTA thresholds and large air bone gaps on pure tone audiometry, whereas secondary cholesteatoma patients showed higher mean values for loss of hearing across all frequencies compared to other types. CONCLUSIONS The correlation between losses of hearing and damage caused by cholesteatoma of all types especially acquired secondary type was evident from this study showing higher degrees of loss of hearing in all frequencies and larger air bone gap...|$|R
40|$|The {{losses in}} {{electrical}} machinery are converted into heat causing {{a rise of}} temperature at the source of loss. From this point the heat is transmitted to the surrounding <b>air</b> by <b>conduction,</b> convection and radiation. In order that a flow of heat may take place {{there must be a}} temperature difference and the heat flows in the direction of diminishing temperature, so that the mighest temperature, or what has been called the hot spot, of an electrical machine is at the source of loss while the temperature is a minimum at thepoints where the heat leaves the machine.

25|$|Radiation fog {{is formed}} by the cooling of land after sunset by {{infrared}} thermal radiation in calm conditions with a clear sky. The cooling ground then cools adjacent <b>air</b> by <b>conduction,</b> causing the <b>air</b> temperature to fall below the dew point, forming fog. In perfect calm, the fog layer can be less than a meter thick, but turbulence can promote a thicker layer. Radiation fogs occur at night, and usually doesn't last long after sunrise, but it can persist all day in the winter months especially in areas bounded by high ground. Radiation fog is most common in autumn and early winter. Examples of this phenomenon include the Tule fog.|$|R
50|$|In 1855 Rinne {{described}} the combined conductive {{process of the}} tympanic membrane and the ossicles of the middle ear. He is known for the eponymous Rinne test. The Rinne test is a hearing test conducted with a tuning fork, and is used to test and compare a patients' hearing via <b>air</b> <b>conduction</b> (normal process) or by way of bone conduction (sound to the inner ear through the mastoid). He reasoned that if a person hears a sound {{for a longer period}} of time through bone conduction than through <b>air</b> <b>conduction,</b> a disease is present somewhere in the conduction apparatus.|$|E
50|$|Irritation in the {{external}} ear canal due to inflammation or eczema may be a condition for which a conventional <b>air</b> <b>conduction</b> aid is not an appropriate treatment. Direct bone conduction may be an option.|$|E
50|$|This {{fairly common}} {{condition}} is {{often associated with}} continuous or intermittent drainage from the ear canal. These patients may also have a hearing loss and need amplification. A conventional <b>air</b> <b>conduction</b> aid with a mold placed in the ear canal opening may not be appropriate due to the drainage, and may even provoke drainage. If the hearing loss is significant an <b>air</b> <b>conduction</b> aid may have difficulty overcoming the dysfunction of the eardrum and middle ear bones. Bone conduction hearing device bypassing the middle ear may be a more appropriate treatment for these patients. Good transmission of sound in the bone, with reduced attenuation and distortion may be possible.|$|E

This heated air is then ducted to the building space or to the process area where the heated air is used for space heating or process heating needs. Functioning in a similar manner as a conventional forced air furnace, solar-thermal-air systems provide heat by circulating air over an energy collecting surface, absorbing the sun’s thermal energy, and ducting air coming in contact with it. Simple and effective collectors can be made for a variety of air conditioning and process applications.|$|R

50|$|Surgical and implantable {{hearing aids}} are an {{alternative}} to conventional external hearing aids. If the ear is dry and not infected, an <b>air</b> <b>conduction</b> aid could be tried; if the ear is draining, a direct bone condition hearing aid is often the best solution. If the conductive part of the hearing loss is more than 30-35 dB, an <b>air</b> <b>conduction</b> device could have problems overcoming this gap. A bone-anchored hearing aid could, in this situation, be a good option.The active bone conduction hearing implant Bonebridge is also an option. This implant is invisible under the intact skin and therefore minimises the risk of skin irritations.|$|E
5000|$|In {{sensorineural hearing}} loss the ability to sense the tuning fork by both bone and <b>air</b> <b>conduction</b> is equally diminished, {{implying}} they will hear the tuning fork by <b>air</b> <b>conduction</b> after {{they can no longer}} hear it through bone conduction. This pattern is similar to what is found in people with normal hearing, but patients with {{sensorineural hearing loss}} will indicate that the sound has stopped much earlier. This can be revealed by the investigator (with normal hearing) placing the fork close to their own ear after the patient indicates that the sound has subsided, noting that the sound from the fork is still loud and clear to a normal ear.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Air</b> <b>{{conduction}}</b> {{should be}} greater than bone conduction and so the patient {{should be able to}} hear the tuning fork next to the pinna (outer ear) after they can no longer hear it when held against the mastoid.|$|E

To calculate the heat resistance of the air interlayer, an equivalent method is used in this paper. The heat resistance of the hollow building blocks in the energy saving wall is analyzed by electrical simulation, which is compared with experimental results. Compared to the traditional method, the calculation value of this method more accurately reflects the thermal characteristics of hollow building blocks. Results demonstrate that the heat resistance of air the interlayer increases as the thickness of the interlayer increases.
