5|$|Historians in the 20th and 21st {{century have}} {{conducted}} extensive research on Edward and his reign. Most have concluded {{this was a}} highly significant period in English medieval history, some going further and describing Edward {{as one of the}} great medieval kings, although most <b>also</b> <b>agree</b> <b>that</b> his final years were less successful than his early decades in power. Three major academic narratives of Edward have been produced during this period. Frederick Powicke's volumes, published in 1947 and 1953, forming the standard works on Edward for several decades, and were largely positive in praising the achievements of his reign, and in particular his focus on justice and the law. In 1988, Michael Prestwich produced an authoritative biography of the King, focusing on his political career, still portraying him in sympathetic terms, but highlighting some of the consequences of his failed policies. Marc Morris's biography followed in 2008, drawing out more of the detail of Edward's personality, and generally taking a harsher view of the King's weaknesses and less pleasant characteristics. Considerable academic debate has taken place around the character of Edward's kingship, his political skills, and in particular his management of his earls, and the degree to which this was collaborative or repressive in nature.|$|E

25|$|In general, the Mac Mini {{has been}} praised as a {{relatively}} affordable computer with a solid range of features. However, many <b>also</b> <b>agree</b> <b>that</b> it is relatively costly for a computer aimed at the lower segment of the market. It is possible to buy small computers at the same price with faster processors, better graphics card, more memory, and more storage. The small size has made the Mac Mini particularly popular as a home theater solution. In addition, its size and reliability has helped keep resale values high.|$|E

25|$|A 2008 {{commentary}} {{proposed that}} the chiropractic profession actively regulate itself to combat abuse, fraud, and quackery, which are more prevalent in chiropractic than in other health care professions, violating the social contract between patients and physicians. According to a 2015 Gallup poll of U.S. adults, the perception of chiropractors is generally favourable; two-thirds of American adults agree that chiropractors have their patient's best interest in mind {{and more than half}} <b>also</b> <b>agree</b> <b>that</b> most chiropractors are trustworthy. Less than 10% of US adults disagreed with the statement that chiropractors were trustworthy.|$|E
25|$|Only a year later, {{the family}} was {{overtaken}} by a greater scandal. Elizabeth's younger daughter, Anne, and her only living son, George, were executed on charges of treason, adultery, and incest. Anne's two chief biographers, Eric Ives and Retha Warnicke, both concluded that these charges were fabricated. They <b>also</b> <b>agree</b> <b>that</b> the King wanted to marry Jane Seymour. Beyond this obvious fact, {{the sequence of events}} is unclear and historians are divided about whether the key motivation for Anne's downfall was her husband's hatred of her or her political ambitions. Despite the claims of several recent novels, academic historians agree that Anne was innocent and faithful to her husband. Nonetheless, the judges obeyed the King, condemning Anne, George Boleyn and four others to death. Elizabeth's husband Thomas Boleyn and brother Thomas Howard, 3rd Duke of Norfolk provided no help to the condemned. The accused men were beheaded by the axe on 17 May 1536 and Anne was executed by a French swordsman two days later.|$|E
500|$|While {{the event}} is {{considered}} a memorable one by several critics, they <b>also</b> <b>agree</b> <b>that</b> it {{was not one of}} the Stones' best performances, and the guitars played during the concert were out of tune. In a 1971 interview with Rolling Stone magazine, Keith Richards evaluated their performance, [...] "We played pretty bad until near the end, because we hadn't played for years ... Nobody minded, because they just wanted to hear us play again." [...] The Stones' portion of concert was filmed by Granada Television and broadcast that September. It has since been released on DVD and Blu-ray. In April 2013, the band announced their intention to play two return concerts on 6 and 13 July, although the performances were not free.|$|E

500|$|Both {{accounts}} {{agree that}} the during the fighting in al-Zarqa, numerous Free Officers were rounded up and arrested by loyalist Bedouin officers. Both accounts <b>also</b> <b>agree</b> <b>that</b> as Hussein {{made his way to}} into Zarqa, he was cheered on by loyalist soldiers and he intervened {{in the middle of the}} clashes at his own risk and was emotionally embraced by his supporters, who chanted [...] "Death to Abu Nuwar and all the traitors!" [...] Abu Nuwar remained in the car, fearful for his life by Hussein's loyalist troops and he then apparently begged Hussein to protect him and allow him to return to Amman, which Hussein agreed to. By nightfall, Abu Nuwar persuaded Hussein to allow him to leave the country and on the morning of 14 March, he officially resigned and departed for Damascus, Syria with his family.|$|E
500|$|Menumorut {{is one of}} {{the opponents}} of the conquering Magyars only {{mentioned}} in the Gesta Hungarorum. In Romanian historiography, he is considered {{to be one of the}} Vlach, or Romanian, dukes whose role in the Gesta proves the existence of Romanian polities in the Carpathian Basin at the turn of the 9th and 10th centuries. For instance, historians Ioan-Aurel Pop and Tudor Sălăgean write that Romanians and Slavs (and possibly Avars) inhabited Menumorut's duchy, as well as the Khazars and Székelys whom Anonymus explicitly mentions, because another chapter of the Gesta lists the [...] "Slavs, Bulgarians, Vlachs, and the shepherds of the Romans" [...] among the peoples inhabiting the Carpathian Basin circa 900. The two historians <b>also</b> <b>agree</b> <b>that</b> Menumorut accepted the suzerainty of the Byzantine Emperor. Pop writes that the successful Byzantine campaigns in Asia Minor and South Italy show that the emperors of the Macedonian dynasty wished to restore the Roman Empire in the late 9th and early 10th century; and the Gesta also refers to a Byzantine intervention on behalf of Salan against the Magyars in the Carpathian Basin. On the other hand, Victor Spinei states that any political links between Menumorut and the Byzantine emperors was impossible in the late 9th century, and that Anonymus' remark of Menumorut's subjection to the Byzantine emperor should instead be interpreted as a reference to Menumorut's Orthodox faith. According to Sălăgean, Menumorut was [...] "probably a Christian," [...] even if the Gesta described him as a polygamist. Sălăgean also writes, the general assembly held for seven counties located between the Someș and Tisza and the Mezeş Gates in 1279 [...] "revived the former structure" [...] of Menumorut's country. Kristó notes that no stable regional groups of counties existed, because the following general assembly of the same region was held only for five counties in 1291. Instead of identifying Menumorut as a Romanian ruler, historian Kevin Alan Brook wrote that Menumorut was a Kabar ruler, from a dynasty established by his grandfather, Morut.|$|E
2500|$|Affronteur became Caroline. This is {{something}} all authors agree on. All British authors <b>also</b> <b>agree</b> <b>that</b> she was of about 158 tons burthen (bm).

MINUSTAH spokespeople called Wilme a [...] "gangster." [...] Other sources, such as the pro-Aristide Haitian Lawyers Leadership Network call Wilme a community leader and a martyr.|$|E
2500|$|Reviewers <b>also</b> <b>agree</b> <b>that</b> {{the series}} suffers {{from too much}} filler in its later episodes, with Crandol {{describing}} the show as spinning its wheels. Yegulalp reserves his harshest words for the unaired Going Too Far, calling it [...] "pure, idiotic, wretched excess." [...] He {{goes on to say}} that the episode has [...] "the feeling of trying to deliberately enrage the audience by resorting to the only tactics left: genuinely offensive subject matter." [...] Joel Cunningham at Digitally Obsessed disagrees, saying that the episode succeeds just in time, [...] "with one of the series' funnier sight gags".|$|E
2500|$|Ace Combat 5: The Unsung War {{was marked}} with strong sales, selling over 287,400 copies in Japan and {{over one million}} copies in North America, thus making this the most commercially {{successful}} Ace Combat title to date [...] [...] The game was also favorably received by critics. Although reviewers {{point out that the}} game is remarkably similar to Ace Combat 04, most <b>also</b> <b>agree</b> <b>that</b> the game's similarity to its predecessor did not detract from its overall quality. According to GameSpot, [...] "this latest installment doesn't do much to change an already-winning formula—but not much was needed to keep this series feeling fresh and exciting." ...|$|E

2500|$|Most analysts {{agree that}} the desafuero process was {{politically}} motivated by the high approval ratings shown by López Obrador. However, analysts <b>also</b> <b>agree</b> <b>that</b> Lopez challenged the court to picture himself {{as a victim of}} the nomenclature and advance politically. [...] Likewise, some newspaper editorial boards throughout the world charged that the desafuero was politically motivated (including The New York Times and the Washington Post) and that it should be stopped, and that excluding Obrador from the upcoming elections would delegitimize the eventual winner. Still, some analysts believed that López should have faced the force of the law, and thus becoming the only public official in Mexican history to be prosecuted (after a long tradition of impunity in government).|$|E
2500|$|After George Calvert died in April 1632, {{the charter}} was granted to his son, Cecilius Calvert, 2nd Baron Baltimore (1605–1675), on June 20, 1632. Officially, the new [...] "Maryland Colony" [...] was {{named in honor}} of Henrietta Maria of France, wife of Charles I of England. Alternatively, Some Catholic {{scholars}} and historians believe Maryland may have been named after Mary, the mother of Jesus, by George Calvert, 1st Lord Baltimore prior to his death in 1632. His original intent may never fully be known. The specific name given in the charter was phrased Terra Mariae, anglice, Maryland. The English name was preferred due to undesired associations of Mariae with the Spanish Jesuit Juan de Mariana, linked to the Inquisition. In addition, Henrietta was never referred to by both her first and middle name. Scholars <b>also</b> <b>agree</b> <b>that</b> under no circumstances was a territory ever named after someone's middle name. Many agree that since the original capital of Maryland was St. Mary's City on the north shore of the Potomac River– and the county surrounding it, the first erected/created in the province, was named St. Mary's County– Maryland was most likely named after Mary, the mother of Jesus Christ. The great seal of Maryland also supports this conclusion. The obverse side of the seal reads TERRÆ MARIÆ, which translates in Latin as [...] "Land of Mary" [...] instead of TERRÆ MARIA, which would acknowledge Henrietta's middle name.|$|E

You think it likely enough? Well, what happens after that? The wounded woman is brought to life by an operation, and she becomes delirious in the hospital at Mannheim. During her delirium the idea of Miss Roseberry's identity ferments in her brain, and assumes its present perverted form. In that form it still remains. As a necessary consequence, she persists in reversing the two identities. She says she is Miss Roseberry, and declares Miss Roseberry to be Mercy Merrick. There is the doctor 's explanation.
