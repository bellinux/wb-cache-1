When As Seen On TV ended Blake said [...] "I'm very sad that this is the last time we will <b>all</b> <b>work</b> <b>together</b> but I understand why Vic wanted to stop.

[...] With that in mind, the episode [...] "" [...] was written by Michael Piller, from a story idea created in conjunction with Rick Berman, to specifically introduce the character of Ensign Ro Laren. The episode was designed to show a backstory for the character, who would be at odds with series creator Gene Roddenberry's ideal that Starfleet officers should <b>all</b> <b>work</b> <b>together</b> seamlessly. One of her major character traits was that she would be a member of an oppressed people, whose homeworld had been conquered by another.

500|$|To helm the project, the {{producers}} Broadbent and Czernin approached John Madden, who {{was nominated for}} the Academy Award for Best Director for Shakespeare in Love in 1998. Madden considered the characters in The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel to be of [...] "an analogous kind of geographical suspension", which have [...] "entered a strange world removed from their former reality, cut off from their past, {{where they have to}} invent a new life for themselves". Dench and fellow cast members Maggie Smith, Penelope Wilton, Celia Imrie, Bill Nighy, Ronald Pickup, Tom Wilkinson, and director John Madden jumped at the opportunity to <b>all</b> <b>work</b> <b>together</b> {{for the first time in}} one film. Producer Broadbent considers Dench's character to be central to the story, and that Evelyn is much like Dench herself, being [...] "the most wonderfully sympathetic person". John Madden considers Maggie Smith's character Muriel to be [...] "instinctively xenophobic, never stepping out of her comfort zone in any way", which is not uncommon in England.|$|E

Ryan Mac Donald of GameSpot shared the opinion, and found the game to be [...] "like a product out of Hollywood". He {{believed that it was}} [...] "more an interactive, cinematic experience than a video game". Writing for Computer and Video Games, Paul Mallinson considered the game's atmosphere, story and film-like presentation its most outstanding features. Although he found its plot to be [...] "far-fetched", he noted that it was ultimately [...] "kept down to earth by clever scripting and gritty storytelling". GamePro staff writer Mike Weigand called the narrative [...] "engrossing and dramatic", and the dialogue [...] "well-written" [...] and [...] "spell-binding". Sanchez, GameSpy's Brian Davis and Eurogamer's Martin Taylor praised the [...] "Zapping System" [...] for adding to the story and increasing the replay value. Mac Donald {{thought that the}} idea of actions in the first scenario affecting the second was [...] "cool in concept", but underused in the game.|$|E

2500|$|Naturally, {{it is the}} {{interior}} architecture of cathedrals that provide the most magnificent setting for Orthodox liturgy. [...] Rather than being merely an aesthetic backdrop to the rituals of the clergy, cathedral architecture is planned so as to enhance the experience of worship. [...] A cathedral’s architecture, therefore, becomes {{an active participant in}} the sensory experience of the parishioners during Orthodox ritual. [...] Further, the architecture of the church is planned so as to enhance the actions of the clergy; this is related to the strong mystic aspect of the church born out of Orthodoxy’s Byzantine roots. The clergy become a central component of the aesthetic experience of the worship service. [...] The architecture of the surrounding building, evenly distributed light, swirling incense smoke, and resounding sound of the worship service <b>all</b> <b>work</b> <b>together</b> to create the aesthetic experience of the Orthodox form of worship.

[...] In The Cincinnati Enquirer, he gave the game four stars out of five and stated that, [...] "If there was ever a reason to purchase this compact new console, this is it... there's no multiplayer mode. It would have been fun to fly alongside or against another player in some of the missions."

2500|$|Adams {{initially}} {{may have}} met James Dean in December 1950 while jitterbugging for a soft drink commercial filmed at Griffith Park. Adams {{spent three years}} in the Coast Guard between the time this commercial was shot in late 1950 and the start of filming for Rebel Without a Cause in March 1955. Actor Jack Grinnage, who played Moose, recalled, [...] "Off the set, Nick, Dennis (Hopper), and the others would go out together--almost like the gang we portrayed--but Jimmy and Corey Allen... were not a part of that." [...] They became friends during filming. During breaks, Dean and Adams entertained cast and crew with impersonations of Marlon Brando and Elia Kazan (who had directed Dean in East of Eden). A 1955 Warner Brothers press release quoted Dean as saying, [...] "I shall be busy for the rest of 1955, and Nick will be doing film work for the next six months. Come 1956, however, I wouldn't be surprised to find myself with Adams doing a two-a-night nightclub routine--or acting in a comedy by William Shakespeare." [...] When production was wrapped, Dean said in another press release, [...] "I now regard Natalie (Wood), Nick, and Sal (Mineo) as co-workers; I regard them as friends... about the only friends I have in this town. And I hope we <b>all</b> <b>work</b> <b>together</b> again soon." [...] Following Dean's 1955 death in an automobile accident, Adams overdubbed some of Dean's lines for the film Giant (these are in Jett Rink's speech at the hotel) and dated co-star Natalie Wood. Adams tried to capitalize on Dean's fame through various publicity stunts, including a claim he was being stalked by a crazed female Dean fan, allowing himself to be photographed at Dean's grave in a contemplative pose, holding flowers, and surrounded by mourning, teenaged female fans along with writing articles and doing interviews about Dean for fan magazines. He also claimed to have developed Dean's affection for fast cars, later telling a reporter, [...] "I became a highway delinquent. I was arrested nine times in one year. They put me on probation, but I kept on racing... nowhere." ...|$|E
2500|$|Since 1906, {{with his}} cousin Nolinikanta Kar, Atul had been frequenting Jatindranath Mukherjee (Bagha Jatin) who was their {{neighbour}} in Kushtia Sub-division. They both entered the local Anushilan Samiti. W. Sealy in his Report will note [...] "Atul Ghosh and Nolini Kanta Kar, two dangerous and important absconders of the gun-running conspiracy." [...] (p23). At Kolkata, thanks to Jatin, they both {{came very close}} to Sri Aurobindo. Whereas Nolini practised wrestling with Kikkar Singh, Atul became an expert trainer in self-defence at the Pataldanga branch of the Anushilan Samiti: Atul Krishna Ghosh & Jatindranath Mukherjee founded PATHURIAGHATA BYAM SAMITY which was an important centre of armed revolution of Indian National Movement. Here he came across a number of revolutionaries, including Sachin Sanyal’s Benares group and Biren Datta Gupta whom he recommended to Jatindranath. Biren received from the latter, in January 1910, the mandate to assassinate Samsul Alam, Deputy Superintendent of Police, who was man-handling the under-trial prisoners of the Alipore Bomb case. In connection with Biren’s successful mission, Jatindranath with forty-six associates were placed on trial in the Howrah conspiracy case. Inside the prison, Jatindranath learnt from his emissaries abroad that Germany was preparing for war against Great Britain. After his release in 1911, Jatindranath suspended all extremist activities, left Kolkata under the responsibility of Atul, himself forging a grand federation of regional units in the districts. A relentless organiser, Atul sheltered revolutionaries from various units as much in his parents’ house at Jaduboyra, [...] as at the Kolkata residence of Meghamala and K.P. Basu, at 11 Mahendra Gossain’s Lane, where there was a free dormitory with homely meals. Even leaders of rival parties like Pratul Ganguli of Dhaka admit having enjoyed this hospitality, at great expense and risk on Atul’s side: [...] "We became great friends with Atulkrishna and had confidence in him. I have very often been to his Darjipara residence and spent nights there. He had grown intimate with several of our members, almost close friends. We considered him to be, somewhat, our own colleague and he sincerely hoped to unite our parties so that we could <b>all</b> <b>work</b> <b>together.</b> Frankly speaking, it was thanks to his wish that I met Jatin Mukherjee…". Disappointed by the duplicity of the Dhaka branch, [...] "some of its important workers, however, like Sachin Sanyal and Nagen (Girija) Datta, severed their connection with it and, introduced by Atulkrishna, worked with Rasbehari Bose in Upper India." [...] Atul’s elder brother Aghorenath, a civil surgeon, often looked after the bullet wounds received by the patriots.|$|E
