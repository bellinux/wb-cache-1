5|$|At around 7:00a.m. on 9 March 2014, the Mexican Army and Navy pinpointed Moreno González's {{whereabouts}} in Tumbiscatío, Michoacán. When {{they tried}} to apprehend him, the drug lord opened fire <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>security</b> forces before being killed in the fire exchange. Mexico's Procuraduría General de la República (PGR) officially confirmed his identity through DNA examinations and fingerprint identification. The results were consistent with law enforcement files. While investigators conducted the autopsy {{at a hospital in}} Apatzingán, more than 150 law enforcement officers from the Army, Navy, Federal Police, and the PGR cordoned the area to prevent organized crime members from attempting to steal his body. Post-mortem reports indicated that Moreno González died of two gunshot wounds on his thorax. On 12 March 2014, his corpse was transferred to Morelia under tight security for further testing. At the time of his death, the drug lord was wanted by the Mexican government for charges relating to drug trafficking, organized crime, kidnapping, murder, and theft.|$|E

25|$|The shootout {{is widely}} {{regarded}} as one of the bloodiest incidents in the ongoing Mexican Drug War, which to date has taken the lives of tens of thousands in Mexico. According to the government, the shootout was one-sided because the security forces were better trained and equipped than the gangsters. Critics, however, believed that there was a possibility that the incident was an extrajudicial mass murder. The Federal Police conducted tests at the crime scene and confirmed that the gunmen fired <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>security</b> forces and were shot from a distance. Mexico's National Human Rights Commission concluded their investigation in 2016 and stated that the Federal Police extrajudicially killed at least 22 of the 42 men.

Another reason for the government's magnanimity is that Japan is trying to strengthen its relations with African countries to win their support for its bid to gain a permanent seat on the UN Security Council.
