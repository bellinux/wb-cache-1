Later expansions to the Fund included programs such as an <b>additional</b> <b>rate</b> of interest of 1% for the first $60,000 of retirement savings, the Workfare Income Supplement which supplements retirement savings for low-income older workers, and the Pioneer Generation Package which provides additional support for the medical expenses of older workers.|$|E

5000|$|The Childcare Voucher Scheme was {{introduced}} by the UK Government in 1989. Since then many people have benefited from using the scheme. In 2009 a petition was started on the [...] "number 10" [...] website {{in order to stop}} the government from shutting down the scheme. Due to the recession the government had been considering shutting the scheme down and therefore, earning a lot more in tax, however, Gordon Brown the Prime Minister at the time, decided against it. The petition finished with 93,000 signatories on it, and although now closed, is still available for viewing (Wikipedia blocks the word petition so it cannot be included in references). In April 2011, the government did make cuts to the scheme ensuring that high earners benefited less from the scheme.

50|$|Heavy {{equipment}} and bulky supplies went by sea to the ports of Murmansk and Archangelsk in the Arctic, {{and then by}} train to the airfields in the Ukraine. Additional supplies and key personnel flew in on Air Transport Command planes from the ATC base at Mehrabad Airport, Iran. As there was no trans-Caucasian railway, additional shipping went across the Caspian to Baku. The logistical demands were enormous since almost everything had to be brought from the United States, even the high-octane aviation fuel and the steel-plank runways. Delicate negotiations finally fixed a total of 42 round-trip ATC missions to make the bases operational for the AAF, and allowed an <b>additional</b> <b>rate</b> of two weekly support missions to sustain the US contingent. The issue of flight communications eventually ended with a compromise, allowing US crews to carry out navigation and radio duties with a Soviet observer resident at all related communications centers.

Contributions are limited to £3,600 (£2,880 before 20% tax refund) or 100% of earned income (if higher). The maximum was £255,000 for the 2010/11 tax year but the 'Annual Allowance' for all pension contributions was decreased to £50,000 for tax years 2012/13 and 2013/14, and was decreased further to £40,000 starting with the 2014/15 tax year. The SIPP provider claims a tax refund at the basic rate (20% in tax year 2016-17) {{on behalf of the}} customer (i.e. you pay £2,880 and your fund contribution for the year will become £3,600). The 20% is usually added to the 'pot' some 6-11 weeks after your payment is made. Higher rate and <b>additional</b> <b>rate</b> taxpayers must claim any additional tax refund through their tax return if they have one, or by otherwise contacting HMRC (being a higher rate taxpayer, being self employed or having paid too much tax, are all triggers for being requested to complete a tax return). Employer contributions are usually allowable against corporation or income tax.|$|E

5000|$|Puzzle Pirates {{features}} a market economy. Basic resources, such as wood and iron, {{as well as}} various herbs and minerals are produced by the game on most islands. Most colonized islands and some uncolonized islands have markets, which sell the local production to the highest bidder; others are harvested by [...] "Merchants" [...] which in turn sail the goods to the highest dockside buy offer (taking cost of delivery and distance into account). On uninhabited islands, players may harvest fruit, and may sell them to either the government of other islands (if the government is buying those fruits) or privately owned businesses. Commodities are processed by player-run shops, using player-supplied labor, into refined goods such as swords, ships and rum, or into intermediate items such as cloth or enamel.Unlike most MMOGs, player-run shops and stalls determine what will be made at what price, with player employees that are hired {{to help with the}} crafting. While anyone can open a stall (full sized shops require an island governor to grant land), there is both an opening cost, as well as the need to acquire the commodities to construct the product, and the labor and time to actually construct. In addition, there is a weekly tax which is paid out of the shoppe or stall. Tax amounts depend on the size of your stall, as well as an <b>additional</b> <b>rate</b> set by the governor. This is very different from crafting in other games, where any individual player may gather the materials and craft any item, usually instantly once you have the materials, without needing to own a shop or hire help. The best way to think about this is simple: The person who opens and runs a shop is not the crafter; they are the manager of an industrial production shop. However, managers can become employees of their own shops and input to the labor needed to make the product.|$|E
50|$|Emile Garcke, and John Manger Fells (1912/1922) {{explained}} the most regular system {{of dealing with}} machine rates in those days.It {{has been suggested that}} the time rate for each machine should be {{based on the assumption that}} it is being worked continuously to its full capacity. Thereby the advantage, or the disadvantage, of the use of the particular machine relatively to manual labour or other machines, the effect of insufficiency of orders to keep the plant fully employed, will be more manifest, and the extent to which economies in production could be carried under other circumstances more clearly shown. As machinery is often not continuously employed to its maximum extent the adoption of this procedure would generally entail less than the actual lessened value of the machinery being written off to the various Stock or other orders during any given period. The further suggestion has therefore been made that the balance remaining on each plant account, being the difference between the amounts charged off on the before mentioned assumption, and the actual lessened value should be charged off by means of a supplementary rate to an Idle Capacity account, as representing a loss, or more correctly, a non-realised gain, consequent upon the non-utilisation of the plant to its full capacity. The information thus obtained would be of great value to the manufacturer in considering how he can, having regard to market and other conditions, realise from his plant the maximum economic advantage. The importance of this consideration cannot be too strongly emphasised, for whilst in the case of labour the number of employees directly engaged in production can be regulated from time to time by the volume of trade, such readjustment is not possible in the case of machines whose maintenance, standing charges, and depreciation have to be provided for, whether idle or employed. Sequentially they {{explained the}} system proposed by Whitmore and perfected by Church:Another mode of dealing with machine rates is to fix a normal rate per hour for the use of any particular machine, and charge the stock or other order accordingly, and to adjust these results from time to time by means of an <b>additional</b> <b>rate</b> which would be based on the fluctuations of trade, and the abnormal use or otherwise of the machine. If the results of the additional rates are charged off to the Stock or other orders, without being specially noted, it would seem that so good a measure of the idle capacity of the plant would not be obtained as by the procedure before described.* It is desirable that separate rates should be fixed for the Productive Hour and the Idle Hour.|$|E

40|$|Starting from {{a general}} {{equation}} for organism (or cell system) growth and attributing <b>additional</b> cell death <b>rate</b> (besides the natural rate) to therapy, we derive an equation for cell response to α radiation. Different from previous models {{that are based}} on statistical theory, the present model connects the consequence of radiation with the growth process of a biosystem and each variable or parameter has meaning regarding the cell evolving process. We apply this equation to model the dose response for α-particle radiation. It interprets the results of both high and low linear energy transfer (LET) radiations. When LET is high, the <b>additional</b> death <b>rate</b> is a constant, which implies that the localized cells are damaged immediately and the <b>additional</b> death <b>rate</b> is proportional to the number of cells present. While at low LET, the <b>additional</b> death <b>rate</b> includes a constant term and a linear term of radiation dose, implying that the damage to some cell nuclei has a time accumulating effect.
