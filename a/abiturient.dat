He became an <b>abiturient</b> from Helsingin Uusi Yhteiskoulu in 1916 and began studies as an electrical engineer at the Helsinki University of Technology the same autumn, but volunteered for service with the Helsinki Jaeger Brigade.|$|E
50|$|The {{academic}} {{level of}} the Abitur {{is comparable to the}} International Baccalaureate, the GCE Advanced Level and the Advanced Placement tests. Indeed, the study requirements for the International Baccalaureate differ little from the German exam requirements. It is the only school-leaving certificate in all states of Germany that allows the graduate (or <b>Abiturient)</b> to move directly to university. The other school leaving certificates, the Hauptschulabschluss and the Realschulabschluss, do not allow their holders to matriculate at a university. Those granted certificates of Hauptschulabschluss or Realschulabschluss can gain a specialized Fachabitur or an Abitur if they graduate from a Berufsschule and then attend Berufsoberschule or graduate from a Fachoberschule.|$|E
