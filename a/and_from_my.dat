25|$|Amélie Gex (1835–1883) {{wrote in}} her native patois as well as French. She was a passionate {{advocate}} for her language. Her literary efforts encompassed lyrical themes, work, love, tragic loss, nature, the passing of time, religion, and politics, and are {{considered by many to}} be the most significant contributions to the literature. Among her works are: Reclans de Savoué ("Echos from Savoy", 1879), Lo cent ditons de Pierre d'Emo ("One Hundred Sayings by Pierre du Bon-Sens", 1879), Poesies ("Poems", 1880), Vieilles gens et vieilles choses: Histoires de ma rue et de mon village ("Old people and old things: Stories from my street <b>and</b> <b>from</b> <b>my</b> village", 1889), Fables (1898), and Contio de la Bova ("Tales from the Cowshed").|$|E
500|$|On October 18, 2000, de la Rocha {{released}} a statement announcing his departure from the band. He said, [...] "I {{feel that it is}} now necessary to leave Rage because our decision-making process has completely failed. It is no longer meeting the aspirations of all four of us collectively as a band, <b>and</b> <b>from</b> <b>my</b> perspective, has undermined our artistic and political ideal." [...] "There was so much squabbling over everything", explained Morello, [...] "and I mean everything. We would even have fist fights over whether our T-shirts should be mauve or camouflaged! It was ridiculous. We were patently political, internally combustible. It was ugly for a long time".|$|E
500|$|Dilling's {{political}} activism was {{spurred by the}} [...] "bitter opposition" [...] she encountered upon her return to Illinois in 1931, [...] "against my {{telling the truth about}} Russia... from suburbanite 'intellectual' friends <b>and</b> <b>from</b> <b>my</b> own Episcopal minister." [...] She began public speaking as a hobby, following her doctor's advice. Iris McCord, a Chicago radio broadcaster who taught at the Moody Bible Institute, arranged for her to address local church groups. Within a year Dilling was touring the Midwest, the Northeast and occasionally the West Coast, accompanied by her husband. She showed her home movies of the Soviet Union and made the same speech several times a week to audiences sometimes as large as several hundred, hosted by organizations such as the Daughters of the American Revolution (DAR) and the American Legion.|$|E

Everyone knows {{that it is impossible to}} lead a band without a certain level of conflict. It is a fragile equilibrium in the war of ideas that very few are able to handle for fifteen years, as we proudly did [...] But, ultimately, different personal and musical misunderstandings began to compromise that equilibrium... excuses were generated for not confronting ourselves, excuses for a future group that we no longer believed in as we did in the past. To end for the sake of the band is, in its redundancy, to [...] to our mental health, and above all to show respect for all of our fans who have followed us for such a long time. Goodbye.|$|E
