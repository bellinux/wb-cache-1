40|$|We present 1 - 5 {{micrometer}} moderate- and high-resolution {{infrared spectra}} of the ONeMg nova V 1974 (Nova Cygni 1992) obtained at multiple epochs during an approximately 500 day period after outburst. During the first 80 days, the spectra exhibited continuum emission from thermal bremsstrahlung (free-free radiation) with prominent recombination line emission from hydrogen, helium, nitrogen, and oxygen. The measurement Full Width at Half Maximum (FWHM) of these recombination lines {{suggests that the}} initial velocity of the ejecta was <b>approximately</b> <b>equals</b> 2400 - 3400 km/s. We estimate from the hydrogen recombination line ratios that {{the density of the}} ionized shell at this epoch was <b>approximately</b> <b>equals</b> 10 (exp 9), with an effective electron temperature of <b>approximately</b> <b>equals</b> 5 x 10 (exp 3) K.

Cavalry types included mounted archers (Latin: sagittarii) and heavy shock cavalry (Latin: cataphracti or clibanarii).

Previously, the large size of traditional TESs, along with the heat loads associated with wiring large arrays, presented obstacles to using these cryogenic detectors for solar missions.
