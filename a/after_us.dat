5|$|Meanwhile, John Lasseter {{has said}} that the idea for Cars was born after he took a {{cross-country}} road trip with his wife and five sons in 2000. When he returned to the studio after vacation, he contacted Michael Wallis, a Route 66 historian. Wallis then led eleven Pixar animators in rented white Cadillacs on two different road trips across the route to research the film. In 2001, the movie's working title was Route 66 (<b>after</b> <b>U.S.</b> Route 66), but in 2002, the title was changed to prevent people from thinking it was related to the 1960 television show with the same name.

They returned three days later, reinforced with artillery units and attempted a surprise attack. In the subsequent crossfire, confused soldiers reported seeing Spanish reinforcements nearby and five American officers were gravely injured, which prompted a retreat order. All military actions in Puerto Rico were suspended on August 13, <b>after</b> <b>U.S.</b> President William McKinley and French Ambassador Jules Cambon, acting {{on behalf of}} the Spanish government, signed an armistice whereby Spain relinquished its sovereignty over the territories of Puerto Rico, Cuba, the Philippines and Guam.|$|E

On 30 June the United States Senate passed the act with the amendment included.
