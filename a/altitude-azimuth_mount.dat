The vertical cell is orientated towards the north. It is mainly composed of two plates; the one being heated by the solar rays reflected by the mirrors is used for evaporation of a falling water film; the other one is used for water vapor condensation. Each heliostat consists of an <b>altitude-azimuth</b> <b>mount</b> having two degrees of freedom and supporting a plane mirror. The heliostat permanently follows the sun trajectory and reflects the solar rays on the cell by means of automatic control implemented in a control card based on a microcontroller.

40|$|The use {{of visual}} sensing to acquire and track targets has the {{potential}} to significantly re-duce cost in comparison to active sensors. We present preliminary results for a system that combines a webcam with a toy foam mis-sile launcher on an <b>altitude-azimuth</b> <b>mount.</b> The controller uses foreground segmentation to identity new elements in a scene. It then applies SURF feature detection and a pinhole camera model to determine their position in the real world. Based on our analysis of the ballis-tic flight characteristics for the foam missiles, the system can thus generate the altitude and azimuth launch angles that will allow a missile to intercept the target. We interface with the missile launcher via USB, and implement a sec-ond vision system based on gradient detection to provide pose feedback for the launcher bar-rel. The system is consistently able to intercept targets, within the restricted parameters of our testing. ...|$|E

5000|$|The final {{specifications}} {{called for}} the [...] "world's largest telescope optimised for submillimetre wavelengths". It {{was to be a}} parabolic 15-metre antenna composed of 276 individually adjustable panels with a surface accuracy of better than 50 µm. It would be an <b>altitude-azimuth</b> <b>mounted</b> Cassegrain telescope with a tertiary mirror to direct the incoming radiation onto a number of different receivers. The antenna and mountings were to be protected from the elements by a co-rotating carousel with a transparent membrane stretched across the carousel aperture. Building work started in 1983 and went well apart from a small delay caused by the hijacking of the ship carrying the telescope across the Pacific by modern-day pirates. The telescope saw first light in 1987. The name for the final facility was changed to the James Clerk Maxwell Telescope.|$|R
40|$|We {{have built}} and used on several {{occasions}} an optical broadband stellar polarimeter, PlanetPol, which employs photoelastic modulators and avalanche photodiodes and achieves a photon-noise-limited sensitivity of at least 1 in 10 ⁶ in fractional polarization. Observations {{of a number of}} polarized standards taken from the literature show that the accuracy of polarization measurements is ~ 1 %. We have developed a method for accurately measuring the polarization of <b>altitude-azimuth</b> <b>mounted</b> telescopes by observing bright nearby stars at different parallactic angles, and we find that the on-axis polarization of the William Herschel Telescope is typically ~ 15 × 10 ⁻⁶, measured with an accuracy of a few parts in 10 ⁷. The nearby stars (distance less than 32 pc) are found to have very low polarizations, typically a few × 10 ⁻⁶, indicating that very little interstellar polarization is produced close to the Sun and that their intrinsic polarization is also low. Although the polarimeter can be used {{for a wide range of}} astronomy, the very high sensitivity was set by the goal of detecting the polarization signature of unresolved extrasolar planets. 17 page(s...|$|R

40|$|Description of a {{recently}} developed balloon-borne 1 -m far-infrared telescope designed {{to carry out}} astronomical observations and to map radiation from selected areas of the sky. The telescope optical system consists of a conventional Cassegrain arrangement with an f/ 2 aluminum primary mirror, spherically figured, which feeds a pyrex secondary mirror to produce an f/ 13. 8 beam at the focal plane with a scale of 15. 2 arc sec/mm. Three focal planes are provided. The infrared detectors consist of an array of four gallium-doped germanium bolometers fitted within a two-liter helium dewar. An <b>altitude-azimuth</b> <b>mount</b> design is used for attitude control, with the pointing objectives being achieved in two steps. The azimuth control system is capable of operation in a position mode, in which the sensing element is a servo-driven null magnetometer always pointed north, and in an inertial mode, in which the gyro is uncaged and becomes the azimuth reference. The elevation system also operates in both position and inertial modes. An auxiliary position control, powered by an independent battery and controlled by a separate tone command system, is provided {{in case of a}} primary system difficulty...|$|E
5000|$|Altazimuth, <b>{{altitude}}-azimuth,</b> or alt-az <b>mounts</b> allow telescopes to {{be moved}} in altitude (up and down), or azimuth (side to side), as separate motions. This mechanically simple mount was used in early telescope designs and until 2nd half of the 20th century {{was used as a}} [...] "less sophisticated" [...] alternative to equatorial mounts since it did not allow tracking of the night sky. This meant until recently it was normally used with inexpensive commercial and hobby constructions. Since the invention of digital tracking systems, altazimuth mounts have come to be used in practically all modern large research telescopes. Digital tracking has also made it a popular telescope mount used in amateur astronomy.|$|R
40|$|The {{in-flight}} calibration {{of satellite}} radiometers using ground truth measurements {{relies on the}} use of an atmospheric radiative transfer code. The accuracy of the calibration depends largely on the aerosol model used in the radiative transfer code. In order to improve the calibrations, a camera system has been developed for the determination of the aerosol size distribution, index of refraction, and scattering phase function. In addition, the camera can be used to measure ozone and water vapor content. The camera uses a two dimensional silicon CCD array to image the sun and the solar aureole. A filter wheel provides sixteen spectral bands from 380 nm to 1045 nm. The camera is mounted on an <b>altitude-azimuth</b> <b>mount</b> for tracking the sun. An external computer allows automatic or manual data acquisition. The aerosol size distribution retrieval is based on the combined inversion of solar extinction and solar aureole data. The real part of the aerosol refractive index is determined using scattering measurements in the near-backward direction, while diffuse-to-global measurements provide the imaginary part. The performance of the inversion schemes is illustrated for simulated in-flight satellite signal predictions over both high and low reflectance targets...|$|E
40|$|The Antarctic Fiber-Optic Spectrometer (AFOS) is a 30 cm Newtonian optical {{telescope}} that injects light through six 30 m long optical fibers onto a 240 − 850 nm spectrograph with a 1024 × 256 pixel CCD camera. The telescope {{is mounted on}} a dual telescope <b>altitude-azimuth</b> <b>mount</b> and {{has been designed to}} measure the transperency of the atmosphere above the South Pole for astronomy in the UV and visible wavelength regions. The instrument has observed a series of bright O and B stars during the austral winters of 2002 and 2003 to probe the UV cutoff wavelength, the auroral intensity and water vapour content in the atmosphere above the plateau. AFOS is the first completely automated {{optical telescope}} on the Antarctic Plateau. This paper reports on the results of the past two austral winters of remote observing with the telescope as well as the technical and software modifications required to improve the quality and automation of the observations. The atmospheric absorption bands in the 660 − 900 nm regions of the spectra have been fitted with MODTRAN atmospheric models and used to calculate the precipitable water vapour above the South Pole. These data are then compared to those collected concurrently by radiosonde and by a 350 µm submillimeter tipper at South Pole...|$|E
