Coleman is {{the youngest member of}} the American wrestling delegation going to the Olympics. After Coleman qualified for the Olympics, he realized that his mother, who works in customer service for the Illinois State Toll Highway Authority, could not afford to attend due to financial hardship. Coleman was living at the United States Olympic Training Center in Colorado Springs on a limited monthly stipend from the United States Olympic Committee and could not assist her. Powell rented Coleman's family <b>a</b> <b>one-bedroom</b> flat in London out of personal funds and the Oak Park High School wrestling program subsequently raised $14,000 to ensure that his mother, aunt and siblings could attend. Coleman dropped from the 66kg division to the 60kg division for the Olympics. Coleman lost {{in the first round of}} Olympic competition to Ivo Angelov of Bulgaria by a 31 score.|$|E
5|$|The {{son of a}} {{dairy farmer}} and hotel owner, Brown was born in Toowoomba, Queensland. Aged three, {{business}} failure hit the family, and they moved to Marrickville in inner Sydney. The family's poor financial position meant that they lived in <b>a</b> <b>one-bedroom</b> home, with Brown and his brother sharing a bed. Educated at Dulwich Hill and Petersham High Schools in Sydney, Brown started playing cricket as a wicket-keeper, before changing his focus to opening the batting. He left high school after two years, {{but was unable to}} find regular full-time work amid the Great Depression. In 1929–30, Brown played grade cricket for Marrickville Cricket Club, but was unable to hold down a regular place. He {{was on the verge of}} leaving Sydney when an innings of 172 for his Shire team reinvigorated his career. He progressed through the grades and reached the club's First XI, where he performed steadily to earn selection for New South Wales in 1932–33.|$|E

25|$|By the 2000s and 2010s, {{an influx}} of {{residents}} seeking affordable family housing had pushed property prices up.

Windsor Terrace is becoming more ethnically diverse and culturally active, owing to a demographic change since the 1990s, when the area had a more elderly population and not as many families with young children. The increased presence of many families with young kids has not indicated a significant cultural change in the neighborhood.|$|E

The following day, Dahmer was arrested for drugging and sexually fondling a 13-year-old boy whom he had lured to his home on the pretext of posing nude for photographs. In January 1989, Dahmer was convicted of second-degree sexual assault and of enticing a child for immoral purposes. Sentencing for the assault was suspended until May 1989.

500|$|Pathways beat sales {{expectations}} and became Bungie's first commercial success. Bungie moved from <b>a</b> <b>one-bedroom</b> apartment to {{a studio in}} Chicago's South Side on South Halsted Street; Seropian and Jones's first full-time employee, Doug Zartman, joined in May 1994 to provide support for Pathways, but became Bungie's public relations person, honing Bungie's often sophomoric {{sense of humor and}} irreverence. Bungie composer Martin O'Donnell remembered that the studio's location, a former girls' school next to a crack house, [...] "smelled like a frat house after a really long weekend" [...] and reminded staff of a locale from the Silent Hill horror video games.|$|E
500|$|Bungie {{focused on}} the Mac {{platform}} due to familiarity with the platform and ease of use. [...] "The PC market was really cutthroat, but the Mac market was all friendly and lame. So {{it was easier to}} compete," [...] Jones said. After Minotaur, Bungie began work on a 3D graphics version of the game, but realized that the game's format was not suited to a 3D environment. Instead, Jones and Seropian wrote a brand-new story for what became Pathways Into Darkness. Since Bungie had no money and Jones was the only one with the available time, he single-handedly coded the game on a Mac IIfx, passing art chores to his friend Colin Brent. Pathways was successful enough that Bungie moved from <b>a</b> <b>one-bedroom</b> apartment to an actual office.|$|E
