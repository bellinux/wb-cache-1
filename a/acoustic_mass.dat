Large increases in adsorbed mass and energy dissipation are caused by swelling of the vesicles upon interaction with AH peptide. Based on the kinetic differences of the optical and <b>acoustic</b> <b>mass</b> responses, {{it appears that the}} binding of AH peptide is necessary but not sufficient to promote the structural transformation. Instead, the AH peptides presumably rearrange on the membrane interface to promote vesicle swelling and destabilization, leading to reassembly and planar bilayer formation.

40|$|On-line leak {{detection}} is a main {{concern for the}} safe operation of pipelines. <b>Acoustic</b> and <b>mass</b> balance {{are the most important}} and extensively applied technologies in field problems. The objective of this work is to compare these {{leak detection}} methods with respect to a given reference situation, i. e., the same pipeline and monitoring signals acquired at the inlet and outlet ends. Experimental tests were conducted in a 749 m long laboratory pipeline transporting water as the working fluid. The instrumentation included pressure transducers and electromagnetic flowmeters. Leaks were simulated by opening solenoid valves placed at known positions and previously calibrated to produce known average leak flow rates. Results have clearly shown the limitations and advantages of each method. It is also quite clear that <b>acoustics</b> and <b>mass</b> balance technologies are, in fact, complementary. In general, an acoustic leak detection system sends out an alarm more rapidly and locates the leak more precisely, provided that the rupture of the pipeline occurs abruptly enough. On the other hand, a mass balance leak detection method is capable of quantifying the leak flow rate very accurately and of detecting progressive leaks.

Applications to date have been to axisymmetric geometries and have involved the use of large, but finite, wave envelope meshes compatibly matched to denser, near field meshes of conventional elements.

30|$|To {{investigate}} the {{mechanism by which}} AH peptide modulates the film properties of the intact vesicle layer, simultaneous QCM-D and reflectometry measurements to follow the AH peptide-mediated vesicle-to-bilayer transformation on gold have been reported [43]. While the acoustic wave-based QCM-D technique characterizes the structural properties of an adlayer film, the optical-based reflectometry technique provides {{a measure of the}} bound molecular mass that is related to the effective thickness and the effective refractive index of the adlayer [94]. When these two techniques are combined, several parameters can be simultaneously measured as a function of time, including: (1) adsorbed molecular mass (optical mass); (2) adsorbed molecular mass and solvent <b>mass</b> (<b>acoustic</b> mass); (3) effective film thickness; and (4) effective refractive index over the course of time [94]. As a result, the solvent mass can be calculated by separating the <b>acoustic</b> and optical <b>masses.</b> Because vesicle swelling and expansion was initially hypothesized to be the cause of the AH peptide-mediated vesicle rupturing process, the ability to follow the change in solvent mass is particularly important to test this hypothesis and further understand the biological mechanism.|$|R

30|$|While the {{assembly}} of a planar bilayer on gold and titanium oxide represents an important step towards the application of biological tools to solve problems in materials science, a more complete description of the fundamental mechanism behind the transformation process requires detailed study from multiple angles in order to evaluate its biomedical significance. Indeed, complex biological phenomena are difficult to interpret based on a single physical principle. In {{the case of the}} interaction between AH peptide and lipid vesicles, the QCM-D energy dissipation signal associated with the vesicle-to-bilayer transformation indicated an intermediate regime of high viscoelasticity. Such a change in film viscoelasticity might occur due to an increase in bound solvent resulting from vesicle swelling, for example. However, the QCM-D technique only senses <b>acoustic</b> <b>mass,</b> which is the combined mass of the adsorbed material (e.g., lipid and/or amino acid) as well as bound solvent. On the basis of this measurement alone, {{it is not possible to}} identify how the solvent mass fraction changes during the transformation. To address this challenge, it is therefore important to characterize biointerfacial processes by using several surface-sensitive techniques that measure different physical principles.|$|E

40|$|We {{have used}} {{simultaneous}} quartz crystal microbalance-dissipation (QCM-D) monitoring and four-detector optical reflectometry to monitor in situ the structural transformation of intact vesicles to a lipid bilayer on a gold surface. The structural transformation of lipid vesicles to a bilayer {{was achieved by}} introducing a particular amphiphathic, a-helical (AH) peptide. The combined experimental apparatus allows us to simultaneously follow the acoustic and optical property, changes of the vesicle rupturing process upon interaction with AH peptides. While QCM-D and reflectometry have similar sensitivities in terms of mass and thickness resolution, there are unique advantages in operating these techniques simultaneously on the same substrate. These advantages permit us to (1) follow the complex interaction between AH peptides and intact vesicles with both acoustic and optical mass measurements, (2) calculate the amount of dynamically coupled water during the interaction between AH peptides and intact vesicles, (3) demonstrate that the unexpectedly large increase of both adsorbed mass and the film's energy dissipation is mainly caused by swelling of the vesicles during the binding interaction with AH peptides, and (4) permit us to understand the structural transformation from intact vesicles to a bilayer via the AH peptide interaction by monitoring viscoelastic properties, <b>acoustic</b> <b>mass,</b> optical mass, and thickness changes of both the binding and destabilization processes.

40|$|With the {{development}} of the industry and the society, noise pollution becomes increasingly severe, especially in large cities. Generally, there are three major noise sources, namely industrial noise, traffic noise and community noise. In response, several measurements have been developed to achieve effective noise control. Examples of noise control methods are reduction of noise at source and abatement of noise during the transmission. Since noise sources are more difficult to control, and sometimes already fixed, noise control during sound transmission is more broadly applied. Traditional passive noise control techniques include Helmholtz resonators and noise absorption materials like felt, glass mineral. The sound absorption materials (SAM) are found to be efficient in attenuating noise in high frequency domain, but their performance at low frequencies is quite poor. On the other hand, the Helmholtz resonator works perfect at any target frequency but suffers from its narrow absorption bandwidth, so that it’s only effective within a limited frequency band. As an innovative solution to passive noise control problem, micro-perforated panel absorber (MPPA) has attracted great interest in recent years. It {{turns out to be a}} competitive alternative to sound absorption materials and Helmholtz resonator. The parallel and series arrangement of MPPAs backed with cavities of different depths allows them to obtain decent noise absorption performance over a relatively broad frequency range. However, the performance of MPPA is restricted by its volume, as large volume is demanded for decent low-frequency absorption, which is also the case for noise absorption materials. In this thesis, a potential way to improve the low-frequency performance of the MPPA without occupying extra volume is proposed and implemented to tests. The focus is the adjustment of speed of sound and it is beneficial in different applications such as the following. In low frequency noise control, the size of the absorber in at least one dimension is often related to the wavelength and it is often too long. With a reduced speed of sound one can reduce this size while keeping the overall volume constant. Along this line of thinking, the effect of cavity configuration on its acoustic properties is investigated by two steps. Firstly, the property of a waveguide consisting of several identical elements is studied. The number of element is chosen to magnify the effect of the configuration. It turns out the irregularity of the duct shape can slow down the speed of sound of the plane wave by increasing the <b>acoustic</b> <b>mass.</b> Secondly, the absorption performance of an MPPA backed with an irregular cavity is evaluated. The shape of the cavity is the same as the element in the first step. In advance, the parallel arrangement of two MPPAs backed with irregular cavities is investigated, in order to look into the effect of cavity shape on inter-resonator interaction. The final results indicate that cavity design is an effective method to enhance the noise absorption performance of the MPPA arrays in the low-frequency domain. published_or_final_versionMechanical EngineeringMasterMaster of Philosoph...|$|E
