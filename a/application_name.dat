5000|$|... 1983. First {{opportunity}} to fix addressing missed. The need for <b>application</b> <b>names</b> and distributed directories that mapped <b>application</b> <b>names</b> to internetwork addresses was well understood since mid-1970s. They {{were not there}} at the beginning {{since it was a}} major effort and there were very few applications, but they were expected to be introduced once the “host file” was automated (the host file was centrally maintained and mapped human-readable synonyms of addresses to its numeric value). However, <b>application</b> <b>names</b> were not introduced and DNS, the Domain Name System, was designed and deployed, continuing to use well-known ports to identify applications. The advent of the web and HTTP caused the need for <b>application</b> <b>names,</b> introducing URLs. However the URL format ties each application instance to a physical interface of a computer and a specific transport connection (since the URL contains the DNS name of an IP interface and TCP port number), making multi-homing and mobility very hard to achieve.|$|R

50|$|X {{resources}} {{are designed to}} allow the same parameter to be specified {{for more than one}} program or component. This is realized by allowing wildcard characters in a resource specification. In particular, the ? character is used to match the <b>application</b> <b>name</b> or a single component. The * character is used to match any number of components. These two characters can be used anywhere {{but at the end of}} the resource name. In other words, an attribute cannot be replaced by a wildcard character.|$|E
50|$|The {{instrument}} was soon called the laser Doppler velocimeter (LDV) and the technique laser Doppler velocimetry, also abbreviated LDV. Another <b>application</b> <b>name</b> is laser Doppler anemometry (LDA). Early LDV applications ranged from measuring and mapping the exhaust from rocket engines with {{speeds up to}} 1000 m/s to determining flow in a near-surface blood artery. A variety of similar instruments were developed for solid-surface monitoring, with applications ranging from measuring product speeds in production lines of paper and steel mills, to measuring vibration frequency and amplitude of surfaces.|$|E

50|$|With this naming structure, {{support for}} {{mobility}} and multi-homing is inherent, if the properties for {{the names are}} chosen with care: <b>application</b> <b>names</b> are location-independent to allow an application to move around, node addresses are location-dependent but route-independent. PoA addresses are by nature route-dependent. Applying this naming scheme to RINA, with recursive layers, an interesting observation can be made: mapping <b>application</b> <b>names</b> to node addresses is the same mapping than mapping node addresses to PoAs. In other words, for any layer N, nodes at the layer N+1 are applications and nodes at the layer N-1 are points of attachment, making this relationship relative.|$|R
5000|$|Default title-bar text often {{incorporates}} {{the name of}} the application and/or of its developer. The name of the host running the application also appears frequently. Various methods (menu-selections, escape sequences, setup parameters, command-line options - depending on the computing environment) may exist to give the end-user some control of title-bar text. Document-oriented applications like a text editor may display the filename or path of the document being edited. Most web browsers will render the contents of the HTML element [...] in their title bar, sometimes pre- or postfixed by the <b>application</b> <b>name.</b> Google Chrome and some versions of Mozilla Firefox place their tabs in the title bar. This makes it unnecessary to use the main window for the tabs, but usually results in the title becoming truncated.|$|E
5000|$|In 1982, Jerry Saltzer in {{his work}} “On the Naming and Binding of network destinations” [...] {{described}} the entities and the relationships that make a complete naming and addressing schema in networks. According to Saltzer four are the elements {{that need to be}} identified: applications, nodes, points of attachment to the network (PoA) and paths. An application can run in one or more nodes and should be able to move from one node to another without losing its identity in the network. A node can be connected to a pair of PoAs and should be able to move between them without losing its identity in the network. A directory maps an <b>application</b> <b>name</b> to a node address, and routes are sequences of nodes addresses and point of attachments.|$|E
5000|$|In {{order to}} {{accomplish}} this task, every CCOW compliant application on the machine must log into a central CCOW server called a Vault. The application sends an encrypted application passcode to verify its identity. Once the application is verified, it may change the active user (also called the [...] "context") on the machine. Each CCOW application also has an application [...] "name" [...] for which there can only be one instance. There is no correct <b>application</b> <b>name</b> (the passcode identifies which application is logging in). There may be multiple instances of the CCOW application connected to the CCOW vault from the same computer. However, they must have different names. One name might be [...] "I like HHAM", while the other might be [...] "I like CCOW". The names are completely arbitrary.|$|E
