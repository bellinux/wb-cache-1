The first graders and the second graders were answered about modus vivendi. Third, fourth, fifth, and sixth graders did about modus vivendi and stress responses. Scholastic <b>attainments</b> of fourth graders were used for analysis. The following results were obtained: modus vivendi consists of three sub concepts; regular life, tooth brushing and facial cleansing, and guidance before going out. Stress responses consist of two sub concepts; low concentration and aggression. Differences in grades and sex were partially confirmed. The relations between the modus vivendi, stress responses, and scholastic <b>attainments</b> were partially shown. In conclusion, the guidance of the modus vivendi to the grade school student might decrease stress responses and improve scholastic <b>attainments.</b> 本研究は 586 名の小学生を対象とした調査から、生活態度と不安・ストレス反応、学力の実態を把握し、これらの関連から、生活態度への指導が不安・ストレス反応と学力に与える影響を検討することを目的としたものである。分析の結果、生活態度は生活リズム、歯磨き・洗顔、家を出る前の指導という 3 つの下位概念からなっていること、不安・ストレス反応は集中力の低さ、攻撃性という 2 つの下位概念からなっていることが明らかにされた。生活態度と不安・ストレス反応については部分的に学年差と性差が確認された。生活態度と不安・ストレス反応、学力の関連より、小学生への生活態度の指導が不安・ストレス反応を低減し、学力を高める可能性が示唆された...|$|R
