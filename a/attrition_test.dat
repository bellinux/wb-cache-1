40|$|In many {{industries}} particulate solids {{are handled}} in different forms. When producing particles breakage {{is an important}} wanted, {{in the case of}} grinding, or unwanted phenomenon. Granules often consist of more than one component and multiple phases. This means that granules are strongly anisotropic and inhomogeneous which makes mechanical characterization difficult, so the strength is difficult to measure. The objective of this thesis is to develop and validate new particle breakage testers from an industrial point of view. The philosophy behind the breakage testers is to isolate the forces that cause damage to the particles. This requires repeated stress cycles to be transfered to the test particles. To validate the improved attrition tester with an industrial application, the damage per unit energy is compared to the damage caused during dilute phase pneumatic conveying. Wear observed during Pneumatic conveying correlates well with results from the improved attrition tester for particles having surface asperities. But only during the so called rounding off phase. The asperities act as a fracture buffer absorbing energy from the impact. First the attrition process removes asperities. Then fracture occurs. Besides the validation of the attrition tester a new breakage tester testing tangential forces is developed in this work. The abrasion tester, is based on a particle box following a planetary motion. This motion causes the particles to rotate continuously over the particle box wall. The particle wear during abrasion testing, expressed in mass loss over transferred kinetic energy is in the same order as during <b>attrition</b> <b>testing.</b> This is explained by the same efficiency at which the kinetic energy is converted into particle deformation. The kinetic energy is converted into newly created surface energy. And the efficiency at which this occurs is a particle property. The major difference between abrasion and <b>attrition</b> <b>testing</b> is the absence of the accelerated removal of surface asperities. A qualitative difference between abrasion and <b>attrition</b> <b>testing</b> is also presented. Abrasion is characterized by the gentle polishing of the particles. Whereas <b>attrition</b> <b>testing</b> results in the removal of the asperities and "craters" are visible of the impact sites of the particle with the wall. Often granules are coated with a water soluble polymeric coating in order to improve the mechanical strength. The question arises what polymeric properties are important to form a mechanically strong coating on a particle? The work of Rowe is cited about the adhesion of the coatings to the particles. Rowe found an inverse relation between coating thickness and film adhesion. Indicating that a thick coating does not necessarily leads to stronger granules. To study the influence of different coating polymers on the overall particle strength, particle formulations are made using fluidised bed coating. The formulated particles are then tested using the developed attrition, abrasion and compression tester. Three attrition sub regimes are identified, the peeling, erosion and layer fatigue modes. The conclusion is that for an elastic deforming brittle polymer, the layer fatigue attrition sub mechanism is expected. Applying a plastic deforming coating leads to a reservoir system where the fragments are held together by the plastic deforming coating. A plastic deforming coating on sodium benzoate shows the erosion mechanism during <b>attrition</b> <b>testing.</b> The coated granules are abrasion tested. A linear relation between remaining mass and transfered energy is observed. During abrasion testing {{it was not possible to}} remove all the coating completely. Apparently the rate of strain in the abrasion tester is not high enough for the coatings to be removed. Applying higher strain rates by increasing the centripetal force could overcome this. At this moment it is mechanically not possible. Also the coated particles are much stronger towards abrasion <b>testing</b> than to <b>attrition</b> <b>testing.</b> This is explained by the perceived thickness of the coating. The compression strength of coated granules is not easy to quantify since there is a large spread in the observed critical stress. This large spread is due to the heterogeneous nature of the granules. Weibull statistics are successfully applied to statistically describe the observed strength of the coated granules. Using Weibull statistics a ranking can be made between the coatings and the compression strength. A plastic deforming coating tends to hold the particle together as a reservoir upon compression. An elastic deforming coating has a higher initial strength without regions of plastic deformation. Individual failure of different layers is observed. This compares also to the layer fatigue attrition mechanism where initially no attrition is observed but after a while the granules start to fail. Chemical engineeringApplied Science...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThroughout {{the life}} of the track, ballast grains wear as a result of both the trains passing over the track and the {{maintenance}} operations (tamping). The morphology of the grains is changed: they lose angularity and fine particles are produced, causing a gradual loss of track performance. Eventually ballast renewal becomes necessary. In order to predict the evolution of this degradation, a multi-scale study is proposed. A comparison between discrete element method (DEM) simulations of Micro-Deval <b>attrition</b> <b>test</b> and of the passage of trains over a sleeper is performed in order to both detect the different loading and wearing mechanisms involved and quantify the amount of friction work produced, which is directly related to friction wear.

In order to develop efficient solutions for ballasted tracks design and maintenance, a proper knowledge of the degradation laws of ballast grains is needed.

40|$|The air jets method {{proved to}} be an {{important}} tool for assessing attrition propensity of fluidized bed catalyst in the laboratory, but the influence of test temperature and test time has seldom been considered. This paper focuses on the influence of test temperature and test time on the attrition mechanism of methanol to olefins (MTO) catalyst in high velocity air jets. The attrition time was prolonged to 144 h in current study. It has been found that test time should be carefully chosen in order to achieve an equilibrium attrition rate. A short test time is not sufficient to understand the attrition mechanism. Test temperature affects the attrition mechanism significantly. At room temperature the abrasion and fragmentation were found coexisting while at 500 degrees C the abrasion is dominant. The abrasion of MTO catalyst at 500 degrees C results in a severe generation of superfine powder that is hard to capture by downstream cyclones, which is in accordance with the findings in industrial MTO unit. Apparently the <b>attrition</b> <b>test</b> at room temperature cannot reflect the generation of superfine powder.

This paper expands on a previous investigation into manganese ores as {{oxygen carriers}} for CLC. The paper presents reactivity data for eight ores with widely different compositions. Most importantly, the ores contained significant quantities of Fe, Si, and Ca, with Fe/Mn and Si/Mn molar ratios that varied between 0. 1 - 4. 5 and 0. 07 - 0. 48, respectively. Pre-treatment of the ores consisted of heat treatment in air at 950 °C for 24 h followed by sieving to obtain a particle size fraction of 125 - 180 ?m. Reactivity towards methane and synthesis gas (50 vol% CO in H 2) and the oxygen uncoupling behaviour at 900, 950, and 1000 °C was investigated in a fluidized batch reactor. Material characterization of the ores included an <b>attrition</b> <b>test,</b> crushing strength, and BET surface area measurement. The oxygen carriers had a CO 2 yield of 31 - 80 % for syngas with 2 g of oxygen carriers using 450 ml/min of syngas. The performance for all ores as a function of number of cycles was stable. By using a pseudo-first-order rate constant, apparent activation energies were calculated at ? = 0. 999 and 0. 99 for methane and syngas, respectively, and the apparent activation energies varied in a wide range, from 110 to 328 kJ/mol for CH 4 and 10 to 168 kJ/mol for CO.

40|$|Fischer-Tropsch (FT) {{synthesis}} {{to convert}} syngas (CO + H{sub 2 }) derived from natural gas or coal to liquid fuels and wax is a well-established technology. For low H{sub 2 } to CO ratio syngas produced from CO{sub 2 } reforming {{of natural gas}} or from gasification of coal, the use of Fe catalysts is attractive because of their high water gas shift activity {{in addition to their}} high FT activity. Fe catalysts are also attractive due to their low cost and low methane selectivity. Because of the highly exothermic nature of the FT reaction, there has been a recent move away from fixed-bed reactors toward the development of slurry bubble column reactors (SBCRs) that employ 30 to 90 {micro}m catalyst particles suspended in a waxy liquid for efficient heat removal. However, the use of Fe FT catalysts in an SBCR has been problematic due to severe catalyst attrition resulting in fines that plug the filter employed to separate the catalyst from the waxy product. Fe catalysts can undergo attrition in SBCRs not only due to vigorous movement and collisions but also due to phase changes that occur during activation and reaction. The objectives of this research were to develop {{a better understanding of the}} parameters affecting attrition of Fe F-T catalysts suitable for use in SBCRs and to incorporate this understanding into the design of novel Fe catalysts having superior attrition resistance. The catalysts were prepared by co-precipitation, followed by binder addition and spray drying at 250 C in a 1 m diameter, 2 m tall spray dryer. The binder silica content was varied from 0 to 20 wt %. The results show that use of small amounts of precipitated SiO{sub 2 } alone in spray-dried Fe catalysts can result in good attrition resistance. All catalysts investigated with SiO{sub 2 } wt% {le} 12 produced fines less than 10 wt% during the jet cup <b>attrition</b> <b>test,</b> making them suitable for long-term use in a slurry bubble column reactor. Thus, concentration rather than type of SiO{sub 2 } incorporated into catalyst has a more critical impact on catalyst attrition resistance of spray-dried Fe catalysts. Lower amounts of SiO{sub 2 } added to a catalyst give higher particle densities and therefore higher attrition resistances. In order to produce a suitable SBCR catalyst, however, the amount of SiO{sub 2 } added has to be optimized to provide adequate surface area, particle density, and attrition resistance. Two of the catalysts with precipitated and binder silica were tested in Texas A&M University's CSTR (Autoclave Engineers). Spray-dried catalysts with compositions 100 Fe/ 5 Cu/ 4. 2 K/ 11 (P) SiO{sub 2 } and 100 Fe/ 5 Cu/ 4. 2 K/ 1. 1 (B) SiO{sub 2 } have excellent selectivity characteristics (low methane and high C{sub 5 }{sup +} yields), but their productivity and stability (deactivation rate) need to be improved. Mechanical integrity (attrition strength) of these two catalysts was markedly dependent upon their morphological features.

40|$|AbstractCarbon Capture and Storage is a {{promising}} method {{to limit the}} increasing amount of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. In this method high purity carbon dioxide is captured at large emission sources, e. g. fossil fuelled power plants. The carbon dioxide can then be transported to a long term storage site, rather than being emitted to the atmosphere. Among the different alternatives for obtaining high purity carbon dioxide during combustion of fossil fuels, Chemical-looping Combustion (CLC) {{is one of the}} most promising. Here, the oxygen needed to oxidize a fuel is provided by a solid oxygen carrier. The oxygen carrier is subsequently circulated to another reactor where it is reoxidized with air. By separating these two operations mixing of the combustion products and the nitrogen in the air is avoided. An energy demanding gas separation is thus not necessary. The most crucial part of Chemical-looping Combustion is the solid oxygen carrier. The oxygen carrier should have high reactivity with fuel and oxygen, sufficient oxygen carrying capacity and preferably also low cost. Furthermore it is important that it is able to withstand the tough conditions it is exposed to in a hot fluidizing environment, both with respect to physical attrition and chemical degradation. The most commonly suggested setup of Chemical- looping Combustion is a dual fluidized bed system where gas velocities and mechanical abrasion can be high. When the technology was first demonstrated, nickel oxide based oxygen carriers were typically used. But as nickel is quite costly as well as potentially harmful, alternatives have been sought after. In 2009 Leion et al. [1] investigated an oxygen carrier based on calcium manganite of perovskite structure CaMnO 3 -δ for chemical looping combustion. The results were very promising and similar materials have since then been successfully tested in pilot rigs up to 120 kWth, including extended operation in continuously operating 10 kWth reactor with very positive results, see Källén et al. [2]. A key feature of these materials is that they are able to release gas phase oxygen at relevant conditions, so called Chemical-looping with Oxygen Uncoupling, see Rydén et al. [3]. Having gas phase oxygen available for fuel oxidation makes gas-solid mixing less critical and thus makes it easier to reach complete fuel conversion. 2 Most studies in which CaMnO 3 -δ based oxygen carriers have been examined have been using particles manufactured from high quality chemicals. While that is reasonable in the early stages of development, cheaper raw materials would be favourable for industrial applications. Promising oxygen carriers based on manganese ores have been manufactured and characterized by Fossdal et al. [4] and Mohammad Pour et al. [5]. This study aims to further examine CaMnO 3 -δ based oxygen carriers made from low cost, commercial raw materials available in large quantities such as manganese ore. The materials are examined during continuous Chemical- looping Combustion and Oxygen Uncoupling in an experimental reactor with the nominal fuel power 300 Wth. The reactor has previously been used in numerous studies which make comparisons with materials made from high purity chemicals straightforward. During operation several gas concentrations as well as temperatures and pressure drops are measured which allows monitoring of the chemical reactions and fluidization behaviour in the reactor. Fines (particles < 45 μm) are collected from exiting gas streams which gives an indication of the degree of attrition of the particles. Attrition was also studied in separate jet cup <b>attrition</b> <b>test.</b> The study show that it is possible to manufacture CaMnO 3 -δ based oxygen carrier with appropriate properties for continuous operation from low-cost materials. The ability to release gas phase oxygen to an inert atmosphere and high conversion of natural gas is demonstrated.

40|$|The Fischer-Tropsch (F-T) {{reaction}} {{provides a}} way of converting coal-derived synthesis gas (CO+ H{sub 2 }) to liquid fuels. Since the reaction is highly exothermic, {{one of the major}} problems in control of the reaction is heat removal. Recent work has shown that the use of slurry bubble column reactors (SBCRs) can largely solve this problem. The use of iron-(FE) based catalysts is attractive not only due to their low cost and ready availability, but also due to their high water-gas shift activity which makes it possible to use these catalysts with low H{sub 2 }/CO ratios. However, a serious problem with the use of Fe catalysts in a SBCR is their tendency to undergo attrition. This can cause fouling/plugging of downstream filters and equipment; makes the separation of catalyst from the oil/wax product very difficult, if not impossible; and results in a steady loss of catalyst from the reactor. Under a previous Department of Energy (DOE) /University Research Grant (UCR) grant, Hampton University reported, for the first time, the development of demonstrably attrition-resistant Fe F-T synthesis catalysts having good activity, selectivity, and attrition resistance. These catalysts were prepared by spray drying Fe catalysts with potassium (K), copper (Cu), and silica (SiO{sub 2 }) as promoters. SiO{sub 2 } was also used as a binder for spray drying. These catalysts were tested for activity and selectivity in a laboratory-scale fixed-bed reactor. Fundamental understanding of attrition is being addressed by incorporating suitable binders into the catalyst recipe. This has resulted in the preparation of a spray dried HPR- 43 catalyst having average particle size (aps) of 70 {micro}m with high attrition resistance. This HPR- 43 attrition resistant, active and selective catalyst gave 95 % CO conversion through 125 hours of testing in a fixed-bed at 270 C, 1. 48 MPa, H{sub 2 }/CO= 0. 67 and 2. 0 NL/g-cat/h with C{sub 5 +} selectivity of > 78 % and methane selectivity of less than 5 % at an {alpha} of 0. 9. Research is proposed to enable further development and optimization of these catalysts by (1) better understanding the role and interrelationship of various catalyst composition and preparation parameters on attrition resistance, activity, and selectivity of these catalysts, (2) the presence of sulfide ions on a precipitated iron catalyst, and (3) the effect of water on sulfided iron F-T catalysts for its activity, selectivity, and attrition. Catalyst preparations will be based on spray drying. The research employed, among other measurements, attrition testing and F-T synthesis at high pressure. Catalyst activity and selectivity is evaluated using a small fixed-bed reactor and a continuous stirred tank reactor (CSTR). The catalysts were prepared by co-precipitation, followed by binder addition and spray drying at 250 C in a 1 -m-diameter, 2 -m-tall spray dryer. The binder silica content was varied from 0 to 20 wt%. The results show that the use of small amounts of precipitated SiO{sub 2 } alone in spray-dried Fe catalysts can result in good attrition resistance. All catalysts investigated with SiO 2 wt% {le} 12 produced fines less than 10 wt% during the jet cup <b>attrition</b> <b>test,</b> making them suitable for long-term use in a slurry bubble column reactor. Thus, concentration rather than the type of SiO{sub 2 } incorporated into catalyst has a more critical impact on catalyst attrition resistance of spray-dried Fe catalysts. Lower amounts of SiO{sub 2 } added to a catalyst give higher particle densities and therefore higher attrition resistances. In order to produce a suitable SBCR catalyst, however, the amount of SiO{sub 2 } added has to be optimized to provide adequate surface area, particle density, and attrition resistance. Two of the catalysts with precipitated and binder silica were tested in Texas A&M University's CSTR (Autoclave Engineers). The two catalysts were also tested at The Center for Applied Energy Research in Lexington, Kentucky of the University of Kentucky. Spray-dried catalysts with compositions 100 Fe/ 5 Cu/ 4. 2 K/ 11 (P) SiO{sub 2 } and 100 Fe/ 5 Cu/ 4. 2 K/ 1. 1 (B) SiO{sub 2 } have excellent selectivity characteristics (low methane and high C{sub 5 +} yields), but their productivity and stability (deactivation rate) need to be improved. Mechanical integrity (attrition strength) of these two catalysts was markedly dependent upon their morphological features. The attrition strength of the catalyst made out of largely spherical particles (1. 1 (B) SiO{sub 2 }) was considerably higher than that of the catalyst consisting of irregularly shaped particles (11 (P) SiO{sub 2 }) ...|$|E
40|$|The {{key element}} in gas-to-liquid {{technology}} is the Fischer-Tropsch (FT) synthesis in which liquid hydrocarbons are produced from syngas (CO and H 2). During FT synthesis the catalyst and the catalyst support are subjected to considerable wearing. γ-alumina is considered {{as one of the}} most promising materials for catalyst support in a slurry bubble column reactor although the resistance to attrition is not satisfying. The γ-alumina is prepared by spray drying and is a highly porous aggregate. In order to improve the resistance to attrition, the porous support has been modified by impregnation of a metal oxide precursor followed by thermal treatment. The objective of the present thesis was to find the underlying mechanisms for the enhanced mechanical performance of the modified catalyst support based on γ-alumina. The first part of the work was devoted to the processing of the γ-alumina based support, the second part to the thermal evolution of the phase composition and the microstructure of the support and the last part was concerned with the characterization of the resistance to attrition. The distribution of the impregnated salt was investigated by electron probe micro analysis and the element mapping demonstrated that the impregnated salt was not homogeneously distributed in the γ-alumina aggregates. The inhomogeneous distribution of the metal oxide formed by decomposition of the salt reflected the inhomogeneous packing of the primary γ-alumina crystallites in the aggregates, and incorporation of the metal oxide in the initial step to produce γ-alumina would improve the distribution of the metal oxide. Previous investigations have shown that enhancement of the attrition resistance was achieved after calcination at high temperature. In-situ high temperature X-ray diffraction was carried out to investigate the thermal evolution of the phase composition and crystal structure of several impregnated catalyst supports. Refinement of the diffraction data revealed that the chemical reaction between γ-alumina and the impregnated metal oxide was controlled by the valence of the metal oxide and the site preference of the metal cation in the spinel phase formed in the reaction. The reaction with γ-alumina and impregnated NiO or MgO was initiated at around 500 °C. A metastable solid solution between γ-alumina and NiAl 2 O 4 or MgAl 2 O 4 spinel was formed. The reaction between γ-alumina and ZnO was less pronounced and the initiation of the reaction was more challenging to determine. Additional materials prepared by solid state reactions were investigated to elucidate the crystal structure and solid solubility of alumina in NiAl 2 O 4 and similar spinels. The lattice parameter of the metastable solid solution between γ-alumina and the spinel revealed that α-alumina precipitated from the solid solution at around 1100 °C resulting in a reduction of Al 2 O 3 content in the spinel. The formation of the metastable solid solution prevented the direct transformation of γ-alumina to θ- and α-alumina. Transmission electron microscopy demonstrated that the reaction between the impregnated oxide and γ-alumina had a pronounced effect on the final microstructure of the support. Non-impregnated supports transformed to α-alumina crystallites with an approximate size of 200 nm after thermal treatment, while mainly crystallites in the range 20 – 40 nm were observed in the impregnated supports. Dependent of the homogeneity of the γ-alumina aggregates and the amount of the impregnated oxide some large α-alumina crystallites were also formed. The intergranular interface or neck formation between the crystallites was shown to be significantly enhanced by the impregnation. Investigation of γ-alumina, impregnated with a Mn oxide precursor, revealed that the final phase composition and microstructure was strongly dependent on the oxidation state of Mn. By heat treatment in reducing atmosphere, where MnO is stable, a similar microstructure to those impregnated with precursors of MgO, NiO and ZnO was obtained. Heat treatment in air or inert atmosphere, where Mn is stable in a higher oxidation state, the formation of the metastable spinel solid solution did not occur. The influence of the phase composition and the microstructure on the resistance to attrition was investigated by Vickers hardness indentation on individual catalyst support aggregates and a standard <b>attrition</b> <b>test.</b> It was demonstrated that the Vickers hardness showed a very good correlation with the wear resistance. The supports with the modified microstructures exhibited the best mechanical performance, while the pure alumina based supports with larger crystallites showed poor performance. The hardness and wear resistance of the modified supports revealed that the increase in the performance appeared concurrently with the precipitation of α-alumina. It was demonstrated that the most wear resistant microstructure corresponded to the ones with small crystallites of α-alumina and spinel with considerable neck formation or intergranular interfaces between the crystallites. X-ray diffraction revealed that the spinel formed in the modified supports were strained, reflecting the strong interfacial bond between the phases and the thermal mismatch of α-alumina and spinel. Effect of possible epitaxial relationship between the two phases was therefore discussed. Based on the present findings the enhanced mechanical performance of the modified catalyst support reflects a considerable modification of the microstructure, which reduce the grain growth and coarsening of α-alumina and the formation of strong intergranular interfaces between nano-crystalline spinel and α-alumina.

Air-jet <b>attrition</b> <b>tests</b> {{showed that the}} attrition strength of the resulting catalysts followed an order of C- 10 TEOS > C- 33 SS > C- 1 ONS > C- 10 SS, where C- 10 TEOS, as an example, refers to the catalyst with 10 wt. % silica using TEOS as its silica source. Characterizations show that the porosity and skeletal structure have strong correlation with catalyst attrition strength. Simultaneous hydrolysis of TEOS and co-precipitation caused C- 10 TEOS to have dense and continuous skeletal structure to have the high strength of its Ni-Mg/SiO 2 -Al 2 O 3 precursor particles and thus the improved attrition resistance of sprayed catalyst. Silica sol filled in the voids among precursor particles resulted in a compact framework in C- 33 SS but its Ni-Mg/Al 2 O 3 precursor had weak attrition resistance. Atmospheric syngas methanation over these catalysts at an SV of 600 NL g(- 1) h(- 1) in a fixed bed reactor clarified an activity order of C- 10 TEOS > C- 1 ONS approximate to C- 33 SS. The TEOS also enabled highly dispersed metallic Ni and many surface active sites to facilitate the methanation activity and stability of this catalyst. (C) 2017 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC.

40|$|The Fischer-Tropsch (F-T) {{reaction}} {{provides a}} way of converting coal-derived synthesis gas (CO and H{sub 2 }) to liquid fuels. Since the reaction is highly exothermic, {{one of the major}} problems in control of the reaction is heat removal. Recent work has shown that the use of slurry bubble column reactors (SBCRs) can largely solve this problem. Iron-based (Fe) catalysts are preferred catalysts for F-T when using low CO/H{sub 2 } ratio synthesis gases derived from modern coal gasifiers. This is because in addition to reasonable F-T activity, the F-T catalysts also possess high water gas shift (WGS) activity. However, a serious problem with the use of Fe catalysts in a SBCR is their tendency to undergo attrition. This can cause fouling/plugging of downstream filters and equipment, making the separation of catalyst from the oil/wax product very difficult if not impossible, and results in a steady loss of catalyst from the reactor. The objectives of this research are to develop {{a better understanding of the}} parameters affecting attrition resistance of Fe F-T catalysts suitable for use in SBCRs and to incorporate this understanding into the design of novel Fe catalysts having superior attrition resistance. Catalyst preparations will be based on the use of spray drying and will be scalable using commercially available equipment.

40|$|This thesis {{describes}} {{results of}} a study aimed at developing and evaluating attrition resistant iron catalysts prepared by spray drying technique. These catalysts are intended for Fischer-Tropsch (F-T) synthesis in a slurry bubble column reactor (SBCR). One of the major challenges {{associated with the use}} of SBCR for this purpose is the problem of catalyst/wax separation. If the catalyst particles break up into smaller ones during the F-T synthesis, these small particles (> 5 - 10 &# 61549;m in diameter) will cause problems with the catalyst/wax separation. Several research groups have worked on development of attrition resistant spray-dried iron catalysts, and methodology to measure and predict their attrition behavior. However, these <b>attrition</b> <b>tests</b> were not conducted under conditions representative of those encountered in a SBCR. In this work, the attrition behavior of six spray-dried catalysts and two precipitated catalysts was evaluated under slurry reaction conditions in a stirred tank slurry reactor (STSR). Spray-dried catalysts used in this study were prepared at Texas A&M University (TAMU) and at Hampton University (HU), employing different preparation procedures and silica sources (potassium silicate, tetraethyl orthosilicate or colloidal silica). The attrition properties of F-T catalysts were determined by measuring particle size distribution (PSD) of catalysts before and after F-T synthesis in the STSR. This provides a direct measure of changes in particle size distribution in the STSR, and accounts for both physical and chemical attrition effects. Also, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was used to investigate the mechanism of attrition - erosion vs. fracture, and to obtain morphological characteristics of catalysts. Spray dried 100 Fe/ 3 Cu/ 5 K/ 16 SiO 2 catalyst (WCS 3516 - 1), prepared from wet precursors using colloidal silica as the silica source, was the best in terms of its attrition strength. After 337 hours of F-T synthesis in the STSR, the reduction in the average particle size and generation of particles less than 10 &# 61549;m in diameter were found to be very small. This indicates that both particle fracture and erosion were insignificant during testing in the STSR. All other catalysts, except one of the spray dried catalysts synthesized at Hampton University, also had a good attrition resistance and would be suitable for use in slurry reactors for F-T synthesis...|$|R
40|$|The {{objectives}} {{of this research}} were to develop a model to use in combination with monitoring moisture content and particle size simultaneously in a fluidized bed granulator {{to determine the extent}} and mechanism of granule attrition during drying. By knowing a pre-determined granulation end-point (expected particle size and moisture content of the final granular product), the near-infrared (NIR) spectroscopic monitoring method was used in a real-time application to precisely determine when the granulation process had finished. The real-time measurements, combined with the mass and heat transfer behavior of the fluidized bed, provided a more robust method for determining the appropriate time points for the termination of binder addition, {{and the end of the}} drying cycle. The particle size enlargement during granulation wetting was fitted to a coalescence model. The drying curves measured real-time followed the established heat and mass transfer models. The use of these models makes altering a process to obtain a desired result during development a matter of science as opposed to trial and error (or relying only on experience). It was shown that a granulation dried at a lower fluidizing air temperature maintained a greater average particle size during drying than a granulation dried at a higher temperature. The amount of attrition due to both fracture and abrasion was lower in granulations dried at lower temperatures. The ability of a granulation to withstand attrition during fluidized bed drying did not correlate with the temperature of the material relative to the Tg of the polymer binder at the end of the granulation. The point at which the Tg passes the bed temperature, however, does correlate to an apparent change in attrition mechanism as well as to the end of the mass transfer limited drying stage. Additionally, granulations prepared with selected binder contents had varying attrition rates during fluid bed drying at the same drying temperature. The particle size change during drying was fit to the attrition models, and each granulation showed a different propensity for attrition. The real-time observed attrition correlated with the off-line <b>attrition</b> <b>tests,</b> indicating that a trend between attrition in the fluid bed and on the sieve exists. ...|$|R

40|$|The mining {{activity}} produces minerals to {{supply to the}} modern society with commodities. During the ore refining process large amounts of tailings are generated as waste. Tailings {{are the result of}} crushing and wet milling, typically in the size range of sand to silt and angular in shape. Tailings are in general deposited in tailings dams for permanent storage. Tailings dams are usually considered as walk-away solutions and needs to be designed and constructed to be safe in a long time perspective. Several incidents around the world have occurred in tailings dams both during construction and operation and after closure of the activities. The consequences of the failures may be fatal to the local society and harm the surrounding environment. Considering the consequences of failures and relatively few studies on tailings properties in a long term perspective {{there is a need for}} research. As a consequence of the operation and raising procedures of tailings dams, the conditions in the tailings dams could be considered to be dynamic in a longer perspective. Grain size distribution, formation of layers, pore pressures and stress states are continuously changing during the operation. Tailings may be susceptible to weathering in the deposit environment. The change of these factors needs to be addressed in the design of walk-away solutions. In this work image analysis, oedometer-, triaxial-, direct shear- and <b>attrition</b> <b>tests</b> has been carried out to study the tailings particle influence on fundamental geotechnical properties in a case study. The parameters have been compared to similar-sized natural materials. The effect of loading and physical weathering has been studied and evaluated by image analysis and sieving. The comparative test by natural materials shows that tailings, probably due to the irregular shape, initially arranges in looser interparticle structures. The looser arrangement makes tailings fills more susceptible to settlement compared to natural deposits in the same size range. The two most identified factors affecting the tailings on a particle level was the type of physical weathering and grain size. Static load, shearing and milling decreases the grain size but the effect on the individual particles were different. Large grains tend to maintain the shape or get rounded by physical degradation and finer grains get more angular by milling but rounded by shearing. An attempt has been done to predict the effect on friction angle as a function of angularity, grain size and initial void ratio. The increase in angularity in the model suggests an increase in the friction angle and so the increase of regularity (decrease of elongation relation). However the reduction of size will either reduces or compensates this effect. More studies are needed to verify this...|$|R
