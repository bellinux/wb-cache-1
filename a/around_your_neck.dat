500|$|Kaitlyn Hodnicki from Stature {{magazine}} {{found the}} [...] "seductive" [...] throbbing {{beat of the}} track [...] "completely at ease with Jared's risqué lyrics". Leto described [...] "Up in the Air" [...] as a passionate and energetic song that [...] "feels really free" [...] but also features the concept of constraint and tension, particularly evident in the line [...] "I'll wrap my hands <b>around</b> <b>your</b> <b>neck</b> so tight with love". Leto explained that the lyric plays on two different levels, giving a sexual connotation to the line, but also the idea of power and control. He further said that the song [...] "has to do with getting to a {{point in your life}} where you're ready {{to let go of the}} past, embrace change and become more of who you really are".|$|E
500|$|... "The {{ultimate}} thing {{behind the}} song {{is that if you}} don't express yourself, if you don't say what you want, then you're not going to get it. And in effect you are chained down by your inability to say what you feel or go after what you want. No matter how in control you think are about sexuality in a relationship there is always the power struggle... always a certain amount of compromise. Of being beholden, if you love them. You do it because you choose to. No one put the chain around this neck but me. I wrote 'Express Yourself' to tell women around the world that pick and choose the best for yourself, before that chain <b>around</b> <b>your</b> <b>neck,</b> kills you instead. It's my take on how man can express what they want, the same prerogative should be there for a woman too." ...|$|E

[...] "Wednesday morning I found {{this in the}} corner of the pasture where the sheep were worried. Your uncle admits that it was tied <b>around</b> <b>your</b> dog's <b>neck</b> on Tuesday." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Then," [...] {{said the}} relative, [...] "I want you, {{like a good}} boy, to fasten the rope to the brick and tie it <b>around</b> <b>your</b> damned <b>neck</b> and jump into the pond and drown yourself. In a few days I will send and have you fished up and buried because I shall need to dance on your grave." ...|$|R
2500|$|Although she was worshipped as {{the goddess}} of love, Ishtar was not {{the goddess of}} marriage, nor was she ever viewed as a mother goddess. A {{description}} of her {{from one of her}} hymns declares, [...] "When the servants let the flocks loose, and when cattle and sheep are returned to cow-pen and sheepfold, then, my lady, like the nameless poor, you wear only a single garment. The pearls of a prostitute are placed <b>around</b> <b>your</b> <b>neck,</b> and you are likely to snatch a man from the tavern." [...] Ishtar had many lovers; Guirand writes: ...|$|E
2500|$|Byrd {{later called}} joining the KKK [...] "the {{greatest}} mistake I ever made." [...] In 1997, {{he told an}} interviewer he would encourage young people {{to become involved in}} politics but also warned, [...] "Be sure you avoid the Ku Klux Klan. Don't get that albatross <b>around</b> <b>your</b> <b>neck.</b> Once you've made that mistake, you inhibit your operations in the political arena." [...] In his last autobiography, Byrd explained that he was a KKK member because he [...] "was sorely afflicted with tunnel vision—a jejune and immature outlook—seeing only what I wanted to see because I thought the Klan could provide an outlet for my talents and ambitions." [...] Byrd also said in 2005, [...] "I know now I was wrong. Intolerance had no place in America. I apologized a thousand times... and I don't mind apologizing over and over again. I can't erase what happened." ...|$|E
2500|$|The USA team faced Spain in the Gold medal game. In {{the opening}} minutes, the lead changed several times, until the USA team {{went on a}} 14–3 run {{to open up a}} 25–12 lead just {{before the end of the}} first quarter. The USA team {{extended}} the lead to 15 points by halftime. The USA team didn't have great shooting with under 40% for the game, but defensively held Spain to under 30%. USA's Stephanie Dolson said [...] "Last year was an experience of a lifetime because that was qualifying for here. Then winning the world championship gold medal is so surreal. Getting up there, getting the gold <b>around</b> <b>your</b> <b>neck,</b> it's a moment you'll never forget". Dolson was one of the three high-scorers for the game, with 15 points, sharing the honors with Kaleena Mosqueda-Lewis, and Elizabeth Williams. The all-tournament team included two members of the USA squad, Ariel Massengale and Breanna Stewart.|$|E

I intended you to speculate, {{and you did}} speculate. I meant you to lose, and you have lost. The money I lent to your wife was meant to remain a rope <b>around</b> <b>your</b> <b>neck.</b> The fact that I lent it to her was intended to humiliate you, the attentions which I purposely paid to her in public were intended to convey a false impression to society--and in this, too, I fancy that I have been successful." ...|$|E

"If I {{were ten}} times a millionaire," [...] he said, rising to his feet, [...] "I would never risk a penny {{of my money}} to rid you of the {{millstone}} you have hung <b>around</b> <b>your</b> <b>neck.</b> It {{is going to be}} part of my activity in life, Mr. Bultiwell, to assist nature in dispensing justice. For many years you have ruled the trade in which we were both brought up, and during the whole of that time you have never accomplished a single gracious or kindly action. You have wound up by trying to drag me into a business which is rotten to the core. Your accountants may be technically justified in reckoning that hundred and forty thousand pounds owed you by those six men as good, because they never failed, but you yourself know that they are hopelessly insolvent, and that the moment you stop renewing their bills they will topple down like ninepins.... I would not help you if you were starving. I shall read of your bankruptcy with pleasure. There is, I think, nothing more to be said." ...|$|E
60|$|If you had {{the good}} fortune to be born and bred in the Bay State, your mind is thronged with half-sad, half-humorous recollections. The a-b abs of little voices long since hushed in the mould, or ringing now in the pulpit, at the bar, or in the Senate-chamber, come back to the ear of memory. You {{remember}} the high stool on which culprits used to be elevated with the tall paper fool's-cap on their heads, blushing to the ears; and you think with wonder how you have seen them since as men climbing the world's penance-stools of ambition without a blush, and gladly giving everything for life's caps and bells. And you have pleasanter memories of going after pond-lilies, of angling for horn-pouts,--that queer bat among the fishes,--of nutting, of walking over the creaking snow-crust in winter, when the warm breath of every household was curling up silently in the keen blue air. You wonder if life has any rewards more solid and permanent than the Spanish dollar that was hung <b>around</b> <b>your</b> <b>neck</b> to be restored again next day, and conclude sadly that it was but too true a prophecy and emblem of all worldly success. But your moralizing is broken short off by a rattle of feet and the pouring forth of the whole swarm,--the boys dancing and shouting,--the mere effervescence of the fixed air of youth and animal spirits uncorked,--the sedater girls in confidential twos and threes decanting secrets out of the mouth of one cape-bonnet into that of another. Times have changed since the jackets and trousers used to draw up on one side of the road, and the petticoats on the other, to salute with bow and courtesy the white neckcloth of the parson or the squire, if it chanced to pass during intermission.|$|E
