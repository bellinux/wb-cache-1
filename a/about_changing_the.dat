5|$|Johnson set <b>about</b> <b>changing</b> <b>the</b> wing's {{tactical}} approach. He quickly {{forced the}} wing {{to abandon the}} line-astern tactics for the finger-four formation which offered much more safety in combat; enabling multiple pilots to participate in scanning the skies for enemy aircraft {{so as to avoid}} an attack, and also being better able to spot and position their unit for a surprise attack upon the enemy. Johnson made another alteration to his units operations. He loathed ground-attack missions which highly trained fighter pilots were forced to participate in. He abandoned ground attack missions whenever he could. During these weeks, Johnson's wing escorted United States Army Air Forces (USAAF) bombers to targets in France. On a fighter sweep, Ramrod 49, Johnson destroyed an Fw 190 for his eighth victory. Unteroffizier Hans Hiess from 6 Staffel bailed out, but his parachute failed to open.|$|E
5|$|Katzenberg, Schneider, and Roy Disney set <b>about</b> <b>changing</b> <b>the</b> {{culture of}} the studio, {{increasing}} staffing and production so that a new animated feature would be released every year instead of every two to four. The first of the releases on the accelerated production schedule was Oliver & Company (1988), which featured an all-star cast including Billy Joel and Bette Midler and an emphasis on a modern pop soundtrack. Oliver & Company opened in the theaters {{on the same day}} as another Bluth/Amblin/Universal animated film, The Land Before Time; however, Oliver outgrossed Time and {{went on to become the}} most successful animated feature to that date.|$|E
5|$|Levine {{confirmed}} in March 2013 {{that the film}} has been officially cancelled. Levine stated that after Warner's Watchmen film in 2009 did not {{do as well as}} the studio expected, they had concerns with the $200 million budget that Verbinski had for the BioShock film. They asked him to consider doing the film on a smaller $80 million budget, but Verbinski did not want to accept this. In February 2017, Verbinski said that his crew were about eight weeks from starting filming, with plans for many elaborate sets given that the setting of Rapture could not be something easily shot on existing locations, requiring the $200 million budget. Verbinski was anticipating on releasing the film with an R-rating, when Universal approached him <b>about</b> <b>changing</b> <b>the</b> film's direction. Universal requested that he tone down the film and aim instead for a PG-13 movie, which would be able to draw more audiences to the film and recoup the larger budget he asked for. Verbinski insisted on keeping the R-rating, and refused the smaller budget Universal offered to make the R-rated version. Universal felt that that expensive a film with the limited R-rating would be too much of a risk, and pulled him from the film. Universal then subsequently brought in a new director to work with the smaller budget, but Levine and 2K Games did not feel that the new director was a good fit with the material. Universal then let Levine make the decision to end the project, which he did believing that the film would not work with the current set of compromises {{they would have had to}} make.|$|E

25|$|On June 19, 2017, famous poker player, {{businessman}} and European Parliament member Antanas Guoga bought major stake {{of the club}} (2/4) from Sigitas Židonis and Remigijus Kazilionis. Two remaining stake owners Darius Gudelis and Vilnius City Municipality retained their rights to the club (1/4 each). On June 20, 2017, Gedvydas Vainauskas resigned from the Rytas president post following 20 years of operation since {{the founding of the}} club in 1997 just a week after receiving award from LKL president Remigijus Milašius for merits to basketball. Shortly after becoming new owner of the club, Guoga sparked discussions <b>about</b> <b>changing</b> <b>the</b> club's name and invited the public to offer their ideas since the team no longer have connections with the Vainauskas' newspaper Lietuvos rytas. The idea was strictly criticised by the club's elite fans group B Tribūna (Rytas Ultras), who told that the only team they will support is black-white-red Rytas. On June 21, 2017, the new owners organized a meeting, during which first changes were made: public institution Krepšinio rytas was renamed to Statyba in order to remember the historical BC Statyba, Darius Gudelis replaced Martynas Purlys in the club's director position and it was decided that the club's name Lietuvos rytas will be changed in not longer than 1-year term with the most likely but not yet final choice being Rytas. Guoga also told media that it is very likely that at least two Lithuanian basketball stars will participate in the team activities, bearing in mind Jonas Valančiūnas, Linas Kleiza and Arvydas Macijauskas. On July 4, 2017, Gudelis announced that former assistant coach Alberto Blanco and Linas Kleiza are joining the club, whose first task will be assisting Rimas Kurtinaitis to bring together new roster of the team. On July 13, 2017, press conference was held during which it was announced that Kleiza also became shareholder of the club by receiving part of the Guoga's stake, was named vice-president of the club and will also act as sports director. Limited liability company Norvelita and Perlas also became shareholders of the club.|$|E

500|$|The {{lyrics of}} [...] "Change" [...] speak of {{overcoming}} obstacles and achieving triumph, while instilling hope in oneself. It {{centers around the}} concept of surpassing others' expectations and the limitations they set out. The song turns the notion of fearlessness into a movement that is not specified. Dave Heaton of PopMatters noted the lyric [...] "I believe in whatever you do" [...] meant Swift was unconcerned with {{the specifics of the}} cause. He presumed it was a universal message or was <b>about</b> <b>changing</b> <b>the</b> traditions of country music sound and defying the expectations of what country artists can achieve with their careers.

500|$|However, {{despite what}} Kobayashi said, not every single staff member {{was on the}} same page <b>about</b> <b>changing</b> <b>the</b> {{gameplay}} system. Kobayashi mentioned how some of the development team felt depressed and were hard to motivate after the focus of the game shifted from horror to action. Although Mikami demanded the camera system to be completely revised, the staff members had reservations about making big changes to the series he had created. Eventually, he intervened, explained his proposed changes, and wrote a new story for the title that, unlike previous installments, was not centered on the company Umbrella. Inspired by , a game Mikami had enjoyed playing but felt could have been better with a different view, he decided to place the camera behind the playable character. To go along with the new gameplay and story, a new type of enemy called [...] "Ganado" [...] was created, as opposed to using the undead creatures from previous Resident Evil games. Furthermore, producers expended additional detail to modify and update characters that had previously appeared in the series. In a documentary explaining the conception of the game's characters, Kamiya stated he intended to make Leon Kennedy [...] "look tougher, but also cool".|$|E

Blackman was selected {{for the role of}} Pussy Galore because of her role in The Avengers and the script was rewritten to show Blackman's judo abilities. The character's name follows in the tradition of other Bond girls names that are double entendres. Concerned about censors, the producers thought <b>about</b> <b>changing</b> <b>the</b> character's name to [...] "Kitty Galore", but they and Hamilton decided [...] "if you were a ten-year old boy and knew what the name meant, you weren't a ten-year old boy, you were a dirty little bitch. The American censor was concerned, but we got round that by inviting him and his wife out to dinner and [...] we were big supporters of the Republican Party." [...] During promotion, Blackman took delight in embarrassing interviewers by repeatedly mentioning the character's name. Whilst the American censors did not interfere with the name in the film, they refused to allow the name [...] "Pussy Galore" [...] to appear on promotional materials and for the US market she was subsequently called [...] "Miss Galore" [...] or [...] "Goldfinger's personal pilot".|$|E

While none of the recent episodes have been bad, they haven't been anything special. For a hundredth episode, average simply isn't good enough. While the shooting of Daniel at the end was stunning, I expected something much more {{from the rest of}} the episode than learning the identity of Daniel's parents." [...] A reviewer for TVoholic.com thought the episode was good, though not as good as [...] "The Constant", and he thought [...] "it came with lots of answers and references to past episodes from this season and the ones before it, making it all the more exciting." [...] The reviewer would, however, have [...] "loved any sort of explanation as to why [...] changed his mind <b>about</b> <b>changing</b> <b>the</b> past or how he thought this could work.

[...] Jon Lachonis of TVOvermind said that as an internal character piece, [...] "The Variable" [...] was not [...] "so much a great ending for Daniel. We brushed up against many key events and people – Theresa, Daniel’s ‘nurse’, and the Widmore and Eloise parental connection, etc. – but these forays into the geniuses’ past events were more to thread Daniel through the plot than to establish their connection to who Daniel truly was." ...|$|E
500|$|Part of the game's {{inspiration}} {{came from}} the fantasy worlds that the lyrics and album covers of metal bands implied but rarely made it to music videos, thus allowing Brütal Legend to [...] "fulfill the promise" [...] of such lore. Schafer also credits a Megadeth roadie named Tony he once met as having given him the idea to make a game about a roadie, with the character of Eddie Riggs becoming a re-imagined version of him. Schafer had previously explored {{the idea of a}} roadie sent back in time with the character of Hoagie from Day of the Tentacle, but Brütal Legend represented an opportunity to expand on it further. The 2003 movie School of Rock also reminded Schafer of his idea for Brütal Legend, and made him more excited to publish it. [...] Double Fine's philosophy on game development was also another reason for Brütal Legends creation, as Schafer has stated that his team attempts to make each game radically different from the company's previous release, contrasting Brütal Legend to Psychonauts. Schafer stated that the commercial tie-ins of Brütal Legend, such as [...] "hot babes and Jack Black", is due to this philosophy and not due to market pressures. Schafer was not concerned about the commercial success of Brütal Legend, as despite poor sales of Psychonauts, [...] "as long as you make a cool game, publishers want to talk to you". When Schafer was pitching the game before 2006, he received feedback <b>about</b> <b>changing</b> <b>the</b> game's style to hip hop or country. He credits Harmonix Music Systems for influencing the rhythm game market through the release of the widely successful Guitar Hero with a soundtrack that heavily emphasized metal music; with the popularity of Guitar Hero, the metal approach in Brütal Legend was readily accepted.|$|E

Others argued that overthrowing the monarchy was more important and that a well-organized and disciplined revolutionary party was essential.
