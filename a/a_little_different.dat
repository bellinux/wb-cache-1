The outer jets are for preheat flames of oxygen and acetylene. The central jet carries only oxygen for cutting. The use of several preheating flames {{rather than a}} single flame {{makes it possible to}} change the direction of the cut as desired without changing the position of the nozzle or the angle which the torch makes with the direction of the cut, as well as giving a better preheat balance. Manufacturers have developed custom tips for Mapp, propane, and polypropylene gases to optimize the flames from these alternate fuel gases.|$|E

Miller was a fan of McBride's novel prior to learning of the film adaptation by Lee.

500|$|The {{second and}} third seasons of the series were {{broadcast}} in two blocks each, with a season of Agent Carter airing in between. Bell explained that this decision was made following the challenge of producing 22 episodes for the first season to be aired over 36–40 weeks, which meant having repeats and [...] "losing momentum". Instead, Agent Carter took up much of that gap in a row, leaving the back half of Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.s season to run uninterrupted. This format allowed the producers and writers to approach each season in two parts, each with distinct stories connected by carried-over elements. Ahead of the fourth season, Tancharoen explained, [...] "For the past two seasons, we've been able to break our season down into two little mini-seasons because of the airdate schedule.

Your shows reward knowledge. We punish ignorance." [...] The game show is partly based on the Japanese show Za Gaman, as well as the British show Family Fortunes.
