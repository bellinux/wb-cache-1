50|$|The scrape <b>adhesion</b> <b>test</b> {{measures}} {{the determination of}} the adhesion of organic coatings when applied to smooth, flat panel surfaces. It is helpful in giving relative ratings for a number of coated panels showing significant differences in adhesion. The materials being tested are applied at uniform thickness to flat panels, mainly some sort of sheet metal. When the materials have dried the adhesion is determined by pressing panels under a rounded stylus that is loaded with increasing amounts of weight until the coating is removed from the substrate surface.|$|E
50|$|Use {{of laser}} shocks {{to measure the}} bond {{strength}} of coatings on metals has been developed {{over a period of}} years in France called LASAT for Laser <b>Adhesion</b> <b>Test.</b> This application is also based on the behavior of shockwaves to reflect from the rear free surface of a work piece as a tensile wave. If the back surface is coated with an adherent coating, the tensile wave can be tailored to fracture the bond upon reflection from the surface. By controlling the characteristics of the shock wave, the bond strength of the coating can be measured, or alternatively, determined in a comparative sense.|$|E
50|$|For track testing, a {{detergent}} based solution {{has historically}} been used to provide low <b>adhesion</b> <b>test</b> conditions. European and international standards often refer to this test method (BS-EN 15595, UIC 541-05). In the UK, British Rail Research adopted two approaches including a laboratory simulation method to all WSP approvals from around 1992, and track testing using carefully conditioned paper tape adhered to the railhead. The paper tape method used in the UK is believed to offer a realistic representation of the challenging very low adhesion conditions encountered during the autumn leaf fall. With {{an increase in the}} privatisation of railways in Europe, track testing has become very expensive to organise and to conduct. As a consequence, simulation based testing is rapidly becoming more popular with WSP manufacturers and national bodies.|$|E

40|$|International audienceAn <b>adhesion</b> <b>test</b> {{procedure}} {{applied to}} plasma-sprayed hydroxyapatite (HA) coatings {{to measure the}} “LASAT threshold” (LAser Shock <b>Adhesion</b> <b>test)</b> is described. The good repeatability and minimal discrepancy of the laser-driven <b>adhesion</b> <b>test</b> data were ascertained for conventional plasma sprayed HA coatings. As a further demonstration, the procedure was applied to HA coatings with diverse characteristics on the ceramic/metal interface. Different preheating and grit blasting conditions {{and the presence of}} a thick plasma-sprayed Ti sublayer or a thin TiO 2 layer prepared by oxidation were investigated through LASAT. It was assessed that a rough surface can significantly improve the coating's bond strength. However, it was also demonstrated that a thin TiO 2 layer on a smooth Ti- 6 Al- 4 V substrate can have a major influence on adhesion as well. Preheating up to 270 °C just prior to the first HA spraying pass had no effect on the adhesion strength. Further development of the procedure was done to achieve an in situ LASAT with in vitro conditions applied on HA coatings. To that end, different crystalline HA contents were soaked in simulated body fluid (SBF).

40|$|A novel {{technique}} is developed to measure quantitatively the adhesion strength of metallizations deposited on substrates such as silicon. Electrostatic <b>adhesion</b> <b>testing</b> employs electrostatic forces to generate delaminating stresses in thin metallic films. The interfacial adhesion strength is readily {{calculated from the}} electrode geometry and the applied electrostatic field at failure. Unlike other <b>adhesion</b> <b>tests,</b> this technique does not require any mechanical contact and is virtually independent of the plastic deformation of the film. Furthermore. this test provides direct strength measurements as opposed to work or energy of adhesion measurements obtained by the common peel-test. The adhesion strengths of several metallizations (Cu, Al, Al-Cu alloy, and TiN) are characterized using this electrostatic technique. The distribution of stress-at-failure data follows Weibull statistics. Field emission scanning electron microscopy reveals that films are delaminated in a micro-blister-type mode. Annealing of metallizations causes reactions and changes flaw distributions. The presence of brittle compounds near the interface may create easy fracture paths and can act as stress concentrators to initiate and propagate the fracture. These stressed areas may lead to localized adhesion failure under applied stress. It is shown that electrostatic <b>adhesion</b> <b>testing</b> is effective in providing quantitative values for the adhesion strengths and failure probabilities of thin-film metallizations...|$|R

Short-term <b>adhesion</b> <b>tests</b> were carried out under static, no-flow conditions for 1 h using bovine serum albumin, a common model globular protein, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, a common model Gram-negative bacterium.

40|$|Adhesion {{is defined}} as the {{molecular}} force of attraction in the area of contact between unlike bodies of adhesive materials and substrates that acts to hold the bodies together. In the context of asphalt mixtures, adhesion is used to refer to the amount of energy required to break the adhesive bond between bitumen (bitumen-filler mastic) and aggregates. Thus, adhesive failure can be considered as displacement of bitumen (bitumen-filler) mastic from aggregates surface, which might indicates low magnitude of adhesive bond strength. Adhesion is considered as one of the main fundamental properties of asphalt mixtures, which can be correlated with quality, performance and serviceability. However, despite its significance, research on adhesion of asphalt mixtures is limited and yet there is no established testing technique and procedure {{that can be used to}} quantify the adhesive bond strength between bitumen (bitumen-filler mastic) and aggregates. Only in the past few years, some efforts have been conducted in developing testing techniques and procedures for measuring the adhesive bond strength of bitumen and aggregates. However, the developed testing techniques and procedures have not enjoyed universal success and acceptance, and not yet established. Hence, emphasis of this study is focused on the development of laboratory <b>adhesion</b> <b>test</b> method that can be used to directly measure the adhesive bond strength between bitumen (bitumen-filler mastic) and aggregates. Also, adhesive bond strength and failure characteristics of various combinations of asphalt mixture materials over wide ranges of testing conditions were evaluated in order to validate the reliability and efficiency of the developed laboratory <b>adhesion</b> <b>test</b> method. This study was divided into three parts. In Part 1, a detailed review of literature on various testing techniques and procedures used to measure the adhesive bond strength in numerous areas of scientific literature and international standards was performed, in order to assess and thus to propose the most suitable and realistic approach for development of laboratory <b>adhesion</b> <b>test</b> method for asphalt mixtures. In Part 2, the proposed <b>adhesion</b> <b>test</b> method was subjected to evaluation, mainly based on trial and error experimental approach, in order to adapt and thus to develop the criteria and procedures for test setup and apparatus, specimen preparation, testing and data analysis. The established criteria and procedures were then used for detailed evaluation in Part 3, in order to quantify the test results of various combinations of asphalt mixture materials (i. e. bitumen (bitumen-filler mastic) and aggregates) over wide ranges of thicknesses of adhesive layer of bitumen, aspect ratio of specimens, testing conditions (i. e. deformation rates and test temperatures) and conditioning procedures (dry and wet conditionings). Results of the study were subjected to comparative analysis in order to determine the effect of various variables and parameters on the test results, to propose suitable testing conditions and to validate the reliability and efficiency of the laboratory <b>adhesion</b> <b>test</b> method.
