5|$|Analyses {{has been}} {{published}} by currency strategists at RBS, scoring countries on their potential to undertake intervention, measuring their relative intention to weaken their currency and their capacity to do so. Ratings {{are based on the}} openness of a country's economy, export growth and real effective exchange rate (REER) valuation, as well as the scope a country has to weaken its currency without damaging its economy. As of January 2013, Indonesia, Thailand, Malaysia, Chile and Sweden are the most willing and able to intervene, while the UK and New Zealand are <b>among</b> <b>the</b> <b>least.</b>|$|E

At the same time he has been <b>among</b> <b>the</b> <b>least</b> favored politicians {{in the history of the}} United States: his approval rating when leaving office was only 13%.|$|E
5|$|Natural {{ytterbium}} is {{a mixture}} of seven stable isotopes, which altogether are present at concentrations of 3 parts per million. This element is mined in China, the United States, Brazil, and India in form of the minerals monazite, euxenite, and xenotime. The ytterbium concentration is low because it is found only among many other rare earth elements; moreover, it is <b>among</b> <b>the</b> <b>least</b> abundant. Once extracted and prepared, ytterbium is somewhat hazardous as an eye and skin irritant. The metal is a fire and explosion hazard.|$|E

5|$|Ratanakiri is sparsely populated; its 150,000 {{residents}} make up {{just over}} 1% of the country's total population. Residents generally live in villages of 20 to 60 families {{and engage in}} subsistence shifting agriculture. Ratanakiri is <b>among</b> <b>the</b> <b>least</b> developed provinces of Cambodia. Its infrastructure is poor, and the local government is weak. Health indicators in Ratanakiri are extremely poor; men's life expectancy is 39 years, and women's is 43 years. Education levels are also low, with just under half of the population illiterate.|$|E
5|$|During {{the later}} 20th century and afterward, {{many of the}} {{communities}} and businesses in the area began cooperative efforts, including the Clear Lake Area Chamber of Commerce, the Bay Area Houston Economic Partnership, and the Bay Area Houston Transportation Partnership, to create a distinct economic and civic identity for the region and to plan regional development. Though most of the communities {{in the region have}} been incorporated into municipalities, a few unincorporated communities remain under the extra-territorial jurisdiction of neighboring towns. These include San Leon, Bacliff, and Smith Point. The communities of San Leon and Bacliff, despite their seaside location, their proximity to the relatively prosperous Clear Lake Area, and the development of summer resort communities there in the early 20th century, have suffered economic decline since the mid-20th century and are <b>among</b> <b>the</b> <b>least</b> affluent parts of the Bay Area today.|$|E
5|$|Fork-marked lemurs are <b>among</b> <b>the</b> <b>least</b> studied of all lemurs, {{and little}} is known about them. Only the pale fork-marked lemur (P.pallescens) has been studied {{relatively}} well, primarily by Pierre Charles-Dominique, Jean-Jacques Petter, and Georges Pariente during two expeditions in the 1970s and a more extensive 1998 study in Kirindy Forest. Like the other cheirogaleids, these lemurs are nocturnal, sleeping in tree hollows (typically in large baobab trees) or abandoned nests built by giant mouse lemurs (Mirza coquereli) during the day. Some of the abandoned nests they sleep in are leaf-lined, and fresh leaves are often added when young are born. As many as 30sleeping sites may be used {{over the course of a}} year, each for a variable length of time.|$|E

5|$|People {{may simply}} like most {{what they see}} most. Letters that appear more {{frequently}} in everyday usage also occur more often in people's names. Forer, in 1940, and Alluisi and Adams, in 1962, found {{a positive correlation between}} the frequency of occurrence of letters and phonemes and how attractive they were judged to be. Zajonc extended these studies, using foreign symbols and controlling the number of exposures. This led him to formulate the mere-exposure hypothesis: the more you see something, the more you like it. Nuttin's original study showed that mere exposure can not be the cause of the name-letter effect, as letters with equal frequency were evaluated differently by people who had the letter in their names and those who did not. He also found that whereas the letter B is of low frequency in French and the letter Q of medium frequency, in experiments with French speakers the B was among the most highly liked letters and the Q was <b>among</b> <b>the</b> <b>least</b> liked. Similarly, in Polish the Y is a medium frequency letter, yet was still <b>among</b> <b>the</b> <b>least</b> preferred letters. In each of the languages, the least frequent letters were over-represented in the set of least preferred letters, whereas the most preferred letters were rarely the highest frequency letters. The exposure counts in the lab studies done by Zajonc (20 to 25 times) were minuscule compared to real-life observation counts of any letter, which also caused Nuttin to cast doubt on whether Zajonc's theory could hold true in the real world.|$|E
5|$|The 1919 Atlantic {{hurricane}} season was <b>among</b> <b>the</b> <b>least</b> active {{hurricane season}}s in the Atlantic on record, featuring only five tropical storms. Of those five tropical cyclones, two of them intensified into a hurricane, with one strengthening into a major hurricane (category3 or higher on the Saffir–Simpson hurricane wind scale.) Two tropical depressions developed {{in the month of}} June, both of which caused negligible damage. A tropical storm in July brought minor damage to Pensacola, Florida, but devastated a fleet of ships. Another two tropical depressions formed in August, the first of which brought rainfall to the Lesser Antilles.|$|E
5|$|The outer {{surfaces}} of cometary nuclei {{have a very}} low albedo, making them <b>among</b> <b>the</b> <b>least</b> reflective objects found in the Solar System. The Giotto space probe found that the nucleus of Halley's Comet reflects about four percent of the light that falls on it, and Deep Space 1 discovered that Comet Borrelly's surface reflects less than 3.0% of the light that falls on it; by comparison, asphalt reflects seven percent. The dark surface material of the nucleus may consist of complex organic compounds. Solar heating drives off lighter volatile compounds, leaving behind larger organic compounds that {{tend to be very}} dark, like tar or crude oil. The low reflectivity of cometary surfaces causes them to absorb the heat that drives their outgassing processes.|$|E

5|$|The {{title is}} known for its intense difficulty, which {{contributes}} to its reputation as a black sheep in the franchise. Reviewers viewed The Lost Levels {{as an extension of the}} original release, especially its difficulty progression. Journalists appreciated the game's challenge when spectating speedruns, and recognized the game as a precursor to the franchise's subculture in which fans create and share nearly impossible levels. This sequel gave Luigi his first character traits and introduced the poison mushroom item, which would be used throughout the Mario franchise. The Lost Levels was the most popular game on the Disk System, for which it sold about 2.5 million copies. It is remembered among the most difficult games by Nintendo and in the video game medium, and <b>among</b> <b>the</b> <b>least</b> important games in the Mario series.|$|E
5|$|Grinsell {{was born}} in London on 14 February 1907. With his family, he moved to Brighton shortly after the First World War. There, his {{interest}} in archaeology was encouraged by H. S. Toms, the curator of Brighton Museum who had formerly been an assistant to the archaeologist Augustus Pitt Rivers. Moving back to London, in 1925 Grinsell became a clerk for Barclays Bank. Although he had developed his interest in prehistory through an examination of stone tools, he came to focus his attention on barrows, recognising that these were <b>among</b> <b>the</b> <b>least</b> well understood prehistoric monuments in the British landscape {{and one of the}} few that could be studied from the position of an amateur. At the time, a number of antiquarians were still active in southern England, with Grinsell being encouraged in his interests by prominent figures in this milieu such as Eliot Curwen and Hadrian Allcroft.|$|E
5|$|In late 2004, the National Annenberg Election Survey at the University of Pennsylvania ran a {{study of}} American {{television}} viewers and found that fans of The Daily Show had a more accurate idea of the facts behind the 2004 presidential election than most others, including those who primarily got their news through the national network evening newscasts and through reading newspapers. However, in a 2004 campaign {{survey conducted by the}} Pew Research Center those who cited comedy shows such as The Daily Show as a source for news were <b>among</b> <b>the</b> <b>least</b> informed on campaign events and key aspects of the candidates' backgrounds while those who cited the Internet, National Public Radio, and news magazines were the most informed. Even when age and education were taken into account, the people who learned about the campaigns through the Internet were still found to be the most informed, while those who learned from comedy shows were the least informed.|$|E
