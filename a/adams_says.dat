He also drew all but three of the first 23 covers and interior frontispieces to Classic X-Men from 1986 to 1988. His interior X-Men-related work included a two-issue run on X-Factor and the one-shot , both in 1989, and three Uncanny X-Men Annuals, in 1986, 1988 and 1990. It was in drawing the 1988 annual that <b>Adams</b> <b>says</b> he felt like a professional comic book artist for the first time, as he first felt confident that {{he knew what he was}} doing.|$|E

500|$|According to Chad Meister, {{professor}} of philosophy at Bethel College, most philosophers accept Plantinga's free will defense and thus see the logical problem of evil as having been sufficiently rebutted. Robert <b>Adams</b> <b>says</b> that [...] "it {{is fair to say}} that Plantinga has solved this problem. That is, he has argued convincingly for the consistency of God and evil." [...] William Alston has said that [...] "Plantinga [...] has established the possibility that God could not actualize a world containing free creatures that always do the right thing." [...] William L. Rowe has written [...] "granted incompatibilism, there is a fairly compelling argument for the view that the existence of evil is logically consistent with the existence of the theistic God", referring to Plantinga's argument.|$|E

500|$|Like {{the kings}} before him, Henry faced dissenters. The first open revolt {{occurred}} {{two years after}} Bosworth Field; Lambert Simnel claimed to be Edward Plantagenet, 17th Earl of Warwick, who was Edward IV's nephew. The Earl of Lincoln backed him for the throne and led rebel forces {{in the name of}} the House of York. [...] The rebel army fended off several attacks by Northumberland's forces, before engaging Henry's army at the Battle of Stoke Field on 16 June 1487. [...] Oxford and Bedford led Henry's men, including several former supporters of Richard III. [...] Henry won this battle easily, but other malcontents and conspiracies would follow. [...] A rebellion in 1489 started with Northumberland's murder; military historian Michael C. C. <b>Adams</b> <b>says</b> that the author of a note, which was left next to Northumberland's body, blamed the earl for Richard's death.|$|E
500|$|The game {{influenced}} Minecraft, which reviewers {{considered a}} more user-friendly version of Dwarf Fortress. <b>Adams</b> <b>says</b> he is {{thankful for the}} Minecraft developers citing his game because that drew more players. Other games inspired by Dwarf Fortress have largely failed to replicate its visual style and depth. Homages to Dwarf Fortress appear in World of Warcraft. In July 2014, the game won a poll conducted by Turtle Beach as the community's most [...] "Beautiful Game"; games were nominated by fans posting videos, images or text, and a list was compiled by the community which also contained , Far Cry 3 and The Last of Us. Justin Ma, one of the developers of , commented on its use of text-based graphics, [...] "Part of the reason Dwarf Fortress can include a breadth of mechanics unseen in other games is because complex mechanics are expressed in the most simple of visual forms." [...] Gaslamp Games cited it as one their main influences for the game Clockwork Empires. In 2015, Rock, Paper, Shotgun ranked Dwarf Fortress 7th on its The 50 Best Free Games On PC list.|$|E
500|$|On his {{reliance}} on PayPal donations, <b>Adams</b> <b>says</b> he is content since {{he feels that}} people really like his work or they would not pay. Adams said that donations remain stable except during a new version update, {{where there is a}} sudden increase. Their expenses being low, he has maintained that he is happy as long as the game is self-sustaining and will not charge for it. In 2011, Adams refused a job offer from an unspecified major game developer and a $300,000 deal to license the name Dwarf Fortress from another company. Adams felt that this amount would not equate to long-term donations and that he prefers working on his own—not being part of the gaming industry. Adams said, [...] "Barely in the black one month, a little in the red another month. ... It's a risk I'm willing to take, and really I couldn't have it any other way." [...] He has spent no money on advertising and was happy when bloggers, reviewers like former game journalist Kieron Gillen from PC Gamer and Games for Windows, wrote about his game. In 2015, Bay 12 Games set up a Patreon account to help fund it.|$|E

50|$|From {{the website}} curledup.com, Wayne <b>Adam</b> <b>says</b> {{the novel is}} one of the best Lincoln Rhyme novels yet, {{describing}} it as a thriller with a rapid-pace, because of the characters Rhyme and Boyd being distinctive and the novel having a lot of plot twists and the ending has several shocking endings.|$|R
500|$|In 1999, Adams {{returned}} to Wildstorm to draw an eight-page flashback sequence in issue #4 of Alan Moore's series, Tom Strong, {{which was published}} under Moore's brand for Wildstorm, America's Best Comics. His subsequent Wildstorm work would include Danger Girl Special #1 (2000) and two issues of The Authority in 2002, significant portions of which Adams was asked by DC Comics to redraw in order to de-emphasize the violence, {{in light of the}} September 11 attacks, much to Adams' frustration. That same year, Adams and writer Steve Moore co-created [...] "Jonni Future", a pastiche of a pulp science fiction series such as Adam Strange and Barbarella, which was published in eight-page installments in the America's Best Comics anthology Tom Strong's Terrific Tales, the first ten issues of which Adams penciled from 2002 to 2004. Adams work on [...] "Jonni Future" [...] has been characterized as exhibiting a romantic influence, with greater amounts realism and fine hatching, which Adams refers to as [...] "noodling". <b>Adams</b> <b>says</b> he was inspired by sources such as Paolo Eleuteri Serpieri, Warren Publishing's Vampirella, and the character designs in Capcom video game character books when he drew [...] "Jonni Future", and refrained from using straight edges or templates in order to achieve a more elegant, hand-drawn appearance. He regards [...] "Jonni Future" [...] as his best work.|$|E
500|$|The main {{themes in}} the album, in Adams words are; [...] "searching for something". The lyrical meaning behind track number four, [...] "Oxygen" [...] is what a person needs in order to survive. In other words, [...] "The person you are with is giving you the air you breathe", and that people in general [...] "need each other 100%." [...] The album's first single, [...] "I Thought I'd Seen Everything" [...] is about keeping an open mind." [...] The theme of [...] "Broken Wings" [...] is about [...] "{{somebody}} who {{taught me how to}} fly", a metaphor which for [...] "putting your trust in somebody who can give you faith and the belief that you can succeed." [...] "Something to Believe In" [...] is based upon the affirmation of life and faith, while [...] "Walk on By" [...] warns the listener of distrustfulness. As with other albums, according to Adams, he likes to end the album with a melancholic song, such as [...] "Something to Believe In" [...] in 11, it's not the last track however. [...] "Flowers Gone Wild" [...] touches on the same theme as two songs he wrote in the early 1980s, [...] "Cover Girl" [...] and [...] "The Best Is Yet To Come", are based upon the murdered playboy bunny Dorothy Stratten. But also people with misplaced emotions and their unfulfilled needs, which are pushed forth by the media, which <b>Adams</b> <b>says,</b> leads people to lose their [...] "sense of decency". Adams explained further; [...] "It's a sort of new love affair with an old story, devouring our celebrities and leaving them when we are done." ...|$|E

5000|$|IGN {{rated the}} game 9.3/10, with {{reviewer}} Dan <b>Adams</b> <b>saying</b> [...] "You {{have to love}} a game that glues you to your seat and keeps you interested... A thrilling piece of software that action fans should grab a hold of and love fiercely." [...] His only negative critique was on the short length of the game, which many reviewers pointed out.|$|R

2500|$|Sleeping Muse I has {{different}} versions as well; one, from 1909–10, {{is made of}} marble and measures 6 ¾ in. in height (Adams 549). This {{is a model of}} a head, without a body, with markings to show features such as hair, nose, lips, and closed eyes. In A History of Western Art, <b>Adams</b> <b>says</b> that the sculpture has [...] "an abstract, curvilinear quality and a smooth contour that create an impression of elegance" [...] (549). The qualities which produce the effect can particularly be seen {{in the shape of the}} eyes and in the set of the mouth.|$|E
2500|$|By {{the time}} Into the Fire was completed, {{there were only}} two songs Adams and Vallance were {{satisfied}} with: the dark [...] "Victim of Love", and the upbeat [...] "Hearts on Fire", which was written during the Reckless recording sessions, two years earlier. A possible influence to the album was Adams' involvement of the six-city [...] "Amnesty International Conspiracy of Hope" [...] tour in 1986. <b>Adams</b> <b>says</b> in the [...] "Into the Fire" [...] songbook that the album's title track refers to a man who is at a crossroads and does not quite {{know what to do with}} his life, which is how Adams felt when he started recording the album after the massive success of Reckless.|$|E
50|$|Thirty {{minutes after}} the food fight, the adults are {{gathering}} themselves.

With his last ounce of strength, <b>Adam</b> <b>says</b> one last word to Cal: [...] "Timshel".|$|R
2500|$|Crediting Andrea Martin {{with her}} broad and {{confident}} initial portrayal of Ishka, Adams commented on {{how easy it}} was to play a character so well delineated. [...] Adams also infused Ishka with some of the stories Shimerman told of his own mother. [...] In an interview with , Adams said of Ishka: [...] "I love and adore her. [...] How can you not? [...] She just doesn't care what anybody thinks; she's so committed to what she thinks is right, and everyone else be damned. [...] But she has a heart of gold, and she's very strong. [...] To be a female as strong as she was, in the kind of world she came from, was wonderful, I think." [...] Lauding the character, <b>Adams</b> <b>says</b> that it's Ishka's backbone that helps her grow as an actress and as a person. [...] Adams has appeared at several Star Trek conventions with her [...] "Ferengi family" [...] and relishes meeting fans who express how much they love the character of Ishka.|$|E

6000|$|His next letter bears on the superscription, [...] "Favored by General Washington." [...] The date is June 20, 1775, {{three days}} after the battle of Bunker Hill, the news of which could not yet have arrived at Philadelphia. But the war, so much dreaded, had begun, on the quiet banks of Concord River; an army of twenty {{thousand}} men was beleaguering Boston; and here was Washington journeying northward to take the command. It seems to place us in a nearer relation with the hero, to find him performing the little courtesy of leaving a letter between friend and friend, and to hold in our hands the very document intrusted to such a messenger. John <b>Adams</b> <b>says</b> simply, [...] "We send you Generals Washington and Lee for your comfort"; but adds nothing in regard to the character of the Commander-in-Chief. This letter displays much of the writer's ardent temperament; if he had been anywhere but in the hall of Congress, it {{would have been in the}} intrenchment before Boston.|$|E
