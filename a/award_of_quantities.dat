40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the <b>award</b> <b>of</b> Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. The aim {{of this research is}} to improve the efficiency of the construction process through the application of electronic data interchange (EDI). This thesis describes the development and application of EDI messages. The messages described are targeted to provide a means for transferring construction specific information during the construction process. The definition of electronic data interchange and its technical issues are first described. The nature of EDI, replacing paper based communication with electronic messages, impacts on the way in which business is conducted, and also has far reaching legal implications due to the reliance of many legal systems on paper documents and signatures. The business and legal implications are therefore discussed in detail. The application of EDI in the construction industry is investigated by means of a literature review. This work is furthered by a longitudinal study of the construction industry's application of EDI, which consisted of two surveys at a five year interval. A model of the information flows within the traditional construction process is developed to assist in the identification of information flows suitable for EDI. A methodology for message development was produced. The methodology was then applied to develop a description data model that could be utilised in the existing bill <b>of</b> <b>quantity</b> and trading cycle messages. The bill <b>of</b> <b>quantity</b> message set was at a stage ready for trial. To determine the issues related to implementation specifically in the construction industry a trial implementation of this message set was undertaken. The official implementation undertaken by EDICON is described. Software was also developed to undertake the trial. This software was tested and proved the message set developed was suitable for the transfer <b>of</b> bill <b>of</b> <b>quantity</b> related information during a construction project. The factors causing the failure of the implementation of the bill <b>of</b> <b>quantities</b> message set are discussed. A number of these factors are considered valid for all construction project information flows. Finally, the use of shared project models to re-engineer construction information tasks is recommended as a means of achieving significant benefit from electronic data exchange in the construction process...|$|R
40|$|The {{principal}} {{objective of this}} paper is to provide a torsor theory <b>of</b> physical <b>quantities</b> and basic operations thereon. Torsors are introduced in a bottom-up fashion as actions of scale transformation groups on spaces <b>of</b> unitized <b>quantities.</b> In contrast, the shortcomings of other accounts <b>of</b> <b>quantities</b> that proceed in a top-down axiomatic manner are also discussed. In this paper, quantities are presented as dual counterparts of physical states. States serve as truth-makers of metrological statements about quantity values and are crucial in specifying alternative measurement units for base quantities. For illustration and ease of presentation, the classical notions of length, time, and instantaneous velocity are used as primordial examples. It is shown how torsors provide an effective description of the structure <b>of</b> <b>quantities,</b> systems <b>of</b> <b>quantities,</b> and transformations between them. Using the torsor framework, time-dependent quantities and their unitized derivatives are also investigated. Lastly, the torsor apparatus is applied to deterministic measurement <b>of</b> <b>quantities...</b>|$|R

40|$|Abstract:- In {{dealing with}} the {{production}} of various products in some industries, many firms need to respond to wide ranges <b>of</b> <b>quantities</b> demanded. High responsiveness to wider ranges <b>of</b> <b>quantities</b> can be a competitive advantage for a firm in modern highly competing environments. To stay ahead of competitors, a firm {{should be able to}} schedule production in an efficient way. The {{purpose of this study is}} to investigate the effects of wide ranges <b>of</b> <b>quantities</b> demanded on the scheduling. The production scheduling problem of knitted fabrics is used to examine the influences. Genetic algorithm (GA) is employed to be the analytical tool. Optimal parameters including mutation rates and crossover rates that generate good performance are obtained experimentally. Results from this paper show that the makespan in wide ranges <b>of</b> <b>quantities</b> is lower than that in a small range. However, the machine utilization in wide ranges <b>of</b> <b>quantities</b> is lower than that in a small range. To schedule the production with a lower makespan and with reasonable machine utilization, one can divide a big customer order into many manufacturing orders with smaller quantities. In addition, the on-time delivery rate can be increased by adding a penalty factor of completion time of a job.
