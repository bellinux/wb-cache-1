Informing Roberts that the casualty toll numbered less than 200, O'Halloran says they were lucky. Roberts agrees to consult with fire officials in the future when such buildings are designed.

25|$|In 1888 was {{produced}} {{the statue of}} Queen Victoria, set up at Winchester, in its main design and {{in the details of}} its ornamentation the most remarkable work of its kind produced in Great Britain, <b>and</b> <b>perhaps,</b> <b>it</b> may be added, in any other country in modern times. In 1892–1893 Gilbert was occupied with the Shaftesbury Memorial Fountain, in Piccadilly Circus, London, a work of great originality and beauty representing Anteros. Other statues are those set up to Lord Reay in Bombay, and John Howard at Bedford (1898). Gilbert rose to the full height of his powers in his memorials to the Duke of Clarence and to Lord Arthur Russell and a memorial font to the son of the 4th Marquess of Bath.|$|E

25|$|Her father, {{as well as}} his {{elder brother}} Timothy, and, still more, a son of the latter, had been {{accustomed}} to write in measured rhyme, their poems sometimes appearing in the local papers; <b>and</b> <b>perhaps</b> <b>it</b> was not strange that Harriett should, as soon as she could hold a pen, make crude attempts in the same direction. She was furnished with a copy book in which she wrote slowly and laboriously; and she soon turned surreptitiously {{to the back of the}} book and werote loose rhymes that were jingling in her brain. On one occasion, the teacher passed by her desk when she was just finishing a rhymed account of some event which had occurred in the school room. Something must have attracted the teacher's attention; for he noticed her book, grabbed it, and, after running it through by himself, with a laugh, he proceeded to read it aloud to the school. When class was over, she scurried home. Thought her father soothed her ruffled mood, her copy-book confidences were discontinued.|$|E
500|$|Despite {{the many}} writers, {{the film has}} what Ebert {{describes}} as a [...] "wonderfully unified and consistent" [...] script. Koch later claimed it was the tension between his own approach and Curtiz's which accounted for this: [...] "Surprisingly, these disparate approaches somehow meshed, <b>and</b> <b>perhaps</b> <b>it</b> was partly this tug of war between Curtiz and me that gave the film a certain balance." [...] Julius Epstein would later note the screenplay contained [...] "more corn than in the states of Kansas and Iowa combined. But when corn works, there's nothing better." ...|$|E

Anthony Glassman of the Gay People's Chronicle was also cautious in his assessment: [...] "The word 'groundbreaking' should be used sparingly, <b>and</b> <b>perhaps</b> <b>it</b> does not apply here.

[...] The segment was met with mixed reception from students at University of Michigan–Dearborn. A number of them were interviewed by Gallagher in his report.

[...] This remark caused great controversy and resulted in Elders losing the support of the White House. [...] White House chief of staff Leon Panetta remarked, [...] "There have been too many areas where the President does not agree with her views. This is just one too many." [...] In December 1994, Elders was forced to resign by President Clinton.

2500|$|The 1986 Charles Band-produced low-budget horror/fantasy film Troll, {{directed}} by John Carl Buechler and starring Noah Hathaway, Julia Louis-Dreyfus and Sonny Bono, features a character named [...] "Harry Potter Jr." [...] In {{an interview with}} M. J. Simpson, Band claimed: [...] "I've heard that J. K. Rowling has acknowledged that maybe she saw this low-budget movie <b>and</b> <b>perhaps</b> <b>it</b> inspired her." [...] However, a spokesman for Rowling, responding to the rumors of a planned remake of the film, has denied that Rowling ever saw it before writing her book. Rowling has said on record multiple times that the name [...] "Harry Potter" [...] was derived in part from a childhood friend, Ian Potter, and in part from her favourite male name, Harry. On 13 April 2008, The Mail on Sunday wrote a news article claiming that Warner Bros. had begun a legal action against Buechler; however, the story was denied and lawyers for Rowling demanded the article be removed.|$|E
2500|$|The {{film was}} previewed to French film {{distributors}} at the Palais Rochechouarton on 25 April 1934. The screening was disastrous and Gaumont {{took control of}} the film. Jean Pascal called the original cut [...] "a confused, incoherent, willfully absurd, long, dull, commercially worthless film." [...] However, Élie Faure said that he was reminded of the painter Jean-Baptiste-Camille Corot and praised [...] "these landscapes of water, trees, little houses on peaceful banks and boats slowly threading their way ahead of a silver wake: the same impeccable composition, the same power invisibly present because so much a master of itself, the same balance of all the elements of a visual drama in the tender embrace of complete acceptance, the same pearly, golden veil translucently masking the sharpness of composition and the firmness of line. <b>And</b> <b>perhaps</b> <b>it</b> was the simplicity of composition, entirely devoid of flourishes or decoration — classical, in a word — that made me appreciate all the more pleasure of savoring the very spirit of Vigo's work, almost violent, certainly tormented, feverish, brimming with ideas and truculent fantasy, with virulent, even demonic and yet constantly human romanticism." ...|$|E

I am one of those who feel that one country has a self-interest in the events of another, and therefore for its own sake it is entitled to watch over them. ... France ought to be watched, not altogether on account of the spirit of universal interference and conquest which she manifests but on account of the weapons she uses...; it is not the red-hot balls of her cannon that are to be dreaded, but the red-hot principles with which she charges them. An invasion from these is what you and I dread, and if we feel that an universal junction is necessary in order to repel them, the foundation of that junction must be founded in exclusion.|$|E
2500|$|Critics of Shakespeare's play Julius Caesar differ greatly {{on their}} views of Caesar and Brutus. Many have debated whether Caesar or Brutus is the protagonist of the play, because of the title character's death in Act Three, Scene One. But Caesar compares himself to the Northern Star, <b>and</b> <b>perhaps</b> <b>it</b> would be foolish not to {{consider}} him as the axial character of the play, around whom the entire story turns. Intertwined in this debate is a smattering of philosophical and psychological ideologies on republicanism and monarchism. One author, Robert C. Reynolds, devotes attention to the names or epithets given to both Brutus and Caesar in his essay [...] "Ironic Epithet in Julius Caesar". This author points out that Casca praises Brutus at face value, but then inadvertently compares him to a disreputable joke of a man by calling him an alchemist, [...] "Oh, he sits high in all the people's hearts,/And that which would appear offence in us/ His countenance, like richest alchemy,/ Will change to virtue and to worthiness" [...] (I.iii.158-60). Reynolds also talks about Caesar and his [...] "Colossus" [...] epithet, which he points out has its obvious connotations of power and manliness, but also lesser known connotations of an outward glorious front and inward chaos.|$|E
2500|$|Hillforts {{are known}} {{throughout}} western Europe but Irish hillforts {{were not as}} well developed and never attained the standard of the so-called Celtic Oppida of Continental Europe and Britain. [...] They vary in size but are of a communal rather than single-family residence. Cashels (stone built ringforts) tend to be much smaller than earthen examples. The average earthen ringfort has an internal diameter of 22 metres in south Donegal; cashels {{in the same area}} have an average internal diameter of 20 metres. [...] The Grianán of Aileach, with an average internal diameter of 23.4 metres is larger than the latter and therefore this must be an indication of the wealth and importance of its inhabitants <b>and</b> <b>perhaps</b> <b>it</b> is also an indication of the size of its occupant population. Lacy suggests that the innovative nature of the stone fort of Aileach must have been an unusual site when it was first constructed. [...] The names Garvan, Frigru/ Rigriu are found in many Irish authorities to be the names of the builders of Aileach. [...] These characters are linked to the Formorians and therefore may be nothing more than mythological creations. Lacy believes that the builder may have been Áed Oirdnide, the victor at the battle of Cloíteach.|$|E

2500|$|Porter then {{shifted his}} speech {{to the topic of}} large {{corporations}} and monopolies. He addressed the convention by stating that the state of Pennsylvania, and businessmen in general, should be careful to guard against the dangers of the intentions of monopolies, and large businesses. He stated that, [...] "it may be wise and salutary, <b>and</b> <b>perhaps</b> <b>it</b> may essentially aid us in arriving at sound and correct conclusions, to inquire into the origin, progress, uses and tendencies of corporations." [...] Stating that a corporation is no more than an artificial being, Porter expressed his idea that a corporation's intentions should be nothing more than what its charter defines. Porter then outlined several examples of how corporations in early Italy sought nothing but to grow in size, even at the expense of smaller businesses, and how these corporations eventually gained more power in national affairs than was appropriate. Porter believed in the rights of the individual citizen, as opposed to the rights of the larger corporations. Towards the end of his speech, Porter stated that the convention should mark his words that, [...] "If ever our republic fails, it will be by the destruction of the confidence of our citizens in the security of their individual rights." ...|$|E
2500|$|A re-evaluation of Dee's {{character}} and significance {{came in the}} 20th century, {{largely as a result}} of the work of the historians Charlotte Fell-Smith and Dame Frances Yates. Both writers brought into focus the parallel roles magic, science and religion held in the Elizabethan Renaissance. Fell-Smith writes: [...] "There is perhaps no learned author in history who has been so persistently misjudged, nay, even slandered, by his posterity, and not a voice in all the three centuries uplifted even to claim for him a fair hearing. Surely it is time that the cause of all this universal condemnation should be examined in the light of reason and science; <b>and</b> <b>perhaps</b> <b>it</b> will be found to exist mainly in the fact that he was too far advanced in speculative thought for his own age to understand." [...] As a result of this and subsequent re-evaluation, Dee is now viewed as a serious scholar and book-collector, a devoted Christian (albeit during a very confusing time for that faith), an able scientist, and one of the most learned men of his day. His personal library at Mortlake was the largest in the country (before it was vandalized), and was created at enormous and sometimes ruinous personal expense; it was considered one of the finest in Europe, perhaps second only to that of De Thou. As well as being an astrological and scientific advisor to Elizabeth and her court, he was an early advocate of the colonisation of North America and a visionary of a British Empire stretching across the North Atlantic.|$|E
