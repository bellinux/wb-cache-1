5|$|Ernuszt's {{accounts}} of his activity as royal treasurer have been preserved. The accounts cover {{the period between}} 1 February 1494 and 31 December 1495. The document is {{an important source of}} demographic, economic, and cultural research of late medieval Hungary. The accounts contain a detailed record of the one-florin tax <b>assessed</b> <b>in</b> Hungary proper, Transylvania and Slavonia in 1494 and 1495 which was to be paid by each peasant household. They do not contain data for the fourteen southern counties in Hungary proper, because the ispán (or head) of Temes County, who was responsible for the defence of the southern border, was entitled to spend the royal income from the one-florin tax <b>assessed</b> <b>in</b> this region. The peasants in southern Slavonia were also exempt from the one-florin tax because of the frequent Ottoman raids in this region.|$|E

5|$|The fossil has {{a number}} of {{features}} that suggest a relation to a group of oryzomyine rodents that includes the South American marsh rat Holochilus, its living relatives Lundomys and Pseudoryzomys, and the extinct Noronhomys and Holochilus primigenus. They share high-crowned (hypsodont) molars and several simplifications of molar morphology, as well as other features that cannot be <b>assessed</b> <b>in</b> Carletonomys, which indicate specializations towards a semiaquatic lifestyle. It shows the most similarity to Noronhomys and Holochilus, so much so that Pardiñas considered placing it in either of these two genera, but its distinctive morphological features justify placement in a separate genus.|$|E

5|$|Colts are <b>assessed</b> <b>in</b> their two-year-old {{year by the}} New Forest Pony Breeding and Cattle Society for {{suitability}} to be kept as stallions; {{any animal}} failing the assessment must be gelded. Once approved, every spring (usually in March), the stallions must pass the Verderers' assessment before they are permitted onto the Forest to breed. The stallion scheme resulted in a reduction of genetic diversity in the ponies running out on the New Forest, and to counteract this and preserve the hardiness of Forest-run ponies, the Verderers introduced the Bloodline Diversity Project, which will use hardy Forest-run mares, mostly over eleven years old, bred to stallions {{that have not been}} run out on the Forest, or closely related to those that have.|$|E
5|$|Mining {{has been}} done in the Solomon Creek {{watershed}} in the past, causing considerable environmental damage. The mining began {{in the beginning of the}} 1800s and continued until the 1970s. However, there was one strip mining permit in the watershed in the late 1990s. Starting in 1967, the mine pools under the creek stopped having water pumped out of them. This led to them flooding and damaging buildings in the watershed in 1972 during Hurricane Agnes. To remedy the problem of the flooding, the Buttonwood Tunnel and three boreholes known as the South Wilkes-Barre Boreholes were created. The water quality of the creek was <b>assessed</b> <b>in</b> 1970 as part of Operation Scarlift. A 1977 study by the Pennsylvania Fish and Boat Commission observed brook trout inhabiting the watershed, although the stream was listed as impaired on account of the mining. A plan called the Solomon Creek Cold Water Conservation Plan was initiated in the summer of 2011 and continued into 2012.|$|E
5|$|This film {{marks the}} second {{adaptation}} of Shūsaku Endō's novel, which was previously adapted by Masahiro Shinoda into the 1971 {{film of the}} same name. Scorsese penned the initial screenplay in 1991 with co-writer and longtime collaborator Jay Cocks. However, they were unsatisfied with the script and conducted rewrites for an additional 15 years. Later, Endō's official translator, Van C. Gessel, who has translated eight of his novels, assisted as a consultant on the film. The screenplay as finally filmed was <b>assessed</b> <b>in</b> critical review as an accurate depiction of the novel as written by Endo. Religious historian Haruko Nawata Ward has indicated that {{the inclusion of the}} small crucifix in the deceased priest's hand {{at the end of the}} film was an auteur decision made by Scorsese not included in Endo's original book.|$|E

The Germans had laid mines in the canal earlier. Clearing the mines and the ships sunk by them was a slow process and Illustrious did not reach Suez Bay until 20 March. The ship then sailed for Durban, South Africa, to have the extent of her underwater damage <b>assessed</b> <b>in</b> the drydock there. She reached Durban on 4 April and remained there for two weeks.

3000|$|Based on the second-order CFA, {{the figure}} above reveals how LAK {{explains}} its constructs (assessing reading, assessing listening, assessing writing, <b>assessing</b> speaking) <b>in</b> {{terms of their}} variance. Firstly, standardized path coefficients were reported as [...]. 98 for assessing listening, [...]. 99 for assessing reading, [...]. 89 for assessing writing, and [...]. 98 for assessing speaking. That means, one standard deviation change in LAK (1.000) would lead to 0.994 standard deviation change <b>in</b> <b>assessing</b> reading, [...]. 986 standard deviation change <b>in</b> <b>assessing</b> listening, [...]. 891 standard deviation change <b>in</b> <b>assessing</b> writing, and [...]. 981 standard deviation change <b>in</b> <b>assessing</b> speaking, {{all of which are}} good indicators of variance explanation. In addition to this, the error variance values were found as [...]. 027 for assessing listening, [...]. 013 for assessing reading, [...]. 206 for assessing writing, and [...]. 038 for <b>assessing</b> speaking. <b>In</b> other words, these values mean that LAK explains 97 % variance of assessing listening, 98 % variance of assessing reading, 80 % variance of assessing writing, and almost 96 % variance of <b>assessing</b> speaking. <b>In</b> short, as all these values suggest, the model presents a perfect model-data fit in terms of explaining LAK and its constructs.|$|R
