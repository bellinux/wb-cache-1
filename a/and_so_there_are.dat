These tools use a textual description for use cases and several other tools (such as CBehave) have followed suit. However, this format is not required <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> other tools that use other formats as well. For example, Fitnesse (which is built around decision tables), has also been used to roll out BDD.|$|E

25|$|Popper {{regarded}} {{theories that}} have survived criticism as better corroborated {{in proportion to}} the amount and stringency of the criticism, but, {{in sharp contrast to the}} inductivist theories of knowledge, emphatically as less likely to be true. Popper held that seeking for theories with a high probability of being true was a false goal that is in conflict with the search for knowledge. Science should seek for theories that are most probably false on the one hand (which is the same as saying that they are highly falsifiable <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> lots of ways that they could turn out to be wrong), but still all actual attempts to falsify them have failed so far (that they are highly corroborated).|$|E
25|$|A Fistful of Dollars {{became the}} first film to exhibit Leone's famously {{distinctive}} style of visual direction. This was influenced by both John Ford's cinematic landscaping and the Japanese method of direction perfected by Akira Kurosawa. Leone wanted an operatic feel to his western, <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> many examples of extreme close-ups {{on the faces of}} different characters, functioning like arias in a traditional opera. The rhythm, emotion, and communication within scenes can be attributed to Leoneâ€™s meticulous framing of his close-ups. This is quite different from Hollywood's use of close-ups that used them as reaction shots, usually to a line of dialogue that had just been spoken. Leone's close-ups are more akin to portraits, often lit with Renaissance-type lighting effects, and are considered by some as pieces of design in their own right.|$|E
2500|$|Indian Cricket was a cricket {{yearbook}} {{published by}} The Hindu from 194647 to 2004. [...] There was no 2003 issue <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> 57 editions in all.

2500|$|Another {{advantage}} of re-amping {{is that it}} enables producers and band members to have more options for remixing and redoing a recording {{a long time after}} the original recording. If the original recording of a song with electric guitar is done in 1985, and the electric guitarist's sound was only recorded with a mic in front of her/his combo amp or speaker cabinet, the recording will lock in the specific type of distortion, reverb, flanger processing and other effects that were used, which might sound [...] "dated" [...] several decades later. A producer who is tasked with doing a remix of this song 30 years later cannot [...] "undo" [...] or remove the distortion, reverb, chorus or flanger effects, <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> limited options for remixing the guitar sound. On the other hand, if the engineering and production team in 1985 had simultaneously tracked (recorded) a [...] "dry", DI out signal from the electric guitar's pickups, a producer remixing the song 30 years later could take the dry guitar signal and re-amp it through 2000s-era digital effects and speaker systems, giving a new sound to this 1985 track.|$|E
2500|$|There are {{a number}} of columns {{supporting}} the structure. As the ground level rises from the shore {{to the level of the}} Yerba Buena Tunnel, the height of the above ground portion of the columns varies. Since the rock structure supporting these is a hard shale, it would be normal under previous engineering methods to simply dig a relatively shallow foundation for each column, with the structural length varying progressively. Modern seismic analysis and computer simulations revealed the problem with such a design; while the long columns could flex several feet at the top (0.6 meter, more or less), the shorter columns were likely to break, since the rigid deck structures cause the imposition of a similar amount of motion at the tops of the columns, imposing more bending stress per unit length on the shorter columns. This problem was solved by making the columns of similar (but not uniform) length, with the [...] "shorter" [...] columns extending in permanent open shafts to deep foundations. This allows all columns of the YBITS to respond in a sufficiently uniform manner. The space between a column and its pit is covered by a protective sacrificial cover, forming a type of base isolation system at the more sensitive column locations. In addition, the western landing of the YBITS is a zero moment hinge, <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> no vertical bending stresses at that point.|$|E
2500|$|Drawbacks of {{hydrogen}} peroxide include material compatibility, a lower capability for penetration and operator health risks. Products containing cellulose, such as paper, cannot be sterilized using VHP and products containing nylon may become brittle. [...] The penetrating ability {{of hydrogen}} peroxide {{is not as}} good as ethylene oxide <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> limitations on the length and diameter of lumens that can be effectively sterilized and guidance is available from the sterilizer manufacturers. Hydrogen peroxide is primary irritant and the contact of the liquid solution with skin will cause bleaching or ulceration depending on the concentration and contact time. It is relatively non-toxic when diluted to low concentrations, but is a dangerous oxidizer at high concentrations (> 10% w/w). The vapour is also hazardous, primarily affecting the eyes and respiratory system. Even short term exposures can be hazardous and NIOSH has set the Immediately Dangerous to Life and Health Level (IDLH) at 75 ppm, less than one tenth the IDLH for ethylene oxide (800 ppm). Prolonged exposure to lower concentrations can cause permanent lung damage and consequently, OSHA has set the permissible exposure limit to 1.0 ppm, calculated as an 8-hour time weighted average. Sterilizer manufacturers {{go to great lengths to}} make their products safe through careful design and incorporation of many safety features, though there are still workplace exposures of hydrogen peroxide from gas sterilizers are documented in the FDA MAUDE database. When using any type of gas sterilizer, prudent work practices will include good ventilation, a continuous gas monitor for hydrogen peroxide and good work practices and training.|$|E
