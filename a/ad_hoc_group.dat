The sheep was killed and the car written off, and in the aftermath of this event the informal race became known as the Mutton Grand Prix.|$|E

25|$|The Białystok pocket fell on 1 July {{and the two}} Panzer Armies {{pushed on}} towards another pocket, west of Minsk. Luftflotte 2 {{supported}} the armoured columns in relays and helped encircle four more Soviet armies near the city. Fliegerkorps VIII provided considerable support, as it was equipped for the task. Bruno Loerzer's Fliegerkorps II was not achieving as much success, supporting Heinz Guderian's Second Panzer Army south of Minsk. Logistics were stretched and Loerzer could not direct their bomber and long-range reconnaissance units which were further to the rear. The Panzers had outrun its air support. However, to ensure seamless cooperation from close support aircraft based within 100km from the front, Major General Martin Fiebig, {{chief of staff for}} Fliegerkorps VIII, was established as Close Support Leader II (Nahkampfführer II). It was an <b>ad</b> <b>hoc</b> <b>group,</b> which allowed Fiebig to take command of Fliegerkorps II's close support units, SKG 210 and JG 51, supporting the Second Panzer Army. Guderian, though not always in agreement with Feibig's methods, was grateful for the quality of air support. The German army became spoiled with the level of air support, and wanted air power to support operations everywhere. Personalities such as von Richthofen maintained that the Luftwaffe should be held back, and used in concentration for operational, not tactical effect. In the event, Feibig had been operating without radios for the most part, and friendly-fire incidents were avoided by the use of signal panels and flags. In operational terms, the Luftwaffe, and in particular Richthofen, had performed very well. Using the Flivos, forward radio liaison officers, the mechanised divisions could summon air support very quickly, usually after a two-hour wait.|$|E
500|$|Attached to New Guinea Force, {{the company}} was {{conceived}} by Major Donald Small, Chief Signals Officer of the 8th Military District, who, having experienced the Japanese air raids on Rabaul, observed {{that the lack of}} an effective early-warning system around New Britain had resulted in the defenders being caught by surprise when attacked. By employing volunteers from Army units stationed in the area, he planned a network of observation posts, each equipped with a wireless transmitter to screen Port Moresby around a [...] radius, providing early warning of air raids, in addition to data on their size, height and strength. The decision of the territory administration to withdraw the civilian wireless operators following the entry of Japan into the war had also left holes in the coastwatching network, reducing its effectiveness. In the nine days following the fall of Rabaul, hasty arrangements were made by Small to assemble an <b>ad</b> <b>hoc</b> <b>group</b> of volunteer infantrymen with only a little signals training using civilian wireless equipment for deployment to the north coast with the assistance of two Short Sunderland flying boats from the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF).|$|E

In 1988, an <b>ad</b> <b>hoc</b> <b>group</b> of African-American scholars—most from within the Smithsonian, but some from other museums as well—began debating what an African-American history museum might look like. While the group discussed the issue informally, Smithsonian Secretary Robert McCormick Adams, Jr. publicly suggested in October 1989 that [...] "just a wing" [...] of the National Museum of American History should be devoted to black culture, a pronouncement that generated extensive controversy.

2500|$|The {{transformation}} {{of the church and}} the publicity which came from the broadcasting of the plays was not the liking of a group of parishioners including Anna Maria King (their leader) and Poynter Adams. They applied to the consistory court for the removal of some items of church furnishing. The court's judgement ordered the removal of some of the items and the discontinuing of some of the customs and ceremonies about which complaints had been made. However Walke felt unable to recognise the right of such a court to determine matters spiritual since appeals could be made to a secular court so ignored the judgement. Reacting to this a large group of extreme Protestant agitators broke into the church on 8 August 1932, and removed or destroyed many of the fittings and furnishings. The damage was caused by an <b>ad</b> <b>hoc</b> <b>group</b> of Protestants from Plymouth and elsewhere including Anna Maria King and John Kensit (a Protestant propagandist from London).

Use rose again after passage of the Montana Stream Access Law in 1985, which legally opened all navigable rivers and streams in Montana to recreation. In reaction, local landowner Louise Rankin Galt closed the popular Indian Springs boat camp after concluding that floaters would begin to treat her property as public land.|$|E
