25|$|In {{order to}} {{understand}} the Greek New Comedy of Menander and its similarities to Plautus, it is necessary to discuss, in juxtaposition with it, the days of Greek Old Comedy and its evolution into New Comedy. The ancient Greek playwright who best embodies Old Comedy is Aristophanes. A playwright of 5th century Athens, he wrote works of political satire such as The Wasps, The Birds, <b>and</b> <b>The</b> <b>Clouds.</b> Aristophanes' work is noted for its critical commentary on politics and societal values, which is the key component of Old Comedy: consciousness {{of the world in which}} it is written, and analysis of this world. Comedy and theater were means for the political commentary of the time—the public conscience.|$|E

The work's lighting has been described as [...] "Caravaggesque", after the Italian artist closely associated with tenebrism—the use of violent contrast between light and dark. Even Géricault's treatment of the sea is muted, being rendered in dark greens rather than the deep blues that could have afforded contrast with the tones of the raft and its figures. From the distant area of the rescue ship, a bright light shines, providing illumination to an otherwise dull brown scene.|$|E

2500|$|Ancient cloud {{studies were}} not made in isolation, but were {{observed}} {{in combination with other}} weather elements and even other natural sciences. In about 340 BC the Greek philosopher Aristotle wrote Meteorologica, a work which represented the sum of knowledge of the time about natural science, including weather and climate. For the first time, precipitation <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>clouds</b> from which precipitation fell were called meteors, which originate from the Greek word meteoros, meaning 'high in the sky'. From that word came the modern term meteorology, the study of clouds and weather. Meteorologica was based on intuition and simple observation, but not on what is now considered the scientific method. [...] Nevertheless, it was the first known work that attempted to treat a broad range of meteorological topics.|$|E

2500|$|The {{multiple}} series Stieglitz called Equivalents combined {{two very}} {{important aspects of}} his photography: the technical and the aesthetic. He was a master at both, but with Equivalents he succeeded in bringing his skills to a new level. On the technical side, Stieglitz had been fascinated by the special problems of photographing clouds ever since the summer of 1887, when he took his first pictures of clouds over Lake Como in Italy. Until the 1920s most photographic emulsions were orthochromatic, which meant they were primarily sensitive to light on the blue end of the spectrum. This made photographing clouds particularly difficult because unless special filters were used the sky would appear very light <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>clouds</b> would be lost against it. Over the years Stieglitz repeatedly took photographs of clouds using orthochromatic emulsions, but he reported [...] "Every time I developed [...] I was so wrought up, always believing I had nearly gotten what I was after – but had failed." ...|$|E

2500|$|In 1935 {{two young}} German climbers from Bavaria, Karl Mehringer and Max Sedlmeyer, arrived at Grindelwald {{to attempt to}} climb the face. They {{waited a long time}} for good weather and when the clouds finally cleared they started. The two climbers reached the height of the Eigerwand station and made their first bivouac. On the {{following}} day, because of the greater difficulties, they gained little height. On the third day they made hardly any vertical ground. That night a storm broke and the mountain was hidden in fog, and then it began to snow. Avalanches of snow began to sweep the face <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>clouds</b> closed over it. Two days later, there was a short moment when the clouds cleared and the mountain was visible for a while. The two men were glimpsed, now a little higher and about to bivouac for the fifth time. Then the fog came down again and hid the climbers. A few days later the weather finally cleared, revealing a completely white north face. The two climbers were found later frozen to death at 3,300 m, at a place now known as [...] "Death Bivouac".|$|E

[...] The cycles of life are reflected in the land left by harvested wheat and the growing wheat subject to the forces of the wind, as we are subject to the pressures in our lives. [...] The cycle of life depicted here is both tragic and comforting. [...] The stubble of the harvested wheat reflect the inevitable cycle of death, while the stalks of wheat, flying bird and windswept clouds reflect continual change. [...] Edge of a Wheat Field with Poppies, shown below in black and white, was also painted in 1887.|$|E
2500|$|Rabbi Yosé {{the son of}} Rabbi Judah {{said that}} {{after the death of}} Moses (reported in [...] and [...] ), the pillar of cloud, the manna, and the well ceased.

On their account, Providence gave the Israelites three gifts: the pillar of cloud of the Divine Glory, manna, and the well that followed them throughout their sojourns. Providence provided the well through the merit of Miriam, the pillar of cloud through the merit of Aaron, and the manna through the merit of Moses. When Miriam died, the well ceased, but it came back through the merit of Moses and Aaron. When Aaron died, the pillar of cloud ceased, but both of them came back through the merit of Moses. When Moses died, all three of them came to an end and never came back, as [...] says, [...] "In one month, I destroyed the three shepherds." [...] Similarly, Rabbi Simon taught that wherever it says, [...] "And it came to pass after," [...] the world relapsed into its former state.
