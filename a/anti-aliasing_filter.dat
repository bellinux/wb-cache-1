25|$|Aliasing. Some {{amount of}} {{aliasing}} is inevitable because only theoretical, infinitely long, functions {{can have no}} frequency content above the Nyquist frequency. Aliasing can be made arbitrarily small by using a sufficiently large order of the <b>anti-aliasing</b> <b>filter.</b>|$|E
25|$|For {{a digital}} oscilloscope, {{a rule of}} thumb is that the {{continuous}} sampling rate should be ten times the highest frequency desired to resolve; for example a 20megasample/second rate would be applicable for measuring signals up to about 2megahertz. This allows the <b>anti-aliasing</b> <b>filter</b> to be designed with a 3dB down point of 2MHz and an effective cutoff at 10MHz (the Nyquist frequency), avoiding the artifacts of a very steep ("brick-wall") filter.|$|E
25|$|In analog instruments, the {{bandwidth}} of the oscilloscope {{is limited}} by the vertical amplifiers and the CRT or other display subsystem. In digital instruments, the sampling rate of the analog to digital converter (ADC) is a factor, but the stated analog bandwidth (and therefore the overall bandwidth of the instrument) is usually less than the ADC's Nyquist frequency. This is due to limitations in the analog signal amplifier, deliberate design of the <b>Anti-aliasing</b> <b>filter</b> that precedes the ADC, or both.|$|E

40|$|Graduation date: 2009 Analog-to-digital {{converters}} (ADCs) convert analog continuous {{time signals}} into discrete time, digital format. One precondition {{that must be}} met for conventional nyquist rate ADCs is that the input signal must be suitably band-limited to an input bandwidth less than the nyquist frequency. This mandates expensive <b>anti-alias</b> <b>filters</b> which contribute to system noise and distortion degradation. By choosing an OSR of 2 and adopting simple linear phase filtering techniques, significant inherent <b>anti-alias</b> <b>filtering</b> is achieved, avoiding {{the need for an}} explicit <b>anti-alias</b> <b>filter</b> in many applications. Additionally the proposed continuous time input pipeline ADC eases a number of other challenges present in conventional switched capacitor ADCs:- sampled opamp noise folding, sampling distortion, reduced ADC area, switched-capacitor pipeline ADC input loading. Chapter 2 introduces the first continuous time input pipeline ADC in the literature. This ADC, while providing significant benefits, does not provide the inherent filtering. Chapter 3 presents the first continuous time input pipeline ADC with inherent <b>anti-alias</b> <b>filtering...</b>|$|R
25|$|Aliasing is {{generally}} avoided by applying low pass filters- <b>anti-aliasing</b> <b>filters</b> to the analog signal before sampling.|$|R
25|$|Because demosaicing is not {{required}} for the Foveon X3 sensor to produce a full-color image, the color artifacts ("colored jaggies") associated with that process are not seen. The separate <b>anti-aliasing</b> <b>filter</b> commonly used to mitigate those artifacts in a Bayer sensor is {{not required}}. This is because little aliasing occurs when the photodiodes for each color, {{with the assistance of}} the microlenses, integrate the optical image over a region almost as big as the spacing of sensors for that color.|$|E
25|$|Temporal {{aliasing}} is a {{major concern}} in the sampling of video and audio signals. Music, for instance, may contain high-frequency components that are inaudible to humans. If a piece of music is sampled at 32000 samples per second (Hz), any frequency components above 16000 Hz (the Nyquist frequency for this sampling rate) will cause aliasing when the music is reproduced by a digital to analog converter (DAC). To prevent this, an <b>anti-aliasing</b> <b>filter</b> is used to remove components above the Nyquist frequency prior to sampling.|$|E
25|$|As depicted, {{copies of}} X(f) are shifted by {{multiples}} of fs and combined by addition. For a band-limited function nbsp&(X(f) = 0 for all |f| ≥ B),nbsp& and sufficiently large fs, {{it is possible}} for the copies to remain distinct from each other. But if the Nyquist criterion is not satisfied, adjacent copies overlap, and it is not possible in general to discern an unambiguous X(f). Any frequency component above fs/2 is indistinguishable from a lower-frequency component, called an alias, associated with one of the copies. In such cases, the customary interpolation techniques produce the alias, rather than the original component. When the sample-rate is pre-determined by other considerations (such as an industry standard), x(t) is usually filtered to reduce its high frequencies to acceptable levels before it is sampled. The type of filter required is a lowpass filter, and in this application it is called an <b>anti-aliasing</b> <b>filter.</b>|$|E

25|$|The {{application}} of the sampling theorem to images should be made with care. For example, the sampling process in any standard image sensor (CCD or CMOS camera) is relatively far from the ideal sampling which would measure the image intensity at a single point. Instead these devices have a relatively large sensor area at each sample point {{in order to obtain}} sufficient amount of light. In other words, any detector has a finite-width point spread function. The analog optical image intensity function which is sampled by the sensor device is not in general bandlimited, and the non-ideal sampling is itself a useful type of low-pass filter, though not always sufficient to remove enough high frequencies to sufficiently reduce aliasing. When the area of the sampling spot (the size of the pixel sensor) is not large enough to provide sufficient spatial anti-aliasing, a separate <b>anti-aliasing</b> <b>filter</b> (optical low-pass filter) is typically included in a camera system to further blur the optical image. Despite images having these problems in relation to the sampling theorem, the theorem can be used to describe the basics of down and up sampling of images.|$|E
500|$|The {{game was}} first {{released}} in Japan on March 10, 1995, then in North America on May 11, 1995 and in Europe on August 30, 1995, on the Sega Saturn console. The next year, Panzer Dragoon was ported on PC. Identical to the Saturn version except {{with a higher}} resolution, this PC port was also included as an unlockable bonus in the Xbox game Panzer Dragoon Orta, released in 2002. Aside from providing the source code, Team Andromeda had no involvement {{in the development of}} the PC version. The PlayStation 2 console saw the release of an updated version of the game in 2006 in Japan, as part of the Sega Ages 2500 collection.

2500|$|Most sampled {{signals are}} not simply stored and reconstructed. [...] But the {{fidelity}} of a theoretical reconstruction is a customary measure {{of the effectiveness of}} sampling. [...] That fidelity is reduced when s(t) contains frequency components whose periodicity is smaller than two samples; or equivalently the ratio of cycles to samples exceeds ½ (see Aliasing). [...] The quantity ½cycles/sample×fssamples/sec = fs/2 cycles/sec (hertz) is known as the Nyquist frequency of the sampler. [...] Therefore, s(t) is usually the output of a lowpass filter, functionally known as an <b>anti-aliasing</b> <b>filter.</b> [...] Without an <b>anti-aliasing</b> <b>filter,</b> frequencies higher than the Nyquist frequency will influence the samples {{in a way that is}} misinterpreted by the interpolation process.|$|E
5000|$|The upper {{frequency}} limit of a NICAM sound channel is 15 kHz due to <b>anti-aliasing</b> <b>filters</b> at the encoder.|$|R
50|$|Unlike {{digital audio}} systems, analog systems {{do not require}} filters for bandlimiting. These filters act to prevent {{aliasing}} distortions in digital equipment. Early digital systems may have suffered {{from a number of}} signal degradations related to the use of analog <b>anti-aliasing</b> <b>filters,</b> e.g., time dispersion, nonlinear distortion, temperature dependence of filters etc. Even with sophisticated <b>anti-aliasing</b> <b>filters</b> used in the recorder, it is still demanding for the player not to introduce more distortion.|$|R
5000|$|Note {{that these}} filters {{are subject to}} {{aliasing}} phenomena just like a digital <b>filter,</b> and <b>anti-aliasing</b> <b>filters</b> will usually be required. See: Filter design ...|$|R
2500|$|Therefore, in theory, it is {{possible}} for a Foveon X3 sensor with the same number of photodiodes as a Bayer sensor and no separate <b>anti-aliasing</b> <b>filter</b> to attain a higher spatial resolution than that Bayer sensor. Independent tests indicate that the [...] "10.2 MP" [...] array of the Foveon X3 sensor (in the Sigma SD10) has a resolution similar to a 5 MP ...|$|E
2500|$|Subsequent X3-equipped cameras {{have less}} {{aliasing}} because they include microlenses, which provide an effective <b>anti-aliasing</b> <b>filter</b> by averaging the optical signal over an area {{commensurate with the}} sample density, which is not possible in any color channel of a Bayer-type sensor. [...] Aliasing from the Foveon X3 sensor is [...] "far less bothersome because it's monochrome" [...] according to Norman Koren.|$|E
2500|$|When the {{condition}} [...] is {{met for the}} highest frequency component of the original signal, then it is met for all the frequency components, a condition called the Nyquist criterion. That is typically approximated by filtering the original signal to attenuate high frequency components before it is sampled. These attenuated high frequency components still generate low-frequency aliases, but typically at low enough amplitudes {{that they do not}} cause problems. A filter chosen in anticipation of a certain sample frequency is called an <b>anti-aliasing</b> <b>filter.</b>|$|E
50|$|Cameras {{that use}} a beam-splitter single-shot 3CCD approach, three-filter {{multi-shot}} approach, color co-site sampling or Foveon X3 sensor {{do not use}} <b>anti-aliasing</b> <b>filters,</b> nor demosaicing.|$|R
40|$|A {{systematic}} {{evaluation procedure}} is presented {{and applied to}} generate optimal <b>anti-aliasing</b> <b>filters.</b> It is based on multi criteria ∞ optimization, where sampled-data measures are introduced to capture the intersample behavior. The optimization scheme is based on linear matrix inequalities (LMIs) formulated in the delta operator, {{and the result is}} a low order controller of PID type. Both low frequency performance, mid frequency stability margins and high frequency control activity are taken into account. A detailed investigation shows that a new simple rule for design of <b>anti-aliasing</b> <b>filters</b> gives nearly optimal closed loop performance for a number of representative plant models...|$|R
50|$|Analog signals {{entered the}} DTR through {{standard}} XLR connectors {{at the rear}} of the unit. There, a differential input amplifier routed the signal through the front panel attenuation fader to the input low-pass (<b>anti-alias)</b> <b>filter.</b>|$|R
2500|$|Each {{electrode}} {{is connected}} to one input of a differential amplifier (one amplifier per pair of electrodes); a common system reference electrode {{is connected to}} the other input of each differential amplifier. These amplifiers amplify the voltage between the active electrode and the reference (typically 1,000–100,000 times, or 60–100 dB of voltage gain). In analog EEG, the signal is then filtered (next paragraph), and the EEG signal is output as the deflection of pens as paper passes underneath. Most EEG systems these days, however, are digital, and the amplified signal is digitized via an analog-to-digital converter, after being passed through an <b>anti-aliasing</b> <b>filter.</b> [...] Analog-to-digital sampling typically occurs at 256–512Hz in clinical scalp EEG; sampling rates of up to 20kHz are used in some research applications.|$|E
2500|$|However, {{the actual}} {{resolution}} {{produced by the}} Bayer sensor {{is more complicated than}} the count of its photosites, or its native file size, might suggest. [...] The reason has to do with both the demosaicing and the separate <b>anti-aliasing</b> <b>filter</b> commonly used to reduce the occurrence or severity of color moiré patterns that the mosaic characteristic of the Bayer sensor produces. [...] The effect of this filter is to blur the image output of the sensor, thus producing a lower resolution than the photosite count would seem to imply. This filter is largely unnecessary with the Foveon X3 sensor and is not used. [...] The earliest camera with a Foveon X3 sensor, the Sigma SD9, showed visible luminance moiré patterns, but not color moiré.|$|E

50|$|It is very {{important}} to avoid input signal overload when using an <b>anti-aliasing</b> <b>filter.</b> If the signal is strong enough, it can cause clipping at the analog-to-digital converter, even after filtering.
