He was convicted on three counts of assault, and fined 20s plus costs on each count.

500|$|Theta Delta Chi ("Theta Delt, TDX") {{was founded}} at Dartmouth College in 1869 as the Omicron Deuteron {{chapter of the}} {{national}} fraternity, and was the eighth fraternity founded at Dartmouth. [...] Theta Delta Chi was the scene of a famous murder in June, 1920. [...] Henry Maroney, class of 1920, was shot to death in his room at Theta Delta Chi by Robert Meads, class of 1919. [...] Meads was reportedly the central figure in a large-scale bootlegging operation at the college {{during the early years of}} Prohibition. [...] An already intoxicated Maroney reportedly stole <b>a</b> <b>quart</b> <b>of</b> Canadian whisky from Meads. [...] Later that same night, Meads found Maroney in his room at the fraternity and shot him through the heart. [...] Meads was convicted of a lesser charge of manslaughter and given a sentence of 15 to 20 years hard labor. [...] The sensational murder is reportedly the source of the nickname given to the Theta Delta Chi residence: the [...] "Boom Boom Lodge". [...] Theta Delta Chi has several distinguished alumni, including Robert Frost, who attended Dartmouth for a time in 1892.|$|E
500|$|Another form of wife selling was by deed of conveyance. Although {{initially}} {{much less}} common than sale by auction, the practice became more widespread after the 1850s, as popular opinion {{turned against the}} market sale of a wife. The issue of the commonly perceived legitimacy of wife selling was also brought to the government. In 1881, Home Secretary William Harcourt was asked to comment on an incident in Sheffield, in which a man sold his wife for <b>a</b> <b>quart</b> <b>of</b> beer. Harcourt replied: [...] "no impression exists anywhere in England that the selling of wives is legitimate", and [...] "that no such practice as wife selling exists", but as late as 1889, {{a member of the}} Salvation Army sold his wife for a shilling in Hucknall Torkard, Nottinghamshire, and subsequently led her by the halter to her buyer's house, the last case in which the use of a halter is mentioned. The most recent case of an English wife sale was reported in 1913, when a woman giving evidence in a Leeds police court during a maintenance case claimed that her husband had sold her to one of his workmates for £1 (equivalent to about £ in [...] ). The manner of her sale is unrecorded.|$|E
500|$|Although the {{initiative}} was usually the husband's, the wife {{had to agree}} to the sale. An 1824 report from Manchester says that [...] "after several biddings she [...] was knocked down for 5s; but not liking the purchaser, she was put up again for 3s and <b>a</b> <b>quart</b> <b>of</b> ale". Frequently the wife was already living with her new partner. In one case in 1804 a London shopkeeper found his wife in bed with a stranger to him, who, following an altercation, offered to purchase the wife. The shopkeeper agreed, and in this instance the sale may have been an acceptable method of resolving the situation. However, the sale was sometimes spontaneous, and the wife could find herself the subject of bids from total strangers. In March 1766, a carpenter from Southwark sold his wife [...] "in a fit of conjugal indifference at the alehouse". Once sober, the man asked his wife to return, and after she refused he hanged himself. A domestic fight might sometimes precede the sale of a wife, but in most recorded cases the intent was to end a marriage in a way that gave it the legitimacy of a divorce. In some cases the wife arranged for her own sale, and even provided the money for her agent to buy her out of her marriage, such as an 1822 case in Plymouth.|$|E

2500|$|The {{result of}} the trip to Las Vegas became the 1972 book Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas, which first {{appeared}} in the November 1971 issues of Rolling Stone as a two-part series. It is written as a first-person account by a journalist named Raoul Duke on a trip to Las Vegas with Dr. Gonzo, his [...] "300-pound Samoan attorney", to cover a narcotics officers' convention and the [...] "fabulous Mint 400". During the trip, Duke and his companion (always referred to as [...] "my attorney") become sidetracked by a search for the American Dream, with [...] "two bags of grass, seventy-five pellets of mescaline, five sheets of high-powered blotter acid, a salt shaker half full of cocaine, and a whole galaxy of multi-colored uppers, downers, screamers, laughers... and also <b>a</b> <b>quart</b> <b>of</b> tequila, <b>a</b> <b>quart</b> <b>of</b> rum, a case of Budweiser, a pint of raw ether, and two dozen amyls." ...|$|E

2500|$|Shortly {{after its}} introduction, the Corvair faced {{competition}} from the Ford Falcon and Mercury Comet and was plagued by problems—though according to a 1960 Time report, [...] "many were the minor bugs that often afflict a completely new car." [...] Problems included an engine cooling fan belt that tended to pop off its 2-axis pulleys (unless the fan ran constantly, the air-cooled engine would overheat and seize), carburetor icing and poor fuel mileage [...] "which sometimes runs well under 20 m.p.g." [...] The 1960 model gasoline heater was cited as a problem, which itself could consume up to <b>a</b> <b>quart</b> <b>of</b> gas an hour—with Chevrolet engineers quickly modifying the Corvair's carburetors to improve economy.|$|E

2500|$|Following the hearings, {{the state}} of New York {{established}} a Milk Control Board in 1933 that was empowered to set maximum and minimum retail prices.

Nevertheless, the public suspected that the board's intent was to benefit dairy dealers, instead of farmers, because the minimum prices for the two sides were not the same. Tensions ran so high that violent milk strikes took place throughout the state, with two deaths and a great amount of property damage. Every public hearing of the Milk Control Board resulted in a [...] "tumultuous, popular assemblage" [...] and its every action was [...] "Statewide news." ...|$|E
2500|$|Although he {{produced}} many brilliant recordings during this period, Parker's behavior became increasingly erratic. Heroin {{was difficult to}} obtain once he moved to California, where the drug was less abundant, so he used alcohol as a substitute. A recording for the Dial label from July 29, 1946, provides evidence of his condition. Before this session, Parker drank <b>a</b> <b>quart</b> <b>of</b> whiskey. According to the liner notes of Charlie Parker on Dial Volume 1, Parker missed most {{of the first two}} bars of his first chorus on the track, [...] "Max Making Wax". When he finally did come in, he swayed wildly and once spun all the way around, away from his microphone. On the next tune, [...] "Lover Man", producer Ross Russell physically supported Parker. On [...] "Bebop" [...] (the final track Parker recorded that evening) he begins a solo with a solid first eight bars; on his second eight bars, however, he begins to struggle, and a desperate Howard McGhee, the trumpeter on this session, shouts, [...] "Blow!" [...] at him. Charles Mingus considered this version of [...] "Lover Man" [...] to be among Parker's greatest recordings, despite its flaws. Nevertheless, Parker hated the recording and never forgave Ross Russell for releasing it. He re-recorded the tune in 1951 for Verve.|$|E
2500|$|After {{the series}} Medical Center ended, Everett became {{frustrated}} when no movie roles were forthcoming and television roles were not working out. A long-time social drinker, he began drinking heavily. He was consuming <b>a</b> <b>quart</b> <b>of</b> vodka {{a day by}} the time he quit drinking in 1986. [...] "I was a functional alcoholic." [...] Shelby noted his alcohol-related mood swings and has said, [...] "finally I confronted him. I came into the bedroom with a big pot of coffee one morning and said 'we have a major problem to deal with here.'" [...] A month later, Everett caught sight of himself on a video and did not like what he saw. [...] " [...] 'Finally,' I said, 'I am really in trouble'. I stepped outside and I looked up and said, 'Father, you take it. I can't handle it anymore.'" [...] The next day, he told his daughters (who were living at home at the time), [...] "I am addicted to alcohol, and I am not going away to detox. I am going to do it here so that you can see what happens to someone if you let a substance take control of you." [...] He attended his first Alcoholics Anonymous meeting the next day and claimed he never drank again, attributing his discipline to his Christian faith and his self-pride.|$|E
