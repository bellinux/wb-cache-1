40|$|ABSTRACT. Six {{specimens}} of Australian iron ore, three hematite-rich and three goethite-rich, <b>ave</b> <b>been</b> investi-gated by <b>M</b> 6 ssbauer spectroscopy at both 300 K and 4. 2 K. The resulting spectra provide data relevant o crystallite particle size {{variations in the}} hematite and goethite, the extent of isomorphous replacement, and the existence within one specimen of a poorly defined goethite-like material. THE mineralogy of iron ore is of considerable interest, both because of the widespread occurrence of such ores and because of their economic im-portance. The Australian continent contains very large deposits of high-grade iron ore and Australia is well known as the world's largest iron ore exporter. The ore is essentially hematite derived from the desilicification and iron-enrichment of banded iron formations of Proterozoic age. The major ore bodies are situated in the north west of Western Australia. This area also contains large deposits of pisolitic limonite of Tertiary age which have great potential as future commercial sources of iron ore. The mineralogy of these ores has been described {{in a number of}} papers including Harms an...|$|R
