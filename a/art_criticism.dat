5|$|Intellectual men {{of letters}} like the {{versatile}} Shen Kuo dabbled in subjects {{as diverse as}} mathematics, geography, geology, economics, engineering, medicine, <b>art</b> <b>criticism,</b> archaeology, military strategy, and diplomacy, among others. On a court mission to inspect a frontier region, Shen Kuo once made a raised-relief map of wood and glue-soaked sawdust to show the mountains, roads, rivers, and passes to other officials. He once computed {{the total number of}} possible situations on a game board, another time the longest possible military campaign given the limits of human carriers who would bring their own food and food for other soldiers. Shen Kuo is also noted for improving the designs of the inflow clepsydra clock for a more efficient higher-order interpolation, the armillary sphere, the gnomon, and the astronomical sighting tube; increasing its width for better observation of the pole star and other celestial bodies. Shen Kuo also experimented with camera obscura, only a few decades after the first to do so, Ibn al-Haytham (965–1039).|$|E
40|$|Master of EducationThe {{purpose of}} this study is to examine the place of <b>arts</b> <b>criticism</b> within a junior {{secondary}} drama curriculum and specifically within the researcher's own teaching practice. Through the adoption of a reflective practitioner stance, the researcher explores the implementation of strategies designed to increase students' understanding and use of <b>arts</b> <b>criticism</b> skills. During the data collection process, the focus of the research moves from the students' responses to the teaching strategies, to the researcher's investigation of her teaching practice in relation to these teaching strategies. <b>Arts</b> <b>criticism</b> is defined in this study as being a part of the aesthetic field; it involves students' spontaneous and considered responses to arts works. In this study, <b>arts</b> <b>criticism</b> is understood both as an event in itself, allowing students to make considered reflective responses to arts works, and as a tool that enables students to communicate their immediate aesthetic responses. The study explores the place of <b>arts</b> <b>criticism</b> within the aesthetic realm through the writing of Abbs, McDonald and McLean. It establishes that there are limited practical resources available for teaching <b>arts</b> <b>criticism</b> in a drama curriculum. The significance of the teacher's role in establishing <b>arts</b> <b>criticism</b> within a drama curriculum emerges from the data analysis. The importance of the teacher's choice of vocabulary in the development of effective <b>arts</b> <b>criticism</b> strategies is evident. The metaphor of the Drama Detective is found to offer the students a constructive way of becoming engaged in <b>arts</b> <b>criticism</b> activities. This study confirms that <b>arts</b> <b>criticism</b> is a vital of part of the drama curriculum and it suggests possible means for the drama teacher to incorporate <b>arts</b> <b>criticism</b> into their drama teaching practice with junior secondary students.

5|$|The UChicago Arts program joins {{academic}} {{departments and}} {{programs in the}} Division of the Humanities and the College, as well as professional organizations including the Court Theatre, the Oriental Institute, the Smart Museum of Art, the Renaissance Society, University of Chicago Presents, and student arts organizations. The university has an artist-in-residence program and scholars in performance studies, contemporary <b>art</b> <b>criticism,</b> and film history. It has offered a doctorate in music composition since 1933 and in cinema and media studies since 2000, a master {{of fine arts in}} visual arts (early 1970s), and a master of arts in the humanities with a creative writing track (2000). It has bachelor's degree programs in visual arts, music, and art history, and, more recently, cinema and media studies (1996) and theater and performance studies (2002). The College's general education core includes a “dramatic, musical, and visual arts” requirement, inviting students to study the history of the arts, stage desire, or begin working with sculpture. Several thousand major and non-major undergraduates enroll annually in creative and performing arts classes. UChicago is often considered the birthplace of improvisational comedy as the Compass Players student comedy troupe evolved into The Second City improv theater troupe in 1959. The Reva and David Logan Center for the Arts opened in October 2012, five years after a $35 million gift from alumnus David Logan and his wife Reva. The center includes spaces for exhibitions, performances, classes, and media production. The Logan Center was designed by Tod Williams and Billie Tsien. This building is actually entirely glass. The brick is a facade designed to keep the glass safe from the wind. The architects later removed sections of the bricks when pressure arose in the form of complaints that the views of the city were blocked.|$|E

25|$|Transpersonal art {{is one of}} the {{disciplines}} considered by Boucovolas, in listing how transpersonal psychology may relate to other areas of transpersonal study. In writing about transpersonal art, Boucovolas begins by noting how, according to Breccia and also to the definitions employed by the International Transpersonal Association in 1971, transpersonal art may be understood as art work which draws upon important themes beyond the individual self, such as the transpersonal consciousness. This makes transpersonal <b>art</b> <b>criticism</b> germane to mystical approaches to creativity. Transpersonal <b>art</b> <b>criticism,</b> as Boucovolas notes, can be considered that which claims conventional <b>art</b> <b>criticism</b> has been too committed to stressing rational dimensions of art and has subsequently said little on art's spiritual dimensions, or as that which holds art work has a meaning beyond the individual person. Certain aspects of the psychology of Carl Jung, as well as movements such as music therapy and art therapy, may also relate to the field. Boucovolas' paper cites Breccia (1971) as an early example of transpersonal art, and claims that at the time his article appeared, integral theorist Ken Wilber had made recent contributions to the field. More recently, the Journal of Transpersonal Psychology, in 2005, Volume 37, launched a special edition devoted to the media, which contained articles on film criticism that can be related to this field.|$|E

25|$|An unsuspecting {{turn for}} the history of <b>art</b> <b>criticism</b> came in 1914 when Sigmund Freud {{published}} a psychoanalytical interpretation of Michelangelo’s Moses titled Der Moses des Michelangelo {{as one of the first}} psychology based analyses on a work of art. Freud first published this work shortly after reading Vasari’s Lives. For unknown purposes, Freud originally published the article anonymously.|$|E
25|$|Although {{critics were}} slow to react and reviews were mixed, many notable {{literary}} and artistic figures were impressed with the young man's work, notably Charlotte Brontë and Elizabeth Gaskell. Suddenly Ruskin had found his métier, and in one leap helped redefine the genre of <b>art</b> <b>criticism,</b> mixing a discourse of polemic with aesthetics, scientific observation and ethics. It cemented Ruskin’s relationship with Turner. After the artist died in 1851, Ruskin catalogued the nearly 20,000 sketches Turner gave to the British nation.|$|E
25|$|Finally, the {{developing}} theory of post-structuralism studies art's significance {{in a cultural}} context, such as the ideas, emotions, and reactions prompted by a work. The cultural context often reduces to the artist's techniques and intentions, in which case analysis proceeds along lines similar to formalism and intentionalism. However, in other cases historical and material conditions may predominate, such as religious and philosophical convictions, sociopolitical and economic structures, or even climate and geography. <b>Art</b> <b>criticism</b> continues to grow and develop alongside art.|$|E

Between 1894 and 1904 Sickert made a series of visits to Venice, initially focussing on the city's topography; it was during his last painting trip in 1903–04 that, forced indoors by inclement weather, he developed a distinctive approach to the multiple figure tableau that he further explored on his return to Britain. The models for many of the Venetian paintings are believed to have been prostitutes, with whom Sickert may have had sex.|$|E
