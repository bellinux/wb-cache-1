25|$|By {{the time}} of the rediscovery of the Roman law in Europe in the 12th and 13th centuries, the common law had already {{developed}} far enough to prevent a Roman law reception as it occurred on the continent. However, the first common law scholars, most notably Glanvill and Bracton, as well as the early royal common law judges, had been well accustomed with Roman law. Often, they were clerics trained in the Roman canon law. One of the first and throughout its history {{one of the most significant}} treatises of the common law, Bracton's De Legibus et Consuetudinibus Angliae (On the Laws and Customs of England), was heavily influenced by the division of the law in Justinian's Institutes. The impact of Roman law had decreased sharply after the age of Bracton, but the Roman divisions of actions into in rem (typically, actions against a thing or property for the purpose of gaining title to that property; must be filed in a court where the property is located) and in personam (typically, actions directed against a person; these can affect a person's rights and, since a person often owns things, his property too) used by Bracton had a lasting effect and laid the groundwork for a return of Roman law structural concepts in the 18th and 19th centuries. Signs of this can be found in Blackstone's Commentaries on the Laws of England, and Roman law ideas regained importance with the revival of academic law schools in the 19th century. <b>As</b> <b>a</b> <b>result,</b> <b>today,</b> the main systematic divisions of the law into property, contract, and tort (and to some extent unjust enrichment) can be found in the civil law as well as in the common law.|$|E

40|$|A {{denoising}} algorithm {{seeks to}} remove noise, errors, or perturbations from a signal. Extensive {{research has been}} devoted to this arena over the last several decades, and <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>result,</b> <b>today's</b> denoisers can effectively remove large amounts of additive white Gaussian noise. A compressed sensing (CS) reconstruction algorithm seeks to recover a structured signal acquired using a small number of randomized measurements. Typical CS reconstruction algorithms can be cast <b>as</b> iteratively estimating <b>a</b> signal from a perturbed observation. This paper answers a natural question: How can one effectively employ a generic denoiser in a CS reconstruction algorithm? In response, we develop an extension of the approximate message passing (AMP) framework, called Denoising-based AMP (D-AMP), that can integrate a wide class of denoisers within its iterations. We demonstrate that, when used with a high performance denoiser for natural images, D-AMP offers state-of-the-art CS recovery performance while operating tens of times faster than competing methods. We explain the exceptional performance of D-AMP by analyzing some of its theoretical features. A key element in D-AMP is the use of an appropriate Onsager correction term in its iterations, which coerces the signal perturbation at each iteration to be very close to the white Gaussian noise that denoisers are typically designed to remove...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: Tuberculosis (TB) {{is still}} {{a leading cause of}} death worldwide. Almost a third of the world's {{population}} is infected with TB bacilli, and each year approximately 8 million people develop active TB and 2 million die <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>result.</b> <b>Today's</b> TB treatment, which dates back to the 1970 s, is long and burdensome, requiring at least 6 mo of multidrug chemotherapy. The situation is further compounded by the emergence of multidrug-resistant TB (MDR-TB) and by the infection's lethal synergy with HIV/AIDS. Global health and philanthropic organizations are now pleading for new drug interventions that can address these unmet needs in TB treatment. METHODS AND FINDINGS: Here we report OPC- 67683, a nitro-dihydro-imidazooxazole derivative that was screened to help combat the unmet needs in TB treatment. The compound is a mycolic acid biosynthesis inhibitor found to be free of mutagenicity and to possess highly potent activity against TB, including MDR-TB, as shown by its exceptionally low minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) range of 0. 006 - 0. 024 microg/ml in vitro and highly effective therapeutic activity at low doses in vivo. Additionally, the results of the post-antibiotic effect of OPC- 67683 on intracellular Mycobacterium tuberculosis showed the agent to be highly and dose-dependently active also against intracellular M. tuberculosis H 37 Rv after a 4 -h pulsed exposure, and this activity at a concentration of 0. 1 microg/ml was {{similar to that of the}} first-line drug rifampicin (RFP) at a concentration of 3 microg/ml. The combination of OPC- 67683 with RFP and pyrazinamide (PZA) exhibited a remarkably quicker eradication (by at least 2 mo) of viable TB bacilli in the lung in comparison with the standard regimen consisting of RFP, isoniazid (INH), ethambutol (EB), and PZA. Furthermore, OPC- 67683 was not affected by nor did it affect the activity of liver microsome enzymes, suggesting the possibility for OPC- 67683 to be used in combination with drugs, including anti-retrovirals, that induce or are metabolized by cytochrome P 450 enzymes. CONCLUSIONS: We concluded that based on these properties OPC- 67683 has the potential to be used <b>as</b> <b>a</b> TB drug to help combat the unmet needs in TB treatment...|$|R
40|$|Uninterrupted {{power supply}} has become {{indispensable}} during the maintenance task of active electric power lines <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>result</b> of <b>today's</b> highly information-oriented society and increasing demand of electric utilities. The maintenance task has {{the risk of}} electric shock and the danger of falling from high place. Therefore {{it is necessary to}} realize an autonomous robot system using electro-hydraulic manipulator because hydraulic manipulators have the advantage of electric insulation. Meanwhile it is relatively difficult to realize autonomous assembly tasks particularly in the case of manipulating flexible objects uch as electric lines. In this report, a discrete vent control system is introduced for automatic assembly task of electric lines into sleeves as one of the typical task of active electric power lines. In the implementation f a discrete vent control system, LVQNN (linear vector quantization neural network) is applied to the insertion task of electric lines to sleeves. In order to apply these proposed control system to the unknown environment, virtual learning data for LVQNN is generated by fuzzy inference. By the experimental results of two types of electric lines and sleeves, these proposed discrete event control and neural network learning algorithm are confirmed very effective to the insertion tasks of electric lines to sleeves <b>as</b> <b>a</b> typical task of active electric power maintenance tasks...|$|R

40|$|Aims To {{explore the}} degree of {{agreement}} between patient and health care professional's perceptions of consultations. Methods Immediately after 141 dietitian/nurse specialist consultations, patients and professional's completed the Health Care Climate questionnaire (HCC), Medical Interview Satisfaction Scale (MISS) and the Treatment Self-Regulation Questionnaire (TSRQ) In addition, both parties were asked about any key points or issues discussed in the consultation; any decisions that were made about their diabetes treatment today; any goals that were set <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>result</b> of <b>today's</b> consultation. <b>Results</b> Patient and professional's scores on the HCC and MISS were not correlated (r = 0. 3 and 0. 16). Patient and professionals disagreed on the issues discussed 19. 6 % of the time, on the decisions made 20. 7 % {{of the time and}} goals set 44. 3 % of the time. More autonomy support in the consultation was associated with greater autonomous motivation for self-care (r = 0. 31; P < 0. 001) more controlled motivation was associated with less agreement on issues discussed and goals set (r = ? 0. 20; r = ? 0. 24; P < 0. 05). Conclusion There is significant disagreement between patients and professionals perceptions and recollection of the content of consultations. Professional's communications skills need to be developed to ensure these discrepancies are minimized.
