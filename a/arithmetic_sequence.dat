40|$|The goal of {{this article}} is to study the {{discrepancy}} of the distribution of <b>arithmetic</b> <b>sequences</b> in <b>arithmetic</b> progressions. We will fix a sequence ={(n) }_n≥ 1 of non-negative real numbers in a certain class of <b>arithmetic</b> <b>sequences.</b> For a fixed integer a≠ 0, we will be interested in the behaviour of over the arithmetic progressions a q, on average over q.

50|$|The {{proportional}} odds {{assumption is}} that the number added {{to each of these}} logarithms to get the next is the same in every case.

50|$|Now, by the {{definition}} of M, {{you can find a}} d-dimensional <b>arithmetic</b> <b>sequence</b> with benefits in any one of these blocks, and since all of the blocks have the same sequence of colors, the same d-dimensional AP with benefits appears in all of the blocks, just by translating it from block to block.

50|$|One of the {{advantages}} of maintaining the trie structure is that the trie makes it possible to determine quickly if a particular key {{is a member of the}} set of keys in a time that is proportional to the length of the key, k, in O(k) time, that is independent of the total number of keys. Determining set membership in a plain list, as opposed to determining set membership in a trie, requires binary search, O(k&thinsp;log(n)) time; linear search, O(kn) time; or some other method whose execution time is in some way dependent on the total number, n, of all of the keys in the worst case.

40|$|Starting from Ayy 2 we {{compute the}} Groebner {{basis for the}} {{defining}} ideal, P, of the monomial curves that correspond to <b>arithmetic</b> <b>sequences,</b> and then give an elegant description of the generators of powers of the initial ideal of P, inP. The first result of this paper introduces a procedure for generating infinite families of Ratliff-Rush ideals, in polynomial rings with multivariables, from a Ratliff-Rush ideal in polynomial rings with two variables. The second result is to prove that all powers of inP are Ratliff-Rush. The proof is through applying the first result of this paper combined with Corollary (12) in Ayy 4. This generalizes the work of Ayy 1 (or Ayy 11) for the case of <b>arithmetic</b> <b>sequences.</b> Finally, we apply the main result of Ayy 3 to give the necessary and sufficient conditions for the integral closedness of any power of inP...|$|R
