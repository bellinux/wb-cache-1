In 1998, Booker won an upset victory for a seat on the Newark City Council, defeating four-term incumbent George Branch. To draw attention to the problems of open-air drug dealing and associated violence, he went on a 10-day hunger strike and lived in a tent and later in a motor home near drug-dealing areas of the city. Booker proposed council initiatives that impacted housing, young people, law and order, and the efficiency and transparency of city hall, but was regularly outvoted by all of his fellow councilors.|$|E

The Department has also agreed to switch from a biennial audit to an annual Single Audit, and subject the program to periodic audits by its Administration for Socio-Economic Development, to detect and correct problems more quickly.

5|$|The {{convention}} center was plagued {{from the start}} by budget problems and construction blunders. City regulations forbid a general contractor having final authority over the project, so architects <b>and</b> <b>program</b> manager Richard Kahan had to coordinate the wide array of builders, plumbers, electricians, and other workers. The forged steel globes {{to be used in}} the space frame came to the site with hairline cracks and other defects; 12,000 were rejected. These and other problems led to media comparisons with the disastrous Hancock Tower. One New York City official blamed Kahan for the difficulties, indicating that the building's architectural flourishes were responsible for delays and financial crises. The Javits Center opened on 3 April 1986, to a generally positive reception. During the inauguration ceremonies, however, neither Freed nor Pei was recognized for their role in the project.|$|E

We make sure there's a lot of melody in the track, so it can inspire the writer. Together with the topline writer we work, often tweek and simplify the song, and never quit before we feel we've got a killer hook.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. SIMULA was a {{language}} for modeling <b>and</b> <b>programming</b> <b>and</b> provided a unified approach to modeling <b>and</b> <b>programming</b> {{in contrast to}} methodologies based on structured analysis and design.

In addi-tion to reintroducing the contributions of SIMULA and the Scandina-vian approach to object-oriented programming, we do this by discussing a number of issues in modeling <b>and</b> <b>programming</b> <b>and</b> argue 3 why we consider a unified approach to be an advantage. ...|$|R
