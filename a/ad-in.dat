25|$|The console, or bracket structure, is a {{specific}} architectonic element that has been designed in various ways through time. If the simple bracket system was already in use under the Goguryeo kingdom (37 BC – 668 <b>AD)—in</b> palaces in Pyongyang, for instance—a curved version, with brackets placed only on the column heads of the building, was elaborated during the early Goryeo (Koryo) dynasty (918–1392). The Amita Hall of the Buseok temple in Yeongju is a good example. Later on (from the mid-Koryo period to the early Joseon dynasty), a multiple-bracket system, or an inter-columnar-bracket set system, was developed under the ancient Han dynasty in China influence during the Mongolian Yuan dynasty (1279–1368). In this system, the consoles were also placed on the transverse horizontal beams. Seoul's Namdaemun Gate Namdaemun, Korea's first national treasure, {{is perhaps the most}} symbolic example of this type of structure.|$|E

The case asks students {{to construct the}} network precedence diagram to help a fictitious school design an 2 ̆ 2 MBA over the Internet 2 ̆ 2 program. Using a spreadsheet model and simulation <b>ad-in</b> program (such as @RISK or Insight), the simulation tells management what the critical activities are {{and whether or not}} the project can be completed by a certain date. Probabilistic calculations can be made from the simulation. Finally, the case shows how the simulation gives superior results compared to the traditional approaches of PERT / CPM...|$|E
40|$|Observers {{followed}} 30 {{learning disabled}} (LD), to instruction {{as a function}} of setting. While 32 emotionally/behaviorally disturbed (EBD), there were differences among groups in amount 30 educable mentally retarded (EMR), and 30 of time spent in regular versus special educa-nonhandicapped students each for one entire tion, there were few differences among cate-school day. They recorded in 10 -second inter- gories in the amount of time allocated to in-vals the amount of time allocated to instruction struction in specific content areas. Issues related in specific content areas, amounts of time spent to current special education practice are <b>ad-in</b> different school settings, and time allocated dressed. Current special education practices are based on two fundamental assumptions. First, it is assumed that certain students have instructional needs that can be met better through special programming than through standard educational prac-tice. The underlying premise is that different things happen in special education than in regular education, and that what is provided in special education adds to that provided in regular education. Second, it is assumed that mildly handicapped students with different cate-gorical labels have different instructional needs. The underlying premise is that students with different handicap labels receive different kinds of instruction. These assumptions and their premises have led to several outcomes that now are being questioned. One of these outcomes is the apparent one-way road from referral to special education placement, a finding that seems to reflect the belief that something different or at least additional can be done for students within special education (Algozzine, Christenson, & Ysseldyke, 1982). High referral-to-placement rates have been found despite considerable concern over the extent to which decisions are data based (Ysseldyke, Algozzine, Richey, & Graden, 1982), and even the extent to which available data are able to reliably discriminate between mildly handicapped students and students who are simpl...|$|E
40|$|The {{growth of}} Ag {{clusters}} on Si(111) - 7 x 7 surfaces was studied by {{scanning tunneling microscopy}} (STM), ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy, and x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). A shift in the Ag 3 d binding energy and a noticeable change in the valence-band structure reveal a significant modification of the electronic states of the Si(111) - 7 X 7 surface and the dispersed Ag clusters, which had a strong dependence on the coverage of Ag. Furthermore, these Ag clusters deposited on the Si surface alter the behavior of oxygen adsorption on the Si(111) - 7 X 7 surface. As evidenced by XPS, the presence of Ag inhibits the adsorbed surface oxygen species, the ins-ins and <b>ad-ins</b> oxygen, in which "ad" denotes an O atom bonding {{on top of the}} Si adatom and "ins" denotes an O atom inserted into a Si adatom back bond. The STM and high-resolution electron energy loss spectroscopy results show that the ins-ins oxygen species are more significantly suppressed by the Ag clusters compared to the <b>ad-ins</b> oxygen.

40|$|The oxygen-induced {{migration}} of Ag clusters on Si (111) - 7 x 7 surface was observed by in-situ STM. All experiments {{were carried out}} in UHV system. The Si (111) - 7 x 7 surface was obtained by directly heating to 1200 degreesC for several times. At the beginning of Ag clusters growth on the Si (111) - 7 x 7 surface, Ag clusters formed the uniform and well-ordered arrays on the surface. The monomers, dimers and clusters of Ag were observed. After exposure to oxygen, some Ag clusters vanished and conglomerated into bigger clusters. As known, {{there are two kinds}} of adsorbed oxygen species on the Si surface, <b>ad-ins</b> and ins-ins. The Ag clusters appear to move easily on the surface until being trapped by adsorbed atomic oxygen and pinned around the adsorbed oxygen. It was confirmed that the {{migration of}} Ag clusters is caused by oxygen decoration. The statistical results show that the Ag clusters diffuse much easily on partly oxidized Si (111) - 7 x 7 surface than on Si (111) - 7 x 7 surface. It was also found that the strong interaction between Ag cluster and adsorbed oxygen species causes a distinct change of the property of adsorbed oxygen, i. e. a change of surface ins-ins oxygen into <b>ad-ins</b> oxygen species, reflecting the role of substrate at room temperature...|$|R
