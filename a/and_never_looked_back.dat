The Royals sent 13 hitters to the plate.|$|E
25|$|Coming {{into the}} series, the White Sox {{had the best}} record and the best {{pitching}} staff in the AL.

Boston took a five inning lead in the second game, off of a David Ortiz home run, earning the first win for Clay Buchholz. Craig Kimbrel preserved the 5–2 win with his ninth save.

25|$|After the {{disappointment}} of losing to North Melbourne in the 1977 Preliminary Final, the Hawks were back {{to play in}} the 1978 Grand Final, again against North Melbourne. It was the third time in four seasons that these two sides were to meet in a grand final. North Melbourne were competing in their fifth successive grand final and were the reigning premiers. At half-time North Melbourne led by four points but Hawthorn finished victors by three goals thanks largely to a strong third quarter which saw them kick 7.6. The turning point occurred when two North players spoiled each other in the goalsquare at the 6-minute mark, when a mark and a goal could have put them 17 points up. The Hawks went on to dominate play after this incident <b>and</b> <b>never</b> <b>looked</b> <b>back.</b>|$|E

Ponting then declared, and tea was taken with an Australian total of eight for 528 – which set a target of 491 for South Africa, which would have been a world record chase. With both openers out {{before the end of the}} fourth day, South Africa needed a further 406 runs to win for their last eight wickets.|$|E

Eric Hinske hit a solo home run to make it 5–2, but Phillies pitcher Joe Blanton hit a solo home run of his own to make it 6–2. In the 8th inning for the Phillies, Jayson Werth and Ryan Howard each hit 2-run home runs, {{finishing}} off the Rays in the most one-sided game the series had seen by a score of 10–2. The Phillies now had the Rays on the ropes, needing just one more win to become World Champions.|$|E
25|$|Nicklaus won {{the first}} two major championships of 1972 by three shots each in wire-to-wire fashion. He won the Masters and the U.S. Open, {{creating}} talk of a calendar-year Grand Slam. Nicklaus opened with a four-under par 68 at Augusta National <b>and</b> <b>never</b> <b>looked</b> <b>back.</b> He was the only player under par for the week as he and the field battled difficult scoring conditions. In the U.S. Open at Pebble Beach again under severe scoring conditions, Nicklaus struck a one-iron on the 218-yard par-three 17th hole during the final round into a stiff, gusty ocean breeze that hit the flagstick and ended up three inches from the cup. The U.S. Open was Nicklaus' 13th career major and tied him with Bobby Jones for career majors (although a different group of tournaments had been considered majors in Jones's time). This victory was also Nicklaus' 11th professional major, tying him with Walter Hagen, and made him {{the first player to}} win the U.S. Amateur and U.S. Open championships on the same golf course.|$|E
25|$|In {{their first}} match after the World Cup campaign, Scotland faced France in the {{southern}} French town of Lezignan. Shaun McRae, citing his domestic coaching at Hull, departed as Scotland coach and Glasgow-born Billy McGinty took over the role with the then Swinton Lions coach and former Great Britain player Mike Gregory taking the role of assistant coach. The squad for this match included 13 survivors from the World Cup matches and three new players who were each earning their first international cap. The Scots {{got off to a}} great start, scoring three tries in the first 13 minutes <b>and</b> <b>never</b> <b>looked</b> <b>back</b> as they won the match 42–20. The heat in the French summer was thought to be a problem going into the match, but Scotland scored seven tries in total to record their first win against the French and arguably their best win yet in international competition. Two tries each were scored by Danny Arnold and Jason Flowers, and Matt Crowther converted all seven tries. Seven years later this victory is Scotland's biggest win and is still recognised as one of their best amongst supporters.|$|E

500|$|Beilein {{stayed at}} 499 career wins at {{four-year}} academic institutions, as Michigan suffered its first consecutive losses {{of the season}} when its second conference loss, which came against Illinois on January 14, {{was followed by a}} loss to the Ohio State Buckeyes on January 17. The Illinois contest was a rematch from ten days earlier. After a 31–30 Michigan halftime lead resulting from 11 lead changes, Illinois shut down Michigan early in the second half to build a 57–45 lead with 5 minutes remaining. In the game, Michigan did not attempt a free throw until the last 1 minute and 45 seconds of the second half. [...] Against Ohio State, Michigan struggled against a 1–2–2 zone early in the game and fell behind by 11 before closing to a 29–25 halftime deficit. Michigan took a 44–40 lead with eight minutes remaining, and the score was tied at 47 before Ohio State ran off 10 points in a row. The game was a twentieth year celebration of the last Wolverine national championship with all but two members of the 1989 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament championship team in attendance as the team wore throwback uniforms. [...] The consecutive losses caused the team to lose almost all of their support in the national rankings. [...] On January 20, in a contest against Penn State that pitted the conferences two leading scorers (Harris and Talor Battle), Michigan shot 9 for 30 from the field in the first half including 2 for 16 on three-point shot attempts. They fell behind by as many as 23 points in the second half. The loss extended the losing streak to three games. Although Michigan rebounded with Beilein's 500th win in a January 24 victory over Northwestern in which they scored on their first five possessions <b>and</b> <b>never</b> <b>looked</b> <b>back,</b> [...] they lost all support among the voters in the polls.|$|E

The Red Sox could only put seven runs on the board while the Rays added another four. A strong outing by Rick Porcello, allowing only one run in six innings, was backed by eight runs of support. Matt Moore held Boston hitless through five innings in the rubber match. In the sixth, the Red Sox could load the bases on three hits with only one out, but David Ortiz and Hanley Ramírez could not drive them in. David Price allowed four runs in the first three innings, but that was all the Rays needed in the shutout win.|$|E

He pitched a complete game, giving up three runs on three hits but the offense could only give him two runs of support. Chris Young hit his first home run in a Red Sox uniform but Royals pitching struck out 13 Red Sox batters. This was the fourth time in eight starts, Wright has gotten three runs or less in support. Jackie Bradley, Jr. extended his hitting streak to 23 games, with a one-out single in the ninth. David Price continued his good work in game 3 of the series, giving up 2 runs in [...] innings.
