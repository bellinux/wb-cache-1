Diarrhoeal disease in children is self limiting and can be treated withrehydration and other supportive therapy without antibiotics. The antibiotics are used onlyfor treatment of dysentery, cholera and persistant diarrhoea. In the present study, 275 stool specimens were collected, 180 (65. 5 %) from Muzzamil Abayazid Hospital in Mayo District, Khartoum State and 95 (34. 5 %) from Ibrahim Mallik Teaching Hospital in Elsahafa, Khartoum State during the period from November 2001 to October 2002 from children under five years of age with diarrhoea. After culture in selective and differential media 283 clinical isolates were obtained. The commonest etiological organism was E. coli 107 (37. 9 %) followed by Proteus 67 (23. 7 %), Salmonella 12 (4. 2 %), Shigella 11 (3. 9 %), Klebsiella 40 (8. 8 %), Pseudomonas 25 (14 %), and Citrobacter 10 (3. 5 %).

40|$|Aims: This study {{examined}} 448 Campylobacter strains isolated in 1999 and 2000 from US feedlot cattle for resistance to 12 antimicrobials. Methods and Results: Isolates were tested for antimicrobial susceptibility using the E-test method. Approximately 60 % (n = 267) <b>were</b> <b>resistant</b> {{to one or}} more antimicrobials, and 19 · 6 % (n = 88) <b>were</b> <b>resistant</b> to two or more antimicrobials.

Results: The prevalence of ESBL producing K. pneumoniae was 21 % (30 / 138).
