50|$|To {{provide for}} a safe {{environment}} to perform normal helicopter landing and takeoff operations each heliport must have unobstructed approach/departure paths. At a minimum the FAA recommends {{that there should be}} two approach departure path so that pilots have viable unobstructed routes into and out of a heliport under multiple wind conditions. The minimum recommended separation between flight paths is 135 degrees. A heliport approach path is broken down into two distinct airspace surfaces, the <b>Approach</b> <b>Surface</b> and the Transitional Surface. The <b>approach</b> <b>surface</b> begins {{at each end of the}} heliport primary surface with the same width as the primary surface, and extends outward and upward for a horizontal distance of 4,000 feet where its width is 500 feet. The slope of the <b>approach</b> <b>surface</b> is 8 to 1 for civil heliports. The Transitional Surfaces extend outward and upward from the lateral boundaries of the primary surface and from the approach surfaces at a slope of 2 to 1 for a distance of 250 feet measured horizontally from the centerline of the primary and approach surfaces. Approach paths can either be straight or curved to accommodate obstructions and avoidance areas.|$|E
