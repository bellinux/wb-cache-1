40|$|This {{paper was}} {{accepted}} for publication in the journal Journal of Environmental Management and the definitive published version is available at [URL] prolonged challenges and terrible consequences of poor sanitation, especially in developing economies, call for the exploration of new sustainable sanitation technologies. Such technologies must be: capable of effectively treating human faecal wastes without any health or environmental impacts; scalable to address rapid increases in population and urbanization; capable of meeting environmental regulations and standards for faecal management; and competitive with existing strategies. Further and importantly, despite its noxiousness and pathogenic load, the chemical composition of human faecal sludge indicates {{that it could be}} considered a potentially valuable, nutrient-rich renewable resource, rather than a problematic waste product. New approaches to faecal sludge management must consequently seek to incorporate a ‘valuable resource recovery’ approach, compatible with stringent treatment requirements. This review intends to advance the understanding of human faecal sludge as a sustainable organic-rich resource that is typically high in moisture (up to 97 per cent), making it a suitable candidate for dielectric heating, i. e. microwave irradiation, to promote faecal treatment, while also recovering value-added products such as <b>ammonia</b> <b>liquor</b> concentrate (suitable for fertilizers) and chars (suitable for fuel) – which can provide an economic base to sustain the technology. Additionally, microwaving human faecal sludge represents a thermally effective approach that can destroy pathogens, eradicate the foul odour associated human faecal sludge, while also preventing hazardous product formations and/or emissions, aside from other benefits such as improved dewaterability and heavy metals recovery.

This study investigated the effect of sodium butyrate (SB) on in vitro and in vivo swine microflora, piglet growth performance, and intestinal wall morphology. During a 24 -h in vitro cecal fermentation, total gas production and maximal rate of gas production were reduced linearly by SB (P < 0. 001). <b>Ammonia</b> in cecal <b>liquor</b> was increased linearly by SB after 4, 8, and 24 h of fermentation (P < 0. 001). In the in vivo study, 48 piglets housed in individual crates were allotted to 4 treatment groups (12 animals per treatment) for 6 wk. Piglets received a basal diet with a) no addition (control), or with SB at b) 1, 000 ppm, c) 2, 000 ppm, or d) 4, 000 ppm. After 6 wk, 6 animals per treatment were killed, and samples of intestinal content and mucosa were collected. Sodium butyrate did not improve the animal growth performance. In the cecum, SB increased pH and isobutyric acid concentration (linear, P < 0. 05) and tended to increase ammonia concentration (P = 0. 056). Intestinal counts of clostridia, enterobacteriaceae, and lactic acid bacteria as well as intestinal mucosal morphology were not affected by feeding SB. This study showed that SB influenced the cecal microflora in an in vitro system, reducing the total gas production but increasing ammonia concentrations. When fed to piglets, SB did not improve the animal growth performance, increased cecal pH, and tended to increase cecal ammonia concentrations. Further studies will be needed to better understand the mechanisms underlying the effects observed when SB is fed to piglets. © 2007 American Society of Animal Science. All rights reserved...|$|R

We used new equipment (selected-ion-flow-tube mass spectrometer) that allows rapid and precise analysis {{of many of the}} gases present in a sample. Samples of rumen headspace gas and corresponding samples of rumen liquor were taken from three lactating cows, prepared with rumen fistulae, at intervals after receiving their morning feed allocation (grass silage and concentrates). Hydrogen sulfide, methyl sulfide, and dimethyl sulfide, were the predominant gases that were measured in the rumen headspace by this technique. The concentrations of these sulfur compounds declined over the interval after feeding, mirroring ammonia concentrations measured in rumen liquor, reflecting their common dependence on the fermentation of sulfur amino acids. Ammonia concentrations in rumen headspace gas varied in the opposite direction to the concentration of <b>ammonia</b> in rumen <b>liquor</b> and likely depend more on the pH of rumen liquor. Consideration of the pKa of ammonia suggests that ammonia concentrations in rumen gas will be very low below pH 6, representing a useful diagnostic for subacute ruminal acidosis.

The molar proportions of volatile fatty acids were similar in gas and liquor samples, with rumen gas containing slightly less acetic acid and disproportionately more valeric and caproic acids.

We perform this systematic evaluation by (1) outlining the remote, spectroscopic signal generation process, (2) documenting the capabilities of current commercial satellite systems, (3) systematically comparing the uranium mining and milling process to other mineral mining and milling operations, and (4) identifying the most promising observables associated with uranium mining and milling that can be identified using satellite remote sensing. The Ranger uranium mine and mill in Australia serves {{as a case study}} where we apply and test the techniques developed in this systematic analysis. Based on literature research of mineral mining and milling practices, we develop a decision tree which utilizes the information contained in one or more observables to determine whether uranium is possibly being mined and/or milled at a given site. Promising observables associated with uranium mining and milling at the Ranger site included in the decision tree are uranium ore, sulfur, the uranium pregnant leach <b>liquor,</b> <b>ammonia,</b> and uranyl compounds and sulfate ion disposed of in the tailings pond. Based on the size, concentration, and spectral characteristics of these promising observables, we then determine whether these observables can be identified using current commercial satellite systems, namely Hyperion, ASTER, and Quickbird. We conclude that the only promising observables at Ranger that can be uniquely identified using a current commercial satellite system (notably Hyperion) are magnesium chlorite in the open pit mine and the sulfur stockpile. Based on the identified magnesium chlorite and sulfur observables, the decision tree narrows the possible mineral candidates at Ranger to uranium, copper, zinc, manganese, vanadium, the rare earths, and phosphorus, all of which are milled using sulfuric acid leaching...|$|R

Napier grass, leucaena, and wheat pollard were incubated separately in the nylon bags to determine DM digestibility. The cross inoculation (total of rumen content) was done less than 10 minutes. In post-inoculation, the sample of rumen content was taken at two hours before morning feeding as long as two days of two weeks after inoculation. Changes in rumen ecosystem (pH, NH 3 -N and total VFA) were tested by using Completely Randomized Design.

The standardised evaluation of these manure additive products under specific farm conditions is important. In this study, the efficacy of a manure additive (WonderTreat(TM), CKLS, Inc., Hong-Kong) was assessed under Australian conditions utilising a combination of laboratory and field-scale evaluation techniques. As a first step, the efficacy of the manure additive was assessed in a laboratory-scale trial using a series of uniformly managed digesters and standard odour, <b>liquor</b> <b>ammonia</b> and hydrogen sulphide concentration measurement procedures. This showed that the addition of WonderTreat(TM) at the 'low dose rate' (LDR) (102. 6 g m- 2) used during the trial significantly, but only marginally (30 %; P = 0. 02) reduced the OE rate (mean 13. 9 OU m- 2 s- 1) of anaerobic pig liquor relative to an untreated control (UC) (19. 9 OU m- 2 s- 1).

A diet for pigs (CP 15. 8 %, DE 15. 0 MJ/kg) was predigested in vitro to simulate ileal digestion and later used as the substrate in the in vitro fermentation. Caecal content was collected from 6 pigs, diluted with buffer and used as inoculum. The inoculum was flushed with CO_{ 2 }_ and dispensed into five glass syringes and five vessels per treatment, containing predigested diet. Syringes and vessels were incubated at 39 °C for 24 h. There were 6 treatments: control diet, or control diet with GA added at 2, 000, 4, 000, 6, 000, 8, 000, and 10, 000 ppm. Gas production was measured recording the cumulative volume of gas produced every 30 min. Samples of fermentation fluid were collected from each vessel at time 0, 4, 8 and 24 h for ammonia and at time 24 h for short-chain fatty acids (SCFA) determination. During the 24 h in vitro caecal fermentation, total gas production and maximum rate of gas production were increased by all GA concentrations in a dose-dependent manner (P < 0. 001). <b>Ammonia</b> in fermentation <b>liquor</b> was reduced by GA at 2, 000 (– 26 %; P < 0. 01) and 4, 000 ppm (– 17 %; P < 0. 05) after 4 h and at all concentrations (P < 0. 001) after 8 h and 24 h, with the only exception of GA at 2, 000 ppm.
