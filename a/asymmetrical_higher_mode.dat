40|$|The Rayleigh-wave phase {{velocity}} of a layered earth {{model is a}} function of frequency and four groups of earth parameters: com-pressional (P) -wave velocity, shear (S) -wave velocity, density, and thickness of layers. For the fundamental mode of Rayleigh waves, analysis of the Jacobian matrix for high frequencies (5 - 40 Hz) provides a measure of dispersion curve sensitivity to earth model parameters. S-wave velocities are the dominant influence of the four earth model parameters. With the lack of sensitivity of the Rayleigh wave to P-wave velocities and densities, estimations of these parameters can be made for a layered earth model such that dispersive data vary predominantly with S-wave velocities (Xia et al., 1999 a). This thesis is valid for <b>higher</b> <b>modes</b> of Rayleigh waves as well. Experimental analysis indicates that energy of <b>higher</b> <b>modes</b> tends to become more dominant as the source distance becomes larger (Park et al., 1999 a). In some cases, <b>higher</b> <b>mode</b> data are necessary since shorter wavelength components of fundamental mode Rayleigh waves are obscured by these higher frequency data where <b>higher</b> <b>modes</b> of Rayleigh waves dominate.

40|$|In the Ph. D. thesis, the {{extension}} of the N 2 method for the structures with important <b>higher</b> <b>mode</b> effects along the elevation has been proposed. The estimation of <b>higher</b> <b>mode</b> effects is based on assumption that the structure remains in the elastic range when vibrating in <b>higher</b> <b>modes.</b> In other words, it is assumed that the <b>higher</b> <b>mode</b> effects in the inelastic range are the same as in the elastic range. Based on this assumption, the computational procedure was prepared. The influence of <b>higher</b> <b>modes</b> is determined by the standard elastic modal analysis and applied in terms of correction factors, which are used for the adjustment of the results obtained by the usual pushover analysis. The proposed procedure is consistent and compatible with the extended N 2 method for plan-asymmetric buildings. A single standard elastic modal response spectrum analysis can provide correction factors for taking into account the <b>higher</b> <b>mode</b> effects both in plan and in elevation. We consider this point as the main advantage of the proposed approach. In {{the first part of the}} thesis, the proposed procedure was applied to nine planar steel frame building with different number of stories using different intensities of ground motion. The results, in particular storey drifts, are compared with the results of nonlinear response history analysis, with the results of other simplified nonlinear methods (MPA and MMPA), and with the results obtained by pushover analysis without consideration of <b>higher</b> <b>modes.</b> A considerable influence of <b>higher</b> <b>modes</b> on storey drifts can be observed at the upper part of the structures. The extended N 2 method, as well as the other two methods (MPA and MMPA), which approximately take into account the <b>higher</b> <b>mode</b> effects, are able to substantially improve the accuracy of the results compared to results without considering the influence of <b>higher</b> <b>modes</b> (basic N 2 method). The accuracy of predictions of the three approximate methods (proposed N 2, MPA and MMPA), varies with the intensity of ground motion (i. e. with the magnitude of plastic deformation) and is different for different sets of ground motions and for different structural systems.

This {{is done by}} a theoretical and computation analysis of the approximations involved, development of a method of stacking noise traces, and analysis of a small array {{in the northern part}} of the Netherlands. <b>Higher</b> <b>modes</b> are unambiguously present in ambient noise, and can thus be used to improve vertical resolution in the subsequent inversion procedure. The practical issue in their use, remains the problem of distinguishing them from spurious events/noise, and even distinghuising <b>higher</b> <b>modes</b> from the fundamental <b>mode,</b> since at <b>high</b> frequencies they can be in close proximity in a time-frequency diagram. <b>Higher</b> <b>modes</b> can furthermore be lost in the data due to: -their small amplitude compared to the fundamental mode. -intermodal cross-terms that occur with imperfect distributions, but occur even in the case of a perfectly surrounding integration surface. However, if noise is generated in a large band-like distribution (or very far away) the cross-terms should pose no problem. - source-source correlation terms. The signal to noise ratio is much smaller for <b>higher</b> <b>modes.</b> The exact instantaneous phase takes much longer to converge to the true solution than the envelope, implying larger uncertainty for phase velocity measurements. -incoherent noise not associated to wave propagation, or local effects. Directional noise shows much faster convergence for <b>higher</b> <b>modes,</b> again at least for station paths inline in this direction. Also in our data, the noise is strongly directional. It can be argued that the <b>higher</b> <b>mode</b> information would not be retrieved if this were not the case. The <b>higher</b> <b>mode</b> has a different origin from the dominant secondary microseism. The TF-phase weighted stack is a powerful tool to denoise the retrieved seismograms. It is possible to measure the group velocity from the phase stack directly. To retrieve <b>higher</b> <b>modes,</b> the phase stack provides an easy to use, additional tool. Most information remains in relative few TF-stacks from long displacement traces. Verification with additional information was essential for a robust estimate of the 1 D S-velocity structure beneath Annerveen, The Netherlands.

The tomographic images seem to correlate with the main geological features, but for the <b>higher</b> <b>modes</b> the amount of interstation paths that can be reliably measured is not large enough. This is due to interference with the fundamental mode in the group velocity images and the limited directionality. The choice of a substantial spread in interstation distances led to a broad frequency range of analysis, but also limited the number of measurements per frequency.

40|$|The {{interference}} of {{the fundamental}} and <b>higher</b> <b>modes</b> of Love waves is an important subject to be solved for the inversion problem of the velocity of surface waves. After a sufficient analysis of Love waves {{with respect to the}} contamination {{of the fundamental}} and <b>higher</b> <b>modes,</b> the inversion of the group and phase velocities of the waves seems to be meaningful for a searching examination of surface wave polarization anisotropy. For making clear the problem about the contamination of different modes the excitation of the fundamental and first <b>higher</b> <b>modes</b> of oceanic Love waves is investigated numerically by generating synthetic waves based on a couple of representative fault models. The wave form and velocity of the two modes which travelled about 7000 km, comparable to the length of the great circle path over the western Pacific, are investigated with special reference to the wave interference between the two modes. It is understood that the contamination of the first <b>higher</b> <b>mode</b> on the fundamental mode is severe for periods less than 100 sec, showing that the intensity of the amplitude spectra of the first <b>higher</b> <b>mode</b> is close to that of the fundamental mode near a period of 40 sec, and that the former is about one third of the latter at the period of 100 sec. The group velocities of Love waves contaminated by the two modes showed values lower and higher than those of the fundamental mode for periods shorter and longer than 70 sec, respectively. This group velocity dispersion curve has a trend approaching that of the first <b>higher</b> <b>mode.</b> The influence of the first, second, and third <b>higher</b> <b>modes</b> upon the fundamental mode is studied by calculating the theoretical amplitude spectral ratios of those <b>higher</b> <b>modes</b> to the fundamental mode. ラブ波基本モードと高次モードの干渉は,表面波速度の逆問題にとって,解かれるべき一つの重要な課題である. 基本モードと高次モードの混合に関するラブ波の十分な解析の後に,表面波群速度と位相速度のインバージョンは表面波Polarization anisotropyの厳重な検討に対して意味をもつと思われる. 異種モードの混合に関する問題を明らかにする為に,海洋性ラブ波の基本及び高次モードの励起が,二,三の代表的な断層モデルに基づいて合成波をつくる事により数値的に見積られた. 西太平洋上の大円弧の長さに匹敵する約 7000 km伝播した二つのモードの波形と速度を,特に二種モードの干渉に関連して調べた. 基本モードに対する一次高次モードの混合は周期 100 秒以内で激烈であり, 40 秒付近では,一次高次モードの振幅スペクトルの強度は基本モードのそれに近く, 100 秒では前者は後者のおよそ 3 分の 1 である事が理解出来た,二種モードが干渉した波の群速度は基本モードのそれよりも 70 秒以下では低く, 70 秒以上では高くなる事を示している. この群速度分散曲線は一次高次モードのそれに近づく傾向がみられる. 二次,三次高次モードが基本モードに及ぼす影響の度合を高次モードの基本モードに対する振幅スペクトル比から推定した. 高次モードが無視出来ない周期範囲はその振幅スペクトル比の基準を仮に 30 %とすると,一次高次モードが周期 40 秒から 130 秒まで,二次高次モードが 70 秒まで,三次高次モードが 50 秒までと推定される. 基準レベルを 50 %とすると一次高次モードは周期 40 秒から 80 秒までは無視出来ず,二次,三次高次モードは周期 40 秒以上のどの周期でも無視出来る...|$|R

Stacking methods {{applied to}} wide arrays of long period {{stations}} provide {{a powerful tool}} to investigate the physical properties of the upper mantle by means of <b>higher</b> <b>modes.</b> In this paper, the UC-diagram technique of Cara (1976) is applied to a subset of records first used by Nolet (1975, 1976) to determine the dispersion of <b>higher</b> Rayleigh <b>modes</b> in western Europe. For the fundamental and first <b>higher</b> <b>modes,</b> the phase velocities found {{in the present study}} are very similar to those first obtained by Nolet (1976) but the second made exhibits slightly higher velocities in the period range 35 - 55 s.

A new set of <b>higher</b> Love <b>mode</b> phase velocities has been also obtained in western Europe. As it has already been observed for the fundamental mode in several parts of the world, the phase velocities found here for the first and second <b>higher</b> <b>modes</b> are too large compared to those predicted by the models fitting the Rayleigh mode data.
