5|$|A recent {{molecular}} {{study indicates}} that the song thrush's closest relatives are the similarly plumaged mistle thrush (T. viscivorus) and Chinese thrush (T. mupinensis); these three species are early offshoots from the lineage of Turdus thrushes before they diversified <b>and</b> <b>spread</b> across the globe, and hence are less closely related to other European thrush species such as the blackbird (T. merula).|$|E

40|$|Interactions between integrin-mediated adhesions and the {{extracellular}} matrix (ECM) are important regulators of cell migration <b>and</b> <b>spreading.</b> However, {{mechanisms by which}} extracellular ligands regulate cell migration <b>and</b> <b>spreading</b> in response to changes in substratum concentration are not well understood. Semaphorin 3 A (Sema 3 A) {{has been shown to}} inhibit cell motility and alter integrin signaling in various cell types. We propose that Sema 3 A alters focal adhesions to modulate breast carcinoma cell migration <b>and</b> <b>spreading</b> on substrata coated with different concentrations of ECM. We demonstrate that Sema 3 A inhibits MDA-MB- 231 cell migration <b>and</b> <b>spreading</b> on substrata coated with high concentrations of collagen and fibronectin but enhances migration <b>and</b> <b>spreading</b> at lower concentrations of collagen and fibronectin. Sema 3 A increases focal adhesion kinase phosphorylation at tyrosine 397 (pFAK 397) at focal adhesions on all substratum concentrations of collagen and fibronectin but decreased pFAK 397 levels on laminin. Rho-associated protein kinase (ROCK) inhibition blocks the Sema 3 A-mediated effects on cell migration, <b>spreading,</b> <b>and</b> pFAK 397 at focal adhesions when cultured on all concentrations of collagen. These results suggest that Sema 3 A shifts the optimal level of cell-matrix adhesions to a nonoptimal ECM coating concentration, in particular collagen, to yield maximal cell migration <b>and</b> <b>spreading</b> that may be mediated through a ROCK-dependent mechanism...|$|R

40|$|Adhesion <b>and</b> <b>spreading</b> are {{essential}} processes of anchorage dependent cells involved in regulation of cell functions. Cells {{interact with their}} extracellular matrix (ECM) resulting in different degree of adhesion <b>and</b> <b>spreading.</b> However, {{it is not clear}} whether cell adhesion or cell spreading is more important for cell functions. In this study, 10 types of isotropical micropatterns that were composed of 2 [*]μm microdots were prepared to precisely control the adhesion area <b>and</b> <b>spreading</b> area of human mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs). The respective influence of adhesion <b>and</b> <b>spreading</b> areas on stem cell functions was investigated. Adhesion area showed more significant influences on the focal adhesion formation, binding of myosin to actin fibers, cytoskeletal organization, cellular Young’s modulus, accumulation of YAP/TAZ in nuclei, osteogenic and adipogenic differentiation of MSCs than did the spreading area. The results indicated that adhesion area rather than spreading area played more important roles in regulating cell functions. This study should provide new insight of the influence of cell adhesion <b>and</b> <b>spreading</b> on cell functions and inspire the design of biomaterials to process in an effective manner for manipulation of cell functions...|$|R
