5000|$|Firefighters {{consistently}} {{had problems}} with maintaining correct nozzle pressure on fire pumps. Task Force Tip nozzles were designed to resolve this problem. They adjust to the different pressures in the hose. Chief Clyde McMillan was working with the Gary Fire Task Force in 1971, when he designed an <b>automatic</b> <b>nozzle</b> on a napkin in 1968 and constructed it in his basement. Today, the company continues innovating through research and development. [...] Task Force Tips manufactures and distributes fire fighting nozzles and equipment in more than 60 countries.|$|E
50|$|Non-{{pressure}} refuel systems operate via {{a closed}} loop system where all pressure is contained interior to signal lines, level control, and a shut-off valve. When the fuel tank fill point is reached, a bleed line signal is closed and back pressure is applied to a diaphragm valve at the fuel entry point. Due to differential pressure and an internal spring, the diaphragm is forced closed and cannot be overfilled. Non-pressurized refueling systems do not require tank pressurization for <b>automatic</b> <b>nozzle</b> shut-off, thus allowing their use on thin-walled metallic and composite material fuel tanks.|$|E
5000|$|Fog nozzles come in many in {{different}} styles and sizes, {{but there are}} three types which encompass most: automatic, selectable, and manually adjustable. All contain an adjustable baffle that, like a thumb placed {{on the end of}} a garden hose, keeps their flow rates and stream reaches steady and finely adjustable despite variations in water pressure at the nozzle. To adjust the flow, the first two types use a control handle, or 'bale' located at the top of nozzle; however, selectable nozzles have a fixed set of flow rates (e.g., 60, 95, and 125 GPM (gallons per min)) that are chosen with a ring or [...] located at their tips. It is important to note that selectable nozzles will only flow if the pump pressure exceeds the nozzle pressure. Moreover, the selectable nozzle will change its nozzle pressure and reach as the handle is moved, but the <b>automatic</b> <b>nozzle</b> will automatically re-adjust its opening as the firefighter adjusts its flow rate in order to maintain the correct pressure.|$|E
50|$|Dover's {{acquisition}} history reaches {{beyond the}} elevator industry. With {{a focus on}} diversification in the 1960s, such as the acquisition of Ohio Pattern Works & Foundry Company in 1961, came notable purchases of companies that {{continue to be a}} significant part of Dover Corporation today. The company was shorthanded to OPW, and in 1949 one of its engineers, Leonard H. Duerr, invented the <b>automatic</b> shutoff fuel-dispensing <b>nozzle</b> valve. Today, the basic technology of Duerr's invention continues to exist in <b>automatic</b> shutoff <b>nozzles,</b> and OPW is still a part of Dover, specializing in the design and manufacture of commercial and retail-fueling solutions.|$|R

5000|$|Non-pressurized refuel systems reduce fuel spills and {{provided}} more accurate filling when used with worn <b>automatic</b> refuel <b>nozzles.</b> The system is also {{designed to prevent}} overfilling or manual override of the fueling system. David Juleff of Shaw Development, LLC [...] was the design engineer that tailored an aerospace non-pressurized refuel system to be first introduced on the Caterpillar D11 track type tractor in 1998. A number of non pressure fueling systems are available in OEM and retrofit applications from FloMeg, Shaw Delelopment, Hydrau-FloÂ®, FastFillSystems http://fastfillsytems.com and others ...|$|R
50|$|Pressurized refuel systems operate via {{sealing the}} fuel tank at the {{appropriate}} fill point thus creating internal pressure. The <b>automatic</b> shut off <b>nozzle</b> shuts off when pressure in the fuel system reaches 9 psi (62 kPa) or greater. Due to the pressure introduced into {{the fuel tank}}, most tanks require additional structure to prevent bursting or damaged weld joints.|$|R

40|$|The Department of Energy Idaho Operations Office (DOE-ID) {{is making}} {{preparations}} to close two underground high-level waste (HLW) storage tanks at the Idaho National Engineering and Environmental Laboratory (INEEL) to meet Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) regulations and Department of Energy (DOE) orders. Closure {{of these two}} tanks is scheduled for 2004 as the first phase in closure of the eleven 300, 000 gallon tanks currently in service at the Idaho Nuclear Technology and Engineering Center (INTEC). Design, development, and deployment of a remotely operated tank cleaning system were completed in August 2001. The system incorporates many commercially available components, which have been adapted for application in cleaning high-level waste tanks. The system also uses existing waste transfer technology (steam-jets) to remove tank heel solids from the tank bottoms during the cleaning operations. By using this existing transfer system and commercially available equipment, the cost of developing custom designed cleaning equipment can be avoided. Remotely operated directional spray <b>nozzles,</b> <b>automatic</b> rotating wash balls, video monitoring equipment, decontamination spray-rings, and tank specific access interface devices have been integrated to provide a system that efficiently cleans tank walls and heel solids in an acidic, radioactive environment. This system is also compliant with operational and safety performance requirements at INTEC. Through the deployment of the tank cleaning system, the INEEL High Level Waste Program has demonstrated the capability to clean tanks to meet RCRA clean closure standards and DOE closure performance measures. The tank cleaning system deployed at the INTEC offers unique advantages over other approaches evaluated at the INEEL and throughout the DOE Complex. The system's ability to agitate and homogenize the tank heel sludge will simplify verification-sampling techniques and reduce the total quantity of samples required to demonstrate compliance with the performance standards. This will reduce tank closure budget requirements and improve closure-planning schedules...|$|R
40|$|The Department of Energy, Idaho Operations Office (DOE-ID) is in {{the process}} of closing two {{underground}} high-level waste (HLW) storage tanks at the Idaho National Engineering and Environmental Laboratory (INEEL) to meet Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) regulations and Department of Energy orders. Closure of these two tanks is scheduled for 2004 as the first phase in closure of the eleven 1. 14 million liter (300, 000 gallon) tanks currently in service at the Idaho Nuclear Technology and Engineering Center (INTEC). The INTEC Tank Farm Facility (TFF) Closure sequence consists of multiple steps to be accomplished through the existing tank riser access points. Currently, the tank risers contain steam and process waste lines associated with the steam jets, corrosion coupons, and liquid level indicators. As necessary, this equipment will be removed from the risers to allow adequate space for closure equipment and activities. The basic tank closure sequence is as follows: Empty the tank to the residual heel using the existing jets; Video and sample the heel; Replace steam jets with new jet at a lower position in the tank, and remove additional material; Flush tank, piping and secondary containment with demineralized water; Video and sample the heel; Evaluate decontamination effectiveness; Displace the residual heel with multiple placements of grout; and Grout piping, vaults and remaining tank volume. Design, development, and deployment of a remotely operated tank cleaning system were completed in June 2002. The system incorporates many commercially available components, which have been adapted for application in cleaning high-level waste tanks. The system is cost-effective since it also utilizes existing waste transfer technology (steam jets), to remove tank heel solids from the tank bottoms during the cleaning operations. Remotely operated directional spray <b>nozzles,</b> <b>automatic</b> rotating wash balls, video monitoring equipment, decontamination spray-rings, and tank -specific access interface devices have been integrated to provide a system that efficiently cleans tank walls and heel solids in an acidic, radioactive environment. Through the deployment of the tank cleaning system, the INEEL High Level Waste Program has cleaned tanks to meet RCRA clean closure standards and DOE closure performance measures. Design, development, and testing of tank grouting delivery equipment were completed in October 2002. The system incorporates lessons learned from closures at other DOE facilities. The grout will be used to displace the tank residuals remaining after the cleaning is complete. To maximize heel displacement to the discharge pump, grout was placed in a sequence of five positions utilizing two riser locations. The project is evaluating the use of six positions to optimize the residuals removed. After the heel has been removed and the residuals stabilized, the tank, piping, and secondary containment will be grouted...|$|R
