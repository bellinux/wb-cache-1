5|$|This {{is a most}} {{important}} building {{for the history of}} Australian architecture, being <b>an</b> <b>extreme</b> <b>example</b> of High Victorian architecture. There were never many hotels of its standard in Australia and to my knowledge this is the last of them.|$|E
5|$|<b>An</b> <b>extreme</b> <b>example</b> of an {{equatorial}} bulge {{is found}} on the star Regulus A (α Leonis A). The equator of this star has a measured rotational velocity of 317±3km/s. This corresponds to a rotation period of 15.9 hours, which is 86% of the velocity at which the star would break apart. The equatorial radius of this star is 32% larger than polar radius. Other rapidly rotating stars include Alpha Arae, Pleione, Vega and Achernar.|$|E
5|$|Some {{examples}} of such solar clusters are the Charanka Solar Park, where there are 17 different generation projects; Neuhardenberg, with eleven plants, and the Golmud solar parks with total reported capacity over 500MW. <b>An</b> <b>extreme</b> <b>example</b> is calling all of the solar farms in the Gujarat state of India a single solar park, the Gujarat Solar Park.|$|E

5|$|Initial casting for {{the film}} began in 1971, and Jack Nance was quickly {{selected}} for the lead role. However, {{the staff at the}} AFI had underestimated the project's scale—they had initially green-lit Eraserhead after viewing a twenty-one page screenplay, assuming that the film industry's usual ratio of one minute of film per scripted page would reduce the film to approximately twenty minutes. This misunderstanding, coupled with Lynch's own meticulous direction, caused the film to remain in production for a number of years. In <b>an</b> <b>extreme</b> <b>example</b> of this labored schedule, one scene in the film begins with Nance's character opening a door—a full year passed before he was filmed entering the room. Nance, however, was dedicated to producing the film and retained the unorthodox hairstyle his character sported for the entirety of its gestation.|$|E
5|$|Like all catalysts, enzymes {{increase}} the reaction rate by lowering its activation energy. Some enzymes {{can make their}} conversion of substrate to product occur many millions of times faster. <b>An</b> <b>extreme</b> <b>example</b> is orotidine 5'-phosphate decarboxylase, which allows a reaction that would otherwise take millions of years to occur in milliseconds. Chemically, enzymes are like any catalyst and are not consumed in chemical reactions, nor do they alter the equilibrium of a reaction. Enzymes differ from most other catalysts by being much more specific. Enzyme activity can be affected by other molecules: inhibitors are molecules that decrease enzyme activity, and activators are molecules that increase activity. Many therapeutic drugs and poisons are enzyme inhibitors. An enzyme's activity decreases markedly outside its optimal temperature and pH.|$|E
5|$|Pairs did not {{cooperate}} in feeding, {{at least not}} in a strict sense. All such reports are based on misunderstanding of an account by ornithologist Walter Buller of a pair kept in captivity obtaining wood-boring beetle larvae. According to this misunderstanding, which has become part of ecological folklore, the male would tear at the wood and open larval tunnels, thus allowing the female to probe deeply into the tunnels with her long, pliant bill. Rather, the divergent bills represent <b>an</b> <b>extreme</b> <b>example</b> of niche differentiation, reducing intraspecific competition between the sexes. This allowed the species to exploit a wide range of food sources in different microhabitats.|$|E
25|$|Driving Nixies {{outside of}} their {{specified}} electrical parameters will accelerate their demise, especially excess current, which increases sputtering of the electrodes. <b>A</b> few <b>extreme</b> <b>examples</b> of sputtering have even resulted in complete disintegration of Nixie-tube cathodes.|$|R
5000|$|<b>A</b> very <b>extreme</b> <b>example</b> of <b>an</b> almost [...] "zen" [...] or [...] "poetic" [...] {{approach}} to amplifier {{design in the}} far east—very different from the Western engineering-led approach—is the work of Susumu Sakuma, although Sakuma's designs are far from mainstream ...|$|R
50|$|<b>A</b> {{particularly}} <b>extreme</b> <b>example</b> by Ottó Bláthy {{is illustrated}} in the adjacent diagram. In the initial position Black has all sixteen pieces remaining and White has just a single pawn on its starting square, yet it is White who will deliver checkmate.|$|R
5|$|Roddenberry {{intended}} {{the show to}} have a progressive political agenda reflective of the emerging counter-culture of the youth movement, though he was not fully forthcoming to the networks about this. He wanted Star Trek to show humanity what it might develop into, if it would learn from {{the lessons of the}} past, most specifically by ending violence. <b>An</b> <b>extreme</b> <b>example</b> is the alien species, the Vulcans, who had a violent past but learned to control their emotions. Roddenberry also gave Star Trek an anti-war message and depicted the United Federation of Planets as an ideal, optimistic version of the United Nations. His efforts were opposed by the network because of concerns over marketability, e.g., they opposed Roddenberry's insistence that Enterprise have a racially diverse crew.|$|E
5|$|Some frogs {{have become}} adapted for {{burrowing}} {{and a life}} underground. They tend to have rounded bodies, short limbs, small heads with bulging eyes, and hind feet adapted for excavation. <b>An</b> <b>extreme</b> <b>example</b> {{of this is the}} purple frog (Nasikabatrachus sahyadrensis) from southern India which feeds on termites and spends almost its whole life underground. It emerges briefly during the monsoon to mate and breed in temporary pools. It has a tiny head with a pointed snout and a plump, rounded body. Because of this fossorial existence, it was first described in 2003, being new to the scientific community at that time, although previously known to local people.|$|E
5|$|The early European {{settlers}} killed emus {{to provide}} food and used their fat for fuelling lamps. They {{also tried to}} prevent them from interfering with farming or invading settlements in search of water during drought. <b>An</b> <b>extreme</b> <b>example</b> of this was the Emu War in Western Australia in 1932. Emus flocked to the Chandler and Walgoolan area during a dry spell, damaging rabbit fencing and devastating crops. An attempt to drive them off was mounted, with the army called in to dispatch them with machine guns; the emus largely avoided the hunters and won the battle. Emus are large, powerful birds, and their legs are among the strongest of any animal and powerful enough to tear down metal fencing. The birds are very defensive of their young, and there have been two documented cases of humans being attacked by emus.|$|E
25|$|<b>A</b> more <b>extreme</b> <b>example</b> is the {{azeotrope}} of 1.2% {{water with}} 98.8% diethyl ether. Ether holds {{the last bit}} of water so tenaciously that only a very powerful desiccant such as sodium metal added to the liquid phase can result in completely dry ether.|$|R
5000|$|<b>A</b> less <b>extreme</b> <b>example</b> covers: [...] = 2/3, [...] = 4/3, [...] = 1 = [...] Assume [...] {{quantify}} thousands, each. Circles represent prey and predator initial conditions from [...] = [...] =0.9 to 1.8, in {{steps of}} 0.1. The fixed point is at (1,1/2).|$|R
50|$|Many {{computer}} programs have a skeuomorphic {{graphical user interface}} that emulates the aesthetics of physical objects. Examples include a digital contact list resembling a rolodex, and the 1998 RealThings package. <b>A</b> more <b>extreme</b> <b>example</b> is found in some music synthesis and audio processing software packages, which closely emulate physical musical instruments and audio equipment complete with buttons and dials.|$|R
5|$|While parody {{sometimes}} {{served as}} {{a special kind of}} translation, some translations returned the compliment by providing a parodic version of the Elegy in their endeavour to accord to the current poetic style in the host language. <b>An</b> <b>extreme</b> <b>example</b> was provided by the classicised French imitation by the Latin scholar John Roberts in 1875. In place of the plain English of Gray’s “And all that beauty, all that wealth e’er gave”, he substituted the Parnassian Tous les dons de Plutus, tous les dons de Cythère (All the gifts of Plutus and of Cytherea) and kept this up throughout the poem in a performance that its English reviewer noted as bearing only the thinnest relation to the original.|$|E
5|$|When {{an object}} is in {{hydrostatic}} equilibrium, a global layer of liquid covering its surface would form a liquid {{surface of the}} same shape as the body, apart from small-scale surface features such as craters and fissures. If the body does not rotate, {{it will be a}} sphere, but the faster it rotates, the more oblate or even scalene it becomes. If such a rotating body were to be heated until it melted, its overall shape would not change when liquid. The extreme example of a non-spherical body in hydrostatic equilibrium is , which is twice as long along its major axis as it is at the poles. If the body has a massive nearby companion, then tidal forces come into effect as well, distorting it into a prolate spheroid. An example of this is Jupiter's moon Io, which is the most volcanically active body in the Solar System due to effects of tidal heating. Tidal forces also cause a body's rotation to gradually become tidally locked, such that it always presents the same face to its companion. <b>An</b> <b>extreme</b> <b>example</b> of this is the Pluto–Charon system, where both bodies are tidally locked to each other. Earth's Moon is also tidally locked, as are many satellites of the gas giants.|$|E
25|$|<b>An</b> <b>extreme</b> <b>example</b> of {{overuse of}} the mal- suffix.|$|E
25|$|Many discussions {{have focused}} on whether the attack should be {{described}} {{as an example of}} a hate crime and has been compared to the murder of the punk Brian Deneke in the United States. It has been widely perceived by goths as <b>a</b> more <b>extreme</b> <b>example</b> of the social intolerance, violence and abuse people can suffer as a result of their attachment to the goth subculture.|$|R
50|$|In <b>a</b> more <b>extreme</b> <b>example,</b> {{with the}} pre-regulated 1970s American {{telephone}} system, Bell owned all the hardware (including all phones) and had indirect {{control over the}} information sent through their infrastructure. A landmark case was Hush-A-Phone v. United States, wherein Bell unsuccessfully sued a company producing plastic telephone attachments. In the case of Bell, it was an openly government sanctioned and regulated monopoly by the Communications Act of 1934.|$|R
50|$|The term is also applied, often disparagingly, to {{films that}} are pitched and {{developed}} almost entirely upon an engaging high-concept premise with broad appeal, rather than standing upon complex character study, cinematography, or other strengths that relate {{more to the}} artistic execution of <b>a</b> production. <b>Extreme</b> <b>examples</b> of high-concept films are Snakes on a Plane and Hobo with a Shotgun, which describe their entire premises in their titles.|$|R
25|$|The Rescue Mission in Milwaukee, Minnesota is <b>an</b> <b>extreme</b> <b>example</b> {{of helping}} the {{homeless}} through religion. In order to receive a free meal at the Rescue Mission, clients must first attend a Christian prayer service.|$|E
25|$|Using {{variation}} selectors, it {{is possible}} to specify certain variant CJK ideograms within Unicode. The Adobe-Japan1 character set proposal, which actually calls for 14,679 ideographic variation sequences, is <b>an</b> <b>extreme</b> <b>example</b> of the use of variation selectors.|$|E
25|$|Karl Dane's rapid career decline, {{depression}} and subsequent death {{have been cited}} as <b>an</b> <b>extreme</b> <b>example</b> of the fate that befell many silent film stars who were unable {{to make the transition}} from silent to sound films.|$|E
40|$|New {{observations}} are reported which support {{the view that}} the high-redshift IRAS source FSC 10214 + 4724 is <b>a</b> rare <b>extreme</b> <b>example</b> of the class of ultraluminous infrared galaxies observed in the local universe. The presence of two continuum components and a compact H-alpha source suggests that a merger between two or more gas-rich systems has triggered the production of a powerful dust-enshrouded quasar which is responsible for the bulk of the luminosity...|$|R
5000|$|Often, however, a more esoteric {{method of}} mirror {{punishment}} is used, which implies punishing {{the part of}} the criminal’s body used to commit the crime. <b>Extreme</b> <b>examples</b> include the amputation of the hands of a thief, as still permitted by Sharia law, or during the Middle Ages in Europe; or disabling the foot or leg of a runaway slave. Other examples include the punishment of adulterous women by the insertion of irritating substances into their vaginas (in the past hot pokers were sometimes used). <b>A</b> less <b>extreme</b> <b>example</b> is putting soap into a child’s mouth for using inappropriate language (referred to in English as “washing someone’s mouth out with soap”).|$|R
5000|$|Items such as codpieces {{may suggest}} the assumed superiority of one gender-role over another: or {{symbolic}} leadership (implied by implied potency) within patriarchal structures. <b>A</b> slightly less <b>extreme</b> <b>example,</b> but one {{more common in}} modern times, expresses power relationships (and thus leadership symbolism) {{through the use of}} the phrase [...] "wearing the trousers".|$|R
25|$|Preferably, {{the name}} also conveys some {{information}} about the structure or chemistry of a compound. CAS numbers form <b>an</b> <b>extreme</b> <b>example</b> of names that do not perform this function: each CAS number refers to a single compound but none contain information about the structure.|$|E
25|$|These {{different}} waves (compression {{waves and}} the different polarizations of shear waves) may have different speeds at the same frequency. Therefore, they arrive at an observer at different times, <b>an</b> <b>extreme</b> <b>example</b> being an earthquake, where sharp compression waves arrive first, and rocking transverse waves seconds later.|$|E
25|$|Drying {{produces}} a decided {{increase in the}} strength of wood, particularly in small specimens. <b>An</b> <b>extreme</b> <b>example</b> {{is the case of}} a completely dry spruce block 5cm in section, which will sustain a permanent load four times as great as a green (undried) block of the same size will.|$|E
2500|$|An Israeli {{government}} spokesman said that [...] "the incident was <b>a</b> ′very <b>extreme</b> <b>example</b> of how Hamas operates′", and [...] "If you take over - I presume with guns - a UN facility. If {{you hold the}} people there as hostages, you shoot out of that facility at Israeli soldiers in the neighbourhood, then you receive incoming fire". An Israeli Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesperson said that a Hamas squad was firing mortar shells from the immediate vicinity of the school.|$|R
50|$|Gregory House, {{the main}} {{character}} of the medical drama House M.D., was stricken with a limb infarction in his right quadriceps muscle. The infarction became advanced. Muscle death occurred and the doctors at the hospital tried a risky procedure {{in order to save}} his leg. The quadriceps was removed, forcing House to walk with a cane. The condition plays a large {{role in the development of}} his character. It should be noted that the injury suffered by House is <b>a</b> rather <b>extreme</b> <b>example</b> of limb infarction.|$|R
50|$|Mosquito fleet {{operations}} in the Coos Bay area and Coquille River valley continued up into the 1930s, {{due to the lack}} of good roads and other more modern transportation in these areas. <b>As</b> possibly the <b>extreme</b> <b>example,</b> the small (14 tons) gasoline-propeller Welcome, built 1919, was on the run up the Coos River from Marshfield to Allegany until 1948.|$|R
