5|$|Some ions are classed as amphoteric, {{being able}} to react with either an acid or a base. This is <b>also</b> <b>true</b> <b>of</b> some {{compounds}} with ionic character, typically oxides or hydroxides of less-electropositive metals (so the compound also has significant covalent character), such as zinc oxide, aluminium hydroxide, aluminium oxide and lead(II) oxide.|$|E
5|$|There are {{virtually}} no {{parts of the}} world left where the weapon dance is directly connected with imminent or recent combat. This is especially true of European states, which have long since moved away from the tribalism that usually gives rise to such folk dances. It is, however, <b>also</b> <b>true</b> <b>of</b> {{parts of the world}} where tribal traditions have succumbed to colonialism and the forces of globalism. The dances that one sees today are often part of general movements to preserve and rejuvenate tribal or local traditions. Some of these movements are quite strong now, such as those among native North American tribes and the aboriginal peoples of Australia.|$|E
5|$|Based {{on current}} fossil {{evidence}} from dinosaurs such as Oryctodromeus, some ornithischian species {{seem to have}} led a partially fossorial (burrowing) lifestyle. Many modern birds are arboreal (tree climbing), and this was <b>also</b> <b>true</b> <b>of</b> many Mesozoic birds, especially the enantiornithines. While some early bird-like species may have already been arboreal as well (including dromaeosaurids such as Microraptor) most non-avialan dinosaurs seem to have relied on land-based locomotion. A good understanding of how dinosaurs moved {{on the ground is}} key to models of dinosaur behavior; the science of biomechanics, pioneered by Robert McNeill Alexander, has provided significant insight in this area. For example, studies of the forces exerted by muscles and gravity on dinosaurs' skeletal structure have investigated how fast dinosaurs could run, whether diplodocids could create sonic booms via whip-like tail snapping, and whether sauropods could float.|$|E

25|$|Whether steam {{cars will}} ever be reborn in later {{technological}} eras remains to be seen. Magazines such as Light Steam Power continued to describe them into the 1980s. The 1950s saw interest in steam-turbine cars powered by small nuclear reactors (this was <b>also</b> <b>true</b> <b>of</b> aircraft), but the dangers inherent in nuclear fission technology soon killed these ideas.|$|E
25|$|Youth-driven {{activism}} requires {{young people}} {{to be the primary}} movers within an adult-led movement. Such is the case with the Sierra Club, where youth compel their peers to join and become active in the environmental movement. This is <b>also</b> <b>true</b> <b>of</b> many organizations that were founded by youth who became adults, such as SEAC and National Youth Rights Association.|$|E

25|$|On {{the other}} hand, {{most of the}} Belgic tribal and {{personal}} names recorded are identifiably Gaulish, {{including those of the}} Germani cisrhenani, and this is indeed <b>also</b> <b>true</b> <b>of</b> the tribes immediately over the Rhine at this time, such as the Tencteri and Usipetes. Surviving inscriptions also indicate that Gaulish was spoken in at least part of Belgic territory.|$|E

25|$|The {{negative}} aspects of inequality are spread across the population. For example, when comparing the United States (a more unequal nation) to England (a less unequal nation), the US shows higher rates of diabetes, hypertension, cancer, lung disease, and heart disease across all income levels. This is <b>also</b> <b>true</b> <b>of</b> the difference between mortality across all occupational classes in highly equal Sweden as compared to less-equal England.|$|E
25|$|Widowed {{priests and}} deacons may not remarry {{and it is}} common for such members of the clergy to retire to a monastery (see {{clerical}} celibacy). This is <b>also</b> <b>true</b> <b>of</b> widowed wives of clergy, who do not remarry and become nuns when their children are grown. Only men are allowed to take holy orders, although deaconesses had both liturgical and pastoral functions within the church. However, it has fallen out of practice (the last deaconess was ordained in the 19th century).|$|E
25|$|A caveat {{of the use}} of AirPort Disk is {{that the}} AFP port 548 is {{reserved}} for the service, which then does not allow for simultaneous use of port forwarding to provide AFP services to external users. This is <b>also</b> <b>true</b> <b>of</b> a Time Capsule setup for use as a network-based Time Machine Backup location, its main purpose and default configuration. An AirPort administrator must choose between using AirPort Disk and providing remote access to AFP services.|$|E
25|$|In many ways, Brazilian Portuguese (BP) is {{conservative}} in its phonology. That <b>also</b> is <b>true</b> <b>of</b> Angolan Portuguese, São Tomean Portuguese, and other African dialects. Brazilian Portuguese has eight oral vowels, five nasal vowels, and several diphthongs and triphthongs, some oral and some nasal.|$|R
50|$|Comic {{timing is}} the use of rhythm, tempo, and pausing to enhance comedy and humour. The pacing of the {{delivery}} of a joke can have a strong impact on its comedic effect, even altering its meaning; the same can <b>also</b> be <b>true</b> <b>of</b> more physical comedy such as slapstick.|$|R
50|$|Like trademarks, {{geographical}} indications are regulated locally by each country because conditions of registration such as {{differences in the}} generic use of terms vary from country to country. This is especially <b>true</b> <b>of</b> food and beverage names which frequently use geographical terms, but it may <b>also</b> be <b>true</b> <b>of</b> other products such as carpets (e.g. 'Shiraz'), handicrafts, flowers and perfumes.|$|R
25|$|Since then {{alterations}} to {{the structure}} have been minimal and mostly due to new regulations by the Department of Health or to serve the community better. The main alteration {{to the structure}} was {{the addition of a}} new emergency entrance on the southern side on the Bertoly Street facade. This small addition does not contribute to the value of the property but neither does it hinder the structure's architectural integrity since it was designed and built with a compatible architectural vocabulary. This is <b>also</b> <b>true</b> <b>of</b> the 1928 second floor, which was clearly separated from the 1885 construction by means of visually acceptable wall.|$|E
25|$|Most {{literary}} works {{are written in}} the H-variant. There would have been attempts at writing in the L-variant (such as the masterpiece Macunaíma, written by Brazilian modernist Mário de Andrade and Grande Sertão: Veredas, by João Guimarães Rosa), but, presently, the L-variant is claimed to be used only in dialogue. Still, many contemporary writers like using the H-variant even in informal dialogue. This is <b>also</b> <b>true</b> <b>of</b> translated books, which never use the L-variant, only the H one. Children's books {{seem to be more}} L-friendly, but, again, if they are translated from another language (The Little Prince, for instance) they will use the H-variant only.|$|E
25|$|The {{people from}} {{southern}} Germany, eastern France and Switzerland, from whom the Pennsylvania German culture and dialect sprang, started {{to arrive in}} America in the late 17th and early 18th centuries, {{before the beginning of}} the Industrial Revolution. To a more limited extent, this is <b>also</b> <b>true</b> <b>of</b> a second wave of immigration in the mid-19th century, which came from the same regions, but settled more frequently in Ohio, Indiana {{and other parts of the}} Midwest. Thus, an entire industrial vocabulary relating to electricity, machinery and modern farming implements has naturally been borrowed from the English. For Pennsylvania German speakers who work in a modern trade or in an industrial environment, this could potentially increase the challenge of maintaining their mother tongue.|$|E
25|$|As had <b>also</b> been <b>true</b> <b>of</b> the 1900–1920 period, the Roaring Twenties were a {{favorable}} time for consolidation and even conglomeration throughout the business world. It {{was also a}} time of strongly continuing mechanization on North American farms. At Allis-Chalmers, the 1920s brought yet more tractors, such as the 18-30, the 12-20, the 15-25, and the United tractor/Model U.|$|R

25|$|It {{should be}} noted that the colours of {{lanthanide}} complexes originate almost entirely from charge transfer interactions between the metal and the ligand. f → f transitions are symmetry forbidden (or Laporte-forbidden), which is <b>also</b> <b>true</b> <b>of</b> transition metals, however t-metals are able to use vibronic coupling to break this rule. The valence orbitals in lanthanides are almost entirely non-bonding and as such little effective vibronic coupling takes, hence the spectra from f → f transitions are much weaker and narrower than those from d → d transitions. In general this makes the colours of lanthanide complexes far fainter than those of transition metal complexes. f→f transitions are not possible for the f1 and f13 configurations of Ce3+ and Yb3+ and thus these ions are colourless in aqueous solution.|$|E
25|$|In the USA, the Harrison Act {{was passed}} in 1914, and {{required}} sellers of opiates and cocaine to get a license. While originally intended to regulate the trade, it soon became a prohibitive law, eventually becoming legal precedent that any prescription for a narcotic given by a physician or pharmacist – even {{in the course of}} medical treatment for addiction – constituted conspiracy to violate the Harrison Act. In 1919, the Supreme Court ruled in Doremus that the Harrison Act was constitutional and in Webb that physicians could not prescribe narcotics solely for maintenance. In Jin Fuey Moy v. United States, the court upheld that it was a violation of the Harrison Act even if a physician provided prescription of a narcotic for an addict, and thus subject to criminal prosecution. This is <b>also</b> <b>true</b> <b>of</b> the later Marijuana Tax Act in 1937. Soon, however, licensing bodies did not issue licenses, effectively banning the drugs.|$|E
25|$|Level 9, head of Section One. Accountable only to Oversight. A Vietnam veteran, former Lieutenant Paul L. Wolfe was {{recruited}} into Section One {{against his will}} just before the fall of Saigon. A shrewd and driven man, Operations eventually topples the founder and head of Section One, Adrian, seizing control of the organization himself. While giving {{lip service to the}} aims of Section — the eradication of terrorists and the protection of the innocent — Operations uses Section One as his own power base, gaining considerable control over dictators in many regions of the globe. This lust for power brings him into direct conflict with George, head of Oversight, who on many levels despises him, and even Adrian returns from her forced retirement to mount an unsuccessful coup attempt against Operations. He is also distrustful of Nikita, and even attempts to kill her on a number of occasions, but is grudgingly forced to accept her success at completing Section missions. (The same is <b>also</b> <b>true</b> <b>of</b> Operations' relationship to Michael, when he discovers Michael's romantic involvement with Nikita.) Operations and Madeline make for an effective partnership, though it includes a brief romance that sometimes causes complications.|$|E
50|$|Some {{scholars}} {{argue that}} {{our understanding of the}} enthymeme has evolved over time and is no longer representative of the enthymeme as originally conceived by Aristotle. This is obviously <b>true</b> <b>of</b> the visual enthymeme, only conceived in the early twenty-first century and may <b>also</b> be <b>true</b> <b>of</b> the enthymeme as truncated syllogism. Carol Poster argues that this later interpretation of the enthymeme was invented by British rhetoricians (such as Richard Whately in the eighteenth century.|$|R
50|$|Pionium, a bound {{state of}} two oppositely-charged pions, is {{interesting}} {{for exploring the}} strong interaction. This should <b>also</b> be <b>true</b> <b>of</b> protonium. The <b>true</b> analogs <b>of</b> positronium {{in the theory of}} strong interactions are the quarkonium states: they are mesons made of a heavy quark and antiquark (namely, charmonium and bottomonium). Exploration of these states through non-relativistic quantum chromodynamics (NRQCD) and lattice QCD are increasingly important tests of quantum chromodynamics.|$|R
