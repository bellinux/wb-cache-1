40|$|A recent privacy {{protocol}} for secure e-polls aims at en-suring the <b>submitting</b> <b>individuals</b> that the pollster will pre-serve {{the privacy of}} their submitted preferences. Otherwise the individuals can indict the pollster, provided that the poll-ster participates actively in this phase. The analysis of the protocol in a realistic threat model denounces that a ma-licious pollster that abuses the private preferences by dis-closure will arguably not help out during its own indict-ment. Therefore, the protocol ensures insufficient fairness among their participants because it gives the pollster some advantage over the individuals. Two variant protocols are introduced and analysed in the same threat model — one is found to move the advantage over the individuals, the other is found to achieve a satisfactory level of fairness...|$|R

The design of this DR portal is based on a systematic theory of axiomatic design review (STAR) that defines the DR as a mapping process between the design objects (DOs) and the review criteria (RC). Such a DR portal provides a number of online facilities over the world wide web (WWW or Web) to support various DR decision-making activities, such as uploading and downloading relevant design documents, <b>submitting</b> <b>individual</b> reviews and organizing and conducting DR sessions. The effectiveness and efficiency of the DR process are expected to be greatly improved. © 2002 Elsevier Science B. V. All rights reserved. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
