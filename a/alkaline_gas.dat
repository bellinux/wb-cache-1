Piezoresistive sensor, as a typical pressure sensor, which transduces pressure to resistance signal, has been widely used due to outstanding advantages, such as simple principle, convenient signal collection, low cost, and simple preparation [13, 28, 32, 33]. Additionally, for gas sensor, the alkali gas sensing mechanism of PANI {{can be attributed to}} the conducting mechanism [20].

A chemical transport model that implemented the iron dissolution scheme for dust aerosols suggested significant acid mobilization of iron in the East Asia outflow over the North Pacific, because aerosol water becomes very acidic (pH < 2) due to air pollution (Solmon et al.

A new technology appears very suitable for the remediation of these volatile organic compounds (VOCs). Solid/gas bio-catalysis applied in VOC remediation can transform halogenated compounds directly in the gas phase using dehydrated cells as a bio-catalyst. The hydrolysis of volatile halogenated substrates into the corresponding alcohol was studied in a solid/gas biofilter where lyophilised bacterial cultures were used as the catalyst. Four strains containing dehalogenase enzymes were tested for the hydrolysis of 1 -chlorobutane. The highest removal yield was obtained using the dhaA-containing strains, the maximal reaction rate of 0. 8 micromol min(- 1) g(- 1) being observed with Escherichia coli BL 21 (DE 3) (dhaA).

The objective {{of this research was}} to measure ammonia and other exhaust emissions from a large sample of on-road vehicles using California phase 2 reformulated gasoline with low sulfur content (~ 10 ppm by weight). Vehicle emissions of ammonia, NOx, CO, and CO 2 were measured in the center bore of a San Francisco Bay area highway tunnel on eight 2 -h afternoon sampling periods during summer 1999. Ammonia concentrations were divided by total carbon (mainly CO 2) concentrations to compute an emission factor of 475 ± 29 mg L- 1 (95 % C I.). The molar ratio of nitrogen emitted in the tunnel in the form of ammonia to that emitted in the form of NOx was 0. 27 ± 0. 01. Emissions of NOx and CO have been measured at this tunnel sampling location since 1994. From 1994 to 1999, emissions decreased by 41 ± 4 % for NOx and 54 ± 6 % for CO. These reductions include the impacts of turnover in the vehicle fleet and the use of reformulated gasoline. Between 1997 and 1999, when fuel properties did not change significantly, emissions of NOx and CO decreased by 26 ± 2 % and 31 ± 3 %, respectively. While use of three-way catalytic converters has contributed to decreases in NOx and CO emissions, their use, in combination with fuel-rich engine operation, is the likely cause of the ammonia emissions from motor vehicles observed during this study...|$|E

A novel visualization technique is used, in which an <b>alkaline</b> <b>gas</b> (ammonia) in ppm concentration levels is absorbed into slightly acid water (pH = 4). The concentration gradient in the aqueous mass boundary layer {{is transformed into a}} sharp pH gradient, which is made visible by a fluorescent pH indicator (Pyranine). Regulating the gas flux into the water allows controlling the thickness of the fluorescent layer. By observing the fluorescence induced by high power LEDs on a 2 D surface patch ((21 x 25) cm²) with a camera from above at 100 fps and a spatial resolution of 150 μm, the processes creating near-surface turbulence can be studied even at a wavy water surface. Results from an extensive set of experiments are presented, covering wind speeds from 0. 4 - 8. 6 m/s, different concentrations of a soluble surfactant, and waves with limited and unlimited fetch. The fluorescence footprints of different processes known to contribute to gas exchange, e. g. Langmuir circulations and microscale breaking, are identified. It is found that the transition of the Schmidt number exponent, which is essential for the scaling of transfer velocities of different gases, from 2 / 3 to 1 / 2 is correlated with the frequency of microscale breaking. Surfactants shift the onset of surface renewal events to higher wind speeds.

To differ between oxidation and hydrolysis reactions we analyzed first the hydrolysis reaction of DNT and TNT.

Livestock are the largest source of ammonia in the UK, mainly originating during storage and spreading of animal manure. The aim of this study was to validate the collection efficiency of recurved passive ammonia flux (PAF) samplers and the flux frame method to provide a robust methodology for measurement of distributed agricultural sources of ammonia outdoors. The collection efficiency of recurved PAF samplers was determined in a wind tunnel under controlled conditions of ammonia flux (0. 771 - 13. 49 mg NH 3 m- 2 s- 1), and at angles of orientation to the flow direction (0, 30, 60, 70, 80, 90 °). The samplers were effective up to a wind speed of 7 m s- 1 and an angle of 80 °, with a mean collection efficiency of 71 %. The flux frame method had a mean collection efficiency of 87. 4 % when used with ground level point sources under controlled conditions in the Atmospheric Flow Laboratory. However, in controlled field releases, the efficiency fell to 56. 4 %. The flux frame method was also suitable for line sources, although assumptions must be made about the source homogeneity and plume dispersion. ADMS modelling was used to predict the collection efficiencies for the flux frame method and these agreed with measured collection efficiencies to within 37. 3 %. A comparison of source strengths determined using a full size flux frame and portions of the flux frame showed that a full size flux frame was unnecessary as one column of samplers produced a very similar estimate to that of the whole frame. The validated method was then used to measure ammonia emissions from free-range pigs. The amount of ammonia emitted from this source was very low and less than 0. 16 g (kg of sow) - 1 day- 1.

40|$|The {{most common}} <b>alkaline</b> trace <b>gas</b> in the earth's {{atmosphere}} is ammonia (NH_ 3). Most of the emitted NH_ 3 {{is removed from}} the atmosphere by heterogeneous reactions implying that the atmospheric budget of NH_ 3 is slightly affected by the gas-phase processes. However the global budgets of NO_x and N_ 2 O are influenced by the gas-phase degradation of NH_ 3. It is likeley that up to 10 % of the antropogenic emission of these trace gases is due to the NH_ 3 degradation. In this work, a simple box model is used for the model calculations. The gas-phase chemical mechanism of the regional acid deposition model RADM 2 is complemented by 27 reactions of NH_ 3 and the products of its initial reaction with OH. For the first time, the isomerization reaction of NH_ 2 O forming NHOH is used in a mechanism for the simulation of the gas-phase degradation of NH_ 3. It is shown that the value of the rate constant of this reaction influences substantial by the production of N_ 2 O from the NH_ 3 degradation. Using the results of this work, a very simple estimation leads to a global source strength of NO_x of (0. 3 - 33) "* 10 " 1 " 2 g N yr"-" 1 from the degradation of NH_ 3.

Moreover, metabolic investigations should provide reliable information on patient’s dietary habits, guide towards the best therapeutic approach and enable the physician to verify patient’s compliance to prescribed therapies. An extensive metabolic evaluation is recommended in patients with active stone disease (namely, at least one new stone within the last two years), or in those having had a single stone episode occurred in peculiar conditions: familial history of disease, childhood, menopause, pregnancy, systemic diseases. Simplified protocols may be adequate in non-active nephrolithiasis or in patients with single stone and no relevant risk factors. In our Stone Centre, a so-called “first level screening” is performed by routine, in order to assess urinary supersaturation with stone forming salts and evaluate the excretion of dietaryrelated metabolites in urine.

40|$|Therefore a new {{modified}} LIF {{technique has}} been developed for the visualization of simplified turbulence structures of the aqueous mass boundary layer. The technique {{is based on a}} system of chemical reactions to feature binary concentration fields. With penetrating through air-water interface, an <b>alkaline</b> tracer <b>gas</b> (in current studies - ammonia) changes a temporal equilibrium of chemical species in the water that defines local [H+] concentration. A shift in [H+] concentration, consequently a shift in pH value can be captured with high resolution imaging by the use of fluorescent pH indicator Pyranine (8 -hydroxy- 1, 3, 6 -trisulfonated pyrene). More importantly, logarithmic dependence of the pH value on [H+] concentration provides a rapid increase of pH value that insures sharp change in fluorescent component of Pyranine, hence proximate binary fluorescent field. This contribution reports two pieces of work. Firstly test experiments were performed at the small Benjamin linear wind-wave tunnel in order to verify the technique and to set it up in an optimum way. Secondly, an approach is introduced to reconstruct 3 D- image sequences in order to fully capture the spatio-temporal turbulent structures in the mass boundary layer. In the Benjamin facility a vertical laser beam at 445 nm was focused to excite Pyranine fluorescence. To capture one dimensional profiles with a high resolution of 4. 4 μm, tilted sided-placed Basler ace acA 2500 - 14 gm cameras with 2. 2 μm pixel size were operated in 320 Hz mode. Experimental 1 D concentration profiles at different conditions were analyzed with defining the range of ammonia and Pyranine concentrations as well as initial conditions to maintain in order to gain binary concentration fields. At the different wind speed the experimental profiles were evaluated to estimate the thickness of the mass boundary layer and to detect boundary layer detachments (surface renewal events). The profiles were also compared to simulation profiles for different gas exchange models to verify the case of simplified binary fields and to understand the behavior of fluorescence within the mass boundary layer. Secondly, a trinocular setup was tested for high-resolution 3 D-reconstruction of sequences of boundary layer images at the large annular Aeolotron wind-wave facility in Heidelberg.

Aliquots of DNA (typically 100 micrograms/ml) were spiked with an internal standard, d 9 - 4 -ABP, and were hydrolyzed in 0. 05 N NaOH at 130 degrees C overnight. The liberated 4 -ABP was extracted with hexane and derivatized using pentafluoropropionic anhydride in trimethylamine for 30 min at room temperature prior to GC-NICI-MS. With in vitro [3 H]N-hydroxy- 4 -ABP modified DNA standards, we observed 59 +/- 7 % (n = 9) recovery of the 4 -ABP and a linear correlation between hydrolyzed 4 -ABP and the adduct levels ranging from about 1 in 10 (8) to 1 in 10 (4) nucleotides (r = 0. 999, n = 9). The method was further validated by comparison of the results with that obtained by the 32 P-postlabeling method.

40|$|The {{domestic}} sector will {{play an important}} role in the decarbonisation and decentralisation of the energy sector in the future. Installation numbers of building-integrated small-scale energy systems such as photovoltaics (PV), wind turbines and micro-combined heat and power (CHP) have significantly increased. However, the power output of PV and wind turbines is inherently linked to weather conditions; thus, the injected power into the public grid can be highly intermittent. With the increasing share of renewable energy at all voltage levels challenges arise in terms of power stability and quality. To overcome the volatility of such energy sources, storage technologies can be applied to temporarily decouple power generation from power consumption. Two emerging storage technologies which can be applied at residential level are hydrogen systems and vanadium-redox-flow-batteries (VRFB). In addition, the building-integrated energy sources and storage system can be combined to form a hybrid renewable energy system (HRES) to manage the energy flow more efficiently. The main focus of this thesis is to investigate the dynamic performance of two emerging energy storage technologies, a hydrogen loop composed of <b>alkaline</b> electrolyser, <b>gas</b> storage and proton exchange membrane (PEM) fuel cell, and a VRFB. In addition, the application of building-integrated HRES at customer level to increase the self-consumption of the onsite generated electricity and to lower the grid interaction of the building has been analysed. The first part deals with the development of a research test-bed known as the Hybrid Renewable Energy Park (HREP). The HREP is a residential-scale distributed energy system that comprises photovoltaic, wind turbine, CHP, lead acid batteries, PEM fuel cell, alkaline electrolyser and VRFB. In addition, it is equipped with programmable electronic loads to emulate different energy consumption patterns and a charging point for electric vehicles. Because of its modular structure different combinations of energy systems can be investigated and it can be easily extended. A unified communication channel based on the local operating network (LON) has been established to coordinate and control the HREP. Information from the energy systems is gathered with a temporal resolution of one second. Integration issues encountered during the integration process have been addressed. The second part presents an experimental methodology to assess the steady state and dynamic performance of the electrolyser, the fuel cell and the VRFB. Operational constrains such as minimum input/output power or start-up times were extracted from the experiments. The response of the energy systems to single and multiple dynamic events was analysed, too. The results show that there are temporal limits for each energy system, which affect its response to a sudden load change or the ability to follow a load profile. Obstacles arise in terms of temporal delays mainly caused by the distributed communication system and should be considered when operating or simulating a HRES at system level. The third part shows how improved system models of each component can be developed using the findings from the experiments. System models presented in the literature have the shortcoming that operational aspects are not adequately addressed. For example, it is commonly assumed that energy systems at system level can respond to load variations almost instantaneously. Thus, component models were developed in an integrated manner to combine theoretical and operational aspects. A generic model layout was defined containing several subsystems, which enables an easy implementation into an overall simulation model in MATLAB®/Simulink®. Experimental methods were explained to extract the new parameters of the semi-empirical models and discrete operational aspects were modelled using Stateflow®, a graphical tool to formulate statechart diagrams. All system models were validated using measured data from the experimental analysis. The results show a low mean-absolute-percentage-error (< 3...|$|R
40|$|Polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins/dibenzofurans (PCDD/Fs) {{are proven}} to possess high {{biological}} toxicity. They are formed {{in large quantities}} in industrial waste combustion processes. The formation of PCDD/F in grate-fired municipal waste incinerators (MWI) is widely investigated unlike the formation in fluidized bed (FB) boilers. This work aims to define the key differences {{in the formation of}} PCDD/Fs between grate-fired and FB boilers using solid waste as fuel. The theoretical part of the work involves a comprehensive review of the formation and reduction of PCDD/Fs in waste combustion. The experimental part consists of participating in two PCDD/F measurement campaigns at FB boiler plants and the analysis of the results. The main PCDD/F formation routes in thermal processes include the high temperature gas phase formation from precursors (pyrosynthesis), the condensation of precursors on surfaces of metal catalysts (precursor mechanism), and the formation from residual carbon in the fly ash in presence of a catalyst (de novo synthesis). Two latter pathways take place in post-combustion zone at temperatures from 200 to 500 ºC and they are suggested to be mainly responsible of the overall PCDD/F formation. The key factors promoting the formation of PCDD/Fs include incomplete combustion of the fuel, oxidizing atmosphere, presence of chlorine, residual carbon in the fly ash, favorable temperature window, and copper catalyst. Copper (chloride) is found to highly enhance the formation of PCDD/Fs. The change in different forms of copper is found to depend on temperature, which could partly explain the ‘temperature window’ of PCDD/F formation. Therefore, the flue gas residence time in this region should be minimized. Sulfur-, nitrogen-, and calcium-based compounds are found to inhibit the formation of PCDD/Fs. SO 2 in the flue gas may participate in the formation of metal sulfates from copper chlorides, thus reducing the active sites of the copper catalysts. Addition of CaO or CaCO 3 into the flue gases may reduce PCDD/Fs due to their capability to adsorb PCDD/Fs or by changing the pH of the fly ash towards the <b>alkaline</b> side. Flue <b>gas</b> cleaning devices, especially electrostatic precipitators (ESP), may offer a favorable framework for PCDD/F formation if operated at temperatures above 200 ºC. Bag house filters with prior injection of additives can effectively reduce PCDD/F emissions (up to 99. 5 %). Catalytic decomposition of PCDD/Fs is the only method that will destroy the PCDD/Fs, not only transfer the problem elsewhere. The PCDD/F congener patterns (fingerprints) from grate-fired boilers and FB boilers possess great similarity, thus the governing formation routes are similar in both cases. The main factors causing dissimilarities in the fingerprints involve fuel properties (amount of copper and chlorine) and fly ash characteristics that are influenced by the combustion technology and feeding of additives. Differences in the gas/solid partitioning between different technologies are suggested to mainly depend on the fly ash characteristics, and differences in the sampling temperatures and methods...|$|R
