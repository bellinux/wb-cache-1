5|$|The DBRS9 {{was made}} {{available}} to consumers and included an <b>adjustable</b> driver's seat and steering.|$|E
5|$|The Futura model gained power <b>adjustable</b> pedals, {{and side}} airbags, with a DVD {{entertainment}} system being offered on upmarket trim levels. The XR8 sedan variant also received the premium audio system.|$|E
5|$|The red-colored {{aluminum}} unisex bicycles {{have three}} gears, an <b>adjustable</b> seat, and a front basket {{as well as}} a headlight and twin red taillights that are powered whenever the bicycle is in motion.|$|E
5|$|This yaw <b>adjustable</b> {{crosswind}} {{landing gear}} would be preset by the crew according to wind observations {{made on the}} ground.|$|E
5|$|Because of {{the longer}} shadow the array casts when tilted at a steeper angle, {{this area is}} {{typically}} about 10% higher for an <b>adjustable</b> tilt array or a single axis tracker, and 20% higher for a 2-axis tracker, though these figures will {{vary depending on the}} latitude and topography.|$|E
5|$|Gas metal {{arc welding}} (GMAW) â€“ {{commonly}} termed MIG (metal, inert gas), uses a wire feeding gun that feeds wire at an <b>adjustable</b> speed and flows an argon-based shielding gas or a mix of argon and carbon dioxide (CO2) over the weld puddle {{to protect it from}} atmospheric contamination.|$|E
5|$|Holt {{continued}} to innovate and worked {{to build a}} tractor that could perform rugged tasks yet was not heavy itself. He fitted <b>adjustable</b> blades onto his tractors and hired them out to grade roads and move soil and rock for construction purposes. By 1916, Holt had sold over 2,000 tractors worldwide.|$|E
5|$|Prodigy: Building onto {{what the}} AT-X offers, the semi-luxury Prodigy, branded the Touring in New Zealand and the Middle East, {{features}} an electrically <b>adjustable</b> driver's seat, dual-zone climate control air conditioning, parking sensors, wood grain interior and full leather upholstery. The Prodigy also sees a chrome grille, and 16-inch alloy wheels along with {{front fog lamps}} as standard.|$|E
5|$|The {{concept car}} had a Connolly Leather-trimmed {{interior}} produced by Callow & Maddox, and was fitted with {{front and rear}} heated windscreens, electric windows, air conditioning, heated electrically <b>adjustable</b> seats with an Alpine CD player. The dashboard was supplied by Veglia.|$|E
5|$|The rear-wheel {{steering}} was {{dropped from the}} production car to save weight and reduce complexity, as was the height <b>adjustable</b> suspension and active aerodynamic technology. The suspension fitted to the production model consisted of front and rear independent suspension, double unequal length wishbones, inboard coil springs and anti-roll bars, with Bilstein gas-filled dampers. The suspension was designed {{in accordance with the}} FIA Group C specifications.|$|E
5|$|The semi-luxury Futura variant {{was heavily}} {{based on the}} XT, and marketed towards families. Futura models gained cruise control, 16-inch alloy wheels, rear power windows and full {{body-coloured}} side-view mirrors and side-protection moldings. But, side-impact airbags and power <b>adjustable</b> pedals were only available as options.|$|E
5|$|An {{extensive}} {{maintenance program}} intended {{to extend the}} service lives of M249s {{has been carried out}} to refurbish rifles, especially units that suffered from wear due to heavy use. In particular the warping of the receiver rails on the early-models was a defect that occurred in heavily used first-generation M249s. This defect however has been completely eliminated on later models and is no longer present on the current-issue M249, which has reinforced rails and full-length welding rather than spot welding. Also being worked on is replacement of the M249's buttstock with a redesigned <b>adjustable</b> stock.|$|E
5|$|Persona 2: Eternal Punishment is a {{role-playing}} {{game where}} the player takes {{control of a}} group of characters exploring the fictional city of Sumaru. The camera follows the party from an <b>adjustable</b> angled overhead perspective. The city in general is navigated using an overworld map. A key element to the story and gameplay is the Rumor system: after the characters hear a rumor, they can spread that rumor around the city using certain characters, and those rumors can grant the characters special items or other positive or negative effects.|$|E
5|$|Plasticity: The synapses between {{parallel}} {{fibers and}} Purkinje cells, and the synapses between mossy fibers and deep nuclear cells, are both susceptible to modification of their strength. In a single cerebellar module, input from {{as many as}} a billion parallel fibers converges onto a group of less than 50 deep nuclear cells, and the influence of each parallel fiber on those nuclear cells is <b>adjustable.</b> This arrangement gives tremendous flexibility for fine-tuning the relationship between the cerebellar inputs and outputs.|$|E
5|$|The 2011 Chevrolet Volt comes {{standard}} with cruise control; remote vehicle start-up system; 17-inch 5-spoke forged painted aluminum wheels; Bluetooth {{wireless technology}} for select phones; audio and navigation {{system with a}} center console capacitive touch panel and DVD and MP3 playback, with voice recognition; OnStar with five years of service; BOSE premium speaker system, with six speakers and sub-woofer; 30 GB hard drive for audio data storage; USB port; three auxiliary, 12-volt, power outlets; power door locks and windows; power <b>adjustable</b> mirrors; programmable time of day charge control; and a 110-volt charge cord.|$|E
5|$|The chassis was {{manufactured}} from aluminium using Alcan's bonded aluminium structure vehicle technology (ASVT), {{and had a}} wheelbase of 2845mm. The {{design for}} the chassis featured rear wheel steering and packaged the fuel tank behind the centre bulkhead. Suspension design largely focused on road use, but a good compromise for racing use was achieved and the suspension height was <b>adjustable.</b> The concept car was fitted with a four-channel anti-lock braking system.|$|E
5|$|The {{elevator}} is {{also very}} narrow in chord like the rudder, and the B-52 suffers from limited elevator control authority. For long term pitch trim and airspeed changes the aircraft uses an all-moving tail with the elevator used for small adjustments within a stabilizer setting. The stabilizer is <b>adjustable</b> through 13 degrees of movement (nine up, four down) and is crucial to operations during {{take off and landing}} due to large pitch changes induced by flap application.|$|E
5|$|The {{inspection}} robot of the European project Robair, funded from 2001 to 2003, {{is designed}} to mount on the wings and fuselage of an aircraft to inspect rows of rivets. To move, the robot uses a flexible network of pneumatic suction cups that are <b>adjustable</b> to the surface. It can inspect the lines of rivets with ultrasonic waves, eddy current and thermographic techniques. It detects loose rivets and cracks.|$|E
5|$|The later Saturn version {{featured}} {{a number of}} changes: an optional easy difficulty setting (providing the player with twice the fire-power and slower fuel consumption), <b>adjustable</b> brightness on the heads-up display; two hidden powerful weapons; hundreds of bug fixes from the PlayStation version; extra sound effects added to helicopters; improvements to the graphics of control and menu screens and compass; stereo and mono versions; cow sound effects; and more improvised fuel added to level 4. It was also compatible with the Saturn's then-recent analogue controllers. The game {{was followed by a}} further sequel, Nuclear Strike, released for the PlayStation in late 1997.|$|E
5|$|To promote {{comfortable}} and accurate shooting from {{a standing position}} match air pistols must have fast lock times, shoot practically recoilless and vibration free and exhibit minimal movement and balance shifts during discharge. The pistol must {{also be able to}} be tailored by <b>adjustable</b> user interfaces and various accessories to individual shooters personal preferences. Combined with appropriate match pellets the pistol has to produce a consistent 10 ring performance, so a non maximal result during the initial phase {{can be attributed to the}} participant.|$|E
5|$|Warner {{invented the}} single and double wing formations, the three-point stance, {{and the modern}} body block technique. He {{introduced}} several plays, such as the trap run, the bootleg, the naked reverse, and the screen pass. He {{was among the first}} to use the huddle, to number plays, and to teach the spiral pass and spiral punt. He improved shoulder and thigh pads; and was the first to utilize <b>adjustable</b> fiber, rather than cotton. He also had his own helmet color-coding: red for backs and white for ends.|$|E
5|$|Bertie the Brain was {{an early}} {{computer}} game, {{and one of the}} first games developed in the early history of video games. It was built in Toronto by Josef Kates for the 1950 Canadian National Exhibition. The four meter tall computer allowed exhibition attendees to play a game of tic-tac-toe against an artificial intelligence. The player entered a move on a lit keypad in the form of a three-by-three grid, and the game played out on a grid of lights overhead. The machine had an <b>adjustable</b> difficulty level. After two weeks on display by Rogers Majestic, the machine was disassembled at the end of the exhibition and largely forgotten as a curiosity.|$|E
5|$|Cunningham was {{promoted}} to acting squadron leader in September 1940, commanding B Flight. Within the month the unit received the heavily armed and powerful Bristol Beaufighter. After the commanding officer, Cunningham was the second man to fly it. The Beaufighter went through a teething stage in relation to its gun sight. The sight projected a ring of light with a spot at the centre onto a small sheet of glass {{directly in front of}} the pilots head. The spot in the centre provided the aiming point, and the ring, of variable diameter, helped him to judge the rage and amount of deflection needed to attack a target. The light's brilliance was <b>adjustable</b> by rheostat, but the control was ineffective. Rotating it a fraction could produce maximum brilliance or cause the spot to flicker out.|$|E
5|$|The Ford Model T, {{produced}} from 1908 through 1927, was {{fitted with a}} carburetor with <b>adjustable</b> jetting, allowing use of ethanol, gasoline or kerosene (each by itself), {{or a combination of}} the first two mentioned fuels. Other car manufactures also provided engines for ethanol fuel use. Henry Ford continued to advocate for ethanol as fuel even during the prohibition. However, cheaper oil caused gasoline to prevail, until the 1973 oil crisis resulted in gasoline shortages and awareness on the dangers of oil dependence. This crisis opened a new opportunity for ethanol and other alternative fuels, such as methanol, gaseous fuels such as CNG and LPG, and also hydrogen. Ethanol, methanol and natural gas CNG were the three alternative fuels that received more attention for research and development, and government support.|$|E
5|$|The LS 400 {{was among}} the first luxury sedans to feature an {{automatic}} tilt-and-telescoping steering wheel with SRS airbag, power <b>adjustable</b> shoulder seat belts, and an electrochromic rear-view mirror. The five-passenger cabin included California walnut and leather trim, power-adjustable seats, and soft-touch controls. A back-lit electro-luminescent gauge cluster featured a holographic visual effect, with indicator lights projected onto the instrument panel. The memory system stored the driver's seat, side mirror, steering wheel, and seat belt positions. Available luxury options included a Nakamichi premium sound system and an integrated cellular telephone with hands-free capabilities. The LS 400 further contained some 300 technological innovations to aid smooth operation and silence, including fluid-damped cabin fixtures, vibration-insulating rubber mounts, airflow fairings, and sandwich steel body panels.|$|E
5|$|The iLoo (short for Internet loo) was a {{cancelled}} Microsoft {{project to}} develop a Wi-Fi Internet-enabled portable toilet. The iLoo, which was to debut at British summer festivals, was described as being a portable toilet with wireless broadband Internet, an <b>adjustable</b> plasma screen, a membrane wireless keyboard, a six-channel speaker system, and toilet paper embossed with popular web site addresses. The iLoo was also to have an extra screen and keyboard on the outside, and was to be guarded. It was intended as the next {{in a series of}} successful initiatives by MSN UK which sought to introduce the internet in unusual locations, including MSN Street, MSN Park Bench and MSN Deckchair.|$|E
5|$|The most {{effective}} treatment for obesity is bariatric surgery. The types of procedures include laparoscopic <b>adjustable</b> gastric banding, Roux-en-Y gastric bypass, vertical-sleeve gastrectomy, and biliopancreatic diversion. Surgery for severe obesity {{is associated with}} long-term weight loss, improvement in obesity related conditions, and decreased overall mortality. One study found a weight loss of between 14% and 25% (depending {{on the type of}} procedure performed) at 10years, and a 29% reduction in all cause mortality when compared to standard weight loss measures. Complications occur in about 17% of cases and reoperation is needed in 7% of cases. Due to its cost and risks, researchers are searching for other effective yet less invasive treatments including devices that occupy space in the stomach.|$|E
5|$|Traditionally, devices like a blink {{comparator}} {{were used}} in astronomy to detect objects in the Solar System, because these objects would move between two exposuresâ€”this involved time-consuming steps like exposing and developing photographic plates or films, and people then using a blink comparator to manually detect prospective objects. During the 1980s, the use of CCD-based cameras in telescopes {{made it possible to}} directly produce electronic images that could then be readily digitized and transferred to digital images. Because the CCD captured more light than film (about 90% versus 10% of incoming light) and the blinking could now be done at an <b>adjustable</b> computer screen, the surveys allowed for higher throughput. A flood of new discoveries was the result: over a thousand trans-Neptunian objects were detected between 1992 and 2006.|$|E
25|$|<b>Adjustable,</b> custom-tuned suspension. The shock absorbers' {{response}} and anti-sway bars are manually <b>adjustable.</b>|$|E
25|$|For {{the first}} time, cars {{were allowed to}} use driver <b>adjustable</b> bodywork, {{in the form of}} <b>adjustable</b> flaps in the front wing. The flaps could be {{adjusted}} by up to six degrees, limited to only two adjustments per lap. <b>Adjustable</b> front wings were designed to improve downforce when following another car, another change designed to improve overtaking.|$|E
25|$|SIG P210-8: The deluxe sports version {{chambered}} in 9mm Luger, with a {{side mounted}} magazine catch, wood grips, an <b>adjustable</b> trigger, <b>adjustable</b> sights, and bead blasted finish, built on the heavy frame.|$|E
25|$|Dual <b>adjustable</b> antennas for {{diversity}} reception.|$|E
25|$|Trigger: <b>Adjustable</b> trigger from 2.5 to 5 lbs.|$|E
25|$|Dubbed the Mugen RZ, {{the model}} {{features}} an aerodynamic body kit with a front spoiler, a revised grille and modified side skirts. It {{also features a}} rear diffuser, an <b>adjustable</b> wing and a sports twin exhaust system. Other highlights include an <b>adjustable</b> suspension, high-performance brakes and 17-inch alloy wheels.|$|E
25|$|Loan caps provide payment {{protection}} against payment shock, and allow {{a measure of}} interest rate certainty to those who gamble with initial fixed rates on ARM loans. There are three types of Caps on a typical First Lien <b>Adjustable</b> Rate Mortgage or First Lien Hybrid <b>Adjustable</b> Rate Mortgage.|$|E
25|$|The {{single stage}} trigger is <b>adjustable</b> for weight, creep, and over-travel.|$|E
