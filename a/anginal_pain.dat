50|$|Symptomatic {{treatment}} of visceral pain relies primarily upon pharmacotherapy. Since visceral pain can result secondary {{to a wide}} variety of causes, with or without associated pathology, a wide variety of pharmacological classes of drugs are used including a variety of analgesics (ex. opiates, NSAIDs, benzodiazepines), antispasmodics (ex. loperamide), antidepressants (ex. TCA, SSRI, SNRI) as well as others (ex. ketamine, clonidine, gabapentin). In addition, pharmacotherapy that targets the underlying cause of the pain can help alleviate symptoms due to lessening visceral nociceptive inputs. For example, the use of nitrates can reduce <b>anginal</b> <b>pain</b> by dilating the coronary arteries and thus reducing the ischemia causing the pain. The use of spasmolytics (antispasmodics) can help alleviate pain from a gastrointestinal obstruction by inhibiting the contraction of the gut. There are issues associated with pharmacotherapy that include side effects (ex. constipation associated with opiate use), chemical dependence or addiction, and inadequate pain relief.|$|E

25|$|Angina pectoris can {{be quite}} painful, but many {{patients}} with angina complain of chest discomfort rather than actual pain: the discomfort is usually described as a pressure, heaviness, tightness, squeezing, burning, or choking sensation. Apart from chest discomfort, <b>anginal</b> <b>pains</b> may also be experienced in the epigastrium (upper central abdomen), back, neck area, jaw, or shoulders. This is explained by the concept of referred pain, and {{is due to the}} fact that the spinal level that receives visceral sensation from the heart simultaneously receives cutaneous sensation from parts of the skin specified by that spinal nerve's dermatome, without an ability to discriminate the two. Typical locations for referred pain are arms (often inner left arm), shoulders, and neck into the jaw. Angina is typically precipitated by exertion or emotional stress. It is exacerbated by having a full stomach and by cold temperatures. Pain may be accompanied by breathlessness, sweating, and nausea in some cases. In this case, the pulse rate and the blood pressure increases. Chest pain lasting only a few seconds is normally not angina (such as precordial catch syndrome).|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe {{coronary}} vasomotor {{responses to}} selective infusion of graded concentrations (10 − 6 to 10 − 4 M) of acetylcholine {{into the left}} anterior descending artery were assessed by quantitative coronary arteriography in 24 patients with normal coronary arteriograms (12 patients with atypical symptoms and 12 patients with typical <b>anginal</b> <b>pain)</b> and 36 patients with coronary artery disease with different degrees of atherosclerosis of the left anterior descending artery. In the patients with normal coronary arteries and atypical chest pain, acetylcholine induced predominantly a vasodilator response, which was maximal during a 10 − 5 Macetylcholine infusion. In contrast, in patients with coronary artery disease, acetylcholine caused dose-dependent vasoconstriction, which was observed even if the left anterior descending artery itself was smooth. Marked vasoconstriction was also induced in the patients with typical <b>anginal</b> <b>pain</b> and angiographically normal coronary arteries. In nine of these patients, this constrictor response was associated with <b>anginal</b> <b>pain</b> and elertrocardiographic evidence of myocardial ischemia. Intracoronary administration of isosorbide dinitrate (1 mg) relieved the <b>anginal</b> <b>pain</b> and dilated all vessels. These data suggest that 1) patients with normal coronary arteriograms and angina pectoris manifest impairment of endothelium-dependent vasodilation similar to that observed in patients with overt coronary atherosclerosis; and 2) abnormal coronary vasoconstrictor responses resulting from this impairment {{may contribute to the}} pathogenesis of myocardial ischemia and angina in these patients...|$|E

In 37 other patients, in whom spasm of the coronary artery had been documented at another time, the oral administration of 30 to 60 mg nifedipine led to the suppression of all pain attacks in 26 individuals (71 %) and to a signifuont reduction of these attacks in another four (14 %).

The electrocardiogram (ECG) showed signs of a recent inferior myocardial infarction (Figure 1) after which the patient was treated with antiplatelet agents, a statin, and beta-blockers. To further evaluate the extent of coronary artery disease and ischemia, a cardiac PET/ CT was performed. The imaging protocol consisted of a 64 -slice CT coronary angiography (CTCA) and myocardial perfusion measurements using oxygen- 15 labeled water PET during rest and pharmacologically induced vasodilation (adenosine). During vasodilation, the patient reported <b>anginal</b> chest <b>pain</b> and the ECG displayed ST-segment elevation in the Q-wave leads suggestive of transmural inferior ischemia, although {{it should be noted}} that stress-induced ST segment elevation in Q-leads may also occur in the absence of ischemia.

40|$|In 5 {{patients}} who suffered spontaneous angina during cardiac catheterization, aortic pressure and electrocardiographic lead (V 5) were recorded at rest, {{at the onset}} of <b>anginal</b> <b>pain,</b> 5 and 10 min after 0. 6 mg sublingual nitroglycerin (NTG). Heart rate, systemic arterial pressure, systolic, and diastolic time intervals were measured. Heart rate and systemic arterial pressure rose significantly immediately after the onset of angina and declined progressively within 10 min from NTG administration. Preejection period did not change during angina, while left ventricular ejection time and electromechanical systole lengthened. As a consequence, diastolic time, expressed as percent of cardiac cycle, shortened sharply. All parameters considered went back to basal values within 10 min from NTG administration, and were preceded by relief or reduction of <b>anginal</b> <b>pain.</b> We concluded that a fall in diastolic time, secondary to a prolongation of electromechanical systole occurring during angina, may further increase the degree of ischemia resulting in a vicious cycle than can be interrupted by NTG administration...|$|E

50|$|Angina in {{the setting}} of AS occurs due to left {{ventricular}} hypertrophy (LVH) that is caused by the constant production of increased pressure required to overcome the pressure gradient caused by the AS. While the muscular layer of the left ventricle thickens, the arteries that supply the muscle do not get significantly longer or bigger, so the muscle may not receive enough blood supply to meet its oxygen requirement. This ischemia may first be evident during exercise when the heart muscle requires increased blood supply to compensate for the increased workload. The individual may complain of <b>anginal</b> chest <b>pain</b> with exertion. At this stage, a cardiac stress test with imaging may be suggestive of ischemia.|$|R
40|$|There {{have been}} {{recently}} reports on {{elevated levels of}} cardiac troponins in patients without acute myocardial infarction (AMI). The {{purpose of the study}} was to analyze final diagnoses in patients with elevated cardiac troponin-T levels without clinical manifestations and characteristic ECG changes in AMI. Subjects and materials. The study included 72 patients (48 males and 24 females whose age ranged from 54 to 87 years (mean 69. 8 ± 11. 2 years)). The criterion for inclusion was increased cardiac troponin-T; the primary criteria for exclusion were AMI-specific <b>anginal</b> <b>pains</b> and characteristic ECG changes (ST-segment elevation, abnormal Q waves). The definitive diagnosis of AMI was established only in 29 (40. 3 %) patients; the remaining 43 patients were diagnosed as having the following diseases: sepsis (n= 21), cancer (n= 10), diabetic nephropathy with chronic renal failure (n= 6), cerebral infarction (n= 4), and B 12 -deficiency anemia (n= 2). In deceased patients, the level of troponin-T was higher than that in those who was discharged from hospital irrespective of the underlying disease. Results. There was a direct correlation between the level of cardiac troponin-T and the SAPS II index that reflects the general condition of a patient (r= 0. 44; p= 0. 0001) and an inverse correlation between the former and the left ventricular ejection fraction (r=- 0. 45; p= 0. 003). Conclusion. Thus, despite its cardiac specificity and its detection in the blood of critically ill patients without other manifestations of AMI, cardiac troponin-T is not a specific symptom of AMI, but suggests the severity of the disease, possibly, with the involvement of the myocardium in the pathological process.

40|$|OBJECTIVE [...] To {{investigate}} {{the effects of}} spinal cord stimulation on myocardial ischaemia, coronary blood flow, and myocardial oxygen consumption in angina pectoris induced by atrial pacing. DESIGN [...] The heart was paced to angina during a control phase and treatment with spinal cord stimulation. Blood samples were drawn from a peripheral artery and the coronary sinus. SETTING [...] Multidisciplinary pain centre, department of medicine, Ostra Hospital, and Wallenberg Research Laboratory, Sahlgrenska Hospital, Gothenburg, Sweden. SUBJECTS [...] Twenty patients with intractable angina pectoris, all with a spinal cord stimulator implanted before the study. RESULTS [...] Spinal cord stimulation increased patients' tolerance to pacing (p < 0. 001). At the pacing rate comparable to that producing angina during the control recording, myocardial lactate production during control session turned into extraction (p = 0. 003) and, on the electrocardiogram, ST segment depression decreased, time to ST depression increased, and time to recovery from ST depression decreased (p = 0. 01; p < 0. 05, and p < 0. 05, respectively). Spinal cord stimulation also reduced coronary sinus blood flow (p = 0. 01) and myocardial oxygen consumption (p = 0. 02). At the maximum pacing rate during treatment, all patients experienced <b>anginal</b> <b>pain.</b> Myocardial lactate extraction reverted to production (p < 0. 01) and the magnitude and duration of ST segment depression increased to the same values as during control pacing, indicating that myocardial ischaemia during treatment with spinal cord stimulation gives rise to <b>anginal</b> <b>pain.</b> CONCLUSIONS [...] Spinal cord stimulation has an anti-anginal and anti-ischaemic effect in severe coronary artery disease. These effects seem to be secondary to a decrease in myocardial oxygen consumption. Furthermore, myocardial ischemia during treatment gives rise to <b>anginal</b> <b>pain.</b> Thus, spinal cord stimulation does not deprive the patient of a warning signal...|$|E

40|$|AbstractObjectives. The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{establish}} whether stimulation of cardiac sensory receptors in different myocardial regions results in different distributions of cardiac pain. Background. Previous studies have shown that adenosine provokes cardiac pain through stimulation of sensory receptors in the absence of myocardial ischemia. In this study adenosine was used to obtain a regional stimulation of cardiac sensory receptors. Methods. Increasing doses of adenosine (0. 25, 0. 5 and 1 mg/min) were selectively infused into the right and then into the left coronary artery in 26 patients with stable angina. Results, No patient developed ischemic electrocardiographic changes during either adenosine infusion. Eighteen patients experienced cardiac pain during both infusions. Despite the stimulation of sensory receptors in different myocardial regions, 13 patients experienced cardiac pain in the same body area. Adeno-sine-induced pain was always similar to the <b>anginal</b> <b>pain.</b> By contrast, the remalning five patients experienced adenosine-induced cardiac pain in different body areas. In two of these patients, the distribution of <b>anginal</b> <b>pain</b> was similar to that experienced during one of the two adenosine infusions. In the remaining three patients, the distribution of <b>anginal</b> <b>pain</b> was similar to that experienced during adenosine infusion into the right coronary artery during some anginal episodes and to that experienced during adenosine infusion into the left coronary artery during other episodes. Conclusions. During stimulation by adenosine of sensory receptors in different myocardial regions, the majority of patients experience cardiac pain in the same body area; only a few experience pain in different areas. These differences might be caused by different organizations of the ascending neural pathways to the cortex, Our results suggest that in the same patient different distributions of pain during anginal attacks are probably due to ischemia In different myocardiol regions...|$|E
