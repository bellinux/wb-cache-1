5|$|After {{moving to}} Detroit at age 26, Holmes married into a {{merchant}} family. He later {{got involved in}} both the Detroit Horticultural Society and the Board of Education. In 1849, his background in horticulture and education led him to co-found the Michigan State Agricultural Society, a group dedicated to establishing a state-funded <b>agricultural</b> <b>college</b> in Michigan. Holmes spent {{the next six years}} drafting legislation and gaining support for his cause, and in 1855, the Michigan state governor signed a bill establishing the <b>Agricultural</b> <b>College</b> of the State of Michigan.|$|E
5|$|After the war, Col. William S. Clark {{became a}} {{prominent}} figure in early American/Japanese relations. After establishing the Massachusetts <b>Agricultural</b> <b>College</b> (now the University of Massachusetts Amherst), Clark was invited {{by the government}} of Japan to establish a similar institution, the Sapporo <b>Agricultural</b> <b>College</b> (now the University of Hokkaido). Clark's fame persists in Japan where he is a household name due to the revolutionary western ideas he brought to Hokkaido and the influence he had {{on the development of the}} island. His military experience during the Civil War was an important factor in earning the respect of his Japanese superiors.|$|E
5|$|Holmes {{spent the}} next five years {{gathering}} supporters for his grassroots movement, traveling at his own expense to gather petition signatures from across the state. On January 14, 1855, Holmes went to the state capital of Lansing to lobby the legislature for an <b>agricultural</b> <b>college.</b> He {{spent the next}} four weeks championing the bill he wrote and cementing support in both the House of Representatives and the Senate. Though many legislators supported the basic concept of a state-funded <b>agricultural</b> <b>college,</b> there was strong opposition from University of Michigan president Henry Tappan, who wanted the agriculture program to be part of his school. Nevertheless, Holmes prevailed. On February 12, 1855, Michigan Governor Kinsley S. Bingham signed Act 130, establishing the <b>Agricultural</b> <b>College</b> of the State of Michigan, the school that would become Michigan State University. The final draft of the bill held only two significant differences from the one that Holmes presented: that the purchase price not exceed US $15 per acre, rather than the $25 Holmes desired; and that the site must be within ten miles (16km) of Lansing, a provision added to silence the various factions that wanted the new college built in their own backyards.|$|E
