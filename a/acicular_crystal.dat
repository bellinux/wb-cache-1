50|$|Xonotlite is {{a mineral}} with the {{chemical}} formula Ca6Si6O17(OH)2. It crystallizes in the monoclinic - prismatic crystal system with typically an <b>acicular</b> <b>crystal</b> form or habit. It can be colorless, gray, light gray, lemon white, or pink. It is transparent with a vitreous to silky luster. It leaves a white streak. Xonotlite is rated 6.5 on the Mohs Scale of hardness.

50|$|George-ericksenite is {{a mineral}} with the {{chemical}} formula Na6CaMg(IO3)6(CrO4)2(H2O)12. It is vitreous, pale yellow to bright lemon yellow, brittle, and features a prismatic to <b>acicular</b> <b>crystal</b> habit along 001 and somewhat flattened crystal habit on {110}. It was first encountered in 1984 at the Pinch Mineralogical Museum. One specimen of dietzeite from Oficina Chacabuco, Chile had bright lemon-yellow micronodules on it. These crystals produced an X-ray {{powder diffraction pattern}} that did not match any XRD data listed for inorganic compounds. The X-ray diffraction pattern and powder mount were set aside until 1994. By then, the entire mineral collection from the Pinch Mineralogical Museum had been purchased by the Canadian Museum of Nature. The specimen was then retrieved and studied further. This study was successful and the new mineral george-ericksenite was discovered. The mineral was named for George E. Ericksen who was a research economic geologist with the U.S. Geological Survey for fifty years. The mineral and name have been approved by Commission on New Minerals and Mineral Names (IMA). The specimen, polished thin section, and the actual crystal used for the structure determination are kept in the Display Series of the National Mineral Collection of Canada at the Canadian Museum of Nature, Ottawa, Ontario.|$|E

40|$|Vanadiocarpholite, Mn 2 +V 3 +Al(Si 2 O 6) (OH) 4, {{occurs at}} the Molinello mine (Liguria, Italy) in mm-thick veins and in open {{fissures}} in a silicified wood sample from Mn-ore bearing cherts. Vanadiocarpholite is found as millimetric aggregates of acicular crystals associated with coatings and crystals of dark-green volborthite and quartz; rarely strongly elongated [001] prismatic crystals up to 400 μm are also found. The crystals vary in colour from honey yellow-brown and brown (prismatic crystals) to pale straw-yellow (<b>acicular</b> <b>crystal</b> aggregates); they are brittle (prismatic crystals) to flexible (acicular crystals), transparent and non-fluorescent, with vitreous to silky lustre (prismatic crystals and <b>acicular</b> <b>crystal</b> aggregates, respectively) and nearly white streak; they show a perfect { 010 } cleavage; parting and twinning were not observed. The empirical formula of vanadiocarpholite, derived from microprobe analyses and structural refinement, approaches the ideal formula, Mn 2 +V 3 +Al(Si 2 O 6) (OH) 4; however, a wide compositional range is detected, mainly due to a solid solution with carpholite (V 3 + vs Al substitution). X-ray single crystal data give the refined cell parameters a = 13. 830 (2) Å, b = 20. 681 (3) Å, c = 5. 188 (1) Å and V = 1483. 86 Å 3 in the space group Ccca. Micrometric crystals of vanadiocarpholite were also investigated by transmission and analytical electron microscopy. TEM analyses show a good agreement with WDS and XRD data, but disordered layer stacking sequences are observed. The crystal structure refinement indicates vanadiocarpholite to be isotypic with carpholite, therefore {{it belongs to the}} carpholite group together with carpholite, magnesiocarpholite, ferrocarpholite, balipholite and potassic-carpholite...|$|E

40|$|One-dimensional PbTiO 3 {{nanowires}} 40 – 500 nm {{in diameter}} and, 400 mm in length were synthesized via a hydrothermal strategy and characterized by X-ray diffraction, electron backscatter diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, and transmission electron microscopy. The {{results show that}} the PbTiO 3 nanowires exhibit a new <b>acicular</b> <b>crystal</b> structure, which is a tetragonal superstructure composed of a large unit cell of 40 atoms (Pb: Ti: O 1 : 1 : 3) with a 12. 35 Å, c 3. 83 Å. The PbTiO 3 has a feature of unidirectional bending when observed through transmission electron microscopy several times. The bending can be controlled by the electron beam intensity in transmission electron microscopy and the bending process is reversible. Moreover, a possible mechanism for the bending behaviour was also studied, which indicates that macroscopic polarization is in the { 110 } plane and the direction is not consistent with the electric field, giving the possible driving force for the bending...|$|E
40|$|Calcium {{phosphate}} is {{deposited in}} many diseases, but formation mechanisms remain speculative. Nanobacteria are the smallest cell-walled bacteria, only recently discovered in human and cow blood and commercial cell culture serum. In this study, we identified with energy-dispersive x-ray microanalysis and chemical analysis that all growth phases of nanobacteria produce biogenic apatite on their cell envelope. Fourier transform IR spectroscopy revealed the mineral as carbonate apatite. The biomineralization in cell culture media resulted in biofilms and mineral aggregates closely resembling {{those found in}} tissue calcification and kidney stones. In nanobacteria-infected fibroblasts, electron microscopy revealed intra- and extracellular <b>acicular</b> <b>crystal</b> deposits, stainable with von Kossa staining and resembling calcospherules found in pathological calcification. Previous models for stone formation have led to an hypothesis that elevated pH due to urease and/or alkaline phosphatase activity is a lithogenic factor. Our results indicate that carbonate apatite can be formed without these factors at pH 7. 4, at physiological phosphate and calcium concentrations. Nanobacteria can produce apatite in media mimicking tissue fluids and glomerular filtrate and provide a unique model for in vitro studies on calcification...|$|E
40|$|Acicular nickelous ethyl xanthate, Ni (EtX) _ 2, {{crystals}} often {{grow from}} the acetone solution with usual platy square crystals. The crystal structure of orthorhombic form {{corresponding to the}} platy square crystal has been determined by Franzini (1963). The acicular one found in the present work is determined to be triclinic by the x-ray method. The crystal structure has been solved by the Patterson method and refined using the 4 -circle x-ray diffraction data. Space group: P 1, a= 8. 835, b= 10. 299, c= 8. 143 A, α= 91. 81 °, β= 122. 33 °, γ= 70. 52 °; Z= 2. A residual factor is R= 5. 3 % for observed 2048 structure factors. Four strong Ni-S bonds in the molecule and two weak bonds between neighbouring molecules make an octahedral coordination of NiS_ 6.

40|$|The hydrate-based {{carbon dioxide}} (CO 2) capture from the {{integrated}} gasification combined cycle (IGCC) synthesis gas using the bubble method is investigated {{with a set}} of visual equipment in this work. The gas bubble is created with a bubble plate {{on the bottom of the}} equipment. By the visual equipment, the hydrate formation and the hydrate shape are visually captured. With the move of the gas bubble from the bottom to the top of the reactor, gas hydrate forms firstly from the gas-liquid boundary around the bubble, then the hydrate gradually grows up and piles up in the bottom side of the bubble to form a hydrate particle. The gas hydrate shape is affected by the gas flow rate. The hydrate is <b>acicular</b> <b>crystal</b> at the low gas flow rate while the hydrate is fine sand-like crystal at the high gas flow rate. The bubble size and the gas flow rate have an obvious impact on the hydrate-based CO 2 separation process. The experimental results show the gas bubble of 50 mu m and the gas flow rate of 6. 75 mL/min/L are ideal for CO 2 capture from IGCC synthesis gas under the condition of 3. 0 MPa and 274. 15 K.

Pharmacognostical studies include macroscopical, microscopical observations. Physical chemical constants such as ash values, extractive values, loss on drying, foreign organic matter were determined. Ash values include total ash; acid insoluble and water soluble ash were observed. Extractive values of powder with solvents such as petroleum ether, chloroform, ethyl actetae, ethanol and water were determined. Macroscopical characters help in identifying the leaf.

40|$|Scanning {{electron}} microscopy and energy-dispersive X-ray spectrometry of untreated interior chips {{from three different}} specimens of the Chassigny meteorite confirm the presence of discrete grains of Ca-carbonate, Mg-carbonate, and Ca-sulfate. Morphologies of these salt grains suggest that the Ca-carbonate is calcite (CaCO 3) and that the Ca-sulfate is gypsum (CaSO 4 - 2 H 2 O) or bassanite (CaSO 4 - 1 / 2 H 2 O). The morphologic identification of the Mg-carbonate is equivocal, but rhombohedral and <b>acicular</b> <b>crystal</b> habits suggest magnesite and hydromagnesite, respectively. The salts in Chassigny occur as discontinuous veins in primary igneous minerals and {{are similar to those}} previously documented in the nakhlites, Nakhla and Lafayette, and in shergottite EETA 79001. Unlike those in nakhlites, however, the Chassigny salts occur alone, without associated ferric oxides or aluminosilicates clays. Traces of Cl and P in Chassigny salts are consistent with precipitation of the salts from short-lived, saline, aqueous solutions that postdated igneous crystallization. In contrast with the clear case for nakhlites, stratigraphic evidence for a preterrestrial origin of the salts in Chassigny is ambiguous; however, a preterrestrial origin of the Chassigny salts best explains all available evidence. The water-precipitated salts provide clear physical evidence for the hypothesis, proposed by other workers, that the igneous amphiboles in Chassigny might have experienced isotope-exchange reactions with near-surface water, thereby compromising the original stable-isotope signature of any magmatic water in melt inclusions...|$|E
