50|$|The OM Series lenses had the <b>aperture</b> <b>control</b> <b>ring</b> {{located at}} the front of the lens barrel. This was done to move it away from the shutter speed control, which was a ring on the camera body {{concentric}} with the lens mount. OM lenses also featured a depth-of-field preview button on the lens, in contrast to most other SLR camera systems, in which the button was placed on the camera body.|$|E
50|$|Almost {{all other}} Pentax K mount bayonet lenses will {{function}} properly under manual focusing, with the AF system providing focus indication - Asahi Optical called this TTL Electronic Focus. This includes lenses with the Pentax K-A mount (introduced 1983) and the K-AF/AF2 mounts. However, the newest SMC-Pentax FA J (1997) and SMC-Pentax DA (2004) types, lacking an <b>aperture</b> <b>control</b> <b>ring,</b> have severely restricted functionality. There were over thirty contemporary manual focus Asahi Optical made lenses of the SMC Pentax-M and SMC Pentax-A types.|$|E
50|$|The Voigtländer Ultramatic CS was {{the first}} 35mm leaf shutter SLR camera with TTL metering. The design of the not too heavy camera {{was derived from the}} Voigtländer {{viewfinder}} cameras, with rounded sides and a shifter on the front side as shutter release. Its designer was Walter Swarofsky. A specialty of the camera was that shutter speed and <b>aperture</b> were <b>controlled</b> by <b>rings</b> around the bayonet. The lenses had only a distance <b>control</b> <b>ring.</b> The bayonet is a variant of the Deckel bayonet (DKL) offering mechanical <b>control</b> of both, <b>aperture</b> release and automatic aperture setting. The Septon 1:2/50mm was a well regarded lens, and like the Skopagon 2.0/40mm it was a quite fast lens for that type of SLR. The exposure delay was only 1/50 sec.|$|R

2500|$|For some lenses, {{including}} a few long telephotos, lenses mounted on bellows, and perspective-control and tilt/shift lenses, the mechanical linkage was impractical, and automatic <b>aperture</b> <b>control</b> was not provided. [...] Many such lenses incorporated a feature {{known as a}} [...] "preset" [...] aperture, which allows the lens to be set to working aperture and then quickly switched between working aperture and full aperture without looking at the <b>aperture</b> <b>control.</b> A typical operation might be to establish rough composition, set the working aperture for metering, return to full aperture for a final check of focus and composition, and focusing, and finally, return to working aperture just before exposure. Although slightly easier than stopped-down metering, operation is less convenient than automatic operation. Preset <b>aperture</b> <b>controls</b> have taken several forms; the most common has been the use of essentially two lens aperture rings, with one ring setting the aperture and the other serving as a limit stop when switching to working aperture.

40|$|Proposed {{is a novel}} eye vision testing {{system based}} on micromachines that uses micro-optic, micromechanic, and microelectronic technologies. The micromachines include a {{programmable}} micro-optic lens and <b>aperture</b> <b>control</b> devices, pico-projectors, Radio Frequency (RF), optical wireless communication and control links, and energy harvesting and storage devices with remote wireless energy transfer capabilities. The portable lightweight system can measure eye refractive powers, optimize light conditions for the eye under testing, conduct color-blindness tests, and implement eye strain relief and eye muscle exercises via time sequenced imaging. A basic eye vision test system is built in the laboratory for near-sighted (myopic) vision spherical lens refractive error correction. Refractive error corrections from zero up to − 5. 0 Diopters and − 2. 0 Diopters are experimentally demonstrated using the Electronic-Lens (E-Lens) and <b>aperture</b> <b>control</b> methods, respectively. The proposed portable eye vision test system is suited for children’s eye tests and developing world eye centers where technical expertise may be limited. Design of a novel low-cost human vision corrective eyewear is also presented based on the proposed <b>aperture</b> <b>control</b> concept.

40|$|The ring {{spinning}} {{process has been}} used to produce fine and high quality staple fibre yarns. The stability of the rotating yarn loop (i. e. balloon) between the yarn-guide and the traveller-ring is crucial to the success and economics of this process. Balloon <b>control</b> <b>rings</b> are used to contain the yarn-loop, by reducing the yarn tension and decreasing the balloon flutter instability. Flutter instability here refers to the uncontrolled changes in a ballooning yarn under dynamic forces, including the air drag. Due to the significant variation in the length and radius of the balloon during the bobbin filling process, the optimal location for the balloon <b>control</b> <b>ring</b> is not easily determined. In order to address this difficulty, this study investigates the variation in the radius of a free balloon and examines the effect of balloon <b>control</b> <b>rings</b> of various diameters at different locations on yarn tension and balloon flutter stability. The results indicate that the maximum radius of a free balloon and its corresponding position depend not only on the yarn-length to balloon-height ratio, but also on yarn type and count. A <b>control</b> <b>ring</b> of suitable radius and position can significantly reduce yarn tension and decrease flutter instability of free single-loop balloons. While the balloon <b>control</b> <b>rings</b> are usually fixed to, and move in sinc with, the ring frame, results reported in this study suggest that theoretically, a balloon <b>control</b> <b>ring</b> that always remains approximately half way between the yarn-guide and the ring rail du{{ring spinning}} can lead to significant reduction in yarn tension. <br /...|$|R
5000|$|E — Electromagnetic diaphragm. The {{aperture}} diaphragm of an E lens is controlled digitally by the camera, and actuated electromagnetically {{by a system}} housed within the lens, rather than employing the F-mount's traditional mechanical diaphragm linkage. This system first appeared in certain Perspective Control lenses, designated PC-E (with designs that preclude a mechanical linkage). E-type lenses <b>aperture</b> <b>control</b> is only supported by all DSLRs with CMOS image sensor except the Nikon D90. For all other cameras the lens aperture stays maximum open with normal autofocus and metering. E Lenses with manual <b>aperture</b> <b>control</b> like PC-E lenses allow manual diaphragm operation on all cameras, with possible unreliable metering on DSLRs without E-type support. Otherwise E lenses are similar to G lenses. Not {{to be confused with}} old AI Series E lenses.|$|R
50|$|Exposure {{metering}} is through-the-lens (TTL) {{and thus}} {{accounts for the}} aperture set on the lens in use.

40|$|With the {{increasing}} interest in decreasing {{the environmental impact}} from internal combustion engines as well as increasing the fuel efficiency has led to deeper investigation into {{the components of the}} engine. The mechanical friction in an engine is a major concern, any improvements or reductions in friction can have large implication on the' efficiency of the engines. This thesis focuses on the piston/ ring pack assembly and its contribution to friction. It investigates several key components and trends in friction for the piston/ ring pack assembly, specifically the trends related to the oil <b>control</b> <b>ring</b> and the liner surface. The Floating Liner Engine is used in this study to isolate results from different components. The data collected can be used for comparative analysis and to identify trends in the friction trace. The thesis starts with describing the Floating Liner Engine system at MIT in detail. Both the data collection and the hardware systems are described as well as the test capabilities of the Floating Liner Engine. The results used in the thesis have been collected using the motoring condition. The oil <b>control</b> <b>ring</b> {{plays a key role in}} controlling the supply of oil to the top two rings and hence has a higher tension that the top two rings. This leads to the oil <b>control</b> <b>ring</b> having a significant contribution to the total friction of the system. The two most prevalent oil <b>control</b> <b>rings</b> used in the industry are the twin land oil <b>control</b> <b>ring</b> (TLOCR) and the three piece oil <b>control</b> <b>ring</b> (TPOCR). The thesis investigates the effect of changing liner roughness on the friction of the TLOCR. A comparison between the TLOCR and the TPOCR is also performed using the same liner surfaces. The results from these studies show a marked difference between the friction traces from the two oil <b>control</b> <b>rings.</b> by Sarthak Vaish. Thesis: S.
