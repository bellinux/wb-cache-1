40|$|The {{mobility}} of graphene {{is very high}} because the quantum Hall effects can be observed even at room temperature. Graphene {{has the potential of}} the material for novel devices because of this high mobility. But the energy gap of graphene is zero, so graphene can not be applied to semiconductor devices such as transistors, LEDs, etc. In order to control the energy gaps, we propose <b>atomic</b> <b>monolayers</b> which consist of various materials besides carbon atoms. To examine the energy dispersions of <b>atomic</b> <b>monolayers</b> of various materials, we calculated the electronic states of these <b>atomic</b> <b>monolayers</b> using density functional theory with structural optimizations. The quantum chemical calculation software "Gaussian 03 " was used under periodic boundary conditions. The calculation method is LSDA/ 6 - 311 G(d,p), B 3 LYP/ 6 - 31 G(d), or B 3 LYP/ 6 - 311 G(d,p). The calculated materials are C (graphene), Si (silicene), Ge, SiC, GeC, GeSi, BN, BP, BAs, AlP, AlAs, GaP, and GaAs. These <b>atomic</b> <b>monolayers</b> can exist in the flat honeycomb shapes. The energy gaps of these <b>atomic</b> <b>monolayers</b> take various values. Ge is a semimetal; AlP, AlAs, GaP, and GaAs are indirect semiconductors; and others are direct semiconductors. We also calculated the change of energy dispersions accompanied by the substitution of the atoms. Our results suggest that the substitution of impurity atoms for monolayer materials can control the energy gaps of the <b>atomic</b> <b>monolayers.</b> We conclude that <b>atomic</b> <b>monolayers</b> of various materials have the potential for novel devices.

The capacity of reversibly and sharply switching the magnetic state of FePc molecules by chemical means is conclusively evidenced by X-ray magnetic circular dichroism (XMCD) at the Fe L 2, 3 absorption edge. In the molecular oxygen-dosed phase, oxygen intercalates between the molecule and the surface, thereby switching the Fe magnetic moment from a nearly negligible (mTot exp ≈ 0. 26 (1) μB) to an order of magnitude larger value (mTot exp ≈ 2. 1 (2) μB). Moreover, the characteristic XMCD spectrum undergoes a crossover from metallic to oxidized Fe(III) -like line shape, in accordance with an oxygen-induced decoupling of the molecular electronic states from the underlying metal surface.

Structural characterization of the samples revealed sharp interfaces, almost free from roughness. A strong suppression of the superconducting transition temperature Tc was observed for tAu< 10 A, implying a strong spin-polarization of the Au layer in the vicinity of the Au/Fe interface.
