Deeper qualitative research is required to assess {{the extent to which the}} adoption of <b>internal</b> <b>review</b> reflects an organizational commitment to the model of procedural justice reflected in its structure. Research is also required to explore why citizens challenge welfare decisions, why more citizens do not, and in relation to the few who do, why they do not persevere beyond the initial stages of review...|$|R

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedThe recent emphasis in {{all levels of}} government on accountability of resources has resulted in an increase in concern for internal control. Included in internal control systems is internal auditing. Self-review at a field activity takes the form of <b>Internal</b> <b>Review.</b> This thesis examines the conceptual basis of <b>Internal</b> <b>Review</b> by discussing auditing and more specifically internal auditing in both the Public and Private Sectors followed by a comparison with internal auditing and <b>internal</b> <b>review</b> in the Department of the Navy, including a case study of a Marine Corps Air Station <b>Internal</b> <b>Review</b> Division. Information for this thesis was collected by a library search, numerous phone calls (including calls to the Office of the Director of Internal Audit Policy for the Department of Defense, the Naval Audit Service Headquarters, and the Marine Corps Air Station in the case study), and materials provided by the Naval Audit Service and the Marine Corps Air Station.
