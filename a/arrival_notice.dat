50|$|In {{the eve of}} August 9, Swedish scouts {{confirmed}} possible Danish cavalry {{being on}} their arrival to Fjällsjön. The bridge going over the strait had been destroyed by the Swedish defences at Brobacka consisting of 3,700 mobilized peasants. While Rantzau on his <b>arrival</b> <b>noticed</b> this, he immediately got fired at by the peasants. The Danish soldiers returned an effective fire but chose rather not to stay, thus believing the Swedish army to have been superior. Rantzau then started his crossing of the strait to Östad, however, only one cannon or reiter at the time could cross creating a vulnerable position for the Danes.|$|R
2500|$|At 6am, {{there was}} a shift change in the control room. A new <b>arrival</b> <b>noticed</b> that the {{temperature}} in the pilot-operated relief valve tail pipe and the holding tanks was excessive and used a backup valvecalled a [...] "block valve"to shut off the coolant venting via the pilot-operated relief valve, but around [...] of coolant had already leaked from the primary loop. It was not until 165 minutes after the start of the problem that radiation alarms activated as contaminated water reached detectors; by that time, the radiation levels in the primary coolant water were around 300times expected levels, and the general containment building was seriously contaminated.|$|R
50|$|The town's name {{is said to}} {{have been}} given by the first Euro-American settler, Walter Hewitt, in 1825. Upon his <b>arrival,</b> he <b>noticed</b> what {{appeared}} to be a stone wall along the lake's western bank, possibly constructed by earlier Potawatomi Indian tribes.|$|R
6000|$|... "His Britannic Majesty's ship, Foam, whose <b>arrival</b> we <b>noticed</b> {{a day or}} two since, {{boarded the}} Montauk off the Hook, and took out of her two criminals, one of whom, we are told, was a {{defaulter}} for one hundred and forty thousand pounds, and the other a deserter from the king's service, though a scion of a noble house. More of this to-morrow." ...|$|R

For all the evaluated strategies, resume retransmission is considered and queued sessions are served {{in the order of}} <b>arrival</b> [38]. <b>Notice</b> that, because of non-homogenous bandwidth among primary and secondary channels, there is the possibility that multiple secondary calls be simultaneously preempted by the arrival of a PU.|$|R
5000|$|Frank Harris was a London {{freelance}} journalist who, on his <b>arrival</b> in Manchester, <b>noticed</b> {{the fact that}} the city’s only Jewish newspaper was a freesheet. He determined, against all advice, to establish a Jewish weekly.|$|R
5000|$|... 1992The first Richard James shop {{opens at}} 37a Savile Row.Richard James's <b>arrival</b> is <b>noticed</b> by Nick Sullivan in British Esquire magazine: [...] "There {{is an odd}} {{atmosphere}} these days in Savile Row. Nothing tangible, you understand. But from time to time, people stop to peer with uncertainty, with incomprehension, even with vague horror through the plate glass window of No. 37a. There's a new boy on The Row and he's causing quite a stir." ...|$|R
50|$|Upon her <b>arrival,</b> Emily <b>notices</b> {{that her}} father's sheep are acting rather strangely; {{they appear to}} be viciously {{fighting}} over a weed that is the byproduct of their neighbor's corn. That neighbor began growing corn when provided with a newly generated seed that was meant to be immune to all pesticides. The corn was altered genetically so it could grow with very little water so it could be used in otherwise barren places, such as parts of Africa, to feed starving people.|$|R
2500|$|Upon <b>arrival</b> Steć <b>noticed</b> however how {{the other}} UN {{soldiers}} called the mission as [...] "Mission Impossible" [...] due to the racism, the Hutu Power militia and the human rights abuses. [...] "It felt {{as though we were}} sitting on a barrel of gunpowder, waiting for a spark. (...) the genocide hanged in the air", and [...] "the international community was playing for time, waiting for some final solution to the Rwandan problem". But no one could ever have imagined the scale of what was to come.|$|R
5000|$|No {{more than}} four months after their <b>arrival</b> a <b>notice</b> of caution {{appeared}} in the classifieds section of the Sydney Gazette, undersigned by Campbell and his neighbour Mr Robert Crawford, asking for the immediate removal of all cattle grazing on [...] "the farms of Armady and Milton, situate on the East Creek, in the District of Prospect … having been lately marked off and located to and Crawford". At the time, Bungarribee was known as [...] "Armady" [...] or [...] "Armaddy", taking its name from Campbell's home in Argyllshire, Scotland.|$|R
5000|$|Upon his <b>arrival,</b> he <b>notices</b> that Shanghai {{is divided}} into an {{international}} settlement {{under the control of}} various foreign powers such as Britain and Japan. He also observes that the martial artists' community in Shanghai is marred with disunity and the various schools are pursuing their individual goals. The fractured status of the martial arts community reflects the state of China: the Chinese are individualistic and are often engaging in internal conflict instead of uniting to drive out their common enemies (the overbearing foreigners) and regain sovereignty of their nation.|$|R
5000|$|On {{the evening}} of 30 November 2002, the {{grandparents}} called 911 to report that Jeffrey was no longer breathing. Upon <b>arrival,</b> emergency workers <b>noticed</b> that his body was [...] "covered in sores, bruises and abrasions". His weight at death was slightly less than his weight at his first birthday, almost five years earlier.|$|R
5|$|The {{first and}} last parts of the story are told as a third-person narrative, but the middle part is written in the first person. The story begins in 1861 with the faked death of President Olivero, {{dictator}} of the South American Republic of Roncador, who has staged his own assassination. He returns to his native England, to the village {{where he was born}} and raised. On the evening of his <b>arrival</b> Olivero <b>notices</b> that the stream running through the village appears to be flowing backwards, and he decides to follow the water upstream to discover the cause.|$|R
50|$|Initially {{there was}} some {{controversy}} as to the whereabouts of the centre stand's clock - on <b>arrival,</b> the contractors <b>noticed</b> it was missing. It was later confirmed in the South Wales Evening Post {{that it was in}} the safe hands of a group of people angered by the Council's neglect of such Vetch relics as the clock.|$|R
30|$|During our {{simulations}} with bursty data <b>arrivals,</b> we <b>noticed</b> that it {{is interesting}} to have an approximation that has only one or two unit fractions. It is also interesting if the slot size is divisible by the packet size. It is not so interesting to have a packet size that is bigger than the slot size. And it is also good to have a certain rate-packet size relation, according to Formula 4. These three cases give the lowest possible buffer sizes. These conclusions are also valid for the latency, but there the rate plays also a very important role: the higher the rate, the lower the latency.|$|R
50|$|Siberia is an American mockumentary {{series about}} a reality {{television}} show where 14 contestants must {{survive in the}} Siberian territory of Tunguska. Shortly after <b>arrival,</b> the contestants <b>notice</b> strange things and are abandoned by {{the production of the}} reality show. The show was filmed in Birds Hill Provincial Park just north of Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada. It premiered on NBC on July 1, 2013.|$|R
5000|$|Harling later {{claimed that}} upon his <b>arrival</b> home he <b>noticed</b> Coughlan and Doyle, {{that one of}} them shot at him, that he pulled his gun while running and shot back in self-defence, and that later he went out to {{investigate}} and found Coughlan's body lying in the street. His version was accepted by the tribunal which looked into the case, and he was not charged.|$|R
5000|$|L'Ingénu (...) is a satirical novella by the French writer Voltaire, {{published}} in 1767. It {{tells the story}} of a Huron called [...] "Child of Nature" [...] who, after having crossed the Atlantic to England, crosses into Brittany, France in the 1690s. Upon <b>arrival,</b> a prior <b>notices</b> depictions of his brother and sister-in-law, whom they deduce to be the Huron's parents - making him French.|$|R
50|$|Upon their <b>arrival,</b> {{the team}} <b>notices</b> global {{communications}} have been disabled, limiting them to local access only. They discover autonomously operating surveillance drones monitoring them. The team begins their mission of eliminating A.I. threats. The first encounter proves {{easy for the}} team as they eliminate A.I. drones from a vantage point. During the battle, Mills discovers an advanced S.A.R. (Study Analyze Reprogram) unit, S.A.R.-003, but is unable to access it.|$|R
50|$|The third, and shortest, {{chapter of}} this story gives a short {{description}} of the train ride that Tom takes to Virginia. He is upset {{by the lack of}} order that exists between White and Black people on the train. Upon <b>arrival</b> he immediately <b>notices</b> a beautiful girl speaking with her friends. He becomes slightly infatuated with her and they make eye contact while he listens to her and her friends discuss the upcoming horse races.|$|R
5000|$|... 4/15/2010: The campus fire {{department}} {{responded to the}} report of smoke/flame in the construction site adjacent to the new addition to McHenry Library. Upon <b>arrival,</b> crews <b>noticed</b> heavy smoke coming from the 2nd floor of the construction site. [...] Additional crews were requested from the Santa Cruz Fire Department for mutual aid. The new addition to the library was promptly evacuated, and lead to {{the closure of the}} library for at least a week to clear out smoke damage, etc. The fire was extinguished within an hour of it breaking out. The two-alarm fire was caused by an overheated extension cord being used by the construction site workers. No major injuries were reported, with the only minor injury being a security guard on the construction site who suffered from minor smoke inhalation.|$|R
5000|$|Klaha and Cecil {{are set to}} get married. However, {{their wedding}} must be {{postponed}} because Klaha is summoned from England to Romania on business. Klaha goes to Transylvania, and arrives at the Earl of Dracula's castle, where he is staying. The Earl seems welcoming, but Klaha has strange experiences while staying there. On his <b>arrival,</b> he <b>notices</b> a painting of the Earl's deceased wife, who {{looks very much like}} Cecil. 2 nights later, the Earl agrees to buy a house in England. That same night, after having a nightmare, Klaha wakes up to see a coffin leaving the grounds. While looking for the Earl, Klaha sees the painting again, but this time, the word [...] "Cecil" [...] is written under it. Too late does Klaha realise that the Earl is a vampire. He immediately leaves to try to catch up with him.|$|R
5000|$|... 1/11/2002: The campus fire {{department}} {{responded to a}} heat sensor activation at the Sinsheimer Labs around 5:30am. Upon <b>arrival,</b> crews <b>noticed</b> smoke and flame coming from a lab on the 4th floor in the south wing. [...] A report was put it for mutual aid from neighboring departments, including the County Haz-Mat team. The fire destroyed the lab in which it originated in, and most of a neighboring lab. Reconstruction {{had to be done}} on that portion of the building. Because there were no fire sprinklers in the building at the time (only a fire detection system), a high demand for the building to be retrofitted with sprinklers lead to the installation of them in months following the fire. There was no cause determined, but it was speculated that a small piece of equipment may have overheated causing the fire. No injuries were reported.|$|R
500|$|Piecing {{together}} the Illawarra Steamship Navigation Company's fleet is difficult, as, unlike most steamship companies of the day, neither the company's advertising nor their <b>arrival</b> and departure <b>notices</b> carried {{the names of}} the vessels. Instead they simply listed the ships as [...] "I.S.N. Steamers", if the vessels were mentioned at all. Nevertheless, it is known that when the company was amalgamated they had at least three vessels to handle the south coast trade: the Kiama from the Kiama Steamship Company, the Nora Creina from the Shoalhaven Steam Navigation Company, and the General Steamship Company's Illawarra.|$|R
2500|$|Upon <b>arrival,</b> Sadoul <b>noticed</b> [...] "the [...] {{desire for}} an {{immediate}} peace, at any cost". The October Revolution of late 1917 toppled the Provisional Government and brought in its stead a Council of People's Commissars entirely controlled by the Bolshevik faction. On November 8, Sadoul recorded the Red Guards' lynchings of their opponents, including Prince Tumanov, and rumors of war rape. The new Russian Soviet Republic moved toward communism and proletarian internationalism, stating its intention {{to withdraw from the}} [...] "imperialistic" [...] war. Not dissuaded by the events, both Niessel and Sadoul gave free lectures on the French war effort at the Alliance Française. Days after the Revolution, Sadoul had established contact with the People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs, Leon Trotsky. Trotsky spoke to him about his efforts to pacify the Menshevik opposition on the left, while also quelling the Kerensky–Krasnov uprising. Sadoul believed that Trotsky intended to share power with the Mensheviks. Recording Trotsky's modest demeanor, he claims that the Commissar had moved out of his home because the concierge threatened to have him killed.|$|R
50|$|Upon <b>arrival,</b> she {{immediately}} <b>notices</b> {{that things are}} a little strange in the castle. She observes John's two brothers, Billy (Bart Patton) and Richard (William Campbell) {{taking part in a}} bizarre ceremony with their mother as part of a yearly ritualistic tribute to their young sister Kathleen, who died many years before in a freak drowning accident. Lady Haloran still mourns for her; and, during the ceremony, she faints dead away as she does every year. As Louise helps her into the house, her mother-in-law tells her that she fainted because one of the flowers she had thrown had died as it touched Kathleen's grave.|$|R
60|$|Deeming it in {{the highest}} degree {{improbable}} that any watch would be set for them at a place so far from their line of travel, they put up for {{the night at the}} principal inn. In the morning they again started, and after riding for some distance to the south, made a wide sweep, and crossing the river, entered Tours from the south, late in the evening. They again put up at the principal inn, for although they doubted not that their <b>arrival</b> would be <b>noticed</b> by the emissaries of the enemy, they had no fear of molestation in a town like Tours. And on the following morning Ronald presented himself {{at the entrance to the}} convent.|$|R
40|$|A tese discute, sob a {{interface}} da literatura e da história, duas narrativas coloniais produzidas a partir de Olinda. Sugere-se o embarque pelos campos da poética e da viagem e revisita Pernambuco, não no sentido de cantar ou descrever feitos históricos, porém alcançar a percepção do leitor como proposta de se ler um texto épico, outro descritivo mediado por suportes interdisciplinares. Entre a epopeia e o testemunho, propõe-se aqui uma análise dos mundos épico de Bento Teixeira, autor de Prosopopeia e viajado por Henry Koster, autor de Travels in Brazil, traduzido ao português por Luís da Câmara Cascudo como Viagens ao Nordeste do Brasil, por letras necessárias para se ler a paisagem e ver o mundo, mediante o diálogo entre a arte e a cartografia do imaginário. Como passaporte para a leitura, indica-se o embarque pelas fontes luso-brasileiras. Como proposta de chegada, trilha-se o caminho da percepção de composição de mundo colonial pela temática da viagem. A tese alcança questões da contemporaneidade, como leitura e recepção, educação e currículo, educação pública e sociedade, estado social e estado providência para a devida aquisição da cidadania, graças ao direito de aprender conteúdos necessários para a formação digna. This thesis debates, under the interface {{of literature and}} history, two colonial narratives produced by Olinda. It is suggested boarding {{in the fields of}} poetry and voyage and revisits Pernambuco, neither in the sense of singing, nor by describing a sort of historical facts only, though reaching the perception of the reader at present. The purpose here is an invitation to reading theses narratives, {{not only because of the}} epic or descriptive approach, but thanks to the contribution and mediation of interdisciplinary areas. Between the epic and the testimony, it proposes a piece of analysis of worlds written by Bento Teixeira, author of Prosopopeia and traveled by Henry Koster, author of Travels in Brazil, translated into Portuguese by Luís da Câmara Cascudo as Viagens ao Nordeste do Brasil, as texts necessary to be read in order to understand the landscape and see the world of the colonial period of Brazil, through the dialogue between art and cartography of the imagination. As a passport to reading, the starting point is indicated by the Luso-Brazilian sources. As strategy of <b>arrival,</b> <b>noticing</b> the perception of the colonial world composed thanks to the theme of the voyage is the path. The thesis reaches contemporary issues, such as reading and reception, education and curriculum, public education and society, social and welfare state for the proper acquisition of citizenship, thanks to the right to learn content necessary for worthy education basis...|$|R
50|$|After the April 29 show in Memphis' Ellis Auditorium, Springsteen {{decided to}} catch a taxi to Graceland. Upon <b>arrival</b> he had <b>noticed</b> a light on {{in the house and}} {{proceeded}} to jump the gates and walk to the front door. Security intervened at which point Springsteen asked if Elvis Presley was home, but Presley was in fact in Lake Tahoe. The guards not having any idea who this visitor was, even after Springsteen tried to explain it to them and state that he had been on the covers of Time and Newsweek, politely escorted him to the street. Years later Springsteen would tell the story in concerts and reminisce about what he would have said to Presley had he answered the door.|$|R
50|$|In 1973 he and {{his wife}} Svetlana Pivkova decided to emigrate. The first step was to obtain a letter from a {{relative}} in Israel, inviting them to settle there; at that time, even non-Jews leaving the Soviet Union could only go to Israel. He requested such a letter through Israel's Academy of Sciences, and in due course received one. Its <b>arrival</b> was <b>noticed</b> by the Soviet authorities, and as was then customary he was demoted at his place of work, in his case to a post of Senior Scientist with a reduced salary, while she was dismissed from her post (at a different Institute) and could not obtain one elsewhere. In 1975 they were finally permitted to apply for exit visas, but this application was refused, as were 26 other such applications they made during the next 12 years. During this period, he took an active part in a scientific seminar to maintain his skills and those of his fellow “refuseniks”. It was organized by Victor Brailovsky, and the other participants included Alexander Lerner, Yuri Orlov, and Anatoly Sharansky; though not himself a candidate for emigration, Andrei Sakharov often attended the seminar and supported the refuseniks until his exile to Gorky in 1980. Following the arrest of Brailovsky in 1981, these seminars were often held at the Alperts' apartment.|$|R
60|$|There {{was nothing}} {{now to be}} seen from the railing, and Peggy jumped down on the porch. Her {{activity}} seemed to pervade her being. She ran down the front steps, crossed the lawn, and mounted the stile. Here she could catch sight of the two men who seemed to be disputing. This was too much for Peggy. If there was to be a fight she wanted to see it; and, apart from her curiosity, she had a loyal interest in the event. Down the steps, and along the road she went {{at the top of her}} speed, and soon reached the gate. Her <b>arrival</b> was not <b>noticed</b> by any one except the mud-colored horse, who gazed at her inquiringly; and looking through the bars, without opening the gate, Peggy had a good view of the gentlemen.|$|R
50|$|The narrator awakes in a berth on the City of Prague, a {{steamship}} {{that left}} {{at the same time}} as the Morrow and Jarrett had been originally invited to go aboard with his friend Gordon Doyle. The latter stares at him now trying to deduce what is going on. As William slowly learns, he has been on the City of Prague since she set sail from Liverpool. He also learns that Janette is Gordon's fiancée who was sent on the Morrow so that Doyle could settle things in New York before her <b>arrival.</b> William also <b>notices</b> the book that Doyle is reading which is Denneker's Meditations with a special passage marked, apparently a second copy that Janette had given him. When Gordon and Jarrett arrive in New York, they look for the Morrow to arrive, but it never appears.|$|R
25|$|Charles Cortimiglia was an {{immigrant}} {{who lived with}} his wife and baby on the corner of Jefferson Avenue and Second Street in Gretna, Louisiana, a New Orleans suburb, across the Mississippi River. On the night of March 10, 1919, screams were heard coming from the Cortimiglia Residence. Grocer Iorlando Jordano rushed across the street to investigate. Upon his <b>arrival,</b> Jordano <b>noticed</b> that Charles Cortimiglia, his wife Rosie, and their infant daughter, Mary, had all been attacked by the unknown intruder. Rosie stood in the doorway with a serious head wound, clutching her deceased daughter. Charles laid on the floor, bleeding profusely. The couple was rushed to Charity Hospital, where it was discovered that both had suffered skull fractures. Nothing was stolen from the house, but a panel on the back door had been chiseled away. A bloody axe was found on the back porch of the home. Charles was released two days later, while his wife remained in the care of doctors. Upon gaining full consciousness, Rosie made claims that Iorlando Jordano and his 18-year-old son, Frank, were responsible for the attacks. Iorlando, a 69-year-old man, was in too poor of health to have committed the crimes. Frank Jordano, more than six feet tall and weighing over 200 pounds, would have been too large to have fit through the panel on the back door. Charles Cortimiglia vehemently denied his wife's claims, yet police nonetheless arrested the two, and charged them with the murder. The men would later be found guilty. Frank was sentenced to hang, and his father to life in prison. Charles Cortimiglia divorced his wife after the trial. Almost a year later, Rosie announced that she had falsely accused the two out of jealousy and spite. Her statement was the only evidence against the Jordanos, and they were released from jail shortly thereafter.|$|R
50|$|On August 29, 1861, Kaiser {{traveled}} to Rolla, Missouri for service. Upon her <b>arrival,</b> Kaiser immediately <b>noticed</b> rampant disease: measles, fevers, colds, and even homesickness. Much like in St. Louis, supplies were incredibly scarce. In September {{of the same}} year, Kaiser committed to service in the Jefferson Barracks Hospital where she saw a great need for assistance. Once again, she took it upon herself to garner supplies for the severely under-stocked hospital. Kaiser also took up the cleaning of the ward. Though there weren't many injured or ill patients, Kaiser did not a fear that men from the regiments had been taken as prisoners of war. As new patients arrived, however, Kaiser took on work that typically was completed by the doctor {{in addition to her}} nursing duties. Despite her best efforts, on November 1, a soldier reported Kaiser, alleging that she did not give him enough food despite the scarcity of food and rations. Kaiser persisted in her efforts. A new doctor and steward arrived during her service, but they weren't attentive to the needs of their patients. Kaiser, once again, took on the extra work without complaint.|$|R
