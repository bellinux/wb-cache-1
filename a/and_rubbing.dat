5|$|As {{their name}} suggests, bee-eaters {{predominantly}} eat flying insects, especially bees and wasps, which {{are caught in}} the air by flights from an open perch. The stinger is removed by repeatedly hitting <b>and</b> <b>rubbing</b> the insect on a hard surface. During this process, pressure is applied to the insect, thereby extracting most of the venom.|$|E
5|$|Females {{predominantly}} scent mark {{with their}} anogenital scent glands, by squatting to rub their anogenital region along horizontal surfaces, such as tree limbs. Males, {{on the other}} hand, favor using the glands on their neck, muzzle, and chest, by embracing horizontal and vertical surfaces <b>and</b> <b>rubbing</b> themselves over them. Both sexes will occasionally scent mark in ways characteristic of the opposite sex.|$|E
5|$|If a male is interested, he will stretch {{his neck}} and erect his feathers, then bend over and peck at the ground. He will circle around and sidle up to the female, swaying his body and neck from side to side, <b>and</b> <b>rubbing</b> his breast against his partner's rump. Often the female will reject his {{advances}} with aggression, but if amenable, she signals acceptance by squatting down and raising her rump.|$|E

5|$|In 2003, Scottish {{scientists}} at the University of Edinburgh and the Roslin Institute concluded that rainbow trout exhibit behaviors often associated with pain in other animals. Bee venom and acetic acid injected into the lips resulted in fish rocking their bodies <b>and</b> <b>rubbing</b> their lips along the sides and floors of their tanks, which the researchers concluded were attempts to relieve pain, similar to what mammals would do. Neurons fired in a pattern resembling human neuronal patterns.|$|E

25|$|American {{composer}} Ellen Fullman (born in 1957) {{developed a}} Long String instrument {{in the early}} 1980s, which is tuned in just intonation and played by walking {{along the length of}} the long strings <b>and</b> <b>rubbing</b> them with rosined hands and producing longitudinal vibrations.|$|E
25|$|At {{the same}} time, the {{supposed}} medical condition of hysteriafrom the Greek hystera or uteruswas being treated by what {{would now be}} described as medically administered or medically prescribed masturbation for women.

25|$|When the {{antennae}} of rockpool prawns Palaemon elegans are rubbed with {{sodium hydroxide}} or acetic acid (both are irritants in mammals), they increase grooming <b>and</b> <b>rubbing</b> of the afflicted area {{against the side}} of the tank; this reaction is inhibited by benzocaine (a local anaesthetic in mammals), even though control prawns treated with only anaesthetic do not show reduced activity.|$|E
25|$|Humans {{also often}} seek to mimic animals' {{communicative}} signals {{in order to}} interact with them. For example, cats have a mild affiliative response of slowly closing their eyes; humans often mimic this signal towards a pet cat to establish a tolerant relationship. Stroking, petting <b>and</b> <b>rubbing</b> pet animals are all actions that probably work through their natural patterns of interspecific communication.|$|E
25|$|In {{a recent}} study, {{scientists}} have confirmed through several experiments that the protein responsible for healing properties in human saliva is, in fact, histatin. Scientists {{are now looking}} for ways to make use of this information in ways that can lead to chronic wounds, burns, and injuries being healed by saliva, making this type of treatment as common as antibiotic creams <b>and</b> <b>rubbing</b> alcohol.|$|E

25|$|Some tribal {{cultures}} traditionally created tattoos {{by cutting}} designs {{into the skin}} <b>and</b> <b>rubbing</b> the resulting wound with ink, ashes or other agents; some cultures continue this practice, which may be an adjunct to scarification. Some cultures create tattooed marks by hand-tapping the ink into the skin using sharpened sticks or animal bones (made like needles) with clay formed disks or, in modern times, needles.|$|E
25|$|When the {{antennae}} of rockpool prawns (Palaemon elegans) are rubbed with {{sodium hydroxide}} or acetic acid (both are irritants), the animals show increased grooming <b>and</b> <b>rubbing</b> of the afflicted area {{against the side}} of the tank. Furthermore, this reaction is inhibited by a local anaesthetic, even though control prawns treated with only anaesthetic did not show reduced activity. Other scientists suggested the rubbing may reflect an attempt to clean the affected area as application of anaesthetic alone caused an increase in grooming.|$|E
25|$|Poke {{is a local}} cuisine that {{originally}} involved preserving raw fish or other seafood such as octopus with sea salt <b>and</b> <b>rubbing</b> it (lomi) with seasonings or cutting it into small pieces. Seasonings made of seaweed, kukui nut, and sea salt were traditionally used for the Hawaiian poke. Since first contact with Western and Asian cultures, scallions, chili peppers, and soy sauce have become common additions to it. Poke is different from sashimi, since the former is usually rough-cut and piled onto a plate, and {{can be made with}} less expensive pieces of fish.|$|E

25|$|A long-standing home method {{involves}} using ice {{as a local}} anesthetic, {{a sewing}} needle as a puncture instrument, a burning match <b>and</b> <b>rubbing</b> alcohol for disinfection, and a semi-soft object, such as a potato, cork, bar of soap or rubber eraser, as a push point. Sewing thread may be drawn through the piercing and tied, as a device for keeping the piercing open during the healing process. Alternatively, a gold stud or wire earring may be directly inserted into the fresh piercing as the initial retaining device. Home methods are often unsafe and risky due to issues of improper sterilization or placement.|$|E
25|$|The marbles {{generally}} {{were very}} dirty...from a deposit {{of dust and}} soot....I found {{the body of the}} marble beneath the surface white....The application of water, applied by a sponge or soft cloth, removed the coarsest dirt....The use of fine, gritty powder, with the water <b>and</b> <b>rubbing,</b> though it more quickly removed the upper dirt, left much embedded in the cellular surface of the marble. I then applied alkalies, both carbonated and caustic; these quickened the loosening of the surface dirt...but they fell far short of restoring the marble surface to its proper hue and state of cleanliness. I finally used dilute nitric acid, and even this failed....The examination has made me despair of the possibility of presenting the marbles in the British Museum in that state of purity and whiteness which they originally possessed.|$|E
500|$|Both {{males and}} females {{establish}} home ranges, and are most active only in certain regions ('core areas') within them. The area of these ranges can vary from prey density, availability of cover and human interference could be significant factors in determining their size. Home ranges might overlap extensively, but occupants show minimal interaction. Aggressive encounters are rare, as servals appear to mutually avoid one another rather than fight and defend their ranges. Agonistic behaviour involves vertical movement of the head (contrary to the horizontal movement observed in other cats), raising the hair and the tail, displaying the teeth and the white band on the ears, and yowling. Individuals mark their ranges and preferred paths by spraying urine on nearby vegetation, dropping scats along the way, <b>and</b> <b>rubbing</b> their mouth on grasses or the ground while releasing saliva. Servals tend to be sedentary, shifting only a few kilometres away even if they leave their range.|$|E
