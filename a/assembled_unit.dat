5|$|The {{functionality}} of calculator ICs {{increased at}} a rapid pace and Roberts was designing and producing new models. The MITS 7400 scientific and engineering calculator was introduced in December 1972. It featured trigonometric functions, polar to rectangular conversion, two memories, and up to a seven-level stack. A kit with a three-level stack was $299.95 and an <b>assembled</b> <b>unit</b> with a seven-level stack was $419.95. The next month the Series 1200 four-function pocket calculators were announced. The six-digit model was $59.95 and the twelve-digit model was $99.95.|$|E
25|$|An {{adhesive}} sealant (polyisobutylene) {{is applied}} to the face of the spacer on each side and the panes pressed against the spacer. If the unit is gas filled, two holes are drilled into the spacer of the <b>assembled</b> <b>unit,</b> lines are attached to draw out the air out of the space and replacing it (or leaving just vacuum) with the desired gas. The lines are then removed and holes sealed to contain the gas. The more modern technique is to use an online gas filler, which eliminates the need to drill holes in the spacer. The units are then sealed on the edge side using either polysulfide or silicone sealant or similar material to prevent humid outside air from entering the unit. The desiccant will remove traces of humidity from the air space so that no water appears on the inside faces (no condensation) of the glass panes facing the air space during cold weather. Some manufacturers have developed specific processes that combine the spacer and desiccant into a single step application system.|$|E
500|$|The MITS 816 {{was known}} as a [...] "four-function" [...] calculator; it could add, subtract, {{multiply}} and divide. The display was only 8-digits but the calculations were done to 16-digits of accuracy. The custom molded case gave the kit a professional appearance; the kit was $179 and an <b>assembled</b> <b>unit</b> was $275. The MITS 816 was featured on the November 1971 cover of Popular Electronics. Thousands of calculator orders came in each month, in contrast to poor results for previous kits that MITS had offered.|$|E

50|$|Packaged HRSGs are {{designed}} to be shipped as a fully <b>assembled</b> <b>unit</b> from the factory. They can be used in waste heat or turbine (usually under 20 MW) applications. The packaged HRSG can have a water-cooled furnace, which allows for higher supplemental firing and better overall efficiency.|$|E
50|$|Pre-use {{preparation}} of the rebreather includes checking of seals and post-assembly leak checks. The positive pressure test checks that the <b>assembled</b> <b>unit</b> can maintain a slight internal positive pressure for a short period, which {{is an indication that}} gas does not leak out of the loop. Inspection and replacement of soft components should detect damage before component failure.|$|E

30|$|In this study, we {{introduced}} a novel method {{to construct a}} 3 D environment in a PDMS fluidic channel by <b>assembling</b> heterogeneous hydrogel <b>units.</b> By exploiting <b>assembled</b> hydrogel <b>units,</b> {{we were able to}} easily obtain high-aspect-ratio structures made of biocompatible hydrogel materials which are suitable for a controllable microfluidic environment. The assembly method showed a versatility in the use and arrangement of hydrogel units. It is expected that controllable deformation of the <b>assembled</b> hydrogel <b>unit</b> in a fluidic channel will extend the potential applications of the <b>assembled</b> hydrogel <b>units</b> to mechanobiology. In addition, an assembly process of cell-coated hydrogel units can be provided simple construction of a 3 D cell culture environment under fluidic conditions. By simply changing the structure and/or material of hydrogel units, we can create a heterogeneous cell culture environment suitable for a target cell, resulting in biologically relevant results as compared to the conventional platform. Furthermore, the <b>assembled</b> hydrogel <b>units</b> can be easily retrieved by disassembling the fluidic channel after the experiments, thereby facilitating further post-analysis using the cultured <b>assembled</b> hydrogel <b>units.</b> Based on these strengths, our method could provide a wide range of applications such as in vitro 3 D cell culture module and biomimetic engineering studies.|$|R

40|$|This article explores {{comparative}} {{criticism and}} video game software development through {{the figure of}} the bricoleur, the handyman who <b>assembles</b> <b>units</b> of preexisting meaning to form new structures. An intersection of these two domains—what the author calls comparative video game criticism—suggests a more intimate interrelation between criticism and production. The author offers a critique of functionalist approaches to video game analysis and argues instead for a comparative analysis of the expressive capacity of games and how they relate to other forms of human production...|$|R
50|$|As an example, on June 26, 2006, a 565 ST {{catalytic}} cracking unit reactor was shipped by barge from the Tulsa Port of Catoosa in Oklahoma to a refinery in Pascagoula, Mississippi.

50|$|The gun weighed about 2 {{metric tons}} and used fixed {{ammunition}} (case and projectile handled {{as a single}} <b>assembled</b> <b>unit)</b> with a 9.6-pound (4.4 kg) charge of smokeless powder to give a 54-pound (24 kg) projectile a velocity of 2100 feet per second (640 m/s). Ceiling was 27400 ft at the maximum elevation of 85 degrees. Useful life expectancy was 4260 effective full charges (EFC) per barrel. The short barrel of the 5"/25 made {{it much easier to}} train manually against fast-moving targets. These guns were manually controlled so the short barrel and light weight made it an early favorite as an anti-aircraft gun. Another key feature was power loading, allowing rapid fire at high elevation angles. The 5"/38 caliber gun replaced the 5"/25 as the anti-aircraft weapon of choice on new construction by the mid-1930s due to its better range, velocity against surface targets, and higher vertical ceiling.|$|E
