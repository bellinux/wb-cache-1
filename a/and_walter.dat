30|$|The {{usage of}} {{nematodes}} to control thrips {{has been reported}} and suggested by some authors (Cuthbertson <b>and</b> <b>Walters,</b> 2005; Buitenhuis <b>and</b> Shipp, 2005). EPNs may offer a more suitable solution to deal with sedentary/settled insect pests (immature stage of Bemisia tabaci (Gennadius)) (Cuthbertson <b>and</b> <b>Walters,</b> 2005) {{or in the case}} of leaf-mining larvae (Williams <b>and</b> <b>Walters,</b> 2000). It was suggested that susceptibility of the nymph stage in onion thrips to EPNs is directly related to the nymph’s limited mobility (Buitenhuis and Shipp, 2005); therefore, it was no surprise that Thrips palmi larvae were more susceptible to S. feltiae infection compared to adults (North et al., 2006).|$|R

30|$|EPNs {{have been}} used {{successfully}} {{as an alternative to}} traditional pesticides in controlling several pests localized in soil, caterpillars, leaf miners, and thrips (Williams <b>and</b> <b>Walters,</b> 2000 <b>and</b> Laznik et al., 2010). EPNs {{have been used}} to control larval stages of western flower thrips (WFT), Frankliniella occidentalis, in ornamental plants and greenhouse vegetables (Wardlow et al., 2001 and Trdan et al., 2007 b). Foliar applications of the IJ stage for both Steinernema feltiae (Filipjev) and Lecanicillium muscarium (Petch) were found to offer various levels of control over other quarantine invertebrate pest species including leaf miners and whiteflies (Williams <b>and</b> <b>Walters,</b> 2000 <b>and</b> Cuthbertson <b>and</b> <b>Walters,</b> 2005).|$|R
