40|$|The complex {{space shuttle}} design was {{comprised}} of four components: the external tank, two solid rocket boosters (SRB), and the orbiter vehicle. Six orbiters were used during {{the life of the}} program. In order of introduction into the fleet, they were: Enterprise (a test vehicle), Columbia, Challenger, Discovery, Atlantis and Endeavour. The space shuttle had the unique ability to launch into orbit, perform on-orbit tasks, return to earth and land on a runway. It was an orbiting laboratory, International Space Station crew delivery and supply replenisher, satellite launcher and payload delivery vehicle, all in one. Except for the external tank, all components of the space shuttle were designed to be reusable for many flights. ATK s reusable solid rocket motors (RSRM) were designed to be flown, recovered, and the metal components reused 20 times. Following each space shuttle launch, the SRBs would parachute into the ocean and be recovered by the Liberty Star and Freedom Star recovery ships. The recovered boosters would then be received at the Cape Canaveral Air Force Station Hangar <b>AF</b> <b>facility</b> for disassembly and engineering post-flight evaluation. At Hangar AF, the RSRM field joints were demated and the segments prepared to be returned to Utah by railcar. The segments were then shipped to ATK s facilities in Clearfield for additional evaluation prior to washout, disassembly and refurbishment. Later the refurbished metal components would be transported to ATK s Promontory facilities to begin a new cycle. ATK s RSRMs were manufactured in Promontory, Utah. During the Space Shuttle Program, ATK supported NASA s Marshall Space Flight Center whose responsibility was for all propulsion elements on the program, including the main engines and solid rocket motors. On launch day for the space shuttle, ATK s Launch Site Operations employees at Kennedy Space Center (KSC) provided lead engineering support for ground operations and NASA s chief engineer. It was ATK s responsibility to have a representative in Firing Room 2 at KSC in case of potential motor problems. However, the last time ATK was responsible for a space shuttle launch slip was 1989. During launch, engineers were also stationed in Promontory on teleconference with counterparts at KSC in the event their support was required...|$|E

40|$|The author {{describes}} an Airway <b>Facilities</b> (<b>AF)</b> simulator for human-in-the-loop research and training. The AF simu-lator is a flexible, self-contained system. A simuator {{of this type}} and complexity is unique {{in the realm of}} human-in-the-loop simulation. It {{can be used as a}} platform for scientific research in human factors concepts, testing and validation of behavioral and performance measures, and as a potential training tool. The self-contained nature of the simulator al-lows for increased experimental control of research and generalizability of results. Because the system is self-contained, it is portable. This document provides an overview of the system com-ponents that comprise the AF simulator.

40|$|The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) airway <b>facilities</b> (<b>AF)</b> {{workforce}} {{maintains the}} automation, surveillance, navigation, and communications systems {{that make up}} the National Airspace System (NAS). NAS systems employ a variety of user identification techniques and policies which place cognitive and social pressures on the AF workforce. This poster describes ongoing FAA research examining the human factors issues AF personnel face in the use of information technology (IT) security. Issues include the number of passwords personnel must remember, the complexity and frequency by which passwords must be changed, and employee accountability. This poster provides an analysis of ways in which the AF environment, tasks, and users differ from the common IT environment described in the literature. We discuss ways that these differences may affect decisions regarding passwords and other IT security techniques. 1...|$|R
40|$|USA-SRB Element is {{responsible}} for the assembly and refurbishment of the non-motor components of the SRB as part of Space Shuttle. Thrust Vector Control (TVC) frames structurally support components of the TVC system located in the aft skirt of the SRB (Solid Rocket Booster). TVC frames are exposed to the seacoast environment after refurbishment and, also, to seawater immersion after splashdown, and during tow-back to CCAFS-Hangar <b>AF</b> refurbishment <b>facilities.</b> During refurbishment operations it was found that numerous TVC frames were experiencing internal corrosion and coating failures, both from salt air and seawater intrusions. Inspectors using borescopes would visually examine the internal cavities of the complicated aluminum alloy welded tubular structure. It was very difficult for inspectors to examine cavity corners and tubing intersections and particularly. {{to determine the extent of}} the corrosion and coating anomalies. Physical access to TVC frame internal cavities for corrosion removal and coating repair was virtually impossible, and an improved method using a Liquid (water based) Vapor-phase Corrosion Inhibitor (LVCI) for preventing initiation of new corrosion, and mitigating and/or stopping existing corrosion growth was recommended in lieu of hazardous paint solvents and high VOC/solvent based corrosion inhibitors. In addition, the borescopic inspection method used to detect corrosion, and/or coating anomalies had severe limitations because of part geometry, and an improved non-destructive inspection (NDI) method using Neutron Radiography (N-Ray) was also recommended...|$|R

40|$|This study takes a {{high-level}} approach to evaluate computer systems {{without regard to}} the specific method of interaction. This document analyzes the commands that Airway <b>Facilities</b> (<b>AF)</b> use across different systems and the meanings attributed to the different commands. Human factors researchers collected data on AF systems and equipment, identifying 25 different systems monitored and controlled by AF specialists. Different AF systems had different means of interfacing with the computer (e. g., graphical user interface, menus, and command line interface). The researchers summarized data on the interaction types across AF systems to find that most AF systems used menus as the primary means of interaction. Among the 25 systems monitored and controlled by AF, they uncovered more than 1500 options for accessing, interacting with, and controlling the equipment necessary to National Airspace System operations. They analyzed the options for frequency of occurrence and defined meanings for each of the most frequently used options. The result of this analysis is a set of core commands that are common across a number of systems. 17. Key Words Airway Facilities Commands 18.

40|$|In October 2000, the Airway Facilities {{organization}} {{plans to}} transition the National Airspace System (NAS) monitoring responsibilities to three regional Operations Control Centers (OCCs). Teams in these facilities {{will be different}} from those that currently exist in Maintenance Control Centers. A research team from the NAS Human Factors Branch, ACT- 530, reviewed {{the implications of this}} new environment on potential OCC team performance issues. They conducted a two-pronged study. The first part examined team processes in current and future Airway <b>Facilities</b> (<b>AF)</b> environments. This involved assessing task analyses and flowcharts depicting workflow and communication processes for AF maintenance work and conducting site interviews at key field sites. The second part of the study focused on identifying key factors with implications for team performance in the literature and applying them to the OCC environment. The study led to nine recommendations for facilitating the transition to OCCs. 17. Key Words Operations Control Center Teams Team Communications Team Effectiveness 18.

40|$|State {{of the art}} {{aircraft}} afterburners employ spray bars {{to inject}} fuel and flameholders to stabilize the combustion process. Such afterburner designs significantly increase the length (and thus weight), pressure losses, and observability of the engine. This thesis presents a feasibility study of a compact prime and trigger (PAT) afterburner concept that eliminates the fuel spray bars and flameholders and, thus, eliminates the above-mentioned problems. In this concept, afterburner fuel is injected just upstream or in between the turbine stages. Downstream of the turbine stages, a low power pilot, or trigger, {{can be used to}} control the combustion process. The envisioned trigger for the PAT concept is a jet of product gas from ultra-rich hydrocarbon/air combustion that is injected through the afterburner liner. This partial oxidation (POx) gas, which consists mostly of H 2, CO, and diluents, rapidly produces radicals and heat that accelerate the autoignition of the primed mixture and, thus, provide an anchor point for the afterburner combustion process. The objective of this research was to demonstrate the feasibility of the PAT concept by showing that (1) combustion of fuel injected within or upstream of turbine stages can occur only downstream of the turbine stages, and (2) the combustion zone is compact, stable and efficient. This was accomplished using two experimental facilities, a developed theoretical model, and Chemkin simulations. The first facility, termed the Afterburner <b>Facility</b> (<b>AF),</b> simulated the bulk flow temperature, velocity and O 2 content through a turbojet combustor, turbine stage and afterburner. The second facility, termed the Propane Autoignition Combustor (PAC), was essentially a scaled-down, simplified version of the AF. The developed model was used to predict and interpret the AF results and to study the feasibility of the PAT concept at pressures outside the AF operating range. Finally, the Chemkin simulations were used to study the effect of several POx gas compositions on the afterburner combustion process. Ph. D.
