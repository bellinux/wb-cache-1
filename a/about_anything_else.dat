Built out of a large wooden boat, around one hundred tar barrels were added, together with just <b>about</b> <b>anything</b> <b>else</b> available which could be burned. This tradition was stopped {{due to lack of}} old wooden boats to burn, and because a number of good boats were thrown onto the fire and burnt by over-enthusiastic revellers.|$|E

The fatwa discreetly did not name any specific recipient, and instead designated the persons it was addressed to by [...] "al-guraba" [...] (those living abroad) yet near to Allah".|$|E
500|$|Because {{he began}} as a writer of short stories, Baker {{believes}} Hemingway learned to [...] "get the most from the least, how to prune language, how to multiply intensities and how to tell {{nothing but the truth}} in a way that allowed for telling more than the truth." [...] Hemingway called his style the Iceberg Theory: the facts float above water; the supporting structure and symbolism operate out of sight. The concept of the iceberg theory is sometimes referred to as the [...] "theory of omission". Hemingway believed the writer could describe one thing (such as Nick Adams fishing in [...] "The Big Two-Hearted River") though an entirely different thing occurs below the surface (Nick Adams concentrating on fishing {{to the extent that he}} does not have to think <b>about</b> <b>anything</b> <b>else).</b> [...] Paul Smith writes that Hemingway's first stories, collected as In Our Time, showed he was still experimenting with his writing style. He avoided complicated syntax. About 70 percent of the sentences are simple sentences—a childlike syntax without subordination.|$|E

500|$|In certain situations, law {{enforcement}} may {{perform a search}} {{when they have a}} reasonable suspicion of criminal activity, even if it falls short of probable cause necessary for an arrest. Under Terry v. Ohio (1968), {{law enforcement}} officers are permitted to conduct a limited warrantless search on a level of suspicion less than probable cause under certain circumstances. In Terry, the Supreme Court ruled that when a police officer witnesses [...] "unusual conduct" [...] that leads that officer to reasonably believe [...] "that criminal activity may be afoot", that the suspicious person has a weapon and that the person is presently dangerous to the officer or others, the officer may conduct a [...] "pat-down search" [...] (or [...] "frisk") to determine whether the person is carrying a weapon. This detention and search is known as a Terry stop. To conduct a frisk, officers must be able to point to specific and articulable facts which, taken together with rational inferences from those facts, reasonably warrant their actions. As established in Florida v. Royer (1983), such a search must be temporary, and questioning must be limited to the purpose of the stop (e.g., officers who stop a person because they have reasonable suspicion to believe that the person was driving a stolen car, cannot, after confirming that it is not stolen, compel the person to answer questions <b>about</b> <b>anything</b> <b>else,</b> such as the possession of contraband).|$|E
500|$|Susan meets Jim at the {{hospital}} and remembers him from the work he did on Lyn Scully's (Janet Andrewartha) house. They get talking and Jim reveals he just had a melanoma removed and he is a bit [...] "bewildered" [...] by {{the hospital}} process and Susan helps him out. Jim's condition grows worse and he is diagnosed with terminal cancer. Susan learns he has no family and Woodburne said she instinctively wants to look after him. The actress said Susan crosses boundaries as she starts to neglect certain areas of her life, like her marriage. She tells Karl not to be selfish and that the situation is not about him or her, it is about Jim. Woodburne explained to Channel 5 that Karl's reaction to Susan's friendship with Jim changes and he starts thinking he should not be selfish. However, when he notices his wife becoming more involved with Jim and neglecting her responsibilities, Karl gets angry as she is not thinking <b>about</b> <b>anything</b> <b>else.</b> Susan and Karl's eldest son, Malcolm, returns to Erinsborough to help his parents work through their issues. Woodburne thought Malcolm was initially on Susan's side because he can see she is helping someone who is ill, but as he looks more closely he understands why his father is so upset with Susan's behavior. Susan is upset when she misses Jim's last moments and blames Karl. They begin rowing, which becomes worse due to Susan's grief. Susan Hill of the Daily Star revealed Karl and Susan were to separate following a make-or-break holiday. Their decision leaves Malcolm devastated and he takes his anger out on his mother, but Karl then admits it was his decision to end the marriage. Woodburne said the Jim Dolan plot was [...] "a tremendous story which highlighted problems with Susan and Karl's marriage." [...] The actress said the storyline was challenging to play because it was emotional and she had to slap Fletcher. Of Susan's future, Woodburne said [...] "2012 will be a huge year of adjustment for Susan. She is now single and moves into an apartment of her own – and she has to find her own way. She discovers things about herself that will surprise people." ...|$|E
2500|$|Others {{compared}} {{the quality of}} the Bogdanov papers with that seen over a wider arena. [...] "The Bogdanoffs' work is significantly more incoherent than just <b>about</b> <b>anything</b> <b>else</b> being published", wrote Peter Woit. He continued, [...] "But the increasingly low standard of coherence in the whole field is what allowed them to think they were doing something sensible and to get it published." [...] Woit later devoted a chapter of his book Not Even Wrong (2006) to the Bogdanov Affair.|$|E

2500|$|In 1981, Vangelis {{wrote the}} {{score for the}} film Chariots of Fire, set at the 1924 Summer Olympics. The choice of music was unorthodox as most period films {{featured}} traditional orchestral scores, whereas Vangelis' music was modern and synthesizer-heavy. The movie won the Academy Award for Best Picture and Vangelis won the Academy Award for Best Original Music Score. The opening theme of the film was released as a single in 1982, topping the American Billboard chart for one week after climbing steadily for five months. It was used at the 1984 Winter Olympics. Vangelis commented that the [...] "main inspiration was the story itself. The rest I did instinctively, without thinking <b>about</b> <b>anything</b> <b>else,</b> other than to express my feelings with the technological means available {{to me at the}} time".|$|E
2500|$|Morton Sobell finally {{admitted}} in 2008 (after {{many years of}} denials) {{that he was a}} Soviet spy. He confirmed that Julius Rosenberg was [...] "in a conspiracy that delivered to the Soviets classified military and industrial information ... the atomic bomb", and that, [...] "He never told me <b>about</b> <b>anything</b> <b>else</b> that he was engaged in." [...] However, he stated that he thought the hand-drawn diagrams and other atomic-bomb details that were acquired by David Greenglass and passed to Julius were of [...] "little value" [...] to the Soviet Union, and were used only to corroborate what they had already learned from the other atomic spies. He also stated that he believed Ethel Rosenberg was aware of her husband's deeds, but took no part in them. In a subsequent letter to The New York Times, Sobell denied that he knew anything about Julius Rosenberg's alleged atomic espionage activities – that the only thing he knew for sure was what he himself did in association with Julius Rosenberg.|$|E
2500|$|The {{authors have}} Ph.D. degrees [...] from the University of Burgundy; Grichka Bogdanov {{received}} his degree in mathematics, and Igor Bogdanov received his in theoretical physics (in 1999 and 2002 respectively). Both {{were given the}} low, unusual, but passing grade of [...] "honorable"; Igor initially failed and was required to publish three papers in peer-reviewed journals before being given a degree. When later challenges to {{the legitimacy of the}} papers submitted by the Bogdanov brothers arose, the debate spread {{to the question of whether}} the substitution of a [...] "publication requirement" [...] by university professors when they do not understand students' work is a valid means of determining the veracity of a paper. The validity of their work was supported after independent reviews by several physicists such as Jac Verbaarschot of Stony Brook, Roman Jackiw of MIT, and Robert Coquereaux. Columbia University mathematician Peter Woit has said, [...] "The Bogdanoffs' work is significantly more incoherent than just <b>about</b> <b>anything</b> <b>else</b> being published.

2500|$|Because of this hypervisibility from symbols {{like the}} veil, {{it makes it}} {{difficult}} to talk about the realities of Arab and Arab American women's lives, [...] "without invoking, and necessarily responding to, the looming image and story that the mythology of the veil tells", she goes on to state that the veil is not the only symbol, there are others such as [...] "honor killings" [...] and [...] "stoning". [...] The argument that is being made is that because of these symbols it is hard to talk <b>about</b> <b>anything</b> <b>else</b> that is currently taking place in the lives of Arab and Arab American women. Theses symbols make it difficult to focus on other important issues, however Jarmakani states that because of this hypervisibility Arab feminists can take advantage of it. She builds her argument off of Joe Kadi from her essay, [...] "Speaking about Silence" [...] where Joe argues that those who are silenced or being forced into being silent can break this silence by speaking out. Jarmakani argues that unlike Joe who said one should speak out, Jarmakani is stating to use the silence, meaning that Arab women should use the hypervisibility that is being given by the symbols of invisibility.

2500|$|Perone's {{assessment}} of the album's composition indicates a remove from [...] "just <b>about</b> <b>anything</b> <b>else</b> {{that was going on}} in 1966 pop music". Composer Philip Glass observed: [...] "Listening to it today, it is, perhaps, easier to see why {{it was one of the}} defining moments of its time... its willingness to abandon formula in favor of structural innovation, the introduction of classical elements in the arrangements, production concepts in terms of overall sound which were novel at the time-all these elements give Pet Sounds a freshness that, 30 years later, is immediately there for the listener." [...] Strauss writes that with Pet Sounds, the Beach Boys became the first major rock group [...] "to look music trends firmly in the eye and declare that rock really didn't matter. Rock is supposed to be about, you know, fucking, and Brian Wilson was recording a song ('I Know There's an Answer') that was originally entitled 'Get Rid of Your Libido'." [...] Sommer said that the Beach Boys became the first group to make an entire album that departed from the usual small-ensemble electric rock band format: [...] "Of course, others had done it for a song or two, but no one had said, 'This will be a complete album that can not be performed by four or five guys plugged into amps.... Once the Beach Boys let that cat out of the bag, the whole ship of rock sailed to new ports.'" ...|$|E

Given that Shah's writings and translations of Sufi teaching stories were designed with that purpose in mind, he recommended them to those interested in assessing the matter for themselves, and noted that many authorities had accepted Shah's position as a spokesman for contemporary Sufism. The psychologist and consciousness researcher Charles Tart commented that Shah's writings had [...] "produced a more profound appreciation in him of what psychology is <b>about</b> than <b>anything</b> <b>else</b> ever written".|$|R
