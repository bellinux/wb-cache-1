The national currency fell sharply in value, foreign currency transactions were virtually suspended for weeks, {{and the market}} capitalisation of the Icelandic stock exchange fell by more than 90%. As {{a result of the}} crisis, Iceland underwent a severe economic depression; the country's gross domestic product dropped by 10% in real terms between the third quarter of 2007 and the third quarter of 2010. A new era with positive GDP growth started in 2011, and has helped foster a gradually declining trend for the unemployment rate. The government budget deficit has declined from 9.7% of GDP in 2009 and 2010 to 0.2% of GDP in 2014; the central government gross debt-to-GDP ratio is expected to decline to less than 60% in 2018 from a maximum of 85% in 2011.|$|E

40|$|Objective: Studies {{have found}} that illness {{perceptions}} explain significant variance in health outcomes in numerous diseases. However, {{most of the research}} is cross-sectional and non-oncological. We examined, {{for the first time in}} breast, colorectal and prostate cancer patients, if cognitive and emotional illness perceptions near diagnosis predict future multidimensional health-related quality of life (HRQoL). Methods: UK-based patients (N[*]=[*] 334) completed the illness perception questionnaire-revised within 6 months post-diagnosis and the quality of life in adult cancer survivors scale 15 months post-diagnosis. Sociodemographic and clinical data were obtained from medical records. Hierarchical multiple regression analyses were conducted. Results: The sociodemographic and clinical factors collectively significantly predicted 8 / 12 HRQoL domains, although for 5 / 8 accounted for < 10 % of the variance. For all 12 HRQoL domains, illness perceptions collectively explained significant substantial additional variance (∆R² range: 5. 6 – 27. 9 %), and a single illness perception questionnaire-revised dimension was the best individual predictor of 9 / 12 HRQoL domains. The consequences dimension independently predicted 7 / 12 HRQoL domains; patients who believed their cancer would have <b>a</b> more <b>serious</b> <b>negative</b> <b>impact</b> on their life reported poorer future HRQoL. The emotional representations and identity dimensions also predicted multiple HRQoL domains. Conclusions: Future research should focus on realising the potential of illness perceptions as a modifiable target for and mediating mechanism of interventions to improve patients' HRQoL...|$|R

Improper and poor municipal {{solid waste management}} in most developing countries has left <b>a</b> <b>serious</b> and <b>negative</b> <b>impact</b> on the environment. Consequently, it has been identified as one of the main environmental issues in Malaysia. The main objective of this study was to examine the factors that affect municipal household solid waste management in Section 17, Shah Alam and the impact on the environment. This study examined the relationship between (i) households’ lifestyle, (ii) attitude and awareness towards municipal household solid waste management, (iii) the provision of facilities and services provided for municipal household solid waste and the impact on the environment. A total of 379 households in Section 17, Shah Alam, Selangor selected as the sample for this study. A set of questionnaire was distributed to the respondents and analyzed. The results demonstrated significant relationships between households’ lifestyle, attitude and awareness towards municipal household solid waste management, the provision of facilities and services provided for municipal household solid waste and the impact on the environment. The results also revealed that households’ lifestyle was the most significant factor that affects municipal household solid waste management impacting on the environment.

40|$|Soil {{stabilisation}} {{using traditional}} binders such as Ordinary Portland Cement (OPC), has <b>a</b> <b>serious</b> <b>negative</b> environmental <b>impact,</b> specifically carbon dioxide (CO 2) emissions {{as a result}} of the manufacture of OPC. Because of this, the use of sustainable binders has become a critical issue to help reduce cement production through the use of by-product materials. This research seeks to develop a new ternary blended cementitious binder (TBCB) to replace cement for soft soil stabilisation. Different ternary mixtures containing wastes i. e., high calcium fly ash (HCFA), palm oil fuel ash (POFA) and rice husk ash (RHA) along with flue gas desulphurisation (FGD) gypsum used as a sulphate activator and grinding agent, were examined. The results illustrate that ternary mixtures improved the engineering and mechanical properties of stabilised soil. The results indicated that the plasticity index (PI) was reduced from 20. 2 to 13. 0 and the unconfined compressive strength (UCS) increased after 28 days of curing from 202 kPa to 944 kPa using the optimum non-FGD activated mixture. FGD contributed significantly by increasing the UCS to 1464 kPa at 180 days of curing, which surpassed that for the reference cement (1450 kPa), and by improving the soil consistency limits; where the PI decreased to 11. 7 using TBCB compared with 14. 5 for the soil treated with the reference cement. X-ray diffraction (XRD) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) analysis revealed substantial changes in the diffraction patterns and microstructure components of the TBCB paste over the curing period, confirming the formation of cementitious products. A solid, coherent and compacted structure was achieved after treatment with TBCB as evidenced by the formation of C-S-H, CH and ettringite...|$|R
40|$|United Fiber System, Ltd (UFS) {{seeks to}} secure {{financing}} for a 600, 000 tonnes greenfield pulp mill project in South Kalimantan, Indonesia. It will be somewhat unique in Indonesia {{in that it}} will source its fiber entirely from sustainably managed plantations and will generate minimal <b>negative</b> <b>impacts</b> on natural forests and local communities. This brief has been prepared to promote a more informed and transparent dialogue on the proposed project among financial decision makers, policy makers, and other stakeholders. Based on a review of available documents and analyses, CIFOR has major questions regarding the social and environmental sustainability of the planned pulp mill and associated plantations. The issues are first limited information on the plantation development program provided by UFS. Secondly, the proposed project is likely to place direct pressures on the 77, 000 ha of natural forest that reportedly remains at the PT Hutan Rindang Banua (PT HRB) plantation concession, and particularly on the 44, 000 ha of areas covered by ‘mixed tropical hardwood’ (MTH) that were designated by Jaakko Poyry to be appropriate for plantation development. Thirdly, {{the development of a}} new 600, 000 tonne pulp mill in South Kalimantan would compound the very significant problem of industrial over capacity that currently exists in Indonesia’s forestry sector. Fourth, while the proposed pulp mill and associated plantations could generate significant employment and associated benefits, there is <b>a</b> risk of <b>serious</b> <b>negative</b> <b>impacts</b> on surrounding communities, which have a population of over 60, 000 people. Finally, the project’s current ownership structure lacks transparency, and this could lead to a lack of accountability if UFS or its affiliates fail to meet the commitments it is now making. As such, it is essential that financial decision makers, policy makers, and other interested parties design structures for ensuring accountability and transparency on the part of project principals...|$|R

This study {{attempts}} {{to investigate the}} perceived problems and constraints facing small Indian owned businesses in the 'downtown' area of Pietermaritzburg. An attempt was further made to profile businesses in the area, to investigate the specific problems and constraints facing them, and to look at problems {{on the basis of}} business sector and type of business. Further, the study aimed to provide information to marketers in the area and to make recommendations from a management point of view. The problems facing SMME's were broadly divided into internal problems, external problems and those facing the firm at industry level. Internal problems are those over which the owner-manager has control and external problems are those over which the owner-manager has no control. The main problem facing SMME's at industry level appears to be competition from similar businesses. The profile of businesses in downtown Pietermaritzburg is as follows: • Owners • Retail businesses • Family owned • Sole proprietors • Male co-owners • Approximately 72 % of the businesses in the sample exist for a period of longer than 10 years. The internal problems faced by the businesses include: • 24 % have no business experience • Businesses do not offer credit facilities • 32 % experience problems in recruiting skilled staff • Location is by far a major constraint in the business The external problems {{do not seem to be}} having <b>a</b> <b>serious!</b> very strong <b>negative</b> <b>impact,</b> however the common external problems faced by these businesses include • Business cycle • Exchange rates • Changes in distribution patterns • Social Cultural factors • Rentals Crime however appears to have the most <b>serious</b> <b>negative</b> <b>impact</b> on the businesses in this area. Medical practices in the area surprisingly do not appear to have stock control systems in place. Operating costs were high for clothing businesses and general dealers. Location appears to be a problem for general dealers, jewelers, medical practices and clothing businesses. Crime appears to be a problem especially for jewelers, medical practices, and general dealers. General dealers, hairdressers and clothing businesses are affected by competition from similar businesses. Clothing businesses are negatively impacted by changes in distribution patterns. There does not seem to be much difference between retail, service and other businesses with respect to internal and external problems. There also does not seem to be much difference between owners, managers and partners with respect to internal and external problems...|$|R
