25|$|In 1871, the {{government}} established the Red Cloud Agency on the Platte River, downstream from Fort Laramie. As {{outlined in the}} 1868 Treaty, the <b>agency</b> <b>staff</b> were responsible for issuing weekly rations to the Oglala, {{as well as providing}} the annually distributed supply of cash and annuity goods. The agent and Washington officials would determine how much of the annuity was to be paid in cash or goods, and sometimes the supplies were late, in poor condition, inadequate in amount, or never arrived at all. Red Cloud took his band to the agency (a predecessor of the Native American reservation) and tried to help them in the transition to a different way of life. In the fall of 1873, the agency was removed to the upper White River in northwestern Nebraska.|$|E

500|$|The band {{began work}} on a debut album, {{alongside}} producer Paul Sampson. Ieuan introduced Sampson to Aled Richards, who later replaced him as Catatonia's drummer when Ieuan left to join the Super Furry Animals. The label wanted to market the band, and so at some expense, had [...] photographer Gered Mankowitz conduct a photoshoot with Matthews. She, the band and their management all hated the photos, but the label wanted to use them {{in order not to}} write the cost off as a loss. In order to have some photos, a series of black and white photos of Matthews drinking a bottle of wine while wearing a Pepsi T-shirt were taken by one of the press <b>agency</b> <b>staff.</b> Warner Bros liked the images and authorised their use. The band had a recording session at Sawmills Studios, Cornwall, which saw some disagreements during recording between Matthews and Roberts.

500|$|Metro {{officials}} considered shifting construction {{funds from}} the southern Green Line to the northern Green Line in order to start construction on that end of the line, but the D.C. City Council opposed this shift. Metro held the court-ordered hearings in June 1982, at which Prince George's residents argued that they had voted for Metro's 1968 bond issue based on the original Green Line route. Metro promised attendees at the hearing that <b>agency</b> <b>staff</b> would study the Green Line route and issue a report recommending a route, after which construction on the Anacostia River tunnel would begin. The site of the tunnel thus became an issue, with some residents arguing for a tunnel from the Navy Yard under Anacostia Park to Martin Luther King, Jr. Avenue SE, while others wanted the tunnel {{to take a more}} northerly route alongside the 11th Street Bridges to Good Hope Road SE. In October 1982, Metro estimated that opening of the Green Line to Anacostia would happen in the [...] "late 1980s", and in November a Metro staff report recommended construction of the Rosecroft Raceway route.|$|E

40|$|Preliminary draft. Please do not cite. In Japan, {{non-regular}} employment, such as part-time {{and temporary}} work, has in-creased as {{a proportion of}} the workforce in recent years. This paper examines whether the expansion of temporary employment has caused an increased perception of job in-security among existing workers. I exploit the temporary staffing deregulation of 2004, which allowed temporary <b>agency</b> <b>staffing</b> for production line work in manufacturing, and use a difference-in-differences (DD) methodology to identify the impact of the legal change on changes in perceptions of job insecurity among low-skilled manufacturing workers. I find that the temporary <b>agency</b> <b>staffing</b> deregulation contributed signifi-cantly to a rise in perceived job insecurity among low-skilled manufacturing workers...|$|R
