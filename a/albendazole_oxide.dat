Most of it is oxidized into albendazole sulfoxide (also known as ricobendazole and <b>albendazole</b> <b>oxide)</b> in the liver by cytochrome P450 oxidases (CYPs) and a flavin-containing monooxygenase (FMO), which was discovered later. In humans, the cytochrome P450 oxidases are thought to include CYP3A4 and CYP1A1, while those in the rats {{are thought to be}} CYP2C6 and CYP2A1.|$|E
