40|$|In {{this paper}} we propose a new dynamic video {{summarization}} procedure. For this purpose, we find an economical image representation in terms of edge-like features that facilitates video re-sampling with minimal loss of information. We propose a fast noise tolerant way to extract the representation. We argue against the use of an <b>auxiliary</b> <b>descriptor</b> for the samples and we show how we can re-use the existing Principal Components Analysis (PCA) with the appropriate modifications on the new imagerepresentation without sacrificing accuracy. © 2009 IEEE...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to show a novel {{fault-tolerant}} tracking control (FTC) strategy with robust fault estimation and compensating for simultaneous actuator sensor faults. Based on the framework of fault-tolerant control, developing an FTC design method for wind turbines is a challenge and, thus, they can tolerate simultaneous pitch actuator and pitch sensor faults having bounded first time derivatives. The paper’s key contribution is proposing a descriptor sliding mode method, in which for establishing a novel augmented descriptor system, with which we can estimate the state of system and reconstruct fault by designing descriptor sliding mode observer, the paper introduces an <b>auxiliary</b> <b>descriptor</b> state vector composed by a system state vector, actuator fault vector, and sensor fault vector. By the optimized method of LMI, the conditions for stability that estimated error dynamics are set up to promote the determination of the parameters designed. With this estimation, and designing a fault-tolerant controller, the system’s stability can be maintained. The effectiveness of the design strategy is verified by implementing the controller in the National Renewable Energy Laboratory’s 5 -MW nonlinear, high-fidelity wind turbine model (FAST) and simulating it in MATLAB/Simulink...|$|E
40|$|Abstract — Prediction {{of natural}} gas {{consumption}} is {{an important element in}} gas load management aimed to better utilize the facilities of a gas distribution system. The major challenges faced by developers of prediction systems are the variety and volatility of consumer profiles, strong seasonal dependency and dependency on climatic conditions, and lack of extensive and reliable historical data. In this paper, the problem of seasonal dependency is tackled with a recurrent neural network used as a gate for a statistical mixture model. Historical consumption data along with climatic conditions and other <b>auxiliary</b> <b>descriptors</b> are combined with expert delineation of heating season boundaries to provide training data. The resulting gating system is capable of reliable identification of the start and end of the heating season and, combined with the statistical models, of accurate predictions of gas load. I...|$|R
40|$|In this work, a novel robust fault {{detection}} algorithm is investigated for stochastic distribution systems with multiple uncertainties, where the output is characterised by its measured output probability density function. By constructing an <b>auxiliary</b> augmented stochastic <b>descriptor</b> system, the original stochastic distribution system is transferred into a descriptor system subjected to model uncertainties, where a proportional and derivative descriptor estimator is developed {{to solve the}} {{fault detection}} problem. The system input and the output probability density function {{are used in the}} design of this estimator. Furthermore, the derivative gain of the estimator is chosen to attenuate the output uncertainties, and the free parameters embedded inside the proportional gain are selected to generate an optimally robust residual signal for fault detection so as to achieve a situation where this residual signal is sensitive to system faults while insensitive to model uncertainties, input disturbances and output noises. A numerical example is given, and the simulation result shows satisfactory detection performance...|$|R
