At his second trial on March 16, 2009, Lee Woods was found guilty of <b>aggravated</b> <b>murder,</b> attempted <b>aggravated</b> <b>murder,</b> and 3 charges of gun possession.

50|$|In the United States and Canada, {{these murders}} are {{referred}} to as first-degree or <b>aggravated</b> <b>murders.</b> Murder, under English criminal law, always carries a mandatory life sentence, but is not classified into degrees.

25|$|On July 29, the {{day after}} the shooting, Haq {{appeared}} in court for his bail hearing. King County, Washington District Court Judge Barbara Linde found that the King County Prosecuting Attorney's Office had probable cause to charge Haq with one count of murder and five counts of attempted murder. Before the proceedings began, Haq requested that the judge allow him to not attend the hearing. Linde denied both this request and another motion to bar cameras and video taping from the courtroom. She also set Haq's bail at $50 million. On August 2, Haq was formally charged with nine felonies: <b>aggravated</b> <b>murder,</b> five counts of attempted murder, kidnapping, burglary and malicious harassment. Malicious harassment is a hate crime under Washington State law. <b>Aggravated</b> <b>murder,</b> the most serious of the nine charges, carries only two possible sentences in Washington: life in prison or the death penalty. The prosecution, however, ultimately decided not to seek the death penalty because of Haq's history of mental illness.|$|E

He pleaded guilty to <b>aggravated</b> <b>murder,</b> the only crime subject to capital punishment in Oregon, and was {{sentenced to life in prison}} without the possibility of parole.|$|E
25|$|In addition, crimes such as treason, espionage, insurrection, piracy, <b>aggravated</b> <b>murder,</b> {{kidnapping}} with torture, felonies {{committed with}} the use of torture, setting a bomb in a street, arson of a dwelling house, and armed robbery made their authors liable to the death penalty; moreover, committing some military offenses such as mutiny or desertion or being accomplice or attempting to commit a capital felony were also capital offenses.|$|E

25|$|On September 21, 2009, Joel Patrick Courtney {{pleaded guilty}} to <b>aggravated</b> <b>murder</b> {{and was sentenced to}} life in prison without the {{possibility}} of parole for Wilberger's death. The deal spared Courtney from the death penalty, in exchange for providing information about the location of Wilberger's body. In addition, the deal also called for Courtney to be imprisoned in his home state, New Mexico, instead of Oregon where the crime was committed.|$|E
25|$|His murderer, 19-year-old Jesse Fanus, was apprehended {{one week}} later. In April 1999, {{he was convicted}} on two counts of <b>aggravated</b> <b>murder</b> (and 11 {{additional}} felony charge) and sentenced to death. In 2003, his conviction and death sentence were upheld by the Oregon Supreme Court. In December 2011, the sentence was overturned based on the prisoner's inadequate legal representation; a new sentencing session was expected in 2015. Fanus {{was sentenced to life}} in prison without the possibility of parole on May 7, 2015.|$|E
25|$|Police {{eventually}} linked Courtney, {{a native}} of Beaverton, Oregon, to the disappearance of Wilberger and in August 2005 he was charged on 19 counts of <b>aggravated</b> <b>murder,</b> kidnapping, sexual abuse, rape and sodomy. Court documents released in 2008 revealed details showing that Courtney was in Corvallis when Wilberger disappeared and that the green van he was driving was spotted by several people, including an OSU employee who identified him from a photo lineup. Officials said that Wilberger's DNA was found inside the van, along with her hair.|$|E

25|$|The {{death penalty}} in {{mainland}} China is officially administered only to offenders of serious and violent crimes, such as <b>aggravated</b> <b>murder,</b> but China retains in law a number of nonviolent death penalty offences such as drug trafficking. The People's Republic of China administers more official death penalties than any other country, though other countries (such as Iran and Singapore) have higher official execution rates. Reliable NGOs such as Amnesty International and Human Rights in China have informed the public that the total execution numbers, with unofficial death penalties included, greatly exceed officially recorded executions; in 2009, the Dui Hua Foundation estimated that 5,000 people were executed in China – far more than all other nations combined. The precise number of executions {{is regarded as a}} state secret.|$|E
25|$|The {{death penalty}} was again {{abolished}} on 26 May 1947, the strictest sentence becoming 25 years' imprisonment, {{before it was}} restored on 12 May 1950: first for treason and espionage, and then for <b>aggravated</b> <b>murder.</b> The Penal Code of 1960 significantly extended the list of capital crimes. According to 1985-1989 statistics, the death penalty accounted for less than 1 in 2000 sentences. According to the GARF archives database, between 1978 and 1985 there were 3,058 sentences to death that had been appealed to the Supreme Soviet of the RSFSR. At least one woman was executed during this time, Antonina Makarova, on August 11, 1978. After {{the fall of the}} Soviet Union, the Russian Federation carried out the death penalty intermittently, with up to 10 or so officially a year. In 1996, pending Russia's entry into the Council of Europe, a moratorium was placed on the death penalty, which is still in place as of 2017.|$|E

As noted by Justice Davis, had the crime occurred post-2005, then {{it is likely that}} significantly higher minimum terms would have been imposed on the perpetrators owing to reforms in the Criminal Justice Act 2003.

500|$|In February 2003, Thompson asked {{permission}} to file an amicus curiae (or [...] "friend of the court") brief in the Ohio case of Dustin Lynch, 16, who {{was charged with}} <b>aggravated</b> <b>murder</b> {{in the death of}} JoLynn Mishne; Lynch was [...] "obsessed" [...] with Grand Theft Auto III.

500|$|Although {{his efforts}} dealing with video games have {{generally}} focused on juveniles, Thompson {{got involved in}} a case involving an adult on one occasion in 2004. This was an <b>aggravated</b> <b>murder</b> case against 29-year-old Charles McCoy, Jr., the defendant {{in a series of}} highway shootings the previous year around Columbus, Ohio. When McCoy was captured, a game console and a copy of The Getaway were in his motel room. Although not representing McCoy and over the objections of McCoy's lawyers, Thompson succeeded in getting the court to unseal a search warrant for McCoy's residence. This showed, among other things, the discovery of additional games State of Emergency, Max Payne, and Dead to Rights. However, he was not allowed to present the evidence to McCoy, whose defense team was relying on an insanity defense based on paranoid schizophrenia. In Thompson's estimation, McCoy was the [...] "functional equivalent of a 15-year-old," [...] and [...] "the only thing insane about this case is the (insanity) defense".|$|E

5000|$|Even when an American {{politician}} mentions {{capital punishment}} in Singapore, {{the application of}} the death penalty in the United States is limited by the Eighth Amendment to the United States Constitution to only <b>aggravated</b> <b>murders</b> committed by mentally competent adults.
