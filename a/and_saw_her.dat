As a gift to Celeus, because of his hospitality, Demeter planned to make his son Demophon a god, but she was unable to complete the ritual because his mother Metanira walked in <b>and</b> <b>saw</b> <b>her</b> son in the fire and screamed in fright, which angered Demeter, who lamented that foolish mortals do not understand the concept and ritual.|$|E
5|$|Morgan began serious {{training}} in early 1956 and won Olympic selection for the relay team {{as well as}} the 400-metre freestyle. Morgan's selection in the final quartet raised controversy because of her inexperience in top-level racing and her history of false starts. During the final, she lifted her head out of the water <b>and</b> <b>saw</b> <b>her</b> American opponent ahead of her, prompting her to regain the lead with a late burst in the third leg. Australia {{went on to win the}} relay in world record time. In her only individual event, Morgan came sixth in the 400-metre freestyle.|$|E
5|$|Liz {{attempts}} to make amends by talking to Tracy during a rehearsal, during which she makes negative remarks about Jenna {{and the other members}} of her staff. Liz is notified by Kenneth Parcell (Jack McBrayer) that her chat with Tracy was aired over the studio's monitors, which meant that everyone heard <b>and</b> <b>saw</b> <b>her</b> making the comments. Liz's staff show their displeasure by throwing food and other objects at her. Liz and Tracy discuss an idea to get everyone together to try and smooth things over, and Tracy decides to invite Liz and the staff to a party aboard a yacht. Tracy gets along well with everyone at the party, including Jenna, and things appear to be going very well. Liz soon discovers that the yacht does not belong to Tracy, and the yacht's real owner shows up with the NYPD. The following day Liz learns that Jack paid the newspapers to keep Tracy out of the press but left a photo of Jenna passing out on the yacht in their pages, which Jenna sees as exciting and flattering.|$|E

25|$|Two {{years later}} on July 12, 1955, shortly before her 11th birthday, Muir was {{admitted}} into the institution {{solely on the}} basis of information provided by her mother, without any diagnostic testing. She thought she had been sent to an orphanage. Under superintendent Leonard Jan Le Vann, a precondition for admission into the Provincial Training School was a signature from Muir's mother permitting the legal enforcement of compulsory sterilization. Over the years, Muir was educated to a grade 5 level <b>and</b> <b>saw</b> <b>her</b> mother only intermittently until her departure from the institution at the age of 20.|$|E

She torched the house and fled. Lamphere had helped her, he admitted, but she had not left by the road where he waited for her after the fire had been set. In the end, she had betrayed him, cutting across open fields and disappearing into the woods.

25|$|In 1776, at the {{outbreak}} of the American Revolutionary War, Louis returned to Europe aboard HMS Thetis and joined the ship of the line HMS Bienfaisant. He was promoted to lieutenant, and in 1778 participated at the First Battle of Ushant, a British victory under Augustus Keppel. He was present at the Action of 8 January 1780, where he took command of a captured Spanish ship of the line, the Guipuzcoana. A week later, he was back aboard Bienfaisant as it engaged the Spanish at the Battle of Cape St Vincent and was badly damaged by the larger Spanish battleship Fenix.

25|$|The crew of HMS Haslemere spotted Johnson's {{parachute}} {{coming down}} <b>and</b> <b>saw</b> <b>her</b> {{alive in the}} water, calling for help. Conditions were poor â€“ there was a heavy sea and a strong tide, snow was falling and it was intensely cold. Lt Cmdr Walter Fletcher, the commander of Haslemere, dived into the water {{in an attempt to}} rescue Johnson. Fletcher failed in the attempt. As a result of the intense cold he died in hospital days later. In 2016, Alec Gill, a historian, claimed that the son of a crew member stated that Johnson had died because she was sucked into the blades of the ship's propellers; the crewman did not observe this to occur, but only supposed that it might have done. This claim has not been verified, as Johnson's body was never recovered.|$|E
25|$|Once, while Parvati {{wanted to}} take a bath, there were no attendants around to guard her and stop anyone from accidentally {{entering}} the house. Hence she created an image of a boy out of turmeric paste which she prepared to cleanse her body, and infused life into it, and thus Ganesha was born. Parvati ordered Ganesha not to allow anyone to enter the house, and Ganesha obediently followed his mother's orders. After a while Shiva returned and tried to enter the house, Ganesha stopped him. Shiva was infuriated, lost his temper and severed the boy's head with his trident. When Parvati came out <b>and</b> <b>saw</b> <b>her</b> son's lifeless body, she was very angry. She demanded that Shiva restore Ganesha's life at once. Shiva did so by attaching an elephant's head to Ganesha's body, thus giving rise to the elephant headed deity.|$|E

25|$|Lisa {{was born}} at Lourdes Hospital in the City of Manila, Philippines. She is the {{daughter}} of Cesar Macuja and Susan Pacheco. Lisa is the second among four siblings. Her elder brother, Julio II (Joly) was born in 1963. She had a younger brother who was a teenage actor and musical artist named Jerome who was born in 1967, but died in a car accident on September 30, 1984, just three days before her 20th birthday, during her first season at the Kirov Ballet. She is the sister of Gia Macuja Atchison, an actress and musical artist, who was born in 1971, and who is married to musician Robert Atchison. Raised as a Catholic, Lisa attended St. Theresa's College in Quezon City, Philippines, where she was a consistent honor student in grade school until she graduated salutatorian in her high school class. At age 8, she started her first ballet class with Felicitas Layag-Radaic as her mentor, who kept a vigilant eye on her early years as a ballerina, <b>and</b> <b>saw</b> <b>her</b> through five Royal Academy of Dancing (RAD) syllabus examinations in the ten years while she was under her school. At age 11, she danced onstage {{for the first time in}} a ballet recital called Twinkle Toes in Tinsel Land that was shown on February 29, 1976 at the Meralco Theater, Pasig City, Philippines. She was an apprentice and young soloist of Dance Theater Philippines (DTP). She received her advanced certificate from the Royal Academy of Dancing, and earned a scholarship to the Vaganova Choreographic Institute in Leningrad. She was the principal dancer of the renowned Kirov Ballet between 1984 and 1986. She returned to Manila in 1986 and became the first artist-in-residence of the Cultural Center of the Philippines (CCP) while dancing with Ballet Philippines. In 1988, she became a ballerina of the Philippine Ballet Theater (PBT) and had since remained Philippine-based, performing as principal ballerina in major local productions and as international guest artist in Russia, Lithuania, Latvia, Ukraine, Georgia, Armenia, the United States, Cuba, Mexico, Japan, South Korea, Malaysia, Singapore, and New Zealand.

500|$|In September 1833, after {{traveling}} to the French village of BesanÃ§on to find cheap paper for a publishing enterprise, Balzac crossed into Switzerland and registered at the HÃ´tel du Faucon under the name Marquis d'Entragues. He sent word to HaÅ„ska that he would visit the garden of the Maison AndriÃ©, {{where she and her}} family were staying. He looked up <b>and</b> <b>saw</b> <b>her</b> face at the window, thenâ€“ as he described it laterâ€“ he [...] "lost all bodily sensation". They met later that day (September 25) at a spot overlooking Lake NeuchÃ¢tel; according to legend, he noticed a woman reading one of his books.

500|$|Stanton, {{who is a}} Christian, named EVE {{after the}} Biblical figure because WALL-E's {{loneliness}} reminded him of Adam, before God created his wife. Dreher noted EVE's biblical namesake <b>and</b> <b>saw</b> <b>her</b> directive as an inversion of that story; EVE uses the plant to tell humanity to return to Earth and {{move away from the}} [...] "false god" [...] of BnL and the lazy lifestyle it offers. Dreher also noted this departure from classical Christian viewpoints, where Adam is cursed to labor, in that WALL-E argues hard work is what makes humans human. Dreher emphasized the false god parallels to BnL in a scene where a robot teaches infants [...] "B is for Buy n Large, your very best friend", which he compared to modern corporations such as McDonald's creating brand loyalty in children. Megan Basham of World magazine felt the film criticizes the pursuit of leisure, whereas WALL-E in his stewardship learns to truly appreciate God's creation.|$|E
500|$|Following the {{introduction}} of her siblings, Donna's mother was also introduced in February 2009. Australian actress and singer, Tottie Goldsmith was given the role of Cassandra Freedman. Goldsmith described her character as being [...] "manipulative" [...] and [...] "insanely selfish". Donna and her mother were seen clashing on many occasions as Cassandra had hurt her daughter {{a lot in the}} past. Cassandra was a young girl when she had Donna and she did not have the maturity to deal with a baby. Goldsmith said that Cassandra [...] "resented Donna <b>and</b> <b>saw</b> <b>her</b> as a threat. Over the years, Cass has hurt Donna so much that her daughter's almost become immune to the way her mother behaves". Goldsmith added that Cassandra is not a [...] "maternal person" [...] and she {{has not been able to}} connect with her children. Cassandra moves into the street in a bid to win over wealthy resident, Paul Robinson (Stefan Dennis). She is later driven out of town after she makes her relationship with Donna worse.|$|E
500|$|Upon {{her return}} to London, Lloyd {{introduced}} [...] "Listen With the Right Ear", which was an intended follow-up to [...] "Oh You Wink the Other Eye".

She changed the lyrics to some of her best-known songs for her French audience and retitled them, [...] "The Naughty Continong"; [...] "Twiggy Vous"; [...] "I'm Just Back from Paris" [...] and [...] "The Coster Honeymoon in Paris". At Christmas in 1893, she returned to London to honour her final Drury Lane commitment, starring as Polly Perkins in Robinson Crusoe. The part allowed her to perform [...] "The Barmaid" [...] and [...] "The Naughty Continong" [...] <b>and</b> <b>saw</b> <b>her</b> perform a mazurka with Leno.
