Problems with checklist use and pilots failures to monitor adequately {{have a long}} history in aviation accidents. This study was conducted to explore why checklists <b>and</b> <b>monitoring</b> sometimes fail to catch errors and equipment malfunctions as intended. Flight crew procedures were observed from the cockpit jumpseat during normal airline operations in order to: 1) collect data on <b>monitoring</b> <b>and</b> checklist use in cockpit operations in typical flight conditions; 2) provide a plausible cognitive account of why deviations from formal checklist <b>and</b> <b>monitoring</b> procedures sometimes occur; 3) lay a foundation for identifying ways to reduce vulnerability to inadvertent checklist <b>and</b> <b>monitoring</b> errors; 4) compare checklist <b>and</b> <b>monitoring</b> execution in normal flights with performance issues uncovered in accident investigations; and 5) suggest ways to improve the effectiveness of checklists <b>and</b> <b>monitoring.</b> Cognitive explanations for deviations from prescribed procedures are provided, along with suggestions for countermeasures for vulnerability to error...|$|R

5|$|CBS began a shortwave {{listening}} {{program in}} September 1939, on an experimental basis, at the National Lawn Tennis Championships at West Side Tennis Club in Forest Hills, New York. Engineers installed equipment at the CBS booth when the location {{was found to}} have good reception, <b>and</b> <b>monitors</b> relayed European shortwave news to CBS headquarters in New York between tennis matches. Throughout World War II, CBS captured Allied and enemy shortwave communications from more than 60 international stations via secretly located receivers. Translations of intercepted broadcasts were teletyped to all New York newspapers, Associated Press, United Press International and International News Service, and in turn disseminated to newspapers and radio stations throughout the United States. Major headline news frequently resulted, since big stories often broke first on radio.|$|E
5|$|Each {{engine is}} {{equipped}} with a main engine controller (MEC), an integrated computer which controls all of the engine's functions (through the use of valves) <b>and</b> <b>monitors</b> its performance. Built by Honeywell Aerospace, each MEC originally comprised two redundant Honeywell HDC-601 computers, later upgraded to a system composed of two doubly redundant Motorola 68000 (M68000) processors (for a total of four M68000s per controller). Having the controller installed on the engine itself greatly simplifies the wiring between the engine and the launch vehicle, because all the sensors and actuators are connected directly to only the controller, each MEC then being connected to the orbiter's general purpose computers (GPCs) or the SLS's avionics suite via its own engine interface unit (EIU). Using a dedicated system also simplifies the software and thus improves its reliability.|$|E

40|$|The {{importance}} of planning <b>and</b> <b>monitoring</b> in any activities, more particularly researches {{can never be}} over-emphasized. Inadequate research planning <b>and</b> <b>monitoring</b> leads to delayed delivery of results, inefficient use of resources and increased cost.

5|$|Eisenhower {{would leave}} office with an {{agreement}} out of reach, as Eisenhower's technical advisors, upon whom he relied heavily, became {{mired in the}} complex technical questions of a test ban, driven {{in part by a}} strong interest among American experts to lower the error rate of seismic test detection technology. Some, including Kistiakowsky, would eventually raise concerns about the ability of inspections <b>and</b> <b>monitors</b> to successfully detect tests. The primary product of negotiations under Eisenhower was the testing moratorium without any enforcement mechanism. Ultimately, the goal of a comprehensive test ban would be abandoned in favor of a partial ban due to questions over seismic detection of underground tests.|$|E
5|$|NASA's {{center in}} Houston has {{its origins in}} the Space Task Group which {{directed}} its first manned spaceflight program, Project Mercury. In 1961, it grew into a bigger organization as the Manned Spacecraft Center, and in 1962 moved into a newly built campus on land donated by Rice University. It was renamed the Lyndon B. Johnson Space Center (JSC) in honor of Texas U.S. Senator, Vice President, and President Lyndon B. Johnson in 1973, the year Johnson died. As Senate Majority Leader, Johnson played a decisive role in passage of the legislation which created NASA in 1958. JSC contains the Christopher C.

5|$|Lincoln is {{equipped}} with a WSR-88D (NEXRAD) radar, one of 159 high-resolution Doppler weather radars operated by the National Weather Service. The Lincoln office is also equipped with an Advanced Weather Interactive Processing System (AWIPS) that greatly increases monitoring capabilities of weather, satellite, and computer model data by forecasters. In addition the Lincoln office is also in charge of Automated Surface Observing Systems (ASOS) at General Wayne A. Downing Peoria International Airport and Abraham Lincoln Capital Airport. NWS Lincoln employs both short and long term weather forecasters who each have vital duties. The short term forecaster issues the Hazardous Weather Outlook, river forecast products <b>and</b> <b>monitors</b> thunderstorm activity as it develops. The long term forecaster plans weather forecasts up until seven days into the future, coordinates with other long term forecasters in neighboring regions and issues advisories for Winter weather and dense fog. There are also meteorologists assigned to data acquisition responsibilities, staff in this position are responsible for monitoring weather balloons, river stage observations, operation of the NOAA weather radio system and operations of the cooperative observer network. During times of Severe Weather NWS Lincoln divides its covered area into various geographic districts with different forecasters handling the severe weather operation {{of his or her own}} sector. Depending on the severity of the outbreak NWS Lincoln employs 2 to 6 meteorologists to issue any warnings. Volunteer HAM radio operators are also present during most severe weather outbreaks, coordinating information between weather spotters and forecasters.|$|E

40|$|This {{document}} {{explores the}} potential of collaborative approaches for nontimber forest product inventory <b>and</b> <b>monitoring</b> in the United States. It begins by reviewing results of a federal and state survey that documented inventory <b>and</b> <b>monitoring</b> efforts for nontimber forest products in the United States. The surveys show {{that the majority of}} NTFP-related inventory <b>and</b> <b>monitoring</b> on National Forests and state forests consists of non-scientific forms of monitoring, such as tracking permits, general site inspections, and informal visual checks of harvest areas. We argue that broadening participation in inventory <b>and</b> <b>monitoring</b> efforts can provide managers and policymakers with the data needed to develop and maintain sustainable NTFP management programs in an era of declining forest management budgets and staffing levels. Our fieldwork with NTFP harvesters identified several characteristics of harvesters and their work that could be compatible with or enhance inventory <b>and</b> <b>monitoring</b> efforts. In addition, harvester perspectives regarding incentives for participation are discussed. Profiles of eight participatory inventory <b>and</b> <b>monitoring</b> projects illustrate how this concept has already been put into practice. We then draw on our ethnographic research and results from four regional workshops to explore the barriers to involving harvesters in inventory <b>and</b> <b>monitoring</b> of NTFP species. In testing the idea of collaboration, we found that NTFP stakeholders are generally supportive of th...|$|R
