5|$|Kouao {{herself was}} called to the inquiry, {{becoming}} the first convicted murderer to appear in person in a public inquiry. She initially refused to answer questions, <b>and</b> <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>did,</b> protested her innocence, first in French, then, raising her voice in anger, in English. Giving evidence by video link from prison, Manning apologised for his actions and {{said that it was}} not the fault of the various agencies that Climbié died. Broadcasters applied for access to this video, but Laming refused the application. Climbié's parents gave evidence and were present at most of the hearings, becoming distressed when hearing of Climbié's plight and seeing pictures of her injuries. They blamed Haringey council and its chief executive for Climbié's death.|$|E
25|$|At about 3:00p.m., {{shortly after}} forcing {{a group of}} police {{officers}} to take cover in a ditch, Bryant rang the local police station. The wife {{of one of the}} police officers answered the phone. Bryant asked who she was and if she knew where her husband was. He again called himself Jamie. He asked if she knew whether or not her husband was okay, <b>and</b> <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>did</b> not answer, Bryant then told her he was okay and that he knew where her husband was.|$|E
25|$|During {{everyday}} {{interactions with}} other people Genie inconsistently applied what linguistic abilities she possessed, although her use of both vocabulary and grammar remained better in imitation than in her own spontaneous speech. Her ability and willingness to engage in verbal interactions steadily increased during her stay with the Riglers, and she used her language to serve a progressively larger number of functions. Nonetheless, she continued to speak very little, <b>and</b> <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>did</b> talk it was almost always in utterances significantly shorter than she was actually able to spontaneously produce. Because of this, the scientists wrote that it was extremely difficult to analyze her comprehension and use of grammar in conversations.|$|E

25|$|The {{scientists}} also measured Genie's conversational competence. Most verbal {{interactions with}} her consisted either of someone asking her a question several times until she responded or her saying something {{to which the}} other person responded, and unless she actively attempted to control a conversation's direction she relied on the other person to achieve and maintain its flow. She typically did not acknowledge statements, requests, or other common pieces of conversation, <b>and</b> <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>did</b> respond it was often with a significant delay. Curtiss wrote that Genie grew progressively better at both, although even by mid-1975 she did not always respond or took an unusually long time to do so. If she did respond she often repeated something said earlier, and she used repetitive statements to serve several conversational functions.|$|E
500|$|Arizona {{left the}} yard on 3 April 1917, {{and three days}} later, the United States {{declared}} war on Germany. [...] Assigned to Battleship Division8 operating out of the York River, Arizona was only employed as a gunnery training ship for the crewmen on armed merchant vessels crossing the Atlantic in convoys. Shortly after the war began, eight of her 5-inch guns (the four guns farthest forward and the sternmost four guns) were removed to equip merchant ships. When the ship sailed near {{the wreck of the}} old San Marcos (ex-Texas), the wreck was sometimes used as a target for the 14-inch guns. Arizona rarely ventured into the ocean for fear of U-boats, <b>and</b> <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>did,</b> {{it was only in the}} company of other battleships and escort ships. Four coal-fired American dreadnoughts were eventually sent across the Atlantic in December 1917 as Battleship Division Nine, but Arizona was not among them, as it was easier to obtain coal than oil in the United Kingdom. Life for Arizonas crew was not all training as the race-boat team from Arizona was able to win the Battenberg Cup in July 1918 by beating the team from Nevada by three lengths over the three-mile course.|$|E
500|$|Despite their marital problems, Lloyd went on an American {{tour with}} Hurley in 1908. She {{was eager to}} equal the success of her sister Alice, who had become popular in the country a few years previously. By 1910, Marie's {{relationship}} with Hurley had ended, {{due in part to}} her endless parties and her developing friendship with the jockey Bernard Dillon, winner of the 1910 Derby. [...] Lloyd and the young sportsman began an open and passionate affair. [...] For the first time, her private life eclipsed her professional career. She was seldom mentioned in the theatrical press in 1910, <b>and</b> <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>did</b> perform, it was not to the best of her abilities. [...] The writer Arnold Bennett, who witnessed her on stage at the Tivoli Theatre in 1909, admitted that he [...] "couldn't see the legendary cleverness of the vulgarity of Marie Lloyd" [...] and accused her songs of being [...] "variations of the same theme of sexual naughtiness." [...] As with Courtenay years previously, the shy and retiring Dillon was finding it hard to adapt to Lloyd's elaborate and sociable lifestyle. Dillon's success on the racecourse was short lived. In 1911, he was expelled from the Jockey Club for borrowing £660 to bet on his own horses to win. Dillon's horses lost, and he ended up in debt to trainers. He became jealous of Lloyd's successful life in the spotlight. [...] Depression led to drink and obesity, and he started to abuse her. [...] Hurley, meanwhile, had initiated divorce proceedings, the strain of which caused him to drink heavily, which in turn finished his theatrical career. Lloyd left the marital home in Hampstead and moved to Golders Green with Dillon, a move which MacQueen-Pope describes as being [...] "the worst thing she ever did." ...|$|E

2500|$|In 1973, Genie began {{optionally}} articulating consonant clusters {{consisting of}} an [...] {{followed by a}} nasal consonant. For words starting with an [...] followed by other types of consonant clusters Genie started {{to break up the}} cluster with an epenthetic schwa and soon after, in longer words where she would have previously deleted a vowel, she began to include a schwa where the deleted sound would have been; because reduced vowels in English are generally schwas, linguists thought she could have been gaining command of English phonology. Around the same time, linguists noted that she began to pronounce more final consonants. By 1975 Genie started to pronounce both voiced and voiceless dental fricatives, albeit rarely, in various word positions, <b>and</b> <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>did</b> she frequently stopped them.|$|E
2500|$|On August 1, 1943, Litvyak did {{not come}} back to her base at Krasnyy Luch. It was her fourth sortie of the day, escorting a flight of Ilyushin Il-2 Shturmoviks. As the Soviets were {{returning}} to base near Orel, a pair of Bf 109 fighters dived on Litvyak while she was attacking {{a large group of}} German bombers. Soviet pilot Ivan Borisenko recalled: “Lily just didn’t see the Messerschmitt 109s flying cover for the German bombers. A pair of them dived on her <b>and</b> <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>did</b> see them she turned to meet them. Then they all disappeared behind a cloud.” Borisenko, involved in the dogfight, saw her a last time, through a gap in the clouds, her Yak-1 pouring smoke and pursued by as many as eight Bf 109s.|$|E
2500|$|Snook {{was lost}} while {{conducting}} her ninth war patrol, in the South China Sea and Luzon Strait. On 8 April, she reported her position to submarine [...] <b>and</b> <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>did</b> not acknowledge messages sent from Tigrone the next day, it was presumed {{that she had}} headed toward Luzon Strait. On 12 April, she was ordered to take lifeguard station {{in the vicinity of}} Sakishima Gunto in support of British carrier air strikes. On 20 April, the commander of the British carrier task force reported that he had a plane down in Snooks assigned area, and that he could not contact the submarine by radio. Snook was ordered to search the area and to acknowledge the order. When she failed to make a transmission, submarine [...] was sent to make the search and rendezvous with Snook. Although Bang arrived and rescued the downed aviators, she saw no sign of the missing submarine; on 16 May, Snook was presumed lost due to unknown causes. It is believed that she was sunk by kaibokans Okinawa, CD-8, CD-32 and CD-52. It has also been suggested that Snook may have been lost in combat with one of five Japanese submarines which were also lost in April–May 1945. One candidate is the Japanese submarine I-56 [...] (type B3) but it is just a hypothesis because it is not confirmed by a single Japanese source.|$|E

2500|$|Larey {{then picked}} up Hollis' pants and pulled out his wallet and told the assailant, [...] "He doesn't have any money." [...] The assailant {{told her she was}} lying and that she had a purse. Larey told him that she did not and was knocked to the ground. She said she felt like she was hit with an iron pipe. The assailant ordered her to get up, <b>and,</b> <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>did,</b> he told her to run. As she ran towards a ditch, the assailant told her not to go that way but to run up the road. She stated that while she was running, she heard Hollis groaning, and that the man {{continued}} to beat and stomp him. She was having trouble running in her high heels when the assailant ran after her. She saw an older car parked further up the street facing their vehicle. She quickly looked inside to see if anyone could help her, but after seeing no one, she began to run and was overtaken by the attacker. The man asked her why she was running. She told him he told her to run. Larey said, [...] "He called me a liar again and then I knew {{that he was going to}} kill me." [...] He knocked her down and assaulted her sexually. Larey stated he did not rape her but abused her terribly. Later reports indicated that the assailant sexually assaulted her with the barrel of his gun.|$|E
2500|$|In the evening, {{at around}} 6 or 7pm, Dan and Joe kidnapped and handcuffed Anton Weekes, a German-Australian market {{gardener}} who lived nearby, reassuring {{him that he}} would not be hurt if he obeyed. They pushed him to the Sherritts' back door and Joe asked Weekes to knock, which he did. Sherritts' young wife asked: [...] "Who is there?", repeated by Sherritt. Prompted by Joe, Weekes replied: [...] "It is me, I have lost my way", to which Sherritt's wife opened the door. Aaron stood framed in the doorway and joked with his German neighbor. [...] "You must be drunk, Anton. You know that it's over that way", he laughed. As Sherritt raised his arm to point the way for Weekes, he almost immediately afterwards made a movement backwards and said, [...] "Who's that?". Two shots were then fired into the house and Sherritt staggered back, having been hit in the left side of the neck, severing his jugular. One of the shots narrowly missed Sherritt's wife. Byrne followed him in and fired again, hitting him in the chest, and Sherritt collapsed. Sherritt died within a few minutes without another saying a word. His mother-in-law, Ellen Barry, testified to the commission that at this point she knelt down by her son-in-law's head, and Byrne called her by her name (they were well acquainted, Ellen Barry had been a particular friend of Byrne's mother) and threatened to shoot her and her daughter if they did not reveal who was in the bedroom. She asked to go outside <b>and</b> <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>did,</b> Byrne took off Weekes' handcuffs, telling her [...] "I am satisfied now, I wanted that fellow."
