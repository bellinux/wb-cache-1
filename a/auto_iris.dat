50|$|Document cameras have a {{wide variety}} of {{sophisticated}} automated systems that are designed to make the user experience as easy as possible. Permanent autofocus detection, for example, automatically adjusts the focus settings when a new object is displayed, with no need for user intervention. Other important features include automatic <b>auto</b> <b>iris,</b> auto exposure, auto white balance and automatic gain control.|$|E
5000|$|The {{company is}} equally owned by {{companies}} like the Limited and <b>Auto</b> <b>Iris</b> Travelers Yeruham Limited. The company owns 500 buses and employs about 2500 employees in three branches - Afula, Yokneam Jerusalem [...] The company owns three parking garages - two garages and service {{offices in the}} Tel Aviv Central Bus Station in Tel Aviv, one in Afula and one at the Jerusalem Central Bus Station. The company also operates special trips to Jerusalem employing about 20 drivers who operate 16 minibuses and 4 full-size buses. In addition, the company also operates specialty lines to transport students.|$|E
40|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} parts of an autonomous robot is to establish the path by which it should navigate in order to successfully achieve its goals. In the case of agricultural robotics, a procedure that determines this desired path can be useful. In this paper, a new virtual sensor is introduced in order to classify the elements of an orange grove. This proposed sensor will be based on a color CCD camera with <b>auto</b> <b>iris</b> lens which is in charge of doing the captures of the real environment and an ensemble of neural networks which processes the capture and differentiates each element of the image. Then, the Houghâ€™s transform and other operations will be applied in order to extract the desired path from the classification performed by the virtual sensory system. With this approach, the robotic system can correct its deviation with respect to the desired path. The results show that the sensory system properly classifies the elements of the grove and can set trajectory of the robot...|$|E
3000|$|Due to the {{requirement}} of low computational time, <b>auto</b> capture in <b>iris</b> sensors is usually based on confidence of segmentation. A major drawback of existing approaches is in the assumption of good quality segmentation before quality assessment. However, same factors that affect biometric quality are also known to effect iris segmentation.|$|R
5000|$|The Link 125 {{camera was}} {{purchased}} in quantity by the BBC and deployed {{to most of}} the studios at Television Centre, Pebble Mill in Birmingham and Belfast as well as several other BBC studios. It was also the camera of choice at Limehouse Television. As well as ITV company Television South (TVS) used the model in its Maidstone studios, which were still in use by those studios when they were sold off as an independent studio facility following the loss of TVS's franchise at the end of 1992.The 125 was a well thought out and well-built studio and OB camera developed from the Link 120 portable camera system. It also contained a comprehensive communications system and used a camera control unit (CCU) based around the 110's but updated with <b>auto</b> black, white, <b>iris</b> and centering functions.The BBC preferred to use a mid range Schneider-Kreuznach lens as it gave good zoom angles. Some believed it produced one of the best images for a pickup tube camera, others believed it could never match the quality of the EMI 2001. Many BBC users felt that the image was soft and not easy to focus, it also produced an unusual image effect that formed the shape of a 'teardrop'The Link 125 was the most successful of all of Links cameras and the last studio to use them was BBC Pebble Mill which decommissioned the last four in 1994 from the news studio having upgraded to Sony BVP-375's and Ikegami HL-55's a few years before. These cameras have become collectable vintage items.|$|R
40|$|Thesis (MTech (Chemical Engineering)) [...] Cape Peninsula University of Technology, 2006 Measurement and {{forecasting}} of visibility {{is essential}} in assessing the extent of visibility degradation (haze) due to air pollution in Cape Town. Rapid impairment in visibility over the years forced the City ofCape Town to initiate the Brown Haze I (BH I) study in September 1997. The main objective of the Brown Haze I Study {{was to determine the}} contribution of all major pollutant sources to the brown haze, and to determine other factors that contribute to haze formation. However to date no study has attempted to devise quantitative methods to monitor visibility in Cape Town. This study reports on a new method of measuting visibility using Digital Image Processing. An hourly series of time-stamped images of three scenic vistas was recorded over a period of 8 months (20060318 to 20061031) using three co-located Sanyo E- 6311 xP-H digital cameras equipped with E- 50500 D 20 to lOOrnrn Variable-focal <b>Auto</b> <b>Iris</b> Lenses. The cameras were orientated in three directions (approximately due west, north and east). These time- stamped images were archived for subsequent digital image processing. The average image intensities of selected areas of each image were calculated using the histogram function of digital image processing software (PhotoshopTM 7. 0), to obtain the inherent and apparent contrast ratios. The inherent and apparent contrast measurements were then used to calculate light extinction coefficient (bex') and the visual range (VR) ...|$|E
