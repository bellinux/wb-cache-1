40|$|This paper {{addresses}} {{the problem of}} automatic temporal annotation of realistic human <b>actions</b> <b>in</b> video using minimal manual supervision. To this end we consider two associated problems: (a) weakly-supervised learning of action models from readily available annotations, and (b) temporal localization of human <b>actions</b> <b>in</b> test videos. To avoid the prohibitive cost of manual annotation for training, we use movie scripts {{as a means of}} weak supervision. Scripts, however, provide only implicit, noisy, and imprecise information about the type and location of <b>actions</b> <b>in</b> video. We address this problem with a kernel-based discriminative clustering algorithm that locates <b>actions</b> <b>in</b> the weakly-labeled training data. Using the obtained action samples, we train temporal action detectors and apply them to locate <b>actions</b> <b>in</b> the raw video data. Our experiments demonstrate that the proposed method for weakly-supervised learning of action models leads to significant improvement <b>in</b> <b>action</b> detection. We present detection results for three <b>action</b> classes <b>in</b> four feature length movies with challenging and realistic video data. 1...|$|R
