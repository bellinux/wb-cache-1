60|$|He {{turned on}} his heel, but the Baron laid his hand upon his {{shoulder}} <b>and</b> <b>peered</b> <b>into</b> his face inquisitively.|$|E
60|$|In vain we wandered up {{and down}} in this isle, <b>and</b> <b>peered</b> <b>into</b> its {{innermost}} recesses: no Yillah was there.|$|E
60|$|Steps again. Silence. A bird {{lights on}} the window ledge, <b>and</b> <b>peers</b> <b>into</b> the room. All is at rest.|$|R
6000|$|Trench had not, in the darkness, {{recognised}} his friend. He now seized him by both shoulders, <b>and</b> <b>peering</b> <b>into</b> his face, said-- ...|$|R
6000|$|Filled with strange, anxious foreboding, he, too, went to {{the door}} of the hut, <b>and</b> <b>peering</b> <b>into</b> the gloom, he asked quickly,-- ...|$|R
60|$|She danced up to {{the little}} looking-glass <b>and</b> <b>peered</b> <b>into</b> it. Her pointed {{freckled}} face and solemn gray eyes peered back at her.|$|E
60|$|Stopping short, Hal {{descended the}} steps, <b>and</b> <b>peered</b> <b>into</b> the window. A middle-aged man {{stood at the}} front desk, smoking a cigar and writing.|$|E
60|$|While {{speaking}} Yellow Elk had leaped {{through the}} brush, {{and now he}} came up <b>and</b> <b>peered</b> <b>into</b> Dick's face. Instantly his eyes filled with anger.|$|E
6000|$|... "Where's the gold?" [...] inquired Jones, gravely, {{going down}} on his knees {{at the side of the}} excavation, <b>and</b> <b>peering</b> <b>into</b> it. [...] "I don't see none, wotsomediver." ...|$|R
6000|$|Miss Vane gave a wild laugh of delight. [...] "You don't mean it!" [...] she sputtered, {{sitting down}} before him, <b>and</b> <b>peering</b> <b>into</b> his face. [...] "What do you mean?" ...|$|R
6000|$|She rose {{swiftly to}} her feet, darting fearful glances on all sides. [...] "What is it?" [...] {{she cried out}} low, <b>and</b> <b>peering</b> <b>into</b> his face. [...] "Where am I?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Perhaps he's right," [...] the {{biologist}} murmured. [...] "But I'd like to {{look for}} myself, if I may." [...] He pushed past Tance <b>and</b> <b>peered</b> <b>into</b> the sight.|$|E
60|$|Chauvelin's keen eyes {{tried to}} pierce the {{surrounding}} darkness. He {{leaned over the}} parapet <b>and</b> <b>peered</b> <b>into</b> the remote angles {{of the building and}} round the booths below him.|$|E
60|$|We went close <b>and</b> <b>peered</b> <b>into</b> the old trees. We {{could just}} see the dark bush of the {{mistletoe}} between the boughs of the tree. Lettie began to laugh.|$|E
60|$|Our island {{friends were}} now in high spirits; all courage and alacrity. Old Tonoi {{thought nothing of}} taking poor Taurus himself by the horns, <b>and</b> <b>peering</b> <b>into</b> his glazed eyes.|$|R
6000|$|She {{laughed at}} the recollection, and {{commenced}} to peep <b>and</b> <b>peer</b> <b>into</b> the luggage as if in search of some particular piece. Having satisfied herself, she was starting back, when she paused and said: ...|$|R

6000|$|... "And the man may {{be caught}} {{before we get}} back to Oak Hall," [...] said Roger. He crossed the room <b>and</b> <b>peered</b> <b>into</b> a closet. [...] "Has anybody seen my {{baseball}} shoes?" ...|$|E
60|$|A snore sounded {{from the}} pillows, {{punctuating}} the recital like {{a mark of}} exclamation. Ashe laid down the book <b>and</b> <b>peered</b> <b>into</b> the darkness beyond the rays of the bed lamp. His employer slept.|$|E
6000|$|He {{entered the}} depot {{much in the}} same manner, <b>and</b> <b>peered</b> <b>into</b> the car fully five minutes before venturing to take a seat, after which {{he said in a}} tone of {{satisfaction}} to his companions: ...|$|E
60|$|Up, up, on {{sounding}} wings flew a bird {{as white}} as snow from its lodging as Thumb drew near. And there he was, stooping, paddling, pushing with his cudgel, <b>and</b> <b>peering</b> <b>into</b> the tangle at the water-side.|$|R
60|$|He {{was still}} peeping <b>and</b> <b>peering</b> <b>into</b> the hut, when Thumb pinched his leg to bid him come down. So he slid {{cautiously}} down Thimble's {{back into the}} cold moonlight again, and told his brothers all he had seen.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, well, then!" [...] and [...] "Reuben!" [...] {{she called}} to the young man, who was prowling about the door-yard of a sad-colored old farm-house, <b>and</b> <b>peering</b> <b>into</b> a window here and there. [...] "Come here a moment--won't you, please?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "If only {{somebody}} {{loved me}}!" [...] he complained. [...] "If only somebody loved me I {{should be all}} right. I'm going to pieces." [...] He sat up <b>and</b> <b>peered</b> <b>into</b> {{the faces of the}} women.|$|E
60|$|In {{a moment}} I was upon {{my feet and}} he upon his. I seized him by the lapels of his coat <b>and</b> <b>peered</b> <b>into</b> his {{handsome}} face in the deepening darkness. I was breathless with excitement.|$|E
60|$|The three Adepts, Glinda and the Wizard sprang forward <b>and</b> <b>peered</b> <b>into</b> the drawer. It {{was half}} {{filled with a}} grayish powder, the tiny grains of which {{constantly}} moved as if impelled by some living force.|$|E
60|$|These turtles {{were only}} to be {{obtained}} by diving far down under the surface; and then swimming along horizontally, <b>and</b> <b>peering</b> <b>into</b> the coral honeycomb; snatching at a flipper when seen, as at a pinion {{in a range of}} billing dove-cotes.|$|R
6000|$|... "Hello!" [...] {{called a}} breathless, hearty voice, [...] "what the deuce y' been doing with my pardner? Bert, old fellow, are you there?" [...] Hartley asked, {{clinging}} {{to the edge of}} the moving cutter, <b>and</b> <b>peering</b> <b>into</b> his friend's face. Albert smiled.|$|R
60|$|He had grasped Edwards {{by the arm}} <b>and</b> was <b>peering</b> <b>into</b> his face.|$|R
6000|$|... 'That came of not {{steadying}} your wrist,' said Hal calmly. 'Don't bleed {{over the}} wood. Do your {{work with your}} heart's blood, but no need to let it show.' He rose <b>and</b> <b>peered</b> <b>into</b> {{a corner of the}} loft.|$|E
6000|$|She {{led the way}} to {{the bedside}} and laid her warm, plump hands on the pale, thin, cold, and rigid fingers of her friend. She stooped <b>and</b> <b>peered</b> <b>into</b> the sightless visage. [...] "Lucy, are you present? Can you see me?" ...|$|E
6000|$|She {{sat down}} on a box {{near the edge of the}} deck, <b>and</b> <b>peered</b> <b>into</b> the water and along the shore as if she had been sent there to watch for {{breakers}} ahead. Every now and then she screamed out: ...|$|E
6000|$|... '"All the congregation, {{to judge}} by their feet," [...] he says, <b>and</b> <b>peers</b> <b>into</b> the blackness. [...] "Still! Still, Hal! Hear 'em grunt! That's more o' my serpentines, I'll be bound. One--two--three--four they bear in! Faith, Andrew equips himself like an Admiral! Twenty-four serpentines in all!" ...|$|R
60|$|He {{pushed open}} the small lattice window <b>and</b> <b>peered</b> out <b>into</b> the alley.|$|R
60|$|I {{was sitting}} there one day when Aunt Winnifred and Grandmother Laurance came up the narrow dark staircase, the latter {{jingling}} her keys <b>and</b> <b>peering</b> <b>into</b> the dusty corners as she came along the room. When {{they came to the}} old chest, Grandmother rapped the top smartly with her keys.|$|R
