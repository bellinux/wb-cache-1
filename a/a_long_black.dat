5|$|Nuthatches are compact {{birds with}} short legs, {{compressed}} wings, and square 12-feathered tails. They have long, sturdy, pointed bills and strong toes with long claws. Nuthatches have blue-grey backs (violet-blue in some Asian species, which also have red or yellow bills) and white underparts, which are variably tinted with buff, orange, rufous or lilac. Although head markings vary between species, <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>black</b> eye stripe, with contrasting white supercilium, dark forehead and blackish cap is common. The sexes look similar, but may differ in underpart colouration, {{especially on the}} rear flanks and under the tail. Juveniles and first-year birds can be almost indistinguishable from adults.|$|E
5|$|Portrait of Maria Portinari {{is a small}} c. 1470–72 tempera and oil on wood {{painting}} by Hans Memling. It portrays Maria Maddalena Baroncelli, about whom very little is known. She is aged about 14 years old, and depicted shortly before her wedding to the Italian banker Tommaso Portinari. Maria is dressed in the height of late fifteenth-century fashion, with <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>black</b> hennin with a transparent veil and an elaborate jewel studded necklace. Her headdress is similar and necklace identical to those in her depiction in Hugo van der Goes's later Portinari Altarpiece (c. 1475), a painting {{that may have been}} partly based on Memling's portrait.|$|E
5|$|The {{setting for}} Maria-sama ga Miteru is , a fictional Catholic school founded in 1901 in Musashino, Tokyo, Japan; {{the school is}} {{depicted}} as an elegant, clean, pure, and very prestigious institution. Among the facilities of Lillian, aside from the classrooms, there is a church, a greenhouse, a kendo dojo, an auditorium, a park, and the Rose Mansion, where the Yamayuri Council meet. The students are very respectable and in good standing. The uniform at the school is <b>a</b> <b>long,</b> <b>black</b> Japanese school uniform with a white collar.|$|E

5|$|During her {{shows at}} the Tokyo Dome during 1996, Carey sported a long and wavy hairstyle, while wearing <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>black</b> gown. She sang the {{original}} version of the song, up until halfway through the last chorus, until merging into the C+C remix. Several background vocalists were once again featured on stage, all donning black garbs. However, once the remix began, six male dancers {{made their way to}} the right and left sides of the stage, performing heavy dance routines as Carey walked around the stage. Once the remix began, the lighting was altered. Aside from the usual fluorescent lighting that was used throughout the show, additional pink and purple lighting was added for the number, as it served for the shows closing and final song. During her succeeding shows in Europe, Carey's outfits altered as well as her hairstyle. She wore a long, white strapless gown and sported her hair in a straightened ponytail style. Since 1996, Carey has not performed the song live on television or on her tours.|$|E
5|$|It {{begins with}} a young girl playing in the {{backyard}} as snow falls on the ground. The scene shifts {{to that of a}} bedside, where a young woman who has died, lies. Her husband covers her with a white sheet as a priest prays. Madonna, wearing <b>a</b> <b>long,</b> <b>black</b> coat, sings the song underneath a snow-covered, dead tree, as the young girl plays with her dead mother's jewelry. The husband comes and shouts at the girl, tearing away the woman's pearl necklace which drop at the little girl's feet. The adult Madonna is shown lying beside another man singing the song as the little girl visits her mother's grave. The man gets up and slaps Madonna in the face, as the little girl cries in front of the grave. She is taken away from the graveyard by her father, as interspersed scenes show the girl being kissed by her mother, her trying to reach the knob of a door, and Madonna powdering the bruise mark on her face.|$|E
5|$|The okapi can {{be easily}} {{distinguished}} from its nearest extant relative, the giraffe. It is much smaller and shares more external similarities with the deer and bovids than with the giraffe. While both sexes possess horns in the giraffe, only males bear horns in the okapi. The okapi has large palatine sinuses, unique among the giraffids. Morphological similarities shared between the giraffe and the okapi include a similar gait – both use a pacing gait, stepping simultaneously with the front and the hind leg {{on the same side}} of the body, unlike other ungulates that walk by moving alternate legs on either side of the body - and <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>black</b> tongue (longer in the okapi) useful in plucking buds and leaves as well as for grooming.|$|E

5|$|While rain {{starts to}} fall, and {{people start to}} clear the streets, Carey remains walking on the pathway. The girl now reaches her destination, and is welcomed into the home of her lover. They soon board a bus, and travel to a new home where they will live together. As {{they are about to}} enter the bus, the girl's mother is seen {{screaming}} in tears for her daughter to return to her. She hesitates, and then continues with her lover onto the transport. The scene once again focuses on Carey, who is standing {{in the midst of a}} torrential downpour, singing to the heavens. As she reaches the song's climax, Carey, now dry and dressed in <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>black</b> gown, is shown singing at the altar of a church. As she sings at the church, scenes of the girl lighting a candle, and her lover laying together with her on a bed are shown, before focusing back on Carey. She stares at an elderly couple in the first row at the church, an inter-racial couple now revealed to be her parents, and smiles while wearing her mother's charmbracelet. The elderly woman begins crying, as her husband holds her hand as they intently stare at Carey. Their faces rejuvenate to show them as a young couple, as their photo is taken and placed into the family album from the beginning of the video.|$|E

25|$|The modern gown {{is derived}} from the roba worn under the cappa clausa, a garment {{resembling}} <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>black</b> cape.

25|$|Espresso-based coffee has {{a variety}} of {{possible}} presentations. In its most basic form, an espresso is served alone as a shot or short black, or with hot water added, when it is known as Caffè Americano. <b>A</b> <b>long</b> <b>black</b> is made by pouring a double espresso into an equal portion of water, retaining the crema, unlike Caffè Americano.|$|E

25|$|Hasidic men most {{commonly}} wear dark overclothes. On weekdays, they wear <b>a</b> <b>long,</b> <b>black,</b> cloth jacket called a rekel, and on Jewish Holy Days, the bekishe zaydene kapote (Yiddish, lit., satin caftan), a similarly long, black jacket, but of satin fabric traditionally silk. Indoors, the colorful tish bekishe is still worn. Some Hasidim wear a satin overcoat, known as rezhvolke. A rebbe's rezhvolke might be trimmed with velvet. Most do not wear neckties.|$|E
25|$|On 20 November 2006, at {{approximately}} 9:20 a.m. local time, Bosse {{drove to the}} Geschwister Scholl-Schule and strode into the schoolyard with his weapons, wearing <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>black</b> trench coat and a black gas mask. On the way, he started firing randomly and wounded the school janitor, who was seriously injured by {{a shot in the}} stomach. A female teacher who was following the janitor was also injured when Bosse threw a smoke bomb, which hit her in the face. Around ten minutes after the shooting started, police were informed of the incident.|$|E
25|$|The professorial Talar can be {{described}} as <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>black</b> gown with wide sleeves, often with lapels in faculty colour, while deans wear a Talar completely in faculty colour. Rectors typically have a distinguished, more elaborate Talar, e.g., made of velvet, coloured in red, or with gold embroidery. At some universities, the rector additionally wears a chain of office and, at some occasions, carries a scepter. The cap that accompanies the Talar is called Barett. As is the case with the Talar, which type of cap is used varies by university as well. Historically, caps made of soft materials rather than the square academic cap are common. The colour of the Barett matches the Talar.|$|E

500|$|The {{music video}} {{ends with a}} shot of Madonna {{watching}} herself recording the song. In this last scene she is dressed in <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>black</b> coat and holds a cigarette in her hand. Scholars noted that this last shot clearly illustrates the gender paradox of Madonna, because as she watches her female form singing the song, she herself is dressed in an androgynous way, holding a cigarette, which is associated {{as one of the}} symbolic forms of male supremacy. Feminist writer Martha Leslie Allen lauded the video, as well as Madonna, [...] "for breaking free of the conventional portrayal of women yet again, and displaying their duality." ...|$|E
500|$|On the 1990 Blond Ambition World Tour, Madonna {{performed}} [...] "Sooner or Later" [...] atop of a piano, as a chanteuse in a cabaret.

On his review of the concert, Richard Harrington from The Washington Post, opined Madonna [...] "acquitted herself quite well on 'Sooner or Later'". Two different performances were taped and released on video, the Blond Ambition Japan Tour 90, taped in Yokohama, Japan, on April 27, 1990, and the Blond Ambition World Tour Live, taped in Nice, France, on August 5, 1990.|$|E
