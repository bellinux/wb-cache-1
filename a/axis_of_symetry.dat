When the rod is stressed in uniform compression, the hole {{acts like a}} stress raiser to initiate two flat cleavage fractures which propagates in a stable way along the plane <b>of</b> <b>symetry</b> <b>of</b> the rod. Easy control of fracture starting or arrest is obtained by simple adjustment of the applied compressive stress. The tests have been performed on three current glasses in five media. Comparison with results given by literature shows on the whole a rather good correspondence...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Isomonodromic {{deformations}} of rank 2 logarithmic {{connections with}} singular points 0, 1, t and ∞ over the Riemann sphere are parametrized by the solutions q(t) of Painleve ́ VI equa-tion. Some discrete group <b>of</b> <b>symetries</b> <b>of</b> PV I equation naturally {{arise from the}} birational geometry of logarithmic connections. An extra symmetry was found by Okamoto in [15] by direct compu-tations. Here, we present a geometric interpretation of this sym-metry. After lifting conveniently the connection over the elliptic curve Et: {y 2 = x(x − 1) (x − t) }, the variation of the underly-ing vector bundle (along isomonodromic deformation) provides a new solution q̃(t) of PV I equation, namely the Okamoto symetric of q(t). In particular, isomonodromic deformations of the Lamé connection over Et arise as a particular case of our construction and we recover in a natural way recent results of S. Kawai and Levin-Olshanetsky. All proofs will appear in a forthcoming pape...|$|R

The eigenspace defined by the principal components of a number of range data sets describes the symetries in the data. Building structures offer a small number of main axes <b>of</b> <b>symetry</b> as caused by objects such as walls. As a consequence, the dimension of the eigenspace can be reduced to few axes which describe these symetries. By transforming a new data set in the low [...] dimensional eigenspace, every potential position at which the data where taken as well as the probability of this position can be derived from the sourrounding training data sets, of which the positions are known. The paper describes the principal component analysis of sets of range data and discusses its characteristics in indoor environments. It compares different methods to generate position hypothesis and discusses the question of noisy measurements and scene changes. Finally a [...] ...|$|R

40|$|Principal {{component}} (PC) maps, which plot {{the values}} of a given PC estimated {{on the basis of}} allele frequency variation at the geographic sampling locations of a set of populations, are often used to investigate the properties of past range expansions. Some studies have argued that in a range expansion, the <b>axis</b> <b>of</b> greatest variation (i. e., the first PC) is parallel to the <b>axis</b> <b>of</b> expansion. In contrast, others have identified a pattern in which the <b>axis</b> <b>of</b> greatest variation is perpendicular to the <b>axis</b> <b>of</b> expansion. Here, we seek to understand this difference in outcomes by investigating the effect of the geographic sampling scheme on the direction <b>of</b> the <b>axis</b> <b>of</b> greatest variation under a two-dimensional range expansion model. From datasets simulated using each of two different schemes for the geographic sampling of populations under the model, we create PC maps for the first PC. We find that depending on the geographic sampling scheme, the <b>axis</b> <b>of</b> greatest variation can be either parallel or perpendicular to the <b>axis</b> <b>of</b> expansion.
