This legislation retains for public sector accounting the logic of financial reporting that had been in effect for business enterprises, but also addresses the “specificities” of accounting for public sector entities. The advent of LOLF has raised a number of questions about how to make non-business entities “accountable. ” In this context, this paper analyzes the new French “accounting constitution” from a theoretical perspective that compares business enterprise and non-business accounting representations. The concept of non-business entity is used to explore further the nature and role of public sector activities within the economic system and their economic and monetary significance. Following this approach, three different views of accruals-based accounting for business enterprises are addressed: the wealth-basis (static), the cash-basis, and the flow-basis (dynamic). Whilst the wealth-basis refers to fair value and results to be at odds with the specificities of the public sector economics, a dynamic view of the <b>accruals</b> <b>basis</b> is developed and adapted to these specificities.

40|$|The {{adoption}} of <b>accrual</b> <b>basis</b> of accounting by governments {{is an important}} element to transform the bureaucratic administrative cash-based system to a more informative financial management system to ensure the supply of comprehensive, reliable, and meaningful financial information for appropriate accountability and decision making. Yemen is engaged in such reform, with advent of the E-Government, Information and Telecommunication Technologies era. This study describes the Yemen Central Government’s accounting and reporting system, its institutional framework, its policy characteristics and the environmental conditions that are in favour and unfavourable of such reform change. It also investigates the relationships between attitudes, innovative and organisational factors, {{as well as the}} {{adoption of}} <b>accrual</b> <b>basis</b> of accounting barriers and its implementation. Additionally, it investigates the moderating effects of E-Government between the abovementioned relationships during the face of change. This is to test if E-Government interaction will influence the strength and direction of the mentioned relationships in the model, and if the predictive power of that model would be increased. Finally, it examines the feasibility of <b>accrual</b> <b>basis</b> of accounting in Yemen. This study applied multiple theories, multi-method approaches (mixed-methods), and utilised qualitative and quantitative methodologies for data (analysis), collected from questionnaires and interview surveys. Twenty hypotheses are tested. The findings show that innovative and organisational factors have a positive relationship with an attitude toward change, while barriers have a negative relationship with an attitude toward change, but E-Government has a positive relationship with an attitude toward change. The results show that institutional frameworks such as the current Yemen governmental accounting and reporting framework, have an acceptable level of moving towards <b>accrual</b> <b>basis</b> of accounting, while accounting system objectives and reporting policy specifications reveal acceptable level of objectives and insufficient level of reporting policy. Even though the Yemen government officially announced the adoption of <b>accrual</b> <b>basis</b> of accounting and performed several alterations on the accounting system toward <b>accrual</b> <b>basis,</b> central government accounting officials are still using (modified) cash basis accounting. Computer integration, across governmental departments, is not complete. Environmental factors that contributed to change from cash <b>basis</b> to <b>accrual</b> <b>basis</b> of accounting are reform stimuli, pressures related to other reforms, and forces of globalisation. The contextual variables are in favour of moving toward <b>accrual</b> <b>basis</b> of accounting. Attitudes toward change were found to have a full mediation effect between innovation factors, organisational factors, barriers, and E-Government, emphasising the important role of accountants, financial managers, and others in the feasible adoption and implementation of <b>accrual</b> <b>basis</b> of accounting. E-Government shows a moderating effect on the relationships between all independent variables and the mediating variable of attitude toward change. This study found Government officials' attitude toward change from cash <b>basis</b> accounting to <b>accrual</b> <b>basis</b> of accounting to be very critical for the adoption and implementation of such change. Government financial officials have to be in line with the change process and their support is crucial for a successful adoption.

40|$|The {{patterns}} {{of change in}} the financial reporting practices of the early railway companies, and their causes, are important aspects of the evolution of accounting practice more generally. They have accordingly been widely discussed in the literature, although the views expressed have rarely been supported by reference to any very substantial or systematically derived bodies of empirical evidence. One of the most interesting and important suggestions in this literature is the claim that the early UK railway companies voluntarily made both quantitative and qualitative changes to their published accounting statements, in response to a crisis in shareholder confidence {{in the second half of}} the 1840 s, consequent upon the collapse of the railway mania of 1845 - 47. The quantitative response involved the disclosure of far more information and the qualitative led to changes in the conceptual basis of reporting, from a cash to an <b>accruals</b> <b>basis,</b> changes that met with the satisfaction of the shareholders concerned and were important parts of the gradual evolution of financial reporting. The paper undertakes a systematic analysis of the financial accounting practices of the major early railway companies from 1840 until 1855. The mapping of the variety of such practices, and their changes over time, enable a re-examination of these important claims concerning the nature of the financial reporting response to one of its earliest crises. ...|$|E
40|$|A {{conceptual}} framework of {{accounting for the}} economics of non-business entities is developed and applied to the new French "accounting constitution" of governmental accounting. The concept of non-business entity is used to investigate the nature and role of non lucrative organizations within the economic system and their specific economic and monetary process. This theoretical perspective compares business and non-business accounting representations. Accordingly, concerning business entities, three different accounting models of accruals are addressed: the wealth-basis (static), the cash-basis, and the flow-basis (dynamic). Whilst the wealth-basis refers to current (fair) values and results to {{be at odds with}} the specificities of the non-business economics, a dynamic accounting model of the <b>accruals</b> <b>basis</b> is retained and adapted to these specificities. This dynamic accounting model is then applied to a conceptual assessment of the new French accounting standards set.

This legislation retains for governmental accounting the logic of financial reporting that had been in effect for business enterprises, but also addresses the "specificities" of accounting for public sector entities. According to our analysis, the concepts of "produit" (revenue) and "actif" (asset), and some specific standards create an ambiguity between the static and the dynamic model. Our conceptual framework may be applied further to the analysis of other accounting standards sets such as the International Public Sector Accounting Standards (IPSAS) ...|$|E
