5|$|The new wing has six dormers (three on a side), and six dormers {{were added}} to the old house in the 1913 {{renovation}} (four on the east side, two on the west). The windows {{on the first floor of}} the new wing matched the old windows, but the windows in the second story of the addition have twelve panes in the upper sash and eight in the lower. As part of the renovation work, four new windows were placed in the 1850s house: two just west of the new wing, and two on the east wall of the lower part of the L. A small porch was added in the corner where the west wall of the new wing meets the north wall of the old house, and <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>old</b> porches were restored. In the original house two chimneys were restored and two replaced, and new fireplaces were installed in the living room, library, and dining room. The house has a total of 28 rooms.|$|E
5|$|In 2003, {{the section}} of the Kolsås Line in Bærum closed due to {{disagreements}} between the two counties of Oslo and Akershus on how much Akershus should pay to purchase services from Oslo Sporveier. After a year of replacement buses, the line was reopened, only to be closed again in 2006 for an upgrade to metro standard. Disagreements between the two counties means the upgrade will be done separately on {{the two sides of the}} municipal boundary, with the Oslo side opening first. By 2010, the upgraded part had reached Bjørnsletta station in Oslo. In 2003, the Ring Line opened from Ullevål Stadion station on the Sognsvann Line to Storo station. The line will create a loop, which will connect to neighbourhoods such as Nydalen and Bjerke north of the city centre. In July 2004, construction caused a tunnel to collapse on the Grorud Line—the system's busiest—forcing a shutdown of this line until December and creating havoc on the overloaded replacement buses. The ring was completed onwards to Carl Berners plass on the Grorud Line via Sinsen in 2006. In 2007, the system started taking delivery of the new MX3000 trains, which replaced <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>old</b> stock. By 2010, all T1000, T1300 and T2000 trains had been retired. In 2010, the Holmenkollen Line reopened with metro standard, after it had been closed for renovation for a year.|$|E

5|$|The Girls He Left Behind Him and The Iron Clad Lover are two 1910 American silent short comedies {{produced}} by the Thanhouser Company. Both films were originally released together on a single reel and are two distinct and separate subjects. The Girls He Left Behind Him focuses on a young man, Jack Redfern, who receives a letter from an old sweetheart of his. This prompts him to reminiscence about all the girls he has had affections for {{on the eve of}} his wedding. <b>All</b> <b>the</b> <b>old</b> sweethearts of his life then appear at his wedding to wish him well. The Iron Clad Lover concerns two suitors who are vying for the affections of Bessie. Tom, who plays a game of chess with her father, ends up quarreling with him and he is thrown out of the house. The next day, Tom attempts to bring flowers and candy for Bessie's birthday, but is dismissed by the angry father. Tom decides to dress up in a suit of armor and ends up breaking a vase when trying to announce himself. The suit of armor is thrown out and Bessie and the other suitor chase down the junk dealer to free Tom from the suit of armor. Both films were released on December 9, 1910 and were met with positive reviews by The Moving Picture World and The New York Dramatic Mirror. Both films are presumed lost.|$|E

25|$|The Soviet Union {{was mostly}} {{isolated}} from the world trading system during the 1930s. To force peasants into industrial jobs in the cities, food was stripped from rural areas, and millions died of starvation.

25|$|The Soviet Union under Vladimir Lenin decriminalized {{homosexuality}} in 1922, {{long before}} many other European countries. The Soviet Communist Party effectively legalized no-fault divorce, abortion and homosexuality, when they abolished <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>old</b> Tsarist {{laws and the}} initial Soviet criminal code kept these liberal sexual policies in place. Lenin's emancipation was reversed a decade later by Joseph Stalin and homosexuality remained illegal under Article 121 until the Yeltsin era.|$|E

Some modern text adventure games can even be played on very old computer systems. Text adventure games are also suitable for personal digital assistants, because they have very small computer system requirements. Other text adventure games are fully playable via web browsers.|$|E
25|$|The {{municipal}} council voted in 1960 to close all the street trams in Oslo. The Oslo Metro was being built and trams {{were seen as}} unmodern compared to diesel buses. The tramway had the nearly new SM53 trams in operation and therefore it was found economical to keep many of the lines running until the rolling stock was obsolete. However, <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>old</b> twin-axled trams were to be retired. The Sagene Line {{was one of several}} that was closed as part of this process. The closing took place on 17 October 1966, the same day as the metro's Grorud Line opened. However, the segment from Sagene to Torshov was kept.|$|E

25|$|In 1796 all Dominicans monasteries in the Southern Netherlands {{were closed}} {{down on the}} order of the French occupiers. At this time <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>old</b> church records, {{containing}} information about the Dominican Order, the church and the convent, were lost. The church was sold publicly and bought by Dominican Prior Peltiers. He was thus able to save the rich contents of the church. In 1802 the church, the Calvary and part of the monastery were taken over by the city council. The church was consecrated the following year as a parish church, replacing the old, dilapidated St. Walburga Church, which was demolished in 1817.|$|E
25|$|The novel {{begins in}} July 1805 in Saint Petersburg, at a soirée given by Anna Pavlovna Scherer—the maid of honour and confidante to the dowager Empress Maria Feodorovna. Many {{of the main}} {{characters}} are introduced {{as they enter the}} salon. Pierre (Pyotr Kirilovich) Bezukhov is the illegitimate son of a wealthy count, who is dying after a series of strokes. Pierre is about to become embroiled in a struggle for his inheritance. Educated abroad at his father's expense following his mother's death, Pierre is kindhearted but socially awkward, and finds it difficult to integrate into Petersburg society. It is known to everyone at the soirée that Pierre is his father's favorite of <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>old</b> count’s illegitimate progeny.|$|E
25|$|The first {{settlers}} {{came to the}} Salt Springs area in the 1790s, {{and found}} an area of unbroken forest that was dominated by the eastern hemlock tree. The settlers focused on clearing the land for farming. Many of the trees were simply burned, while others were used to build log cabins. Eventually the settlers began stripping the hemlocks of their bark for use in tanneries, while other trees were harvested for the lumber industry. Sawmills soon appeared on Silver Creek and other streams in the area. However, not <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>old</b> hemlocks were harvested. Those still standing in and about Fall Brook Gorge were left because the area had become a recreation destination {{as soon as the}} early 19th century.|$|E

25|$|In 1977, the {{building}} was leased to the Lebanese University, by a decision from the council of ministers, to become {{the seat of the}} rector and the university administration (until 1998). In that year, a new building was built near the Ministry of National Defense in Yarzeh, however, the limited size of {{the building}} did not permit the storage of <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>old</b> equipment, military uniforms and others. Some of the content remained stored at the Museum of Fayadieh military school, and the rest in the fortress of Rashaya in the region of West Beqaa, while being connected to the main military museum in the Ministry of National Defense. Finally, the military museum was annexed to the directorate of orientation and regarded as one of its departments.|$|E
25|$|The {{expeditions to}} inland Brazil {{are divided into}} two types: the entradas and the bandeiras. The entradas were done {{in the name of}} the Portuguese crown and were financed by the colonial government. Its main {{objective}} was to find mineral riches, as well as to explore and chart unknown territory. The bandeiras, on the other hand, were private initiatives sponsored and carried out mostly by settlers of the São Paulo region (the Paulistas). The expeditions of the bandeirantes, as these adventurers were called, were aimed at obtaining native slaves for trade and finding mineral riches. The Paulistas, who at the time were mostly of mixed Portuguese and native ancestry, knew <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>old</b> indigenous pathways (the peabirus) through the Brazilian inland and were acclimated to the harsh conditions of these journeys.|$|E
25|$|When the Basinghall Mining Syndicate {{took over}} the mine in 1936 <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>old</b> {{equipment}} in the mill was removed and a completely new electrically-powered plant was designed for high production rates. The entire output of the mine was crushed in a ball mill {{to the size of}} fine sand before being passed into a bank of froth flotation cells. In these, organic oils and acids caused the galena particles to become attached to rising air bubbles to form a grey foam which overflowed a weir at the top. These gave a good separation: concentrates averaged 75% galena and the waste tailings only 0.2% galena. The concentrate was dried, conveyed to ore-bins and then hand-loaded onto lorries for carriage to smelting mills at Ryton near Newcastle upon Tyne. However the ball mill was unable to cope with the high volumes of ore in the early 1940s. New concentrating tables were introduced. By the 1950s these processed 60% of the ore and produced concentrates of 82% galena. The remaining 40% of ore went to the ball mill and froth flotation plant.|$|E

25|$|Verbs and pronouns {{had three}} numbers: singular, dual, and plural. Although the pronominal dual survived into <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>oldest</b> languages, <b>the</b> verbal dual survived only into Gothic, and the (presumed) nominal and {{adjectival}} dual forms were lost before <b>the</b> <b>oldest</b> records. As in the Italic languages, {{it may have}} been lost before Proto-Germanic became a different branch at all.|$|R
