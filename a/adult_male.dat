5|$|The common {{blackbird}} of the nominate subspecies T. m. merula is 23.5 to 29centimetres (9.25 to 11.4in) in length, {{has a long}} tail, {{and weighs}} 80–125grams (2.8 to 4.4oz). The <b>adult</b> <b>male</b> has glossy black plumage, blackish-brown legs, a yellow eye-ring and an orange-yellow bill. The bill darkens somewhat in winter. The adult female is sooty-brown with a dull yellowish-brownish bill, a brownish-white throat and some weak mottling on the breast. The juvenile {{is similar to the}} female, but has pale spots on the upperparts, and the very young juvenile also has a speckled breast. Young birds vary in the shade of brown, with darker birds presumably males. The first year male resembles the <b>adult</b> <b>male,</b> but has a dark bill and weaker eye ring, and its folded wing is brown, rather than black like the body plumage.|$|E
5|$|The plumage is {{generally}} light gray-brown and lighter and pinkish below. The wings have black spotting, {{and the outer}} tail feathers are white, contrasting with the black inners. Below the eye is a distinctive crescent-shaped area of dark feathers. The eyes are dark, with light skin surrounding them. The <b>adult</b> <b>male</b> has bright purple-pink patches on the neck sides, with light pink coloring reaching the breast. The crown of the <b>adult</b> <b>male</b> is a distinctly bluish-grey color. Females are similar in appearance, but with more brown coloring overall and a little smaller than the male. The iridescent feather patches on the neck above the shoulders are nearly absent, but can be quite vivid on males. Juvenile birds have a scaly appearance, and are generally darker.|$|E

Neotenous features in adult females may help elicit more resource investment and nurturing from <b>adult</b> <b>males.</b> Likewise, neotenous features in <b>adult</b> <b>males</b> may similarly help elicit more resource investment and nurturing from adult females in addition to possibly making neotenous <b>adult</b> <b>males</b> appear less threatening and possibly making neotenous <b>adult</b> <b>males</b> more able to elicit resources from [...] "other resource-rich people".

5|$|Zebra {{sharks are}} usually solitary, though aggregations of 2050 {{individuals}} have been recorded. Off southeast Queensland, aggregations {{of several hundred}} zebra sharks form every summer in shallow water. These aggregations consist entirely of large adults, with females outnumbering males by almost three to one. The purpose of these aggregations is yet unclear; no definite mating behavior has been observed between the sharks. There is an observation of an <b>adult</b> <b>male</b> zebra shark biting the pectoral fin of another <b>adult</b> <b>male</b> and pushing him against the sea floor; the second male was turned on his back, and remained motionless for several minutes. This behavior resembles pre-copulatory behaviors {{between male and female}} sharks, and in both cases the biting and holding of the pectoral fin has been speculated to relate to one shark asserting dominance over the other.|$|E
5|$|Both {{resident}} and transient orangutans aggregate on large fruiting trees to feed. The fruits {{tend to be}} abundant, so competition is low and individuals may engage in social interactions. Orangutans will also form travelling groups with members moving between different food sources. These groups tend {{to be made of}} only a few individuals. They also tend to be consortships between an <b>adult</b> <b>male</b> and female.|$|E
5|$|Brunette Coleman was a {{pseudonym}} {{used by the}} poet and writer Philip Larkin. In 1943, {{towards the end of}} his time as an undergraduate at St John's College, Oxford, he wrote several works of fiction, verse and critical commentary under that name. The style he adopted parodies that of popular writers of contemporary girls' school fiction, but the extent of the stories' homoerotic content suggests they were written primarily for <b>adult</b> <b>male</b> titillation.|$|E

50|$|Home {{ranges of}} 7,060 to 9,630 square feet (656-895 sq m) have been {{reported}} for Great Basin pocket mice in British Columbia. Males may have larger home ranges than females. Average home ranges reported from south-central Washington are 23,030 square feet (2,140 sq m) and 33,640 square feet (3,125 sq m) for <b>adult</b> <b>males</b> and 15,564 square feet (1,446 sq m) for adult females. In big sagebrush habitat on the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge, Oregon, home ranges of <b>adult</b> <b>males</b> were significantly greater (p < 0.001) than home ranges of females. Reproductively active <b>adult</b> <b>males</b> had significantly (p < 0.05) larger home ranges than <b>adult</b> <b>males</b> with unenlarged testes. In black greasewood (Sarcobatus vermiculatus) habitat, however, {{there were no significant}} differences between male and female home ranges or between home ranges of reproductive and nonreproductive <b>adult</b> <b>males.</b>|$|R
50|$|By {{manipulating}} demographics so juveniles {{only had}} access to females, juvenile males developed atypical social behavior; they did not engage in the typical social singing bouts with other males, did not pair bond with females, and were promiscuous. This demonstrates that there is great flexibility {{in the behavior of}} cowbirds, and that the social environment is extremely important in structuring their behavior. <b>Adult</b> <b>males</b> housed with juvenile males were shown to have greater reproductive success compared to <b>adult</b> <b>males</b> housed with other <b>adult</b> <b>males.</b> Being housed with juvenile males honed the reproductive skills of the <b>adult</b> <b>males</b> by providing them with a more complex social environment.|$|R

5|$|Some {{species of}} rodent are monogamous, with an <b>adult</b> <b>male</b> and female forming a lasting pair bond. Monogamy {{can come in}} two forms; obligate and facultative. In obligate monogamy, both parents care for the {{offspring}} and play {{an important part in}} their survival. This occurs in species such as California mice, oldfield mice, Malagasy giant rats and beavers. In these species, males usually mate only with their partners. In addition to increased care for young, obligate monogamy can also be beneficial to the <b>adult</b> <b>male</b> as it decreases the chances of never finding a mate or mating with an infertile female. In facultative monogamy, the males do not provide direct parental care and stay with one female because they cannot access others due to being spatially dispersed. Prairie voles appear to be an example of this form of monogamy, with males guarding and defending females within their vicinity.|$|E

Fifty four specimen of M. multifasciata consisted of 19 <b>adult</b> <b>males,</b> 23 <b>adult</b> females, and 12 subadult were collected from Indonesian Botanical Garden in Bali and ther were measured for their morphology. The result on univariant, correlation and multiple regression statistical analyses on morphology of variant snout to vent length (SVL), mount length (ML), mount wide (MW), humerus length (HL), radius length (RL), femur length (FL), and tibia length (TL) on <b>adult</b> <b>males,</b> <b>adult</b> females and subadult of M. multifasciata revealed that there were no sexual dimorphism between <b>adult</b> <b>males</b> and <b>adult</b> females; strong correlation among the varians, and regression square of all the variants to SVL on <b>adult</b> <b>males,</b> <b>adult</b> females, and subadult up to 0. 96. the intraspecific food niche differences between <b>adult</b> <b>males</b> and dult females had no effect on the sexual dimorphism. ...|$|R

5|$|The modern {{dromedary}} probably {{evolved in}} the hotter, arid regions of western Asia from the Bactrian camel, which in turn was {{closely related to the}} earliest Old World camels.

Second-year birds lag behind full adults in developing breeding plumage. They have a lower body mass and a slower weight increase than full adults, and perhaps the demands made on their energy reserves during the migration flight are the main reason of the delayed moult.|$|E
5|$|Vietnamization was {{catching}} up with the conflict in Laos. During the 1970–1971 dry season, U.S. Air Force strike missions in support of Hmong operations had dropped by 70 percent {{from the previous year}} from 114 sorties per day to 38. The grinding nature of the conflict was also having a cumulative effect on the <b>adult</b> <b>male</b> population of the Hmong.
