50|$|Equalization {{payments}} is {{the most}} commonly known system for the redistribution of revenue in Germany and is an important tool for the financing of regional development. Levels of awareness are raised thanks to public disagreements between the states; legal actions over the <b>allocation</b> <b>of</b> <b>payments</b> have been taken by various states in the Federal Constitutional Court on many occasions including 1952, 1986, 1992, 1999 and 2006. A legal action by the states of Bavaria and Baden Würtemberg is pending in 2016. For many years the equalization payments have accounted for 2% to 3% of state income; in 2015 equalization payments amounted to €9.6bn compared {{to state and local}} tax revenues of €306bn. The aim, as laid out in the German constitution, is to balance the differing financial strengths of the federal states. In this way all states are in the position to be able to comply with the responsibilities assigned to them by the constitution. Through this process the funding requirements of the federation and states are coordinated with the aim of agreeing equalization payments, this ensures that tax payers are not overburdened and maintains consistency in the standard of living across Germany.|$|E

The paper at hand studies the optimal ordering and payment policies of a buyer assuming that the supplier offers a progressive interest scheme. The contribution to the literature is twofold. First, the different financial conditions of the companies involved are taken into account by assuming that the credit interest rate of the buyer may, but not necessarily has to, exceed the interest rate charged by the supplier. In addition, the time-value of money is considered in this scenario which is relevant when trade credit terms are valid for a long period of time and payment flows need to be evaluated by their net present value to ensure long-term profitability. The models proposed enable decision makers to improve ordering and payment decisions and the results reveal that taking into account the temporal <b>allocation</b> <b>of</b> <b>payments,</b> the prevailing interest relation influences replenishment policies significantly...|$|E

40|$|In {{the present}} work, {{agreement}} on <b>allocation</b> <b>of</b> <b>payments</b> from multiple issues requires unanimous consent {{of all parties}} involved. The agents are assumed to know the aggregate payoffs but do not know their decomposition by issues. This framework applies to many real-world problems, such as the formation of joint ventures. We present a novel solution concept to the problem, termed the multi-core, wherein an agent consents {{to participate in the}} grand coalition if she can envision a decomposition of the proposed allocation for which each coalition to which she belongs derives greater benefit on each issue by cooperating with the grand coalition rather than operating alone. An allocation is in the multi-core if all agents consent to participate in the grand coalition. We provide a theorem characterizing the non-emptiness of the multi-core and show that the multi-core generalizes the core. We prove that the approach of the multi-core has the potential to increase cooperation among parties beyond that of solving issues independently. In addition, we establish that the multi-core wherein agents take into account the specifics of the original issues is a refinement of the core of the sum of individual issues in which such information is ignored...|$|E
40|$|Objective: The goal of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} whether lower premium payments for individuals with non-preventable diseases would be a viable option in the development of new health insurance models. This change would coincide with an increase in financial liability for those individuals with preventable illnesses. Theoretically, the proposed change would result in greater profits for providers and a more just <b>allocation</b> <b>of</b> <b>payments.</b> Method: A brief survey was randomly distributed by phone calls and letters to individuals living in the Minneapolis West Metro area. The eighteen responses received were subsequently analyzed using Fisher and Chi-Square methods as well as basic statistical functions. Results: While particular demographics tended to respond in similar ways, in no case were said responses statistically significant. There was no significant correlation for example, between the gender of participants and their responses to a potential change in insurance formulas to either aid those with non-preventable illnesses or increase costs for those with preventable health concerns. Additionally, responses were insignificant in relation to characteristics of participants such as smoking status and responses to other questions. Conclusion: Although the potential for increased efficiency exists in the proposed change to health insurance formulas, public opinion could cause such a change to be detrimental to providers who choose to enact it.

Other states passed legislation to ensure that payments are used to supplement existing state funds, enacted laws governing the future use of the payments, established voter approved initiatives to decide how to allocate the payments, and created special commissions to develop recommendations and long-term plans for the payments.

40|$|Ecological {{compensation}} {{is a hot}} subject in academic studies, and the determination <b>of</b> the spatial <b>allocation</b> <b>of</b> compensation <b>payments</b> is a key point in the research of ecological compensation. There {{are two kinds of}} thoughts in the determination <b>of</b> regional spatial <b>allocation</b> at present: "evaluation of ecological construction cost" and "evaluation of ecosystem services value". This paper analyzes the relationships between social ecological compensation and regional socio-economic development, and establishes two econometric models with the data of 2007 from various provinces in China. Through these models, the impacts of geographical endowments on the regional socio-economic development in various provinces are analyzed from the social justice viewpoint and the concept of "equivalent value of geographical endowments" (EGE for short) is proposed. This paper analyzes the application prospect of EGE in the policy making of regional ecological compensation. The results showed that: (1) the implementation of social ecological {{compensation is}} not only an effective guarantee for each region to obtain the equal rights of survival, development and decent environment, but also an essential assurance to the coordinated, balanced and sustainable development among various regions; (2) the regional difference in geographical endowments is an important factor affecting the regional spatial variation of socio-economic development. Therefore, geographical endowments are important bases for the determination <b>of</b> the spatial <b>allocation</b> <b>of</b> compensation <b>payments</b> in social ecological compensation; (3) based on the EGE, the government can determine the spatial <b>allocation</b> <b>of</b> social ecological compensation scientifically, and avoid the "sweeping approach" phenomenon in the policy making process of ecological compensation...|$|R

50|$|There {{are a few}} crucial points {{worth noting}} when {{mortgaging}} a home with an amortized loan. First, there is substantial disparate <b>allocation</b> <b>of</b> the monthly <b>payments</b> toward the interest, especially during the first 18 years of a 30-year mortgage. In the example below, payment 1 allocates about 80-90% <b>of</b> the total <b>payment</b> towards interest and only $67.09 (or 10-20%) toward the principal balance.

40|$|The {{engagement}} of JRC IPTS in the GTAP contributing {{team to the}} EU domestic support has opened up the opportunity to use the CATS database when compiling EU domestic support payments by member state, which are subsequently calibrated into the GTAP database. To maintain consistency, the GTAP version 9 includes EU domestic support which follows the approach adopted in the previous releases (Jensen, 2009, 2010). The difference is for pillar 1 support for which the CATS data are used (in previous GTAP database releases, pillar 1 support was based on EAGF financial reports). All together EU domestic support amounts to 66, 530 million euros in 2011 (i. e. pillar 1 expenditures from CATS, pillar 2 and national expenditures from Producer Support Estimate (PSE) by OECD). In addition, minor improvements to the <b>allocation</b> <b>of</b> <b>payments</b> have been proposed for the version 9 release. On the other hand previous research at JRC IPTS (Boulanger and Philippidis, 2014, 2015) showed that when comparing with the CATS database, the GTAP database was incomplete, particularly in its representation of CAP rural development payments, or so called pillar 2 payments. This paper compares the EU domestic support approach adopted in the GTAP database version 9 with an alternative one {{in order to make}} the representation of CAP expenditures more transparent and comprehensive. Such an alternative allocation includes more payments than the traditional method employed (e. g. the proposed classification includes support currently defined as General Services Support Estimate (GSSE) by the OECD). Finally, introducing this new accounting convention for the EU domestic support in the GTAP database would lead to data discrepancies with other non-EU countries and/or regions, jeopardising robust comparative analysi...|$|E
40|$|Informal {{payments}} for health services {{are common in}} many transitional and developing countries. The aim {{of this paper is}} to investigate the nature of informal payments in the health sector of Tanzania and to identify mechanisms through which informal payments may affect the quality of health care. Our focus is on the effect of informal payments on health worker behaviours, in particular the interpersonal dynamics among health workers at their workplaces. We organised eight focus groups with 58 health workers representing different cadres and levels of care in one rural and one urban district in Tanzania. We found that health workers at all levels receive informal payments in a number of different contexts. Health workers sometimes share the payments received, but only partially, and more rarely within the cadre than across cadres. Our findings indicate that health workers are involved in 'rent-seeking' activities, such as creating artificial shortages and deliberately lowering the quality of service, in order to extract extra payments from patients or to bargain for a higher share of the payments received by their colleagues. The discussions revealed that many health workers think that the distribution of informal payments is grossly unfair. The findings suggest that informal payments can impact negatively on the quality of health care through rent-seeking behaviours and through frustrations created by the unfair <b>allocation</b> <b>of</b> <b>payments.</b> Interestingly, the presence of corruption may also induce non-corrupt workers to reduce the quality of care. Positive impacts can occur because informal payments may induce health workers to increase their efforts, and maybe more so if there is competition among health workers about receiving the payments. Moreover, informal payments add to health workers' incomes and might thus contribute to retention of health workers within the health sector.

40|$|Objective: To {{examine the}} organizational, political, and {{community}} characteristics that facilitate or impede community progress {{in developing a}} coordinative network of health services for trauma delivery. Study Setting/Design: A comparative case study design {{was used to examine}} trauma network development in 6 U. S. cities with a population of 1 [punctuation space] 000 [punctuation space] 000 or more. Five key coordinative activities were selected for study. Each study site varied in the set of activities that had been implemented. Data Sources: Information on the structure and composition of local trauma coordinating councils; interviews with a common set of informants in each site using a semi-structured interview protocol. Study Methods: The literature on interorganizational community structures and local policy development was drawn upon to create a conceptual framework for assessing the development of a coordinative service network. Analytical techniques included network analysis to understand the linkages across organizations in overseeing trauma network operations, assessment of leadership structures to identify central actors and organizations, and pattern matching techniques of case study analysis to identify factors that affected trauma network development. Principal Findings: Leaders capitalized on local events and were instrumental in keeping network development {{on the top of the}} political agenda. Successful leaders spent substantial time and energy documenting problems, assessing the needs and understanding of stakeholders, educating stakeholders and politicians, and creating trust and shared understanding of values. Conclusions: Prior research has documented the importance of central actors and organizations in developing coordinative networks. The unique contribution of our research is its insights on how central actors and organizations are more likely to motivate collaboration in situations where they lack control over the <b>allocation</b> <b>of</b> <b>payments</b> across involved organizations. Our research suggests that under these circumstances central players should focus their time and energy educating stakeholders and developing a shared understanding rather than using their centrality to impose a particular coordinative structure.

40|$|The {{problem of}} power system {{stabilizer}} (PSS) parameter tuning {{is a complex}} exercise {{because of the presence}} of poorly damped modes of oscillation, and continuous variation in power system operating conditions. In recent years, as a result of the newly deregulated market environment, power systems tend to be operated at reduced security margins, thus making the system more vulnerable to disturbances. The role of PSS, among other power system control devices, becomes then even more critical, and subsequently, in light of the new operating paradigm, new methods of financial compensation for the generators providing this service to system would be needed. The work presented in this thesis focuses on aspects related to PSSs tuning, on one hand, and evaluation of their contribution to system stability and security from an economic perspective in the context of ancillary services, on the other. Thus, a genetic algorithm (GA) based method to simultaneously tune PSSs is developed in the first part of this thesis, while the second is dedicated to developing a game theory based method to financially compensate the PSSs for the control effort they provide for the power system. The simultaneous approach for tuning PSSs, as opposed to sequential approaches, usually involves exhaustive computational efforts, but, in turn, ensures the parameter setting optimality. The classical Lyapunov's parameter optimization method employing an Integral of Squared Error (ISE) criterion has been integrated within a GA framework to simultaneously tune PSSs. Within the genetic process, a potential solution  the PSS parameter setting  is coded as an individual, which is part of a population of such potential solutions randomly generated, and by applying the survival of the fitness principle based on each individual's fitness with respect to the objective, a sound basis to finding the best individual, i. e. global optimum solution, is created. The method thus emerged has been used for tuning of lead-lag and derivative PSS. A similar GA based optimization process is implemented for tuning the proportional-integral-derivative (PID) PSS. Since the PID PSS acts in discrete mode, the power system model has been accordingly developed in discrete-time domain. An optimal sampling period has been determined considering the conflicting requirements of computation time vis-à-vis accuracy of information on system dynamics due to discretization. Tests for transient events, such as three-phase short circuits and transmission line outages, have also been performed with satisfactory results. In the second part of this thesis, an attempt has been made to examine the role and performance of PSS in the context of deregulated power markets. It is proposed that the PSS control effort to enhance power system stability and security be regarded as an ancillary service  PSS-control service  and subsequently, the allocation of system savings/benefit, as accrued from a PSS, becomes an important issue. A game theory based approach, namely the Shapley value criterion, is used to develop a scheme for <b>allocation</b> <b>of</b> <b>payments</b> to generators equipped with PSS and providing this service. The PSSs contribution is evaluated in different ways: by assessing the transfer capability of the system due to PSS, or by employing various performance indices based on system dynamic behavior. A contingency analysis is also performed and the N- 1 security criterion is taken into consideration as well, for evaluating the PSS-control payment...|$|E

The Council of Jews from Germany (Council for the Protection of the Rights and Interests of Jews from Germany) is the umbrella organization of organizations built up by Jews from Germany and other Central European countries in their countries of resettlement after fleeing Nazi Germany. It represents the interests of former German Jews in matters of restitution and indemnification, legislation, contacts with successor organizations for heirless Jewish property in West Germany, and social work activities. Founded in 1945 in London, the first member organizations were Israel's Irgun Olei Merkaz Europa (IOME), the American Federation of Jews from Central Europe, and the Association of Jewish Refugees in Great Britain. It also has affiliates in other countries. In the immediate post-war period, the Council's activities centered on restitution advocacy for Jews who had lived in Germany before World War II. The area of German restitution payments was complex, with claims also put forth by Jews living in Germany after the war (so-called successor communities), by worldwide Jewish organizations such as the Joint Distribution Committee (JDC) and the World Jewish Committee (WJC), and by the state of Israel. In this mix of competing claims, which was made more complicated by reluctance of the western powers to press for restitution as well as by German reluctance, the Council forcefully asserted the "moral claims" of Jews who had lived in Germany before the war. Many of these issues were resolved by the mid- 1950 s. The Luxembourg Agreements of 1952, between West Germany, Israel, and the Claims Conference, created a framework for future restitution and indemnification claims. The American Court of Restitutions Appeals (CORA), in its 1954 Augsburg decision, determined that the Jewish Restitution Successor Organization (JRSO), rather than successor communities in Germany, was the proper legal successor for German-Jewish heirless communal property. However, disagreements remained, with the Council briefly withdrawing from the JRSO in 1954 after a failure to agree about the <b>allocation</b> <b>of</b> <b>payments.</b> The Council of Jews from Germany was central to many post-war Jewish organizations. It was instrumental in the founding of the United Restitution Organization (URO) in 1945, and was also intimately involved in Jewish Restitution Successor Organization (JRSO), which was set up in 1946 in the United States zone of western Germany. The Council was also a founding member of the Conference on Jewish Material Claims against Germany (1951), and helped create the Leo Baeck Institute (1955). The first president of the Council was Leo Baeck, who was succeeded by Siegfried Moses in 1957. After the death of Siegfried Moses in 1974, three joint chairmen were elected. The Council's secretaries were Kurt Alexander (1945 - 1949), Hans Reichmann (1949 - 1955), Ernst Berent (1955 - 1961), Bruno Woyda (1961 - 1967), and Werner Rosenstock. Other active officers in the early years were Walter Breslauer, Rudolf Callmann, and Rabbi Max Gruenewald. Hermann Muller, "Aus der Gruendungszeit des Council of Jews from Germany".

40|$|This {{working paper}} gives an {{overview}} of the farm group model CH-FARMIS - a comparative static, process analytical, non-linear programming model that allows a separate assessment of the impacts of policies on organic and non-organic farming in Switzerland. In CH-FARMIS, the agricultural sector is represented by thirty farm groups, which can be char-acterised by their farming system, farm type and geographic location. Book keeping data from the Swiss FADN was used as a primary source for the model. By applying farm-specific weight-ing factors, farm data were aggregated to sector accounts. The technical coefficients of the farm model were either taken directly from farm accounts or calculated on the basis of normative data. Agricultural production is represented by 29 crop activities and 15 livestock activities. The factor <b>allocation</b> and production <b>of</b> each farm group is optimised by maximising farm income under policy and management restrictions. The restrictions cover the area of land and labour use, livestock feeding, fertiliser balance, rearing <b>of</b> young stock, <b>allocation</b> <b>of</b> direct <b>payments</b> and requirements with respect to the organic production system. A positive mathematical pro-gramming approach (PMP) was used to calibrate the production activities in the base year to observed activity levels. ...|$|R

Kingdon's model on Policy Windows and the Advocacy Coalition framework by Sabatier and Jenkins are used to investigate explanations. ResultsThe arguments from the proponents are: that OOP payment for GP will reduce pressure on the primary sector; that the current <b>allocation</b> <b>of</b> OOP <b>payment</b> in the sector is historically conditioned; and that resistance towards OOP payment is based on emotions. The main argument from the opponents is that OOP payment will increase social inequality in health. ConclusionsThere is little connection between the attitudes and ideological backgrounds of the political parties. Despite factors such as perceived expert/scientific evidence for OOP <b>payment,</b> changes <b>of</b> government, financial crisis and a market-based reform wave, no government has introduced OOP payment for GP. This article suggests that governmental positions, public- and especially health-professional support are important factors in the decision-making context...|$|R
30|$|On the {{relationship}} between transfer payment and financial efficiency, the early public financial theory considers the central transfer payments and local tax are treated as equal by local government, and the revenue structure of local government does not affect arrangement of local financial expenditure, as well as fiscal expenditure efficiency (Wilde, 1968; Bradford and Oates, 1971;). The “flypaper effect” found {{at the end of}} 1970 shows that higher the proportion <b>of</b> transfer <b>payment</b> in revenue structure of local government, the larger the scale in financial expenditure (Hines and Thaler, 1995; Brennan and Pincus, 1996). Although the “flypaper effect” has no direct relationship with financial efficiency of local government, it has been proved that the financial revenue structure has effect on expenditure behavior of local government. Since the 1990 s, foreign studies focus on the issue of fairness and efficiency of transfer payment: whether the transfer payment can make the local government provide public service more fairly and efficiently (Gamkhar and Shah, 2007). In the literature <b>of</b> transfer <b>payment</b> and financial efficiency, the recent empirical studies generally think the transfer payment efficiency is lower than the local tax. Oates (1994) suggests that local government {{pay more attention to the}} transfer payment from higher level of government than local tax revenue, and the transfer payment efficiency is lower than that of local revenue. Baker et al. (1999) studied the Canadian’s subsidies system changed from unlimited amount to limited amount and found that this changing can improve capital efficiency and conserve spending of local government. Borck and Owings (2003) consider that it is the political reason not the efficiency that plays an important role that contributes the lower efficiency <b>of</b> transfer <b>payment</b> <b>of</b> central government. Albouy (2010) evaluated the efficiency and fairness of federal government fiscal equalization in USA, and suggested that the federal fiscal transfer policy is neither fair nor efficiency, and on the contrary, the problem of inefficiency and lacking of assistance to minority nationalities are aggravated. Bhatt and Scaramozzino (2013) empirically evaluated {{the relationship}} between transfer payment and financial deficit in India and suggested that the fiscal transfer payment system distorts the incentive status and has a significant positive correlation with government’s fiscal deficit. The domestic studies mainly concern about the equalization effect <b>of</b> transfer <b>payments</b> (Liu and Jiao, 2002; Ma and Yu, 2003; Guo et al., 2009; Jia et al., 2010). The literature <b>of</b> transfer <b>payment</b> efficiency is little. An (2007) suggested that it was due to unstandardized <b>allocation</b> <b>of</b> <b>payment</b> <b>allocation,</b> lacking <b>of</b> effective supervision and opaque operation that contributes to the low efficiency <b>of</b> financial transfer <b>payment.</b> Qiao et al. (2006) suggested both the categorical grant and condition grant have the moral risk, which reduces local government fiscal effort. Fan and Zhang (2010) study {{the relationship between}} transfer payment and economic growth and suggested the transfer payment policy is inefficient, which may reduce the potential of economic growth. However, Tang and Wang (2012) suggested that the higher local government depends on central financial transfer payment, the more capital invests to the strong rigidity area of science, education and agriculture, which improves the efficiency of local government finance. The view explains the efficiency <b>of</b> transfer <b>payment</b> is higher than that of revenue from another perspective.|$|R
40|$|The {{thesis of}} this article is that a more {{workable}} approach to characterizing fees for optional products and services is possible by focusing on charges that represent payment for discrete products or services of value to the consumer, freely chosen by consumers as contract options which do not affect the amount of credit available to the consumer, the consumer 2 ̆ 7 s access to it, or the <b>allocation</b> <b>of</b> <b>payment</b> responsibility and credit risk in the transaction or plan. In other words, these fees are for separate-or separable-purchases, analogous to subsequent events in closed-end credit that require no new disclosure or adjustment in the disclosed finance charge. 20 The primary focus {{of this article}} is on open-end credit because it involves greater interpretive and operational challenges. This article first explains, in Part II, the critical role of 2 ̆ 2 finance charges 2 ̆ 2 and 2 ̆ 2 other charges 2 ̆ 2 as costs imposed in credit transactions and thus elements in the TILA disclosure scheme. Part III provides a broad overview of the marketing and economic considerations that influence how creditors price their products, concluding that there is a long-accepted economic framework for identifying the true costs of credit. The next section, Part IV, analyzes the existing legal guidance on whether and when charges for optional products or services are finance charges or 2 ̆ 2 other charges 2 ̆ 2 in the TILA regime, suggesting that the current law lacks a consistent and coherent principle. Parts V and VI then propose a set of extreme alternative approaches, and several intermediate approaches on how TILA might deal with optional charges, and analyze how those approaches lack economic integrity. Finally, Part VII suggests a different approach that builds on accepted economic premises and characterizes charges as finance charges only when they compensate the creditor for one of the four recognized components of the cost of credit-origination, servicing, funding, and risk. Recognition of this principle, the authors suggest, can be accomplished, without amendments to TILA or Regulation Z, by amendments to the Official Staff Commentary...|$|R
5000|$|Although Pennsylvania had not {{elected a}} Democratic {{governor}} in over forty years, Earle defeated Republican Attorney General William A. Schnader in the 1934 Pennsylvania gubernatorial election. Though Earle faced a split legislature {{in the first}} half of his term, his party gained control of both chambers of the Pennsylvania legislature in the 1936 election. An ardent Roosevelt admirer, Earle rolled out an ambitious [...] "Little New Deal," [...] which resulted in the introduction of a record 3514 bills during the 1935-36 session of the Pennsylvania General Assembly. His administration created a centralized Department of Public Assistance that was designed to ensure uniform <b>allocation</b> <b>of</b> relief <b>payments.</b> Earle's government also sought to ameliorate ongoing labor strife by increasing union bargaining rights and eliminating the private police forces operated by many of the influential coal and steel companies. Pennsylvania Turnpike construction also began during his tenure. Other bills passed include Pennsylvania's first gasoline and cigarette tax, teacher tenure, and a maximum forty-hour work week. Earle's administration relaxed Pennsylvania's Blue laws, passed the nation's first milk control law, and outlawed company police forces hired by mining companies.|$|R
40|$|In 2020, {{decoupled}} payments will represent about 42 % of the CAP budget (green payments excluded). This report assesses the potential effects <b>of</b> European decoupled <b>payments</b> on farmers' production decisions, {{prior to a}} sensitivity analysis of different coupling factors using the Modular Applied GeNeral Equilibrium Tool (MAGNET). Scientific literature reveals different coupling channels such as capitalisation in land value, farmers' risk behaviour, credit accessibility, uncertainty about future policies and labour allocation through which European {{decoupled payments}} influence farm choices and thus output. For each of these channels the relevant literature introducing theoretical and empirical assessments is evaluated {{with the aim of}} deriving plausible behavioural parameters that improve the representation <b>of</b> decoupled <b>payments</b> in economic simulation models. To capture completely decoupled production behaviour, many CGE models typically represent decoupled payments as a uniform subsidy rate to the land using (agricultural) sectors. Nevertheless based on a thorough review of the literature, it appears that a more suitable modelling approach which caters for heterogeneous member state land markets, may be to split the <b>allocation</b> <b>of</b> decoupled <b>payments.</b> On the one hand, a proportion is committed to land {{as a function of the}} capitalisation rate into the rental value, whilst a second tranche is distributed uniformly across all factors, reflecting a balance of different coupling channels. A sensitivity analysis concludes that if one assumes differing degrees of coupling, it does have some implication for output and price results when conducting policy analysis. JRC.

40|$|Collaboration may be {{understood}} as the execution of coordinated tasks (in the most general sense) by groups of users, who cooperate for achieving a common goal. Collaboration is a fundamental assumption and requirement for the correct operation of many communication systems. The main challenge when creating collaborative systems in a decentralized manner {{is dealing with the}} fact that users may behave in selfish ways, trying to obtain the benefits of the tasks but without participating in their execution. In this context, Game Theory has been instrumental to model collaborative systems and the task allocation problem, and to design mechanisms for optimal <b>allocation</b> <b>of</b> tasks. In this paper, we revise the classical assumptions and propose a new approach to this problem. First, we establish a system model based on heterogenous nodes (users, players), and propose a basic distributed mechanism so that, when a new task appears, it is assigned to the most suitable node. The classical technique for compensating a node that executes a task is the use <b>of</b> <b>payments</b> (which in most networks are hard or impossible to implement). Instead, we propose a distributed mechanism for the optimal <b>allocation</b> <b>of</b> tasks without <b>payments.</b> We prove this mechanism to be robust event in the presence of independent selfish or rationally limited players. Additionally, our model is based on very weak assumptions, which makes the proposed mechanisms susceptible to be implemented in networked systems (e. g., the Internet). ...|$|R
40|$|The study {{concerns}} rent seeking in the <b>allocation</b> <b>of</b> the Structural Funds {{for cultural}} {{development in the}} region of Calabria. The Regional planning following the European guidelines was very complex. Own cultural axis, officially oriented to promote tourism, consisted of three measures, each oriented to four goals, with five strategies for each goal and seven specific actions, each articulate in a number of sub-actions, without any clear priority. In the statistical analysis the variables relating to the most important cultural sites had no significance. Rent seeking relating to no profits, to criminal hubs, to construction interests, to employment of people was significant. It may explain the fragmentation of the projects. On the other hand, the presence of the best cultural sites was not important in the disbursement of funds for the criminal hubs. The anomalous discrepancy between <b>allocation</b> <b>of</b> funds and <b>payments</b> also could be explained as a rent seeking phenomenon. The centre-right Government spent funds for investment projects, the centre-left Government devoted funds to service projects and the employment of unskilled labor and intellectual labor...|$|R
40|$|To attain {{fundamental}} {{reform of}} the post- 2013 Common Agricultural Policy (CAP), a serious debate is needed in 2009 / 10 that prepares the decisions {{to be taken in}} 2011 / 12. The paper contributes to this debate, first, by arguing that the Single Farm Payment should not become the mainstay of the future CAP but be gradually phased out. Second, it proposes that the existing two-pillar structure of the CAP should be replaced by a public goods pillar (containing all efficient policies to be preserved) and a discretionary pillar (encompassing all inefficient policies to be removed over time). This would give member states flexibility in how they phase out inefficient policies, while the EU reform agenda would not be clogged with the contentious details of their progressive removal. Third, the paper assesses the criteria likely to guide future <b>allocation</b> <b>of</b> CAP <b>payments,</b> such as GDP per capita, agricultural and forest areas, and areas with Natura 2000 status. Fourth, it estimates member states’ share in total CAP payments under different post- 2013 scenarios. This reveals surprising differences between the negotiating positions that countries traditionally adopt and the payment receipts they can expect from reform.

40|$|We study {{multipath}} routing {{with traffic}} assignment in selfish networks. Based on the Vickrey-Clarke-Groves (VCG) auction, an optimal and strategy-proof scheme, known as optimal auction-based multipath routing (OAMR), is developed. However, OAMR is computationally expensive and cannot run {{in real time}} when the network size is large. Therefore, we propose sequential auction-based multipath routing (SAMR). SAMR handles routing requests sequentially using some greedy strategies. In particular, {{with reference to the}} Ausubel auction, we develop a water-draining algorithm to assign the traffic of a request among its available paths and determine the <b>payment</b> <b>of</b> the transmission in approximately constant time. Our simulation results show that SAMR can rapidly compute the <b>allocations</b> and <b>payments</b> <b>of</b> requests with small sacrifice on the system cost. Moreover, various sequencing strategies for sequential auction are also investigated. © 2013 IEEE. published_or_final_versio...|$|R

40|$|This {{article will}} explore key {{regulatory}} and ethical challenges presented by reproductive tissue transplants (RTTs) {{as they are}} currently developing, recognizing that additional issues may reveal themselves as the technologies progress. Part I of this article will begin {{with a discussion of}} the current status of the technology, including the results and status of animal and human experiments for all three types of transplants. Part II will explore the demand for RTTs—who might consider such a transplant and why RTTS might be considered by some patients as more favorable than other reproductive options. Part III will explore the different regulatory channels which might apply to RTT, including organ transplant ART and tissue regulations, mainly at the federal level. Having analyzed which rules are likely to apply to RTT, Part IV will discuss five key regulatory and ethical issues raised by RTT: research requirements for fair and safe research of RTT, informed consent of donors and recipients if RTTs become clinically available, <b>allocation</b> <b>of</b> reproductive organs, <b>payment</b> for potential donors, parental rights of donors, and disposition of cryopreserved organs...|$|R
40|$|The {{short time}} left until the EU {{accession}} date, {{has become a}} strong pressure factor for the speeding up of the necessary restructuring processes of the agrifood sector and rural areas. This is a challenge without precedent for the decision makers in the following period in order to prepare the sector from both institutional and legislative point and of views to implement the Common Agricultural Policy and {{for the management of}} the funds related to it. In the same time the sector also has to be to be “morally” prepared for the exigencies and potential shocks {{due to the lack of}} competitiveness after entering the Single Market and this activity has to be also a priority. The absorption of community funds proposed for Romania in 2004, will depend especially of the wish for restructuring and "the abilities" of the decision makers in chasing the right pattern of agricultural policy for the next period, and after accession. The cost/benefits estimations in this document are based on a very simplistic approach. The scenario proposed starts from the optimistic hypothesis that, until 2007 Romania will be fully prepared from institutional point of view, as well as from point of view of the requirements regarding food security, animal welfare, the environment's state etc., and it will be able to produce at the level established by negotiations, fulfilling 100 % the eligibility conditions, and Romania will enter on the Single Market with the negotiated elements (quotas, basic areas, reference productions, etc.).
