By this definition, simple programs that solve specific problems are [...] "{{intelligent agent}}s", as <b>are</b> <b>human</b> <b>beings</b> and organizations of human beings, such as firms. The intelligent agent paradigm defines AI research as [...] "the study of intelligent agents". This is a generalization of some earlier definitions of AI: it goes beyond studying human intelligence; it studies all kinds of intelligence.|$|E
500|$|A Vindication of the Rights of Woman: with Strictures on Political and Moral Subjects (1792), {{written by}} the 18th-century British proto-feminist Mary Wollstonecraft, {{is one of the}} {{earliest}} works of feminist philosophy. In it, Wollstonecraft responds to those educational and political theorists of the 18th century who did not believe women should have an education. She argues that women ought to have an education commensurate with their position in society, claiming that women are essential to the nation because they educate its children and because they could be [...] "companions" [...] to their husbands, rather than mere wives. Instead of viewing women as ornaments to society or property to be traded in marriage, Wollstonecraft maintains that they <b>are</b> <b>human</b> <b>beings</b> deserving of the same fundamental rights as men.|$|E

500|$|A Vindication of the Rights of Woman {{is one of}} the {{earliest}} works of feminist philosophy. In it, Wollstonecraft argues that women ought to have an education [...] with their position in society and then proceeds to redefine that position, claiming that women are essential to the nation because they educate its children and because they could be [...] "companions" [...] to their husbands rather than mere wives. Instead of viewing women as ornaments to society or property to be traded in marriage, Wollstonecraft maintains that they <b>are</b> <b>human</b> <b>beings</b> deserving of the same fundamental rights as men. Large sections of the Rights of Woman respond vitriolically to conduct book writers such as James Fordyce and John Gregory and educational philosophers such as Jean-Jacques Rousseau, who wanted to deny women an education. (Rousseau famously argues in [...] (1762) that women should be educated for the pleasure of men.) ...|$|E
500|$|The {{idea for}} [...] "No Russian" [...] was {{conceived}} {{during the initial}} brainstorming sessions for Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 plot. The developers at Infinity Ward wanted to discuss how terrorists operate in the modern era, and sought to create an unimaginable, albeit plausible scenario that the player would feel uncomfortable in. Lead writer Jesse Stern noted that despite the grim subject matter, people instinctively {{want to know what}} it is like to experience these attacks, and cited documentaries about the 2008 Mumbai attacks and the Columbine High School massacre as evidence. According to Stern: [...] "These <b>are</b> <b>human</b> <b>beings</b> who perpetrate these acts, so you don't really want to turn a blind eye to it. You want to take it apart and figure out how that happened and what, if anything, can be done to prevent it. Ultimately, our intention was to put you as close as possible to atrocity." ...|$|E
500|$|On 29 March 1928, when a bill {{came before}} {{parliament}} giving {{the vote in}} parliamentary elections to all men and women over 21, she termed the measure [...] "a tremendous social advance", and added: [...] "At last [...] are established on that equitable footing because we <b>are</b> <b>human</b> <b>beings</b> and part of society as a whole... once and for all, we shall destroy the artificial barrier {{in the way of}} any women who want to get education in politics and who want to come forward and take their full share in the political life of their day". When the bill became law, 4 million voters, most of them women, were added to the register. In the 1929 general election, held on 30 May, Bondfield easily held her Wallsend seat despite the intervention of a candidate representing unemployed workers. The overall election result left Labour as the largest party with 287 seats, but without an overall majority, and MacDonald formed his second minority administration.|$|E

2500|$|Swami Vivekananda warned it is {{completely}} unfair to discriminate between sexes, as there is not any sex distinction in atman (soul), the soul has neither sex, nor caste nor imperfection. He suggested not {{to think that there}} are men and women, but only that there <b>are</b> <b>human</b> <b>beings.</b> Swami Vivekananda felt, The best thermometer to the progress of a nation is its treatment of its women and it is impossible to get back India's lost pride and honor unless they try to better the condition of women. [...] Vivekananda considered men and women as two wings of a bird, and it is not possible for a bird to fly on only one wing. So, according to him, there is no chance for welfare of the world unless the condition of woman is improved.|$|E

2500|$|The {{legislature}} met {{in joint}} session as a constitutional convention on February 11, and after {{six hours of}} debate rejected two amendments, one proposed by House Speaker Thomas M. Finneran and the other by Senate President Robert E. Travaglini. Both banned same-sex marriage, one made civil unions possible and the other established civil unions. Finneran commented: [...] "We are as divided as the nation on this. We are doing the best we can. We <b>are</b> <b>human</b> <b>beings.</b> We struggle. Sometimes we come up short." [...] The convention met again {{the next day and}} defeated an amendment that defined marriage as the union {{of a man and a}} woman and disavowed any position on civil unions on a 103-94 vote that showed divisions in each party and Catholic legislators evenly divided. Ronald Crews of the Massachusetts Family Institute blamed Finneran's misreading of his own caucus for the failure of his own proposed language, a defeat in the convention's opening moments from which Crews found it impossible to recover.|$|E
2500|$|Psychiatrist Ernst Simmel first defined {{primordial}} narcissism in 1944. [...] Simmel's fundamental {{thesis is}} that the most primitive stage of libidinal development is not the oral, but the gastrointestinal one. Mouth and anus are merely to be considered as the terminal parts of this organic zone. Simmel terms the psychological condition of prenatal existence [...] "primordial narcissism." [...] It is the vegetative stage of the pre-ego, identical with the id. At this stage there is complete instinctual repose, manifested in unconsciousness. Satiation of the gastrointestinal zone, {{the representative of the}} instinct of self-preservation, can bring back this complete instinctual repose, which, under pathological conditions, can become the aim of the instinct. Contrary to Lasch, Bernard Stiegler argues in his book, Acting Out, that consumer capitalism is in fact destructive of what he calls primordial narcissism, without which {{it is not possible to}} extend love to others. In other words, he is referring to the natural state of an infant as a fetus and in the first few days of its life, before it has learned that other people exist besides itself, and therefore cannot possibly be aware that they <b>are</b> <b>human</b> <b>beings</b> with feelings, rather than having anything to do with actual narcissism.|$|E

The last question expresses a huge skepticism against “life-ability” {{in a manner}} of human existence. According to Blumenberg man can survive only if he distances himself – in a direct and in a metaphorical sense – from the overwhelming power of reality. As an animal that has eyes and moves on two legs man can secure himself from dangers and set traps for what he desires. In the metaphorical sense he distances himself from all-powerful reality through creating myths, religions, sciences, technique, art and culture. They are proven forms of to get over with anxieties and dangers <b>human</b> <b>being</b> faces in the terrible and anonymous world...|$|R
