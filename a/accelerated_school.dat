Zhang`s former name was Zhang Yunyi (云镒). Zhang Shengzhi was his alternate name. After he joined the revolution, he changed his name to Zhang Yunyi (云逸). In 1908, Zhang successfully passed the entrance examination of Whampoa Military Academy in Guangzhou and enrolled. In Oct. 1909, in primary school, Zhang joined the Tongmenghui(United League) secretly with a few of patriotic classmates. Zhang left the Whampoa Military Academy and took part in the Second Guangzhou Uprising in 1911. When the Xinhai Revolution against the Qing Dynasty broke out in 1911 he joined the Revolutionary Army and requested to be the captain of the bomb troops. After the establishment of the Provisional Government of the Republic of China in Nanjing in 1912, Zhang was recommended to the Humen, Guangdong Army <b>accelerated</b> <b>school</b> by the revolutionary government. In the midsummer of 1914, Zhang graduated from the <b>accelerated</b> <b>school</b> with excellent grades and went to work in Hainan. He took part in the National Protection War in 1915.

40|$|This paper briefly {{describes}} the <b>Accelerated</b> <b>Schools</b> Project, presents ideas concerning an appropriate evaluation model, and conveys some early results achieved across the nation. The <b>Accelerated</b> <b>Schools</b> model attempts to restructure schools with {{high concentrations of}} students in at-risk situations so that they enter the mainstream {{by the end of}} elementary school. Encompassing both a philosophy of accelerated achievement and a process for meeting this goal, the project transforms schools according to three basic principles: unity of purpose, empowerment with responsibility, and building on strengths. The standard evaluation model is inadequate to assess such an all-encompassing process. H. M. Levin and his associates have designed an overall evaluation model for <b>accelerated</b> <b>schools</b> comprising three distinct stages: decision-making, implementation, and student outcomes. Although no <b>accelerated</b> <b>schools</b> have completed a 6 -year participation cycle, some promising results have emerged. A successful project in Houston, Texas, is described in detail, followed by "snapshots " of pioneering efforts in California, Missouri, and Illinois.

A depressed economy, low wages, and racial discrimination produced financial hardships for the family and in 1948 (the year of Winbush's birth), the family left Pittsburgh and moved to the east side of Cleveland, Ohio to begin anew. At the request of his elementary school art teacher, Winbush was tested and scored high on the Stanford-Binet Intelligence Test.

The government also introduced “the concept of schools incorporating community facilities for use outside school hours,” and tried to broaden the function of schools into community centres. In addition, sessional allowances and building subsidies for kindergartens and playcentres were significantly increased, bursaries and other grants were increased for technical institute and university students, housing allowances were granted to married male teacher trainees, and grants for hobby classes (which had been cut in 1971 as an austerity measure) were also reinstated.

40|$|Despite the {{blizzard}} of reform activity since 1983, neither state legislation nor state education department mandates have diminished the failure rates of at-risk youngsters.

The <b>accelerated</b> <b>school,</b> as envisioned and implemented by Henry Levin and associates, invites school staffs to use their expertise, interest, and resources to restructure their schools ' organization, curriculum, and instructional practices. Such schools seek to maze all youngsters academically able by the time they leave sixth grade. <b>Accelerated</b> <b>school</b> communities abide by three guiding principles: (1) unity of purpose; (2) empowerment to make and impleme:It important decisions; and (3) willingness to alter perceptions of themselves and their students by building on strengths.

Over the past 60 years, most countries have adopted mass education and have <b>accelerated</b> <b>school</b> expansion to accommodate the growing demand for education (Baker and LeTendre 2005). Particular attention has been given to girls ’ schooling, not only because of its importance in reaching universal educa-tion but also because of its demonstrated social benefits.
