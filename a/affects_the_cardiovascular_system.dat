5000|$|Hemopericardium is a {{condition}} that <b>affects</b> <b>the</b> <b>cardiovascular</b> <b>system.</b> It typically begins with blood accumulating in the pericardial sac posterior to the heart, and eventually expands to surround the entire heart. The fluid build-up then causes pressure within the pericardial sac to increase. If the pressure becomes greater than the intracardiac pressure of the heart, compression of the adjacent cardiac chambers can occur. [...] This compression, called cardiac tamponade, {{is often associated with}} hemopericardium and can be fatal if not diagnosed and treated promptly. Early signs of this compression include right atrial inversion during ventricular systole followed by diastolic compression of the right ventricular outflow tract.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThere is {{increasing}} {{evidence that a}} low vitamin D status {{may be an important}} and hitherto neglected factor of cardiovascular disease. This review is an overview of the current body of literature, and presents evidence of the mechanisms through which vitamin D deficiency <b>affects</b> <b>the</b> <b>cardiovascular</b> <b>system</b> in general and the heart in particular. Available data indicate that the majority of congestive heart failure patients have 25 -hydroxyvitamin D deficiency. Furthermore, the low serum 25 -hydroxyvitamin D level has a higher impact on hypertension, coronary artery disease an on the occurrence of relevant cardiac events. A serum 25 -hydroxyvitamin D level below 75 nmol/l (30 ng/l) is generally regarded as vitamin D insufficiency in both adults and children, while a level below 50 nmol/l (20 ng/l) is considered deficiency.

Despite of all advances in pharmacological and clinical management, heart failure is a foremost reason of morbidity worldwide. Many novel therapeutic strategies, embody cell transplantation, gene delivery or therapy, and cytokines or other small molecules, have been studied to treat heart failure [98]. An inadequate number of people are affected in developing countries; over 80 % of deaths due to cardiovascular disorder take place in underdeveloped countries and occur almost evenly in male and females [99]. Mathers et al. in 2008 estimated that there are 9.4 million deaths each year [100]. This concludes 45 % of deaths caused by coronary heart disease and 51 % of deaths due to heart strokes [101].

The major preventable risk factors for cardiovascular disease are tobacco smoking, high blood pressure, high blood cholesterol, insufficient physical activity, overweight and obesity, poor nutrition, and diabetes. Most cardiovascular diseases reflect chronic conditions that develop or persist {{over a long period}} of time. However, sometimes, the outcome of cardiovascular disease could be acute events such as heart attacks that occur suddenly when a vessel supplying blood to the heart becomes blocked.

30|$|Hypertension (HT) is {{a silent}} disease that <b>affects</b> <b>the</b> <b>cardiovascular</b> <b>system</b> and settles down without pain and {{symptoms}} at the beginning; therefore, {{it is bad}} or late diagnosed (WHO 2012; Nejjari et al. 2013). HT affects various organs and engenders grave affections; such as vascular cerebral accident and heart disorder (Nejjari et al. 2013). When the hypertensive patients are bad treated or untreated, the disease reduces the flexibility of arteries, what favors the apparition of the cardiac insufficiency, angina pectoris, atherosclerosis, stroke cerebral, microvascular diseases of retina and glomerulus (UKPDS 1998; Cohuet and Struijker-Boudier 2006). The management of the HT becomes more difficult when it is accompanied by diabetes and obesity (Garcia et al. 2008). The relations between these three affections are strong and well demonstrated (UKPDS 1998; Grossman and Messerli 1996; Hayashi et al. 2004). Multiple factors such as age, sex, stress, residence, physical inactivity and dietary habits are associated with this vascular disease (Joffres et al. 1997; Tazi et al. 2003; Karppanen and Mervaala 2006; Rosenthal and Alter 2012).|$|E

40|$|Epidemiologic {{evidence}} indicates that air pollution adversely <b>affects</b> <b>the</b> <b>cardiovascular</b> <b>system,</b> leading to increased cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. However, the mechanisms of such an association are unknown. Although potential mechanisms of deleterious effects of air pollution may involve response of the respiratory system, immunologic response, or coagulation abnormalities, the cardiovascular system {{seems to be the}} common end point of these pathways. Cardiovascular response to any stress (which may include air pollution) is a consequence of a complex interplay between the autonomic nervous system governing centrally mediated control of the cardiovascular system, a myocardial substrate (current state of the myocardium) altered in the course of disease processes, and myocardial vulnerability leading to arrhythmogenic or ischemic response. Through the use of standard electrocardiograms (ECGs), exercise ECG testing, and long-term ambulatory ECG monitoring, modern electrocardiology makes a valuable contribution to understanding the different mechanistic factors involved in the increase in adverse cardiovascular events due to air pollution. Heart rate variability analysis can provide quantitative insight into the autonomic response of the cardiovascular system to air pollution.

The {{purpose of this study was}} to determine if the effects of aging on NOS, oxidative stress, and vascular function are different in males and females. Mesenteric arteries from young (3 month) and old (24 month), male and female F 344 /BN rats were studied. Western blot analysis and NOS activity were performed on the homogenized mesenteric arterial bed separated into cytosolic and membrane-associated fractions. Plasma 8 -isoprostane measurements assessed oxidative stress. Vascular reactivity was determined using a wire myograph in the absence and presence of a NOS inhibitor, N-nitro-L-arginine, to examine endothelial function, basal, and stimulated NO release. In additional arteries, reactivity was performed in the presence of PEG-SOD to assess the impact of superoxide on vascular function. Among females, aging was associated with a decline in membrane-associated NOS activity and membrane-associated NOS 3 protein expression. Advancing age in males was associated with increased cytosolic NOS 3 protein expression. Among both males and females, advancing age resulted in increased oxidative stress. Vascular function was maintained with age in arteries from both males and females, and there wa...|$|E

Coronary artery spasm has been {{observed}} in animals [1, 2] and an increased incidence of arrhythmia has been reported in man [3, 4]. Hypomagnesaemia en-hances digitalis-related arrhythmias [5] and has been associated with sudden death in patients with ischaemic heart disease [6]. The magnesium content of myocardial muscle {{has been found to be}} low following myocardial ischaemia [7 - 9], while the administration of magnesium i. v. follow-ing acute myocardial infarction has been shown to reduce the incidences of arrhythmia and mortality [10]. In patients undergoing mitral valve replace-ment, who had received chronic diuretic therapy and exhibited increased QTcorr intervals on their ECG, preoperative treatment with magnesium by mouth reduced the incidence of postoperative arrhythmia [11]. Previous studies have shown a decrease in plasma magnesium concentration in association with extracorporeal haemodilution [12]. This can be prevented by using magnesium-containing solutions to achieve cardioplegic arrest [13]. The present study examines the effect of the intra-operative administration of magnesium chloride 16 mmol on plasma magnesium concentration after coronary revascularization without cardio-plegic arrest. QT intervals corrected for heart rate (QTcorr) and the frequency of ventricular ar-rhythmias, were examined in magnesium-treated and control groups.

40|$|The {{risk for}} {{cardiovascular}} incidents is {{highest in the}} early morning, which seems partially due to endogenous factors. Endogenous circadian rhythms in mammalian physiology and behavior are regulated by the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN). Recently, anatomical evidence has been provided that SCN functioning is disturbed in patients with essential hypertension. Here we review neural and neuroendocrine mechanisms by which the SCN regulates the cardiovascular system. First, we discuss evidence for an endogenous circadian rhythm in cardiac activity, both in humans and rats, which is abolished after SCN lesioning in rats. The immediate impact of retinal light exposure at night on SCN-output to the cardiovascular system, which signals 'day' in both diurnal (human) and nocturnal (rat) mammals with opposite effects on physiology, is discussed. Furthermore, we discuss the impact of melatonin treatment on the SCN and its potential medical relevance in patients with essential hypertension. Finally, we argue that regional differentiation of the SCN and autonomous nervous system is required to explain the multitude of circadian rhythms. Insights into the mechanisms by which the SCN <b>affects</b> <b>the</b> <b>cardiovascular</b> <b>system</b> may provide new strategies {{for the treatment of}} disease conditions known to coincide with circadian rhythm disturbances, as is presented for essential hypertensio...|$|E
40|$|The {{progress}} in cancer therapy {{and the increase}} in number of long-term survivors reveal the issue of cardiovascular side-effects of anticancer drugs. Cardiotoxicity has become a significant problem, and the risks of adverse cardiac events induced by systemic drugs need to be seriously considered. Potential cardiovascular toxicities linked to anticancer agents include arrhythmias, myocardial ischemia and infarction, hypertension, thromboembolism, left ventricular dysfunction, and heart failure. It has been shown that several anticancer drugs seriously affect the cardiovascular system, such as ErbB 2 inhibitors, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) inhibitors, multitargeted kinase inhibitors, Abelson murine leukemia viral oncogene homolog inhibitors, and others. Each of these agents has a different mechanism through which it <b>affects</b> <b>the</b> <b>cardiovascular</b> <b>system.</b> ErbB 2 inhibitors block the ErbB 4 /ErbB 2 heterodimerization pathway triggered by Neuregulin- 1, which is essential for cardiomyocyte survival. VEGF signaling is crucial for vascular growth, but it also has a major impact on myocardial function, and the VEGF pathway is also essential for maintenance of cardiovascular homeostasis. Drugs that inhibit the VEGF signaling pathway lead to a net reduction in capillary density and loss of contractile function. Here, we review the mechanisms and pathophysiology of the most significant cardiotoxic effects of ErbB 2 inhibitors and antiangiogenic drugs. Moreover, we highlight the role of cardioncology in recognizing these toxicities, developing strategies to prevent or minimize cardiovascular toxicity, and reducing long-term cardiotoxic effects...|$|E

The {{purpose of this}} study was to investigate whether there was any difference in the hemodynamic changes induced by tracheal intubation with using remifentanil between smokers and nonsmokers. Methods: Eighty patients were enrolled: male smokers (MS), male nonsmokers (MN), female smokers (FS) and female nonsmokers (FN). Anesthesia was induced with diluted remifentanil (20 μg/ml) at a rate of 10 μg/kg/hr using an infusion pump, and 2 min later, midazolam 0. 05 mg/kg and propofol 0. 8 mg/kg were injected for achieving unconsciousness. Rocuronium 1 mg/kg was used for muscle relaxation, and tracheal intubation was performed 2 min after rocuronium injection. After tracheal intubation, the remifentanil was decreased to 2 μg/kg/hr. The mean arterial pressure (MAP) and heart rate (HR) were checked before induction, on unconsciousness, just before intubation, just after intubation and 1, 2 and 3 minutes after intubation, and these values were compared between the groups. Results: In men, the MAP and HR just after intubation and at 1, 2 and 3 minutes after intubation in Group MS were significantly higher than those of Group MN (P < 0. 05).

Therefore, the adverse health effects of exposure to nanomaterials have received great attention. Animal studies indicated that short-term pulmonary exposure to engineered nanoparticles can cause a severe or minor inflammatory reaction in the lung depending on the {{physical and chemical properties}} of nanomaterial tested. In addition, pulmonary exposure to carbon nanotubes (CNTs) has been linked to lung fibrosis and cancer promotion [1 – 5]. Although the recent emphasis on occupational exposure to nanomaterials has focused more on lung disease and carcinogenesis and less on <b>the</b> <b>cardiovascular</b> <b>system,</b> evidence from epidemiological and recent animal studies strongly indicate that pulmonary exposure to nanomaterials can <b>affect</b> <b>the</b> <b>cardiovascular</b> <b>system</b> by nanoparticle-induced inflammation, translocation, and/or neuron regulation [6 – 9]. Our studies have found that nanoparticles from ultrafine titanium dioxide (UFTiO 2) and multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs), at doses that cause a minor acute inflammatory reaction in the lung, can transiently increase neurotransmitter synthesis in the peripheral neurons [8] and lead to the alterations in the activity of the autonomic nervous system (ANS) [10]. In addition, we also reported previously that direct exposure of isolated cardiomyocytes to UFTiO 2 did not alter biological activity of cardiomyocytes [11]. Taken together, our studies strongly suggested that some nanomaterials, at doses which exhibit a minor acute effect in <b>the</b> lung, <b>affect</b> <b>the</b> <b>cardiovascular</b> <b>system</b> by influencing <b>the</b> neuronal system rather than by the direct translocation of nanoparticles to the heart.|$|R
