5|$|Scientific Atlanta's first {{business}} {{focus was}} antennas for military and industrial use. Finances were tight at the fledgling firm. When {{they could not}} afford an automatic <b>antenna</b> <b>pattern</b> recorder, of which there was only one such machine on the market, Robinson decided to build his own. When word in the industry spread companies began contacting Scientific Atlanta. Within six months of the development of the device, Robinson sold units to Western Electric, Westinghouse Electric Corporation, General Electric, Convair, American Machine and Foundry, and many other large corporations of the era. Within eight years of operating, the firm had captured 60% of the global market share of electronic instruments for testing and designing antennas, had broken ground on a 25 acre facility in Northeast Atlanta, and had 240 employees on the payroll including 40 engineers.|$|E

ABSTRACT (Maximum 200 words) <b>Antenna</b> <b>patterns</b> {{can be designed}} to have broad notches in regions where clutter and jamming {{are expected to be}} received. A number of narrowband synthesis techniques exist to design notched <b>antenna</b> <b>patterns,</b> but they break down in the presence of wideband signals on arrays which employ a combination of phase and time steering. The authors derive definitions for wideband <b>antenna</b> <b>patterns</b> and present a new synthesis procedure which can be used to design notched patterns for signals having specified bandwidths on any type of array...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{considers}} {{the impact of}} phaseless (or magnitude only) output <b>antenna</b> <b>patterns</b> {{on the performance of}} multiple antenna systems which employ impedance matching networks. In particular, correlation and capacity are used as performance metrics when the output patterns are with or without phase information. Two methods of synthesizing complex <b>antenna</b> <b>patterns</b> are also discussed and their performances are evaluated. Results show the significance of having phase information on output <b>antenna</b> <b>patterns</b> when evaluating MIMO performance. Adding random phases to phaseless output patterns tends to overestimate the capacity performance, whereas adding synthesized phases according to antenna spacings underestimates capacity...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—We {{introduce}} a measurement-based optimization framework for topology control in dense 802. 11 networks using sectorized antennas. We first formulate a topology control optimization problem, where nodes activate their sectorized <b>antenna</b> <b>patterns</b> to minimize network interference and maximize network capacity. In contrast to previous approaches, our formulation {{is based on}} a physical interference model that relies on Received Signal Strength (RSS) measurements on multiple <b>antenna</b> <b>patterns</b> of each link. We then {{introduce a}} distributed measurement protocol to measure RSS of these <b>antenna</b> <b>patterns</b> and a greedy distributed topology control protocol that uses this information to achieve topologies of minimal interference. The protocols are experimentally evaluated on a dense 802. 11 wireless testbed. Extensive measurements show that the protocols operate very close to optimal and yield significant increase in network throughput compared to omni-directional antennas. These results hold for various traffic scenarios in both wireless LAN and mesh network configurations. I...|$|R

40|$|Abstract-In a {{wireless}} network with path loss and fading channels, receiver capture {{is known to}} substantially enhance {{the performance of the}} slotted ALOHA random access protocol. The efficiency of narrowband slotted ALOHA radio networks can be enhanced further by using sector antennas, each receiving signals from a particular segment of the network area. This paper investigates the effect of realistic, Le., partially overlapping <b>antenna</b> <b>patterns</b> and the resulting correlation of received power levels at different receiver branches. A method is derived for computing the joint throughput from two base station receivers with overlapping <b>antennas</b> <b>patterns.</b> The a posteriori informa-tion provided by the event of one message capturing one antenna is used to find conditional probabilities of capturing the other antennas as well. The paper shows that any overlap in the <b>antenna</b> <b>patterns</b> decreases the throughput, but transmissions from the overlapping area may face a larger probability of capture than signals from directions in which one antenna has maximum gain.
