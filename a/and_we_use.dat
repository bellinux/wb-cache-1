25|$|In October 1980, {{the dozen}} or so {{erstwhile}} nuns held their first fundraiser, a bingo game and Salsa dance that was well-attended {{in large part because of}} the write-up in The San Francisco Chronicle by Herb Caen the same day, who printed their organization name, the Sisters of Perpetual Indulgence. The benefit was for San Francisco's Metropolitan Community Church Cuban Refugee Program, and it netted $1,500 ($ in 2009). The Sisters began making regular appearances at Castro events that focused on sexual tolerance or provided a showcase for drag. They also developed a mission statement:The Sisters of Perpetual Indulgence is a leading-edge Order of queer nuns. Since our first appearance in San Francisco on Easter Sunday, 1979, the Sisters have devoted ourselves to community service, ministry and outreach to those on the edges, and to promoting human rights, respect for diversity and spiritual enlightenment. We believe all people have a right to express their unique joy and beauty <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>use</b> humor and irreverent wit to expose the forces of bigotry, complacency and guilt that chain the human spirit.|$|E
500|$|The team {{developed}} {{the story and}} design simultaneously. [...] "We use the story to expose the mechanics, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>use</b> the mechanics to tell the story," [...] said Dan Houser. Houser {{found it difficult to}} create the narrative, as the game is so strongly focused on player freedom. He wanted the story to be more nuanced and interesting than the generic [...] "rise and fall and rise again of a superhero bad guy". The game's script was also focused on mission objectives, attempting to implement high amounts of interactivity. Houser felt that each mission is [...] "its own short story", and part of an [...] "overarching story". Houser and co-writer James Worrall drew influence from mob films, and the mafiosi featured in films by Martin Scorsese. When writing the story, Houser and Worrall regularly met with the designers, and filled a room with post-it notes to reconstruct the story components to shape the game.|$|E

In this case, we have to use a smaller σ-algebra , for example the Borel algebra of [...] Ω, which is the smallest σ-algebra that makes all open sets measurable.|$|E

30|$|For the computations, <b>we</b> <b>used</b> an {{implementation}} [17] of {{the proposed}} boundary element methods {{which is based on}} the Fast Multipole Method [18] for fast and data-sparse realizations of the involved boundary integral operators. The Steklov-Poincaré operator formulation is implemented by means of MPI <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>used</b> one process per active subdomain, i.e. two processes for (17) and three processes for (18). The implementation of the Fast Multipole Method utilizes OpenMP <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>used</b> two threads for each instance of the program. The computations were done on a Workstation with 2 Intel Xeon E 5620 processors and 24 GB RAM.|$|R

2500|$|In February 2009, Marshall, Mike Hall and Colin Harris {{founded the}} Merseyside Skeptics Society. He commented that {{skepticism}} is [...] "not about just saying 'no' to things, it's about thinking about them. <b>And</b> <b>we</b> <b>use</b> the American spelling – skeptic – because, in the States, the word isn't as strongly linked to cynicism. It's {{not seen as}} being as negative as it is over here." [...] In July that year, they launched the podcast Skeptics with a K, which Marshall described as [...] "a fairly-shambolic, overly-enthusiastic and snarky mix of science, skepticism and sarcasm." [...] The idea for SwaK came from the conversations Mike and Marsh were having in the pub about news and ideas, such as a homeopathy overdose, {{that they wanted to}} share with a wider audience.|$|E

6000|$|Again, {{our whole}} {{conception}} of American art may be modified by these considerations: {{that it requires}} more genius to build a free state than to make a sonnet, and the Colonists were mighty state-builders; that a ship is a beautiful object, and American ships with their graceful lines and towering clouds of canvas were once famous the world over; that architecture is a noble art, and Colonial architecture still charms us by its beauty and utility after three hundred years of experimental building. [...] "Art" [...] is a great word, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>use</b> it too narrowly when we apply it to an ode of Shelley or a mutilated statue of Praxiteles, but are silent before a Colonial church or a free commonwealth or the Constitution of the United States.|$|E

6000|$|There is {{something}} very awful in these words, too late! We read of and hear them often, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>use</b> them sometimes, lightly it may be, {{but it is only}} when they can be used by ourselves with reference to something very serious, that we have a glimmering of their terrible significance. There is a proverb, [...] "It is never too late to mend," [...] which is misleading. When the dream of life is over, and the doom is fixed, it is too late to mend. No doubt the proverb is meant to refer to our condition while this life lasts, but even here it is misleading. When the murderer withdraws the knife and gazes, it may be, horror-struck at the expressionless face of his victim, it is too late. He cannot mend the severed thread of life. When the reckless drunkard draws {{near the end of his}} career, and looks in the mirror, and starts to see the wreck of his former self, it is too late. Health will never more return. Not too late, blessed be God, for the salvation of the soul, but too late for the recovery of all that was held dear in the life of earth.|$|E

Altogether, we use about seventy-five tons of our own iron a month here. Iron in Calcutta costs about five-eight a hundredweight; ours costs between three-four and three-eight, and on that item alone we save three thousand a month. Don't ask me how many miles of rails we own. There are fifteen hundred miles of line, and {{you can make your own}} calculation. All those things like babies' graves, down in that shed, are the moulds for the D. and O. sleepers. We test them by dropping three hundredweight and three hundred quarters of iron on top of them from a height of seven feet, or eleven sometimes. They don't often smash. We have a notion here that our iron is as good as the Home stuff." ...|$|E
