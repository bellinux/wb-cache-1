This AS-level topology graph has been widely used {{in a variety of}} research efforts. Conventionally this topology graph is derived from routing tables collected by RouteViews or RIPE RIS. In this work, we assemble the most complete AS-level topology by extending the conventional method along two dimensions. First, in addition to using data from RouteViews and RIPE RIS, we also collect data from many other sources, including route servers, looking glasses, and routing registries. Second, in addition to using routing tables, we also accumulate topological information from routing updates over time. The resulting topology graph on <b>a</b> <b>recent</b> <b>day</b> contains 44 % more links and 3 % more nodes than that from using RouteViews routing tables alone. Our data collection and topology generation process have been automated, and we publish the latest topology on the web on a daily basis. 1...|$|E
40|$|On <b>a</b> <b>recent</b> <b>day,</b> I used {{my credit}} cards in {{connection}} with a number of minor transactions. I made eight purchases, and I paid two credit card bills. I also discarded (without opening) three solicitations for new cards, balance transfer programs, or other similar offers to extend credit via a credit card. Statistics suggest that I am not atypical. U. S. consumers last year used credit cards in about 100 purchasing transactions per capita, with an average value of about $ 70. At the end of the year, Americans owed nearly $ 500 billion dollars, in the range of $ 1, 800 for every man, woman, and child in the population. Although the individual credit card transaction is small and routine, the transactions collectively {{have a significant effect on}} the overall stability of many American families, leading to a rise in consumer borrowing and an increase in bankruptcy filing rates. The crux of the borrowing problem is the relationship between the cardholder and the issuer, which the law relegates almost entirely to the private contractual relationships between those groups. Yet the existing literature has done little to assess the unique contracting problems that those transactions present. That is not to say that scholars. have overlooked credit cards. On the contrary, some scholars have noticed the lengthy fine-print agreements that issuers tender to their cardholders. Thus, credit cards have become a common topic in the boilerplate literature that culminates in the symposium for which this Article is prepared. The branch of that literature focused on consumer contracts explores the extent to which voluminous terms in adhesion contracts become enforceable without the type of voluntary and informed assent on which the paradigm of contract law rests. At the same time, other scholars have become increasingly concerned about the likelihood that cognitive and behavioral limitations restrict the ability of consumers to evaluate borrowing transactions effectively...|$|E

Their strategy {{was based on the}} use of predictors of mortality determined by patients 2 ̆ 7 factors at diagnosis as surrogates for true mortality. On the basis of the Prentice criterion for validity of a surrogate end point, and data from earlier studies of breast cancer case survival, they showed that, not only would the trial require a much shorter follow-up, but also that the information (i. e. inverse variance) for evaluating a treatment effect on mortality would be greater by a factor of nearly 3 if the predictors of mortality were used, compared with a trial in which mortality was actually observed. Although these results are technically correct, we believe that the conceptual strategy on which they are based is flawed, and that the fundamental problem is the Prentice criterion itself. In this paper the technical issues are discussed in detail, and an alternative structure for evaluating the validity of surrogate end points is proposed...|$|R

Writing collaborativley for publication, a companion to a student research journal, has become significant not just for producing a useful resource but as a highly valued space for thinking and discussing teaching and learning.

40|$|In <b>a</b> <b>recent</b> <b>days</b> {{the hotel}} industries, {{coping with the}} change of {{management}} environment swiftly, are turning to pursue the quality-management of service. The merchandises of hotel are fundamentally rooms, food and beverage, and subsidiary facilities. The hotel in modern times, laying stress on service radically, have being endeavored to minimize {{the difference between the}} actual service offered and the expectation of customers on it. Especially because of the essential qualities in hotel, the need of quality-management is demanded to increase. The EFL in hotel is not only the place where the difficulty of producing the merchandise focused on quality is reflected but also the department in which the endeavor of keeping up the service quality and the effective quality-management is demanded. The study on the quality-management, however, is not enough to satisfy the customers and the men engaging in hotels as well as the scholars. The purpose of this study are follows; 1. To disclose the signification of EFL in hotel management through the investigation into the conception, the importance and the character of EFL. 2. To know how to control the human resources to realize the improvement the quality service for customers and the quality-management of EFL in hotel. 3. To search the management and problem of EFL in hotel. Therefore, this study is being concentrating on the effective management of EFL and quality service to visualize the long-term profit in hotel business. Recently the environment around the hotel business is rapidly changing, especially in EFL market plan, and so the quality-management of EFL in hotel is regarded as the strategic enterprise to achieve the abiding improvement and development in hotel industries. Thus, the alternative proposal of EFL in hotel is as follows; First, the EFL in hotel must be focused on offering the individual and differentiated service to induce the positive direction in perceived benefit of the customers psychologically. Second, the EFL in hotel should be aimed to maximize the VAT of hotel in a long-term rather than the statistical profit in a provisional period. Third, to succeed in improving EFL business, it should be necessary for the men engaging in hotel to take the special education, specially in quality service, for the proper education is essential to satisfy the customer 2 ̆ 7 s expectation. Fourth, to satisfy EFL, it is very important for all men engaging in hotel to accept the conception of EFL at the unified mind, it is becoming the center of hotel business. Furthermore, the competition in hotel business is focused not only on quantification but also on qualification. I hope that the various studies on the theme will be continued to develop the hotel industries, focusing on customer 2 ̆ 7 s satisfaction...|$|R

In <b>recent</b> <b>days</b> the high speed wireless technologies are improving day by day {{in the field of}} automation applications. Using these advanced technologies a fast, accurate, new robotic controlling device based on advanced control algorithms are developed. The critical part of the system is the microcontroller unit interfaced to the robotic circuitry; the mechanical movements are monitored and controlled by the micro controller in control circuitry. To detect the live person we are using PIR sensor called as passive infrared sensor which is used to detect the persons whether they are alive or not. The remote uses certain range of Radio frequencies which is used to transfer the commands from the remote to the robot. By using this we can change the directions of the robot. The CPU of the robot is a microcontroller (AT 89 C 52). The power is derived from a set of three 9 V batteries. Locomotion is with the help of two geared motors attached to the chassis. ________________________________________________________________________________________________________ I...|$|R
