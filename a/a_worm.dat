5|$|<b>A</b> <b>worm</b> whose ruleset {{begins with}} 0 {{continues}} {{in a straight line}} forever. This is a trivial case, so it is usually stipulated that the worm must turn when it encounters a point with only uneaten gridlines. Furthermore, to avoid mirror-image symmetrical duplicates, the worm's first turn must be a right hand turn. <b>A</b> <b>worm</b> dies if it returns to its origin a third time, because there are then no untraversed edges available. Only the origin can be lethal to the worm.|$|E
5|$|Electronic Arts' 1983 game Worms? is an {{interactive}} implementation of Paterson's worms, where each time <b>a</b> <b>worm</b> has {{to turn in}} a way that it lacks a rule for, it stops and lets the user choose a direction, which sets that rule for that worm.|$|E
5|$|Each worm {{begins the}} round with a {{specific}} amount of health, which is predefined by the chosen game options or by scripting in campaign levels.

5|$|Animal zodiac: The {{earliest}} {{and most}} complete {{version of the}} animal zodiac mentions twelve animals which differ slightly from the modern version (for instance, the Dragon is absent, represented by <b>a</b> <b>worm).</b> Each animal matches the Earthly Branches and were written on bamboo slips from Shuihudi, dated to the late 4th century BC, {{as well as from}} Fangmatan, dating to the late 3rd century BC. Before these archaeological finds, the Lunheng written by Wang Chong (27– c. 100 AD) during the 1st century provided the earliest transmitted example of a complete duodenary animal cycle.|$|E

To make Chinese Nü Yr, Malliagh first designed the cover art and then developed songs with structures and sound to fit the artwork. Upon release, the EP garnered generally favorable reviews from critics, a common praise being its unique style.|$|E
5|$|Krimibhojana/Krimibhaksha (worm-food): As per the Bhagavata Purana and the Devi Bhagavata Purana, it {{is where}} a person who does not share his food with guests, elders, {{children}} or the gods, and selfishly eats it alone, and he who eats without performing the five yajnas (panchayajna) is chastised. The Vishnu Purana states that one who loathes his father, Brahmins or the gods and who destroys jewels is punished here. This hell is a 100,000 yojana lake filled with worms.

5|$|Paterson's worms are {{a family}} of {{cellular}} automata devised in 1971 by Mike Paterson and John Horton Conway to model the behaviour and feeding patterns of certain prehistoric worms. In the model, <b>a</b> <b>worm</b> moves between points on a triangular grid along line segments, representing food. Its turnings {{are determined by the}} configuration of eaten and uneaten line segments adjacent to {{the point at which the}} worm currently is. Despite being governed by simple rules the behaviour of the worms can be extremely complex, and the ultimate fate of one variant is still unknown.|$|E
5|$|Rain World {{setting is}} {{destroyed}} by ecological catastrophe and illustrated in pixel art.

The player can view a map to check their progress through the large in-game world, and this can help to reach the game's multiple endings.|$|E
5|$|So {{direction}} 0 {{indicates the}} worm continues to travel straight ahead, direction 1 indicates the worm {{will make a}} right turn of 60° and similarly for the other directions. The worm cannot travel in direction 3 {{because that is the}} gridline it has just traversed. Thus <b>a</b> <b>worm</b> with rule {1,0,5,1} decides to travel in direction 1 the first time it has to make a choice, in direction 0 the next time it has to make a choice and so on. If there is only one available gridline, the worm {{has no choice but to}} take it and this is usually not explicitly listed.|$|E

50|$|<b>A</b> tenebrous <b>worm</b> is the {{larval form}} of the gloomwing. <b>A</b> tenebrous <b>worm</b> is <b>an</b> insectoid {{predator}} that inhabits the Plane of Shadows, and seeks warm-blooded prey. <b>A</b> tenebrous <b>worm's</b> head is equipped with powerful mandibles that drip a highly caustic acid secreted from glands located behind the creature's multi-faceted eyes. <b>A</b> tenebrous <b>worm</b> looks like <b>a</b> huge, partially bare caterpillar.

The many facets of the creature's eyes reflect the half-light of the Plane of Shadows with a luminous gillmer. This glimmer is the only warning of <b>a</b> tenebrous <b>worm's</b> presence.

5|$|After Sunday Night Heat, the {{pay-per-view}} {{began with}} a handicap match- a tag team match in which a team of two wrestlers face a team of three. WWE Tag Team Champions Rikishi and Scotty 2 Hotty defended their titles against The Basham Brothers (Doug and Danny Basham) and Shaniqua. During the match Hotty attempted <b>a</b> <b>worm</b> on Shaniqua, but Shaniqua countered by clotheslining Hotty. The challengers had the advantage until Hotty clotheslined the Bashams, causing them to flip over the top ring rope and into ringside. Afterwards, Rikishi delivered a Samoan drop. Rikishi then covered Shaniqua to retain the championships. Next was a Singles match, in which Jamie Noble was blindfolded as he faced his storyline girlfriend Nidia. Nidia would take advantage of Noble's inability to see by performing antics that caused him to fall. Eventually, Noble was able to apply the guillotine choke on Nidia. Noble won the match after he forced her to submit with this move.|$|E
5|$|The strong odor {{associated}} with marsh shrews (in common with other long-tailed shrews) {{may be a}} means of communication. Similar to other shrews, they have poor eyesight. If a marsh shrew is placed in a foreign environment (such as along an edge of a raised surface), it will run off the edge and continue to run after landing on the surface below. Landing in water, it dives beneath the surface. Marsh shrews are easily trapped in sunken cans, possibly due to their inability {{to see where the}} edges of surfaces drop. In captivity they vocalize when they are displaced or scuffle with other animals in their cage, twittering shrilly if disturbed while eating or in a confrontation over food (such as <b>a</b> <b>worm).</b> Although it is uncertain whether marsh shrews cache (or hoard) food in the wild, in captivity they set aside nightcrawlers {{in a corner of the}} cage for later consumption; no other food items were set aside in this fashion.|$|E

The Harvester on the ground has four scouting ornithopters patrolling around it watching for wormsign — the motions of sand indicating that <b>a</b> <b>worm</b> is coming. Melange is collected from the open sand until <b>a</b> <b>worm</b> is close, at which time the Carryall lifts the Harvester to safety.
