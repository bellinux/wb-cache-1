5|$|In 1844, the community, perpetually {{struggling}} financially, drafted {{an entirely}} new constitution <b>and</b> <b>committed</b> <b>to</b> following more closely the Fourierist model.

Ripley himself became a celebrity proponent of Fourierism and organized conventions throughout New England to discuss the community.|$|E
5|$|L.A.P.D. {{formed in}} Bakersfield, California, in 1989. The band was started with Richard Morrill, James Shaffer, and Reginald Arvizu. With both guitarist and bass guitar {{positions}} filled, {{there was still}} a need for a lead vocalist, as well as a percussionist. The group asked Pete Capra to join their band. Capra joined the band and was positioned as lead vocalist. Although he had not been a vocalist for other bands, Capra introduced the group to bands like the Red Hot Chili Peppers and Faith No More. The group was inspired by the bands that Capra had shown them, <b>and</b> <b>committed</b> <b>to</b> head into those band's genres and style.|$|E

After his senior year at St. George's, Rolle transferred to the Laurinburg Institute in North Carolina, where he was an integral part in leading the team to an undefeated record and the national prep school championship.

5|$|The Spratly Islands are disputed by {{many states}} in the area, and {{a large portion of}} the South China Sea is claimed by China. Unlike its {{neighbours}} of Vietnam and the Philippines, Malaysia historically avoided conflicts with China. However, after the enroachment of Chinese ships in Malaysian territorial waters, Malaysia has become active in condemning China. Brunei and Malaysia in 2009 announced an end to claims of each other's land, <b>and</b> <b>committed</b> <b>to</b> resolve issues related to their maritime borders. The Philippines has a dormant claim to the eastern part of Sabah. Singapore's land reclamation has caused tensions, and minor maritime and land border disputes exist with Indonesia.|$|E

5|$|During Victoria's first {{pregnancy}} in 1840, in {{the first}} few months of the marriage, 18-year-old Edward Oxford attempted to assassinate her while she was riding in a carriage with Prince Albert on her way to visit her mother. Oxford fired twice, but either both bullets missed or, as he later claimed, the guns had no shot. He was tried for high treason, found not guilty on the grounds of insanity, <b>and</b> <b>committed</b> <b>to</b> an insane asylum indefinitely. In the immediate aftermath of the attack, Victoria's popularity soared, mitigating residual discontent over the Hastings affair and the bedchamber crisis. Her daughter, also named Victoria, was born on 21 November 1840. The Queen hated being pregnant, viewed breast-feeding with disgust, and thought newborn babies were ugly. Nevertheless, over the following seventeen years, she and Albert had a further eight children: Albert Edward, Prince of Wales (b. 1841), Alice (b. 1843), Alfred (b. 1844), Helena (b. 1846), Louise (b. 1848), Arthur (b. 1850), Leopold (b. 1853) and Beatrice (b. 1857).|$|E
5|$|Following further {{speculation}} {{over her}} leadership, on 26 June a rumour emerged that supporters of Kevin Rudd were collecting signatures for a letter demanding an immediate leadership vote. That afternoon, before any letter had been published, Gillard called a leadership spill live on television. She challenged any would-be opponent {{to join her}} in a pledge that, while the winner would become leader, the loser would immediately retire from politics. Despite his earlier comments {{that he would not}} return to the leadership under any circumstances, Kevin Rudd announced that he would challenge Gillard for the leadership, <b>and</b> <b>committed</b> <b>to</b> retiring from politics if he lost. In the party-room ballot later that evening, Rudd defeated Gillard by a margin of 57 votes to 45.|$|E
5|$|Much of {{the album}} had been {{composed}} <b>and</b> <b>committed</b> <b>to</b> demo form before the band arrived at Rundgren's studio, but the producer felt that the first crop was insufficient. He expected a full working album worth of songs to be ready, whereas the Furs believed that their creative process had always flourished best inside a studio. He postponed recording while the Furs made additional demos. British keyboardist and future music producer Ed Buller helped to create many of the demos made before the band returned. Although never an official member of the Furs, Buller supplied much-needed musical accompaniment at this stage, and {{would go on to}} collaborate frequently with the band over the next six years. When the second batch arrived, Rundgren made major revisions and even dropped some tracks entirely. By necessity then, some songs were revised or fully composed in the studio.|$|E

5|$|Before either Baltic legion could {{complete}} training, {{these developments}} were overtaken by heavy casualties {{suffered by the}} West European legions on the Eastern Front, and like the West European legions, {{it was decided to}} combine the Baltic legions into larger formations. This resulted in the Estnische SS-Freiwilligen Brigade, consisting of the Estonian Legion and elements of the 1st SS Infantry Brigade, and the Lettische SS-Freiwilligen Brigade, formed around the Latvian Legion and parts of the 2nd SS Infantry Brigade. The origins of many of the men of the two SS infantry brigades was Reich German or Volksdeutsche, so these two formations were never purely Baltic. Not long after the two new volunteer brigades had been formed <b>and</b> <b>committed</b> <b>to</b> battle, they were upgraded to divisional status, and a third Baltic division was authorised, using the manpower of the Latvian security battalions. To man and maintain these three new divisions, Himmler ordered the conscription of Estonian and Latvian men, and made all former Estonian Army officers and non-commissioned officers liable for service. By 1944, the Waffen-SS included the three divisions, namely; the 15th Waffen Grenadier Division of the SS (1st Latvian), the 19th Waffen Grenadier Division of the SS (2nd Latvian), and the 20th Waffen Grenadier Division of the SS (1st Estonian). The two Latvian divisions were later combined into the VI SS Army Corps (Latvian), and all three divisions fought the Soviet Red Army in defence of their homelands during 1944, and were encircled there or destroyed in subsequent fighting elsewhere.|$|E
