40|$|Total and wetmineral <b>dust</b> <b>deposition</b> has beenmonitored since 2006 {{at three}} Sahelian {{stations}} in Senegal, Mali, and Niger, respectively at the weekly and the event time scale. Average annual deposited mass fluxes range from 75 to 183 gm(- 2) yr(- 1), from west to east. Deposition fluxes exhibit a clear seasonal cycle in Mali and Niger. High wet deposition fluxes result from an optimum phasing between <b>dust</b> <b>concentration</b> and precipitation: the maximum occurring {{at the beginning}} of the wet season, after the maximum of <b>dust</b> <b>concentration</b> and before the precipitation maximum. The contribution of wet to total deposition varies from 67 % in Mali to 8 % in Senegal. It is the main factor of variability of the deposition fluxes from year to year and at the seasonal scale in Niger and Mali. Wet deposition fluxes in Mali and Niger are mainly due to the wash out of dust emitted by convective systems. In Senegal, the deposition fluxes are lower and dominated by dry deposition (92 % of the annual deposition flux). This is due to the low occurrence of convective systems producing local dust emissions and intense wet deposition. The dry deposition fluxes are primarily driven by the variability of the <b>dust</b> <b>concentration.</b> The dry <b>deposition</b> velocities derived from our measurements are consistent with those estimated by theoretical models. Scavenging ratios computed from the measured wet <b>deposition</b> fluxes, <b>dust</b> <b>concentrations,</b> and precipitation are anticorrelated with precipitation amounts. This suggests that most of the atmospheric dust is scavenged at the very beginning of the precipitation events...|$|R

Here we characterize the age and composition of Patagonian glacial outwash sediments, to assess the relationship between the Antarctic dust record from Dome C (refs 9, 13) and Patagonian glacial fluctuations(14 - 16) for the past 80, 000 years. We show that dust peaks in Antarctica coincide with periods in Patagonia when rivers of glacial meltwater deposited sediment directly onto easily mobilized outwash plains. No dust peaks were noted when the glaciers instead terminated directly into pro-glacial lakes. We thus propose that the variable sediment supply resulting from Patagonian glacial fluctuations may have acted as an on/off switch for Antarctic <b>dust</b> <b>deposition.</b> At the last glacial termination, Patagonian glaciers quickly retreated into lakes, which may help explain why the deglacial decline in Antarctic <b>dust</b> <b>concentrations</b> preceded the main phase of warming, sea-level rise and reduction in Southern Hemisphere sea-ice extent(13) ...|$|R
40|$|Measuring <b>dust</b> <b>deposition</b> and {{generation}} {{rates is}} important for both its fundamental physics {{and the application of}} indoor air quality control. These measurements are very difficult to conduct directly in occupied livestock buildings. Two indirect methods were developed for the measurement of both deposition and generation rates under steady-state conditions and unsteady-state conditions respectively. A new mathematical model of particle size distribution was also developed for swine building dust. Based on the mass balance equation for a typical well mixed ventilation space, the nonlinear mathematical solutions were derived. For steady-state conditions, a transformation was employed to the nonlinear solution so the linear model was obtained. Then the sequential parameter estimation method was developed to estimate both <b>dust</b> <b>deposition</b> and generation rates. The input data were airborne <b>dust</b> <b>concentrations</b> versus filtration efficiency. This steady-state method actually converted the difficult measurements of <b>dust</b> <b>deposition</b> and generation rates into the simple measurements of <b>dust</b> <b>concentrations</b> versus filtration efficiency. For unsteady-state conditions, the nonlinear parameter estimation technique was employed to estimate the unknown parameters in the solution of the model. The input variable to this model was <b>dust</b> <b>concentration</b> versus time. The estimated unknowns were <b>dust</b> <b>deposition</b> and generation rates. This unsteady-state method actually converted the difficult measurements of <b>dust</b> <b>deposition</b> and generation rates into the simple measurements of <b>dust</b> <b>concentration</b> versus time. For the validation of the steady-state method, two sets (six sub-sets) of steady-state condition experiments were conducted in the laboratory and the data were compared to computer simulations. Three experiments were conducted to validate the unsteady-state method. The proposed methods were also tested using data from Gao and Feddes (1992) for steady-state conditions, and from Wadden and Scheff (1983) for unsteady-state conditions, respectively...|$|R
40|$|<b>Deposition</b> of {{airborne}} <b>dust</b> on outdoor photovoltaic (PV) modules may decrease the transmittance of solar cell glazing and cause a significant degradation of solar conversion efficiency of PV modules. Previous studies {{of this issue}} indicated that <b>dust</b> <b>deposition</b> {{is closely related to}} the tilt angle of solar collector, exposure period, site climate conditions, wind movement and dust properties. However, few studies considered the influence of the properties of PV module itself on <b>dust</b> <b>deposition</b> and efficiency degradation, such as the cell types and surface materials. This experimental work aimed to study the dust accumulation onto different types of solar PV modules and the corresponding efficiency degradation. The experiment was designed and conducted in the laboratory with a sun simulator and a test chamber. The degradation of PV module efficiency caused by <b>dust</b> <b>deposition</b> under various conditions was investigated. The results indicated that dust pollution has a significant impact on PV module output. With <b>dust</b> <b>deposition</b> density increasing from 0 to 22 g m - 2, the corresponding reduction of PV output efficiency grew from 0 to 26 %. The reduction of efficiency has a linear relationship with the <b>dust</b> <b>deposition</b> density, and the difference caused by cell types was not obvious. When the <b>dust</b> <b>deposition</b> density was fixed, the reductions of output efficiency at relatively lower or higher solar densities were much more severe.

40|$|<b>Dust</b> <b>deposition</b> {{is a key}} {{component}} of the dust cycle in the Earth system. The lack of understanding for the mechanisms of <b>dust</b> <b>deposition</b> has been a major bottle neck {{to the development of the}} dust-related research field. The focus of this study is to obtain data for <b>dust</b> dry <b>deposition,</b> to validate the existing <b>dust</b> <b>deposition</b> schemes and to improve the parameterization for <b>dust</b> <b>deposition</b> processes. A series of <b>dust</b> <b>deposition</b> experiments are carried out in a wind-tunnel laboratory. A laser-based PDPA (Phase Doppler Particle Analyzer) technique is employed to measure the velocity and size of the dust particles which pass through the sampling area. <b>Dust</b> <b>concentration</b> is measured using an Aerosol Spectrometer and wind and turbulence are measured using a sonic anemometer and other conventional wind-tunnel instruments. A new method for processing the data is proposed. The PDPA data are used to derive the <b>dust</b> <b>deposition</b> velocity for different particle sizes and wind and surface conditions. A reliable dataset is obtained through the wind-tunnel experiments, which are then used to validate two representative <b>dust</b> <b>deposition</b> schemes, the Slinn and Slinn (1980) scheme for smooth surfaces and the Slinn (1982) scheme for vegetation canopies. It is found that the schemes tend to underestimate <b>dust</b> <b>deposition</b> velocity, especially for rough surfaces. The effect of interception is seriously underestimated in the schemes. A new <b>dust</b> <b>deposition</b> scheme is proposed in this study. The relationship between <b>dust</b> <b>deposition</b> and momentum depletion is established. The drag partition theory including the surface parameterization method is introduced to describe <b>dust</b> <b>deposition.</b> The improved scheme is suitable for both rough and smooth surfaces. The predictions of the new scheme are found to agree well with the experimental data. By sensitivity analysis, it is found that the newly introduced surface parameter, element frontal area index, has a predominant effect on surface collection efficiency and influences the deposition of particles of all sizes. ...|$|R

40|$|AbstractMountain snowpacks are a vital natural {{resource}} for ∼ 1. 5 billion {{people in the}} northern Hemisphere, helping to meet human and ecological demand for water in excess of that provided by summer rain. Springtime warming and aeolian <b>dust</b> <b>deposition</b> accelerate snowmelt, increasing the risk of water shortages during late summer, when demand is greatest. While climate networks provide data {{that can be used}} to evaluate the effect of warming on snowpack resources, there are no established regional networks for monitoring aeolian <b>dust</b> <b>deposition</b> to snow. In this study, we test the hypothesis that chemistry of snow, wet deposition, and aerosols can be used as a surrogate for <b>dust</b> <b>deposition</b> to snow. We then analyze spatial patterns and temporal trends in inferred springtime <b>dust</b> <b>deposition</b> to snow across the Rocky Mountains, USA, for 1993 – 2014. Geochemical evidence, including strong correlations (r 2  ≥  0. 94) between Ca 2 +, alkalinity, and <b>dust</b> <b>concentrations</b> in snow deposited during dust events, indicate that carbonate minerals in dust impart a strong chemical signature {{that can be used to}} track <b>dust</b> <b>deposition</b> to snow. Spatial patterns in chemistry of snow, wet deposition, and aerosols indicate that <b>dust</b> <b>deposition</b> increases from north to south in the Rocky Mountains, and temporal trends indicate that winter/spring <b>dust</b> <b>deposition</b> increased by 81 % in the southern Rockies during 1993 – 2014. Using a multivariate modeling approach, we determined that increases in <b>dust</b> <b>deposition</b> and decreases in springtime snowfall combined to accelerate snowmelt timing in the southern Rockies by approximately 7 – 18 days between 1993 and 2014. Previous studies have shown that aeolian dust emissions may have doubled globally during the 20 th century, possibly due to drought and land-use change. Climate projections for increased aridity in the southwestern U.

East Asian deserts are the dominant source area for dust transported to Greenland. The <b>concentration</b> of <b>dust</b> is low during warm periods while cold phases correspond to high particle concentration. Regarding the size distribution, larger particles were found during colder climates and vice versa. The variability of <b>dust</b> <b>concentrations</b> in Greenlandic ice cores {{is due to}} changes both during transport and in the dust sources. Dust size spectra provide information on transport time changes in the past with larger particles surviving only during faster transport. Further investigations regarding a seasonal resolution of <b>dust</b> <b>deposition</b> and <b>dust</b> size data are in progress. The aim of the project is to study the <b>dust</b> <b>deposition</b> in seasonal-to-interannual resolution using <b>dust</b> <b>concentration</b> and size measurements on selected time slices in the NorthGRIP ice core covering the period approximately from 50000 yr BP until 2000 yr BP.

40|$|This study simulates how spatial {{variations}} in particle-size emissions from a playa affect bulk and size-resolved <b>dust</b> <b>concentration</b> profiles during two contrasting wind erosion events (a small local {{and a large}} regional event) in the Channel Country, Lake Eyre Basin, Australia. The regional event had higher <b>dust</b> <b>concentration</b> {{as a result of}} stronger frontal winds and higher erodibility across the playa. For each event, two emission scenarios are simulated to determine if measured size-resolved <b>dust</b> <b>concentration</b> profiles can be explained by spatial variability in source area emissions. The first scenario assumes that particle-size emissions from source areas occur at a uniform rate, while the second scenario assumes that particle-size emissions vary between and within source areas. The uniform emission scenario, reproduced measured bulk <b>dust</b> <b>concentration</b> profiles (R 2 = 0 93 regional and R 2 = 0 81 local), however simulated size-resolved <b>dust</b> <b>concentration</b> profiles had poor statistical fits to measured size-resolved profiles for each size class (the highest were R 2 = 0 5 regional and R 2 = 0 3 local). For the differential particle-size emission scenario, the fit to the measured bulk <b>dust</b> <b>concentration</b> profiles is improved (R 2 = 0 97 regional and R 2 = 0 83 local). However, the fit to the size-resolved profiles improved dramatically, with the lowest being R 2 = 0 89 (regional) and R 2 = 0 80 (local). Particle-size emission models should therefore be tested against both bulk and size-resolved <b>dust</b> <b>concentration</b> profiles, since if only bulk <b>dust</b> <b>concentration</b> profiles are used model performance may be over-stated.

Between this threshold and pH ~ 7. 1, dissolved Fe fell to a minimum but above this pH further dissolution of iron occurs, {{probably due to the}} formation of soluble ferrates. At our lowest <b>dust</b> <b>concentrations</b> (1 - 20 mg L- 1) the rate of Fe extraction at low pH was constant, while at higher <b>dust</b> <b>concentrations</b> the rate was inversely proportional to <b>dust</b> <b>concentration.</b> Dissolution of iron from dust is thus a complex process and these factors must be considered when modelling the input of iron to the oceans.

30|$|The {{simulated}} <b>dust</b> <b>concentration</b> at {{the boiler}} outlet was 4.5 g/Nm 3 at 12 % CO 2. This is {{in agreement with}} the results reported in the literature. For wood-fired boilers, Buonicore and Davis [18] reported a value of 3, 000 mg/Nm 3, whilst De Kock and Yap [19] reported that the boiler flue gas dust loads varied from 1490 to 4300 mg/Nm 3. These results were not corrected for carbon dioxide; hence, the dust load could have been higher after 12 % CO 2 correction. Furthermore, it can be seen from Figure 3 that even a small difference in dust collection efficiency can make a significant difference in <b>dust</b> <b>concentration.</b> For example, at 95 % efficiency, the <b>dust</b> <b>concentration</b> is 0.225 g/Nm 3, whereas at 90 % efficiency, which is lower, the <b>dust</b> <b>concentration</b> is 0.450 g/Nm 3. The latter result will not comply with the Clean Air Regulation of 1978 at 0.4 g/Nm 3.|$|R
40|$|The {{international}} {{concern on}} the inhalable fine dust {{is continuing to}} increase. In addition to the toxic properties of the fine dust itself, it can be more dangerous than other environmental factors since the dust pollution is hard to be detected by human sense. Although the information on outdoor air condition can be acquired easily, the indoor <b>dust</b> <b>concentration</b> is another problem because the indoor air condition {{is influenced by the}} architectural environment and human activity. It means occupants may be exposed to indoor dust pollution over a long period without being aware. Therefore the indoor <b>dust</b> <b>concentration</b> should be measured separately and visualized as an intuitive information. By visualizing, the indoor <b>dust</b> <b>concentration</b> in each space can be recognized practically in compare with the degree of pollution in adjacent spaces. Besides the visualization outcome can be used as base data for related research such as an analysis of the relation between indoor <b>dust</b> <b>concentration</b> and architectural environment. Meanwhile, with the development of network and micro sensing devices, it became possible to collect wide range of indoor environment data. In this regards, this paper suggests a system for visualization of indoor <b>dust</b> <b>concentration</b> and demonstrates it on an actual space. ? ??? 2013 ? ????? ????? ???? ?????

40|$|The {{issue of}} odour, {{greenhouse}} gas emissions and indoor air quality in swine buildings have become a great concern for the neighbouring communities as well as governments. Air dispersion models have been adopted widely as an approach to address these problems which determine science-based distance between livestock production site and neighbours. However, no existing model considers the diurnal and seasonal variations of odour, gas (ammonia, hydrogen sulphide, greenhouse gas), and <b>dust</b> <b>concentrations</b> and emissions, which may cause great uncertainty. The primary objective of this project is to monitor and model the diurnal and seasonal variations of odour, gases, and <b>dust</b> <b>concentrations</b> and emissions from nursery, farrowing, and gestation rooms. Additionally, this study tried to quantify the greenhouse gas contribution from swine buildings and evaluate the indoor air quality of swine barns. Strip-block experimental design {{was used to measure}} the diurnal variation of odour and gas concentrations and emissions in PSC Elstow Research Farm. It was found that: 1) odour and gas concentrations in winter were significantly higher than those in mild and warm weather conditions for all three rooms (P 0. 05); 3) significant diurnal variations occurred in August and April (P 0. 05); 4) apparent diurnal variation patterns were observed in August and April for NH 3, H 2 S and CO 2 concentrations, being high in the early morning and low in the late afternoon; 5) positive correlation was found between odour concentrations and NH 3, H 2 S, and CO 2 concentrations, respectively. A whole year (August 2006 to July 2007) monitoring of odour, gas and <b>dust</b> <b>concentrations</b> and emissions revealed that: 1) significant seasonal effect on odour and gas concentrations and emissions, total <b>dust</b> <b>concentrations</b> and <b>dust</b> <b>depositions</b> were observed (...|$|R

40|$|The {{study was}} carried out in a {{farrowing}} pen during 6 production cycles of 24 days in the spring-summer period. The effect of season and other microclimate parameters on airborne <b>dust</b> <b>concentration</b> was investigated. Study results showed a decrease in airborne <b>dust</b> <b>concentration</b> in summer period that yielded negative correlation with air temperature (P< 0. 05). Relative humidity was expected to decrease due to higher ventilation rates, however, a significant increase was recorded in summer (P< 0. 05) because of higher evaporation caused by floor wash. The decrease in airborne <b>dust</b> <b>concentration</b> was ascribed to temperature elevation due to intensified ventilation rate and relative humidity resulting in higher rate of dust settling...|$|R
40|$|The {{effect of}} rock {{fragment}} eccentricity on the <b>deposition</b> of airborne <b>dust</b> was examined in a wind tunnel. Eccentricity {{was defined as}} the ratio a/b, where a is the longest and b the intermediate axis of the rock fragments. The effect of eccentricity on the <b>deposition</b> of <b>dust</b> on the pebbles, on the <b>deposition</b> of <b>dust</b> between and underneath the pebbles, and on total <b>dust</b> <b>deposition</b> (pebbles + interpebble space) was measured separately, and this for different values of pebble size, pebble flattening, cover density and wind speed. The more pebbles are elongated, the larger <b>dust</b> <b>deposition</b> on them will be. This effect is more pronounced as pebbles become larger, as they become less flattened, and as wind speed increases, but no correlation is observed with cover density. It also holds that the more pebbles are elongated, the less dust settles between and underneath them. This effect is more pronounced as pebbles become smaller and cover density becomes larger, but there is no relationship with pebble flattening. Whether or not there is a relationship with wind speed is unclear. Pebble eccentricity indirectly influences total <b>dust</b> <b>deposition</b> on a pebble field, since it determines whether or not (and to what extent) total <b>dust</b> <b>deposition</b> will be a function of pebble size. For circular pebbles, total <b>dust</b> <b>deposition</b> is independent of pebble size, but once pebbles become elongated, total <b>dust</b> <b>deposition</b> will be smaller on pebble fields composed of small pebbles than on pebble fields composed of large pebbles. It was also demonstrated that the more pebbles are elongated, the more the dust will tend to settle on the pebbles rather than between or underneath them. Air flow separation plays a primary role in the <b>deposition</b> of <b>dust</b> on a rock fragment field, since it determines the location and size of the low-sedimentation areas that are connected to the air flow separation bubbles. Highly-elongated pebbles oriented parallel to the wind catch much more dust (also per unit surface) than circular pebbles, the surface of which is largely located in a zone of very low <b>deposition.</b> <b>Dust</b> <b>deposition</b> density on highly-elongated pebbles normal to the wind, on the contrary, is equal to <b>dust</b> <b>deposition</b> on circular pebbles. It should be noted that all data in this study refer to initial <b>dust</b> <b>deposition</b> (not accumulation), since only wind velocities below the dust deflation threshold were tested. status: publishe...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: To report {{findings}} on ventilatory function and estimations of concentrations of personal breathing zone dust in Lancashire textile weavers. Weaving room dust {{is considered to}} be less harmful than that encountered in the cardroom or spinning room and weavers are generally thought to have less respiratory disability than carders or spinners. However, this occupational group has not been extensively studied. METHODS: Each person was given a respiratory symptom questionnaire (modified Medical Research Council, UK, questionnaire on respiratory diseases). Ventilatory function tests, forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV 1) and forced vital capacity (FVC) were performed on each person. A representative sample of workers from each occupational group underwent dust sampling in their personal breathing zone. <b>Dust</b> <b>concentrations</b> and ventilatory tests were analysed statistically with the Student's t test, Pearson's correlation coefficient, and forward step regression for relations with symptoms and environmental factors. Significance was p > or = 0. 05. RESULTS: The FEV 1 and FVC were reduced in workers with respiratory symptoms (non-specific chest tightness, shortness of breath, persistent cough, and wheezing) as well as in preparation room workers, current and former smokers, Asians, those working with predominantly cotton fibre (> 50 % cotton) and starch size. Mean total <b>dust</b> <b>concentration</b> (pd 1) in the personal breathing zone was 1. 98 mg/m 3. The corresponding value for total dust with large fibres lifted off the filter paper (pd 2) was 1. 55 mg/m 3. There was a strong correlation (r = 0. 94, p < 0. 0001) between pd 1 and pd 2. Non-specific chest tightness was predicted by low <b>dust</b> <b>concentrations</b> and persistent cough by high <b>dust</b> <b>concentrations.</b> On regression analysis, impairment of ventilatory function (FEV 1, FVC) was predicted by smoking, male sex, age, not working in the weaving shed, not being white, and personal <b>dust</b> <b>concentrations.</b> CONCLUSIONS: The FEV 1 and FVC were impaired in smokers and those exposed to high <b>dust</b> <b>concentrations</b> in the personal breathing zone. Symptoms were inconsistently related to <b>dust</b> <b>concentrations</b> in the personal breathing zone...|$|R
40|$|The {{application}} of different mechanical extraction ventilation systems in reducing and controlling <b>dust</b> <b>concentrations</b> in weaned and finishing pig houses was analyzed and {{discussed in this}} work. <b>Dust</b> <b>concentrations</b> and airflow velocities have been measured at 20 measuring points, smoothly positioned over the house cross section, in the net consisting of 4 horizontal and 5 vertical rows. The lowest horizontal row was positioned at the pigs breathing zone (40 cm above the floor), and the highest (fourth) horizontal row was positioned at the workers breathing zone (160 cm). Control values were measured in houses with closed doors and windows and all the fans switched off. These values were compared with three experimental sets of values achieved with: floor, roof and both ventilation systems. <b>Dust</b> <b>concentrations</b> were measured by konimeter (Konimeter 10, Karl Zeiss Jena), airflow velocity in ventilation ducts with a turbine anemometer and the airflow velocity at measuring points with hot wire anemometer.

40|$|Spatial and {{temporal}} variations in vegetation and soil surface conditions of rangelands add {{a level of}} complexity to wind erosion processes which {{is often difficult to}} model or measure. Butler and colleagues have developed a methodology which combines computer simulation and experimental measurement to analyse how spatial {{and temporal}} changes in dust source area emission rates and atmospheric conditions affect vertical <b>dust</b> <b>concentration</b> profiles during wind erosion events in the Queensland Channel Country. This methodology has not, however, taken into account how variations in dust source area particle-size can affect vertical <b>dust</b> <b>concentration</b> profiles. The present paper examines how the particle-size characteristics of dust source soils affect both vertical <b>dust</b> <b>concentration</b> profiles and the vertical distribution of particle-sizes in two contrasting wind erosion events in the Queensland Channel Country. Comparisons are made between computer simulations of these events and the results of field measurements (of vertical <b>dust</b> <b>concentration</b> profiles) and laboratory measurements (of dust particle-size). Computer simulations of the particle-size emissions from the different dust source areas during the two events produce vertical distributions of dust particle-sizes which are similar to the measured dust particle-sizes for these events. These results indicate that erodibility-induced spatial and temporal variations in particle-size emissions of dust source areas have important influences upon: dust fluxes, vertical <b>dust</b> <b>concentration</b> profiles and the vertical distribution of dust particle-sizes within these profile...|$|R
