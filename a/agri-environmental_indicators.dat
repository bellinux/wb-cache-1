40|$|<b>Agri-environmental</b> <b>indicators</b> are {{a useful}} tool for {{analysis}} of the connection between agriculture and environment and identifying developments in this intensive interaction. Such indicators should consequently help to accomplish {{a better understanding of the}} complex issues in the field of agriculture and environment, to show developments over time, and to provide quantitative information. In order to help the improvement of environmental performance of agriculture, Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) has established a set of <b>agri-environmental</b> <b>indicators,</b> developed in co-operation with Eurostat and Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO). These indicators inform policy makers and society on the state and trends in agri-environmental conditions, and can provide a valuable aid to policy analysis. Currently, there is a deficiency of continuous monitoring of indicators connected to the impact of agriculture on the ecosystems and environment in Republic Macedonia. A development and continuous monitoring of applicable <b>agri-environmental</b> <b>indicators</b> is a key of valuation of the impact of agriculture on environment. Therefore, this paper will give an overview of current data and state of <b>agri-environmental</b> <b>indicators</b> in Republic of Macedonia and accordingly an analysis and evaluation of the sustainable development in the country. ...|$|E

In order to analyze production systems at the entire farm scale, nitrogen balances and other <b>agri-environmental</b> <b>indicators</b> were assessed on 32 organic and conventional farms in Northern Germany. On organic farms, nitrogen fixation of legumes was determined on representative fields. Irrespective of the specialization (all-arable farms, dairy farms), nitrogen surpluses were always pronouncedly lower on organic farms compared to conventional farms.

40|$|This study elaborates {{the dynamic}} {{nutrient}} balance model and applies it to analyze nitrogen use and nitrogen efficiency in agriculture. We use publicly available agricultural production data {{to estimate the}} net inflows, stocks and outflows of nitrogen for 14 European countries in years 1961 – 2009. The dynamic model allows us to analyze the trends in the nitrogen stocks and flows over time, and break down the total outflow of nitrogen into flows to water, air and soil. We argue that the nitrogen outflow, modeled as the decay of nitrogen stock, provides a more reliable and robust <b>agri-environmental</b> <b>indicator</b> than the conventional nutrient balance. Mathematically, the nutrient balance is an interval scale measure, whereas the nitrogen stock and the outflow from stock are ratio scale measures. Nitrogen efficiencies, calculated based on the nitrogen stocks, provide useful and insightful information beyond the conventional eco-efficiency measures defined from the nitrogen balances.

40|$|Nitrogen (N) balance {{has been}} {{identified}} as a principal <b>agri-environmental</b> <b>indicator.</b> In addition to national N balances, calculation of N balances for different agricultural regions is also recommended. In this study, national and regional net N balances for Finland were calculated. The net N balance is the result of deducting the NH 3 -N losses from manure and fertilisers from the gross N balance. The N balance calculation was based on data for Finnish Rural Centres and calculated per cultivated hectare. The main data inputs for the calculations were agricultural and environmental statistics, coefficients of manure excretion and crop N concentrations. Finnish national net N balance decreased from 90 kg ha 1 in 1990 to 50 kg ha 1 in 2005. The decrease in regional N balances was of the same magnitude. The main reason for the lower N balances was reduced use of mineral N fertilisers. Variation in the N balances was due to yield levels varying according to growing season conditions. The Rural Centres with intensive animal production tended to generate the highest N balances. ...|$|R
40|$|Oil palm {{cultivation}} area {{is expected}} to increase until at least 2050. This expansion raises environmental concerns, not only regarding land-use change and its consequences, but also concerning potential impacts of losses of nitrogen such as ammonia volatilisation, nitrous oxide emission and nitrate leaching and runoff. The prerequisite to any work on the reduction of losses and identification of best practices is the development of an assessment tool. However, the available knowledge regarding nitrogen losses is limited for oil palm, which leads to high uncertainty in environmental assessment. In this context, we chose to develop an <b>agri-environmental</b> <b>indicator,</b> IN-Palm, which aims at estimating the risk of nitrogen losses in oil palm plantations, using the INDIGO® method. This kind of operational model is built to assess environmental risks as well as being used as a decision support tool. The development of indicators is particularly relevant in such contexts of data scarcity, as it allows for harnessing the most of readily accessible data from a whole range of sources, i. e. measured or modelled, qualitative or quantitative, empirical or expert knowledge. We adapted the indicator to characteristics of the oil palm system, such as the tropical climate, the long growth cycle of about 25 years and the high production of biomass. We designed it to be easily implementable with available data on climate and soil conditions, and sensitive to practices such as fertiliser application (type, rate and timing), legume cover establishment, and residue management. Future work will include a sensitivity analysis, a validation against experimental data of losses in Sumatra, and a validation by end-users in a plantation in Sumatra...|$|R

40|$|In many {{countries}} farmland represent {{the most relevant}} type of land use. The conservation and the enhancement of biodiversity within these areas is primary objective for the achievement of sustainable management of agro-ecosystems {{and the level of}} biodiversity can be used as <b>agri-environmental</b> <b>indicator.</b> The measure of biodiversity over larger territories however, can be very expensive and time consuming. Earth observations have a rich history in characterizing and monitoring biodiversity and ecosystems. The possibility to use remotely sensed data for monitoring biodiversity was identified at the dawn of Earth observations and has been widely used for decades. Remotely sensed data can cost-effectively track changes in ecosystem distribution and status. The new generation of high-spatial and spectral resolution offers more hope for more direct monitoring of habitats and species. Recent developments in satellite remote sensing and in geographic information system (GIS) combined with user oriented computer programs allow us to use ecological principles for biodiversity characterization at landscape level more efficiently. This paper presents an approach for biodiversity characterization at landscape level using geospatial techniques. The present study hypothesizes that the complexity of the landscape is related to biological phytodiversity, and in turn phytodiversity can be considered a proxy of the overall biodiversity. The aim of the study is to estimate the farmland landscape complexity by using a remote sensing based approach. The approach has been validated in a Northern Italian agricultural area (Emilia-Romagna region). The proposed approach can provide policy makers and land use planners valuable, updated and low cost information on farmland landscape complexity and an estimate of its biodiversity. JRC. DDG.

40|$|Farmland {{abandonment}} (FLA) can {{be defined}} as the cessation of agricultural activities on a given surface of land and not taken by another activity (such as urbanisation or afforestation). This process attracts the attention of policy-makers both at national and EU level, in particular {{within the context of the}} Rural Development Policy. And, considering its importance in environmental and socio-economic terms, it is necessary to better understand the geographic distribution and strength of farmland abandonment trends in the EU- 27, and to develop indicators to identify the most important farmland abandonment tendencies. The first aim of this study was to establish the state of the art concerning farmland abandonment (definition, type) and methodologies for identifying/quantifying this phenomenon (dataset, period of analysis, scale). Then, it was about contributing to a new definition of Less Favoured Areas by assessing the driving forces of farmland abandonment and preparing the guidelines for <b>agri-environmental</b> <b>indicator</b> Nr 14 [COM 2006 (508 final) ] by evaluating the state and risk of farmland abandonment. The proposed methodology was based on two main elements: the variation of the UAA and the definition of rural areas. After identifying clear definitions for each variable, the way to consider the main flows of land use changes was studied. Due to a lack of accurate data at the appropriate scale, farmland afforestation could not be separated from the flow of FLA and the flow from farmland to sealed soil was estimated based on the hypothesis that it was mainly located in urban areas where the population density is high or increases very fast. The methodology was tested in three of the main agricultural countries in the EU- 27 in terms of surface (France, Spain and Poland). Then, five regions were chosen to cover different contexts where a high level of FLA was observed and interviews of experts and stakeholders completed the study. Based on the results on the main causes of FLA, indicators of risk were proposed and recommendations were formulated to improve the methodology and datasets. JRC.

40|$|Nitrogen is a {{key element}} to ensure modern agriculture’s output, {{sustaining}} global food, feed, fibre and now bio-energy production. But it also accounts also for, or at least contributes to, key environmental problems that challenge the well functioning of today’s societies (Sutton et al. 2011). One molecule of nitrogen can contribute to one or many environmental problems, including eutrophication, groundwater pollution via leaching and run-off of nitrates and organic nitrogen, climate change via N 2 O emissions, acidification via ammonia emissions and may affect human health via ozone formation or biodiversity via nitrogen deposition on natural areas. This multiple impact of nitrogen {{is often referred to as}} the “nitrogen cascade” (Galloway et al. 2003). Accordingly, <b>agri-environmental</b> <b>indicator</b> frameworks typically feature several indicators related to nitrogen such as ammonia emissions, use of nitrogen fertilisers, gross N surplus, nitrates in water or GHG emissions (EEA 2005). Often, however, these indicators are calculated independently from each other based on sometimes contradicting data sources, methodologies or assumptions (see e. g. Grizzetti et al. 2007). This includes also the first overview of the “European Nitrogen Case” that was presented by van Egmond et al. (2002) at the second International Nitrogen Conference held in Potomac (USA). Thus, a system that calculates the detailed nitrogen balance and the related indicators for agriculture in Europe on the basis of consistent data sets and advanced methodologies is highly desirable. A closed balance of nitrogen is calculated in the CAPRI (Common Agricultural Policy Regionalized Impact) model, i. e., next to monetary values and product balances, also the nutrient fluxes are in accordance with the law of mass-conservation (Britz et al., 2007). This has been exploited by Leip et al. (2011 b) to develop nitrogen budgets for the system boundaries of the soil, land, and the farm. The authors provide for the first time mutually consistent calculations of farm, land and soil N-budgets for all member states of the European Union and quantify the two major indicators, namely the nitrogen use efficiency and the nitrogen surplus for each of the N-budgets. The data showed that the nitrogen surplus increases for the soil land > farm budgets. The farm N-budget appeared to be the most relevant one giving a picture of the overall N management of agriculture and is accordingly recommended for integrative studies assessing the “nitrogen footprint” of society. Based on the work of Leip et al. (2011 b), we propose in this chapter three additional nitrogen indicators focusing even more on the use society in European countries makes of their productive land.

40|$|Soil {{quality is}} {{an account of}} the soil¿s ability to provide {{ecosystem}} and social services through its capacities to perform its functions under changing conditions (after Tóth et al. 2007.) The concept of soil quality expressed by this definition allows practical applications with regards to targeted social and/or ecosystem services, including agri-environmental services. The Thematic Strategy for Soil Protection of the European Union (COM 2006 / 231) identifies key soil functions of which the maintenance and improvement have to be considered in soil-related policies of the EU. Among the main soil functions several have agri-environmental relevance, which has {{to be taken into account}} when developing an <b>Agri-environmental</b> Soil Quality <b>Indicator</b> (AE-SQI). For agronomic purposes the biomass production function of soil is of absolute importance. This function, however, can be performed under varying external influences. The two main factors conditioning the performance of biomass production of soil are climate and management. During the evaluation of production function, the reacting capacities of soil to these factors need to be considered. Indication of soil quality from environmental point of view in the agricultural context can relate to off side environmental effects of soil condition and land management practices. The soil¿s capacity to store, filter and transform substances is crucial in this perspective (e. g. carbon storage and climate change; buffering capacity and diffuse contamination). Soil biodiversity can indicate local environmental quality. Based on the above concept an <b>agri-environmental</b> soil quality <b>indicator</b> is being developed for application in the European Union. The agri-environmental soil quality is expressed by an index constituted by four sub indicators: ¿	Productivity index (the capacity of soil to biomass production) ¿	Fertilizer response rate (input change / yield increase ratio) ¿	Production stability index (the soil-response to climatic variability) ¿	Soil environmental quality index (to express environmental aspects of SQ) The four sub indicators cover both agronomic and environmental aspects of the goodness of soil (soil quality), therefore constitute to a comprehensive <b>agri-environmental</b> soil quality <b>indicator,</b> which might be applied on different spatial and temporal scales. The proposed soil quality indicator can be used for policy development (including agricultural and soil protection policies) and monitoring through its capacity: -	to indicate the effect of land use change (marginalization; soil sealing etc.) on the availability and functioning capacity of soil resources; -	to indicate the effect of land management (e. g. intensification) on the functioning capacity of soil resources; -	to indicate the effect of climatic variability on the production function of soil resources; -	to indicate the capacity of soil to mitigate environmental problems (climate change, water pollution etc.). Based on the information provided by the AE-SQI and its sub-indicators, current levels of soil agri-environmental services can be assessed, monitored and future levels of such services can be projected.

50|$|In 1992, ‘agri-environment schemes’ became {{compulsory}} for all European Union Member States. In {{the following}} years {{the main purpose of}} these schemes changed slightly. Initially, they sought to protect threatened habitats, but gradually shifted their focus to the prevention of the loss of wildlife from agricultural landscapes. Most recently, the schemes are placing more emphasis on improving the services that the land can provide to humans (e.g. pollination). Overall, farmers involved in the scheme aim to practice environmentally friendlier farming techniques such as: reducing the use of pesticides, managing or altering their land to increase more wildlife friendly habitats (e.g. increasing areas of trees and bushes), reducing irrigation, conserving soil, and organic farming. As the changes in practices that ensure the protection of the environment are costly to farmers, the EU developed agri-environment schemes to financially compensate individual farmers for applying these changes and therefore increased the implementation of conservation agriculture. The schemes are voluntary for farmers. Once joined, they commit to a minimum of five years during which they have to adopt various sustainable farming techniques.According to the Euro-stat website, in 2009 the agricultural area enrolled in agri-environment schemes covered 38.5 million hectares (20.9% of agricultural land in the 27 member states of the EU at the time) (<b>Agri-environmental</b> <b>indicator</b> 2015). The European Commission spent a total of €3.23 billion on agri-environment schemes in 2012, significantly exceeding the cost of managing special sites of conservation (Natura 2000) that year, which came to a total of €39.6 million (Batáry et al. 2015). There are two main types of agri-environment schemes which have shown different outcomes. Out-of-production schemes tend to be used in extensive farming practices (where the farming land is widespread and less intensive farming is practiced), and focus on improving or setting land aside that will not be used for the production of food, for example, the addition of wildflower strips.In-production schemes (used for a smaller scale, but more intensively farmed land) focus on the sustainable management of arable crops or grassland, for example reduction of pesticides, reduction of grassland mowing, and most commonly, organic farming. In a 2015 review of studies examining the effects of the two schemes, it was found that out-of-production schemes had a higher success rate at enhancing the number of thriving species around the land. The reason behind this is thought to be the scheme’s focus on enhancing specific species by providing them with more unaltered habitats, which results in more food resources for the specific species.On the other hand, in-production schemes attempt to enhance the quality of the land in general, and are thus less species specific. Based on the findings, the reviewers suggest that schemes which more specifically target the declining groups of species, may be more effective. The findings and the targets will be implemented between 2015 and 2020, so that by 2025, the effectiveness of these schemes can be re-assessed and will have increased significantly (Batáry et al. 2015).|$|R

The methodology involves a structured use of meta-criteria and criteria for developing indicator variables and indicators, along with a coherent set of indicators. These indicators are aimed at providing a basis for determining agri-environmental payments to farmers. They are estimated at the object level, that is, per field or field element, so payments can be set that lead to an efficient resource allocation, structure of incentives and production. We find that, according to the criteria assessments for the Swedish agri-environmental situation, {{it is best to}} use a set of seven composite indicators on arable fields, permanent grasslands, linear elements, point elements, forest edges, bio-rich trees and relics.

The ILM is applied to analyze agri-environmental measures to maintain biodiversity in an Austrian landscape. We jointly consider the biodiversity effects of land use intensity (i. e. nitrogen application rates and mowing frequencies) and landscape development (e. g. provision of landscape elements) using a rich indicator set and region specific species-area relationships. The cost-effectiveness of agri-environmental measures in attaining alternative biodiversity targets is assessed by scenario analysis.

Based on OECD works and recent developments by the Joint Working Party in the area of agrienvironmental indicators, we classify agricultural habitat in three main categories: intensive, semi-natural and uncultivated (natural or man-made) habitats located within, at the border and adjacent of agricultural areas. We discuss the importance of using an appropriate index to quantify the total agricultural land area and compare habitat indicators over different periods of time. For each habitat category, we propose additional or alternative indicators that may contribute to better represent Mediterranean regions and agriecosystems. We compare the definition of semi-natural habitat to alternatives criteria (high nature value farmland habitats, low input agricultural systems, extensive agricultural production systems, etc.) and indicate which might be the most appropriate criterion to quantify <b>indicators</b> for <b>agri-environmental</b> policies evaluation.

Since the 1990 s, numerous <b>agri-environmental</b> <b>indicators</b> {{were developed to}} assess the adverse effects of cropping and farming systems in the environment, such as water pollution, soil erosion, and emission of greenhouse gases. Here we present {{the different types of}} indicators developed during the last decade and review the progress of the methods used for their development. The application of different groups of indicators is discussed and illustrated by examples in the fields of nitrogen losses and pesticide risk: (1) indicators based on a single or a combination of variables related to farmer practices, (2) indicators derived from operational or more complex simulation models assessing emissions of pollutants, and (3) measured indicators linked directly to environmental impacts. The nitrogen indicator (IN) of the INDIGO method and the MERLIN indicator will be presented and used to illustrate the methodological discussion. We show that a good identification of the end-users, of the practical objectives of the indicator, and of the spatial and temporal scales is essential and should be done at a preliminary step before designing the indicator itself.

Area under agri-environmental measures in 2003 - which covered the 4 % of agricultural area of Hungary - as a response indicator is also presented and based in the land-use zone system developed by Godollo Agricultural University (Angyan et al., 1998). agri-environmental measures, farm inputs, indicators, Environmental Economics and Policy, Q 01,...|$|E
40|$|The paper gives a {{range of}} {{sustainable}} agricultural policy recommendations, {{based on the results}} of the previous CEESA research phases. We begin by a brief presentation of the Romanian case study dealing with the environmental awareness of farmers, measured by means of <b>agri-environmental</b> <b>indicators</b> and discrete choice modelling. Then, we present the policy instruments dealing with non-point source pollution from agriculture, focusing on those applied in the European Union, that are most likely to be used in accession countries. Here we briefly introduce the Romanian environmental institutional and legislative framework, emphasising the existent water policy instruments. We end up by proposing sustainable agricultural policies that, based on the insights of our case study, we consider to be most appropriate for the case of Romania.

40|$|The {{development}} of policy relevant indicators is important if future environment oriented expenditure within agricultural {{policy is to}} achieve value for money. Appropriate <b>agri-environmental</b> <b>indicators</b> {{can be useful in}} improving transparency, accountability and ensuring the success of monitoring, control and evaluation. Against this background the paper sets out (Section I) to examine the policy challenges in Europe {{that need to be addressed}} in developing policy relevant indicators. It then (Section II) describes recent trends and the future outlook to 2020 of the environmental impacts of the Common Agricultural Policy, including agriculture’s role in protecting the stock of natural resources and landscapes; reducing environmental pollution from agriculture; and improving agrienvironmental management and resource use efficiency. The paper concludes (Section III) by examining the future directions for indicators as a tool for policy purposes...|$|E
40|$|The U. S. crop {{insurance}} program provides subsidies and risk reduction benefits to producers. In response to enhanced income and decreased risk, farmers increase planted acres, often in more risky areas of production. The primary {{objective of this}} thesis {{is to determine the}} relationship between the environment and acreage brought into production as a result of {{crop insurance}}. This thesis does so indirectly, by examining the relationship between yield risk and a set of <b>agri-environmental</b> <b>indicators.</b> An ordinary least squares (OLS) model is used to examine this relationship. It is hypothesized that as acreage becomes more risky in terms of yield, environmental damages resulting from production will increase. Results suggest that while this is not always the case, there is a strong correlation between yield risk and increased soil erosion {{for the majority of the}} acreage in the study area...|$|E
40|$|The report {{explains}} the conceptual and methodological {{development of the}} agrienvironmental indicator on landscape state and diversity, calculated in support of COM(2006) 508 “Development of <b>agri-environmental</b> <b>indicators</b> for monitoring the integration of environmental concerns into the common agricultural policy”. The indicator is based on three components: the degree of naturalness of the rural-agrarian landscape, intended as the influence exerted by society on the agrarian landscape with its agricultural activities and modifications of the original natural state introduced by farming practices; the physical structure, intended as land cover and its spatial organisation {{as a product of}} land management (organisation of different land cover types, plot size, fragmentation, diversity etc.); the societal awareness of the rural-agrarian landscape, as the society perceives, values and assesses landscape quality; the society plans, manages, and uses the landscape for productive or non productive purposes.

40|$|Soil erosion forms a {{major threat}} to European soil resources. Although soil is a vital and largely non-renewable resource, it has not been the subject of {{comprehensive}} EU action so far. A thematic strategy for soil protection, which recognises soil erosion as one of the major threats, has currently been placed high on Europe’s political Agenda. Assessing and monitoring soil erosion is needed to evaluate the impact of, inter alia, agricultural and land use policies in Europe. The driving force–pressure–state–impact–response (DPSIR) policy framework, applied to soil erosion, is reviewed and suggestions for improvements are proposed. The <b>agri-environmental</b> <b>indicators</b> (AEIs) of soil erosion are discussed in relation to data availability, policy requirements and analytical soundness. We propose a reviewed framework and a set of soil erosion indicators that can be objectively calculated, validated against measurements or observations and evaluated by experts. © 2003 Published by Elsevier Ltd...|$|E

The aim {{of this study was to}} identify and select quantitative environmental attributes for a monitoring programme that may be integrated into an environmental evaluation of Ireland’s agri-environmental scheme. This was achieved primarily by reviewing a range of <b>agri-environmental</b> <b>indicators</b> and suggesting indicators that would be appropriate for monitoring the REPS. The study conducted a desk review to collate information on current best practice in monitoring for environmental quality. A Project Group (comprising representatives from the Environmental Protection Agency [EPA], Department of Agriculture and Food [DAF], Teagasc, and the project supervisors) advised on the ongoing development of the project. There was a consultation process with national experts, and with a selection of stakeholder organisations with an interest in monitoring the environmental impact of the REPS...|$|E
