5|$|The {{barn owl}} hunts by flying slowly, {{quartering}} {{the ground and}} hovering over spots that may conceal prey. It may also use branches, fence posts or other lookouts to scan its surroundings, {{and this is the}} main means of prey location in the oil palm plantations of Malaysia. The bird has long, broad wings, enabling it to manoeuvre and turn abruptly. Its legs and toes are long and slender which improves its ability to forage among dense foliage or beneath the snow and gives it <b>a</b> <b>wide</b> <b>spread</b> of talons when attacking prey. Studies have shown that an individual barn owl may eat one or more voles (or their equivalent) per night, equivalent to about twenty-three percent of the bird's bodyweight. Excess food is often cached at roosting sites and can be used when food is scarce.|$|E
5|$|The player kills enemies {{by firing}} daggers from their fingers. There are two firing options: {{clicking}} the left-mouse button fires a shotgun-like blast of daggers with <b>a</b> <b>wide</b> <b>spread,</b> {{and holding the}} mouse button down fires a precise, continuous stream of daggers. Some enemies have weak spots indicated by red crystals on their bodies. Once dead, the red crystals are dropped and can be gathered by the player to obtain attack upgrades, such as increased damage and homing daggers. The player dies when coming into physical contact with an enemy or falling off the stage. At {{the top of the}} screen, a timer displays how long the playthrough has lasted. The player's best survival time is published on a global leaderboard. Accessed via the leaderboard, replays of playthroughs can be downloaded and watched from either a first-person view or a top-down perspective.|$|E

2500|$|In 2009 {{researchers}} at Argonne National Laboratory adapted their GREET model {{to conduct a}} full well-to-wheels (WTW) analysis of energy use and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions of plug-in hybrid electric vehicles for several scenarios, considering different on-board fuels and different sources of electricity generation for recharging the vehicle batteries. Three US regions were selected for the analysis, California, New York, and Illinois, as these regions include major metropolitan areas with significant variations in their energy generation mixes. The full cycle analysis results were also reported for the US generation mix and renewable electricity to examine cases of average and clean mixes, respectively This 2009 study showed <b>a</b> <b>wide</b> <b>spread</b> of petroleum use and GHG emissions among the different fuel production technologies and grid generation mixes.

2500|$|The {{other problem}} was that the Stangensteuerung never worked well with more than one gun. Two (or even three) guns, mounted side by side and firing simultaneously, would have {{produced}} <b>a</b> <b>wide</b> <b>spread</b> of fire that would have been impossible to match with the [...] "safe zone" [...] between the whirling propeller blades. Fokker's initial answer to this was the fitting of extra [...] "followers" [...] to the Stangensteuerung's large cam wheel, to (theoretically) produce the [...] "ripple" [...] salvo necessary to ensure that the guns were aimed at the same point on the propeller disc. This proved a disastrously unstable arrangement in the case of three guns, and was rather less than satisfactory even for two. Most of the early Fokker and Halberstadt biplane fighters were limited to a single gun for this reason.|$|E
2500|$|Visconti, who {{accepted}} an interviewer's {{suggestion that he}} was Bowie's [...] "voice on earth", commented on the album to the international press and provided insights into the individual tracks. The songs cover <b>a</b> <b>wide</b> <b>spread</b> of subjects and are largely observational: most probe the mind-sets of different individuals. [...] "Valentine's Day" [...] is about a high school shooter. [...] "I'd Rather Be High" [...] related {{the story of a}} Second World War soldier. Visconti described the material as [...] "extremely strong and beautiful". He added [...] "if people are looking for classic Bowie they'll find it on this album, if they're looking for innovative Bowie, new directions, they're going to find that on this album too." [...] Visconti commented that 29 tracks were recorded for the album and suggested that some of the material left out of The Next Day could appear on a subsequent record. Visconti speculated that Bowie could return to the studio to produce a new album later in 2013, but this did not happen.|$|E

40|$|The {{hypothesis}} {{of this paper}} is that uncertain moeny growth leads to an increased yield spread between short term and long term interest rates. Since current inflation is obviously the same at any given time, the change in the term structure can be explained, in part, by the greater degree of uncertainty in the long term caused by monetary uncertainty. This hypothesis is tested by looking at the spread between short term and long term instruments in Japan and determining if increased monetary instability leads to <b>a</b> <b>wider</b> yield <b>spread.</b> We find that a rise in monetary uncertainty is associated with <b>a</b> <b>wider</b> <b>spread</b> between short term and long term instruments in Japan...|$|R
