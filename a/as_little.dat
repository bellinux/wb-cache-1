He insisted that the Republican Party would continue to apply political pressure to the President to approve their welfare legislation.|$|E
5|$|A {{desert is}} not the kind of habitat that favours the {{presence}} of amphibians, with their requirement for water to keep their skins moist and for the development of their young. Nevertheless, some frogs live in deserts, creating moist habitats underground and hibernating while conditions are adverse. Couch's spadefoot toad (Scaphiopus couchii) emerges from its burrow when a downpour occurs and lays its eggs in the transient pools that form; the tadpoles develop with great rapidity, sometimes in <b>as</b> <b>little</b> as nine days, undergo metamorphosis, and feed voraciously before digging a burrow of their own.|$|E

5|$|Aircraft {{de-icing}} vehicles usually {{consist of}} a large tanker truck, containing the concentrated de-icing fluid, with a water feed to dilute the fluid according to the ambient temperature. The vehicle also normally has a cherry picker crane, allowing the operator to spray the entire aircraft in <b>as</b> <b>little</b> time as possible; an entire Boeing 737 can be treated in under 10 minutes by a single de-icing vehicle.|$|E

The large {{contracts}} signed by Williams and Martin were extreme exceptions. In October after the cancellation of regular season games, it was not anticipated that many additional NBA players would be signed overseas; leagues had started playing, their rosters were full, and new players could disrupt the teams.|$|E

5|$|An {{important}} feature of the period was {{the development of the}} character makeup of superheroes.

Adult-oriented underground comics also began during the Silver Age.|$|E
5|$|Apart {{from this}} active communication, a good bughouse player tries to {{coordinate}} silently by {{keeping an eye}} on the other board and adapting moves accordingly.

Cincinnati fans had bought 13,000 tickets, while Virginia Tech fans bought fewer than 5,000 tickets from the school's allotment.

5|$|Changing the bogies on a {{rail car}} takes hours and special, heavy equipment. In many cases (especially, {{containerized}} freight), freight is transshipped from one train to another instead {{of changing the}} bogies. As of 2016, this is what's usually done with China-Europe container trains at places such as Khorgos; it is reported that containers can be moved from one train to another in <b>as</b> <b>little</b> as 47 minutes. In the case of liquids, frozen goods and hazardous materials, however, the bogies are usually changed.|$|E
5|$|Chemical {{changes in}} the liquid in the cnida make it a much more {{concentrated}} solution, so that osmotic pressure forces water in very rapidly to dilute it.
