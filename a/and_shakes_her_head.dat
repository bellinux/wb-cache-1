Before I could say {{as much as}} 'Yes,' she stares up at us, and asks in a wild voice, though it wasn't very loud either, if we can tell her the way to Bangbury workhouse. Having pretty sharp eyes of our own, we both of us knew that a workhouse was no fit place for her. Her gown was very dusty, {{and one of her}} boots was burst, and her hair was draggled all over her face, and her eyes was sunk in her head, like; but we saw somehow that she was a lady--or, if she wasn't exactly a lady, that no workhouse was proper for her, at any rate. I stooped down to speak to her; but her baby was crying so dreadful she could hardly hear me. 'Is the poor thing ill?' says I. 'Starving,' says she, in such a desperate, fierce way, that it gave me a turn. 'Is that your child?' says I, a bit frightened about how she'd answer me. 'Yes,' she says in quite a new voice, very soft and sorrowful, and bending her face away from me over the child. 'Then why don't you suckle it?' says I. She looks up at me, and then at Jenny <b>and</b> <b>shakes</b> <b>her</b> <b>head,</b> and says nothing. I give my baby to Jemmy to hold, and went and sat down by her. He walked away a little; and I whispered to her again, 'Why don't you suckle it?' and she whispered to me, 'My milk's all dried up. I couldn't wait to hear no more till I'd got her baby at my own breast.|$|E

40|$|It is a {{busy day}} in the {{emergency}} room with the monitors beeping, the alarms blaring intermittently, the phones ringing, and the overhead paging system crackling at intervals with important messages. The nurses are running {{back and forth between the}} rooms, weaving around the patients on the hallway beds. The doctors are talking in groups while referring to the large overhead displays showing the status of patients. The charge nurse is poring over her computer screen, trying to find beds for waiting patients, while talking on the phone. A paramedic walks up to one of the registration associates and asks, “Do you know what the trauma number is for the patient that just came in?” The registration associate quickly glances through the list of patients on her computer screen and points to a record, “Is that the one? Came in about 30 minutes ago?” The paramedic looks at the record and shakes his head, “No this just came in a few minutes ago. 17 -year-old motor vehicle accident. ” The registration associate looks through the list again, <b>and</b> <b>shakes</b> <b>her</b> <b>head,</b> “I don’t see any other trauma patient in here. ” The paramedic looks at her, frustrated, “I just brought this patient in. Now I can’t find him. ” He walks away, looking for his patient. – Field-notes from the emergency department at the Hershey Medical Cente...|$|E
40|$|It is {{market day}} in GuzHai township, {{and there is}} excite-ment on the streets because the fair has come to town. No {{ordinary}} fair this, it is an agricultural biodiversity fair, the first such event ever seen in Guangxi province — or any-where else in China for that matter. Many hundreds of local farmers crowd {{the section of the}} main street where the fair has been set up to view the diversity of crops and seeds on display. Others are there too — township officials, merchants, curious children, important visitors from Beijing, even a local television crew filming the action. What they see is a rich diversity of crops — 38 crops and 107 varieties. Some are rare and unique to the area, such as black wax maize and mountain lily. They include 31 varieties of maize, 17 of beans, 16 of vegetables, 14 of cereals, and 8 root crops. As well there are traditional herbs, spices, and medicinal plants — almost all of them landraces (farmer-developed varieties). This cornucopia is displayed in booths just as at the regular market, and at each booth there is a neatly printed card giving details of the type and origin of the items laid out there. Proud farmers and some researchers and extension agents attend the booths, happy to talk about their pro-duce with anyone who asks — and many do. The fair-goers are impressed. “I didn’t know it was possible to grow so many varieties of crops here, ” says one. An older farmer examines the maize on display <b>and</b> <b>shakes</b> <b>her</b> <b>head</b> in wonder. “I haven’t seen these seeds since the 1960 s, ” she says. “There are seven maize varieties here that I’ve never seen before, ” responds her companion. ...|$|E
