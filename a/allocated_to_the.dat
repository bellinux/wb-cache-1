5|$|Northcott {{spent much}} of his time from 1943 on in a long battle with the {{government}} over the number of men and women <b>allocated</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Army. He attempted to do so without Blamey being dragged into a political fight but this proved to be impossible. In September 1944, the government reduced the Army's monthly intake of women from 925 to 500, while it only received 420 out of 4,020 men <b>allocated</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> three services. Such a meagre allocation was below what the Army needed to maintain its strength, and formations had to be disbanded. Blamey took up the matter with Prime Minister John Curtin, and managed to get a more satisfactory monthly allocation of 1,500 men per month out of 3,000 <b>allocated</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> three services.|$|E

We find that people with high levels of education <b>allocate</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> small formal sector and receive high compensation for their education and experience. Less educated workers <b>allocate</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> informal sector. While self-employment reveals some characteristics of a sector of dynamic entrepreneurship, the characteristics of the informal salaried sector are closer to those of a sector of hidden unemployment, or a stepping stone for better jobs in the future...|$|R
