25|$|Alec finally {{returned}} to Zimbabwe between December 1979 and March 1980. He remained ostracised by some white Zimbabweans who considered him a traitor, <b>and</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> black Zimbabweans {{who refused to}} accept him due to his family. However, he and Elisabeth settled into an otherwise mundane family life, reconciling with Ian. During the 1980s and early 1990s, Alec held a number of jobs including, from 1991 to 1996, managing director of a professional football team (the Black Aces). Although not an ordained priest, he became a reserve chaplain in the new Zimbabwe National Army. Alec and Elisabeth produced three children - two daughters and one son. Ian Smith's family role as a grandfather offered him some solace after Janet's death in 1994.|$|E
25|$|The {{catalyst}} for the USA PATRIOT Act occurred on September 11, 2001 when terrorists attacked and destroyed the World Trade Center in New York City and {{the western side of}} the Pentagon near Washington D.C. Within a few weeks of the September 11 attacks, a number of bills attempting to make changes to anti-terrorism laws were introduced into Congress. After the USA PATRIOT Act was passed it remained controversial, and began to be questioned by some members of Congress. A number of sections were struck by the courts. Some provisions were challenged by the ACLU, who filed a lawsuit on April 9, 2004. In April 2005, a Senate Judicial Hearing on the Patriot Act was held. The Act was as controversial as ever, <b>and</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> groups were campaigning against it. Aside from the EFF, the ACLU, the CDT and the EPIC, the Act had raised the ire of the American Library Association (ALA) and the American Booksellers Foundation for Freedom of Expression, who were all extremely concerned about the provisions of the Patriot Act.|$|E
25|$|After the {{breakout}} {{from the}} Pusan Perimeter in November 1950, the 8th flew daily strike missions out of Iwakuni {{and at times}} recovering at Taegu AB (K-2), which forced the crews to fly long, arduous missions that sometimes lasted more than six hours. When the Chinese Communists attacked in the Spring of 1951, FEAF requested that the light bomber wings increase their nightly sortie rate. The {{only way to do}} this was to double up some of the missions. For several months, the crews flew from Iwakuni to their patrol sectors in North Korea, completed their mission, and then flew to the K-2 Airfield. Landing a B-26 at night at Taegu was no easy feat because the Pierced Steel Planking on the runway had begun to deteriorate. The B-26s landing there tore up dozens of tires, <b>and</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> accidents resulted. Also, the tires were in short supply, so each one lost at K-2 was hard to replace. If the B-26 crews got down at Taegu without incident, they could find a place to grab a quick catnap as their planes were readied for the next mission. About an hour later, they were airborne and heading north to their next target area. Four hours later, utterly exhausted, they were back in Japan, after up to ten hours of flight and combat.|$|E

500|$|... "Born This Way" [...] {{was given}} a {{positive}} reception by many critics of the show. Erica Futterman of Rolling Stone and Sandra Gonzalez of Entertainment Weekly both considered {{it to be an}} improvement from the previous episode. Futterman wrote that it [...] "gave us the charm, wit and just-zany-enough-to-be-plausible plot lines we were sorely missing after last week's predictable" [...] episode, and added, [...] "Even better: the episode didn't feel as long as the 90 minutes it clocked in at." [...] IGN Robert Canning gave the episode a [...] "great" [...] rating of 8 out of 10. While he said the episode was entertaining, he felt that it {{did not need to be}} an hour and a half. Emily Yahr of The Washington Post agreed about the extended length, and did not like what she called [...] "lame attempts to fill time", which she said [...] "detracted from what started as a decent episode". She did, however, cite several [...] "promising storylines", including Rachel's, and noted, [...] "Usually, New Directions leader Rachel Berry is a caricature of all things annoying—but this episode, we see her genuinely struggling with wanting to love herself the way she is". The Houston Chronicle Bobby Hankinson summed it up as follows: [...] "Not an epic episode, just sort of … meh." [...] Amy Reiter of The Los Angeles Times reacted more positively and wrote, [...] "The 90-minute episode had a lot of laughs, a lot of heart, some good lessons, character development, a few good numbers <b>and</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> surprises." ...|$|E
2500|$|Amy Ratcliffe of IGN {{rated the}} episode 8.7 out of 10, saying [...] "Tonight's Once {{had a few}} weak points with {{characters}} (mostly Emma) acting dense, but it featured delightful performances, meaningful character moments and developments, <b>and</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> laugh out loud moments. Basically, it had heart. And further exploration of the Sorcerer's Hat plot added an interesting layer to the story." ...|$|E
2500|$|Scott Heisel of Alternative Press was effusive, writing [...] "Motion City Soundtrack {{have made}} the best album of their career [...] the album is aggressive, dense and complex, yet still retains {{a strong sense of}} melody and never takes itself too seriously." [...] Entertainment Weekly writer Andy Greenwald praised the album's [...] "soaring choruses," [...] dubbing it a [...] "winning fourth album." [...] Mikael Wood, in a pre-release review for Spin, felt the record [...] "strikes a radio-ready balance between mayhem and melody." [...] The Washington Post Allison Stewart called the album [...] "scruffy, peppy, [...] hopelessly likable" [...] that evokes [...] "evokes punk-pop's halcyon." [...] The A.V. Club critic Kyle Ryan felt it [...] "another in a series of impeccably {{constructed}} pop albums" [...] by the group, noting, [...] "There isn’t a dud among the album’s 12 tracks, <b>and</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> have a catchiness that borders on oppressive." [...] A reviewer for Revolver felt [...] "the real standouts on the band's fourth full-length are the grittier, unexpected moments." ...|$|E

2500|$|Gameplay-wise, Kasumi {{was noted}} {{as one of}} the top {{characters}} in the series. IGN called Kasumi [...] "one of the deadliest fighters in all of DOA, because she has surprising reach and can attack from greater distances than the other girls," [...] adding she [...] "is one of the rare characters to come equipped with a blade and with lightning fast attacks, she can take down opponents in record time." [...] According to Anthony Chau's GameSpy guide for Dead or Alive 3, [...] "Kasumi's all-around game combined with her quickness makes her one of the best fighters for any level of player. Strong stunning attacks, great combinations, and her speed, she's got it all." [...] In GameSpot's guide to Dead or Alive 4, Matthew Rorie wrote Kasumi is [...] "an interesting character for many reasons. While she doesn't rely on brute strength to get the job done, she has a dizzying array of quick strikes <b>and</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> teleportation moves to dazzle your opponents and pull them off guard, allowing you to sneak behind them and attack from the rear, or just confuse them mightily." ...|$|E
2500|$|Ayutthaya (not {{far from}} present-day Bangkok Thailand) {{is said to}} have had a Japanese {{population}} of 1500 individuals at the climax of the community's size and strength, in the 1620s. The kingdom only began trading with Japan around 1570, though it had been actively engaged in commerce with the kingdom of Ryūkyū a short distance to Japan's south, for over one hundred years. This time also {{marked the beginning of the}} Japanese community in Ayutthaya, among the most distant ports from Japan with which the Japanese traded in the early modern period. Japanese [...] "adventurers", mostly ronin fleeing Japan and seeking their fortunes overseas, were welcomed by the kings of Ayutthaya, <b>and</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> were employed by the royal government as bodyguards, soldiers, and in other capacities. The kingdom engaged frequently in conflict with Burma, and many of these samurai soldiers served the court in battle. The kings also engaged in formal relations with the Tokugawa shoguns, receiving shipments of arms and munitions among many other trade items. By the 1620s, Japan was Ayutthaya's most major trading partner, as over twenty Japanese merchant houses, along with many independent adventurers and traders, engaged in commercial shipping between Ayutthaya and Nagasaki every year.|$|E
2500|$|President Bush {{continued}} {{to campaign for}} the reauthorization of the Act. In a speech given in June 2005 to the Ohio State Highway Patrol Academy he reiterated his belief that key provisions should be reauthorized, and that [...] "The Patriot Act has accomplished {{exactly what it was}} designed to do: it has protected American liberty and saved American lives. For the sake of our national security, Congress must not rebuild a wall between law enforcement and intelligence." [...] However, by this time the Act was as controversial as ever, <b>and</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> groups were campaigning against it. Aside from the EFF, the ACLU, the CDT and the EPIC, the Act had raised the ire of the American Library Association (ALA) and the American Booksellers Foundation for Freedom of Expression, who were all extremely concerned about the provisions of the Patriot Act, with a particular focus on section 215. An even more disparate group called the [...] "Patriots to Restore Checks and Balances" [...] (or PRCB) had also been formed to campaign against the Act, and were urging Congress to let the sections expire. Many unlikely bedfellows formed this group, and those numbered in its membership including the ACLU, the American Conservative Union, Gun Owners of America, and the United States Libertarian Party. The group had also supported the SAFE Act.|$|E

60|$|When Buck earned sixteen {{hundred dollars}} {{in five minutes}} for John Thornton, he made it {{possible}} for his master to pay off certain debts and to journey with his partners into the East after a fabled lost mine, the history of which was as old as the history of the country. Many men had sought it; few had found it; <b>and</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> there were who had never returned from the quest. This lost mine was steeped in tragedy and shrouded in mystery. No one knew of the first man. The oldest tradition stopped before it got back to him. From the beginning there had been an ancient and ramshackle cabin. Dying men had sworn to it, and to the mine the site of which it marked, clinching their testimony with nuggets that were unlike any known grade of gold in the Northland.|$|E
