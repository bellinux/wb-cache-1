60|$|Excited by his situation, Ferdinand {{was soon}} tempted to incur {{expenses}} which his income did not justify. The facility of credit afforded him {{not a moment}} to pause; everything he wanted was furnished him; and until the regiment quitted the garrison he was well aware that a settlement of accounts was never even desired. Amid this imprudence he was firm, however, in his resolution never to trespass on the resources of his father. It was with difficulty that he even brought himself to draw for the allowance which Sir Ratcliffe insisted on making him; and he would gladly have saved his father from making even this advance, by vague intimations of the bounty of Lord Grandison, had he not feared this conduct might have led to suspicious and disagreeable enquiries. It cannot be denied that his debts occasionally caused him anxiety, {{but they were not}} considerable; he quieted his conscience by the belief that, if he were pressed, his grandfather could scarcely refuse to discharge a few hundred pounds for his favourite grandson; and, at all events, he felt that the ultimate resource of selling his commission was still reserved for him. If these vague prospects did not drive away compunction, the qualms of conscience were generally allayed in the evening assembly, in which his vanity was gratified. At length he paid his first visit to England. That was a happy meeting. His kind father, his dear, dear mother, and the faithful Glastonbury, experienced some of the most transporting moments of their existence, when they beheld, with admiring gaze, the hero who returned to them. Their eyes were never satiated with beholding him; they hung upon his <b>accents.</b> <b>Then</b> came the triumphant visit to Grandison; and then Ferdinand returned to Malta, in the full conviction that he was the heir to fifteen thousand a year.|$|E

40|$|The thesis proposes an {{algorithm}} for {{the recognition}} of musical meter from acoustic signals of music. Musical meter {{is a part of}} rhythm that is constantly present in music, as it spans the musical time base. The proposed model is capable of finding metrical levels, including the beat and the tatum, in real time from a musical audio signal. The model comprises four main components: an onset detector, a tatum estimator, a phenomenal accent model, and a beat estimator. The onset detector finds distinct sound onsets from an acoustic signal, using multiband signal processing. After this, the tatum, which is the lowest metrical level, is computed from onset times. Phenomenal accents are computed from a set of 16 acoustic signal features using Bayesian pattern recognition. The tatum and the <b>accents</b> <b>then</b> yield the beat. The proposed model operates causally and is able to respond to tempo changes. The design of the model aims at generality in regard to musical genres, and thus the model is trained and tested using 330 music excerpts from multiple genres. The model performance varies according to the rhythmic difficulty of the input signal. Most pop/rock music poses no problems for the algorithm, while classical music and expressive jazz pieces are intractable. The model produces more errors than Eric Scheirer's beat tracker, {{but at the same time}} it follows more metrical levels than Scheirer's model. The results of this thesis are directly applicable in music production and post-processing. The access to musical time enables new levels of productivity and automation in both music software and hardware. Meter-synchronized comparison, mixing, and editing of pieces of music is possible. Robust meter recognition is a vital component of music information retrieval applications...|$|E
40|$|The {{first part}} of the paper {{contrasts}} two different systems for representing the stress or accentuation of English words—that exemplified by Chomsky and Halle (1968) and that found in many English-language dictionaries. The main difference lies in the treatment of "full" (as opposed to "reduced") vowels: For Chomsky-Halle full vowels are always stressed; for the lexicographers they can be either accented or unaccented. Whereas the Chomsky-Halle notation concentrates on degrees of prominence among syllables, the dictionary representation corresponds to a surface representation of underlying metrical foot structure. We claim that the latter notation provides a simpler and more elegant characterization of English word accentuation. Adopting this perspective we show that English words typically are composed of binary and ternary feet that are left-headed, whereas unary feet and unfooted syllables are restricted to the right and left edges of words, respectively. The main body of the paper provides an extensive analysis of English word accentuation. First, we consider morphologically simple (underived) words, and we present the rules for creating their foot structures and associated <b>accents.</b> <b>Then</b> we turn to morphologically complex (derived) forms. We adopt a noncyclic approach where the rules for deriving foot structures apply simultaneously to each of the constituents of a derived word. We discuss accent preservation, where the syllable that is accented in a contained word retains that accent in the derived word. Nonpreservation happens whenever there is overlap of syllables in the feet of two adjacent constituents. Next, we offer a nonderivational (OT-style) account of the data, and we compare the ranked constraints to the derivational rules for deriving foot structures. In support of the noncyclic approach, we show how the constraints evaluate simultaneously the morphological constituents of a derived form. The final part of paper presents a set of correspondence rules for converting an accentual representation to a notation with stress levels. In this way we are able to extend the analysis to phrases, compounds, and sentences and to show that similar principles govern the stress levels of these higher-level constituent types. We reject the depth-of-embedding typical of many previous analyses, and instead we argue for a flat phonological phrase, one composed of unary, binary, or ternary constituents...|$|E

40|$|This {{paper is}} an attempt to delimit the {{different}} theories about the "stress" problem in the nineteenth century Spanish linguistics.

First, we have tried to define which is the main constituent of the Spanish accent {{in the view of the}} Spanish prosodists of that period. Concerning this matter, we have observed that while the earliest theories identify accent and tone modulations, at the middle of the century the stress, considered as a parameter of intensity, is more and more admitted as the basic element of the Spanish <b>accent.</b> <b>Then,</b> we have examined, according to the different theories, the relations between accent and the rest of the prosodic features...|$|R

However, the complexities in the language of each country are not same. Vietnamese handwriting {{character recognition}} is facing many problems, most of them come from the accent. This paper focuses on accent recognition, especially when there is a connection between two accents- a common problem which affects the identification result. Our approach starts with separating accent from character using the connected-component labeling method. The obtained <b>accent</b> <b>then</b> is checked if it is single or multiple (the combination of many accents). The recognition is performed using support vector machines with the single accent, or hidden Markov model if the accent is multiple. Proposed solution has been tested and obtained high accuracy.
