5|$|The museum {{stresses}} that the paintings {{be kept in}} good condition by whoever has them. Museum director, Anne Hawley has stated that the works {{should be kept in}} a stable environment of 50% humidity and 70°F. Additionally, they should be kept away from light and stored in <b>acid-free</b> <b>paper.</b> Hawley also noted to avoid rolling the paintings, which will crack the paint. If these guidelines are not followed, the paintings could be damaged and drop in value. More repainting would need to be done too, which hurts the paintings' integrity.|$|E
500|$|In March 1929 Ward {{showed the}} first thirty blocks to Harrison Smith (1888–1971) of the {{publisher}} Cape & Smith. [...] Smith {{offered him a}} contract and told him the work would be the lead title in the company's first catalog if Ward could finish it by the summer's end. [...] The first printing appeared that October; it had trade and deluxe editions. [...] The trade edition was printed from electrotype plates made from molds of the original boxwood woodblocks; the deluxe edition was printed from the original woodblocks themselves, and was a signed edition limited to 409 copies, printed on <b>acid-free</b> <b>paper,</b> bound in black cloth, and sheathed in a slipcase. [...] The pages were printed on the recto face of the page; the verso was left blank. [...] It was dedicated to three of Ward's teachers: his wood engraving teacher in Leipzig, Hans Alexander [...] "Theodore" [...] Mueller (1888–1962), and Teachers College, Columbia University art instructors John P. Heins (1896–1969) and Albert C. Heckman (1893–1971).|$|E

50|$|All paper {{products}} will acidify over time, so even archival <b>acid-free</b> <b>paper</b> products used for storage are typically replaced every few years. Archival <b>acid-free</b> <b>paper</b> products {{can be either}} buffered or unbuffered. Unbuffered paper has a neutral pH and is used for housing photographs, textiles, and most other types of objects, while buffered paper, which is impregnated with calcium carbonate and has an alkaline pH, is used for storing paper objects. The buffered paper absorbs the acid that paper objects emit and keeps the micro-environment from becoming overly acidic {{for a longer period}} of time.|$|E

50|$|The company Hercules Incorporated {{developed}} the first alkaline sizing in the 1950s that made <b>acid-free</b> <b>paper</b> possible.

This voluntary standard covered pH value, tear resistance, alkaline reserve, and lignin thresholds for paper to last thousands of years and was developed to {{encourage the use of}} <b>acid-free</b> <b>paper</b> in library materials. The development of the initial standard was a result of the work of the Council on Library Resources, which effectively lobbied ANSI to adopt the guidelines.|$|E

5000|$|HD-Rosetta {{was first}} {{developed}} in the Los Alamos National Laboratory. The purpose {{was to develop a}} permanent data storage disc that would withstand nuclear war. Primarily focusing on archiving information, HD-Rosetta is thought as a method for preserving history. In 1999, The New York Times used HD-Rosetta for their [...] "Times Capsule". Their HD-Rosetta disk contains six New York Times Millennium issues. The disk, along with <b>acid-free</b> archival <b>paper,</b> was put in a container filled with argon gas.

50|$|Pulp paper, however, {{contains}} acid {{which eventually}} destroys the paper from within. Earlier techniques for making paper used limestone rollers, which neutralized the acid in the pulp.

5000|$|One {{of the key}} {{components}} of modern scrapbooking is the archival quality of the supplies. Designed to preserve photographs and journaling in their original state, materials encouraged by most serious scrapbookers are of a higher quality than those of many typical photo albums commercially available. Scrappers insist on <b>acid-free,</b> lignin-free <b>papers,</b> stamp ink, and embossing powder. They also use pigment-based inks, which are fade resistant, colorfast, and often waterproof. Many scrappers use buffered paper, which will protect photos from acid in memorabilia used in the scrapbook. Older [...] "magnetic" [...] albums are not acid-free and thus cause damage to the photos and memorabilia included in them. Gloves, too, are used to protect photos from the oil on hands.|$|R
30|$|Whatman {{qualitative}} {{filter paper}} No. 3 (c. 27  cm diameter) with no further treatment {{was used as}} a support with a near neutral pH. For alkaline papers, either Whatman qualitative filter paper No. 3 was immersed in calcium hydroxide solution (pH c. 13) for 15  min and air dried, or commercially-obtained buffered <b>acid-free</b> tissue <b>paper</b> was used. For experiments involving unlaked carmine and tin-laked carmine only the tissue paper was used. An acidic paper was prepared by brushing Whatman qualitative filter paper No. 3 with a traditional gelatin/alum paper sizing solution prepared using a 2.5 % w/vol aqueous solution of gelatin mixed with alum in 100 : 1  wt% ratio [22, 23] and dried in air. The surface pH was measured using an Oakton Phelect flat electrode on the wetted surface of the papers to provide a general sense of the pH.|$|R
