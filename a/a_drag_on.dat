5|$|From March 2013, {{concerns}} over further currency war diminished, though in November several journalists and analysts warned {{of a possible}} fresh outbreak. The likely principal source of tension appeared to shift once again, this time not being the U.S. versus China or the Eurozone versus Japan, but the U.S. versus Germany. In late October U.S. treasury officials had criticized Germany for running an excessively large current account surplus, thus acting as <b>a</b> <b>drag</b> <b>on</b> the global economy.|$|E

25|$|China's banking {{sector is}} {{dominated}} by four large state-owned banks, which are largely inefficient and monopolistic. China's largest bank, ICBC, is the largest bank in the world. The financial sector is widely seen as <b>a</b> <b>drag</b> <b>on</b> the economy due to the inefficient state management. Non-performing loans, mostly made to local governments and unprofitable state-owned enterprises for political purposes, especially the political goal of keeping unemployment low, are a big drain on the financial system and economy, reaching over 22% of GDP by 2000, with a drop to 6.3% by 2006 due to government recapitalization of these banks. In 2006, {{the total amount of}} non-performing loans was estimated at $160billion. Observers recommend privatization of the banking system to solve this problem, a move that was partially carried out when the four banks were floated on the stock market. China's financial markets, the Shanghai Stock Exchange and Shenzhen Stock Exchange, are relatively ineffective at raising capital, as they comprise only 11% of GDP.|$|E

25|$|The {{upper part}} of the thermosphere, where the mean free path of the {{molecules}} exceeds the scale height, is called the exosphere. The lower boundary of the Uranian exosphere, the exobase, is located at a height of about 6,500km, or 1/4 of the planetary radius, above the surface. The exosphere is unusually extended, reaching as far as several Uranian radii from the planet. It is made mainly of hydrogen atoms and is often called the hydrogen corona of Uranus. The high temperature and relatively high pressure {{at the base of the}} thermosphere explain in part why Uranus's exosphere is so vast. The number density of atomic hydrogen in the corona falls slowly with the distance from the planet, remaining as high a few hundred atoms per cm3 at a few radii from Uranus. The effects of this bloated exosphere include <b>a</b> <b>drag</b> <b>on</b> small particles orbiting Uranus, causing a general depletion of dust in the Uranian rings. The infalling dust in turn contaminates the upper atmosphere of the planet.|$|E
500|$|In the 1964U.S. presidential election, Senator Barry Goldwater {{quickly became}} the likely Republican Party nominee. Goldwater {{represented}} {{a new wave of}} American conservatism, of which the moderate Romney was not a part. Romney also felt that Goldwater would be <b>a</b> <b>drag</b> <b>on</b> Republicans running in all the other races that year, including Romney's own (at the time, Michigan had two-year terms for its governor). Finally, Romney disagreed strongly with Goldwater's views on civil rights; he would later say, [...] "Whites and Negroes, in my opinion, have got to learn to know each other. Barry Goldwater didn't have any background to understand this, to fathom them, and I couldn't get through to him." ...|$|E

The Burger King Corporation franchising system set up by McLamore and Edgerton allowed the company to expand a great pace, but the lack of contractual restraints and controls on its franchisee operation led to inconsistencies in its products that in turn were <b>a</b> <b>drag</b> <b>on</b> the reputation of the chain. Additionally, the agreements gave the company too little power to prevent its franchises from doing as they wished with the business.|$|E

2500|$|For example, Delta Airlines {{has reduced}} the number of flights it {{operates}} from the United States to Narita International Airport that are intended to transfer passengers to other destinations in Asia. [...] Instead, Delta will utilize twin-engine widebody aircraft operating from an expanded hub at Seattle-Tacoma International Airport. Total capacity will be cut, but consequentially load factors will increase. [...] In April 2015, Delta announced it would accelerate the retirement of its 747-400 aircraft and replace them either with Airbus A330 aircraft reassigned from cancelled international runs, or with new Airbus A350 aircraft now on order. [...] That will leave just six 747s flying for the airline in 2015. Delta could not keep the 747s full without deeply discounting ticket prices; the discounts and increased maintenance required of a four-engine aircraft led to <b>a</b> <b>drag</b> <b>on</b> profits.|$|E
2500|$|Combat units also lacked cohesion, {{due to the}} {{reluctance}} of the Johnson administration to call up the reserves, and a rotation policy that did not secure the best trained personnel on a consistent, long-term basis for Vietnam. The result in many US units was an endless supply of less seasoned [...] "green" [...] draftees or short-training officers, [...] "rotated" [...] in the theater for one year. Such policies were <b>a</b> <b>drag</b> <b>on</b> overall stability and cohesion, and caused the loss of hard-won combat knowledge in-country. Troop rotation policies also hindered continuity in pacification. Adviser postings to the ARVN's regular or local forces for example, were {{not considered to be}} a desirable career tracks, and a one-year or six-month tour of duty left scant time to build the intimate knowledge of an area, its politics, and its people necessary to counter the clandestine Communist infrastructure. American advisers might just begin to see results on the ground when they were rotated out.|$|E

He was famous for his [...] "bizarre yodel", and catchphrases which included [...] "How's about that, then?", [...] "Now then, now then", [...] "Goodness gracious", [...] "As it 'appens" [...] and [...] "Guys and gals". Savile was frequently spoofed for his distinctive appearance, which usually featured a tracksuit or shell suit and gold jewellery. A range of licensed fancy dress costumes was released with his consent in 2009. Savile was often pictured holding a cigar.

2500|$|Dropping the fly {{onto the}} water and its {{subsequent}} movement on or beneath the surface is one of fly fishing's most difficult aspects; the angler is attempting to cast {{in such a way}} that the line lands smoothly on {{the water and}} the fly appears as natural as possible. At a certain point, if a fish does not strike, depending upon the action of the fly in the wind or current, the angler picks up the line to make another presentation. On the other hand, if a fish strikes, the angler pulls in line while raising the rod tip. This [...] "sets" [...] the hook in the fish's mouth. The fish is played either by hand, where the angler continues to hold the fly line in one hand to control the tension applied to the fish, or by reeling up any slack in the line and then using the hand to act as <b>a</b> <b>drag</b> <b>on</b> the reel. Most modern fly reels have an adjustable, mechanical drag system to control line tension during a fish's run.|$|E
2500|$|... "The {{final and}} best means of {{strengthening}} demand among consumers and {{business is to}} reduce the burden on private income and the deterrents to private initiative which are imposed by our present tax system; and this administration pledged itself last summer to an across-the-board, top-to-bottom cut in personal and corporate income taxes to be enacted and become effective in 1963. I am not talking about a 'quickie' or a temporary tax cut, which would be more appropriate if a recession were imminent. Nor am I talking about giving the economy a mere shot in the arm, to ease some temporary complaint. I am talking about the accumulated evidence of the last 5 years that our present tax system, developed as it was, in good part, during World War II to restrain growth, exerts too heavy <b>a</b> <b>drag</b> <b>on</b> growth in peace time; that it siphons out of the private economy too large a share of personal and business purchasing power; that it reduces the financial incentives for personal effort, investment, and risk-taking." ...|$|E
2500|$|Wallace {{retracted}} the invitation, and (after considering Kentucky Fried Chicken founder Colonel Harland Sanders) chose former Air Force General Curtis LeMay of California. LeMay {{was considered}} {{instrumental in the}} establishment in 1947 of the United States Air Force and an expert in military affairs. His four-star military rank, experience at Strategic Air Command and presence advising President Kennedy during the Cuban Missile Crisis were considered foreign-policy assets to the Wallace campaign. By 1968, LeMay had retired and was serving {{as chairman of the}} board of an electronics company, but the company threatened to dismiss him if he took a leave of absence to run for vice president. To keep LeMay on the ticket, Wallace backer and Texas oil tycoon H. L. Hunt set up a million-dollar fund to reimburse LeMay for any income lost in the campaign. Campaign aides tried to persuade LeMay to avoid questions relating to nuclear weapons, but when asked if he thought their use was necessary to win the Vietnam War, he first said that America can win in Vietnam without them. [...] However, he alarmed the audience by further commenting, [...] "we [...] have a phobia about nuclear weapons. [...] I think there may be times when it would be most efficient to use nuclear weapons." [...] The [...] "politically tone-deaf" [...] LeMay became <b>a</b> <b>drag</b> <b>on</b> Wallace's candidacy for the remainder of the campaign.|$|E

2500|$|When the {{hospital}} in Charlestown was destroyed in a hurricane in 1899, planting of trees in the squares of Saint Kitts and refurbishing of government buildings, also in Saint Kitts, took precedence over the rebuilding of the only hospital in Nevis. After five years without any proper medical facilities, the leaders in Nevis initiated a campaign, threatening to seek independence from Saint Kitts. The British Administrator in Saint Kitts, Charles Cox, was unmoved. He stated that Nevis did not need a hospital since {{there had been no}} significant {{rise in the number of}} deaths during the time Nevisians had been without a hospital. Therefore, no action was needed on behalf of the government, and besides, Cox continued, the Legislative Council regarded [...] "Nevis and Anguilla as <b>a</b> <b>drag</b> <b>on</b> St. Kitts and would willingly see a separation". Finally, a letter of complaint to the metropolitan British Foreign Office gave result and the federal government in Saint Kitts was ordered by their superiors in London to take speedy action. The Legislative Council took another five years to consider their options. The final decision by the federal government was to not rebuild the old hospital after all, but to instead convert the old Government House in Nevis into a hospital, named Alexandra Hospital after Queen Alexandra, wife of King Edward VII. A majority of the funds assigned for {{the hospital}} could thus spent on the construction of a new official residence in Nevis.|$|E
