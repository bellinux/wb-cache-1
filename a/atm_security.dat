Namely, events which had unfolded in Japan, Dubai, the mid-sea of the Bay of Bengal, a highway in Andhra Pradesh and a remote ATM booth in Tamil Nadu. They fail to capture ghosts in camera in all the cases. Now they were worried that they would lose 60 crore prize amount and Prosper would win. Meanwhile, they learn about a video footage in which a ghost is sighted killing the ATM watchmen. The video footage is in a pen drive owned by the owner of the security company (Bosskey) in which the <b>ATM</b> <b>security</b> guard was employed. When he comes to know the huge reward money for a video footage proving existence of ghosts he demands Rs 50 lakhs for the pen drive. Meghna approaches Prosper to get Rs 50 lakhs. Instead Prosper tries {{to take advantage of the}} situation and behaves indecently with her. Meghna gets annoyed and returns home and narrates the incident to Gokul and Bala. That night Meghna gets a call from her lover (Ajay) and with shock and fear she utters one word..... accident!!!!. Three of them visit the place and find Ajay dying. Before dying he narrates the incident and records in his camera. Ajay and his friends while traveling in a car watch a movie from a CD which they had picked up from a vendor who states that it is an unreleased movie. As they watch the movie the same incidents starts happening to them as shown in the movie. Soon after all of them are killed and Ajay was able to bury the CD. The CD was found but before they could get hold of it all three of them are killed by the ghost. Prosper after winning the bet reclaims and rejoices his prize, a Yamaha RX 100. After hearing the door bell ring Prosper opens the door to be killed by a ghost.|$|E

While Provenza removes some of the more graphic {{pictures}} from the murder book, Buzz insists on seeing them and tells everyone he doesn't want this to be the way their story is told. To this end, Buzz agrees to let his tragedy and search for justice to be the next story in Rusty's Identity segment entitled The Long Shadow which they start by going back {{to the scene of the}} crime where Buzz describes what happened before explaining to Rusty's audience that the victims were his father and uncle. With the help of the squad, Buzz gets the <b>ATM</b> <b>security</b> tape cleaned up and focuses on his search on a partial fingerprint left behind on his father's ATM card. After a suggestion from Provenza, Buzz began searching through similar unsolved ATM robberies for matching partials to try to identify the man who left the partial and in The Long Shadow Part 6 has had some luck, finding another partial that matches the one on the ATM card. In [...] "Family Law", through identifying a witness and not a suspect, Buzz is able to use his partials to identify one of the men from the robbery, Gene Hecht who is serving a life sentence and who's known crimes include an ATM robbery three miles from where Buzz's father and uncle were murdered. Buzz begins the process of having Gene transferred in an attempt to gain his cooperation in identifying his accomplice, the man who was the actual killer. In [...] "Dead Zone", Buzz interrogates Gene who gives him an alibi. In the following episode, Buzz questions the woman who not only breaks Gene's alibi but gives more proof towards his guilt as Gene was wearing a rare watch the day after the murder that had been taken from Buzz's uncle. With this statement, Buzz is able to get Gene to give up the name of his father and uncle's killer, Bill Jones and identify him in [...] "White Lies, Part 2." [...] In [...] "White Lies, Part 3", Buzz uses social media to identify a possible suspect for the Bill Jones he's looking for. Due to some amateur detective work, Rusty is able to get Buzz Bill's fingerprints, enabling him to confirm the suspect's identity. Accompanied by Provenza and several police officers, Buzz travels to Bill Jones' home where he discovers the man has a wife and kids, leaving Buzz uneasy. After allowing Bill to say goodbye to his family, Buzz personally arrests the man for the murders of his father and uncle. Buzz later tells Rusty and his boyfriend Gus that Bill confessed to the murders and the DA is working up a deal of life in prison without parole. However, Buzz is disturbed as Bill had two kids of his own and in arresting him, Buzz left two children fatherless as Bill did to him and his sister. In the final segment of Identity, Buzz states that Gene Hecht and Bill Jones both confessed in open court to the murders of his father and uncle and took deals that gives Hecht another life sentence in the prison he was already incarcerated in and Bill Jones gets life in prison without parole in a prison near his family. In [...] "Heart Failure", Buzz receives a letter from Bill's son Gabe asking for Buzz to forgive Bill so he can return to his family. Buzz is left distressed as Gabe expresses that his father deeply regrets his actions and his arrest is destroying their family.|$|E

40|$|Automated teller machine (ATM) frauds are {{increasing}} drastically these days. When analyzing {{the most common}} attacks {{and the reasons for}} successful frauds, it becomes apparent that the main problem lies in the PIN based authentication which in itself does not provide any security features (besides the use of asterisks). That is, security is solely based on a user’s behavior. Indirect input is one way to solve this problem. This mostly comes at the costs of adding overhead to the input process. We present ColorPIN, an authentication mechanism that uses indirect input to provide security enhanced PIN entry. At the same time, ColorPIN remains a one-to-one relationship between the length of the PIN and the required number of clicks. A user study showed that ColorPIN is significantly more secure than standard PIN entry while enabling good authentication speed in comparison with related systems.

Interconnecting various ATM systems, could potentially open up the systems to more attacks, thereby increasing vulnerabilities and the overall risk, unless adequate security measures are taken. This necessitates to provision for a security management solution in a multi-national scale, providing the basis for handling security, from identification of security threats to prevention, detection and efficient resolution of the attacks. GAMMA is aimed at providing a holistic vision for this <b>ATM</b> <b>security</b> management and maintaining alignment with ATM developments under SESAR.

40|$|The ATM Forum has {{released}} an <b>ATM</b> <b>Security</b> Specification {{that contains the}} requirements and specifications of security support services.

This paper aims to carry out performance analysis to determine the cell throughput and SME setup time for different sets of security association topologies. For this purpose, security support services are implemented and integrated with the NIST ATM/HFC Network Simulator.
