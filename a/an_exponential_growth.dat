5|$|There {{have also}} been {{dramatic}} changes in telephone communication behind the scenes. Starting with the operation of TAT-8 in 1988, the 1990s saw the widespread adoption of systems based on optical fibers. The benefit of communicating with optic fibers is that they offer a drastic increase in data capacity. TAT-8 itself was able to carry 10 times as many telephone calls as the last copper cable laid {{at that time and}} today's optic fibre cables are able to carry 25 times as many telephone calls as TAT-8. This increase in data capacity is due to several factors: First, optic fibres are physically much smaller than competing technologies. Second, they do not suffer from crosstalk which means several hundred of them can be easily bundled together in a single cable. Lastly, improvements in multiplexing have led to <b>an</b> <b>exponential</b> <b>growth</b> in the data capacity of a single fibre.|$|E

This concerns not only the cost of the hardware and software necessary for storing data, but also the rapidly growing energy consumption in storage systems.

This could be observed during the stages preceding a catalytic replication that are necessary for the formation of hypercycles.

The growth function βn(S, Γ) = |{g | λS(g) ≤ n} | depends on the chosen generating set. <b>A</b> group has <b>exponential</b> <b>growth</b> if the growth rate, β(S, Γ) = limitn→∞βn(S, Γ) 1 n is strictly greater than 1. In fact, for another finite generating set T = {t 1, · · ·, tq} for Γ, if both maxjλS(tj) ≤ L and maxiλT(si) ≤ L, then βn(S, Γ) ≤ βLn(T, Γ) and also the symmetric inequality.
