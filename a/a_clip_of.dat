5|$|In 1931, {{with the}} 1932–33 series in mind, the {{selectors}} had appointed Jardine as England's captain. In {{his efforts to}} build a strategy whereby he could threaten the Australian supremacy, the new captain consulted widely. Along with other observers, including Duckworth (who had kept wicket for England during the 1930 Oval Test) he thought that Bradman showed a dislike for fast, rising balls, and had been shaken when one such delivery from Larwood had {{hit him in the}} chest. This matter had been widely discussed among cricketers; <b>a</b> <b>clip</b> <b>of</b> film from the Oval match appeared to confirm that Bradman had flinched. This, to Jardine, suggested the basis of a plan: a sustained attack of fast leg theory that might unsettle not just Bradman but the Australian batsmen generally.|$|E
