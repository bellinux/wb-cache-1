25|$|The {{community}} of visible interacting beings and the cosmos {{is referred to}} as ụ̀wà, which includes all living things íhẹ́ ndi dị́ ńdụ̀, including animals and vegetation and their mineral elements which possess a vital force and are regarded as counterparts to invisible forces in the spirit world. These living things and geomorphological features of the world therefore possess a guardian deity. Igbo cosmology presents a balance between the feminine and masculine, perhaps, with a preponderance of female representation in Igbo lore. In Igbo cosmology, the world was divided into four corners by the high god corresponding to èké órìè àfọ̀ ǹkwọ́ which <b>are</b> <b>the</b> <b>days</b> <b>of</b> the week in the Igbo calendar regarded as market days. The universe is regarded as a composite of bounded spaces in an overlapping hemispherical structure, the total spaces are referred to as élú nà àlà. In one Igbo cosmological theory reported by W.R.G. Morton in the 1950s from an elder in Ibagwa Nike in northern Igboland, Chukwu sees that the sun travels across the world in the day time and then cuts into two in order for the moon to pass on a perpendicular route, and so the world is divided into four parts and four days. The quarterly division of the earth and the days makes the number four sacred (ńsọ́) to the Igbo. The élú nà àlà space is defined by two boundaries: élú ígwé, 'sky's limit' composed of heavenly bodies under the main forces of the 'masculine' sun and 'feminine' moon, and élú àlà, 'earth or lands limit' consisting of the four material elements of fire and air (masculine), and earth and water (feminine).|$|E
500|$|However, Mercury and {{his inner}} circle of colleagues and friends, whom he felt he could trust, {{continually}} denied the stories, even after one front-page article published on 29 April 1991, showed Mercury appearing very haggard in what was by then a rare public appearance. It {{has been suggested that}} he could have made a contribution to AIDS awareness by speaking earlier about his situation and his fight against the disease. Mercury kept his condition private to protect those closest to him, with Brian May confirming in a 1993 interview he had informed the band of his illness much earlier. Filmed in May 1991, the music video for [...] "These <b>Are</b> <b>the</b> <b>Days</b> <b>of</b> Our Lives" [...] features a very thin Mercury, in what are his final scenes in front of the camera. The rest of the band were ready to record when Mercury felt able to come into the studio, {{for an hour or two}} at a time. May says of Mercury: [...] "He just kept saying. 'Write me more. Write me stuff. I want to just sing this and do it and when I am gone you can finish it off.' He had no fear, really." [...] Justin Shirley-Smith, the assistant engineer for those last sessions, states: [...] "This is hard to explain to people, but it wasn't sad, it was very happy. He [...] was one of the funniest people I ever encountered. I was laughing most of the time, with him. Freddie was saying [...] 'I'm not going to think about it, I'm going to do this.' ...|$|E
2500|$|Anticipation for {{the coming}} of the Mashiach, and belief in the {{imminent}} arrival, has been on {{the hearts and minds of}} Jews through the past two millennia. Maimonides ruled that all Jews must believe with perfect faith, each day, that the mashiach will come and the resurrected of the dead will take place. He rules that anyone who does not believe this, denies the entire Torah. The Chafetz Chaim, Rabbi Yisrael Meir Kagan, wrote [...] "our days <b>are</b> <b>the</b> <b>days</b> <b>of</b> Messiah’s coming. Hear my brothers and friends; these <b>are</b> <b>the</b> <b>days</b> <b>of</b> Messiah. It is clear that our days <b>are</b> <b>the</b> <b>days</b> <b>of</b> Messiah’s coming," [...] and Rabbi Moshe Feinstein, wrote that [...] "we are obligated to anticipate the arrival of the Messiah on any given day as a near certainty." ...|$|E

2500|$|Michael {{performed}} at The Freddie Mercury Tribute Concert on 20 April 1992 at London's Wembley Stadium. The concert was {{a tribute to}} the life of the late Queen frontman, Freddie Mercury, with the proceeds going to AIDS research. In his last ever radio interview Mercury had praised Michael adding that he loved his track [...] "Faith". Michael performed [...] "'39", [...] "These <b>Are</b> <b>the</b> <b>Days</b> <b>of</b> Our Lives" [...] with Lisa Stansfield and [...] "Somebody to Love".

2500|$|On 23 November 1991, in a {{prepared}} statement made on his deathbed, Mercury confirmed {{that he had}} AIDS. Within 24 hours of the statement, he died of bronchial pneumonia, which was brought on as a complication of AIDS. His funeral service on 27 November in Kensal Green, West London was private, and held {{in accordance with the}} Zoroastrian religious faith of his family. [...] "Bohemian Rhapsody" [...] was re-released as a single shortly after Mercury's death, with [...] "These <b>Are</b> <b>the</b> <b>Days</b> <b>of</b> Our Lives" [...] as the double A-side. The music video for [...] "These <b>Are</b> <b>the</b> <b>Days</b> <b>of</b> Our Lives" [...] contains Mercury's final scenes in front of the camera. This track had featured {{at the beginning of the}} year on the Innuendo album, and the video for it was recorded in May 1991 (which proved to be Mercury's final work with Queen). It had already been released as a single in the US in September that year. The single went to number one in the UK, remaining there for five weeks – the only recording to top the Christmas chart twice and the only one to be number one in four different years (1975, 1976, 1991, and 1992). Initial proceeds from the single – approximately £1,000,000 – were donated to the Terrence Higgins Trust, an AIDS charity.|$|E

2500|$|Queen's {{subsequent}} {{album was}} Innuendo, on which May's contributions increased, although more in arrangements than actual writing in most cases; {{for the title}} track he {{did some of the}} arrangement for the heavy solo, then he added vocal harmonies to [...] "I'm Going Slightly Mad" [...] and composed the solo of [...] "These <b>Are</b> <b>the</b> <b>Days</b> <b>of</b> Our Lives", a song for which the four of them decided the keyboard parts together. He changed the tempo and key of Mercury's song [...] "The Hitman" [...] and took it under his wing, even singing guide vocal in the demo. May also co-wrote some of the guitar lines in [...] "Bijou".|$|E
2500|$|Galileo and Scaramouche {{are making}} {{their way to the}} Seven Seas of Rhye, arguing all the way. ("Hammer to Fall") At the Seven Seas of Rhye pub in Montreaux, Pop the {{librarian}} is serving drinks to the lifeless Bohemians. ("These <b>Are</b> <b>the</b> <b>Days</b> <b>of</b> Our Lives") When Galileo and Scaramouche arrive, Pop explains the full nature of the prophecy to them as inscribed by the three remaining members of the band Queen just before they were sentenced to death (Brian May, his last request being a final guitar solo, apparently delayed his execution {{for three and a half}} days). Scaramouche figures out that the bright shining star of the prophecy is rock star Freddie Mercury's statue, and that it's pointing to Wembley Stadium, the [...] "place of living rock". After initially preparing to travel by bicycle, (opening of [...] "Bicycle Race") Scaramouche protests that the method [...] "isn't very cool", and so they travel there by motorcycle.

Some of his solos and orchestral parts were composed by Freddie Mercury, who then asked May to bring them to life ("Bicycle Race", [...] "Lazing on a Sunday Afternoon", [...] "Killer Queen", [...] "Good Old Fashioned Lover Boy"). May also performed notable acoustic works, including the acoustic guitar live version of [...] "Love of My Life" [...] from 1975's A Night at the Opera, the finger-picked solo of [...] "White Queen" [...] and the skiffle-influenced [...] "'39".|$|E
