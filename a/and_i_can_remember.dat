2500|$|In Running Rugby Mark Ella {{writes of}} Campese's debut that, [...] "Campese played his first Test on that tour. The match was at Christchurch, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>remember</b> the {{occasion}} very clearly. Until that match, Stu Wilson of New Zealand reigned as the world's champion winger, but I think his reign ended that day. Campese {{turned it on}} with the goose-step and trumped Wilson completely. We all knew then that someone really special had come on the scene.|$|E
2500|$|Commenting on his victory, he said: [...] "I {{just want}} to {{dedicate}} this championship to my family, and all my close friends who have supported me through my career. Spain is not a country with an F1 culture, {{and we had to}} fight alone, every step of the way, to make this happen. A huge thank-you should also go to the team as well– they are the best in Formula One, and we have done this together. It will say that I am world champion, but we are all champions– and they deserve this." [...] In the May 2007 issue of F1 Racing, Alonso said that the 2005 Brazilian Grand Prix was his greatest race. He said, [...] "It was a dream come true and a very emotional day. In the last few laps I leaped, thinking I could hear noises from the engine- from everywhere! But all was okay <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>remember</b> my relief when I crossed the finish line." ...|$|E
2500|$|Smith was {{encouraged}} to move to Warwickshire County Cricket Club in 1957 {{to take over the}} captaincy. In the 1950s an amateur had to captain the county and Warwickshire had no capable amateurs. Despite wearing steel-rimmed spectacles Smith was a heavy run-maker in County cricket and passed 2,000 runs a season each year from 1957 to 1962, including 3,245 runs (57.94) in 1959. Fred Trueman thought [...] "there is probably nobody in the world who plays the off-spinner better", but Smith's fragility against fast bowling meant that he could not hold down a regular place in the Test team. It was not his only failing as 'Mike is widely remembered...as a very unreliable runner between the wickets. Warwickshire tales of woe in this respect are numerous <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>remember</b> a call between them in 1964 going something like [...] "No A.C." [...] – Yes, Mike" [...] – Wait A.C." [...] – [...] "Damn it, Mike" [...] – [...] "Sorry A.C." [...] He was, however, a mantis-like close fielder who took a record 593 catches for Warwickshire and 53 catches in 50 Tests for England. His outwardly nonchalant captaincy hid a good cricketing brain and he took a rebuilt Warwickshire side to third, fourth and second place in the County Championship in 1962–64.|$|E

60|$|It was in {{the early}} spring, about the middle of August, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> even <b>remember</b> that it was windy weather and bitterly cold for the time of year, when the old dog was {{approaching}} his end.|$|R
6000|$|... 'No,' said she; 'the {{light is}} bad, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>remember</b> it well enough, word for word, flourishes and all.' We {{could not be}} choosers in the circumstances, and she began.|$|E
6000|$|... 'They are our masters,' {{answered}} the yard-dog. 'Really {{people who have}} only been in the world one day know very little.' That's the conclusion I have come to. Now I have age and wisdom; I know everyone in the house, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>remember</b> a time when I was not lying here in a cold kennel. Bow-wow!' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, I understand. Afterwards, {{when you}} heard they had got him. Don't I know how one feels after losing a comrade in the good fight? One's ashamed of being left. <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>remember</b> so many. Never mind. They shall be avenged before long. And what is death? At any rate, {{it is not a}} shameful thing like some kinds of life." ...|$|E
60|$|The hotel (a very {{excellent}} one) {{is called}} the Tremont House. It has more galleries, colonnades, piazzas, <b>and</b> passages than <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>remember,</b> or the reader would believe.|$|R
50|$|At {{the age of}} {{fourteen}} I had to leave school and give all my thoughts to the more serious side of life. Yet, strange to relate, it was after I had started working as a “tiler” and dropped some of my old school pals that I took up football. The place where I learned the game properly was Knighton, Radnorshire, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> well <b>remember</b> a piece of ground where we youngsters used to practice.|$|R
5000|$|... "I want {{to impress}} upon {{you that this}} Rainey's Creek country is level prairie, fine black land, owned by Germans. Gus <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> well <b>remember</b> when it was the {{greatest}} country, socially, in the world. The boys and girls who were raised there have proved to be the very highest type of manhood and womanhood. No one ever heard of trouble with the old settlers, that is, between themselves. Then we visited and loved each other and lived peaceably with all mankind.|$|R
60|$|Well! it {{was three}} days ago, and as bitterly cold as {{anything}} that my man <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>remember.</b> We had no travellers staying in the house, for we are a good three leagues out of Calais, and too far for the folk who have business in or about the harbour. Only at midday the coffee-room would get full sometimes with people {{on their way to}} or from the port.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>remember</b> {{that they}} had a mutiny on the old brig Chesterfield because Captain Roe's wife brought a cross-eyed yellow cat on board," [...] added Grandon. [...] "Not a man would hoist a sail until that feline was put ashore. And when, two months later, the brig lost her {{foremast}} in a gale, the sailors said it was on account of that same cat, she having scratched the mast before she was taken away!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "How happy I was in {{the first}} days that {{followed}} our marriage, and how happy I made him! Only two months have passed, and that time is a by-gone time already! I try to think of anything I might have said or done wrongly, on my side--of anything he might have said or done wrongly, on his; <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>remember</b> nothing unworthy of my husband, nothing unworthy of myself. I cannot even lay my finger on the day when the cloud first rose between us.|$|E
5000|$|He {{was also}} a {{lecturer}} at the University of Leipzig and a master at Shrewsbury School. There he taught Martin Wainwright, who has recalled that [...] "Frank McEachran stood us on chairs at school reciting poetry we’d learned by heart. Probably child abuse these days, but he called it Spells <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> still <b>remember</b> them all." [...] He is remembered in Shrewsbury School through the McEachran room in the English faculty where the student-run Creative Writing Society meets, some still influenced by his writings.|$|R
60|$|The {{congregation}} {{being fully}} assembled, now, {{the bell rang}} once more, to warn laggards and stragglers, and then a solemn hush fell upon the church which was only broken by the tittering and whispering of the choir in the gallery. The choir always tittered and whispered all through service. There was once a church choir that was not ill-bred, but I have forgotten where it was, now. It was a great many years ago, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> scarcely <b>remember</b> anything about it, but I {{think it was in}} some foreign country.|$|R
60|$|TWO {{or three}} miles from Cairo, {{approached}} by an avenue of sycamores, is Shoubra, a favourite residence of the Pasha of Egypt. The palace, {{on the banks of}} the Nile, is not remarkable for its size or splendour, but the gardens are extensive and beautiful, and adorned by a kiosk, which is one of the most elegant <b>and</b> fanciful creations <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>remember.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "'My poor grandmother, {{whenever}} I spoke upon such a subject, {{would break}} {{out into a}} thousand gibes and sarcasms, and point to many of our friends who had made love-matches, and were quarrelling now as fiercely {{as though they had}} never loved each other. You remember that dreadful case in France Duc de ----, who murdered his duchess? That was a love-match, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>remember</b> the sort of screech with which Lady Kew used to speak about it; and of the journal which the poor duchess kept, and in which she noted down all her husband's ill-behaviour.'" ...|$|E
60|$|The room {{in which}} we found {{ourselves}} was clean, but extremely bare. A rather old-fashioned secretaire stood by the wall, with a chair drawn to the desk; in one corner was a shelf with half-a-dozen law-books; <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>remember</b> literally not another stick of furniture. One inference imposed itself: Mr. Bellairs was {{in the habit of}} sitting down himself and suffering his clients to stand. At the far end, and veiled by a curtain of red baize, a second door communicated with the interior of the house. Hence, after some coughing and stamping, we elicited the shyster, who came timorously forth, {{for all the world like}} a man in fear of bodily assault, and then, recognising his guests, suffered from what I can only call a nervous paroxysm of courtesy.|$|E
6000|$|... "Why, Miss Effingham, {{the people}} will rule; and it is useless to pretend {{to tell them that}} they shall not have the highest seats in the church {{as well as in the}} state. Really, I can see no ground why a parson should be raised above his parishioners. The new-order churches consult the public convenience, and place every body on a level, as it might be. Now, in old times, a family was buried in its pew; it could neither see nor be seen; <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>remember</b> the time when I could just get a look of our clergyman's wig, for he was an old-school man; and as for his fellow-creatures, one might as well be praying in his own closet. I must say I am a {{supporter}} of liberty, if it be only in pews." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "She {{was always}} arrogant <b>and</b> always hard. <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>remember</b> her just the same; {{but that was}} so many years ago. She left Bragton then because she could not banish his mother from the house. But to bear it all in her heart so long is not like a human being,--let alone a woman. What {{did he say to}} you going home yesterday?" ...|$|R
5000|$|The Science of Getting Rich was {{credited}} by Rhonda Byrne {{as one of}} the inspirations for her popular 2006 film and 2007 book The Secret. As Byrne explained it on the web site of Oprah Winfrey, [...] "Something inside of me had me turn the pages one by one, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> still <b>remember</b> my tears hitting the pages as I was reading it. ... It gave me a glimpse of The Secret. It was like a flame inside of my heart. And with every day since, it's just become a raging fire of wanting to share all of this with the world." ...|$|R
60|$|This {{was during}} the period of the halt at Bloemfontein. <b>I</b> <b>can</b> well <b>remember</b> that then and for long {{afterwards}} the consideration which was shown upon this point seemed to those who were at the spot to be exaggerated <b>and</b> absurd. <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>remember</b> that when we applied for leave to use the deserted villas to put our sick soldiers into--the hospitals being full--we were told that it could only be done by private treaty with the owners, who were at that time on commando against us. I remember also suggesting that the corrugated-iron fencing round the cricket field should be used for making huts, and being told that it was impossible, as it was private property.|$|R
60|$|But at {{that time}} I {{overlooked}} one problem of great importance; and it is astonishing to me, except {{on the principle of}} Columbus and his egg, how I could have overlooked it and its solution. This problem is the tendency in organic beings descended from the same stock to diverge in character as they become modified. That they have diverged greatly is obvious from the manner in which species of all kinds can be classed under genera, genera under families, families under sub-orders and so forth; <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>remember</b> the very spot in the road, whilst in my carriage, when to my joy the solution occurred to me; and this was long after I had come to Down. The solution, as I believe, is that the modified offspring of all dominant and increasing forms tend to become adapted to many and highly diversified places in the economy of nature.|$|E
6000|$|He {{suffered}} from insomnia, and some doctor, {{while he was}} still at the University, had recommended alcohol, and he had, in a vain hope of sleep, increased the amount, as Rossetti had increased his doses of chloral, and now he drank for drinking's sake. He drank a great deal too much, and, though nothing could, it seemed, disturb his calm or unsteady his hand or foot, his doctrine, after a certain number of glasses, would become more ascetic, more contemptuous of all that we call human life. I have heard him, after four or five glasses of wine, praise some church father who freed himself from sexual passion by a surgical operation, and deny with scorn, and much historical evidence, that a gelded man lost anything of intellectual power. Even without stimulant his theology conceded nothing to human weakness, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>remember</b> his saying with energy, [...] "I wish those people who deny the eternity of punishment could realise their unspeakable vulgarity." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I can quite {{understand}} that," [...] papa said. [...] "Mr. Harmer lived {{a long time}} in India, where the night and early morning are the pleasantest part of the twenty-four hours, and I have heard him say that he often rose at four o'clock, and got through five hours' writing before breakfast; <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>remember</b> now that I once said to him that he must find it very cold in winter, and he said, 'Oh, I have a very snug little place for it.' I did not ask him where it was, although I dare say had I done so he would have told me. But it is evident now that it was in this chamber, which from its warmth, and from it so immediately adjoining his room, would be very convenient for him, as he would not be under any fear of disturbing the house by his movements. I have no doubt you are correct in your conjecture, and that there is some secret receptacle there for papers, which could never be discovered without the secret being communicated." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Ay," [...] said she, [...] "this {{world has}} queer changes. <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>remember</b> the old mill being built--the very {{first it was}} in all the district; <b>and</b> then <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>remember</b> it being pulled down, and going with my lake-lasses [companions] to see the foundation-stone of the new one laid. The two Mr. Moores made a great stir about it. They were there, and a deal of fine folk besides, and both their ladies; very bonny and grand they looked. But Mrs. Louis was the grandest; she always wore such {{handsome}} dresses. Mrs. Robert was quieter like. Mrs. Louis smiled when she talked. She had a real, happy, glad, good-natured look; but she had een that pierced a body through. There is no such ladies nowadays." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Hope! yea," [...] said Mary, with {{a ray of}} {{brightness}} on her face, [...] "but not earthly hope. That is over, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> am more at rest <b>and</b> peace than <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>remember</b> to {{have been}} since I was a babe at my mother's knee.

5000|$|English author Graham Greene in {{a review}} of the film for The Spectator {{magazine}} asserted: [...] "One of the most exciting <b>and</b> moving films <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>remember</b> seeing".

It also shares many similarities with the American film, Casablanca, released a few years later.|$|R
6000|$|... "This {{is what he}} says, father: 'You {{know that}} I told you a trooper in my company {{recognised}} me. I fancied I knew the man's face, but could not recall where I had seen it. The other day it suddenly flashed upon me; he {{is the son of}} a little farmer upon my cousin's estate, a {{man by the name of}} Forester. I often saw him when he was a young fellow, for I was fond of fishing, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>remember</b> him as a boy who was generally fishing down in the mill-stream. I fancy he rather went to grief afterwards, and have some idea he was mixed up in a poaching business in the Carne woods. So I think he must have left the country about that time. Curious, isn't it, his running against me here? However, it cannot be helped. I suppose it will all come out, sooner or later, for he has been in the guardroom several times for drunkenness, and one of these times he will be sure to blurt it out.'" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, it's soothin' t' the cough, and {{it builds}} ye up, every ways. Why, my brother," [...] {{continued}} the factotum, [...] "he died of consumption when I was a boy,--reg'lar old New England consumption. Don't hardly {{ever hear of}} it any more, round here. Well, I don't suppose there's been a case of reg'lar old New England consumption--well, not the old New England kind--since these woods growed up. He used to take whiskey with white-pine chips in it; <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>remember</b> hearin 'em say that it done him more good than all the doctor's stuff.

6000|$|... "Reginald Musgrave {{had been}} in the same college as myself, and I had some slight {{acquaintance}} with him. He was not generally popular among the undergraduates, though it always seemed to me that what was set down as pride was really an attempt to cover extreme natural diffidence. In appearance {{he was a man of}} exceedingly aristocratic type, thin, high-nosed, and large-eyed, with languid and yet courtly manners. He was indeed a scion of one of the very oldest families in the kingdom, though his branch was a cadet one which had separated from the northern Musgraves some time in the sixteenth century, and had established itself in western Sussex, where the Manor House of Hurlstone is perhaps the oldest inhabited building in the county. Something of his birth place seemed to cling to the man, and I never looked at his pale, keen face or the poise of his head without associating him with gray archways and mullioned windows and all the venerable wreckage of a feudal keep. Once or twice we drifted into talk, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>remember</b> that more than once he expressed a keen interest in my methods of observation and inference.|$|E
