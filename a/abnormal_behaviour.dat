25|$|The product {{information}} leaflet distributed with isotretinoin states that rare psychological side effects may include depression, worsening of pre-existing depression, aggressive tendencies and anxiety. Very rare effects include <b>abnormal</b> <b>behaviour,</b> psychosis, suicidal ideation, suicide attempts and suicide. In {{a total of}} 5577 adverse reactions reported to the UK's MHRA up to 31 March 2017, the majority (1207, or 22%) concerned psychiatric effects. There were 85 reports of suicidal ideation, 56 of completed suicide and 43 of suicide attempts. Isotretinoin is the only non-psychiatric drug on the FDA's top 10 list of drugs associated with depression and is also within the top 10 for suicide attempts.|$|E

500|$|At that time, {{bubonic plague}} {{was a much}} feared disease but its cause was not understood. The credulous blamed emanations from the earth, [...] "pestilential effluviums", unusual weather, {{sickness}} in livestock, <b>abnormal</b> <b>behaviour</b> of animals or {{an increase in the}} numbers of moles, frogs, mice or flies. It was not until 1894 that the identification by Alexandre Yersin of its causal agent Yersinia pestis was made and the transmission of the bacterium by rat fleas became known. Although the Great Plague in London had long been believed to be bubonic plague caused by Yersinia pestis, this was only definitively confirmed by DNA analysis in 2016.|$|E
500|$|The exact {{cause of}} HSP is unknown, {{but most of}} its {{features}} are due to the deposition of abnormal antibodies in the wall of blood vessels, leading to vasculitis. These antibodies are of the subclass IgA1 in polymers; it is uncertain whether the main cause is overproduction (in the digestive tract or the bone marrow) or decreased removal of abnormal IgA from the circulation. It is suspected that abnormalities in the IgA1 molecule may provide an explanation for its <b>abnormal</b> <b>behaviour</b> in both HSP and the related condition IgA nephropathy. One {{of the characteristics of}} IgA1 (and IgD) is the presence of an 18 amino acid-long [...] "hinge region" [...] between complement-fixating regions 1 and 2. Of the amino acids, half is proline, while the others are mainly serine and threonine. The majority of the serines and the threonines have elaborate sugar chains, connected through oxygen atoms (O-glycosylation). This process is thought to stabilise the IgA molecule and make it less prone to proteolysis. The first sugar is always N-acetyl-galactosamine (GalNAc), followed by other galactoses and sialic acid. In HSP and IgAN, these sugar chains appear to be deficient. The exact reason for these abnormalities is not known.|$|E

2500|$|During Shepherd’s career, {{he wrote}} and co-authored over 30 books and around 200 {{original}} articles including the five volumes of the Handbook of Psychiatry. However, perhaps his finest literary legacy was the establishment {{of what has been}} described as [...] "arguably the finest psychiatric journal in the English-speaking world", the journal Psychological Medicine. He was the founding editor of Psychological Medicine from 1969 until 1993. It {{is interesting to note that}} he favoured the term [...] "Psychological Medicine" [...] over [...] "Psychiatry" [...] and he attached great importance to the title which he resurrected from the Journal of Psychological Medicine, first conceived by Forbes Winslow. He defined psychological medicine as including not only psychiatry but also the study of <b>abnormal</b> <b>behaviour</b> from the medical point of view. He aimed to concentrate on original high-quality work across the wide spectrum of both psychiatry and its allied disciplines and contributed extensively himself investing much time and care towards its success. According to his successor, Psychological Medicine was to become perhaps his greatest and most enduring creation set in an academic and research career which was already highly distinguished.|$|E

50|$|Researchers have {{analyzed}} ways {{to alleviate}} some <b>abnormal</b> <b>behaviours</b> in caged birds.

5000|$|It is most {{comfortable}} {{for people to}} engage in behaviour which conforms to their own personal habitual norms.

A parasomnia in association with his possible neurological disorder was suspected and a referral made to the sleep disorders clinic. Further investigation with polysomnography determined that the <b>abnormal</b> <b>behaviours</b> during the night were secondary to arousals caused by obstructive sleep apnoea. Treatment with continuous positive airways pressure therapy prevented the <b>abnormal</b> <b>behaviours</b> at night, improved his daytime sleepiness but also led to improvements in his clumsiness, short-term memory and temper, all corroborated by his wife...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} was to provide a {{longitudinal}} evaluation of the effects of physical enrichments on the behaviour and physiology of intensive stock-farming pigs. Twenty-eight crossbred pigs of both sexes, were exposed to four types of enrichments (hemp ropes, steel chains, plastic balls, rubber hoses) over a period of eleven weeks. This investigation was based on specific <b>abnormal</b> <b>behaviours</b> and physiological indicators, including hematologic parameters. For behavioural score, focal sampling was used with recording of <b>abnormal</b> <b>behaviours</b> (body-, tail- and ear-biting), belly nosing, running, and interaction with objects (for Enriched pigs). The presence of skin injuries was also recorded. In general, the frequency of <b>abnormal</b> <b>behaviours</b> was significantly reduced in the Enriched group. A timerelated profile appeared {{in the use of the}} enrichments. Males showed higher occurrence of skin injuries than females. Physiological measurements, such as levels of complement system, white blood cells and neutrophils, were lower in pigs from the Enriched group. Enriched pigs, as a whole, presented much lower levels of serum DHEA-S concentration over two weeks. The findings of this study show the successful provision of appropriate enrichments to encourage behaviours which may result in satisfactory animal oral interaction with the enriching objects, preventing them biting pen-mates. In this respect, the objects proposed were strongly effective in producing changes in behaviour which could mitigate inadequate conditions, such as the relationship between animal body weight and the available space allowance...|$|R
