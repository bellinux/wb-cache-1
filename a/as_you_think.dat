You have a right to elect whom you please; vote for the man you think best, and I think, when that is done, that you and I are freemen. Do as you consider right and honest in electing men for office. I did not come here to make you a long speech, although invited to do so by you. I am not much of a speaker, and my business prevented me from preparing myself. I came to meet you as friends, and welcome you to the white people. I want you to come nearer to us. When I can serve you I will do so. We have but one flag, one country; let us stand together. We may differ in color, but not in sentiment. Use your best judgment in selecting men for office and vote <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> right.|$|E
500|$|Those who won our {{independence}} [...] [...] [...] {{believed that}} freedom to think {{as you will}} and to speak <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> are means indispensable to the discovery and spread of political truth; that without free speech and assembly discussion would be futile; that with them, discussion affords ordinarily adequate protection against the dissemination of noxious doctrine; that the greatest menace to freedom is an inert people; that public discussion is a political duty; and that {{this should be a}} fundamental principle of the American government.|$|E

500|$|The hit single [...] "Basket Case", which {{appeared}} on many singles charts worldwide, was also inspired by Armstrong's personal experiences. The song deals with Armstrong's anxiety attacks {{and feelings of}} [...] "going crazy" [...] prior to being diagnosed with a panic disorder. [...] In the third verse, [...] "Basket Case" [...] references soliciting a male prostitute; Armstrong noted that [...] "I wanted to challenge myself and whoever the listener might be. It's also {{looking at the world}} and saying, 'It's not as black and white <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>think.</b> This isn't your grandfather's prostitute – or maybe it was.'" [...] The music video was filmed in an abandoned mental institution. This is one of the band's most popular songs.|$|E
500|$|The British fleet weighed anchor at Cape Fear on May 31, {{and arrived}} outside Charleston Harbor the next day. Moultrie noticed a British scout boat {{apparently}} looking for possible landing points on nearby Long Island (now {{known as the}} Isle of Palms), {{just a few hundred}} yards from Sullivan's Island; troops were consequently sent to occupy the northern end of Sullivan's. By June 8, most of the British fleet had crossed the bar and anchored in Five Fathom Hole, an anchorage between the bar and the harbor entrance. With the fort on Sullivan's Island only half complete, Admiral Parker expressed confidence that his warships would easily breach its walls. Optimistically believing he would not even need Clinton's land forces, he wrote to Clinton that after the fort's guns were knocked out, he would [...] "land seamen and marines (which I have practiced for the purpose) under the guns" [...] and that they could [...] "keep possession till you send as many troops <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> proper".|$|E
500|$|As such, {{executive}} producer and writer Russell T Davies {{had to come}} up with a story that had a good reason to keep the Doctor and Rose out. Davies was inspired by the Buffy the Vampire Slayer episode [...] "The Zeppo" [...] and the [...] episode [...] "Lower Decks", both of which focused on atypical characters. Davies described the episode, [...] "It's an experimental script. Not so experimental that people will run away screaming from Saturday-night BBC1, because you can experiment too much. People still want a bit of a monster and a bit of a thrill and a bit of the Doctor, so it still delivers as normal Doctor Who. But just <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> you know everything this programme can do, this puts a little bit of spin on it." [...] The episode had the working title of [...] "I Love the Doctor". The acronym [...] "LINDA" [...] was previously used on the British children's television programme Why Don't You?, which featured the [...] "Liverpool Investigation 'N' Detective Agency". Russell T Davies worked on the series for some years.|$|E

2500|$|Moving Pictures is {{the second}} webcomic created by Kathryn and Stuart Immonen, who both had {{experience}} creating comic books together for Marvel Comics. The pair's first webcomic, Never as Bad <b>as</b> <b>You</b> <b>Think,</b> is a comedic slapstick comic strip with little to no story. Greg Burgas of Comic Book Resources noted the difference in tone between the Never as Bad <b>as</b> <b>You</b> <b>Think</b> and Moving Pictures, the latter taking on a much darker subject matter and more complex story. The two webcomics share a [...] "sharp" [...] artstyle, with characters being rendered as [...] "skinny and pointy".|$|E
2500|$|Lewis {{ended up}} the last male {{contestant}} standing, despite Simon's first impression that the singer was a bit [...] "over the top" [...] adding [...] "I don't know if you're as good <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> you are". [...] But soon afterward, the judges began predicting Lewis' [...] "front runner" [...] status. In {{an exclusive interview with}} [...] on March 4, 2007, Simon Cowell foresaw Lewis' chance to take the crown. After Lewis' performance of [...] "Lovesong" [...] by The Cure/311 on March 27, Paula Abdul said that she would love to see him in the finale. Cowell further confirmed that Lewis was the front runner of male contestants on American Idol. Lewis, upon entering the top 2 on May 16, 2007, he thus became the first ever contestant from the Northwestern United States (specifically, Washington) to compete in the finale.|$|E

2500|$|Edith Grossman, {{who wrote}} and {{published}} a highly acclaimed English {{translation of the}} novel in 2003, says that the book is mostly meant to move people into emotion using a systematic change of course, {{on the verge of}} both tragedy and comedy at the same time. Grossman has stated:The question is that Quixote has multiple interpretations [...] and how do I deal with that in my translation. I'm going to answer your question by avoiding it [...] so when I first started reading the Quixote I thought it was the most tragic book in the world, and I would read it and weep [...] As I grew older [...] my skin grew thicker [...] and so when I was working on the translation I was actually sitting at my computer and laughing out loud. This is done [...] as Cervantes did it [...] by never letting the reader rest. You are never certain that you truly got it. Because as soon <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> you understand something, Cervantes introduces something that contradicts your premise.|$|E
2500|$|On November 10, 1961, she {{received}} a Doctor Honoris Causa in Historical Sciences by Moscow State University for her contributions {{to the development of}} Marxist theory. In her acceptance speech she asserted that class struggle is the motor of history. In 1962 she attended the 10th Congress of the Italian Communist Party held December 2–8 in Rome where she met Socialists, Christian-Democrats and some church representatives. To the clerics she remarked, [...] "We are not as wicked <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>think,</b> and we are not as good as we probably think we are." [...] During {{the first few months of}} 1963 Ibárruri unsuccessfully appealed for the Spanish government to spare the life of executive committee member Julián Grimau. Before his execution Grimau wrote to Ibárruri saying, [...] "My execution will be the last one." [...] On the week of May 13 Ibárruri unveiled a plaque in his honour on Building 11, Block 1, of newly renamed Grimau Street in Moscow. On December 5 she arrived in Havana to commemorate the 5th anniversary of the Cuban Revolution. [...] Cuban leader Fidel Castro invited Ibárruri to move permanently to the island, but she declined.|$|E
2500|$|A lighter {{incident}} occurred regarding that accusation during the Nebraska primary campaign. [...] The state's former governor, Frank Morrison, who was actively campaigning for McGovern, sought {{to counter the}} Jackson and Humphrey campaigns' effective use of the accusation. [...] During a campaign speech, Morrison declared, [...] "They say that George McGovern is for the legalization of marijuana, but I say --" [...] At this point there was thunderous applause from the younger people in the audience, which left Morrison puzzled, but when it died down, he finished, [...] "I tell you that George McGovern does not advocate the legalization of marijuana." [...] This produced cries of disappointment in the audience. [...] He continued, [...] "They say George McGovern is for abortion on demand, but I tell you--" [...] Again there was deafening applause, followed by sighs of regret when he finished the sentence: [...] "But I {{say to you that}} George McGovern is against tampering with our state laws on abortion." [...] Afterwards, Morrison confessed to McGovern, [...] "Maybe I'm too old to understand this new generation. [...] I'll get the oldsters for you, and you take care of the young ones <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> best." [...] McGovern won the Nebraska primary.|$|E
