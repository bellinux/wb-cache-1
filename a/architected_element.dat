Eliminating side abutments of the warship hall, the architect tried to create most solid and monumental interior. For creating the same size of three halls of the mosque, the architect with specific artistic-plastic expressiveness conceived non-traditional construction, the metallic carcasses of which were produced in Warsaw for Shirvan zone of the cupola. For strengthening significance of the composition, Plośko developed high multiple-window lodgement to which the central cupola leaned on. There should be four decorative minarets around it.

40|$|As {{the pace}} of {{business}} accelerates, enterprises are increasingly responding to customer demands in real time. To accomplish this feat, many IT departments have turned to service-oriented architecture (SOA). SOA {{is designed to help}} decrease development expenses and risk of application failures, increase asset reuse and enhance business agility. SOA is a way of building enterprise systems out of reusable business logic that perform discrete functions and can be reused across the organization for differ-ent purposes, allowing developers to create composite applications by invok-ing and orchestrating multiple services, events and models so they collectively perform a higher-order business process. The benefits of using service registries and repositories in an SOA environment are compelling: • Increased asset reuse. Asset reuse can help increase the flexibility of a company’s IT infrastructure by reducing reliance on monolithic applications, which are not easily modified or reused in new ways. • Enhanced compliance. Many companies currently lack the visibility to determine their level of compliance with external regulations and internal business guidelines. However, because assets are listed in registries with the SOA approach, SOA can make it easier for administrators to keep an accurate inventory of existing assets, collect metrics and enforce operational policies. • Improved efficiency. Web services can help enforce coding standards, facilitate communication and minimize the duplication of efforts within large, geographically dispersed organizations. However, many of the potential benefits of an SOA depend on the way it is implemented. Because an SOA environment consists of multiple “services ” that can be configured to interact in a variety of ways, it is critical that IT <b>architects</b> choose <b>elements</b> and mechanisms that maximize service performance, efficiency and scalability. This paper will explore different ways to register and discover services, as well as manage the services lifecycle. It will outline two potential approaches for config-uring an SOA environment and explain TIBCO’s recommended approach. u d d i A n d b e Y O n...|$|R

40|$|Societal {{appreciation}} of architecture, {{the environment and}} the role of design & planning professionals should begin early in the educational stream. Working from this premise, a model was developed which relied on a combination of learning strategies: Cognitive, Psychomotor and Affective. The projectis primary goal was to build knowledge of architecture and the environment in K- 12 children, with particular emphasis on primary levels. More specifically, the ARCH was selected thematically as a strong architectonic element through which to promote a better connection with and responsibility for the environment. The educational experience comprised three sequential forms: visual history of the ARCH, physical construction using foam blocks, and finally “construction” in the computer using a multi-media interactive three-dimensionally focused program. Pedagogically the sequencing provided explanation and context, built awareness through making, and finally reinforced the lessons of the previous steps while highlighting the potential of information technology. To deliver the curriculum an installation was built at a local museum, with primary grade children arriving on field trips. Architecture faculty and students designed the curriculum and installation, including the computer modules. Secondary school students were trained, with the intention that they would in turn educate primary school students at the installation. In disseminating knowledge downwards through the various educational levels, awareness was promoted concerning the <b>architects</b> role, architectural <b>elements,</b> and the broader built environment.

40|$|The term "mass-customization" in the Architecture, Engineering and Construction (AEC) {{industry}} {{refers to}} architectural elements that have similar purpose but are {{completely different from}} each other. <b>Architects</b> use mass-customized <b>elements</b> to give diverse design to different parts of a building. Mass-customization derives from three developments in computational technology: Building Information Modeling (BIM), the implications of programing in graphical representation, and the progress of computer-controlled manufacturing machines. However, the promise held by these technologies has not been fulfilled. While mass-customization is implemented in projects with large budgets, they are rarely employed in mainstream real estate. This thesis examines two multi-family projects: The Project on 8 Spruce Street and the Porter House, both located in Manhattan, to outline the challenges of executing commercial real estate projects that employ mass-customized envelope systems and makes suggestions {{as to how to}} overcome them. The thesis then examines the aircraft manufacturing industry, which is proficient in the use of Building Information Modeling and has advanced logistical expertise in transporting large-scale elements. The thesis examines its use of design and assembly processes such as Concurrent Engineering and Lean Manufacturing, and suggests that these techniques can be incorporated into the project delivery methods of the AEC industry. The thesis focuses on the production of fuselage and metallic wing skin panels, distinguishing between fabrication technologies that are used for the manufacturing of single-curved and double-curved panels. The thesis proposes ways in which these processes can be adapted to the standards of the Architecture, Engineering and Construction industry, and suggests that such adaptation could reduce fabrication costs. The thesis concludes by outlining the incentives for the aircraft industry to transition part of its operation into the fabrication of mass-customized envelopes for commercial real estate, pointing to the potential markets for such systems in the growing economies of China, Latin America and India. This thesis attempts to demonstrate the potential of utilizing features of the aircraft manufacturing industry so as to improve cooperation between all parties involved in the process of commercial real estate development and to create more beautiful and valuable buildings. by Shaul Goldklang.

50|$|The Rose City Golf Clubhouse, {{located at}} 2200 NE 71st Avenue in Portland, Oregon, is {{significant}} under “Criterion A,” Entertainment and Recreation, {{as the second}} municipal golf course established in Oregon and the oldest surviving example of a municipal golf clubhouse in Portland. The Clubhouse is significant {{at the local level}} as a recreational facility that is integral with the sport of golf’s rise in popularity with the general public during the period in which it was developed. The Clubhouse is the physical and social focal point for this golf course. Constructed in 1931 and 1932, the clubhouse was designed by Portland architect Herbert A. Angell and constructed by general contractor B. T. Allyn. It was built as the main facility for the Rose City Golf Course. The course was designed by landscape architect George H. Otten and constructed between 1922 and 1927. The exterior of the clubhouse is in good condition and maintains a high degree of integrity. It has seen few changes since its opening in 1932. The interior has been heavily remodeled over the years. This has resulted in the loss of historic fabric and materials. Several historic features remain, however, and the basic configuration and orientation of the floor plan is in place. The Rose City Golf Clubhouse is significant under Criterion A for its association with recreation in Portland, specifically as the clubhouse for a municipal golf course. Constructed in 1931-1932, the building expresses the efforts of golfers in Northeast Portland to organize the community and municipality to finance a recreational facility {{in the early years of}} the Great Depression. The construction of the Rose City Golf Clubhouse occurred at a time when golf became widely popular among middle class patrons in the United States. No longer a game for the elite, the Rose City Golf Clubhouse served as a surrogate home for Portland’s growing middle class. Herbert A. Angell’s clubhouse design reflected national trends in clubhouse architecture, with many <b>architects</b> adopting specific <b>elements</b> for golf clubhouses. These elements, as reflected in the Rose City Golf Clubhouse, included the adoption of revival architectural styles and designs that mirrored residential structures. The Rose City Golf Clubhouse was the second municipal clubhouse constructed in Portland, following the 1922 construction of a clubhouse for the Eastmoreland Golf Course. The Eastmoreland clubhouse was demolished in the 1980s, making the Rose City Golf Clubhouse the oldest surviving municipal golf clubhouse in the city, and the oldest known example of such a facility in Oregon.

40|$|Palače Frana Gundulića i Tome Stjepovića Skočibube u Dubrovniku jedini su sačuvani primjeri stambene arhitekture polovice XVI. stoljeća kod kojih se javljaju oblici renesansnog klasicizma. Analizom njihovih pročelja pokazuje se da su graditelji Antun iz Padove i Jeronim Catani iz Ankone, te klesar Dujam Rudičić iz Splita primijenili elemente klasičnih redova, ali su u odnosu na stroga pravila klasicizma uočena i neka odstupanja. In {{the second}} half of the 15 c and the first half of the 16 c the {{establishment}} of the Renaissance style, much more evident of facades than in the interiors of residential architecture, shows certain limitations and a slower reception of classical forms. From the begining of the XVI century, classical Renaissance concepts, leaning on first hand knowledge of ancient monuments, but equally so on Vitruvius 2 ̆ 7 texts, fixed rules are stipulated regarding the application of elements from classical architecture. The architects in Bramente 2 ̆ 7 s circle diused them from Rome throughout Italy. The arrival of two Italian architects in dubrovnik in the middle of the 16 c should be seen in the same context, On the facades of two palaces they demonstrated the knowledge of classical forms and tried their hand at the application of classical orders. The construction of the palace of Fran Gundulić was started in 1546 by Jeronim Gatani from Ancona and Dujam Rudičić from Split. The large three-storey corner building (partially preserved) had bugnato-framed portals on the ground floor with characteristic of the Tuscan order; the first floor window-frames were edged in the Doric manner, the second floor ones were lonic, while the extremely high third floor windows were probably adorned with the ornaments of the Corinthian order. Just as important for the composition of the palace facade are the corners marked by bugnato up to the level of the second floor, i. e. to the garland decorated with the motif of waves. It emphasized the horizontal division of the palace, while a central axis covering a portal and the third floor windows which used to have balconies laid emphasis on tripartite facade composition. A design close to the Roman palaces of the 1520 s and 30 s accompanied by top-quality execution place this palace at the very top of Dubrovnik 2 ̆ 7 s residential architecture. The palace of Toma Stjepović Skočibuha was constructed in the 1549 - 1553 period. The design of the facade, the third floor windows in particular, was made by Anthony of Padua. In the context of Dubrovnik, a peculiarity of this palace is its plasticity and the appearance of aedicules. In addition to this, each storey of the facade, i. e. its openings, is expressed in a different order. The ground floor portal is framed by Doric aedicule. The first floor has lonic windows, the second again repeats Doric aedicules as window-frames, while the third floor aedicules on the high windows bear the traits of the Composite order. The <b>architect</b> used <b>elements</b> of a classical repertoire, yet this superposition of orders deviates from Vitruvius 2 ̆ 7 strict rules: after the Doric and lonic order, the Doric one is used again, followed by the composite order. The design of the multi-storey facade did not come from Roman, but rather from Venetian architecture. This also refers to the plasticity, a result of thickly set aedicules, and to a "free" use of orders. The analysis of proportions shows that on both buildings the ratio of the upper and the lower part of the facade to be 1 :P 2. Supposing Skočibuha 2 ̆ 7 s palace was ment to have one additional bay, then the height of both facades was identical to their width. Analysing the way the modula system is applied to the aediculae one can conclude that Anthony of Padua did not adhere to the standards of his time; nor did he obtain a proportion of particular orders. The comparison between Italian models and these two Dubrovnik palaces points out that the builders of Gundulić palace followed the Classicist principles of facade composition and the use of orders. On the other hand, the builder of Skočibuha 2 ̆ 7 s palace obviously relied heaviliy on Serlio 2 ̆ 7 s treatise and treated Classicist traits as elements of a formal system, thus departing from Vitruvius 2 ̆ 7 rules. Yet both palaces show that Dubrovnik had mastered the classical vocabulary, grammar and syntax of Renaissance architecture...|$|R
