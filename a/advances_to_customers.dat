Bruce was arrested in Cheltenham on 21 October and was charged with {{stealing}} £75 from the creamery. He was brought back to Ireland and tried by court martial at Waterford on 22 December. Historian and author, Leeson accounts in much detail in his 2011 book Black & Tans about Bruce's trial, conviction and subsequent numerous unsuccessful appeals which led to his court martial. Leeson notes that [...] "during the trial the creamery manager admitted that he used the safe for his own money, made unrecorded cash <b>advances</b> <b>to</b> <b>customers,</b> borrowed money from the till for his own use and did not know how much was there on the day of the robbery" [...] as a result he was deemed by the judge to be an unsatisfactory witness. Leeson notes that Lieutenant Cooper testified against Bruce, stating that Bruce had organised the raid and that he went along because Bruce told him he was in the secret service; however he admitted under cross-examination that he made no such claim. Bruce was found guilty and sentence to one year in prison. His nephew was tried separately and received a sentence of three months imprisonment. Bruce was committed to Mountjoy on 28 December and transferred to Liverpool on 8 August 1921 after the truce.|$|E

40|$|MBA thesis - WBSPolicy {{makers and}} {{regulators}} {{have been concerned}} {{with the issue of}} how efficiently banks transform their various inputs into multiple financial products, because efficiency in the banking sector is considered a precondition for macroeconomic stability (Ngalande, 2003). Bank efficiency is the comparison of what is actually produced, with what can be achieved with the same consumption of resources (Farrel, 1957). Berger, Hunter and Timme (1993) reviewed the research on bank efficiency and concluded that econometric approaches are more appropriate in determining bank efficiency. The {{purpose of this study is}} to investigate bank profit efficiency and cost efficiency in South Africa and China, and to identify the differences and changes in bank efficiency between the two countries. The study uses an econometric approach to determine bank efficiency in South Africa and China. The econometric model is based on the specification developed by Battese and Coelli (1995). Bank efficiency includes profit efficiency and cost efficiency. Different models have been developed in this research. Both profit efficiency and cost efficiency were found to have remained at the same level over the period for all sampled South African and Chinese banks. <b>Advances</b> <b>to</b> <b>customers</b> and banks, investment securities and total equity were found to be the most significant variables in profit model. Deposits and current accounts owned by customers were among the least significant parameters and not an important factor in determining a bank’s profit efficiency. In the cost- efficiency frontier model, <b>advances</b> <b>to</b> <b>customers</b> and banks, as well as investment securities were the most significant variables, while total equity was least significant.

40|$|My {{dissertation}} {{is about}} joint optimization of firms' operations and marketing decisions with explicit modelling of customer behavior. It includes three essays: The first essay, ``Advance Selling [...] The Effect of Capacity and Consumer Valuation Interdependence,'' considers a seller who {{can offer a}} product twice, in advance and in spot markets. Customers strategically choose when to purchase the product. Customers' valuations may be inter-dependent and the seller decides on whether, when, and how <b>to</b> sell in <b>advance.</b> I show that customer valuation interdependence dramatically influences firms' strategy. For example, when customers' preferences are diverse, firms typically quote discounted price, but may limit the capacity available in advance. In contrast, when customers' preferences are highly correlated, firms with limited capacity can charge premium price in advance. The second essay, ``Rationing Capacity in <b>Advance</b> <b>to</b> Signal Quality,'' extends the analysis of <b>advance</b> selling <b>to</b> incorporate asymmetric information regarding product quality: firms usually have better information about products' quality in advance than customers do. I characterize firms' strategy in equilibrium and find that the asymmetry in information always hurts high-quality firms. These firms need to sacrifice some of their potential profit, by lowering price and/or limiting capacity in <b>advance,</b> <b>to</b> signal <b>to</b> <b>customers</b> their high quality. The third essay, ``Demand Shaping and Product Overselling to Better Match Supply and Demand for Assemble-to-Order Firms,'' focuses on jointly producing and marketing multiple products for assemble-to-order firms, where assembly of final products occurs only after demand arrives and takes negligible time. The key {{question is how to}} match final product demand with limited on-hand component inventory. By incorporating customers' price-based demand substitution into firms' decisions, I propose two control strategies, demand shaping and product overselling. I characterize the optimal pricing and order-acceptance policies, and evaluate the benefits of these two strategies both individually and jointly...|$|R

50|$|Goldsmiths in England {{had been}} craftsmen, bullion merchants, money changers and money lenders since the 16th century. But {{they were not}} the first to act as {{financial}} intermediates; in the early 17th century, the scriveners were the first to keep deposits {{for the express purpose of}} relending them. Merchants and traders had amassed huge hoards of gold and entrusted their wealth to the Royal Mint for storage. In 1640 King Charles I seized the private gold stored in the mint as a forced loan (which was to be paid back over time). Thereafter merchants preferred to store their gold with the goldsmiths of London, who possessed private vaults, and charged a fee for that service. In exchange for each deposit of precious metal, the goldsmiths issued receipts certifying the quantity and purity of the metal they held as a bailee (i.e. in trust). These receipts could not be assigned (only the original depositor could collect the stored goods). Gradually the goldsmiths took over the function of the scriveners of relending on behalf of a depositor and also developed modern banking practices; promissory notes were issued for money deposited which by custom and/or law was a loan to the goldsmith, i.e. the depositor expressly allowed the goldsmith to use the money for any purpose including <b>advances</b> <b>to</b> his <b>customers.</b> The goldsmith charged no fee, or even paid interest on these deposits. Since the promissory notes were payable on demand, and the <b>advances</b> (loans) <b>to</b> the goldsmith's <b>customers</b> were repayable over a longer time period, this was an early form of fractional reserve banking. The promissory notes developed into an assignable instrument, which could circulate as a safe and convenient form of money backed by the goldsmith's promise to pay. Hence goldsmiths could advance loans in the form of gold money, or in the form of promissory notes, or in the form of checking accounts. Gold deposits were relatively stable, often remaining with the goldsmith for years on end, so there was little risk of default so long as public trust in the goldsmith's integrity and financial soundness was maintained. Thus, the goldsmiths of London became the forerunners of British banking and prominent creators of new money based on credit.|$|R

When walk-in customers are more valuable, we have a variation of Littlewood (1972).

Thus, it may be better to ignore rather than pamper walk-in customers. This outcome is robust to changes in the model. Key words: Revenue management; service management; reservations. 1...|$|R

40|$|Consumentgerichte industrialisatie in de woningbouwsector is in 2004 op de belangrijkste delen vertaald naar het Engels en is opnieuw verschenen onder de titel: Mass Customisation in the {{residential}} sector. The production of components on different assembly lines in industrial production processes, which can be assembled together in various ways in order <b>to</b> fulfil <b>customers</b> individual needs under economic production conditions is known as Mass Customization (MC). MC is the logic choice of companies, operating in saturated markets. By choosing the appropriate components, a <b>customer</b> is able <b>to</b> assemble a product, which satisfies {{as much as possible}} his individual needs. In the sector of detached housing, it is very usual to offer standard budget housing types in <b>advance</b> <b>to</b> the <b>customer</b> and <b>to</b> create added value by offering him variants, which deviate from the standard type. Think e. g. of dwellings from a catalogue, where options for annexes, bay windows, various window types, balconies etc. are offered. With support of IT in combination with the current techniques of flexible production, this classic catalogue concept in the building sector can be extended to real MC concepts. Both the scope of housing types and the variety of components can strongly be enhanced by virtue of MC modelling. In his thesis on Mass Customization in the building sector dr. ir. C. C. A. M van den Thillart developped specially for the fragmented European market MC models, based on the concept of the virtual Kit. A virtual Kit consists of prefabricated candidate building components, which can be assembled to complete houses at the building site. MC concepts, based on virtual Kits, are to generate a great many housing variants, in proportion to the number of building components, which are placed in the Kit previously by different suppliers. The suppliers play the role of co-makers in the model, who make arrangements in <b>advance,</b> <b>to</b> guarantee that all the relevant components fit together and be delivered just in time at the building site. Their mutual interest is to maximise on the one hand the number of variants (both for benchmarking reasons and broadening the suitability of the MC concept for different sites) {{and on the other hand}} to minimise the number of different junctions (as a criterion for effective production). All supporting IT software programmes, such as customer's choices, costs, virtual reality systems, E-commerce and technical specifications are interconnected in the MC model and designed to economize in a simple way the whole supply chain.
