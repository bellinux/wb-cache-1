A few years ago, Jeanfils was certain to get a gift of healing by treating knee and foot sprains {{of his wife and}} himself, and was then consulted by patients in Jemeppe. Antoine and he were sued on 16 January 1907 on the grounds of illegal practice of the <b>art</b> <b>of</b> <b>healing.</b> Jeanfils explained to the court that he just wanted to do disappear the pain, and that he always sent his patients to doctors. For his part, Antoine told the judge that he simply {{put his hand on the}} forehead of patients and that he prescribed drugs; he denied the charge, and all the witnesses heard testified of the altruism of Antoine, who distributed money to the poor. Antoine and Jeanfils appeared before the Criminal Court on 15 June 1907, and the courtroom was entirely filled. Dr. Delville and the parents of a child cured by Antoine testified at the witness box, Mr. Dupret then pronounced the indictment. Adjourned, The judgment was adjourned and was finally, on 21 June 1907, President Hamoir acquitted the two men, who were absent in court then. Following an appeal by the prosecutor, Antoine and Jeanfils appeared before the Court again on 16 October 1907. The General Advocate Meyers made the indictment, analyzing the legislation of 1918 on the illegal <b>art</b> <b>of</b> <b>healing,</b> claiming that it was not what Antoine did. On 22 October of the same year, the acquittal was confirmed, and Meyers was deeply thanked by several faithful.|$|E

Intent on illustrating the limitations that contemporary educational theory placed upon women, Wollstonecraft writes, [...] "taught from their infancy that beauty is woman's sceptre, the mind shapes itself to the body, and, roaming round its gilt cage, only seeks to adorn its prison", implying that without this damaging ideology, which encourages young women to focus their attention on beauty and outward accomplishments, they could achieve much more.

40|$|Christian Science {{is one of}} {{the much}} influencial {{religious}} sects in the modern United States, especially in the field of publishing and medicine. However, there can we find only few researches about its healing practice even in the United States, and, as a matter of course, in Japan. This is a study about the transition and development of the idea and the <b>arts</b> <b>of</b> the <b>healing</b> from the Harmonialism to Christian Science. In harmonialism I include mesmerism, homeopathy, hydropathy, etc. Harmonialism is defined as an unorganized religious movements, which understands that a person's harmonial rapport with cosmos (or God) has much influence on his/her spiritual composure and physical health. But other than "rapport", one more important motief of harmonialism can I show you. It is the conceptions of half-materialistic fluid (for example, "spiritual matter") as the media of rapport. Many students refer to Christian'Science as one of the cases of harmonialism. Perhaps it is true to their ideas of the psychosomatic causes of diseases, but Christian Science has neither conceptions of "rapport" nor that of materialistic fluid. The materialistic conceptions of fluid changes into a metaphysical conception of "divine Mind" of Christian Science. We can show you another same change as the transition of the conception of the fluid, in that <b>of</b> <b>healing</b> <b>arts.</b> The commonest <b>arts</b> <b>of</b> <b>healing</b> <b>of</b> harmonialism, {{especially in the case of}} mesmerism, are "therapeutic touch" or "rubbing", which is done to transmit the fluid into the affected body organ. But in Chrisitian Science, they had no conceptions about such fluid so there are no arts to pass the fluid. These two points also show where Christian Science is to the strand of harmonialism. And my study can be some critic to the tendency of the contemporary research <b>of</b> faith <b>healing,</b> which is apt to focus only on the thought or cause <b>of</b> <b>healing...</b>|$|R

The boy believes there is a teacher who can sell him wisdom. Churches believe in imputed merit. But, in strictness, we are not much cognizant of direct serving.
