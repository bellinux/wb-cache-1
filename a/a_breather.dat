In round seven, both fighters went toe-to-toe and in round eight he hurt Judah several times. In round nine, Judah took a knee to gain <b>a</b> <b>breather</b> from Cotto's aggressive style. By the tenth round, Judah was bleeding from a cut over his right eye and was hurt by an uppercut from Cotto that sent him retreating to the ropes, but Judah stayed upright.

He managed {{to get to his}} feet, but Cotto went after Judah with a relentless attack, turning him sideways along the ropes as he continued to throw punches. That forced the referee to stop the fight.|$|E

Two types of collisions have been analyzed: symmetric and non-symmetric, head-on collisions. For low enough frequency the outcome is strongly dependent of the dynamical states of the two colliding breathers just before the collision. For symmetric collisions, several results can be observed: breather generation, {{with the formation of}} <b>a</b> trapped <b>breather</b> and two new moving breathers; breather reflection; generation of two new moving breathers; and breather fusion bringing about <b>a</b> trapped <b>breather.</b> For non-symmetric collisions the possible results are: breather generation, with the formation of three new moving breathers; <b>breather</b> fusion, originating <b>a</b> new moving breather; breather trapping with also breather reflection; generation of two new moving breathers; and two new moving <b>breathers</b> traveling as <b>a</b> ligand state. <b>Breather</b> annihilation has never been observed.

40|$|We {{introduce}} a two-dimensional {{model of a}} laser cavity based on the complex Ginzburg-Landau equation with the cubic-quintic nonlinearity and a lattice potential accounting for the transverse grating. A remarkable fact is that localized vortices, built as sets of four peaks pinned to the periodic potential, may be stable without the unphysical diffusion term, which was necessary for the stabilization in previously studied models. The vortices are chiefly considered in the onsite (rhombic) form, but the stabilization of offsite vortices (square-shaped ones) and quadrupoles is demonstrated too. Stability regions for the rhombic vortices and fundamental solitons are identified in the model’s parameter space, and scenarios {{of the evolution of}} unstable vortices are described. An essential result is a minimum strength of the lattice potential which is necessary to stabilize the vortices. The stability border is also identified {{in the case of the}} self-focusing quintic term in the underlying model, which suggests a possibility of the supercritical collapse. Beyond this border, the stationary vortex turns into <b>a</b> vortical <b>breather,</b> which is subsequently replaced by <b>a</b> dipolar <b>breather</b> and eventually by <b>a</b> single-peak <b>breather...</b>|$|R

40|$|We {{study the}} {{dynamics}} of the discrete nonlinear Schrödinger lattice initialized such that a very long transitory period of time in which standard Boltzmann statistics is insufficient is reached. Our study of the nonlinear system locked in this non-Gibbsian state focuses on {{the dynamics of}} discrete breathers (also called intrinsic localized modes). It is found that part of the energy spontaneously condenses into several discrete breathers. Although these discrete breathers are extremely long lived, their total number is found to decrease as the evolution progresses. Even though the total number of discrete breathers decreases we report the surprising observation that the energy content in the discrete breather population increases. We interpret these observations in the perspective of discrete breather creation and annihilation and find that the death of <b>a</b> discrete <b>breather</b> cause effective energy transfer to a spatially nearby discrete breather. It is found that the concepts of <b>a</b> multi-frequency discrete <b>breather</b> and of internal modes is crucial for this process. Finally, we find that the existence of <b>a</b> discrete <b>breather</b> tends to soften the lattice in its immediate neighborhood, resulting in high amplitude thermal fluctuation close to <b>an</b> existing discrete <b>breather.</b> This in turn nucleates discrete breather creation close to a already existing discrete breather...|$|R
