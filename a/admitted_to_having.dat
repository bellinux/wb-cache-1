5|$|Fed up {{with the}} {{attitude}} {{that he had to}} prove himself in the NFL, McKay once drunkenly needled Don Shula by saying, “I think pro coaches should have to prove themselves by winning four national championships in the colleges”. He later <b>admitted</b> <b>to</b> <b>having</b> ruffled some feathers in the NFL, but said, “it wasn’t as if they didn’t deserve it”.|$|E
5|$|In April 1999, {{on the eve}} of the retrial of {{the federal}} case, Keating entered a plea agreement.

5|$|Pilot Gerhard Goebel {{was able}} to calm Demeke down during the {{non-stop}} flight to New York. Though Demeke kept the pistol pointed at Goebel's head {{for the duration of}} the flight, he removed his ski mask. Goebel later told newspapers that he spent the hours trying to build a rapport with Demeke, who <b>admitted</b> <b>to</b> <b>having</b> spent several months planning the hijacking. Both men agreed that, upon arriving in New York, Goebel would give Demeke his sunglasses in exchange for Demeke's pistol.|$|E
5|$|Feit {{initially}} denied hearing Garza's confession in the rectory, but {{he later}} <b>admitted</b> <b>to</b> <b>having</b> done so. He accounted for his {{absence from the}} sanctuary by explaining that he had broken his glasses that night; {{he said that he}} often played with his glasses nervously as he listened to confession. Feit said that he had driven back to the pastoral house to get another pair of glasses, and when he arrived he had no key, so he had to climb into the house on the second floor. He said that he sustained the scratches on his hands as was climbing the outside of the brick structure.|$|E
5|$|Hamilton {{was given}} his first {{professional}} contract in September 1978 by Jimmy Adamson, who was manager of Football League Second Division side Sunderland. While {{he was with}} the Black Cats, Hamilton captained the England youth team, which was coached at the time by Brian Clough and Peter Taylor, to the final of the 1978 UEFA European Under-19 Football Championship, where they lost to the USSR. He <b>admitted</b> <b>to</b> <b>having</b> a good working relationship with Clough while he {{was a part of the}} England youth side. Despite being selected by his country, he failed to play a single first-team match for Sunderland and left to join fellow Second Division side Blackburn Rovers in January 1981.|$|E

5|$|However, the discontent {{within the}} locker room and the team's overall struggles culminated with Holmes criticizing and arguing with {{teammates}} in the huddle against Miami. Holmes was benched in the fourth quarter while the Jets subsequently lost 19–17, ending their postseason pursuit. After the Jets finished the season with a disappointing 8–8 record, Ryan <b>admitted</b> <b>to</b> <b>having</b> lost the pulse of the team. Then free agent running back LaDainian Tomlinson remarked that Ryan's Super Bowl predictions had an adverse effect on {{the locker room}} by placing undue pressure on the players. Ryan conceded this point and announced that he would refrain from making such statements publicly in the future.|$|E
5|$|It was {{reported}} that allegations of assault were made against another teacher in the 1980s. On 12 February, Professor Malcolm Layfield, Head of Strings at the Royal Northern College of Music resigned from the RNCM Board after claims of his previous sexual misconduct were brought up during the Brewer hearing. Before his appointment at RNCM, Layfield had <b>admitted</b> <b>to</b> <b>having</b> relationships with six Chetham's pupils aged between 16 and 18 whilst he taught there. Two RNCM teachers, including Head of Keyboard Studies Martin Roscoe, resigned in protest at his appointment in 2002. In October 2013 Layfield was arrested on suspicion of raping and indecently assaulting an 18-year-old woman between 1988 and 1999, but {{was found not guilty}} at a trial in 2015.|$|E
5|$|Martin's death largely {{took the}} air out of the federal perjury case against Webber. In July 2003, on the day before jury {{selection}} in the case was due to begin, Webber pleaded guilty to the reduced charge of criminal contempt in order to avoid a possible jail sentence. He <b>admitted</b> <b>to</b> <b>having</b> received and repaid $38,200. The deal was subject to a discretionary fine and possible classification of the infraction as a felony by the United States District Court Judge Nancy Edmunds who would rule in September 2003. In exchange for the plea all other charges were dropped against him as were all charges against his father. The charges against Webber's aunt had been dropped after Martin's death.|$|E

5|$|Winehouse's {{battles with}} {{substance}} abuse were {{the subject of much}} media attention. In 2005, she went through a period of drinking, heavy drug use, and weight loss. People who saw her during the end of that year and early 2006 reported a rebound that coincided with the writing of Back to Black. Her family believes that the mid-2006 death of her grandmother, who was a stabilising influence, set her off into addiction. In August 2007, Winehouse cancelled a number of shows in the UK and Europe, citing exhaustion and ill health. She was hospitalised during this period for what was reported as an overdose of heroin, ecstasy, cocaine, ketamine and alcohol. In various interviews, she <b>admitted</b> <b>to</b> <b>having</b> such problems with self-harm, depression, and eating disorders.|$|E
5|$|In 1960, Kinne was {{associated}} with two mysterious deaths. On March 19 of that year, her husband, James Kinne, was found {{shot in the head}} with the couple's two-year-old daughter playing nearby. Sharon Kinne claimed that the little girl, who had often been allowed to play with her father's guns, had accidentally shot him, and police were initially unable to disprove this theory. The case was closed as an accidental death and remained that way until the evening of May 27, when the body of twenty-three-year-old Patricia Jones, a local file clerk, was found by Kinne and a boyfriend in a secluded area. Investigation showed that Jones had been the wife of another of Kinne's boyfriends, and that Jones's husband had tried to break off his affair with Kinne shortly before Patricia Jones went missing. When Kinne <b>admitted</b> <b>to</b> <b>having</b> been the last person to speak to Patricia Jones, she was charged with Jones's death and, upon further investigation of his death, with the murder of James Kinne.|$|E
5|$|On May 23, 1994, Mexican State Judicial Police arrested Olivarez {{again in}} Matamoros for {{possessing}} two stolen vehicles. He {{was interviewed by}} Mexican authorities and stated {{that he was not}} guilty of Fischer's murder. He <b>admitted</b> <b>to</b> <b>having</b> stolen cars since he was young, and stated that Garza was trying to put the blame on him to protect himself from prosecution. Olivarez justified himself by saying that he had never been arrested with a gun. He admitted going to Dallas in 1992, but stated that he only knew Garza by name. He said he was a self-employed auto mechanic who supported his wife, mother, and uncle. Mexican officials said that Olivarez's auto theft ring extended all the way to Monterrey, as well as in Río Bravo, Valle Hermoso, and Matamoros, Tamaulipas. There was an arrest warrant for him issued by a state judge in Reynosa for being connected to about 50 car thefts. Brownsville investigators went to Mexico {{to see if they could}} talk to Olivarez, and began extradition procedings to bring him to a Texan court.|$|E

5|$|On October 18, 2006, the Department of Homeland Security warned National Football League {{officials}} in Miami, New York City, Atlanta, Seattle, Houston, Oakland, and Cleveland {{about a possible}} threat involving the simultaneous use of dirty bombs at stadiums. The threat claimed that the attack would be carried out on October 22, {{the final day of}} the Muslim holy month of Ramadan. Both the FBI and the Department of Homeland Security expressed doubt concerning the credibility of the threats, but warned the relevant organizations as a precaution. The games proceeded as planned but under a higher level of security awareness. The threats came to light in the national media after Jake Brahm <b>admitted</b> <b>to</b> <b>having</b> posted the threats on 4chan and repeating them on other websites approximately 40 times.|$|E
5|$|That same {{evening the}} Senate convened at the Temple of Concord and summarily {{condemned}} Sejanus to death. He was led from prison and strangled. His body was cast onto the Gemonian stairs, where the crowd tore it to pieces. Riots ensued, in which crowds hunted and killed anyone they could link to Sejanus. The Praetorians also resorted to looting, {{when they were}} accused of having conspired with the former prefect. Following the issue of damnatio memoriae by the Senate, his statues were torn down and his name obliterated from all public records. On October 24, Sejanus' eldest son Strabo was arrested and executed. Upon learning of his death, Apicata committed suicide (October 26), after addressing a letter to Tiberius, claiming that Drusus had been poisoned with the complicity of Livilla. The accusations were further corroborated by confessions from Livilla's slaves, who, under torture, <b>admitted</b> <b>to</b> <b>having</b> administered the poison to Drusus.|$|E
5|$|The {{trials for}} the Columbia County {{residents}} held at Fort Mifflin {{were held in}} October and November 1864. At least three of those tried <b>admitted</b> <b>to</b> <b>having</b> been at a secret meeting on August 14, that many people were armed at the meeting, and that {{the people at the}} meeting intended to resist the soldiers in Bloomsburg. However, most of the prisoners were released on or before January 1865, although a few were held until May 1865. No one was charged for the murder of Lieutenant Robinson until 1891, when Elias Young was arrested and charged. Although Young admitted to firing a gun, he stated that two people in the party searching for deserters had fired first. The court ruled that Young was acting in self-defense, and he was declared not guilty.|$|E

5|$|The single premiered on Chris Moyles's breakfast show on 7 September on BBC Radio 1. On Sunday 18 October 2009 {{the song}} was {{released}} for digital download in the UK. Cole took to the stage of The X Factor Live Results Show later that evening to perform the song for the first time. She adorned a military-themed outfit by Welsh fashion designer Julien MacDonald. It consisted of a sheer bodysuit, a red military jacket with black epaulettes {{as well as other}} details, black harem trousers and Alexander Wang boots. The outfit itself was subject to media attention, with some reporting that online debates had drawn comparisons to the outfit worn by 1992 video game antagonist M. Bison from the Street Fighter series. Media also considered Cole's outfit and performance inspired by Janet Jackson. Media speculated that the performance was mimed, something that Cole denied though she <b>admitted</b> <b>to</b> <b>having</b> some pre-recorded vocals to help the live performance. The show, which also featured the first UK performance by Whitney Houston in six years, drew a record audience of 14.8million, making it the most watched episode in the show's history at that time.|$|E
5|$|In 1995, {{the public}} {{prosecution}} {{department of the}} city of Augsburg obtained the calendars of Karlheinz Schreiber, a German arms dealer. With the help of the documents, the persecutors were able to decipher a code of aliases and money movements, leading to Kiep. On 4 November 1999, the prosecution office issued an arrest warrant against Kiep, charging him with having accepted a payment of one million Deutsche Marks from Schreiber in 1991 without subjecting the money to taxes. After turning himself in a day later, Kiep declared during his interrogation that he had accepted the money, with Horst Weyrauch present, as a donation for the CDU. This started the CDU donations scandal, in which a system of illegal accounts was uncovered. On 30 November, former chancellor Helmut Kohl took full responsibility for the accounts and later <b>admitted</b> <b>to</b> <b>having</b> personally accepted a total sum of up to two million Deutsche Marks from anonymous sponsors, which were not declared. As a consequence of the illegal proceedings, the CDU was sentenced to a payment of 41 million Deutsche Marks by President of the Bundestag Wolfgang Thierse on 15 February 2000. Kiep was ultimately involved in several lawsuits concerning tax evasion. One was closed in January 2004, after Kiep paid a monetary condition of 75,000 Euro. In another trial in 2001, he was sentenced to pay 45,000 Deutsche Marks. In early 2004, Kiep accepted a sentence of 40,500 Euro for a false statement given at the enquiry commission on the donations scandal.|$|E
5|$|The White House's {{most famous}} alleged {{apparition}} {{is that of}} Abraham Lincoln. Eleanor Roosevelt never <b>admitted</b> <b>to</b> <b>having</b> seen Lincoln's ghost, but did say that she felt his presence repeatedly throughout the White House. Mrs. Roosevelt {{also said that the}} family dog, Fala, would sometimes bark for no reason at what she felt was Lincoln's ghost. President Dwight Eisenhower's press secretary, James Hagerty, and Liz Carpenter, press secretary to First Lady Lady Bird Johnson, both said they felt Lincoln's presence many times. The former president's footsteps are also said to be heard in the hall outside the Lincoln Bedroom. As reputable an eyewitness as Lillian Rogers Parks admitted in her autobiography My Thirty Years Backstairs at the White House that she had heard them. Margaret Truman, daughter of President Harry S. Truman, said she heard a specter rapping {{at the door of the}} Lincoln Bedroom when she stayed there, and believed it was Lincoln. President Truman himself was once wakened by raps at the door while spending a night in the Lincoln Bedroom. Others have actually seen an apparition of the former president. The first person reported to have actually seen Lincoln's spirit was First Lady Grace Coolidge, who said she saw the ghost of Lincoln standing at a window in the Yellow Oval Room staring out at the Potomac. Winston Churchill, Theodore Roosevelt, and Maureen Reagan and her husband have all claimed to have seen a spectral Lincoln in the White House. A number of staff members of the Franklin D. Roosevelt administration claimed to have seen Lincoln's spirit, and on one occasion Roosevelt's personal valet ran screaming from the White House claiming he had seen Lincoln's ghost. Perhaps the most famous incident was in 1942 when Queen Wilhelmina of The Netherlands heard footsteps outside her White House bedroom and answered a knock on the door, only to see Lincoln in frock coat and top hat standing in front of her (she promptly fainted). Several unnamed eyewitnesses have claimed to have seen the shade of Abraham Lincoln actually lying down on the bed in the Lincoln Bedroom (which was used as a meeting room at the time of his administration), and others have seen Lincoln sit on the edge of the bed and put his boots on. The most famous eyewitness to the latter was Mary Eben, Eleanor Roosevelt's secretary, who saw Lincoln pulling on his boots (after which she ran screaming from the room).|$|E
