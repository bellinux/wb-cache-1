40|$|Monkeys {{require a}} {{considerably}} {{larger number of}} trials to bring responding {{under the control of}} the location of an auditory stimulus than cats, rats, and bats with the same experimental procedures. The present experiment sought to determine the conditions necessary for rapid <b>acquisition</b> <b>of</b> <b>control</b> of responding by location of noise and tone bursts in the monkey. Monkeys were run in an enclosure that contained four loudspeakers and four manipulanda. Two conditions were used in training. In the adjacent condition, a stimulus (noise or tone burst) was presented through one or other of two speakers and a response on the manipulandum adjacent to the speaker was reinforced with food. In the nonadjacent condition, a stimulus was presented through one of two speakers and a response on a manipulandum remote from the speaker was reinforced with food. <b>Acquisition</b> <b>of</b> <b>control</b> was measured by change in the percentage of reinforced responses during training. In the adjacent condition, responding came under control of location within zero to three sessions. In nonadjacent conditions, the animals required 14 to 20 sessions to come under control of location. These latter numbers are comparable to those reported in the literature for localization discrimination in monkeys...|$|E

40|$|In Experiment 1, {{groups of}} 10 {{goldfish}} and of 10 grey mullet {{were trained to}} press a lever for food under a fixed, daily, light cycle. The periods during which responses were reinforced were restricted to two, 1 -hr periods in every 24 hrs. These periods occurred {{at the same time}} each day. Responses were coordinated with the temporal contingencies of the schedule, and this pattern persisted for a number of days when no responses were reinforced. Experiment 2 demonstrated that a fixed light cycle was not essential for the maintenance of temporal discrimination. Experiment 3 followed a similar procedure to that of Experiment 1, except with individual goldfish and with only one, 1 -hr feeding period in every 24. Experiment 4 produced evidence that temporal discrimination could develop under continuous illumination in individual goldfish. In Experiment 5, individual goldfish under continuous illumination were exposed to schedules that reinforced lever presses with food during a 1 -hr period each day. Training with simultaneous temporal and visual contingencies, where food was available only {{in the presence of a}} stimulus light and at the same time each day, did not attenuate control over responding by either contingency. Further, pretraining on the temporal contingency did not prevent the subsequent <b>acquisition</b> <b>of</b> <b>control</b> by a stimulus light that was presented during the feeding hour. Similarly, pretraining on a visual contingency in which food was available at a different time each day did not prevent the subsequent <b>acquisition</b> <b>of</b> <b>control</b> by the temporal contingency (established by fixing the time of food availability). In Experiment 6, pretraining on the visual contingency did attenuate the subsequent <b>acquisition</b> <b>of</b> <b>control</b> by a different visual stimulus, showing that the lack of interference in control observed in Experiment 5 was not simply due to the intertrial interval used. These findings suggest that concurrent temporal and visual contingencies may control behaviour in parallel rather than in a competitive manner...|$|E

We propose that, although little work has been directed at separating their relative contributions to enrichment, controllability appears more important than complexity.

40|$|Instrumental {{behaviour}} {{is controlled}} by two systems: a stimulus–response habit mechanism and a goal-directed process that involves two forms of learning.

Evidence for contingency learning comes from studies of reward devaluation and from demonstrations that instrumental performance is sensitive not only the probability of contiguous reward {{but also to the}} probability of unpaired rewards. The process of incentive learning is evident in the <b>acquisition</b> <b>of</b> <b>control</b> over performance by primary motivational states.
