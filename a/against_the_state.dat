5|$|Gambira {{first became}} {{well known in}} August 2007 during {{widespread}} protests <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>State</b> Peace and Development Council (SPDC), the military government which had ruled the country since suppressing the previous uprising in 1988. The protests were sparked when the SPDC cut fuel subsidies without warning, causing fuel and other commodity prices to suddenly rise.|$|E
5|$|Upon {{returning}} to Australia, Hassett's men were {{informed by the}} military and the Australian Board of Control that the Services were to play a further six first-class matches <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>state</b> teams. Miller was tired but the fixtures were meant to revive cricket following the war and were also used as a lead-up to the international tour to New Zealand in March 1946.|$|E
5|$|At {{the time}} of McCarthy's speech, {{communism}} was a significant concern in the United States. This concern was exacerbated {{by the actions of}} the Soviet Union in Eastern Europe, the victory of the communists in the Chinese Civil War, the Soviets' development of a nuclear weapon the year before, and by the contemporary controversy surrounding Alger Hiss and the confession of Soviet spy Klaus Fuchs. With this background and due to the sensational nature of McCarthy's charge <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>State</b> Department, the Wheeling speech soon attracted a flood of press interest in McCarthy's claim.|$|E

5|$|Cicero, upon {{becoming}} consul, immediately {{moved to}} strike a deal with his consular colleague Hybrida, who had supported Catiline and his party, and who might join a rebellion <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>state.</b> In exchange for what amounted to the sole consulship for Cicero, Hybrida was to receive the rich consular province of Macedonia. Hybrida himself was heavily in debt and was wasteful of his money, and the wealth of Macedonia {{could be used by}} him to restore his lost fortune.|$|E
5|$|Furthermore, the Court held that, {{due to the}} Eleventh Amendment, {{federal courts}} could not {{exercise}} ancillary jurisdiction over cross-claims by counties against states. Although only two other justices agreed with the entirety of Justice Powell's majority opinion, Brennan and Marshall agreed with Parts I-IV and VI (the Oneida's claims against the counties) and Burger, White, and Rehnquist agreed with Part V (the counties claims <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>state),</b> thus forging separate majorities.|$|E
5|$|In 2006, {{a lawsuit}} by the Alliance Defense Fund, a {{conservative}} Christian {{group in the}} United States, was brought <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>state</b> of Washington when it permitted a public display of a holiday tree and a menorah but not a nativity scene. Because of the lawsuit, {{the decision was made}} to permit a nativity scene to be displayed in the rotunda of the state Capitol, in Olympia, as long as other symbols of the season were included.|$|E

5|$|In 2013, Lex Wotton, {{as well as}} {{his wife}} Cecilia and Mother Agnes, filed a class action lawsuit on behalf of Aboriginal people who lived on Palm Island <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>State</b> of Queensland and the Commissioner of the Police Service, alleging that the police had {{committed}} acts of unlawful racial discrimination in the investigation into Mulrunji's death in custody and in the subsequent police response to the unrest in the community. The Wottons' legal team included Lex Wotton's long-standing lawyer, Stewart Levitt of law firm Levitt Robinson Solicitors, as well as prominent anti-discrimination barrister Chris Ronalds SC, Aboriginal barrister Joshua Creamer, and Queensland barrister Shaneen Pointing.|$|E
5|$|King next {{attempted}} {{to organize a}} march for March 9. The SCLC petitioned for an injunction in federal court <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>State</b> of Alabama; this was denied and the judge issued an order blocking the march until after a hearing. Nonetheless, King led marchers on March 9 to the Edmund Pettus Bridge in Selma, then held a short prayer session before turning the marchers around and asking them to disperse {{so as not to}} violate the court order. The unexpected ending of this second march aroused the surprise and anger of many within the local movement. The march finally went ahead fully on March 25, 1965.|$|E
5|$|No {{official}} languages {{were recorded}} in the Constitution of 1992, although Malagasy was identified as the national language. Nonetheless, many sources still claimed that Malagasy and French were official languages, eventually leading a citizen to initiate a legal case <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>state</b> in April 2000, {{on the grounds that}} the publication of official documents only in the French language was unconstitutional. The High Constitutional Court observed in its decision that, in the absence of a language law, French still had the character of an official language.|$|E

5|$|Planned Parenthood and the ACLU {{subsequently}} {{brought a}} lawsuit <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>state</b> alleging {{it was being}} targeted unfairly, that the state law violated federal medicaid laws, and that their Fourteenth Amendment rights were violated. A May 11 ruling allowing the case to move forward, but denied the request from the petitioners to grant a temporary injunction to restore the funding; however, a June 24 ruling prohibited the state from enforcing the law.|$|E
5|$|Seeking {{national}} reconciliation between revolutionaries and Catholics, the Concordat of 1801 was signed on 15 July 1801 between Napoleon and Pope Pius VII. It solidified the Roman Catholic Church {{as the majority}} church of France and brought back most of its civil status. The hostility of devout Catholics <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>state</b> had now largely been resolved. It did not restore the vast church lands and endowments that had been seized during the revolution and sold off. As {{a part of the}} Concordat, he presented another set of laws called the Organic Articles.|$|E
5|$|The NAACP {{then brought}} suit {{challenging}} all five laws in state court. A state circuit court held {{three of the}} laws unconstitutional, but upheld the barratry law and the law prohibiting advocacy of lawsuits <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>state.</b> On appeal, the Virginia Supreme Court struck down the anti-advocacy law as well, but upheld the barratry law. In a 6-to-3 ruling in 1963 that gave broad protection to public interest legal organizations, the U.S. Supreme Court in NAACP v. Button, held that all five of the barratry, champerty, and maintenance laws violated the 1st and 14th Amendments to the constitution.|$|E

The fixtures were meant to revive cricket and were also used as a lead-up to the international tour to New Zealand in March 1946. Miller started his campaign with 80 against Western Australia. He finally returned to Melbourne in January, before taking on Victoria. Miller top-scored in both innings with 37 and 59 in an innings defeat.|$|E
5|$|According to Savenko, the Serbsky Center {{has long}} labored to legalize its monopolistic {{position}} of the Main expert institution of the country. The ambition and permissiveness—which, due to proximity to power, allow the Serbsky Center {{to get in touch}} over the telephone with the judges and explain to them who is who and what is the guideline, although the judges themselves have already learned it—have {{turned out to be a}} considerable drop in the level of the expert reports on many positions. Such a drop was inevitable and foreseeable in the context of the Serbsky Center efforts to eliminate adversary character of the expert reports of the parties, then to maximally degrade the role of the specialist as a reviewer and critic of the presented expert report, and to legalize the state of affairs. Lyubov Vinogradova believes there has been a continuous diminution in patients' rights as independent experts are now excluded from processes, cannot speak in court and can do nothing <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>State</b> experts.|$|E
5|$|Gia Long promulgated a {{new legal}} code {{to replace the}} system that had existed since the Hong Duc era of Lê Thánh Tông in the 15th century. Work started in 1811 under a group of {{scholars}} led by Nguyễn Văn Thành, and in 1815, the Bộ luật Gia Long (Gia Long Code) was issued. Although Gia Long claimed that his new system {{was a mixture of}} the Le code and Qing Dynasty system of China, most scholars regard it as being a near complete copy of the Qing code. The code was later translated into French by Paul-Louis-Félix Philastre. It focused on strengthening the power and authority of the emperor, his mandarins, and the traditional family unit. In cases of serious crimes, particularly those <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>state,</b> collective punishment was meted out to the family of the convict, including the death penalty.|$|E

5|$|Hitler fled to {{the home}} of Ernst Hanfstaengl and by some {{accounts}} contemplated suicide. He was depressed but calm when arrested on 11 November 1923 for high treason. His trial before the special People's Court in Munich began in February 1924, and Alfred Rosenberg became temporary leader of the NSDAP. On 1 April, Hitler was sentenced to five years' imprisonment at Landsberg Prison. There, he received friendly treatment from the guards, and was allowed mail from supporters and regular visits by party comrades. Pardoned by the Bavarian Supreme Court, he was released from jail on 20 December 1924, <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>state</b> prosecutor's objections. Including time on remand, Hitler served just over one year in prison.|$|E
5|$|In 2004–05, Ebsary scored {{more than}} 100 {{runs in a}} WNCL season {{for the first time}}. She scored 125 runs at 20.83, {{averaging}} more than 20 {{for the first time in}} a season. Her best score of 36 not out came in a ten-wicket win over Western Australia, and in the other match <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>state</b> the preceding day, she scored 28 and took 2/26 in a 29-run win. Her best bowling performance came in the first match of the season as she took 3/32 and scored 25 in a six-wicket win over Queensland. Ebsary ended the season with six wickets at 26.83. She bowled 37 overs and conceded 4.35 runs per over.|$|E
5|$|In ancient Athens, {{a person}} who {{committed}} suicide without {{the approval of the}} state was denied the honors of a normal burial. The person would be buried alone, {{on the outskirts of the}} city, without a headstone or marker. However, it was deemed to be an acceptable method to deal with military defeat. In Ancient Rome, while suicide was initially permitted, it was later deemed a crime <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>state</b> due to its economic costs. Aristotle condemned all forms of suicide while Plato was ambivalent. In Rome some reasons for suicide include volunteering death in a gladiator combat, guilt over murdering someone, to save the life of another, as a result of mourning, from shame from being raped, as an escape from intolerable situations like physical suffering, military defeat, or criminal pursuit.|$|E
