5|$|Fungal {{diseases}} include wirestem, {{which causes}} weak or dying transplants; Fusarium yellows, which result in stunted and twisted plants with yellow leaves; and blackleg (see Leptosphaeria maculans), {{which leads to}} sunken areas on stems and gray-brown spotted leaves. The fungi <b>Alternaria</b> brassicae and A.brassicicola cause dark leaf spots in affected plants. They are both seedborne and airborne, and typically propagate from spores in infected plant debris left on the soil surface for up to twelve weeks after harvest. Rhizoctonia solani causes the post-emergence disease wirestem, resulting in killed seedlings ("damping-off"), root rot or stunted growth and smaller heads.|$|E
5|$|Many fungi are parasites on plants, animals (including humans), {{and other}} fungi. Serious {{pathogens}} of many cultivated plants causing extensive damage and losses to {{agriculture and forestry}} include the rice blast fungus Magnaporthe oryzae, tree pathogens such as Ophiostoma ulmi and Ophiostoma novo-ulmi causing Dutch elm disease and Cryphonectria parasitica responsible for chestnut blight, and plant pathogens in the genera Fusarium, Ustilago, <b>Alternaria,</b> and Cochliobolus. Some carnivorous fungi, like Paecilomyces lilacinus, are predators of nematodes, which they capture using an array of specialized structures such as constricting rings or adhesive nets.|$|E
5|$|There {{are several}} {{diseases}} that {{can reduce the}} yield and market value of carrots. The most devastating carrot disease is <b>Alternaria</b> leaf blight, which {{has been known to}} eradicate entire crops. A bacterial leaf blight caused by Xanthomonas campestris can also be destructive in warm, humid areas. Root knot nematodes (Meloidogyne species) can cause stubby or forked roots, or galls. Cavity spot, caused by the oomycetes Pythium violae and Pythium sulcatum, results in irregularly shaped, depressed lesions on the taproots.|$|E
5|$|Several steroid {{derivatives}} {{have been}} isolated and identified from fruit bodies of L.perlatum, including (S)-23-hydroxylanostrol, ergosterol α-endoperoxide, ergosterol 9,11-dehydroendoperoxide and (23E)-lanosta-8,23-dien-3β,25-diol. The compounds 3-octanone, 1-octen-3-ol, and (Z)-3-octen-1-ol are the predominant {{components of the}} volatile chemicals that give the puffball its odor and flavor. Extracts of the puffball contain relatively high levels of antimicrobial activity against the human pathogenic bacteria Bacillus subtilis, Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, with an efficiency {{comparable to that of}} the antibiotic ampicillin. These results corroborate an earlier study that additionally reported antibacterial activity against Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium, Streptococcus pyogenes, and Mycobacterium smegmatis. Extracts of the puffball have also been reported to have antifungal activity against Candida albicans, C.tropicalis, Aspergillus fumigatus, <b>Alternaria</b> solani, Botrytis cinerea, and Verticillium dahliae. A 2009 study found L.perlatum puffballs to contain the phenolic compound cinnamic acid at a concentration of about 14milligrams per kilogram of mushroom. The fruit bodies contain the pigment melanin.|$|E
25|$|In 1993, taxol was {{discovered}} {{as a natural}} product in a newly described endophytic fungus living in the yew tree. It has since been reported {{in a number of}} other endophytic fungi, including Nodulisporium sylviforme, <b>Alternaria</b> taxi, Cladosporium cladosporioides MD2, Metarhizium anisopliae, Aspergillus candidus MD3, Mucor rouxianus sp., Chaetomella raphigera, Phyllosticta tabernaemontanae, Phomopsis, Pestalotiopsis pauciseta, Phyllosticta citricarpa, Podocarpus, Fusarium solani, Pestalotiopsis terminaliae, Pestalotiopsis breviseta, Botryodiplodia theobromae Pat., Gliocladium sp., <b>Alternaria</b> alternata var. monosporus, Cladosporium cladosporioides, Nigrospora sp., Pestalotiopsis versicolor, and Taxomyces andreanae. However, there has been contradictory evidence for its production by endophytes, with other studies finding independent production is unlikely.|$|E

25|$|They feed on skin flakes from humans, and animals, and on some mold. Dermatophagoides farinae fungal {{food choices}} in 16 tested species {{commonly}} found in homes was observed in vitro to be <b>Alternaria</b> alternata, Cladosporium sphaerospermum, and Wallemia sebi, and they disliked Penicillium chrysogenum, Aspergillus versicolor, and Stachybotrys chartarum.|$|E
25|$|In 2013, Joachim Podlech and {{co-workers}} determined {{the structure of}} <b>Alternaria</b> mycotoxin altenuic acid III by NMR spectroscopic analysis and completed its total synthesis. In the synthetic strategy, Suzuki-Miyaura Cross-Coupling reaction was used with a highly functionalized boronate and butenolides to synthesize a precursor of the natural product in high yield.|$|E
25|$|Altertoxins – {{are those}} of Alternariol (AOH), Alternariol methyl ether (AME), Altenuene (ALT), Altertoxin-1 (ATX-1), Tenuazonic acid (TeA) and Radicinin (RAD), {{originated}} from <b>Alternaria</b> spp. Some of the toxins can be present in sorghum, ragi, wheat and tomatoes. Some {{research has shown that}} the toxins can be easily cross-contaminated between grain commodities, suggesting that manufacturing and storage of grain commodities is a critical practice.|$|E
25|$|Concrete can {{be damaged}} by many processes, {{such as the}} {{expansion}} of corrosion products of the steel reinforcement bars, freezing of trapped water, fire or radiant heat, aggregate expansion, sea water effects, bacterial corrosion, leaching, erosion by fast-flowing water, physical damage and chemical damage (from carbonatation, chlorides, sulfates and distillate water). The micro fungi Aspergillus <b>Alternaria</b> and Cladosporium 	were able to grow on samples of concrete used as a radioactive waste barrier in the Chernobyl reactor; leaching aluminium, iron, calcium and silicon.|$|E
25|$|In 2005 an {{improved}} experiment {{was conducted by}} ISRO. On April 20, 2005, air samples were collected from the upper atmosphere at altitudes ranging from 20km to more than 40km. The samples were tested at two labs in India. The labs found 12 bacterial and 6 different fungal species in these samples. The fungi were Penicillium decumbens, Cladosporium cladosporioides, <b>Alternaria</b> sp. and Tilletiopsis albescens. Out of the 12 bacterial samples, three were identified as new species and named Janibacter hoylei (after Fred Hoyle), Bacillus isronensis (named after ISRO) and Bacillus aryabhattai (named after the ancient Indian mathematician, Aryabhata). These three new species showed {{that they were more}} resistant to UV radiation than similar bacteria.|$|E
25|$|In {{the late}} 1990s, {{research}} in Hunter Valley vineyards {{discovered that a}} wide range of pathogens caused various occurrences of bunch rot in the vineyards. These other pathogens included Colletotrichum acutatum (ripe rot), Greeneria uvicola (bitter rot) and other fungi from the genera of Aspergillus, Penicillium and <b>Alternaria.</b> Susceptibility of certain wine grape varieties were found to increase as the grapes reached higher Brix sugar levels. Further research in the 2000s, showed that some of the open canopy techniques used to prevent Botrytis grey rot may actually promote the development of some of these other types of rot. Ripe rot, in particular, seemed to thrive at the higher ultraviolet B (280–320nm) light exposure that open canopies allow. To compound the potential problem for Hunter Valley wine growers is that, as of 2010, there wasn't any fungicides registered for use for this disease.|$|E
2500|$|The {{relative}} humidity {{in the center}} of origin of cumin is rather low. High {{relative humidity}} (i.e. wet years) favours fungal diseases. Cumin is especially sensitive to <b>Alternaria</b> blight and Fusarium wilt. Early-sown crops exhibit stronger disease effects than late sown crops. The most important disease is Fusarium wilt, resulting in yield losses up to 80%. Fusarium is seed- or soil-borne and it requires distinct soil temperatures for development of epidemics. Inadequate fertilization might favour Fusarium epidemics. [...] Cumin blight (<b>Alternaria)</b> appears in the form of dark brown spots on leaves and stems. When the weather is cloudy after flowering, the incidence of the disease is increased. Another, but less important, disease is powdery mildew. Incidence of powdery mildew in early development can cause drastic yield losses because no seeds are formed. Later in development, powdery mildew causes discoloured, small seeds.|$|E
2500|$|In 1952, a {{study of}} the French Sahara and desert zone of Kizil Koum in Turkestan, {{identified}} a wide range of micromycetes in the uppermost layers of the soil. Many of the species present were saprophytic flora of dark pigmentation, including Helminthosporium, Curvularia, <b>Alternaria</b> and Stemphylium [...] Helminthosporium was the genus name of S. rostrata at the time. These fungi were mainly found in the mobile surface layer of the basin, becoming sparser with increasing depth. During dry periods, the Micromycetes in the mobile surface layers of the basin became mobilized by wind which accounted for the relatively uniform distributions of the surface microflora in the surrounding regions. It was discovered that the microfungal population of these superficial desert soils and sands had developed an adaptive morphology to protect them against unfavourable soil conditions. The dark pigmentation of these species is thought to protect them against light and desiccation, it can be seen in both the vegetative and reproductive states. As well, the spores of most of the Dematiaceae were reported as multicellular, septated transversely in the case of Helminthosporium which increases compartmentalization and protection. Another common characteristic of fungi isolated from desert sands is their rapid development and vast reproductive capacity.|$|E

50|$|<b>Alternaria</b> {{diseases}} {{are caused by}} the organisms <b>Alternaria</b> brassicae, <b>Alternaria</b> brassicicola and <b>Alternaria</b> japonica. Their English names are black spot, pod spot, gray leaf spot, dark leaf spot or <b>Alternaria</b> blight. The symptoms {{can be seen on}} all aboveground plant parts as dark spots. The infected plants are shrivelled and smaller than normal. <b>Alternaria</b> diseases infect almost all brassica plants, the most important hosts are oilseed brassicas. The fungus is a facultative parasite, what means that it can survive on living hosts as well as on dead plant tissue. Infected plant debris is in most circumstances the primary source of inoculum. The spores can be dispersed by wind to host plants in the field or to neighbouring brassica crops. This is why cross infections often occur in areas where different brassica crops are cultivated in close proximity. The disease spreads especially fast when the weather is wet and the plants have reached maturity.Alternaria brassicae is well adapted to temperate regions while <b>Alternaria</b> brassicicola occurs primarily in warmer parts of the world. Temperature requirement for <b>Alternaria</b> japonica is intermediate.There exist some wild accessions of Brassica rapa subsp. pekinensis with resistance to <b>Alternaria</b> brassicae but not on commercial cultivars. These resistances should be included to breeding programmes. <b>Alternaria</b> epicemics are best avoided by management practices like at least 3 years non-host crops between brassica crops, incorporation of plant debris into the soil to accelerate decomposition and usage of disease-free seeds.|$|E

50|$|<b>Alternaria</b> Leaf Blight is a foliar {{disease of}} carrots {{caused by the}} fungus <b>Alternaria</b> dauci. <b>Alternaria</b> dauci is {{included}} in the porri species group of <b>Alternaria,</b> which is classified for having large conidium and a long, slender filiform beak. Because many of the members of this group have similar morphology, <b>Alternaria</b> dauci has also been classified as formae specialis of carrots, or A. porri f. sp. dauci. It has been well established that the host range of this disease is on cultivated and wild carrot, but it has also been claimed that <b>Alternaria</b> dauci has the ability to infect wild parsnip, celery, and parsley. A study in 2011 by Boedo et al. evaluated the host range of <b>Alternaria</b> dauci in a controlled environment and concluded that several non-carrot species could constitute alternate hosts, such as Ridolfia segetum (corn parsley) and Caucalis tenet (hedge parsley). Despite their findings, reports of A. dauci colonization on non-carrot hosts continues to be debated because the use of Koch's Postulates on recovered isolates of A. dauci is challenging and is rarely reported; in addition, few reports are often made of such infections in field settings.|$|E
