Methods: this cross sectional {{study was conducted in}} Neurosurgery department, BSMMU to observe effect of hematoma and perihematomal edema volume on GCS <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>of</b> admission in patients with spontaneous lobar and basal ganglia hemorrhage. The duration of study period was from November 2005 to April 2007. Results: a total 48 patients were included in the study and the variables that were analyzed included site of hematoma, volume of hematoma, perihematomal edema and the initial GCS score. Associations between the hematoma and perihematomal edema, site of hemorrhage and perihematomal edema, hematoma volume and GCS <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>of</b> admission, perihematomal edema volume and GCS <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>of</b> admission were evaluated.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{determine}} whether the circadian rhythm of circulating levels of insulin-like growth factor binding protein- 1 (IGFBP- 1) is evident <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>of</b> delivery. DESIGN: Prospective observational study in six pregnant women and cross-sectional study in 65 women <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>of</b> delivery. SUBJECTS: Six pregnant women sampled {{over a period of}} 24 hours, 23 women sampled <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>of</b> elective caesarean section, and 42 women sampled <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>of</b> vaginal delivery. RESULTS: In the women sampled serially over a 24 hour period there was an obvious circadian rhythm of IGFBP- 1 with a peak between 01. 00 and 09. 00 hours. In <b>the</b> women sampled <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>of</b> delivery there was no evidence for any relationship between <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>of</b> delivery and maternal or fetal levels of IGFBP- 1. CONCLUSIONS: The circadian rhythm of IGFBP- 1 is not observed in women in labour.

40|$|Introduction & Objective: Hospitalization can {{significantly}} disrupt sleeping patterns. considering {{the prevalence of}} insomnia and widespread use of benzodiazepines and other hypnotics in hospitalized patients, we conducted this study to assess the quality of sleep and hypnotic drug use in hospitalized adult patients in 2007. Materials & Methods: This descriptive analytical cross-sectional study involved an assessment of sleep quality for patients whose consent had been obtained when admitted to the internal ward of Hamadan Ekbatan hospital. The Pittsburg sleep quality index (PSQI) {{was used to measure}} the quality of sleep in patients and completed <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>of</b> admission and discharge. Also the relation of factors such as age, sex. Marital status, education and sedating drug use prior to and during hospitalization with sleep quality were assessed. 300 patients entered this study and completed PSQI sleep questionnaires two twice, <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>of</b> admission & discharge. Results: <b>At</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>of</b> admission only 36 % of patients had good sleep quality (PSQI score < 5) while this percent decreased to 18. 3 % <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>of</b> discharge. Mean global PSQI score was 7. 6 <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>of</b> admission versus 9. 4 <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>of</b> discharge indicating <b>the</b> patientsâ€™ worse sleep quality <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>of</b> discharge (Pv< 0. 05). 23 % of patients received hypnotic drugs while in the hospital with no evidence of preadmission hypnotic use. Benzodiazepines were prescribed for all of them. Conclusion: Quality <b>of</b> sleep <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>of</b> discharge was significantly worse than it <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>of</b> admission and it seems that despite widespread use of sedative drug in the hospital, there are still patients with poor sleep quality in the hospital...|$|R
