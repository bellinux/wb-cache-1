5|$|Against {{his wishes}} Braham was rested from {{operations}} and posted from No 141 Squadron on 1 October 1943 {{to attend a}} staff officer course at Camberley. Braham resisted the move <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> could. He complained directly to Air Marshal Roderick Hill, commanding Fighter Command at that time. Hill refused to countenance Braham's request and denied his plea for one last operation. Within days Braham was posted to No. 9 Group RAF.|$|E
5|$|During {{his final}} years, and {{especially}} {{after the death of}} Hephaestion, Alexander began to exhibit signs of megalomania and paranoia. His extraordinary achievements, coupled with his own ineffable sense of destiny and the flattery of his companions, may have combined to produce this effect. His delusions of grandeur are readily visible in his will and in his desire to conquer the world, in <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> is by various sources described as having boundless ambition, an epithet, the meaning of which has descended into an historical cliché.|$|E
5|$|Grissom may not ask {{to take on}} {{the role}} of mentor, but it seems to happen naturally, going {{all the way back to}} Sara Sidle when they first met in San Francisco, then Nick Stokes and Greg Sanders in Vegas. Although he can be annoyed with his protégés at times, he is visibly proud when they succeed, as Greg did by passing his field test and {{becoming}} a CSI. He is also protective of his staff and defends them <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> can, as seen in episode 521 ("Rashomama") for example.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, I've seen {{changes in}} both. So has Wils, though Wils hasn't seen <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>as</b> <b>he's</b> heard from Lem an' Montana an' the Andrews boys." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "He {{can have}} my share, an' I'll 'gree {{to put in}} enough more to make up <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>as</b> <b>he's</b> got to have jest as soon as I kin earn it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't know if that's a good plan," [...] Martin remarked. [...] "Baumstein {{will offer}} about half <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>as</b> <b>he's</b> willing to give, but I'd take hold and {{negotiate}} until I thought he'd reached his limit. It {{will be under}} what the claim is worth. Then I'd go along and try the Combine." ...|$|R
5|$|Dickinson started {{school at}} Manton Primary in Worksop while his parents moved away to Sheffield. Soon afterwards, {{when he was}} six, he was also {{despatched}} to Sheffield, where he attended a primary school in Manor Top. After six months, his parents decided to move him to a small private school called Sharrow Vale Junior. Due to constant moving, Dickinson states that this period of his life taught him to be self-reliant as {{he was unable to}} make close friends. Dickinson has a younger sister, professional showjumper , who was born in 1963. He tried to isolate himself from her <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> could when he was young, supposedly out of spite because she, unlike him, was a planned pregnancy and birth.|$|E
5|$|The {{conflict}} with Congress continued. Johnson sent Congress proposals for amendments {{to limit the}} president to a single six-year term and make {{the president and the}} Senate directly elected, and for term limits for judges. Congress took no action on them. When the President was slow to officially report ratifications of the Fourteenth Amendment by the new Southern legislatures, Congress passed a bill, again over his veto, requiring him to do so within ten days of receipt. He still delayed <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> could, but was required, in July 1868, to report the ratifications making the amendment part of the Constitution.|$|E
5|$|The {{first of}} the spirits, the Ghost of Christmas Past, takes Scrooge to Christmas scenes of Scrooge's boyhood and youth, {{reminding}} him {{of a time when}} he was more innocent. The boyhood scenes portray Scrooge's lonely childhood, his relationship with his beloved sister Fan, and a Christmas party hosted by his first employer, Mr. Fezziwig, who treated Scrooge like a son. They also portray Scrooge's neglected fiancée Belle, who ends their relationship after she realises that Scrooge will never love her <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> loves money. Finally, they visit a now-married Belle with her large, happy family on a recent Christmas Eve.|$|E
50|$|He {{fell for}} 23-year-old Sarah Newlon more deeply {{than anybody else}} in the {{beginning}} but she was disqualified for not recognizing his twin brother. That incident made him think she isn't into him <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>as</b> <b>he's</b> into her and he was so hurt; he wasn't willing to compromise. Neither of these two ladies was the ultimate frontrunner. Both ladies went home heartbroken.|$|R
5000|$|Kaddu is Kumbh's pet {{porcupine}} {{who loves}} food <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>as</b> Kumbh. <b>He</b> follows his master everywhere like a Siamese twin.|$|R
60|$|Hugh nodded, and {{touching}} his cap {{with an air}} of <b>as</b> <b>much</b> respect <b>as</b> <b>he</b> could summon up, departed.|$|R
5|$|Throughout Edwards' three {{terms as}} governor, he showed a {{willingness}} to surrender his own considerable powers in order to expand participatory government in the Illinois Territory. Before 1812, while Illinois had a first-grade territorial status, Edwards had vast powers to appoint county and local officials; however, he made it his practice to consider local opinion <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> could when making appointments, often giving weight to petitions signed by local residents. He attempted {{to do the same}} for militia officers for a time, letting the men of a unit elect their leaders, but he soon abandoned this policy as impractical.|$|E
5|$|A {{social worker}} announces to Brian {{and the rest}} of his family that Brian is sentenced to be put down by a lethal injection, which shocks everyone. While Peter works on Brian's appeal, Brian decides to study the Law <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> can, and goes to court to defend himself, and finally gets the chance to plead his case before the Quahog City Council. During his parole hearing, he {{references}} the court case Plessy v. Ferguson, but unfortunately for him, the council believes that it's stupid to listen to a dog. Just when Brian is about to be dismissed, Peter steps in and delivers a last-ditch emotional appeal on his behalf. The city council members remain unmoved until Peter bribes them with $20 each, and Brian is immediately freed. The charges against him are finally dropped and the town shows him new respect, allowing him to finally drink out of a water fountain, showing his status to be the same as that of the other citizens of the community. The family returns home and Stewie, in an unusual (at the time) display of respect towards Brian, bows ever so slightly towards him. Brian and Peter are then left alone. Brian licks Peter's face in an endearing dog gesture, and threatens to kill him if he ever tells anyone about it.|$|E
5|$|Apu and his {{new wife}} Manjula invite Homer and Marge to their house for dinner. However, Apu and Manjula get in a fight, after Marge {{mentions}} to Manjula that Apu {{does not need to}} work <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> does. The week before Valentine's Day, Apu tells Homer that he is disappointed that Manjula does not love him, until Homer assures him that Manjula will not leave him before Valentine's Day, and Apu agrees. Apu decides to shower Manjula with many romantic surprises to regain her love. However, although many of Apu's surprises succeed in fixing his marriage, they ruin other people's relationships. The rest of Springfield's women become jealous from all the attention Manjula is receiving, and find their men to be cheapskates (including Maude Flanders). At Moe's Tavern, Homer encourages several of Springfield's men that they have to prevent Apu and Manjula from reconciling to save their own relationships and marriages.|$|E
60|$|Both {{opened their}} eyes at this, {{and stared at}} Alleyne with <b>as</b> <b>much</b> amazement <b>as</b> <b>he</b> had shown at them.|$|R
60|$|The man's {{face was}} curiously expressionless, but a {{momentary}} silence perhaps betrayed <b>as</b> <b>much</b> surprise <b>as</b> <b>he</b> {{was capable of}} showing.|$|R

5|$|Cunningham {{took off}} this night from RAF Middle Wallop in Hampshire to patrol north of London. When the {{direction}} of the raid was known he was ordered to proceed to the East Midlands. GCI vectored Cunningham and his temporary radar operator John Phillipson—a former ground radar operator—onto an enemy aircraft, but the crew were forced much further westward. Search lights attracted their attention and Phillipson was able to make a contact and guide him. Soon visual confirmation was made. A tell-tale sign of an aircraft was a blank patch of sky surrounded by a cluster of stars. Keeping in the enemy's blind spot, he flew below it and adjusted his speed to match the German pilot. After closing the range <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> dared, he fired with all four cannons and the Junkers Ju 88 exploded upon hitting the ground near Wittering, Cambridgeshire at 00:35. Cunningham's victim, 3./KG 54 Ju 88 flown by Unteroffizier Kaspar Sondermeister, was not claimed as destroyed. However, after interrogation of the two German survivors who affirmed the circumstances, Cunningham was granted the victory.|$|E
5|$|In 1968, Hendrix and Jeffery jointly {{invested}} in {{the purchase of the}} Generation Club in Greenwich Village. They had initially planned to reopen the establishment, but after an audit revealed that Hendrix had incurred exorbitant fees by block-booking lengthy sessions at peak rates they decided that the building would better serve them as a recording studio. With a facility of his own, Hendrix could work <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> wanted while also reducing his recording expenditures, which had reached a reported $300,000 annually. Architect and acoustician John Storyk designed Electric Lady Studios for Hendrix, who requested that they avoid right angles where possible. With round windows, an ambient lighting machine, and a psychedelic mural, Storyk wanted the studio to have a relaxing environment that would encourage Hendrix's creativity. The project took twice as long as planned and cost twice as much as Hendrix and Jeffery had budgeted, with their total investment estimated at $1 million.|$|E
5|$|The political, {{social, and}} {{economic}} crises also touched {{the issue of}} who would succeed Houphouët-Boigny as head of state. After severing ties with his former political heir Philippe Yacé in 1980, who, {{as president of the}} National Assembly, was entitled to exercise the full functions of President of the Republic if the Head of State was incapacitated or absent, Houphouët-Boigny delayed <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> could in officially designating a successor. The president's health became increasingly fragile, with Prime Minister Alassane Ouattara administering the country from 1990 onwards, while the president was hospitalised in France. There was a struggle for power, which ended when Houphouët-Boigny rejected Ouattara in favour of Henri Konan Bédié, the President of the National Assembly. In December 1993, Houphouët-Boigny, terminally ill with prostate cancer, was urgently flown back to Côte d'Ivoire so he could die there. He was kept on life support to ensure that the last dispositions concerning his succession were defined. After his family consented, Houphouët-Boigny was disconnected from life support at 6:35am GMT on 7 December. At the time of his death, Houphouët-Boigny was the longest-serving leader in Africa and the third in the world, after Fidel Castro of Cuba and Kim Il Sung of North Korea.|$|E

25|$|However, he {{was also}} {{affected}} by injury during 1977, and so did not play <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> had in the previous season.|$|E
25|$|Carroll {{sees this}} {{societal}} belief as vital {{in interpreting the}} final scene of the play, arguing that Valentine does give Silvia to Proteus, and in so doing, he is merely acting {{in accordance with the}} practices of the day. However, if one accepts that Valentine does not give Silvia to Proteus, as critics such as Jeffrey Masten argue, but instead offers to love Proteus <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> loves Silvia, then the conclusion of the play can be read as a final triumphant reconciliation between friendship and love; Valentine intends to love his friend <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> does his betrothed. Love and friendship are shown to be co-existent, not exclusive.|$|E
25|$|Ginsberg {{continued}} {{to help his}} friends <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> could, {{going so far as}} to give money to Herbert Huncke out of his own pocket, and housing a broke and drug addicted Harry Smith.|$|E

6000|$|... "’E’s all right," [...] {{said the}} orphan, wistfully; [...] "no coppers to chivvy ’im about, and <b>as</b> <b>much</b> grub <b>as</b> <b>he</b> wants. Wish I’d been a dog." ...|$|R
25|$|Bruckner {{never wrote}} an opera, and <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> {{was a fan}} of Wagner's music dramas, he was uninterested in drama. In 1893 he thought about writing an opera called Astra based on a novel by Gertrud Bollé-Hellmund.|$|E
25|$|He {{continued}} to play for Manchester United <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> could after suffering the injury, playing 36 times in the 1981–82 season and 29 times in the 1982–83 campaign, making two more appearances for England after the World Cup ended, scoring in the former as England beat Luxembourg 9–0.|$|E
25|$|Creditors, such as Henry Crown, {{advocated}} for the shutdown and liquidation of the property. Crown {{declared that the}} Rock Island was not capable of operating profitably, much less paying its outstanding debts. At the same time, Crown invested <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> could in Rock Island bonds and other debt at bankruptcy-induced junk status prices.|$|E

60|$|Mr. Winkle, thus instructed, {{climbed into}} his saddle, with about <b>as</b> <b>much</b> {{difficulty}} <b>as</b> <b>he</b> would have experienced in getting {{up the side}} of a first-rate man-of-war.|$|R
