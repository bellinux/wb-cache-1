These are detached {{from the bottom of}} the lake and drawn to <b>a</b> <b>suitable</b> <b>place</b> (generally to the north west of the houseboats' location) and anchored. Given its rich nutrient properties, tomatoes, cucumbers and melons are grown with noteworthy results.|$|E
5|$|In addition, land {{availability}} {{has a large}} {{effect on}} the available solar energy because solar panels can only be set up on land that is otherwise unused and suitable for solar panels. Roofs {{have been found to}} be <b>a</b> <b>suitable</b> <b>place</b> for solar cells, as many people have discovered that they can collect energy directly from their homes this way. Other areas that are suitable for solar cells are lands that are not being used for businesses where solar plants can be established.|$|E
5|$|Mount Guiting-Guiting in Sibuyan, the province's tallest mountain, is {{considered}} {{as one of the}} most difficult climbs in the Philippines, and is thus a major destination of local mountain climbers because of its steep and jagged summit. Another <b>a</b> <b>suitable</b> <b>place</b> for hiking and trekking is Mount Payaopao is Tablas. Meanwhile, Banton's Guyangan Cave System, an Important Cultural Treasure, is where the Banton Cloth — the earliest known warp ikat textile in Southeast Asia — was found in 1936.|$|E

5|$|Aveni {{claims that}} another {{building}} {{associated with the}} planet Venus {{in the form of}} Kukulcan, and the rainy season at Chichen Itza is the Caracol. This is a building with circular tower and doors facing the cardinal directions. The base faces the most northerly setting of Venus. Additionally the pillars of a stylobate on the building's upper platform were painted black and red. These are colours associated with Venus as an evening and morning star. However the windows in the tower seem to have been little more than slots, making them poor at letting light in, but providing <b>a</b> <b>suitable</b> <b>place</b> to view out.|$|E
5|$|Mated females then seek <b>a</b> <b>suitable</b> <b>place</b> {{to begin}} a colony. There, they break off their wings and begin to lay and care for eggs. The females can {{selectively}} fertilise future eggs with the sperm stored to produce diploid workers or lay unfertilized haploid eggs to produce drones. The first workers to hatch are known as nanitics, and are weaker and smaller than later workers, but they begin to serve the colony immediately. They enlarge the nest, forage for food, {{and care for the}} other eggs. Species that have multiple queens may have a queen leaving the nest along with some workers to found a colony at a new site, a process akin to swarming in honeybees.|$|E
5|$|In Vaikom, a {{small town}} in Kerala state, then Travancore, there were strict laws of {{untouchability}} in and around the temple area. Dalits, also known as Harijans were not allowed into the close streets around and leading to the temple, let alone inside it. Anti-caste feelings were growing and in 1924 Vaikom was chosen as <b>a</b> <b>suitable</b> <b>place</b> for an organised Satyagraha. Under his guidance a movement had already begun with the aim of giving all castes the right to enter the temples. Thus, agitations and demonstrations took place. On the fourteenth of April, Periyar and his wife Nagamma arrived in Vaikom. They were immediately arrested and imprisoned for participation. In spite of Gandhi's objection to non-Keralites and non-Hindus taking part, Periyar and his followers continued to give support to the movement until it was withdrawn. He received the title Vaikom Veeran, given by his followers who participated in the Satyagraha.|$|E

50|$|Despite its {{peaceful}} calm, Pondicherry proved unsuitable {{as it was}} too {{far from}} China and Indo-China {{where most of the}} seminarians came from. As a result, the seminary was temporary closed in 1782 until <b>a</b> more <b>suitable</b> <b>place</b> could be found.|$|R
50|$|This is <b>a</b> {{particularly}} <b>suitable</b> <b>place</b> {{to spend}} some time in contact with marine nature, repose and also for fun. The two rocks are also a great place for diving. There is also practiced spearfishing, given the abundance of the fauna.|$|R
5|$|Termite alates only {{leave the}} colony when a nuptial flight takes place. Alate {{males and females}} pair up {{together}} and then land in search of <b>a</b> <b>suitable</b> <b>place</b> for a colony. A termite king and queen do not mate until they find such a spot. When they do, they excavate a chamber big enough for both, close up the entrance and proceed to mate. After mating, the pair never go outside and {{spend the rest of}} their lives in the nest. Nuptial flight time varies in each species. For example, alates in certain species emerge during the day in summer while others emerge during the winter. The nuptial flight may also begin at dusk, when the alates swarm around areas with lots of lights. The time when nuptial flight begins depends on the environmental conditions, the time of day, moisture, wind speed and precipitation. The number of termites in a colony also varies, with the larger species typically having 100–1,000 individuals. However, some termite colonies, including those with large individuals, can number in the millions.|$|E
5|$|Three legends are narrated to the {{establishment}} of the monastery. In the first legend it is said that location of the present Monastery was selected by a horse which belonged to Merag Lama Lodre Gyatso who was on a mission assigned to him by the 5th Dalai Lama to establish a Monastery. After an intense search, when he failed to locate <b>a</b> <b>suitable</b> <b>place,</b> he retired into a cave to offer prayers seeking divine intervention to choose the site. When {{he came out of the}} cave, he found his horse missing. He then went in search of the horse and finally found it grazing at the top of a mountain called Tana Mandekhang, which in the past was the palace of King Kala Wangpo. He took this as a divine and auspicious guidance and decided to establish the monastery at that location. Seeking the help of the local people, Mera Lama established the monastery at that location in the latter part of 1681.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} spring, the queen {{comes out of}} {{diapause}} and finds <b>a</b> <b>suitable</b> <b>place</b> to create her colony. Then she builds wax cells in which to lay her eggs which were fertilised the previous year. The eggs that hatch develop into female workers, and in time, the queen populates the colony, with workers feeding the young and performing other duties similar to honeybee workers. In temperate zones, young queens (gynes) leave the nest in the autumn and mate, often more than once, with males (drones) that are forcibly driven out of the colony. The drones and workers die as the weather turns colder; the young queens feed intensively to build up stores of fat for the winter. They survive in a resting state (diapause), generally below ground, until the weather warms up in the spring with the early bumblebee being the species that is {{among the first to}} emerge. Many species of bumblebee follow this general trend within the year. Bombus pensylvanicus is a species that follows this type of colony cycle. For this species the cycle begins in February, reproduction starts in July or August, and ends in the winter months. The queen remains in hibernation until spring of the following year in order to optimize conditions to search for a nest.|$|E

25|$|The remote islands were {{considered}} to be <b>a</b> <b>suitable</b> <b>place</b> to punish the independence activists. Not only were they isolated from the mainland, the overseas journey (Kala Pani) to the islands also threatened them with loss of caste, resulting in social exclusion. The convicts could also be used in chain gangs to construct prisons, buildings and harbour facilities. Many died in this enterprise. They served to colonise the island for the British.|$|E
25|$|When {{the male}} has {{identified}} a suitable location, he deposits the spermatophore and then guides the female over it. This allows the spermatophore to enter her genital opercula, which triggers {{release of the}} sperm, thus fertilising the female. The mating process can take from 1 to 25+ hours and depends {{on the ability of}} the male to find <b>a</b> <b>suitable</b> <b>place</b> to deposit his spermatophore. If mating continues too long, the female may lose interest, ending the process.|$|E

25|$|In October 1823, John Lee Williams of Pensacola and Dr. William Simmons of St. Augustine {{selected}} the former Indian settlement of Tallahassee, roughly midway {{between the two}} cities, as <b>a</b> <b>suitable</b> <b>place.</b> Their decision was also based on its elevation and location near a beautiful waterfall, now part of Cascades Park, and the old capital of the Apalachee chiefdom. In March of the following year it was formally proclaimed the capital. Florida did not become a state, however, until 1845 (Tebeau:122).|$|E

50|$|Typically, {{little is}} known of The Valley's history during the Dark Ages, but {{it seems likely that}} an {{important}} battle was fought around AD 575 at the Glen Water. In addition, given the strong strategic importance of Newmilns' position as <b>a</b> <b>suitable</b> fording <b>place</b> and <b>a</b> bottleneck on one of Scotland's main east-west trade routes, it is not unlikely that other battles and skirmishes occurred during this period.|$|R
25|$|Impressed by Vivekananda's {{views on}} science and {{leadership}} abilities, Tata wanted him to guide his campaign. Vivekananda endorsed the project with enthusiasm, and Tata, {{with the aim of}} advancing the scientific capabilities of the country, constituted a Provisional Committee to prepare a plan for setting up of an Institute of research and higher education. The committee presented a draft proposal to Lord Curzon on 31 December 1898.

25|$|The Trunk Line was {{completed}} in 1854, followed by the Østfold Line in 1879. By the 1870s there was sufficient traffic on the Trunk Line that the Norwegian Trunk Railway was considering building double track along it. The economic decline throughout the 1880s put these plans on hold. Parliament decided in 1897 that the Gjøvik Line's freight trains would be handled at Loenga. This made it necessary for a separate freight track to be built through Loelvdalen.
