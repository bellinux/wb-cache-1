The mixture of these intermediates is sometimes known as KA. 2 CONTRIBUTION TO TOTAL EMISSIONS There is uncertainty in national emission estimates for N 2 O {{and it is}} not possible to give an accurate figure for the contribution of <b>adipic</b> <b>acid</b> <b>production</b> to total emissions. It has been estimated that the increase in the concentration of N 2 O in the earth’s atmosphere is 0. 2 % and that growing <b>adipic</b> <b>acid</b> <b>production</b> accounts for up to 10 % of this increase (Theimans and Trogler, 1991).

40|$|Cylohexane {{oxidation}} is {{of great}} industrial importance {{in the production of}} intermediates for the manufacture of nylon- 6 and nylon- 6, 6. Most cyclohexane is commercially converted into a cyclohexanone–cyclohexanol mixture (known as K-A oil) by catalytic oxidation. K-A (Ketone-Alcohol) oil is then used as a raw material for <b>adipic</b> <b>acid</b> and caprolactam <b>production.</b> Practically, if the cyclohexanol content of KA oil is higher than that of cyclohexanone, it is more profitable to convert it into adipic acid; otherwise caprolactam production is more likely. The steady state cyclohexane oxidation reaction model in a stirred tank reactor for K-A oil production is presented and solved in this paper. The model was derived based on the mass balance and mass transfer equations using the kinetic equation. The set of algebraic equations was solved using non linear programming. The advantage of this method is that the relationship among variables can be better understood and an appropriate solution to the equation set can be obtained more quickly. Simulation results are particularly useful for process design such as in determining reactor dimensions and operating conditions. ...|$|R

40|$|Moving from a fossil-based to a {{bio-based}} economy requires {{the development of}} new technologies for the production of bio-based chemicals and materials. These technologies may become part of novel biorefinery concepts that combine the production of bulk and fine chemicals. This paper presents a life cycle assessment (LCA) of such a novel concept in which forest residues and micro-algae are used as feedstock for the combined production of adipic acid and high value-added chemicals. Adipic acid is mainly used as a precursor in the production of nylon, and its current fossil-based production process emits significant quantities of nitrous oxide (N 2 O), a highly potent greenhouse gas. There is thus a great potential to reduce the global warming potential of the production of adipic acid, and consequently nylon. The novel biorefinery concept is the main target of a multi-disciplinary R&D project. The concept is in a very early stage of development which mostly consists of experimental lab work. There are some challenges that must be overcome to evaluate the concept using life cycle assessment at this early development stage. Scaling up lab results to an industrially relevant process capacity needs to be addressed in order to e. g. account for changes in yield. This can be done using process modeling and simulation. The total scale of production is another aspect which is important for the assessment of bio-based products, because the environmental impact of biomass production is not linearly dependent on the amount harvested. Furthermore, the results of the assessment need to be communicated in a meaningful way to the stakeholders who have different backgrounds and are often not familiar with LCA. The paper will discuss these challenges for the case of bio-based <b>adipic</b> <b>acid</b> <b>production</b> using the novel biorefinery concept, and will present results from the assessment and compare these to the case of fossil-based <b>adipic</b> <b>acid</b> <b>production...</b>|$|E

The 11 published experimental {{studies on the}} CCN activity of <b>adipic</b> <b>acid</b> particles are not consistent with each other nor do they in most cases agree with the Köhler theory. The CCN activity of <b>adipic</b> <b>acid</b> aerosol particles was studied over a significantly wider range of conditions than in any previous single study. The work spans {{the conditions of the}} previous studies and also provides alternate methods for producing wet and dry <b>adipic</b> <b>acid</b> particles without the need to produce them by atomization of aqueous solutions. The CCN effect of <b>adipic</b> <b>acid</b> coatings on both soluble and insoluble particles has also been studied. The CCN activation of the small (d m 150 nm) initially dry particles is subject to a deliquescence barrier, while for the larger particles the activation follows the Köhler curve. <b>Adipic</b> <b>acid</b> particles prepared in a wet state follow the Köhler curve over the full range of particle diameters studied. The experiments suggest that the scatter in the previously published CCN measurements is most likely due to the difficulty of producing uncontaminated <b>adipic</b> <b>acid</b> particles by atomization of solutions and possibly also due to uncertainties in the calibration of the instruments.

These technologies may become part of novel biorefinery concepts that combine the production of bulk and fine chemicals. This paper presents the life cycle assessment (LCA) of such a technology, in its early stages of development, which targets the biochemical production of adipic acid from Swedish forest residue. Adipic acid is a bulk chemical and its yearly production is approximately 2. 3 million tonnes. It is mainly used as a precursor in the production of nylon, and its current fossil-based production process emits significant quantities of nitrous oxide (N 2 O), a strong greenhouse gas. Preliminary calculations showed that, compared to conventional <b>adipic</b> <b>acid</b> <b>production,</b> eliminating the emission of N 2 O would lead to a reduction of GWP by 75 %, and that switching from a fossil-based to a biomass-based feedstock would reduce GWP by an additional 10 %. This LCA focused on the technology for producing adipic acid, but also considered its connection with other technologies in the biorefinery concept. An anaerobic digestion process is used to produce biogas from the waste water. As well, lignin is produced as a by-product. The heat from biogas and lignin incineration can be used to meet the energy demands of the <b>adipic</b> <b>acid</b> <b>production.</b> Lab-scale experimental results were used in the assessment, and scaling up these results to an industrially relevant process capacity was done by using process modelling and simulation. Furthermore, an assessment was done of the impact of extracting forest residue from the Swedish forest. The results of this LCA show that the environmental impacts of producing adipic acid from forest residues, except for acidification potential, are significantly lower than those of its conventional production. The environmental hotspot of the technology is the downstream processing stage due to its need of additional energy which was assumed to be fossil. This additional energy is needed because of the low concentration of adipic acid in the fermentation broth. Further improvements can thus be made by minimizing fossil energy use in this stage, or by aiming for a higher end concentration of adipic acid in the fermentation broth. Lastly, the extraction of forest residue was found to only marginally contribute to global warming...|$|E

40|$|Global {{anthropogenic}} emissions of carbon, sulfur, and nitrogen are reviewed by major category. Both present and historical emissions are reviewed including respective uncertainty ranges. The article {{concludes with a}} brief discussion of how to relate trends in emissions {{to the evolution of}} their underlying driving forces using energy-related carbon emissions as an example. Main conclusions for the three gases are summarized below: Anthropogenic emissions of carbon are small compared to the sizes of natural carbon reservoirs and the annual flow rates between them. Yet they constitute important perturbations of the natural carbon cycle, well quantified for industrial carbon emissions (mostly the burning of fossil fuels), but remaining uncertain for carbon emissions arising from biomass burning and land-use changes. Since the onset of the Industrial Revolution, some 530 billion tons of carbon (PgC) gross emissions have been released by human activities to the atmosphere, part of which was balanced by (highly uncertain) terrestrial biospheric carbon sinks. Net carbon emissions over the period 1800 - 2000 are estimated at 280 PgC. After accounting for oceanic uptake, these emissions have increased the atmospheric carbon loading by 200 PgC, or by one-third natural levels. In the absence of stringent climate policies, between 770 and 2540 PcG could be released to the atmosphere over the next 100 years. A significant amplification of humankind's "discernible influence on the climate system" is thus likely. Anthropogenic emissions of sulfur have surpassed natural flows ever since {{the first quarter of the}} 20 th century. Since about 1975 global emissions (mostly from burning of sulfur-rich fuels such as coal and oil) have stayed roughly constant. A continued rise in sulfur emissions in developing countries has been compensated by drastic declines in emissions in Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) countries as a result of environmental policies. Similar policies will be required also in developing countries to counter local and regional environmental impacts of high sulfur emissions. A slowdown and ultimately a trend reversal of sulfur emission growth trends also in developing countries could thus be likely over the next few decades. Emissions of nitrogen take a variety of forms and originate from a wide array of different sources including: nitrogen oxides, principally formed in high temperature combustion (burning of fossil fuels); ammonia, principally arising from animal manure; and nitrous oxide (N 2 O), a powerful greenhouse, principally arising from soil microbial process as well as agricultural activities and animal manure. Because of the multitude of gases and sources, emission estimates are poorly understood and uncertain. There is also a paucity of both past and present inventory data and future emission scenarios. More research is therefore needed before considering policy interventions to control these gases beyond well established source categories (e. g. nitrogen oxide emissions from automobiles, or nitrous oxide emissions from <b>adipic</b> <b>acid</b> <b>production)</b> ...|$|E

40|$|The {{research}} work {{described in this}} thesis has two studies on processes {{that may lead to}} <b>adipic</b> <b>acid</b> <b>production</b> through hexanoic acid synthesis pathway by the anaerobic bacterium Megasphaera elsdenii and its subsequent utilisation by Pseudomonas strains. The first part of the research described was concerned with the ability of Pseudomonas putida (syn P. oleovorans) to convert hexanoic acid to adipic acid. However, despite a sustained effort the research was unable to confirm the formation of adipic acid in these strains and this line of research was not pursued further. The research however, did show {{for the first time that}} these Pseudomonas strains could produce octanoic acid from n-octanol vapours in the presence and absence of n-hexanoic acid and has thus led to important new information. The second line of research pursued and which constituted the major research effort was concerned with an investigation on regulation and production of the metabolic intermediates and end-products during glucose and lactate metabolism in M. elsdenii. A number of wild type strains were studied as well as mutants isolated as resistant to 3 -fluoropyruvate were used to investigate end-product inhibition and the biochemical pathways used for fermentation. Small volume cultures and controlled fermenters were used to investigate the fatty acid end-products during glucose, lactate and mixed substrates and to optimise the effect of pH on growth and metabolism. An important finding was that the mutant ME 5 produced relatively more valeric and hexanoic acid compared to its parental strain ATCC 25940 in mixed substrates. While in the presence of glucose, the proportion of valeric acid produced by strain ME 5 was higher than seen for its parental strain ATCC 25940 and mutant ME 7. Another important finding was that pH control improved the yield of acids compared with uncontrolled fermentation. The work described in this thesis was also concerned with the recovery of fermentation products to obtain higher productivity and more efficient recovery of the products by adsorption to anion exchange resins. Initially, Amberlite IRA- 93 (weak base anion-exchange resin) and Amberlite IRA- 400 (strong base anion-exchange resin) resins were tested for their ability to adsorb and desorb butyric and hexanoic acids from water and peptone-yeast-glucose media. It was observed that both resins adsorbed more n-hexanoic acid than n-butyric acid, which suggested that the VFA chain length might affect the degree of adsorption. Both acids were desorbed more effectively by esterification from Amberlite IRA- 93 resin. This indicated that Amberlite IRA- 93 might have some attractive features above Amberlite IRA- 400 in terms of product recovery in the form of esters. Further studies were carried out on the adsorption and desorption of both acids on the fermentation level in peptone-yeastglucose media under pH controlled and uncontrolled pH conditions. Results indicated that using the Amberlite IRA- 93 had an advantage in that it did not release a counter ion on binding of anions so that it exerts a buffering effect on the fermentation broth, thus reducing the degree of pH control needed and the amount of alkali used to maintain the optimum pH. The outcome of this finding is that better yields and better recovery of products can be achieved. Another line of research was concerned with the key enzymes involved in the fermentation and the genes coding for them. The research detected pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) in strain ATCC 25940 for the first time and showed that the activity of this enzyme was significantly lower in the mutant ME 5. However, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) activity in ME 5 was significantly higher compared with ME 7 and the parent ATCC 25940. It was also shown that enzyme expression was highest in exponential growth. It was concluded that the relative changes in PDH and LDH in ME 5 were responsible for the changes in carbon flow to acid end-products. The final component of the research was concerned with a preliminary investigation of the molecular biology of the enzymes leading to the formation of hexanoic acid. The sequence of the short-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (SCAD) in ATCC 25940 and mutants ME 5 and ME 7 were obtained and compared. However, no changes were seen which could explain the altered end-products. Likewise a minor change in the sequence of the electron-transferring flavoprotein was unlikely to affect the metabolic activity. An attempt to design PCR primers from related sequences of lactate dehydrogenase to investigate the LDH genes was unsuccessful...|$|E
