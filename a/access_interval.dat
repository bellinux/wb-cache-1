40|$|Abstract—Machine-type {{communication}} (MTC) is {{a crucial}} ser-vice for next-generation cellular networks. Mass access to the network by MTC devices may result in the overload of radio access networks (RANs) and degrade the service quality of human-to-human communication. Group paging {{is one of the}} mechanisms proposed to alleviate the RAN-overload problem. This paper presents an analytical model based on a recursive contending-users estimation (RCE) method proposed in the literature to derive the performance metrics of collision probability, access success probability, average access delay, statistics of preamble transmis-sions, statistics of access delay, and utilization of random-access opportunities (RAOs) for group paging with various combinations of group sizes and reserved radio resources in a paging <b>access</b> <b>interval.</b> The optimal group size and required RAOs are subse-quently derived based on the given target access success probabil-ity. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed model can accurately estimate the performance of group paging.

First, we established the RF energy harvesting model and gave the energy condition. In order to minimize the interference of subcarriers and increase the spectral efficiency, then, the colocated passive QAM backscatter communication signal model is presented and the nonlinear optimization problems of power control are solved for passive QAM backscatter communication systems. Solutions include maximum and minimum <b>access</b> <b>interval,</b> the maximum and minimum duty cycle, and the minimal RF-harvested energy under the energy condition for node operating. Using the solutions above, the maximum throughput of passive QAM backscatter communication systems is analyzed and numerical calculation is made finally. Numerical calculation shows that the maximal throughput decreases with the consumed power {{and the number of}} sensors, and the maximum throughput is decreased quickly with the increase of the number of sensors. Especially, for a given consumed power of sensor, {{it can be seen that}} the throughput decreases with the duty cycle and the number of sensors has little effect on the throughput...|$|E
40|$|Place name is an {{important}} ingredient of borderlands situation information and {{plays a significant role}} in collecting them from the Internet with focused crawlers. However, current focused crawlers treat place name {{in the same way as}} any other common keyword, which has no geographical properties. This may reduce the effectiveness of focused crawlers. To solve the problem, this paper firstly discusses the importance of place name in focused crawlers in terms of location and spatial relation, and, then, proposes the two-tuple-based topic representation method to express place name and common keyword, respectively. Afterwards, spatial relations between place names are introduced to calculate the relevance of given topics and webpages, which can make the calculation process more accurately. On the basis of the above, a focused crawler prototype for borderlands situation information collection is designed and implemented. The crawling speed and F-Score are adopted to evaluate its efficiency and effectiveness. Experimental results indicate that the efficiency of our proposed focused crawler is consistent with the polite <b>access</b> <b>interval</b> and it could meet the daily demand of borderlands situation information collection. Additionally, the F-Score value of our proposed focused crawler increases by around 7 %, which means that our proposed focused crawler is more effective than the traditional best-first focused crawler...|$|E

40|$|Recent {{studies have}} shown that in highly {{associative}} caches, the performance gap between the Least Recently Used (LRU) and the theoretical optimal replacement algorithms is large, suggesting that alternative replacement algorithms can improve the performance of the cache. One main reason for this performance gap is that in the LRU replacement algorithm, a line is only evicted after it becomes the LRU line, long after its last access/touch, while unnecessarily occupying the cache space for a long time. This paper proposes a new approach to deal with the problem: counter-based L 2 cache replacement. In this approach, each line in the L 2 cache is augmented with an event counter that is incremented when an event of interest, such as a cache access to the same set, occurs. When the counter exceeds a threshold, the line “expires”, and becomes evictable. When expired lines are evicted early from the cache, they make extra space for lines that may be more useful, reducing the number of capacity and conflict misses. Each line’s threshold is unique and is dynamically learned and stored in a small 40 -Kbyte counter prediction table. We propose two new replacement algorithms: <b>Access</b> <b>Interval</b> Predictor (AIP) and Live-time Predictor (LvP). AIP and LvP speed up 10 (out of 21) SPEC 2000 benchmarks by up to 40 % and 11 % on average. 1...|$|E
40|$|Techniques for {{analyzing}} and improving memory referencing behavior {{continue to be}} important for achieving good overall program performance due to the ever-increasing performance gap between processors and main memory. This paper offers a fresh perspective {{on the problem of}} predicting and optimizing memory behavior. Namely, we show quantitatively the extent to which detailed timing characteristics of past memory reference events are strongly predictive of future program reference behavior. We propose a family of timekeeping techniques that optimize behavior based on observations about particular cache time durations, such as the cache <b>access</b> <b>interval</b> or the cache dead time. Timekeeping techniques can be used to build small, simple, and high-accuracy (often 90 % or more) predictors for identifying conflict misses, for predicting dead blocks, and even for estimating the time at which the next reference to a cache frame will occur and the address that will be accessed. Based on these predictors, we demonstrate two new and complementary time-based hardware structures: (1) a time-based victim cache that improves performance by only storing conflict miss lines with likely reuse, and (2) a time-based prefetching technique that hones in on the right address to prefetch, and the right time to schedule the prefetch. Our victim cache technique improves performance over previous proposals by better selections of what to place in the victim cache. Our prefetching technique outperforms similar prior hardware prefetching proposals, despite being orders of magnitude smaller. Overall, these techniques improve performance by more than 11 % across the SPEC 2000 benchmark suite...|$|E

In addition, a selfsimilar model is proposed to generate memory access series and experimental results show that this model can faithfully emulate the complex access behaviors of real memory systems...|$|R
40|$|A {{multiport}} memory {{architecture is}} diclosed {{for each of}} a plurality of task centers connected to a command and data bus. Each task center, includes a memory and a plurality of devices which request direct memory access as needed. The memory includes an internal data bus and an internal address bus to which the devices are connected, and direct timing and control logic comprised of a 10 -state ring counter for allocating memory devices by enabling AND gates connected to the request signal lines of the devices. The outputs of AND gates connected to the same device are combined by OR gates to form an acknowledgement signal that enables the devices to address the memory during the next clock period. The length of the ring counter may be effectively lengthened to any multiple of ten to allow for more direct memory <b>access</b> <b>intervals</b> in one repetitive sequence. One device is a network bus adapter which serially shifts onto the command and data bus, a data word (8 bits plus control and parity bits) during the next ten direct memory <b>access</b> <b>intervals</b> {{after it has been}} granted access. The NBA is therefore allocated only one access in every ten intervals, which is a predetermined interval for all centers.

30|$|Depending on the {{frequency}} reusability over the <b>access</b> link <b>intervals</b> of the downlink, we consider two different allocation schemes: the overlapped and orthogonal allocation schemes. The orthogonal allocation scheme {{corresponds to the}} case for not reusing the subchannels over the <b>access</b> link <b>interval,</b> that is, no subchannels can be shared among the MSs directly served by the BS and those served by the RSs. Meanwhile, the overlapped allocation scheme corresponds to the case where all subchannels in the <b>access</b> link <b>interval</b> are shared among all MSs throughout the cell coverage, {{whether or not the}} MS is directly served by the BS. While allowing for maximizing the bandwidth efficiency, this scheme tends to suffer from co-channel interference. This interference reduces the overall system throughput and furthermore, induces outage events around the subcell edges, as well as the boundary of each cell. As far as a relay link interval is concerned, all corresponding subchannels are orthogonally divided for the RSs and thus, they are not subject to any co-channel interference.|$|R

40|$|Interval {{temporal}} logics {{provide a}} natural framework for {{qualitative and quantitative}} temporal reason- ing over interval structures, where the truth of formulae is defined over intervals rather than points. In this paper, we study {{the complexity of the}} satisfiability problem for Metric Propositional Neigh- borhood Logic (MPNL). MPNL features two modalities to <b>access</b> <b>intervals</b> "to the left" and "to the right" of the current one, respectively, plus an infinite set of length constraints. MPNL, interpreted over the naturals, has been recently shown to be decidable by a doubly exponential procedure. We improve such a result by proving that MPNL is actually EXPSPACE-complete (even when length constraints are encoded in binary), when interpreted over finite structures, the naturals, and the in- tegers, by developing an EXPSPACE decision procedure for MPNL over the integers, which can be easily tailored to finite linear orders and the naturals (EXPSPACE-hardness was already known) ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The {{interval}} {{temporal logic}} AB features two modalities {{that make it}} possible to <b>access</b> <b>intervals</b> which are adjacent {{to the right of the}} current interval (modality 〈A〉) and proper subintervals that have the same left endpoint of it (modality 〈B〉). AB is one of the most significant interval logics, as it allows one to express meaningful (metric) properties, while maintaining decidability (undecidability rules over interval logics, AB is EXPSPACE-complete [14]). In an attempt to capture ωS-regular languages with interval logics [15], it was proved that AB extended with an equivalence relation, denoted AB∼, is decidable (non-primitive re-cursive) on the class of finite linear orders and undecidable on N. The question whether the addition of two or more equivalence relations makes finite satisfiability for AB undecidable was left open. In this paper, we answer this question proving that AB∼ 1 ∼ 2 is undecidable. ...|$|R

40|$|The propositional {{interval}} {{logic of}} temporal neighborhood (PNL for short) features two modalities {{that make it}} possible to <b>access</b> <b>intervals</b> adjacent to the right (modality ⟨ A⟩) and to the left (modality ⟨ A¯ ⟩) of the current interval. PNL stands at a central position in the realm of interval temporal logics, as it is expressive enough to encode meaningful temporal conditions and decidable (undecidability rules over interval temporal logics, while PNL is NEXPTIME-complete). Moreover, it is expressively complete with respect to the two-variable fragment of first-order logic extended with a linear order FO 2 [<]. Various extensions of PNL have been studied in the literature, including metric, hybrid, and first-order ones. Here, we study the effects of the addition of an equivalence relation ∼ to Metric PNL (MPNL∼). We first show that the finite satisfiability problem for PNL extended with ∼ is still NEXPTIME-complete. Then, we prove that the same problem for MPNL∼ can be reduced to the decidable 0 – 0 reachability problem for vector addition systems and vice versa (EXPSPACE-hardness immediately follows) ...|$|R
