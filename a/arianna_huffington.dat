CTO Thuan Pham had knowledge of Susan Fowler's sexual harassment allegation at Uber and her manager's threatened retaliation, and did nothing; Kalanick was also reportedly aware of the harassment issues. Uber hired former attorney general Eric Holder to investigate the claims. <b>Arianna</b> <b>Huffington,</b> a member of Uber's board of directors, also oversaw the investigation.

25|$|Gray Davis critics often {{charge that}} he did not respond {{properly}} to the crisis, while his defenders attribute the crisis solely to the corporate accounting scandals and say that Davis did all he could. Some critics on the left, such as <b>Arianna</b> <b>Huffington,</b> alleged that Davis was lulled to inaction by campaign contributions from energy producers. Some of Davis' energy advisers were formerly employed by the same energy speculators who made millions from the crisis. In addition, the Democratic-controlled legislature would sometimes push Davis to act decisively by taking over power plants which were known to have been gamed and place them back under control of the utilities. Some conservatives argued that Davis signed overpriced energy contracts, employed incompetent negotiators and refused to allow prices to rise for residences statewide much like they did in San Diego, which they argue could have given Davis more leverage against the energy traders and encouraged more conservation. The electricity crisis {{is considered one of the}} major factors that led to Davis' recall.|$|E
500|$|In 1971, Levin {{appeared}} in an edition of Face the Music {{along with a}} new panellist, Arianna Stassinopoulos (later known as <b>Arianna</b> <b>Huffington).</b> He was 42; she was 21.

500|$|On January 31, 2006, <b>Arianna</b> <b>Huffington</b> used truthiness in The Huffington Post. Huffington later {{appeared}} as a guest on the March 1, 2006, episode of The Colbert Report. She challenged Colbert on his claim that he had invented the word truthiness. During the interview, Colbert declared, [...] "I'm not a truthiness fanatic; I'm truthiness' father." [...] Huffington corrected him, citing Wikipedia, that he had merely [...] "popularized" [...] the term. Regarding her source, Colbert responded: [...] "Fuck them!" ...|$|E
500|$|... "Politically Inept, with Homer Simpson" [...] satirizes the {{television}} industry. It parodies political television shows from cable news channels such as MSNBC, CNN, and Fox News Channel {{that are similar}} to Gut Check with Homer Simpson. In an article, Mediaite's James Crugnale commented that Homer's personality as he hosts his show is a reference to conservative political commentator Glenn Beck's [...] "over-the-top persona", and wrote that [...] "In a spot-on, cheeky parody of Beck, Homer ostentatiously sobs crocodile tears as he laments a high school in Nebraska replacing football with soccer as a team sport." [...] Adriatica Vel Johnson, the commentator on the political show that Homer first appears on, is a parody of commentator <b>Arianna</b> <b>Huffington.</b>|$|E
500|$|Early in the case, {{political}} commentator {{and columnist}} <b>Arianna</b> <b>Huffington</b> wrote, [...] "If {{you were to}} get your news only from television, you'd think the top issue facing our country right now is an 18-year-old girl named Natalee who went missing in Aruba. Every time one of these stories comes up, like, say, Michael Jackson, when it's finally over I think, what a relief, now {{we can get back}} to real news. But we never do." [...] In March 2008, El Diario commented, [...] "But if doubts persist about cases involving missing Latinos, there are reasons why. These cases rarely receive the attention and resources we see given to other missing persons. The English language media, for example, appear to be focused on the stories of missing white women, such as with the disappearance of Natalee Holloway in Aruba. Cases of missing Latino and African-American women often remain faceless, if and when they are even covered." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{the night}} {{following}} the announcement, the pledged number of attendees {{to the event}} reached 69,000 on Facebook. This number far exceeded the 25,000 that the rally organizers had indicated as the estimated number of attendees on the National Park Service application for a rally permit. The demand for hotels {{during the period of}} the Rally to Restore Sanity and/or Fear outpaced that of the [...] "Restoring Honor" [...] rally. The rally spawned several grassroots websites and Facebook groups for organizing and discussion, some with more than 10,000 followers. Proposals were made for dozens of sister rallies in other major cities, such as Seattle, Chicago, Austin, and Los Angeles to take place on the same day as the demonstration in Washington, D.C. On September 28, <b>Arianna</b> <b>Huffington</b> announced on The Daily Show that The Huffington Post would provide [...] "as many buses as people to fill them" [...] at a specified meeting place in Manhattan, although her plans were later scaled back and preregistration was imposed.|$|E
500|$|For the 2007 dinner, the White House Correspondents' Association {{brought back}} the less {{controversial}} Rich Little. <b>Arianna</b> <b>Huffington</b> reported that Colbert {{told her he had}} specifically avoided reading any reviews of his performance, and remained unaware of the public's reaction. On June 13, 2007, he was presented with a Spike TV Guys' Choice Award for [...] "Gutsiest Move". He accepted the award via video conference. Six months later, New York Times columnist Frank Rich called Colbert's after-dinner speech a [...] "cultural primary", christening it the [...] "defining moment" [...] of the United States' 2006 midterm elections. Three and a half years after the speech, Frank Rich referenced it again, calling it [...] "brilliant" [...] and [...] "good for the country", while columnist Dan Savage referred to it as [...] "one of the things that kept people like me sane during the darkest days of the Bush years". The editor of The Realist, Paul Krassner, later put Colbert's performance in historical context, saying that it stands out among contemporary US satire as the only example of the spirit of the satire of Lenny Bruce, George Carlin, and Richard Pryor, which took risks and broke barriers to free speech, [...] "rather than just proudly exercising it as comedians do now." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{aftermath}} of the debate was swift. On September 30, author <b>Arianna</b> <b>Huffington</b> withdrew her candidacy on the Larry King Live television program and announced that she was opposing the recall entirely in light of Arnold Schwarzenegger's surge in the polls. [...] Apparently in response to her withdrawal, Cruz Bustamante endorsed her plan for public financing of election campaigns, an intended anti-corruption measure.|$|E
2500|$|In an onstage {{discussion}} with The Huffington Post co-founder <b>Arianna</b> <b>Huffington,</b> during Advertising Week 2010 in New York, Facebook's Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg {{said she had}} seen the film and it was [...] "very Hollywood" [...] and mainly [...] "fiction". [...] "In real life, he [...] was just sitting around with his friends in front of his computer, ordering pizza," [...] she declared. [...] "Who wants to go see that for two hours?" ...|$|E
2500|$|On January 31, 2011, AOL {{announced}} {{the acquisition of}} European video distribution network, goviral. [...] On February 7, AOL bought The Huffington Post for $315million.

Cruz Bustamante, Green Party candidate Peter Camejo, Republican State Senator Tom McClintock, {{and former}} baseball commissioner Peter Ueberroth—participated {{in a live}} television debate. Noticeably absent was Arnold Schwarzenegger who opponents charged was not adequately prepared. Schwarzenegger had repeatedly stated {{that he would not}} participate in such events until later in the election cycle. [...] Prior to this first debate, Gov. Davis spent 30 minutes answering questions from a panel of journalists and voters.|$|E
2500|$|Ephron's {{marriage}} with Bernstein ended acrimoniously, {{and after the}} breakup Ephron was open about the identity of Deep Throat. She revealed his identity to her son Jacob and anyone else who asked. She once commented, [...] "I would give speeches to 500 people and someone would say, 'Do you know who Deep Throat is?' And I would say, 'It's Mark Felt.'" [...] Classmates of Jacob Bernstein at the Dalton School and Vassar College recall Jacob's revealing to numerous people that Felt was Deep Throat. This revelation attracted little media attention during the many years that the identity of Deep Throat was a mystery. Ephron later conceded that [...] "No one, apart from my sons, believed me." [...] Ephron was invited by <b>Arianna</b> <b>Huffington</b> {{to write about the}} experience in the Huffington Post, for which she was a regular blogger and part-time editor.|$|E
2500|$|In {{addition}} to directing some television work, Bogdanovich returned to acting with a recurring guest {{role on the}} cable television series The Sopranos, playing Dr. Melfi's psychotherapist, also later directing a fifth-season episode. He also voiced the analyst of Bart Simpson's therapist in an episode of The Simpsons, and appeared as himself in the [...] "Robots Versus Wrestlers" [...] episode of How I Met Your Mother along with <b>Arianna</b> <b>Huffington</b> and Will Shortz. Quentin Tarantino also cast Bogdanovich as a disc jockey in [...] and [...] [...] "Quentin knows, because he's such a movie buff, that when you hear a disc jockey's voice in my pictures, it's always me, sometimes doing different voices," [...] said Bogdanovich. [...] "So he called me and he said, 'I stole your voice from The Last Picture Show for the rough cut, but I need you {{to come down and}} do that voice again for my picture...'" ...|$|E
2500|$|Linguist George Lakoff {{argued that}} the [...] "ad has raised vital {{questions}} that need a thorough and open discussion. The ad worked brilliantly to reveal, via its framing, an essential but previously hidden truth: the Bush Administration and its active supporters have betrayed {{the trust of the}} troops and the American people." [...] Liberal blogger <b>Arianna</b> <b>Huffington</b> argued that [...] "Was the MoveOn ad blunt? Yes. Did it go for the ? No doubt. But while the way it chose to make its points can be debated, the accuracy of those points cannot." [...] Anti-war activist and Congressional candidate Cindy Sheehan stated that [...] "I have often been critical of MoveOn.org, basically because I feel, for the most part that they support Democrats to the detriment of democracy... The occupation of Iraq is a disaster and I applaud MoveOn for moving a little closer to the true 'anti-war' movement and encourage them to come with us farther." ...|$|E
2500|$|The public, due to {{the complex}} nature of the energy crisis, held Davis partly responsible. General {{speculation}} regarding the factors influencing the recall's outcome continues to center {{on the idea that}} Californians simply voted for a [...] "change" [...] because Davis had mismanaged the events leading up to the energy crisis, e.g., Davis had not fought more vigorously for Californians against the energy fraud nor had he pushed for legislative or emergency executive action soon enough; because Davis had signed deals agreeing to pay energy companies fixed yet inflated prices for years to come based on those paid during the crisis; and/or because the fraudulent corporations had prevailed, and a corporate-friendly Republican governor could politically shield California from further corporate fraud. Others speculated that the corporations involved sought not only profit, but were acting in concert with Republican political allies to cause political damage to the nationally influential Democratic governor. [...] Still others, such as <b>Arianna</b> <b>Huffington,</b> argued that Davis' persistent fundraising and campaign contributions from various companies, including energy companies, made him unable to confront his contributors. Davis accepted $2,000,000 from the California Correctional Peace Officers Association and used his political connections to pass an estimated $5,000,000,000 raise for them over the coming years. This led many people throughout California to believe Davis was guilty of corruption even if he did not meet the standard necessary for prosecution.|$|E
2500|$|Author Ben Arment {{describes}} Armstrong as [...] "turning {{the company}} into a local news service", evolving AOL into a [...] "journalism business that reports local news and filters {{the best of}} the Web". One of the strengths of Armstrong's strategy and focus on digital journalism is catering for local communities, particularly those who are devoid of their own newspapers. Consolidating the move into journalism came in June 2011 with the acquisition of The Huffington Post. The Huffington Post Media Group was established to integrate the newspaper and AOL's News, Tech, Women, Local, Multicultural, Entertainment, Video, and Community portals in a merger which was estimated at the time [...] to reach 117 million Americans and 270 million people worldwide. Armstrong appointed <b>Arianna</b> <b>Huffington,</b> the co-founder and editor-in-chief of the paper as president. He stated of the merger: [...] "The acquisition of The Huffington Post will create a next-generation American media company with global reach that combines content, community, and social experiences for consumers. Together, our companies will embrace the digital future and become a digital destination that delivers unmatched experiences for both consumers and advertisers." [...] A [...] strong advocate of women's issues, Armstrong launched a number of sites under the AOL banner which specifically cater to women, including StyleList.com, AOL Shopping, and KitchenDaily.com, and 60% of the readers at Patch Media are female. In his business meetings and discussions, Armstrong, who can work up to 80 hours a week, is known to be a keen listener, and promotes an atmosphere in which executives can be outspoken and constructive with their input.|$|E
