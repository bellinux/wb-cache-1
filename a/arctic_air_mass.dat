500|$|From September through May, extratropical {{cyclones}} {{from the}} Pacific Ocean move inland {{into the region}} due to a southward migration of the jet stream during the cold season. [...] This shift in the jet stream brings much of the annual precipitation to the region, and also brings the potential for heavy rain events. [...] The West Coast occasionally experiences ocean-effect showers, usually {{in the form of}} rain at lower elevations south of the mouth of the Columbia River. [...] These occur whenever an <b>Arctic</b> <b>air</b> <b>mass</b> from western Canada is drawn westward out over the Pacific Ocean, typically by way of the Fraser Valley, returning shoreward around a center of low pressure. [...] Strong onshore flow is brought into the mountain ranges of the west, focusing significant precipitation into the Rocky Mountains, with rain shadows occurring in the Harney Basin, Great Basin, the central valley of California, and the lower Colorado River valley. [...] In general, rainfall amounts are lower on the southern portions of the West coast. [...] The biggest recipients of the precipitation are the coastal ranges such as the Olympic Mountains, the Cascades, and the Sierra Nevada range. [...] Lesser amounts fall upon the Continental Divide. [...] Cold-season precipitation into this region is the main supply of water to area rivers, such as the Colorado River and Rio Grande, and also acts as the main source of water to people living in this portion of the United States. [...] During El Niño events, increased precipitation is expected in California due to a more southerly, zonal, storm track. [...] California also enters a wet pattern when thunderstorm activity within the tropics associated with the Madden–Julian oscillation nears 150E longitude. [...] During La Niña, increased precipitation is diverted into the Pacific Northwest due to a more northerly storm track.|$|E
2500|$|In winter, the Fraser Valley {{occasionally}} plays {{a significant}} role in the weather regime along the west coast of North America as far south as California, acting as a natural outlet for the intensely cold <b>Arctic</b> <b>air</b> <b>mass</b> which typically sits over Western Canada during winter. Under certain meteorological conditions strong winds pour out of the Fraser Valley and over the relatively warmer waters of the Strait of Georgia and the Strait of Juan de Fuca. This can cause ocean-effect snow, especially between Port Angeles and Sequim, where the air mass collides with the Olympic Mountains. The cold air from the Fraser Valley can also flow out over the Pacific Ocean. Lanes of convective ocean-effect clouds and showers are produced as heat and moisture modify the very dry, frigid air mass. [...] These then typically organize as a low pressure system which returns the showers to the coast south of Canada, often bringing snow to unusually low elevations.|$|E
5000|$|The Arctic {{front is}} the semipermanent, {{semi-continuous}} weather front between the cold <b>arctic</b> <b>air</b> <b>mass</b> and the warmer {{air of the}} polar cell. It can also {{be defined as the}} southern boundary of the <b>Arctic</b> <b>air</b> <b>mass.</b> [...] Mesoscale cyclones known as polar lows can form along the arctic front in the wake of extratropical cyclones. Arctic air masses in their wake are shallow with a deep layer of stable air above the shallow cold cool.|$|E

5000|$|The {{morning of}} November 11, 1940 {{brought with it}} unseasonably high {{temperatures}}. By early afternoon, temperatures had warmed into the lower to middle 60s °F (18 °C) {{over most of the}} affected region. However, as the day wore on conditions quickly deteriorated. Temperatures dropped sharply, winds picked up and rain, followed by sleet and then snow, began to fall. An intense low pressure system had tracked from the southern plains northeastward into western Wisconsin, pulling Gulf of Mexico moisture up from the south and pulling down a cold <b>arctic</b> <b>air</b> <b>mass</b> from the north.|$|E
50|$|On the Lower Mainland and Eastern Vancouver Island of British Columbia, {{where they}} are mainly {{referred}} to as outflow winds, they are noticeable especially in the winter, when a cold <b>Arctic</b> <b>air</b> <b>mass</b> holding in the high plateau country of the interior flows down to the sea through the canyons and lower passes piercing the Coast Mountains and crossing the Strait of Georgia.

50|$|The {{formation}} of climate in Azerbaijan is influenced particularly by cold <b>arctic</b> <b>air</b> <b>masses</b> of Scandinavian anticyclone, temperate of Siberian anticyclone, and Central Asian anticyclone.

50|$|The West Coast {{occasionally}} experiences ocean-effect showers, {{usually in}} the form of rain at lower elevations south of about the mouth of the Columbia River. These occur whenever an <b>Arctic</b> <b>air</b> <b>mass</b> from western Canada is drawn westward out over the Pacific Ocean, typically by way of the Fraser Valley, returning shoreward around a center of low pressure. Cold air flowing southwest from the Fraser Valley can also pick up moisture over the Strait of Georgia and Strait of Juan de Fuca, then rise over the northeastern slopes of the Olympic Mountains, producing heavy, localized snow between Port Angeles and Sequim, as well as areas in Kitsap County and the Puget Sound region.|$|E
5000|$|Extratropical {{cyclones}} {{can bring}} cold and dangerous conditions with heavy rain and snow with winds exceeding 119 km/h (74 mph), (sometimes {{referred to as}} windstorms in Europe). The band of precipitation {{that is associated with}} their warm front is often extensive, forced by weak upward vertical motion of air over the frontal boundary which condenses as it cools and produces precipitation within an elongated band, which is wide and stratiform, meaning falling out of nimbostratus clouds. [...] When moist air tries to dislodge an <b>arctic</b> <b>air</b> <b>mass,</b> overrunning snow can result within the poleward side of the elongated precipitation band. In the Northern Hemisphere, poleward is towards the North Pole, or north. Within the Southern Hemisphere, poleward is towards the South Pole, or south.|$|E

5000|$|Highs are {{frequently}} associated with light winds {{at the surface}} and subsidence through the lower portion of the troposphere. In general, subsidence will dry out an <b>air</b> <b>mass</b> by adiabatic, or compressional, heating. [...] Thus, high pressure typically brings clear skies. [...] During the day, since no clouds are present to reflect sunlight, there is more incoming shortwave solar radiation and temperatures rise. At night, the absence of clouds means that outgoing longwave radiation (i.e. heat energy from the surface) is not absorbed, giving cooler diurnal low temperatures in all seasons.
