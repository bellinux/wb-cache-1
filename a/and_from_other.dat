5|$|Initially {{there was}} no system in place to allow prisoners to send letters; {{censorship}} arrangements were made through the Dominion Police in Ottawa, and the American Consul was designated a representative for prisoner welfare. As the war progressed, groups of detainees were transferred to <b>and</b> <b>from</b> <b>other</b> prisons according to their behaviour or level of risk {{and the number of}} inmates per institution. After the 1917 Halifax Explosion, prisoners were transferred to the 800-man Amherst Internment Camp at Amherst, Nova Scotia. One of the prisoners transferred may have been Leon Trotsky, although this is disputed.|$|E
5|$|In 1980, the {{management}} of Braathens SAFE decided that it needed larger aircraft if the company was to stay competitive on charter flights. Larger aircraft could be put into service on the main services from Oslo, Gothenburg and Stockholm, while the 737s {{could be used to}} smaller destination <b>and</b> <b>from</b> <b>other</b> cities. On 25 February 1980, the company announced that it had ordered two Boeing 767-200 planes, with an option for two addition craft. The cost of the two firm orders was about NOK500 million. This would allow the aircraft to be used for both domestic scheduled flights and for charter, and was configured with 242 seats. This was less than charter-only airlines, for instance Britannia had their planes configured with 273 seats. Braathens SAFE's planes were delivered on 23 March and in November 1984. The following year showed increasing charter traffic, although it only made up 25% of the company's revenue. The company had considered the smaller Boeing 757, but did not have sufficient range. Also the Airbus A310 was close to being chosen.|$|E

5|$|In 1994, John Mulvihill, who {{operated}} the Red Fox Inn at the Kerry Bog Village in Glenbeigh, County Kerry, began {{a search for}} remnants of the Kerry Bog Pony population, despite reports that the breed was extinct. He eventually found 20 ponies that resembled those he remembered from his childhood, and removed them from the bog to his stables. In 1995, he had blood typing performed on the ponies by Weatherby's Ireland, which identified their DNA markers. Subsequent DNA testing showed them to be a unique breed that formed a separate population from other local ponies <b>and</b> <b>from</b> <b>other</b> breeds in Ireland and Great Britain. Of these 20 ponies, only one was a stallion, named Flashy Fox. Between 1995 and 2012, he sired more than 140 foals, and {{played a significant role}} in repopulating the breed.|$|E
5|$|In Johannesburg in the 1950s, {{crime was}} a day-to-day reality, and Sophiatown was {{the nucleus of}} all reef crimes. Gangsters were city-bred and spoke a mixture of Afrikaans and English, known as tsotsitaal. Some of the more {{well-known}} gangs in Sophiatown were the Russians, the Americans, the Gestapo, the Berliners and the Vultures. The names the Gestapo and the Berliners reflect their admiration for Hitler, whom they saw {{as some kind of}} hero, for taking on the whites of Europe. The best known gang from this period, and also best studied, was the Russians. They were a group of Basotho migrant workers who banded together {{in the absence of any}} effective law enforcement by either mine owners or the state. The primary goal of this gang was to protect members from the tsotsis <b>and</b> <b>from</b> <b>other</b> gangs of migrant workers, and to acquire and defend resources they found desirable - most notably women, jobs and the urban space necessary for the parties and staged fights that formed the bulk of their weekend entertainment.|$|E
5|$|Panellus stipticus is one {{of several}} dozen species of fungi that are bioluminescent. Strains from eastern North America are {{typically}} bioluminescent, but those from the Pacific coast regions of North America <b>and</b> <b>from</b> <b>other</b> continents are not. The luminescence is localized to the edges of the gills and the junction of the gills with the stem and cap. Bioluminescence is also observable with mycelia grown in laboratory culture, and the growth conditions for optimal light production have been studied in detail. Several chemicals have been isolated and characterized that are believed to be responsible for light production. Genetic analysis has shown that luminescence is controlled by a single dominant allele. The luminescent glow of this and other fungi inspired the term foxfire, coined by early settlers in eastern and southern North America. Modern research has probed the potential of P.stipticus as a tool in bioremediation, because of its ability to detoxify various environmental pollutants.|$|E
