The scatter-ometer measurement errors are best characterized in terms of random component errors, which are about 0. 75 and 1. 5 m s 1 for the along-wind and crosswind components, respectively. The NSCAT and QuikSCAT datasets provide a consistent baseline from which recent changes in the <b>accuracies</b> <b>of</b> 10 -m wind analyses from the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) and the U. S. National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) operational numerical weather prediction (NWP) models are assessed from consideration of three time periods: September 1996 –June 1997, August 1999 –July 2000, and February 2002 –January 2003. These correspond, respectively, to the 9. 5 -month duration of the NSCAT mission, the first 12 months of the QuikSCAT mission, and {{the first year after}} both ECMWF and NCEP began assimilating QuikSCAT observations. There were large im-provements in the <b>accuracies</b> <b>of</b> <b>both</b> NWP models between the 1997 and 2000 time periods. Though modest in comparison, there were further improvements in 2002, at least partly attributable to the assimilation of QuikSCAT observations in both models. There is no evidence of bias in the 10 -m wind speeds in the NCEP model. The 10 -m wind speeds in the ECMWF model, however, are shown to be biased low by about 0. 4 m s 1. While it is difficult to eliminate systematic errors this small, a bias of 0. 4 m s 1 corresponds to a typical wind stress bias of more than 10 %. This wind stress bias increases to nearly 20 % if atmospheric stability effects are not taken into account. Biases of these magnitudes will result in significant systematic errors in ocean general circulation models that are forced by ECMWF winds. 1...|$|R

50|$|Energy-dispersive x-ray {{spectroscopy}} (EDS) and {{electron energy}} loss spectroscopy (EELS) {{are commonly used}} techniques to both qualitatively and quantitatively probe the composition of samples in the TEM. A primary challenge in the quantitative <b>accuracy</b> <b>of</b> <b>both</b> techniques is the phenomenon of channelling. Put simply, in a crystalline solid, the probability of interaction between an electron and ion in the lattice depends strongly on the momentum (direction and velocity) of the electron. When probing a sample under diffraction conditions near a zone axis, {{as is often the}} case in EDS and EELS applications, channelling can have a large impact on the effective interaction of the incident electrons with specific ions in the crystal structure. In practice, this can lead to erroneous measurements of composition that depend strongly on the orientation and thickness of the sample and the accelerating voltage. Since PED entails an integration over incident directions of the electron probe, and generally does not include beams parallel to the zone axis, the detrimental channeling effects outlined above can be minimized, yielding far more accurate composition measurements in both techniques.|$|E

5000|$|Wing Commander Hampshire has {{commanded}} No. 22 (Intruder) Squadron since 7 December 1942, {{during the}} greater part of this Squadrons outstanding operations against the enemy in Papua. He has performed several deeds of heroism which have marked him as a Pilot and a leader of outstanding merit.On 14 December 1942, Hampshire led a formation of Boston aircraft whose mission was to locate and attack an attempted enemy landing in the vicinity of Buna. Foul weather caused the formation to separate but at 0520 hours Wing Commander Hampshire, flying alone, located five Japanese Destroyers disembarking troops and equipment approximately 20 miles North-East of Cape Ward-Hunt. In the face of intense anti-aircraft fire he immediately attacked a Destroyer and dropped two 500 lb. bombs achieving near misses. As stores and troops were primary targets, Wing Commander Hampshire directed his attention to these until both bombs and ammunition were exhausted. The <b>accuracy</b> <b>of</b> <b>both</b> bombing and strafing wrought havoc amidst the landing operations {{and as a result of}} his location of the enemy vessels, a heavy Squadron was able to attack shortly afterwards.On 4 February 1943, he again led a formation to attack grounded aircraft on Lae strip. Again extremely bad weather was encountered and it was only by the sheer grit and determination of Wing Commander Hampshire that the formation was led to the target. Eight passes over the target area had to be made before the target was actually identified and the formation was subjected to intense anti-aircraft opposition throughout. Wing Commander Hampshire drove home the attack and led his formation successfully back to base.On 5 March 1943, Wing Commander Hampshire led a formation which was detailed to bomb and strafe Lae strip at first light. Whilst leading the formation into line for the run over the target, intense anti-aircraft fire was encountered which struck his aircraft and wounded him in the leg. Despite the wound and consequent loss of blood, he drove home the attack with great determination and led his formation back to base. He was later removed to hospital where an operation was performed to remove shrapnel from his leg.On 16 March 1943, although not recovered from his wound and with his leg heavily bandaged, he insisted on leading a further formation over Salamaua. As heavy anti-aircraft opposition was anticipated and as the run over the target took the formation directly over four strong anti-aircraft posts, Wing Commander Hampshire assigned to himself the task of attacking those posts by bombing and strafing in order to reduce the opposition against the remainder of the formation and so ensure more accurate bombing. As a result this strike was the most successful carried out by the Squadron and tremendous damage was done to enemy installations.His Squadron has won a most enviable active service reputation and this reputation is basically due to the brilliant leadership, exceptional courage and never flagging determination of its Commanding Officer. Wing Commander Hampshire has completed 786 operational hours under flying conditions which must rank among the most difficult that exist. [...] Wing Commander Hampshire has commanded the Squadron since December 1943 and has displayed inspiring leadership, great skill and gallantry.Since operating in this country this Officer has shot down three enemy aircraft at night, two of them in one sortie. In the latter of his two fights his aircraft was damaged by flying portions of disintegrating enemy aircraft. Nevertheless, he flew safely to base although his aircraft was almost uncontrollable.This Officers achievements are worthy of the greatest praise and typical of the determination he has shown throughout his operational tour. [...] Since being awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross, Group Captain Hampshire has led 456 Squadron on very many sorties during which 32 enemy aircraft have been destroyed. Much of this success can be attributed to this Officers outstanding leadership and great skill. His iron determination and unfailing devotion to duty have set an example of the highest order.Group Captain Hampshire has inflicted much loss on the enemy including the destruction of seven aircraft.|$|E
