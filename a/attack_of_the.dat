5|$|He {{began his}} {{military}} {{career in the}} artillery of Buenos Aires, during the Spanish–Portuguese War, staying in that unit until {{the signing of the}} First Treaty of San Ildefonso that incorporated the Banda Oriental to the Viceroyalty of the Río de la Plata. With the war concluded, he became a regidor of the Buenos Aires Cabildo. He took the arms again in 1778, during an <b>attack</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> natives, and directed the operations at the fort in San Miguel del Monte. As Spain fought the American Revolutionary War, it was feared that Britain may launch a counteroffensive against the Spanish colonies.

The rest of the army was aligned to their left flank and on 19 September started the last attack major <b>attack</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> campaign.

5|$|Since Lucas refocused {{the film}} on Anakin, {{he had to}} {{sacrifice}} certain extraneous plot points relating to <b>Attack</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Clones. Lucas had previously promised fans that he would explain the mystery behind the erasure of the planet Kamino from the Jedi Archives. However, Lucas abandoned this plot thread in order to {{devote more time to}} Anakin's story, leaving the matter unresolved on film. As a compromise, Lucas permitted author James Luceno to explain the mystery of Kamino's erasure and the origins of the Clone army in his expanded universe novel Labyrinth of Evil.|$|E
5|$|The Democrats recaptured the House {{after the}} 1882 elections, but the {{incoming}} {{majority in the}} 48th Congress was divided on tariffs, with Randall's protectionist faction in the minority. The new Democratic caucus was more Southern and Western than in previous Congresses, and contained many new members who were unfamiliar with Randall. This led many to propose selecting a Speaker {{more in line with}} their own views, rather than returning Randall to the office. Randall's attempt to canvass the incoming representatives was further hampered by an <b>attack</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> gout. In the end, John G. Carlisle of Kentucky, an advocate of tariff reform, bested Randall in a poll of the Democratic caucus by a vote of 104 to 53.|$|E

Walt Disney Imagineering designed the booths to resemble convertibles of the period, and some servers act as carhops while wearing roller skates. While eating, guests watch a large projection screen displaying film clips from such 1950s and 1960s films as Frankenstein Meets the Space Monster, Plan 9 from Outer Space, and <b>Attack</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 50 Foot Woman.|$|E
5|$|The kibbutz was {{established}} in 1926 by pioneers from the Hashomer Hatzair movement, who moved to Mandatory Palestine during the Third Aliyah from Poland. It was the first Jewish settlement {{in the southern part}} of the Jezreel Valley. It soon became a center of the Hashomer Hatzair, particularly since the first regional school of the Kibbutz Arzi network was set up there. In April 1948 the kibbutz was the epicenter of an important battle when it successfully resisted the first large-scale <b>attack</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Arab Liberation Army commanded by Fawzi al-Qawuqji.|$|E

5|$|After rejoining the Emperor at Champaubert, Nansouty {{took part}} to the Battle of Montmirail, where he was at first {{instructed}} to protect the artillery. He then joined in the <b>attack</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Guard infantry on the farm of Ėpine-au-Bois, where he suddenly wheeled left with his men and fell upon unprepared enemy infantry, charging home, routing these troops and subsequently pursuing the fugitives. This combined <b>attack</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Guard resulted in {{a great number of}} prisoners and captured enemy guns, with Nansouty receiving a light wound in the process. A part of his men then took {{part to the}} Battle of Château-Thierry, where the Emperor ordered the Guard cavalry to make a turning move against the enemy left, and where Nansouty's subordinates General Letort and Colonel Curély brilliantly broke several enemy squares. Then, on 14 February, Nansouty personally led a brilliant charge at the Battle of Vauchamps, where he supported Grouchy in a cavalry action that decided the battle. Charging Blücher's men from the front, Nansouty allowed Grouchy to magnificently fall behind the enemy columns, which they both then sabred and crushed, with the Guard cavalry subsequently participating in a highly successful pursuit. Enemy losses reached a staggering 9,000-10,000 casualties, with 25 cannons lost. The Emperor was radiant following this battle, but, by nightfall, his mood changed when he found out of the loss of some Guard horse artillerymen. These men had been captured during their march and it was reported that their capture resulted from General Guyot (one of Nansouty's subordinates) failing to provide an escort and a guide for them. In Nansouty's presence, a fuming Napoleon summoned Guyot and then chastised him for the repeated losses in cannon during the previous battles, as well as for various other shortcomings, such as failing to properly escort the Emperor. After an angry tirade, Napoleon promptly axed Guyot and announced to Nansouty that General Exelmans would replace Guyot at the helm of his Old Guard heavy cavalry. This episode apparently strained relations between Emperor Napoleon and General Nansouty.|$|E
