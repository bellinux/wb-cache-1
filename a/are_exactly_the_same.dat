25|$|The first method {{requires}} single perfect matches {{between the}} query and database sequences i.e. the two k-mer words <b>are</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>the</b> <b>same.</b> This {{approach is not}} considered the most practical. This is because a small k-mer size is {{necessary in order to}} achieve high levels of sensitivity, but this increases the number of false positive hits, thus increasing {{the amount of time spent}} in the alignment stage of the algorithm.|$|E

25|$|Terengganu laksa (Malay: Laksa Terengganu) is {{the easiest}} laksa recipe that is famous among peoples {{from the town of}} Kuala Terengganu of the Terengganu state, located at the east coast of Peninsular Malaysia. The main {{ingredient}} of Terengganu Laksa's sauce is ikan kembong or round scad mackerel that are boiled and minced. The minced fish are fried with onions, garlic, ginger, datil pepper, belacan, kantan flower, Vietnamese coriander or daun kesum, lemon grass and dried tamarind slice. Coconut milk will then be added as the final ingredient and stirred until it is all mixed up and becomes thick. Terengganu Laksa is served just like the Italian spaghetti by adding ulam (raw vegetables) and blended chili on the side. Another variable of Terengganu Laksa is Laksam. The sauce's recipe <b>are</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> but the noodles are a bit bigger and flat.|$|E
25|$|Education writer Richard Wright {{considers}} that Hume's position rejects a famous moral puzzle attributed to French philosopher Jean Buridan. The Buridan's ass puzzle describes a donkey that is hungry. This donkey has {{on both sides}} of him separate bales of hay, which are of equal distances from him. The problem concerns which bale the donkey chooses. Buridan was said to believe that the donkey would die, because he has no autonomy. The donkey is incapable of forming a rational decision as there is no motive to choose one bale of hay over the other. However, human beings are different, because a human who is placed in a position where he is forced to choose one loaf of bread over another will make a decision to take one in lieu of the other. For Buridan, humans have the capacity of autonomy, and he recognises the choice that is ultimately made will be based on chance, as both loaves of bread <b>are</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>the</b> <b>same.</b> However, Wright says that Hume completely rejects this notion, arguing that a human will spontaneously act in such a situation because he is faced with impending death if he fails to do so. Such a decision is not {{made on the basis of}} chance, but rather on necessity and spontaneity, given the prior predetermined events leading up to the predicament.|$|E

500|$|The game's visuals were {{a source}} of {{disagreement}} between some critics. Extended Play's Matthew Keil wrote that the game's visuals are the [...] "most notable improvement" [...] over Rogue Squadron. Mirabella agreed {{and went on to}} call Battle for Naboo [...] "one of the prettiest games to grace the N64." [...] Both Keil and Mirabella praised the game for being less dependent on distance fog and [...] "vastly" [...] improving the draw distance over Rogue Squadron. Davis, however, wrote that [...] "the graphics in Battle for Naboo <b>are</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> as those of Rogue Squadron, flaws and all", and Nintendo Powers Andy Meyers cited [...] "drab backgrounds and dry cinemas". EGM enjoyed the game's models and lighting, but thought the environments looked [...] "blurry". Reviewers' opinions on the game's music and sound effects were generally less divided. Keil stated that the game showcases Factor 5's audio talents, and Mirabella and Davis described the audio as [...] "atmospheric" [...] and [...] "immersive", respectively. [...] One EGM reviewer lamented [...] "the low-quality cartridge EpisodeI music", but another thought the sound was impressive.|$|E
500|$|The Wire {{published}} a favorable review by Joseph Stannard, {{in which he}} wrote [...] "If it is an elaborate put-on—and I suspect Ferraro isn't averse to a chuckle {{at the expense of}} his audience—Far Side Virtual still feels like the culmination of numerous releases' worth of research and development. ... Whether or not its creator is giggling through a bong smoke haze, Far Side Virtual is a convincing evocation of the digital dreamtime." [...] Stefan Wharton of Tiny Mix Tapes' took the album as a statement about blurred boundaries between consumers and their technologies, citing the writing of Markus Giesler as a precedent. Wharton said, [...] "Far Side Virtual succeeds in exciting the collective memory of that generation now so conjoined to its technological appendages." [...] In Pitchforks review, Soderberg wrote, [...] "the songs here <b>are</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> as what they're ostensibly parodying, which is bold and maybe even the point. ... You suddenly realize you're listening to 45 minutes of utilitarian music that doesn't really have a purpose. Can something be utopian and dystopian at the same time? Probably. Maybe even always." ...|$|E

500|$|The Importance of Being Earnests {{popularity}} has meant {{it has been}} translated into many languages, though the homophonous pun in the title ("", a masculine proper name, and [...] "", the virtue of steadfastness and seriousness) poses a special problem for translators. The easiest case of a suitable translation of the pun, perpetuating its sense and meaning, may have been its translation into German. Since English and German are closely related languages, German provides an equivalent adjective ("ernst") and also a matching masculine proper name ("Ernst"). The meaning and tenor of the wordplay <b>are</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>the</b> <b>same.</b> Yet {{there are many different}} possible titles in German, mostly concerning sentence structure. The two most common ones are [...] "Bunbury oder ernst / Ernst sein ist alles" [...] and [...] "Bunbury oder wie wichtig es ist, ernst / Ernst zu sein". In a study of Italian translations, Adrian Pablé found thirteen different versions using eight titles. Since wordplay is often unique to the language in question, translators are faced with a choice of either staying faithful to the original—in this case the English adjective and virtue earnest—or creating a similar pun in their own language.|$|E
