Dave Koz played on all the featured Luther Vandross tracks, which were recorded by various smooth jazz artists.|$|E
25|$|It {{was also}} in the 1970s that Skempton started {{composing}} chamber works, although these were almost <b>always</b> <b>for</b> two performers, since they were written to be performed by the duo of Skempton himself and Michael Parsons. These pieces included a number of horn duos, pieces for two drums, and a duet for piano and woodblocks. Finally, in the 1970s Skempton started playing accordion and composing for this instrument.|$|E
25|$|Phase 4 - Endonormative stabilization: This {{stage is}} {{characterized}} by the gradual acceptance of local norms, supported by a new locally rooted linguistic self-confidence. By this time political events {{have made it clear that}} the settler and indigenous strands are inextricably bound in a sense of nationhood independent of Britain. Acceptance of local English(es) expresses this new identity. National dictionaries are enthusiastically supported, at least for new lexis (and not <b>always</b> <b>for</b> localized grammar). Literary creativity in local English begins to flourish.|$|E

Barker appears in Les Blank's New Orleans documentary, <b>Always</b> <b>for</b> Pleasure, including an interview (with Blue Lu) and several performance sequences.

25|$|Soon after {{recording}} For Your Pleasure, Brian Eno left Roxy Music amidst increasing {{differences with}} Ferry about {{the management of}} the group. The other members of the band are reported to have shared some of Eno's concerns about Ferry's dominance, but they elected to remain. Also, John Gustafson became the band's permanent bass player for the next three studio albums, but not <b>always</b> <b>for</b> live shows; though he toured with Roxy on certain dates in 1973 and 1975, other live Roxy bassists of this period (1973–1976) included Sal Maida, John Wetton and Rick Wills.|$|E
25|$|Despite his adventurous career, mere reminiscences {{obviously}} bored him; he was <b>always</b> <b>for</b> movement, {{for some}} betterment of present or future conditions, and in discussion {{he was a}} master of the art of persuasion, unconsciously creating in those around him a latent desire to follow, if he would lead. The source of such persuasive influence eludes analysis, and, like the mystery of leadership, is probably more psychic than mental. In this latter respect, Jameson was splendidly equipped; he had greater power of concentration, of logical reasoning, and of rapid diagnosis, while on his lighter side he was brilliant in repartee and in the exercise of a badinage that was both cynical and personal...|$|E

Typically, the satimata occurs in the dreams of the family members, teaching for example, the women how to be good pativratas, herself through her sacrifice having proved she was the perfect pativrata. However, although the satimata's intentions are <b>always</b> <b>for</b> the good of the family, she is not averse to let, for example, children become sick, or the cows' udders wither, if she thinks this is an appropriate lesson to the living wife who had neglected her duties as pativrata.|$|E
25|$|The French {{progressively}} assumed more of {{the important}} administrative positions, and by 1884 they supervised all Tunisian government bureaus dealing with finance, post, education, telegraph, public works and agriculture. They decided to guarantee the Tunisian debt, and then abolished the international finance commission. French settlements in the country were actively encouraged; the number of French colonists grew from 34,000 in 1906 to 144,000 in 1945, occupying approximately one-fifth of the cultivated land. Roads, ports, railroads, and mines were developed. In rural areas the French administration strengthened the local officials (qa'ids) and weakened the independent tribes. An additional judicial system was established for Europeans but available generally, set up without interfering with the existing Sharia courts, available as <b>always</b> <b>for</b> the legal matters of Tunisians.|$|E
25|$|Goring's {{return to}} the west had already been {{countermanded}} {{and he had been}} directed to march to Harborough, while the South Wales Royalists were also called in towards Leicester. Later orders on 26 May directed him to Newbury, whence he was to feel the strength of the enemy's positions around Oxford. It is hardly necessary to say that Goring found good military reasons for continuing his independent operations, and marched off towards Taunton regardless of the order. He redressed the balance there for the moment by overawing Massey's weak force, and his purse profited considerably by fresh opportunities for extortion, but he and his men were not at Naseby. Meanwhile, the King, at the geographical centre of England, found an important and wealthy town at his mercy. Rupert, <b>always</b> <b>for</b> action, took the opportunity, and Leicester was stormed and thoroughly pillaged {{on the night of the}} 30 May31 May.|$|E

500|$|For Kenyatta, {{independence}} meant {{not just}} self-rule, but {{an end to}} the colour bar and to the patronising attitudes and racist slang of Kenya's white minority. According to Murray-Brown, Kenyatta's [...] "basic philosophy" [...] throughout his life was that [...] "all men deserved the right to develop peacefully according to their own wishes". Kenyatta expressed this in his statement that [...] "I have stood <b>always</b> <b>for</b> the purposes of human dignity in freedom, and for the values of tolerance and peace." [...] This approach was similar to the Zambian President Kenneth Kaunda's ideology of [...] "African humanism".|$|E
500|$|He was poignantly mourned in Philadelphia as {{a benevolent}} {{employer}} of over 3,000 and a rare businessman who treated his employees exceptionally well.

[...] He was reported in 1889 to give $17,000 in Christmas gifts to his employees. His philanthropy branched out in other areas as well. In 1882 he sponsored the immigration of approximately 40 or 50 Russian Jewish families and purchased homes for them, assuring they would settle in Pennsylvania.|$|E

[...] Robyn would leave Cyan to form a new development company called Land of Point; Vander Wende would also leave to pursue other projects. The next video game entry in the Myst franchise would be 2001's , which was not developed by Cyan nor published by Brøderbund. Presto Studios took over development; Ubisoft acquired Brøderbund's entertainment library from The Learning Company and published the Myst sequels.|$|E

Nansen's {{daughter}} Liv recorded that there were no speeches, just music: Schubert's Death and the Maiden, which Eva used to sing. Among the many tributes paid to him subsequently was that of Lord Robert Cecil, a fellow League of Nations delegate, who spoke of the range of Nansen's work, done with no regard for his own interests or health: [...] "Every good cause had his support.

[...] Rather than a villain, Heller wrote her to be [...] "a real life force. Everything she's doing is for the good of her family, her children. No matter how evil it gets, it's <b>always</b> <b>for</b> good reason." [...] Walker was pleased with her [...] "very complex character. I found it exciting to play such massive emotions and deal with such interesting, to say the least, situations. I saw it as a huge challenge, and I have huge admiration for this character.

Critics, including Glamour magazine's Hayley Spencer, The Huffington Post Jenavieve Hatch, and Rachael Moon of the Daily Mirror, praised it. According to Cosmopolitan magazine's Nikki Kinstlinger and Georgia Simmonds of Marie Claire, Ratajkowski finds self-empowerment in defining and owning the expression of her sexuality and body. Salon Erin Coulehan {{described the}} essay's identification of a societal catch-22, in which showcasing female sexuality that may [...] "offend, excite, or create envy" [...] leads to criticism and body shaming. InStyle Isabella Silvers concurred that [...] "female sexuality isn't <b>always</b> <b>for</b> the benefit of someone else". Charlotte Gill of The Independent admitted {{that she was in}} the minority in finding the letter [...] "rambling" [...] and [...] "dull".|$|E
