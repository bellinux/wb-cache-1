50|$|Until 2015, the Indian <b>paradise</b> <b>flycatcher,</b> Blyth's <b>paradise</b> <b>flycatcher,</b> and the Amur <b>paradise</b> <b>flycatcher</b> {{were all}} {{considered}} conspecific, and together called the Asian <b>paradise</b> <b>flycatcher.</b>|$|R
50|$|The Malagasy <b>paradise</b> <b>flycatcher</b> {{is thought}} to have evolved from African ancestors, as it appears to be more closely related to the African <b>paradise</b> <b>flycatcher</b> than the Indian <b>paradise</b> <b>flycatcher.</b>|$|R
50|$|The Annobón <b>paradise</b> <b>flycatcher</b> was {{previously}} classified with the Old World flycatcher family Muscicapidae, but the <b>paradise</b> <b>flycatchers,</b> monarch flycatchers and Australasian fantails are now normally grouped with the drongos {{in the family}} Dicruridae, which has most of its members in Australasia and tropical southern Asia. Within its genus, the Annobón flycatcher was split from the red-bellied <b>paradise</b> <b>flycatcher</b> in 2009 by the IOC. Some other authorities continue to treat the Annobón <b>paradise</b> <b>flycatcher</b> as a subspecies of the red-bellied <b>paradise</b> <b>flycatcher</b> (T. rufiventer smithii).|$|R

50|$|The Japanese <b>paradise</b> <b>flycatcher</b> (Terpsiphone atrocaudata), {{also called}} the black <b>paradise</b> <b>flycatcher,</b> is a {{medium-sized}} passerine bird native to southeastern Asia. It is a glossy black, chestnut and white bird, slightly smaller than either the Amur <b>paradise</b> <b>flycatcher</b> or Blyth's <b>paradise</b> <b>flycatcher,</b> but similar in appearance. Males have exceptionally long tails. Females are generally duller in appearance and have shorter tails.|$|R

5000|$|Blyth's <b>paradise</b> <b>flycatcher</b> (Terpsiphone affinis) {{also called}} the oriental <b>paradise</b> <b>flycatcher,</b> is a species of bird in the family Monarchidae.It is found from {{southern}} China to Sumatra and Melanesia. Formerly, it was considered a subspecies of the Asian <b>paradise</b> <b>flycatcher</b> until elevated to species rank by the IOC in 2015.|$|R
50|$|The African <b>paradise</b> <b>flycatcher</b> was {{originally}} {{described in the}} genus Muscicapa. Alternate names include the grey-headed <b>paradise</b> <b>flycatcher,</b> red-winged paradise-flycatcher and Southern paradise-flycatcher.|$|R
50|$|Several {{species of}} <b>paradise</b> <b>flycatcher</b> are migratory. The Japanese <b>paradise</b> <b>flycatcher</b> {{is almost entirely}} migratory, {{breeding}} in Korea and Japan and wintering in the Philippines, Malaysia and Sumatra. It does however also occur in Taiwan, where the population is apparently resident. The Indian <b>paradise</b> <b>flycatcher</b> ranges across the Indian subcontinent and adjoining regions. The movements of the other species are not fully understood, but most {{are thought to be}} resident. Several subspecies of the African <b>paradise</b> <b>flycatcher</b> are apparently intra-African migrants, but little is known about these movements.|$|R
50|$|The Ceylon <b>paradise</b> <b>flycatcher</b> is the {{resident}} subspecies {{out of the}} two subspecies of Indian <b>paradise</b> <b>flycatcher</b> found in Sri Lanka.The taxon was described by Nikolai Alekseyvich Zarudny & Hermann Härms in 1912.|$|R
50|$|This species readily hybridizes {{with the}} genetically similar Rufous-vented <b>paradise</b> <b>flycatcher.</b> The red-bellied <b>paradise</b> <b>flycatcher</b> is also {{closely related to}} this species, and hybrids occur with the underparts a mixture of black and red.|$|R
50|$|Its name commemorates the American ornithologist George Latimer Bates. Bates's <b>paradise</b> <b>flycatcher</b> was {{formerly}} {{considered as a}} subspecies of the rufous-vented <b>paradise</b> <b>flycatcher</b> but is now recognized as a separate species. An alternate name is the Cameroon rufous-vented paradise-flycatcher.|$|R
50|$|The Japanese <b>paradise</b> <b>flycatcher</b> {{is similar}} in {{appearance}} to both the Amur <b>paradise</b> <b>flycatcher</b> and Blyth's <b>paradise</b> <b>flycatcher,</b> but is slightly smaller. Mature males have a black hood with a purplish-blue gloss which shades into blackish-grey on the chest. The underparts are off-white to white. The mantle, back, wings and rump are plain dark chestnut. The tail has extremely long black central feathers, which are shorter in immature males. Unlike the Asian <b>paradise</b> <b>flycatcher</b> there is no white morph. The female resembles the male but is duller and darker brown on the chestnut areas. It has black legs and feet, a large black eye with a blue eye-ring, and a short blue bill.|$|R
50|$|The <b>paradise</b> <b>flycatchers</b> are {{generally}} small birds, around 18 to(-) 21 cm {{in length and}} weighing 12 to(-) 23 g. They have a medium length grey or blueish bill which is broad and hooked {{at the end and}} is surrounded by stiff rictal bristles. The inside of the mouths of paradise-flycatchers are brightly coloured, being either yellow or green. The tails are long, particularly in many species where the male has a massively elongated pair of middle tail feathers. These tail streamers are 195 mm long in the male São Tomé <b>paradise</b> <b>flycatcher</b> and 412 mm long in the male Indian <b>paradise</b> <b>flycatcher.</b> The function of the long tail is assumed to be related to sexual selection, with females choosing males based on the length of the tail. Not all species have long tail streamers, for example the blue <b>paradise</b> <b>flycatcher</b> of Palawan in Asia and the Bedford's <b>paradise</b> <b>flycatcher</b> of montane Africa do not have exceptionally long tails. In most species the tail is longer than the wing, even in the shorter tailed females. The eye is surrounded by an eyering that is a blue thin wattle (slightly more pronounced in some species like the rufous <b>paradise</b> <b>flycatcher).</b>|$|R
25|$|While the {{majority}} of monarchs are resident, a few species are partially migratory and one, the satin flycatcher, is fully migratory, although the Japanese <b>paradise</b> <b>flycatcher</b> is almost entirely migratory. The African <b>paradise</b> <b>flycatcher</b> makes a series of poorly understood intra-African migratory movements.|$|R
50|$|The Amur <b>paradise</b> <b>flycatcher</b> (Terpsiphone incei) is {{a species}} of bird in the family Monarchidae.It is found in China and Manchuria. It is a winter migrant to Southeast Asia. Until 2015, it was {{considered}} as a subspecies of the Asian <b>paradise</b> <b>flycatcher.</b>|$|R

50|$|The plumage of the <b>paradise</b> <b>flycatchers</b> is sexually dimorphic, with rufous, {{white and}} black being the most common colours; one species has blue plumage and a few have traces of maroon. Sexual {{dimorphism}} can be pronounced (and of course more so in the long-tailed males) or subtle; the female Bedford's <b>paradise</b> <b>flycatcher</b> {{is identical to the}} male except slightly duller. Some species sport prominent crests. In some species, for example the Malagasy <b>paradise</b> <b>flycatcher,</b> the males have two or more colour morphs.|$|R

50|$|The Ceylon <b>paradise</b> <b>flycatcher</b> (Terpsiphone paradisi ceylonensis), {{also known}} as the Sri Lanka <b>paradise</b> <b>flycatcher</b> is a {{subspecies}} of the Indian <b>paradise</b> <b>flycatcher.</b> It is a resident subspecies and remains in Sri Lanka throughout the year, its typical habitat being the understory of dry lowland forest. It also occurs in gardens and dry hilly areas, and moves {{to other parts of the}} island outside the breeding season. The birds have black heads and chestnut upper parts, and the male has a black crest, and a much longer tail than the female.|$|R
5000|$|When Carl Linnaeus first {{described}} the Malagasy <b>paradise</b> <b>flycatcher</b> in 1766, he assigned {{it to the}} genus Muscicapa, which contained many of the Old World flycatchers. The species remained in that genus until 1827, when Constantin Wilhelm Lambert Gloger created the genus Terpsiphone for the <b>paradise</b> <b>flycatchers.</b> [...] The genus name Terpsiphone comes from the Greek words terpsi, meaning [...] "delighted in" [...] (from terpo, [...] "to delight") and phone, meaning [...] "voice". The species name, mutata is Latin for [...] "changed" [...] or [...] "different". An alternate common name is the Madagascar <b>paradise</b> <b>flycatcher.</b>|$|R
5000|$|A {{number of}} diurnal raptors, {{including}} Frances's sparrowhawk, yellow-billed kite and Madagascar harrier-hawk hunt Malagasy <b>paradise</b> <b>flycatchers.</b> [...] In addition, {{there is at}} least one record of a common brown lemur eating a nestling Malagasy <b>paradise</b> <b>flycatcher,</b> one of the few records of a wild lemur eating anything other than plant material.|$|R
5000|$|Like {{all members}} of its genus, the Malagasy <b>paradise</b> <b>flycatcher</b> is an insectivore, feeding {{on a variety of}} insects. [...] It {{regularly}} joins mixed-species flocks, particularly those containing common newtonias. It is a [...] "follower" [...] in such flocks, allowing other birds to work as [...] "beaters"; it follows them and hunts down any insect prey they flush. Studies have shown that the <b>paradise</b> <b>flycatcher's</b> foraging efficiency is directly correlated to the number of common newtonia in a flock; a greater number of common newtonias results in a higher foraging efficiency for any accompanying Malagasy <b>paradise</b> <b>flycatchers.</b> When rufous vangas, which generally forage within a meter (yard) or so of the ground, are present in the same mixed-species flocks as Malagasy <b>paradise</b> <b>flycatchers,</b> the latter preferentially follow the vangas, and therefore forage closer to the ground than they normally do.|$|R
5000|$|The red-bellied <b>paradise</b> <b>flycatcher</b> (Terpsiphone rufiventer), {{also known}} as the black-headed <b>paradise</b> <b>flycatcher,</b> is a {{medium-sized}} passerine bird of the family of monarch flycatchers. It is native to West Africa. The male bird is about 17 cm long and has a black head, a mainly chestnut body, and a tail with streamers nearly twice as long as the body. The colouring is somewhat variable across the bird's range. Both females and juveniles lack the tail streamers and are a duller brown colour. It is closely related to the African <b>paradise</b> <b>flycatcher,</b> and the two can hybridise.|$|R

50|$|The <b>paradise</b> <b>flycatchers</b> are, {{as their}} name suggests, insectivores, feeding {{on a variety}} of insects, usually {{obtained}} on the wing. They use a variety of foraging techniques, including hawking from a perch, sallying, hovering, gleaning, and flush-pursuiting. They will join mixed-species feeding flocks, for example the Madagascar <b>paradise</b> <b>flycatcher</b> will regularly form small two species flocks with the common newtonia while foraging.|$|R
