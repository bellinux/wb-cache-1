25|$|Once {{one or more}} {{units have}} been {{selected}}, the player can click {{on the ground to}} make them walk to the selected spot, or click on an enemy to make them attack. Units with projectile weapons, such as archers and dwarves can also be ordered to attack a specific spot on the ground, rather than an enemy. It is also important that the player have their units facing in the right direction. This is accomplished by pressing the left or the right <b>arrow</b> <b>key</b> or moving the mouse to rotate the direction of the units as they move to the selected location. Facing the correct direction is especially important when using formations, of which there are nine available. After selecting a group of units, the player must press the corresponding formation button on the keyboard, and then click on the ground where they want the units to form. The player can also order all selected units to scatter and to retreat. All formations, as well as commands such as stopping, guarding, scattering, retreating, and reversing direction, are also available via a single click in the Control Bar {{at the bottom of the}} screen.|$|E
500|$|The {{first game}} in the series, WWF SmackDown! had a clear cut system for moves such as {{combining}} an <b>arrow</b> <b>key</b> with the circle button for grappling and moves and combining an <b>arrow</b> <b>key</b> with the X button for striking moves. Most of the later games, from WWF SmackDown! 2: Know Your Role to WWE SmackDown vs. Raw 2006 used the aforementioned control scheme. When WWE SmackDown vs Raw 2007 was released, new game mechanics were introduced, in which a new control scheme altered the grappling system of the game, called [...] "Ultimate Control moves." [...] Unlike the previous games, where the player pressed two buttons to perform a grapple or an attack, players were able to place their opponents into a grapple position and then choose to perform a move by moving the directional buttons of their system's controller. For example, the player could place their opponent in a suplex grappling position and then either perform a normal suplex or an inverted suplex slam. Before the release of WWE SmackDown vs. Raw 2008, in order for players to force a superstar to submit, they had to tap buttons to move a marker {{towards the end of}} the meter labeled [...] "Submit", and the only way for opponents to escape was for them to move the meter towards [...] "Escape". Included with the release of WWE SmackDown vs. Raw 2008 was a new submission system, in which the player had to move the analog sticks of their system's controller in different directions to force the opponent to submit, while the opponent could do the same to escape the submission hold.|$|E

50|$|Before the {{computer}} mouse was widespread, <b>arrow</b> <b>keys</b> {{were the primary}} way of moving a cursor on screen. Mouse keys is a feature that allows controlling a mouse cursor with <b>arrow</b> <b>keys</b> instead. A feature echoed in the Amiga whereby holding the Amiga key would allow a person to move the pointer with the <b>arrow</b> <b>keys</b> in the Workbench (operating system), but most games require a mouse or joystick. The use of <b>arrow</b> <b>keys</b> in games has come back into fashion from the late 1980s and early 1990s when joysticks were a must, and were usually used in preference to <b>arrow</b> <b>keys</b> with some games not supporting any keys. It can be used instead of WASD keys, to play games using those keys.|$|R
50|$|IJKL {{is used by}} {{a growing}} number of browser games. These games cannot use the <b>arrow</b> <b>keys</b> because many browsers' windows will scroll if the <b>arrow</b> <b>keys</b> are used, thus {{hindering}} gameplay. This is a problem specific to DHTML/JavaScript games. IJKL, like WASD, are arranged in an ergonomic inverted T shape, and, since they are used by the right hand, adjustment is easy for people who commonly use the <b>arrow</b> <b>keys.</b>|$|R
2500|$|Gameplay is a {{simplified}} {{version of the}} playing-style used in Myst. [...] The game consists {{of a series of}} pre-rendered, interactive visuals of Pyst island locations. With Bergman's [...] "seal of disapproval", the familiar locations have been vandalised under the pretense that millions of virtual players have been trapped on the island having [...] "giv up on trying to finish the damn thing", and as a result have trashed the space, while a shady entrepreneur has built a [...] "Dorian Grey money making scheme". Unlike Myst however, there are no real puzzles to solve. The player simply explores a setting, and then moves to adjoining locations at will. The game does not feature a point-and-click cursor interface. Instead, the players are shown an image on a postcard with four arrow keys on the edge where players click an <b>arrow</b> <b>key</b> to change the image on the postcard.|$|E
2500|$|Once {{one or more}} {{units have}} been {{selected}}, the player can click {{on the ground to}} make them walk to the selected spot, or click on an enemy to make them attack. Units with projectile weapons, such as archers and dwarves can also be ordered to attack a specific spot on the ground, rather than an enemy. It is also important that the player have their units facing in the right direction. In The Fallen Lords, this is accomplished by [...] "gesture clicking" [...] - using the mouse to indicate which way the units will face when they reach their destination. In Soulblighter and The Wolf Age, it can be accomplished by either gesture clicking, or by pressing the left or right <b>arrow</b> <b>key</b> as the units move to the selected location. Facing the correct direction is especially important when using formations. After selecting a group of units, the player must press the corresponding formation button on the keyboard, and then click on the ground where they want the units to form. The player can also order all selected units to scatter and to retreat. In Soulblighter and The Wolf Age, all formations, as well as commands such as stopping, guarding, scattering, retreating, and reversing direction, are also available via a single click in the Control Bar {{at the bottom of the}} screen.|$|E

50|$|The {{original}} Apple Macintosh had no <b>arrow</b> <b>keys</b> at {{the insistence}} of Steve Jobs, who felt that people should use the mouse instead.

Early models with <b>arrow</b> <b>keys</b> but no middle section (Home, End, etc.) placed them in one line below the right-hand Shift key in an HJKL-like fashion; later versions had a standard inverted-T layout, either in the middle block or as half-height keys at the bottom right of the main keyboard.|$|R
