40|$|Oldřich Leška {{introduced}} for {{the description}} of Russian syntax the notion of syntactic polymorphism (i. e. great variety of sentence types), which he related to the weakening of inflexionality. This connection is dubious, because such non-inflexional languages as French or <b>English</b> <b>are</b> <b>syntactically</b> highly monomorphic while the syntax of highly inflexional old Indo-European languages is polymorphic in a way similar to the Russian. The weakening of inflexionality as well as monomorphization of syntax are analogical processes supported by language mixing...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—Software {{requirements}} are typically captured in natural languages (NL) such as <b>English</b> <b>and</b> then analyzed by software engineers {{to generate a}} formal software design/model (such as UML model). However, <b>English</b> <b>is</b> <b>syntactically</b> ambiguous <b>and</b> semantically inconsistent. Hence, the English specifications of software requirements can not only result in erroneous and absurd software designs and implementations but the informal nature of <b>English</b> <b>is</b> also a main obstacle in machine processing of English specification of the software requirements. To address this key challenge, there is need to introduce a controlled NL representation for software requirements to generate accurate and consistent software models. In this paper, we report an automated approach to generate Semantic of Business Vocabulary and Rules (SBVR) standard based controlled representation of English software requirement specification. The SBVR based controlled representation can not only result in accurate and consistent software models but also machine process able because SBVR has pure mathematical foundation. We also introduce a java based implementation of the presented approach that is a proof of concept...|$|R

I argue that this dogma should be rejected. It is possible for a metaphysical realist to be a "semantic dualist", holding that some middle- sized object statements receive a realist interpretation, but that most such statements require an antirealist interpretation. To show that a semantically dual language is at least possible, I describe a possible world whose inhabitants speak a version of <b>English</b> that <b>is</b> <b>syntactically</b> dual.
