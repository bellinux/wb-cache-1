25|$|Luxembourg's Ministry of {{transport}} stated that three {{investigations into the}} incident had been launched. It did not state whether the van had permission {{to be on the}} active runway or not. The investigations are being carried out by Luxembourg's Administration Des Enquêtes Techniques, Directorate of Civil Aviation and Administration of Air Navigation (AET). A preliminary report revealed that the van had been given permission to be on the active runway. The clearance had been issued before Flight 7933 started its <b>approach.</b> <b>Flight</b> 7933 also had permission to land on the runway that the van was on. Representatives from the NTSB and the Association Luxembourgeoise des Pilotes de Ligne assisted the AET in their investigation. The event was initially classed by the AET as an accident but was downgraded to a serious incident as the damage to the aircraft involved was not structural.|$|E
25|$|Flight 213 was on {{approach}} to Benazir Bhutto International Airport piloted by Captain Noor Afridin and First Officer Javid Malik. Airport AFIS told {{the crew of}} Flight 213 that the weather in the area was thundery with heavy precipitation. The crews acknowledged the report and continued the <b>approach.</b> <b>Flight</b> 213 had only experienced some turbulence while approaching therefore it continued the approach. The Flight crew was still at normal mood condition, as Captain Noor's jokes and laugh were heard in the CVR. But a few minutes later, the flight finally encountered bad weather conditions. The flight crew entered bad weather, but still continued the approach, even though Bhoja Air's operational manual told crews to discontinue approach if bad weather was encountered. They continued the approach until finally they realized that they had entered an active cell. At this time, Captain Noor {{was worried about the}} condition, but continued the approach. Autopilot was later disengaged by flight crews. Islamabad Tower then told Flight 213 to land on Runway 30. The landing checklist was completed and done. Flight crews followed the landing procedure on ILS approach. The autopilot later engaged again.|$|E
2500|$|A {{trial of}} [...] "noise relief zones" [...] ran from December 2012 to March 2013, which {{concentrated}} <b>approach</b> <b>flight</b> paths into defined areas {{compared with the}} existing paths which were spread out.

2500|$|Both the CVR and FDR were {{recovered}} {{and used for}} the investigation. Due to the limited parameters recorded by the FDR, investigators did {{not have access to}} the position of the flight-control surfaces (rudder, ailerons, elevator, etc.) for the accident. However, two parameters recorded by the FDR were crucial, one being the aircraft's heading, the other being the pitch control yoke position. During the <b>approach,</b> <b>Flight</b> 427 encountered wake turbulence from Delta 1083; the FAA, however, determined [...] "the wake vortex encounter alone would not have caused the continued heading change that occurred after 1903:00." [...] The abrupt heading change shortly before the dive pointed investigators immediately to the rudder. Due to the absence of rudder pedal positions from the data, investigators had to determine whether the rudder moved hard-over by a malfunction or by pilot command. This in turn led to the CVR being more heavily scrutinized than most other recordings as statements and breathing from the pilots could potentially tell investigators if they were fighting for control over a rudder malfunction or inadvertently stomped on the wrong rudder pedal in excitement from the wake-turbulence. Boeing felt the latter more likely, while USAir and the Pilot's Union felt the former was more likely.|$|E

50|$|The {{communication}} between the flight crew and ATC was performed in English, which {{was used as a}} universal medium for communication because the national languages of the ATC controllers and the flight crew were Hellenic and Russian respectively.

50|$|To avoid {{detection}} by {{radar and}} Japanese personnel {{stationed in the}} Solomon Islands along a straight-line distance of about 400 mi between U.S. forces and Bougainville, the mission entailed an over-water flight south and west of the Solomons. This roundabout <b>approach</b> <b>flight</b> was plotted and measured to be about 600 mi. The fighters would therefore travel 600 miles out to the target and 400 miles back. The 1,000-mile flight, with extra fuel allotted for combat, was beyond {{the range of the}} F4F Wildcat and F4U Corsair fighters then available to Navy and Marine squadrons based on Guadalcanal. The mission was instead assigned to the 339th Fighter Squadron, 347th Fighter Group, whose P-38G aircraft, equipped with drop tanks, had the range to intercept and engage.|$|E

5000|$|On 25 February 1985, USAF RC-135T, 55-3121, {{operating}} out of Eielson AFB, AK was flying practice approaches in very poor weather at the Valdez Municipal Airport, AK (VDZ). This one-time [...] "Speed Light" [...] aircraft had been re-engined with P&W TF-33 engines but was at this time only used for proficiency training in landings and air refueling, not for operational reconnaissance missions, but was sometimes called [...] "Rivet Dandy". The first two approaches were uneventful, but the crew apparently became disoriented and the third Microwave Landing System (MLS) approach was commenced some four miles (6.4 km) north of the prescribed MLS inbound course. The crew of three (two pilots and a navigator) were killed when the aircraft flew {{into the side of}} a mountain. The approach procedure being attempted was certified for a de Havilland Canada DHC-7, STOL airplane. Both the glide slope and missed <b>approach</b> <b>flight</b> path were too steep for an RC-135 aircraft. The wreckage was not located until 2 August 1985.|$|E
