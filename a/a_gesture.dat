5|$|Burrows was {{the closest}} friend on the Canucks to former {{teammate}} Luc Bourdon, {{who died in a}} motorcycle accident in May 2008. In the hockey season following his death, Burrows occasionally celebrated goals with a bow-and-arrow mime, <b>a</b> <b>gesture</b> that Bourdon himself did after scoring during his junior career. He and his wife (girlfriend at the time) remained close to Bourdon's girlfriend, Charlene Ward.|$|E
5000|$|But if <b>an</b> articulatory <b>gesture</b> {{is to be}} {{considered}} <b>a</b> true <b>gesture</b> in the above sense, it must be meaningful. Therefore, <b>an</b> articulatory <b>gesture</b> {{must be at least}} as large as the smallest meaningful unit of language, the morpheme. A morpheme corresponds roughly to a spoken word or <b>a</b> sign language <b>gesture.</b>|$|R

5|$|Despite his fierce nature, Auerbach {{was popular}} among his players. He {{recalled}} that on his 75th birthday party, 45 {{of his former}} players showed up; and when he turned 80, his perennial 1960s victim Wilt Chamberlain showed up, <b>a</b> <b>gesture</b> which Auerbach dearly appreciated.|$|E
5|$|During this period, Poland was {{undergoing}} yet more upheaval: in 1978, John Paul II was elected Pope, providing a national figurehead of world importance; in 1980, the influential movement Solidarność was created, led by Lech Wałęsa; and in 1981, martial law was declared by General Wojciech Jaruzelski. From 1981–89, Lutosławski refused all professional engagements in Poland as <b>a</b> <b>gesture</b> of {{solidarity with the}} artists' boycott. He refused to enter the Culture Ministry to meet any of the ministers, and was careful not be photographed in their company. In 1983, as <b>a</b> <b>gesture</b> of support, he sent a recording of the first performance (in Chicago) of the Third Symphony to Gdańsk to be played to strikers in a local church. In 1983, {{he was awarded the}} Solidarity prize, of which Lutosławski was reported to be more proud than any other of his honours.|$|E
5|$|In 1880, Carrier-Belleuse– now art {{director}} of the Sèvres national porcelain factory– offered Rodin a part-time position as a designer. The offer was in part <b>a</b> <b>gesture</b> of reconciliation, and Rodin accepted. That part of Rodin which appreciated 18th-century tastes was aroused, and he immersed himself in designs for vases and table ornaments that brought the factory renown across Europe.|$|E
5000|$|Dieudonné {{started a}} trend among his {{supporters}} of getting photographed making <b>a</b> unique <b>gesture</b> he invented and dubbed the [...] "quenelle". For some {{it is just}} <b>a</b> vulgar <b>gesture</b> of opposition to French institutions, for others it is <b>an</b> antisemitic <b>gesture</b> and was dubbed a [...] "reverse Nazi salute" [...] because while a Nazi salute involves an upraised straight arm, the quenelle involves a straight arm pointed at the ground.|$|R
40|$|Wearable {{computing}} and Augmented Reality applications {{call for}} less obtrusive and more intuitive human computer interfaces than keyboards and mice. One way to realise such interfaces is using gestures, e. g., for pointing {{in order to}} replace the mouse. The less obtrusive way of gesture recognition is to use computer vision based methods. This paper presents <b>a</b> computer vision-based <b>gesture</b> interface {{that is part of}} an Augmented Reality system. It can recognise a 3 D pointing <b>gesture,</b> <b>a</b> click <b>gesture,</b> and five static <b>gestures.</b> <b>A</b> lookup-table based colour segmentation and <b>a</b> fast <b>gesture</b> recognition method are presented that enable for 25 Hz performance on a standard PC...|$|R
5000|$|In the 23rd {{frame of}} his semi-final against Trump, O'Sullivan {{received}} a reprimand from referee Michaela Tabb for allegedly making <b>an</b> obscene <b>gesture</b> with his cue.

5|$|The {{use of a}} truce term {{is usually}} {{accompanied}} by <b>a</b> <b>gesture,</b> such as crossed fingers of one or both hands or the raising of thumbs.

5|$|Although he {{immediately}} assumed {{use of his}} stepfather's surname, {{it was not until}} Clinton turned fifteen that he formally adopted the surname Clinton as <b>a</b> <b>gesture</b> toward his stepfather. Clinton said that he remembered his stepfather as a gambler and an alcoholic who regularly abused his mother and half-brother, Roger Clinton Jr., {{to the point where he}} intervened multiple times with the threat of violence to protect them.|$|E
5|$|An infant's new tooth {{is celebrated}} with bowls of {{sweetened}} wheat or barley and sweets served after a child's circumcision include baklava and Burma. Christian families in mourning serve a sweet bun known as rahmeh. It is a food eaten in remembrance {{of the dead}} and as <b>a</b> <b>gesture</b> of blessing the soul of the deceased person. The Greek Orthodox Church offer a special tray with cooked wheat covered with sugar and candy after a memorial service.|$|E
40|$|An interviewer???s {{gestures}} can convey {{misleading information}} and subsequently cause inaccuracies in {{the reporting of}} an event by both adults and children. We investigated the robustness of the gestural misinformation effect, examining {{the extent to which}} <b>an</b> interviewer???s <b>gestures</b> mislead children under conditions that would normally buffer them against verbal suggestibility (strength of memory trace, age, and verbal ability). Children (a younger sample aged 2 ??? 4 years, n = 30; and an older sample aged 7 ??? 9 years, n = 26) were exposed to a videotaped event and questioned immediately, having been allocated randomly to either <b>an</b> accurate <b>gesture</b> condition (gestures consistent with observed events, e. g., ???What was the lady wearing???? plus <b>a</b> ???hat??? <b>gesture)</b> or <b>a</b> misleading <b>gesture</b> condition (???What was the lady wearing???? plus <b>a</b> ???gloves??? <b>gesture).</b> Children were susceptible to the gestural misinformation effect even when questioned immediately after witnessing the event, regardless of age and verbal ability. These findings reveal new insights into the robustness of the gestural misinformation effect in children???s eyewitness interviews...|$|R
5000|$|In Baroque music, {{melodies and}} their lyrics were prose. Rather than paired lines they consist of rhetorical {{sentences}} or paragraphs consisting of <b>an</b> opening <b>gesture,</b> <b>an</b> amplification (often featuring sequence), {{and a close}} (featuring a cadence); in German Vordersatz-Fortspinnung-Epilog. For example: When I was <b>a</b> child, <b>gesture</b> I spake as a child, amplification... I understood as a child, ... I thought as a child; ... But when I became a man, I put away childish things. close -1 Corinthians 13 ...|$|R

5|$|Courtship {{begins when}} a male follows a female until he meets her face-to-face. He then strokes {{her face and}} neck with his {{elongated}} front claws, <b>a</b> <b>gesture</b> returned by a receptive female. The pair repeat the process several times, with the male retreating from and then returning to the female until she swims to the bottom, where they copulate. As the male is smaller than the female, he is not dominant. The female stores sperm, {{to be used for}} up to three clutches, in her oviducts; the sperm may remain viable for up to threeyears. A single clutch may have multiple fathers.|$|E
5|$|Discovering {{that many}} of his satraps and {{military}} governors had misbehaved in his absence, Alexander executed several of them as examples on his way to Susa. As <b>a</b> <b>gesture</b> of thanks, he paid off the debts of his soldiers, and announced that he would send over-aged and disabled veterans back to Macedon, led by Craterus. His troops misunderstood his intention and mutinied at the town of Opis. They refused to be sent away and criticized his adoption of Persian customs and dress and the introduction of Persian officers and soldiers into Macedonian units.|$|E
5|$|Edward's body lay at Wareham for a {{year before}} being disinterred. Ælfhere {{initiated}} the reinterment, perhaps as <b>a</b> <b>gesture</b> of reconciliation. According {{to the life of}} Oswald, Edward's body was found to be incorrupt when it was disinterred (which was taken as a miraculous sign). The body was taken to the Shaftesbury Abbey, a nunnery with royal connections which had been endowed by King Alfred the Great and where Edward and Æthelred's grandmother Ælfgifu had spent her latter years.|$|E

5|$|Following this success, Jackson {{began to}} direct several {{personal}} insults at Silva, <b>a</b> <b>gesture</b> that infuriated the champion. Silva {{was in the}} midst of what would be a 17-fight unbeaten streak. He captured the championship from Sakuraba at Pride 17, and defeated him a total of three times. Jackson continued his negative comments towards the champion, and directed his latest insult at Silva's training camp at the time, the Chute Boxe Academy.|$|E
5|$|However, {{shortly after}} {{returning}} to the French Riviera in 1929, Hunter suffered a severe breakdown, forcing his sister to bring him home to Scotland in September. He recovered, and began to paint a number of portraits of his friends, including one of Dr Tom Honeyman, the Director of the Glasgow Art Gallery and Museum from 1939 until 1954. Honeyman, at the time an art dealer, had assisted Hunter in developing his career, and painting the portrait may have been <b>a</b> <b>gesture</b> of thanks.|$|E
5|$|In {{the smaller}} painting, Mary averts {{her eyes and}} folds her hands in <b>a</b> <b>gesture</b> that symbolised {{submission}} to God's will. Mary is not submissive, however, in the larger piece. The girl, interrupted in her reading by this unexpected messenger, puts a finger in her bible to mark the place and raises her hand in a formal gesture of greeting or surprise. This calm young woman appears to accept her role as the Mother of God, not with resignation but with confidence. In this painting, the young Leonardo presents the humanist face of the Virgin Mary, recognising humanity's role in God's incarnation.|$|E

5|$|Queen Mary 2 is the {{flagship}} of Cunard Line. The ship was constructed for eventual {{replacement of the}} aging Queen Elizabeth 2, the Cunard flagship from 1969 to 2004 and the last major ocean liner built before the construction of Queen Mary 2. Queen Mary 2 had the Royal Mail Ship (RMS) title conferred on her, as <b>a</b> <b>gesture</b> to Cunard's history, by Royal Mail when she entered service in 2004 on the Southampton to New York route.|$|E
5|$|Since {{exiting the}} Premier League, Eddie Davies, the then {{owner of the}} club revoked his {{investment}} into the club. This led to published debts of almost £200m and bought the club very close to being wound up over unpaid tax bills owed to HMRC. As <b>a</b> <b>gesture</b> of his goodwill and as incentive to sell the club, Davies promised to wipe over £125m of debt owed to him when the club was sold, which wiped {{a significant proportion of}} debt the club owed.|$|E
5|$|Since {{the spring}} of 2013, secret {{meetings}} were conducted between the United States and Cuba in the neutral locations of Canada and Vatican City.

On December 10, 2013, Cuban President Raúl Castro, in a significant public moment, greeted and shook hands with Obama at the Nelson Mandela memorial service in Johannesburg.|$|E
