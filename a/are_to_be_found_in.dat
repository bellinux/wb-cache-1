5|$|In Africa, where batik was {{originally}} imported by Dutch merchants from Indonesia (then the Netherlands East Indies), paste made from starch or mud {{is used as}} a resist instead of wax. The most developed resist-dyeing skills <b>are</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>found</b> <b>in</b> Nigeria where the Yoruba make adire cloths. Two methods of resist are used: adire eleso which involves tied and stitched designs and adire eleko that uses starch paste. The paste is most often made from cassava starch, rice, and other ingredients boiled together to produce a smooth thick paste. The Yoruba of West Africa use cassava paste as a resist while the Soninke and Wolof people in Senegal uses rice paste. The Bamana people of Mali use mud as a resist.|$|E
5|$|Objects from Titanic {{have been}} {{exhibited}} for many years, though {{only a few}} were retrieved before {{the discovery of the}} wreck in 1985. The Maritime Museum of the Atlantic in Halifax, Nova Scotia has a collection of wooden fragments and an intact deckchair plucked from the sea by the Canadian search vessels that recovered the victims' bodies.

5|$|The {{variety of}} fruits and {{vegetables}} that Bengal has to offer is incredible. A host of gourds, roots and tubers, leafy greens, succulent stalks, lemons and limes, green and purple eggplants, red onions, plantain, broad beans, okra, banana tree stems and flowers, green jackfruit, and red pumpkins <b>are</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>found</b> <b>in</b> the markets popularly known as anaj bazaar. Panta bhat (rice soaked overnight in water) with onion and green chili is a traditional dish consumed in rural areas. Common spices found in a Bengali kitchen are cumin, ajmoda (radhuni), bay leaf, mustard, ginger, green chillies, and turmeric. People of erstwhile East Bengal use a lot of ajmoda, coriander leaves, tamarind, coconut, and mustard in their cooking while those aboriginally from West Bengal use a lot of sugar, garam masala, and red chilli powder. Vegetarian dishes are mostly prepared without onion and garlic.|$|E
5|$|Vikos-Aoös also {{contains}} a variety of suitable habitats that support dense populations of amphibians and reptiles. Vipera ursinii lives in the subalpine meadows and is considered a threatened taxon. The amphibian alpine newts (Triturus alpestris), living in the alpine lakes of the Tymfi region, mostly in Drakolimni, are associated with local folktales of dragons and dragon battles. Yellow-bellied toads (Bombina variegata) are also common in that same area. Numerous fish, such as brown trout, roach, and barbel <b>are</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>found</b> <b>in</b> the park's rivers. Regarding invertebrate species, due to the structural complexity of the forests and the co-existence of various small biotopes, i.e. streams, ponds, forest openings, rocky sites, dead trees, old pollards, and coppices, a very diverse fauna exists. This occurs especially at the various ecotones, including often very specialized species.|$|E

5|$|Westminster, {{which gives}} the borough its name, lies to the {{south-west}} of Charing Cross; it is the location of Westminster Abbey and the Palace of Westminster, which together with St Margaret's parish church comprise a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The area's main sculptural showcase is Parliament Square, conceived in the 1860s to improve {{the setting of the}} rebuilt Houses of Parliament, to ease traffic flow and as a site for commemorating politicians of note. Carlo Marochetti's statues of the engineers Robert Stephenson and Isambard Kingdom Brunel were initially considered for the square, but were rejected as not fitting in with the political theme. They were ultimately erected outside Euston station and on the Victoria Embankment. The square took on its present configuration in a refurbishment of 1949–1950 by the architect George Grey Wornum, though three statues of twentieth-century figures which have since been added. Another two political memorials (one of which, the Buxton Memorial Fountain, was moved by Wornum from Parliament Square) and The Burghers of Calais, a work on an historical theme by Auguste Rodin, <b>are</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>found</b> <b>in</b> Victoria Tower Gardens.|$|E
