40|$|This paper {{analyses}} the damping {{in pressure}} compensated closed centre mobile working hydraulic systems. Both rotational and linear loads are covered and the analysis applies to {{any type of}} pump controller. Only the <b>outlet</b> <b>orifice</b> in the directional valve will provide damping to a pressure compensated system. Design rules are proposed for how the system should be dimensioned {{in order to obtain}} a high damping. The volumes {{on each side of the}} load have a high impact on the damping. In case of a small volume on the inlet side, the damping becomes low. However, the most important thing is to design the <b>outlet</b> <b>orifice</b> area properly. There exists an optimal orifice dimension for maximized damping; both smaller and larger orifice areas give lower damping independently of the volumes. This paper presents a method to dimension the <b>outlet</b> <b>orifice</b> area and the load volumes in order to obtain a desired system damping. Experimental results, which confirm the theoretical expectations, are also presented. The conclusions are that it is possible to obtain a high damping contribution from the <b>outlet</b> <b>orifice</b> if the system is dimensioned correctly. However, the energy efficiency needs to be considered while improving the dampin...|$|R

40|$|AbstractHigh Thrust Cryogenic Rocket Stages entail {{the use of}} a Vent and Relief Valve {{which can}} cater to a higher {{discharge}} rate. The Vent function is called for during ground servicing operations like tank chilling and pressurant replenishment and during flight {{to take care of the}} decrease in ambient pressure and boil-off losses. The Relief function acts as a redundant feature to protect the tanks from catastrophic failure due to structural damage caused by over-pressurization. Nevertheless, this valve needs to be characterized for both these functions during ground tests. This paper describes the modelling of and experimentation on an Inverted Type Pilot Operated Vent and Safety Valve. A mathematical model for simulating the dynamic behavior of this tank-mounted valve is developed. For this, a set of non-linear, first order, coupled ordinary differential equations, based on laws of conservation of mass and energy, are derived using fixed control volume approach. The numerical solution of these equations is obtained using fourth order Runge-Kutta method. The pressure, temperature, flow rate, seat stress and lift thus obtained are plotted to find the characteristic parameters such as cracking pressure, full flow pressure, reseal pressure, opening and closing response, tank pressure decay rate and full flow rate. The valve performance is studied for the effect of main valve <b>outlet</b> <b>orifice</b> and the pilot valve <b>outlet</b> <b>orifice</b> using these simulations.

40|$|In {{particular}} the thermal comfort of passengers {{is the essential}} design objective in the cabin air ventilation layout for modern civil passenger aircraft. Solar radiation, electrical equipment, on-board electronics, high power converters, in-flight entertainment and communication devices and most important the heat release of the passengers are representing thermal loads. This heat loads have to be balanced by cold air coming from the air vents of cabin <b>air</b> <b>outlets</b> of the <b>air</b> ventilation system. In fact, the temperature distribution inside the passenger cabin can only be controlled by the air conditioning system. Besides providing the passengers with the fresh, an essential task is to avoid discomfort for the passengers by ensuring a good mixing of fresh with aged air and by guaranteeing a high air flow exchange rate for each individual passenger {{according to the requirements}} defined in. Cabin <b>air</b> <b>outlets</b> are a crucial device for the air flow distribution within the cabin. Although a high air exchange rate is necessary for thermal comfort the incoming fresh air must not exceed a certain flow velocity in order to avoid gust. Therefore, the air should be evenly distributed by an outlet device, i. e. a plenum, an orifice plate or flow straighteners, before it can leave the outlets through the vents forming a homogeneous planar air jet. This optimal precondition facilitates a successive control of the air distribution within the aircraft cabin. In particular, in the early design phase of aircraft cabin layouts numerical flow simulations are undertaken presuming that this precondition is fulfilled. In fact this is not always the case; hence, design work has to be done to improve cabin <b>air</b> <b>outlets.</b> Unfortunately, the space envelope for cabin <b>air</b> <b>outlets</b> is quite limited by stringers, insulation, ducting, wires, cables or lining elements. Not only the outer space envelope is a major constraint when designing <b>air</b> <b>outlets,</b> moreover, internal drag and weight {{have a negative impact on}} the power consumption of the Environmental Control System (ECS) and, therefore, on the fuel consumption of the aircraft. Both have to be minimized in order to save power and costs.

The first method is that the running frequency in heating mode is adjusted {{in terms of the}} ordinary control method of VRF, i. e., constant condensation temperature. The experiment demonstrates the control method is not feasible. For nominal heating under different static pressure and defrosting under 200 Pa static pressure, the system fluctuates frequently.

Furthermore, the control model of variable condensation temperature target has been presented, and the heat transfer correction factor is introduced into the control model. And the control parameters in the model are determined by experiment. The control model is universal for FAPs with different capacities by identifying and choosing the heat transfer correction factor in the control program. For low temperature heating, the method of switching rotation speed of the motor can be adopted to enhance <b>air</b> <b>outlet</b> temperature to 22 degrees C.
