40|$|Alkyl ketene dimers (AKD) are {{effective}} and highly hydrophobic sizing agents for the internal sizing of alkaline papers, {{but in some}} cases they may form deposits on paper machines and copiers. In addition, <b>alkenyl</b> <b>succinic</b> <b>anhydrides</b> (ASA) - based sizing agents are highly reactive, producing on-machine sizing, but under uncontrolled wet end conditions the hydrolysis of ASA may cause problems. This thesis aims at developing an improved ketene dimer based sizing agent that would have a lower deposit formation tendency on paper machines and copiers than a traditional type of AKD. The aim is also to improve the ink jet printability of a AKD sized paper. The sizing characteristics ofketene dimers have been compared to those of ASA. A lower tendency of ketene dimer deposit formation was shown in paper machine trials and in printability tests when branched fatty acids were used in the manufacture of a ketene dimer basedsizing agent. Fitting the melting and solidification temperature of a ketene dimer size to the process temperature of a paper machine or a copier contributes to machine cleanliness. A lower hydrophobicity of the paper sized with branched ketene dimer compared to the paper sized with traditional AKD was discovered. However, the ink jet print quality could be improved by the use of a branched ketene dimer. The branched ketene dimer helps in balancing the paper hydrophobicity for both black and color printing. The use of a high amount of protective colloidin the emulsification was considered to be useful for the sizing performance ofthe liquid type of sizing agents.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to assess the decay {{resistance}} of wood modified with a variety of chemicals and to attempt to further understand the mechanism by which chemical modification protects wood from decay. Corsican pine (Pinus nigra) sapwood was modified with three cyclic anhydrides; succinic anhydride, <b>alkenyl</b> <b>succinic</b> <b>anhydride</b> (a derivative of succinic anhydride with a 16 - 18 carbon alkenyl chain) and phthalic anhydride, and with two more widely studied modifying chemicals; acetic anhydride and butyl isocyanate. All reactions were carried out using pyridine as solvent and catalyst. Modified wood was tested against decay fungi in a pure culture test against basidiomycete fungi (Coniophora puteana, Gloeophyllum trabeum, Trametes versicolor and Pycnoporus sanguineus) under different moisture content regimes, an unsterile soil soft rot test, a fungal cellar test and a field trial. Butyl isocyanate proved the most effective modifying chemical at protecting wood from decay, followed by acetic anhydride and then <b>alkenyl</b> <b>succinic</b> <b>anhydride.</b> Uneven distribution of the modifying chemical in wood was evident using each of these three chemicals, particularly in the case of acetic anhydride. Despite its apparent ability to control decay by basidiomycete fungi, <b>alkenyl</b> <b>succinic</b> <b>anhydride</b> was unable to completely protect wood from soft rot fungi. Phthalic and succinic anhydride modifications both proved susceptible to hydrolysis and leaching, and neither were effective as wood protection chemicals. Phthalic anhydride modified wood performed well in the pure culture test, apparently through biocidal action, but was susceptible to decay in unsterile conditions. The approach made in this study to understanding the mechanism of protection was to analyse physical properties of the modified wood cell wall. This involved the measurement of adsorption isotherms, volumetric swell due to water soak, and cell wall pore size (using the solute exclusion technique). Neither the moisture content of modified wood nor its cell wall moisture content (measured as the fibre saturation point from the adsorption analysis) provided a good explanation of decay resistance. In several cases, the relationship between volumetric swell (due to water soak) and weight loss (to a given fungus in pure culture) was found to be consistent between modification types. From this it is concluded that the extent by which water swells modified wood is important to decay resistance. A reduction in cell wall pore volume was measured using the solute exclusion technique, though no further conclusions could be drawn from this test. It is proposed that the mechanism of resistance to decay by basidiomycete fungi involves the blocking of cell wall pores, which restricts the access of degradative agents released by decay fungi. The amount by which wood swells is important in this theory since this will determine by how much transient pores in modified wood can open, and whether enough space is created to bypass this blocking effect. The possibility of the role of site substitution in decay resistance is not discounted, and may contribute to decay resistance, particularly against white rot fungi. Pore blocking is not thought to be the mechanism of protection against soft rot fungi. In this case the substitution and shielding of decay susceptible sites are thought to be more important...|$|E

A polyurethane based coating, doped with bola-amphiphiles of varying molecular weight but with a common head group motif that stems from ring-opened <b>alkenyl</b> <b>succinic</b> <b>anhydride,</b> enables passivation of the defect and mitigates cathodic delamination, if applied on cold rolled steel.

The ASA addition sequence has an influence on the ASA sizing performance and first adding ASA to the HYP followed by mixing with kraft pulps was the preferred method. Using precipitated calcium carbonate (PCC) as a paper filler at a dosage of less than 20 % can increase the ASA sizing performance due to the contribution of the calcium soap of the hydrolysed ASA.

40|$|In {{addition}} to its use in recycled paper products, recovered lignocellulosic fiber {{can be used as}} a reinforcement filler in composites with polyolefins. However, problems in both processing and product performance are often caused by the incompatibilities of surface energies between hydrophilic cellulose and non-polar polyolefin. This poor match in surface polarities is detrimental to strong adhesive bonding between olefin and cellulose. This work examines the effect of surface energy on the adhesion properties of polypropylene and cellulose. In particular, three materials accepted as paper-sizing agents were used to change the cellulosic fiber's surface energy to make it more compatible with the surface energy of polypropylene. Cellulose fibers were treated by various methods with (1) alkyl ketene dimer, (2) <b>alkenyl</b> <b>succinic</b> <b>anhydride,</b> and (3) stearic acid and were characterized by their surface energies as determined by single fiber wettability measurements using the Wilhelmy technique. These measurements are discussed in detail. Results from these measurments can be related to differences in adhesion between treated cellulose and polypropylene, which can be measured by internal bond tests on hot-pressed composite sheets. Results indicate that the use of sizing agents reduces the acid/base (hydrogen bonding) character of the cellulose surface. Interactions involving hydrogen bonding are important in cellulose/modified-polypropylene composites. Reduction of these interactions appears to lead to a corresponding reduction in adhesion between cellulose and polypropylene...|$|E

The aim {{of this research was}} to develop an economically feasible and biodegradable slow-release coating for urea. For this purpose, lignin was selected as coating material. From four commercially available lignins, two lignosulfonates (Wafex P and Borresperce), a softwood kraft (Indulin AT) and soda flax lignin (Bioplast), the latter showed the best potential with respect to film forming properties. Bioplast dispersions up to a dry matter content of 50 % are processable. However, high losses during processing resulted in thin coating layers on the urea granules. To reduce urea release, hydrophobic compounds and crosslinkers were added to the Bioplast dispersions. Addition of <b>alkenyl</b> <b>succinic</b> <b>anhydride</b> (ASA) significantly decreased the release of urea in water. However, complete release of urea still occurred within one hour, which can be explained by a low reactivity of the selected compounds towards lignin, too low percentages of applied coating or negative effects of the selected compounds on the film forming process. In addition, urea partly dissolves in the aqueous lignin dispersions due to its high water-solubility. This causes incorporation of urea in the lignin layer, which results in coatings with a low water resistance. This was improved by application of an inner coating layer with high dry matter content. In conclusion, lignin shows high potential as coating material. For industrial application, more insight in the film forming properties is desired...|$|E

40|$|Sizing (hydrophobization) {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} process steps within the added-value chain of about 1 / 3 rd of the worldwide produced paper & board products. Even though sizing with so-called reactive sizing agents, such as <b>alkenyl</b> <b>succinic</b> <b>anhydride</b> (ASA) was implemented in the paper industry decades ago, there is no total clarity yet about the detailed chemical and physical mechanisms that lead to their performance. Previous research was carried out on the role of different factors influencing the sizing performance, such as bonding between ASA and cellulose, ASA hydrolysis, size revision as well as the most important interactions with stock components, process parameters and additives during the paper making process. However, it was not yet possible to develop a holistic model for the explanation of the sizing performance given in real life application. This thesis describes a novel physico-chemical approach to this problem by including results from previous research and combining these with a wide field of own basic research and a newly developed method that allows tracing back the actual localization of ASA within the sheet structure. The carried out measurements and trial sets for the basic field of research served to evaluate the stock and process parameters that most dominantly influence the sizing performance of ASA. Interactions with additives other than retention aids were not taken into account. The results show that parameters, such as the content of secondary fibers, the degree of refining, the water hardness as well as the suspension conductivity, are of highest significance. The sample sets of the trials with the major impacting parameters were additionally analyzed by a newly developed localization method in order to better understand the main influencing factors. This method is based on optical localization of ASA within the sheet structure by confocal white light microscopy. In order to fulfill the requirements at magnification rates of factor 100 optical zoom, it was necessary to improve the contrast between ASA and cellulose. Therefore, ASA was pretreated with an inert red diazo dye, which does not have any impact on neither the sizing nor the handling properties of ASA. Laboratory hand sheets that were sized with dyed ASA, were analyzed by means of their sizing performance in correlation to measurable ASA agglomerations in the sheet structure. The sizing performance was measured by ultrasonic penetration analysis. The agglomeration behavior of ASA was analyzed automatically by multiple random imaging of a sample area of approx. 8650 µm² with a minimum resolution for particles of 500 nm in size. The gained results were interpreted by full factorial design of experiments (DOE). The trials were carried out with ASA dosages between 0 % and 0. 8 % on laboratory hand sheets, made of 80 % bleached eucalyptus short fiber kraft pulp and 20 % northern bleached softwood kraft pulp, beaten to SR° 30, produced with a RDA sheet former at a base weight of 100 g/m² oven dry. The results show that there is a defined correlation between the ASA dosage, the sizing performance and the number and area of ASA agglomerates to be found in the sheet structure. It was also possible to show that the agglomeration behavior is highly influenced by external factors like furnish composition and process parameters. This enables a new approach to the explanation of sizing performance, by making it possible to not only examine the performance of the sizing agent, but to closely look at the predominant position where it is located in the sheet structure. These results lead to the explanation that the phenomenon of sizing is by far not a pure chemical process but rather a more physical one. Based on the gained findings it was possible so far to optimize the ASA sizing process in industrial-scale by means of ~ 50 % less ASA consumption at a steady degree of sizing and improved physical sheet properties...|$|E
