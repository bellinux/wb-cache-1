5|$|Commentators {{have offered}} many {{theories}} for {{the origins of}} vampire beliefs, trying to explain the superstition – and sometimes mass hysteria – caused by vampires.

5|$|It is not {{possible}} to confirm whether some injuries took place before or <b>after</b> <b>death,</b> due to the body's state of decay. This is the case for the wound in the upper right chest and the laceration {{on the back of the}} skull. The cut on the right of the neck may have been the result of the body becoming bloated, causing the skin to split; however, the straight edges to the wound suggest that it may have been caused by a sharp instrument, such as a knife. The ligature marks on the neck may have occurred <b>after</b> <b>death.</b> In some interpretations of Lindow Man's death, the sinew is a garrotte used to break the man's neck. However, Robert Connolly, a lecturer in physical anthropology, suggests that the sinew may have been ornamental and that ligature marks may have been caused by the body swelling when submerged. The rib fracture may also have occurred <b>after</b> <b>death,</b> perhaps during the discovery of the body, but is included in some narratives of Lindow Man's death. The broken neck would have proven the fatal injury, whether caused by the sinew cord tightening around the neck or by blows to the back of the head. <b>After</b> <b>death,</b> Lindow Man was deposited into Lindow Moss face down.|$|E

5|$|As {{a form of}} express trust, {{charitable}} trusts {{are subject}} to certain formalities, {{as well as the}} requirements of the three certainties, when being created. These vary depending on whether the gift that creates the trust is given in life, given <b>after</b> <b>death,</b> or includes land. If the gift is given <b>after</b> <b>death</b> through a will, the will must comply with Section 9 of the Wills Act 1837, which requires that the will be in writing and signed by the testator (or somebody else present, at the testator's instruction), {{it is clear that the}} testator intended to give effect to the will, and the signature is made or noted by two or more witnesses. If these are all carried out, the will is a valid document, and the gift made as part of it can create a charitable trust. If the gift is of land and made during the donor's lifetime, it must comply with Section 53(1)(b) of the Law of Property Act 1925, which requires that the agreement be a written document signed by the person giving it. If the gift is of personal property and made inter vivos, there are no formal requirements; it is enough that an oral declaration is made creating the trust. Once constituted properly, a charitable trust, like all express trusts, cannot be undone unless there is something allowing that within the trust instrument.|$|E

40|$|Background Organ {{donation}} <b>after</b> cardiac <b>death</b> is increas-ingly implemented, with outcomes {{similar to}} those of organ donation <b>after</b> brain <b>death.</b> Many hospitals hesitate to imple-ment a protocol for donation <b>after</b> cardiac <b>death</b> because of the potential negative reactions among health care providers. Objectives To determine the acceptance of a protocol for donation <b>after</b> cardiac <b>death</b> among multidisciplinary staff in a pediatric intensive care unit. Methods An anonymous, 15 -question, Likert-scale question-naire (scores 1 - 5) was used to determine the opinions of staff about donation <b>after</b> brain <b>death</b> and <b>after</b> cardiac <b>death</b> in a pediatric intensive care unit of a tertiary-care university hospital. Results Survey response rate was 67 % (n = 60). All physi-cians, 89 % of nurses, and 82 % of the remaining staff mem-bers stated that they understood the difference between donation <b>after</b> brain <b>death</b> and donation <b>after</b> cardiac death; staff supported both types of donation, at rates of 90 % and 85 %, respectively. Staff perception was the same for each type of donation (ρ = 0. 82; r = 0. 92; P <. 001). The 20 staff members who provided care directly to patients who were donors <b>after</b> cardiac <b>death</b> considered such donation worth-while. However, 60 % of those providers offered suggestions to improve the established protocol for donation. Conclusions The multidisciplinary staff has accepted organ donation <b>after</b> cardiac <b>death</b> and has fully integrated this kind of donation without reported differences from their accept-ance of donation <b>after</b> brain <b>death.</b> (American Journal of Criti...|$|R

5|$|Church {{belief in}} {{the resurrection of the}} body led to a {{prohibition}} against cremation that was pastorally modified at the Second Vatican Council in the 1960s under limited circumstances, but those conditions have been largely ignored even by the clergy. According to the Catechism, burial of the dead is a corporal work of mercy that must treat the body with respect and love (e.g. scattering of cremated remains, burial in an unmarked grave, etc. are forbidden in the Catholic Church). Organ donation <b>after</b> <b>death</b> and organ transplants under certain terms, also autopsies for legal and scientific reasons are permitted.|$|E

For example, minigames in Five Nights at Freddy's 2 are speculated to portray the homicidal incidents previously mentioned in the games. Minigames in Five Nights at Freddy's 4 tell the story of a character, possibly the player character, who dies in a tragic accident.|$|E
5|$|In modern times, {{the vampire}} is {{generally}} {{held to be}} a fictitious entity, although belief in similar vampiric creatures such as the chupacabra still persists in some cultures.

40|$|Although the {{majority}} of deceased-donor kidneys are donated <b>after</b> brain <b>death,</b> increased recovery of kidneys donated <b>after</b> cardiac <b>death</b> could reduce the organ shortage {{and is now a}} national priority. Racial disparities in donations <b>after</b> brain <b>death</b> have been well described for renal transplantation, but it is unknown whether similar disparities occur in donations <b>after</b> cardiac <b>death.</b> In this study, outcomes of adult deceased-donor renal transplant recipients included in the United Network for Organ Sharing database (1993 through 2006) were analyzed. Among black recipients of kidneys obtained <b>after</b> cardiac <b>death,</b> those who received kidneys from black donors had better long-term graft and patient survival than those who received kidneys from white donors. In addition, compared with standard-criteria kidneys from white donors <b>after</b> brain <b>death,</b> kidneys from black donors <b>after</b> cardiac <b>death</b> conferred a 70 % reduction in the risk for graft loss (adjusted hazard ratio 0. 30; 95 % confidence interval 0. 14 to 0. 65; P = 0. 002) and a 59 % reduction in risk for death (adjusted hazard ratio 0. 41; 95 % confidence interval 0. 2 to 0. 87; P = 0. 02) among black recipients.
