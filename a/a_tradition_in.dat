5|$|The four hymns Bach {{inserted}} in the Magnificat for the Christmas vespers had <b>a</b> <b>tradition</b> <b>in</b> Leipzig. A setting by Bach's predecessor Kuhnau in a Christmas cantata is extant. They can be connected to scenic display of the Christmas story, representing the annunciation to the shepherds, first by one angel (A, B), then by the multitude (C), finally a cradle song (Kindleinwiegen, D). In Bach's autograph, the four movements are grouped {{at the back of}} the volume. They are written in older musical styles than most of the Magnificat movements.|$|E

5|$|Briarcliff {{is often}} {{recognized}} {{at the annual}} awards ceremony at the Helen Hayes Youth Theatre in Nyack, ceremonies which are held in early June with awards in numerous categories, modeled after the Tony Award. Their 2002 performance of Children of Eden earned ten nominations and three awards, for overall production, actor in a lead role, and director. The school spent $23,000 on the production to pay for royalties, stipends for teachers acting as choreographers, musical directors and rehearsal accompanists, and for external workers to help students improve the production's lighting, sets and sound. For their 2003 production of Footloose, the school's musical director Kathleen Donovan-Warren rented multicolored stage lighting and hired an electric guitarist as one of three professional musicians who played along with the student orchestra. There was <b>a</b> <b>tradition</b> <b>in</b> the musicals for the superintendent to have a cameo in the show, up until around 1999.|$|E
5|$|During {{the reign}} of Kithsirimevan (301–328), Sudatta, the sub king of Kalinga, and Hemamala brought the Tooth Relic of the Buddha to Sri Lanka because of unrest in their country. Kithsirimevan carried it in {{procession}} and placed the relic in a mansion named Datadhatughara. He ordered this procession to be held annually, and this is still done as <b>a</b> <b>tradition</b> <b>in</b> the country. The Tooth Relic of the Buddha soon {{became one of the}} most sacred objects in the country, and a symbol of kingship. The person who was in possession of the Tooth Relic would be the rightful ruler of the country. Therefore, it was often enshrined within the royal palace itself.|$|E
5|$|Eeyore's Birthday Party {{began in}} 1963 as a spring party and picnic for Department of English {{students}} at the University of Texas at Austin by Lloyd W. Birdwell, Jr. and other UT students. It was named for Eeyore, a chronically depressed donkey in A. A. Milne's Winnie-the-Pooh stories who, in one story, believes his friends have forgotten his birthday only to discover they have planned a surprise party for him. Despite its name, the event does not fall on the official birthday of the fictional character. The original event featured a trashcan full of lemonade, beer, honey sandwiches, a live, flower-draped donkey, and a may pole (in keeping with the event's proximity to May Day). For many years the party was a UT tradition, but subsequently the annual Birthday Party became <b>a</b> <b>tradition</b> <b>in</b> Austin's hippie subculture.|$|E

5|$|The Briarcliff Manor Community Bonfire is {{a winter}} holiday event at Law Park, {{hosted by the}} village and the Briarcliff Friends of the Arts, {{involving}} live music (primarily seasonal and holiday songs), refreshments, and craft projects for children. Another annual community event is the Memorial Day parade, <b>a</b> <b>tradition</b> <b>in</b> Briarcliff Manor for more than fifty years. Before the parade begins, the Municipal Building's bell is rung to commemorate firefighters who {{have died in the}} previous year; the parade ends at the village's war memorial in Law Park, where wreaths are laid on the monument. The holiday has been celebrated in the village since the early 1900s, though initially involving large family picnics, with parades reserved for the Fourth of July.|$|E
5|$|Petrus Christus {{placed his}} sitter in a naturalistic setting {{rather than a}} flat and featureless background. This {{approach}} was in part a reaction against van der Weyden, who, in his emphasis on sculptural figures, utilised very shallow pictorial spaces. In his 1462 , Dieric Bouts went further by situating the man in a room complete with a window that looks out at a landscape, while in the 16th century, the full-length portrait became popular in the north. The latter format was practically unseen in earlier northern art, although it had <b>a</b> <b>tradition</b> <b>in</b> Italy going back centuries, most usually in fresco and illuminated manuscripts. Full-length portraits were reserved for depictions of the highest echelon of society, and were associated with princely displays of power. Of the second generation of northern painters, Hans Memling became the leading portraitist, taking commissions from as far as Italy. He was highly influential on later painters and is credited with inspiring Leonardo's positioning of the Mona Lisa {{in front of a}} landscape view. Van Eyck and van der Weyden similarly influenced the French artist Jean Fouquet and the Germans Hans Pleydenwurff and Martin Schongauer among others.|$|E
5|$|The {{interiors}} of most Norfolk churches contain much pre-Reformation graffiti, {{unless they have}} been heavily limewashed or resurfaced. The churches of the Glaven ports in general, and Blakeney in particular, conform to this pattern. St Nicholas has an extensive array of prayers, merchant's marks and other symbols, but is notable for {{the large number of}} depictions of ships, at least 30, heavily concentrated in the nave towards the eastern end of the south aisle. There is a side altar there of unknown dedication, and an empty niche that would have once held the image of a saint. The pillars were painted red in the Middle Ages, and ship images scratched into the soft, chalky stone would have been much more conspicuous than they are now. It is likely that the images, mostly of smaller ships, were created as votive offerings by the seafaring inhabitants of the port. The carving of ship graffiti in religious buildings is <b>a</b> <b>tradition</b> <b>in</b> ports going back to the Bronze Age, and has been found across Europe.|$|E
