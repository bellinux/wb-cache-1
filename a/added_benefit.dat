5|$|In {{addition}} to antidotes, an important treatment for poisoning {{is the use}} of hemodialysis. Hemodialysis is used to enhance the removal of unmetabolized ethylene glycol, as well as its metabolites from the body. It {{has been shown to be}} highly effective in the removal of ethylene glycol and its metabolites from the blood. Hemodialysis also has the <b>added</b> <b>benefit</b> of correcting other metabolic derangements or supporting deteriorating kidney function. Hemodialysis is usually indicated in patients with severe metabolic acidosis (blood pH less than 7.3), kidney failure, severe electrolyte imbalance, or if the patient's condition is deteriorating despite treatment. Often both antidotal treatment and hemodialysis are used together in the treatment of poisoning. Because hemodialysis will also remove the antidotes from the blood, doses of antidotes need to be increased to compensate. If hemodialysis is not available, then peritoneal dialysis also removes ethylene glycol, although less efficiently.|$|E
5|$|The German UB II {{design of}} coastal {{submarines}} was a development from {{the design of}} the UB I boats, which had been originally ordered in September 1914. During their trials, the UB I boats were found to be too small and too slow, but in-service use revealed another problem. The UB I boats had a single propeller shaft/engine combo such that if either component failed, the U-boat became almost totally disabled. The UB II boats featured twin propeller shafts and twin engines (one shaft for each engine) which not only alleviated this problem, but also had the <b>added</b> <b>benefit</b> of increasing the top speed. The new design also included more powerful batteries, larger torpedo tubes, and a deck gun. The UB II boats could also carry twice the torpedo load of their predecessors, and nearly ten times as much fuel. To contain all of these changes the hull was larger, and the surface and submerged displacement was more than doubled.|$|E
5|$|As {{the crew}} began {{to prepare for}} arrival at Sioux City, they {{questioned}} whether they should deploy the landing gear or belly-land the aircraft with the gear retracted. They decided that having the landing gear down would provide some shock absorption on impact. The complete hydraulic failure left the landing gear lowering mechanism inoperative. Two options were available to the flight crew. The DC-10 is designed such that if hydraulic pressure to the landing gear is lost, the gear will fall down slightly and rest on the landing gear doors. Placing the regular landing gear handle in the down position will unlock the doors mechanically, and the doors and landing gear will then fall down into place and lock due to gravity. An alternative system is also available using a lever in the cockpit floor to cause the landing gear to fall into position. This lever has the <b>added</b> <b>benefit</b> of unlocking the outboard ailerons, which are not used in high-speed flight and are locked in a neutral position. The crew hoped {{that there might be}} some trapped hydraulic fluid in the outboard ailerons and that they might regain some use of flight controls by unlocking them. They elected to extend the gear with the alternative system. Although the gear deployed successfully, there was no change in the controllability of the aircraft.|$|E

5|$|Neuroimaging {{is helpful}} but not {{flawless}} in detecting raised ICP. A more accurate {{way to measure}} ICP is to place a catheter into a ventricle of the brain, which has the <b>added</b> <b>benefit</b> of allowing cerebrospinal fluid to drain, releasing pressure in the skull. Treatment of raised ICP may {{be as simple as}} tilting the patient's bed and straightening the head to promote blood flow through the veins of the neck. Sedatives, analgesics and paralytic agents are often used. Hypertonic saline can improve ICP by reducing the amount of cerebral water (swelling), though it is used with caution to avoid electrolyte imbalances or heart failure. Mannitol, an osmotic diuretic, appears to be equally effective at reducing ICP. Some concerns; however, have been raised regarding some of the studies performed. Diuretics, drugs that increase urine output to reduce excessive fluid in the system, may be used to treat high intracranial pressures, but may cause hypovolemia (insufficient blood volume). Hyperventilation (larger and/or faster breaths) reduces carbon dioxide levels and causes blood vessels to constrict; this decreases blood flow to the brain and reduces ICP, but it potentially causes ischemia and is, therefore, used only in the short term. Administration of corticosteroids is associated with an increased risk of death, and so it is recommended that they not be given routinely.|$|E
25|$|An <b>added</b> <b>benefit</b> {{is reduced}} oxygen levels {{in such a}} closed system, which allows for some {{relaxation}} in the requirements for materials used in the {{hot water storage tank}} and the closed water circuits, external heat exchangers, and associated pipework.|$|E
25|$|Specially bred mustard {{varieties}} {{can produce}} reasonably high oil yields {{and are very}} useful in crop rotation with cereals, and have the <b>added</b> <b>benefit</b> that the meal left over after the oil has been pressed out can act as an effective and biodegradable pesticide.|$|E

25|$|In July 2005, the {{university}} purchased the Belgrave Centre, thus releasing Nottingham Law School from its ongoing rental commitment {{along with the}} <b>added</b> <b>benefit</b> of providing rental income from the Government Office of the East Midlands, which had a tenancy agreement until 2010 for {{approximately half of the}} building.|$|E
25|$|As these {{bees are}} {{relatively}} short-lived, {{there is no}} generation overlap. However, old, abandoned and empty nests will be repaired and reused by new female bees. This is advantageous as they will only need to provision pollen to nurture larval development. It also has the <b>added</b> <b>benefit</b> of decreasing the time required for nest completion and allowing females to put more resources into laying more eggs.|$|E
25|$|With {{software}} and other non-animal methods, {{there is also}} no expensive disposal of equipment or hazardous material removal. Some programs also allow educators to customize lessons and include built-in test and quiz modules that can track student performance. Furthermore, animals (whether dead or alive) can be used only once, while non-animal resources can be used for many years—an <b>added</b> <b>benefit</b> that could result in significant cost savings for teachers, school districts, and state educational systems.|$|E
5000|$|Some of the <b>added</b> <b>benefits</b> are a {{sense of}} {{community}} and socialising. Stokvel members traditionally meet regularly and make an occasion of the meetings.|$|R

25|$|Stableford {{can have}} the <b>added</b> <b>benefit</b> of {{speeding}} up the pace of play, as once {{it is no longer}} possible to score a point, players do not have to complete the hole but can simply pick up their ball and proceed to the next hole. It is a popular form of the game, especially at club level and particularly in the United Kingdom, as it is still possible to record a competitive score despite having the occasional bad hole.|$|E
25|$|The {{existence}} of privileged groups {{may not be}} a complete solution to the free rider problem, however, as underproduction of the public good may still result. The street light builder, for instance, would not consider the <b>added</b> <b>benefit</b> to neighboring businesses when determining whether to erect his street light, making it possible that the street light isn't built when the cost of building is too high for the single entrepreneur even when the total benefit to all the businesses combined exceeds the cost.|$|E
25|$|District heating has various {{advantages}} {{compared to}} individual heating systems. Usually district heating is more energy efficient, due to simultaneous production {{of heat and}} electricity in {{combined heat and power}} generation plants. This has the <b>added</b> <b>benefit</b> of reducing carbon emissions. The larger combustion units also have a more advanced flue gas cleaning than single boiler systems. In the case of surplus heat from industries, district heating systems do not use additional fuel because they recover heat which would otherwise be dispersed to the environment.|$|E
50|$|GPOs {{submit that}} their {{services}} allow for improved operating margins for healthcare providers, and that members enjoy value <b>added</b> <b>benefits</b> like clinical support, benchmarking data, supply chain support and comprehensive portfolios {{of products and}} services to address specific needs.|$|R
30|$|Improved {{access to}} markets also has other <b>added</b> <b>benefits</b> for {{pastoral}} households apart from livestock sales, such as ease of importing commercial livestock feed during {{extended periods of}} drought, securing livestock drugs and vaccines as well as borehole equipment and spares.|$|R

25|$|Captain America's uniform {{is made of}} a {{fire-retardant}} material, and {{he wears}} a lightweight, bulletproof duralumin scale armor beneath his uniform for added protection. Originally, Rogers' mask was a separate piece of material, but an early engagement had it dislodged, thus almost exposing his identity. To prevent a recurrence of the situation, Rogers modified the mask with connecting material to his uniform, an <b>added</b> <b>benefit</b> of which was extending his armor to cover his previously exposed neck. As {{a member of the}} Avengers, Rogers has an Avengers priority card, which serves as a communications device.|$|E
25|$|After 123 {{production}} aircraft {{had been built}} a number of improvements {{were made to the}} 112 in 1974, producing the 112A. The doors were fixed by replacing them with new aluminum units, which added still more weight, but had the <b>added</b> <b>benefit</b> of making the cabin quieter. The wing was redesigned internally with increased fuel capacity and a 100lb increase in maximum takeoff weight (MTOW) to 2,650lb; After another 30 112s were built, Rockwell offered an option for increased fuel capacity (68 US gallon vs. 48 gallon standard tanks).|$|E
25|$|The Antonov OKB {{set about}} {{rectifying}} these faults with increased-area {{vertical and horizontal}} tail surfaces, anti-spin strakes on the upper rear fuselage sides, deleting the wing LE slats, local structural reinforcements and replacing the TV-2 engines with Ivchenko AI-20D turboprop engines, which had the <b>added</b> <b>benefit</b> of reducing the empty weight by three tonnes (6,600lb). The new design required the use of new production techniques, such as stamping and forging of large high-strength parts, extrusion of long sections, chemical milling of large skin panels and other new techniques.|$|E
50|$|Managed {{accounts}} {{started as}} separately managed accounts (SMAs) and have since evolved into multiple strategy accounts (MSAs) and the rapidly emerging unified managed accounts (UMAs). There is broad agreement that managed accounts provide the <b>added</b> <b>benefits</b> of greater transparency, liquidity and control.|$|R

25|$|In 1994 the Toyota Curren came in two models, the ST206 and the ST207. The ST206 {{had four}} {{different}} trim levels. The FS, XS, ZS and the ZS Sport Selection. The FS and XS models were both {{powered by the}} 140hp 3S-FE engine, whereas the ZS models were powered by the 170-180hp 3S-GE engine. The ZS Sport Selection had the <b>added</b> <b>benefit</b> of a limited slip differential and a leather steering wheel. The ST207 only came in the XS Touring Selection, which was powered by the 3S-FE and came equipped with four wheel steering and Toyota's active suspension package called TACS.|$|E
25|$|Prevention {{involves}} improved sanitation {{and access}} to clean water. Cholera vaccines that are given by mouth provide reasonable protection for about six months. They have the <b>added</b> <b>benefit</b> of protecting against another type of diarrhea caused by E.coli. The primary treatment is oral rehydration therapy—the replacement of fluids with slightly sweet and salty solutions. Rice-based solutions are preferred. Zinc supplementation is useful in children. In severe cases, intravenous fluids, such as Ringer's lactate, may be required, and antibiotics may be beneficial. Testing to see which antibiotic the cholera is susceptible to can help guide the choice.|$|E
25|$|The Berlin Conference of 1884 {{assigned}} the territory to Germany {{and began a}} policy of ruling through the Rwandan monarchy; this system had the <b>added</b> <b>benefit</b> of enabling colonization with small European troop numbers. European colonists, convinced the Tutsi had migrated to Rwanda from Ethiopia, believed the Tutsi were more Caucasian than the Hutu and were therefore racially superior and better suited to carry out colonial administrative tasks. King Yuhi V Musinga welcomed the Germans, whom he used to strengthen his rule. Belgian forces took control of Rwanda and Burundi during World War I, and the country was formally passed to Belgian control by a League of Nations mandate in 1919.|$|E
40|$|Row covers have {{traditionally}} been used to increase crop earliness, leading to earlier harvest dates and higher market prices.
