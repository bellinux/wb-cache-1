5|$|Endoparasites {{known to}} infect wolves include {{protozoan}}s and helminths (flukes, tapeworms, roundworms and thorny-headed worms). Of 30,000 protozoan species, {{only a few}} have been recorded to infect wolves: Isospora, Toxoplasma, Sarcocystis, Babesia, and Giardia. Wolves may carry Neospora caninum, which is of particular concern to farmers, as the disease can be spread to livestock, with infected animals being 3–13 {{times more likely to}} miscarry than those not infected. Among flukes, the most common in North American wolves is Alaria, which infects small rodents and amphibians that are eaten by wolves. Upon reaching maturity, Alaria migrates to the wolf's intestine, but harms it little. Metorchis conjunctus, which enters wolves through eating fish, infects the wolf's liver or gall bladder, causing liver disease, inflammation of the pancreas, and emaciation. Most other fluke species reside in the wolf's intestine, though Paragonimus westermani lives in the lungs. Tapeworms are commonly found in wolves, as their primary hosts are ungulates, small mammals, and fish, which wolves feed upon. Tapeworms generally cause little harm in wolves, though this depends on the number and size of the parasites, and the sensitivity of the host. Symptoms often include constipation, toxic and allergic reactions, irritation of the intestinal mucosa, and malnutrition. Infections by the tapeworm Echinococcus granulosus in ungulate populations tend to increase in areas with high wolf densities, as wolves can shed Echinoccocus eggs in their feces onto grazing areas. Wolves can carry over 30 roundworm species, though most roundworm infections appear benign, depending on the number of worms and the age of the host. Ancylostoma caninum attaches itself on the intestinal wall to feed on the host's blood, and can cause hyperchromic anemia, emaciation, diarrhea, and possibly death. Toxocara canis, a hookworm known to infect wolf pups in utero, can cause intestinal irritation, bloating, vomiting, and diarrhea. Wolves may catch Dioctophyma renale from minks, which infects the kidneys, and can grow to lengths of 100cm. D. renale causes the complete destruction of the kidney's functional tissue, and can be fatal if both kidneys are infected. Wolves can tolerate low levels of Dirofilaria immitis for many years without showing any ill effects, though high levels can kill wolves through cardiac enlargement and congestive hepatopathy. Wolves probably become infected with Trichinella spiralis by eating infected ungulates. <b>Although</b> <b>T.</b> spiralis isn't known to produce clinical signs in wolves, it can cause emaciation, salivation, and crippling muscle pains in dogs. Thorny-headed worms rarely infect wolves, though three species have been identified in Russian wolves: Nicolla skrjabini, Macrocantorhynchus catulinus, and Moniliformis moniliformis.|$|E

500|$|Red Alarm was {{published}} by Nintendo and developed by T Soft, {{one of the few}} third-party companies approached to develop for the Virtual Boy. According to the console's creator, Gunpei Yokoi, Nintendo tried to [...] "maintain as much control as possible" [...] over Virtual Boy game development so that low-quality releases by outside companies could be avoided. <b>Although</b> <b>T</b> Soft was known for golf video games, the design of Red Alarm was inspired by that of Star Fox, a rail shooter for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System. This decision was considered by Patrick Kolan of IGN to be [...] "a departure for the team". Unlike many Virtual Boy games, Red Alarm features an engine that displays 3D graphics: the game world is rendered in wire-frame polygonal visuals {{similar to those of the}} 1980 arcade game Battlezone. Because of the console's limited technology, solid 3D graphics were not viable.|$|E
2500|$|In warm-blooded animals, such as brown rats, sheep, and dogs, T. gondii {{has also}} been shown to be sexually transmitted, and it is {{hypothesized}} that it may be sexually transmitted in humans, although not yet proven. [...] <b>Although</b> <b>T.</b> gondii can infect, be transmitted by, and asexually reproduce within humans and virtually all other warm-blooded animals, the parasite can sexually reproduce only within the intestines of members of the cat family (felids). [...] Felids are therefore the definitive hosts of T. gondii; all other hosts (like human or other mammals) are intermediate hosts.|$|E
2500|$|Thymectomy is the {{surgical}} {{removal of the}} thymus. [...] The usual reason for a thymectomy is {{to gain access to}} the heart for surgery to correct congenital heart defects in the neonatal period. [...] In neonates, but not older children or adults, the relative size of the thymus obstructs surgical access to the heart. [...] Removal of the thymus in infancy results in immunodeficiency by some measures, <b>although</b> <b>T</b> cells develop compensating function and it remains unknown whether disease incidence in later life is significantly greater. This is because sufficient T cells are generated during fetal life prior to birth. [...] These T cells are long-lived and can proliferate by homeostatic proliferation throughout the lifetime of the patient. [...] However, there is evidence of premature immune aging in patients thymectomized during early childhood.|$|E

2500|$|Taxus brevifolia var. reptaneta. <b>Although</b> <b>T.</b> brevifolia is {{typically}} a tree as described above, T. brevifolia var. reptaneta is a shrub variety that generally {{occurs in the}} mid to upper elevation range of the typical variety, 3,500 to 4,000ft (1000–1219 m) at its southernmost occurrence in the Klamath Mountains region, and at lower elevations further north. [...] It is distinguished from young trees of the typical variety (var. brevifolia) by its stems initially creeping along the ground for a short distance before ascending (curving) upwards and by the branches growing off {{to one side of the}} stem, usually the upper side. The epithet reptaneta is from the Latin reptans which means “creeping, prostrate, and rooting,” which is exactly what this variety does; in rooting it forms yew thickets; hence, the epithet reptaneta (etum means collective place of growth) and hence the common name, thicket yew. Unlike the typical variety, thicket yew grows in abundance on open sunny avalanche shoots or ravines as well as in the forest understory. [...] It also occurs along forest margins. In northwestern Montana, a variant of the thicket yew does not ascend upwards; rather, it remains along the ground. [...] This is probably the ancestral form; the upright form with branches along the upper side would be the expected growth pattern that might evolve from one with stems that strictly creep along the ground since branches can only arise from the upper surface.|$|E
60|$|During {{the latter}} part of my stay in New Guinea the weather was very wet, my only shooter was ill, and birds became scarce, so that my only {{resource}} was insect-hunting. I worked very hard every hour of fine weather, and daily obtained a number of new species. Every dead tree and fallen log was searched and searched again; and among the dry and rotting leaves, which still hung on certain trees which had been cut down, I found an abundant harvest of minute Coleoptera. Although I never afterwards found so many large and handsome beetles as in Borneo, yet I obtained here a great variety of species. For the first two or three weeks, while I was searching out the best localities, I took about 30 different kinds of beetles n day, besides about half that number of butterflies, {{and a few of the}} other orders. But afterwards, up to the very last week, I averaged 49 species a day. On the 31st of May, I took 78 distinct sorts, a larger number than I had ever captured before, principally obtained among dead trees and under rotten bark. A good long walk on a fine day up the hill, and to the plantations of the natives, capturing everything not very common that came in my way, would produce about 60 species; but on the last day of June I brought home no less than 95 distinct kinds of beetles, a larger number than I ever obtained in one day before or since. It was a fine hot day, and I devoted it to a search among dead leaves, beating foliage, and hunting under rotten bark, in all the best stations I had discovered during my walks. I was out from ten in the morning till three in the afternoon, and it took me six hours' work at home to pin and set out all the specimens, and to separate the species. <b>Although</b> <b>T</b> had already been working this shot daily for two months and a half, and had obtained over 800 species of Coleoptera, this day's work added 32 new ones. Among these were 4 Longicorns, 2 Caribidae, 7 Staphylinidae, 7 Curculionidae, 2 Copridae, 4 Chrysomelidae, 3 Heteromera, 1 Elates, and 1 Buprestis. Even on the last day I went out, I obtained 10 new species; so that although I collected over a thousand distinct sorts of beetles in a space not much exceeding a square mile during the three months of my residence at Dorey, I cannot believe that this represents one half the species really inhabiting the same spot, or a fourth of what might be obtained in an area extending twenty miles in each direction.|$|E
