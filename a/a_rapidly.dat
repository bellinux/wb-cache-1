5|$|Remnants of many supernovae {{consist of}} a compact object and <b>a</b> <b>rapidly</b> {{expanding}} shock wave of material. This cloud of material sweeps up the surrounding interstellar medium during a free expansion phase, which can last {{for up to two}} centuries. The wave then gradually undergoes a period of adiabatic expansion, and will slowly cool and mix with the surrounding interstellar medium over a period of about 10,000years.|$|E

5|$|The {{suburb of}} Beaumont, in the City of Burnside, was founded as a {{purpose-built}} village by Sir Samuel Davenport in 1848. The location of Beaumont to Adelaide, <b>a</b> <b>rapidly</b> developing settlement at the time, made {{land in the}} area extremely expensive. Although Adelaide as a new settlement was prospering during the mid-19th century, still very few people could afford the exclusivity of Beaumont.|$|E

Tiruchirappalli is a hub for low-cost medical tourism in central Tamil Nadu.|$|E
5|$|According to a 2011 PricewaterhouseCoopers report, India's GDP at {{purchasing}} power parity could overtake {{that of the}} United States by 2045. During the next four decades, Indian GDP {{is expected to grow}} at an annualised average of 8%, making it potentially the world's fastest-growing major economy until 2050. The report highlights key growth factors: a young and rapidly growing working-age population; growth in the manufacturing sector because of rising education and engineering skill levels; and sustained growth of the consumer market driven by <b>a</b> <b>rapidly</b> growing middle class. The World Bank cautions that, for India to achieve its economic potential, it must continue to focus on public sector reform, transport infrastructure, agricultural and rural development, removal of labour regulations, education, energy security, and public health and nutrition.|$|E

5|$|Another {{example of}} the {{structural}} similarity of some inhibitors to the substrates of the enzymes they target {{is seen in the}} figure comparing the drug methotrexate to folic acid. Folic acid is a substrate of dihydrofolate reductase, an enzyme involved in making nucleotides that is potently inhibited by methotrexate. Methotrexate blocks the action of dihydrofolate reductase and thereby halts the production of nucleotides. This block of nucleotide biosynthesis is more toxic to rapidly growing cells than non-dividing cells, since <b>a</b> <b>rapidly</b> growing cell has to carry out DNA replication, therefore methotrexate is often used in cancer chemotherapy.|$|E
5|$|As Article 39A of the Constitution states, the GRC scheme entrenches the {{presence}} of minority MPs in Parliament, ensuring that interests of minority communities are represented in Parliament. Article 39A(1)(a) of the Constitution allows for a maximum number of six MPs for each GRC so as to provide flexibility in ensuring that a GRC with <b>a</b> <b>rapidly</b> expanding population is properly managed. As the population of a constituency grows, it becomes increasingly difficult for an MP to singlehandedly represent all his or her constituents' views. A team of MPs arguably has greater access to more constituents, {{and the fact that}} there are different MPs in the team suggests they can more effectively provide representation in Parliament of a wide range of constituents' views.|$|E
5|$|Atlanta was <b>a</b> <b>rapidly</b> growing city in {{the years}} before Piedmont Park. From 1860 to 1890, the {{population}} jumped from 9,554 to 65,533 residents. Those years saw the opening of many education institutions such as Morehouse College (1867), Clark College (1869), Spelman College (1881), Morris Brown College (1882), Georgia School of Technology (now known as the Georgia Institute of Technology) (1885), and Agnes Scott College (1890).

5|$|Born in Gothenburg, Sweden, PewDiePie {{originally}} {{pursued a}} degree in industrial economics and technology management at Chalmers University of Technology. In 2010, during his time at the university, he registered a YouTube account under the name PewDiePie. The following year, {{he dropped out of}} Chalmers after becoming disinterested with his degree field, much to the dismay of his parents. After failing to earn an apprenticeship with an advertising agency in Scandinavia, he then decided to focus on creating content for his YouTube channel. In order to fund his videos, PewDiePie began selling prints of his Photoshop art projects and working at a hot dog stand. PewDiePie soon gathered <b>a</b> <b>rapidly</b> increasing online following, and in July 2012, his channel surpassed one million subscribers.|$|E
5|$|By early 1945, Germany's {{military}} {{situation was}} on the verge of total collapse. Hitler, presiding over <b>a</b> <b>rapidly</b> disintegrating Third Reich, retreated to his Führerbunker in Berlin on 16 January 1945. To the Nazi leadership, it was clear that the battle for Berlin would be the final battle of the war. Berlin was bombarded by Soviet artillery for the first time on 20 April 1945 (Hitler's birthday). By the evening of 21 April, Red Army tanks reached the outskirts of the city. By 27 April, Berlin was cut off from the rest of Germany.|$|E
5|$|Command & Conquer {{is set in}} an {{alternate}} timeline, after a meteorite crashed near the river Tiber in Italy in 1995. The meteorite brings with it an extremely toxic alien substance called Tiberium, which becomes extremely valuable because {{of its ability to}} absorb and crystallize precious metals from the surrounding soil. An ancient, cultic secret society called the Brotherhood of Nod claims to have foreseen the potentials of this new substance, investing in the development of technology to harvest and refine Tiberium crystals ahead of the scientific community. Nod soon controls nearly half of the supply and uses these assets to sustain <b>a</b> <b>rapidly</b> growing army of followers worldwide. The group is led by a self-proclaimed messianic figure known only as Kane.|$|E

5|$|Early on April15, Sudal passed {{very near}} the {{uninhabited}} Japanese island of Iwo Jima as <b>a</b> <b>rapidly</b> weakening typhoon; at the time, its circulation center was exposed from the deepest convection. Shortly thereafter, both the JTWC and JMA downgraded Sudal to tropical storm status. Late on April15, the JTWC assessed the storm as becoming extratropical, although the JMA maintained advisories until the following day. As an extratropical storm, Sudal continued northeastward until losing its identity early on April18, well east of Japan and far south of the Aleutian Islands.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Lorenzo was <b>a</b> <b>rapidly</b> {{developing}} {{tropical cyclone}} that struck the Mexican state of Veracruz in late September 2007. The twelfth named storm and fifth hurricane of the 2007 Atlantic hurricane season, it {{formed in the}} southwestern Gulf of Mexico from a tropical wave. After meandering for two days without development, the storm began a steady westward track as its structure became better organized. In an 18‑hour period, Lorenzo's winds increased from 35mph (55km/h) to 80mph (130km/h), or from a tropical depression to a hurricane. On September28 it struck near Tecolutla, Veracruz, a month after Hurricane Dean affected the same area, before it quickly dissipated over land.|$|E
5|$|In 1834, Charles Wheatstone {{developed}} {{a method of}} using <b>a</b> <b>rapidly</b> rotating mirror to study transient phenomena, and applied this method to measure the velocity of electricity in a wire and the duration of an electric spark.

Arago expanded upon Wheatstone's concept in an 1838 publication, emphasizing the possibility that a test of the relative speed of light in air versus water could be used to distinguish between the particle and wave theories of light.|$|E

Umatilla reported winds up to force12 on the Beaufort scale, or hurricane strength; the ship also reported very high seas and <b>a</b> <b>rapidly</b> decreasing pressure. Based on the report, the Miami Weather Bureau office initiated advisories on Hurricane Carol about 750miles (1200km) east-northeast of Barbados.|$|E

5|$|In {{the early}} 19th century, Ashton-under-Lyne's growth made it {{necessary}} {{to find a new}} water supply. Before the introduction of piped water the town's inhabitants drew water from wells and the nearby River Tame. Industrial processes had polluted the river however, and the wells could not sustain <b>a</b> <b>rapidly</b> expanding population. From 1825, a private company was responsible for piping water from reservoirs, but there were still many homes without proper drainage or water supply. Today, waste management is co-ordinated by the local authority via the Greater Manchester Waste Disposal Authority.|$|E
