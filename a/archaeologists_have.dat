5|$|<b>Archaeologists</b> <b>have</b> {{divided the}} long span of Zion's human history into three {{cultural}} periods: the Archaic, Protohistoric and Historic periods. Each period {{is characterized by}} distinctive technological and social adaptations.|$|E
5|$|At {{times during}} the last interglacial period (130,000– 70,000 BCE) Europe had a climate warmer than today's, and early humans may have {{made their way to}} what is now Scotland, though <b>archaeologists</b> <b>have</b> found no traces of this. Glaciers then scoured their way across most of Britain, and only after the ice retreated did Scotland again become habitable, around 9600 BCE. Mesolithic {{hunter-gatherer}} encampments formed the first known settlements, and <b>archaeologists</b> <b>have</b> dated a site near Biggar to around 8500 BCE. Numerous other sites found around Scotland build up a picture of highly mobile boat-using people making tools from bone, stone and antlers, probably with a very low density of population.|$|E
5|$|The North Group is a Late Classic compound. <b>Archaeologists</b> <b>have</b> {{excavated}} fallen façades {{that bear}} hieroglyphic inscriptions and sculpted decoration.|$|E

5|$|<b>Archaeologists</b> <b>have</b> {{attempted}} {{to test the}} suicide theory, particularly by {{the examination of the}} remains of skulls, but have been unable to reach a conclusion. The suicide theory cannot be ruled out by the archaeological evidence, but {{there is no evidence to}} support it, either.|$|E
5|$|<b>Archaeologists</b> <b>have</b> {{discovered}} {{traces of}} platinum {{in the gold}} used in ancient Egyptian tombs and hieroglyphs as early as 1200 BC. However, the extent of early Egyptians' knowledge of the metal is unclear. It is quite possible they did not recognize there was platinum in their gold.|$|E
5|$|<b>Archaeologists</b> <b>have</b> found {{evidence}} of prehistoric use of the Fossil Creek watershed, {{and it is possible}} that people lived here as long as 10,000 years ago. More recently, Yavapai and Apache peoples have lived in the area, also used by 19th-century cattlemen and shepherds.|$|E

5|$|<b>Archaeologists</b> <b>have</b> mapped 268 {{structures}} {{clustered in}} 53 groups around approximately 68 patios in the site core. Residential structures were {{concentrated in the}} area surrounding the ceremonial centre, especially on {{the north and west}} sides near to the reservoir. Residences tended to be larger the closer they were to the reservoir. The residential area of El Chal was extensive and <b>archaeologists</b> <b>have</b> divided it into four sectors. Municipal consists of the area occupied by the modern village, El Arrepentimiento is the northeastern portion of the site, Panorama is the northwestern area, and Central is the site core. Central El Chal contains 25 groups, Arrepentimiento contains 40 groups, Panorama contains 53 groups and Municipal contains 18 groups. Panorama was an area of chert production while Municipal is associated with the ritual complex of the city.|$|E

Numerous other sites found around Scotland build up a picture of highly mobile boat-using people making tools from bone, stone and antlers. The oldest house for which there is evidence in Britain is the oval structure of wooden posts found at South Queensferry near the Firth of Forth, dating from the Mesolithic period, about 8240 BCE.|$|E
5|$|Most {{settlements}} in ancient Egypt were {{situated on the}} alluvium of the Nile floodplain. This moist environment was unfavorable for long-term preservation of papyrus documents. <b>Archaeologists</b> <b>have</b> discovered a larger quantity of papyrus documents in desert settlements on land elevated above the floodplain, and in settlements that lacked irrigation works, such as Elephantine, El-Lahun, and El-Hiba.|$|E

5|$|Archaeological {{evidence}} points out, {{that during}} the Bronze Age the region was inhabited by populations that probably spoke a northwestern Greek dialect. <b>Archaeologists</b> <b>have</b> found pottery objects of the early Iron Age in Gjirokastër, which {{first appeared in the}} late Bronze Age in Pazhok, Elbasan County, and are found throughout Albania. The earliest recorded inhabitants of the area around Gjirokastër were the Greek-speaking tribe of the Chaonians, that belonged to the Epirote group.|$|E
5|$|<b>Archaeologists</b> <b>have</b> {{not been}} able to recover enough of Kronans sculptures for a {{detailed}} reconstruction of the ornamentation. The mascarons (architectural facemasks) and putti (images of children) that were salvaged as of 2007 show considerable artistic quality according to Soop. A large sculpture of a warrior figure was found in 1987 and is an example of high-quality workmanship, possibly even a symbolic portrait of King Charles. Since nothing is known of the surrounding ornamentation and sculptures, the conclusion remains speculative.|$|E
5|$|Haas {{suggests}} that the labour mobilization patterns revealed by the archaeological evidence point to a unique emergence of human government, one of two alongside Sumer (or three, if Mesoamerica is included as a separate case). While in other cases, the idea of government would have been borrowed or copied, in this small group, government was invented. Other <b>archaeologists</b> <b>have</b> rejected such claims as hyperbolic.|$|E
50|$|The ancient {{town was}} {{identified}} and excavated by the Albanian archaeologist Dhimosten Budina. More recently an Albanian-Greek team of <b>archaeologists</b> <b>has</b> {{been working on}} the site.|$|R

50|$|The Deer Creek Site {{is located}} east of Newkirk, Oklahoma. It is {{situated}} {{on a low}} bluff overlooking the Arkansas River. The Bryson Paddock site is almost 2 miles (3 km) north also on a low bluff near the river. Both sites were fortified with log and earth stockades surrounding villages of grass-thatched conical houses typical of the Wichita Indians. An <b>archaeologist</b> <b>has</b> estimated that the sites had a population of 3,000 people. Some of the houses were large. One, excavated by <b>archaeologists,</b> <b>had</b> a diameter of 42 feet.|$|R
5|$|In the 21st century, Launceston {{is owned}} by the duchy of Cornwall and {{operated}} by English Heritage as a tourist attraction. Much of the castle defences remain, including the motte, keep and high tower which overlook the castle's former deer park to the south. The gatehouses and some of the curtain wall have survived, and <b>archaeologists</b> <b>have</b> uncovered the foundations of various buildings in the bailey, including the great hall.|$|E
5|$|Marketplaces are {{difficult}} to identify archaeologically. However, the Spanish reported a thriving market economy when they arrived in the region. At some Classic period cities, <b>archaeologists</b> <b>have</b> tentatively identified formal arcade-style masonry architecture and parallel alignments of scattered stones as the permanent foundations of market stalls. A 2007 study analysed soils from a modern Guatemalan market and compared the results with those obtained from analysis at a proposed ancient market at Chunchucmil. Unusually high levels of zinc and phosphorus at both sites indicated similar food production and vegetable sales activity. The calculated density of market stalls at Chunchucmil strongly suggests that a thriving market economy already existed in the Early Classic. <b>Archaeologists</b> <b>have</b> tentatively identified marketplaces at {{an increasing number of}} Maya cities by means of a combination of archaeology and soil analysis. When the Spanish arrived, Postclassic cities in the highlands had markets in permanent plazas, with officials on hand to settle disputes, enforce rules, and collect taxes.|$|E
5|$|The Southward {{expansion}} of the Han dynasty brought the empire {{into contact with the}} civilizations of Southeast Asia. Chinese cultural and technological influence spread to nearby Southeast Asian kingdoms. Remnants of Chinese pottery from the Han dynasty have been excavated in Sumatra, Borneo, and Java that date from the 1st century. <b>Archaeologists</b> <b>have</b> also discovered bronze axes in Cambodia that were based on the design of Chinese axes.|$|E
50|$|<b>Archaeologists</b> <b>had</b> {{thought that}} the site was part of Tavaj, however, other discoveries in the region, made in 2004 and 2005, {{indicate}} that Tavaj is actually several kilometers away from the site.|$|R
5000|$|Between AD 1276 and 1299, <b>Archaeologist</b> <b>have</b> {{recorded}} {{a period of}} [...] "great drought," [...] leading (among other causes) to the eventual end of influence of the Anasazi on the Ganado region.|$|R
5000|$|The early {{dates of}} human {{presence}} at the cave show that humans did not exclusively migrate from North America down to the Andes in South America, which some <b>archaeologists</b> <b>had</b> previously believed.|$|R
5|$|The {{history of}} human {{habitation}} {{in and around}} Pettigrew State Park stretches {{back as far as}} 8000 BC. <b>Archaeologists</b> <b>have</b> found thousands of relics at the park, including pottery, arrowheads, and sunken dugout canoes. Estimates place some of the dugouts as being at least 4,400 years old. They were preserved {{in the bottom of the}} lake by its unusually clean waters.|$|E
5|$|Archaeological {{evidence}} {{under the}} Aros settlement's defences indicate {{the site was}} a town {{as early as the}} last quarter of the 8thcentury, considerably earlier than had been generally supposed. Discoveries after a 2003 archaeological dig unearthed half-buried longhouses, firepits, glass pearls and a road dated to the late 700s. <b>Archaeologists</b> <b>have</b> conducted several excavations in the inner city since the 1960s revealing wells, streets, homes and workshops. In the buildings and adjoining archaeological layers, everyday utensils like combs, jewellery and basic multi-purpose tools from approximately the year 900 have been found.|$|E
5|$|<b>Archaeologists</b> <b>have</b> {{attributed}} these circles to the Late Neolithic or Early Bronze Age, {{and have}} noted that they are comparable to the stone circles found further south, in Dartmoor. However, {{in contrast to the}} two known Exmoor circles, over seventy such monuments have been identified on Dartmoor. This may be because Exmoor, unlike Dartmoor, has no natural granite. Instead it has Devonian slates and Hangman Grits, both of which easily break up into small slabs, resulting in a general shortage of big stones on Exmoor.|$|E
