5|$|Harley's co-creator, Paul Dini, {{describes}} {{their relationship}} as Harley being someone {{who makes the}} Joker feel better about himself, <b>and</b> <b>who</b> <b>can</b> do the work {{that he does not}} want to do himself. In the 1999 one-shot comic Batman: Harley Quinn, the Joker decides to kill Harley, after admitting that he does care for her, that their relationship is romantic, and that these feelings prevent him from fulfilling his purpose. Removing the traditional male-female relationship, such as in the Batman: Thrillkiller storyline where the Joker (Bianca Steeplechase) is a female and involved in a lesbian relationship with Harley, their relationship lacks any aspects of violence or subjugation.|$|E

In France, Franco-Pondichériens face racial profiling and discrimination, due to their South Asian or mixed-race ethnicity and are perceived either as second-class citizens or economic immigrants.|$|E
25|$|Ronaldo {{is widely}} {{regarded}} as one of the two best players of his generation, alongside Lionel Messi, and as one of the best players to ever play the game.

Ronaldo is noted for his work ethic and dedication to improvement on the training pitch.

By marginalizing the contribution of the artists who exhibited at the Salon des Indépendants and Salon d'Automne, Kahnweiler's attempted to focus attention on Picasso and Braque, those who played a leading if independent {{role in the development of}} this new mode of expression. To some extent Kahnweiler had succeeded in his endeavor, prompting historians such as Douglas Cooper to coin the term ‘true’ Cubism to describe the work of Picasso and Braque.

25|$|In {{addition}} to protesting, ACORN also developed and strengthened its {{political action committees}} and encouraged its members to run for office. For the 1984 election ACORN wanted to endorse a candidate, setting a 75% support in polls among members as its requirement. No candidate reached that level, though there was strong support for Jesse Jackson. ACORN also established a legislative office that year in Washington, DC. During this period ACORN also focused on local election reform {{in a number of}} cities, including Pittsburgh, Columbia, South Carolina, and Sioux Falls, South Dakota. They encouraged cities to change legislative bodies whose members were elected at-large to electing members by single-member district, which resulted in more participation by minorities, including women. At-large voting tends to favor candidates who can appeal to the majority <b>and</b> <b>who</b> <b>can</b> command more campaign funding, reducing participation by a wider variety of citizens.|$|E

25|$|As {{the story}} {{continues}} {{from the previous}} episode, Emma sees the woman across from her in the cell as the same woman who was arrested for helping Snow, and learns that they are both due to be executed immediately the next day. Using her tricks from the night Neal broke into the amusement park, Emma remembers {{she knows how to}} break a lock by using two spoons, and it works. Later on, Charming catches Snow in the rope trap, although the timeline of their introduction is thrown off, until Hook shows up to say that another woman (Emma) has his ring. Charming looks at Snow's fairy dust pendant while she tells him her backstory (another timeline that was thrown off), and comes {{up with a plan to}} break into Regina’s castle first, then rescue Emma and steal back the ring. Snow tells them to wait, which gives Hook and Charming time to talk about love. Moments later, Red Riding Hood shows up, revealing herself as a friend of Snow's, <b>and</b> <b>who</b> <b>can</b> get them into the castle. As they reach the place, Red, who transformed into a wolf, scares a guard into running away, but the escape plan goes awry when they run into Emma and her fellow inmate, prompting Hook to tell Emma that she deprived him of a dashing rescue. Seconds later, Snow and Regina prepare to face off, with Snow throwing her dark fairy dust, but Regina uses her magic to stop it in midair. Snow tries telling her that what happened to Daniel (when she told Cora) was a mistake, saying that she was only a child, but an unforgiving Regina talks about consequences and sets up a stake to burn her. Regina throws a fireball at the helpless Snow White, who appears to die. Her death causes Red to howl as a wolf and Emma to cry over her mother's death.|$|E

She recalled, [...] "the media reported it to sound {{as if it was}} the work of amateurs. I started to think, what kind of amateurs could they be?" [...] and realised [...] "how easy it would be for a kid, not really knowing what he or she was doing, to drift into a terrorist group." [...] Lessing already had Alice in mind as the central character: [...] "I know several people like Alice—this mixture of... maternal caring,... <b>and</b> <b>who</b> <b>can</b> contemplate killing large numbers of people without a moment's bother." [...] She described Alice as [...] "quietly comic" [...] because she is so full of contradictions.

500|$|Linder {{affirms that}} {{it creates a}} {{dichotomy}} between [...] "success (whiteness) versus failure (blackness)." [...] Pimentel and Sawyer, as well as Linder, identify Larabee {{as the one who}} makes this separation clear when he manifests his disregard of African American Vernacular English. The co-authors wrote that Larabee implies that [...] "legitimate forms of intelligence can only be achieved through a Eurocentric perspective, thus advancing the message that Akeelah must be rescued from her African-American ways of knowing, in order to be considered intellectual." [...] Another contraposition commented by scholars was [...] "between the supportive Dr. Larabee and Akeelah's skeptical mother." [...] Pimental and Sawyer said she is portrayed as [...] "an African-American obstructionist", while scholar Gloria Ladson‐Billings asserted she represents the stereotype of [...] "ignorant Black woman". Although Fuchs said the film was able to avoid the [...] "white authority figure saves the underclass child" [...] plotline by introducing Larabee, Ladson‐Billings, Linder, and Pimentel and Sawyer opined that it did not. After all, Larabee, as Linder described, is [...] "a non-threatening black man who has assimilated to white culture <b>and</b> <b>who</b> <b>can</b> be depended on to help assimilate others".|$|E
500|$|Both Bevin and McConnell were {{critical}} of a February 2014 ruling by U.S. District Judge John G. Heyburn II that held that {{an amendment to}} the Kentucky Constitution banning same-sex marriage violated the Fourteenth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution. Bevin pointed out that Heyburn once worked for McConnell, who supported his nomination to the bench by President George H. W. Bush. Later in the month, Bevin told The Janet Mefford Show, [...] "If it's all right to have same-sex marriages, why not define a marriage– because {{at the end of the}} day, a lot of this ends up being taxes <b>and</b> <b>who</b> <b>can</b> visit who in the hospital and there's other repercussions and things that come with it– so a person may want to define themselves as being married to one of their children so that they can then in fact pass on certain things to that child financially and otherwise." [...] Critics charged that Bevin was suggesting that the legalization of same-sex marriage could lead to the acceptance of incestuous relationships; a Bevin spokesperson responded, [...] " [...] sees no comparison between gay marriage and incest. He was discussing the implications of the legal rights related to this issue such as hospital visitations and benefits. To imply otherwise is ridiculous." ...|$|E

In his review of the 2014 reissue of Harrison's Apple catalogue, for Classic Rock, Paul Trynka refers to Material Word as an album that [...] "sparkles with many gems"; of these, he adds, [...] "it's the more restrained tracks – Don't Let Me Wait Too Long, Who Can See It – that entrance: gorgeous pop songs, all the more forceful for their restraint."

Instead, JC returns to Paul's apartment to find Paul hiding inside. Paul further explains his defection and encourages JC to also defect by sending out a distress call to alert the NSF's allies.

JC is unable to escape UNATCO forces, and both he and Paul (provided he survived the raid on the apartment) are taken to a secret prison below UNATCO headquarters.

500|$|The casting {{directors}} for Obsessed were Ron Digman and Valorie Massalas.

He emphasized the need for actors [...] "who were relatable <b>and</b> <b>who</b> <b>can</b> handle that type of human interplay {{that we have in the}} film." [...] Packer showed the film script to Beyoncé's talent agent, who suggested that Beyoncé play the role of Sharon. The producers [...] "immediately ... fell in love with that idea; once she suggested Beyoncé, nobody else could play the role." [...] Packer said that Beyoncé became interested in working on Obsessed because the film was not focused on the music industry, and that it was the first time she played a non-singer. Packer also reported that [...] "she was looking for that challenge and welcomed this opportunity". Beyoncé stated that she found it challenging to concentrate purely on [...] "the emotion and the psychology of the relationship". Beyoncé had never taken part in a fight scene, but she was able to learn how to perform the scenes quickly because they were similar to dance choreography, with which she was familiar. Larter was inspired by Rita Hayworth, Barbara Stanwyck and Faye Dunaway, all of whom had previously portrayed femmes fatale. Obsessed was filmed over the summer of 2008, and the final fight scene between Sharon and Lisa was shot over one week.|$|E
