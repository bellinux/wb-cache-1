The name of the color (written in black ink) corresponding to the aircraft to target was displayed {{in the center of}} the screen. Simultaneously with the onset of the written name of the color, a spoken color name distractor that participants had to ignore was played. This auditory distractor was either congruent (10 %, spoken color name matched the written color) or incongruent (10 %, spoken color name did not match the written color). The task difficulty varied in terms of working memory load with an n-back-like sub-task. In the low load condition, participants had to target the aircraft corresponding to the currently presented written instruction (n = 0). In the high load condition, participants had to target the aircraft corresponding to the instruction presented two trials before (n = 2). Behavioral analysis showed that increased mental workload provoked a decrease in piloting performance, i. e. participants tended to forgetthe correct instruction. On the physiological level, EEG/ERP measurements related to instructions showed that increased mental workload was accompanied by lower P 3 b amplitude. We assume that the lower P 3 b amplitude reflects the depletion of the cognitive resources allocated to the processing of the instructions.

Implemented through the European SESAR and the US American NextGen programmes, several new <b>air</b> <b>traffic</b> <b>control</b> and <b>communication</b> protocols are currently being rolled out that have been in the works for decades.

After analysing how the changing technological environment affects the security of aviation technologies, current and future, we discuss the reasons preventing the aviation industry from quickly improving the security of its wireless protocols. Among these reasons, we identify the existing tradition of the industry, the prevalence of legacy hard-and software, major cost pressures, slow development cycles, and a narrow focus on safety (as opposed to security).

While the ‘maximum s–t-flow over time’ problem can be solved efficiently and ‘min-cost flows over time’ are known to be NP-hard, the complexity of (fractional) ‘multicommodity flows over time’ has been open for many years.

To identify a speaking aircraft, pilots have to start all verbal communications with the aircraft call sign. For automatic identification, it is desirable to transmit additional hidden aircraft identification data in time with this voice message over the VHF channel. That means the additional digital data has to be embedded into the speech signal. Such watermarking systems are used e. g. for CD-audio copyright protection, where copyright data is embedded into the music without any audible distortion. A system for speech watermarking in an <b>air</b> <b>traffic</b> <b>control</b> environment is developed. The system uses spread spectrum technology with linear pre-diction for spectral shaping of the watermark to achieve perceptual hiding. Error control coding is done using the BCH-code, which can both detect and correct errors. Results show that, for 12 bits/s, the watermark can be transmitted at a level which is hardly audible with very low error rate (0 : 1 %).

Examples in air transportation include the impact on <b>air</b> <b>traffic</b> safety by new <b>air</b> <b>traffic</b> <b>control</b> techniques such as time-based spacing, the impact on airport capacity or airline business by policies restricting airport noise, the propagation of delays through the air transportation network, or the consequences that multiple actors can have when coordinating together. The Tenerife airport disaster for instance resulted from an interruption of routines among aircraft crew and <b>air</b> <b>traffic</b> <b>control,</b> loss of <b>communication</b> accuracy, and low visibility conditions (Weick 1990). At the same time, one {{should be aware of the}} fact that current aviation also works thanks to the explicit use of emergent behavior for the better. Examples of this are the various control loops that are working in current ATM, within each aircraft itself and also those formed by the interplay between the aircraft crew and each ATM center on its path. And there is no doubt that the role of control loops will only increase for advanced ATM. Logically, one should expect that emergent behavior that is not well understood is often characterized by poor performance, missed opportunities, and the inability to quickly adapt to disturbances. Only once emergent behavior is well understood, it may be exploited for the better.|$|R

The growth of this potential industry {{has not yet been}} realized {{due to the lack of}} a common understanding of what is required to safely operate UAS in the National Airspace System (NAS). To address this deficiency, NASA has established a project called UAS Integration in the NAS (UAS in the NAS), under the Integrated Systems Research Program (ISRP) of the Aeronautics Research Mission Directorate (ARMD). This project provides an opportunity to transition concepts, technology, algorithms, and knowledge to the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and other stakeholders to help them define the requirements, regulations, and issues for routine UAS access to the NAS. The safe, routine, and efficient integration of UAS into the NAS requires new radio frequency (RF) spectrum allocations and a new data communications system which is both secure and scalable with increasing UAS traffic without adversely impacting the <b>Air</b> <b>Traffic</b> <b>Control</b> (ATC) <b>communication</b> system. These data communications, referred to as Control and Non-Payload Communications (CNPC), whose purpose is to exchange information between the unmanned aircraft and the ground control station to ensure safe, reliable, and effective unmanned aircraft flight operation. A Communications Subproject within the UAS in the NAS Project has been established to address issues related to CNPC development, certification and fielding. The focus of the Communications Subproject is on validating and allocating new RF spectrum and data link communications to enable civil UAS integration into the NAS. The goal is to validate secure, robust data links within the allocated frequency spectrum for UAS.

40|$|Interruptions in time-critical, dynamic, and {{collaborative}} environments, such as <b>air</b> <b>traffic</b> <b>control</b> (ATC), can provide valuable, task-relevant information. However, they also negatively impact task performance by distracting the operator from on-going tasks and consuming attention resources. This thesis develops and assesses {{a tool to}} assist radar <b>air</b> <b>traffic</b> controllers in managing interruptions. Field observations and interviews with <b>air</b> <b>traffic</b> controllers were utilized to {{develop an understanding of}} how interruptions occur in real ATC environments, and to identify where opportunities exist to use technology to support the interruption management process. It was identified that operators in these environments could better manage the effects of interruptions if there were indications to one operator of the availability of a collaborator and the urgency of an interruption from a collaborator. Present communication systems do not facilitate the awareness of these functionalities. An initial prototype for providing these functionalities in operational ATC displays was designed. Feedback on the prototypes was solicited through Participatory Design (PD) sessions with <b>air</b> <b>traffic</b> controllers. Based on the refinement of these prototypes, the Working Awareness Interruption Tool (WAIT) was developed to support more efficient and appropriate interruption timing in the context of complex, real-time, distributed, human operator interactions. Variations of the tool demonstrated several ways of showing the availability of the controller to be interrupted (either through manual settings or automatic detection) as well as incorporating a means of conveying the urgency level of the interruption. In order to examine the utility of the tool and to assess the importance and validity of its features, an experiment was conducted in a laboratory-based setting. The results of the experiment show the potential of this tool in an environment representative of <b>air</b> <b>traffic</b> <b>control</b> tasks and <b>communication.</b> Although the sample size was limited, the WAIT facilitated improved performance on both objective measures and self-reported measures, and reduced the distraction effects of interruptions from other operators. These improvements occurred without affecting perceptions of the effectiveness of communications. Questionnaire and interview results showed that participants appear to prefer an automated setting of availability to be shown to other collaborators. Identifying two examples of key features supporting interruption management (communicating availability and urgency) in <b>air</b> <b>traffic</b> <b>control</b> {{is one of the key}} contributions of this work.

40|$|Hybrid systems now form a {{classical}} computational paradigm unifying discrete and continuous system aspects. The modelling, analysis and verification {{of these systems}} are very difficult. One {{way to reduce the}} complexity of hybrid system models is to consider randomization. The need for stochastic models has actually multiple motivations. Usually, when building models complete information is not available and we have to consider stochastic versions. Moreover, non-determinism and uncertainty are inherent to complex systems. The stochastic approach {{can be thought of as}} a way of quantifying non-determinism (by assigning a probability to each possible execution branch) and managing uncertainty. This is built upon to the - now classical - approach in algorithmics that provides polynomial complexity algorithms via randomization. In this thesis we investigate the stochastic hybrid systems, focused on modelling and analysis. We propose a powerful unifying paradigm that combines analytical and formal methods. Its applications vary from <b>air</b> <b>traffic</b> <b>control</b> to <b>communication</b> networks and healthcare systems. The stochastic hybrid system paradigm has an explosive development. This is because of its very powerful expressivity and the great variety of possible applications. Each hybrid system model can be randomized in different ways, giving rise to many classes of stochastic hybrid systems. Moreover, randomization can change profoundly the mathematical properties of discrete and continuous aspects and also can influence their interaction. Beyond the profound foundational and semantics issues, there is the possibility to combine and cross-fertilize techniques from analytic mathematics (like optimization, control, adaptivity, stability, existence and uniqueness of trajectories, sensitivity analysis) and formal methods (like bisimulation, specification, reachability analysis, model checking). These constitute the major motivations of our research. We investigate new models of stochastic hybrid systems and their associated problems. The main difference from the existing approaches is that we do not follow one way (based only on continuous or discrete mathematics), but their cross-fertilization. For stochastic hybrid systems we introduce concepts that have been defined only for discrete transition systems. Then, techniques that have been used in discrete automata now come in a new analytical fashion. This is partly explained by the fact that popular verification methods (like theorem proving) can hardly work even on probabilistic extensions of discrete systems. When the continuous dimension is added, the idea to use continuous mathematics methods for verification purposes comes in a natural way. The concrete contribution of this thesis has four major milestones: 1. A new and a very general model for stochastic hybrid systems; 2. Stochastic reachability for stochastic hybrid systems is introduced together with an approximating method to compute reach set probabilities; 3. Bisimulation for stochastic hybrid systems is introduced and relationship with reachability analysis is investigated. 4. Considering the communication issue, we extend the modelling paradigm.

This {{stems from the fact that}} ATM, when being addressed as a system of systems, not only gives attention to threat sources like those well-known from the cyber security area, but also to ATM specific sources like e. g. satellite <b>communication</b> or <b>Air</b> <b>Traffic</b> <b>Control</b> (ATC) radio <b>communication.</b> In order to establish security management tools in the ATM domain the Global ATM Security Management Project (GAMMA) started in 2013. The main goal of the project is to develop ideas to solve emerging <b>air</b> <b>traffic</b> management vulnerabilities. This intention is backed up by practical proposals for implementation. The paper will discuss a subset of the GAMMA project outcomes. This will especially deal with the Secure ATC Communications Prototype (SACom). The prototype will be used as an example to enrich the theoretical presented background with a more tangible contribution. Although the project is still on its way there have already been some first insights into the validation phase as several rehearsals already took place. These insights will be described in more detail in the paper. Furthermore the theoretically delivered security prototype validation approach will be mapped to the prototype at hand. The obtained results will be presented and a discussion of the first validation results will be executed. This paper therefore describes as well the postulated security prototype validation methodology as the application of the described methodology on a dedicated prototype for secure ATC voice communication. This may be used as the blueprint for validating other ATM security oriented systems...|$|R
40|$|The <b>air</b> <b>traffic</b> <b>control</b> {{industry}} in Europe is under mounting pressure due to increasing <b>air</b> <b>traffic</b> and inefficient routines {{caused by a}} fragmented air space. In order to handle the demands the European Commission has launched a program entitled the Single European Sky initiative which seeks to promote a more efficient way of handling the <b>air</b> <b>traffic</b> over Europe. A reorganization of <b>air</b> <b>traffic</b> management will be introduced during this process and <b>air</b> <b>traffic</b> <b>control</b> centers in Europe will be merged. New tech-nology will further be implemented and the air space will be rationalized. In this context the Swedish <b>air</b> <b>traffic</b> <b>control</b> provider is an interesting case since an adaptation to increasing <b>air</b> <b>traffic</b> and the Single European Sky initiative has already begun through {{the introduction of new}} organizational structures and new technology. As psycho-organizational aspects can be identified as affecting safety out-comes in high risk organizations with highly reliable operations, the overall aim of the research presented in this thesis was to study different psycho-organizational aspects in Swedish <b>air</b> <b>traffic</b> <b>control</b> during times of change. The studies on which this thesis is based focused on: innovative organizational climate, examining the innovative preparedness and capacity to cope with changes in a highly regulated organizational environment; situational leader-ship, examining leadership characteristics in a high risk organization with a well developed safety culture; psychosocial work environment, examining critical psychosocial environmental factors in a high risk organization with de-manding work operations; and safety culture, examining perceptions of safety culture as well as the relationships between safety culture aspects and or-ganizational climate dimensions. All in all, five studies were conducted of which four were empirical. The empirical studies were all conducted at two <b>air</b> <b>traffic</b> <b>control</b> centers and an administrative <b>air</b> <b>traffic</b> services (ANS) unit which was part of the LFV Group Swedish Airports and Air Navigation Services. The three study loca-tions employed 635 <b>air</b> <b>traffic</b> controllers and other staff members. The or-ganizational climate was measured with the Creative Climate Questionnaire (CCQ) (Ekvall, 1990), the situational leadership with the Leader Effectiveness and Adaptability Description (LEAD) (Hersey & Blanchard, 1988; Holmkvist, 2000), the psychosocial work environment with the Copenhagen Psychosocial Questionnaire (COPSOQ) (Kristensen, Hannerz, Høgh & Borg, 2005), and the safety culture with the safety culture assessment questionnaire devel-oped by Ek (2006). Study I concluded that the existing empirical research concerning relation-ships between organizational climate, leadership and safety culture or safety climate is limited. Previous research supports the assumption that safety culture is related to other psycho-organizational aspects, but the knowledge base is still too limited to be conclusive. The ambiguity in defining and op-erationalizing the concepts is an additional weakness in the field. It was further assumed that the innovative organizational climate would be under-developed in <b>air</b> <b>traffic</b> <b>control</b> due to the strict regulatory framework which is present in this environment. The results from Study II revealed, however, that the innovative organizational climate was quite positive in spite of the rule governed work. Differences in the assessment of the inno-vative organizational climate could be identified according to work charac-teristics and work tasks but not according to organizational position. Study III concluded that the situational leadership characteristics differed according to situation. The leadership behavior was more relationship-oriented in Success and Group situations compared with Hardship and Individual situations. The leadership adaptability ? the leader's ability to adjust leader-ship style according to the situation ? was superior in Success and Individual situations than in Hardship and Group situations. Operational conditions, lead-ership structures and working tasks were, on the other hand, not associated with leadership behavior. Three aspects of the psychosocial work environment were identified as dif-ficult in <b>air</b> <b>traffic</b> <b>control</b> in Study IV. In an otherwise positive assessment, Sensorial demands, Freedom and Feedback were challenging aspects. These as-pects seemed to be characteristic for operative <b>air</b> <b>traffic</b> <b>control</b> work since the operative personnel assessed them to be statistically significantly less positive than did the administrative personnel. Organizational position was also found to be influential in the assessment of psychosocial work envi-ronmental factors since the management group made more positive as-sessments on a number of dimensions. The effect of differences in opera-tional conditions was, however, limited. The safety culture was positively assessed in the Swedish <b>air</b> <b>traffic</b> <b>control</b> context according to Study V. The administrative ANS unit had generally somewhat lower scores than the two operative <b>air</b> <b>traffic</b> <b>control</b> centers. Overall, <b>Communication,</b> Justness and Flexibility received slightly lower scores {{than the rest of the}} safety culture aspects. The results further demonstrated that the two organizational climate dimensions, Support for ideas and Conflicts, were positively and most frequently related to the various safety culture as-pects at the two <b>air</b> <b>traffic</b> <b>control</b> centers. However, few relationships were found between the safety culture and organizational climate concepts at the administrative ANS unit. Because of the limited knowledge concerning the influence of organiza-tional aspects on safety and their possible relationships with safety culture and safety climate, more research in this area is desired, especially in the field of <b>air</b> <b>traffic</b> <b>control.</b> Due to differences in national conditions and culture as well as local variations, studies similar to those conducted in Sweden are also needed in other European countries in order to make the transition to the Single European Sky as smooth, safe and efficient as pos-sible...|$|R
