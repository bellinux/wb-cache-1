Although he can shield {{his eyes from the}} sun, {{he does not want to}} do that because it means he would be also shielding his eyes from his lover.

The speaker proceeds to reprimand the sun and tells it to set, come back the next day, and tell him [...] "whether both th' Indias of spice and mine be where thou lefst them, or lie here with me" [...] (lines 16-18). He wants the sun to tell him if all the kings, queens, riches and gold of the world <b>are</b> <b>still</b> <b>out</b> <b>there</b> or lying in bed next to him. Towards the end of the stanza the speaker confirms, [...] "Ask for those kings whom thou saw'st yesterday, and thou shalt hear, All here in one bed lay" [...] (lines 19-20), that his lover is above all kings and beside him in bed are all the riches and gold that he could ever want.|$|E
5000|$|By {{the end of}} George V's reign the threepence {{had become}} unpopular in England because of its small size (George Orwell {{comments}} on this in Keep the Aspidistra Flying), but it remained popular in Scotland. It was consequently decided to introduce a more substantial threepenny coin which would have a more convenient weight/value ratio than the silver coinage. The silver threepence continued to be minted, as {{there may have been}} some uncertainty about how well the new coin would be accepted. The Edward VIII era saw the planned introduction of a new, larger, nickel-brass (79% copper, 20% zinc, 1% nickel) twelve-sided threepence coin. This coin weighed 6.6 grams and the diameter was 21 mm across the sides and 22 mm across the corners. The obverse shows a left-facing effigy of the king (not right as would have been the convention to alternate the direction) with the inscription , and the reverse shows a three-headed thrift plant with the inscription [...] A total of just 12 of these coins were struck for experimental purposes and sent to a slot machine manufacturing company for testing. The whereabouts of six of those 12 are known. However, the other six <b>are</b> <b>still</b> <b>out</b> <b>there</b> somewhere and, as such, they are extremely rare today. An example was sold at auction in 2013 for £30,000 [...] There are two types of Edward VIII brass threepences.

5000|$|In {{an article}} in the Blackpool Gazette, Jacqui Morley wrote about the film {{restoration}} by Eurwyn Jones: [...] Eurwyn sees Hylda's film She Knows Y'Know as one of the holy grails of British comedy. [...] "We've lost so much over the years and I'm convinced many <b>are</b> <b>still</b> <b>out</b> <b>there.</b> You have to know where to look. Jean tried the BFI, but the film wasn't in good condition so I put feelers out as a past film collector and went, let us say, to see a man about a dog! I found the film in immaculate condition. Nobody had watched it for half a century. It was a really good feeling, and I couldn't wait to see it."He negotiated use of the print, tracked down copyright holders to ensure it could be shared with fans across the world, and teamed up with Renown Pictures, who restore classic movies, putting the print through modern technology to present a crystal clear picture quality and sound. She Knows Y'Know is now out on DVD.Eurwyn concludes: [...] "Hylda was one of the funniest women ever. All those hours I've spent tracking down this early example of her talent have been worth it, and the digital transfer results are brilliant. The film shows she was not only a brilliant comedienne, but an actress of great note, too, which she later proved in films such as Up the Junction and Oliver! ...|$|E

This {{is one of the}} most heated debates in biology. Discounting microbes, plausible estimates range from about half a million to more than 50 million species of unknown animals, plants and fungi. This biodiversity matters because it could be used to fight human diseases, produce new crops, and offer innovations to help solve the world's problems. Why is there so much uncertainty in the numbers? The biggest reason, I argue, is that a lot of biodiversity is surprisingly hard to find or identify. This has profound implications for nature conservation and for our understanding of life on Earth...|$|E

40|$|Rather infamously, Kit Fine {{provided}} {{a series of}} counter-examples which purport {{to show that the}} modalist program of analysing essence in terms of metaphysical necessity is fundamentally misguided. Several would-be modalists have since responded, attempting to save the position from this Finean Challenge. This paper evaluates and rejects a trio of such responses, from Della Rocca, Zalta, and Gorman. But I’m not here arguing for Fine’s conclusion – ultimately, this is a fight amongst friends, with Della Rocca, Zalta, Gorman, and I all wanting to be modalists, but disagreeing on the details. As such, while my primary aim is to show what’s wrong with this trio, the secondary aim is demonstrating how what’s right about them in fact pushes one towards my own sparse modalist account. So while the primary conclusion of this paper is negative, the secondary, positive, conclusion is that modalists shouldn’t give up hope – plausible responses to Fine <b>are</b> <b>still</b> <b>out</b> <b>there...</b>|$|E

" It goes on to note that these "Community newspapers, often but not always published weekly, also tend to cover subjects larger news media do not, such as students on the honor roll at the local high school, school sports, crimes such as vandalism, zoning issues and other details of community life. Sometimes dismissed as "chicken dinner" stories, such 'hyperlocal' coverage often plays a vital role in building and maintaining neighborhoods.
