A morpho-functional criterion, based on holorganic layers thickness and A horizon properties, was used to classify humus forms, which ranged from Dysmoder to Eumull. Such variability allowed understanding of factors influencing organic matter storage. The relations between carbon stock and humus form were investigated for the topsoil layer (0 – 20 cm), which was supposed to contain the soil C pools most sensitive to climate change. We found that humus forms can be grouped in statistically different populations, with respect to topsoil C stocks.

In this study we report the results of three years of monitoring of soil enzyme activity and plant species compositional patterns. Monthly soil samples were taken each year between June and September from four sites on the hill and from two standing reference forests using three replicate plots. Activities of 10 different enzymes, soil organic matter (SOM) content, moisture, pH and temperature of the surface layer were monitored. Abundances of vascular plant species were surveyed on the same four hill sites between late May and early September, three times a season in 2004 and 2005. Although the addition of organic soil considerably increased soil enzyme activities (per dw), the activities at the covered hill sites were far lower than in the reference forests. Temporal changes and differences between sites were analysed in more detail per soil organic matter (SOM) in order to reveal differences in the quality of SOM. All the sites had a characteristic enzyme activity pattern and two hill sites showed clear temporal changes. The enzyme activities in uncovered topsoil increased, whereas the activities at the covered Middle site decreased, when compared with other sites at the same time. The different trend between Middle and North sites in enzyme activities may reflect differences in humus material transferred to these sites, but difference in the succession of vegetation affects enzyme activities strongly. Middle yielded higher β-sitosterol content in 2004, as an indication of more intense plant impact. All reclaimed sites had characteristic plant species assemblages and parallel temporal changes, reflecting vegetation succession, occurred across all the sites. Rapid growth of vegetation on the covered sites restored the rhizosphere and contributed to the persistence of microbial activity.

40|$|Boreal forest {{ecosystems}} constitute a globally important carbon (C) sink, due to accumulation of complex organic matter, persistent to decomposition. Nitrogen (N) is immobilized in these complex compounds and, thereby, unavailable {{to the plant}} community. Fungal peroxidases (ClassII) are oxidative enzymes, predominantly studied in white-rot wood decomposers and known to efficiently mineralize phenolic complexes, such as lignin, to CO 2. Peroxidase activity is also commonly measured in forest soil, where typical white-rotters are absent and ectomycorrhizal fungi predominate. Peroxidase activity is known to increases under low inorganic N availability. The {{aim of this study}} was to explore the ectomycorrhizal decomposer potential in boreal {{forest ecosystems}}. The central hypothesis is that ectomycorrhizal fungi produce ClassII peroxidases to mobilize N, bound to phenolic complexes in boreal <b>forest</b> litter and <b>humus.</b> Genes coding for ClassII peroxidases were found to be widely spread among ectomycorrhizal taxa, particularly within the genus of Cortinarius. Gene transcription of peroxidases in <b>forest</b> <b>humus</b> could be linked directly to the species Cortinarius semisanguineus. In a field experiment, colorimetric enzyme assays showed a halving of peroxidase activity in short-term response to N-amendment. In non-treated control samples, Cortinarius species and other rhizomorph forming ectomycorrhizal fungi were co-localized with peroxidase activity hotspots. Ectomycorrhizal Cortinarius species may, thus, be key players in N-acquisition, from organic macromolecules, and central decomposers of complex organic matter in boreal forest ecosystems. Root-associated fungi, including ectomycorrhizal ones, were able to compete with free-living saprotrophs for colonization of litter. However, they were less efficient decomposers than specialized litter saprotrophs. It is concluded that some mycorrhizal fungi may release C while foraging for N. They may also indirectly act to preserve soil C by suppressing more efficient saprotrophic decomposers. The findings highlight ectomycorrhizal fungi as central regulators of C dynamics in boreal forests. Ectomycorrhizal symbiosis, thus, constitutes a direct link between above-ground photosynthesis and below-ground decomposition...|$|R

40|$|Ectomycorrhizal fungi {{dominate}} the humus layers of boreal forests. They depend on carbohydrates that are translocated through roots, via fungal mycelium to microsites in the soil, wherein they forage for nutrients. Mycorrhizal fungi are therefore sensitive to disruptive disturbances that may restrict their carbon supply. By disrupting root connections, we induced a sudden decline in mycorrhizal mycelial abundance {{and studied the}} consequent effects on growth and activity of free living, saprotrophic fungi and bacteria in pine <b>forest</b> <b>humus,</b> using molecular community analyses in combination with enzyme activity measurements. Ectomycorrhizal fungi had decreased in abundance 14 days after root severing, but the abundance of certain free-living ascomycetes was three times higher within 5 days of the disturbance compared with undisturbed controls. Root disruption also increased laccase production by {{an order of magnitude}} and cellulase production by a factor of 5. In contrast, bacterial populations seemed little affected. The results indicate that access to an external carbon source enables mycorrhizal fungi to monopolise the humus, but disturbances may induce rapid growth of opportunistic saprotrophic fungi that presumably use the dying mycorrhizal mycelium. Studies of such functional shifts in fungal communities, induced by disturbance, may shed light on mechanisms behind nutrient retention and release in boreal forests. The results also highlight the fundamental problems associated with methods that study microbial processes in soil samples that have been isolated from living roots. ...|$|R

At the end of 130 days after sowing were compared the patterns of development of girth, height and relation height / girth in a randomized block design consisting of 4 treatments and 4 replicates, each replicate consisting of 16 seedlings. Results were subjected to analysis of variance (ANOVA) and the averages compared by Tukey (5 %). The values ​​ obtained to girth not differ, presented as overall mean 5. 08 mm, however in relation to height cultivar 215 (31 cm) excelled on the cultivar 174 (25 cm) and control (23 cm), however their average not differ of material 186 (27 cm). As regards the height / girth the values ​​ obtained for the control and cultivars 175, 186 and 215, were respectively, 4. 6, 5. 2, 5. 1 and 5. 9 cm / mm, being cultivar 215 different to control. </p...|$|R
40|$|Intensively used forest {{nurseries}} are characterised by degradation {{processes that}} lead to {{a drop in the}} quality of seedlings. The main reason of this problem is a decrease in biological soil diversity. Therefore, an attempt of nursery soil enrichment by introducing ectohumus – as compost and fresh litter – from the pine forest was carried out. The research was carried out in 2009 – 2011 in the Bielawy forest nursery near the city of Toruń, Poland. The objective {{of the study was to}} determine the impact of organic fertilisation (compost made up of <b>forest</b> <b>humus)</b> and mulching using fresh ectohumus on the density and community composition of Acari mites and on species composition of oribatid mites (Oribatida) in the nurseries of silver birch and Scots pine. Mites, especially oribatid mites, were treated as bioindicators of soil biological activity. Research has shown that mulching using fresh ectohumus caused a multiple increase in the density of mites, especially in saprophagous mites Oribatida. Oribatid mites were clearly more numerous in birch cultivation than in that of pine. Overall, 27 species of oribatid mites were found. Mulching resulted in a significant growth in species diversity in both cultivations. The most numerous oribatid mite in the area under the study was Oribatula tibialis. This species was present in all plots and showed clear preference for birch cultivation. Tectocepheus velatus and Oppiella nova, common and known to be present in a variety of environments, were slightly less numerous. Przemysław Szmi...|$|R
