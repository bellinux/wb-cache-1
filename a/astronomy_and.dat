5|$|Amateur astronomers {{continue}} to make scientific contributions {{to the field of}} <b>astronomy</b> <b>and</b> {{it is one of the}} few scientific disciplines where amateurs can still make significant contributions. Amateurs can make occultation measurements that are used to refine the orbits of minor planets. They can also discover comets, and perform regular observations of variable stars. Improvements in digital technology have allowed amateurs to make impressive advances in the field of astrophotography.|$|E
5|$|<b>Astronomy</b> <b>and</b> {{astrophysics}} {{have developed}} significant interdisciplinary links with other major scientific fields. Archaeoastronomy {{is the study}} of ancient or traditional astronomies in their cultural context, utilizing archaeological and anthropological evidence. Astrobiology {{is the study of}} the advent and evolution of biological systems in the Universe, with particular emphasis on the possibility of non-terrestrial life. Astrostatistics is the application of statistics to astrophysics to the analysis of vast amount of observational astrophysical data.|$|E
5|$|Astronomy {{is one of}} {{the oldest}} of the natural sciences. The early civilizations in {{recorded}} history, such as the Babylonians, Greeks, Indians, Egyptians, Nubians, Iranians, Chinese, Maya, and many ancient Indigenous Peoples of The Americas performed methodical observations of the night sky. Historically, astronomy has included disciplines as diverse as astrometry, celestial navigation, observational <b>astronomy</b> <b>and</b> the making of calendars, but professional astronomy is now often considered to be synonymous with astrophysics.|$|E
