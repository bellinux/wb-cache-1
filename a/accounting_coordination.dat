40|$|Background: The {{management}} <b>accounting</b> <b>coordination</b> in {{a horizontal}} network {{of small and}} medium sized companies entails numerous questions and potential complications that may {{vary according to the}} extent of cooperation chosen. Categorizing network co-operations along an imaginary market–hierarchy continuum might offer the theoretical foundation needed to further understand networks and as a consequence illuminate the link to the diverse management accounting issues. Purpose: To analyze the management accounting systems in different forms of horizontal network co-operations. Delimitations: It is not within the purpose of the thesis to discuss the various reasons why cooperative relationships are established in the first place, nor how they develop. Proceed of the study: A multiple case study of three Swedish networks composed of small/medium-sized firms was carried out with the help of thirteen interviews. Conclusions: Empirical support is offered for both the business and functional network types. The model of Dahlgren et al. {{does not take into account}} that the degree of integration of the network supporting activities does not necessarily have to entail the equivalent degree of integration regarding the management accounting system. Hence, the typology of networks cannot be said to be conveniently applicable to study all horizontal networks, as the model may leave out certain significant dimensions that obstruct the understanding of a network...|$|E

This paper introduces inconvenience to the general problem of appliance scheduling.

A nonlinear integer optimization problem is formulated taking into <b>account</b> appliance <b>coordination</b> constraints and is solved with genetic algorithm. The results show that by optimally scheduling appliances taking into <b>account</b> <b>coordination,</b> a cost saving is achieved through load shifting and curtailment whereby an incentive is earned.

40|$|In {{the context}} of {{cooperative}} work, the coordination of activities is provided essentially by two opposite classes of approaches, based {{on the notion of}} situated action and planning. Actually, given the complexity and dynamism of current cooperative scenarios, the need of model supporting both the approaches has emerged. A similar situation can be recognised in multiagent system coordination, where two classes of approaches are clearly distinguishable, with properties similar to the situated action and planning cases: the one, defined in literature as subjective <b>coordination,</b> <b>accounts</b> for realising <b>coordination</b> exclusively by means of the skills and the situated actions of the individual agents, exploiting their intelligence and communication capability. Among the other properties, these approaches promote autonomy, flexibility and intelligence in coordination processes. The other, defined in literature as objective <b>coordination,</b> <b>accounts</b> for realising <b>coordination</b> exploiting coordination media, which mediate agent interactions and govern them according to laws which reflect social goals and norms. Among the other properties, these approaches promote automation, efficiency, and prescriptiveness in coordination processes. In this work, the importance to support both approaches in the same coordination context is remarked, and a conceptual framework [...] derived from Activity Theory [...] is proposed, where both approaches effectively co-exist and work at different collaborative levels, exploiting both the flexibility and intelligence of the subjective approaches, and the prescription and automation of the objective ones...|$|R
40|$|This article {{challenges}} the interpretations concerning participation by Brazilian legislators {{in the budget}} process focused on incentives generated by the electoral legislation. We show that {{the rules and regulations}} governing the budget process affect the distribution of funds both between branches of government and within the legislative branch itself. Constitutional and legal rules preserve the original proposal submitted by the Executive. Within Congress, the bylaws favor collective participation of members, for example, by way of submission of amendments by State representations. We further show that participation by the legislative branch in the budget process can only be understood when the political parties are taken into <b>account.</b> <b>Coordination</b> of efforts by the political parties thus ends up grouping them in two major blocs, pro-administration and opposition. In other words, partisan participation in the budget process depends on the parties' relations with the Executive.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} an approach useful to analyse {{the performance of}} the product development model adopted by an organisation. A dynamic information management perspective of the development process was assumed while the nature of the information and knowledge flows exchanged to coordinate tasks was the primary focus of this study. In particular, the effect of information and knowledge flows ambiguity was taken into <b>account.</b> <b>Coordination</b> between tasks was modelled by using the Design Structure Matrix (DSM) tool. The dynamic behaviour of the Product Development Process (PDP) and the evolution of information and knowledge quality at the interface between tasks was foresighted through simulation. System dynamics was used as a modelling framework. This approach was implemented to analyse a specific subsystem – ‘the climatic system’ – of a new car model recently developed by a large Italian car manufacturer. Data were collected by administrating a questionnaire to technical managers and engineers involved in the development process of the subsystem. Continuous interaction and feedback from them was useful to build the process model simulated in our study and to test scales to measure model variables developed for the purpose {{in the first part of}} the study and discuss the simulation outcome and possible organisational solutions to correct bad performance...|$|R

The goal {{of this research is}} to give a formal <b>account</b> of language <b>coordination</b> in dialogue, and semantic <b>coordination</b> in particular. <b>Accounting</b> for semantic <b>coordination</b> requires (1) a semantics, i. e. an architecture allowing for dynamic meanings and meaning updates as results of dialogue moves, and (2) a pragmatics, describing the dialogue moves involved in semantic coordination. We illustrate the general approach by applying it to some examples from the literature on corrective feedback, and provide a fairly detailed discussion of one example using TTR (Type Theory with Records) to formalize concepts. TTR provides an analysis of linguistic content which is structured in order to allow modification and similarity metrics, and a framework for describing dialogue moves and resulting updates to linguistic resources. ...|$|R

The resulting system is sufficiently restricted in cases where other approaches overgenerate; the very property of resourcesensitivity for which resource sharing appears to be problematic actually provides explanatory advantages over systems that more freely replicate resources during derivation...|$|R

40|$|Background. The {{number of}} elderly patients, i. e. people over 64 years, is growing. With longer life span the {{proportion}} of elderly people will be even higher. Elderly patients are a heterogeneous group of patients with considerable differences in health status, functional capacity, emotions, fears, beliefs and views. Health care of elderly patients in primary care is a responsibility of family doctors. One third of all family practice consultations are in the age group over 64.  A consultation in the elderly is different from a consultation in younger patients. The consultation length in those patients is longer and the office visits of elderly are more frequent. If we want to deliver a quality care for the elderly, we have {{to care for them}} and manage their illness in psychological, physical, family and social context, which is a core stone of biopsychosocial model of medical practice. Besides medical knowledge and patient participation, all these elements make a foundation of the holistic approach.

In the process of capturing the constraints, new DOM lists are added and an existing DOM list is divided into two DOM lists depending on the feature of elements in each domain. Furthermore, new features SEP and INC are introduced. SEP is used for distinguishing prepositions which should be located in the same domain with the following NPs from those which can be separated from the following NPs. INC feature determines whether overlapping adverbs are in non-empty lists or not. Pseudogapping occurs not only in coordination structures, but in comparative or subordination structures.

40|$|Abstract — Agent-based {{middleware}} platforms for {{wireless sensor networks}} (WSNs) {{have received}} a lot of attention during the last years, due to their great flexibility in re-programming, monitoring, handling, and optimizing the application as well as the whole system. Even though many algorithms have been proposed for the dynamic placement of agents within the WSN, they do not take into <b>account</b> the <b>coordination</b> aspects of such migrations. This not only may result in slow convergence but also in perpetual oscillations of agent migrations, degrading application and system performance. In this paper, we propose full-coordination, semi-coordination, and non-coordination agent migration strategies, and evaluate their convergence and network overhead. We also provide proofs that convergence is guaranteed when dynamic agent placement algorithms adopt our proposed strategies. Our results show that the semi-coordination strategy is superior in terms of both network overhead and convergence rate.

40|$|What <b>accounts</b> for <b>coordination</b> problems? Many {{mechanisms}} of coordination exist in both organizations and networks, yet despite their widespread use, coordination challenges persist. Some believe the challenges are growing even more serious. One {{answer lies in}} understanding that coordination is not a free good; it is expensive in terms of time, effort, and attention, or what economists call transaction and administrative costs. An alternative to improving coordination is to reduce its costs, yet there is little guidance in the literature to help managers and researchers calculate coordination costs or make design decisions based on cost reductions. This article explores two cases—the U. S. Patent and Trademark Office’s Peer-to-Patent pilot program and the online relief effort in Haiti following the devastating earthquake there in 2010 —to illustrate the advantages and constraints of using Web 2. 0 technology as a mechanism of coordination and a tool for cost reduction.
