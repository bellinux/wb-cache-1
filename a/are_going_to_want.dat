He was on the balcony where this elderly woman was serving boiled shrimp. Coach Dodd said, ‘Y”know, if you tell that lady her hair looks nice, you’re {{not going to run}} out of boiled shrimp all night, and what’ve you done? Something honest, fair and nice.

5000|$|There {{have been}} {{allegations}} of some universities (such as Kingston University) advising students to artificially inflate the scores they give {{in the survey}} {{in the interest of}} improving the university's status in rankings derived from it. One lecturer told his students to give Kingston good scores because [...] "if Kingston comes bottom ... no one <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> employ you because they'll think your degree is shit". [...] Following an investigation of the allegations, the Higher Education Funding Council of England (HEFCE) ordered that Kingston University's Department of Psychology be removed from the 2008-09 League Tables.|$|R

50|$|Haggling, {{otherwise}} known as bargaining, is most present in businesses where items have no fixed price. Sellers will often price the item higher than they want to sell it, knowing that buyers <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>want</b> to negotiate the price.

5000|$|Most {{of these}} were for the CS300 model. The first CS100 was {{expected}} to be flying by mid-2016 in Lufthansa colours. “Certification is a great thing, but 2016 is going to be critical for orders,” analyst Chris Murray, aManaging Director with Alta Corp, told Bloomberg Business. Fred Cromer, president of Bombardier’s commercial aircraft unit hinted during a press conference on 21 December 2015 that price cuts - or other incentives - may be offered during negotiations in order to jump start sales (list price for the CS100 was US$71.8 million and for the CS300 US$82 million). In addition to attractive prices, customers “are going to want support, they <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>want</b> spares, they <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>want</b> training,” he explained. While Cromer would not offer specifics, his comments about the possibility of an [...] "aggressive deal" [...] were widely published worldwide and were likely to plant the seed about discounting in the minds of potential purchasers.|$|E
2500|$|Browne {{has denied}} the deadly rampage {{was caused by}} alcohol {{intoxication}} or marital problems and said Bales was [...] "reluctant to serve." [...] According to Browne, Bales did not <b>want</b> <b>to</b> return to the front lines. Browne said, [...] "He wasn't thrilled about going on another deployment ... {{he was told he}} wasn't going back, and then he was told he was going."

5000|$|On November 11, 2015, it was {{announced}} that Robin Swicord would direct a drama film based on the short story Wakefield by E. L. Doctorow, after the short story of the same name by Nathaniel Hawthorne. Bonnie Curtis and Julie Lynn would produce the film through Mockingbird Pictures, along with Elliott Webb as co-producer. Swicord had written the screenplay after meeting with Doctorow and discussing her ideas on how to present the story on film. She said, [...] "I had to really interrogate the story before I ever got up the courage to meet with Doctorow, because I knew he <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> know what kind of movie this <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be.</b> I met him and we had great conversations. We emailed and talked on the phone, and started the process of getting him to trust that we had all our ducks in a row." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{was before}} we were married, but not much before, and the picture {{was a sort of}} wedding present for my wife, though Blakey made a show of giving it to me. Said he had painted it for me, because he had a prophetic soul, and felt in his bones that I <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>want</b> a picture of the place where I first met her. You see, it's the little villa her mother had taken that winter on the Viale Petrarca, just outside of Florence. It was the first place I met her, but not the last." ...|$|R
5000|$|Throughout the film, {{original}} footage is seamlessly {{interspersed with}} the dramatisation. Richard Dimbleby is seen {{both in the}} drama and in the BBC report he gave in 1945. Johnston and Sington watch footage of a tractor scooping up corpses ready for burial, and Johnston tells Sington [...] "I don't think people <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>want</b> to see this." [...] But Sington disagrees. He tells Johnston [...] "I think people should see this." ...|$|E
5000|$|Contrasting {{with the}} dark lyrics of the song, the music, which was written first, is upbeat. Foster said, [...] "It's a 'fuck you' song to the hipsters in a way—but it's a song the hipsters <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>want</b> to dance to." [...] Jeffery Berg of Frontier Psychiatrist said, [...] "I was so engrossed with the cheery melody of its chorus that {{it took me a}} few listens to {{discover}} that the lyrics suggest dark, Columbine revenge." ...|$|E
5000|$|Ira Boudway {{observed}} in Bloomberg Business: The {{problem is that}} cutting the feed from the booth also means cutting down egos and cutting into advertising reach. If you're not hearing Tim McCarver recite the lyrics to Metallica's 'Enter Sandman', then you're not hearing Joe Buck tell you which beer brand is bringing you the game ... Going announcerless is akin to skipping commercials, and broadcasters and carriers <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>want</b> {{to find a way}} to replace the lost revenue.|$|E
500|$|In the {{run up to}} World Group {{play-off}} against Croatia, Tim Henman {{had announced}} he would retire after this match. Murray said [...] "I'm not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> let the team down or let Tim down, I'd feel terrible if I {{was the one that}} was responsible for losing Tim's last tie. This {{means a lot to me}} and it's definitely <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> the biggest Davis Cup match of my career." [...] "Everyone <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> win for Tim. I'm hoping the way I play will show him what his career meant to my development and me."

5000|$|... "I {{had a lot}} of {{trepidation}} {{about working}} with Sonny Rollins. This guy's a giant of the saxophone. Charlie said, 'He's never <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> play on a Rolling Stones record!' I said, 'Yes he <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>want</b> to.' And he did and he was wonderful. I said, 'Would you like me to stay out there in the studio?' He said, 'Yeah, you tell me where you <b>want</b> me <b>to</b> play and DANCE the part out.' So I did that. And that's very important: communication in hand, dance, whatever. You don't have to do a whole ballet, but sometimes that movement of the shoulder tells the guy to kick in on the beat." ...|$|R
5000|$|Allmusic critic Stephen Thomas Erlewine {{considered}} the song a highlight on Chesney's album, making note of how Strait and Chesney both [...] "playfully soften the F in the title, making for a genuinely funny highlight" [...] (thus making the line sound closer to [...] "shit work"). Brady Vercher of Engine 145 {{gave it a}} thumbs-down rating, saying [...] "What makes this a bad song is that it’s dull and boring, with zero redeeming qualities. If music is supposed {{to make you feel}} something, then this song captures the monotony of 'shiftwork,' but who in their right mind <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> bored when they listen to a song?" [...] Kevin John Coyne of Country Universe, gave it a [...] "B-", saying that [...] " [...] the ’big ol’ pile of shiiiiiftwork” wordplay in the chorus is funny. It doesn’t hold up much on repeated listenings, however" [...] and that the song [...] "still manages to become a song about getting drunk in the islands".|$|R

5000|$|On March 14, 2012 Browne {{took the}} case of Staff Sgt. Robert Bales, the U.S. soldier accused of murdering 16 Afghan {{citizens}} (mostly women and children) in an incident known as the Kandahar massacre. Browne defended Bales alongside military lawyers. Browne described Bales as [...] "mild-mannered", and claimed his client was upset after seeing a friend's leg blown off {{the day before the}} killings, but held no animosity toward Muslims. Browne said [...] "I think the message for the public in general is that he's one of our boys and they need to treat him fairly." [...] Browne also criticized anonymous reports from government officials, stating [...] "the government <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> blame this on an individual rather than blame it on the war." [...] In order to avoid the death penalty, Bales pleaded guilty to sixteen counts of murder and six counts of assault and attempted murder in a plea deal. On August 23, 2013, he was {{sentenced to life in prison}} without parole.|$|R
2500|$|Criticism {{has also}} been placed upon media outlets themselves, {{especially}} CNN.

No one <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>want</b> me now.'" [...] Candy Crowley and Paul Callan were also criticized for their lack of focus on the victim and their sympathy for the rapists.|$|R
5000|$|In 2013, while {{reporting}} on the conviction of two Steubenville, Ohio, high school football players for the rape of a 16-year-old, Harlow stated that it was [...] "incredibly difficult, even for an outsider like me, to watch what happened as these two young men that had such promising futures, star football players, very good students, literally watched as they believed their lives fell apart ... Richmond collapsed told his attorney, 'My life is over. No one <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>want</b> me now.'"

A petition requesting that CNN apologize on the air for sympathizing with the Steubenville rapists received over 250,000 signatures within two days of CNN's report.|$|R
5000|$|The preview track, [...] "The Eye", {{for which}} a video was {{released}} prior to the album, is a front-porch acoustic. The review from NPR Music said, [...] " [...] 'The Eye' is exactly what it proclaims itself to be: a quiet breath {{in the midst of}} the album's glorious storm. Rooted in Carlile's love of both classic country and California pop, the song is the kind many other artists <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>want</b> to cover. It will be hard to top the original, though; it so eloquently highlights the telepathic connection Carlile shares with her longtime bandmates. A favorite on recent tours, 'The Eye' is destined to become a centerpiece in Carlile's catalog." ...|$|E
50|$|As our {{business}} grows, it becomes increasingly necessary to delegate responsibility {{and to encourage}} {{men and women to}} exercise their initiative. This requires considerable tolerance. Those men and women, to whom we delegate authority and responsibility, if they are good people, <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>want</b> to do their jobs in their own way. Mistakes will be made. But if a person is essentially right, the mistakes he or she makes are not as serious in the long run as the mistakes management will make if it undertakes to tell those in authority exactly how they must do their jobs. Management that is destructively critical when mistakes are made kills initiative. And it's essential that we have many people with initiative if we are to continue to grow.|$|E
5000|$|Over the nine-week period, Sunnafrank and Ramirez (2004) {{facilitated}} {{a classroom}} environment {{that allowed the}} students to continue {{to get to know}} one another. At the end of the nine weeks, those students who predicted positive outcomes developed strong relationships and their behavior indicated such as those students sat together in class and communicated on a regular basis. The strongest effect of the study existed in the relationships where there was a predicted negative outcome. If students decided after the initial interaction that they did not want the relationship to progress then the students acted accordingly by restricting conversation, avoiding eye contact, and avoiding each other period. Ramirez points out that there is power in first impressions. “People want to quickly determine if a person they just met is someone they <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>want</b> to hang out with, or date, or spend more time with in the future. We don’t want to waste our time.” ...|$|E

5000|$|In 2008, {{an audio}} {{recording}} obtained by student media included two psychology lecturers asking students to inflate their graded opinions given {{as part of}} the National Student Survey.

2500|$|Candy Crowley, Poppy Harlow and Paul Callan were {{criticized for}} portraying the two convicted rapists in the Steubenville High School rape case sympathetically and for placing very little {{focus on the}} victim on March 17, 2013.

5000|$|For the 20th {{anniversary of}} the film, the cast reunited with writer/filmmaker Lathleen Ade-Brown for Essence where Larenz Tate spoke about the casting process.

No need to rehearse, you just keep up with me and we just play off each other.’ She says. ‘I got you, let’s do it!’ I go in the audition and we really just lit up the room, then I had to audition solo. They didn’t know what to expect considering I just did Menace II Society playing O-Dawg, a completely street person. So that impressed them and they offered me the part." ...|$|E
5000|$|Roger Ebert, {{the late}} {{reviewer}} for the Chicago Sun-Times, {{has written that}} test screenings by filmmakers are [...] "valid" [...] {{to get an idea}} of an audience response to a rough cut. But [...] "too often, however, studio executives use preview screenings as a weapon to enforce their views on directors, and countless movies have had stupid happy endings tacked on after such screenings." [...] Ebert writes that Billy Wilder dropped the first reel from Sunset Boulevard after a test screening. [...] Producer Tim Bevan emphasizes that the goal of the film editing process is to turn unedited film [...] "into 85 to 110 minutes of story that people <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>want</b> to go and see", and he [...] "absolutely believes in the testing process. 99.9 times out of 100 the audience will speak louder than anybody else". Even though [...] "editing rooms can be very combative places" [...] with directors, the test results make the process [...] "less combative." [...] While filming Johnny English (2002) with director Peter Howitt, testing led to reshoots of the beginning of the film to set up the character better, and [...] "test scores leaped considerably." ...|$|E
50|$|By 1914, John and Horace {{had created}} the new four-cylinder Dodge Model 30. Marketed as a {{slightly}} more upscale competitor to the ubiquitous Ford Model T, it pioneered or made standard many features later taken for granted: all-steel body construction (the vast majority of cars worldwide still used wood-framing under steel panels, though Stoneleigh and BSA used steel bodies as early as 1911); 12-volt electrical system (6-volt systems would remain the norm until the 1950s); 35 horsepower (versus the Model T's 20), and sliding-gear transmission (the best-selling Model T would retain an antiquated planetary design until its demise in 1927). As a result of this, and the brothers' well-earned reputation for the highest quality truck, transmission and motor parts they made for other successful vehicles, Dodge Brothers cars were ranked at second place for U.S. sales as early as 1916. That same year, Henry Ford decided to stop paying stock dividends to finance the construction of his new River Rouge complex. This led the Dodges to file suit to protect their annual stock earnings of approximately one million dollars, leading Ford to buy out his shareholders; the Dodges were paid some 25 million USD. As the Dodge brothers decided to produce their own vehicle, John Dodge was once quoted as saying, “Someday, people who own a Ford <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>want</b> an automobile”, and introduced their first car in 1914.|$|E
5000|$|Men {{have had}} an {{identity}} problem since the women's movement. They have {{tried to figure out}} who they're supposed to be.

One of the things I discovered is when men have their own manspace, what they put inside of it is really an expression of who they are. Manspace is about establishing an identity for a man. Our premise is that women have control of the look and the feel of the house and that left guys wanting more.

50|$|The {{verdict on}} Miranda's musical effort is, like her album, a little confusing. I don't think she's quite {{at the point}} of being on {{mainstream}} radio; she's {{got a little bit of}} work to do before that. But her bubblegum tracks are good enough to be played on children's radio stations, like Radio Disney, for example. Her current sound, the mixture of club beats and the sugary sweet pop, will probably hit well with the younger end of her audience. I just don't know if anyone over the age of thirteen <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> listen to her album all that often. Tracks like “Disgusting” will probably land well with older teens, but when they can listen to its writer on the radio already, I don't see the need for them to buy this album.|$|R
