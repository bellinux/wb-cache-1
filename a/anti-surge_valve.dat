40|$|Lecturepg. 13 - 26 For every {{centrifugal}} compressor installation, {{the design of}} the surge control system is vitally important to prevent damage of the compressor internal components, seals, and bearings. While most surge control systems are capable of preventing surge for steady-state operation, emergency shutdowns (ESDs) are particularly challenging, since the surge control system must respond faster than the deceleration rate of the train. The available experimental data are not of sufficient quality and resolution to properly validate current software packages. This paper outlines an experimental test program using a full-scale compressor tested in a hydrocarbon flow loop under controlled, laboratory conditions. Transient compressor surge data during and ESD were captured over a variety of initial speed, pressure, and flow conditions. Furthermore, the <b>anti-surge</b> <b>valve</b> was modified in subsequent tests to simulate a slower and a smaller valve, providing a more varied test condition. Results of the testing and model comparisons will be presented...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} multivariable model {{predictive}} control scheme for discharge pressure regulation in centrifugal compressors. The main novelty {{of the proposed}} approach is that three control inputs are considered: the rotational speed of the compressor, an <b>anti-surge</b> <b>valve</b> for gas recycle and the inlet guide vane, whose variations allow one to significantly enlarge the operating region of the compressor and hence to enhance {{the authority of the}} control system. Surge prevention is achieved by including in the model an output variable accounting for the distance of the operating point from the surge limit. Such distance is defined on a compressor performance map which is invariant to changes in the inlet conditions, and thus its computation requires only standard pressure measurements available from the plant. Numerical simulations show that the proposed control system is able to meet the desired specifications, in the presence of different types of disturbances occurring along the pipeline...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a novel concept for calculation of optimal maintenance strategies for equipments that degrade over time. The concept {{is based on}} a dynamic mathematical model that is used in a look-ahead strategy to assess the effect of different future operational strategies. The optimum is given with respect to minimum costs for maintenance and the costs for not performing maintenance. The main idea is to illustrate that given these costs; the optimal strategy might be to wait a certain time before maintenance is per-formed. By this, considerable costs might be saved compared to performing the maintenance immediately or wait too long time before the maintenance is performed. In practice, rough estimates are often satisfactory for such decisions. Hence, the accuracy of the model behind the calculations might not be critical. The methodol-ogy is illustrated for a case of internal leakage in <b>anti-surge</b> <b>valves</b> for compressor control...|$|R
40|$|Compressors are key {{components}} in the refrigerant circuits of the Snøhvit LNG plant and contain large amounts of mechanical energy. Thus {{it is imperative that}} the control system is able to keep the compressor out of surge in case of driver trip. A dynamic process simulator describing the total LNG plant has been developed by Kongsberg Process Simulation and the simulator has been applied in the engineering phase for the design and process verification. The simulator has also been used to verify the robustness of the closed loop refrigerant circuits and to verify that the compressors are sufficiently protected after a driver trip. The presented work demonstrates  the value of dynamic simulations for verification of compressor protection systems. In addition it shows the importance of using correct data for polar inertia of the rotating equipment, as well as the opening and dead times of the <b>anti-surge</b> <b>valves.</b> It is recommended to include a sensitivity analysis of these parameters as part of plant verification studies...|$|R
40|$|To {{provide a}} good deal of {{manufacturing}} processes, is used a compressed air, which is produced by compressors of various types, including turbochargers. In highlands, the turbocharger operation is characterized {{by the fact that the}} actual performance of the turbochargers differ significantly from the certified values, and the compressed air parameters do not always guarantee the smooth and efficient functioning of using equipment. The conducted theoretical and experimental studies have found out that the highland has impact on the probability of emerging surge. The paper proposes a method to determine a performance margin, which can reduce the overcapacity, i. e., to bring the operating point to the border zone of the surge without opening the <b>anti-surge</b> <b>valve.</b> The paper presents research results of the turbochargers of the type 4 CI 425 MX 4, a series of "CENTAC" manufactured by INGERSOL – RAND, made under production-line conditions in the highland under severe weather conditions. A boundary position of the surge can significantly vary depending on the atmospheric air condition (pressure, temperature, humidity). Knowing the current position of the surge zone and the operating point of the compressor it is possible to regulate the compressor capacity so that, when moving the operating point in the area of low consumption, to provide maximum approximation of the operating point to the border zone of the surge without opening the <b>anti-surge</b> <b>valve.</b> The performance margin relative to the border of surge margin sets the lower limit of regulation and its choice depends on the speed of the operating point movement towards reducing consumption. A reliably determined starting point of the unstable turbocharger operation is an important component to maintain the reliable operation of the air-compressed installations. As follows from the data in the article, the borders of the starting surge and the line of the maximum acceleration of the operating point movement towards surge with decreasing density of the intake air are moved to the left of the operating point, and the value of surge margin increases. The turbocharger stability in highland conditions, when moving the operating point in the area of low consumption is increased. </p...|$|E

An accurately designed surge control system that includes multiple compressors with the associated piping systems is a vital element of a facility?s design and ongoing operational integrity. The design must ensure compressors are not subjected to damaging fast dynamic events leading to large capital costs and significant down time for operators. Examples of such fast dynamic events are those following emergency shutdown (ESD) or fast stop of one or all compressor units in a station. Typical studies are not accurate enough to capture the complex interactions leading to catastrophic events, especially for complicated system arrangements. This paper introduces three methods of surge control analysis that can be conducted to assess the effectiveness of any surge control system design to prevent the compressor from surge. The first method utilizes the perturbation theory to relate the compressor deceleration and the resulting drop in its flow and head to determine the elapsed time that the compressor can stay out of surge before the surge control system brings about enough positive flow to prevent the unit from undergoing deep surge. The second method is simpler, {{and is based on}} a dimensionless number, called the inertia number, which combines the salient parameters from the dynamic equation between the fluid energy and that of the compressor rotor inertia to determine, as a first cut check, if the surge control system is adequate. The third method, which is always recommended, and is based on solving the full gas dynamic partial differential equations (PDEs) in spatial and temporal domain, which describe the true dynamic characteristics of the flow through the various piping elements, the compressor itself, to provide much more accurate predictions of surge control system behavior during fast transient events. Comparisons are made to field measurements to provide model validations, and an example application (Case Study) of three units operating in parallel. The first two (Units 6 and 7) were existing in a compressor station, while the third (Unit 8) was an add-on. The addition of Unit 8 meant a number of station layout modifications, which included: re-wheeling of Units 6 and 7 (i. e., change the compressor impellers); adding after gas cooling; and relocating the anti-surge valves downstream of the coolers to allow for both hot (fast stop) and cold recycle (anti-surge) capabilities. Due to the addition of equipment and significant reconfiguration of station piping and valves, a dynamic surge analysis on Units 6, 7, and 8 was required to determine whether the existing anti-surge and fast stop valves were adequately sized and whether the anti-surge valves could be relocated downstream of the gas coolers. A new fast stop recycle system was added along with Unit 8, which also needed to be adequately sized. Further complications arose from the fact that Unit 6 ?s <b>anti-surge</b> <b>valve</b> configuration differs from that of Unit 7 and that Unit 6 has twin recycle valves jointly serving as anti-surge valves with a single fast stop valve while Unit 7 has a single <b>anti-surge</b> <b>valve</b> and a single fast stop valve...|$|E
40|$|Lecturepg. 118 - 132 Compression systems {{involving}} {{centrifugal compressors}} are designed and operated {{in a manner}} to eliminate or minimize the potential for compressor surge, which is a dynamic instability that is detrimental {{to the integrity of}} the unit. Compressor surge can occur when the compression systems are subjected to rapid transients such as those caused by and emergency shutdown (ESD) or a power failure. Compression systems, like other second-order dynamic systems, are prone to instabilities. These depend on compressor head-flow characteristics of the compressor units as well as the dynamic characteristics of the machinery train and associated piping systems. Parameters such as gas volume capacitance in the recycle path, compressor power train inertia and the recycle valve capacity, <b>anti-surge</b> <b>valve</b> prestroke and stroke time, and check valve dynamic characteristics are crucial in determining the conditions for dynamic instabilities to occur. Anti-surge control protocols also contribute to potential compressor instabilities particularly when the compressor is operating close to the surge control line. This paper gives an overview concept of the principle of static and dynamic stabilities in a simple compression system involving centrifugal compressors, capacitance, gas inertia, and flow throttling. For a more complex compression system design, involving complex piping geometries akin to those employed in industrial compression system, techniques and methods of determining whether a certain design or an operating mode will lead to instabilities are also formulated and solved. This investigation lead to the notion of a dimensionless inertia number with a threshold value below which a given design is prone to instability during an ESD operation. Data are drawn from over a dozen compressor station of various designs employing different compressor models and drive types, e. g., electric motors or gas turbines. An example is presented to illustrate the concept of instabilities...|$|E
40|$|LectureLecture 11 : The {{axial thrust}} is {{basically}} {{generated by a}} pressure imbalance across the impeller. The impeller is subjected to a great force trying to move it against the incoming flow. The cumulative thrust of all impellers on the shaft, especially when the impeller arrangement is in-line, has to be compensated by a balance piston. The {{purpose of this paper}} is to describe the calculation procedure for the accurate evaluation of the thrust in centrifugal compressors for medium and high pressure applications. In this respect the paramount factors which influence the thrust are considered such as the operating conditions (surge or choke), the different combinations of operating modes inside the compressor (in the case of multi-section configuration), as well as variable labyrinth seal clearances and different roughness of rotor and stator. Different arrangements of the compressor like in-line and back-to-back configurations are analysed and compared with regard to their influence on thrust and thrust variation. An example with a medium pressure compressor is given. The paper also focuses on the main inaccuracies for the calculation of the thrust like the core rotation factor and the degree of reaction of the stages. To validate the calculations, extensive measurements of the thrust forces acting on the axial thrust bearing were performed during the full-load, full-pressure factory testing of different high-pressure centrifugal compressors. The results of the tests demonstrate the accuracy of the prediction and the high sensitivity of the thrust to the boundary conditions. The evaluation of the thrust analyses is the base for the further determination of the stability behavior of the compressor which is compared to the damping measurement carried out during factory testing. These measurements emphasize the importance of performing such thrust measurements during a full-load, full-pressure or ASME PTC 10 Type 1 test. The requirements of some specifications are discussed and their consequences on the design of the compressor are evaluated with respect to their feasibility. The impact of the size of the ASV (<b>Anti-Surge</b> <b>Valve)</b> on the thrust range of the compressor is further discussed...|$|E
