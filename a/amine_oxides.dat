25|$|Because of the {{electronegative}} {{nitrogen in}} the pyridine ring, the molecule is relatively electron deficient. It, therefore, enters less readily electrophilic aromatic substitution reactions, which {{are characteristic of}} benzene derivatives; even moreso if the reaction mix doesn't scavenge protons released by the reaction (protonated pyridine is even more electron-deficient). However, unlike benzene and its derivatives, pyridine is more prone to nucleophilic substitution and metalation of the ring by strong organometallic bases. The reactivity of pyridine can be distinguished for three chemical groups. With electrophiles, electrophilic substitution takes place where pyridine expresses aromatic properties. With nucleophiles, pyridine reacts at positions 2 and 4 and thus behaves similar to imines and carbonyls. The reaction with many Lewis acids results in the addition to the nitrogen atom of pyridine, {{which is similar to}} the reactivity of tertiary amines. The ability of pyridine and its derivatives to oxidize, forming <b>amine</b> <b>oxides</b> (N-oxides), is also a feature of tertiary amines.|$|E

30|$|Figure 4 c shows color {{changes during}} the reaction, as the {{solution}} turned brown after the synthesis of nanowires under each ambient gas.

The formation of an <b>amine</b> <b>oxide</b> specimen can be a contributing factor in the determination of the ZnCoO nanowire morphology.

30|$|High-quality ZnCoO {{nanowires}} {{were obtained}} by the aqueous solution method. The ambient gas affected the magnetic properties of the fabricated samples, and the oxidation of trioctylamine solution played an important role. The generation of an appropriate amount of <b>amine</b> <b>oxide</b> due to a limited oxygen supply enhanced the growth of ZnCoO nanowires because the <b>amine</b> <b>oxide</b> acted as a surfactant. However, excessive oxygen inhibited the growth by changing the polarity of the solution. The as-grown ZnCoO nanowires exhibited magnetic properties, but these properties were extrinsic due to the thermal heat treatment process.
