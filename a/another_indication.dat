5|$|Fragment 1 {{identifies}} Jesus {{as the son}} of the Holy Spirit; {{this idea}} is found also in the Egyptian Coptic Epistle of James, <b>another</b> <b>indication</b> of the Egyptian origin of the gospel.|$|E
5|$|<b>Another</b> <b>indication</b> that Sahure had not {{faded from}} memory during the Middle Kingdom is the Westcar Papyrus, {{which was written}} during the 12th Dynasty. The papyrus tells the mythical story {{of the origins of}} the 5th Dynasty, {{presenting}} kings Userkaf, Sahure and Neferirkare Kakai as three brothers, sons of Ra and a woman named Rededjet.|$|E
5|$|<b>Another</b> <b>indication</b> that {{feet and}} other {{tetrapod}} traits evolved while {{the animals were}} still aquatic is how they were feeding. They {{did not have the}} modifications of the skull and jaw that allowed them to swallow prey on land. Prey could be caught in the shallows, at the water's edge or on land, but had to be eaten in water where hydrodynamic forces from the expansion of their buccal cavity would force the food into their esophagus.|$|E
5000|$|For the prefix, [...] "Mac" [...] or [...] "Mc" [...] {{then this}} is <b>another</b> strong <b>indication</b> of a Geoghegan origin.|$|R
50|$|<b>Another</b> broad <b>indication</b> {{of greater}} antiquity is {{the height of}} the churchyard earth in {{relation}} to the ground outside the walls. Centuries of repeated burials in the same location resulted in the gradual elevation of terrain.|$|R
5000|$|... “The law is <b>another</b> clear <b>indication</b> {{that the}} human rights {{situation}} in Afghanistan is getting worse not better. Respect for women’s rights - and human rights in general - {{is of paramount importance}} to Afghanistan’s future security and development. This law is a huge step in the wrong direction,” said Pillay.|$|R
5|$|Historian Timothy Bolton has {{recently}} {{argued that the}} similarities between these genealogies is evidence of a shared family tradition between the descendants of Siward and Thorgil Sprakling. Bolton hypothesized that Siward's alleged father Bjorn was probably a historical figure, a brother of Thorgil Sprakling. Siward would then have been first cousin to Earl Ulf, the earl of Denmark who married Cnut's sister Estrith and founded the dynasty of Danish monarchs that eventually succeeded Cnut's. Bolton argued that the Sprakling family had only recently risen to prominence in Scandinavia, and so Siward's career in England was <b>another</b> <b>indication</b> of that family's success in Scandinavian politics.|$|E
25|$|C-reactive protein can be measured, with an {{elevated}} level being <b>another</b> <b>indication</b> of inflammation.|$|E
25|$|<b>Another</b> <b>indication</b> for neuroimaging is CT-, MRI- and PET-guided {{stereotactic}} {{surgery or}} radiosurgery {{for treatment of}} intracranial tumors, arteriovenous malformations and other surgically treatable conditions.|$|E
5000|$|Also in 1964 Horwitz {{started a}} series of {{architectural}} interior renderings for a fictitious couple named, “Mr. and Mrs. McGillicutty.” Each rendering was composed of basic interior elements including a window and a window-blind. Horwitz lost interest in all {{other elements of the}} series, save for the varied positioning of the window-blinds. Altering the position of the blinds was <b>another</b> early <b>indication</b> of Horwitz's inquiry into systems and sequences and their variety of patterns.|$|R
40|$|Many new physics {{scenarios}} {{beyond the}} Standard Modelpredict {{the presence of}} narrow or broad resonancesdecaying {{to a pair of}} quarks/gluons, charged/neutralleptons, photons and their combinations, or a multi-jet finalstate.

60|$|Suddenly {{his eyes}} cleared {{and he saw}} the pile of stones. His blood turned to ice, then to fire. That was the mark of a {{prospector}}'s claim. But it was old, very old. The ledge had never been worked, the slope was wild. There was not <b>another</b> single <b>indication</b> that a prospector had ever been there. Where, then, was he who had first staked this claim? Gale wondered with growing hope, with the fire easing, with the cold passing.|$|R
25|$|The Dogon {{languages}} show few {{remnants of}} a noun class system (one example is that human nouns take a distinct plural suffix), leading linguists to conclude that Dogon {{is likely to have}} diverged from Niger–Congo very early. <b>Another</b> <b>indication</b> of this is the subject–object–verb basic word order, which Dogon shares with such early Niger–Congo branches as Ijoid and Mande.|$|E
25|$|Passengers {{reported}} seeing red {{paint on the}} passing ice less than thirty minutes prior to when the flooding was reported, <b>another</b> <b>indication</b> that the vessel was passing through compact and hard ice. The Master of Explorer was very experienced in Baltic waters but he was unfamiliar {{with the type of}} ice he encountered in Antarctic waters.|$|E
25|$|Llywelyn had now {{established}} himself {{as the leader of}} the independent princes of Wales, and in December 1215, led an army which included all the lesser princes to capture the castles of Carmarthen, Kidwelly, Llanstephan, Cardigan and Cilgerran. <b>Another</b> <b>indication</b> of his growing power was that he was able to insist on the consecration of Welshmen to two vacant sees that year, Iorwerth, as Bishop of St. David's, and Cadwgan, as Bishop of Bangor.|$|E
25|$|In the United States, Pfizer {{received}} two patents for sildenafil: one for its indication to treat cardiovascular disease (marketed as Revatio) and <b>another</b> for its <b>indication</b> to treat erectile dysfunction (marketed as Viagra).

50|$|One of the {{principle}} symptoms of GAPO syndrome is growth retardation, caused by slow skeletal formation and results in individuals being below average height. Alopecia, or hair loss, is <b>another</b> key <b>indication</b> of GAPO syndrome. Their hair is typically thinly dispersed, and fragile, which often leads to baldness later in life. Similarly, tooth growth is stunted, with teeth failing to emerge form the gums or otherwise develop normally. Atrophy of the optic nerve occurs in approximately one third of individuals. This degradation leads to inhibited peripheral vision, and increased difficulty distinguishing colours.|$|R
25|$|In {{an entry}} of the Shoku Nihongi, dated April 14, 741, {{it was noted}} that gifts of land, servants, horses and Buddhist sutras were made to the Hachiman shrine and for the {{construction}} of a pagoda. Bender considers these offerings to be in thanks for the suppression of Hirotsugu's rebellion. While not directly related to the rebellion, Shōmu's edict of 741, in which he decreed that provincial temples be established, is <b>another</b> <b>indication</b> for the desolate state of the country following a number of calamities.|$|E
25|$|<b>Another</b> <b>indication</b> of the {{importance}} of wine in ancient Israel is that Hebrew contains numerous terms for various stages and types of vines, grape varieties and words for wine. The word yayin was used both as a generic word for wine and as a term for wine in its first year, once it had undergone sufficient fermentation from the initial stage, when it was called tirosh. The type of wine was determined by the grapes, the time allowed for fermentation, and the age of the wine.|$|E
25|$|Finally, other {{evidence}} suggests important internal transformations of the Asturian kingdom during this time. Rebellions of freedmen (serbi, servilis orico and libertini, {{according to the}} Chronicles) occurred {{during the reign of}} Aurelio I. The property relationship between master and slave broke down progressively. This fact, together with the growing role of the individual and the restricted family in detriment of the role that until that time had fulfilled the extended family, is <b>another</b> <b>indication</b> that a new society was emerging in Asturias {{at the end of the}} eighth and beginning of the ninth centuries.|$|E
2500|$|The [...] "initial stage" [...] of crizzling {{occurs when}} alkali is {{present on the}} glass, giving the glass a cloudy or hazy appearance.

30|$|Looking {{closely at}} Figure[*] 17, we {{conclude}} that for our particular case, the most effective feature parameter is the average camera motion, with the highest individual correlation coefficient (ρ= 0.6531). This {{is an indication that}} camera movement is more prominent during exciting moments of a baseball game, which is probably not the case for tennis, where the camera is more or less stationary. Excitement level detected in commentator speech is <b>another</b> good <b>indication</b> of excitability (ρ= 0.5146). This is more or less true for any sports. The slow motion feature is also highly correlated with excitability (ρ= 0.5066).|$|R

25|$|The {{most common}} {{assumption}} {{is to compare}} power densities at the same pressure, choosing the ion temperature for each reaction to maximize power density, and with the electron temperature equal to the ion temperature. Although confinement schemes can be and sometimes are limited by other factors, most well-investigated schemes {{have some kind of}} pressure limit. Under these assumptions, the power density for p–11B is about 2,100 times smaller than that for D-T. Using cold electrons lowers the ratio to about 700. These numbers are <b>another</b> <b>indication</b> that aneutronic fusion power is not possible with mainline confinement concepts.|$|E
25|$|Brain {{size was}} {{previously}} considered a major {{indicator of the}} intelligence of an animal. However, many other factors also affect intelligence. Recent discoveries concerning bird intelligence have called into question the usefulness of brain size as an indicator. Since most of the brain is used for maintaining bodily functions, greater ratios of brain to body mass may {{increase the amount of}} brain mass available for more complex cognitive tasks. Allometric analysis indicates that mammalian brain size scales at approximately the ⅔ or ¾ exponent of the body mass. Comparison of a particular animal's brain size with the expected brain size based on such allometric analysis provides an encephalization quotient (EQ) that can be used as <b>another</b> <b>indication</b> of the animal's intelligence.|$|E

2500|$|The {{researcher}} Jeremy Northcote {{found that}} crop {{circles in the}} UK are not spread randomly across the landscape.

50|$|Other {{mechanisms}} for producing a crater were considered and rejected by Allen and Stewart when they discovered the crater. Volcanism was excluded {{because there were}} no magnetic anomalies in the crater, which would be expected if eruptions had occurred there. Withdrawal of salt deposits below the crater, known to be a mechanism for the formation of some craters, was ruled out because the Triassic and Permian layers of rock beneath the crater appeared to be undisturbed. <b>Another</b> strong <b>indication</b> that an impact had created the crater was the presence of a central peak - something that Stewart & Allen contend is difficult to form except through a meteorite impact.|$|R

25|$|The most {{complete}} anthropological {{study of how}} a Mexican fixed market operates was done by Bronislaw Malinowsky and Julio de la Fuente in the 1930s {{in the city of}} Oaxaca. The study focused on how the central market of the city worked with the rural communities of the surrounding area. It determined that, for the most part, the relationship had not changed much since before the Conquest in both its economic and social structure. In many areas, local markets, with the abundance of colors, odors, flavors and meanings, represent a synthesis of culture and history of a region, especially that related to commerce that community has with others, according to Amalia Attolina, ethnohistorian at the INAH. In many areas of the country, these traditional markets still constitute a meeting area and a form of social cohesion. <b>Another</b> <b>indication</b> of the market’s cultural continuity is the presence of shrines in almost all traditional markets. In Aztec times, these were to deities such as those related to commerce. Today, most are dedicated to the Virgin Mary or Christ.|$|E
25|$|Although many viewers {{assume the}} wife to be pregnant, {{this is not}} {{believed}} to be so. Art historians point to numerous paintings of female virgin saints similarly dressed, and believe that this look was fashionable for women's dresses at the time. Fashion would have been important to Arnolfini, especially {{since he was a}} cloth merchant. The more cloth a person wore, the more wealthy he or she was assumed to be. <b>Another</b> <b>indication</b> that the woman is not pregnant is that Giovanna Cenami (the identification of the woman according to most earlier scholars) died childless, as did Costanza Trenta (a possible identification according to recent archival evidence); whether a hypothetical unsuccessful pregnancy would have been left recorded in a portrait is questionable, although if it is indeed Constanza Trenta, as Koster proposed, and she died in childbirth, then the oblique reference to pregnancy gains strength. Moreover, the beauty ideal embodied in contemporary female portraits and clothing rest in the first place on the high valuation on the ability of women to bear children. Harbison maintains her gesture is merely an indication of the extreme desire of the couple shown for fertility and progeny.|$|E
500|$|<b>Another</b> <b>indication</b> of the {{presence}} of severe weather along a squall line is its morphing into a line echo wave pattern, or LEWP. [...] A LEWP is a special configuration in a line of convective storms that indicates {{the presence}} of a low-pressure area and the possibility of damaging winds, large hail, and tornadoes. At each kink along the LEWP is a mesoscale low-pressure area, which could contain a tornado. [...] In response to very strong outflow southwest of the mesoscale low, a portion of the line bulges outward forming a bow echo. [...] Behind this bulge lies the mesoscale high-pressure area.|$|E
25|$|Historically, {{progesterone}} {{has been}} widely used {{in the treatment of}} premenstrual syndrome. A Cochrane review found insufficient evidence for or against the effectiveness of progesterone for this <b>indication.</b> <b>Another</b> review of 10 studies found that progesterone was not effective for this condition, although it stated that insufficient evidence is available currently to make a definitive statement on progesterone in premenstrual syndrome.|$|R
30|$|The {{athletic}} and functional demands that adolescents and teenagers place on their elbows {{continue to rise}} {{in most parts of}} the world. Anatomical reduction, early mobilization, and quick, full functional restoration is almost an undeclared expectation from patients, parents, and athletic trainers. Increasingly, patients with high-functional or athletic demands and displaced epicondylar fractures may represent <b>another</b> potential operative <b>indication</b> [1, 13].|$|R
5000|$|Different tell-tales can convey {{different}} kinds of information. One type lights or blinks to indicate a failure (as of oil pressure, engine temperature control, charging current, etc.); lighting and blinking indicate progression from warning to failure <b>indication.</b> <b>Another</b> type lights to alert the need for specific service after {{a certain amount of}} time or distance has elapsed (e.g., to change the oil).|$|R
