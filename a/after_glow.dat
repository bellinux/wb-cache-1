I strained my ears for sound of insect or rustle of sage or drop of weathered rock. The soft cool desert wind was soundless. This silence had something terrifying in it, making me a man alone on the earth. The great spaces, the wild places as they had been millions of years before!

5000|$|In older {{generation}} diesel-engine vehicles, unlike in a gasoline-engine vehicle, for a 'cold start' the operator did not simply turn {{the key to}} the [...] "start" [...] position and have the engine immediately start. Instead, the operator activated the glow plug(s) for a time first. Early diesels used the 'Thermostart' type glowplug in the inlet manifold. These take 20 seconds to achieve working temperature and the vehicle operator had to manually time (or guess) when the 20 seconds had elapsed. With in-cylinder glow plugs, technological improvements included a warning light on the dash to indicate how long the preheating should last. The preheating phase was also made to be automatically activated when the operator turned {{the key to the}} [...] "on" [...] position for a long duration; the glowplug relay switches the glowplugs on, and a light (see picture at right) on the instrument cluster illuminates. This process is called [...] "pre-heating" [...] or [...] "glowing". Many modern diesels automatically activate their glow plugs when the operator unlocks the vehicle or opens the door to the car, thus simplifying the process and shortening the time the operator has to wait before the engine will start. According to Bosch: [...] "Older engines with Thermostart manifold plugs used a glow period of up to 20 seconds whereas more modern engines use around a 6 to 8 second heat period and provide <b>after</b> <b>glow</b> at a reduced voltage." ...|$|E

40|$|The {{emission}} of light after the excitation source is switched off {{is known as}} phosphorescence. Phosphorescence occurs when suitable elements with active electronic configuration are doped into certain host materials. For an efficient phosphorescence emission (long <b>after</b> <b>glow</b> time and high intensity), both the dopant ion and the host material are critical. Strontium aluminates, such as SrAl 2 O 4, SrAl 4 O 7, SrAl 12 O 19, have gained attention {{for the last two}} decades due to their phosphorescence behavior upon doping with rare earth elements such as Eu, and Dy. These phosphorescent materials are superior to other materials of this kind as they have long <b>after</b> <b>glow</b> times with high quantum efficiency; they are easy to produce with alternating methods and are low cost materials. The focus of this thesis is on the different stoichiometric compounds of strontium aluminates with the dopants Eu 2 +, Dy 3 +, and boron. Eu 2 + introduces phosphorescence whereas Dy 3 + is used to increase the <b>after</b> <b>glow</b> time. Boron on the other hand improves the crystallinity, and also the <b>after</b> <b>glow</b> time. The general aim of this thesis is to develop materials with long <b>after</b> <b>glow</b> duration i. e more than one hour. A modified version of the Pechini process is proposed in order to accomplish the objective. The proposed procedure is one step ahead from the previous studies as it is an easy, lowtemperature and low-cost method. Moreover, by the proposed method, strontium aluminate compounds can be incorporated with up to 30 % boron without disturbing the crystal lattice and hence without lowering the crystallinity. These advantages are also verified experimentally...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Flame {{retardant}} fabrics {{have been}} broadly used for protective clothing, which have strictly requirements on both flame retardancy and thermal protection. Usually, domestic laundering {{will be carried}} out frequently to clean these protective garments. However, little research on the performance durability of this type of fabrics after domestic laundering has been reported. This paper selected fabrics of 8 types of cotton and its blend fibers, which were treated with flame retardants Pyrovatex CP, Proban, CFR- 201, SCJ- 968 respectively. The damaged length, after flame time, <b>after</b> <b>glow</b> time, TPP value, thermal resistance value, weight, thickness, air permeability and water vapor permeability (WVP) of the samples were measured before and after 15 cycles domestic laundering cycles. Results show that the flame retardancy of the 8 fabrics reduce with launderings as measured by the increase in damaged length and <b>after</b> <b>glow</b> time. The TPP increase probably resulted from the increase in the thickness and thermal resistance of the finished fabrics. Domestic laundering resulted in only a slight change in the comfort properties of the fabrics. ...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: The flame {{characteristics}} of castor oil based foam {{and that of}} polyether foam impregnated with inorganic flame retardants (FR) were investigated. The polyether foams were impregnated with measured concentration of Antimony trioxide and Sodium bromide, Ammonium dihydrogen orthophosphate, Diammonium hydrogen orthophosphate, and Castor oil containing zero flame retardant. Incorporating these flame retardants into polyurethane formulations gave variable flame characteristics such as ignition time, flame propagation rate, <b>after</b> <b>glow,</b> char rate, add-on and glow time. These properties were measured {{as a function of}} concentration and type of flame retardant incorporated into the formulation. Result showed that ignition time and Add-On showed significant increase in this sequence-Castor oil>Ammonium dihydrogen orthophosphate> Diammonium hydrogen orthophosphate>Antimony trioxide/Sodium bromide, at all the different concentrations, while flame-propagation rate and After-glow decreased in the same sequence for all the FR used at different concentrations. However the %Char increased in a reverse order – Diammonium hydrogen orthophosphate>Ammonium dihydrogen orthophosphate>Antimony trioxide/Sodium bromide>Castor oil. These results show that castor oil is an effective flame retardant compared to the inorganic flame-retardants...|$|E

40|$|Atmospheric {{pressure}} plasma jets {{have proven}} their technological advantage {{in a wide}} variety of fields in last years. In this work an atmospheric pressure plasma jet excited by sinuswave 70 kHz high voltage has been investigated. Gas temperature has been measured using optical emission spectroscopy. Simulation of gas flow dynamic has been carried out and temperature profile is compared with experimental one. Plasma is generated in pure Ar and Ar/H 2 O mixture. The gas temperature has a significant impact on the chemical kinetic rates, active species concentrations and determining of the different application for plasma jet. Temperature profile of source gas jet has been estimated by fitting of experimental space resolved spectrums with simulated ones and by Boltzmann plot technique. OH rotational temperature determined from fitting of experimental and simulated spectra is almost constant in <b>after</b> <b>glow.</b> The gas temperature for pure argon is 450 K and for Ar/H 2 O leads to 800 K for input power 12. 8 W. In second method, estimation of gas temperature was made by using spectral line of OH radicals in a Boltzmann plot. Then the Boltzmann plot cure was separated to 3 region, region with low temperature population with J 25 characterized by fast depopulation of rotational-vibrational levels. This effect is due to different mechanism of generation of excited species with different J numbers. Different mechanisms are extensively discussed in this paper. Modeling of the plasma jet has been done using a fluid model base on Fluent software. Experimental results are in good agreement with the simulated ones...|$|E
