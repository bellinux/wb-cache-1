40|$|AbstractThermal arc spray <b>aluminium</b> <b>coating</b> {{is widely}} used {{in recent years as}} a {{protective}} coating due to its capability to withstand high temperature and cost effective process. It has been utilized by many industrialists in oil and gas sector, where most of the applications are in atmospheric condition. Organic coating could fail prematurely and result in corrosion progression from coating failure. This paper will discuss the overall framework of experiments to justify the performance of thermal arc spray <b>aluminium</b> <b>coating.</b> In this research 99. 5 % aluminium was used as the coating material in wire form of 2. 3 mm diameter using wire arc spray method. Six samples were prepared with different thickness of coating from 200 to 400 microns. Mechanical tests such as Pull-off Test and Bend Test were performed to evaluate the coating performance. The tests indicated that all samples had passed the minimum requirement with an average of 10 MPa for Pull off Test and no crack appeared in Bend Test. Hardness Test and Surface Morphology Analysis were also performed with coating thickness ranged between 350 - 400 microns to inspect and evaluate the coating properties. The hardness test showed an average value of 209. 7 HV. Surface morphology analysis using FE-SEM indicated low porosity structures and high content of oxide. Thus, from the overall results and analysis {{it was found that the}} thermal arc spray can perform coating duty effectively. Further research may be conducted to explore more on the potentials of thermal arc spray <b>aluminium</b> <b>coating</b> such as the analysis on different coating thickness and coating materials...|$|R

They found that the micro hardness of the coating is increased when powder size distribution is reduced and spray distance is increased from 650 to 800  mm. Moreover, it has been found that the performance of low pressure plasma spray <b>aluminium</b> <b>coating</b> is strongly dependent on flattening behavior of the deposited particles, which are closely related to spraying parameters.|$|R

40|$|The biofilm {{formation}} of the oral fungal pathogen Candida on denture acrylic <b>strips</b> <b>coated</b> with saliva, serum and, saliva-serum pellicle were examined in vitro using Candida albicans (four isolates), Candida glabrata (three isolates) and Candida tropicalis (three isolates). The degree of biofilm activity varied depending upon both the isolate and the pellicle. Significantly increased biofilm activity on the pellicle (particularly serum) <b>coated</b> <b>strips</b> was observed with three isolates of C. albicans and another of C. glabrata on protein-coated acrylics, with increasing concentration of serum in the pellicle. Similar trends were observed with one isolate of C. albicans and C. glabrata, although the effects of pellicles were not significant. In contrast, with all three isolates of C. tropicalis and a single isolate of C. glabrata, although the biofilm activity on the protein-free control strips {{was significantly higher than}} that of saliva- <b>coated</b> <b>strips,</b> the increase in activity of pellicle-admixed biofilm depended upon the serum concentration. Candidal biofilm formation on acrylic surfaces is essentially promoted with increasing concentration of serum in the pellicle.

The line sources account for the multiple scattering effect. By enforcing the boundary conditions, the intensity of the line sources can be calculated.

40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} hybrid {{optical fiber sensor}} system for {{simultaneously}} sensing the strain, temperature, and thermal strain of composite materials. The hybrid fiber optic sensor system involves a combination of three sensors: 1) a polarimetric sensor based on an acrylate coated polarization maintaining photonic crystal fiber (PM-PCF); 2) a <b>coating</b> <b>stripped</b> PM-PCF sensor; and 3) a fiber Bragg grating sensor (FBG). Temperature is sensed using the FBG sensor, axial strain is sensed using the acrylate coated PM-PCF sensor, and thermal strain is sensed using the <b>coating</b> <b>stripped</b> PM-PCF. The hybrid sensor system presented operates in the intensity domain by converting the polarization and wavelength information from the polarimetric sensors and the FBG, respectively, into detectable linear intensity variations. Subsequently, by deriving a characteristic matrix for the hybrid sensors, information about temperature, axial strain, and thermal strain can be simultaneously determined. An experimental demonstration of the hybrid sensor system is described based on a glass fiber reinforced composite material sample within which the three different sensors are embedded. The proposed sensor configuration can be employed in composite material structural health monitoring application...|$|R
