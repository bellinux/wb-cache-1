500|$|On {{arrival at}} Carabanchel, the vehicle was tested against the T-26 in {{mobility}} over different terrain types and in firepower. [...] The vehicles were graded {{based upon a}} five-point scale for each test, which would be multiplied by a coefficient of importance for each test. [...] During the testing the Verdeja traveled for some 500kilometres (300mi) without any maintenance problems, the only issue being the large consumption of water by the gasoline engine, {{due to the lack}} of an efficient radiator, and the loss of a rubber liner of one of the roadwheels. [...] It was found that the maximum velocity of the Verdeja was either on par with similar vehicles in foreign service or superior, while the Verdeja proved itself capable of going over trenches almost 2m wide and climbing slopes of 40°. [...] In terms of armament, it was proved that the vehicle could withstand the recoil of the 45millimetre high-velocity tank gun. [...] One of the vehicle's disadvantages was that the tank commander's <b>aiming</b> <b>device</b> was designed for a 37millimetre anti-tank cannon, adapted into the Verdeja {{due to the lack of}} time to manufacture one for the 45millimetre Mark I. [...] Testing concluded with the Verdeja receiving a total of 243 points, compared to the 205 points awarded to the T-26B. [...] Testing completed, the prototype was returned and several problems were fixed, including engine deficiencies, the elevation of the sprocket and an increase to 10millimetre of armor on all areas that had less. [...] These changes made, the Verdeja returned to testing, this time scoring 261.98 points.|$|E
2500|$|In the mid 90s, the SAF {{decided to}} develop an {{indigenous}} rifle to replace the aging M16S1, most {{of which had been}} in service since the 70s. The other option was to procure new—and more expensive—weapons, with the chief contender being the M16A2. The Advanced Combat Rifle was conceived, and it eventually became the SAR 21. The SAR 21 is the first production assault rifle of its class to incorporate a built-in Laser <b>Aiming</b> <b>Device</b> (LAD) (powered by a single [...] "AA" [...] battery) as standard. The rifle incorporates various patented safety features, such as a Kevlar cheek plate and overpressure vent that protects the shooter in the unlikely event of a chamber explosion or catastrophic failure. It also has an integral 1.5× optical scope that is built into its carrying handle. The scope aids in target acquisition, particularly under low light conditions. The scope is factory-zeroed, and requires minimal further zeroing to suit different users. This minimizes non-training range time to zero the weapons and maximises live-firing training hours.|$|E

50|$|The OTs-02 Kiparis {{can also}} {{accommodate}} a red dot sight or a tactical laser pointer which clips on {{forward of the}} magazine housing {{in such a way}} that the bottom of the laser <b>aiming</b> <b>device</b> can act as a forward grip during aiming.|$|E
50|$|Cagno co-founded 'AVIS-Voisin' (Atelier Voisin Italie Septentrionale) {{to build}} Voisin {{aircraft}} under licence. He designed and tested aircraft, founded Italy's first flying school in Pordenone, {{and was the}} first person to fly above Venice. After volunteering as a pilot for the Italo-Turkish War (1911 - 1912) in Libya he invented a bomb <b>aiming</b> <b>device.</b>|$|E

5000|$|<b>Aiming</b> <b>devices</b> for bombs, torpedoes, {{artillery}} and machine guns, using special purpose mechanical and electronic analog and (perhaps) digital [...] "computers". The mechanical analog Norden bomb sight {{is a well-known}} example.|$|R
40|$|Intraoral radiograms {{can be made}} {{according}} to the long tube paralleling technique utilizing <b>aiming</b> <b>devices.</b> An {{important factor in the}} design of these instruments is the length of the teeth to be radiographed. Reliable data regarding the length of the teeth in the different regions of the mouth are not available. Information on the length of teeth was therefore collected by measuring 1, 400 extracted teeth. A statistical analysis of the data finally resulted for each region of the mouth and for both sexes in a length value which could be used for the design of the <b>aiming</b> <b>devices...</b>|$|R
50|$|For {{all three}} {{ballistic}} barrel lengths a conversion kit {{is available to}} fire the mortar in a handheld mode (without bipod and sight) as a commando mortar. The conversion kit contains a small round basepiece, an alternate, slightly bigger rectangular basepiece for soft ground, a carrying belt, an <b>aiming</b> <b>device</b> to set the firing range and a handgrip with a trigger, which has a safety device, so that the commando mortar may be carried with a bomb inside the barrel.Commando versions are called M6C and are portable by one person. With these versions, the operation is restricted to a maximum operating gas pressure of 300 bar. This limits the mortars to using charge 3 as a maximum; however, it is recommended not to go above charge 2 due to precision (therefore the <b>aiming</b> <b>device</b> is for charge 0, charge 1 and charge 2 only).|$|E
50|$|The law {{specifies}} that {{usage of}} night vision (infrared) or laser aiming devices designed for military use is completely restricted {{to members of}} the army and associated entities even if the <b>aiming</b> <b>device</b> is used on a lower-restriction category firearm (e.g. such as on an airsoft gun). The law, however, does not restrict in any way the use of aiming devices not designed for military use.|$|E
50|$|The mouse {{is mainly}} {{of use to}} point and click adventures and other mouse-driven games to control the cursor. In later years, first-person {{shooters}} also {{make use of the}} peripheral to aim the player's view {{in the same manner as}} similar games on the PC. It is also used by the arcade lightgun shooting game Area 51 as an <b>aiming</b> <b>device</b> instead of GunCon compatibility.|$|E
50|$|The Armament section {{provides}} {{support for}} the main turret, ballistic computers, laser ranger finders, and other armament controls for the M1A1 Abrams, main battle field tank, {{as well as the}} various small arms repair and <b>aiming</b> <b>devices.</b>|$|R
50|$|This mortar is {{equipped}} with two <b>aiming</b> <b>devices</b> and is characterized by high mobility, which should {{meet the needs of}} fire during the rapid deployment. All common types of mortar bombs calibre 60mm can be fired from this mortar.|$|R
50|$|The iron sights {{consist of}} a square notch in the rear, and a {{vertical}} hooded post in the front. There are no accessory rails and no adapters have been produced {{for the use of}} a scope or other <b>aiming</b> <b>devices.</b>|$|R
5000|$|A {{finderscope}} is an <b>aiming</b> <b>device</b> used in astronomy, {{typically a}} small auxiliary telescope {{mounted on the}} main astronomical telescope along the same line of sight. The finderscope usually has a smaller magnification than the main telescope, providing a much larger field of view, useful for manually aiming (also called [...] "slewing") a telescope and locating a desired astronomical object. Some finderscopes have crosshairs to aid in accurately pointing the telescope system at a target.|$|E
5000|$|Soon a crude <b>aiming</b> <b>device</b> {{similar to}} the one used by the Panzerfaust was added to the design; it was fixed at a range of 30 m (100 ft). Several designations of this weapon were in use, amongst which Faustpatrone 1 or Panzerfaust 30 klein; however, it was common to refer to this weapon simply as the Faustpatrone. Of the earlier model, 20,000 were ordered and the first 500 Faustpatronen were {{delivered}} by the manufacturer, HASAG Hugo Schneider AG, Werk Schlieben, in August 1943.|$|E
5000|$|The Mi-28N was {{unveiled}} in 1995, the N designation meaning [...] "night". The prototype (no. 014) first flew on 14 November 1996. The most significant feature is a radar {{in a round}} cover above the main rotor, {{similar to that of}} the American AH-64D Apache Longbow. Mi-28N also has improved tor vision and an <b>aiming</b> <b>device</b> under the nose, including a TV camera and FLIR. Due to funding problems, development was interrupted. A second prototype with an improved rotor design {{was unveiled}} in March 2004 at Rosvertol.|$|E
50|$|The Beretta Mx4 Storm is the {{military}} version of the Cx4 Storm pistol-caliber carbine. It has a barrel length of 12 inches, and is capable of automatic fire. The Mx4 can use pistol magazines, or its own 30-round magazine. There is an accessory rail {{on the top of}} the Mx4 for mounting scopes, laser <b>aiming</b> <b>devices</b> or flashlights. There is another rail underneath, forward of the trigger, for mounting vertical foregrips, laser <b>aiming</b> <b>devices</b> or flashlights. The Mx4, with a scope, is fairly accurate out to 100 meters, and automatic fire is accurate out to 200 meters. The Mx4 has a reputation, among the many police and security personnel who use it, of reliability, ease of use, and handling.|$|R
50|$|The {{single most}} {{important}} characteristic that sets a sniper rifle apart from other military or police small arms is the mounting of a telescopic sight, which {{is relatively easy to}} distinguish from smaller optical <b>aiming</b> <b>devices</b> found on some modern assault rifles and submachine guns. This also allows the user to see farther.|$|R
40|$|Intraoral roentgenograms {{can be made}} {{according}} to the long-tube paralleling technique utilizing <b>aiming</b> <b>devices.</b> These instruments consist of a bite block, an indicator rod, and a collimator plate. For {{the position of the}} film in relation to the bite block surface, the following data are decisive and therefore studied: the length of the teeth to be radiographed, the enlargement {{as a result of the}} divergence of the x-ray beam, and the periapical area necessary for the interpretation and mounting of the roentgenograms. As a result, the bite blocks of the instruments were provided with three vertical steps to permit different film positions needed for the specific situation in the different regions of the mouth. The use of the correct film positions results in roentgenograms with a high diagnostic value. In order to reduce the patients radiation dose the <b>aiming</b> <b>devices</b> include a collimator plate. A description is given of the data used for the design of the plate...|$|R
50|$|The Combat Creatures lineup is a {{joint project}} between Nerf and Wow! Stuff. It {{features}} remote-controlled robots that can fire Elite darts. The first robot, the Terradrone, was released in Fall 2014. There is now a new edition, the TerraScout; a fully automatic clip system remote controlled blaster-like drone that {{has the ability to}} fire darts. It comes packaged with a 720p video camera, which can be equipped and viewed through the remote on an integrated LCD screen; this can be doubled as a portable <b>aiming</b> <b>device.</b>|$|E
50|$|The Schiessbecher {{had a short}} {{rifled barrel}} with a caliber of 30 mm and a length of 250 mm. It weighed 750 g and could be {{attached}} to weapons chambered for 7.92×57mm or 7.92×33mm Kurz ammunition like the Karabiner 98k, Karabiner 98a, G98/40, StG 44 and FG 42.A rather complicated <b>aiming</b> <b>device</b> was mounted {{to the left of}} the original sights and allowed for aiming ranges from 0 of up to 250 m in 25 m increments. The Schiessbecher was produced until May 1944. The total production was 1,450,114.|$|E
50|$|An early {{example of}} a man {{portable}} telescopic sight for low visibility/night use is the Zielgerät (<b>aiming</b> <b>device)</b> 1229 (ZG 1229), also known by its code name Vampir. The ZG 1229 Vampir was a Generation 0 active infrared night vision device developed for the Wehrmacht for the StG 44 assault rifle, intended primarily for night use. The issuing of the ZG 1229 Vampir system to the military started in 1944 and it was used {{on a small scale}} in combat from February 1945 until the final stages of World War II.|$|E
5000|$|Importation of airsoft guns (from {{outside of}} EU), all {{critical}} parts/components of airsoft guns and <b>aiming</b> <b>devices</b> (optics, RDS, [...].) are permitted {{only with a}} weapon importation license. For airsoft parts, most monitored on customs are barrels, optics, magazines, receivers and accessories like grenades. Springs, gears, hop-ups, pistons, cylinders, switches, triggers are usually let through. External and non-critical parts like rails, holders, bipods, etc. can be legally imported without the license.|$|R
50|$|The pistol is {{available}} in two models, the larger and heavier MP-445 (210 x 142 x 38mm) and the compact MP-445C (188 x 132 x 38mm). The MP-445 model has fully adjustable sights zeroed for both elevation and windage, while MP-445C has fixed, iron sights. It holds 15 rounds and readily accepts tactical flashlights and laser <b>aiming</b> <b>devices.</b> Like its predecessor the MP-444, the 445 features a frame made from super strong thermosetting plastic material.|$|R
50|$|Except for {{the very}} first {{delivery}} order, all U.S. military-issue M4 and M4A1 carbines possess a flat-top NATO M1913-specification (Picatinny) rail on top of the receiver for attachment of optical sights and other <b>aiming</b> <b>devices</b> — Trijicon TA01 and TA31 Advanced Combat Optical Gunsights (ACOG), EOTech 550 series holographic sights, and Aimpoint M68 Close Combat Optic (M68 CCO) being the favorite choices — and a detachable rail-mounted carrying handle. Standards are the Colt Model 920 (M4) and 921 (M4A1).|$|R
50|$|The {{weapon was}} a dual-purpose device {{in that it}} could also be used as a spade. When a leg was removed from the handle, the spade part of the weapon locked into {{position}} as a base plate for the mortar. The weapon was apparently intended to serve as a fire support weapon for every infantryman as it was designed to be operated by one man. There was no <b>aiming</b> <b>device</b> and the soldier simply pointed the mortar at its target. The soldier carried 15 rounds of ammunition on a fabric belt for the mortar.|$|E
50|$|Starting from 1941 {{the short}} 1.5x Zielfernrohr 41 (Zf41) {{telescopic}} sight was fitted to some Karabiner 98k rifles for sharpshooting use. The Zf-41 {{was in fact}} the first attempt to provide the ordinary infantryman with a rifle capable of being used, if not for pure sniping, then at least for sharpshooting. Most modern-day armies have adopted some form of optical <b>aiming</b> <b>device</b> on infantry weapons (such as the ACOG scope). It was initially planned to equip most combat units with the Zf-41 scopes, but only 6% of German weapons production could fit the sight.|$|E
50|$|F88SA2: The F88SA2 Austeyr is an {{evolutionary}} upgrade {{of the current}} rifle to fulfill an operational capability gap. Deliveries of several thousand were completed in late-2009 to selected units for overseas service. (Afghanistan) Technical improvements in the F88S-A2 include: Modified gas system for increased reliability and increased interoperability with U.S ammo. An enlarged ejection port. A longer Picatinny Rail {{on top of the}} weapon, a modified sight housing, a side rail mount for a torch and Night <b>Aiming</b> <b>Device</b> (NAD).

50|$|The scooters {{would be}} parachute-dropped in pairs, {{accompanied}} by a two-man team. The gun was carried on one scooter, while the ammunition was loaded on the other. Due {{to the lack of}} any kind of <b>aiming</b> <b>devices</b> the recoilless rifle was never designed to be fired from the scooter; the gun was mounted on a tripod, which was also carried by the scooter, before being fired. However, in an emergency it could be fired while in the frame, and while the scooter was moving.|$|R
