500|$|Antarctica is {{colder than}} the Arctic for three reasons. First, {{much of the}} {{continent}} is more than [...] above sea level, and temperature decreases with elevation in the troposphere. Second, the Arctic Ocean covers the north polar zone: the ocean's relative warmth is transferred through the icepack and prevents temperatures in the Arctic regions from reaching the extremes typical of the land surface of Antarctica. Third, the Earth is at aphelion in July (i.e., the Earth is farthest from the Sun in the Antarctic winter), and the Earth is at perihelion in January (i.e., the Earth is closest to the Sun in the <b>Antarctic</b> <b>summer).</b> The orbital distance contributes to a colder Antarctic winter (and a warmer <b>Antarctic</b> <b>summer)</b> but the first two effects have more impact.|$|E

Loeske was investigated on Léonie Island (67 ° 35 'S, 68 ° 20 'W, Antarctic Peninsula) in response to short-term changes of UV-B radiation. The UV-environment of natural mat formations dominated by S. uncinata was altered using filter screens. Two filter experiments were conducted in the <b>Antarctic</b> <b>summers</b> 1998 and 1999. A third filter experiment was conducted during springtime ozone depletion in October 1998. Photosynthetic {{activity of}} S. uncinata was mainly determined by photosynthetically active photon flux density (PPFD). Light response of relative electron transport rate through photosystem II (rel ETR=DeltaF/Fm'×PPFD) remained unaffected by ambient summer levels of UV-B radiation. The same was found for net photosynthesis and dark respiration. In October 1998, S. uncinata was mainly metabolically inactive due to low temperatures. No significant levels of DNA-damage measured as cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers (CPDs) were induced by ambient summer levels of UV-B. Artificially enhanced UV-B radiation supplying a Setlow-DNA-dose of 8. 7 kJ m– 2 day– 1 UV-B led to formation of 7 ± 3 CPD (106 nucleotides) – 1.
