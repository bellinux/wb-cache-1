5|$|Each NuScale {{reactor vessel}} is {{expected}} to be 9 feet diameter (2.74 meters) by 65 feet high (19.81 meters) and weigh 650 tons (590 metric tons). The modules would be pre-fabricated, delivered by <b>railcar,</b> <b>barge</b> or special trucks and assembled on-site. The units are designed to produce 50 megawatts of electricity each and require refueling with standard 4.95 percent enriched Uranium-235 fuel every two years.|$|R
2500|$|Various cargo {{was carried}} by the float service. The <b>railcar</b> <b>barges</b> held {{fourteen}} [...] railcars. Some of the railcars were chlorine tankers bound for the water treatment plant. Another cargo was Kessler Whiskey for the Seagram’s facility in South San Francisco. In a famous incident a whiskey tanker was among cars that rolled off the barge in mid-bay during foul weather. Another cargo was box cars of newsprint for the San Francisco Chronicle.|$|R
50|$|ICF chose Southern Railway of Vancouver Island (SVI) {{to operate}} the Island railway on Vancouver Island, after ICF’s {{acquisition}} of the railroad. The operator agreement started on July 1, 2006. In January 2010, the Southern Railway of British Columbia new train ferry terminal started operating in the Fraser River on Annacis Island shipping to Nanaimo via the Seaspan train ferry. The new train marine terminal was built {{with the help of}} $4.6 million in federal funding andcost $11 million. It increases the mainland's capacity and speed to load and unload <b>railcar</b> <b>barges</b> from the island.|$|R
40|$|Cryogenic {{transportation}} {{methods for}} providing liquid hydrogen requirements are examined {{in support of}} shuttle transportation system launch operations at Kennedy Space Center, Florida, during the time frames 1982 - 1991 in terms of cost and operational effectiveness. Transportation methods considered included sixteen different options employing mobile semi-trailer tankers, <b>railcars,</b> <b>barges</b> and combinations of each method. The study concludes that the most effective method of delivering liquid hydrogen from the vendor production facility in New Orleans to Kennedy Space Center includes maximum utilization of existing mobile tankers and railcars supplemented by maximum capacity mobile tankers procured incrementally in accordance with shuttle launch rates actually achieved...|$|R
50|$|Construction of a {{rail line}} from Pocomoke City to Cape Charles was {{completed}} on October 25, 1884, and operated as the New York, Philadelphia and Norfolk Railroad (NYP&N). Its founder, Alexander Johnston Cassatt (12/08/1839 to 12/08/1906), designed a barge {{large enough to}} carry 18 <b>railcars.</b> His <b>barges</b> provided the new railroad with its connection across the Chesapeake Bay to Norfolk by April 1885. The railroad's co-founder, coal magnate William Lawrence Scott, financed construction of the new town of Cape Charles in 1884 {{at the point where}} the railroad's northern section met the Chesapeake Bay. From its inception, the NYP&N operated profitably and contributed to an economic boom on the Delmarva peninsula that continued until the Great Depression.|$|R
50|$|Due to {{the high}} level of {{accuracy}} required during custody transfer applications, the flowmeters which are used to perform this are subject to approval by an organization such as the American Petroleum Institute (API).Custody transfer operations can occur at a number of points along the way; these may include operations, transactions or transferring of oil from an oil production platform to a ship, <b>barge,</b> <b>railcar,</b> truck and also to the final destination point, such as a refinery.|$|R
50|$|Soon after rail service {{began in}} the 1850s, the Lackawanna Railroad built a rail yard {{on the east side}} of the Morris Canal. The yard was {{initially}} used to shift coal from <b>railcars</b> to canal <b>barges.</b> By the turn of the 20th century, however, the canal was little used (it would be abandoned in 1924) and the yard was used primarily to store freight cars. As Lackawanna officials planned a route to shorten travel time from New York City to Buffalo, New York, the yard offered a compelling reason to begin the Cut-Off at Port Morris.|$|R
50|$|Wuhan {{has seven}} bridges and one tunnel across the Yangtze River. The Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge, {{also called the}} First Bridge, was built over the Yangtze River (Chang Jiang) in 1957, {{carrying}} the railroad directly across the river between Snake Hill (on the left in the picture below) and Turtle Hill. Before this bridge was built it could take up to an entire day to <b>barge</b> <b>railcars</b> across. Including its approaches, it is 5,511 ft long, and it accommodates both a double-track railway on a lower deck and a four lane roadway above. It was built {{with the assistance of}} advisers from the Soviet Union.|$|R
5000|$|Bayway Refinery is a {{refining}} {{facility in}} the Port of New York and New Jersey, owned by Phillips 66. Located in Linden and Elizabeth, New Jersey, and bisected by Morses Creek (New Jersey), it is the northernmost refinery on the East Coast of the United States. The oil refinery converts crude oil (supplied by tanker ships from the North Sea, Canada and West Africa and by rail from the Bakken formation in North Dakota) into gasoline, diesel fuel, jet fuel, and heating oil. As of 2007, the facility processed approximately [...] of crude oil, producing [...] of gasoline and [...] of distillates. Its products are delivered to East Coast customers via pipeline transport, <b>barges,</b> <b>railcars</b> and tank trucks.|$|R
40|$|Ammonia {{is found}} {{naturally}} in the environment. The general population {{is most likely}} to be exposed through inhalation of contaminated indoor air, although exposure can also occur through ingestion of contaminated food or water, or through dermal contact. � In indoor air, exposure may occur through use of household products such as window cleaners, floor waxes and smelling salts. � In outdoor air, exposure may occur as a result of gas leaks and spills at production plants and storage facilities or from pipelines, tank trucks, <b>railcars,</b> ships and <b>barges</b> that transport ammonia. � Ammonia is released into the atmosphere naturally by decaying organic matter, animal excreta and volcanic eruptions. It is released anthropogenically through fertilizer usage, spills or leaks, and loss from waste water effluents. Toxicokinetics an...|$|R
50|$|This example, {{located in}} San Francisco, California, south of China Basin was a {{principal}} crew change point for maritime {{operations of the}} Santa Fe Railroad. It {{is no longer in}} use. It remains intact but there are no longer any connecting rails along the shoreline - once the province of the Belt Line Railroad, operated along The Embarcadero by the state of California in support of maritime traffic. This was used extensively in an era when large cargo ships would contain crates or pallets of stores, moved to and from the ship's cargo holds by crews of stevedores and on the docks by crews of longshoremen, with the ship's own spar cranes and winches used for movement. Transport to and from the docks was mostly by rail. Rather than make a long trip down the San Francisco Peninsula, <b>railcars</b> were <b>barged</b> about the bay, both by the Santa Fe and by the Southern Pacific. Southern Pacific eventually replaced their multiple tug and barge system with a single specialized ferryboat. Two ferry slips were used by Santa Fe in San Francisco, here near China Basin, and at the north edge of town near the Maritime Museum. Most traffic would be taken across the bay to Oakland or Richmond for connection with the major transcontinental rail lines, {{with a small amount of}} traffic for California's northern coastal region (the so-called Redwood Empire) passing through a slip at Tiburon on Richardson Bay.|$|R
