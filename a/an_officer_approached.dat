25|$|Witnesses dispute this account, {{saying that}} Tabatabainejad {{had begun to}} walk toward the door with his {{backpack}} when <b>an</b> <b>officer</b> <b>approached</b> him and grabbed his arm, whereupon Tabatabainejad told the officer several times to let go.|$|E
60|$|At {{this moment}} <b>an</b> <b>officer</b> <b>approached</b> the President, saluted and stood rigidly at attention. Davis, with that nice punctilio which marked the Southern army, {{returned}} the salute.|$|E
60|$|The {{men were}} yet praising and thanking us for having come {{at such a}} time, when <b>an</b> <b>officer</b> <b>approached</b> with the word that Colonel Gansevoort wished {{to speak with the}} leaders of the party.|$|E
6000|$|<b>A</b> young <b>officer</b> <b>approached</b> from below, {{climbing}} breathless up the acclivity. Almost {{before he}} had saluted, he gasped out: ...|$|R
60|$|As he rode {{into the}} camp of his {{regiment}} he was unnoticed by the soldiers {{until he reached}} the tents of the officers, before which Colonel Munro was standing talking with several others. On seeing <b>an</b> <b>officer</b> <b>approach</b> in full armour they looked up, and a cry of astonishment broke from them on recognizing Malcolm.|$|R
5000|$|The {{officers}} {{tried to}} execute a PIT maneuver to force his Toyota off the road, but it was unsuccessful. A second PIT maneuver succeeded, and the vehicle crashed into a street curb. <b>As</b> <b>officers</b> <b>approached</b> the vehicle, Barry emerged and lunged at them with the machete and a filet knife, yelling [...] "Allahu Akbar!" [...] He was first tasered by officers, but when this did not stop him, they fired their guns. Barry was shot repeatedly and died of a bullet wound in his neck.|$|R
60|$|Then some of {{the group}} looked anxious, {{and there was a}} stir in the crowd as <b>an</b> <b>officer</b> <b>approached</b> the steps. He had his pistol drawn, but he lowered it, and stood {{opposite}} Don Martin with his hat off.|$|E
60|$|Lieutenant Adrian Searing, {{in command}} of the picket-guard on that part of the line through which his brother Jerome had passed on his mission, sat with {{attentive}} ears in his breastwork behind the line. Not the faintest sound escaped him; the cry of a bird, the barking of a squirrel, the noise of the wind among the pines--all were anxiously noted by his overstrained sense. Suddenly, directly in front of his line, he heard a faint, confused rumble, like the clatter of a falling building translated by distance. The lieutenant mechanically looked at his watch. Six o'clock and eighteen minutes. At the same moment <b>an</b> <b>officer</b> <b>approached</b> him on foot from the rear and saluted.|$|E
5000|$|... “I {{walked into}} the canyon and found Lieutenant Sokol on a road, Ralph Ignatowski close behind. <b>An</b> <b>officer</b> <b>approached</b> me and said, 'Don’t touch them. We may have an atrocity here.’ I {{understand}} Ralph had been bayoneted numerous times; some punctures bled, some did not.” ...|$|E
2500|$|... 20 December 1990: a RUC Reserve Constable (Wilfred Wethers) {{was shot}} dead by an IRA sniper in Waringstown, County Down. The officer was shot eight times by a sniper who was waiting in a nearby field. <b>As</b> the <b>officer</b> <b>approached</b> in his car the gunman opened fire.|$|R
50|$|When {{asked for}} his name, Bush gave a false name. Koester cautioned him about lying about his name {{and that he could}} be charged with {{obstruction}} but Bush lied again to avoid being fined and Koester arrested him. <b>As</b> another <b>officer</b> <b>approached</b> he identified who Bush actually was.|$|R
60|$|<b>As</b> the <b>officer</b> <b>approached</b> he was {{distinguishable}} as a powerful, smooth-faced {{young man}} in a captain's uniform. As his eyes rested on Curtis his plump, red face broke into a broad smile. It was plain that he was Irish, and not averse to a bit of a shindy.|$|R
5000|$|A {{press release}} {{issued by the}} UCPD claims that the {{officers}} [...] "asked Tabatabainejad to leave the premises multiple times", and that Tabatabainejad refused to leave.Witnesses dispute this account, saying that Tabatabainejad had begun to walk toward the door with his backpack when <b>an</b> <b>officer</b> <b>approached</b> him and grabbed his arm, whereupon Tabatabainejad told the officer several times to let go.|$|E
5000|$|On April 3, 2000, Remy called Waltham {{police and}} asked for help with an {{unwanted}} person report. Officers arrived to the scene and found Remy “yelling and screaming” at his mother through her car window. Remy grew more belligerent and when <b>an</b> <b>officer</b> <b>approached</b> Remy to ask him a question, Remy elbowed him in the stomach area {{and told him to}} [...] "fuck off”. He {{was arrested and charged with}} disturbing the peace.|$|E
5000|$|In 1940, {{he enlisted}} in the United States Marine Corps, {{spending}} four years overseas during World War II. [...] Wistert later recalled that he was often confused with his brother Al Wistert who played both college and professional football. In 1982, he told an interviewer that <b>an</b> <b>officer</b> <b>approached</b> him in 1944, [...] "shook my hand and said 'I saw you play in Philly and at Michigan.'" [...] When Wistert explained {{that it was his}} younger brother Albert who had played football, the officer [...] "wiped off his handshake, turned on his heels and walked away." [...] According to Wistert, [...] "that so affronted me that I wrote my kid brother and said I'm {{going to try to get}} back to school." ...|$|E
50|$|On 31 March 1942, {{the nineteenth}} day of Japanese {{occupation}} of the Indies, <b>a</b> Japanese <b>officer</b> <b>approached</b> Mustafa in his prison cell in Ciamis, West Java, and promised to release him on condition that he would help the Japanese. After refusing, both he and Rukhiyat were sent back to Sukamanah.|$|R
50|$|There {{is a huge}} {{risk for}} <b>officers</b> confronting <b>a</b> man seated in his vehicle on a routine traffic stop. “According to a study, {{approximately}} 30% of police shootings occurred when <b>a</b> police <b>officer</b> <b>approached</b> <b>a</b> suspect seated in an automobile.” However one cannot assume that traffic violations are more dangerous than other various confrontations.|$|R
5000|$|Boyd {{eventually}} said {{he would}} depart, picked up some of his possessions, {{and took a step}} downhill. An officer said [...] "Bang him." [...] Sandy threw a flash-bang device at Boyd, and Rick Ingram, the acting ROP sergeant at the site, fired his Taser shotgun, but it did not have any noticeable effect on Boyd. At the same time Weimerskirch sent the dog to bite him, then ran to the dog when it attacked the blue bag rather than Boyd. Startled, Boyd produced the knives again. Perez and Boyd testified that they felt he posed an imminent threat to Weimerskirch. Sandy said he moved closer to cover the dog and its handler. <b>As</b> <b>officers</b> <b>approached,</b> Boyd turned <b>a</b> quarter turn to his left and was shot.|$|R
50|$|Queen Victoria instituted {{the hand}} salute in the Navy to replace {{uncovering}} when she sent for certain officers and men to Osborne House {{to thank them}} for rendering help to a distressed German ship, and {{did not like to}} see men in uniform without headdress.During the age of sail, ships' officers were always worried about mutiny and it therefore became custom that whenever <b>an</b> <b>officer</b> <b>approached,</b> the rating would prove that he was not armed. This was done by knuckling the forehead and later evolved into the modern Navy salute with the hand at 45 degrees palm facing in. The reason that the palm faces in is because sailors' hands were covered in tar from the sheets and rigging and it was considered unseemly to show an officer or a member of the Royal family a dirty palm.|$|E
5000|$|In {{the case}} of Terry v. Ohio, the Supreme Court {{established}} a practical standpoint on “mere questioning”, effectively giving law enforcement officials the ability to speak with citizens, and even search them, in certain situations without necessarily being held accountable to the restrictions of the Fourth Amendment.http://heinonline.org/HOL/Page?handle=hein.journals/swulr15&div=24&g_sent=1&collection=journals In this case, <b>an</b> <b>officer</b> <b>approached</b> three men he suspected of casing a building for a robbery or stick up. He confronted them, questioned them, and {{for the purposes of}} his own safety, patted them down. The officer found that they were carrying concealed weapons, which were later used as evidence that they were about to attempt a robbery. The case hinged on whether the weapons were admissible as evidence under the Fourth Amendment, which protects against unreasonable and warrantless searches and seizures, and prevents evidence collected in such a manner from being used in court. The opinion of the Court was that in lieu of the circumstances, in which the officer had reason to fear for his own safety, the pat-down was reasonable and did not constitute a search to which the Fourth Amendment is applicable. Specifically, the Court held that “Though the police must, whenever practicable, secure a warrant to make a search and seizure, that procedure cannot be followed where swift action based upon on-the-spot observations of the officer on the beat is required” and “The reasonableness of any particular search and seizure must be assessed in light of the particular circumstances against the standard of whether a man of reasonable caution is warranted in believing that the action taken was appropriate.”https://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/historics/USSC_CR_0392_0001_ZS.html While these particular circumstances warranted a search based on the safety of the officer, the decision of the Court allowed for a greater freedom of officers to confront and question individuals in other situations. The Supreme Court has frequently referenced Terry v. Ohio and the principle of “mere questioning” in later cases, including INS v. Delgado.http://heinonline.org/HOL/Page?handle=hein.journals/swulr15&div=24&g_sent=1&collection=journals The most important formulation of the principle as it relates to Delgado is that “law enforcement officials can approach and speak to individuals without the constraints of the Fourth Amendment’s reasonableness standard, so long as the encounter is consensual.”http://heinonline.org/HOL/Page?handle=hein.journals/swulr15&div=24&g_sent=1&collection=journals ...|$|E

5000|$|The deputies {{had been}} shot in what they thought {{was going to be a}} routine stop to help a motorist. They stopped to assist the driver of a pickup truck. The rear of the truck was {{blocking}} part of the road, while its front bumper was up against a red car parked in a rutted turn-around area. <b>As</b> the <b>officers</b> <b>approached,</b> their assailant said, [...] "We need a jump." ...|$|R
50|$|On May 15, 1916, {{a guilty}} verdict and a death {{sentence}} were announced at Waco's courthouse for Jesse Washington, a seventeen-year-old black farmhand, in complicity {{of the murder of}} Lucy Fryer, who was found dead seven days earlier. Attendees crowded the courthouse and sidewalks in anticipation of the trial; the crowd of about 2,000 spectators were almost entirely white aside from a few members of the city's black community. <b>As</b> <b>officers</b> <b>approached</b> Washington to escort him out of the courtroom, spectators pushed them aside and forcibly dragged Washington outside. Amid a growing mob, a chain was wrapped around Washington's neck, and he was stripped and beaten as he was taken to city hall. A bonfire was prepared next to a tree; doused in oil, Washington was repeatadly lowered into the flames and slowly burned to death in front of nearly 15,000 onlookers.|$|R
25|$|Later {{in the day}} <b>a</b> Norwegian <b>officer</b> <b>approached</b> Schmidt {{asking for}} his surrender, but was rejected. The Norwegian 40mm AA gun kept up a {{bombardment}} of Lindse Farms throughout the day, firing 40–50 rounds at positions around the farm buildings and in two nearby ravines. By evening the Germans had all sought shelter in the farm houses as these could not be bombarded directly due to the Norwegian prisoners being held there.|$|R
50|$|The defendant, Mr. Fagan, {{was in his}} {{car when}} <b>a</b> police <b>officer</b> <b>approached</b> {{him and told him}} to move his car. In {{accordance}} with the directions, Fagan backed his car up, accidentally rolling it onto the foot of the officer. When the officer yelled at him to move his car off his foot, he cursed back at him, told him to wait, and refused to move, which was an act of defiance.|$|R
50|$|Anil Bordia's name {{featured}} in an administrative litigation, when J. C. Jetli, <b>a</b> senior IAS <b>officer,</b> <b>approached</b> the Central Administrative Tribunal, against Bordia's appointment as a Government Secretary, superseding Jetli's claims. The case precipitated a CAT judgment asking the Central Government {{to lay down}} norms and guidelines for the appointment of cabinet secretaries.|$|R
50|$|Meanwhile, two {{officers}} dressed in plainclothes were patrolling {{the area in}} an unmarked car. They {{were members of the}} District of Columbia’s Vice Squad and were assigned to the area; they noticed the suspicious vehicle pulled over at a stop sign for about 20 seconds. The passenger was distracting the driver. <b>As</b> the <b>officers</b> <b>approached</b> the vehicle, the vehicle turned at an “unreasonable” speed without using their turning signal. For the traffic violation, the officers pulled over Whren and Brown.|$|R
5000|$|Manmath Nath Gupta {{joined the}} Indian {{nationalist}} movement {{as early as}} the age of 13 years. In 1921, he was distributing pamphlets in the Gadolia area of Benares calling for a boycott of the reception of the Edward, Prince of Wales by the Maharaja of Banares. When <b>a</b> police <b>officer</b> <b>approached</b> him, he stood his ground instead of running away. During the court proceedings, he told the judge, [...] "I will not cooperate with you." [...] He was jailed for three months.|$|R
60|$|That {{last name}} seemed to stun Madeline. She heard no more, and saw little until the car stopped. Nels spoke to some one. Then sight of khaki-clad {{soldiers}} quickened Madeline's faculties. She {{was on the}} boundary-line between the United States and Mexico, and Agua Prieta, with its white and blue walled houses, its brown-tiled roofs, lay before her. A soldier, evidently despatched by Nels, returned and said <b>an</b> <b>officer</b> would come at once. Madeline's attention was centered in the foreground, upon the guard over the road, upon the dry, dusty town beyond; but {{she was aware of}} noise and people in the rear. <b>A</b> cavalry <b>officer</b> <b>approached</b> the car, stared, and removed his sombrero.|$|R
25|$|For the besiegers desperate {{measures}} {{were to be}} made; at nightfall <b>an</b> English <b>officer</b> <b>approached</b> the bastion with a flag of truce. This was a ruse - behind him in the dark Norrey's English soldiers quietly approached hoping {{to take advantage of}} the situation. The ruse was successful - they then threw themselves at the breach and this time swept in, overwhelming the Spanish in desperate hand-to-hand fighting. The Spanish fought bravely but were all eventually put to the sword; no quarter was given even if there were women and children inside.|$|R
50|$|In {{the climactic}} {{scene of the}} 1976 film Taxi Driver {{directed}} by Martin Scorsese the heavily wounded protagonist Travis Bickle (played by Robert De Niro) after a gunfight in a brothel, surrounded by the police forces attempts several times to fire a bullet into his own head from under his chin, but all his weapons are out of ammunition, so he instead resigns himself to resting on a sofa and when <b>a</b> police <b>officer</b> <b>approaches</b> him he ″shoots″ himself {{several times in the}} left forehead using the finger gun gesture.|$|R
5000|$|The battle lasted 18 minutes. Unable {{or unwilling}} to mount any sort of unified resistance, Mexican {{soldiers}} and officers fled for their lives. Texian commanders were unable {{to gain control of}} their troops, and the slaughter continued until dusk. [...] Some sources claim that <b>a</b> Mexican <b>officer</b> <b>approached</b> Menchaca. The two had known each other in Béxar. The officer begged Menchaca to intercede for him, as a [...] "brother Mexican". Menchaca yelled back at him [...] "No, damn you, I'm no Mexican - I'm an American!" [...] and shouted for Anglos nearby to shoot him.|$|R
6000|$|... "I will go down," [...] Rupert said, [...] "and put the saddles on quietly. The stable opens {{into the}} street behind. There is {{a flight of stairs}} {{at the end of the}} long passage here, which leads down into a passage below, at the end of which is a door into the stable yard. I have just been {{examining}} it. I should recommend Adele to put on her things, and to be in readiness, and then to remain in her room. If you keep a watch here, you will see everyone coming down the street, and the moment you see <b>an</b> <b>officer</b> <b>approaching,</b> if you will lock the door outside and take the key with you, then call Adele, and come down the back stairs with her into the yard, I will have the horses in readiness. There is only one man in the stable. A crown piece will make him shut his eyes as we ride out, and they will be five minutes at the door before they find that we have gone." ...|$|R

500|$|<b>A</b> Confederate <b>officer</b> <b>approached</b> Capehart's 3rd Brigade {{on horseback}} under a flag of truce. Capehart and the officer rode down the column to General Custer, where the officer told the general that Lee and Grant were in {{correspondence}} concerning a surrender of Lee's Army. The Confederate <b>officer</b> also requested <b>a</b> truce until {{the results of}} the negotiation were known. Custer's response was [...] "Tell General Longstreet that I am not in command of all the forces here, but that I am on his flank and rear with a large cavalry force, and that I will accept nothing but unconditional surrender." ...|$|R
50|$|In mid-October 1939, {{a little-known}} game {{took place in}} Starosielce {{in the suburbs of}} Białystok. Soviet troops, which had entered the area a few weeks before, decided {{that there would be a}} {{football}} match between Polish team of Starosielce and a Red Army team from a unit stationed in nearby Choroszcz. After first half, despite several brutal fauls of Soviet players and partisan refereeing, the Poles were winning 2-0. During the break, <b>an</b> NKVD <b>officer</b> <b>approached</b> the manager of the Poles, telling him that Poles had to lose. Thus, the match ended in a 3-2 Soviet win.|$|R
