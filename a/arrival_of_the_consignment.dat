40|$|Logistics faces great {{challenges}} in vehicle schedule problem. Intelligence Technologies {{need to be}} developed for solving the transportation problem. This paper proposes an improved Quantum-Inspired Evolutionary Algorithm (IQEA), which is a hybrid algorithm of Quantum-Inspired Evolutionary Algorithm (QEA) and greed heuristics. It extends the standard QEA by combining its principles with some heuristics methods. The proposed algorithm has also been applied to optimize a problem which may happen in real life. The problem can be categorized as a vehicle routing problem with time windows (VRPTW), which means the problem has many common characteristics that VRPTW has, but more constraints need to be considered. <b>The</b> basic idea <b>of</b> <b>the</b> proposed IQEA is to embed a greed heuristic method into the standard QEA for <b>the</b> optimal recombination <b>of</b> <b>consignment</b> subsequences. <b>The</b> <b>consignment</b> sequence is <b>the</b> order to arrange the vehicles for <b>the</b> transportation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>consignments.</b> <b>The</b> <b>consignment</b> subsequences are generated by cutting <b>the</b> whole <b>consignment</b> sequence according to <b>the</b> values <b>of</b> quantum bits. <b>The</b> computational result <b>of</b> <b>the</b> simulation problem shows that IQEA is feasible in achieving a relatively optimal solution. <b>The</b> implementation <b>of</b> an optimized schedule can save much more cost than the initial schedule. It provides a promising, innovative approach for solving VRPTW and improves QEA for solving complexity problems with a number of constraints. Department of Industrial and Systems Engineerin...|$|R
