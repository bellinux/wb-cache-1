5|$|Only the <b>aye-aye,</b> the extinct giant <b>aye-aye,</b> and {{the largest}} of the extinct giant sloth lemurs lack a {{functional}} strepsirrhine toothcomb. In the case of the <b>aye-aye,</b> the morphology of the deciduous incisors, which are lost shortly after birth, indicate that its ancestors had a toothcomb. These milk teeth are lost shortly after birth and are replaced by open-rooted, continually growing (hypselodont) incisors.|$|E
5|$|The <b>aye-aye</b> {{is almost}} universally viewed unfavorably across Madagascar, though the tales vary from village to village and region to region. If people see an <b>aye-aye,</b> they may kill it and hang the corpse on a pole near a road {{outside of town}} (so others can carry the bad {{fortunes}} away) or burn their village and move. The superstitions behind <b>aye-aye</b> fady include beliefs that they kill and eat chickens or people, that they kill people in their sleep by cutting their aortic vein, that they embody ancestral spirits, or that they warn of illness, death, or bad luck in the family. As of 1970, {{the people of the}} Marolambo District in the Toamasina Province feared the <b>aye-aye</b> because they believed it had supernatural powers. Because of this, no one was allowed to mock, kill, or eat one.|$|E
5|$|A few lemurs {{have been}} noted to have {{relatively}} large brains. The extinct Hadropithecus was {{as large as a}} large male baboon and had a comparably sized brain, giving it the largest brain size relative to body size among all prosimians. The <b>aye-aye</b> also has a large brain-to-body ratio, which may indicate a higher level of intelligence. However, despite having a built-in tool in the form of its thin, elongated middle finger, which it uses to fish for insect grubs, the <b>aye-aye</b> has tested poorly in the use of extraneous tools.|$|E
50|$|<b>Aye-ayes,</b> being nocturnal, build oval-shaped nests {{from nearby}} {{branches}} and lianas for day time use. These may {{be built in}} a tangle of lianas or in a fork of a tree, at a height of 7 to 20 m above the ground. These nests may be re-used by other <b>aye-ayes</b> once the original occupant moves on. A single occupant uses a nest for a few days, refreshing it regularly with fresh vegetation. <b>Aye-ayes</b> build and use many nests—during one study, 8 <b>aye-ayes</b> were recorded to build and use {{as many as a}} hundred different nests over a period of 2 years.|$|R

5|$|Lemur {{taxonomy}} {{has changed}} significantly {{since the first}} taxonomic classification of lemurs by Carl Linnaeus in 1758. One {{of the greatest challenges}} has been the classification of the <b>aye-aye,</b> which has been a topic of debate up until very recently. Until Richard Owen published a definitive anatomical study in 1866, early naturalists were uncertain whether the <b>aye-aye</b> (genus Daubentonia) was a primate, rodent, or marsupial. However, the placement of the <b>aye-aye</b> within the order Primates remained problematic until very recently. Based on its anatomy, researchers have found support for classifying the genus Daubentonia as a specialized indriid, a sister group to all strepsirrhines, and as an indeterminate taxon within the order Primates. Molecular tests have now shown Daubentoniidae is basal to all Lemuriformes, and in 2008, Russell Mittermeier, Colin Groves, and others ignored addressing higher-level taxonomy by defining lemurs as monophyletic and containing five living families, including Daubentoniidae.|$|E
5|$|Only eight {{species of}} lemur {{are known to}} be seed predators (granivores), but this may be under-reported since most {{observations}} only report fruit consumption and do not investigate whether the seeds are consumed as well. These lemurs include some indriids, such as the diademed sifaka (Propithecus diadema), the golden-crowned sifaka (Propithecus tattersalli), the indri, and the <b>aye-aye.</b> The <b>aye-aye,</b> which specializes in structurally defended resources, can chew through Canarium seeds, which are harder than the seeds that New World monkeys are known to break open. At least 36genera from 23families of plants are targeted by lemur seed predators.|$|E

40|$|The {{ability of}} 6 captive <b>aye-ayes</b> (Daubentonia madagascariensis) to {{discriminate}} scents from conspecifics of different age-sex classes was tested. The animals {{were presented with}} either unscented logs or logs that had been placed in: (1) their own cage, (2) the cages of adult males or (3) the cages of adult females with female offspring. Responses to the logs, measured by approaching, proximity, tapping, gnawing, sniffing, scent marking and vocalizations, were recorded for 30 min following presentation. Logs from females with offspring provoked the highest responses, and immature <b>aye-ayes</b> investigated logs more than adults of either sex. These results suggest that, {{as in many other}} prosimians, olfaction {{plays an important role in}} the communication systems of <b>aye-ayes...</b>|$|R
25|$|Young <b>aye-ayes</b> {{typically}} are silver colored on their front {{and have a}} stripe down their back. However, as the <b>aye-ayes</b> begin to reach maturity, their bodies will be completely covered in thick fur and are typically not one solid color. On the head and back, {{the ends of the}} hair are typically tipped with white {{while the rest of the}} body will ordinarily be a yellow and/or brown color.|$|R
5|$|Except for the <b>aye-aye</b> and the Lac Alaotra gentle lemur, lemurs are {{seasonal}} breeders {{with very}} short mating and birth seasons {{influenced by the}} highly seasonal availability of resources in their environment. Mating seasons usually last {{less than three weeks}} each year, with the female vagina opening up only during a few hours or days of her most receptive time of estrus. These narrow windows for reproduction and resource availability appear to relate to their short gestation periods, rapid maturation, and low basal metabolic rates, as well as the high energy costs of reproduction for females. This may also relate to the relatively high mortality rate among adult females and the higher proportion of adult males in some lemur populations—both unusual traits among primates. In both the <b>aye-aye</b> and Lac Alaotra gentle lemur, birth (parturition) occurs over a six-month period.|$|E
5|$|In the <b>aye-aye,</b> the sublingua is not {{shaped like}} a brush like it is in most lemurs. Instead, there is a {{thickened}} area along the plica mediana or lytta which has a hook-shaped structure on the end. Within cheirogaleids, the sublingua lacks cartilage, and the sublingua of the gray mouse lemur has a distinct plica mediana and ends in two lobe-like projections that lack keratinized serrations, but have three keratinized ridges which make the sublingua rigid.|$|E
5|$|The pinna helps {{direct sound}} through {{the ear canal}} to the eardrum. The complex {{geometry}} of ridges on the inner surface of some mammalian ears helps to sharply focus sounds produced by prey, using echolocation signals. These ridges {{can be regarded as}} the acoustic equivalent of a fresnel lens, and may be seen {{in a wide range of}} animals, including the bat, <b>aye-aye,</b> lesser galago, bat-eared fox, mouse lemur and others.|$|E

40|$|<b>Aye-ayes</b> possess highly adapted hands, {{using their}} {{specialized}} third digits to investigate potential food sources by tapping {{and the third}} or fourth digits to transfer food to the mouth. Observations were conducted on 11 captive <b>aye-ayes</b> (10 -wild caught; 1 captive-bred) following presentation of food or novel objects, and hand use for holding, tapping and digit-feeding was scored. Eight of the individuals showed significant hand preferences for {{one or more of the}} 3 measures, although there was no consistent pattern. These preliminary results are compared to those from other lemur species...|$|R
50|$|The Twilight Cave is a {{walk-through}} exhibit containing free-flying Rodrigues fruit {{bats and}} Seba's leaf nosed bats. Nocturnal exhibits within {{this area are}} home to <b>aye-ayes</b> and Malagasy giant rats.|$|R
5|$|Although it is {{generally}} agreed that the <b>aye-aye</b> is the most basal member of the lemur clade, {{the relationship between the}} other four families is less clear since they diverged during a narrow 10 to 12million-year window between the Late Eocene (42mya) and into the Oligocene (30mya). Although all studies place Cheirogaleidae and Lepilemuridae as a sister clade to Indriidae and Lemuridae, some suggest that Cheirogaleidae and Lepilemuridae diverged first, while others suggest that Indriidae and Lemuridae were the first to branch off.|$|E
5|$|The {{classification}} of lemurs within the suborder Strepsirrhini is equally controversial, although {{most experts agree}} on the same phylogenetic tree. In one taxonomy, the infraorder Lemuriformes contains all living strepsirrhines in two superfamilies, Lemuroidea for all lemurs and Lorisoidea for the lorisoids (lorisids and galagos). Alternatively, the lorisoids are sometimes placed in their own infraorder, Lorisiformes, separate from the lemurs. In another taxonomy published by Colin Groves, the <b>aye-aye</b> was placed in its own infraorder, Chiromyiformes, {{while the rest of}} the lemurs were placed in Lemuriformes and the lorisoids in Lorisiformes.|$|E
5|$|Bark {{and plant}} exudates such as tree sap are {{consumed}} {{by a few}} lemur species. The exploitation of exudates {{has been reported in}} 18 plant species and only in the dry regions in the south and west of Madagascar. Only the Masoala fork-marked lemur (Phaner furcifer) and Coquerel's giant mouse lemur regularly consume tree sap. Bark has never been reported as an important food item in lemur diets, but at least four species eat it: the <b>aye-aye,</b> the red-tailed sportive lemur (Lepilemur ruficaudatus), the common brown lemur (Eulemur fulvus), and Verreaux's sifaka (Propithecus verreauxi). Most bark feeding is directly linked to exudate feeding, except for the aye-aye's bark feeding on Afzelia bijuga (genus Afzelia) at Nosy Mangabe in the northeast.|$|E

50|$|A major {{renovation}} {{project was to}} transform the Walled Gardens into an area marked Kirindy Forest. Based on the dry forests of Madagascar, the area is designed to showcase the work being done with the native species. There are new homes for the <b>aye-ayes,</b> giant jumping rats and mongooses, and a new walkthrough aviary.|$|R
5|$|In the <b>aye-aye,</b> {{which has}} {{replaced}} the toothcomb by evolving continually growing, rodent-like incisors, the hook-shaped tip of the sublingua fits precisely within {{the gap between the}} two lower incisors and keeps the area clean. Tarsiers lack a toothcomb, which may explain why their sublingua lacks the serrations typically found on the sublingua of lemuriforms. Although colugos also have a toothcomb, consisting of serrated edges on the tips of their incisors instead of finely spaced, elongated teeth, {{they do not have a}} sublingua. Instead, their toothcomb is cleaned by the tongue, which has serrated edges at the front that match the serrations on the incisors.|$|E
5|$|Little {{is known}} about the {{extinction}} of Plesiorycteropus, but MacPhee assumed it may have happened around 1000 years ago, when the extinction {{of the rest of the}} subfossil fauna of Madagascar is thought to have concluded. Nothing like it was reported by 17th-century European explorers of the island, and one bone has been radiocarbon dated to around 2150 Before Present (200 BCE). Its extinction is somewhat anomalous, as other recently extinct Madagascan animals—such as subfossil lemurs, Malagasy hippopotamuses, the giant fossa, and elephant birds—were generally larger and not exclusively insectivorous; also, some species with likely more specialized diets, such as the falanouc (Eupleres goudoti) and <b>aye-aye</b> (Daubentonia madagascariensis), did survive. Early human colonists of Madagascar may have caused the extinction of Plesiorycteropus through the destruction of the forest and other disturbances.|$|E
5|$|Most {{primates}} {{have two}} mammary glands, {{but the number}} and positions vary between species within strepsirrhines. Lorises have two pairs, while others, like the ring-tailed lemur, have one pair on the chest (pectoral). The <b>aye-aye</b> also has two mammary glands, but they are located near the groin (inguinal). In females, the clitoris is sometimes enlarged and pendulous, resembling the male penis, which can make sex identification difficult for human observers. The clitoris may also have a bony structure in it, similar to the baculum (penis bone) in males. Most male primates have a baculum, but it is typically larger in strepsirrhines and usually forked at the tip.|$|E

50|$|Opened in March 2015, In {{with the}} Lemurs is a {{walk-through}} exhibit housing {{a troop of}} ten ring-tailed lemurs. It also has a family of <b>aye-ayes</b> living in the indoor section as well as panther chameleons, lesser hedgehog tenrecs and malagasy giant rats. The exhibit is designed to resemble a shrub forest in Madagascar, featuring plant life such as loquat and Chusan palm trees.|$|R
5|$|Reproduction {{starts in}} November for Coquerel's giant mouse lemur at Kirindy Forest; the estrous cycle runs {{approximately}} 22days, while estrus lasts {{only a day}} or less. The mating season in this southern population {{is limited to a}} few weeks, whereas the northern giant mouse lemur is thought to breed throughout the year, a trend seen in only two other species of lemur: the <b>aye-aye</b> (Daubentonia madagascariensis) and the red-bellied lemur (Eulemur rubriventer). The northern giant mouse lemur had been observed breeding year-round in captivity if their litter did not survive or was removed, but at the time this population was thought to be Coquerel's giant mouse lemur.|$|E
5|$|The dentary superficially {{resembles that}} of various other {{mammalian}} groups with enlarged incisors, such as rodents, lagomorphs, hyraxes, wombats, the <b>aye-aye,</b> and the extinct apatemyids, tillodonts, and taeniodontsall of which are known only from the Cenozoic, less than 66 million years ago. Krause and colleagues could not exclude the possibility that TNM02067 represents an early member of such a group or an otherwise unknown major group of mammals. However, only two groups of Mesozoic mammals resemble TNM02067: gondwanatheres; and multituberculates in the superfamilies Djadochtatherioidea and Taeniolabidoidea. Djadochtatherioids and taeniolabidoids occur in the late Cretaceous through Paleogene of the northern continents (Laurasia), and gondwanatheres, an enigmatic group of uncertain evolutionary affinities, are known from the late Cretaceous through Paleogene of Gondwana, with forms such as Gondwanatherium, Sudamerica (both from Argentina), Lavanify (Madagascar), and Bharattherium (India).|$|E
5|$|The {{gestation}} period varies within lemurs, ranging from 9 weeks in mouse lemurs and 9–10weeks in dwarf lemurs to 18–24weeks in other lemurs. The smaller, nocturnal lemurs, such as mouse lemurs, giant mouse lemurs, and dwarf lemurs, usually {{give birth to}} more than one infant, whereas the larger, nocturnal lemurs, such as fork-marked lemurs, sportive lemurs, and the <b>aye-aye</b> usually have one offspring. Dwarf and mouse lemurs have up to four offspring, but both average only two. Ruffed lemurs are the only large, diurnal lemurs to consistently give birth to two or three offspring. All other lemurs have single births. Multiple births in lemurs are normally fraternal, and are known to occur in every five to six births in species such as the ring-tailed lemur and some Eulemur.|$|E
2500|$|The genus Daubentonia {{was named}} after the French naturalist Louis-Jean-Marie Daubenton by his student, Étienne Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire, in 1795. [...] Initially Geoffroy {{considering}} using the Greek name Scolecophagus ("worm-eater") in reference to its eating habits, but he decided against {{it because he was}} uncertain about the <b>aye-aye's</b> habits and whether other related species might eventually be discovered. [...] In 1863, British zoologist John Edward Gray coined the family name Daubentoniidae.|$|R
50|$|All prosimians possess two {{laterally}} flattened toilet claws, {{used for}} grooming. These {{can be found}} on the second toe in lemurs and lorises, and the second and third in tarsiers. <b>Aye-ayes</b> have functional claws on all other digits except the hallux, including a toilet claw on the second toe. Clawlike nails are however also found in the small-bodied callitrichids, a group of New World monkeys, though none of them have a toilet claw.|$|R
2500|$|The adapiforms are early {{primates}} {{which are}} known {{only from the}} fossil record, and {{it is unclear whether}} they form a suborder proper or a paraphyletic grouping. They are usually grouped under Strepsirrhini—including lemurs, <b>aye-ayes</b> and lorisoids—and as such would not be ancestral to Haplorrhini, which includes tarsiers and simians. Simians are usually called [...] "anthropoid": while this term can be confusing, the paper uses it, as does associated publicity material. Simians (anthropoids) include monkeys and apes, which in turn includes humans.|$|R
