25|$|Shortly {{after the}} death of Berdella's father, his mother remarried. This act was met with resentment by her older son, who viewed the move as a form of {{betrayal}} against his father. As a result, Berdella became increasingly withdrawn, and further immersed himself in the solitary activities he had participated in since childhood such as painting, collecting coins and stamps, and writing to foreign pen pals. Berdella would later claim that his hobby of writing to pen pals in countries such as Vietnam and Burma and the fact these pen pals would send him stamps for his collection, and photographs of mythical and historical icons, ancient cultures, and architecture would lead to his developing an avid interest in primitive <b>art,</b> <b>photographs,</b> and antiques. From approximately 1965, he would begin avidly collecting these artifacts; this practice would later inspire him to open his own business in 1982.|$|E

25|$|Interest in Bate Tichenor's {{paintings}} by art collectors and museums {{has been increasing}} in recent years, as well as collections of <b>art</b> <b>photographs</b> with her as the subject. Her paintings were first sold in 1954 by the Ines Amor Gallery in Mexico City, and then later by her patron, the late Mexican art dealer and collector Antonio de Souza at the Galeria Souza in the Paseo de la Reforma, Mexico City. In 1955, the Karning Gallery, directed by Robert Isaacson, represented her. In 1972 and 1974 she exhibited at the Galeria Pecanins, Colonia Roma, Mexico City. A comprehensive retrospective exhibition {{was held at the}} Instituto de Bellas Artes de San Miguel de Allende in February 1990, nine months before her death. She left 200 paintings that were divided between Pedro Friedeberg and the de Laborde-Noguez family. Her works became a part of important international private and museum collections in the United States, Mexico and Europe that included the Churchill and Rockefeller families. They were sought after for their refined esoteric nature with detail in master painting technique.|$|E
2500|$|The Victoria and Albert Museum's Word and Image Department {{was under}} the same {{pressure}} being felt in archives around the world, to digitise their collection. [...] A large scale digitisation project began in 2007 in that department. That project was entitled the Factory Project to reference Andy Warhol {{and to create a}} factory to completely digitise the collection. [...] The first step of the Factory Project was to take photographs using digital cameras. [...] The Word and Image Department had a collection of old photos but they were in black and white and in variant conditions, so new photos were shot. [...] Those new photographs will be accessible to researchers to the Victoria and Albert Museum web-site. [...] 15,000 images were taken {{during the first year of}} the Factory Project, including drawings, watercolors, computer-generated <b>art,</b> <b>photographs,</b> posters, and woodcuts. [...] The second step of the Factory Project is to catalogue everything. The third step of the Factory Project is to audit the collection. [...] All of those items which were photographed and catalogued, must be audited to make sure everything listed as being in the collection was physically found during the creation of the Factory Project. [...] The fourth goal of the Factory Project is conservation, which means performing some basic preventable procedures to those items in the department. [...] There is a [...] "Search the Collections" [...] feature on the Victoria and Albert web-site. [...] The main impetus behind the large-scale digitisation project called the Factory Project was to list more items in the collections in those computer databases.|$|E
