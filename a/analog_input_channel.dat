We will compare current and voltage transformers, current sensor – based on Rogowski coil, voltage sensor – based on voltage divider. By this measure devices, we can monitoring values of analog quantities in medium voltage switchgear. It is impossible to compare, measure and analyze without this measure devices. There is protection terminal REF 542 plus, which can compile this values. The REF 542 plus ability are measuring, monitoring, remote control and protection.

It enables {{the development of a}} wide range of high performance analog ICs capable of 33 V operation in a footprint that no previous generation of high voltage parts could achieve. Unlike analog ICs using conventional CMOS processes, iCMOS components can accept bipolar input signals while providing increased performance, dramatically reduced power consumption, and reduced package size. The AD 7321 can accept true bipolar analog input signals. The AD 7321 has four software-selectable input ranges, ± 10 V, ± 5 V, ± 2. 5 V, and 0 V to + 10 V. Each <b>analog</b> <b>input</b> <b>channel</b> is independently programmed to one of the four input ranges. The analog input channels on the AD 7321 are programmed to be single-ended, true differential, or pseudo differential. The ADC contains a 2. 5 V internal reference. The AD 7321 also allows for external reference operation. If a 3 V reference is applied to the REFIN/OUT pin, the AD 7321 can accept a true bipolar ± 12 V analog input. A minimum of ± 12 V VDD and VSS supplies are required for the ± 12 V input range. The ADC has a high speed serial interface that can operate at throughput rates up to 500 kSPS...|$|E
