40|$|Tese de doutoramento, Ciências Biotecnológicas, Faculdade de Ciências e Tecnologia, Universidade do Algarve, 2016 All {{over the}} years {{scientists}} have studied an extensive range of medicinal and aromatic plants species which exist in nature and contain an unlimited category of bioactive compounds that could potentially be used within an extensive range of products including nutraceutical; pharmaceutical and even cosmetic. This {{seems to be more}} substantial since scientists have detected an extensive range of negative adverse effects among many of the synthetic compounds commonly used today. In this research, we have selected plants which, are particularly well known among people as being healthy and could have therapeutic for chronic and acute diseases. Therefore, after the precise researches and discussions with native residents of the selected regions-including the northwest of Iran and south Portugal, with focus on the Algarve, about 14 different plant species were selected and identified for this research. Among them, different individual parts of plants including seeds (Portugues and Iranian Pimpinella anisum L., with Coriandrum sativum L., and Levisticum officinale W. D. J. Koch., from Iran); flowers (Echium amoenum Fisch & C. A. Mey., Echinacea angustifolia DC., Matricaria chamomilla L., and <b>Althaea</b> <b>officinalis</b> <b>L.,</b> from Iran); leaves (Thymus vulgaris L., Rosmarinus officinalis L., Salvia officinalis L., and Alisma plantago-aquatica L. subsp. orientale (Sam.) Sam., from Iran and Olea europaea L. var. sylvestris., from Portugal) have been studied. Moreover the aerial parts of Lavandula pedunculata L. subsp. pedunculata., from Portugal were selected and studied in this research. An extensive range of in vitro chemical and microbial experiments as well as optimization of different variables in the extraction process and encapsulation efficiency of the bioactive compounds have been performed on the different species of plants. Initially, the research intended to study the encapsulation of two of the selected plants’ infusions including Olea europaea., and Alisma plantago-aquatica., with the preparation of calcium-alginate beads in combine of potato starch as a filling substance to study and optimise the release kinetics and encapsulation efficiency of the bioactive compounds in deionised water and simulated gastric fluid (SGF) (as solvents) respectively for each plant. The results confirmed the positive role of the potato starch, in a particular concentration, in the monitoring of release kinetics of phenols from the CAS (Calcium Alginate Starch) beads. On the other hand, the performance of the applied models of Response Surface Methodology (RSM) and Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) on the optimisation of the release kinetics and encapsulation efficiency of the bioactive compounds from the encapsulated infusion in simulated gastric fluid (SGF) as the solvent was compared, and the ANN design was reported as the more accurate tool compared to RSM in the prediction of the optimum range of the selected independent parameters including potato starch as one of the variables. Portugues P. anisum., seeds was selected to optimise the extraction process of the bioactive compounds regarding the two selected independent variables, including the time and temperature of extraction using water as a solvent. Maximum desirability was obtained for. − and TMA parameters. Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis was performed on P. anisum., seeds’ infusion to determine the major compounds profile. The obtained results demonstrated that, fatty acids with indicating 47. 68 % of the whole detected compounds are the most detected predominant compounds found in the tested extracts followed by triterpenoids; among fatty acids, linoleic acid in combine of oleic and palmitic acids were detected as major compounds. In the current research, the authors also detected bioactive compound content alongside different anti-oxidant parameters of 10 different plants’ infusions picked from Iran. In this regard, total phenolic content (TPC); total flavonoid content (TFC); total chlorophyll content (TCC) values along with total anti-oxidant activity (TAA); reducing power (RP); ferric reducing anti-oxidant power (FRAP); ABTS free radical inhibition and the DPPH free radical scavenging activity of different plants species were determined. The extraction of the bioactive compounds was performed using different pathways; firstly: hot aqueous infusions were obtained at 90 ºC within 5 minutes’ extraction time and cold aqueous extracts were obtained at room temperature within 2 hours blending. Most of the achieved values for the hot infusions were significantly higher compared to cold aqueous extracts. In some cases, a few exceptions were found in P. anisum., and L. officinale., species (seeds) justified by their tough and wooden textures (abnormality in extraction). The Pearson correlation coefficient established that the highest anti-oxidant parameters are related to phenols; chlorophylls and eventual further bioactive compound existence such as triterpenoids; fatty acids; sterols or others rather than flavonoids and further bioactive compounds. On the other hand, synergistic activity hypothesis among at least two or more compounds were proposed. Mostly, the examined leaves, particularly T. vulgaris., presented higher bioactivity than the other studied seeds and flowers species in this research. Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis was used in the identification of the bioactive compounds in the leaves and two seeds. The achieved results demonstrated an extensive range of compounds with eventual bioactivity including: fatty acids; fatty alcohols; sterols; triterpenoids; monoacylglycerols; aromatics; alkanes; waxes; di-acids; α-hydroxy fatty acids and sugars. It has been observed that in the leaves triterpenoids combined with sterols are the most abundant compounds demonstrating 63. 42; 47. 64 and 33. 51 % of the total characterised compounds respectively in R. officinalis., S. officinalis., and T. vulgaris., while in the seeds, fatty acids were discovered as the most predominant compounds, expressing 80. 22, 49. 04 and 47. 68 % of the specified compounds in Iranian C. sativum., and P. anisum from Iran and from Portugal., respectively. Betulinic, maslinic, ursolic and oleanolic acids were the most predominant triterpenoids in the leaves and oleic, palmitic and linoleic acids were identified as the most abundant fatty acid content in the seeds. The obtained results proposed that in the plants, the synergistic effects among different bioactive compounds might be expected. According to the characterised and identified bioactive compounds of the plants’ infusions in this study and their established potential health benefits, it could be expected that these plants might demonstrate further potential health benefits for human body such as anti-carcinogenic, anti-diabetic, anti-Alzheimer’s, anti-Parkinson’s, or others. Therefore, this research expanded the research and studied the potential health benefits including anti-bacterial and in vitro anti-diabetic, as well as anti-Alzheimer’s disease, along with anti-radical and further anti-oxidant properties of the plants. Finally the relations between the achieved in vitro results with the characterised compounds of the Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (GC-MS) were interpreted. Selected leaves’ water infusions also were detected as stronger inhibitors in supressing of the enzymes attributed in revealing of diabetes and Alzheimer’s diseases. The anti-bacterial potential of some of the plants against five different bacterial species showed that the selected Iranian plants, except E. angustifolia., (flower) inhibited E. faecalis in MIC value ≤ 0. 156 mg. mL- 1, while other bacterial species showed activities in MIC values ≤ 10 mg. mL- 1. Among flowers M. chamomilla., and among leaves S. officinalis., alongside R. officinalis., revealed slightly higher anti-bacterial activities than others. Alongside the abovementioned studies this research also studied the modelling of the extraction of monomeric anthocyanins using microwave assisted extraction (MAE) from L. pedunculata., picked in Algarve-Portugal. Three independent variables were selected for two responses including TAA and TMA values, among variables microwave power showed 465 W as the optimized value for the extraction of monomeric anthocyanins. In the final of this study, the inhibitory activities of Portugues P. anisum., seeds’ infusion against α-Amylase and Acetylcholinesterase (AChE) were determined, confirming the eventual anti-oxidant; anti-diabetic and anti-Alzheimer’s activities of this plant. Free fatty acids as well as terpenoids and sterols respectively, have demonstrated higher quantities in Portugues P. anisum L., seeds. With respect to the obtained results of inhibitory activities of this infusion against tested enzymes and free radicals, it has been approved that compounds with free radical suppressing activities might not able to participate in competitive enzymes suppressive reactions with substrates. Therefore the needs to in vivo tests for obtaining most reliable results are revealed. This research aims to introduce novel and natural sources of bioactive compounds that might be used in promoting good health, in general, and in particular in the treatment of chronic disorders such as Alzheimer’s, diabetes, cancers as well as Parkinson’s disease along with microbial infections. This research revealed that the tested plants from Portugal and Iran could be potential sources of compounds with an extensive range of application for health benefits as well as in nutraceutical, pharmaceutical and cosmetic products.

Nowadays, {{the consumption}} of herbal remedies is becoming more popular {{based on the fact}} that herbal products are relatively safe, effective and inexpensive. The present investigation was undertaken to explore and shed light on possible medicinal effects of the water extract of common marshmallow (Althaea ofJicinalis) flowers upon blood lipid profile, glycemia, inflammation, platelet aggregation, ulcer and bacterial activity. After one and two months of chronic extract intake via drinking water (59, 230 and 590 mg of extract / kg body weight), a drastic increase in HDL-cholesterol was observed, along with sharp decreases in LDL-cholesterol and mild increases in triglyceride. At the same time, the water extract showed no adverse effect on liver function. An increase in both serum glucose and insulin levels was observed in animals receiving the extract for one month, which raise the possibility of development of insulin resistance syndrome. The effect of water extract of the flowers of Althaea ofJicinalis (50, 100 and 250 mg water extract / kg body weight) on ethanolinduced gastric ulcer showed a remarkable anti-ulcerogenic activity that appeared to be better than anti secretory drug such as Cimetril. The water extract of <b>Althaea</b> <b>officinalis</b> flowers (100, 250 and 500 mg of flowers / kg body weight) exhibited substantial antiinflammatory effects in vivo in both acute inflammation and chronic inflammation induced by carrageenan and formalin respectively. In addition, 500 flg of the pure extract showed a time-dependant inhibition of platelet aggregation thus protecting from thrombosis and shock. The water extract of the flowers of <b>Althaea</b> <b>officinalis</b> (200, lOO, 50, 20 and lO flg / 20 fll) didn't have any potential antibacterial effect against the hospital bacterial isolates studied. In conclusion, the water extract of the flowers of <b>Althaea</b> <b>officinalis</b> showed anti-ulcerogenic, anti-inflammatory and platelet antiaggregant activities.

50|$|The {{caterpillar}} larvae mainly feed {{inside the}} seed capsules and shoots of Malvaceae such as China Jute (Abutilon theophrasti), Marsh Mallow (<b>Althaea</b> <b>officinalis),</b> the tree mallow Lavatera arborea, Arrowleaf Sida (Sida rhombifolia), and various Gossypium (cottons) and Malva (typical mallows) species. The caterpillars {{have been found}} on other eurosids, including Crataegus hawthorns (Rosaceae), Cucurbita pepo pumpkins (Cucurbitaceae), and Eucalyptus (Myrtaceae). They may occasionally become pests of cotton.|$|R

50|$|Marshmallows are {{prepared}} using egg whites, corn syrup and sugar. The use of marshmallow {{to make a}} sweet dates back to ancient Egypt, where the recipe called for an extract from {{the root of the}} marshmallow plant (<b>Althaea</b> <b>officinalis)</b> and mixing it with nuts and honey. Another pre-modern recipe uses the pith of the marshmallow plant, rather than the root. In modern times, marshmallows are often commercially prepared using extrusion.|$|R

Traditionally, marshmallows were made from the extract of the mucilaginous root of the marshmallow plant (<b>Althaea</b> <b>officinalis)</b> as a cough medicine. The inner bark of the slippery elm (Ulmus rubra), a North American tree species, has long {{been used as a}} demulcent and is still produced commercially for that purpose.|$|R
40|$|In {{this study}} {{polyphenols}} content and antioxidant activity of melliferous plants for the following: mint (Mentha pulegium), burdock (Arctium lappa), comfrey (Symphytum officinale), plantain (Pantago lanceolata), thyme (Thymus vulgaris), sage (Salvia officinalis), marigold (Calendula <b>officinalis),</b> small marshmallow (<b>Althaea</b> <b>officinalis),</b> echinacea (Echinaceea angustifolia) and black popular (Populus nigra) were investigated, using two different extraction methods. High content of polyphenols and flavones were extracted from Populus nigra, {{with an average}} of both extractions 23. 14 mg GAE/g and 78. 07 mg QE/g flavones. Among the studied plants, Arctium lappa registered the highest antioxidant activity (0. 129 mmol Trolox/mL) in alcoholic extract and Echinaceea angustifolia with a value of 0. 122 mmol Trolox/mL in aqueous extract. The lowest values were recorded for the antioxidant activity of <b>Althaea</b> <b>officinalis</b> (alcoholic extract) and Arctium lappa (aqueous extract). The results show that Arctium lappa, Echinaceea angustifolia and Populus nigra can be considered melliferous plants for their high biologically active compounds potential and bee products (honey and pollen) that having the composition of these plants will have high antioxidant and antibacterial properties...|$|R

Webster's Dictionary In 1931 Maud Grieve wrote that the [...] "use of this species of Mallow has been much superseded by Marsh Mallow (<b>Althaea</b> <b>officinalis),</b> which possesses its valuable properties in a superior degree, but it is still a favourite remedy with country people where Marsh Mallow is not obtainable." ...|$|R
40|$|AbstractObjectiveTo {{evaluate}} and practically demonstrate {{the influence of}} <b>Althaea</b> <b>officinalis</b> flower mucilage as a plant known in Iran's and other Middle Eastern countries' traditional medicine for its wound healing properties. MethodsAnimals were divided into 6 groups of 5 cases including a non-treated group as the negative control group receiving no treatment, a group treated with eucerin as the positive control group, a phenytoin 1 % group as a standard group treated topically with phenytoin 1 % hand-made ointment, and treatment groups treated with hand-made <b>Althaea</b> <b>officinalis</b> flower mucilage (AFM) ointment in a eucerin base with different concentrations (5 %, 10 %, 15 %). ResultsAmong the treatment groups, the AFM 15 % ointment showed the best result. Wound healing duration was reduced by the surface application of these groups. Wound closure was completed on Days 14 and 15 in the AFM 15 % ointment and phenytoin 1 % groups, respectively. No significant difference was observed in healing period between these groups. ConclusionsIn conclusion, AFM 15 % ointment was found to reduce wound healing time without any significant difference with the phenytoin 1 % ointment. The authors suggest increased AFM effectiveness in when combined with phenytoin or other effectual plants...|$|R

50|$|Althaea is a genus of 6-12 {{species of}} {{perennial}} herbs native to Europe and western Asia. It includes <b>Althaea</b> <b>officinalis,</b> {{also known as}} the marshmallow plant, whence the fluffy confection got its name. They are found on the banks of rivers and in salt marshes, preferring moist, sandy soils. The stems grow to 1-2 m tall, and flower in mid summer. The leaves are palmately lobed with 3-7 lobes. Althaea species are used as food plants by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species including Bucculatrix quadrigemina.|$|R
