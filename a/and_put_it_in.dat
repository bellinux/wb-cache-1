25|$|It is {{not unusual}} for some animals to play with toys. An example of this is a dolphin being trained to nudge a ball through a hoop. Young {{chimpanzees}} use sticks as dolls – the social aspect is seen by the fact that young females more often use a stick this way than young male chimpanzees. They carry their chosen stick <b>and</b> <b>put</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> their nest. Such behaviour is also seen in some adult female chimpanzees, but never after they have become mothers.|$|E
25|$|When an {{operating}} system is {{running on a}} system without file encryption, access to files normally goes through OS-controlled user authentication and access control lists. However, if an attacker gains physical access to the computer, this barrier can be easily circumvented. One way, for example, would be to remove the disk <b>and</b> <b>put</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> another computer with an OS installed that can read the filesystem; another, would be to simply reboot the computer from a boot CD containing an OS that is suitable for accessing the local filesystem.|$|E
25|$|Groklaw {{uncovered}} an old settlement {{made between}} Unix System Laboratories (USL) and The University of California {{in the case}} of USL v. BSDi. This settlement ended a copyright infringement suit against the University for making BSD source code freely available that USL felt infringed their copyrights. The university filed a counter suit, saying that USL had taken BSD source code <b>and</b> <b>put</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> UNIX without properly acknowledging the university's copyright. This settlement muddies the question of SCO's ownership of major parts of the UNIX source code. This uncertainty is particularly significant in regard to SCO's claims against Linux, which uses some BSD code.|$|E

25|$|The {{interior}} is fitted with soft leather. Bose audio {{system and a}} navigation system were standard. In typical Porsche fashion, the ignition is {{to the left of}} the steering wheel. This placement dates back to the early days of Le Mans racing when drivers were required to make a running start, hop into their cars, start them and begin the race. The placement of the ignition enabled the driver to start the car with the left hand <b>and</b> <b>put</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> gear with the right. Originally, the car had a beechwood gearknob, which pays homage to the wooden gearknob used in the Porsche 917 Le Mans racers.

25|$|Uppermost in {{the minds}} of the Spanish ministers was the need to {{preserve}} their empire intact <b>and</b> <b>put</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> hands powerful enough to guarantee that integrity. The preservation of the whole empire for the next generation of Spaniards was the driving motive in the last months of Charles II's life, but the grandees, led by Cardinal Portocarrero, knew that militarily their country was at the mercy of neighbouring France and that Austria, lacking a navy, could not hope to validate its claims. Consequently, Charles II, pressed on his sick-bed by his ministers, signed his final will on 3 October 1700, annulling the renunciations imposed on Maria Theresa and fixing the entire inheritance on the younger grandson of Louis XIV, Philip, Duke of Anjou. As Philip was not immediately in line for the French throne (the Dauphin and the Duke of Burgundy stood between him and the crown), the Spanish government hoped that this arrangement would be acceptable to European states who feared the unification of the French and Spanish thrones under a single monarch. If Philip should die or refuse, the offer was to extend to his younger brother, the Duke of Berry; if they both refused, the undivided inheritance would be offered to Archduke Charles.|$|E

He then scored two goals and was named man of the match in the next game against Udinese. Ménez also continued his impressive form and scored a beautiful goal as he dribbled past 3 defenders <b>and</b> <b>put</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> the net as he helped Milan beat Napoli 2–0. Ménez scored two goals and created an assist in the 3–1 defeat of Parma on 1 February. He followed this with a penalty in a 2–2 draw with Hellas Verona on 7 March and a brace in a 3–1 defeat of Cagliari on 21 March, hitting a career high in goals for a single club (15, surpassing his previous best of 14 for PSG). On 4 March 2015, Ménez scored the winning goal after a long solo run against Palermo in a 2–1 victory, Milan's first away win of 2015. Ménez's season, however, ended poorly; on 29 April 2015, he was sent off for a second bookable offensive during the 3–1 defeat against Genoa and was handed a four-match ban for an insulting gesture, also missing the team's last match against Atalanta due to an injury. Ménez ended his first season at Milan as the club's top scorer, with 34 appearances and 16 goals in all competitions.|$|E

500|$|Kemp was {{a critic}} of {{association}} football, known as soccer in the United States.

[...] Kemp compared his speech to George Carlin's 1984 comedy routine on the differences between baseball and American football and wrote that his [...] "tongue was firmly planted in cheek" [...] when making the speech.
