They first met in 2005 when she appeared on Blue Peter {{and he was}} struck by how good she was with kids: [...] "You kind of think people like that are <b>all</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> false, but she really wasn't at all, and I like that. She really is lovely, a typical Neath girl." [...] It was reported they met after Jenkins sang [...] "Time to Say Goodbye" [...] with Italian opera singer Andrea Bocelli on an episode of Strictly Come Dancing, broadcast on 21 October 2007. Jenkins's spokesman has said: [...] "They're old friends and they've been on several dates. But people shouldn't consider buying hats just yet." ...|$|E

[...] "She's talented and so incredible that she's not an opening act", he said. [...] "We're doing it together, with no opening act." [...] In August, Gaga expressed her belief that the tour would be [...] "one of the most groundbreaking moments in touring history." [...] Before the singer agreed to collaborate with West, she demanded that the tour would remain accessible to her gay fans. [...] "I'm gay", she recalled telling West in an interview with Out magazine, [...] "my music is gay. My show is gay. And I love that it's gay. And I love my gay fans and they're <b>all</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> coming to our show. And it's going to remain gay." ...|$|E
500|$|Forty-five {{cars were}} entered for {{qualifying}}, but only forty-three could {{qualify for the}} race because of NASCAR's qualifying procedure. Kahne clinched the 20th pole position of his career, {{with a time of}} 30.525 seconds. He was joined on the front row of the grid by Edwards. McMurray qualified third, Bill Elliott took fourth, and A. J. Allmendinger started fifth. Johnson, David Reutimann, Mark Martin, David Ragan and Regan Smith rounded out the top ten. Hamlin only managed 37th, having getting close to the wall. The two drivers that failed to qualify for the race were Patrick Carpentier, and Michael McDowell. Once the qualifying session completed, Kahne commented, [...] "That was the best qualifying run by far since I joined Red Bull. I look forward to Sunday’s race. It’s going to be exciting being up front now, being in the mix with Denny , Kevin [...] and Jimmie [...] They’re <b>all</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> fast throughout the race.

500|$|As Petrucci and Rudess {{felt that}} the album needed real string lines and choirs, {{as well as other}} organic sounds, they enlisted the help of veteran {{composer}} David Campbell to assist with aspects of the orchestration and handle the logistics of recording all of the necessary musicians. Reflecting on the process for Keyboard, Rudess explained, [...] "Our initial thought was, let’s do it all on rock instruments and let David arrange it, but that wasn’t really thinking ahead in terms of who we are. When we go into the studio, we tend to work on things until they’re pretty polished. So we got into what we called pre-orchestrating. I’d use any sound at my disposal to place strings where we wanted to hear strings, choir where we wanted choir, and so forth—but without getting overly specific about a certain patch or instrument library being the one, because we knew it was <b>all</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> replaced with real players." [...] Once the album's arrangements were complete, they were performed and recorded in studios around the world, with Campbell conducting and leading the sessions from Los Angeles.|$|E

500|$|Upon {{joining the}} cast of Tangled, Moore was {{initially}} unaware that the film was slated to be Walt Disney Animation Studios' 50th animated feature film. Since that time, she has received her ignorance with gratitude, explaining, [...] "I feel lucky because I would've probably felt a bit more pressure had I known going into the recording process." [...] Moore hardly worked with co-stars Zachary Levi and Donna Murphy, who provided the voices of Flynn Rider and Mother Gothel, respectively, never meeting Murphy and having only met Levi once to record their characters' duet [...] "I See the Light". Moore {{was surprised to learn}} that she would be isolated from her co-stars against initial expectations that [...] "we're <b>all</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> chummy, hanging out at the studio laughing and going out to dinner together". Moore had little idea of what her character looked like because, in terms of visual aid, she was only provided with rough, incomplete sketches and storyboards, while [...] "everything else had to be explained" [...] by Howard and Greno. The majority of the images were created by Moore herself in her own mind.|$|E
500|$|The NBA {{revised the}} {{schedule}} to play two preseason games and a 66-game regular season schedule per team {{rather than the}} standard seven preseason games and an 82-game regular season schedule. Teams were allowed to contact players' agents on November 30.

NBA teams began talking to free agents on December 5, 2011 at 10 a.m. EST. Training camps and free agency started on December 9 with the regular season beginning on Christmas Day with five games, two more than the original schedule. ESPN/ABC analyst Jeff Van Gundy said about the NBA opening on Christmas Day: [...] "It's a different opening day than has ever happened in the past and Christmas Day games have always been a big day for the NBA. This unique situation combined with the unveiling of a championship banner for the Mavericks in a finals rematch, and then to see the Lakers and the debut of Mike Brown as head coach, those things are <b>all</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> very compelling." ...|$|E

We are <b>all</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> killed.... This is an appeal for international help. Please do something to stop this invasion." [...] One Timorese refugee told later of [...] "rape [...] cold-blooded assassinations of women and children and Chinese shop owners". Dili's bishop at the time, Martinho da Costa Lopes, said later: [...] "The soldiers who landed started killing everyone they could find. There were many dead bodies in the streets – all we could see were the soldiers killing, killing, killing." [...] In one incident, a group of fifty men, women, and children – including Australian freelance reporter Roger East – were lined up on a cliff outside of Dili and shot, their bodies falling into the sea. Many such s took place in Dili, where onlookers were ordered to observe and count aloud as each person was executed. It is estimated that at least 2,000 Timorese were massacred in the first two days of the invasion in Dili alone. In addition to Fretilin supporters, Chinese migrants were also singled out for execution; five hundred were killed in the first day alone.|$|E

500|$|At a {{dialogue}} on {{the changes to}} the Elected President scheme on 15 September 2016, Law Minister K. Shanmugam addressed the allegation, saying: [...] "sk yourself logically, [...] do we, as a Government, do what is right, based on the system, or do we worry [...] some {{people are going to}} say this is to knock out people we don't like? You know, more than 1,000 people will qualify from the private sector. Do you think we know who they are and we can make sure that they are <b>all</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> OK? It’s not possible." [...] He also expressed the view that Tan would not satisfy the new qualification criteria as he had held a non-executive post in a company, and the company did not have shareholders' equity of at least $500 million. In a Facebook post two days later, Tan asked: [...] "Is there some truth after all that the changes in the rules was to make sure I would not be eligible? It would be a sad day for Singaporeans if a constitutional change was made because of an individual." [...] The Singapore Government denied the accusation, Shanmugam stating at another forum held on 18 September that the amendments to the Elected President scheme were aimed at [...] "improving the system for Singapore's long-term future, not at barring certain individuals from standing".|$|E

[...] On the location for a third season, Fazekas stated that moving the series to London had been a possibility, an idea that creators Markus and McFeely had early on. Fazekas added, [...] "you can put the show anywhere, because it's spies. [...] <b>all</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> determined by what story we want to tell.

[...] Fazekas also said that seeds for a third season had been planted all throughout the second, and {{that the end of the}} second season, with someone shooting Thompson and taking the M. Carter file, was [...] "very much tied to a third season arc", with the shooter and their reason for taking the file already determined. Atwell added that the third season would have gone [...] "further back into [...] past” while having [...] "a possible kind of twist... into something to do with [...] family." [...] She also added that more insight would have been provided on Carter's brother, Michael.|$|E
