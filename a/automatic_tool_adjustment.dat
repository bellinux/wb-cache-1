Both manual and <b>automatic</b> <b>tools</b> are available as combination tools, which perform the tensioning, sealing and cutting, or as separate tensioners, sealers, and cutters. Manual sealers for plastic strap always use a seal and a compression (serrated seals) or crimp joint (smooth faced seals). Manual and automatic hand sealers for steel can use a seal or a seal-less joint. <b>Automatic</b> hand <b>tools</b> for plastic strap use a friction weld.|$|R

As the quality of the tool {{is directly related to the}} quality of the product, <b>automatic</b> <b>tool</b> wear evaluation is vital to ensure smooth automatic control of machining processes [1]. In this paper, an <b>automatic</b> <b>tool</b> wear detection procedure is presented, where real time collected sequence images of the cutting tool during turning tests are subjected to image processing. The procedure can be divided into four steps: (1) Standardization of <b>tool</b> images; (2) <b>Adjustment</b> of pixel color density to obtain clear edges of the tool wear region; (3) Drawing of the projection line to find out the coordinates of the edge lines; (4) Calculation of tool wear development characteristics. The tool wear characteristics and extension area are evaluated on the basis of the processed edge. One by one, sequence images are processed to automatically provide the growth of tool wear characteristics. In order to verify the procedure accuracy, the tool wear characteristics and extension area are also evaluated manually using a grid number counting technique on paper images. The comparison of the results confirmed that the automatic evaluations achieve a high degree of accuracy. The experimental results indicate that the proposed procedure can be a viable technique to assess the tool wear development characteristics on an on-line basis...|$|R

Several formal models of soundness and coercion-resistance {{have been proposed}} in the literatures, but these formal models are not supported by <b>automatic</b> <b>tools.</b> Recently Backes et al. propose a new formal automated model of security properties including soundness and coercion-resistance in applied pi calculus.
