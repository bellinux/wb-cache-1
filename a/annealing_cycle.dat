The metal of the VIIIB group is introduced with concentrations in the range 0 <x< 25 at. %. Thin films are sputtered using the RGTO (rheotaxial growth and thermal oxidation) technique. This technique consists of metal deposition onto a substrate maintained at a temperature higher than the metal melting point and metal oxidation by means of an <b>annealing</b> <b>cycle</b> in pure oxygen. Particular emphasis is given to the relations between some preparation parameters of the material, namely the atomic percentage of iron or the <b>annealing</b> <b>cycle,</b> and to the sensor sensitivity towards CO and other interfering gases like C 2 H 5 OH, H- 2 and NOx diluted in dry air.

The self-assembly pathways are typically characterized by high energy barriers that hinder the access to stable (equilibrium) structures. A possible strategy to tackle this challenge is to perform <b>annealing</b> <b>cycles.</b> By periodically switching {{on and off the}} inter-particle bonds, one expects to smooth-out the kinetic pathways and favor the assembly of targeted structures. Preliminary results have shown that the efficiency of <b>annealing</b> <b>cycles</b> depends strongly on their frequency.

40|$|The {{effects of}} {{prolonged}} annealing at elevated temperatures {{have been investigated}} in a 53 cm 3 closed-end coaxial high purity germanium detector in the reverse electrode configuration. The detector was multiply annealed at 100 °C in block periods of 7 days. After each <b>anneal</b> <b>cycle</b> it was cooled to 77 K and the relative efficiency, peak channel location and FWHM energy resolution measured at 6 gamma-ray energies. At the present time, the detector has completed 16 <b>anneal</b> <b>cycles.</b> It was found that above ~ 662 keV the photopeak efficiency decreased almost linearly {{at a rate of}} ~ 1. 5 % per <b>anneal</b> <b>cycle,</b> although the energy resolution and centroid (and therefore charge collection efficiency) remained unchanged. The change in detection efficiency is attributed to the expansion of the inner n+ contact due to the thermal drive-in of Li ions into the bulk. The rate is found to follow a power-law dependence in agreement with that expected from Fick's diffusion laws. Using these data, we have derived a simple 1 -D phenomenological model in which the n+ contact thickness is simply related to the Li diffusion length. For annealing at 100 °C, the thickness of the n+ contact, d, {{as a function of the}} annealing time, t, can be described semi-empirically by d(mm) = 0. 231 × t(days) 1 / 2...|$|R

40|$|This is a {{study of}} heat {{transfer}} in a lift-off furnace which is employed in the batch annealing of a stack of coils of steel strip. The objective of the project is to investigate the various factors which govern the furnace design and the heat transfer resistances, so as to reduce {{the time of the}} <b>annealing</b> <b>cycle,</b> and hence minimize the operating costs. The work involved mathematical modelling of patterns of gas flow and modes of heat transfer. These models are: Heat conduction and its conjectures in the steel coils;Convective heat transfer in the plates separating the coils in the stack and {{in other parts of the}} furnace; and Radiative and convective heat transfer in the furnace by using the long furnace model. An important part of the project is the development of numerical methods and computations to solve the transient models. A limited number of temperature measurements was available from experiments on a test coil in an industrial furnace. The mathematical model agreed well with these data. The model has been used to show the following characteristics of annealing furnaces, and to suggest further developments which would lead to significant savings: - The location of the limiting temperature in a coil is nearer to the hollow core than to the outer periphery. - Thermal expansion of the steel tends to open the coils, reduces their thermal conductivity in the radial direction, and hence prolongs the <b>annealing</b> <b>cycle.</b> Increasing the tension in the coils and/or heating from the core would overcome this heat transfer resistance. - The shape and dimensions of the convective channels in the plates have significant effect on heat convection in the stack. An optimal design of a channel is shown to be of a width-to-height ratio equal to 9. - Increasing the cooling rate, by using a fluidized bed instead of the normal shell and tube exchanger, would shorten the cooling time by about 15 %, but increase the temperature differential in the stack. - For a specific charge weight, a stack of different-sized coils will have a shorter <b>annealing</b> <b>cycle</b> than one of equally-sized coils, provided that production constraints allow the stacking order to be optimal. - Recycle of hot flue gases to the firing zone of the furnace would produce a. decrease in the thermal efficiency up to 30 % but decreases the heating time by about 26 %...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the general {{features of a}} new heating process developed by the authors in order to conduct steel annealing in a potentially more economical and more efficient fashion than conventional technologies. This process consists of generating a cold plasma discharge in argon {{in the vicinity of}} the steel surface. The discharge is generated between the steel surface, cathode of the system, and the anode facing it. The steel heating results from the bombardment of its surface by energetic neutrals and ions. Conventional low carbon steel <b>annealing</b> <b>cycles</b> have been reproduced at laboratory scale with this new annealing technology and led to equivalent metallurgical properties. Moreover this new plasma annealing technology allowed the opportunity for new <b>annealing</b> <b>cycles</b> with higher heating rate (up to several hundreds of K/s), shorter soaking time and controlled cooling rate, so that well recrystallized samples were achieved in a few seconds total process time. Experimental evidence shows that process parameters such as the heating and cooling rates, the maximum annealing temperature and the soaking time strongly influence the recrystallization process and the metallurgical texture development, hence the steel mechanical properties. In conclusion, this paper indicates clearly that, at least for low carbon steel annealing, thanks to this new plasma annealing technology, the total annealing time can be significantly reduced compared to the time required by the industrial continuous annealing process used today to obtain equivalent metallurgical properties.
