25|$|Like all California beaches, Malibu beaches are {{technically}} {{public land}} below the mean high tide line. Many large public beaches (Zuma Beach, Surfrider Beach) are easily accessible, but such access is sometimes limited {{for some of}} the smaller and more remote beaches. Some Malibu beaches are private, such as Paradise Cove, which charges an entrance fee to keep the crowds at bay. Although access to most all Malibu beaches can be obtained after a bit of a walk, the issue of expanded public access is continuously addressed and debated by the city. Many Malibu homeowners favor limited public access expansions to some beaches, claiming that many visitors <b>are</b> <b>less</b> <b>likely</b> <b>than</b> residents to respect the beaches or private property.|$|E
25|$|Although females <b>are</b> <b>less</b> <b>likely</b> <b>than</b> {{males to}} {{initiate}} physical violence, they can express aggression {{by using a}} variety of non-physical means. Exactly which method women use to express aggression is something that varies from culture to culture. On Bellona Island, a culture based on male dominance and physical violence, women tend to get into conflicts with other women more frequently than with men. When in conflict with males, instead of using physical means, they make up songs mocking the man, which spread across the island and humiliate him. If a woman wanted to kill a man, she would either convince her male relatives to kill him or hire an assassin. Although these two methods involve physical violence, both are forms of indirect aggression, since the aggressor herself avoids getting directly involved or putting herself in immediate physical danger.|$|E

RESULTS: African Americans (n = 527) <b>were</b> <b>less</b> <b>likely</b> <b>than</b> Whites (n = 9489) to have received catheterization (adjusted odds ratio [OR] = 0. 62, 95 % confidence interval [CI] = 0. 50, 0. 76), PTCA (OR = 0. 64, 95 % CI = 0. 49, 0. 85), or CABG surgery (OR = 0. 42, 95 % CI = 0. 27, 0. 64); somewhat more likely to have received a stress test or an echocardiogram; and equally likely to have received a multiple-gated acquisition scan.

25|$|Language policy {{remains a}} {{perennial}} issue in New Brunswick society and politics. Recurring debates have arisen {{in regards to}} interpretation of the provincial bilingualism policy, duality (the system of parallel French and English speaking public services), and specifics of implementation. The extent of the provincial policy on bilingualism means that a new row is never far off in the New Brunswick news cycle. The French-speaking community continues to advocate for full funding of French-language public services and fair representation in public sector employment, while some Anglophones (and Francophones) fear that the system of duality is financially inefficient and its extent is not worthwhile, or that the provincial governments targets for bilingualism in public employment are hurting their chances {{to work for the}} government, as Anglophones <b>are</b> <b>less</b> <b>likely</b> <b>than</b> Francophones to be proficient enough in both official languages to use them in employment.|$|E
25|$|The {{continued}} use of racial categories has been criticized. Apart from the general controversy regarding race, some argue that the {{continued use}} of racial categories {{in health care and}} as risk factors could result in increased stereotyping and discrimination in society and health services. Some of those who are critical of race as a biological concept see race as socially meaningful group that is important to study epidemiologically in order to reduce disparities. For example, some racial groups <b>are</b> <b>less</b> <b>likely</b> <b>than</b> others to receive adequate treatment for osteoporosis, even after risk factors have been assessed. Since the 19th century, blacks have been thought to have thicker bones than whites have and to lose bone mass more slowly with age. In a recent study, African Americans were shown to be substantially less likely to receive prescription osteoporosis medications than Caucasians. Men were also significantly less likely to be treated compared with women. This discrepancy may be due to physicians' knowledge that, on average, African Americans are at lower risk for osteoporosis than Caucasians. It may be possible that these physicians generalize this data to high-risk African-Americans, leading them to fail to appropriately assess and manage these individuals' osteoporosis. On the other hand, some of those who are critical of race as a biological concept see race as socially meaningful group that is important to study epidemiologically in order to reduce disparities.|$|E
25|$|There is no {{consensus}} on the net impact of immigration to government finances. A 1990 study found that an average immigrant household paid $22,528 in all forms of taxes and on average each household directly consumed $10,558 in government services. By contrast an average native Canadian household paid $20,259 in tax and consumed $10,102 dollars in services. Across the country this means that immigrant households contributed $2.6 billion more than their share to the public purse. A 1996 study found that over a lifetime a typical immigrant family will pay some forty thousand dollars more to the treasury than they will consume in services. Explanations for this include that immigrant households tend to be larger, and have more wage earners, increasing taxes. Newcomers are also less likely {{to make use of}} many social services. Immigrants <b>are</b> <b>less</b> <b>likely</b> <b>than</b> native Canadians to receive employment insurance, social assistance, and subsidized housing. Immigrants are also much less likely to become homeless or suffer from mental illness. Recent immigrants are also less likely to make use of subsidized housing than native Canadians of the same income level. In 2004 22.5% of low-income native Canadians lived in subsidized housing, but only 20.4% of low income recent immigrants did so, though this number was considerably higher among more established immigrants. Results from a study from the Fraser Institute found that the immigrants who arrived between 1987 and 2004 cost governments $23 billion per annum (as of 2006) in excess of taxes raised from those immigrants, relating to universal social services (e.g., welfare, medicare, public education).|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE: This study {{examined}} {{ethnic differences in}} accessing treatment for depression and substance use disorders (SUDs) among {{men and women in}} a large integrated health plan, and explored factors potentially contributing to health care disparities. METHODS: Participants were 22, 543 members ages 20 to 65 who responded to health surveys in 2002 and 2005. Survey questions were linked to provider-assigned diagnoses, electronic medication, psychiatry, and chemical dependency program records. RESULTS: Among women diagnosed with depression, Latinas (p <. 01) and Asian-Americans (p <. 001) <b>were</b> <b>less</b> <b>likely</b> <b>than</b> Whites to fill an antidepressant prescription. Among men diagnosed with depression, African Americans (p <. 01) <b>were</b> <b>less</b> <b>likely</b> <b>than</b> Whites to do so. Among women diagnosed with an SUD, African Americans (p <. 05) <b>were</b> <b>less</b> <b>likely</b> <b>than</b> Whites to have one or more chemical dependency program visits. CONCLUSIONS: Results demonstrated ethnic differences in accessing depression and SUD treatment among patients diagnosed with these disorders, which persisted after controlling for education, income, having a regular health care provider and length of health plan enrollment. Findings highlight potential gender differences in ethnic disparities, lower antidepressant utilization among Asian Americans, and the effects of co-occurring disorders in accessing behavioral health care...|$|R
