5|$|Np2O5 is black-brown {{in color}} and monoclinic with a lattice size of 418×658×409picometres. It is {{relatively}} unstable and decomposes to NpO2 and O2 at 420-695°C. Although Np2O5 was initially subject to several studies that claimed to produce it with mutually contradictory methods, it was eventually prepared successfully by heating neptunium peroxide to 300-350°C for 2–3 hours or by heating it under a layer of water in an <b>ampoule</b> at 180°C.|$|E
5|$|Samarium {{carbides}} {{are prepared}} by melting a graphite-metal mixture in an inert atmosphere. After the synthesis, they are unstable in air and are studied also under inert atmosphere. Samarium monophosphide SmP is a semiconductor with the bandgap of 1.10eV, {{the same as}} in silicon, and high electrical conductivity of n-type. It can be prepared by annealing at 1100°C an evacuated quartz <b>ampoule</b> containing mixed powders of phosphorus and samarium. Phosphorus is highly volatile at high temperatures and may explode, thus the heating rate has to be kept well below 1°C/min. Similar procedure is adopted for the monarsenide SmAs, but the synthesis temperature is higher at 1800°C.|$|E

40|$|Treballs Finals de Grau d'Enginyeria Química, Facultat de Química, Universitat de Barcelona, Curs: 2015 - 2016, Tutors: Joan Llorens Llacuna i Eva Ulied BaumgartnerThe project {{presented}} {{below was}} generated {{from a real}} need of a pharmaceutical plant to improve the production {{of one of their}} products. The proposed improvement project affects the manufacture of injectable <b>ampoules,</b> exactly the external washing of them once been filled and sterilized. The external <b>ampoule’s</b> washing is necessary because they will pass through an inspection stage where it will be detected if there are any impurities inside the <b>ampoules.</b> If <b>ampoules</b> are not externally clean the inspection line cannot distinguish whether the product have internal impurities or external, therefore, all of this <b>ampoules</b> will be rejected due to they will be unfitted for consumption. This external dirt mainly result during the sterilization stage due to rising temperatures and especially the pressure some of the <b>ampoules</b> do not withstand these conditions and endlessly they breakdown. Until this moment, the company uses the autoclaves to carry out the <b>ampoules</b> external washing. In this project three different ideas for improving this process stage are proposed. The first two ideas, propose improving the <b>ampoules</b> external washing using elements and equipment the plant already have, meanwhile the third option proposes a totally innovative washing design. The first option studied was the possible modification and improvement of the autoclave cycle to ensure, as already known, that there is no possible way an autoclave would carry out a good external washing. Its use is unique and exclusive to perform sterilizations. The second option was proposed was to optimize the <b>ampoules</b> trays. They are used for transporting the <b>ampoules</b> between the different stages of the process. Trays are holoed stainless steel "boxes". Their holes allow draining any remaining water from sterilization, and until now, from the washing. Thus, their dimensions, material and even the pass area of water through it were studied, but this option presented limitations regarding its improvement as it was seen that all the were almost ideal for the process. Finally, the last option was to design an <b>ampoule’s</b> washing tunnel. Using the washing tunnel it was ensures a good external wash of the <b>ampoules</b> so they would pass through the inspection line without any problem. This last option was the one presenting more improvements related to cost savings and especially time spent for company’s workers hand-washing those <b>ampoules</b> detected for the inspection line one by one...|$|R

2500|$|Some of the {{biological}} effects of radium were apparent from the start. The first case of so-called [...] "radium-dermatitis" [...] was reported in 1900, only 2 years after the element's discovery. The French physicist Antoine Becquerel carried a small <b>ampoule</b> of radium in his waistcoat pocket for 6 hours and reported that his skin became ulcerated. Pierre and Marie Curie were so intrigued by radiation that they sacrificed their own health {{to learn more about}} it. Pierre Curie attached a tube filled with radium to his arm for ten hours, which resulted in the appearance of a skin lesion, suggesting the use of radium to attack cancerous tissue as it had attacked healthy tissue. Handling of radium has been blamed for Marie Curie's death due to aplastic anemia. A significant amount of radium's danger comes from its daughter radon: being a gas, it can enter the body far more readily than can its parent radium.|$|E

This oil was not earthly oil; it was made in heaven; the flask also. The flask, with the oil in it, was brought down from heaven by a dove. It was sent down to St. Remi {{just as he was}} going to baptize King Clovis, who had become a Christian. I know this to be true. I had known it long before; for Pere Fronte told me in Domremy.
