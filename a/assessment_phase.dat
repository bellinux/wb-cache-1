25|$|One {{conclusion}} of Black's 2011 report concerned the sickness benefits system. Black felt {{that too many}} claims for the out-of-work sickness benefit Employment and Support Allowance (ESA) {{did not meet the}} threshold for eligibility, yet a Work Capability Assessment (WCA) only took place after an 'assessment phase' lasting at least 13 weeks (during which, the claimant is nominally paid ESA but, in practice, receives {{the same amount of money}} as they would if they were on Jobseekers Allowance). She was concerned that this phase might wrongly lead some patients to believe that they were too ill to work - because they were receiving 'assessment rate' ESA and because their GP had indicated that they were not fit for work on the medical certificate needed to initiate a claim - and that it represented a substantial delay in returning to work for those claimants who would later be judged able to work despite their chronic illness or disability; she therefore recommended that the <b>assessment</b> <b>phase</b> be abolished and that ESA only be considered after a WCA has taken place and the claimant has been found unfit for work.|$|E

The brief required up to six designs from each consortium with air-groups of thirty to forty Future Joint Combat Aircraft (FJCA).

2500|$|I. [...] The {{first step}} in the Analysis and <b>Assessment</b> <b>phase</b> is to {{identify}} critical assets. [...] An asset’s criticality is a function of both time and situation based on the asset’s operational or business value. For the DI, value depends on several factors: [...] First, what military operations or services rely on an asset and how those dependencies change across time Next, how sensitive the operation is to the loss or compromise of the asset, in other words what is the maximum allowable down time if the asset is compromised. Finally, what the asset’s assurance profile is, in particular whether asset restoration or a switch to a backup can occur within the allowable down time. Through domain expertise and inspection, critical assets are identified and then reported to the CIP Program.|$|E

On 23 September 2009, then Prime Minister Gordon Brown confirmed that this reduction to three submarines was still under consideration. In February 2011, the Defence Secretary Liam Fox stated that four submarines would be needed if the UK was to retain a credible nuclear deterrent.

40|$|In the past, {{new medical}} {{services}} were instituted whenever physicians or hospitals perceived the need or sensed {{the interest of}} the medical community.
