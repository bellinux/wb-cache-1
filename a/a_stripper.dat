40|$|Sheet {{metal cutting}} with {{punch and die}} is one of most {{fundamental}} processes in sheet metal presswork, and in many modern tools such as progression tooling <b>a</b> sprung <b>stripper</b> is used to help the punch withdraw from the strip after separation. The vast quantity of practical information which is available about the cutting process does not document whether the use of <b>a</b> spring <b>stripper</b> affects the cutting process. In this work, a tool with <b>a</b> sprung <b>stripper</b> was modified so that the sprung stripper was held back from the strip. Burr height readings were taken {{before and after the}} modification, as were electron micrographs of the cut edge. These were compared to determine the effect, if any, that <b>a</b> sprung <b>stripper</b> would have on the proportions of shear and tensile fracture and the burr height formed. When <b>a</b> sprung <b>stripper</b> was used, maximum burr was half as high as without. Process consistency was over twice as good with <b>a</b> sprung <b>stripper.</b> When <b>a</b> sprung <b>stripper</b> was used,, burr was found to protrude into the hole which did not happen otherwise. With <b>a</b> sprung <b>stripper,</b> there were more patches of secondary shear fracture than with no stripper contact. It is suggested that the use of <b>a</b> sprung <b>stripper</b> altered the path of tensile fracture and the amount of drawing in of the strip during cutting, thus altering the burr height and width.
