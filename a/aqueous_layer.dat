5|$|Mephedrone can be {{synthesised}} {{in several}} ways. The simplest method, {{due to the}} availability of the compounds, is to add 4-methylpropiophenone dissolved in glacial acetic acid to bromine, creating an oil fraction of 4'-methyl-2-bromopropiophenone. The oil fraction can then be dissolved in dichloromethane (CH2Cl2) and drops of the solution added to another solution of CH2Cl2-containing methylamine hydrochloride and triethylamine. Hydrochloric acid (HCl) is then added and the <b>aqueous</b> <b>layer</b> is removed and turned alkaline using sodium hydroxide before the amine is extracted using CH2Cl2. The CH2Cl2 is then evaporated using a vacuum, creating an oil which is then dissolved in a nonaqueous ether. Finally, HCl gas is bubbled through the mixture to produce 4-methylmethcathinone hydrochloride. This method produces a mixture of both enantiomers and requires similar knowledge to that required to synthesise amphetamines and MDMA.|$|E

25|$|Another {{example of}} this is the {{synthesis}} of benzoic acid from phenylmagnesium bromide and dry ice. Benzoic acid is more soluble in an organic solvent such as dichloromethane or diethyl ether, and when shaken with this organic solvent in a separatory funnel, will preferentially dissolve in the organic layer. The other reaction products, including the magnesium bromide, will remain in the <b>aqueous</b> <b>layer,</b> clearly showing that separation based on solubility is achieved. This process, known as liquid–liquid extraction, is an important technique in synthetic chemistry. Recycling is used to ensure maximum extraction.|$|E

2500|$|The {{difficulty}} {{in determining the}} exact structure of Nafion stems from inconsistent solubility and crystalline structure among its various derivatives.

50|$|This {{reaction}} {{is the first}} step in the sulfur-iodine cycle to produce hydrogen. The products separate into two <b>aqueous</b> <b>layers,</b> with the sulfuric acid floating on top, and a mixture of hydrogen iodide and unreacted iodine on the bottom. While the two layers are generally considered immiscible, small amounts of sulfuric acid may still remain in the hydrogen iodide layer and vice versa.

40|$|International audienceThe {{difficulties}} {{associated with}} the rheological characterization of the "biological lubricants" to understand the remarkable tribological performances of biological rubbing contacts, have led to study their molecular composition especially that of molecular interfaces created with biological tissues. Recent studies [Trunfio 2008] have shown the importance of surfactant-type molecules (phospholipid-SAPL) on obtaining molecular surface layers with high mechanical strength and capable of locating the velocity accommodation, leading to a very low friction coefficient. These molecular layers are made of stacks of 3 to 7 SAPL bilayers [Hills 1989], with a thickness of about 5 nm each and separated by <b>aqueous</b> <b>layers</b> (a few nm thick, about 150 mM ion and pH around 7 in the healthy case). Low friction coefficients are due {{to the location of}} the velocity accommodation in the <b>aqueous</b> <b>layers</b> [Klein 2002] and it might be influenced by changes in ion concentrations or pH. This work aims to study the influence of these parameters on the evolution of friction and the degradation of SAPL bilayers during tests carried on an experimental realistic tribological model. This study therefore shows that good nano-mechanical resistance of the SAPL bilayers is essential to obtain low friction. It also suggests that low friction is ensured by ion hydration layers between adjacent SAPL bilayers and that a buffered medium is essential to maintain stable bilayers...|$|R

The proteins lie spontaneously between adjacent bilayers in the complexes. The results indicate that lysozyme may penetrate into the lipid bilayers. But the penetration depth is very shallow, and the tryptophan residues do not penetrate beyond the interface between the hydrocardon core and the headgroup region of the lipid bilayer.

40|$|The {{permeability}} of {{tritiated water}} (THO) across simple and layer-type composite membranes of collodion containing different amounts of polystyrenesulfonic acid has been measured and corrected {{for the effects}} of <b>aqueous</b> stationary <b>layers</b> present at the membrane-solution interfaces. It was found that the water permeabilities in the two opposite directions across the composite membranes were different, whereas they were the same across simple membranes. The theoretical permeability value for the composite membrane (formed by putting one simple membrane on top of another simple membrane of increasing charge density and gently pressing them together), calculated from the values due to simple membranes, was found to be always greater than the two measured values. It was shown that the <b>aqueous</b> <b>layers</b> trapped between membranes were not responsible for the low measured values. The factor causing this was ascribed to the mechanism which produced rectification of water flow in the composite membranes. Establishment of the THO concentration profile in the layered membranes showed that accumulation and depletion of THO in the membrane phase when the THO was flowing from the high charge density side to the low charge density side and vice versa, respectively, were responsible for the unequal flows observed across the composite membrane in the two directions...|$|R
