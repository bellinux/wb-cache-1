5000|$|A {{source of}} {{confusion}} can be {{use of the}} term [...] "wartime pension." [...] Some mistakenly interpret this to mean the pension is awarded only to Veterans who participated in combat or served in <b>a</b> combat or <b>war</b> <b>zone.</b> The Veterans (or Wartime) Pension does NOT require the Veteran to have participated in combat, nor that the Veteran served in <b>a</b> combat or <b>war</b> <b>zone.</b>|$|R
5|$|Upon commissioning, {{the ship}} was {{assigned}} to the Atlantic Fleet, alongside her sister Delaware. Her first overseas cruise came in November 1910, when she steamed across the Atlantic to visit France and Britain. North Dakota also took part in the invasion of Vera Cruz in 1914. Unlike her sister, North Dakota remained off the American coast {{for the duration of the}} United States' involvement in World War I. Hugh Rodman, the commander of the American expeditionary force, specifically requested that North Dakota be kept stateside; he felt her turbine engines were too unreliable for the ship to be deployed to <b>a</b> <b>war</b> <b>zone.</b>|$|E
5|$|Through {{the first}} months of 1918, the {{composition}} of Battleship Division Nine changed to reflect the lessons learned from operating in <b>a</b> <b>war</b> <b>zone</b> with the Grand Fleet. It soon became apparent that with only four ships, the division could not maintain the level of preparedness required by the constant need to be ready to sail at limited notice. The inevitable result was machinery breakdowns that reduced the squadron to three ships, a development considered unacceptable given the Division's important position {{at the tail end of}} the battle line. The British—faced with the same problem—responded by allocating a spare battleship to each of their squadrons. In this way, each squadron always remained at full strength even when a ship was being repaired.|$|E
5|$|As the Empire of Japan invaded and {{occupied}} Shanghai {{and much of}} east China, Hu Die and Pan Yousheng fled to British Hong Kong. Hu Die {{gave birth to a}} daughter and a boy during this time. Pan worked for a trading firm in Hong Kong, while she also made two films. After the outbreak of the Pacific War in December 1941, Hong Kong also fell to the Japanese. The Japanese pressured her to make a documentary film entitled Hu Die Touring Tokyo for their war propaganda, but Hu Die refused to become a collaborator, and secretly escaped to inland Chongqing, the war-time capital of the Republic of China resistance. It was a long and circuitous journey through <b>a</b> <b>war</b> <b>zone.</b> She entrusted her belongings to the underground, and casually walked out of her Hong Kong home one day. Resistance partisans guided her through the New Territories to Guangdong province. She stayed in Shaoguan {{for a year and a}} half before leaving for Guilin in Guangxi, and did not reach Chongqing until the end of 1943.|$|E

5|$|On 20 February, Kroonland, {{continuing}} to sail for the American Line, returned to New York – Liverpool service after {{an absence of}} 18 months. As a ship of the still-neutral United States sailing in <b>a</b> <b>war</b> <b>zone,</b> Kroonland had her name painted in large letters {{on each side of}} her hull. The name was flanked on either side by large American flags and kept illuminated at night. In June, she carried US$1,500,000 of Argentine gold from London for deposit with the Guaranty Trust Company of New York. On late 1916, a cook aboard Kroonland was arrested for smuggling feathers, wings, and heads of birds of paradise and crowned pigeons. The man, who was paid $300 for each load of feathers, smuggled in at least three loads of the avian contraband before his arrest. In January 1917, a jumble sale held in the saloon on Kroonland raised £73 15s 11d for The Times Fund, {{for the benefit of the}} British Red Cross and the Order of St. John.|$|E

25|$|Diamonds {{were first}} mined in India.

There are negative consequences of the diamond trade in certain areas.

50|$|The {{general idea}} {{of the game is}} that the player is {{launched}} into <b>a</b> 3D <b>war</b> <b>zone</b> with the task of flying a fighter jet. The player must defeat enemies with various weapons like missiles and gunfire as quickly as possible while obtaining as little damage as possible.

25|$|The {{incident}} {{provoked a}} furious outburst in the United States, especially when Germany refused to apologize, instead countering that the destroyer was operating in what Germany {{considered to be}} <b>a</b> <b>war</b> <b>zone</b> and had suffered the consequences. The sinking of the Reuben James did not lead the US to declare war on Germany; it did, however, provide a pretext to officially transfer the US Coast Guard from its peacetime role as {{an arm of the}} US Treasury Department to a wartime function as part of the US Navy. Congress also amended the Neutrality Act to permit the arming of US-registered merchant ships and authorized them to enter European waters {{for the first time since}} 1939.|$|E
25|$|The {{incident}} prompted global outrage when {{it became}} public knowledge in November 1969. The My Lai massacre increased to some extent domestic opposition to the U.S. involvement in the Vietnam War when the scope of killing and cover-up attempts were exposed. Initially, three U.S. servicemen {{who had tried to}} halt the massacre and rescue the hiding civilians were shunned, and even denounced as traitors by several U.S. Congressmen, including Mendel Rivers, Chairman of the House Armed Services Committee. Only after thirty years were they recognized and decorated, one posthumously, by the U.S. Army for shielding non-combatants from harm in <b>a</b> <b>war</b> <b>zone.</b> Along with the No Gun Ri massacre in Korea eighteen years earlier, My Lai was one of the largest single massacres of civilians by U.S. forces in the 20th century.|$|E
25|$|On the {{negative}} side, {{studies show that}} some former military brats struggle to develop and maintain deep, lasting relationships, and can feel like outsiders to U.S. civilian culture. The transitory lifestyle can hinder potential for constructing concrete relationships with people and developing emotional attachments to specific places, as can the stresses of having a parent deployed to <b>a</b> <b>war</b> <b>zone</b> and also the psychological aftermath of war in dealing with returning veteran parents. In some cases {{there is also the}} loss of a parent in combat, or a drastic change in a parent due to a combat related disability. A military brat may personally know another child or teenager, or even a few other peers, whose parents have become war casualties (wounded or killed). A significant minority of ex-military brats may exhibit symptoms of Post Traumatic Stress Disorder, Avoidant Personality Disorder, Separation Anxiety Disorder, etc.|$|E
2500|$|Although Spain apologized, on February 13, 1898, the Maine {{exploded}} {{and sank}} in Havana Harbor, Cuba, two days later, killing 266 American sailors. After a hasty naval court of inquiry, the American press blamed Spain and {{accused them of}} planting a mine that sank the battleship. The war with Spain {{became known as the}} “Correspondents’ War”. Journalists not only wrote stories about the conflict, but took part in the fight. In 1898, the prestige of the press ran high. American society was changing as literacy rates increased. There was a new revolution of readers. <b>As</b> <b>war</b> <b>zones</b> became more open to the press, journalists wrote eyewitness accounts of what was happening.
