25|$|When {{structures}} in different species {{are believed to}} exist and develop {{as a result of}} common, inherited genetic pathways, those structures are termed homologous. For example, the leaves of pine, oak, and cabbage <b>all</b> <b>look</b> very different, but share certain basic structures and arrangement of parts. The homology of leaves is an easy conclusion to make. The plant morphologist goes further, and discovers that the spines of cactus also share the same basic structure and development as leaves in other plants, and therefore cactus spines are homologous to leaves as well.|$|E

25|$|Membership of the {{majority}} of consumers' co-operatives in the UK was brought under one identity in 2008 {{as a part of the}} launch of 'The Co-operative Brand' however each individual co-operative retains its own individual membership scheme. Members of these societies are given a card which <b>all</b> <b>look</b> very similar but which will list the specific co-op which the individual is a member of on the front. As a part of their membership schemes, many of the larger co-operatives which have adopted 'The Co-operative Brand' will allow members of other co-operatives to earn a share of their profits in a reciprocal agreement. This is particularly the case with those co-ops which have interests in supermarkets, whereas other users of the co-op brand, such as The Phone Co-op operate entirely independent membership schemes.|$|E

In 1965, Gittings marched in the first gay picket lines at the White House, the US State Department, and at Independence Hall in Philadelphia to protest the federal government's policy on discrimination of homosexuals, holding a sign that read [...] "Sexual preference is irrelevant to federal employment." [...] The men who agreed to picket had to wear suits and ties, and the women who participated were to wear dresses, heels, and pantyhose so as to look employable by the federal government. Reactions from passersby were varied. A tourist witnessing the demonstration remarked, [...] "I still don't believe it. Somebody's kidding." [...] A stunned high school student pointed out, [...] "They <b>all</b> <b>look</b> so normal." ...|$|E

Meanwhile, a Texas coroner prepares to perform an autopsy on Ronnie's body. When he removes the stake, Ronnie wakes up and escapes. Skinner sends Mulder and Scully back to Texas to investigate. Scully stakes out the cemetery with Sheriff Hartwell, while Mulder goes to the RV park. As they wait, Sheriff Hartwell gives Scully a hot drink, apologizes to her on behalf of Ronnie, and says that he makes them <b>all</b> <b>look</b> bad. He makes it clear that he too is a vampire and Scully realizes she has been drugged. Before she loses consciousness, she sees Sheriff Hartwell's eyes turning green.|$|E
500|$|In the Herald Sun, Leigh Paatsch {{gave the}} film one star. He criticised the casting, {{describing}} {{the main characters}} as [...] "supposed to be aged about 20 [...] played by blokes who <b>all</b> <b>look</b> as if they’re 30-plus, and carry on as if they’re not yet 10", and also found the film misogynistic, saying [...] "the derogatory manner in which women are spoken of (and often depicted) is relentlessly, callously crass. Sometimes even hateful". A mixed review from Philippa Hawker of the Sydney Morning Herald concluded [...] "The Australian elements seem hastily inserted and incidental: the movie could have been set in any country that had a water park {{and a place to}} get lost. But as a hymn to male bonding, and an exploration of the comic possibilities of what happens when a turd hits a water slide, The Inbetweeners 2 is a precisely crafted, assured piece of work".|$|E
500|$|Eurogamer's Kristan Reed was unimpressed {{with the}} game, calling it [...] "a bit half-baked". He praised {{the opening of}} the game, arguing that, like Hansen himself, the player feels a strong sense of {{disorientation}} as they get used to being on the ship {{in the middle of a}} storm. However, he felt the strong opening soon gives way to clichés. He was highly critical of the absence of a map, arguing that because the environments <b>all</b> <b>look</b> similar, getting lost is a regular occurrence. GameSpot's Carrie Gouskos scored the PlayStation 2 version 6.9 out of 10 and the Xbox version 7.2 out of 10. She argued [...] "Atmospherically, Cold Fear is derivative and predictable, which is a shame considering that it is, at times, an enjoyable action game." [...] Although she praised the outdoor scenes on the boat, she felt there were not enough of them, with too many [...] "generic indoor locations." [...] She was also highly critical of the lack of a map and the autosave feature, feeling the save points were unevenly distributed.|$|E

500|$|Although Halos overall {{reception}} {{was largely}} positive, the game received criticism for its level design. GameSpy commented, [...] "you'll trudge through countless hallways and control rooms that <b>all</b> <b>look</b> exactly the same, fighting identical-looking groups of enemies {{over and over}} and over...it is simply frustrating to see a game with such groundbreaking sequences too often degenerate [...] this kind of mindless, repetitive action." [...] Similarly, an article on Game Studies.org remarked, [...] "In {{the latter part of the}} game, the scenarios rely on repetition and quantity rather than innovativeness and quality." [...] Eurogamer concluded, [...] "Halo is very much a game of two halves. The first half is fast, exciting, beautifully designed and constantly full of surprises. The second half is festooned with gobsmacking plot twists and great cinematics but let down by repetitive paint by numbers level design." [...] Halo was released prior to the launch of Xbox Live, and the lack of both online multiplayer and bots to simulate human players was criticised by GameSpy; in 2003 GameSpy included Halo in a list of [...] "Top 25 Most Overrated Games of All Time." ...|$|E
500|$|Roger Ebert for the Chicago Sun-Times {{gave the}} film 3½ stars out of 4, saying [...] "the stunts <b>all</b> <b>look</b> convincing, {{and the effect}} of the closing {{sequence}} is exhilarating... Licence to Kill {{is one of the best}} of the recent Bonds." [...] Jack Kroll, writing in Newsweek described Licence to Kill as [...] "a pure, rousingly entertaining action movie". Kroll was mixed in his appraisal of Dalton, calling him [...] "a fine actor who hasn't yet stamped Bond with his own personality", observing [...] "Director John Glen is the Busby Berkeley of action flicks, and his chorus line is the legendary team of Bond stunt-persons who are at their death-defying best here". For Time magazine, Richard Corliss bemoaned that although the truck stunts were good, it was [...] "a pity nobody – not writers Michael G. Wilson, and Richard Maibaum nor director John Glen – thought to give the humans anything very clever to do." [...] Corliss found Dalton [...] "misused" [...] in the film, adding that [...] "for every plausible reason, he looks as bored in his second Bond film as Sean Connery did in his sixth." ...|$|E
500|$|Simon Vozick-Levinson of Entertainment Weekly {{said the}} post was [...] "a {{fascinating}} {{look at where}} Kanye's head is at these days", and complimented West for his [...] "humility and honesty". Daniel Kreps of Rolling Stone said: [...] "Many have tried, all have failed, {{but in the end}} it only took four animated children from Colorado to topple Kanye West's ego. ... One day, we'll <b>all</b> <b>look</b> back on this day and thank South Park for ushering in this historic moment in the life of Kanye." [...] Kerrie Mitchell of Entertainment Weekly suggested West's modest response was actually a marketing stunt to help sell his upcoming personal fragrance and energy drink. Mitchell wrote, [...] "Did he just get the last laugh on South Park? Conspiracy!" [...] In response to the media coverage, West wrote another blog entry on April 10 claiming he had only seen part of the episode and found it funny, but he had been working on his arrogance problem for some time and that South Park did not lead to his [...] "ego epiphany". The next day, he said in another blog entry that while visiting The Cheesecake Factory restaurant, the manager brought him a plate of fishsticks as a joke.|$|E

500|$|Hale {{is universally}} {{considered}} an excellent judge and jurist, particularly {{due to his}} writings. Edward Foss wrote {{that he was an}} [...] "eminent judge, whom <b>all</b> <b>look</b> up to as one of the brightest luminaries of the law, as well for the soundness of his learning as for the excellence of his life". Similarly, John Campbell in his Lives of the Chief Justices of England, wrote that Hale was [...] "one of the most pure, the most pious, the most independent, and the most learned" [...] of judges. Henry Flanders, writing in the University of Pennsylvania Law Review, describes Hale during his lifetime as [...] "the most learned, the most able, the most honorable man {{to be found in the}} profession of the law". Hale's writings have been cited as recently as 1993, in the case of R v Kingston, where the Court of Appeal relied on his statement that [...] "drunkenness is not a defence" [...] to uphold a conviction. William Holdsworth argues that it was his learning in Roman law and jurisprudence which allowed him to work so effectively; because he had seen other legal systems at work, he [...] "could both criticise the defects of English law and state its rules in a more orderly form than they had ever been stated before". Hale's political neutrality and personal integrity has been attributed to his Puritanism, and his support of the common law; [...] "Regimes come and go, the common law abides...For Hale...legal continuity was vital for civic identity".|$|E
500|$|The {{music video}} for [...] "Till the World Ends" [...] was {{directed}} by Ray Kay and filmed inside a basement in Los Angeles, California. On March 17, 2011, Spears posted on her Twitter account, [...] "Day 1 of the #TTWE Videoshoot. Just wrapped my first big dance number. Taking a well deserved break people!" [...] She also tweeted {{a picture of her}} on set, wearing ripped tights, a Burberry Prorsum studded leather jacket and matching fingerless leather gloves. The making-of was chronicled on the special Britney Spears: I Am the Femme Fatale, which aired on MTV on April 3, 2011, at 21:00 EST (02:00 UTC). In the special, Spears is seen watching the playback, as she later explained, [...] " [...] just to make sure it's right and that the costume looks right and the dancers are together and we <b>all</b> <b>look</b> in unison. It's an energy and it looks fresh. It has a certain vibe with it and it makes sense." [...] She also went on to describe the set as [...] "grimy and gross [...] It was sweat and it was disgusting sometimes". At a point in the shoot, Spears changed her heels to Ugg boots during the shots that did not show her feet, stating that [...] " [...] hurts ... but it looks good. It wasn't a full-length shot, so a girl's about comfort when it's not showing." [...] Spears said that she did not feel the need to top herself, saying that [...] "I've made so many videos that I'm at the point that I genuinely want to enjoy myself, and I have such a good team of people with me. [...] I had never worked with Ray Kay before. I was really happy with the work we did." [...] The video was choreographed by Brian Friedman. On April 4, 2011, it was announced that two different versions of the music video would be released, a director's cut and a choreography cut. The same day, Spears tweeted a 30-second preview of the video, announcing, [...] "#TillTheWorldEnds video premieres THIS Wednesday on VEVO. Cant wait to share it with you guys!" [...] "Till the World Ends" [...] became at the Spears second VEVOcertified music video on YouTube.|$|E
