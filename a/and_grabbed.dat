5000|$|A smash <b>and</b> <b>grab</b> is a {{particular}} form of burglary that involves smashing a barrier, usually a display window in a shop or a showcase, <b>grabbing</b> valuables, <b>and</b> making a quick getaway, without concern for setting off alarms or creating noise. [...] Typically, display windows and showcases that are in enclosed areas, such as shopping malls and office buildings, are less vulnerable to smash <b>and</b> <b>grab</b> raids than those on open streets - particularly where the streets are poorly lit or unobserved (such as premises in pedestrian subways or unstaffed transport facilities). [...] Recent smash <b>and</b> <b>grab</b> crimes have also involved ramming a pickup truck through {{the walls of a}} convenience store or gas station in order to remove the ATM from the premises and recover the cash. [...] Smash <b>and</b> <b>grab</b> raids can occur in many scenarios, both in broad daylight and at night, and the perpetrators can range from experienced thieves to impulsive vandals.|$|R
