5000|$|<b>Advice</b> <b>of</b> <b>Charge</b> (AoC). This GSM service {{estimates}} the call cost for display on the user's mobile phone. This helps users by preventing bill shock {{and reduces the}} load on the mobile network operator's customer service department. However, in practice, this GSM service is rarely used because the calculation {{is more complex than}} the standard allows. Instead, some operators provide subscribers with balance and/or call-cost notifications sent at predetermined times, such as at the beginning or end of every call. These notifications may be read out loud using a speech-synthesis system, or may be transmitted in textual form.|$|E
40|$|Abstract — It {{is already}} {{possible}} {{to discover and}} consume numerous network-based services with different kinds of devices. However, selecting the most favorable service among a set of appropriate services to solve a specific task can become complex and time-consuming for the user. In such situations, interaction between the user and the device should be minimal {{for the sake of}} user convenience. Here, context-aware service discovery can support the selection process through automated filtering based on the actual context. To demonstrate the feasibility of such kind of service discovery, this article describes our case study for a new kind of <b>Advice</b> <b>of</b> <b>Charge</b> (AoC) in the domain of mobile telecommunication. In contrast to existing AoC solutions, we investigate how context information can be used to automatically choose the most appropriate network operator prior to placing a call (AoC-P) ...|$|E

5000|$|EDO Qld has {{advocated}} for better {{public access to}} mining notices, holds regular workshops across metropolitan and regional Queensland and offers an evening telephone advice service.

5000|$|Several {{reports have}} been made citing {{instances}} of basic human rights standards being violated in immigration detention centers across the country. [...] Reports have referred to allegations of abuse {{and a lack of}} legal counsel and proper medical care provided to detainees. In addition, immigrant detainees, unlike citizen prisoners, can be transferred between detention facilities without notice. While the United States Constitution provides convicted individuals with legal <b>advice,</b> free <b>of</b> <b>charge</b> if they cannot afford an attorney, immigrants are not guaranteed this right. Instead, they must pay for a lawyer, an option most detained immigrants cannot afford. While immigration courts are required to supply detainees with a list of pro-bono lawyers and agencies that provide legal <b>advice,</b> many <b>of</b> those on the list only represent specific types of immigrants, i.e., asylum seekers or individuals who are not detained. While ICE detention standards state that detainees are provided with access to law libraries, allotted a handbook discussing immigration detention, and given a presentation on their legal rights, these actions are often not carried out in practice.|$|R

In August 2010, seeking to secure financing from a panel of venture capitalists, Grieve appeared with the Safetray device on a Dragons' Den-style [...] "Brand of the Future" [...] competition at the Edinburgh International Marketing Festival. Bill Jamieson, writer for The Scotsman and a judge at the competition, noted that the product was a step towards making drink service trays in hotels and bars spill-proof. The Safetray device lost the competition to a company that turns discarded plastic into chairs, lighting, and other eco-focused products. A month later, Safetray Products Ltd uploaded the first of several Safetray promotional videos to YouTube. In 2011, Safetray Products Ltd [...] won the Marketing 4 Start-Up Britain award at a competition run by the Marketing Agencies Association and the Government-backed StartUp Britain initiative and the company received creative ideas and marketing <b>advice</b> free <b>of</b> <b>charge</b> for a year from Iris Worldwide.|$|R

40|$|A {{supplementary}} regulation in the Swedish National Dental Health Care Insurance stipulates an increased economic support to those, who are dependent permanently due to disease or handicap. Once enlisted to care, {{they are entitled}} to an annual dental examination and individual prophylactic <b>advice</b> free <b>of</b> <b>charge,</b> and to necessary dental treatment, offered within the ordinary medical care, regulated and funded by the county council. A population of persons, > or = 65 years of age and enrolled in municipal long-term care (LTC) in a county in the south of Sweden, was followed regarding changes in oral status and treatment needs for two years. The number of persons examined the year 2002 was 2416 and the corresponding figure for 2004 was 2846. Totally 1170, i. e. 48. 4 %, of those examined 2002 were deceased two years after the initial examination. Only 914, assessed in 2002, were available for assessment with full data at follow up 2004 and the results are based upon assessments in this group. Analyzing the assessed variables (dental status, oral hygiene status, oral mucosal inflammation, oral mucosal friction) revealed a change during these two years. Significant impairments were recognised, regarding mucosal inflammation and mucosal friction. Regarding treatment needs assessed by a dentist and a dental hygienist, there was a maintained and even increased need for extensive treatment, both by the dentist and, to a greater extent, by the dental hygienist. In sum, prevention efforts both from the dental profession and from other care providers are important to achieve and maintain acceptable oral status...|$|R
50|$|The journey {{had already}} started {{and the two men}} were again not ready to part with their {{families}} at the time and wanted them to attend school locally. The dreamers were the Chair of the Board Mr. Donald Jansen and Dr. Eric Layard who in March of the same year held a public meeting of the prospective parents in the (D.R.C.) Dutch Reformed Church Hall. There was an overwhelming response from the public. At this meeting a Steering Committee was put into office. It was this committee that was transformed into the formally constituted Kyle College Board of Trustees. These were the Chairman Mr. D. Jansen, Dr. E.R. Layard, Dr. I.W.C. McGregor, G.W. Hill, P. Zographos, M.Addenbrook, S. Chireshe and Mrs. J. de Bruyn who would later on resign from the Board due to family commitments. The Board was formally constituted in June 1996 and the Trust was formed at the same time. It was this board that reported back to the parents that in their opinion the idea of the college was feasible. The Board worked towards a school for the 1998 scholastic year. In order to accommodate parents who needed 1997 Form One places, an Interim Form One was started at Kyle Preparatory School {{with the support of the}} Kyle Board. The Masvingo Community had shown their support for this project and aid was given in many ways. Winterton, Holmes and Hill would give their legal <b>advice</b> free <b>of</b> <b>charge</b> during this budding period for the school. The Preparatory School Board gave its advice from the beginning and would continue to do so up until the College was able to stand on its own.|$|R
