5|$|An {{increase}} in intracranial pressure {{may lead to}} impairment of the optic nerves (II) due to compression of the surrounding veins and capillaries, causing swelling of the eyeball (papilloedema). <b>A</b> <b>cancer,</b> such as an optic glioma, may also impact the optic nerve (II). A pituitary tumour may compress the optic tracts or the optic chiasm of the optic nerve (II), leading to visual field loss. A pituitary tumour may also extend into the cavernous sinus, compressing the oculuomotor nerve (III), trochlear nerve (IV) and abducens nerve (VI), leading to double-vision and strabismus. These nerves may also be affected by herniation of the temporal lobes of the brain through the falx cerebri.|$|E

5000|$|Pathologists {{classify}} intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms (IPMNs) {{into two}} broad groups - {{those that are}} associated with <b>an</b> invasive <b>cancer</b> and those that are not associated with <b>an</b> invasive <b>cancer.</b> This separation has critical prognostic significance. Patients with a surgically resected intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm without <b>an</b> associated invasive <b>cancer</b> have <b>an</b> excellent prognosis (>95% will be cured), while patients with a surgically resected intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm with <b>an</b> associated invasive <b>cancer</b> have <b>a</b> worse prognosis. Intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms without <b>an</b> associated invasive <b>cancer</b> can be further subcategorized into three groups. They are IPMN with low-grade dysplasia, IPMN with moderate dysplasia, and IPMN with high-grade dysplasia. This categorization is less important [...] than the separation of IPMNs with <b>an</b> associated <b>cancer</b> from IPMNs without <b>an</b> associated invasive <b>cancer,</b> but this categorization is useful as IPMNs are believed to progress from low-grade dysplasia to moderate dysplasia to high-grade dysplasia to an IPMN with <b>an</b> associated invasive <b>cancer.</b>|$|R
5|$|Endometrial {{cancer is}} <b>a</b> <b>cancer</b> that {{arises from the}} {{endometrium}} (the lining of the uterus or womb).

5|$|The {{most common}} site of {{recurrence}} {{is in the}} vagina; vaginal relapses of endometrial cancer have the best prognosis. If relapse occurs from <b>a</b> <b>cancer</b> {{that has not been}} treated with radiation, EBRT is the first-line treatment and is often successful. If <b>a</b> <b>cancer</b> treated with radiation recurs, pelvic exenteration is the only option for curative treatment. Palliative chemotherapy, cytoreductive surgery, and radiation are also performed. Radiation therapy (VBT and EBRT) for a local vaginal recurrence has a 50% five-year survival rate. Pelvic recurrences are treated with surgery and radiation, and abdominal recurrences are treated with radiation and, if possible, chemotherapy. Other common recurrence sites are the pelvic lymph nodes, para-aortic lymph nodes, peritoneum (28% of recurrences), and lungs, though recurrences can also occur in the brain (<1%), liver (7%), adrenal glands (1%), bones (4–7%; typically the axial skeleton), lymph nodes outside the abdomen (0.4–1%), spleen, and muscle/soft tissue (2–6%).|$|E

40|$|Cancer evolves {{dynamically}} as clonal expansions supersede {{one another}} driven by shifting selective pressures, mutational processes, and disrupted cancer genes. These processes mark the genome, such that <b>a</b> <b>cancer’s</b> life history is encrypted in the somatic mutations present. We developed algo-rithms to decipher this narrative and applied them to 21 breast cancers. Mutational processes evolve across <b>a</b> <b>cancer’s</b> lifespan, with many emerging late but contributing extensive genetic variation. Subclo-nal diversification is prominent, and most mutations {{are found in}} {{just a fraction of}} tumor cells. Every tumor has a dominant subclonal lineage, representingmore than 50 % of tumor cells. Minimal expansion of these subclones occurs until many hundreds to thousands of mutations have accumulated, implying the exis-tence of long-lived, quiescent cell lineages capable of substantial proliferation upon acquisition of en-abling genomic changes. Expansion of the dominant subclone to an appreciable mass may therefore represent the final rate-limiting step in <b>a</b> breast <b>cancer’s</b> development, triggering diagnosis...|$|R

5|$|In 1995, Streep starred {{opposite}} Clint Eastwood as an unhappily {{married woman}} in The Bridges of Madison County, her biggest critical and commercial {{success of the}} decade. Although her dramas of the late 1990s received a mixed reception overall, she was praised {{for her role as}} <b>a</b> <b>cancer</b> patient in One True Thing (1998). She had acclaimed roles in the 2002 films Adaptation and The Hours, and won a second Emmy Award for the television miniseries Angels in America a year later, though she failed to replicate her earlier success. This changed in 2006, with an Academy Award-nominated role as a ruthless fashion magazine editor in the comedy-drama The Devil Wears Prada. This late-period success led to starring roles in several high-profile films, including the US$609 million-grossing romantic comedy Mamma Mia! (2008), her highest-grossing release, and the comedy-drama Julie & Julia (2009), in which she played Julia Child. These roles re-established Streep's stardom in Hollywood. Her portrayal of Margaret Thatcher in the biopic The Iron Lady (2011) earned her another Academy Award for Best Actress. The starring role of Florence Foster Jenkins in the 2016 comedy-drama film of the same name garnered Streep her 20th Oscar nomination, more than any actor or actress in history.|$|E
5|$|Interleukin 2 (IL-2) is {{a protein}} that helps T {{cells of the}} immune system attack {{pathogens}} and tumors. Unfortunately, its use as <b>a</b> <b>cancer</b> treatment is restricted due to serious side effects such as pulmonary edema. IL-2 binds to these pulmonary cells differently than it does to T cells, so IL-2 research involves understanding the differences between these binding mechanisms. In 2012, Folding@home assisted with the discovery of a form of IL-2 which is three hundred times more effective in its immune system role but carries fewer side effects. In experiments, this altered form significantly outperformed natural IL-2 in impeding tumor growth. Pharmaceutical companies have expressed interest in the mutant molecule, and the National Institutes of Health are testing it against a large variety of tumor models to try to accelerate its development as a therapeutic.|$|E

40|$|Carcinogenicity of {{asbestos}} {{has been well}} established for decades and it has similar approval standards in most advanced countries based {{on a number of}} studies and international meetings. However, Korea has been lagging behind such international standards. In this study, we proposed the approval standards of <b>an</b> occupational <b>cancer</b> due to asbestos through intensive review on the Helsinki Criteria, post-Helsinki studies, job exposure matrix (JEM) based on the analysis of domestic reports and recognized occupational lung cancer cases in Korea. The main contents of proposed approval standards are as follows; In recognizing <b>an</b> asbestos-induced lung <b>cancer,</b> diagnosis {{of asbestos}}is should be based on CT. In addition, initial findings of asbestosis on CT should be considered. High Exposure industries and occupations to asbestos should be also taken into account in Korea An expert’s determination is warranted in case of a worker who has been concurrently exposed to other carcinogens, even if the asbestos exposure duration is less than 10 years. Determination of <b>a</b> larynx <b>cancer</b> due to asbestos exposure has the same approval standards with <b>an</b> asbestos-induced lung <b>cancer.</b> However, for <b>an</b> ovarian <b>cancer,</b> <b>an</b> expert’s judgment is necessary even if asbestosis, pleural plaque or pleural thickening and high concentration asbestos exposure are confirmed.

5|$|Specific {{antibodies}} {{are produced}} by injecting an antigen into a mammal, such as a mouse, rat, rabbit, goat, sheep, or horse for large quantities of antibody. Blood isolated from these animals contains polyclonal antibodies—multiple antibodies that bind to the same antigen—in the serum, which can now be called antiserum. Antigens are also injected into chickens for generation of polyclonal antibodies in egg yolk. To obtain antibody that is specific for a single epitope of an antigen, antibody-secreting lymphocytes are isolated from the animal and immortalized by fusing them with <b>a</b> <b>cancer</b> cell line. The fused cells are called hybridomas, and will continually grow and secrete antibody in culture. Single hybridoma cells are isolated by dilution cloning to generate cell clones that all produce the same antibody; these antibodies are called monoclonal antibodies. Polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies are often purified using Protein A/G or antigen-affinity chromatography.|$|E
