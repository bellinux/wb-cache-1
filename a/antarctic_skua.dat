50|$|The rocky soil at the Oasis allows growth {{only for}} {{a limited amount of}} undemanding plants like mosses and lichens.Animals are also rare at the Oasis. Exceptions are the <b>Antarctic</b> <b>skua,</b> the Antarctic petrel, the snow petrel, and the Wilson's storm petrel. Occasionally, Adélie {{penguins}} can be seen at the oasis.|$|E
50|$|The brown skua (Stercorarius antarcticus), {{also known}} as the <b>Antarctic</b> <b>skua,</b> subantarctic skua, {{southern}} great skua, southern skua, or hākoakoa (Māori), is a large seabird that breeds in the subantarctic and Antarctic zones and moves further north when not breeding. Its taxonomy is highly complex and a matter of dispute, with some splitting it into two or three species: Falkland skua (S. antarcticus), Tristan skua (S. hamiltoni), and subantarctic skua (S. lönnbergi). To further confuse, it hybridizes with both the south polar and Chilean skuas, and the entire group has been considered to be a subspecies of the great skua, a species otherwise restricted to the Northern Hemisphere.|$|E

50|$|The Rookery Islands are a {{group of}} rocks and small islands in western Holme Bay, north of the David and Masson Ranges in Mac.Robertson Land in East Antarctica. The group {{contains}} breeding colonies of Adélie penguins, Cape petrels, snow petrels, southern giant petrels (which breed nowhere else in the region), Wilson's storm petrels and <b>Antarctic</b> <b>skuas.</b> The islands are protected under the Antarctic Treaty System as Antarctic Specially Protected Area (ASPA) No.102.|$|R
50|$|The 3453 ha {{ice-free}} {{point has}} been identified as an Important Bird Area (IBA) by BirdLife International because it supports a variety of breeding birds, including one of the largest chinstrap penguin bird colonies on the Antarctic Peninsula with around 90,000 pairs. Other birds nesting at the site are gentoo penguins (3300 pairs), imperial shags (45 pairs), Wilson's and black-bellied storm petrels (1000 pairs combined), southern giant petrels (485 pairs), Cape petrels (480 pairs), <b>Antarctic</b> <b>skuas</b> (60 pairs), snowy sheathbills (140 pairs), kelp gulls (130 pairs) and Antarctic terns (170 pairs).|$|R
40|$|Data about {{breeding}} {{populations of}} {{birds in the}} Antarctica are rare and fragmented. Thus, information {{about the status of}} the breeding populations of Antarctic birds is crucial given the current scenario of climate change, which is particularly acute in Antarctica. This paper presents new information about the populations of the Antarctic tern Sterna vittata, the kelp gull Larus dominicanus, the southern giant petrel Macronectes giganteus, the <b>Antarctic</b> <b>skua</b> Catharacta antarctica lonnbergi, the chinstrap penguin Pygoscelis antarctica and the gentoo penguin Pygoscelis papua on Byers Peninsula (Livingston Island, South Shetland Islands). We used line transects counts to estimate both densities and numbers of nests of the different species. We estimate that there are 398. 96 birds km- 2 of southern giant petrels (2793 individuals), 62. 4 birds km- 2 of Antarctic tern (3746 individuals) and 269. 1 birds km- 2 of kelp gull (1884 individuals). Furthermore, we found 15 nests of <b>Antarctic</b> <b>skua</b> in 25 km 2, from which we can estimate that 60 - 91 birds must breed on Byers Peninsula. We also censused two colonies of gentoo penguins (3000 and 1200 pairs) and 50 pairs of chinstrap. Compared to previous estimates, gentoo penguins seem to have increased whereas chinstrap penguin have decreased. Finally, the populations of Antarctic tern, southern giant petrel and kelp gull have stabilized or slightly increased. Copyright © Antarctic Science Ltd 2013. José A.

40|$|IRD, Noumea reportAbstract – Seabird {{survey of}} Ilot Loop (Chesterfield islands) and at-sea transects, 20 - 28 October 2008. A census {{of the birds}} of Ilot Loop (Chesterfield Atoll, Coral Sea) was taken during a trip of patroller ship La Glorieuse of the French Navy. Twelve bird species were {{observed}} during the 23 hours of our stay on the islet (22 - 23 October 2008), including 7 seabirds breeding [Wedge-tailed Shearwater Puffinus pacificus (N= 6144 active burrows), Black Noddy Anous minutus (N= 5 nests with chick; ~ 500 adults), Brown Noddy A. stolidus (N= 18 nests with egg; ~ 70 adults), Sooty Tern Sterna fuscata (N= 1060 - 1300 breeding pairs), Masked Booby Sula dactylatra (N= 26 breeding pairs), Brown Booby Sula leucogaster (N= 85 breeding pairs), Red-footed Booby S. sula (N= 165 breeding pairs) ], 3 seabirds not breeding [Crested Tern S. bergii (N= 1), Black-naped Tern S. sumatrana (N= 10), Pacific Frigatebird, Fregata minor (N= 1) ], a shorebird [Wandering Tattler Tringa incana (N= 2) ] and the Chesterfield Buff-banded Rail Gallirallus philippensis tournelieri (N= 1 juvenile). From transects at sea in the New Caledonia and Loyalty basins, the following seabirds were observed, hereafter ranked by decreasing abundance: Wedgetailed Shearwater, Sooty Tern, Brown Booby, Tahiti Petrel Pseudobulweria rostrata, Red-footed Booby and other petrels including Pterodroma leucoptera, P. nigripennis and Oceanites oceanicus, and <b>Antarctic</b> <b>Skua</b> Catharacta antarctica. The size of the Tahiti Petrel population of New Caledonia {{was estimated to be}} > 15 000 pairs. Several marine mammals were observed: Dugong Dugong dugon (N= 1) in the Southwest lagoon of New Caledonia, Humpback Whale Megaptera novaeangliae (N= 1) and Bottlenose Dolphin Tursiops sp. (N= 1) in the Chesterfield lagoon, and Bottlenose Dolphin T. truncatus (one pod, N~ 30) and Great Sperm Whale Physeter macrocephalus (N= 1) in the Loyalty basin. A Green Turtle Chelonia mydas was observed laying eggs at Ilot Loop. Samples of Large-eye Bream Gymnocranius sp. and Fringelip Mullet Crenimugil crenilabis were also collected...|$|E
50|$|A site {{cluster in}} the heart of the Géologie Archipelago, south and east, and in the {{immediate}} vicinity, of Petrel Island and Dumont d'Urville Station, comprises Bernard, Jean Rostand, Le Mauguen and Lamarck Islands, Bon Docteur Nunatak, and a breeding site of emperor penguins on the intervening sea ice. The site is protected under the Antarctic Treaty System as Antarctic Specially Protected Area (ASPA) No.120. It was designated as such because it contains representative examples of terrestrial Antarctic ecosystems. Apart from the emperor penguin colony, the only one of about 30 in Antarctica that lies close to a permanent research station, birds nesting in the area include Adélie penguins, <b>Antarctic</b> <b>skuas,</b> Wilson's storm petrels southern giant petrels, snow petrels and Cape petrels. Weddell seals also occur there.|$|R
50|$|The bay {{has been}} {{identified}} as an Important Bird Area (IBA) by BirdLife International because it supports one of the largest Adélie penguin colonies in Antarctica with around 125,000 pairs. Other birds nesting at the site include gentoo penguins, brown <b>skuas,</b> <b>Antarctic</b> terns, Wilson's storm-petrels, kelp gulls and snowy sheathbills.|$|R
5000|$|These {{isolated}} {{islands are}} not rich in wildlife diversity but {{are home to}} a large population of subantarctic fur seal. They are an important breeding ground for the Indian yellow-nosed albatross, flesh-footed shearwater, gentoo penguin, northern rockhopper penguin (Eudyptes moseleyi) great <b>skua,</b> <b>Antarctic</b> tern and the endemic Amsterdam albatross. They were formerly home to two endemic ducks: the Amsterdam wigeon and an undescribed species on Île Saint-Paul.|$|R

Although {{not a true}} seabird, the Heard Island subspecies of the black-faced sheathbill also breeds on the island. Both the shag and the sheathbill are endemic to Heard Island.|$|R
50|$|Hope Bay {{has been}} {{recognised}} as an Important Bird Area. Birds that breed here include the gentoo penguin, brown <b>skua,</b> <b>Antarctic</b> tern, Wilson's storm petrel, kelp gull and snowy sheathbill. It also houses {{one of the}} largest breeding colonies of Adélie penguin in Antarctica. At Trepassey Bay, gentoo and Adélie penguins also breed, as well as Cape petrels, snow petrels, skuas and kelp gulls. Weddell seals often haul out on the beach and leopard seals hunt offshore.|$|R
50|$|Other seabirds {{recorded}} as breeding at Heard Island include three species of albatross (wandering, black-browed and light-mantled albatrosses, southern giant petrels, Cape petrels, four species of burrowing petrels Antarctic and Fulmar prions, common and South Georgian diving-petrels), Wilson's storm-petrels, kelp gulls, subantarctic <b>skuas,</b> <b>Antarctic</b> terns and the Heard shag.

5000|$|The {{island is}} home to the endemic Amsterdam albatross, which breeds only on the Plateau des Tourbières. Other rare species are the great <b>skua,</b> <b>Antarctic</b> tern and western rockhopper penguin. The Amsterdam duck is now extinct, as are the local {{breeding}} populations of several petrels. The common waxbill has been introduced. [...] Both the Plateau des Tourbières and Falaises d'Entrcasteaux have been identified as Important Bird Areas by BirdLife International, the latter for its large breeding colony of Indian yellow-nosed albatrosses.|$|R
40|$|Seabirds show {{remarkable}} {{variability in}} migration strategies among individuals and populations. In this study, we analysed 47 migrations of 28 brown skuas Catharacta antarctica lonnbergi breeding on King George Island in the Maritime <b>Antarctic.</b> Brown <b>skuas</b> from this population used {{a large area}} during the non-breeding period north of 55 °S, including parts of the Patagonian Shelf, Argentine Basin and South Brazil Shelf, areas which are characterised by high levels of marine productivity. However, individual birds utilised only a subset of these areas, adopting 1 of 4 distinct migration strategies {{to which they were}} highly faithful between years, and showed high repeatability in departure and arrival dates at the breeding ground. Although they spent the majority of the non-breeding season within a particular region, almost all individuals used the same area in the late winter, exploiting its seasonal peak in productivity. Overall, these results indicate consistent individual variation in migration strategies that may reflect a combination of genetic control and individual experience, but with considerable flexibility to shift distribution in response to prevailing environmental conditions...|$|R
50|$|A 2000 ha {{tract of}} land {{on the western side}} of the bay has been {{identified}} as an Important Bird Area (IBA) by BirdLife International because it supports breeding colonies of several seabirds, including Adélie penguins (15,000 pairs), gentoo penguins (2300 pairs) and chinstrap penguins (2500 pairs). Other birds recorded nesting at the site are southern giant petrels Cape petrels, snowy sheathbills, kelp gulls, <b>Antarctic</b> terns and <b>skuas.</b> Southern elephant and Weddell seals breed in the area; they, as well as Antarctic fur seals, regularly haul out there. In winter leopard and crabeater seals are often seen on nearby sea ice. The site is also protected as an Antarctic Specially Protected Area (ASPA 128).|$|R
2500|$|Tristan is {{primarily}} {{known for its}} wildlife. The island {{has been identified as}} an Important Bird Area by BirdLife International because there are 13 known species of breeding seabirds on the island and two species of resident land birds. The seabirds include northern rockhopper penguins, Atlantic yellow-nosed albatrosses, sooty albatrosses, Atlantic petrels, great-winged petrels, soft-plumaged petrels, broad-billed prions, grey petrels, great shearwaters, sooty shearwaters, Tristan <b>skuas,</b> <b>Antarctic</b> terns and brown noddies. Tristan and Gough Islands are the only known breeding sites in the world for the Atlantic petrel ( [...] ; IUCN status EN). [...] Inaccessible Island is also the only known breeding ground of the Spectacled Petrel ( [...] ; IUCN Vulnerable). [...] The [...] (IUCN status CR) is known to breed only on Gough and Inaccessible Islands: all nest on Gough except for one or two pairs who nest on Inaccessible Island.|$|R
40|$|In the {{maritime}} <b>Antarctic,</b> brown <b>skuas</b> (Catharacta antarctica lonnbergi) show two foraging strategies: some pairs occupy feeding territories in penguin colonies, while others can only feed in unoccupied areas of a penguin colony without defending a feeding territory. One-third of the studied breeding skua {{population in the}} South Shetlands occupied territories of varying size (48 to > 3, 000 penguin nests) and monopolised 93 % of all penguin nests in sub-colonies. Skuas without feeding territories foraged in only 7 % of penguin sub-colonies and in part of the main colony. Females owning feeding territories were larger in body size than females without feeding territories; no differences in size were found in males. Territory holders permanently controlled their resources but defence power diminished {{towards the end of}} the reproductive season. Territory ownership guaranteed sufficient food supply and led to a 5. 5 days earlier egg-laying and chick-hatching. Short distances between nest and foraging site allowed territorial pairs a higher nest-attendance rate such that their chicks survived better (71 %) than chicks from skua pairs without feeding territories (45 %). Due to lower hatching success in territorial pairs, no difference in breeding success of pairs with and without feeding territories was found in 3 years. We conclude that skuas owning feeding territories in penguin colonies benefit from the predictable and stable food resource by an earlier termination of the annual breeding cycle and higher offspring survivorship...|$|R
