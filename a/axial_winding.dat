30|$|The most {{application}} of wind energy is to generate electrical power through {{various types of}} wind turbines. Wind turbines can be classified into two families generally, i.e., the horizontal <b>axial</b> <b>wind</b> turbine (HAWT) and the vertical <b>axial</b> <b>wind</b> turbine (VAWT) [2]. A lot of study {{has been focused on}} HAWT till now, while the study of VAWT is relatively rare. However, VAWT has its greatest advantage of “omnidirection”. Although the propeller-type windmill could provide a larger power output, it needs greater wind velocity that is almost impossible in city. Besides, HAWT induces low frequency noise that is harmful to animals. It also has a weak response to temporal changes of wind velocity and direction. However, VAWT escapes these environmental problems, resulting in their use in urban environments.|$|R

40|$|Due to the {{reforming}} and {{deregulation of}} electric power industry, investments in transmission equipment have drastically decreased {{to meet the}} economic needs of the competitive market. The electrical utility sector was forced to cut the costs in maintenance and operation without endangering steady supply of electrical power. With this trend, the maintenance strategy desires advanced methods for condition monitoring and assessment of in-service power transformers. Among the common condition assessment techniques, Frequency Response Analysis (FRA) is considered as an efficient off-line diagnostic technique for fault detection in transformer windings. Precise interpretation of the FRA output has proven a great challenge and attracted much effort in recent years. There is also a strong need in this research field to develop an intelligent interpretation procedure for automatic assessment of power transformer conditions. This thesis focuses on two main aspects of power transformer condition assessment: developing an accurate transformer model for the interpretation of transformer FRA responses, and establishing FRA-based novel algorithms to automatically identify transformer failure modes. Reviewing existing transformer modeling methods, this thesis explicitly introduces a simplified distributed parameter model (hybrid winding model) for FRA. The hybrid winding model {{has the advantage of}} less computational complexity and high accuracy in simulation results, even in the frequency range above 1 MHz. Analytical expressions for calculating key electrical parameters of winding models are presented. The electrical parameters of transformer windings with a complex or deformed structure are difficult to calculate using analytical formulations. Therefore, computational models based on Finite Element Method (FEM) are developed in this thesis to calculate the frequency-dependent parameters of transformer windings especially with deformed structures. These parameters are then applied to the transformer winding model for frequency response analysis. By applying the electrical parameters obtained from the FEM models, the accuracy of the hybrid winding model has been improved for cases with incipient winding faults. This methodology is implemented in simulation studies of radial winding deformation and minor <b>axial</b> <b>winding</b> movement to reveal the characteristic features of these two types of winding fault. Results show that: (1) frequency-dependent inductances and structure-dependent shunt capacitance derived from FEM models can be used in FRA analysis, (2) by using the proposed methodology, characteristics of frequency response above 1 MHz can be analyzed, (3) regarding radial winding deformation and minor <b>axial</b> <b>winding</b> movement, the changes in the electrical parameters also affect the frequency response in the high frequency range (> 1 MHz). A Hierarchical Dimension Reduction (HDR) classifier built on FRA results is proposed in this thesis for condition assessment of power transformers. The algorithms of this classifier make advantageous use of advanced image processing technologies including image binalization and binary erosion in the first step of the procedure. This preprocessing procedure optimizes the measured FRA data by filtering the frequency sections with minor deviations which can effect the calculating results of the indices. Also in this step, FRA diagrams are re-scaled in a linear coordinate system for the convenience of calculating the indices in later step. Subsequently, based on the correlation between electrical properties and features of FRA responses, a division approach is proposed to dynamically divide the frequency range into 5 sub-bands. This division method of frequency range is more reasonable than the conventional methods of fixed frequency sub-bands and more applicable than other existing methods. Then the proposed algorithms of hybrid quantitative indices which include four indices are employed. The dimension reduction for the FRA data is processed by these algorithms in the 5 dynamic frequency sub-bands. It is the first time to establish the algorithms of the hybrid quantitative indices, which include two classical indices and two novel indices, for reducing the dimensions of the FRA data. Two new algorithms of indices, Area Ratio Index (ARI) and Angle Difference (AD), are proposed based on knowledge of FRA interpretation with respect to typical transformer failure modes. They are able to improve the classification performance in terms of the ability to identify electrical failures and the condition of residual magnetization. Based on these advantageous processes, the HDR classifier can aggregate related expertise and approved statistical indices in furtherance of automatic decision analysis on identifying transformer failure modes or conditions. The performance of this classifier has been verified by 32 sets of experimental FRA data, in which 20 sets are primarily used for determination of threshold values of the related algorithms and the rest 12 are purely used for the verification. Results of this implementation of the HDR classifier are 100 % accuracy with using the 20 sets of training data and 95. 83 % accuracy with using the rest 12 sets...|$|E
40|$|Frequency {{response}} analysis (FRA) {{has emerged}} as the de-facto industry standard condition-monitoring tool to assess mechanical integrity of transformer windings during its service life. It the prerequisite detection sensitivity and customized portable commercial instruments are also available. Considering its importance and taking cognizance of its hidden potential, international bodies, viz., IEEE, IEC, and CIGRE have published standards/guides on its use and interpretation. In spite of all the progress witnessed over the past two decades, FRA has still not attained the status of a diagnostics tool. Probing the vast literature and research carried out in this points to the fact that lack of a rigorous mathematical basis to explain the underlying complex processes is, perhaps, {{one of the main reasons}} for the present predicament of FRA method. How-ever, it must be acknowledged that domain-knowledge is di cult to generalize in this. Having said that, the diagnostic part, which involves, the task of working back-wards starting from the FRA data to interpret a winding damage, locate it, and assess its severity, has so far remained teasingly elusive. As a consequence, FRA continues to remain as a sensitive condition-monitoring tool. Given its inherent potential, this situation seems to be a paradox, and so, calls for investigations. Once a mechanical damage has been detected by FRA, the next task is to locate its position and estimate its severity. An engineer expects FRA to provide these answers, so that corrective action, if needed, can be determined and initiated. In this context, even though FRA has attained global acceptance as a monitoring tool, it has failed as a diagnostic tool. Therefore, e orts that aim to address this issue are desirable. Driven by this motivation, the author's thesis proposes to explore a new school of thought in this direction, viz., to theoretically analyze the problem of localization of an incipient/minor mechanical damage (displacement in particular) and also assess its severity. Such an investigation seems to have not been undertaken previously. So, the goal is to establish a relationship to capture the complex interactions that exist between specific winding damages, winding parameters, and their overall in hence on the natural frequency deviations observable in the FRA data. Hence, exploring this possibility, subject to the constraint that the proposed method shall use inputs that are measurable at the terminals, becomes the primary objective of this research. In this thesis, a generalized analytical framework for handling winding displacements and FRA data has been successfully formulated. The formulation provides a general platform for localization and severity assessment of true radial and <b>axial</b> <b>winding</b> dis-placements occurring in an actual winding. An analytical solution becomes possible mainly due to manipulation of the system matrix, i. e., to consider the harmonic sum of squares of natural frequencies, instead of just the natural frequencies. This manipulation leads to an elegant closed-form expression that connects the displacement location and its severity, to changes in natural frequencies. For its implementation, short circuit natural frequencies and a few other terminal measurements are the only inputs that are necessary. This formulation is initially used in Chapter- 3 to demonstrate localization of radial displacement in an isolated, actual, single, air-cored continuous-disk winding. Armed with this success, the supplicant proceeds further to show (in Chapter- 4) how a minor manipulation of the formulation renders it suitable for localization of actual axial displacements as well. Extensive experimental verification was done and the results are encouraging. Accuracy of localization of radial/axial displacement is uniformly good for all positions, and so is the estimation of severity. Further details are presented in the thesis...|$|E

The model results are compared with those from the reanalysis data of the National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) and the operational objective analysis data of JMA and with the functions inferred from the observed length of day (LOD) and polar motion. The annual term of the simulated <b>axial</b> <b>wind</b> AAM function (dimensionless relative angular momentum of atmosphere due to zonal wind) during 1984 - 1994 agrees well with those from the two analysis data sets and roughly with the inferred function from LOD, while the semi-annual term is considerably over-estimated, suggesting an incompleteness in the simulated subtropical zonal winds. The annual term of the simulated equatorial pressure AAM function (dimensionless atmospheric inertia products due to atmospheric mass redistribution) is considerably over-estimated with respect to those from the two analysis data sets, presumably due to the large simulated redistribution of atmospheric mass between the Eurasian continent and the North Pacific Ocean.

Both stratification and axial salt transport show strong responses to <b>axial</b> <b>wind</b> forcing. While stratification is always reduced by up-estuary winds, stratification shows an increase-to-decrease transition as down-estuary wind stress increases, due to the competition between wind-induced straining of the axial salinity gradient and direct wind mixing. A horizontal Richardson number modified to include wind straining/mixing is shown to reasonably represent the transition. A regime classification diagram is proposed. <b>Axial</b> <b>winds</b> also exert important controls on lateral circulation. When the water column mixes vertically, surface Ekman transport is not a significant contributor to lateral circulation. Instead, wind-induced differential advection of the axial salinity gradient establishes lateral salinity gradients that in turn drive lateral circulation. A Hansen-Rattray-like scaling shows good predictive skill for variations in lateral flow. Event-integrated sediment transport is from channel to shoals during down-estuary winds but reversed for up-estuary winds. Accounting for wind-waves results in an order-of-magnitude increase in lateral sediment fluxes. The effects of wind-waves and seagrass beds on nearshore (< 2 m) sediment dynamics are explored separately using a nearshore model (NearCoM). Without seagrass beds, wind-waves greatly enhance sediment resuspension, providing a large sediment source for lateral sediment transport. Seagrass beds attenuate wind-wave energy and trap sediments, thus reducing net sediment loss from the shallow shoal...|$|R

40|$|The {{atmospheric}} {{angular momentum}} {{is closely related}} to variations in the Earth rotation. The atmospheric excitation function (AEF), or namely atmospheric effective angular momentum function, is introduced in studying the atmospheric excitation of the Earth's variable rotation. It may be separated into two portions, i. e, the "wind" terms due to the atmospheric motion relative to the mantle and the "pressure" terms due to the variations of atmospheric mass distribution evident through surface pressure changes. The AEF wind terms during the period of 1948 - 2004 are re-processed from the NCEP/NCAR (National Centers for Environmental Prediction-National Center for Atmospheric Research) reanalysis 6 -hourly wind and pressure fields. Some previous calculations were approximate, in that the wind terms were integrated from an isobaric lower boundary of 1000 hPa. To consider the surface topography effect, however, the AEF is computed by integration using the winds from the Earth's surface to 10 hPa, the top atmospheric model level, instead of from 1000 hPa. For these two cases, only a minor difference, equivalent to approx. 0. 004 milliseconds in length-of-day variation, exists with respect to the <b>axial</b> <b>wind</b> term. However, considerable differences, equivalent to 5 - 6 milliarcseconds in polar motion, are found regarding equatorial wind terms. We further compare the total equatorial AEF (with and without the topographic effect) with the polar motion excitation function (PMEF) during the period of 1980 - 2003.

In this paper, a three-dimensional near field flow analysis has been performed for <b>axial</b> and cross <b>wind</b> loading to understand the airflow characteristics surrounding a trucklike bluff body.

40|$|The paper {{presents}} the results of the experimental investigation carried out on a transformer to obtain frequency response data under axial displacements. These displacements were physically simulated to study and identify the various parameters that influence the frequency responses. Transfer Function using real rational polynomial technique was computed from the frequency response data. Various transfer function parameters were computed for reference and simulated faulty frequency response data. These parameters are then analyzed to relate changes to characterize the defects. The analysis presented based on the transfer function characteristic parameter changes will help in diagnosing transformer <b>winding</b> <b>axial</b> displacements...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThis paper {{represents}} an experimental {{investigation of the}} transient heat transfer on a solid base plate (mimic to skin) covered by fire retardant fabric (Kevlar® 49), under hot air jet impingement. The study {{was carried out by}} a fabricated attachment with an <b>axial</b> flow <b>wind</b> tunnel for horizontal hot air jet impingement. The hot air jet was impinged on a vertical base plate at different velocities and temperatures. A set of experimental conditions was considered to understand the various heat transfer phenomenon. The hot air jet temperatures were 115 and 125 °C respectively and jet velocities were 12, 15, and 19 ms− 1 respectively at the exit point of the nozzle. The surface temperatures of the solid base plate are used to calculate the heat flux, local heat transfer coefficient, and Nusselt numbers. The maximum heat transfer is found on base plate, whilst the maximum decrease of heat flux is observed on fire retardant fabric. This experimental model can enhance the understanding and insights of the heat transfer process through permeable fabric...|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} provides {{insight into}} changes in volumetric flushing of the Tampa Bay estuary caused by synoptic scale wind events. The two main studies of this dissertation involve 1) using wavelet analysis {{to investigate the}} link between the El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and the frequency and strength of volumetric flushing driven by synoptic variability and 2) using a multi-decadal model simulation to examine how extratropical/winter storms and hurricanes affect the overall flushing rates for Tampa Bay, FL. In the first study, two analyses are performed on 55 years of observational data to investigate the effect of multiple small wind events on estuarine flushing. First I use subtidal observed water level as a proxy for mean tidal height to estimate the rate of volumetric bay outflow. Second, I use wavelet analysis on sea level and wind data to isolate the synoptic sea level and surface wind variance. For both analyses the long-term monthly climatology is removed to focus on the volumetric and wavelet variance anomalies. The overall correlation between the Oceanic Niño index and volumetric anomalies is small (r 2 = 0. 097) due to the seasonal dependence on the ENSO response. The mean monthly climatology between the synoptic wavelet variance of elevation and <b>axial</b> <b>winds</b> have similar seasonal behavior. During the winter, El Niño (La Niña) increases (decreases) the synoptic variability, but decreases (increases) it during the summer. The difference in winter El Niño/La Niña wavelet variances is about 20 % of the climatological value. ENSO can swing the synoptic flushing of the bay by 0. 22 bay volumes per month. These changes in circulation associated with synoptic variability have the potential to impact mixing and transport within the bay. In the second study, volumetric changes from large scale weather events are investigated using a numerical circulation model simulation (1975 - 2006) to find the cumulative impact of flushing on the bay by extreme events. The strong wind speeds, duration of high winds and wind direction during these events all affect the amount of water flushed {{in and out of the}} estuary. Normalized volume anomalies are largest when wind components blow up/down the estuary in the NE/SW direction. Wind induced normalized flushing rates for all 10 extratropical/winter storms range from 12 % to 40 % and from 14 % to 40 % for all 10 hurricanes. All storms discussed in this study caused winds greater than 15 m s- 1 (~ 30 knots). The direction of the winds had an impact on the flushing rates during these extreme events. Storm 9 (February 1998) and Hurricane Gabrielle (September 2001) experienced the smallest total volume changes (14 % and 13 %). Both storms experienced weak <b>axial</b> and co-axial <b>winds</b> causing volume changes to be small. The Storm of the Century (March 1993) and Hurricane Frances (September 2004) saw the largest total volume changes of 40 %. They both had strong winds blowing in the NE direction. Hurricane Frances had two wind peaks and lingered in the area for approximately 48 hours, so both strength and duration of winds played a large role in the total volume change. Total inflow and outflow rates per year show that there is year to year variability of flushing in Tampa Bay...|$|R
50|$|Both the {{magnitude}} of wind mixing {{and the availability of}} light at the ocean's surface are affected across a range of space- and time-scales. The most characteristic of these is the seasonal cycle (caused by the consequences of the Earth's <b>axial</b> tilt), although <b>wind</b> magnitudes additionally have strong spatial components. Consequently, primary production in temperate regions such as the North Atlantic is highly seasonal, varying with both incident light at the water's surface (reduced in winter) and the degree of mixing (increased in winter). In tropical regions, such as the gyres {{in the middle of the}} major basins, light may only vary slightly across the year, and mixing may only occur episodically, such as during large storms or hurricanes.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Magnetic {{suspended}} {{wind turbine}} generator is widely studied due to its low loss, low maintenance cost and high reliability. However, affected by the small stiffness of magnetic bearing, the generator shaft supported by magnetic bearing will be eccentric. Therefore, the performance of generator will be affected. A horizontal <b>axial</b> magnetic suspended <b>wind</b> turbine generator is designed in this paper. The variations of shaft eccentricity and Maxwell force of rotor supported by different bearing stiffness are studied. The {{results show that the}} shaft eccentricity affects the performance of generator; and the bearing stiffness is the key to reduce those effects. The magnetic bearing designed in this paper can meet the requirements of generator...|$|R
40|$|Radiative {{transfer}} calculations {{in three}} dimensions are presented to investigate dynamic structures in extended winds of massive stars We discuss {{the development of the}} new radiative transfer code Wind 3 D. It solves the non-LTE radiative transport problem in moving stellar atmosphere models in three geometric dimensions. The code accepts arbitrary 3 D velocity fields in Cartesian geometry without assumptions of <b>axial</b> symmetry. <b>Wind</b> 3 D is currently implemented as a fully parallelized (exact) accelerated lambda iteration scheme with a two level atom formulation. The numerical transfer scheme is efficient and very accurate to trace small variations of local velocity gradients on line opacity in strongly scattering dominated extended stellar winds. We investigate the detailed formation of P Cygni line profiles observed in ultraviolet spectra of massive stars. We compute the detailed shape of these resonance lines to model local enhancements of line opacity that can for instance be caused by clumping in supersonically expanding winds. Wind 3 D will be applied to hydrodynamic models to investigate physical properties of discrete absorption line components.
