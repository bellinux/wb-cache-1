40|$|Starting {{from the}} 80 s, {{business}} incubators have been increasingly considered as relevant actors for public policies {{aimed at the}} development of the new ventures. In Italy, the law n. 221 / 2012 has pushed forward a renewed interest for this topic, since it introduces the idea of “certified” incubator of start-ups, by listing a set of requirements that qualify a “good” incubator. Despite the recent activity of the policy makers and the large number of scholars’ contributions, there is still a lack of understanding about how incubation processes impact on {{the development of the}} start-ups and there is not a clear assessment of the effectiveness of incubators’ contribution (Tavoletti, 2013) in the innovation landscape. Given this background, our research aims at understanding whether or not mediation services offered by certified incubators help start-ups to develop early business-relationships. We want to shed light on the link between the characteristics of incubation process and the development of early market-relationships of the hosted start-ups. This topic is particularly relevant as the creation of early market-relationships is considered a “critical” step in newventures’ development, due to both an under-developed marketing function (Aaboen, Dubois, & Lind, 2011; La Rocca, Ford & Snehota, 2013) <b>and</b> <b>several</b> <b>liabilities</b> that affect start-ups (Roseira, Ramos, Maia, & Henneberg, 2014).

Despite numerous studies suggesting how incremental product innovation should be successfully undertaken, many firms still struggle {{with this type of}} innovation. In this paper, we use an institutional perspective to investigate why established firms in the financial services industry struggle with their complex incremental product innovation efforts. We argue that although the impact of micro institutional forces is often overlooked in innovation studies, these forces matter for innovation success. Our study complements the existing innovation literature and provides an additional explanation why incremental product innovation is highly complex <b>and</b> suffers from <b>several</b> <b>liabilities</b> in established firms. Using qualitative data from the Dutch financial services sector collected over the period 1997 - 2002, the paper illustrates how micro institutional forces at the business unit level affect complex incremental product innovation and how the interaction of these forces delivers their impact. complex incremental product innovation;financial services sector;micro institutional forces;neo-institutional theory...|$|R

[...] The court rejected the state's arguments that damages {{should be limited to}} the fair market value of the land {{at the time of the}} transaction, without pre-judgement interest (the approximate method used by the Indian Claims Commission for statutory claims against the federal government). That same year, the court rejected ejectment as a remedy, thus ensuring that the Cayuga would be unable to recover possession of the lands; their remedy would be limited to monetary damages. The court also determined that joint <b>and</b> <b>several</b> <b>liability</b> would be inappropriate, and thus that the defendants would require separate trials. Finally, the court determined that the state would be able to offset from the eventual damages any amount of consideration paid in the original conveyances as well as the value of infrastructure improvements; moreover, the plaintiff's anthropologist's testimony would not be admissible on the question of valuation, the jury would not be able to hear evidence on laches from either party, the Eleventh Amendment would not bar damages, and the plaintiffs would not be able to claim emotional, psychological, or cultural damagesonly the economic value of the land.|$|E
2500|$|All {{directors}} owe {{the same}} fiduciary duties and directors each have joint <b>and</b> <b>several</b> <b>liability</b> so in reality ‘split’ or ‘mixed’ boards is a marketing aphorism and distinction without a difference. [...] Independent {{research has found}} that professional firms of quality directors have large reputational investment with high incentive to perform well and consistently outperform proprietorships. [...] This research found that “directors from a top ten firm are almost twice as likely as directors from smaller firms to obtain a new directorship.” [...] This implies that directors are even more likely to be hired when their firm has a larger client base, and thus more reputational capital to protect. The single firm focus is counterfactual to the risk analysis. Unquestionably the area of greatest risk within any fund is within its investment portfolio. [...] Enormous authority over the fund affairs is often entrusted to the investment manager as a single individual, from a single firm, yet it would be universally accepted to be counterproductive and inefficient to appoint another manager from a different firm to manage the same portfolio at the same time, or another auditor from different firm to audit the same fund at the same time. [...] It is not obvious, other than the aforementioned marketing reason, why any one believes that appointing directors from different firms is an effective mechanism for eliciting independent judgment and deliberation than those doing the deciding work for a (single) firm instead.|$|E

40|$|Due to an {{emerging}} Brazilian doctrine of environmental liability, lenders now {{face the prospect}} of lawsuits that seek remediation of, or compensation for, environmental damages resulting from their borrowers 2 ̆ 7 activities. Unprecedented judicial decisions (based on a strict, joint <b>and</b> <b>several</b> environmental <b>liability</b> for lenders) broad standing, and ongoing initiatives of the government portray financial institutions as the best target to pursue environmental protection in the country.

40|$|This note {{proposes a}} new set-up for the fund backing the Single Resolution Mechanism (SRM). The {{proposed}} fund is a Multi-Tier Resolution Fund (MTRF), restricting the joint <b>and</b> <b>several</b> supranational <b>liability</b> {{to a limited}} range of losses, bounded by national liability at the upper and the lower end. The layers are, in ascending order: a national fund (first losses), a European fund (second losses), the national budget (third losses), the ESM (fourth losses, as a backup for sovereigns). The system works like a reinsurance scheme, providing clear limits to European-level joint liability, and therefore confining moral hazard. At the same time, it allows for some degree of risk sharing, which is important for financial stability if shocks to the financial system are exogenous (e. g., of a supranational macroeconomic nature). The text has four parts. Section A describes {{the operation of the}} Multi-Tier Resolution Fund, assuming the fund capital to be fully paid-in (“Steady State“). Section B deals with the build-up phase of the fund capital (“Build up“). Section C discusses how the proposal deals with the apparent incentive conflicts.

40|$|In Canada, {{appointed}} actuaries {{are required}} to opine on {{the adequacy of the}} policy liabilities for property-casualty insurers. Policy liabilities include both claims <b>and</b> premium <b>liabilities.</b> <b>Several</b> papers have been written and actuarial techniques have been developed to estimate claims liabilities. Premium liabilities, however, have received little, virtually no attention in the actuarial literature. To date, we believe that only Canadian actuaries have been evaluating these liabilities. However, other countries are following that lead. We understand that in some states, regulators will soon require actuarial opinions on the adequacy of unearned premiums for policies with terms exceeding twelve months. The evaluation of premium liabilities consists of examining all related assets and liabilities to ensure that the anticipated net costs to discharge an insurer's obligations with respect to its insurance and reinsurance contracts, except its claim liabilities, are provided for. This paper intends to provide the practicing actuary with some guidelines on the evaluation of the premium liabilities. We will review the individual components of the premium liabilities and the related regulatory requirements and CIA recommendations. Finally, we will present an actuarial approach to evaluate the equity in the unearned premium, the unearned premium deficiency and the deferred policy acquisition expenses.

40|$|ABSTRACT—TransLink {{currently}} has <b>several</b> <b>liabilities</b> in its security policy making it vulnerable to {{attacks in the}} form of fraud and fare evasion. Exploitation of the newly celebrated U-pass program may be approached from several levels. The economic implications of these losses significantly impact TransLink’s business model. Hence, to drive revenue opportunities while upgrading quality of service, a smart card TransLink system is proposed. Smart cards are by evolution more functionally secure and scalable than magnetic stripe technologies currently utilized by TransLink. They also address other transit challenges such as rate of passenger processing and validation of fare. An implementation of a secure smart card system will both transform a legacy security system and enhance Translink’s value proposition to customers.
