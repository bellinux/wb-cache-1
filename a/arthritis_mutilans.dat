50|$|<b>Arthritis</b> <b>mutilans</b> {{is a rare}} medical {{condition}} involving severe inflammation damaging the joints of the hands and feet, and resulting in deformation and problems with moving the affected areas; it can also affect the spine. As an uncommon arthropathy, <b>arthritis</b> <b>mutilans</b> was originally described as affecting the hands, feet, fingers, and/or toes, but can refer in general to severe derangement of any joint damaged by arthropathy. First described in modern medical literature by Marie and Leri in 1913, in the hands, <b>arthritis</b> <b>mutilans</b> {{is also known as}} opera glass hand (la main en lorgnette in French), or chronic absorptive arthritis.

50|$|<b>Arthritis</b> <b>mutilans</b> occurs {{mainly in}} people who have {{pre-existing}} psoriatic arthritis, but can occur, if less often, in advanced rheumatoid arthritis; it can also occur independently. Psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis are interrelated heritable diseases, occurring with greater heritable frequency than rheumatoid arthritis, primary Sjogren's syndrome and thyroid disease. Psoriasis affects 2-3% of the Caucasian population, and psoriatic arthritis affects up to 30% of those. <b>Arthritis</b> <b>mutilans</b> presents in about 5-16% of psoriatic arthritis cases, involves osteolysis of the DIP and PIP joints, and can include bone edema, bone erosions, and new bone growth. Most often psoratic arthitis is seronegative for rheumatoid factor (occurring in only about 13% of cases), and has genetic risk factor overlap with ankylosing spondylitis with HLA-B27, IL-23R77, and IL-1, however, as of 2016, immunopathogenesis is unclear.|$|E
5000|$|Enthesitis {{can assist}} in {{differentiating}} arthritis mutilans' parent condition psoriatic arthritis from rheumatoid arthritis and osteoarthritis, with evidence in plain radiographs (x-rays) and MRI as periostitis, new bone formation, and bone erosions. Dactylitis, spondylitis and sacroiliitis are common with the parent condition psoriatic arthritis, but are not in rheumatoid arthritis. MRI bone edema scores are high in <b>arthritis</b> <b>mutilans</b> and correlate with radiographic measures of joint damage, although they may not correlate with disease activity. A source of significant pain, bone marrow edema (or lesions, using newer terminology), can be detected on MRI or with ultrasonography by signals of excessive water in bone marrow. Specifically, bone marrow edema can be detected within bone on T1-weighted images as poorly defined areas of low signal, with a high signal on T2-weighted fat-suppressed images. Comparatively, with <b>arthritis</b> <b>mutilans</b> in rheumatoid arthritis, bone marrow edema often involves the [...] bone layer, while the condition as a subtype of psoriatic arthritis includes a greater extent of marrow edema, expanding to diaphysis.|$|E

30|$|Our results {{indicate}} that MRH is a worldwide disease with cases {{from around the globe}} and from various ethnic/racial backgrounds. More reports in White patients from Western countries may be attributed to higher awareness of the disease in these populations. MRH is easy to mistake for other inflammatory joint conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis or psoriatic arthritis, but the distinctive clinical, radiographic, and histologic features can aid in differentiating these diseases. Early disease may be difficult to diagnose prior to development of bone erosions. As the disease progresses, joint space narrowing of the distal interphalangeal DIPs, marginal erosions, and absence of new bone formation is a unique feature of MRH. Joint space narrowing and periarticular osteopenia may be present. <b>Arthritis</b> <b>mutilans</b> may be seen in untreated advanced disease (Islam et al. 2013).

40|$|Psoriasis is {{an ancient}} {{inflammatory}} disease, first described in the Corpus Hippocraticum. Hip-pocrates (460 - 377 BCE) used the term psora, meaning “to itch”. Although the etiology of the disease remains unknown, it appears to result {{from a combination of}} genetic and environmental fac-tors. It is frequently inherited, but not following a classical autosomal mendelian profile. It is a life-long inflammatory disease with spontaneous re-missions and exacerbations. Approximately 3 % of the population worldwide is afflicted by psoriasis. Many factors trigger or exacerbate psoriasis, in-cluding bacterial pharyngitis, stress, HIV- 1, and various medications (e. g., lithium and β−blockers). Although the disease is characterized by prolifer-ation of the epidermis, the immune system has a prominent role in its development (1). Five to 42 % of patients with psoriasis have psori-atic arthritis, a disabling and occasionally destruc-tive joint disease. The course of this form varies, with some having mild changes and others severe, rapid destruction of joints. Psoriatic arthritis is usu-ally seronegative for rheumatoid factor and pre-sents in several characteristic forms: oligoarticular disease, distal interphalangeal arthritis, spondylitis or sacroiliitis and <b>arthritis</b> <b>mutilans</b> (2). Cutaneous lesions precede joint disease in 60 - 70 % of patients and the two begin simultaneously in 10 - 20 %. Arthritis precedes psoriasis in about 20 % of pa-tients (2, 3).

Times of disease progression are interval-censored when progression status is only known at a series of assessment times. This situation arises routinely in clinical trials and cohort studies when events of interest are only detectable upon imaging, based on blood tests, or upon careful clinical examination. We consider the problem of selecting important prognostic biomarkers from a large set of candidates when disease progression status is only known at irregularly spaced and individual-specific assessment times. Penalized regression techniques (e. g., LASSO, adaptive LASSO, and SCAD) are adapted to handle interval-censored time of disease progression.

Data from the 36 -item Short Form Health Survey, Health Assessment Questionnaire and Dermatology Life Quality Index questionnaire were gathered and correlated with disease duration, pain, and general well-being (visual analogue scale). The controls were 58 Swedish patients with long-standing psoriatic arthritis sine PAM. Results: Sixty-seven patients were included. Patients with PAM had a protracted disease history (3314 years) and disease onset at a relatively early age (30 +/- 12 years). Overall inflammatory activity at inclusion was mild to moderate. The mean number of mutilated joints was 8. 2 and gross deformity was found in 16 % of patients. Forty per cent were treated with biological and 32 % with conventional synthetic disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs. Forty-two per cent had retired early or were on sick leave. Impaired functional capacity with little or no ability to perform self-care or everyday tasks was reported by 21 % of the patients.

40|$|Although psoriatic {{arthritis}} (PsA) is a well-documented clinical entity, epidemiological, clinical and radiological studies of South African (SA) patients are scarce. To assess clinical, biochemical and radiological features in a single-centre SA cohort. We conducted a prospective {{assessment of the}} clinical, biochemical and radiological features of 384 consecutive patients with PsA seen at the rheumatology clinic at Prince Mshiyeni Memorial Hospital, Durban, SA, between January 2007 and December 2013. Patients were assessed at enrolment and 6 months after enrolment.

40|$|Background: The {{prevalence}} and clinical patterns of psoriatic arthritis (PsA) varies {{in different parts}} of the world and there is little clinical and epidemiological data from the Indian subcontinent. Aims: Our study was designed to evaluate the {{prevalence and}} clinical patterns of PsA in Indian patients. Methods: This was a non-interventional, cross-sectional study, in which 1149 consecutive psoriasis patients seen over 1 year were screened for PsA according to classification of psoriatic arthritis (CASPAR) criteria. Demographic and disease parameters were recorded including Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI), Nail Psoriasis Severity Index (NAPSI), and number of swollen and tender joints. Results: Among 1149 patients with psoriasis, 100 (8. 7 %) patients had PsA, of which 83 % were newly diagnosed. The most common pattern was symmetrical polyarthritis (58 %), followed by spondyloarthropathy 49 %, asymmetric oligoarthritis (21 %), isolated spondyloarthropathy (5 %), predominant distal interphalangeal arthritis (3 %), and <b>arthritis</b> <b>mutilans</b> (1 %). Enthesitis and dactylitis were present in 67 % and 26 % of cases, respectively. The mean number of swollen and tender joints were 3. 63 ± 3. 59 (range, 0 - 22) and 7. 76 ± 6. 03 (range, 1 - 26), respectively. Nail changes were present in 87 % of the cases. The median PASI and NAPSI of the subjects with PsA was 3. 6 and 20, respectively. There was no significant correlation of number of swollen/tender joints with PASI or NAPSI. Conclusion: There is a relatively low prevalence of PsA among Indian psoriasis patients presenting to dermatologists. No correlation was found between the severity of skin and nail involvement and articular disease...|$|E

To determine the prevalence and clinical characteristics of psoriatic <b>arthritis</b> <b>mutilans</b> (PAM) in the Nordic countries. Patients with putative PAM aged ≥ 18 years were recruited. Fifty-nine patients were included after clinical examination. The prevalence of PAM in the adult Nordic population {{was estimated to be}} 3. 69 per million inhabitants [95 % confidence interval (CI) 2. 75 - 4. 63]. The female to male ratio was close to 1 : 1. The mean age of skin disease onset was 25 years and the mean age of onset of joint disease was 30 years. The onset of skin disease was 2 years earlier among female patients. At inclusion, the mean duration of arthritis was 27 ± 11 years for male patients and 33 ± 11 years for female patients. PAM was most frequently seen in the distal interphalangeal (DIP) joints of the toes, followed by the IP joint of the thumb and the DIP joint of the little finger on the left hand. Female and male patients had similar numbers of painful and swollen joints. Enthesitis was found in 19 patients (32 %), while 38 patients (64 %) had a history of dactylitis. Twenty-three of these 38 patients (61 %) had a history of dactylitis in the same finger/toe as they had PAM. At the time of inclusion, 45 % of the patients were found to have clear or almost clear skin. PAM in the Nordic countries has a low prevalence, with only three to five cases per million inhabitants. The majority of the patients present with mild skin disease...|$|E
