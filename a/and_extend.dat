5|$|Dating {{back to the}} {{original}} signposting of the state highway system, M-19 initially connected Detroit with Port Huron and Port Austin in 1919. In late 1926, the routing was altered to shorten it to Bad Axe on the north and Richmond on the south. Additional changes in the 1950s and 1960s updated the highway to finish paving the roadway <b>and</b> <b>extend</b> it southward to its present terminus.|$|E
5|$|Pete {{presents}} Herb's proposal at a partners meeting, guaranteeing SCDP {{will lose}} the account {{if they do not}} comply. Don spurns the idea and leaves, but the remaining partners reluctantly agree to offer Joan $50,000. They decide to withhold Christmas bonuses <b>and</b> <b>extend</b> their credit line to cover the cost, unaware that Lane had already extended the credit line by $50,000 in the previous episode.|$|E

50|$|Anlaby Hall was {{constructed}} around 1680, <b>and</b> <b>extended</b> {{in the early}} 18th century with modifications in the 19th century. Anlaby House {{was built in the}} late 18th century, <b>and</b> <b>extended</b> in the 19th.|$|R
50|$|The route {{originates}} from a junction {{with the}} Ring Route <b>and</b> <b>extends</b> westward; Route 2 also originates from this same point <b>and</b> <b>extends</b> eastward. The route eventually terminates at a junction with the Higashi-Meihan Expressway.|$|R
5|$|The {{advantage}} of this re-statement is that one can exploit theorems from linear algebra on {{the maximum number of}} linearly independent, simultaneously perpendicular vectors. This gives another way to calculate the maximum number of solutions <b>and</b> <b>extend</b> the theorem to higher-dimensional spaces.|$|E
5|$|The {{mandible}} (lower jaw) is robust. The two masseteric ridges, which anchor {{some of the}} chewing muscles, {{are joined}} together as a single crest {{for a portion of}} their length <b>and</b> <b>extend</b> forward to a point below the first molar. The capsular process, a raising of the mandibular bone at the back end of the lower incisor, is well developed.|$|E
5|$|Work {{began in}} 2008 to {{extensively}} refurbish <b>and</b> <b>extend</b> Uxbridge Lido, and it reopened {{to the public}} in February 2010 as the Hillingdon Sports and Leisure Complex. On 8 September 2010 the 75th anniversary of the first opening of the Lido was celebrated at the pool.|$|E

5|$|After work began, it was {{determined}} that the repairs needed were more extensive, costly, and time-consuming than expected, and NJDOT estimated that rehabilitation could cost more than $1.2billion. In 2009, NJDOT estimated that it would take a decade before the state could afford to rehabilitate or replace the structure. In a controversial move in 2011, Governor Chris Christie directed the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey (PANYNJ) to divert money originally earmarked for the Access to the Region's Core rail project to highway projects. The agency agreed to pay $1.8billion to partially fund efforts to rehabilitate the skyway and Route139, replace Wittpenn Bridge, <b>and</b> <b>extend</b> US1/9 Truck, all part of the larger distribution network in the Port of New York and New Jersey.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{the advent}} of iron {{reinforced}} plows and other improved methods of crop cultivation, the regional environmental conditions placed limits on the practicality <b>and</b> <b>extend</b> of land tillage, but various grains, beans and peas were grown. The dense forest coverage {{on the other hand}} facilitated gathering and was more amenable to the raising of farm animals, which involved all of the major species, including in particular the small, forest type horses. The horses constituted an important element of the Baltic tribes' culture – men of the upper socioeconomic status were often buried with their horses and even together with their fancy horsemanship gear.|$|E
5|$|During the 1960s and 1970s, various freeway {{projects}} in the Detroit area were cancelled or scaled back in scope. The route of I-96 along Grand River Avenue was cancelled in response to freeway revolts in the city, and a new routing along the C Railroad right-of-way in Livonia was used instead. Plans to transfer the Davison Freeway in the 1970s to state control <b>and</b> <b>extend</b> it west to I-96 (Jeffries Freeway) and east to a Van Dyke Freeway (extended M-53) were dropped. Another freeway project near Lansing, the Van Atta Connector, was proposed in 1961 to provide an eastern freeway beltway around East Lansing, but by 1981 the highway's impact to neighboring elementary schools along with larger economic impacts led to the project's cancellation.|$|E
25|$|The first North Coast railway {{was opened}} between Murwillumbah, Byron Bay and Lismore in 1894 <b>and</b> <b>extended</b> to Casino in 1903 and Grafton in 1905. A branch line {{was built to}} Kyogle in 1910 <b>and</b> <b>extended</b> to South Brisbane in 1930.|$|R
50|$|The {{first section}} {{electrified}} was Nippori - Matsudo (at 1,500 V DC) in 1936, <b>and</b> <b>extended</b> to Toride in 1949. The Toride - Kusano section was electrified at 20 kV AC between 1961 <b>and</b> 1963, <b>and</b> <b>extended</b> to Iwanumi in 1967.|$|R
50|$|The {{length of}} the {{forewings}} is 19.6-21.5 mm for males and 19.6-21 mm for females. The forewing ground color is brown with the submarginal band dark brown, undulating <b>and</b> <b>extending</b> from the apex towards the tornus, delimiting a slightly darker area. The marginal band is dark brown <b>and</b> <b>extends</b> from the apex towards the tornus. The fringe is grayish brown. The hindwing color is brown with the submarginal band dark brown, undulating <b>and</b> <b>extending</b> from the apex the towards tornus. It is convex in each cell. The marginal band is dark brown <b>and</b> <b>extends</b> from the apex towards the tornus. The postmarginal and tornal areas are pale ocher and the fringe is grayish brown.|$|R
5|$|Edward I {{became the}} king of England in 1272. Edward had {{extensive}} experience of warfare and sieges, having fought in Wales in 1257, led the six-month siege of Kenilworth Castle in 1266 and joined the crusade to North Africa in 1270. He had seen numerous European fortifications, including the planned walled town and castle design at Aigues-Mortes. On assuming the throne, one of Edward's first actions was to renovate <b>and</b> <b>extend</b> the royal fortress of the Tower of London. Edward was also responsible for building a sequence of planned, usually walled, towns called bastides across Gascony {{as part of his}} attempt to strengthen his authority in the region. Edward also authorised new planned towns to be built across England.|$|E
5|$|From {{the initial}} attack, only the Canadians {{on the extreme}} right and the 3rd Australian Brigade on the extreme left were able to capture and hold their set objectives. Over {{the course of the}} next three days, severe {{fighting}} took place and further troops were drawn in to hold <b>and</b> <b>extend</b> the gains of 3 May. On 6 May, the Germans launched a counter-attack which forced the 3rd Brigade to withdraw from their trenches; it was during this engagement that Howell was to perform the act which was to earn him the Victoria Cross.|$|E
5|$|In 1883, the Duke of Buckingham {{planned to}} upgrade the route to main line {{standards}} <b>and</b> <b>extend</b> the line to Oxford, creating the shortest route between Aylesbury and Oxford. Despite {{the backing of the}} wealthy Ferdinand de Rothschild, investors were deterred by costly tunnelling. In 1888 a cheaper scheme was proposed in which the line would be built to a lower standard and avoid tunnelling. In anticipation, the line was named the Oxford & Aylesbury Tramroad.|$|E

50|$|Under RGGI, {{sources are}} {{required}} to possess CO2 allowances equal to their CO2 emissions over a three-year control period. A CO2 allowance represents a limited authorization to emit one ton of CO2. The first three-year control period took effect on January 1, 2009 <b>and</b> <b>extended</b> through December 31, 2011. The second three-year control period took effect on January 1, 2012 <b>and</b> <b>extended</b> through December 31, 2014.

5|$|In 2009, the CRS {{proposed}} four options: Option 1 was {{to continue}} the VH-71 program with Increment I and II versions; the additional cost was estimated at $10billion and the entry into service date was 2019. Option 2 was to restructure the program to provide 23 Increment I aircraft; at an additional cost of $6.4billion and would be operational by 2012. Option 3 was a restructure to provide 19 Increment I aircraft to replace the current fleet; the additional cost for this option was estimated at $5.6billion and the entry into service by 2012. The last option was to upgrade <b>and</b> <b>extend</b> life of current fleet {{at a cost of}} $1.4billion; however this would not meet the standards required for future presidential helicopters, and would require replacement sooner.|$|E
5|$|In 2014 the State Historic Preservation Board {{considered}} a boundary adjustment that removes {{a small area}} at the northeast corner but adds far more, primarily at the southeast. It would include a total of 200 new contributing properties <b>and</b> <b>extend</b> the district's period of significance to 1978, {{to take into account}} the city's urban renewal era. Most of the new areas had been found to be consistent with those already included in the district or accidentally excluded when the district was originally designated. Two years later the National Park Service officially approved the expansion.|$|E

5|$|In {{the earlier}} stages of its development, the wing-bud is not {{provided}} with special organs of respiration such as tracheation, as it resembles {{in this respect}} the other portions of the hypodermis {{of which it is}} still a part. It should be noted, however, that the histoblast is developed near a large trachea, a cross-section of which is shown in, which represents sections of these parts of the first, second, third and fourth instars respectively. At the same time the tracheoles uncoil, <b>and</b> <b>extend</b> in bundles in the forming vein-cavities of the wing-bud. At the molt that marks the beginning of the pupal stadium stage, they become functional. At the same time, the larval tracheoles degenerate; their function having been replaced by the wing tracheae.|$|E
5|$|None of the carpals (wrist bones) fit {{together}} precisely, suggesting {{the presence of}} a large amount of cartilage in the wrist, which would have stiffened it. All of the digits were able to hyperextend (bend backwards) until they nearly touched the wrist. When flexed, the middle digit would converge towards the first digit, while the third digit would twist inwards. The first digit of the hand bore the largest claw, which was permanently flexed so that it curved back towards the underside of the hand. Likewise, the middle claw may have been permanently flexed, while the third claw, also the smallest, was able to both flex <b>and</b> <b>extend.</b>|$|E
5|$|PHP is a {{general-purpose}} {{scripting language}} that is especially suited to server-side web development, in which case PHP generally runs on a web server.

It {{can also be used}} for command-line scripting and client-side graphical user interface (GUI) applications. PHP can be deployed on most web servers, many operating systems and platforms, and can be used with many relational database management systems (RDBMS). Most web hosting providers support PHP for use by their clients. It is available free of charge, and the PHP Group provides the complete source code for users to build, customize <b>and</b> <b>extend</b> for their own use.|$|E
