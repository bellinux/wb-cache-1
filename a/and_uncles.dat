5|$|Characteristic of Marko was his reverence {{and love}} for his mother, Jevrosima; he often sought her advice, {{following}} it even when it contradicted his own desires. She lived with Marko at his mansion in Prilep, his lodestar guiding him away from evil and toward good {{on the path of}} moral improvement and Christian virtues. Marko's honesty and moral courage are noteworthy in a poem in which he was the only person who knew the will of the late Tsar Dušan regarding his heir. Marko refused to lie in favour of the pretenders—his father <b>and</b> <b>uncles.</b> He said truthfully that Dušan appointed his son, Uroš, heir to the Serbian throne. This almost cost him his life, since Vukašin tried to kill him.|$|E
5|$|George {{was born}} in Hanover and {{inherited}} the titles and lands of the Duchy of Brunswick-Lüneburg from his father <b>and</b> <b>uncles.</b> A succession of European wars expanded his German domains during his lifetime, and in 1708 he was ratified as prince-elector of Hanover. At the age of 54, {{after the death of}} his second cousin Queen Anne of Great Britain, George ascended the British throne as the first monarch of the House of Hanover. Although over 50 Roman Catholics were closer to Anne by primogeniture, the Act of Settlement 1701 prohibited Catholics from inheriting the British throne; George was Anne's closest living Protestant relative. In reaction, Jacobites attempted to depose George and replace him with Anne's Catholic half-brother, James Francis Edward Stuart, but their attempts failed.|$|E
5|$|In {{the same}} year, Przemysł II {{concluded}} his first alliance with Duke Mestwin II of Pomerelia. At first {{an ally of}} the Margraves of Brandenburg, Mestwin II could expel his brother <b>and</b> <b>uncles</b> from Pomerania and became sole ruler in 1271, but shortly after he was defeated and even imprisoned by them; this caused him to cede the province of Gdańsk to Margrave Conrad of Brandenburg in exchange for aid against his foes. Despite Mestwin II retaining the feudal sovereignty over the territory, the Brandenburg Margraviate still occupied the main castles and fortresses of the city even after the restoration of Mestwin II in the ducal throne. With his knowledge that his forces are too weak against Brandenburg, the Pomeranian Duke decided then to make an alliance with the Greater Poland rulers, Bolesław the Pious (who probably was his first-cousin) and Przemysł II.|$|E

5|$|Manne's father <b>and</b> <b>uncles</b> were drummers. In {{his youth}} he admired {{many of the}} leading swing drummers of the day, {{especially}} Jo Jones and Dave Tough. Billy Gladstone, a colleague of Manne's father and the most admired percussionist on the New York theatrical scene, offered the teenage Shelly tips and encouragement. From that time, Manne rapidly developed his style in the clubs of 52nd Street in New York in the late 1930s and 1940s. His first professional job with a known big band was with the Bobby Byrne Orchestra in 1940. In those years, as he became known, he recorded with jazz stars like Coleman Hawkins, Charlie Shavers, and Don Byas.

5|$|The {{arrival of}} the Portuguese Royal Family in Rio de Janeiro in 1808 changed {{the lives of the}} Lima family. King Dom João VI {{embarked}} upon a series of wars of conquest which resulted in the expansion of Brazil's territory with the annexation of Cisplatina to the south and of French Guiana to the north. By 1818, Luís Alves' relatives, who were military officers and had served in the wars, had been ennobled. His grandfather, José Joaquim, {{became a member of the}} Order of Christ and Fidalgo Cavaleiro da Casa Real (Knight Nobleman of the Royal House). His father, Francisco de Lima, <b>and</b> <b>uncles</b> were also granted honors. Within two generations, the Lima family had risen from mere commoners to the ranks of Portugal's untitled nobility.|$|E
5|$|The war {{came to a}} {{disastrous}} end in 1828, as Brazil relinquished Cisplatina, which became the independent nation of Uruguay. Nonetheless, Luís Alves was promoted {{to the rank of}} major on 2 December 1828 and made second-in-command of the Emperor's Battalion in early 1829. During his stay in Montevideo, he met María Ángela Furriol González Luna. How far their relationship progressed is unknown, but {{there may have been a}} failed engagement. He returned to Rio de Janeiro and witnessed the increasing deterioration in Emperor PedroI's political position. A growing opposition to PedroI's policies eventually erupted into mass protests at the Field of Santana in downtown Rio de Janeiro on 6 April 1831. The situation became more ominous when several military units, led by Luís Alves' father <b>and</b> <b>uncles,</b> joined the protests.|$|E

5|$|Timmons {{was born}} in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, {{the son of a}} minister. He had a sister, Eleanor. Both of his parents, and several aunts <b>and</b> <b>uncles,</b> played the piano. From an early age Timmons studied music with an uncle, Robert Habershaw, who also taught McCoy Tyner.

He grew up in the same area as other future musicians, including the Heath brothers, Jimmy, Percy, and Tootie. Timmons' first professional performances were in his local area, often as a trio that included Tootie Heath on drums. After graduating from high school Timmons was awarded a scholarship to study at the Philadelphia Musical Academy.|$|E
5|$|The oldest {{preserved}} hagiography of Saint Jovan Vladimir {{is contained}} in Chapter 36 of the Chronicle of the Priest of Duklja. This chronicle, written in Latin, was completed between 1299 and 1301 {{in the town of}} Bar, then part of the Serbian Kingdom. Its author was Rudger, the Catholic Archbishop of Bar, who was probably of Czech origin. He wrote Chapter 36 as a summary of an older hagiography of Vladimir, written in Duklja most likely sometime between 1075 and 1089. This is the period when Duklja's rulers from the Vojislavljević dynasty endeavored to obtain the royal insignia from the Pope, and to elevate the Bar Bishopric to an archbishopric. They represented Prince Vladimir as the saintly founder of their dynasty; they were, according to the chronicle, descendants of his uncle Dragimir. The Vojislavljevićs succeeded in those endeavors, though Vladimir was not recognized as a saint by the Catholic Church. Despite its hagiographic nature, Chapter 36 contains a lot of reliable historical data. Chapters 34 and 35, which deal with Vladimir's father <b>and</b> <b>uncles,</b> are probably based on the prologue of the 11th-century hagiography. Chapters 1–33 of the chronicle are based on oral traditions and its author's constructions, and are for the most part dismissed by historians.|$|E
