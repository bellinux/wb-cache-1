5|$|As with {{obesity in}} adults, many factors {{contribute}} to the rising rates of childhood obesity. Changing diet <b>and</b> <b>decreasing</b> physical activity {{are believed to be}} the two most important causes for the recent increase in the incidence of child obesity. Because childhood obesity often persists into adulthood and is associated with numerous chronic illnesses, children who are obese are often tested for hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidemia, and fatty liver. Treatments used in children are primarily lifestyle interventions and behavioral techniques, although efforts to increase activity in children have had little success. In the United States, medications are not FDA approved for use in this age group. Multi-component behaviour change interventions that include changes to dietary and physical activity may reduce BMI in the short term in children aged 6 to 11 years, although the benefits are small and quality of evidence is low.|$|E
5|$|Benzodiazepines can {{be useful}} for {{short-term}} treatment of insomnia. Their use beyond 2 to 4 weeks is not recommended due {{to the risk of}} dependence. It is preferred that benzodiazepines be taken intermittently and at the lowest effective dose. They improve sleep-related problems by shortening the time spent in bed before falling asleep, prolonging the sleep time, and, in general, reducing wakefulness. However, they worsen sleep quality by increasing light sleep <b>and</b> <b>decreasing</b> deep sleep. Other drawbacks of hypnotics, including benzodiazepines, are possible tolerance to their effects, rebound insomnia, and reduced slow-wave sleep and a withdrawal period typified by rebound insomnia and a prolonged period of anxiety and agitation.|$|E
5|$|By {{early on}} October 9, the {{depression}} {{consisted of a}} circulation center {{without any of the}} associated deep convection {{that is one of the}} prerequisites of being a tropical cyclone. Several hurricane forecast models predicted Kyle to weaken until dissipation. After 24hours without significant convection, thunderstorms reformed to the southeast of the center on October 10 as the depression entered an area of warmer water temperatures. Environmental conditions became more favorable, with weakening wind shear <b>and</b> <b>decreasing</b> dry air. The depression continued tracking around a ridge, turning to the west and west-northwest toward the coast of Florida. Convection increased markedly early on October 11 as it turned northward ahead of an approaching cold front, and Kyle regained tropical storm status about 35miles (60km) east of the border between Florida and Georgia.|$|E

5|$|Cyclone Leon–Eline in February 2000 was the third-longest tracked {{tropical}} cyclone in the South-West Indian Ocean. On February1, a tropical low originated within the monsoon trough {{to the south}} of Indonesia, and would eventually become Tropical Cyclone Leon in the Australian basin. Moving westward, the storm fluctuated in strength due to changes in the atmosphere, mostly increasing <b>and</b> <b>decreasing</b> wind shear. After crossing 90°E, the Météo-France office in Réunion (MFR) began tracking the system as Tropical Storm Eline on February8. The storm continued across the Indian Ocean and intensified greatly as it approached the east coast of Madagascar. Late on February17, Eline made landfall near Mahanoro, with 10‑minute winds of 165km/h (105mph). The storm rapidly weakened over land, but restrengthened in the Mozambique Channel to reach peak 10‑minute winds of 185km/h (115mph). On February22, Eline made landfall about 80km (50mi) south of Beira, Mozambique near peak intensity and quickly weakened over land. The well-defined circulation moved across southern Africa, finally dissipating over eastern Namibia on February29.|$|E
5|$|Early on October15, {{an area of}} {{convection}} persisted about 750km (465mi) east-northeast of Guam. Initially {{the system}} was located within an area of moderate wind shear, although conditions gradually became more favorable for tropical cyclogenesis. At 12:00UTC on October15, the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) estimated that a tropical depression developed about 450km (280mi) east of Guam. A few hours later, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) issued a tropical cyclone formation alert before initiating advisories on Tropical Depression 26W early on October16. At that time, the depression was passing about 100km (65mi) southeast of Guam. After formation, the system moved west-southwestward under a ridge to the north. Its circulation consolidated as the thunderstorm activity organized, aided by warm sea surface temperatures <b>and</b> <b>decreasing</b> wind shear. At 06:00UTC on October16, the JMA upgraded the depression to Tropical Storm Francisco (1327).|$|E

Family planning via the use of modern birth control {{is one of the}} most cost-effective health interventions. For every dollar spent, the United Nations estimates that two to six dollars are saved. These cost savings are related to preventing unplanned pregnancies <b>and</b> <b>decreasing</b> the spread of sexually transmitted illnesses.

Since it is more established around humans in its range than either, it successfully competes with both species, though they may exclude it from nesting in holes. A survey by birdwatchers completed in 2000 found the Cape sparrow increasing in abundance in some suburban areas of South Africa (the northern Johannesburg area, and Pietermaritzburg) <b>and</b> <b>decreasing</b> in others (the southern Cape Town area). The house sparrow was reported decreasing in several urban areas, {{as it has in}} parts of Europe, declines which are attributed to factors including the increasing density of garden plantings and increases in predation.|$|E

5|$|Late on November8, Ida {{attained}} {{its peak}} intensity with winds of 105mph (165km/h) and a barometric pressure of 975mbar (hPa; 28.79inHg). Shortly thereafter, increasing wind shear and forward speed caused the storm to rapidly weaken to a tropical storm. Only {{a small area}} of convection remained near the center by the morning of November9. Despite the strong shear, the storm quickly re-organized, attaining hurricane status {{for a third time}} during the afternoon. Based on readings from a nearby oil platform and reconnaissance data, it was determined that Ida attained its secondary peak intensity near the southeast coast of Louisiana with winds of 85mph (140km/h). However, this intensification was short-lived as a combination of increasing wind shear <b>and</b> <b>decreasing</b> sea-surface temperatures induced weakening to a tropical storm within three hours.|$|E

When compared to their normal weight counterparts, obese workers on average have higher rates of absenteeism from work and take more disability leave, thus increasing costs for employers <b>and</b> <b>decreasing</b> productivity. A study examining Duke University employees found that people with a BMI over 40kg/m2 filed twice as many workers' compensation claims as those whose BMI was 18.5–24.9kg/m2. They also had more than 12times as many lost work days. The most common injuries in this group were due to falls and lifting, thus affecting the lower extremities, wrists or hands, and backs. The Alabama State Employees' Insurance Board approved a controversial plan to charge obese workers $25 a month for health insurance {{that would otherwise be}} free unless they take steps to lose weight and improve their health. These measures started in January 2010 and apply to those state workers whose BMI exceeds 35kg/m2 and who fail to make improvements in their health after one year.|$|E
5|$|The World Health Organization (WHO) {{predicts that}} {{overweight}} and obesity may soon replace more traditional public health concerns such as undernutrition {{and infectious diseases}} as the most significant cause of poor health. Obesity is a public health and policy problem because of its prevalence, costs, and health effects. The United States Preventive Services Task Force recommends screening for all adults followed by behavioral interventions in those who are obese. Public health efforts seek to understand and correct the environmental factors responsible for the increasing prevalence of obesity in the population. Solutions look at changing the factors that cause excess food energy consumption and inhibit physical activity. Efforts include federally reimbursed meal programs in schools, limiting direct junk food marketing to children, <b>and</b> <b>decreasing</b> access to sugar-sweetened beverages in schools.
