5000|$|The Johnston Laboratories at the University of Liverpool in Liverpool, England, {{performed}} {{a variety of}} pathology and medical research during the 20th century. They are now located in the Johnston Building. The Laboratories were founded by early University benefactor and ship owner William Johnston and formally opened on 9 May 1903. [...] Research <b>activities</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Laboratories</b> were documented in the Thompson Yates and Johnston Laboratories Report by the University of Liverpool Press.

50|$|In {{the years}} {{immediately}} after {{the conclusion of the}} First World War, the <b>activities</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>laboratories</b> again expanded, becoming the first facility in the world to mass-produce the newly discovered anti-diabetic drug, insulin under the supervision of Defries and Charles Herbert Best. Given the high demand and the production needs (and following the recent construction of the Hart House student center), additional space was obtained in the newly vacated campus YMCA building. In 1923, the Antitoxin Laboratory facilities in the Department of Hygiene together with the farm facilities were consolidated under the name, Connaught Laboratories.|$|E
40|$|AbstractSemiconductor {{companies}} in Japan are making major investments in quantum devices technology. The interest in quantum devices by Japanese firms is {{largely due to}} the commercial success of the HEMT, and quantum well lasers in satellite broadcasting and optical communications. The key issue all researcher face is: how to fashion these novel materials, quantum wells, wires and dots into working devices. In this article I will show how Japanese workers are very serious about quantum devices, warn that European and American manufacturers are in real danger of being left out by their failure to back fundamental research, and report on the research <b>activities</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>laboratories</b> I visited...|$|E

40|$|The {{end of the}} Cold War {{has called}} into {{question}} {{the activities of the}} national laboratories and, more generally, the level of support now given to federal intramural research in the United States. This paper seeks to analyze the potential role of the laboratories, with particular attention to the possibility, on the one hand, of integrating private technology development into the laboratory’s menu of activities and, on the other hand, of outsourcing traditional mission activities. We review the economic efficiency arguments for intramural research and the political conditions that are likely to constrain the <b>activities</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>laboratories,</b> and analyze the early history of programs intended to promote new technology via cooperative agreements between the laboratories and private industry. Our analysis suggests that the laboratories are likely to shrink considerably in size, and that the federal government faces a significant problem in deciding how to organize a downsizing of the federal research establishment...|$|E
40|$|M. Tech. (Operations Management) Accreditation {{allows people}} to make an {{informed}} decision when selecting a laboratory. It demonstrates competence, impartiality and capability. Most South African medical laboratories are accredited or aim to be accredited to the ISO 15189 standard. Medical research laboratories are using ISO 15189 with some resistance. Nonmedical research laboratories utilise ISO 17025, which has specifically been designed for testing and calibration laboratories. The {{purpose of this study}} was to assess whether ISO 15189 is suitable for the function performed by medical research laboratories. A literature review was used to determine the current quality process in medical laboratories. A qualitative research approach was followed with one-on-one semi-structured interviews with senior laboratory personnel (N= 20) and a focus group (N= 1) conducted with a group of senior laboratory personnel to assess the suitability of standards in medical laboratories in South Africa and address the future needs of these laboratories with regard to quality management and accreditation. The purposeful sample included interviews with personnel who were sourced from 20 diverse South African medical laboratories that perform diagnostic, surveillance and research testing. The questions were divided into three sections. The first section dealt with the interviewee’s demographics. The second section focused on the <b>activities</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>laboratories</b> regarding accreditation and quality management systems. The third section dealt with the opinions of managers regarding the benefits, strengths and weaknesses of being accredited to a standard, and the necessity for this.
