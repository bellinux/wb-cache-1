40|$|Communication is a {{fundamental}} human need to interact with each other. For children with special needs, particularly children with hearing impairment, communication becomes very important because they must to learn to communicate harder than a normal child. In SLB Karnna Manohara <b>articulation</b> <b>mirror</b> used as a device to train children with hearing impairment in communication, {{especially in terms of}} language expression. But the device is less effective because the size is large and not portable. The purpose of this program is implementation Electronic Portable <b>Articulation</b> <b>Mirror</b> (EPAM) which is a modification of a large mirror articulation into a portable, practical and more effective. Implementation of this program is done through several steps, they are observation, device improvements, feasibility test (calibration), evaluation and revision, application of device, and evaluation. The results of this program are EPAM design that consists of a mirror, an LCD display, a control menu, sound indicator light, power indicator light, power button, display baterray checker, 3. 5 mm audio port, audio port 7 mm, charger port, speakers, headsets, and microphone. Then for the implementation of EPAM in speech therapy business unit of SLB Karnna Manohara has succeeded in increasing the expression of language ability of deaf children to gain (g) 0. 72 and increased capacity with high criteria...|$|E

This type of research is the development of research. A research process: PortablePembuatanrangka <b>articulation</b> <b>Mirror</b> (PAM), making a series of amplifiers, makinga series balancer, merging, testing tools such as pre-test and post-test in children withhearing and ending with evaluation.

40|$|The temperature-ozone-nitric oxide {{experiment}} (TONE) on the thermosphere, ionosphere, mesosphere, energetics, {{and dynamics}} (TIMED) mission {{consists of two}} ultraviolet spectrometers and an infrared photometer. A medium resolution spectrometer (MRS) covers the spectral region from 210 to 247 nm with 0. 2 nm resolution, and a low resolution spectrometer/infrared photometer (LRS/IRP) covers the 235 to 320 nm region with 2. 0 nm resolution, and measures the 1. 27 micron emission from molecular oxygen excited by ozone photolysis. The Earth's limb is scanned by <b>articulation</b> <b>mirrors</b> which also serve as the field- of-view limiting elements. The TONE measures profiles of emission {{as a function of}} altitude on the Earth's limb. The primary measurements include profiles of Rayleigh scattered sunlight and 1. 27 micron emission in the mesosphere and lower thermosphere, and fluorescent emission from nitric oxide in the upper mesosphere and thermosphere. The inverted radiance measurements will yield profiles of temperature, density, and ozone in the mesosphere, and temperature and nitric oxide density in the thermosphere with 2. 5 km vertical resolution and 4. 5 degree spatial resolution along the orbital path. The primary TONE measurements extend from 50 to 180 km and are fundamental to the science objectives of the TIMED mission. The broad capabilities of the TONE contribute significantly to the TIMED mission with a low-cost, highly reliable instrument based on a long heritage of space instruments built at the University of Colorado's Laboratory for Atmospheric and Space Physics. The TONE has heritage from spectrometers on Mariner 9, Pioneer Venus, the Solar Mesosphere Explorer, Galileo, and Cassini...|$|R

An actuation system for mirrors in a space based segmented mirror array was developed as part of NASA's Precision Segmented Reflector program. The actuation system, called the Articulated Panel Module (APM), provides 3 degrees of freedom <b>mirror</b> <b>articulation,</b> gives isolation from structural motion, and simplifies space assembly of the mirrors to the reflector backup truss. A breadboard of the APM was built and is described...|$|R
40|$|The analysis, design, manufacture, test, and {{delivery}} of one secondary <b>mirror</b> <b>articulation</b> mechanism for the large space telescope (LST) are reported. The mechanism provides angular freedom about two axes that are perpendicular to the optical axis of the secondary mirror. Motion in each axis is controlled from two sources; one source provides alignment, the other source provides stabilization. Two articulation mechanism configurations were evaluated. In one configuration the stabilization system was assembled with piezoelectric actuators. In the second configuration the stabilization system utilized flexure torque motor actuators. The alignment system was the same for both configurations. System testing confirmed performance that met or exceeded all operational requirements. The two types of stabilization actuators had different performance characteristics. Both types demonstrated position resolution and frequency response better than specified limits...|$|R
40|$|We {{studied the}} {{modification}} of auditory perception {{in three different}} conditions in twenty subjects. Observing other person's discordant articulatory gestures deteriorated identification of acoustic speech stimuli and modified the auditory percept, causing a strong McGurk effect. A similar effect was found when the subjects watched their own silent <b>articulation</b> in a <b>mirror</b> and acoustic stimuli were simultaneously presented to their ears. Interestingly, a smaller but significant effect was even obtained when the subjects just silently articulated the syllables without visual feedback. On the other hand, observing other person's or one's own concordant articulation and silently articulating a concordant syllable improved identification of the acoustic stimuli. The modification of auditory percepts caused by visual observation of speech and silently articulating it are both suggested {{to be due to}} the alteration of activity in the auditory cortex. Our findings support the idea of a close relationship between speech perception and production...|$|R
40|$|Don DeLillo’s first novel, 'Americana' (1971), is {{assembled}} from a toolkit {{of psychological}} tropes. Critics have long recognized the novel’s debts to (and parodies of) Sigmund Freud, leading one critic to dub protagonist David Bell as “the American Oedipus. ” The present article reconsiders the novel {{from the perspective}} of Jacques Lacan’s psychoanalytic theories. Several of Lacan’s key concepts—including his seminal <b>articulation</b> of the <b>Mirror</b> Stage, his revisions to Freud’s Oedipus Complex, his emphasis on lack as the engine of desire, as well as his reflections on dreams, fantasies, and the gaze—help shed new light on DeLillo’s splintered portrait of postmodern subjectivity in 'Americana'. The article uses Lacan to explain how and why each of David Bell’s attempts at indulging his incestuous maternal desires ends in disappointment, with particular emphasis on his three failed attempts at restaging the primal scene. Lacanian psychology provides a conceptual framework and useful taxonomy for understanding the shifting desires, misrecognitions, obfuscations, deflections, projections, and self-reflections of the American Narcissus, David Bell...|$|R
