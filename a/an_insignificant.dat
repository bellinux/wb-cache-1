50|$|Mesopotamia {{was home}} to {{a great number of}} private {{libraries}} with many harboring an extensive collection of over 400 tablets. The nucleus of these private libraries were primarily texts which had been transcribed by the proprietors themselves from the time they acquired their education in the art of the scribe. <b>As</b> <b>insignificant</b> as these libraries may seem, they established the basis for the Library of Ashurbanipal collection.|$|R
5|$|Campbell's dwarf hamster {{is prone}} to genetic {{abnormalities}} in the metabolism of carbohydrates and lipids. They can develop tumours of the mammary glands, lungs, uterus, and ovaries. Tumours can also develop if the animal is exposed to chemical carcinogens. Due to having slow locomotion and <b>an</b> <b>insignificant</b> response to bright lights and humans, as well as having a low population density, field studies allow scientists to study entire populations in the wild.|$|E

The dromedary has four teats instead of the two in the Lama species.|$|E
5|$|In {{terms of}} goods {{produced}} indigenously, {{it was estimated}} that due to the inability of traditional suppliers to deliver manufactured goods because of trade embargoes and shipping shortages up to 400 new articles were produced in Australian factories {{as a result of the}} war. This was not <b>an</b> <b>insignificant</b> number, although the transformation of the Australian economy as a result of World War I was by no means as significant as that which occurred during World War II. The expansion of the steel industry that occurred during this time laid the foundation for future industrialisation.|$|E

5|$|Several {{articles}} published {{near the end}} of 2011 examined the effects of mephedrone, compared to the similar drugs MDMA and amphetamine in the nucleus accumbens of rats, as well as examining the reinforcing potential of mephedrone. Dopamine and serotonin were collected using microdialysis, and increases in dopamine and serotonin were measured using HPLC. Reward and drug seeking are linked to increases in dopamine concentrations in the nucleus accumbens, and drug half-life plays a role in drug seeking, as well. Based on histological examination, most of the author's probes were in the nucleus accumbens shell. Mephedrone administration caused about a 500% increase in dopamine, and about a 950% increase in serotonin. They reached their peak concentrations at 40 minutes and 20 minutes, respectively, and returned to baseline by 120 minutes after injection. In comparison, MDMA caused a roughly 900% increase in serotonin at 40 minutes, with <b>an</b> <b>insignificant</b> increase in dopamine. Amphetamine administration resulted in about a 400% increase in dopamine, peaking at 40 minutes, with <b>an</b> <b>insignificant</b> increase in serotonin. Analysis of the ratio of the AUC for dopamine (DA) and serotonin (5-HT) indicated mephedrone was preferentially a serotonin releaser, with a ratio of 1.22:1 (serotonin vs. dopamine). Additionally, half-lives for the decrease in DA and 5-HT were calculated for each drug. Mephedrone had decay rates of 24.5 minutes and 25.5 minutes, respectively. MDMA had decay values of 302.5 minutes and 47.9 minutes, respectively, while amphetamine values were 51 minutes and 84.1 minutes, respectively. Taken together, these findings show mephedrone induces a massive increase in both DA and 5-HT, combined with rapid clearance. The rapid rise and subsequent fall of DA levels could explain some of the addictive properties mephedrone displays in some users.|$|E
5|$|The {{arrival of}} the Muslim Arabs brought drastic changes to Gaza; its churches were {{transformed}} into mosques, including the Cathedral of John the Baptist (previously the Temple of Marnas) which became the Great Mosque of Gaza. Gaza's population adopted Islam as their religion relatively quick {{in contrast with the}} city's countryside. Eventually, Arabic became the official language. The Christian population was reduced to <b>an</b> <b>insignificant</b> minority and the Samaritan residents deposited their property with their high priest and fled the city east upon the Muslim conquest. Gaza was placed under the administration of Jund Filastin ("District of Palestine") of Bilad al-Sham province during Rashidun rule, and continued {{to be a part of}} the district under the successive caliphates of the Umayyads and Abbasids.|$|E

He wanted the exploited to sit up and think about their position, and use their reason to realise that they were being exploited by a handful of people. If they started thinking, they would realise that they were human beings like the rest, that birth did not and should not endow superiority over others and that they must awaken themselves and do everything possible to improve their own lot.|$|E

40|$|This {{research}} {{investigates the}} effect of good corporate governance, ownership structure and bank size on bank’s performance and firm value of banking industry in Indonesia. The sample are 16 banks with foreign capital concentration and go public at the Indonesia Stock Exchange {{in the period of}} 2007 - 2012. The data analyzed by PLS (Partial Least Square) with good corporate governance variable using indicator audit committee and independent commissioners, the ownership structure, the size of the bank using an indicator variable capital and outstanding loans, the variable with the banking performance indicators ROA, ROE, NIM, LDR, BOPO, NPL and the value of the company by using Tobin’s Q. The results of the research shows that: good corporate governance had a significant effect on bank’s performance, ownership structure there is no positive effect on bank’s performance, bank size had a significant effect on bank’s performance, good corporate governance had a significant effect on firm value, ownership structure had <b>a</b> <b>insignificant</b> effect on firm value, bank size had <b>a</b> <b>insignificant</b> effect on firm value, and bank’s performance had a significant effect on firm value. Key words: good corporate governance, ownership structure, bank size, bank’s performance, firm value...|$|R

5|$|Norwegian {{historians have}} held {{strongly}} differing views on Haakon's reign. In the 19th century, historian P. A. Munch portrayed Haakon as a mighty, almost flawless ruler, {{which in turn}} influenced Henrik Ibsen in his 1863 play The Pretenders. In the early 20th century, poet Hans E. Kinck countered and viewed Haakon as <b>an</b> <b>insignificant</b> king subordinated to forces outside of his control, a view which influenced historians such as Halvdan Koht and Edvard Bull, Sr.. Haakon has often been compared with Skule Bårdsson, and historians have taken sides in the old conflict. While Munch saw Skule as a traitor to the rightful Norwegian king, Koht viewed Skule as a heroic figure. On more sketchy grounds, Kinck praised Skule as representing the original and dying Norse culture, and Haakon as a superficial emulator of foreign culture. Since the 1960s, historians including Narve Bjørgo, Per Sveaas Andersen, Knut Helle, Svein Haga and Kåre Lunden have in turn professed a reaction against Koht's view. According to Sverre Bagge, modern historians tend to follow Koht {{when it comes to}} see Skule's rebellion as a last desperate attempt to stop Haakon from enroaching his power, but lean closer to Munch's overall evaluation of the two men.|$|E
