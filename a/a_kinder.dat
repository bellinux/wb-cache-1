5|$|A Christmas Carol in Prose, Being a Ghost-Story of Christmas, {{commonly}} known as A Christmas Carol, is a novella by Charles Dickens, first published in London by Chapman & Hall in 1843; the first edition was illustrated by John Leech. A Christmas Carol {{tells the story of}} Ebenezer Scrooge, an old miser who is visited by the ghost of his former business partner Jacob Marley and the Ghosts of Christmas Past, Present and Yet to Come. After their visits Scrooge is transformed into <b>a</b> <b>kinder,</b> gentler man.|$|E
25|$|This {{features}} French poetry, then {{very influential}} in Italy. What distinguishes the Sicilian School from the troubadours, however, {{is the introduction}} of <b>a</b> <b>kinder,</b> gentler type of woman than that found in their French models; one who was nearer to Dante's madonnas and Petrarch's Laura, though much less characterised psychologically. The poems of the Sicilians hardly portray real women or situations (Frederick's song cannot be read as autobiographical), but the style and language are remarkable, since the Sicilians (as Dante called them) created the first Italian literary standard by enriching the existing vernacular base, probably inspired by popular love songs, with new words of Latin and Provençal origin.|$|E
25|$|Sweyn Forkbeard {{tried to}} wrest {{control of the}} church in Denmark away from the Holy Roman Empire and as a result was slandered by German historians of his day. He has been accused of {{relapsing}} from his Christian beliefs and persecuting Christians in England. In fact Sweyn gave land to the large cathedral at Lund to pay for the maintenance of the chapter. His army destroyed Christian churches in England as part of his invasion following the St. Brice's Day massacre of Danes organized by Aethelred. But when Sweyn became King of England and of Denmark, politics required that he show <b>a</b> <b>kinder</b> face toward the church which had opposed him.|$|E

25|$|The SS {{entered the}} camp on two {{occasions}} to commit atrocities, before finally liquidating most of the Jewish laborers in July 1944, shortly before the German retreat out of Vilnius. In November 1943, a Jewish prisoner named David Zalkind, his wife, and child attempted {{to escape from the}} camp and were caught by the Gestapo. They were publicly executed in the camp courtyard {{in front of the other}} prisoners. On March 27, 1944, while Plagge was away on home leave in Germany, the SS carried out <b>a</b> <b>Kinder</b> Aktion ("Children Operation"). They entered the camp, rounded up the vast majority of the camp’s 250 children and then transported them away from the camp to be killed, most likely at the killing grounds of Paneriai. Thus both Plagge and his subordinates, as well as the prisoners, understood that ultimately the SS would decide the fate of the camp’s Jews.|$|E
25|$|Modern historians {{tend to take}} <b>a</b> <b>kinder</b> view of Churchill’s actions at Antwerp. He {{had asked}} for the brigades minus recruits, {{and it had been}} Kitchener who insisted on {{retaining}} territorials in the UK to defend the East Coast against possible German invasion. Only 57 men were actually killed. In “The World Crisis” Churchill claimed he had prolonged Belgian surrender by a few days and occupied five German divisions. In fact it had been a week and enabled Calais and Dunkirk to be secured. Rhodes James believes that Antwerp was “substantially to Churchill’s credit”. However, at the time he had thought that holding Antwerp would help the Allied advance north; the claim that it helped hold Calais and Dunkirk when the German advance resumed is hindsight. The more damaging attack, made inside and outside the Cabinet, was that Churchill was seeking publicity instead of running his department.|$|E
25|$|Empathy {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} aspects of humanistic therapy. This idea focuses on the therapist’s ability to see the world through the eyes of the client. Without this, therapists can be forced to apply an external frame of reference where the therapist is no longer understanding the actions and thoughts of the client as the client would, but strictly as a therapist which defeats the purpose of humanistic therapy. Included in empathizing, unconditional positive regard {{is one of the}} key elements of humanistic psychology. Unconditional positive regard refers to the care that the therapist needs to have for the client. This ensures that the therapist does not become the authority figure in the relationship allowing for a more open flow of information as well as <b>a</b> <b>kinder</b> relationship between the two. A therapist practicing humanistic therapy needs to show a willingness to listen and ensure the comfort of the patient where genuine feelings may be shared but are not forced upon someone. Marshall Rosenberg, one of Carl Rogers' students, emphasizes empathy in the relationship in his concept of Nonviolent Communication.|$|E

25|$|Thorfinn, {{having no}} other choice, follows Eskil and Vrage to meet Vagn. Surprisingly, when Vagn sees Thors’s son Thorfinn, he started crying publicly. Thorfinn finally learns {{that the person}} who ordered for Thors’s death was Floki, as Thors was the mostly likely {{candidate}} to be the third chieftain. Rage crossed Thorfinn’s mind but leaves to sort himself out. Alone, he questions if he can still change for the better and become <b>a</b> <b>kinder</b> person. Thorfinn also meets one of his old crewmates, Atli who is arrested for thievery. Atli says he has a family back home and “will find an honest line of work”. Vagn warns Thorfinn that people like Atli will return to stealing and killing people instead of field labor, so killing him is better than releasing him. Hild leaves after questioning Vagn on the same thing since he is also enjoying an extravagant meal when there are no animals or fields around. Thorfinn wishes to not go to Jomsborg nor fight anyone, not even to meet Floki again. Thorfinn states that King Canute will oversee the affairs of Thors’s murder while Thorfinn will complete his own mission without needless bloodshed. Later, Vagn is puzzled when Thorfinn and Hild are trying to stop Vagn’s men from sexually assaulting the slave girls.|$|E
