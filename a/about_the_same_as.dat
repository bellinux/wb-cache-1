It comprises a smaller fraction in the crust. It is industrially produced by cryogenic fractional distillation of liquefied air.|$|E
5|$|Species of Blattodea (cockroaches) have a forewing, {{are also}} known as tegmen, that {{is more or less}} sclerotized. It is used in flight as well as a form of {{protection}} of the membranous hindwings. The veins of hindwing are <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>as</b> front wing but with large anal lobe folded at rest between CuP and 1A. The anal lobe usually folded in a fan-like manner.|$|E
5|$|There {{have been}} at least 11 {{documented}} cases of blue whale-fin whale hybrid adults in the wild. Arnason and Gullberg describe the genetic distance between a blue and a fin as <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>as</b> that between a human and a gorilla. Researchers working off Fiji believe they photographed a hybrid humpback-blue whale including the discovery through DNA analysis from a meat sample found in a Japanese market.|$|E

5|$|Vanadinite is very brittle, {{producing}} small, conchoidal fragments when fractured. Its hardness is 3–4 on the Mohs scale, <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>as</b> {{a copper}} coin. Vanadinite is particularly heavy for a translucent mineral. It has a molar mass of 1416.27g/mole and its specific gravity can range between 6.6 and 7.2 because of impurities.|$|E
5|$|Vesta orbits the Sun between Mars and Jupiter, {{within the}} {{asteroid}} belt, with {{a period of}} 3.6 Earth years, specifically in the inner asteroid belt, interior to the Kirkwood gap at 2.50AU.

5|$|Acupuncture is {{no better}} than placebo, usual care, or sham {{acupuncture}} for nonspecific acute pain or sub-chronic pain. For those with chronic pain, it improves pain {{a little more than}} no treatment and <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>as</b> medications, but it does not help with disability. This pain benefit is only present right after treatment and not at follow-up. Acupuncture may be a reasonable method to try for those with chronic pain that does not respond to other treatments like conservative care and medications.|$|E

5|$|One {{reviewer}} {{criticized the}} decision to underclock the ATI Mobility Radeon X1600 graphics card by about 30percent its original speed. The notebook was also noted for running hot. Users complained that upgrading system memory was harder than in older Apple notebooks. Since the dimensions for the 15-inch MacBook Pro were tweaked slightly from the 15-inch PowerBook G4, older accessories such as notebook sleeves did not work with the new models. Some users noted a slight flickering when the screen was on lower brightness settings. Apple increased the battery capacity by 10 Wh, going from 50 in the PowerBook G4 to 60, but the more powerful Core Duo CPU required more power. Battery life therefore remained <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>as</b> in previous models, at three-plus hours.|$|E
5|$|Slightly {{more than}} 5 million people work in Switzerland; about 25% of {{employees}} {{belonged to a}} trade union in 2004. Switzerland has a more flexible job market than neighbouring countries and {{the unemployment rate is}} very low. The unemployment rate increased from a low of 1.7% in June 2000 to a peak of 4.4% in December 2009. The unemployment rate decreased to 3.2% in 2014 without further decrease in 2015 and 2016. Population growth from net immigration is quite high, at 0.52% of population in 2004. The foreign citizen population was 21.8% in 2004, <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>as</b> in Australia. GDP per hour worked is the world's 16th highest, at 49.46 international dollars in 2012.|$|E
5|$|The Nigerian {{health care}} system is {{continuously}} faced with a shortage of doctors known as 'brain drain', because of emigration by skilled Nigerian doctors to North America and Europe. In 1995, it was estimated that 21,000 Nigerian doctors were practising in the United States alone, which is <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>as</b> the number of doctors working in the Nigerian public service. Retaining these expensively trained professionals has been identified as {{one of the goals of}} the government.|$|E

Tickets were also made available via Amadeus, a ticket reservation system in Norway previously only used for airlines. Prices became differentiated, with prices between Oslo and Kristiansand varying between NOK250 and 780, depending on time of travel and class. NSB stated that they hoped to compete with airlines between the two cities, as travel time from city center to center was <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>as</b> by plane.|$|E
5|$|Two {{locations}} on the Moon were given primary consideration for exploration by the Apollo 16 expedition: the Descartes Highlands region west of Mare Nectaris and the crater Alphonsus. At Descartes, the Cayley and Descartes formations {{were the primary}} areas of interest in that scientists suspected, based on telescopic and orbital imagery, that the terrain found there was formed by magma more viscous than that which formed the lunar maria. The Cayley Formation's age was approximated to be <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>as</b> Mare Imbrium based on the local frequency of impact craters. The considerable distance between the Descartes site and previous Apollo landing sites would be beneficial for the network of geophysical instruments, portions of which were deployed on each Apollo expedition beginning with Apollo 12.|$|E
