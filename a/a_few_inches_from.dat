5|$|In the balkline games, {{rather than}} drawing balklines <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>inches</b> <b>from</b> the corners, the entire table {{is divided into}} {{rectangular}} balk spaces, by drawing balklines a certain distance lengthwise and widthwise across {{the length of the}} table a set number of inches parallel out from each rail. This divides the table into eight rectangular balkspaces. Additionally, rectangles are drawn where each balkline meets a rail, called anchor spaces, which developed to stop a number of nursing techniques that exploited the fact that if the object balls straddled a balkline, no count limit was in place.|$|E
5|$|Nevill {{was found}} in the kitchen, dressed in pyjamas, lying over an {{overturned}} chair next to the fireplace, amid a scene suggestive of a struggle. He had been shot eight times, six times to the head and face, fired when the rifle was <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>inches</b> <b>from</b> his skin. The remaining shots to his body had occurred from at least two feet away. Based on where the empty cartridges were found—three in the kitchen and one on the stairs—the police concluded that he had been shot four times upstairs, but had managed to get downstairs where a struggle took place, and during which he was hit several times with the rifle and shot again, this time fatally.|$|E
5|$|Shay {{was found}} dead in a Kansas City hotel room on December 1, 1927. He was found with a gunshot wound to the head. Police {{officials}} initially said that the manner of death could have been either suicide or murder. Shay stayed in his room on the day that he died. A porter went to check on him that evening and found him on the floor with a pistol <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>inches</b> <b>from</b> his right hand. When physicians examined Shay's body, they found that a bullet had entered the right ear and exited the back of the head. Shay had lost the use of his right arm and hand after a stroke. Police said that if Shay were holding the gun in his left hand, {{it would not have been}} easy for him to shoot himself in the right side of the head.|$|E

60|$|The {{blade of}} the hoe was long, {{and it seemed}} very heavy. The girl was digging up the ground by {{standing}} upon the part which she had already dug and striking the hoe down into the hard ground <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>inches</b> back <b>from</b> where she had struck before.|$|R
50|$|Satya {{returns to}} Vidya's house {{to meet her}} but she refuses to open the door. He manages to break it open but Khandilkar, who had arrived to arrest him, shoots him down, having already shot and killed Kallu Mama. Satya collapses <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>inches</b> away <b>from</b> Vidya's feet and {{breathes}} his last.|$|R
5|$|Formerly, men {{not wearing}} {{military}} uniform wore knee breeches of an 18th-century design. Women's evening dress included trains and tiaras or feathers {{in their hair}} (or both). The dress code governing formal court uniform and dress has progressively relaxed. After World WarI, when Queen Mary wished to follow fashion by raising her skirts <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>inches</b> <b>from</b> the ground, she requested a lady-in-waiting to shorten her own skirt first to gauge the king's reaction. King GeorgeV was horrified, so the queen kept her hemline unfashionably low. Following their accession in 1936, King GeorgeVI and his consort, Queen Elizabeth, allowed the hemline of daytime skirts to rise. Today, there is no official dress code. Most men invited to Buckingham Palace in the daytime choose to wear service uniform or lounge suits; a minority wear morning coats, and in the evening, depending on the formality of the occasion, black tie or white tie.|$|E
5|$|As {{the tornado}} crossed South Richard Road, it {{intensified}} {{into a very}} high-end EF4 and inflicted catastrophic damage to several large homes as it impacted the Deer Creek subdivision. Well-built homes along South Richard Road and East Kuehl Court were leveled and swept from their foundations with debris strewn downwind. Several vehicles parked at these residences were moved some distance or tossed, and wind rowing of debris occurred. One house had its concrete walkway pulled <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>inches</b> <b>from</b> its original location, and notable scouring of lawn grass was observed in the subdivision. These structures were estimated to have been impacted by winds near 200mph (320km/h), the upper bound of an EF4 tornado. The homes swept away in this area were bolted to their foundations {{and there is some}} speculation that the tornado may have reached EF5 intensity at this point, though close inspection revealed that some of the washers were missing from the anchor bolts, and that low-lying shrubbery near the homes was left mostly intact, preventing a higher rating. Continuing northeast, the tornado temporarily weakened as it destroyed a few large barns or outbuildings, ripped the roof off two brick residences, and collapsed most walls of another house, but once again gained strength as it approached Illinois Route 64. A large restaurant and a residence had their exterior walls collapsed.|$|E
25|$|As the Union {{troops were}} withdrawing, Wood stopped his brigade {{commanded}} by Col. Charles G. Harker {{and sent it}} back with orders to counterattack the Confederates. They {{appeared on the scene}} at the flank of the Confederates who had captured the artillery pieces, causing them to retreat. The brigades of McNair, Perry, and Robinson became intermingled as they ran for shelter in the woods east of the field. Hood ordered Kershaw's Brigade to attack Harker and then raced toward Robertson's Brigade of Texans, Hood's old brigade. As he reached his former unit, a bullet struck him in his right thigh, knocking him from his horse. He was taken to a hospital near Alexander's Bridge, where his leg was amputated <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>inches</b> <b>from</b> the hip.|$|E
50|$|There were shiny, {{concentric}} circles on their car's trunk {{that had not}} been there the previous day. Betty and Barney experimented with a compass, noting that when they moved it close to the spots, the needle would whirl rapidly. But when they moved it <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>inches</b> away <b>from</b> the shiny spots, it would drop down.|$|R
5000|$|Each Abakan is {{made out}} of woven {{material}} using Abakanowicz's own technique. The material used for many of these pieces was found, often collecting sisal ropes from harbors, untwining them into threads and dying them. [...] Hung from the ceiling, Abakans reach sizes as large as thirteen feet with sometimes only <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>inch</b> clearance <b>from</b> the ground.|$|R
60|$|But {{the most}} tedious {{part of the}} {{operation}} did not lie in the boring of these holes. In order {{that they should be}} of the required shape, two holes had to be bored <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>inches</b> apart <b>from</b> each other, and the rock cut away from between them. It was this latter part of the work that took up most time.|$|R
25|$|The link-and-pin coupler {{consisted}} of a tube-like body that received an oblong link. During coupling, a rail worker had to stand between the cars as they came together and guide the link into the coupler pocket. Once the cars were joined, the employee inserted a pin into a hole <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>inches</b> <b>from</b> {{the end of the}} tube to hold the link in place. This procedure was exceptionally dangerous and many brakemen lost fingers or entire hands when they did not {{get them out of the}} way of the coupler pockets in time. Many more were killed as a result of being crushed between cars or dragged under cars that were coupled too quickly. Brakemen were issued with heavy clubs that could be used to hold the link in position, but many brakemen would not use the club, and risked injury.|$|E
25|$|The {{historical}} {{centre of}} Gubbio has a decidedly medieval aspect: {{the town is}} austere in appearance because of the dark grey stone, narrow streets, and Gothic architecture. Many houses in central Gubbio date to the 14th and 15th centuries, and were originally the dwellings of wealthy merchants. They often have a second door fronting on the street, usually just <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>inches</b> <b>from</b> the main entrance. This secondary entrance is narrower, and {{a foot or so}} above the actual street level. This type of door is called a porta dei morti (door of the dead) because it was proposed that they were used to remove the bodies of any who might have died inside the house. This is almost certainly false, but there is no agreement as to the purpose of the secondary doors. A more likely theory is that the door was used by the owners to protect themselves when opening to unknown persons, leaving them in a dominating position.|$|E
2500|$|Just {{after the}} {{extraction}} (or finish) with the oar {{out of the}} water and the face of the blade parallel to the water (the blades are [...] "feathered"). The rower has legs straight, body leaning back, and arms pulled in so that the oar handle is <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>inches</b> <b>from</b> the solar plexus. This is the beginning of what is called the recovery or the slide.|$|E
50|$|The {{primary safety}} feature on a wood shaper is a guard mounted above the cutter {{protecting}} hands and garments from being drawn into its blades. Jigs, fixtures such as hold-downs, and accessories that include featherboards, also help prevent injury and generally result in better cuts. The starter, or fulcrum, pin is a metal rod which threads into the table <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>inches</b> away <b>from</b> the cutter allowing stock {{to be fed}} into it in a freehand cut.|$|R
5000|$|In the 2017 Divisional {{playoff game}} against the Green Bay Packers, Irving claims that in the final snap of the game the {{officials}} missed a holding call committed by Packers guard T.J. Lang against him. During that play, Aaron Rodgers made a completion to Jared Cook with Cook's maintaining his feet <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>inches</b> inbounds <b>from</b> the sidelines. That completion set up a 51-yard Mason Crosby field goal {{to win the game}} with only three seconds on the clock.|$|R
50|$|Stevenson married MGM actor-dancer, Russ Tamblyn, on Valentine's Day, 1956, {{shortly after}} her half-brother, actor Jeffrey Byron, was born to her mother. She was 17 when she and Tamblyn had their wedding in the Wayfarers Chapel in Palos Verdes. Stevenson and Tamblyn {{divorced}} in April 1957, but the two remained friends. A widely reproduced photo shows Stevenson calmly walking down a Los Angeles street, seemingly unaware that Tamblyn is doing a spectacular backward aerial handspring <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>inches</b> away <b>from</b> her.|$|R
2500|$|Kenji is Hisao's {{neighbor}} in the dorms, who is legally blind, {{being unable to}} see anything more than <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>inches</b> <b>from</b> his face. He {{appears to be a}} hikikomori and very anti-social, claiming to be the [...] "last sane man in an insane world." [...] He often rants about feminist conspiracy theories, claiming that feminists are evil and want to rule the world (these feelings are revealed to stem from his feeling tired after having intercourse with his ex-girlfriend a year before the story starts), among other pointless subjects, possibly rivaling Rin's [...] "uniqueness" [...] in that aspect. Kenji's route is the bad ending of Act 1 if the player does not choose one girl to befriend over the course of Act 1.|$|E
2500|$|On 3 March 2006 many trains were {{disrupted}} {{just before}} the Friday afternoon rush hour when drunken 48-year-old company director Kevin Craswell, from nearby Ashtead, lay down and rested his head on a rail, <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>inches</b> <b>from</b> the electrified (750 V) third rail. [...] Had he touched this while {{in contact with the}} ground, he would have been fatally electrocuted. [...] Power had to be cut for approximately 15 minutes over a [...] stretch of track while Craswell was woken and taken to hospital. [...] Network Rail stated that the cost of the disruption exceeded £7,000. [...] Craswell, who was filmed by a police helicopter - the noise of which failed to wake him - pleaded guilty to a charge of obstructing the railway by neglect, and was subsequently fined £560 and ordered to carry out 180 hours of community service.|$|E
2500|$|Skipjack’s sixth, seventh, {{and eighth}} war patrols were unproductive. But, during her ninth, {{conducted}} in the Caroline Islands and Mariana Islands areas, she sank two enemy vessels. On 26 January 1944, she commenced a night attack on a merchant ship, but, prior to firing, she shifted targets when an enemy destroyer began a run on the submarine. She quickly fired her forward torpedoes and was rewarded with solid hits that quickly sank Suzukaze (...) [...] The submarine then fired her stern tubes at the merchant ship. One of the submarine's torpedo tube valves stuck open and her after torpedo room began to flood. The torpedomen were unable to close the emergency valves until she had taken on approximately 14tons of water. A large upward angle developed almost immediately, forcing the submarine to surface. By the time control of the boat had been regained, {{the water in the}} torpedo room was only <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>inches</b> <b>from</b> the top of the water tight door, but fortunately there were no casualties, and Skipjack resumed the attack. The submarine then torpedoed and sank the converted seaplane tender Okitsu Maru (...) [...] She returned to Pearl Harbor on 7 March.|$|E
6000|$|Mr. Bethany {{pushed the}} book <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>inches</b> away <b>from</b> him. 'Who, did you say--who {{was it you}} said put the thing into your head? A queer friend surely?' he paused helplessly. 'And how, pray, do you know,' he began again more firmly, 'even {{if there is a}} Sabathier buried at Widderstone, {{how do you know it}} is this Sabathier? It's not, I think,' he added boldly, 'a very {{uncommon}} name; with two b's at any rate. Whereabouts is the grave?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Don't touch me!" [...] he said, with an {{utterance}} {{like the}} cut of a lash, darting from her, and changing from pink to white and back again, {{as if his}} whole frame were tingling with {{the pain of the}} sting. He wheeled round {{to the other side of}} the room and stood opposite to her, with the tips of his fingers in his pockets and his head thrown back, looking fiercely not at Rosamond but at <b>a</b> point <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>inches</b> away <b>from</b> her.|$|R
5000|$|Luard {{admitted}} that he owned three revolvers. However, he claimed to be unable to remember where he kept his ammunition. London gun expert Edwin Churchill stated that, after examining the two bullets, he had concluded that they {{had come from a}} [...]320 revolver, which had been fired when the gun was no more than <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>inches</b> away <b>from</b> Mrs Luard's head. He also said that none of Luard's own revolvers would have been capable of firing such bullets, since his guns were all of much smaller calibre.|$|R

60|$|He handed his {{cigar-case}} to the brigadier. Then he {{took one}} himself, lighted it at the smouldering end of {{the one he had}} taken from his mouth, was about to throw the stump carelessly down, but, suddenly recollecting himself, leaned over his horse, and dropped it carefully <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>inches</b> away <b>from</b> the face of a dead soldier. Then, straightening himself in the saddle, he shoved his horse against the brigadier, moving him a little further on, while a slight movement of his hand kept the staff from following.|$|R
50|$|The stove {{was about}} 30 inches (76 cm) tall, {{with a box}} shape. The front was open, except for a {{decorative}} panel in {{the upper part of}} the box. The back of the box was to be placed <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>inches</b> away <b>from</b> the flue (chimney). On the bottom panel there were several holes to allow the smoke to escape; these were connected to the chimney. The panels were bolted together with iron screws through pre-cast ears. Inside there was a small, thin rectangular prism that would force the smoke into the holes. The plates were all made from iron.|$|R
50|$|Damper {{stones are}} stones that limit {{the use of}} spirit stones near them. Like spirit stones, the more there are, the greater their effect. In large numbers, they can cancel out any use of spirit stones in a whole room. Usually, however, they are used alone, set into a metal collar but, in one instance, the damper stone is seen {{implanted}} into a slave miner's body {{at the nape of}} the neck; <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>inches</b> up <b>from</b> where their spirit stones would start. This lone stone, when touching the skin, is enough to dampen the spirit stone use of the person it touches and possibly anyone who comes too close.|$|R
60|$|He stooped {{down and}} tried {{one of the}} keys from his bunch. Virginia did not hesitate. She pulled the trigger of her revolver, and a bullet whistled only <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>inches</b> <b>from</b> his head. He sprang upright in a minute.|$|E
6000|$|... "Madam!" [...] ejaculated Captain Bird, {{the hand}} {{which had been}} holding his pipe <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>inches</b> <b>from</b> his mouth now {{dropping}} to his knee; and at this motion the hands which held the pipes of the three other mariners dropped to their knees.|$|E
60|$|The store had two {{side windows}} to it, which were opened <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>inches</b> <b>from</b> the bottom for ventilation, and the cadets stole {{up to these}} windows {{to listen to the}} talk. Everybody ordered cream and began to eat, and then asked for the bouquets.|$|E
5000|$|The Weather {{received}} {{critical acclaim}} from music critics, holding an average critic score of 81, based on 11 critics, indicating [...] "universal acclaim". Saby Reyes-Kulkarni of Pitchfork wrote that [...] "For all its disjointedness, the album never wanders more than <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>inches</b> away <b>from</b> the sublime. It’s a document {{of a band}} knocking loudly {{on the door of}} greatness." [...] Marcy Donelson for Allmusic described the album as [...] "trippy and shambolic". Donelson also praised its [...] "epic, sometimes otherworldly luster". Gwilym Mumford in the Guardian wrote that the album is [...] "Accessible but still absolutely out there, this is prog, but not as we know it." ...|$|R
60|$|And then, with {{a parting}} {{glance at the}} ancient skeleton, {{he turned to the}} task of {{ascending}} the western wall of the canyon. Slowly and with many rests he dragged his weakening body upwards. Again and again he slipped back from sheer exhaustion and would have fallen {{to the floor of the}} canyon but for merest chance. How long it took him to scale that frightful wall he could not have told, and when at last he dragged himself over the top it was to lie weak and gasping, too spent to rise or even to move <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>inches</b> farther <b>from</b> the perilous edge of the chasm.|$|R
5000|$|Parmigianino has {{distorted}} {{nature for}} his own artistic purposes, creating a typical Mannerist figura serpentinata. Jesus is also extremely large for a baby, and he lies precariously on Mary's lap as if about to fall at any moment. The Madonna herself is of hardly human proportions—she is almost {{twice the size of}} the angels to her right. Her right foot rests on cushions that appear to be only <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>inches</b> away <b>from</b> the picture plane, but the foot itself seems to project beyond it, and is thus on [...] "our" [...] side of the canvas, breaking the conventions of a framed picture. Her slender hands and long fingers have also led the Italian medical scientist Vito Franco of the University of Palermo to diagnose that Parmigianino's model had the genetic disorder Marfan syndrome affecting her connective tissue.|$|R
