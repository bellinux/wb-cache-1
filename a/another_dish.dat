25|$|Taro {{is called}} gabi in the Philippines and is widely {{available}} throughout the archipelago.

A popular recipe for taro is laing; the dish's main ingredients are taro leaves (at times including stems) cooked in coconut milk, and salted with fermented shrimp or fish bagoong. It is sometimes heavily spiced with red hot chilies called siling labuyo. <b>Another</b> <b>dish</b> in which taro is commonly used is the Philippine national stew, sinigang, although radish can be used if taro is not available. This stew is made with pork and beef, shrimp, or fish, a souring agent (tamarind fruit, kamias, etc.) with the addition of peeled and diced corms as thickener. The corm is also prepared as a basic ingredient for ginataan, a coconut milk and taro dessert.|$|E

500|$|In September 1996, Ben Rogers ate at the {{restaurant}} for The Independent before it had gained any Michelin stars or the awards it has today and {{while it was still}} using something close to its original menu. Even so, he discovered that Blumenthal was cooking foie gras in sherry in order to give it a nutty flavour, although Rogers wasn't sure if the nutty flavour was warranted in the dish itself. He did think that a jambonneau of duck was worth praising, describing it as [...] "delicious", but also thought that <b>another</b> <b>dish</b> of monkfish was rubbery in texture. He described the menu itself as [...] "awkwardly written, badly punctuated, and at points quite impenetrable". Following the first Michelin star, David Fingleton visited {{the restaurant}} for The Spectator, and said that the experience was [...] "beyond reproach; unsullied pleasure from start to finish".|$|E

2500|$|In Bengal (West Bengal and Bangladesh), {{white poppy}} seeds are called posto [...] পোস্তো). They are very popular and are used as the main {{ingredient}} {{in a variety of}} dishes. One of the most popular dishes is aloo posto (potato and poppy seeds) which consists of a large amount of ground poppy seeds cooked together with potatoes and made into a smooth, rich product, which is sometimes eaten with rice. There are many variants to this basic dish, replacing or complementing the potatoes with such ingredients as onions (pnyaj posto), Ridged Luffa (jhinge posto), chicken (murgi posto), and possibly the most popular prawns (chingri posto). The cooked poppy seeds are sometimes served without any accompanying ingredients at all. The consistency of the dish may vary depending on local or household traditions. There are many other posto dishes. Chadachadi is a dish from Bengali cuisine and includes long strips of vegetables, sometimes with the stalks of leafy greens added, all lightly seasoned with spices like mustard or poppy seeds and flavored with a phoron. One dish involves grilling patties made from posto, sometimes frying them (posto-r bora). <b>Another</b> <b>dish</b> involves simply mixing uncooked ground poppy seeds (kancha posto) with mustard oil, chopped green chili peppers, fresh onions and rice.|$|E

60|$|Last evening, Mr. Powers {{called to}} see us, {{and sat down}} to talk in a {{friendly}} and familiar way. I do not know a man of more facile intercourse, nor with whom one so easily gets rid of ceremony. His conversation, too, is interesting. He talked, to begin with, about Italian food, as poultry, mutton, beef, and their lack of savoriness as compared with our own; and mentioned an exquisite dish of vegetables which they prepare from squash or pumpkin blossoms; likewise <b>another</b> <b>dish,</b> which it will be well for us to remember when we get back to the Wayside, where we are overrun with acacias. It consists of the acacia-blossoms in a certain stage of their development fried in olive-oil. I shall get the receipt from Mrs. Powers, and mean to deserve well of my country by first trying it, and then making it known; only I doubt whether American lard, or even butter, will produce the dish quite so delicately as fresh Florence oil.|$|E

60|$|My mother, sitting down, {{began to}} cry. It {{had been a}} trying week for my mother. A party to dinner--to a real dinner, {{beginning}} with anchovies and ending with ices from the confectioner's; if only they would remain ices and not, giving way to unaccustomed influences, present themselves as cold custard--was an extraordinary departure from the even tenor of our narrow domestic way; indeed, I recollect none previous. First {{there had been the}} house to clean and rearrange almost from top to bottom; endless small purchases to be made of articles that Need never misses, but which Ostentation, if ever you let her sneering nose inside the door, at once demands. Then the kitchen range--it goes without saying: one might imagine them all members of a stove union, controlled by some agitating old boiler out of work--had taken the opportunity to strike, refusing to bake <b>another</b> <b>dish</b> except under permanently improved conditions, necessitating weary days with plumbers. Fat cookery books, long neglected on their shelf, had been consulted, argued with and abused; experiments made, failures sighed over, successes noted; cost calculated anxiously; means and ways adjusted, hope finally achieved, shadowed by fear.|$|E
