40|$|This {{paper is}} a study on how {{directivity}} characteristics of <b>artificial</b> <b>mouths</b> correspond to the directivity of a real speaker. The motivation for the research is the measurement methods that are applied in the telecommunication industry for the microphones of phones and their accessories. Responses of a <b>mouth</b> of an <b>artificial</b> torso simulator, B&K HATS 4128 were measured to several positions [1]. The same measurements were repeated {{for a group of}} test subjects. The measurement positions corresponded to the same positions were the microphones of phones and their accessories, so called headsets, would lay. The basic mechanisms that produce the directivity pattern are discussed and also the contribution of the speech content is shown. The main contributor to the directivity is the mouth aperture size. The acoustical characteristics of the upper body are also a significant factor if the position is not {{directly in front of the}} mouth. More than 10 dB differences were found between HATS and an averaged test subject. The key finding is that HATS is too directional at high frequencies. To enhance the correspondence of the telephonometry to real speakers, a simple equalization scheme and two structural improvement proposals to HATS are introduced. 1...|$|R

40|$|The late Pleistocene and Holocene {{environmental}} {{evolution and}} sequence stratigraphic {{architecture of the}} Po Delta region, Northern Italy, are examined. The study units record the depositional evolution from lowstand continental accumulation to marine transgression and highstand progradation. Interpretation of the high-resolution, three-dimension geological mapping of the central Po Delta area was framed within {{the evolution of the}} whole of the delta region, stretching from Venice Lagoon to the South of Ravenna. The development of the delta lobes was correlated with the fluvial drainage history. A discussion on the different auto and allocyclic mechanisms controlling the depositional evolution and a quantitative estimation of the changing depositional rates are also provided. Outcrop study was based on field surveying and on the analysis of aerial photography, topographic micro-relief, historical cartography, archaeological and historiographic data. Subsurface analysis was based on stratigraphic coring and cone penetration testing. During the last glacial lowstand, the modern coastal region was the site of middle alluvial plain sedimentation. Deglaciation and early transgression were associated with an erosive disconformity development. In the modern coastal area, transgressive accumulation started between 10 and 9 000 yr BP. Back-stepping fluvial and brackish marsh deposits were followed by delta-estuarine sand bodies, influence by the last important eustatic rise pulses. Transgression climaxed at about 5 500 yr BP, during a warm climate phase. Early highstand saw the growth of large sand spits and barrier islands, progressively turning the previous bays into confined lagoons. At about 3 500 – 3 000 yr BP, a particularly active meteo-marine regime profoundly affected the depositional dynamics. Etruscan and Roman times were characterised by a warm climate and by riverine stability associated with the development of a large delta lobe. At around 1 500 yr BP, transition toward moister and cooler conditions and the abandoning of the Roman Empire hydraulic works coincided with important drainage network instability. The modern delta lobe was induced 400 years ago by an <b>artificial</b> fluvial <b>mouth</b> cut commissioned by the Republic of Venice.

40|$|The main aim of {{the project}} is to {{investigate}} the feasibility of artificial recharge of the Bushmans River Mouth Aquifer in the Eastern Cape. The suggested method of recharge is through natural infiltration {{through a series of}} wetlands in the back dune area. The proposed site was the Klipfontein Vlei which is located just north of the Bushmans River <b>Mouth.</b> <b>Artificial</b> recharge is defined as augmenting the natural movement of surface water into underground formations by some method of construction, the spreading of water, or by artificially changing natural conditions. A variety of methods have been developed, including water spreading, recharging through pits and wells, and pumping to induce recharge from surface water bodies. The choice of a specific method is controlled by local topography, geology and soil conditions, and the quantity of water to be recharged and ultimate water usage. In special circumstances, land value, water quality, and climate play an important role. Artificial recharge is not a foreign concept to South Africa and this project is to test its feasibility in a back dune wetland area. Augering done in the study area revealed the dominance of sandy loam in the upper layers of the pans, loamy sand in the middle levels and the presence of some sand lenses in the lower reaches. Particle size analysis done by sieving and hydrometer test, showed a dominant 3 f fraction. There was variation in modes in pan 1 from unimodal to bimodal to trimodal. Pan 2 showed no variation as all samples were unimodal and moderately well sorted. Infiltration tests were done by a double ring infiltrometer. These results showed that the infiltration rates of the pans became stable after 15 to 20 minutes, thus indicating that the soil had reached its saturation point. The resistivity surveys revealed a stepped water table. The inclination of the water is controlled by the predominately argillaceous horizons of the Bokkeveld Group. Based on the above results, it is recommended that the Klipfontein Vlei be used as an artificial recharge sit...|$|R
40|$|The Colombian {{government}} aims {{to establish}} a connection that bridges the Atlantic Ocean and the Pacific Ocean. The new connection will largely {{take place on the}} current Atrato River, which has not yet been upgraded for a more extensive use of navigation in the near future. A bottleneck in the river is the delta area. Without structural dredging activities the river is completely inaccessible. This study investigates the morphodynamics of a river mouth of the Atrato delta, in order to improve its accessibility to provide navigation in the future and to minimize the dredging activities. In short, the main objectives of this study are (1) to gain insights into the morphodynamics of the delta, (2) to develop a hydrodynamic model on an unstructured grid, (3) to develop a morphodynamic model on a structured grid and consequently (4) apply these models to investigate measures that aim to improve the accessibility of a river mouth. In this study an approach is used to model the hydrodynamics first at a large scale and subsequently modelling the morphodynamics at a more detailed level. A hydrodynamic model is set up with an unstructured grid, which appears to be a powerful tool to model a topographical complex area such as the Atrato delta. The hydrodynamic model gives insights into the hydrodynamics of the delta and is capable to create specific time-dependent boundary conditions for the more detailed morphodynamic model. This approach solves the problem of enormous backwater adaptation lengths, which are initiated by the tidal movement and a large amount of bifurcations. Subsequently, a model with a structured grid has been set up to simulate the morphology around a river mouth. The morphodynamic model is able to identify the major processes that cause sediment deposition. The key process appears to be the sudden spreading and deceleration of the riverine water when the river flows into the Golfo de Urabá. As the result of the relative strength of the outflowing fresh water compared to the tidal power, the flow velocities are almost constantly located seawards. This explains the low sediment deposition rates in the river part of the delta. The enhanced flocculationin saline water results in a compact zone of sedimentation. This report discusses four possible measures that aim to improve the navigability in the delta and to minimize dredging activities. Modelsare set up to simulate their effects on the delta hydrodynamically as well as morphodynamically. The modelled measures are (1) a sand trap, (2) an artificial outlet channel, (3) sediment diversion channels and (4) the artificial extension of a river mouth. The model forecasts that none of the investigated measures will avoid dredging activities completely. A navigable <b>artificial</b> river <b>mouth</b> situated more upstream in the river even leads to closuresof the current river mouths. Of the examined measures, the implementations of a sand trap and sediment diversion channels raise the most potential to reduce the sediment supply to the current river mouths, without deteriorating the navigability {{in other parts of the}} river. The artificial extension of a river mouth with breakwaters does not decrease the sediment supply towards the river mouths. However, the sediment deposition process takes place in deeper water, which minimizes the dredging maintenance for at least several years. The findings of this study should be regarded as the first step in the extension of knowledge on the morphodynamics of the Atrato delta. At this stage the models will help to understand the morphodynamics at the delta in more detail and hopefully encourage the collection of more valuable data. For that purpose a measuring and monitoring program is presented in this report. Hydraulic EngineeringCivil Engineering and Geoscience...|$|R

The uses of an <b>artificial</b> <b>mouth</b> include research for physical modeling of the lips and automatic performance.

In this study {{the use of a}} genetic algorithm to compute air pressure and lip pressure values so that the <b>artificial</b> <b>mouth</b> can correctly play five notes on a brass instrument is investigated. In order to properly playa brass instrument, a player must apply proper tension between the lips and apply proper airflow so that the lips vibrate at the proper frequency. A player changes the notes on a brass instrument by depressing keys and changing lip pressure and air flow. This study investigated a machine learning approach to finding lip pressure and air pressure parameters so that an <b>artificial</b> <b>mouth</b> could play five notes of a scale on a trumpet. A fast search algorithm was needed because it takes about 4 seconds to measure the frequency produced by each combination of pressure parameters. This measurement is slow because of the slow moving mechanics of the system and a delay produced while the notes are measured for pitch. Two different mouthpieces were used to investigate the ability to adapt to different mouthpieces. The algorithm started with a randomly generated population and evolved the lip pressure and air pressure parameters with an evolutionary algorithm using crossover and mutation designed for the knowledge scheme in this application. The efficiency of this algorithm was compared to an exhaustive search. Experimentation was performed using various combinations of genetic parameters including population size, crossover rate, and mutation rate. The evolutionary search was shown to be about 10 times faster than the exhaustive search because the evolutionary algorithm searches only very small portion of the search space. A recommendation for future research is to conduct further experimentation to determine more optimal crossover and mutation rates...|$|E
40|$|When {{playing a}} brass {{instrument}} {{the lips of}} the player fulfil a similar role to the cane reeds of wood-wind instruments. The nature of the motion of this lip-reed determines the ow of air through the lips, between the player's mouth and the instrument. It is a complicated feedback {{system in which the}} motion of the lips controls the air ow, which itself affects the behaviour of the lips. In recent years several designs of <b>artificial</b> <b>mouth</b> have been developed; these model the human lips using latex rubber tubes filled with water. These artificial mouths are increasingly used in experiments rather than enlisting the services of a musician as they have many advantages including greater accessibility and the stability of the embouchure. In this thesis factors affecting the reproducibility of the embouchure of one such <b>artificial</b> <b>mouth</b> are investigated with reference to the measured resonances of the lips. Using these results, procedures and practical design improvements are suggested. Two examples of comparative studies of historic instruments are presented. In order to provide detailed information on the behaviour of the lips of brass players high speed digital photography is used to image the self-oscillating lipreed. Variation in the lip opening, over a wide range of notes and different players, is investigated, providing experimental evidence to aid the process of reining physical models of the behaviour of the brass player's lips. Particular attention is paid to the relationship between the area and height of the lip opening. Results suggest that during extremely loud playing the lip motion is qualitatively similar to that in quieter notes and therefore is not the origin of the dramatic increase in the levels of the high harmonics of the radiated sound. Investigation of the behaviour {{at the start of a}} note has shown evidence relating the lip motion to the transient in the mouthpiece pressure waveform. Comparison is made between the behaviour of the artificial lips and that of the lips of musicians providing evidence of the suitability of the use of the <b>artificial</b> <b>mouth</b> as a model for real brass players. Results show that although differences exist, particularly when looking at behaviour over a wide range of dynamic levels, the general features of behaviour are reproduced by the <b>artificial</b> <b>mouth.</b> EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|E
40|$|The {{complexity}} of the oral environment, and ethical problems associated with studies of oral diseases in humans inevitably directed the attention to development of laboratory models, that simulate the human oral microcosm. These developments {{and in particular the}} in vitro 'artificial mouth' systems have progressed from simple and basic apparatus devised by Magitot and Miller at the end of 19 th century to the currently available, highly sophisticated, computer-controlled, multi-station <b>artificial</b> <b>mouth</b> systems. These advances have metamorphosed from the early studies devised primarily to investigate factors affecting the carious process to the present designs that evaluate growth, pathogenicity, metabolism and mineralization of dental plaque under highly controlled conditions. The modern 'artificial mouth systems' can evaluate microbial interactions in simulated dental plaque and similar biofilms and monitor their physical, chemical, biological and molecular features to a very high degree of accuracy. We review and trace here the historical aspects and developments leading to the currently available <b>artificial</b> <b>mouth</b> systems and discuss their contribution to the study of oral flora, especially related to many variants of dental caries. © 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd.

40|$|International audienceThis study {{focuses on}} a {{particular}} attribute of trumpet tones, the brightness, and on the physical characteristics of the instrument thought to govern its magnitude. On the one hand, an objective study was carried out with input impedance measurements, and, on the other hand, a subjective study with hearing tests and a panel of subjects. To create a set of different trumpets a variable depth mouthpiece was developed whose depth can be easily and continuously adjusted from “deep” to “shallow. ” Using this mouthpiece and the same trumpet, several instruments were generated which may be played in three ways: (i) by a musician, (ii) by an <b>artificial</b> <b>mouth,</b> and (iii) using physical modeling simulations. The influence of {{the depth of the}} mouthpiece on the perception of the trumpet's tones was investigated, and the ability of a musician, the <b>artificial</b> <b>mouth,</b> or physical modeling simulations to demonstrate perceptively noticeable differences was assessed. Physical characteristics extracted from the impedance curves are finally proposed to explain the brightness of trumpet tones. As a result, the physical modeling simulations now seem to be mature enough to exhibit coherent and subtle perceptual differences between tones. This opens the door to virtual acoustics for instrument makers...|$|E
