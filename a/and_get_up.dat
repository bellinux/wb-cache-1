From it you can see dozens of Ikata's 29.5-meter, 4.3-ton windmills, <b>and</b> <b>get</b> <b>up</b> close to 11 of them. An actual wing of one of the windmills is on display in the park so visitors can get a better idea of the actual size. Benches and observation decks dot the park and Haikus about the windmills, submitted for Ikata's Windmill Festival, are on display year-round.|$|E
5|$|The gestational period {{lasts for}} about {{eight and a}} half months, after which a single calf is born. Females in labour do not move away from the female herd and {{repeatedly}} lie down <b>and</b> <b>get</b> <b>up</b> again. Births normally take place in areas with short grass when the cow is in the lying position. She stands up immediately afterwards which causes the umbilical cord to break, vigorously licks the calf and chews on the afterbirth. In spite of regional variations, around 80% of the females give birth to their calves within a period of two to three weeks after the onset of the rainy season - from mid-November to the end of December. Seasonal breeding has also been reported among wildebeest in captivity in European zoos. Twin births have not been reported.|$|E

500|$|Northern English accents {{have not}} {{undergone}} the TRAP–BATH split, {{and a common}} shibboleth to distinguish them from Southern ones is the Northern use of the short a (the near-open front unrounded vowel) in words such as bath and castle. On the opposite border, most Northern English accents can be distinguished from Scottish accents because they are non-rhotic, although a few rhotic Lancashire accents remain. Other features common to many Northern English accents are {{the absence of the}} FOOT–STRUT split (so put and putt are homophones), the reduction of the definite article the to a glottal stop (usually represented in writing as t), and the T-to-R rule that leads to the pronunciation of t as a rhotic consonant in words and phrases like matter (...) <b>and</b> <b>get</b> <b>up</b> (...)

500|$|... "Beat Goes On" [...] {{received}} generally mixed {{to positive}} reviews from music critics. Caryn Ganz of Rolling Stone {{felt that the}} usage of bells and whistles as instrumentation, along with the disco sounds made the track connect to two of Madonna's inspirations, that of Chic, and Donna Summer. Ganz went on to criticize West's appearance, calling it [...] "uninspired". In a similar review, Thomas Hauner of PopMatters wrote that the song [...] "continues the Donna Summer touch, this time opting for 'beep beep' vocals on a surprisingly sweet track." [...] Sal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine believed that compared to the demo, the final version had lost an individuality, but complimented the addition of West, feeling that it [...] "transports [...] from 2001 to 1979". Talia Soghomolian of musicOMH praised [...] "the variations in its tempo", making it [...] "the perfect dance floor tune, merging old school and modern takes on urbanity." [...] Stern wrote a positive review for Idolator that [...] "by the time West shows up unexpectedly for his rap at the end, {{you have no choice}} but to heed his call to get down, beep beep, <b>and</b> <b>get</b> <b>up</b> outta your seat." ...|$|E

500|$|In {{the early}} 1970s, Miles Davis {{continued}} exploring directions {{radically different from}} the jazz music that made him renowned in the 1950s and 1960s. The music from this [...] in his career found him experimenting with rock, funk, African rhythms, emerging electronic music technology, and an ever-changing lineup of musicians who played electric instruments. The trumpeter attracted younger audiences as his fusion music became more radical and abstract while alienating older listeners, musicians, and critics in the jazz scene who accused him of selling out. After recording his 1972 On the Corner album, Davis began {{to focus more on}} performing live, working in the studio only sporadically and haphazardly; the 1974 releases Big Fun <b>and</b> <b>Get</b> <b>Up</b> with It compiled recordings he made between 1969 and 1974. By 1973, he had established most of his band's line-up, a septet featuring bassist Michael Henderson, guitarists Pete Cosey and Reggie Lucas, drummer Al Foster, percussionist James Mtume, and saxophonist Dave Liebman; Liebman left the group in 1974 and was replaced by Sonny Fortune. Lucas, Foster, and Mtume functioned as the band's rhythm section, while Cosey, Henderson, and Fortune were given space to improvise as soloists. Their concerts—played frequently at rock venues and festivals—became opportunities for Davis and his sidemen to test new musical ideas and ways to exploit electronic equipment.|$|E
500|$|The album's {{title and}} opening track, [...] "Dance Again", {{was written by}} RedOne, Enrique Iglesias, Bilal [...] "The Chef", AJ Junior and Pitbull, who is also {{featured}} in the song. After hearing a demo version of the track, she begged Iglesias to let her record the song, telling {{him that it was}} [...] "her song". Lopez, who was going through a divorce with Marc Anthony and the [...] "breakup of a family", felt as if the song had come to her at the [...] "perfect moment". According to Lopez, the period was devastating because family is very important to her. Lopez revealed: [...] "I had to turn that into something better"; she thought: [...] "I don't want to just survive it, I want to come out better than that." [...] Lopez didn't want to be [...] "the woman who stayed in bed for months". [...] "I knew I had to get through it.

[...] She re-wrote parts of the verses to better relate to her experiences. The song [...] "helped lift her out of the darkness" [...] and gave her hope again.

500|$|Feminist scholar Maria Lauret {{states that}} the {{formation}} of female cultural identity is woven into Angelou's narrative, setting her up as [...] "a role model for Black women". Lauret agrees with other scholars that Angelou reconstructs the Black woman's image throughout her autobiographies, and that Angelou uses her many roles, incarnations, and identities in her books to [...] "signify multiple layers of oppression and personal history". Angelou begins this technique in her first book, and continues it in Gather Together, especially her demonstration of the [...] "racist habit" [...] of renaming African Americans. Lauret sees Angelou's themes of the individual's strength and ability to overcome throughout Angelou's autobiographies as well. [...] Cudjoe states that Angelou is still concerned with {{what it means to}} be Black and female in America, but she now describes [...] "a particular type of Black woman at a specific moment in history and subjected to certain social forces which assault the Black woman with unusual intensity". When Angelou was concerned about what her readers would think when she disclosed that she had been a prostitute, her husband Paul Du Feu encouraged her to be honest and [...] "tell the truth as a writer". [...] Cudjoe recognizes Angelou's reluctance to disclose these events in the text, stating that although they are important in her social development, Angelou does not seem [...] "particularly proud of her activity during those 'few tense years'". Angelou has stated that she wrote the book, in spite of potentially harming the reputation she gained after writing Caged Bird, because she wanted to show how she was able to survive in a world where [...] "every door is not only locked, but there are no doorknobs... The children need to know you can stumble and fumble and fall, see where you are <b>and</b> <b>get</b> <b>up,</b> forgive yourself, and go on about the business of living your life".|$|E

40|$|AbstractObjectiveTo {{explore the}} {{relationships}} between different lifestyle-behavioral factors and phlegm-wetness type of Traditional Chinese Medicine constitution, so as to provide health management strategies for phlegm-wetness constitution. MethodsA case-control {{study was conducted with}} the cases selected from the database of Chinese constitution survey in 9 provinces or municipalities of China. 1380 cases met the diagnostic criteria of phlegm-wetness type were taken as the case group, and 1380 cases were randomly selected from gentleness type as the control group. Using Chi-square test to compare the differences of lifestyle-behavior composition in each group; single factor and multiple logistic regression analysis were used to compare the relationships of lifestyle-behavioral factors and phlegm-wetness type. ResultsThere were statistically significant differences between phlegm-wetness type group and gentleness type group in lifestyle behaviors (dietary habits, tobacco and liquor consumptions, exercise habits, sleeping habits). The results of single factor logistic regression analysis demonstrated that the risk of phlegm-wetness constitution decreased significantly in light diet (odds ratio, OR= 0. 68); The risk factors of phlegm-wetness type were fatty food intake (OR= 2. 36), sleeping early <b>and</b> <b>getting</b> <b>up</b> late (OR= 1. 87), tobacco smoking (OR= 1. 83), barbecued food intake (OR= 1. 68), alcohol drinking (OR= 1. 63), salty food intake (OR= 1. 44), sleeping erratically (OR= 1. 43), less physical activities (OR= 1. 42), sweet food intake (OR= 1. 29), sleeping <b>and</b> <b>getting</b> <b>up</b> late (OR= 1. 26), and pungent food intake (OR= 1. 21), respectively. Regardless of the interaction among lifestyle-behavioral factors, the results of the multiple logistic regression analysis revealed that the risk factors of phlegm-wetness type were sleeping early <b>and</b> <b>getting</b> <b>up</b> late (OR= 1. 94), fatty food intake (OR= 1. 80), tobacco smoking (OR= 1. 50), sleeping erratically (OR= 1. 50), barbecued food intake (OR= 1. 40), sleeping <b>and</b> <b>getting</b> <b>up</b> late (OR= 1. 40), less physical activities (OR= 1. 31), sleeping late <b>and</b> <b>getting</b> <b>up</b> early (OR= 1. 27), and sweet food intake (OR= 1. 27), respectively, and the risk of phlegm-wetness type still decreased significantly in light food intake (OR= 0. 79). ConclusionLight diet can decrease the risk of being phlegm-wetness constitution, and bad lifestyle behaviors such as sleeping early <b>and</b> <b>getting</b> <b>up</b> late, sleeping erratically, fatty food, barbecued food or sweet food intake, tobacco and liquor consumptions, and less physical activities can increase the risks of becoming phlegm-wetness constitution...|$|R
