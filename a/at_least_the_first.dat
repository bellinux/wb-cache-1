Training takes up to a year depending on specialisation; all midshipmen participate in <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> two terms, which are 14weeks each. Until they have completed initial fleet training, both midshipmen and sub-lieutenants at Britannia Royal Naval College do not use their substantive ranks, but instead use the rank of officer cadet.|$|E
5|$|As {{the reigning}} {{champions of the}} UEFA Champions League, Manchester United began their title defence at the group stage, {{for which they were}} given the top seed. This {{position}} amongst the top eight European clubs meant that they would avoid drawing former European champions Barcelona, Internazionale and Real Madrid until <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> knockout round, although they were {{faced with the prospect of}} drawing Bayern Munich or Roma. Nevertheless, United ended up being drawn into Group E with two teams they had played against before: Villarreal (whom they had drawn in 2005–06) and Celtic (2006–07); and one they had not: Aalborg BK.|$|E

5|$|Bees {{have been}} kept in hives since <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>the</b> <b>First</b> Dynasty of Egypt, five {{thousand}} years ago, and man had been harvesting honey from the wild long before that. Fixed comb hives are used {{in many parts of}} the world and are made from any locally available material. In more advanced economies, where modern strains of domestic bee have been selected for docility and productiveness, various designs of hive are used which enable the combs to be removed for processing and extraction of honey. Quite apart from the honey and wax they produce, honey bees are important pollinators of crops and wild plants, and in many places hives are transported around the countryside to assist in pollination.|$|E
5|$|Information about Chilembwe’s Church {{before the}} {{rebellion}} is scant, but his ideology proved popular and {{he developed a}} strong local following. For <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> 12 years of his ministry, he preached ideas of African self-respect and advancement through education, hard work and personal responsibility, as advocated by Booker T. Washington, and he encouraged his followers to adopt European-style dress and habits. His activities were initially supported by white protestant missionaries., although his relations with Catholic missions were less friendly. he Mission's schools meanwhile began teaching racial equality, based on Christian teaching and anti-colonialism. Many of his followers came from the local middle-class, who had similarly adopted European customs. Chilembwe's acceptance of European culture created an unorthodox anti-colonial ideology based around a form of nationalism, rather than a desire to restore the pre-colonial social order.|$|E
5|$|Jean Sibelius's Symphony No. 8 was {{his final}} major {{compositional}} project, occupying him intermittently from the mid-1920s until around 1938, {{though he never}} published it. During this time Sibelius was {{at the peak of}} his fame, a national figure in his native Finland and a composer of international stature. A fair copy of <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> movement was made, but how much of the Eighth Symphony was completed is unknown. Sibelius repeatedly refused to release it for performance, though he continued to assert that he was working on it even after he had, according to later reports from his family, burned the score and associated material, probably in 1945.|$|E

5|$|On June 14, a {{match with}} {{abbreviated}} rounds was staged between boxers Michael Leonard and Jack Cushing at the Black Maria. Seven-hundred-and-fifty feet worth of images {{or even more}} were shot {{at the rate of}} 30 fps—easily the longest motion picture to date. In August 1894, the film premiered at the Kinetoscope Exhibition Company's parlor at 83 Nassau Street in New York. A half-dozen expanded Kinetoscope machines each showed a different round of the fight for a dime, meaning sixty cents to see the complete bout. For a planned series of follow-up fights (of which the outcome of <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> was fixed), the Lathams signed famous heavyweight James J. Corbett, stipulating that his image could not be recorded by any other Kinetoscope company—the first movie star contract.|$|E
5|$|The {{eastern part}} of the hill fort {{remained}} in use for <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> few decades of the Roman occupation, although the duration and nature of habitation is uncertain. Many 1st-century Roman artefacts have been discovered near the east entrance and in the centre of the hill fort. It has been suggested that Maiden Castle was occupied as a Roman military outpost or fort and the settlement discontinued, as there is no known fort in the area and it was not uncommon for hill forts in the southwest to have been occupied by Roman forces. This was a characteristic of Vespasian's campaign in the region; there was military occupation at Cadbury Castle in Somerset, Hembury in Devon, and Hodd Hill in Dorset.|$|E
5|$|In early 1966 Jim Brown, who {{had begun}} an acting career two years before, was {{shooting}} {{for his second}} film in London. The Dirty Dozen cast Brown as Robert Jefferson, a convict sent to France during World War II to assassinate German officers meeting at a castle near Rennes in Brittany. Production delays due to bad weather meant he would miss <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> part of training camp {{on the campus of}} Hiram College, which annoyed Modell, who threatened to fine Brown $1,500 for every week of camp he missed. Brown, who had previously said that 1966 would be his last season, announced his retirement instead. At the end of his nine-year career, Brown held records for most rushing yards in a game, a season and a career. He also owned the record for all-purpose yards in a career and best average per carry for a running back at 5.22yards, a mark that still stands.|$|E
