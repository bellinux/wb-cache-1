5|$|The three subprovinces <b>are</b> <b>separated</b> by steeply dipping shear zones {{caused by}} {{continued}} compression {{that occurred during}} the Algoman orogeny. These boundaries are major fault zones.|$|E
5|$|All erosion types took {{advantage}} of preexisting weaknesses in the rock such as rock type, amount of lithification, {{and the presence of}} cracks or joints in the rock. Basalt flows concentrated in valleys but subsequent erosion removed sedimentary rock that once stood at higher elevations. The resulting inverted relief consists of ridges capped by basalt which <b>are</b> <b>separated</b> by adjacent drainages.|$|E
50|$|Any {{two points}} which can <b>be</b> <b>separated</b> by a {{function}} can <b>be</b> <b>separated</b> by closed neighborhoods.

It follows that every completely Hausdorff space is Urysohn and every Urysohn space is Hausdorff.|$|R
