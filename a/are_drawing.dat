Instead, smart firms <b>are</b> <b>drawing</b> {{on the power of}} mass collaboration to involve participation of the people they could not employ. This also helps generate continual interest in the firm in the form of those drawn to new idea creation as well as investment opportunities.|$|E
25|$|The {{easiest way}} to locate the {{constellation}} is to find its two brightest stars Castor and Pollux eastward from the familiar “V” shaped asterism of Taurus and the three stars of Orion’s belt. Another way is to mentally draw {{a line from the}} Pleiades star cluster located in Taurus and the brightest star in Leo, Regulus. In doing so, you <b>are</b> <b>drawing</b> an imaginary line that is relatively close to the ecliptic, a line which intersects Gemini roughly at the midpoint of the constellation, just below Castor and Pollux.|$|E
25|$|In the inn, Pippin has {{too much}} to drink and begins to tell stories about Bilbo. Afraid that he will reveal too much, Frodo climbs on a table and begins to sing and dance to {{distract}} the crowd. However, he slips, and the Ring lands on his finger, turning him invisible. An angry ranger takes the hobbits into another room, warning them they <b>are</b> <b>drawing</b> too much attention to themselves. He introduces himself as Strider (Daran Norris) and asks if he may join them on their journey. At this point, the innkeeper, Barliman Butterbur (Daran Norris), arrives with a letter from Gandalf which informs Frodo that Strider is really Aragorn, a trusted friend. Attracted by Frodo's accidental use of the Ring, the Nazgûl come to Bree, but Aragorn successfully hides the hobbits.|$|E

25|$|For {{the past}} years, {{researchers}} {{have been trying to}} reduce the price of solar cells while maximizing efficiency. Thin-film solar cell is a cost-effective second generation solar cell with much reduced thickness at the expense of light absorption efficiency. Efforts to maximize light absorption efficiency with reduced thickness have been made. Surface texturing is one of techniques used to reduce optical losses to maximize light absorbed. Currently, surface texturing techniques on silicon photovoltaics <b>are</b> <b>drawing</b> much attention. Surface texturing could be done in multiple ways. Etching single crystalline silicon substrate can produce randomly distributed square based pyramids on the surface using anisotropic etchants. Recent studies show that c-Si wafers could be etched down to form nano-scale inverted pyramids. Multicrystalline silicon solar cells, due to poorer crystallographic quality, are less effective than single crystal solar cells, but mc-Si solar cells are still being used widely due to less manufacturing difficulties. It is reported that multicrystalline solar cells can be surface-textured to yield solar energy conversion efficiency comparable to that of monocrystalline silicon cells, through isotropic etching or photolithography techniques. Incident light rays onto a textured surface do not reflect back out to the air as opposed to rays onto a flat surface. Rather some light rays are bounced back onto the other surface again due to the geometry of the surface. This process significantly improves light to electricity conversion efficiency, due to increased light absorption. This texture effect as well as the interaction with other interfaces in the PV module is a challenging optical simulation task. A particularly efficient method for modeling and optimization is the OPTOS formalism. In 2012, researchers at MIT reported that c-Si films textured with nanoscale inverted pyramids could achieve light absorption comparable to 30 times thicker planar c-Si. In combination with anti-reflective coating, surface texturing technique can effectively trap light rays within a thin film silicon solar cell. Consequently, required thickness for solar cells decreases with the increased absorption of light rays.|$|E
500|$|On 4 October, TV3 {{broadcast}} Vincent Browne's Big Presidential Debate. Gay Mitchell challenged Martin McGuinness on the [...] "fairytale" [...] that he {{left the}} IRA in 1974, asking him directly: [...] "If you (McGuinness) say you left the IRA in 1974 and persist in saying that when you didn’t; {{if you say you}} are living on the average industrial wage when you <b>are</b> <b>drawing</b> down a couple of hundred grand– how can people have confidence in your word?" [...] Moderator Vincent Browne later challenged Martin McGuinness' claims {{that he left}} the Provisional Irish Republican Army in 1974, producing eight books with alleged evidence claiming otherwise.

500|$|Trevor Noah also avoided talking {{too much}} about Fox News, as Stewart was {{previously}} known for. [...] "The Daily Show {{was based on an}} emerging 24 hour news cycle, that’s everything it was, that’s what inspired The Daily Show. Now you look at news and it’s changed. It’s no longer predicated around 24 hour news. There are so many different choices. Half of it is online now. Now you’ve got the 'Gawker's, the 'Buzzfeed's. The way people <b>are</b> <b>drawing</b> their news is soundbites and headlines and click-bait links has changed everything. The biggest challenge {{is going to be an}} exciting one I'm sure is how are we going to bring all of that together looking at it from a bigger lens as opposed to just going after one source — which was historically Fox News" [...] Noah said at a press conference before the shows debut.|$|E

[...] Economic thinker and philosopher Joseph Heath praised the program in his 2010 book , citing it as an example of how to manage incentives of people whose poverty results from hyperbolic discounting. Heath wrote, [...] "What makes programs such as this so successful is that they do not change people's incentives: They merely rearrange the temporal sequence in which these incentives are experienced. ... This has proven to be more valuable than a thousand recitations of the fable of the ant and the grasshopper." ...|$|E
