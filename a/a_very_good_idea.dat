500|$|September 10, 1778, General Grey {{in command}} of a {{transport}} of eighty-two sails and ten thousand British troops made a raid upon the Vineyard, carrying off all the sheep, swine, cattle and oxen that could be found. To oppose this wholesale spoliation the [...] "Islanders" [...] had no power so they submitted in sullen and despairing silence, at times even assisting to drive away the captured flocks, hoping thereby to prevent still greater waste and outrage. <b>A</b> <b>very</b> <b>good</b> <b>idea</b> of this period is given in the diary of Colonel Beriah Norton, which reads as follows: ...|$|E

This approach is assumed to lead to better and more complete ideas than merely generating new ideas alone. It is believed to stimulate the building of ideas by a process of association.|$|R

5|$|Although the UK Government has set {{a target}} of 10% for the {{proportion}} of the UK's electricity produced by renewable energy by 2010, wind power in the UK {{has a long history of}} controversy, with an average approval rate for planning permission of only 28% for onshore wind farms. Scout Moor was first identified as an excellent site for a wind farm in 2001. Peel Holdings commissioned market research consultants MORI to undertake a telephone poll over seventeen days in 2002, soliciting the opinions of residents in Bury, Rossendale and Rochdale about wind farms in general and Scout Moor in particular. The results showed that 88% of respondents thought wind farms were <b>a</b> <b>very</b> or fairly <b>good</b> <b>idea,</b> 72% thought the Scout Moor project was <b>a</b> <b>very</b> or fairly <b>good</b> <b>idea,</b> and 63% stated wind power as the preferred energy source.|$|R

I had travelled scarcely at all, I had never crossed the Channel, but I had read copiously and I had formed <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>good</b> working <b>idea</b> of this round globe with its mountains and wildernesses and forests and all the sorts and conditions of human life that were scattered over its surface. It was all alive, I felt, and changing every day; how it was changing, and the changes men might bring about, fascinated my mind beyond measure.|$|R

5000|$|Wright's {{portrait}} of Blair caused {{a great deal}} of controversy from the parents of the soldiers who died.

Ann Probyn, whose son, Daniel, died in Afghanistan, described Annemarie's work as honest. [...] "This piece of art seems like <b>an</b> honest and <b>very</b> <b>good</b> <b>idea.</b> Me and my husband blame Tony Blair for sending our boy to his death and this is an imaginative way of holding him to account for that".|$|R
40|$|Background: A health {{promoter}} is {{the name}} given to all those experts who are intended to prevent disease andill health and to increase well-being at the community level. That seems to be <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>good</b> and useful <b>idea</b> ingeneral, but can it be achieved by individuals alone?Objective: Review to what extend team work {{and the concept of}} team development are a pre-requisite foreffective health promotion. That is the central objective of this article and the answer will be explored through ananalysis of the international literature. Discussion: The first part will set out to define the notions of both health promotion and health promotionspecialists, in order to provide a framework for the multi-professional and multi-disciplinary nature of healthpromotion. The second part will try to establish the meaning of collaboration for health promotion, starting withdefinitions of the concepts: group, team and teamwork. The benefits of collaborative work in health promotionwill be discussed alongside the common barriers that can arise during the process. Conclusions: The article will conclude by proposing the characteristics of a successful team-working healthpromotion group...|$|R
40|$|Objectives: Efforts are {{underway}} to develop advanced alcohol detection technologies {{suitable for use}} in all vehicles to prevent driving with an illegal blood alcohol concentration (BAC). Public attitudes toward having this technology in all vehicles were assessed. Methods: A nationally representative sample of people 18 and older was interviewed by telephone about attitudes toward in-vehicle alcohol detection technology. Results: Eighty-four percent of survey respondents supported requiring convicted DWI offenders to put alcohol ignition interlocks in their vehicles. Sixty-four percent said having advanced alcohol detection technology in all vehicles is <b>a</b> <b>good</b> or <b>very</b> <b>good</b> <b>idea,</b> assuming the technology is reliable; 30 % said it is a bad idea. Most people in favor said it would prevent alcohol-impaired driving, save lives, or prevent crashes. Among respondents who said it is a bad/very bad idea, one-third cited concerns about privacy or government interference; 20 % said not all drivers need to be screened. Support for the technology was highest among respondents who do not drink, but it also was favored {{by the majority of}} respondents who drink, respondents who have driven within 2 hours of consuming alcohol, and respondents who may have driven when they were above the legal limit for alcohol. Forty-two percent of respondents who drive said they would want an advanced alcohol detection device in their next vehicles if it was available as an option at a reasonable price. Of the 54 % who said they would not want a device, 44 % said they do not drink alcohol so it would not be useful. Most people said a price less than $ 500 would be reasonable. Conclusions: It appears {{that the majority of the}} US population is receptive to the idea of having advanced alcohol detection devices in all vehicles to prevent people from driving with an illegal BAC...|$|R
