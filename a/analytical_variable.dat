40|$|Co-simulation is {{a method}} which makes it {{possible}} to study the electric machine and its drive at once, as one system. By taking into account the actual inverter voltage waveforms in a finite element model instead of using only the fundamental, we are able to study the electrical machine’s behavior in more realistic scenario. The recent increase in the use of variable speed drives justifies the research on such simulation techniques. In this paper we present the co-simulation of an inverter fed permanent magnet synchronous machine. The modelling method employs an <b>analytical</b> <b>variable</b> speed drive model and a finite element electrical machine model. By linking the <b>analytical</b> <b>variable</b> speed drive model together with a finite element model the complex simulation model enables the investigation of the electrical machine during actual operation. The methods are coupled via the results. This means that output of the finite element model serves as an input to the analytical model, and the output of the analytical model provides the input of the finite element model for a different simulation, thus enabling the finite element simulation of an inverter fed machine. The resulting speed and torque characteristics from the analytical model and the finite element model show a good agreement. The experiences with the co-simulation technique encourage further research and effort to improve the method...|$|E

The <b>analytical</b> <b>variable,</b> fluorescence quenching, was generated from the formation of benzoquinone intermediates, which formed during the catalytic oxidation of hydroquinone by horseradish peroxidase (HRP). In general, the reaction mechanism involved hydroquinone, as an electron acceptor, which affected the surface state of GQDs via an electron transfer effect. The water-soluble GQDs were directly prepared by the pyrolysis of citric acid and with the use of the mentioned hybrid enzyme system, the detection limit for hydroquinone was as low as 8. 4 × 10 − 8 M. Furthermore, this analysis was almost unaffected by other phenol and quinine compounds, such as phenol, resorcinol and other quinines, and therefore, the developed GQD method produced satisfactory results {{for the analysis}} of hydroquinone in several different lake water samples...|$|E

In many cases, the COR is considered as a constant value, but it varies according to many variables. In this paper, we introduce an <b>analytical</b> <b>variable</b> COR model considering aero dynamics along with its verification through experiment. To introduce and analyze the variable characteristic of the COR model, the collision phenomenon between a pendulum and two kinds of ball is employed as an example and aerodynamics such as drag force is considered for analyzing the after-effect of the collision. Collision velocity of the pendulum, dynamic parameters of colliding bodies, contact time, drag coefficient, the air density, and the cross-sectional area of the ball are found as the typical variables of analytical COR model. This observation generalizes the result in previous researches. To verify new COR model, the travel distances for the curve-fitted constant COR model and the curve-fitted variable COR model are compared through simulation and experiment.

40|$|This {{paper is}} {{motivated}} by a long-standing curiosity {{about the role of}} scale in explanatory theories of socio-economic action. Introducing scale as an <b>analytical</b> <b>variable</b> implies the coexistence of individuals alongside institutions. We make the case that economic activity becomes more sustainable when it is ‘colonized’ by ‘social value’ whereby market activity is complemented with community and democratic values, by which we mean the opposite of the commodification of e. g. social networks analytics. We take the Sardex mutual credit system as an empirical context from which to begin exploring the extent to which such community-based economic practices offer a democratic and social alternative to, a questionable substitute for, or a functional supplement to the capitalist market, the welfare state, and public enterprises administered by state bureaucracies. We broach critically the emergence of institutional collective structures from the perspective of social constructivism, post- anarchist theory, economic anthropology, and post-capitalist studies of economic action. In particular, we focus on how Graeber’s ideas on the history of debt apply to these points. We propose a recursive constructive framework for socio-economic action whereby money as a social construction is itself a medium of economic construction and, as such, becomes an important lever subject to “design” inputs by socio-economic stakeholders engaged in the development of an inclusive and participatory governance process of institution construction...|$|E

Although rarely taken into account as an <b>analytical</b> <b>variable</b> in studies of international development communication, mediation is implicit in donor-driven practice. In the act of framing a problem and favouring a solution, and of communicating about a problem and solution in particular ways, donors seek to mediate their complex relationships with recipient countries and with citizens at both ends of the donor-recipient equation. But which forms of media engagement do they propose to these ends? How is mediated communication aimed at doing good for the citizens of recipient countries? How is it used to communicate do-gooding to the citizens of donor countries? Which media technologies are foregrounded and which media-driven practices are favoured to promote one and the other?

40|$|Nationality is {{too often}} {{introduced}} and then forgotten in literature on foreign domestic workers (FDWs). The concept of nationality is complex, both at a theoretical and an empirical level, particularly as it is manifested in the lived experience of these workers. This thesis constitutes an analysis driven by questions of nationality, national identity and citizenship. In short, nationality is elevated {{to the position of}} critical <b>analytical</b> <b>variable.</b> Drawing on field research, nationality is systematically explored through the analysis of a series of relationships which underwrite the lived experiences of Indonesian FDWs in Taiwan. These relationships, which begin in Indonesia and continue in Taiwan, involve states, citizens, NGOs and non-citizens and revolve around issues of citizenship and national identity. The case of Taiwan is particularly interesting due to the relatively recent emergence of democracy and expansion of civil society after an extended period of authoritarianism. Taiwan’s pursuit of independence from China not only shapes its national identity but also forms the backdrop for debates about foreign labour and migrant workers’ rights. Despite the current democratic environment, the legacy of a military-authoritarian regime remains in the weak labour laws and ineffective enforcement mechanisms. For Indonesian FDWs, this is further complicated by Taiwanese politico-cultural traditions whereby the familial work environment is largely unregulated. While the recent multiplication of NGOs has marginally increased state and employer accountability, the structural powerlessness of Indonesian FDWs to pursue their rights has worked against significant protection for these workers. Essentially, Indonesian FDW/carers in Taiwan, by virtue of their nationality, citizenship and gender, labour within a “wild zone of power” where the rule of law often ignores the...|$|E

40|$|This study {{examines}} how {{the interaction between}} globalisation and domestic politics shaped {{the evolution of the}} ASEAN Free Trade Area (AFTA) between 1991 and 2000. Previous studies have argued that AFTA, a project of open regionalism, was adopted to attract foreign direct (FDI) investment to the region. Accurate to a degree, this dissertation argues that the concern with FDI {{is only part of the}} AFTA story, albeit an important part. The FDI explanation is unable to explain why market access and national treatment privileges were offered to national (domestic) investors from the ASEAN countries at least ten years ahead of foreign (non-ASEAN) investors in AFTA's investment liberalisation programme. The dissertation explains this departure from open regionalism, which has yet to be accounted for in the literature, by advancing the notion of 'developmental' regionalism. Underwritten by strategic trade theory rather than neoclassical economics, developmental regionalism emphasises the nurturing of domestic capital by using the expanded regional market and temporary protection or privileges for domestic capital as the means to build up domestic firms capable of meeting global market competition. Unlike existing models of the globalisation-regionalism relationship, which do not integrate domestic politics or do so in a limited way, the model of developmental regionalism considers domestic capital to be a key <b>analytical</b> <b>variable,</b> and takes seriously its location within domestic politics and society. Using documentary research and elite interviews, and guided by these theoretical insights, the study shows that AFTA encompasses the features of both open and developmental regionalism due to the political significance of both foreign and domestic capital in the ASEAN economies. While both forms of regionalism were driven by the imperative of growth, distributive concerns were weaved into the concern with growth in developmental regionalism, as governments sought to nurture those segments of domestic capital that were important in sustaining elite rule...|$|E

As such, these analyses explore how and why race/ethnicity comes {{to be used in}} the context of genetic research, set against the background of continuing critiques from anthropology and related human sciences that focus on the social construction, structural correlates and limited genetic validity of racial/ethnic categories. The analyses demonstrate how these critiques have failed to engage geneticists, and how geneticists use a range of essentially cultural devices to protect and separate their use of race/ethnicity as a genetic construct from its use as a societal and social science resource. Given its multidisciplinary, biosocial nature and the cultural gaze of its ethnographic methodologies, anthropology is well placed to explore the cultural separation of science and society, and of natural and social science disciplines. Anthropological {{insights into}} the use of race/ethnicity to explore disparities in health suggest that moving beyond genetic explanations of innate difference might benefit from a more even-handed critique of how both the natural and social sciences tend to essentialize selective elements of race/ethnicity. Drawing on the example of HIV/AIDS, this paper demonstrates how public health has been undermined by the use of race/ethnicity as an <b>analytical</b> <b>variable,</b> both as a cipher for innate genetic differences in susceptibility and response to treatment, and in its use to identify ‘core groups’ at greater risk of becoming infected and infecting others.

Subsequently the sample was subjected to a clean-up procedure using a two-trap system composed of a first cartridge of non-specific adsorbing material (C 18) and of a second cartridge containing a sulphonic acid type silica-based anion exchanger. The determination was performed by HPLC with electrochemical detection. <b>Analytical</b> <b>variables</b> such as efficiency of hydrolysis, enzyme purification, hydrodynamic voltammetric studies and variation in the DES trans/cis ratio were investigated. Mean recovery of total DES was 87. 3 %. The precision of the procedure was 7. 2 % for DES levels of 0. 5 ng/g and 2. 1 % for levels of 5 ng/g...|$|R
