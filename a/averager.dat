Older aircraft sextants had two visual paths, one standard and the other designed for use in open-cockpit aircraft that let one view from directly over the sextant in one's lap. More modern aircraft sextants were periscopic with only a small projection above the fuselage.

50|$|The {{origin of}} the boxcar <b>averager</b> dates back to as early as 1950 where the {{technique}} helped to improve signal quality in experiments investigating nuclear magnetic resonances with pulsed schemes. D. Ware and P. Mansfield mention in a publication of 1966 “Much of the early work on “boxcar” circuits, including a theoretical analysis is contained in J. L. Lawson and G. E. Uhlenbeck, Threshold Signals, MIT Radiation Laboratory Series (McGraw-Hill Book Company, Inc., New York, 1950). The first reported application of “boxcar circuits to NMR was D. F. Holocomb and R. E. Norberg, Phys. Rev. 98, 1074 (1955)”. In their 1955 paper Holocomb and Norberg credit {{the invention of the}} “boxcar integrator” to a large extent to L. S. Kypta and H. W. Knoebel.|$|E
50|$|The {{majority}} of today's lock-in amplifiers {{are based on}} high-performance digital signal processing (DSP). Over the last 20 years, digital lock-in amplifiers have been replacing analog models across the entire frequency range, allowing users to perform measurements up to a frequency of 600 MHz. Initial problems of the first digital lock-in amplifiers, e.g. the presence of digital clock noise on the input connectors, could be completely eliminated by use of improved electronic components and better instrument design. Today's digital lock-in amplifiers outperform analog models in all relevant performance parameters, such as frequency range, input noise, stability and dynamic reserve. In addition to better performance, digital lock-in amplifiers can include multiple demodulators, which allows analyzing a signal with different filter settings or at multiple different frequencies simultaneously. Moreover, experimental data can be analyzed with additional tools such as an oscilloscope, FFT spectrum analyzers, boxcar <b>averager</b> or used to provide feedback by using internal PID controllers. Some models of the digital lock-in amplifiers are computer-controlled and feature a graphical user interface (can be a platform-independent browser user interface) and a choice of programming interfaces.|$|E
5000|$|The sweep {{technique}} is a hybrid frequency domain/time domain technique. A plot of, for example, response amplitude versus the check {{size of a}} stimulus checkerboard pattern plot can be obtained in 10 seconds, far faster than when time-domain averaging is used to record an evoked potential for each of several check sizes.In the original demonstration of the technique the sine and cosine products were fed through lowpass filters (as when recording a SSEP [...] ) while viewing a pattern of fine checks whose black and white squares exchanged place six times per second. Then {{the size of the}} squares was progressively increased so as to give a plot of evoked potential amplitude versus check size (hence [...] "sweep"). Subsequent authors have implemented the sweep technique by using computer software to increment the spatial frequency of a grating in a series of small steps and to compute a time-domain average for each discrete spatial frequency.A single sweep may be adequate or {{it may be necessary to}} average the graphs obtained in several sweeps with the <b>averager</b> triggered by the sweep cycle. Averaging 16 sweeps can improve the signal-to-noise ratio of the graph by a factor of four.The sweep technique has proved useful in measuring rapidly adapting visual processes and also for recording from babies, where recording duration is necessarily short. Norcia and Tyler have used the technique to document the development of visual acuity and contrast sensitivity through the first years of life. They have emphasized that, in diagnosing abnormal visual development, the more precise the developmental norms, the more sharply can the abnormal be distinguished from the normal, and to that end have documented normal visual development in a large group of infants. For many years the sweep technique has been used in paediatric ophthalmology (electrodiagnosis) clinics worldwide.|$|E
40|$|Reinforcement {{learning}} {{promises a}} generic method for adapting agents to arbitrary tasks in arbitrary stochastic environments, but applying it to new real-world problems remains difficult, a few impressive success stories notwithstanding. Most interesting agent-environment systems have large state spaces, so performance depends crucially on efficient generalization {{from a small}} amount of experience. Current algorithms rely on model-free function approximation, which estimates the long-term values of states and actions directly from data and assumes that actions have similar values in similar states. This paper proposes model-based function approximation, which combines two forms of generalization by assuming that in addition to having similar values in similar states, actions also have similar effects. For one family of generalization schemes known as <b>averagers,</b> computation of an approximate value function from an approximate model is shown to be equivalent to the computation of the exact value function for a finite model derived from data. This derivation both integrates two independent sources of generalization and permits the extension of model-based techniques developed for finite problems. Preliminary experiments with a novel algorithm, AMBI (Approximate Models Based on Instances), demonstrate that this approach yields faster learning on some standard benchmark problems than many contemporary algorithms...|$|R
40|$|When {{trying to}} detect or {{quantify}} a signal {{at or near}} the limit of detectability, it is invariably embeded in the noise. This statement is true for nearly all detectors of any physical phenomena and the limit of detectability, hopefully, occurs at very low signal-to-noise levels. This is particularly true of IMS (Ion Mobility Spectrometers) spectra due to the low vapor pressure of several chemical compounds of great interest and the small currents associated with the ionic detection process. Gated Integrators and Boxcar Integrators or <b>Averagers</b> are designed to recover fast, repetitive analog signals. In a typical application, a time 'Gate' or 'Window' is generated, characterized by a set delay from a trigger or gate pulse and a certain width. A Gated Integrator amplifies and integrates the signal that is present during the time the gate is open, ignoring noise and interference that may be present at other times. Boxcar Integration refers to the practice of averaging the output of the Gated Integrator over many sweeps of the detector. Since any signal present during the gate will add linearly, while noise will add in a 'random walk' fashion as the square root of the number of sweeps, averaging N sweeps will improve the 'Signal-to-Noise Ratio' by a factor of the square root of N...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, {{we study}} the {{open-loop}} linearity of pulse excited coil-less fluxgate. Narrow current pulses {{can be used}} instead of classical sinewave for the excitation of the coil-less fluxgate. This method has shown several advantages, mainly regarding reduction of power consumption, normally in order of tens of microwatts. The disadvantage is that traditional phase-sensitive detection cannot be used as it results {{in a very small}} sensitivity. Using pulse excitation, the output signal is obtained by integrating a part of the positive pulse and a part of the negative pulse, and then summing up the resulting voltages. This process was realized using two boxcar <b>averagers</b> SR 4153. The achieved open-loop linearity error is much higher than for sinewave excitation and it is not sufficient for precise applications. We show that the linearity strongly depends on the symmetry of the two integrating windows. In order to obtain precise timing, we realized an excitation board using PIC microcontrollers, which provides both the pulsing signals for excitation current and the gating signals for integration. Using this board and optimum position of the integrating window, we obtained a 0. 6 % maximum nonlinearity in plusmn 100 -muT range, which is sufficient for portable compass...|$|R

40|$|RATIONALE Analog-to-digital {{converter}} (ADC) -based acquisition {{systems are}} widely applied in time-of-flight mass spectrometers (TOFMS) {{due to their}} ability to record the signal intensity of all ions within the same pulse. However, the acquisition system raises the requirement for data throughput, along with increasing the conversion rate and resolution of the ADC. It is therefore of considerable interest to develop a high-performance real-time acquisition system, which can relieve the limitation of data throughput. METHODS We present in this work a high-efficiency real-time digital signal <b>averager,</b> consisting of a signal conditioner, a data conversion module and a signal processing module. Two optimization strategies are implemented using field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) to enhance the efficiency of the real-time processing.

40|$|Abstract [...] A new hybrid {{technique}} using Support Vector Machines (SVM) and Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) {{to forecast}} the next ‘ 24 ’ hours load is proposed in this paper. The forecasted load {{for the next}} ‘ 24 ’ hours is obtained by using four modules consisting of the Basic SVM, Peak and Valley ANN, <b>Averager</b> and Forecaster and Adaptive Combiner.

40|$|The {{intent of}} this {{research}} was to model sensor degradation effects using an image chain applied to a synthetic radiance image. The model is relatively basic so that many types of sensors can be modeled. The sensor effects were applied in the frequency domain by cascading modulation transfer functions (MTF) and phase transfer functions (PTF) from the different stages of the image chain. The stages consist of the optical transfer function due to the aperture effects of the optical system. Noise due to photon arrival, the signal loss due to the transmission of the optics, the MTF due to the detector size, the MTF and PTF due to the Charge Transfer Efficiency (CTE) of the detector/electronics, and the noise associated with the electrical system. Each component is a spatial <b>averager</b> where the input radiance field is smoothed as it travels through each component in the chain. The system is intended to make the synthetic image look real while still preserving the radiometry of the scene. The components were modeled through functions written in the interactive data language (IDL).

40|$|The {{scattering}} of ultrasonic waves {{depends on the}} relation scatterer diameter to wavelength. Coarse grained materials and high frequency ultrasonic waves therefore ere exciting high scattering amplitudes. During pulse-echo testing a backscattering signal {{is the result of}} superimposing all the single scattering processes in the sound beam for a given time of flight. Rectifying, digitizing and adding up several A-scans from several different probe positions, angles of incidence or frequencies equalizes interference maxima and minima. The resulting backscattering curve can be evaluated qualitatively and quantitatively for the materials structure characterization. Additionally, an improvement of the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is achieved for a defect surrounded by a coarse grained structure. The application in practice depends among other things on the time in which a sufficient number of digitized A-scans is averaged and on the dimensions and operating conditions of the equipment. With these limits a prototype instrument was developed. Up to 1024 digitized A-scans (each 400 ps long, digitizing rate 20 MHz) are averaged in 0. 4 sec.
