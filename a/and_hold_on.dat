5|$|The Battle of Boroughbridge was {{a battle}} fought on 16 March 1322 between {{a group of}} rebellious barons and King Edward II of England, near Boroughbridge, north-west of York. The {{culmination}} of {{a long period of}} antagonism between the King and Thomas, Earl of Lancaster, his most powerful subject, it resulted in Lancaster's defeat and execution. This allowed Edward to re-establish royal authority, <b>and</b> <b>hold</b> <b>on</b> to power for another five years.|$|E
5|$|Thus, the 24th Infantry Division was {{the first}} American armed force sent to South Korea with the mission to blunt the advance of the North Korean Army and {{to set up a}} {{defensive}} perimeter around Pusan (the Pusan Perimeter) with the aid of Air Force, U.S. Navy, and Marine Corps aviation forces. The Supreme United Nations military commander in the area, General Douglas MacArthur, decided to have his American and South Korean troops to dig in around Pusan <b>and</b> <b>hold</b> <b>on</b> until he could assemble a powerful force (the American 10th Corps) to make an amphibious counterattack at Inchon on the northwestern coast of South Korea, near Seoul, later on in 1950. The 24th Infantry Division, along with its South Korean allies, was hence nearly alone for several weeks while the Americans and South Koreans held out inside the Pusan Perimeter and awaited reinforcements and counterattacks against the North Koreans.|$|E
5|$|Abelisaurids, {{especially}} Majungasaurus, may instead {{have been}} adapted for a feeding strategy {{more similar to}} modern felids, with short and broad snouts, that bite once <b>and</b> <b>hold</b> <b>on</b> until the prey is subdued. Majungasaurus had an even broader snout than other abelisaurids, {{and other aspects of}} its anatomy may also support the bite-and-hold hypothesis. The neck was strengthened, with robust vertebrae, interlocking ribs and ossified tendons, as well as reinforced muscle attachment sites on the vertebrae and the back of the skull. These muscles {{would have been able to}} hold the head steady despite the struggles of its prey. Abelisaurid skulls were also strengthened in many areas by bone mineralized out of the skin, creating the characteristic rough texture of the bones. This is particularly true of Majungasaurus, where the nasal bones were fused and thickened for strength. On the other hand, the lower jaw of Majungasaurus sported a large fenestra (opening) on each side, as seen in other ceratosaurs, as well as synovial joints between certain bones that allowed a high degree of flexibility in the lower jaw, although not to the extent seen in snakes. This may have been an adaptation to prevent the fracture of the lower jaw when holding onto a struggling prey animal. The front teeth of the upper jaw were more robust than the rest, to provide an anchor point for the bite, while the low crown height of Majungasaurus teeth prevented them from breaking off during a struggle. Finally, unlike the teeth of Allosaurus and most other theropods, which were curved on both the front and back, abelisaurids like Majungasaurus had teeth curved on the front edge but straighter on the back (cutting) edge. This structure may have served to prevent slicing, and instead holding the teeth in place when biting.|$|E

5|$|Although Sicily {{had been}} raided by the Muslims since the mid-7th century, these raids did not {{threaten}} Byzantine {{control over the}} island, which remained a largely peaceful backwater. The opportunity for the Aghlabid emirs of Ifriqiya came in 827, when {{the commander of the}} island's fleet, Euphemius, rose in revolt against the Byzantine Emperor Michael II. Defeated by loyalist forces and driven from the island, Euphemius sought the aid of the Aghlabids. The latter regarded this as an opportunity for expansion and for diverting the energies of their own fractious military establishment and alleviate the criticism of the Islamic scholars by championing jihad, and dispatched an army to aid him. Following the Arab landing on the island, Euphemius was quickly sidelined. An initial assault on the island's capital, Syracuse, failed, but the Muslims were able to weather the subsequent Byzantine counter-attack <b>and</b> <b>hold</b> <b>on</b> to a few fortresses. With the aid of reinforcements from Ifriqiya and al-Andalus, in 831 they took Palermo, which became the capital of the new Muslim province.|$|E
5|$|The match {{began as}} a scrappy affair, with plenty of {{challenges}} and little expansive football on show. The game's first notable chance went to Rooney, but Kolo Touré intervened and blocked his effort. Rooney then played in Giggs, whose shot was closed down by Sol Campbell. It took a while before Arsenal gained composure and played their usual passing game, and a move involving Edu and Fredrik Ljungberg in the 19th minute resulted in Rio Ferdinand carelessly tackling the latter. Ferdinand was not shown a card for his challenge – the first controversial decision referee Riley made during the match, which surprised Arsenal as the defender made a professional foul to prevent Ljungberg running clear on goal. Bergkamp exchanged passes with Reyes {{to open up the}} United defence, but the Dutchman's shot was saved by Roy Carroll. The United goalkeeper was on hand to save Henry's low shot three minutes before the break, after the striker was put through by Edu. During the first half action, both Neville brothers (Gary and Phil) were booked for fouling Reyes. Ashley Cole also received a yellow card for his tackle on Rooney. The Arsenal defender was {{on the receiving end of}} a challenge by Van Nistelrooy minutes after, as he attempted to shield the ball <b>and</b> <b>hold</b> <b>on</b> to possession. Television replays showed Van Nistelrooy ran his studs down Cole's shins, but the striker was not punished by Riley despite the action being in full view of his assistant at the touchline.|$|E
5|$|The net could ensnare the secutors {{weapon to}} disarm him and snag away his shield {{to put him}} at a {{significant}} disadvantage. Other retiarius tricks were to whip the net at his opponent's eyes to blind him and at his legs to trip him. The helmet of the secutor was smooth and round to avoid snagging the net. In most cases, the secutor knew to expect the net-man's tactics and tried to intercept <b>and</b> <b>hold</b> <b>on</b> to the weapon, possibly unsteadying his enemy by yanking on the net. In such danger, the retiarius could sever the drawstring from his wrist with his dagger. The secutor stood by a lost net and left little chance to recover it. Speculation surrounds {{the frequency with which}} the retiarius used his net. Extant imagery rarely shows gladiators of the type with a net, yet the class is named for the device, and Juvenal uses the net to quickly identify a retiarius in his satires. The discrepancy may simply be a case of artistic licence; other types of gladiator are often shown without their weapons but can be assumed to be holding them due to their stance, and a net is a particularly difficult weapon to depict. The lack of nets in retiarius images may show gladiators who have already lost the weapon in the fight. Another possibility is that some retiarii simply did not use nets.|$|E

Muhammad-Ali Abdur-Rahkman sat out the exhibition with an ankle injury. Michigan opened the season on November 11 against Howard, winning 76–58. Derrick Walton led the team in scoring with 20 points, including four three pointers, while D.J. Wilson led the team in rebounding with eight rebounds {{to go along with}} nine points playing in 20 minutes off the bench. Additionally, Rahkman returned from his ankle injury reclaiming his spot in the starting line-up. On November 13, Michigan defeated IUPUI, 77–65. Zak Irvin led the team in scoring with 15 points, as four Wolverines finished the game with double-digit points, while Wilson led the team in rebounds with 14, to go along with seven points and five blocks playing in 30 minutes off the bench. In the semifinal round of the 2016 2K Sports Classic held at Madison Square Garden on November 17, Michigan defeated Marquette 79–61 behind a team-high 16 points from Irvin and 4 other double digit scoring efforts, including D. J. Wilson's first career double-double (10 points and 12 rebounds). The following night, Michigan won the tournament by defeating SMU 76–54. Walton made seven three-point shots and scored 23, while Irvin added another 16 to earn tournament MVP. On November 23, Michigan suffered its first loss of the season to South Carolina, 46–61. Michigan was led by Walton with a team-high 15 points. Michigan scored 24 of its 46 points from the free throw line, shooting just 19 percent (10-for-52) from the field, including 2-for-26 from three-point range. On November 26, Michigan defeated Mount St. Mary's, 64–47. Michigan was led by Irvin with 14 points, as the Wolverines used a 25–4 run to turn a four-point deficit into a 17-point halftime lead. On November 30, Michigan lost to Virginia Tech 70–73 in the ACC–Big Ten Challenge. Michigan was led by Irvin with a game-high 23 points, as the Hokies rallied from a nine-point deficit at halftime to take their first lead of the game with 1:46 remaining <b>and</b> <b>hold</b> <b>on</b> to win.|$|E

25|$|On Selection Sunday, Gonzaga {{received}} a one {{seed in the}} 2013 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament {{for the first time}} in school history and was set to play Southern on March 21 at EnergySolutions Arena in Salt Lake City, Utah. The Jaguars previously played against the Bulldogs in an opening game for the 2010–11 season, where Gonzaga routed Southern 117–72. Despite being routed a couple of seasons before, the Jaguars were only behind 34–31 at halftime. Olynyk scored 17 of his 21 points in the second half to help Gonzaga pull ahead. Despite this, Southern managed to tie the game at 56 with 3:45 left, but Gary Bell, Jr. would hit a three-pointer to make it 59–56. On the ensuing possession, Southern guard Derick Beltran hit two free throws to cut the deficit to one. However, Kevin Pangos would respond with a three-pointer to put the Zags ahead by four. YonDarius Johnson and Malcolm Miller had open looks on the next possession, but neither was able to convert. Pangos finished with 16 points and hit two free throws with 14.3 seconds left to seal the victory for Gonzaga. The team managed to avoid the upset <b>and</b> <b>hold</b> <b>on</b> for the 64–58 victory to advance to the Round of 32.|$|E
25|$|In {{the late}} 1960s single-hose {{regulators}} {{started to take}} over as the standard, and this complicated the buddy breathing procedure. The single hose exhaust valve position {{at the bottom of}} most DVs made it necessary to offset the recipient to the right side when face to face, or to the left when side by side. The standard procedure of continuous exhalation during ascent to avoid lung over-pressure injury could leave the diver with insufficient air to clear the regulator, so it was necessary to hold the DV in a way that did not obstruct the recipient from accessing the purge button, as the single hose would not normally free flow when raised above the head. The increasing popularity of the buoyancy compensator was another complication, as it is necessary to periodically vent it during an ascent to avoid a runaway expansion of the contents and an uncontrolled buoyant ascent. This requires the use of one hand. the other is needed to control the regulator <b>and</b> <b>hold</b> <b>on</b> to the other diver, a moderately complex set of simultaneous tasks. It is possible to coordinate these activities, but this requires greater skill than with the original procedure, and therefore more intensive training to perform reliably. Since running out of air was becoming less common, the procedure was practiced less often, and skills generally deteriorated. The use of a secondary (octopus) second stage or a bailout cylinder removes the necessity for this complex and relatively stressful procedure.|$|E
