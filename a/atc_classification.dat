A layered reasoning approach is implemented where at the first layer ontological inference is used in order to discover underlying knowledge, while at the second layer a two-step rule selection strategy is followed resulting in a computationally efficient reasoning approach. Details of the system architecture are presented while also giving an outline of the difficulties that had to be overcome.

40|$|Abstract Background The {{worldwide}} {{increase in}} antibiotic resistant bacteria {{is of great}} concern. One of the main causes is antibiotic use {{which is likely to}} be high but is poorly described in India. The aim was to analyze and compare antibiotic prescribing for inpatients, in two private sector tertiary care hospitals; one Teaching and one Non-teaching, in Ujjain, India. Methods A cross-sectional study with manual data collection was carried out in 2008. Antibiotic prescribing was recorded for all inpatients throughout their hospital stay. Demographic profile of inpatients and prescribed antibiotics were compared. WHO Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical (<b>ATC)</b> <b>classifications</b> for antibiotics was used and Defined Daily Doses (DDD) were calculated per patient day. Results A total of 8385 inpatients were admitted during the study period. In the Teaching hospital (TH) 82 % of 3004 and in the Non-teaching hospital (NTH) 79 % of 5381 patients were prescribed antibiotics. The most commonly prescribed antibiotic groups were; fluoroquinolones and aminoglycosides in the TH and, 3 rd generation cephalosporins and combination of antibiotics in the NTH. Of the prescriptions, 51 % in the TH and 87 % in the NTH (p Conclusions The results from both hospitals show extensive antibiotic prescribing. High use of combinations of antibiotics in the NTH might indicate pressure from pharmaceutical companies.

Methods : The analysis included 760 regulated wholesale prices of medicines prescribed on outpatient prescription, which are partly or completely financed by public expenditures in the period 2003 – 2010. They are classified at the first level, i. e., anatomic main groups by <b>ATC</b> <b>classification.</b> The impact of price regulation on the patterns in wholesale price developments of medicines is estimated by the Lasyperes index and Wilcoxon signed rank test.

The NbN classifies psychopharmacological agents on the basis of contemporary scientific information on their pharmacology and mechanisms of action so as to provide physicians clear alternatives when selecting or altering therapeutic regimens. The classification of each psychotropic drug includes four additional dimensions: approved indications; efficacy and side effects; practical note; neurobiology.

The objective {{of the study was to}} investigate the prescription of anxiolytics and antidepressants among Slovenian family physicians, including patient demographics and possible time-trends.

Drugs included in the study were classified according to an Anatomical-Therapeutic-Chemical (<b>ATC)</b> drug <b>classification</b> system, and <b>ATC</b> data were used to calculate defined daily doses (DDD) per 1, 000 practice population per day. Descriptive analysis of anxiolytic/antidepressant ratio by patients’ age, gender and region of residency was performed. Results: Total amount of prescribed antidepressant drugs increased by 45 % during the observed 3 -year period, while total prescribing of anxiolytics decreased by 14 %, leading to the anxiolytics/antidepressants ratio diminishing from 1 to about 0. 5. The highest reduction in the ratio was observed in the northeast region, characterised by high social deprivation and one of the highest suicide rates in Europe. The highest prescribing of anxiolytics and antidepressants was observed in the central region around the capital Ljubljana.

40|$|Connectivity {{map data}} and {{associated}} methodologies {{have become a}} valuable tool in understanding drug mechanism of action (MOA) and discovering new indications for drugs. However, few systematic evaluations have been done to assess the accuracy of these methodologies. One of the difficulties has been the lack of benchmarking data sets. Iskar et al. (PLoS. Comput. Biol. 6, 2010) predicted the Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical (<b>ATC)</b> drug <b>classification</b> based on drug-induced gene expression profile similarity (DIPS), and quantified the accuracy of their method by computing the area under the curve (AUC) of the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve. We adopt the same data and extend the methodology, by using a simpler eXtreme cosine (XCos) method, and find it does better in this limited setting than the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) statistic. In fact, for partial AUC (a more relevant statistic for actual application to repositioning) XCos does 17 % better than the DIPS method (p= 1. 2 e- 7). We also observe that smaller gene signatures (with 100 probes) do better than larger ones (with 500 probes), and that DMSO controls from within the same batch obviate the need for mean centering. As expected there is heterogeneity in the prediction accuracy amongst the various ATC codes. We find that good transcriptional response to drug treatment appears necessary but not sufficient to achieve high AUCs. Certain ATC codes, such as those corresponding to corticosteroids, had much higher AUCs possibly due to strong transcriptional responses and consistency in MOA. 1...|$|R

40|$|Introduction: Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical (<b>ATC)</b> <b>classification</b> system classifies active {{ingredients}} of drugs {{according to the}} organ or system on which they act and their therapeutic, pharmacological, and chemical properties. Objective: To establish the five most frequently used drug groups and subgroups according to <b>ATC</b> <b>classification</b> system in patients on polypharmacy in relation to age and gender, and to establish the five most frequent combinations of drugs used by patients on polypharmacy. Method: In the period from 2008 until 2013, one EMS doctor surveyed his patients in the field regarding drugs they were using. In 688 patients on polypharmacy, we have analyzed the prevalence of drugs according to the ACT classification system. Results: Most frequently used drugs belonged to C, N, A, R and M group of <b>ATC</b> <b>classification.</b> Of statistical significance is that Female patients were more often using drugs for treatment of musculoskeletal diseases, anti-inflammatory and antirheumatic drugs and anxiolytics, whereas male patients were using predominantly drugs from R category and antiarrhythmics. Difference is statistically significant. Also statistically significant is that patients younger than 65 have more often used lipid-lowering drugs, antiepileptic, anxiolytics, antidepressants and drugs for treatment of respiratory diseases, whereas patient older than 65 have more often used drugs for treatment of cardiovascular diseases and vasodilatating drugs. Combination of drugs that act on cardiovascular, nervous and digestive system was {{the most frequently used}} combination. Conclusion: The most often used drugs belonged to C, N, A, R and MATC group, and the most frequent combination of drugs was the combination of drugs used for treatment of cardiovascular system, nervous and digestive system.

Subjects and methods: A retrospective observational study of ADRs was performed. Drugs causing ADRs were grouped according to the <b>ATC</b> drug <b>classification,</b> and subsequently entered into a database. Data were analyzed in respect of total number, gender, age, type, seriousness, expectedness, outcome, system organ class, suspected drug and reporter. Results: The findings showed that 15 % of all reported ADRs were caused by drugs from the ATC group N. 60 % of these were caused by drugs belonging to the ATC subgroups N 05 (psycholeptics) and N 06 A (antidepressants). A significant increase in the percentage of serious ADRs in the examined groups of medicinal products was observed. Analysis of expectedness showed that the share of unexpected ADRs is very high.
