H, <b>He,</b> <b>and</b> <b>Ca</b> II lines were observed simultaneously with both German telescopes on Tenerife. The visible lines from elements with different atomic weights yield thermal and nonthermal broadening parameters of 7500 ≤ Tkin ≤ 8000 K and 2. 5 <ξ< 5. 0 km/s for the cool prominence body. The EUV lines, however, show line widths which correspond to much higher temperatures and non-thermal velocities. If the calculated formation temperature for every individual ion is assumed, the observed line widths require non-thermal velocities of 14 - 25 km/s.

40|$|Our {{objective}} is to clarify the effects of acupuncture on hippocampal connectivity in patients with Alzheimer disease (AD) using {{functional magnetic resonance imaging}} (fMRI). Twenty-eight right-handed subjects (14 AD patients and 14 healthy elders) participated in this study. Clinical and neuropsychological examinations were performed on all subjects. MRI was performed using a SIEMENS verio 3 -Tesla scanner. The fMRI study used a single block experimental design. We first acquired baseline resting state data during the initial 3 minutes and then performed acupuncture stimulation on the Tai chong <b>and</b> <b>He</b> gu acupoints for 3 minutes. Last, we acquired fMRI data for another 10 minutes after the needle was withdrawn. The preprocessing and data analysis were performed using statistical parametric mapping (SPM 5) software. Two-sample t-tests were performed using data from the two groups in different states. We found that during the resting state, several frontal and temporal regions showed decreased hippocampal connectivity in AD patients relative to control subjects. During the resting state following acupuncture, AD patients showed increased connectivity in most of these hippocampus related regions compared to the first resting state. In conclusion, we investigated the effect of acupuncture on AD patients by combing fMRI and traditional acupuncture. Our fMRI study confirmed that acupuncture at Tai chong <b>and</b> <b>He</b> gu <b>ca...</b>|$|R

We solve the NLTE radiative transfer equations for all optically thick transitions. We present line ratios between infrared, optical and EUV lines, as well as line profiles.

40|$|Background: Ovarian cancer early {{detection}} markers CA 125, <b>CA</b> 15. 3, <b>HE</b> 4, <b>and</b> <b>CA</b> 72. 4 vary between healthy women, limiting their utility for screening. Methods: We evaluated cross-sectional relationships between lifestyle and reproductive factors and these markers among controls (n = 1910) from a nested case-control {{study in the}} European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC). Improvements in discrimination of prediction models adjusting for correlates of the markers were evaluated among postmenopausal women in the nested case-control study (n = 590 cases). Generalized linear models were used to calculate geometric means of CA 125, <b>CA</b> 15. 3, <b>and</b> <b>HE</b> 4. <b>CA</b> 72. 4 above vs. below limit of detection was evaluated using logistic regression. Early detection prediction was modeled using conditional logistic regression. Results: CA 125 concentrations were lower, and CA 15. 3 higher, in post- vs. premenopausal women (p ≤ 0. 02). Among postmenopausal women, CA 125 was higher among women with higher parity and older age at menopause (ptrend ≤ 0. 02), but lower among women reporting oophorectomy, hysterectomy, ever use of estrogen-only hormone therapy, or current smoking (p < 0. 01). CA 15. 3 concentrations were higher among heavier women and in former smokers (p ≤ 0. 03). HE 4 was higher with older age at blood collection and in current smokers, and inversely associated with OC use duration, parity, and older age at menopause (≤ 0. 02). No associations were observed with CA 72. 4. Adjusting for correlates of the markers in prediction models did not improve the discrimination. Conclusions: This study provides insights into sources of variation in ovarian cancer {{early detection}} markers in healthy women and informs about the utility of individualizing marker cutpoints based on epidemiologic factors...|$|R

40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the effect of}} stellar activity and flares on short-term radial velocity measurements in the mid-M flare star CN Leo. Radial velocity variations are calculated from 181 UVES spectra obtained during three nights. We searched for spectral orders that contain very few atmospheric absorption lines and calibrated them against the telluric A-band from O 2 in the Earth’s atmosphere. One giant flare occurred during our observations, which {{has a very strong}} effect on radial velocity. The apparent radial velocity shift due to the flare is several hundred m s − 1 and clearly correlated with Hα emission. Outside the flare, only spectral orders containing the most prominent emission lines of H, <b>He,</b> <b>and</b> <b>Ca</b> show a correlation to chromospheric activity together with a radial velocity jitter exceeding a few 10 m s − 1. We identify a number of spectral orders that are free of strong emission lines and show no flaring-related radial velocity jitter, although flares occurred as strong as 0. 4 dex in normalized Hα luminosity. The mean radial velocity jitter due to moderate flaring is less than 10 m s − 1. Strong flares are easily recognized directly in the spectra and should be neglected for planet searches...|$|R

As an artist, John Chandler Bancroft 2 ̆ 7 s application of scientific theories of color and light to his painting helped influence a generation of artists, including La Farge, Winslow Homer, and Thomas Eakins.
