Background: Treatment process for heavy metal and dye removal is a worrying factor in environmental health because it can contribute to the formation of new contaminants. Objectives: To obtain and use chitosan from Zygomycetes for removal process of heavy metal (cadmium) <b>and</b> <b>azodyes</b> (Reactive Black <b>and</b> Remazol Red). Methods: Chitosan was obtained by Rhizopus arrhizus UCP 402 and Mucor javanicus UCP 69 following the described method of Synowiecki and Al-Khateeb (1997) and submitted to removal tests for 18 h, with different concentrations of Cadmium (0. 5 - 4 mM), Reactive Black (B) and Remazol Red (1 - 1000 mg/L) in orbital shaker under 150 rpm at 28 °C. Then, the samples were submitted to spectrophotometry and chitosan exposed to the contaminants were submitted to electronic microscopy analysis. Results: The efficiency of cadmium removal by Rhizopus arrhizus chitosan showed data of 92 % (0. 5 mM) ...|$|R
40|$|Solid {{solution}} of BiOBr and BHO (BiO(OH) (0. 06) Br- 0. 94) with abundant oxygen vacancies was supported on Ag/AgBr using precipitation and deposition-precipitation methods. The photocatalyst showed high and stable photocatalytic activity for {{the degradation of}} chlorophenols <b>and</b> <b>azodyes</b> in water under visible to NIR light irradiation without any release of Ag+, which came from visible-excited AgBr and the SPR of Ag NPs in the:visible and NIR region. The different interfacial charge-transfer processes were verified {{on the basis of}} cyclic voltammetry analyses and all experimental information. The conduction band (CB) electrons of photoexcited AgBr reacted with the adsorbed oxygen forming O- 2 (center dot-), while the valence band (VB) holes of AgBr were transported the VB of BiO(OH) (0. 06) Br- 0. 94 to oxidize organic pollutants or H 2 O to (OH) -O-center dot. The plasmon-induced electrons from Ag NPs transferred to the CB of AgBr reacting with the adsorbed oxygen to O- 2 (center dot-), while the electrons trapped on the oxygen vacancies of BiO(OH) (0. 06) Br- 0. 94 transferred to Ag NPs recombining with the plasmon-induced holes, inhibiting the release of Ag+, and the resulted VB holes of BiO(OH) (0. 06) Br- 0. 94 oxidized organic compound. These interfacial charge transfers. evidenced the high photOactivity and photostability of BiO(OH) (0. 06) Br- 0. 94 /Ag/AgBr. (C) 2016 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|Growth and {{decolorization}} {{performance of}} bacterial grown on azodyes-containing-medium {{is influenced by}} various concentrations of carbon sources <b>and</b> <b>azodyes.</b> The optimum level of glucose and Orange II concentration for growth and Orange II decolorization by Enterococcus faecalis ID 6017 are reported in this paper. The experiments were carried out in liquid static culture as batch experiments. Glucose and Orange II concentrations used in these experiments were 0. 45, 0. 90, 1. 80 g l- 1, and 40, 80, 120 mg l- 1, respectively. The specific growth rate and decolorization rate of Orange II by E. faecalis were highest on the medium which contained at least 0. 90 g l- 1 glucose. It is necessary to note that glucose above 0. 90 g l- 1 gave no significant difference. On the medium containing 0. 90 g l- 1 glucose and 80 mg l- 1 Orange II, E. faecalis grew with the highest specific growth rate (0. 28 h- 1) and Orange II decolorization rate (0. 47 h- 1). The maximum specific growth rate of biomass (µ max) and the half-saturation coefficient (KS) under optimal conditions were 0. 25 h- 1 and 1. 5 g. l- 1, respectively. The kinetics of decolorization indicated that the process followed first order kinetics {{with respect to the}} initial concentration of Orange II. The inhibition constant (KI) was found to be 750 mg l- 1 Orange II, indicating that Orange II concentration at e ” 750 mg l- 1 would inhibit bacterial growth to decolorize Orange II...|$|R
40|$|Ag/AgBr/TiO 2 was {{prepared}} by the deposition-precipitation method and {{was found to be}} a novel visible light driven photocatalyst. The catalyst showed high efficiency for the degradation of nonbiodegradable <b>azodyes</b> <b>and</b> the killing of Escherichia coli under visible light irradiation (lambda > 420 nm). The catalyst activity was maintained effectively after successive cyclic experiments under UV or visible light irradiation without the destruction of AgBr. On the basis of the characterization of X-ray diffraction, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and Auger electron spectroscopy, the surface Ag species mainly exist as Ago in the structure of all samples before and after reaction, and Ag- 0 species scavenged h(VB) (+) and then trapped e(CB) (-) in the process of photocatalytic reaction, inhibiting the decomposition of AgBr. The studies of ESR and H 2 O 2 formation revealed that (OH) -O-center dot and O- 2 (center dot-) were formed in visible light irradiated aqueous Ag/AgBr/TiO 2 suspension, while there was no reactive oxygen species in the visible light irradiated Ag- 0 /TiO 2 system. The results indicate that AgBr is the main photoactive species for the destruction of <b>azodyes</b> <b>and</b> bacteria under visible light. In addition, the bactericidal efficiency and killing mechanism of Ag/AgBr/TiO 2 under visible light irradiation are illustrated and discussed...|$|R

40|$|Using {{a number}} of techniques, {{investigations}} {{have been carried out}} for forty-eight different systems of sample combinations according to varying components and different concentrations of pure Liquid crystals(LCs) Cholesteryl Pelargonate (CP) as well as Composite systems formed with polymer of metha methyl acrylate (PMMA-a clear plastic) in different proportions with azobenzene dye (Orange). The Phase Transition Temperatures (PTTs) were found using the Fabry-Perot Scattering Studies (FPSS). The textures and the PTTs of pure CP have been studied using the supplementary techniques of Differential Thermal Analysis (DTA) and Polarising Microscopy Studies (PMS). The absorption of the sample in the visible range was found using Ultra-Violet visible spectroscopy (UV-VIS). The infrared absorption was also studied using Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy. The results of the above investigations are being presented here. Addition of azobenzene dye to pure CP decreased its clearing temperature from 88 0 C to 62. 8 0 C. A comparative study between the systems, with <b>and</b> without <b>azodye,</b> showed that the addition of azobenzene dye brought about a change in the PMS textures indicating a change in the birefringence properties. Further, the clearing temperature also varied with different concentrations of PMMA in the mixture of CP + azodye; the clearing temperature was maximum (77. 5 0 C) for the sample which contains 80 %CP+ 20 %PMMA+ 1 % Azodye). Results of the UV/VIS analysis, FTIR analysis are also presented and discussed in this paper...|$|R

The azodyes formed with both 1 -napthol and resorcinol as coupling agents follow Lambert Beer’s law {{in the range of}} 0 to 10 µgmL- 1 of paracetamol. The molar absorptivity and Sandell’s sensitivity for azodye coupled with 1 -napthol were found to be 1. 68 × 10 4 Lmol- 1 cm- 1 and 9. 0 ngmL- 1 cm- 2, respectively. The molar absorptivity and Sandell’s sensitivity for azodye coupled with resorcinol were found to be 2. 86 × 10 4 Lmol- 1 cm- 1 and 5. 3 ngmL- 1 cm- 2, respectively. Both coupling agents had been applied successfully in the analysis of paracetamol in pharmaceutical preparation. The relative standard deviation for all five samples ranged from 2. 2 - 6. 4 % at 95 % confidence. The percentage recoveries were found to range from 97. 8 to 103. 4.

40|$|Copper-Containing azodirect dyes are {{described}} in numerous patents and their copper imparts special properties to the dyes. Dyes containing copper are in many cases faster than related dyes which do not contain it, and moreover, most of the former are substantive. Some of these azodyes have long {{been on the market}} as Chlorantine Fast colours of the Society of Chemieal Industry in Basle and are used extensively owing to their excellent properties. 　Although dyes of these types {{are described}} in the patent literature, little is generally known of their constitution and synthesis.

40|$|The {{development}} of processes to valorize the organic fraction of urban waste {{is a challenge}} that is increasingly attracting research groups {{from all over the}} world. At this purpose, in recent years is becoming of predominant importance the {{development of}} the so-called biorefinery. Here different processes for organic waste treatment are integrated in order to obtain, beside energy and bio-fuels, also added-value chemicals to be released on the market for specific applications or to be used as building blocks in further synthetic processes. In such context, from the compost obtained by aerobic treatment of the green fraction of urban wastes, soluble bio-based products (SBO) have been isolated. In previous studies SBO have shown promising performances in the formulation of detergents and textile dyeing baths, as emulsifiers, auxiliaries for soil/water remediation, flocculants, dispersants and binding agents for ceramics manufacture, in the synthesis of nanostructured materials for catalysis and for application in agriculture and animal husbandry. Investigation of the chemical nature of SBO has shown that they bear chemical similarities with humic substances (HS) naturally present in waters and soil. Particularly interesting at this regard is the fact that HS contain light-absorbing species capable of promoting photochemical transformation of organics of anthropogenic origin present in waters. Based on this similarity, in the present research SBO from green compost have been studied as photosensitizers for the degradation under simulated solar light of phenols, <b>azodyes</b> <b>and</b> aromatic sulphonic acids. Experiments have been designed in order to: i) gain further insight into the main reactive species involved in the SBO assisted photodegradation process; ii) optimize the photodegradation process at laboratory scale under simulated solar light; iii) verify the system detoxification. The abatement of all the studied target molecules was achieved and the photoproduction of singlet oxygen and OH radicals was hypothesized. Additional experiments were performed to verify the photostability of SBO themselves. A progressive decrease of both absorbance and fluorescence of SBO was observed upon irradiation; the obtained data suggested an increased SBO hydrophilicity and solubility. The development of SBO for water detoxification can therefore be attempted as a green process, taking organic urban waste as source of material for environmental applicatio...|$|R
