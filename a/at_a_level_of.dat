5|$|In 1989, NASA {{launched}} the Cosmic Background Explorer satellite (COBE), which made two major advances: in 1990, high-precision spectrum measurements {{showed that the}} CMB frequency spectrum is an almost perfect blackbody with no deviations <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>level</b> <b>of</b> 1 part in 104, and measured a residual temperature of 2.726K (more recent measurements have revised this figure down slightly to 2.7255K); then in 1992, further COBE measurements discovered tiny fluctuations (anisotropies) in the CMB temperature across the sky, <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>level</b> <b>of</b> about one part in 105. John C. Mather and George Smoot were awarded the 2006 Nobel Prize in Physics for their leadership in these results.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{widespread}} use of poliovirus vaccine in the mid-1950s, the incidence of poliomyelitis declined dramatically in many industrialized countries. A global effort to eradicate polio began in 1988, led by the World Health Organization, UNICEF, and The Rotary Foundation. These efforts have reduced the number of annual diagnosed cases by 99.9 percent; from an estimated 350,000 cases in 1988 to a low of 483 cases in 2001, after which it remained <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>level</b> <b>of</b> about 1,000 - 2000 cases per year for a number of years. In 2015, cases decreased to 98 and further decreased in 2016 to 37 wild cases and 5 circulating vaccine-derived cases.|$|E
5|$|Copper is an {{essential}} trace element in plants and animals, but not all microorganisms. The human body contains copper <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>level</b> <b>of</b> about 1.4 to 2.1mg per kg of body mass. Copper is absorbed in the gut, then transported to the liver bound to albumin. After processing in the liver, copper is distributed to other tissues in a second phase, which involves the protein ceruloplasmin, carrying the majority of copper in blood. Ceruloplasmin also carries the copper that is excreted in milk, and is particularly well-absorbed as a copper source. Copper in the body normally undergoes enterohepatic circulation (about 5mg a day, vs. about 1mg per day absorbed in the diet and excreted from the body), and the body is able to excrete some excess copper, if needed, via bile, which carries some copper out of the liver that is not then reabsorbed by the intestine.|$|E

25|$|Throughout the 1990s, {{plants were}} opened in many European countries, {{including}} the Czech Republic, Germany and Sweden.
