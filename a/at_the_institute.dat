5|$|In 1957, Burnet {{decided that}} {{research}} <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>Institute</b> {{should focus on}} immunology. Burnet reached the decision unilaterally, leaving many of the research staff disillusioned and feeling the action was arrogant; for Burnet's part he was comfortable with the decision as he thought it to be effective. Many virologists left the Institute and settled the Australian National University's John Curtin School of Medical Research. After 1957 all new staff and students <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>Institute</b> worked on immunological problems; Burnet was involved in work relating to autoimmune diseases and the graft-versus-host reaction, and increasingly in theoretical studies of immunology, immunological surveillance and cancer.|$|E

5|$|Although Braille was {{admired and}} {{respected}} by his pupils, his writing system was not taught <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>Institute</b> during his lifetime. The successors of Valentin Haüy, {{who had died}} in 1822, showed no interest in altering the established methods of the school, and indeed, they were actively hostile to its use. Dr. Alexandre François-René Pignier, headmaster at the school, was dismissed from his post after he had a history book translated into braille.|$|E
5|$|Braille {{read the}} Haüy books repeatedly, {{and he was}} equally {{attentive}} to the oral instruction offered by the school. He {{proved to be a}} highly proficient student and, after he had exhausted the school's curriculum, he was immediately asked to remain as a teacher's aide. By 1833, he was elevated to a full professorship. For {{much of the rest of}} his life, Braille stayed <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>Institute</b> where he taught history, geometry, and algebra.|$|E

5|$|In 1950, Ward's DSIR {{fellowship}} {{was coming}} to an end. Pryce had become a visiting professor <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>Institute</b> for Advanced Study in Princeton, New Jersey, and Ward's colleagues P. T. Matthews and Abdus Salam were visiting members there in the 1950–1951 academic year. Through them, he was able to secure a $3,000 membership for the 1951–1952 academic year. It was at Princeton that he was introduced to the Ising Model, and met Mark Kac from Cornell University, with whom he would collaborate on an exact solution of the Ising model using a combinatorial method. His joint work with Kac on the Ising Model gave rise to what is now being called the Kac-Ward operator. When his membership ended he worked for the Bell Laboratories in 1952 and 1953. He then accepted an offer of a lectureship at the University of Adelaide from Bert Green, where he worked for a year before taking up another membership <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>Institute</b> for Advanced Study.|$|E

5|$|In April 1940, {{early in}} the Second World War, Nazi Germany invaded and {{occupied}} Denmark.
