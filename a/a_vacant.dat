5|$|There is some {{controversy}} concerning the widely reported imbalance of the game, as the rules strongly favor the king, {{although there are}} several rule modifications that can produce more balanced play, such as a weaponless king (the king cannot participate in captures), escape to the corners (rather than to the edges), or hostile attacker camps (the king and defenders may be captured against <b>a</b> <b>vacant</b> attacker camp square). Schmittberger (1992) even reveals some workarounds to produce more balanced play without modifying the rules of gameplay.|$|E
