5|$|A {{powerful}} way {{of studying}} rings is through their modules. A module {{consists of a}} choice of ring, another set, usually distinct from the underlying set of the ring and called the underlying set of the module, an operation on pairs of elements of the underlying set of the module, and an operation which takes <b>an</b> <b>element</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ring and <b>an</b> <b>element</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> module and returns <b>an</b> <b>element</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> module. The underlying set of the module and its operation must form a group. A module is a ring-theoretic version of a group representation: Ignoring the second ring operation and the operation on pairs of module elements determines a group representation. The real utility of modules is that the kinds of modules that exist and their interactions, reveal {{the structure of the}} ring in ways that are not apparent from the ring itself. An important special case of this is an algebra. (The word algebra means both a subject within mathematics as well as an object studied in the subject of algebra.) An algebra consists of a choice of two rings and an operation which takes an element from each ring and returns <b>an</b> <b>element</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> second ring. This operation makes the second ring into a module over the first. Often the first ring is a field.|$|E
5|$|Groups are {{frequently}} studied through group representations. In their most general form, these {{consist of a}} choice of group, a set, and an action of the group on the set, that is, an operation which takes <b>an</b> <b>element</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> group and <b>an</b> <b>element</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> set and returns <b>an</b> <b>element</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> set. Most often, the set is a vector space, and the group represents symmetries of the vector space. For example, there is a group which represents the rigid rotations of space. This {{is a type of}} symmetry of space, because space itself does not change when it is rotated even though the positions of objects in it do. Noether used these sorts of symmetries in her work on invariants in physics.|$|E

5000|$|A {{function}} is injective (also called [...] "one-to-one") if each <b>element</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> range arises from <b>a</b> single <b>element</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> domain. In contrast, a {{function is}} single-valued if each <b>element</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> domain maps to <b>a</b> single <b>element</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> range.|$|R

5|$|As {{an iconic}} skill, bicycle kicks are an {{important}} part of association football culture. Executing a bicycle kick in a competitive football match, particularly in scoring a goal, usually garners wide attention in the sports media. The bicycle kick has been featured in works of art, such as sculptures, films, advertisements, and literature. The manoeuvre is also used in other similar ball sports, particularly in the variants of association football like futsal and beach soccer. The controversy over the move's invention and name in Brazil, Chile, and Peru (and its status as <b>an</b> <b>element</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> notable Chile–Peru football rivalry) has added to the kick's acclaim in popular culture.|$|E
5|$|In November 1952, Bolt {{transferred}} to squadron VMF-115, <b>an</b> <b>element</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 1st Marine Aircraft Wing flying F9F Panther fighter-bomber aircraft in South Korea. He flew 94 combat missions with the squadron, {{all of them}} in bombing runs and close air support and air strike missions against ground targets. He did not enjoy this duty, preferring instead to fly the Sabre in air-to-air combat. As his squadron headed to Japan for R, he traveled to Seoul to visit the 4th Fighter-Interceptor Wing at Kimpo Airfield.|$|E

5|$|The 173rd Infantry Brigade was {{constituted}} on 5 August 1917 as an infantry brigade {{and organized}} on 25 August at Camp Pike, Arkansas, as <b>an</b> <b>element</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 87th Division {{along with the}} 174th Infantry Brigade. The brigade deployed to France {{along with the rest}} of the division in September 1918, but it did not participate in any campaigns and never saw combat, instead being utilized as a pool of laborers and reinforcements for frontline units. Four months later, the brigade returned to the United States, and was demobilized with the rest of the division in January 1919 at Camp Dix, New Jersey.|$|E
5|$|The {{formation}} saw great {{changes in}} preparation for mobilization to fight during World War II. On 13 February 1942 the brigade structure was downsized greatly and converted into a reconnaissance element. It was combined with assets from the 190th Infantry Brigade to form the 95th Reconnaissance Troop which was subsequently assigned to the 95th Division once again. The troop was ordered into active military service on 15 July 1942 and reorganized at Camp Swift, Texas, as the 95th Cavalry Reconnaissance Troop, <b>an</b> <b>element</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 95th Division. The division itself {{was also in the}} process of being reorganized into the 95th Infantry Division.|$|E
5|$|For graphs G and H, the {{question}} of whether G has a homomorphism to H corresponds to a CSP instance with only one kind of constraint, as follows. The variables are the vertices of G and the domain for each variable is the vertex set of H. An evaluation is a function that assigns to each variable <b>an</b> <b>element</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> domain, so a function f from V(G) to V(H). Each edge or arc (u,v) of G then corresponds to the constraint ((u,v), E(H)). This is a constraint expressing that the evaluation should map the arc (u,v) to a pair (f(u),f(v)) that is in the relation E(H), that is, to an arc of H. A solution to the CSP is an evaluation that respects all constraints, so it is exactly a homomorphism from G to H.|$|E

5|$|One of {{the primary}} roles of the {{regiment}} {{is to provide a}} counter-terrorist capability, with <b>an</b> <b>element</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> SASR designated as the Tactical Assault Group (West) to respond to domestic incidents on the west coast of Australia and also for international operations. TAG (West) maintains a short-notice capability to conduct military operations beyond the scope of state/territory and federal Police Tactical Groups. Offensive counter-terrorist operations may include direct action and hostage recovery. A capability to board ships at anchor, ships underway and off-shore gas and oil platforms is also maintained. TAG (West) is kept at high readiness for a period of 12 months, before being replaced by another squadron in this role. The 2nd Commando Regiment provides Tactical Assault Group (East) to respond to domestic incidents on the east coast of Australia.|$|E
5|$|Recommendation #6: The roles, responsibilities, and {{authorities}} of local, state, and tribal governments (with respect to facility siting {{and other aspects}} of nuclear waste disposal) must be <b>an</b> <b>element</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> negotiation between {{the federal government and the}} other affected units of government in establishing a disposal facility. In addition to legally-binding agreements, as discussed in Recommendation #4, all affected levels of government (local, state, tribal, etc.) must have, at a minimum, a meaningful consultative role in all other important decisions. Additionally, states and tribes should retain—or where appropriate, be delegated—direct authority over aspects of regulation, permitting, and operations where oversight below the federal level can be exercised effectively and in a way that is helpful in protecting the interests and gaining the confidence of affected communities and citizens.|$|E
5|$|A counterattack {{developed}} on 8 October, composed of an infantry regiment, the 1st Assault Battalion, a battle {{group of the}} 108th Panzer Brigade, and some 40 armored fighting vehicles scavenged from available units. Although hindered by American artillery, the left wing of the attack managed to cut off an American platoon, while the right wing reached a road junction north {{of the town of}} Alsdorf. A platoon of Shermans supporting an attack on the town of Mariadorf suddenly found themselves being attacked from the rear, and were able to repel the Germans only after heavy fighting. Two German Sturmgeschütz IV self-propelled assault guns and a squad of infantry entered Alsdorf, where they were heavily counterattacked. Although the two lumbering vehicles somehow eluded American tanks, they were finally engaged by American infantry and forced back to their starting point. With casualties mounting and the Americans drawing closer, the German high command transferred the 3rd Panzergrenadier Division to Aachen, followed by the I SS Panzer Corps, which included the 116th Panzer Division and SS Heavy Panzer Battalion 101, <b>an</b> <b>element</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 1st SS Panzer Division.|$|E

5|$|On 15 February 1959, it was {{organized}} {{to consist of}} the 1st Battle Group, 65th Infantry, <b>an</b> <b>element</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 92nd Infantry Brigade. On February 21, 1960, commemorated as National Guard Day, the 65th Infantry Regiment was formally transferred from the Regular Army to the PRNG, in an activity where Gen. Cesár Cordero handed the units colors to Col. Rafael Rodríguez. That same year, Company B of the 65th Regiment created Employer's Day (Día del Patrono in Spanish) where the employer's of the volunteers that serve in the PRNG are instructed about the job that their employees do with the entity and participate in training of their own. The idea behind the initiative was facilitating the processing of the request of leave-of-absence to train for two weeks during the summer. On 1 May 1964, it was reorganized to consist of the 1st Battalion, 65th Infantry, and remained assigned to the 92nd. It was reorganized again on 1 April 1971, to consist of the 1st Battalion and the separate Company E. This was followed by another reorganization on 1 September 1978, to consist of the 1st and 2nd Battalions within the 92nd, {{as well as the}} separate Company E. Less than two years later another reorganization on 29 February 1980, eliminated the separate Company E while retaining the 1st and 2nd Battalions.|$|E
