5|$|Hindley's {{first job}} {{was as a}} junior clerk at a local {{electrical}} engineering firm. She ran errands, made tea, and typed.

Beginning at Christmas 1958, Hindley began a short relationship with Ronnie Sinclair, and became engaged at 17.

5|$|At Queen Square, the Morris {{family lived}} in a flat {{directly}} above the Firm's shop. They were joined by Janey's sister Bessie Burton {{and a number of}} household servants.

Taylor pulled the Firm's finances into order and spent much time controlling Morris and ensuring that he worked to schedule. During these years the Firm carried out a number of high-profile designs; from September 1866 to January 1867, they redecorated the Armoury and Tapestry Room in St. James' Palace, in the latter year also designing the Green Dining Room at the South Kensington Museum (it is now the Morris Room at the Victoria and Albert Museum). The Firm's work received increasing interest from people in the United States, resulting in Morris's acquaintance with Henry James and Charles Eliot Norton. However, despite its success, the Firm was not turning over a large net profit, and this, coupled with the decreasing value of Morris' stocks, meant that he had to decrease his spending.|$|E
