5|$|There is {{a complex}} of similar {{freshwater}} and estuarine Himantura in South Asia, Southeast Asia, and Australasia that are or were tentatively identified with H. polylepis. The Australian freshwater Himantura were described as a separate species, H. dalyensis, in 2008. The freshwater Himantura in New Guinea are probably H. dalyensis rather than H. polylepis, though confirmation awaits further study. Trygon fluviatilis from India, as described by Nelson Annandale in 1909, closely resembles and may be conspecific with H. polylepis. On the other hand, comparison of freshwater whipray DNA and amino acid sequences between India and Thailand has revealed significant differences. Finally, <b>additional</b> <b>research</b> <b>is</b> <b>needed</b> to assess the degree of divergence amongst populations of H. polylepis inhabiting various drainage basins across its distribution, so as to determine whether further taxonomic differentiation is warranted.|$|E
25|$|The {{data on the}} {{relationship}} between diet and prostate cancer is poor. In light of this the rate of prostate cancer is linked to the consumption of the Western diet. There is little if any evidence to support an association between trans fat, saturated fat and carbohydrate intake and risk of prostate cancer. Evidence regarding the role of omega-3 fatty acids in preventing prostate cancer does not suggest that they reduce the risk of prostate cancer, although <b>additional</b> <b>research</b> <b>is</b> <b>needed.</b> Vitamin supplements appear to have no effect and some may increase the risk. High calcium intake has been linked to advanced prostate cancer. Consuming fish may lower prostate cancer deaths but does not appear to affect its occurrence. Some evidence supports lower rates of prostate cancer with a vegetarian diet. There is some tentative evidence for foods containing lycopene and selenium. Diets rich in cruciferous vegetables, soy, beans and other legumes may be associated with a lower risk of prostate cancer, especially more advanced cancers.|$|E
25|$|Right {{hemisphere}} damage {{can lead}} to aprosodia—the inability to produce or comprehend emotional prosody of language. Emotional prosody is typically conveyed and interpreted through changes in pitch, rhythm, or loudness (Leon et al., 2005). Research thus far has focused primarily on motoric-imitative and cognitive-linguistic approaches to prosody treatment. In a motoric-imitative approach, the client imitates clinician-modeled sentences produced with target emotional prosody. Modeling and cueing is gradually reduced following a six-step hierarchy until the client reaches independent production. In the cognitive-linguistic approach, the client is prompted to produce sentences {{with the support of}} cue cards. Cues include the name of the target emotion, the vocal characteristics of the emotional tone, and a picture of a corresponding facial expression. Again, cues are gradually removed as the client progresses toward independent production. Clinical studies of small groups of participants (four participants; 14 participants.) revealed statistically significant gains in the production of emotional prosody following treatment. <b>Additional</b> <b>research</b> <b>is</b> <b>needed</b> to replicate the results of the limited studies that have been conducted thus far, to evaluate the efficacy of additional treatment approaches, and to compare the relative efficacy of different approaches.|$|E

For a long time, the neuroendocrine system {{and the distribution of}} hormones through the brain and their modulatory role and influence in behavior and mood have been studied. The most important changes associated with mood disorders concern the hypothalamic-pituitaryadrenal (HPA), the hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid (HPT), the hypothalamic-pituitary-GH (HPGH) and the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal (HPGn) axes. The intriguing data obtained from studies focusing on central neuropeptidergic circuits and peripheral hormone systems have been very useful in understanding the pathophysiology of mood disorders, although <b>additional</b> <b>researches</b> <b>are</b> <b>needed</b> to confirm these findings.

In particular, individuals with right hemisphere damage struggle with the skilled use of context to interpret and express ideas. A study of five participants with right hemisphere damage found that participants’ ability to orally interpret metaphors was statistically significantly improved following a five-week structured training intervention. The training program included five phases focused on facilitating the use of word meanings and semantic associations to increase participants’ understanding of metaphors. [...] Another study of three participants found that a contextual stimulation treatment increased participants’ ability to efficiently activate distantly associated meanings and to suppress contextually inappropriate meanings.

30|$|These basic {{questions}} regarding the seasonally varying influence of ENSO on Philippine climate arose during early stages of an IRI project in the region focused on improving water management practices for the Angat Resevoir in Luzon, which provides water for over 8 {{million people in the}} Metro Manila area. Since inflow to the reservoir can be substantially affected by the state of ENSO, better management of water within the reservoir system relied fundamentally on a better understanding how inflows to the system varied {{over the course of the}} year, particularly when an ENSO event was underway. Working with climate data provided by the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration (PAGASA) and in collaboration with some of their climate scientists, a study addressing these topics was undertaken. Previous work had provided some hints that the influence of ENSO on boreal summer rainfall in the Philippines might be different from that during the boreal fall and winter (Walker & Bliss 1932; Kiladis & Diaz 1989; Kripalani & Kulkarni 1997) but <b>additional</b> <b>research</b> <b>was</b> <b>needed</b> to provide a more definitive answer.|$|R

In the limited third grade research, teacher-mediated explicit instruction with multiple exemplars, teaching students to use visual representations, and the incorporation of self-strategies, have proven effective.

Results suggest that self-monitoring has relevance for understanding many organizational concerns, including job performance and leadership emergence.
