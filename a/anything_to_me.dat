I was caught out {{like a lot of}} artists were, with record companies figuring out how to do single releases these days. I remember doing a promo for one of the last singles and it just felt really old-fashioned. I'm pretty computer-savvy, something didn't feel right, but no one said <b>anything</b> <b>to</b> <b>me.</b> You get Britney releasing [...] "Hold It Against Me" [...] and Gaga's [...] "Born This Way" [...] available on iTunes the day you hear it first. That's how it should be. And there's me waiting for a mid-week chart figure like it's 1989." ...|$|E
500|$|The Canadian {{government}} declined Mitsui's {{offer of}} military service. [...] A series of Orders in Council in 1942 deprived Canadians of Japanese descent {{of their property}} and rights, culminating in Japanese-Canadian internment {{for the duration of}} the war. [...] The government confiscated the Mitsui family's 17-acre property and poultry facilities in Coquitlam and sold it off, compensating the family with an estimated one-third of its total value. [...] The RCMP took Mitsui and his daughter Lucy to Hastings Park for registration as an enemy alien. [...] Mitsui wore his military medals and when the registering official asked him, [...] "What can I do for you, Sarge?", Mitsui responded, [...] "What are you doing to me? I served my country. [...] You've taken everything away from me.... What are the good of my medals?" [...] He scattered his medals on the floor and table, and refused to wear them thereafter when they were returned to him. [...] He and his family were detained in a facility in Greenwood, British Columbia. [...] Mitsui later stated, [...] "I had complete confidence in the government that they wouldn't be doing <b>anything</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> because of being a veteran." [...] All the family could later retrieve was a samurai sword Mitsui's son George had buried.|$|E

2500|$|Rhythm guitarist Gilby Clarke, {{who does}} not appear on the {{recording}}, noted that the recording foreshadowed his departure from the band, stating: [...] "They did that while I {{was on the road}} touring for my solo record. [...] I knew that that was the ending because nobody told me about it. Officially I was in the band at that time, and they did that song without me. That {{was one of the last}} straws for me, because nobody had said <b>anything</b> <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> and they recorded a song by one of my favorite bands. It was pretty clear I'm a big Rolling Stones fan, and they recorded the song without me. So I knew that was it." ...|$|E
2500|$|Nevertheless, the West Indies won {{the match}} and {{levelled}} the series. In the decider in Jamaica, Waugh took 2/14 in the West Indies' first innings of 265 and then {{arrived at the}} crease with Australia at 73 for three in reply. [...] He compiled a long partnership of 231 runs with his brother Mark, who was eventually out for 126. [...] Waugh was the last man to go, out for 200 after nine hours of batting. [...] "Steve had {{made up his mind}} to bat and bat", wrote Paul Reiffel, [...] "to stay out there and anchor the proceedings. [...] e copped a lot of blows on his arms, chest and ribs. When he came back to the dressing room at the end of day two, we could see the spots and bruises on his body [...] I remember when I walked in [...] he didn't say <b>anything</b> <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> but then he didn't need to. We all pretty much knew that we just had to support him." ...|$|E
2500|$|Arthur C. Parker, Secretary of the Society of American Indians from 1911 to 1915, {{regarded}} McKenzie as the [...] "father of the movement." [...] McKenzie {{respected the}} Society's mantra of [...] "for Indians and by Indians" [...] and understood Indians' distrust of Whites. McKenzie downplayed {{his role as}} [...] "Local Representative" [...] for the Society and worked behind the scenes. He wrote to Parker, [...] "Whatever I may say is subject to two suspicions: First that my race prevents me understanding the situation. Second, that I may have some ulterior motive." [...] "I am always embarrassed by {{doubt in my mind}} as to whether I shall act and speak, or whether I shall contribute most by silence. Everyone who says <b>anything</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> tells me to proceed and that the Indians have confidence in me and I am glad and believe that is so, even though doubtful as to what extent that confidence involves action." [...] While Parker was determined that the Society should be run by Indians, it did not diminish his desire for McKenzie's counsel and assistance in managing the organization. In short time, Parker was overwhelmed with the volume of Society work and contemplated resigning. McKenzie exhorted him to stay with the Society, noting [...] "it is not impossible that you are the only man who can save the situation and that you may have to do it by constant correspondence, keeping all in touch one with the other, and keeping all satisfied that equal justice is being arranged for." [...] Parker teamed with McKenzie to manage the Society and navigate politics. Responsibilities included publications, planning conferences, drafting and lobbying legislation and membership services.|$|E

2500|$|Described by Gomez as [...] "a {{beautiful}} {{start to}} the album", [...] "Good for You" [...] was the third song she received since signing with her new label Interscope Records, as well the second track to be recorded for the album. It was uninterruptedly recorded in 45 minutes at Interscope Studios in Santa Monica, California; during the process, Gomez's vocals featured cracks as the song [...] "took on this emotion [...] didn't realize [...] could tap into", and {{at the beginning of}} the session she was exhausted from pressurizing herself for a sound and concept for the album. According to her, this recording had no beat and was [...] "just a skeleton of a song". There was also no specific sound planned for the song at the time although it was suggested that its soft melodies be made more pop-indebted which Gomez disagreed with, believing it would take away from her vocal. She was entirely involved in the song's creative direction, providing additional songwriting, and helped to develop it to represent her process of self-realization, her confidence as a young woman, and feelings of vulnerability. The song also formed part of a process in which she wanted to portray her story as an artist and as part of a transitional album over which she would take full control. In an interview for MTV, she said this was her time [...] "to embrace who I am, and I'm not going to sit down in a chair and talk about something that doesn't mean <b>anything</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> anymore" [...] and spoke about her involvement in the track: [...] "This is the most I've been creatively involved from the writing process ... every single thing I'm even remotely singing about is something I've related to and something I'm hitting the nail on, and I had to pick what was going to represent the album and who I am as a whole".|$|E
2500|$|... “There were a {{great many}} cowboys with the show. [...] There was a chief of the cowboys who had general {{supervision}} over both horses and men. [...] When an unbroken horse would be brought in, this cowboy chief would give it to an Indian to ride bareback. [...] After the animal was well broken, it would {{be taken away from}} the Indian and given to a cowboy to ride. [...] Then the Indian would be given another unbroken horse. [...] For a while we said nothing about it, but finally it began to be just a little too much to stand. [...] One day one of the Indians came to me just before it was time to enter the arena. [...] His horse was saddled and bridled, but he was leading the horse by the bridle. [...] I asked him what was the matter, and {{he said it was a}} wild horse and he was not going to ride it into the arena. [...] I went to the chief cowboy and said, ‘I do not think you are doing right. [...] You know our Indian boys have to ride bareback, but you always give them the wild horses to ride. [...] Then, when they have the horse nicely broken, you give to a cowboy. [...] Why don’t you give the wild horses to the cowboys to break in? [...] They ride on saddles, and it would not be so hard for them.’ [...] But the chief cowboy only said, “Well, I can’t be bothered by a little thing like that. [...] You will have to see Buffalo Bill about the horses.’ [...] But I retorted, “You know very well that Buffalo Bill does not know what you do with the horses. [...] He does not know that you give the wild ones to the Indian boys to ride until they are broken in. [...] Give that horse back to that Indian boy or he will not go into the arena today.’ [...] That was all, but the boy got his horse in time to enter the arena with the others. [...] Just as I was ready to go back to the Indians, I looked at Buffalo Bill, and he had a twinkle in his eye. [...] After that, we had no more trouble with the horses. [...] Although Buffalo Bill never said <b>anything</b> <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> I knew he had fixed things to our satisfaction.” ...|$|E
