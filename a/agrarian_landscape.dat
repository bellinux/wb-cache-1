40|$|This {{special issue}} {{integrates}} eleven papers focussing on indicators able {{to convey the}} multiple expectations that society has concerning agricultural land. As scale issues have been so far overlooked within this research topic, a particular focus of this themed issue is to highlight the need for reconciling assessments across scales. The shared purpose of the contributions is to examine how the multiple societal expectations concerning <b>agrarian</b> <b>landscapes</b> might be incorporated into land use policy at different governance levels. A core set of these papers were presented in the symposium “Linking social indicators across scales”, to the European Congress of the International Association of Landscape Ecology (IALE) in September 2013 in Manchester, UK. This symposium was organized to create the time and space for a discussion {{on the issues of}} scale when capturing societal preferences concerning <b>agrarian</b> <b>landscapes.</b> While the landscape scale was specifically addressed by four papers, seven papers examined broader geographic units in addition to up-scaling and downscaling issues...|$|R
40|$|Abandonment and {{conversion}} of cultural <b>agrarian</b> <b>landscapes</b> are major drivers behind {{the loss of}} ecosystem services in Europe. One incentive for land-use conversion is the higher (private) economic return from industrial mono-functional crops relative to traditional multi-functional ones. However, {{conversion of}} cultural <b>agrarian</b> <b>landscapes</b> can involve high direct and indirect costs to society through the loss of ecosystem services. Using {{as a case study}} the traditional vineyards surrounding the Doñana National Park, South-West Spain, this research has three objectives: i) to measure soil erosion impacts from the conversion of traditional vineyards in biophysical and economic terms, (ii) to identify drivers of change behind the loss of traditional vineyards, and iii) to assess the applicability of economic instruments to protect traditional vineyards. Our results suggest that uprooting of traditional vineyards is an important driver behind the siltation of the marsh in the Doñana National Park, which in turns involve socio-environmental costs in terms of loss of ecosystem services and cultural values. Subsidy reform to reward management practices that sustain ecosystem services and eco-labelling of vine-derived products are pointed at as promising economic instruments to slow down or reverse abandonment or conversion of traditional vineyards. </p...|$|R

40|$|Stated {{preference}} {{studies are}} increasingly employed {{to estimate the}} value of attributes of European <b>agrarian</b> <b>landscapes</b> and changes therein. Despite the vast amount of case studies, preferences for landscape attributes are context specific, which inhibits cross-case comparison and up-scaling. In this study, we address this problem by applying a meta-analysis of stated preference studies that focus on attributes of European <b>agrarian</b> <b>landscapes</b> (n = 345). The main objective {{of this study is}} to identify generic preferences for particular types of landscape attributes across case studies. In addition, landscape context variables that explain preference heterogeneity between different cases that address similar landscape attributes are identified. We find that landscape attributes that describe mosaic land cover, historic buildings or the presence of livestock generally receive the highest stated preferences across cases. Furthermore, we find relations between preferences for particular attributes and context variables – such as population density and GDP per capita – using a meta-regression analysis. The results of the present study provide the first cross-disciplinary and cross-case evidence on relations between preferences for landscape attributes and socio-economic and landscape context conditions. The study is a first step toward up-scaling of landscape preferences and the development social landscape indicators that reflect the perceived value of landscapes at regional and pan-regional scales, which is increasingly important as landscape policies are progressively implemented at European level...|$|R
30|$|Periurban areasa are dynamic spaces with blurred boundaries, highly {{influenced}} by urban interactions. They share qualities both with {{urban and rural}} areas, serving as an interface between them (Bryant, [1995]; Darly and Torre, [2013]).

40|$|This article aims {{to explore}} {{some of the}} wealth of {{evidence}} for the diversity of <b>agrarian</b> <b>landscapes</b> in Roman Italy.

In particular, it explores several aspects of Horden and Purcell's Corrupting Sea (2000) and relates these to the archaeological evidence. Horden and Purcell question three concepts of Mediterranean agriculture – subsistence (autarky), self-determination (social independence) and immemorial stability (successful resistance to change). This paper relates these arguments to the archaeological record, particularly the results of recent field survey in the form of land division, settlement classification and the exchange and consumption of material culture...|$|R

40|$|This article {{highlights}} how “place-based education” {{can be used}} {{to raise}} awareness about sustainability and potentially influence design process decisions that have environmental and cultural implications. “Place-based education” is a term used to describe an educational worldview based on development of curriculum centered on the local, social, economic, and ecological resources of a community. The study shows results of Masters Students’ research on situating a housing complex {{in the context of the}} <b>agrarian</b> <b>landscape</b> of Vojvodina, Serbia, considering it as a resource for a new sustainable urban lifestyle. During the first year of Masters Studies at the Faculty of Architecture, Belgrade University, an architectural design studio with 15 students had the task of exploring the potential of expanding the city of Belgrade across the <b>agrarian</b> <b>landscape,</b> as to affirm the role of place in contemporary everyday life. Students were expected to explore the possibilities and limitations of the relationship between man and <b>agrarian</b> <b>landscape</b> via architecture, re-thinking how various architectural design approaches could balance and harmonize the impact of the built environment on the <b>agrarian</b> <b>landscape.</b> The paper shows that “place-based education” possesses elements necessary for the inclusion of a wider spatial-cultural context in the process of architectural design and prioritization of environmental literacy and responsibility, as one of the main components of sustainable development...|$|E

But invariability analysis has been limited to the specificities of policies and to what extent they have provided forest produce benefits or not to forest-dependent communities. Public policies around forests must be contextualized and analysed in abroader historical context that attempts to understand what 'forests" mean to local communities in their segmented forms and how such policies have been part of a wider process of transformation of the <b>agrarian</b> <b>landscape.</b> This paper based on on-going research in three states of the Western Ghats of South India examines the historical transformation of the <b>agrarian</b> <b>landscape</b> and how recent public policies in the name of decentralization often fall short not only in their implementation but also in their vision. Hence, while decentralized forest management might open up spaces for communities to adress some of their forest needs in particular contexts, they are as likely to marginalize other needs in the process of redefining the <b>agrarian</b> <b>landscape</b> in the name of environemental management...|$|E

Differences in the views upon rural development is reflected in differences in the ways of thinking of landscapes. Is the open, and actively cultivated, landscape the ideal for all? Who is to decide what needs or ought to be done to achieve certain desired values and/or goals – and who pays for it? The one thing that is, and should be, clear from the beginning is that all development, whether positive or negative in an area, bears consequences for the landscape. What shapes the development of the rural areas is to have – or should have – remains to be seen, but regardless form or shape it will effect the <b>agrarian</b> <b>landscape...</b>|$|E

40|$|Rural {{communities}} in the United States have faced mounting pressure to develop their local economies in ways that threaten their historic <b>agrarian</b> <b>landscapes</b> and cultural practices. However, these communities are often wary of, if not hostile to, top–down approaches to historic preservation and landscape conservation. Community-engaged heritage protection strategies shift the focus from managing cultural and natural heritage as discrete resources to envisioning heritage and its protection {{as a form of}} community development. This paper presents a case study from rural New England in which the intergenerational sharing of narratives about heritage landscapes moves beyond simply commemorating the past, to contributing to the present and future welfare of community members. In this case, heritage narratives shed light on residents’ changed relationships toward their land and each other, while also revitalizing a sense of a collective past and, more importantly, a shared future...|$|R

While disturbance and turmoil are already {{a part of the}} natural landscape in Vergil’s Eclogues and Georgics, in epic, a genre that concerns itself with how empire and imperial power mediate Roman identity, the displacement of shepherds and agriculture partially redefines Roman identity in militaristic terms. Vergil’s pastoral characters, written into military roles as civic <b>landscapes</b> displace <b>agrarian</b> ones in the Aeneid, survive but fail to find a place in Lucan’s ruined and desolate Pharsalian landscape in the Bellum Civile.
