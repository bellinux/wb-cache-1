The total depletion width {{in this case is}} the sum [...]A full derivation for the depletion width is presented in reference. This derivation is based on solving the Poisson equation in one dimension - the dimension normal to the metallurgical junction. The electric field is zero outside of the depletion width (seen in above figure) and therefore Gauss’s law implies that the charge density in each region balance - as shown by the first equation in this sub-section. Treating each region separately and substituting the charge density for each region into the Poisson equation eventually leads to a result for the depletion width. This result for the depletion width is: ...|$|E
50|$|As {{a result}} of this step in band edges, a {{depletion}} region near the junction becomes depleted of both holes and electrons, forming an insulating region with almost no mobile charges. There are, however, fixed, immobile charges due to dopant ions. The near absence of mobile charge in the depletion layer means that the mobile charges present are insufficient to balance the immobile charge contributed by the dopant ions: a negative charge on the p-type side due to acceptor dopant and as a positive charge on the n-type side due to donor dopant. Because of this charge there is an electric field in this region, as determined by Poisson's equation. The width of the depletion region adjusts so the negative <b>acceptor</b> <b>charge</b> on the p-side exactly balances the positive donor charge on the n-side, so there is no electric field outside the depletion region on either side.|$|E

5000|$|In the {{semiconductor}} at the smaller voltage {{shown in the}} top panel, the positive charge placed on the left face of the insulator lowers {{the energy of the}} valence band edge. Consequently, these states are fully occupied out to a so-called depletion depth where the bulk occupancy reestablishes itself because the field cannot penetrate further. Because the valence band levels near the surface are fully occupied due to the lowering of these levels, only the immobile negative acceptor-ion charges are present near the surface, which becomes an electrically insulating region without holes (the depletion layer). Thus, field penetration is arrested when the exposed negative <b>acceptor</b> ion <b>charge</b> balances the positive charge placed on the insulator surface: the depletion layer adjusts its depth enough to make the net negative <b>acceptor</b> ion <b>charge</b> balance the positive charge on the gate.|$|R

A quantum-mechanical molecular dynamics simulation incorporating nonadiabatic electronic transitions reveals that a dissociated charge state (D+ and A-) in the O-doped system is more stable than the pristine case due to the presence of an effective barrier by the TEG HOMO/LUMO level. We also find that oxygen doping in HBC enhances the intermolecular carrier mobility after charge separation.

The shock properties are obtained from the free surface velocity by making use of a velocity interferometer system for any reflector (VISAR). Analytical models for plasma generation in a confined geometry and for evolution and decay of shock waves during the propagation are considered.

The movement of protons is verified by an unusual D 2 O isotope effect that increases the negative ionic current by 2 - to 3 -fold. These effects suggest that an interfacial pK shift of the weak acid caused by the local electric field of photoformed porphyrin cations/acceptor anions functions as the driving force.

40|$|A fully {{automated}} Temperature Dependent Hall (TDH) measurement setup has been assembled {{for the purposes}} of this study. This TDH setup is capable of measuring samples in the 20 K to 370 K temperature range. Sample sizes of up to 20 mm × 20 mm can be accommodated by the custom designed and manufactured sample holder. Samples with a resistance in the 1 Ω to 250 MΩ range can be measured with this setup provided that the mobility of the sample is greater than 1 cm²/Vs. The computer program controlling the automated measurement processwas written in LabView™ version 6. 1. Single crystal Zinc Oxide (ZnO) was the material under investigation in this study. Bulk ZnO samples grown by three different methods, namely pressurized melt growth, seeded chemical vapor transport (SCVT) growth and hydrothermal growth, were measured in the 20 K to 370 K range. The effect of annealing in argon atmosphere in the 550 ºC to 930 ºC range was investigated on all three ZnO types. In addition, hydrogen-implanted layers on semi-insulating hydrothermally grown ZnO were studied. These samples were annealed in the 200 ºC to 400 ºC range and Hall measurements in the 20 K to 330 K range were performed. Programs were written to fit, wherever possible, the obtained temperature dependent carrier concentration and mobility profiles to suitable theoretical models. The carrier concentration data was fitted to a multi-donor single <b>acceptor</b> <b>charge</b> balance equation for the purpose of extracting donor concentrations and activation energies. Before fitting, the data was corrected for the Hall scattering factor and, where necessary, for two-layer effects particularly a degenerate surface conduction channel that developed through annealing on the SCVT-grown and hydrothermally grown samples. The acceptor concentrations of the samples were obtained by fitting the mobility data to a model based on D. L. Rode’s method of solving the Boltzmann transport equation. Scattering mechanisms included in the model were piezoelectric and deformation potential acoustic modes, polar optic modes and ionized impurity scattering. It was found that the mobility data did not fit the model very well without assigning questionable values to other parameters, in this case the deformation potential. Plausible values for the acceptor concentration were however obtained. The carrier concentration data fitted the model well, but due to the large number of parameters to be extracted (up to six parameters in the case of three donors) there was often not much certainty in the extracted values This study shows that TDH analysis is a valuable tool to assess the quality of semiconductors. Bulk and degenerate surface (or interfacial) conduction are separated with relative ease, and shallow defect concentrations as well as compensation level concentrations could be extracted. The generally observed uncertainty in values obtained in the multi-parameter regression of carrier concentration data indicates that supplementary techniques such as photoluminescence are needed to support results obtained by the TDH technique.

40|$|The {{subject of}} this thesis, as {{apparent}} from its title, is a detailed study of the isoalloxazine molecule {{by a variety of}} techniques belonging to the field of optical spectroscopy. After a brief introduction to the subject in general terms, together with some historical background and citation of relevant review papers which appeared before 1979 (Chapter 1), a general outline of experimental techniques and theoretical methods used is given (Chapter 2). More detailed information about specific experiments or calculations is provided in the experimental sections of the individual chapters. Chapters 3 and 4 describe the continuous wave and time-resolved spectral properties of (iso) alloxazines determined under experimental conditions, in which external perturbation of the molecules of interest is minimized as much as possible. This could be achieved by measurements in apolar solvents (Chapter 3) and in the vapour phase (Chapter 4), a state of aggregation in which the molecule could be brought with some experimental skill. Thus, a large temperature range (77 to 520 K) could be employed. In solution at 77 and 300 K (Chapter 3), the spectra revealed a 1250 cm - 1 vibrational progression in all isoalloxazines investigated (probably a stretching mode); actual lifetimes of 5 - 10 ns for fluorescence and ~ 300 ms for phosphorescence (77 K, no phosphorescence could be detected in fluid solution) were observed; the ratio of the actual and radiative lifetimes of the electronically first excited singlet state agreed very well with an independent quantum yield determination and solvent interactions were found to affect primarily the Franck-Condon envelopes of the spectra and not the electronic transition energies. The non-radiative decay of isoalloxazine, on the other hand, is strongly dependent on the molecule's environment. An anomalously large Stokes-loss in fluid and glassy solution is indicative of a conformational change of the molecule occurring upon electronic excitation. In alkane solution at 77 K, isoalloxazines form clusters exhibiting P-type (triplet-triplet annihilation process) delayed fluorescence. Vapour phase spectra (Chapter 4), although less structured than solution spectra owing to sequence congestion, provided primary information on isolated (iso) alloxazines when comparison with spectra obtained in condensed media was made. Fluorescence lifetimes range from &lt; 0. 5 ns for alloxazine to 1 - 18 ns for isoalloxazine vapour. The data indicate possible intramolecular complex formation between the isoalloxazine ring system and its own aliphatic side-chain carrying a (polar) hydroxyl group. Direct photodissociation of isoalloxazine in the electronically first excited singlet state is not a probable process in the vapour phase. Chapter 5 describes the continuation of (iso) alloxazine vapour phase experiments by the application of ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy. Both He(I) and He(II) excitation was used. The spectra are interpreted using various methyl substituted isoalloxazines and by comparison with the results obtained from CNDO/S calculations and photoionization cross- sections derived therefrom. The dependence of the electronic properties of isoalloxazines on the redox state and the degree of substitution is analyzed. A critical review of the data obtained from semiempirical MO calculations by various other authors and the CNDO/S results shows that a few methods give a fairly good prediction of the πorbital energies only. Without exception, the calculated σorbital energies contain considerable error. Particularly, all theoretical methods fail to predict a threefold degeneracy in the orbital level scheme at ~- 9. 6 eV, in which both πand σorbitals are involved. Possible reasons for the failures are discussed. Analysis of the experimental and theoretical results reveals a planar molecular conformation to be the most probable me for an isolated reduced isoalloxazine molecule in the vapour phase, contrary to the bent conformation which is encountered in solution or the solid state. Bending is, therefore, most likely caused by interaction of the molecule with its environment. Such interactions, leading to changes in orbital energies, may in part be responsible for the ability of the protein-bound flavocoenzyme to be involved in a broad diversity of biological reactions. In chapter 6, all foregoing data are put together in a combined analysis to establish relationships between the photoelectron and ordinary optical spectra. First, additional photoelectron spectra of 10 -hydroxyalkyl-isoalloxazines confirmed the existence of the intramolecular complex proposed on the basis of vapour phase fluorescence lifetimes (vide supra). The hydrogen-bond between the side-chain OH group and the N 1 imine-like nitrogen atom (cf. Scheme 1. 1, p. 1) leads to a destabilization of the lone pair on the latter atom, contrary to common experience. This anomalous behaviour can be ascribed to rearrangement of existing through- bond interactions in the free isoalloxazine molecule. Results from CNDO/S and INDO/S calculations agree reasonably with the observations. Secondly these findings have considerable impact on the interpretation of existing and in this thesis presented optical spectra. The new photoelectron spectroscopic data lead, in combination with optical spectra, to the assignment of the isoalloxazine S 2 to a mixed state containing (anomalous) ny* character arising from the anomalous behaviour of the N 1 lone pair (cf. Scheme 1. 1, p. 1). The oscillator strength of theS 0 ->S 2 π-> π* component is very sensitive to external perturbation. Finally, the possible implications for biochemical catalysis by flavins are discussed. Chapter 7 describes a thorough investigation of Old Yellow Enzyme (OYE), a (flavo) protein containing the isoalloxazine derivative flavin mononucleotide (M). It is attempted to interpret the spectral properties of this protein in terms of intermolecular interactions between its constituents, using the knowledge and experience acquired in the preceeding research. The results demonstrate the inadequacy of the existing explanation of the phenomena occurring upon the addition of phenols to OYE, based on the formation of a simple phenolate -FMN donor- <b>acceptor</b> <b>charge</b> transfer complex. Instead,it was found that the phenolate anion interferes strongly with an existing tight complex between FMN and the apoprotein, probably a H-bonded structure in which FMN is tautomerized and interacts with a L-chiral center. This is concluded from a separate electronic transition with an origin at 496 m, thus far not recognized as such, and the circular dichroism observed. The emission of OYE is dominated by that of free FMN, although protein-bound FMN seems also to become luminescent in glassy solution at 143 K. A second fluorescence/phosphorescence emission appears upon UV-excitation of both native and complexed OYE. This emission is quenched by the addition of phenol to OYE, shows a large (3000 cm - 1 ) blue shift on going to a low temperature glass and is tentatively assigned to excimers of nucleic acids. Long-wavelength excitation with a synchronously pumped, mode-locked Rhodamine 6 G dye laser revealed a third, extremely weak, emission in both native OYE and its complexes. It decays with ~ 3 ns lifetime at 143 K. ESR spectra revealed the presence of a low amount of an unpaired spin in OYE. Owing to an unusual relaxational behaviour it could only be observed below 15 K and the signal was measured in both the free enzyme and its complexes. Possible assignment and consequences of this observation are discussed. In frozen aqueous solutions of the OYE-phenolate complex, a phase transition was discovered at which the colour reverted to that of the native enzyme. Subsequent melting restored the original colour. The observed phenomena and existing literature data lead {{to the conclusion that the}} only model from which no apparent inconsistencies emerge, is that of a very complicated network of hydrogen-bonded structures in the protein. These involve several, partly unknown, chromophores. Phenols interfere with this network, leading to the formation of the long- wavelength absorption band in OYE. Finally, a brief postscript (Chapter 8) is given, containing an overview of recent spectroscopic literature on isoalloxazines, a discussion in response to a polemic in papers by other scientists and the ESCA (XPS) spectrum of 3, 7, 8, 10 -tetramethyl-isoalloxazine (3 -methyllumiflavin) ...|$|E

Multiple minimum energy structures were found with binding energies of the order of - 1 eV, indicating chemisorption on the surface. Significant post-adsorption reconstruction was observed, accompanied by minor surface relaxation. Adsorption in the most stable site gave rise to an impurity state within the band gap of the clean defect surface and was found to induce a magnetic moment on the most stable structure only. For all minimum energy structures, NO 2 behaves as a <b>charge</b> <b>acceptor,</b> withdrawing <b>charge</b> from the surface, which was calculated to be approximately six times greater on the ZnO(2110) -VO [...] surface than on the stoichiometric surface, suggesting that the defect surface may prove to be more sensitive. A comparison between theoretically obtained properties of defective and stoichiometrically balanced surfaces and experimental sensing observations is given...|$|R
40|$|We {{performed}} analytical {{calculations of}} the current-voltage and strain-voltage {{response of the}} heterostructure like "charged SPM tip electrode / gap / ionic-semiconductor film" caused by the local changes of (a) ions concentration (stoichiometry contribution); (b) <b>acceptors</b> (donors) <b>charge</b> state (recharging contribution via ionic radius variation); (c) free electrons (holes) concentration (electron-phonon coupling via the deformation potential). The contribution (b) into the strain-voltage SPM was not calculated previously, while the contribution (c) was not even predicted before, while our estimations performed for correlated oxides show that strength of (c) appeared comparable with (a,b). For the case of ion-blocking tip and substrate electrode mainly the changes in holes (electrons) concentration contribute into the voltage-dependent mechanical displacement of the film surface, directly registered by strain SPM. Thus, we predict that the SPM measurements of the ionic semiconductor surface displacement could provide important information about the local changes of the <b>acceptors</b> (donors) <b>charge</b> state and electron (hole) -phonon correlations via the deformation potential. We obtained the great variety of the nonlinear static and dynamic current-voltage and strain-voltage hysteresis loops in the ionic semiconductor thin film with mobile acceptors (donors) and holes (electrons). Some types of the current-voltage hysteresis with pronounced memory window and double loops are observed experimentally in the correlated oxides and resistive switching materials like p-La 1 -xSrxMnO 3 -d and La 1 -xSrxCoO 3 -d, while predicted strain-voltage hysteresis of piezoelectric-like and butterfly-like shape requires experimental justification by SPM.

40|$|The {{incorporation}} of hydrogen shallow donors {{gives rise to}} Mn 2 fine and hyperfine lines in the electron paramagnetic resonance of ZnO. This cannot be explained by recharging of isolated Mn atoms. First principles density functional calculations reveal that transition metals readily form complexes with <b>acceptors</b> by a <b>charge</b> transfer process or by bond formation. This mechanism has implications on both complex partners. Acceptors are neutralized and uncommon charge states of the transition metals are stabilized.

50|$|The {{simplest}} organic PV device {{features a}} planar heterojunction (figure 1). A film of active polymer (donor) and {{a film of}} electron acceptor is sandwiched between contacts. Excitons created in the donor region may diffuse to the junction and separate, with the hole remaining behind and the electron passing into the <b>acceptor.</b> Because <b>charge</b> carriers have diffusion lengths of just 3-10 nm in typical organic semiconductors, planar cells must be thin, but the thin cells absorb light less well. Bulk heterojunctions (BHJs) address this shortcoming. In a BHJ, a blend of electron donor and acceptor materials is cast as a mixture, which then phase-separates. Regions of each material in the device are separated by only several nanometers, a distance suited for carrier diffusion. BHJs require sensitive control over materials morphology on the nanoscale. Important variables include materials, solvents and the donor-acceptor weight ratio.|$|R
40|$|International audienceSeveral new fullerene- heptamethine conjugates {{absorbing}} {{as far as}} 800 nm {{have been}} synthesized and fully characterized by physic-chemical means. In terms of optical and electrochemical characteristics appreciable electronic coupling between both electroactive species is deduced. The latter also reflects the excited state features. To this end, time resolved transient absorption measurements revealed that photoexcitation {{is followed by a}} sequence of charge transfer evolving from higher singlet excited states (i. e., S 2 – fast charge transfer) and the lowest singlet excited state (i. e., S 1 – slow charge transfer) of the heptamethine cyanine as electron donor to an either covalently linked C 60 or C 70 as electron <b>acceptor.</b> Finally, <b>charge</b> transfer from photoexcited C 60 / C 70 completes the charge transfer sequence. The slow internal conversion within the light harvesting heptamethine cyanine and the strong electronic coupling between the individual constituents are particularly beneficial...|$|R
40|$|International audienceDeep level {{transient}} spectroscopies (DLTS) {{applied to}} Schottky junctions made on homoepitaxial boron-doped diamond films show {{the existence of}} two traps. A deep <b>acceptor,</b> negatively <b>charged</b> and strongly attractive for holes, 1. 57 eV above the valence band edge displays the characteristic features of a complex defect due to interacting centers and impurities, also displaying some evolutions after thermal cycles, possibly due to hydrogen effusion or diffusion. It is tentatively ascribed to association of a boron atom, a vacancy and several hydrogen atoms. A deep donor, 1. 13 eV above the valence band edge, able to compensate the boron acceptors, is attributed to a defect correlated with dislocations. It {{could be due to}} the positively charged carbon vacancy. These conclusions are drawn from the Fourier transform-DLTS results coupled with isothermal time domain algorithms allowing the discrimination of multiple emission rates with high resolution...|$|R
40|$|Beside {{the fact}} that they attract highest {{interest}} in the field of organic electronics, heteromolecular structures adsorbed on metal surfaces, in particular donor–acceptor blends, became a popular field in fundamental science, possibly since some surprising and unexpected behaviors were found for such systems. One is the apparent breaking of a rather fundamental rule in chemistry, namely that stronger chemical bonds go along with shorter bond lengths, as it is, e. g., well-known for the sequence from single to triple bonds. In this review we summarize the results of heteromolecular monolayer structures adsorbed on Ag(1 1 1), which – regarding this rule – behave in a counterintuitive way. The <b>charge</b> <b>acceptor</b> moves away from the substrate while its electronic structure indicates a stronger chemical interaction, indicated by a shift of the formerly lowest unoccupied molecular orbital toward higher binding energies. The donor behaves in the opposite way, it gives away charge, hence, electronically the bonding to the surface becomes weaker, {{but at the same time}} it also approaches the surface. It looks as if the concordant link between electronic and geometric structure was broken. But both effects can be explained by a substrate-mediated charge transfer from the donor to the <b>acceptor.</b> The <b>charge</b> reorganization going along with this transfer is responsible for both, the lifting-up of the acceptor molecule and the filling of its LUMO, and also for the reversed effects at the donor molecules. In the end, both molecules mutually enhance their respective donor and acceptor characters. We argue that this effect is of general validity for π-conjugated molecules adsorbing on noble metal surfaces...|$|R
