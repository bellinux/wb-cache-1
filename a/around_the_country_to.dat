5|$|Researchers are {{concerned}} that trucking colonies <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>country</b> <b>to</b> pollinate crops, where they intermingle with other bees from all over, helps spread viruses and mites among colonies.

5|$|Charles R. Forbes, the {{energetic}} {{director of the}} Veterans' Bureau, sought to consolidate control of veterans' hospitals and their construction in his bureau. At the start of Harding's presidency, this power was vested in the Treasury Department. The politically-powerful American Legion backed Forbes and denigrated those who opposed him, like Secretary Mellon, and in April 1922, Harding agreed to transfer control to the Veterans' Bureau. Forbes' main task was to ensure that new hospitals were built <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>country</b> <b>to</b> help the 300,000 wounded World War I veterans.|$|E

5|$|Many {{of those}} {{involved}} in the revolt used pseudonyms, particularly in the letters sent <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>country</b> <b>to</b> encourage support and fresh uprisings. They were used both to avoid incriminating particular individuals and to allude to popular values and stories. One popular assumed name was Piers Plowman, taken from the main character in William Langland's poem. Jack was also a widely used rebel pseudonym, and historians Steven Justice and Carter Revard suggest that this may have been because it resonated with the Jacques of the French Jacquerie revolt several decades earlier.|$|E

5|$|At {{the start}} of John's reign {{there was a sudden}} change in prices, as bad harvests and high demand for food {{resulted}} in much higher prices for grain and animals. This inflationary pressure was to continue {{for the rest of the}} 13th century and had long-term economic consequences for England. The resulting social pressures were complicated by bursts of deflation that resulted from John's military campaigns. It was usual at the time for the king to collect taxes in silver, which was then re-minted into new coins; these coins would then be put in barrels and sent to royal castles <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>country,</b> <b>to</b> be used to hire mercenaries or to meet other costs. At those times when John was preparing for campaigns in Normandy, for example, huge quantities of silver had to be withdrawn from the economy and stored for months, which unintentionally resulted in periods during which silver coins were simply hard to come by, commercial credit difficult to acquire and deflationary pressure placed on the economy. The result was political unrest across the country. John attempted to address some of the problems with the English currency in 1204 and 1205 by carrying out a radical overhaul of the coinage, improving its quality and consistency.|$|E

5|$|In {{preparation}} for {{the introduction of the}} F/A-18 Hornet, No.2 OCU temporarily ceased flying operations on 1January 1985 and transferred Macchi and Mirage training to No.77 Squadron, which assumed responsibility for fighter combat instructor, introductory fighter, and Mirage conversion courses. Beginning on 17May, the first fourteen Australian Hornets—seven single-seat F/A-18As and seven two-seat F/A-18Bs—and a Hornet simulator were delivered to No.2 OCU. Conversion courses on the type commenced on 19August with four F/A-18Bs and three students. No.2 OCU has remained the prime user of the two-seat Hornet, though some are operated by the fighter squadrons, Nos.3, 75 and 77. The first year of Hornet service saw No.2 OCU, as the then-only RAAF operator, undertake demonstration flights <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>country</b> <b>to</b> unveil the new fighter to the Australian public. All of the Hornet units came under the control of a newly re-formed No.81 Wing on 2February 1987. An intense training program that year resulted in 21 pilots converting to the type. In June 1987, Macchi training courses again became the responsibility of No.2 OCU; this role was taken over by No.76 Squadron in January 1989. No.2 OCU suffered its only Hornet loss to date when an F/A-18B crashed at Great Palm Island, Queensland, during a night-time training flight on 18November 1987, killing the pilot. Two Hornets collided during an air-to-air combat training exercise the previous year, but both managed to return to base. The unit temporarily relocated to RAAF Base Richmond, New South Wales, in July 1990, while Williamtown's runway was resurfaced.|$|E
