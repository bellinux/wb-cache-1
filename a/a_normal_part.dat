5|$|During the Byzantine millennium, {{hardly a}} year passed without a {{military}} campaign. Soldiers were <b>a</b> <b>normal</b> <b>part</b> of everyday life, {{much more so}} than in modern Western societies. While it is difficult to draw a distinction between Roman and Byzantine soldiers from an organizational aspect, it is easier to do so in terms of their social profile. The military handbooks known as the Taktika continued a Hellenistic and Roman tradition, and contain a wealth of information about the appearance, customs, habits, and life of the soldiers.|$|E
5|$|The chewing of cud by {{animals such as}} cows, goats, and giraffes is {{considered}} normal behavior. These animals are known as ruminants. Such behavior, though termed rumination, {{is not related to}} human rumination syndrome, but is ordinary. Involuntary rumination, similar to what is seen in humans, has been described in gorillas and other primates. True merycism, as opposed to the cud-chewing process in ruminants, is also <b>a</b> <b>normal</b> <b>part</b> of the digestive process in some other animals, such as kangaroos.|$|E
5|$|By the 1890s {{electrical}} resonance {{was much}} more widely understood and had become <b>a</b> <b>normal</b> <b>part</b> of the engineer's toolkit. In 1891 Hutin and Leblanc patented an FDM scheme for telephone circuits using resonant circuit filters. Rival patents were filed in 1892 by Michael Pupin and John Stone Stone with similar ideas, priority eventually being awarded to Pupin. However, no scheme using just simple resonant circuit filters can successfully multiplex (i.e. combine) the wider bandwidth of telephone channels (as opposed to telegraph) without either an unacceptable restriction of speech bandwidth or a channel spacing so wide as to make the benefits of multiplexing uneconomic.|$|E
50|$|Poetry {{and song}} {{used to be}} <b>an</b> <b>normal</b> <b>part</b> of {{everyday}} life for people on the island, a way of communicating with others, no matter if they were human, animal, spirits of the dead, jinn sorcerers, or the divine. However, Soqotri poetry has been overlooked and the skill of the island's poets ignored.|$|R
30|$|Simple round {{ligament}} plicature: its indication is distal atrophy of {{the round}} ligament associated with <b>a</b> <b>normal</b> proximal <b>part</b> and uterine retroversion.|$|R
30|$|Retrouterine round ligaments plicature: this {{technique}} is used for proximal atrophy of the round ligament with <b>a</b> <b>normal</b> distal <b>part</b> and for uterine retroflexion.|$|R
5|$|Dances can be {{performed}} solo (1, 4); in pairs, (2, 3); in groups, (5, 6, 7); or by massed performers (10). They might be improvised (4, 8) or highly choreographed (1, 2, 5, 10); spontaneous for personal entertainment, (such as when children begin dancing for themselves); a private audience, (4); a paying audience (2); a world audience (10); or an audience interested in a particular dance genre (3, 5). They might {{be a part of}} a celebration, such as a wedding or New Year (6, 8); or a cultural ritual with a specific purpose, such as a dance by warriors like a haka (7). Some dances, such as traditional dance in 1 and ballet in 2, need a very high level of skill and training; others, such as the can-can, require a very high level of energy and physical fitness. Entertaining the audience is <b>a</b> <b>normal</b> <b>part</b> of dance but its physicality often also produces joy for the dancers themselves (9).|$|E
5|$|Inflammation is <b>a</b> <b>normal</b> <b>part</b> of {{the human}} immune response, whereby leukocytes (white blood cells), {{including}} neutrophils (white blood cells that specialize in causing inflammation), gather, and chemokines (proteins released from certain cells, which activate or elicit a response from other cells) accumulate at any location in the body where bacterial or viral infections occur. Inflammation interferes with the activity of bacteria and viruses, and serves to clear them from the body. In DPB, bacteria such as Haemophilus influenzae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa can cause the proliferation of inflammatory cells into the bronchiolar tissues. However, when neither bacteria are present with DPB, the inflammation continues for an as yet unknown reason. In either circumstance, inflammation in DPB can be so severe that nodules containing inflammatory cells form in {{the walls of the}} bronchioles. The presence of inflammation and infection in the airways also results in the production of excess mucus, which must be coughed up as sputum. The combination of inflammation, nodule development, infection, mucus, and frequent cough contributes to the breathing difficulties in DPB.|$|E
25|$|By artisans, {{who work}} {{by hand and}} use {{a limited amount of}} magic. Each {{profession}} has some spells, and the knowledge and use of them is considered <b>a</b> <b>normal</b> <b>part</b> of that trade rather than a form of magecraft.|$|E
30|$|Anterior {{fixation}} {{of round}} ligaments to the aponeurosis: it is indicated in distal atrophy {{of the round}} ligament with <b>a</b> <b>normal</b> proximal <b>part</b> and for uterine retroversion.|$|R
5000|$|While {{sexuality}} is not depicted in graphic detail, sexual orientation is explored. Both the Shin'a'in and Tayledras cultures view homosexuality as <b>a</b> <b>normal,</b> positive <b>part</b> of their culture.|$|R
50|$|Stranger {{anxiety is}} <b>a</b> <b>normal,</b> common <b>part</b> of <b>a</b> child’s development. It {{is not a}} problem to be treated. There are, however, steps a {{caregiver}} can take to help it become less intense.|$|R
25|$|Early {{intervention}} programs, such as school-based {{programs to}} prevent dating violence are also effective. Children {{who grow up}} in violent homes may be {{led to believe that}} such behavior is <b>a</b> <b>normal</b> <b>part</b> of life, therefore it is important to challenge such attitudes when they are present among these children.|$|E
25|$|Some {{claim that}} certain sex {{education}} curricula break down pre-existing notions of modesty or encourage acceptance {{of what they}} consider immoral practices, such as homosexuality or premarital sex. A website which supports that view is the Coalition for Positive Sexuality. Naturally, those that believe that homosexuality and premarital sex are <b>a</b> <b>normal</b> <b>part</b> {{of the range of}} human sexuality disagree with them.|$|E
25|$|Pre-school {{education}} (called Kindergarten in German), free in most states, {{is provided}} {{for all children}} between the ages of three and six years and, whilst optional, is considered <b>a</b> <b>normal</b> <b>part</b> of a child's education due to its high takeup rate. Maximum class size is around 30, each class normally being cared for by one qualified teacher and one assistant.|$|E
50|$|An {{autoimmune}} {{disease is a}} condition arising from an abnormal immune response to <b>a</b> <b>normal</b> body <b>part.</b> There are at least 80 types of {{autoimmune disease}}s. Nearly any body part can be involved. Common symptoms include low grade fever and feeling tired. Often symptoms come and go.|$|R
50|$|Durkheim (1858-1917) {{claimed that}} {{deviance}} {{was in fact}} <b>a</b> <b>normal</b> and necessary <b>part</b> of social organization. When he studied deviance he stated four important functions of deviance.|$|R
5000|$|A missionary radio group recruits, {{trains and}} {{broadcasts}} {{in the main}} dialect of the target culture's language. Broadcast content is carefully adapted to avoid syncretism yet help the Christian Gospel seem like <b>a</b> native, <b>normal</b> <b>part</b> of the target culture. Broadcast content often includes news, music, entertainment and education in the language, as well as purely Christian items.|$|R
25|$|The British anti-nuclear {{movement}} {{at this time}} differed {{from that of the}} 1960s. Many groups sprang up independently of CND, some affiliating later. CND's previous objection to civil disobedience was dropped and it became <b>a</b> <b>normal</b> <b>part</b> of anti-nuclear protest. The women's movement had a strong influence, much of it emanating from the Greenham Common Women's Peace Camp, followed by Molesworth People's Peace Camp.|$|E
25|$|Genetic {{engineering}} in biotechnology stimulated hopes for both therapeutic proteins, drugs and biological organisms themselves, such as seeds, pesticides, engineered yeasts, and modified human cells for treating genetic diseases. From {{the perspective of}} its commercial promoters, scientific breakthroughs, industrial commitment, and official support were finally coming together, and biotechnology became <b>a</b> <b>normal</b> <b>part</b> of business. No longer were the proponents for the economic and technological significance of biotechnology the iconoclasts. Their message had finally become accepted and incorporated into the policies of governments and industry.|$|E
25|$|Vaca Diez and House of Delegates president, Mario Cossío, {{were the}} two next {{in the line of}} {{succession}} to become President. However, they were strongly disliked by the protesters, and each declared they would not accept succession to the Presidency, finally promoting Edwardo Rodriguez, Supreme Court Chief Justice, to the Presidency. Considered apolitical and hence trustworthy by most, his administration was a temporary one until elections could be held. Protesters quickly disbanded in many areas, and like many times in Bolivia's past, major political upheavals were taken as <b>a</b> <b>normal</b> <b>part</b> of the political process.|$|E

50|$|In the West, {{masturbation}} {{in private}} {{or with a}} partner is generally considered <b>a</b> <b>normal</b> and healthy <b>part</b> of sexual enjoyment. Animal masturbation has been observed in many species, both in the wild and in captivity.|$|R
40|$|For many {{adolescents}} {{experimenting with}} drugs is <b>a</b> fairly <b>normal</b> <b>part</b> of growing up, {{but many are}} accessing these drugs at, or near to, schools. In new research, Dale Willits, Lisa Broidy, and Kristine Denman find that drug crime is higher in city blocks that have middle and high schools. They write that schools give drug dealers and buyers the opportunity to meet, a process that occurs regardless of the neighborhood’s characteristics...|$|R
25|$|In addition, Collins removed other Gould {{creations of}} the 1960s and 1970s (including Groovy Grove, who was gravely {{wounded in the}} line of duty and later died in the hospital; Lizz married him before his death). On a more {{philosophical}} level, Collins took a generally less cynical view of the justice system than Gould; Tracy came to accept its limitations and requirements as <b>a</b> <b>normal</b> <b>part</b> of the process which he could manage. Extreme technology was phased out, such as the Space Coupe, in favor of more realistic advanced tools such as the 2-Way Wrist Computer in 1987.|$|E
25|$|After her First Communion {{at the age}} of nine, she practised {{in secret}} severe {{corporal}} mortification, until rheumatic fever confined her to bed for four years. At the end of this period, having made a vow to the Blessed Virgin to consecrate herself to religious life, she was instantly restored to perfect health. In recognition of this favor, she added the name Mary to her baptismal name of Margaret. According to her later account of her life, she had visions of Jesus Christ, which she thought were <b>a</b> <b>normal</b> <b>part</b> of human experience and continued to practice austerity.|$|E
25|$|Bereavement, while <b>a</b> <b>normal</b> <b>part</b> of life, {{carries a}} degree of risk when severe. Severe {{reactions}} affect approximately 10% to 15% of people. Severe reactions mainly occur in people with depression present before the loss event. Severe grief reactions may carry over into family relations. Some researchers have found {{an increased risk of}} marital breakup following the death of a child, for example. Others have found no increase. John James, author of the Grief Recovery Handbook and founder of the Grief Recovery Institute, reported that his marriage broke up {{after the death of his}} infant son.|$|E
50|$|An impulse is a wish or urge, {{particularly}} a sudden one. It {{can be considered}} as <b>a</b> <b>normal</b> and fundamental <b>part</b> of human thought processes, but also one that can become problematic, as in a condition like obsessive-compulsive disorder, borderline personality disorder, and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder.|$|R
50|$|Manikarnika Ghat (Hindi: मणिकर्णिका घाट) {{is one of}} {{the sacred}} ghats in Varanasi with many temples and sacred spots, and is a popular place of Hindu cremation. In India, death is {{considered}} to be <b>a</b> <b>part</b> of <b>normal</b> <b>part</b> of life, shedding of a worn body and a renewal. The Hindu genealogy registers at Varanasi are kept here.|$|R
50|$|Coan went to {{a special}} high school program which allowed her to be in <b>a</b> <b>normal</b> {{classroom}} for <b>part</b> {{of the week and}} at home for the other days which allotted much more time and flexibility to her training schedule. Coan {{graduated from high school in}} 2014 being the top ranked student in her class.|$|R
25|$|Spare-time {{education}} for workers and peasants and literacy {{classes for the}} entire adult population were other components of basic education. Spare-time education included a very broad range of educational activities at all levels. Most spare-time schools were sponsored by factories and run for their own workers; they provided fairly elementary education, as well as courses to upgrade technical skills. Most were on-the-job training and retraining courses, <b>a</b> <b>normal</b> <b>part</b> of any industrial system. These schools continually received publicity in the domestic media {{as a symbol of}} social justice, but it was unclear whether they received adequate resources to achieve this end.|$|E
25|$|FI {{is thought}} to be very common, but much under-{{reported}} due to embarrassment. One study reported a prevalence of 2.2% in the general population. It affects people of all ages, but is more common in older adults (but it should not be considered <b>a</b> <b>normal</b> <b>part</b> of aging). Females are more likely to develop it than males (63% of those with FI over 30 may be female). In 2014, the National Center for Health Statistics reported that one out of every six seniors in the U.S. who lived in their own home or apartment had FI. Men and women were equally affected. 45–50% of people with FI have severe physical and/or mental disabilities.|$|E
25|$|Kakuma is {{situated}} in the second poorest region in Kenya {{and as a result}} of this poverty, there are ongoing tensions between the refugees and the local community that has occasionally resulted in violence. Compared to the wider region, the Kakuma camp has better health facilities and a higher percentage of children in full-time education, which resulted in a general notion that the refugees were better off than the locals. The host community is composed largely of nomadic pastoralists who stick to their traditions and don't co-operate with refugees. Camp is becoming <b>a</b> <b>normal</b> <b>part</b> of the regional socio-economic landscape and a part of livelihood options available in the region. Kakuma is one of two large refugee camps in Kenya; the second and bigger one is Dadaab.|$|E
50|$|An {{additional}} {{claim is}} treated as <b>a</b> <b>normal</b> claim unless <b>Part</b> 20 otherwise provides, so the rules on contents of claim forms, Particulars of Claim, Defences and Replies apply accordingly, although {{the title of the}} statement of case should be modified to make clear who is pleading, and which statement of case, if any, is being responded to.|$|R
5000|$|In Europe, as John Ruskin said, and Sir Kenneth Clark confirmed, {{landscape}} painting was the [...] "chief artistic {{creation of the}} nineteenth century", and [...] "the dominant art", {{with the result that}} in the following period people were [...] "apt to assume that the appreciation of natural beauty and the painting of landscape is <b>a</b> <b>normal</b> and enduring <b>part</b> of our spiritual activity" ...|$|R
25|$|A Mobile Athlon XPs (Athlon XP-M) using a given core is {{physically}} {{identical to the}} equivalent desktop Athlon XPs counterpart, only differing by the configuration used to achieve a given performance level. Processors are usually binned and selected to become a mobile processor by their ability run a given processor speed while supplied with a lower (than desktop) voltage. This results in lower power consumption, longer battery life, and reduced heat over using <b>a</b> <b>normal</b> desktop <b>part.</b> Additionally Mobile XPs feature not being multiplier-locked and generally higher-rated maximum operating temperatures, requirements intended for better operation within the tight thermal constraints within a notebook PC—but also making them attractive for overclocking.|$|R
