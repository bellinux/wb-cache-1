40|$|Effects of ROS {{generation}} {{have been}} postulated to be major contributors to lead-exposure related disease. The {{aim of the}} study was to investigate the effect of aqueous extract of wormwood (Artemisia absinthium) on oxidative stress in rats protractedly exposed to lead. Aqueous extract of wormwood plant was administered orally (200 mg. kg− 1 body weight). Plasma vitamin C, E and non-protein thiol concentrations, red blood cells (RBC) thiobarbituric acid reactive substances, reduced glutathione levels and haemolysis test were evaluated. In addition, RBC antioxidant enzymes activities such as superoxide dismutases, catalase, glutathione peroxidase, glutathione reductase were also estimated. After 11 -weeks, significant decreases of plasma vitamin C, E, non protein-thiol (NP-SH) and RBC-reduced glutathione levels were observed in Pb compared to control group (− 32. 9 %, − 57. 1 %, − 53. 1 %, − 33. 9 %, respectively); superoxide dismutase, glutathione peroxidase, uric aminolevulinic acid and haemolysis test significantly increased in Pb compared to control group (+ 64. 3 %, + 40. 3 %, + 145 %, + 44. 3 %, respectively). In our investigation, after 4 -weeks of treatment all treated groups did not show any difference compared to the control group, except for glutathione peroxidase and RBC-superoxide dismutase activity (− 15. 7 % and + 16. 4 %, respectively). The findings of this study suggest that wormwood (Artemisia <b>absinthium)</b> <b>extract</b> restored the enzymes activities perturbed by exposure to lead, and had a protective role against lipid peroxidatio...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Arnica montana L. and Artemisia {{absinthium}} L. (Asteraceae) are {{medicinal plants}} native to temperate regions of Europe, including Romania, traditionally used {{for treatment of}} skin wounds, bruises and contusions. In the present study, A. montana and A. absinthium ethanolic extracts were evaluated for their chemical composition, antioxidant activity and protective effect against H 2 O 2 -induced oxidative stress in a mouse fibroblast-like NCTC cell line. Results A. <b>absinthium</b> <b>extract</b> showed a higher antioxidant capacity than A. montana extract as Trolox equivalent antioxidant capacity, Oxygen radical absorbance capacity and 2, 2 -diphenyl- 1 -picrylhydrazyl free radical-scavenging activity, in correlation with its flavonoids and phenolic acids content. Both plant extracts had significant effects on the growth of NCTC cells {{in the range of}} 10 – 100 [*]mg/L A. montana and 10 – 500 [*]mg/L A. absinthium. They also protected fibroblast cells against hydrogen peroxide-induced oxidative damage, at the same doses. The best protection was observed in cell pre-treatment with 10 [*]mg/L A. montana and 10 – 300 [*]mg/L A. absinthium, respectively, as determined by Neutral red and lactate dehydrogenase assays. In addition, cell pre-treatment with plant extracts, at these concentrations, prevented morphological changes induced by hydrogen peroxide. Flow-cytometry analysis showed that pre-treatment with A. montana and A. absinthium extracts restored the proportion of cells in each phase of the cell cycle. Conclusions A. montana and A. absinthium extracts, rich in flavonoids and phenolic acids, showed a good antioxidant activity and cytoprotective effect against oxidative damage in fibroblast-like cells. These results provide scientific support for the traditional use of A. montana and A. absinthium in treatment of skin disorders. </p...|$|E

40|$|Campylobacter jejuni {{is one of}} {{the most}} common {{bacterial}} causes of diarrhoea in the industrialized world, being associated with the occurrence of Guillain-Barr頓yndrome, and inducing diseases partially through intestinal adherence. With increasing reports of C. jejuni drug resistance against standard antibiotics, investigations into antiadhesive agents for the prevention of bacterial infection are highly significant. Given the consumer-driven development towards holistic and integrative healthcare, research into additional anti-Campylobacter effects of herbal medicines that are already used for their beneficial effects on bowel and digestive functions is important. Twenty-one herbal extracts were screened for antiadhesive activity against C. jejuni using modifications of previously published antiadhesion assays.

30|$|In {{the present}} work, the Achillea wilhelmsii {{essential}} oil also inhibits APAP induced liver damages {{as demonstrated by}} the decreasing in plasma transaminases activities (Figure  6 A & B). The extent of hepatic damage is assessed by the level of released cytoplasmic transaminases (ALT and AST) in circulation (Chenoweth and Hake 1962; Sallie et al. 1991). ALP is a transmembrain protein in bile canalicules and releases in blood circulation when the canalicules blocked or disturbed. The maintenance of plasma ALP level in all groups indicates that hepatic damages don’t affect the bile canalicules. The binding of NAPQI with cellular proteins leads to necrosis in liver (Dahlin et al. 1984), which subsequently alters the liver function tests. The observed hepatoprotective effect might be a consequence of the stabilization in the redox state and maintenance of the antioxidant capacity offered by Achillea wilhelmsii essential oils. Other studies also confirming these results indicating the protective effect of Cyperus Scariosus and Artemisia <b>absinthium</b> <b>extract</b> on acetaminophen induced hepatotoxicity have been shown via lowering the respective serum AST and ALT (Gilani and Janbaz 1995 a, b). Protective effect of α- and β-amyrin, a triterpene mixture from Protium heptaphyllum (Aubl.) March. trunk wood resin, against acetaminophen-induced liver injuries in mice through diminution in oxidative stress and toxic metabolite formation was also reported (Oliveira et al. 2005). One study showed the protective effects of quercetin and curcumin on paracetamol-induced liver injury in rat through mitigation the rise in markers of liver injuries such as AST and ALT (Yousef et al. 2010). In addition, Propolis extract exhibited curative effects by reversing APAP induced alterations in blood biochemical variables, CYP enzymes and markers of oxidative stress (Bhadauria and Nirala 2009). Lupeol when co-administered with APAP effectively reduces oxidative stress and prevents APAP-induced hepatotoxicity by increasing the intracellular defense mechanism consisting of various antioxidant enzymes (SOD, CAT, GST, GR and GPx) (Kumari and Kakkar 2012). These data were confirmed by histophatological examinations (Figure  7) indicating administration of essential oils decreases the oxidative hepatic injuries such as necrotic aggregations in acetaminophen treated rats.|$|E
40|$|The aqueous-methanolic {{extracts}} from indigenous plants {{and some of}} the pure compounds were subjected to preliminary for their possible protective effects against lethal dose of paracetamol (1 g/kg) in mice. The hepatoprotective effect was studied further in rats, using paracetamol-and carbon tetrachloride (CC! 4) -induced hepatotoxicity as in vivo model. The cytoplasmic enzymes (i. e. GOT, GPT and ALP) are released into serum upon hepatocellular damage and the serum values of such enzymes are reliable indices to assess the extent of hepatic damage. The enzyme values were found to be high in toxin treated animals, whereas the serum enzyme values in the animals pretreated with plant materials were found to be significantly lower than those of the toxic control group and similar to the normal values indicating hepatoprotective effect To resolve whether the hepatoprotective effect was mediated through inhibition of microsomal drug metabolizing enzymes (MDME), the plant material was co-administered with penotabarbital (PB) to observe possible prolongation in pentobarbiral-induced sleep in mice. The test material that was found to prolong the PB sleep were further subjected to strychnine-induced toxicity in mice to clarify whether the prolongation in PB sleep was solely due to inhibitory action on MDME or central depressive activity Since some known calcium channel blockers (CCBs) also exhibit hepatoprotective action and the facility for measuring CCBs-activity was available in the laboratory, the plant materials were also tested for this activity by using isolated tissue experiments (i. e. rabbit jejunum). Plant material with inhibitory action on the spontaneous contraction of jejunum was further tested against the high K+(>mM) -induced spastic contractions {{as well as in the}} Ca 2 +-free medium The post-treatment (Curative) experiments were performed in selected cases where the test material was found to be inhibitory against MDME and was helpful in deciding whether the he-patoprotective activity was solely due to MDME inhibition or some other mechanism was also in operation Artemisia absinthium (shoots), Berberis aristata (shoot and fruits) and berberine (an alkaloid from Berberis aristata) were found to be protective against both paracetamol-and CCI 4 -induced liver damage and also showed MDME inhibitory activities. These were also capable to show curative effect against paracetamol but unable to mitigate the toxicity due to CCI 4, suggesting that baside MDME inhibitory activity other mexhanisms may also be involved in the hepatoprotective response Artemisia maritime (shoots), Artemisia scoparia (shoots), Cichorium intybus (shoots and seeds), Cyperus scariosus (rhizomes), Rubia cordifolia (roots) extracts, and pure compounds from hepatoprotection against both extracts, quercetin as well as Artemisia <b>absinthium</b> <b>extract</b> exhibited Ca 2 + channel blocking activities, hence this property may partly be responsible for the observed hepatoprotection The plant materials were found to be relatively safe in acute toxicity testing in mice and this study rationalizes the folkore use of plants in the hepatobiliary disorder...|$|E

Lipid levels, ATPase activity, thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS), and proteins carbonyl were estimated. In liver and kidney, lead acetate inhibited membrane-bound enzymes and increased (P < 0. 05) the levels of cholesterol, triglycerides, free fatty acids, phospholipids, TBARS, and carbonyl proteins. After 4 weeks, the intoxicated group who received A. Ab showed {{a significant reduction in}} TBARS and carbonyl levels in liver and kidney compared to group exposed to lead. A.

Considering {{the vulnerability of}} the developing brain to Pb neurotoxicity, this study was carried out to investigate the effects of Pb exposure on brain regions acetylcholinesterase (AchE) and monoamino oxidase (MAO) enzymes activities and on behavioural changes. Wister rat were exposed to 750 ppm of lead acetate in the drinking water for 11 -weeks after weaning, and treated by Artemisia <b>Absinthium</b> L. (wormwood) <b>extract</b> (200 mg. kg- 1 body weight) for 4 weeks. The activities of AchE and MAO were determined in the hypothalamus, hippocampus, cortex and striatum of male rat; and general/ Locomotors activity was evaluated in the open-field test. Results indicated a significant decrease in AchE activity in intoxicated group (Pb) compared to untreated group (as contral) (hypothalamus: - 12 &#x 0025;, hippocampus: - 57 &#x 0025;, cerebral cortex: - 18 &#x 0025; and striatum: - 43 &#x 0025;) and in MAO activity (hypothalamus: - 29 &#x 0025;, hippocampus: - 41 &#x 0025;, cerebral cortex: - 28 &#x 0025; and striatum: - 51 &#x 0025;) respectively, with decrease crossing test score and increase sniffing test score. After, wormwood extract administration, the activity of AchE and MAO were significantly increased in all brain region compared to Pb group, but were significantly lower than control.
