5|$|Because protein {{structures}} {{are composed of}} amino acids whose side chains are linked by a common protein backbone, {{a number of different}} possible subsets of the atoms that make up a protein macromolecule can be used in producing a structural alignment and calculating the corresponding RMSD values. When aligning structures with very different sequences, the side chain atoms generally are not taken into account because their identities differ between many aligned residues. For this reason it is common for structural alignment methods to use by default only the backbone atoms included in the peptide bond. For simplicity and efficiency, often only the <b>alpha</b> <b>carbon</b> positions are considered, since the peptide bond has a minimally variant planar conformation. Only when the structures to be aligned are highly similar or even identical is it meaningful to align side-chain atom positions, in which case the RMSD reflects not only the conformation of the protein backbone but also the rotameric states of the side chains. Other comparison criteria that reduce noise and bolster positive matches include secondary structure assignment, native contact maps or residue interaction patterns, measures of side chain packing, and measures of hydrogen bond retention.|$|E

40|$|We {{define and}} prove {{properties}} of the consensus shape {{for a family of}} proteins, a protein-like structure that provides a compact summary of the significant structural information for a protein family. If all members of a protein family exhibit a geometric relationship between corresponding <b>alpha</b> <b>carbons</b> then that relationship is preserved in the consensus shape. In particular, distances and angles that are consistent across family members are preserved. For the consensus shape, the spacing between successive <b>alpha</b> <b>carbons</b> is variable, with small distances in regions where the members of the protein family exhibit significant variation and large distances (up to the standard spacing of about 4 ˚A) in regions where the family members agree. Despite this nonprotein-like characteristic, the consensus shape preserves and highlights important structural information. We describe an iterative algorithm for computing the consensus shape and prove that the algorithm converges. We also present the results of experiments in which we build consensus shapes for several known protein families. ...|$|R

40|$|Secondary {{structures}} of proteins were studied by recurrence quantification analysis (RQA). High-resolution, 3 -dimensional coordinates of alpha-carbon atoms comprising {{a set of}} 68 proteins were downloaded from the Protein Data Bank. By fine-tuning four recurrence parameters (radius, line, residue, separation), {{it was possible to}} establish excellent agreement between percent contribution of alpha-helix and beta-sheet structures determined independently by RQA and that of the DSSP algorithm (Define Secondary Structure of Proteins). These results indicate that there is an equivalency between these two techniques, which are based upon totally different pattern recognition strategies. RQA enhances qualitative contact maps by quantifying the arrangements of recurrent points of <b>alpha</b> <b>carbons</b> close in 3 -dimensional space. For example, the radius was systematically increased, moving the analysis beyond local alpha-carbon neighborhoods in order to capture super-secondary and tertiary structures. However, differences between proteins could only be detected within distances up to about 6 - 11 Å, but not higher. This result underscores the complexity of alpha-carbon spacing when super-secondary structures appear at larger distances. Finally, RQA-defined secondary structures were found to be robust against random displacement of <b>alpha</b> <b>carbons</b> upwards of 1 Å This finding has potential import for the dynamic functions of proteins in motion. © 2001 Wiley-Liss, Inc...|$|R

Thus, sequence alignment is done over segments rather than over the entire protein. Selection of the template for each segment is based on sequence similarity, comparisons of <b>alpha</b> <b>carbon</b> coordinates, and predicted steric conflicts arising from the van der Waals radii of the divergent atoms between target and template.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to distance restraints, restraints on the torsion angles {{of the chemical}} bonds, typically the psi and phi angles, can be generated. One approach {{is to use the}} Karplus equation, to generate angle restraints from coupling constants. Another approach uses the chemical shifts to generate angle restraints. Both methods use the fact that the geometry around the <b>alpha</b> <b>carbon</b> affects the coupling constants and chemical shifts, so given the coupling constants or the chemical shifts, a qualified guess can be made about the torsion angles.|$|E
25|$|The {{assessment}} of homology models' accuracy is straightforward when the experimental structure is known. The most common method of comparing two protein structures uses the root-mean-square deviation (RMSD) metric {{to measure the}} mean distance between the corresponding atoms in the two structures {{after they have been}} superimposed. However, RMSD does underestimate the accuracy of models in which the core is essentially correctly modeled, but some flexible loop regions are inaccurate. A method introduced for the modeling assessment experiment CASP is known as the global distance test (GDT) and measures the total number of atoms whose distance from the model to the experimental structure lies under a certain distance cutoff. Both methods can be used for any subset of atoms in the structure, but are often applied to only the <b>alpha</b> <b>carbon</b> or protein backbone atoms to minimize the noise created by poorly modeled side chain rotameric states, which most modeling methods are not optimized to predict.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background Although {{experimental}} methods for determining protein structure are providing high resolution structures, they cannot keep the pace at which amino acid sequences are resolved {{on the scale}} of entire genomes. For a considerable fraction of proteins whose structures will not be determined experimentally, computational methods can provide valuable information. The value of structural models in biological research depends critically on their quality. Development of high-accuracy computational methods that reliably generate near-experimental quality structural models is an important, unsolved problem in the protein structure modeling. Results Large sets of structural decoys have been generated using reduced conformational space protein modeling tool CABS. Subsequently, the reduced models were subject to all-atom reconstruction. Then, the resulting detailed models were energy-minimized using state-of-the-art all-atom force field, assuming fixed positions of the <b>alpha</b> <b>carbons.</b> It has been shown that a very short minimization leads to the proper ranking {{of the quality of the}} models (distance from the native structure), when the all-atom energy is used as the ranking criterion. Additionally, we performed test on medium and low accuracy decoys built via classical methods of comparative modeling. The test placed our model evaluation procedure among the state-of-the-art protein model assessment methods. Conclusion These test computations show that a large scale high resolution protein structure prediction is possible, not only for small but also for large protein domains, and that it should be based on a hierarchical approach to the modeling protocol. We employed Molecular Mechanics with fixed <b>alpha</b> <b>carbons</b> to rank-order the all-atom models built on the scaffolds of the reduced models. Our tests show that a physic-based approach, usually considered computationally too demanding for large-scale applications, can be effectively used in such studies. </p...|$|R
25|$|The {{decarboxylation}} of oxalosuccinate (below center) {{is a key}} step in {{the formation}} of alpha-ketoglutarate. In this reaction, the lone pair on the adjacent Tyrosine hydroxyl abstracts the proton off the carboxyl group. This carboxyl group is also referred to as the beta subunit in the isocitrate molecule. The deprotonation of the carboxyl group causes the lone pair of electrons to move down making carbon dioxide and separating from oxalosuccinate. The electrons continue to move towards the <b>alpha</b> <b>carbon</b> pushing the double bond electrons (making the ketone) up to abstract a proton off an adjacent lysine residue. An alpha-beta unsaturated double bond results between carbon 2 and three. As you can see in the picture, the green ion represents either Mg2+ or Mn2+, which is a cofactor necessary for this reaction to occur. The metal-ion forms a little complex through ionic interactions with the oxygen atoms on the fourth and fifth carbons (also known as the gamma subunit of isocitrate).|$|E
25|$|After {{the carbon}} dioxide is split from the oxalosuccinate in the {{decarboxylation}} step (below right), the enol will tautomerize to the keto from. The formation of the ketone double bond is started by the deprotonation of that oxygen off the <b>alpha</b> <b>carbon</b> (C#2) by the same lysine that protonated the oxygen in the first place. The {{lone pair of electrons}} moves down kicking off the lone pairs that were making the double bond. This lone pair of electrons abstracts a proton off the Tyrosine that deprotonated the carboxyl group in the decarboxylation step. The reason that we can say that the Lys and Tyr residues will be the same from the previous step is because they are helping in holding the isocitrate molecule in the active site of the enzyme. These two residues will be able to form hydrogen bonds back and forth {{as long as they are}} close enough to the substrate.|$|E
500|$|The alpha {{amino acids}} {{are the most}} common form found in nature, but only when {{occurring}} in the L-isomer. The <b>alpha</b> <b>carbon</b> is a chiral carbon atom, with the exception of glycine which has two indistinguishable hydrogen atoms on the <b>alpha</b> <b>carbon.</b> [...] Therefore, all alpha amino acids but glycine can exist in either of two enantiomers, called L or D amino acids, which are mirror images of each other (see also Chirality). While L-amino acids represent all of the amino acids found in proteins during translation in the ribosome, D-amino acids are found in some proteins produced by enzyme posttranslational modifications after translation and translocation to the endoplasmic reticulum, as in exotic sea-dwelling organisms such as cone snails. They are also abundant components of the peptidoglycan cell walls of bacteria, and D-serine may act as a neurotransmitter in the brain. D-amino acids are used in racemic crystallography to create centrosymmetric crystals, which (depending on the protein) may allow for easier and more robust protein structure determination. The L and D convention for amino acid configuration refers not to the optical activity of the amino acid itself but rather to the optical activity of the isomer of glyceraldehyde from which that amino acid can, in theory, be synthesized (D-glyceraldehyde is dextrorotatory; L-glyceraldehyde is levorotatory).|$|E

5|$|Protein {{structures}} have to {{be represented}} in some coordinate-independent space to make them comparable. This is typically achieved by constructing a sequence-to-sequence matrix or series of matrices that encompass comparative metrics: rather than absolute distances relative to a fixed coordinate space. An intuitive representation is the distance matrix, which is a two-dimensional matrix containing all pairwise distances between some subset of the atoms in each structure (such as the <b>alpha</b> <b>carbons).</b> The matrix increases in dimensionality {{as the number of}} structures to be simultaneously aligned increases. Reducing the protein to a coarse metric such as secondary structure elements (SSEs) or structural fragments can also produce sensible alignments, despite the loss of information from discarding distances, as noise is also discarded. Choosing a representation to facilitate computation is critical to developing an efficient alignment mechanism.|$|R

These helices in L 7 /L 12 are within a patch of highly conserved residues on the surface of L 7 /L 12 whose role is as yet uncertain.

The main focus of this thesis is to develop new approach on the protein structure modeling by means of differential geometry and integrable theory. The start point is to simplify a protein backbone as a piecewise linear polygonal chain, with vertices recognized as the central <b>alpha</b> <b>carbons</b> of the amino acids.

2500|$|More refined {{forms of}} the {{mechanism}} are known. In 1957, Zimmerman and Traxler proposed that some aldol reactions have [...] "six-membered transition states having a chair conformation." [...] This {{is now known as}} the Zimmerman–Traxler model. E-enolates give rise to anti products, whereas Z-enolates give rise to syn products. The factors that control selectivity are the preference for placing substituents equatorially in six-membered transition states and the avoidance of syn-pentane interactions, respectively. E and Z refer to the cis-trans stereochemical relationship between the enolate oxygen bearing the positive counterion and the highest priority group on the <b>alpha</b> <b>carbon.</b> In reality, only some metals such as lithium and boron reliably follow the Zimmerman–Traxler model. Thus, in some cases, the stereochemical outcome of the reaction may be unpredictable.|$|E
2500|$|When {{the protein}} is {{labelled}} with carbon-13 and nitrogen-15 {{it is possible}} to record triple resonance experiments that transfer magnetisation over the peptide bond, and thus connect different spin systems through bonds. This is usually done using some of the following experiments, HNCO, HN(CA)CO, HNCA, HN(CO)CA, HNCACB and CBCA(CO)NH. All six experiments consist of a 1H-15N plane (similar to a HSQC spectrum) expanded with a carbon dimension. In the HN(CA)CO, each HN plane contains the peaks from the carbonyl carbon from its residue as well the preceding one in the sequence. The HNCO contains the carbonyl carbon chemical shift from only the preceding residue, but is much more sensitive than HN(CA)CO. [...] These experiments allow each 1H-15N peak to be linked to the preceding carbonyl carbon, and sequential assignment can then be undertaken by matching the shifts of each spin system's own and previous carbons. The HNCA and HN(CO)CA works similarly, just with the alpha carbons (Cα) rather than the carbonyls, and the HNCACB and the CBCA(CO)NH contains both the <b>alpha</b> <b>carbon</b> and the beta carbon (Cβ). Usually several of these experiments are required to resolve overlap in the carbon dimension. This procedure is usually less ambiguous than the NOESY-based method, since it is based on through bond transfer. In the NOESY-based methods additional peaks corresponding to atoms that are close in space but that do not belong to sequential residues will appear, confusing the assignment process. Following the initial sequential resonance assignment it is usually possible to extend the assignment from the Cα and Cβ {{to the rest of the}} sidechain using experiments such as HCCH-TOCSY, which is basically a TOCSY experiment resolved in an additional carbon dimension.|$|E

50|$|Marc L. Mansfield {{proposed}} in 1994, {{that there can}} be knots in proteins.

He connected the two points by tracing a geodesic on the surface of the sphere (arcs of great circles), and then connected each end of the protein chain with one of these points. Repeating this procedure a 100 times and counting the times where the knot is destroyed in the mathematical sense yields the unknot score. Human carbonic anhydrase was identified to have a low unknot score (22). Upon visually inspecting the structure, it was seen that the knot was shallow, meaning that the removal of a few residues from either end destroys the knot.|$|R
