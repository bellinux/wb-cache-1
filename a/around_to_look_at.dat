Trot was so dizzy she couldn't stand at first, but she wasn't at all hurt, and presently Betsy came flying to them and would have bumped into the others had they not retreated in time to avoid her. Then, in quick succession, came the Lion, Hank and the Sawhorse, bounding from mountain to mountain to fall safely upon the greensward. Only the Wizard was now left behind, and they waited so long for him that Dorothy began to be worried.|$|E
6000|$|I {{scrambled}} up {{the rock and}} around to the eastern end, {{where there was a}} broader space for standing and from which some capital views could be obtained. The sea about the rock was calm, but there was quite a swell on and an off-shore breeze was blowing. There were no boats visible. The tide was low, leaving bare the curious caves and headlands along shore, and I secured a number of excellent snapshots. It was now three o'clock. I must wait another hour yet before I could get the best view of the [...] "Hole in the Wall"--a huge, arch-like opening through a jutting headland to the west of me. I went <b>around</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> it, when I saw a sight that made me stop short in dismay. This was nothing less than the flat, drifting outward around the point. The swell and suction of the water around the rock must have pulled her loose--and I was a prisoner! At first my only feeling was one of annoyance. Then a thought flashed into my mind that made me dizzy with fear. The tide would be high that night. If I could not escape from Island Rock I would inevitably be drowned.|$|E
60|$|Just as I {{got close}} up behind Jone, {{and was about}} to make a rush past him, his man turned into a side street.

And all the bath-chair men were standing there with their mouths wide open, staring at a woman running along the street, pulling an old bath-chair man in a bath-chair! For a second I felt like dropping the handle I held and making a rush for {{the front door of the}} hotel, which was right ahead of me; and then I thought, as now I was in for it, it would be a lot better to put a good face on the matter, and not look as if I had done anything I was ashamed of, and so I just slackened speed and came up in fine style at the door of the Old Hall. Four or five of the bath-chair men came running across the street to know if anything had happened to the old party I was pulling, and he got out looking as ashamed as if he had been whipped by his wife.|$|E

60|$|The body of Caesar lay {{for some}} time unheeded where it had fallen, the {{attention}} of every one being turned to the excitement, which was extending through the city, and to the expectation of other great events which might suddenly develop themselves in other quarters of Rome. There were left only three of Caesar's slaves, who gathered <b>around</b> the body <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> the wounds. They counted them, and found the number twenty-three. It shows, however, how strikingly, and with what reluctance, the actors in this tragedy came up to their work at last, that of all these twenty-three wounds only one was a mortal one. In fact, it is probable that, while all of the conspirators struck the victim in their turn, to fulfill the pledge which they had given to one another that they would every one inflict a wound, each one hoped that the fatal blow would be given, after all, by some other hand than his own.|$|R
40|$|Motivation: For {{the last}} few years, Bayesian {{networks}} (BNs) have received increasing attention from the computational biology community as models of gene networks, though learning them from gene expression data is problematic: Most gene expression databases contain measurements for thousands of genes, but the existing algorithms for learning BNs from data do not scale to such highdimensional databases. This means that the user has to decide in advance which genes {{are included in the}} learning process, typically {{no more than a few}} hundreds, and which genes are excluded from it. This is not a trivial decision. We propose an alternative approach to overcome this problem. Results: We propose a new algorithm for learning BN models of gene networks from gene expression data. Our algorithm receives a seed gene S and a positive integer R from the user, and returns a BN for those genes that depend on S such that less than R other genes mediate the dependency. Our algorithm grows the BN, which initially only contains S, by repeating the following step R+ 1 times and, then, pruning some genes: Find the parents and children of all the genes in the BN and add them to it. Intuitively, our algorithm provides the user with a window of radius R <b>around</b> S <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> the BN model of a gene network without having to exclude any gene in advance. We prove that our algorithm is correct under the faithfulness assumption. We evaluate our algorithm on simulated and biological data (Rosetta compendium) with satisfactory results. Contact...|$|R

A warming trend was established and native species identified with the possible addition of what has been thought of up to now as a range extension species, Laminaria ochroleuca. Composition changes over time using the MNCR data proved to be inconclusive although a relationship between depth and year had been shown to be significant while the Marclim database showed increases in the Lusitanian species L. ochroleuca, Primary intertidal and subtidal surveys were conducted at five sites <b>around</b> Plymouth Sound <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> the current {{composition of}} kelp and the effect of changes to related biodiversity was analysed through epibiont analysis of kelp holdfasts from the six commonly competing kelp species found within two sites of Plymouth Sound.

Depth was also found be to a confounding effect on species composition, although this varied greatly between sites. Epibiont species were found to show significance between kelp species but not site and no relationship was found between epibiont diversity and habitat volume, although this was considered due to low sample size. Preferred colonisation conditions for the invasive Japanese species Undaria pinnatifida was also investigated on the shores of Torbay, UK.

40|$|This project employs {{knowledge}} of tribal history {{to inform the}} design of a community at Tirohia, a rural marae belonging to the people of Ngāti Hako in Hauraki. Ngāti Hako have lived in Hauraki for nearly one thousand years and plan to continue to occupy the area for the next thousand years. Ngāti Hako have an interesting history that originally saw them as a prolific tribe throughout the Hauraki rohe (tribal area). They were then diminished and assigned to living in the swamplands. This wet environment and its resources resulted in a different mode of settling and building from that with which we are familiar. In the Hauraki Plains the high water table and propensity for flooding meant that whare could not be semi- subterranean with earth floors, nor could food be stored underground. The people of the Hauraki Plains needed specific responses to their environment. Traditional Hauraki Māori values and attitudes towards the natural environment have a similar purpose to the modern approach to sustainable design and, as such, a contemporary marae community that <b>looks</b> <b>to</b> the past for inspiration must also adopt ‘sustainable solutions’. However, for Māori, the attitude towards the environment is one of obligation by the tangata whenua {{to take care of the}} environment, to preserve and protect it not only for the benefit of present and future generations but also to respect the ancestors to whom these resources are linked. Treaty settlements are enabling iwi and hapū <b>around</b> the country <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> developing their marae, whether they are renovating, upgrading, building, or developing papakāinga communities based around their marae. Cost often drives design decisions. This study proposes an argument for considering tribal history in the creation of sustainable marae communities to encourage strong identification with the marae and one’s past. The research question posed is ‘Can architecture through the contemplation and representation of Tribal History, encourage cultural identity, and help to ensure the sustainability of the culture for future generations?...|$|R
