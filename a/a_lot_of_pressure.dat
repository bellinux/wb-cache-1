30|$|Differently {{from the}} {{psychological}} studies, prior educational research has explored learned helplessness as unpleasant emotion with {{a connection to}} a predictor of poor academic performance or underachievement. Educators have well recognized interactions between cognition and emotion {{and the effects of}} emotions in learning mathematics (Di Martino and Zan 2011). Although actual effects of emotions are difficult to examine, students emotional responses can shut down their problem solving entirely when faced with <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>pressures</b> in <b>a</b> situation (Hannula 2002). Particularly, some unpleasant emotions could cause students underachievement, which prompted research on students’ various types of anxiety. While describing test anxiety and mathematics anxiety, Hembree (1990) referred anxiety as “the feelings of uncertainty and helplessness in face of danger” (p. 33). This certainly showed that learned helpless is related to student’s emotional status in specific situations like facing danger or pressures.|$|R
