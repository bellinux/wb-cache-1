25|$|Secrets of a Windmill Girl (1966) {{featured}} Pauline Collins and April Wilding and {{was directed}} by Arnold L. Miller. The film has some fan dancing scenes danced by an ex-Windmill Theatre artiste. The Night They Raided Minsky's (1968) gives a possibly legendary account {{of the birth of}} striptease at Minsky's Burlesque theatre in New York. In 1968, the sci-fi film Barbarella depicted Jane Fonda stripping in zero-gravity conditions whilst wearing her spacesuit. Marlowe (1969) stars Rita Moreno playing a stripper, in the finale of the movie simultaneously delivering dialogue with the title character and performing a vigorous dance on stage. The Beatles movie Magical Mystery Tour has a scene where all the men on the tour bus go to a gentleman's club <b>and</b> <b>watch</b> <b>a</b> woman strip on stage.|$|E
25|$|In {{response}} to Roe v. Wade, most states enacted or attempted to enact laws limiting or regulating abortion, such as laws requiring parental consent or parental notification for minors to obtain abortions; spousal mutual consent laws; spousal notification laws; laws requiring abortions {{to be performed}} in hospitals, not clinics; laws barring state funding for abortions; laws banning intact dilation and extraction, also known as partial-birth abortion; laws requiring waiting periods before abortions; and laws mandating that women read certain types of literature <b>and</b> <b>watch</b> <b>a</b> fetal ultrasound before undergoing an abortion. In 1976, Congress passed the Hyde Amendment, barring federal funding of abortions (except in cases of rape, incest, or {{a threat to the}} life of the mother) for poor women through the Medicaid program. The Supreme Court struck down some state restrictions in a long series of cases stretching from the mid-1970s to the late 1980s, but upheld restrictions on funding, including the Hyde Amendment, in the case of Harris v.

500|$|The {{story is}} set in the mid-1950s, shortly after Bergman's award win at the 1956 Cannes Film Festival for Smiles of a Summer Night. After his return to Stockholm, Bergman feels {{compelled}} to go to a cinema <b>and</b> <b>watch</b> <b>a</b> Hollywood blockbuster movie. As he exits the cinema, he inexplicably finds himself transported to Hollywood, where a limo driver is waiting to take him to a film studio.

500|$|... 12 Monkeys is {{inspired}} by the French short film La Jetée (1962); as in La Jetée, characters are haunted by the image of their own death. Like La Jetée, 12 Monkeys contains references to Alfred Hitchcock's Vertigo (1958). Toward {{the end of the}} film, Cole and Railly hide in a theater showing a 24-hour Hitchcock marathon <b>and</b> <b>watch</b> <b>a</b> scene from Vertigo. Railly then transforms herself with a blonde wig, as Judy (Kim Novak) transformed herself into blonde Madeleine in Vertigo; Cole sees her emerge within a red light, as Scottie (James Stewart) saw Judy emerge within a green light. Brief notes of Bernard Herrmann's film score can also be heard. Railly also wears the same coat Novak wore {{in the first part of}} Vertigo. The scene at Muir Woods National Monument, where Judy (as Madeleine) looks at the growth rings of a felled redwood and traces back events in her past life, resonates with larger themes in 12 Monkeys. Cole and Railly later have a similar conversation while the same music from Vertigo is repeated. The Muir Woods scene in Vertigo is also re-enacted in La Jetée. In a previous scene in the film, Cole wakes up in a hospital bed with scientists of the future talking to him in chorus. This is a direct homage to the [...] "Dry Bones" [...] scene in Dennis Potter's The Singing Detective.|$|E

2500|$|Since the Hubble [...] "{{constant}}" [...] is {{a constant}} only in space, not in time, the radius of the Hubble sphere may increase or decrease over various time intervals. The subscript '0' indicates {{the value of the}} Hubble constant today. Current evidence suggests that the expansion of the Universe is accelerating (see Accelerating universe), meaning that, for any given galaxy, the recession velocity dD/dt is increasing over time as the galaxy moves to greater and greater distances; however, the Hubble parameter is actually thought to be decreasing with time, meaning that if we were to look at some fixed distance D <b>and</b> <b>watch</b> <b>a</b> series of different galaxies pass that distance, later galaxies would pass that distance at a smaller velocity than earlier ones.|$|E
