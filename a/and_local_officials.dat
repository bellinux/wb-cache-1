On April 29, 2010, the Petoskey News-Review reported that the Michigan Department of Transportation (MDOT) would rebuild the roadway in preparation to transfer it back to local control once again.

5|$|The Fourteenth Amendment, {{particularly}} {{its first}} section, {{is one of}} the most litigated parts of the Constitution, forming the basis for landmark decisions such as Brown v. Board of Education (1954) regarding racial segregation, Roe v. Wade (1973) regarding abortion, Bush v. Gore (2000) regarding the 2000 presidential election, and Obergefell v. Hodges (2015) regarding same-sex marriage. The amendment limits the actions of all state <b>and</b> <b>local</b> <b>officials,</b> including those acting on behalf of such an official.|$|E
5|$|These {{statutes}} {{have been}} upheld as exercises of Congress's Commerce Clause power, {{or in the}} case of the mail fraud and program bribery statutes, the Postal Clause and the Spending Clause, respectively. In the special case where a member of Congress is the defendant, the Speech or Debate Clause places certain restrictions on the actions that can be prosecuted and proved up. Some commentators have argued that prosecutions of state <b>and</b> <b>local</b> <b>officials</b> under these statutes pose substantial federalism questions, while others argue that the Guarantee Clause provides additional authority for such prosecutions.|$|E
5|$|During {{the early}} 1990s, an {{independent}} Health Advisory Panel - appointed by then-Governor Roy Romer - oversaw {{a series of}} reports, called the Historical Public Exposure Studies. The 12-member Health Advisory Panel included multiple medical doctors, scientists, PhDs, <b>and</b> <b>local</b> <b>officials.</b> The Rocky Flats Historical Public Exposure Studies involved nine years of research. The Studies had three main objectives: (1) create a public record of plant operations and accidents that contributed to contaminant releases from the Rocky Flats Plant between 1952 and 1989; (2) assess public exposures to contaminants and potential risks from past releases; and, (3) determine the need for future studies. The Studies' research included identification and assessment of chemicals and radioactive materials from past releases; estimates of risk to residents living or working in surrounding communities during the Plant's operation from 1952 to 1989; an evaluation of possible exposure pathways; and, dose assessments for historical releases.|$|E

5|$|Local {{officials}} in Allegan have proposed {{creation of a}} truck route around the town. Concerned about the traffic and noise, residents have formed the Citizens for a Safer Community. They cite reports that show that the accident rates in town are higher than the statewide average. The group <b>and</b> <b>local</b> <b>officials</b> are proposing using 24th Street, 118th Avenue and Babylon Road for truck traffic. MDOT would require permits to erect the signs needed for the truck route. The department has indicated that the bypass {{would not be a}} state highway. MDOT will not take ownership of the roads needed for the truck route, but overall the department is supportive of the city's efforts to make the downtown area more pedestrian friendly.|$|E
5|$|On April 29, 2010, MDOT {{announced}} plans to transfer M-108 in its entirety to the Village of Mackinaw City and Emmet County. In preparation for this transfer, MDOT repaved, widened and reconstructed the roadway. While rebuilding {{the section of the}} highway between US23 and the northern terminus, the welcome center was closed. Plans had this section to be completed, and the center to be reopened, for Memorial Day weekend, with the remainder of construction to be completed in August. Following the transfer to local control, M-108 ceased to be a state highway and the designation was decommissioned. Previous news reports stated that the roadway was too small to merit highway status under federal guidelines. The transfer was completed on December 9, 2010, when MDOT <b>and</b> <b>local</b> <b>officials</b> signed memoranda of understanding to finalize the transfer. The section within the Village of Mackinaw City was transferred to the village, and the remainder to Emmet County.|$|E
5|$|At {{the time}} of its formation, forecasters {{determined}} that Fern might loop around in the Gulf of Mexico and it was more threatening to land than Hurricane Edith which was also projected to hit the Gulf Coast. On September 9, as Fern was becoming organized, forecasters issued a hurricane watch along the Texas coast, anticipating that Fern might strengthen into a hurricane. In addition, small boats were warned to stay in port and residents were advised to be aware of storm conditions brought by Fern. The next day, the hurricane watches were changed to warnings, forcing residents living on the Texas coast to board up and evacuate. In preparation for the storm's impact, Civil Defense workers and the American Red Cross were put on alert. In Galveston, eight emergency shelters were planned to open but five were closed when officials learned that they were not needed as most residents chose to ride out the storm in their homes. When Fern moved inland, the National Weather Service issued 21 tornado warnings and numerous flood warnings. In North Beach, city buses were used to transport evacuees inland <b>and</b> <b>local</b> <b>officials</b> were concerned {{about what to do with}} the relief trailers used to house survivors of Hurricane Celia a year earlier.|$|E

5|$|During {{his tenure}} as mayor, Galván {{received}} death threats from organized crime. Nuevo Laredo has been the battleground among Mexico's drug trafficking organizations given its proximity to the U.SMexico border and Interstate 35, a lucrative route {{where most of the}} cocaine, marijuana and methamphetamine that reaches the United States are smuggled through. In May 2012, alleged organized crime members left the headless corpses of 14 men inside a vehicle near the Nuevo Laredo city hall. Alongside the corpses was a written message reportedly from the Sinaloa Cartel that accused Galván and other city officials of working for Los Zetas (such accusations between gangsters <b>and</b> <b>local</b> <b>officials</b> are common in Mexico). In June 2012, a car bomb detonated outside the Nuevo Laredo city hall at Galván's parking area, injuring several bystanders. On February 2013, the Nuevo Laredo police chief Roberto Alejandro Balmori Garza was kidnapped and his two brothers were found dead. He had been appointed by Galván as head of the police in 2011 following the murder of Manuel Farfán Carriola, the former police chief of Nuevo Laredo.|$|E
5|$|The first {{renovation}} in the 20thcentury {{occurred in}} 1922, when the Supreme Muslim Council under Amin al-Husayni (the Grand Mufti of Jerusalem) commissioned Turkish architect Ahmet Kemalettin Bey to restore al-Aqsa Mosque and the monuments in its precincts. The council also commissioned British architects, Egyptian engineering experts <b>and</b> <b>local</b> <b>officials</b> {{to contribute to}} and oversee the repairs and additions which were carried out in 1924–25 by Kemalettin. The renovations included reinforcing the mosque's ancient Umayyad foundations, rectifying the interior columns, replacing the beams, erecting a scaffolding, conserving the arches and drum of the main dome's interior, rebuilding the southern wall, and replacing timber in the central nave with a slab of concrete. The renovations also revealed Fatimid-era mosaics and inscriptions on the interior arches that had been covered with plasterwork. The arches were decorated with gold and green-tinted gypsum and their timber tie beams were replaced with brass. A quarter of the stained glass windows also were carefully renewed so as to preserve their original Abbasid and Fatimid designs. Severe damage {{was caused by the}} 1837 and 1927 earthquakes, but the mosque was repaired in 1938 and 1942.|$|E
