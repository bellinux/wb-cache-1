5|$|Darling had {{a strong}} {{personality}} and an independent outlook. Those who knew him well thought him destined {{to be a leader}} in whatever he undertook. He shunned strong drink and tobacco and found it difficult to tolerate overindulgence in alcohol. Normally even-tempered, he did show displeasure at the heckling from the crowd at Lord's at his obstinate defensive effort {{in the face of an}} Australian batting collapse. He was <b>a</b> <b>stickler</b> <b>for</b> fair play, but his actions against the English batsman KS Ranjitsinhji would today be seen as gamesmanship. During the bowler's approach and after the bowler had looked at the field, the Australian fielders moved behind Ranjitsinhji's back. This worried the Indian prince when playing his leg glance and eventually saw him left out of the English team.|$|E
5|$|Sotomayor was {{appointed}} by Mayor Ed Koch in 1988 {{as one of the}} founding members of the New York City Campaign Finance Board, where she served for four years. There she took a vigorous role in the board's implementation of a voluntary scheme wherein local candidates received public matching funds in exchange for limits on contributions and spending and agreeing to greater financial disclosure. Sotomayor showed no patience with candidates who failed to follow regulations and was more of <b>a</b> <b>stickler</b> <b>for</b> making campaigns follow those regulations than some of the other board members. She joined in rulings that fined, audited, or reprimanded the mayoral campaigns of Koch, David Dinkins, and Rudy Giuliani.|$|E
5|$|Holmes {{had served}} under Kit Carson and John C. Fremont, {{but he was}} old and {{physically}} impaired when he met Burnham. He had lost all of his family in the Indian wars and before he died he wanted to impart {{his knowledge of the}} frontier to the young Burnham. The two men traveled throughout the American Southwest and northern Mexico, and Holmes taught him many scouting skills, such as how to track a trail, how to double and cover one's own trail, how to properly ascend and descend precipices, and how to tell the time at night. Burnham also learned survival skills from Holmes, such as where to find water in the desert, how to protect himself from snakes, and what to do in case of forest fires or floods. <b>A</b> <b>stickler</b> <b>for</b> details, Holmes impressed on him that even in the simplest things, such as braiding a rope, tying a knot, or putting on or taking off a saddle, there is a right way and a wrong way. The two men earned a living by hunting and prospecting. Burnham also worked as a cowboy, a guard for the mines, a guide, and a scout during these years.|$|E

25|$|Adrian H. Thompson, {{a career}} D.C. firefighter, was named Fire Chief in July 2002. <b>A</b> <b>stickler</b> <b>for</b> safety {{regulations}} and discipline, Thompson quickly restored morale. Initially hired {{at the same}} salary as Few, his pay rose by 18.8 percent to $158,000 a year in 2003.|$|E
25|$|Nureyev {{was above}} all <b>a</b> <b>stickler</b> <b>for</b> {{classical}} technique, and his mastery {{of it made}} him a model for {{an entire generation of}} dancers. If the standard of male dancing rose so visibly in the West after the 1960s, it was largely because of Mr. Nureyev's inspiration.|$|E
25|$|He was <b>a</b> <b>stickler</b> <b>for</b> decency. On {{entering}} politics {{he accepted}} the official code of conduct of the Communist Party from which he never deviated. He lived in a two-room quarter at the Western Court, {{and walked to the}} Lok Sabha until he became a minister. Subsequently also he led a simple life and shunned many of the facilities he was entitled to. When he was minister, he never allowed the official car to enter the airport tarmac for him after a flight. Instead he used the airline bus to reach the terminal.|$|E
60|$|Indeed, Monseigneur, <b>a</b> rigid <b>stickler</b> <b>for</b> {{etiquette}} himself, {{would never}} {{so far have}} forgotten what {{was due to the}} house of Bourbon as to indulge in any pursuit--such as helping a Minister on with his coat--at the moment when His Majesty entered a room.|$|R
50|$|Mills was <b>a</b> great <b>stickler</b> <b>for</b> small farms, almost cottier allotments; {{he did not}} {{see that}} any single bodily labour can effect but very little unless in combination, and that {{extensive}} projects employ most labour, and produce the largest results. A thick mist long clouded the human vision on that and similar points, and is not yet dispelled.|$|R

25|$|Hermes Conrad (Phil LaMarr) – Hermes is the Jamaican {{accountant}} of Planet Express. A 36th-level bureaucrat (demoted {{to level}} 37 during the series) {{and proud of}} it, he is <b>a</b> <b>stickler</b> <b>for</b> regulation and enamored of the tedium of paperwork and bureaucracy. Hermes is also a former champion in Olympic Limbo, a sport derived from the popular party activity. He gave up limbo after the 2980 Olympics when a young fan, imitating him, broke his back and died. Hermes has a wife, LaBarbara, and a 12-year-old son, Dwight.|$|E
25|$|Cadwaladr was {{subsequently}} posted {{to a hospital}} in Scutari, Turkey, a hospital being run by Florence Nightingale. Cadwaladr worked there for some months, but there were frequent clashes between the two; they came from very different social backgrounds and were a generation apart in age (31 years). Nightingale was <b>a</b> <b>stickler</b> <b>for</b> rules and bureaucracy, some of which she set up; indeed, she was also famed as a statistician. Cadwaladr often side-stepped regulations to react more intuitively to the ever-changing needs of the injured soldiers. Whilst Nightingale subsequently acknowledged Cadwaladr's work and the progress that she made against the unhygienic conditions, the two fell out {{to such a degree that}} Cadwaladr, by now aged over 65, moved by choice from the hospital, nearer to the frontline at Balaclava. Here, apart from her nursing work and her supervision of the camp kitchens, she again gained notoriety for her fight with bureaucracy to ensure that necessary supplies got through. Nightingale visited Balaclava twice and, on seeing the changes brought about by Cadwaladr's methods, gave her the credit she was due.|$|E
500|$|In 1915, Earp {{visited the}} set of {{director}} Allan Dwan's movie, The Half-Breed, starring Douglas Fairbanks. In his autobiography, Dwan recalled, [...] "As was the custom in those days, he [...] was {{invited to join the}} party and mingle with our background action." [...] Earp became friends with William Hart and later Tom Mix, the two most famous movie cowboys of their era. Hart was <b>a</b> <b>stickler</b> <b>for</b> realism in his depictions of Western life, and may have relied on Earp for advice. Earp later frequently visited the sets of movie director John Ford, whose movies starred Harry Carey.|$|E
500|$|Shafer {{was known}} during his playing career by the {{nickname}} [...] "Orator". According to Alfred Henry Spink, founder of The Sporting News, {{he received the}} nickname because he [...] "was <b>a</b> great <b>stickler</b> <b>for</b> his rights and talked to himself when not talking to the Umpire." [...] Another player of the era, future Baseball Hall of Fame inductee Orator Jim O'Rourke, shared the same nickname.|$|R

5000|$|Though Jollie was {{a strong}} {{independent}} and <b>a</b> great <b>stickler</b> <b>for</b> his principles {{in the matter of}} ordination, he joined the ‘happy union’ of presbyterians and congregationalists, which was not introduced into Lancashire till 3 April 1693, when it had already been dissolved in London. At the third meeting (4 Sept. 1694) he was appointed, with Henry Newcome, the Manchester presbyterian, to conduct the correspondence for the county. At the tenth meeting (12 April 1698) he preached the sermon. According to Calamy ‘he drew up a large essay for farther concord amongst evangelical reforming churches.’ ...|$|R
500|$|He was a stocky, compact man and {{a strong}} driver of the ball, playing most of his cricket as an opening batsman. He was a patient batsman and {{was known for his}} solid defence, but he was able to score quickly when required. In Sydney in 189798, he scored 160 in 165minutes, {{including}} 30 boundaries to assist his team in defeating the English. He was the first man to score 500runs in a Test series and was also the first to score three centuries in a series. His captaincy was disciplinarian in nature but his teammates respected his broad cricket knowledge. Even tempered with a strong personality, he was <b>a</b> <b>stickler</b> <b>for</b> fair play on the field. His teammates gave him the nickname [...] "Paddy" [...] due to a supposed resemblance to the Australian boxer, Frank [...] "Paddy" [...] Slavin.|$|E
500|$|Somewhat {{forgotten}} today, Carl Locher (1851–1915) {{was one of}} {{the earlier}} visitors to Skagen. Holgen Drachmann, who had taught him before he attended the Royal Academy, persuaded him to go there in 1872. Especially interested in marine painting, Locher adopted a realist impressionistic approach, influenced by the time he spent with Léon Bonnat in Paris during the 1870s. <b>A</b> <b>stickler</b> <b>for</b> perfection, especially in his drawings, his works cover the transition from sailing ships to steamships and from the original Skagen to the evolving tourist destination. His paintings include , 1888, [...] (1892) [...] and above all [...] (c. 1890) which depicts the horse-drawn carriage which until the railway reached Skagen in 1890 was the way travellers arrived there from Frederikshavn. In 1910, Locher built a house overlooking the beach at Skagen Østerby where he painted until he died of heart trouble in 1913.|$|E
500|$|Groves was {{promoted}} to major on 1 July 1940. Three weeks later, he became special assistant for construction to the Quartermaster General, Major General Edmund B. Gregory. The two men {{had known each other}} a long time, as Groves' father was a close friend of Gregory's. At this point, the US Army was about to embark on a national mobilization, and it was the task of the Construction Division of the Quartermaster Corps to prepare the necessary accommodations and training facilities for the vast army that would be created. The enormous construction program had been dogged by bottlenecks, shortages, delays, spiralling costs, and poor living conditions at the construction sites. Newspapers began publishing accounts charging the Construction Division with incompetence, ineptitude, and inefficiency. Groves, who [...] "had a reputation as a doer, a driver, and <b>a</b> <b>stickler</b> <b>for</b> duty", was {{one of a number of}} engineer officers brought in to turn the project around. He was tasked with inspecting construction sites and checking on their progress.|$|E

60|$|He was {{therefore}} <b>a</b> great <b>stickler</b> <b>for</b> purity of election; although, had {{he considered the}} matter, {{he should have known}} that with him money was his only passport into that Elysium in which he had now lived for two years. He probably did not consider it; for when, in those canvassing days immediately preceding the election, he had seen that all the beer-houses were open, and half the population was drunk, he had asked Mr Nearthewinde whether this violation of the treaty was taking place only on the part of his opponent, and whether, in such case, it would not be duly noticed with a view to a possible future petition.|$|R
500|$|The {{son of a}} United States Army chaplain, Groves {{lived at}} various Army posts during his childhood. In 1918, he {{graduated}} fourth in his class at the United States Military Academy at West Point and was commissioned into the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. In 1929, he went to Nicaragua {{as part of an}} expedition to conduct a survey for the Inter-Oceanic Nicaragua Canal. Following the 1931 Nicaragua earthquake, Groves took over Managua's water supply system, for which he was awarded the Nicaraguan Presidential Medal of Merit. He attended the Command and General Staff School at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, in 1935 and 1936; and the Army War College in 1938 and 1939, after which he was posted to the War Department General Staff. Groves developed [...] "a reputation as a doer, a driver, and <b>a</b> <b>stickler</b> <b>for</b> duty" [...] and in 1940 he became special assistant for construction to the Quartermaster General, tasked with inspecting construction sites and checking on their progress. In August 1941, he was appointed to create the gigantic office complex for the War Department's 40,000 staff that would ultimately become the Pentagon.|$|E
500|$|He was {{regarded}} worldwide as an arbiter of men's fashions. He made wearing tweed, Homburg hats and Norfolk jackets fashionable, and popularised {{the wearing of}} black ties with dinner jackets, instead of white tie and tails. He pioneered the pressing of trouser legs {{from side to side}} in preference to the now normal front and back creases, and was thought to have introduced the stand-up turn-down shirt collar, created for him by Charvet. <b>A</b> <b>stickler</b> <b>for</b> proper dress, he is said to have admonished Lord Salisbury for wearing the trousers of an Elder Brother of Trinity House with a Privy Councillor's coat. Deep in an international crisis, Salisbury informed the Prince that it had been a dark morning, and that [...] "my mind must have been occupied by some subject of less importance." [...] The tradition of men not buttoning the bottom button of waistcoats is said to be linked to Edward, who supposedly left his undone because of his large girth. His waist measured 48inches (122cm) shortly before his coronation. He introduced the practice of eating roast beef and potatoes with horseradish sauce and yorkshire pudding on Sundays, a meal that remains a staple British favourite for Sunday lunch. He was not a heavy drinker, though he did drink champagne and, occasionally, port.|$|E
500|$|Ballantyne {{never visited}} the coral {{islands of the}} South Pacific, relying instead on the {{accounts}} of others that were then beginning to emerge in Britain, which he exaggerated for theatrical effect by including [...] "plenty of gore and violence meant to titillate his juvenile readership". His ignorance of the South Pacific caused him to erroneously describe coconuts as being soft and easily opened; <b>a</b> <b>stickler</b> <b>for</b> accuracy he resolved that in future, whenever possible, he would write only about things he had personal experience of. Ballantyne wrote The Coral Island while staying in {{a house on the}} Burntisland seafront opposite Edinburgh on the Firth of Forth in Fife. According to Ballantyne biographer Eric Quayle he borrowed extensively from an 1852 novel by the American author James F. Bowman, The Island Home. He also borrowed from John Williams' Narrative of Missionary Enterprises (1837), to the extent that cultural historian Rod Edmond has suggested that Ballantyne must have written one chapter of The Coral Island with Williams' book open in front of him, so similar is the text. Edmond describes the novel as [...] "a fruit cocktail of other writing about the Pacific", adding that [...] "by modern standards Ballantyne's plagiarism in The Coral Island is startling".|$|E
50|$|Wagner's {{syndrome}} has for a {{long time}} been considered <b>a</b> synonym <b>for</b> <b>Stickler's</b> syndrome.

6000|$|Shovel was {{the person}} best worth {{listening}} to on the subject (observe him, the centre {{of half a dozen}} boys), and at first he was for the defence, being <b>a</b> great <b>stickler</b> <b>for</b> the rights of mothers. But when the case against the girl leaked out, she need not look to him for help. The police had found the child in a basket down an area, and being knowing ones they pinched it to make it cry, and then they pretended to go away. Soon the mother, who was watching hard by to see if it fell into kind hands, stole to her baby to comfort it, [...] "and just as she were a kissing on it and blubbering, the perlice copped her." ...|$|R
5000|$|On {{the subject}} of period detail, Clark said, [...] "Our costume designer, David Withrow, was <b>a</b> real <b>stickler</b> <b>for</b> what was and wasn’t in fashion in 2008, and I think his work is the most meticulous in terms of selling the period. Beyond that, {{it was a lot}} of double-checking to make sure certain props or {{products}} would’ve existed in the period. I took it pretty seriously. The news reports they watch on TV are almost verbatim recreations of the look and feel of Asheville, NC local news from the era. Website design was also pretty important for the period vibe. In exterior shots, we tried to keep out-of-period cars to a minimum, but that’s probably where we were the most lax with the period setting." ...|$|R
500|$|I {{definitely}} don't go {{the straight}} and narrow path, and you know, I definitely kinda like to experiment and collaborate. And so, I think it's taken me and Max this long to work together because of that, because what he does is genius and he is a classic hitmaker. But when I was coming out it was {{at a time when we}} had the huge pop explosion, and he was all over radio and I just wanted to work with others like Linda Perry and do that route and do [...] "Beautiful" [...] and songs like that. We built a level of respect for each other. So at this point, coming together, especially embracing my true pop-starness, at this point in my career having come full circle, I was able to really truly embrace it, and embrace him. He gave me the freedom to really sing on these songs, and have a little more creative freedom because I heard he is <b>a</b> <b>stickler</b> <b>for</b> melody and a melody king and I was scared, I was like 'Oh my God! I won't be able to collaborate here.' But he couldn't have been more great, and this is a really fun song, super up-tempo. It's probably the most dancey-ish song on my record, but it's called 'Let There Be Love' but it's free and representative of what this album is about.|$|E

50|$|The Jarrett-Peacock-DeJohnette trio also {{produced}} recordings that consist largely of challenging original material, including 1987's Changeless. Several {{of the standards}} albums contain an original track or two, some attributed to Jarrett, but most are group improvisations. The live recordings Inside Out and Always Let Me Go (released in 2001 and 2002 respectively) marked a renewed interest by the trio in wholly improvised free jazz. By this point in their history, the musical communication among these three men had become nothing short of telepathic, and their group improvisations frequently take on a complexity that sounds almost composed. The standards trio undertakes frequent world tours of recital halls (the only venues in which Jarrett, <b>a</b> notorious <b>stickler</b> <b>for</b> acoustics, will play) {{and is one of}} the few truly successful jazz groups to play both straight-ahead (as opposed to smooth) and free jazz.|$|R
