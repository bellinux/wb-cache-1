500|$|Writing for HitFix, Alan Sepinwall cited [...] "Holidays of Future Passed" [...] as {{the best}} future-set episode of The Simpsons since the first one, [...] "Lisa's Wedding". He noted that it was [...] "the {{emotional}} side of things" [...] that made the episode successful, such as the dissatisfaction Bart and Lisa feel because of their disconnection with the children, and also Homer's transformation into a [...] "very wise, sweet guy after somehow surviving into old age." [...] Sepinwall particularly praised {{the scene at the}} cryonics facility where Homer encourages the children to give Bart another chance as [...] "really sweet", and he described the idea of a frozen Grampa as [...] "a clever variation on the very familiar joke of how Homer and the family neglect [...] because he's such a pain in the ass." [...] Sepinwall also commended the episode for its jokes about the future, highlighting the scenes revolving around air travel as well as the scenes showing Krusty as [...] "the Andy Rooney of 2041" [...] and Ralph Wiggum as [...] "an endless series of stupid clones who keep killing one another." [...] In February 2012, [...] "Holidays of Future Passed" [...] was listed by Matt Zoller Seitz of New York magazine as one of [...] "Nine Latter-Day Simpsons Episodes That Match Up to the Early Classics". He noted that the [...] "reconciliations between Bart and Lisa <b>and</b> <b>their</b> <b>kids</b> are moving." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Fly on the Wall" [...] {{was written}} by Cyrus {{with the aid of}} Armato, James, and Devrim Karaoglu. [...] "Fly on the Wall" [...] was {{intended}} for the media, regarding [...] "how they think they know everything about , when they don't. They want to be a fly on my wall and watch [...] 24/7." [...] Cyrus explained it was about attempting to avoid paparazzi but they appeared, [...] "not going away like little annoying flies." [...] Cyrus was inspired to write [...] "Bottom of the Ocean" [...] by her deceased fish, Lyric and Melody, who died when Cyrus was eleven years of age. She said the topic drifted drastically once she began writing. [...] "It's saying if there's someone you've loved but for some reason you can't love them anymore, you have to take your feelings, scoop them out, and put them {{at the bottom of the}} ocean." [...] Cyrus, Armato, James, Aaron Dudley co-wrote [...] "Wake Up America", a track about environmentalism. The song was directed towards [...] "the people in the back seat", children of today's generation; she said that, in the future, they would be the ones [...] "driving [...] Earth to what it's gonna be." [...] "It's the only one you got, so you gotta take care of it. And if you don't, there's gonna be, maybe not for you, right then, and your generation but your kids <b>and</b> <b>their</b> <b>kids</b> ... Every generation has a cycle that'll carry on for the rest of eternity", she concluded. Cyrus recorded a cover of Cheyenne Kimball's [...] "Four Walls" [...] from the album The Day Has Come (2006) for Breakout, titled [...] "These Four Walls". The twelfth and final track is a remixed version of the hit [...] "See You Again", referred to as the Rock Mafia Remix and the 2008 Remix; [...] "See You Again" [...] was originally released on the Meet Miley Cyrus disc of Hannah Montana 2: Meet Miley Cyrus.|$|E
