[...] Television Without Pity gave the episode a [...] "B+". Alan Sepinwall wrote that the season premiere was [...] "a little heavy on the exposition" [...] while also commenting that {{the same could be}} said about the pilot episode.

500|$|Beach {{maintained}} that the greatest challenge facing the crew was a seeming mundane activity, garbage disposal and cleaning: [...] "It was 84 days of strenuous work just keeping the ship clean. It was <b>amazing</b> <b>how</b> <b>much</b> dirt we created, so I {{had a field day}} every weekend. The crew started objecting until they saw how much trash we kept getting rid of. Then they couldn't object." [...] To remove trash without surfacing, Triton had a garbage disposal unit (GDU), a small inverted torpedo tube that ejected a weighted bag of refuse through the bottom of the ship. [...] However, if the GDU was temporarily out of commission due to repairs, as it was on 22 February, the after torpedo tubes were used, a less than optimum solution.|$|E

500|$|The {{length of}} pre-Code films was usually {{comparatively}} short, but that running time often required tighter material {{and did not}} affect the impact of message films. Employees' Entrance (1933) received the following review from Jonathan Rosenbaum: [...] "As an attack on ruthless capitalism, it goes a lot further than more recent efforts such as Wall Street, and it's <b>amazing</b> <b>how</b> <b>much</b> plot and character are gracefully shoehorned into 75 minutes." [...] The film featured pre-Code megastar Warren William (later dubbed [...] "the king of Pre-Code"), [...] "at his magnetic worst", playing a particularly vile and heartless department store manager who, for example, terminates the jobs of two long-standing male employees, one of whom commits suicide as a result. He also threatens to fire Loretta Young's character, who pretends to be single to stay employed, unless she sleeps with him, then attempts to ruin her husband after learning she is married.|$|E
500|$|Brooks did not {{direct and}} write a film again for seven years until 2004's Spanglish. Filming took six months, ending in June with three days of {{additional}} filming in October; Brooks produced three endings for the film, shooting several scenes in [...] "15 to 25 takes" [...] as {{he did not feel}} the film was tonally complete, although the script did not change much during filming. He opted to cast Adam Sandler in a more dramatic role than his usual goofball comedy parts based on his performance in Punch-Drunk Love and Sandler's relationship with his family. Describing the length of production, Brooks said: [...] "It's <b>amazing</b> <b>how</b> <b>much</b> more perverse you are as a writer than as a director. I remember just being so happy that I'd painted myself into some corners [...] I thought that would make it interesting. When I had to wrestle with that as a director, it was a different story." [...] Brooks's directing style [...] "drove [...] bats", especially Téa Leoni, with Cloris Leachman (who replaced an ill Anne Bancroft a month into filming) describing it as [...] "free-falling. You're not going for some result. It's just, throw it in the air and see where it lands." [...] The film was poorly received and was a box-office failure.|$|E

500|$|The {{speculation}} about Dexhart and Leslie quickly spins out of control, upsetting Leslie {{because it is}} distracting her from overseeing the Christmas village that she set up in Lot 48. Ron (Nick Offerman) decides to give Leslie the day off to lie low and distributes her daily duties among {{the rest of the}} staff. [...] Everyone is <b>amazed</b> <b>how</b> <b>much</b> Leslie does by herself each day and the entire group struggles to complete their tasks. [...] Leslie has lunch with Dave (Louis C.K.), who reveals that his unit in the US Army Reserve has been called up to active duty in San Diego for a year to eighteen months, and he invites Leslie to join him since he has fallen in love with her. Leslie confides to Ann (Rashida Jones) that she is considering the move, as the treatment of her in the media has soured her on Pawnee.|$|R

500|$|Rob Salem of Toronto Star {{said that}} [...] "fans {{who have been}} {{complaining}} about this season’s relative complacency [...] finally got their gore and more when the farm was overrun by suddenly, strangely single-minded walkers." [...] Pamela Mitchell of Houston Chronicle commented that [...] "Beside the Dying Fire" [...] was the most eventful episode of the season, while Digital Spy's Morgan Jeffery thought that [...] "every single major character gets their moment to shine"; [...] "Epic, action-packed, emotional—'Beside the Dying Fire' is great television," [...] she concluded. TV Guide television critic Michael Logan affirmed that the season finale [...] "was so scary and shock-a-minute outrageous that it nearly made our heads explode." [...] In his A– review, Zach Handlen of The A.V. Club said that [...] "Beside the Dying Fire" [...] adequately accomplished what he was hoping for. He wrote, [...] "We're finally off Hershel's farm, in about the most definitive way imaginable: The barn has been burned, and the house itself is overrun by a herd of 'walkers'." [...] New York Starlee Kine adulated the installment, and asserted that it was comparable to episodes of The Walking Dead first season. [...] "It’s just <b>amazing</b> <b>how</b> <b>much</b> smoother the plot holes go down when something is actually happening on this show. For {{the first time since}} last season, I felt engrossed enough to not be consumed with all the small things this show gets wrong. Up until this episode, the majority of this season has consisted exclusively of small things: petty dramas, misdirected stakes, so much stalling. I’m not sure I can {{go so far as to}} say that it got everything right with this one, but at least it was entertaining and the nonstop action felt like content instead of just bookends." [...] Mark A. Perigard of the Boston Herald wrote that it was the closest the program [...] "ever resembled the climax of a George Romero film." [...] Time journalist Nate Rawlings felt that [...] "Beside the Dying Fire" [...] sufficiently encompassed a climax for its storylines, adding that it left the audience anticipating for future installments of the series.|$|E
2500|$|Arisu Kashiwagi, lead {{designer}} at Imaginary Forces for {{the title}} sequence, was [...] "inspired by all the changing activity and vignettes within those rows of windows [...] — the patterns of light, color, narratives, and graphic silhouettes. It is pretty <b>amazing</b> <b>how</b> <b>much</b> you can see {{and the number of}} windows out there with wide open shades... I could understand our innate fascination with the rear window and that discomforting pleasure when catching a small sliver of a private act." [...] She also looked to Edward Hopper's [...] "Night Windows" [...] and Gerhard Richter's paintings for reference. In order to differentiate the sequence from other painting-inspired ones, Kashiwagi chose to take [...] "a more modern, abstract look while also embracing the spirit of David Mack’s watercolor paintings from" [...] Alias. On the design concept, she added, [...] "We based the concept off of Jessica’s PTSD and alcoholism, her blurry, unreliable point of view, and translated that visually using paint strokes that smear and obfuscate the scenes ... the scenes would appear only in small sections of the frame, either blocked by a foreground element or contained inside of a silhouetted framing device." [...] Michelle Dougherty, creative director on the project, looked to the opening sequence of Alfred Hitchcock's Rear Window to help create the [...] "voyeuristic approach" [...] as well as [...] "using the city as a character" [...] to highlight [...] "the dark places [...] the grit" [...] where Jones investigates.|$|E

5000|$|Set It Off {{received}} generally positive {{reviews from}} critics and audiences. On review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, it holds an overall 63% approval rating based on 24 reviews, with a rating average of 6.1 out of 10. The site's consensus reads: [...] "It may not boast an original plot, but Set It Off is a satisfying, socially conscious heist film {{thanks largely to}} fine performances from its leads." [...] Roger Ebert stated that Set It Off is [...] "a lot more" [...] than a thriller about four black women who rob banks. Comparing it to Waiting to Exhale, but [...] "with a strong jolt of reality," [...] he said, [...] "It creates {{a portrait of the}} lives of these women that's so observant and informed." [...] He gave the film three and a half stars, and added, [...] "The movie surprised and moved me: I expected a routine action picture and was <b>amazed</b> <b>how</b> <b>much</b> I started to care about the characters." ...|$|R
5000|$|During {{the writing}} process for Blood Bitch, Hval was {{influenced}} by vampiric imagery and 1970s horror and exploitation films: “I was <b>amazed</b> about <b>how</b> <b>much</b> taboo they could contain without moral compass, <b>how</b> <b>much</b> incest there could be.” In a statement released unpon the album's announcement, she elaborated: [...] "Blood Bitch is a fictitious story, fed by characters and images from horror and exploitation films of the '70s. With that language, rather than smart, modern social commentary, I found I could {{tell a different story}} about myself and my own time: a poetic diary of modern transience and transcendence." ...|$|R

How beautiful the morning might be on this earth I never knew until I found myself wandering by the edge of my woods and over my lawn with the tender gray-blue sky above me and all the freshness of the grass and flowers and trees about me, the birds singing among the branches, and she sleeping sweetly somewhere within that house with its softly defined lights and shadows.

Many times was a head lifted from a small pillow, straining after {{the meaning of the}} squeaky noises that came up from below! Not Santa Claus. Honora's belief in him had merged into a blind faith in a larger and even more benevolent, if material providence: the kind of providence which Mr. Meredith depicts, and which was to say to Beauchamp: [...] "Here's your marquise;" [...] a particular providence which, at the proper time, gave Uncle Tom money, and commanded, with a smile, [...] "Buy this for Honora--she wants it." [...] All-sufficient reason! Soul-satisfying philosophy, to which Honora was to cling for many years of life.

40|$|This book is {{an amateur}} astronomer’s {{guide to the}} mythology and {{symbolism}} associated with the celestial bodies in the Solar System, and even includes some of the legendary tales {{of people who had}} or have a connection with these objects.

You’d be <b>amazed</b> <b>how</b> <b>much</b> of our world today reflects the myths and stories of these cultures!  Most amateur astronomers are familiar with the various Solar System objects, but they will be only peripherally aware of what ancient cultures thought of these other worlds. In fact, the mythology of the planets challenges many twenty-first century concepts and beliefs There are other books available on astromythology, but this one focuses mostly on our own Solar System, as opposed to the constellations and deep sky objects.  Alexander offers a new angle on timeless subjects and is exciting, informative and dramatic, as well as surprisingly relevant to everyday life.

[...] "Our all is at stake," [...] said he, [...] "and the little conveniences and comforts of life, when set in {{competition}} with our liberty, ought to be rejected, not with reluctance, but with pleasure. Yet it is plain that, in the tobacco colonies, we cannot at present confine our importations within such narrow bounds as the northern colonies. A plan of this kind, to be practicable, must be adapted to our circumstances; for, if not steadily executed, it had better have remained unattempted. We may retrench all manner of superfluities, finery of all descriptions, and confine ourselves to linens, woollens, &c., not exceeding a certain price. It is <b>amazing</b> <b>how</b> <b>much</b> this practice, if adopted in all the colonies, would lessen the American imports, and distress the various trades and manufactures of Great Britain. This would awaken their attention. They would see, they would feel, the oppressions we groan under, and exert themselves to procure us redress. This, once obtained, we should no longer discontinue our importations, confining ourselves still not to import any article that should hereafter be taxed by act of Parliament for raising a revenue in America; for, however singular I {{may be in the}} opinion, I am thoroughly convinced, that, justice and harmony happily restored, it is not the interest of these colonies to refuse British manufactures. Our supplying our mother country with gross materials, and taking her manufactures in return, is the true chain of connection between us.

Finally, we illustrate their use for implementing a limited notion of streams, and how such streams can be used to create a compiler that achieves excellent speedups for multiprocessors with a limited number of processors...|$|R
