40|$|Manufacturing of more-than-minimally {{manipulated}} <b>autologous</b> <b>cell</b> therapies {{presents a}} number of unique challenges driven by complex supply logistics {{and the need to}} scale out production to multiple manufacturing sites or near the patient within hospital settings. The existing regulatory structure in Europe and the United States imposes a requirement to establish and maintain comparability between sites. Under a single market authorization, this is likely to become an unsurmountable burden beyond two or three sites. Unless alternative manufacturing approaches can be found to bridge the regulatory challenge of comparability, realizing a sustainable and investable business model for affordable <b>autologous</b> <b>cell</b> therapy supply is likely to be extremely demanding. Without a proactive approach by the regulators to close this “translational gap,” these products may not progress down the development pipeline, threatening patient accessibility to an increasing number of clinician-led autologous cellular therapies that are already demonstrating patient benefits. We propose three prospective manufacturing models for the scale out/roll out of more-than-minimally manipulated clinically led <b>autologous</b> <b>cell</b> therapy products and test their prospects for addressing the challenge of product comparability with a selected expert reference panel of US and UK thought leaders. This paper presents the perspectives and insights of the panel and identifies where operational, technological and scientific improvements should be prioritized.

We retrospectively analyzed 67 consecutive myeloma patients receiving <b>autologous</b> stem <b>cell</b> transplantation after bortezomib and/or thalidomide based inductions. Totally 17 high-risk, 24 intermediate-risk, and 26 low-risk patients were enrolled, based on fluorescence in situ hybridization and ISS stage. Meanwhile, another 67 risk-, response depth-, and age-matched patients not proceeding to <b>autologous</b> stem <b>cell</b> transplantation were chosen as controls. Our preliminary data indicated that, in the high-risk subgroup, progression-free survival and overall survival were both significantly prolonged after <b>autologous</b> stem <b>cell</b> transplantation (P 0. 05), and in the low-risk subgroup, only progression-free survival was extended significantly (P= 0. 012) after <b>autologous</b> stem <b>cell</b> transplantation.

50|$|The {{cell type}} chosen for this {{technique}} {{depends on the}} desired application of the cell microcapsules. The cells put into the capsules can be from the patient (<b>autologous</b> <b>cells),</b> from another donor (allogeneic cells) or from other species (xenogeneic cells). The use of <b>autologous</b> <b>cells</b> in microencapsulation therapy {{is limited by the}} availability of these cells and even though xenogeneic cells are easily accessible, danger of possible transmission of viruses, especially porcine endogenous retrovirus to the patient restricts their clinical application, and after much debate several groups have concluded that studies should involve the use of allogeneic instead of xenogeneic cells. Depending on the application, the cells can be genetically altered to express any required protein. However, enough research has to be carried out to validate the safety and stability of the expressed gene before these types of cells can be used.|$|E

40|$|Mesenchymal {{stem cells}} are a {{potential}} therapeutic agent in renal disease and kidney transplantation. <b>Autologous</b> <b>cell</b> use in kidney transplantation is preferred to avoid anti-HLA reactivity; however, the influence of renal disease on mesenchymal stem cells is unknown. To investigate the feasibility of <b>autologous</b> <b>cell</b> therapy in patients with renal disease, we isolated these cells from subcutaneous adipose tissue of healthy controls and patients with renal disease and compared them phenotypically and functionally. The mesenchymal stem cells from both groups showed similar morphology and differentiation capacity, and were both over 90 % positive for CD 73, CD 105, and CD 166, and negative for CD 31 and CD 45. They demonstrated comparable population doubling times, rates of apoptosis, and were both capable of inhibiting allo-antigen- and anti-CD 3 /CD 28 -activated peripheral blood mononuclear cell proliferation. In response to immune activation they both increased the expression of pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory factors. These mesenchymal stem cells were genetically stable after extensive expansion and, importantly, were not affected by uremic serum. Thus, mesenchymal stem cells of patients with renal disease have similar characteristics and functionality as those from healthy controls. Hence, our results indicate the feasibility of their use in <b>autologous</b> <b>cell</b> therapy in patients with renal disease...|$|R

40|$|Autologous acute myeloid leukaemia (AML), cells {{caused the}} {{suppression}} of incorporation of 3 H-thymidine (3 H-Tdr) by remission lymphocytes stimulated with allogeneic cells. In five patients, <b>autologous</b> AML <b>cells</b> suppressed 3 H-Tdr uptake by lymphocytes stimulated with up to three different allogeneic cells. Responses to allogeneic AML cells were more strongly suppressed than responses to pooled allogeneic lymphocytes.

Suppression was absent from <b>autologous</b> AML <b>cells</b> exposed to ultraviolet light, or when untreated <b>autologous</b> AML <b>cells</b> were present in ratios of less than 1 : 1 to lymphocytes, or when added 24 or more hours after stimulation of remission lymphocytes with allogeneic cells.

50|$|This cell based {{articular}} cartilage repair procedure {{takes place in}} three stages. In a first stage, between 200 and 300 milligrams cartilage is sampled arthroscopically from a less weight bearing area from either the intercondylar notch or the superior ridge of the medial or lateral femoral condyle of the patient.

These cells are grown in vitro in a specialised laboratory for approximately four to six weeks, until there are enough cells to reimplant on the damaged area of the {{articular cartilage}}.
