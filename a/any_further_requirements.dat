40|$|We {{consider}} SU(2) -equivariant dimensional {{reduction of}} Yang-Mills-Dirac theory on manifolds {{of the form}} M × CP 1, with emphasis {{on the effects of}} non-trivial magnetic flux on CP 1. The reduction of Yang-Mills fields gives a chain of coupled Yang-Mills-Higgs systems on M with a Higgs potential leading to dynamical symmetry breaking, {{as a consequence of the}} monopole fields. The reduction of SU(2) -symmetric fermions gives massless Dirac fermions on M transforming under the low-energy gauge group with Yukawa couplings, again as a result of the internal U(1) fluxes. The tower of massive fermionic Kaluza-Klein states also has Yukawa interactions and admits a natural SU(2) -equivariant truncation by replacing CP 1 with a fuzzy sphere. In this approach it is possible to obtain exactly massless chiral fermions in the effective field theory with Yukawa interactions, without <b>any</b> <b>further</b> <b>requirements.</b> We work out the spontaneous symmetry breaking patterns and determine the complete physical particle spectrum in a number of explicit examples...|$|E

This {{result is an}} inductive characterisation of graphs with a unique perfect matching. Extending these techniques, we give a definition of multiplicative proof-nets in which commutativity but also associativity of the multiplicative connectives is interpreted as equality. This is done by representing a sequent by a cograph and axioms by a perfect matching. The main advantage of this presentation is aesthetic: any such graph, without <b>any</b> <b>further</b> <b>requirement</b> is a proof-structure and the correctness criterion also is a natural graph-theoretical property.

Except for this minimum permanence, the concept shifts {{may not have to}} satisfy <b>any</b> <b>further</b> <b>requirements</b> and may occur infinitely often. Within this work is studied to what extent it is still possible to predict or learn values for a data sequence produced by drifting concepts. Various ways to measure the quality of such predictions, including martingale betting strategies and density and frequency of correctness, are introduced and compared with one another. For each of these measures of prediction quality, for some interesting concrete classes, (nearly) optimal bounds on permanence for attaining learnability are established. The concrete classes, from which the drifting concepts are selected, include regular languages accepted by finite automata of bounded size, polynomials of bounded degree, and sequences defined by recurrence relations of bounded size. Some important, restricted cases of drifts are also studied, for example, the case where the intervals of permanence are computable. In the case where the concepts shift only among finitely many possibilities from certain infinite, arguably practical classes, the learning algorithms can be considerably improved...|$|E

Especially a real-time in-vivo navigation of medical catheter or endoscope without <b>any</b> <b>further</b> <b>requirements</b> (such as the continuous exposure to x-rays) could provide a huge advantage in countless areas in medicine. Multicore fibers or bundles of glass fibers have been suggested for realizing such shape sensors, but to date all suffer from severe disadvantages. We present the realization of a third approach. With femtosecond laser pulses local waveguides are inscribed into the cladding of a standard single mode glass fiber. The evanescence field of the main fiber core couples to two S-shaped waveguides, which carry the light to high reflective fiber Bragg gratings located approx. 30 mu m away from the centered fiber core in an orthogonal configuration. Part of the reflected light is coupled back to the fiber core and can be read out by a fiber Bragg grating interrogator. A typical spectrum is presented {{as well as the}} sensor signal for bending in all directions and with different radii. The entire sensor plane has an elongation of less than 4 mm and therefore enables even complicated and localized navigation applications such as medical catheters.

40|$|The neon {{triple point}} {{is one of}} the {{defining}} fixed points of the International Temperature Scale of 1990 (ITS- 90). Although recognizing that natural neon is a mixture of isotopes, the ITS- 90 definition only states that the neon should be of ‘natural isotopic composition’, without <b>any</b> <b>further</b> <b>requirements.</b> A preliminary study in 2005 indicated that most of the observed variability in the realized neon triple point temperatures within a range of about 0. 5 mK {{can be attributed to the}} variability in isotopic composition among different samples of ‘natural’ neon. Based on the results of an International Project (EUROMET Project No. 770), the Consultative Committee for Thermometry decided to improve the realization of the neon fixed point by assigning the ITS- 90 temperature value 24. 5561 K to neon with the isotopic composition recommended by IUPAC, accompanied by a quadratic equation to take the deviations from the reference composition into account. In this paper, the uncertainties of the equation are discussed and an uncertainty budget is presented. The resulting standard uncertainty due to the isotopic effect (k = 1) after correction of the calibration data is reduced to (4 to 40) μK when using neon of ‘natural’ isotopic composition or to 30 μK when using 20 Ne. For comparison, an uncertainty component of 0. 15 mK should be included in the uncertainty budget for the neon triple point if the isotopic composition is unknown, i. e. whenever the correction cannot be applied...|$|E

The method takes cognizance {{of the fact that}} the separable structure of the hybrid system constrains the evolution of system dynamics.

40|$|Mouse mammary {{tumor virus}} (MMTV) encodes a {{superantigen}} (SAg) that promotes stable infection and virus transmission. Upon subcutaneous MMTV injection, infected B cells present SAg to SAg-reactive T cells {{leading to a}} strong local immune response in the draining lymph node (LN) that peaks after 6 d. We have used the reverse transcriptase inhibitor 3 '-azido- 3 '-deoxythymidine (AZT) to dissect in more detail the mechanism of SAg-dependent enhancement of MMTV infection in this system. Our data show that no detectable B or T cell response to SAg occurs in AZT pretreated mice. However, if AZT treatment is delayed 1 - 2 d after MMTV injection, a normal SAg-dependent local immune response is observed on day 6. Quantitation of viral DNA in draining LN of these infected mice indicates that a 4, 000 -fold increase in the absolute numbers of infected cells occurs between days 2 and 6 {{despite the presence of}} AZT. Furthermore MMTV DNA was found preferentially in surface IgG+ B cells of infected mice and was not detectable in SAg- reactive T cells. Collectively our data suggest that MMTV infection occurs preferentially in B cells without SAg involvement and is completed 1 - 2 d after virus challenge. Subsequent amplification of MMTV infection between days 2 and 6 requires SAg expression and occurs in the absence of <b>any</b> <b>further</b> <b>requirement</b> for reverse transcription. We therefore conclude that clonal expansion of infected B cells via cognate interaction with SAg-reactive T cells is the predominant mechanism for increasing the level of MMTV infection. Since infected B cells display a memory (surface IgG+) phenotype, both clonal expansion and possibly longevity of the virus carrier cells may contribute to stable MMTV infection...|$|R
40|$|Bibliography: pages 111 - 124. The {{screening}} of a Rhodococcus gene bank in Escherichia coli {{lead to the}} discovery of a pigment-producing clone. Initial studies revealed a blue component and a pink component in bacterial pigment preparations and suggested that they were different from the prodigiosins and actinorhodins produced by other actinomycetes. This dissertation represents a further analysis of the genetics and biochemistry of pigment production, and the development of an insertional-inactivation cloning vector utilizing the Rhodococcus pigment gene. The DNA of the pigment-producing clone was analysed by restriction mapping and sequenced. A 'single Rhodococcus gene of 1. 1 kbp was found to be responsible for pigment production in E. coli. This gene had a putative ribosome binding site and coded for an enzyme of Mr 42, 560. Deletion analysis and in vitro transcription-translation experiments supported the hypothesis that pigment production in E. coli was due to a single enzyme. The gene and gene product did not show any similarity when compared with nucleotide and protein sequences in computer data bases. Evidence was obtained from bacterial studies that the pigment pathway involved the conversion of tryptophan to indole by tryptophanase of E. coli and then to the pigment by the action of the cloned Rhodococcus gene. The solubility properties of the pigment, TLC analysis and NMR and visible spectrophotometry supported the hypothesis that the blue pigment was indigo and that the red pigment was indirubin, an isomer of indigo. An insertional-inactivation cloning vector, pSLH 8, was developed containing the pigment gene as a marker. The advantages of this vector were that it produced pigmented colonies on LB agar plates without <b>any</b> <b>further</b> <b>requirement</b> for expensive substrates such as X-Gal,which is required by the pUC series of vectors, and it is capable of being used in any E. coli strain whereas the pUC plasmids require special mutant strains for the detection of recombinants...|$|R

40|$|The {{present study}} further characterizes the {{cellular}} mechanisms {{involved in the}} in vivo rejection of MHC class I-disparate skin allografts. Previously, we demonstrated that class I-specific rejection responses could result from collaborations between distinct populations of lymphokine-secreting T helper (Th) and lymphokine-responsive T effector (Teff) cells. In the present study, we have assessed the possibility that class I-specific rejection responses could also result from a second cellular mechanism involving a single population of dual- function Th/Teff cells {{that would not have}} <b>any</b> <b>further</b> <b>requirement</b> for cell-cell collaboration. Our experimental strategy was to determine the ability of MHC class I-allospecific T cells, in response to class I allodeterminants expressed on skin grafts, to provide help in vivo for activation of helper-dependent Teff cells. We found that class I anti- Kbm 1 -allospecific T cells would reject bm 1 skin allografts, but would not generate help for the activation of helper-dependent effector cells that were specific for third-party skin allografts (e. g., grafts expressing Kbm 6, Qa 1 a, or H-Y allodeterminants). This failure of anti- Kbm 1 T cells to provide help in response to bm 1 skin allografts was not due to an inability of lymphokine-secreting anti-Kbm 1 Th cells to recognize and respond in vivo to Kbm 1 allodeterminants expressed on skin, since lymphokine-secreting anti-Kbm 1 Th cells were specifically primed in animals engrafted with bm 1 skin allografts. Nor was any evidence found that this failure was due to active suppression of anti- Kbm 1 helper activity. Rather, we found that anti-Kbm 1 T cells consumed nearly all of the helper factors they secreted. Taken together, these results are most consistent with the in vivo activity of dual-function Th/Teff cells that consume the lymphokines they secrete. Thus, this study demonstrates that MHC class I-disparate skin allografts can be rejected by two mechanisms, depending on the ability of the allospecific Teff cell to secrete helper lymphokines. MHC class I- disparate grafts can be rejected by (a) class I-allospecific Teff cells that are unable to produce lymphokine but are responsive to exogenous T cell help; and (b) class I-allospecific dual-function Th/Teff cells that are able to both produce and consume soluble lymphokine...|$|R

40|$|Hong Kong is {{vulnerable}} to energy and economic security due to the heavy dependence on imported fossil fuels. Waste {{has also been a}} major environmental management problem due to the amount of rubbish produced every year but lacking the technology and capital to manage different types properly. The objective of the dissertation is to study the feasibility of the use of biofuel in Hong Kong by recycling local waste. Current government policies in Hong Kong and overseas are being investigated on the appropriateness for domestic use. Literature reviews and stakeholders’ questionnaires are accounted to analyse the adaptability and popularity of the biodiesel application. The methodology of the dissertation is to firstly examine literature reviews regarding biodiesel’s environmental aspect, technical efficiencies, economic aspect, government incentives and tax constraints. The consensus outcome of these researches advocated high popularity of biodiesel consumption and production in Europe and U. S. due to lower environmental impact, equivalent output efficiency and strong government support. Their successful implementation is a good example to improvise biodiesel domestically in Hong Kong. Secondly, interviews were conducted with Hong Kong’s limited stakeholders. Respondents such as Hong Kong International Airport, Hong Kong Jockey Club, Fairwood Fastfood MTR Maritime Square were interviewed as these participants have been the pioneers in Hong Kong by recycling waste into biodiesel. On the production side, two out of three bio-refineries in Hong Kong provided their business sustainability and feasibility comments to pursue a long term goal. The limitation on responses might be focused solely on a few peer groups, and not the appropriate stakeholders with proper sampling size. However, the results are concurrent that biodiesel {{is one of the best}} alternative energy in Hong Kong. The dissertation draws positive results based on the following factors. Biodiesel can diminish the tremendous cost on waste management and landfill dumping. Using local food waste and industrial wastes from restaurants and food factories as feedstock to produce biodiesel is positive. This will also minimise the heavy reliance on imported fossil fuels to diversify energy sources. Refuelling of biodiesel fuel can be performed in any gas stations with the use of the existing infrastructure without <b>any</b> <b>further</b> <b>requirement</b> of new investment. Nonetheless, in order to facilitate the use of biodiesel, incentives programmes initiated by Hong Kong Government and the biofuel producers have to coherently promote this alternative fuel. The conclusion states that Hong Kong is completely feasible to adopt the use of biodiesel in medium to heavy sized vehicles and vessels in the commercial sector. The environmental benefit of Hong Kong using biodiesel stood out compared to other form of renewable energy. published_or_final_versionEnvironmental ManagementMasterMaster of Science in Environmental Managemen...|$|R

The efficacy analysis was a means of assessing the ability of HBOC to eliminate the requirement for any allogenic RBC transfusions from the time of randomization through 28 days. Safety was evaluated by means of standard clinical trial methods. RESULTS: The two treatment groups were comparable for all baseline characteristics. Although all patients in the allogenic RBC group required at least one allogenic RBC transfusion, 13 of 48 patients (27 %; 95 % CI, 15 % to 42 %) in the HBOC group did not require any allogenic RBC transfusions. The only significant changes documented were a 15 % increase in mean arterial pressure and a three-fold peak increase in serum urea nitrogen concentration after HBOC. The complications were similar in both groups, with no allergic reactions.
