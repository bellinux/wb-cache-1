Legislation for its creation was first introduced in 1914, but it would not be until March 29, 1921, with the passing of the State Police Bill, that a statewide police force was created. Senator Clarence I. Case was {{the driving force behind the}} 1921 legislation, however, the person with the most impact on the organization was its first Superintendent Norman Schwarzkopf, Sr. Schwarzkopf was a graduate of West Point and this training and his time in the military heavily influenced how he organized and trained his first group of troopers.

40|$|BACKGROUND: It {{is clear}} that the chronic {{progression}} of diabetes, as well as other socio-environmental factors, act as barriers to individuals seeking to maintain employment. Long-term employment outcomes of people with diabetes can be improved by providing customized interventions to help individuals retain their current employment. OBJECTIVE: This investigation examined differential vocational rehabilitation (VR) service patterns between two groups of clients with diabetes, those who were employed at the time of application and those who were unemployed. METHODS: Quantitative descriptive research design using multiple discriminant analysis (MDS). Participants included 5, 427 individuals with diabetes whose VR cases were closed in Fiscal Year 2011. RESULTS: MDS revealed that the employed <b>applicants</b> <b>group</b> had higher propensities than the unemployed <b>applicants</b> <b>group</b> to receive assessment, diagnosis and treatment, counseling and guidance, rehabilitation technology, and on-the-job supports as part of the VR process. The unemployed <b>applicants</b> <b>group</b> had higher propensities to receive occupational/vocational training, job readiness, job placement, and other services. CONCLUSION: These differential service patterns suggest that the client's employment status at the inception of his or her VR program is taken into close consideration during the case planning and goal-setting phases of the VR process. Implications for future research and VR service delivery are discussed. Department of Rehabilitation Science...|$|R

40|$|Credit scoring {{methods are}} widely used for {{evaluating}} loan applications in financial and banking institutions. Credit score identifies if applicant customers belong to good risk <b>applicant</b> <b>group</b> or a bad risk <b>applicant</b> <b>group.</b> These decisions {{are based on the}} demographic data of the customers, overall business by the customer with bank, and loan payment history of the loan applicants. The advantages of using credit scoring models include reducing the cost of credit analysis, enabling faster credit decisions and diminishing possible risk. Many statistical and machine learning techniques such as Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines, Neural Networks and Decision tree algorithms have been used independently and as hybrid credit scoring models. This paper proposes an ensemble based technique combining seven individual models to increase the classification accuracy. Feature selection has also been used for selecting important attributes for classification. Cross classification was conducted using three data partitions. German credit dataset having 1000 instances and 21 attributes is used in the present study. The results of the experiments revealed that the ensemble model yielded a very good accuracy when compared to individual models. In all three different partitions, the ensemble model was able to classify more than 80 % of the loan customers as good creditors correctly. Also, for 70 : 30 partition there was a good impact of feature selection on the accuracy of classifiers. The results were improved for almost all individual models including the ensemble model...|$|E

It is not readily obvious whether this disparity is due to prejudice on the part of decisionmakers or due to applicant differences in meeting naturalization standards.

The model implies an empirical test for relative prejudice using average <b>applicant</b> <b>group</b> rejection rates. Using Switzerland as a case study, I apply the test to newly collected data from six large municipalities.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} project {{was to determine whether}} the Psychological Corporation Entrance Examination for Schools of Nursing is a valid instrument for predicting success in a nursing education diploma program. The study attempted to establish {{the extent to which the}} PCEE battery as a whole, and each of its subtests, discriminates between nursing applicants who are most and least likely to succeed in the nursing program. Success in nursing was defined in terms of the student’s academic performance in the nursing program and registration examinations. [...] The research involved a study of 296 nursing students who were accepted into a hospital school of nursing diploma program during the years 1967 - 70, inclusive. These students wrote the PCEE after admission into the school it was not included as part of the selection procedure. [...] Two main groups were originally identified from the total sample. The successful candidates were designated as the Validation Group, and the unsuccessful candidates as the Withdrawal Group. The Withdrawal Group was subsequently divided into two subgroups. Those who withdrew because of academic failure were called Academic Withdrawals. Those who withdrew for reasons other than academic were known as Non-academic Withdrawals. [...] A comparison of these three groups indicated a marked similarity between the Validation and Non-academic Withdrawal Groups on all thirteen subtests of the PCEE, while the Academic Withdrawals showed significantly lower scores on the Ability measures, but very little difference on the Personality measures. Based on this similarity, it was hypothesized that the Non-academic Withdrawal Group could be considered as potentially successful students. The Non-academic Withdrawals were consequently included in the Validation Group, forming a Composite Validation Group of 262 subjects. Comparisons were then made between the Composite Validation Group and Academic Withdrawal Group on the thirteen PCEE subtests. [...] The data from both groups were subjected to analysis of variance and discriminant analysis. The analysis indicated that the Composite Validation Group could be discriminated from the Academic Withdrawal Group on six of the seven Ability measures, and one of the six Personality measures. These seven statistically significant variables were considered to be the measures that would discriminate between potentially successful, and academically unsuccessful, candidates. The most important discriminants were the Scholastic Aptitude Total (SAT), Verbal Ability, Science, and Numerical Ability, accounting for about 96 percent of the between groups variance. [...] The efficiency of the discrimination was examined for two decision situations. The first decision situation minimized the total number of errors in classification without regard to the type of error being made. In this situation all the applicants passing the initial selection procedures were classified as successful. This would mean that all students in the Academic Withdrawal Group would be admitted to the school of nursing. No applicant would be rejected, and errors of classification would be made in 11. 6 percent of the cases considered in the total <b>applicant</b> <b>group.</b> The second decision situation was designed to minimize the false acceptance of applicants. In this situation a cutoff discriminant score was selected to ensure the rejection of 67 percent of the <b>applicant</b> <b>group</b> was incorrectly classified. [...] The results of this research project indicate that the PCEE does possess limited usefulness as an applicant screening instrument. The Personality measures are of little value in the selection process. The scores on the Academic Ability measures of the test, however, are of value in indicating which applicants are most likely to succeed in the nursing program. In general, students with low Ability scores are not good admission risks, while applicants who score high on the Ability measures are more likely to be successful in the nursing program and on registration examinations...|$|E

40|$|Because {{minorities}} typically fare {{poorly on}} standardized tests, job testing {{is thought to}} pose an equity-efficiency trade-off: testing improves selection but reduces minority hiring. We evaluate this trade-off using data from a national retail firm whose 1, 363 stores switched from informal to test-based worker screening. We find that testing yielded more productive hires raising median tenure by 10 percent and reducing the frequency of firing for cause. Consistent with prior research, minorities performed significantly worse on the test. Yet, testing had no measurable impact on minority hiring, and productivity gains were uniformly large among minorities and non-minorities. We show formally that these results imply that employers were effectively statistically discriminat-ing prior {{to the introduction of}} testing that is, their screening practices already accounted for expected productivity differences between <b>applicant</b> <b>groups.</b> Consequently, testing improved selection of both minority and non-minority applicants, but did not alter the racial composition of hiring...|$|R

30|$|Anonymous job {{applications}} {{appear as}} an attractive policy instrument to combat hiring discrimination. Nevertheless, {{they are very}} controversially discussed in the public debate. Our paper backs this discussion by reconsidering the available empirical evidence from field experiments testing anonymous job applications in Europe. Against this background, we discuss the potentials and limits of this approach. We particularly focus on novel evidence from an experiment organized by the German Federal Anti-Discrimination Agency. Results show that anonymous job applications can be practically implemented, but they also show that the method of implementation is crucial. Standardized application forms which are completed by the applicants appear as {{the most effective and}} efficient way to make applications anonymous. Results show moreover that with anonymous job applications, all <b>applicant</b> <b>groups</b> have the expected equal chances to receive an interview invitation in nearly all recruitment processes. When analyzing the effects of introducing anonymous job applications, we find that anonymous hiring can reduce discrimination—if discrimination is present beforehand. Anonymous hiring can also have no effects if no discrimination exists initially, and it can even prevent the employer from applying measures such as affirmative action, at least in the first stage of the hiring process.|$|R
30|$|In {{order to}} {{substantiate}} our {{finding that the}} DI program can explain little of the employment decline in the SIPP since the mid- 1990 s, we combine each 1996 wave (except for the first) with each 2004 wave and carry out the first decomposition. We then aggregate results into two sources of employment changes: the employment effect due to changes in DI beneficiaries and denied applicants (the first two terms in Equation  2), and changes in employment rates of non-applicants, beneficiaries, and denied applicants (the last three terms of Equation  2). This procedure yields 77 decompositions for the 1996 - 2004 comparison. For 66 out of 77 cases both the employment effect due to changes in DI beneficiaries and denied applicants and changes in employment rates of all <b>applicant</b> <b>groups</b> are negative. In eleven cases, the employment change is positive while the DI growth term is negative. As argued earlier, {{the results for the}} 2004 panel are likely to be confounded by much stronger changes in the percentage of men indicating a work limitation (see footnote 12). For those cases for which both differences are negative, the total employment effect never explains more than 50 percent of the overall employment decline.|$|R

In relation to the <b>applicants</b> and <b>group</b> members, between 19 and 22 November 2004, Detective Senior Sergeant Kitching committed unlawful discrimination, in contravention of section 9(1) of the Racial Discrimination Act, in submitting inaccurate information to the coroner, and in failing to supply relevant information to the coroner, for the purposes of the coronial investigation into the death of Cameron Doomadgee.4. In relation to the <b>applicants</b> and <b>group</b> members, the failure of any officer of the Queensland Police Service with appropriate command responsibilities, including Inspector Gregory Strohfeldt and Acting Assistant Commissioner Roy Wall, to suspend Senior Sergeant Hurley from active duty on Palm Island after the death of Cameron Doomadgee on 19 November 2004 constituted unlawful discrimination in contravention of section 9(1) of the Racial Discrimination Act.5. In relation to the <b>applicants</b> and <b>group</b> members, the failure of any officer of the Queensland Police Service with appropriate command responsibilities on Palm Island between 22 and 26 November 2004, including Inspector Brian Richardson and Senior Sergeant Roger Whyte, to communicate effectively with the Palm Island community and defuse tensions within that community relating to the death in custody of Cameroon Doomadgee, and the subsequent police investigation, constituted unlawful discrimination in contravention of section 9(1) of the Racial Discrimination Act.6. In relation to the <b>applicants</b> and <b>group</b> members, Detective Inspector Webber, in making at 1.45 pm on 26 November 2004 and continuing until 8.10 am on 28 November 2004 a declaration of an emergency situation under section 5 of the Public Safety Preservation Act 1986 (Qld) engaged in unlawful discrimination in contravention of section 9(1) of the Racial Discrimination Act.7. In using officers of the Special Emergency Response Team to carry out the arrest of the first applicant on 27 November 2004, officers of the Queensland Police Service with command responsibilities for the police operations on Palm Island at that time, including Detective Inspector Webber, Inspector Steven Underwood and Inspector Glenn Kachel, engaged in unlawful discrimination in contravention of section 9(1) of the Racial Discrimination Act.8. In using officers of the Special Emergency Response Team on 27 November 2004 to carry out the entry and search of the house of the first and third applicants, officers of the Queensland Police Service with command responsibilities for the police operations on Palm Island at that time, including Detective Inspector Webber, Inspector Underwood and Inspector Kachel, engaged in unlawful discrimination contrary to section 9(1) of the Racial Discrimination Act.9. In using officers of the Special Emergency Response Team on 27 November 2004 to carry out the entry and search of the house of the second applicant, officers of the Queensland Police Service with command responsibilities for the police operations on Palm Island at that time, including Detective Inspector Webber, Inspector Underwood and Inspector Kachel, engaged in unlawful discrimination contrary to section 9(1) of the Racial Discrimination Act.10. Pursuant to section 18A of the Racial Discrimination Act, the Racial Discrimination Act applies in relation to the first respondent as if the first respondent had engaged in the conduct of the officers of the Queensland Police Service referred to in paragraphs 1 to 9 above, and the first respondent is taken to have contravened section 9(1) of the Racial Discrimination Act in the manner there set out.″Justice Mortimer also ordered that the State of Queensland pay $95,000 in compensation to Lex Wotton, $10,000 to Agnes Wotton, and $115,000 to Cecilia Wotton. According to the Wottons' legal team, the judgment left the door open for potentially hundreds of claims for compensation by Aboriginal residents of Palm Island who were affected by the police conduct.|$|R
40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to give an empirically-based review of the {{strengths}} and weaknesses of situational judgment tests (SJTs). Design/methodology/approach – The features, history, and development of SJTs are discussed. Next, a computerized search (from 1990 - 2007) is conducted to retrieve empirical studies related to SJTs. The effectiveness of SJTs is discussed in terms of reliability, criterion-related validity, incremental validity, construct-related validity, utility, adverse impact, applicant perceptions, fakability, and susceptibility to practice and coaching effects. Findings – Strengths of SJTs are that they show criterion-related validity and incremental validity above cognitive ability and personality tests. SJTs have also less adverse impact towards minorities (especially if the cognitive loading of the SJT is low). Furthermore, applicant reactions towards SJTs are positive and SJTs enable to test large <b>applicant</b> <b>groups</b> at once (through the Internet). In terms of weaknesses, SJTs might be prone to faking, practice, and coaching effects. There is also debate about what constructs are measured by SJTs. Research limitations/implications – Five avenues for future research are discussed: construct-related validity of SJTs, utility of SJTs vis-à-vis other predictors, impact of SJT features on validity and adverse impact, examination of alternative stimulus and response formats, and cross-cultural transportability of SJTs. Practical implications – Practitioners receive evidence-based information about the features, development, and strengths and weaknesses of SJTs. Originality/value – Apart from the USA, SJTs have not made strong inroads in selection practice in Europe and other parts of the world. This evidence-based paper might highlight the value of SJTs...|$|R
40|$|Non Hodgkin’s lymphomas (NHLs) {{represent}} the 6 th most frequent cancer {{in men and}} women. Diffuse large B-cell lymphomas (DLBCLs) and follicular lymphomas (FLs) {{are the most common}} subtypes of all non-Hodgkin’s lymphomas. Despite they are considered indolent malignancies with a median overall survivall of approximately 10 years, FL represent an incurable and fatal disorder with nearly all patients dying of lymphoma, usually after histology transformation into the more aggressive DLBCL. Histological transformation occurs in 10 - 60 % of FL independently from the type of chemotherapy. Both FL and DLBCL are characterised by specific cytogenetic anomalies such as t(14; 18) involving the BCL 2 gene and promiscuous rearrangements of BCL 6 at 3 q 27. In addition these lymphomas may present a series of other different types of secondary genetic anomalies, mainly chromosomal changes but the clinical relevance of these anomalies is still unknown. The characterisation of the secondary chromosomal changes in both FL, DLBCL and in a selected series of transformed lymphomas may be helpful to understand the mechanisms of tumour progression and chemotherapy resistance and in addition may be relevant for cloning cancer genes involved in lymphomas transformation that are potential targets for gene-specific therapies. The <b>applicant</b> <b>groups</b> have characterised, with conventional and molecular cytogenetic approach, a series of 100 lymphomas including FL, DBLCL and a subset of serial samples from the same patients. Interestingly clonal secondary and specific chromosome changes have been identified involved both in transformation and in more aggressive lymphomas. In particular, chromosome rearrangements and deletions of 11 q 23 ->qter, 6 q 21 ->qter, 4 p 14 ->pter and 3 p 21 ->pter regions seems {{to be involved in the}} more aggressive and in the transformed lymphomas. The aim of this project is to characterise tumour genes mapping in the defined regions which contribute to the pathogenesis of DLBCL and to investigate the relationship between the expression profile of these genes and the clinical outcome. These goals will be carried out from the <b>applicant</b> <b>groups</b> using the following approaches:Genes identification in specific target regions (11 q 23 ->qter; 6 q 21 ->qter, 4 p 14 ->pter, 3 p 21) 1 -Characterisation using conventional and molecular cytogenetics of new cases of lymphomas and a series of lymphoma cell lines in order to identify anomalies involving the target regions. 2 -Characterisation of retrospective cases of lymphomas and lymphomas cell lines using a more sensitive cytogenetic technology (Multicolor FISH, in situ hybridisation with specific PAC and BAC probes and arrayCGH) in order to refine at molecular level the previously identified abnormalities and to define the candidate molecular regions. 3 -Identification of candidate genes mapping in the candidate regions. Gene expression analysis 1 - Gene expression studies will be performed on the serial samples from the same patients, to look for the changes in expression profiles induced by the additional genetic abnormalities. 2 - Gene expression studies will be performed on a selected series of samples based upon the data discovered with arrayCGH, that is cases showing particular genomic losses and amplifications to be compared with cases with no abnormalities. 3 - Mathematical models will be designed and applied to predict the genomic profile, based upon the expression profile, as well to correlate genomic and expression data. 4 - Expression data will be validated using real-time PCR and whenever possible immunohistochemistry on a larger series of samples. Correlation between expression and clinical outcome and therapeutic approachesAll the genomic and expression data will be correlated to clinical and follow-up data to define factors that might be associated with genetic progression and worse clinical outcome...|$|R
