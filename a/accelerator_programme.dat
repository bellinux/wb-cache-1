40|$|There are {{a growing}} number of <b>accelerator</b> <b>programmes</b> {{designed}} to start and support innovative startup businesses. Many accelerators are increasing the size of their intakes, with some programmes now launching over 200 new companies per year. On first inspection the large numbers and consistent approach taken to accelerating the participating companies appears to be in conflict with producing innovative and disruptive companies. This paper uses Y Combinator as a single case study to investigate whether increasing the number of companies within a batch has resulted in longer or shorter timeframes for companies to achieve an exit (through acquisition or initial public offering). The paper finds that the timeframe for achieving an exit for Y Combinator companies is reducing, even while batch size has sharply increased. There is no statistically significant correlation between the cohort size and the initial money raised during the programme.     Keyword : Accelerators, Startups, Innovatio...|$|R

40|$|Within the LAGUNA design study, seven {{candidate}} {{sites are}} being assessed for their feasibility {{to host a}} next-generation, very large neutrino observatory. Such a detector {{will be expected to}} feature within a future European <b>accelerator</b> neutrino <b>programme</b> (Superbeam or Beta Beam), and hence the distance from CERN is of critical importance. In this article, the focus is a ^ 18 Ne and ^ 6 He Beta Beam sourced at CERN and directed towards a 50 kton Liquid Argon detector located at the LAGUNA sites: Slanic (L= 1570 km) and Pyhäsalmi (L= 2300 km). To improve sensitivity to the neutrino mass ordering, these baselines are then combined with a concurrent run with the same flux directed towards a large Water Čerenkov detector located at Canfranc (L= 650 km). This degeneracy breaking combination is shown to provide comparable physics reach to the conservative Magic Baseline Beta Beam proposals. For ^ 18 Ne ions boosted to γ= 570 and ^ 6 He ions boosted to γ= 350, the correct mass ordering can be determined at Slanic for all δ when sin^ 22 θ_ 13 > 4 · 10 ^- 3 in this combination.

40|$|Direct mass {{measurements}} {{with typical}} uncertainties of 1 – 10 keV {{have been performed}} for the ﬁrst time for ten neutron-rich isotopes 102, 103 Y, 108 Nb, 111 Mo, 113, 114 Tc, 116 Ru, 119 Rh, and 121, 122 Pd. The obtained mass data compared with the 2003 atomic-mass evaluation shows systematic overestimation of binding energies far from stability. The relationship between two-neutron separation energies, nuclear structure and shape changes has been investigated by comparing the experimental data with a theoretical calculation based on the Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov approximation using modern energy density functionals.
