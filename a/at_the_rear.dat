5|$|A second, more {{traditional}} design followed {{for the initial}} batch of five unstreamlined locomotives (Nos. 6230–6234). Again they were of welded tank construction, but lacked any of the streamlining add-ons. Even without the streamlining Type 'B' tenders were distinguishable from Type 'A' by having a slightly different profile at the front and steps and handrails <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>rear.</b>|$|E

5|$|Directional {{stability}} {{was achieved}} by four fixed vanes, two vertical and two horizontal, attached <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>rear</b> of the gas-bag, and by a long vertical vane running along the main axis of the gas-bag from {{the centre of the}} elliptical frame to its rear. Horizontal motion was controlled by the movement of a balanced rudder <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>rear</b> of an empennage on a long boom, mounted below the gas-bag and aft of the gondola (see lead image). The empennage consisted of vertical and horizontal vanes arranged like the fletching of an arrow, behind which the vertical rudder was mounted. During a refit in 1907 the vertical vanes of the empennage were modified, as is shown in the accompanying illustration.|$|E

5|$|A former hearse {{house at}} the {{southeast}} corner of the churchyard dates from about 1833, and has been converted for use as an electricity sub-station. It is a rectangular single-story building of red sandstone with a quarry tile roof. The door opening at the front has a wide semicircular arch with a keystone and springing blocks, above which is a string course and a cornice with moulded eaves. On the west side and <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>rear</b> are small vents with semicircular heads and keystones. The hearse house is listed at GradeII.|$|E
5|$|A service ramp <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>rear</b> of the {{basement}} led to a sliding door that opened into an alley; the police found the door had been tampered with {{so it could be}} opened without unlocking it. Later examination found bloody fingerprints on the door, as well as a metal pipe that had been used as a crowbar. Some evidence at the crime scene was improperly handled by the police investigators: a trail in the dirt (from the elevator shaft) along which police believed Phagan had been dragged was trampled; the footprints were never identified.|$|E

Around the melting pit is a thin jacket full of warm water, heated by a powerful burner. The gases from the burner are bubbled through the water, causing some of the heated water to spill over into the melting pit, melting the snow instantly. The meltwater is discharged into the storm drains.|$|E

40|$|Application Number: 09 / 620031 Publication Date: 05 / 13 / 2003 Copyright 2003 FreePatentsOnline. com. An implant for {{insertion}} between vertebrae of the verterbral column {{having a}} substantially rectangular or trapezoidal cross-section and covering faces adapted {{to face the}} adjacent vertebrae which are porous and/or designed with a profile. The implant has such a width that it substantially covers <b>at</b> <b>the</b> maximum <b>the</b> <b>rear</b> half of <b>the</b> vertebrae facing the spinous process, preferably <b>at</b> <b>the</b> maximum <b>the</b> <b>rear</b> third of <b>the</b> vertebrae facing the spinous process, and such a length that it substantially covers <b>the</b> <b>rear</b> region of <b>the</b> vertebrae. The limiting surface of the implant facing {{the inside of the}} vertebrae and extending {{in the direction of the}} adjacent vertebrae is convex.

Both ships were assigned to positions <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>rear</b> of their squadrons and did not fire their guns during the Battle of Jutland on 31 May – 1 June 1916.|$|E

The main function of the blood may be to deliver nutrients.|$|E
5|$|Deal Castle {{continued}} {{to be used as}} a military fortification throughout the 18th century, and in 1728 it was equipped with 11 culverin guns. The following year, however, the captain, naval officer Sir John Norris, redeveloped the castle to improve his personal accommodation. Similar work had been carried out at Walmer in 1708 by the Duke of Dorset, Lionel Sackville, and there may have been some competition between the two men. The keep was redesigned with medieval-style battlements, and wood-panelled accommodation <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>rear</b> overlooking the sea; the porter's lodge was also updated.|$|E
