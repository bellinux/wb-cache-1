The pioneering work of Boult and the BBC SO included an early performance of Schoenberg's Variations, Op. 31, British premieres, including Berg's Wozzeck and Three Movements from the Lyric Suite, and world premieres, including Vaughan Williams's Symphony No. 4 in F minor. Anton Webern conducted eight BBC SO concerts between 1931 and 1936.|$|E
5|$|In {{response}} to Thio's {{point on the}} views of the Wee Chong Jin Constitutional Commission, Shanmugam said that at the time the report was rendered the electorate was immature <b>and</b> <b>unfamiliar</b> with the importance of voting, a result of the country's history of colonial rule. In contrast, the high voter turnout rates in every election since then evidenced that Singaporeans have realized this point. With regard to the Taw Cheng Kong case, Shanmugam stated that since the Court's observations were obiter, they were unlikely to be treated as setting a precedent.|$|E

5|$|The unique {{position}} of the Christians and Jews of the empire became increasingly apparent. The Jews had earned imperial toleration {{on account of the}} great antiquity of their faith. They had been exempted from Decius's persecution and continued to enjoy freedom from persecution under Tetrarchic government. Because their faith was new <b>and</b> <b>unfamiliar</b> and not typically identified with Judaism by this time, Christians had no such excuse. Moreover, Christians had been distancing themselves from their Jewish heritage for their entire history.|$|E

After being separated from the others, Sora and Riku defeat Xemnas, after which a doorway appears that allows them to reunite with their friends on Destiny Islands.|$|E
5|$|Although {{there are}} {{a wide range of}} {{attachment}} difficulties within the styles which may result in emotional disturbance and increase the risk of later psychopathologies, particularly the disorganized style, none of the styles constitute a disorder in themselves and none equate to criteria for RAD as such. A disorder in the clinical sense is a condition requiring treatment, as opposed to risk factors for subsequent disorders. Reactive attachment disorder denotes a lack of typical attachment behaviors rather than an attachment style, however problematic that style may be, in that there is an unusual lack of discrimination between familiar <b>and</b> <b>unfamiliar</b> people in both forms of the disorder. Such discrimination does exist as a feature of the social behavior of children with atypical attachment styles. Both DSM-IV and ICD-10 depict the disorder in terms of socially aberrant behavior in general rather than focusing more specifically on attachment behaviors as such. DSM-IV emphasizes a failure to initiate or respond to social interactions across a range of relationships and ICD-10 similarly focuses on contradictory or ambivalent social responses that extend across social situations. The relationship between patterns of attachment in the Strange Situation and RAD is not yet clear.|$|E

5|$|Discussions {{about making}} her sixth studio album being a Christmas record began on December 2012, {{a month after}} {{releasing}} her first greatest hits album, Greatest Hits – Chapter One. Having found {{the opportunity to do}} so, Clarkson commissioned producer and multi-instrumentalist Greg Kurstin, whom she had previously collaborated with on her albums Stronger and Greatest Hits – Chapter One, to solely produce the whole album. Despite having been raised in a Jewish faith <b>and</b> <b>unfamiliar</b> with Christmas songs, Kurstin still agreed to produce the project. As a result, the record marked the second time her studio album only had a single producer (the first being David Kahne solely producing My December in 2007). It also marked the fourth time Kurstin had solely produced an entire studio album apart from {{being a member of the}} musical groups The Bird and the Bee and Geggy Tah (the first three being Lily Allen's It's Not Me, It's You in 2009, Sia's We Are Born in 2010, and The Shins' Port of Morrow in 2012).|$|E

40|$|In two experiments, the {{empirical}} parsing of melodies was compared with predictions derived from four grouping preference rules of A Generative Theory of Tonal Music (F. Lerdahl & R.

In Experiment 1 (n = 123), listeners representing {{a wide range}} of musical training heard two familiar nursery-rhyme melodies <b>and</b> one <b>unfamiliar</b> tonal melody, each presented three times.

Experiment 2 (n = 33) repeated Experiment 1 with different stimuli: one familiar <b>and</b> one <b>unfamiliar</b> nursery-rhyme melody, <b>and</b> one <b>unfamiliar,</b> tonal melody from the classical repertoire. In all melodies of both experiments, there was good within-subject consistency of boundary placement across the three repetitions (mean r =. 54).

25|$|The {{national}} crisis was {{widely seen as}} being caused by foreign aggression. Foreign powers had defeated China in several wars, forced a right to promote Christianity and imposed unequal treaties under which foreigners and foreign companies in China were accorded special privileges, extraterritorial rights and immunities from Chinese law, causing resentment among the Chinese. France, Japan, Russia and Germany carved out spheres of influence, so that by 1900 it appeared that China would likely be dismembered, with foreign powers each ruling {{a part of the}} country. Thus, by 1900, the Qing dynasty, which had ruled China for more than two centuries, was crumbling and Chinese culture was under assault by powerful <b>and</b> <b>unfamiliar</b> religions and secular cultures.|$|E
25|$|The port prospered {{with trade}} from {{immediately}} after its opening. The initial trade consisted of exports supplied by Japanese merchants to foreign ones, and imports sold from foreign merchants to Japanese ones. This was because foreigners {{were not allowed}} to buy export goods or sell their own imports outside the settlement, while Japanese merchants lacked the know-how to conduct business directly with businessmen overseas. Japanese merchants trying to sell goods to foreigners or buy goods from them carried out their negotiations through intermediaries, either Japanese clerks or Chinese baiben. As many of the foreign merchants were high-handed and forceful in their negotiations, and the Japanese were unaccustomed to trading with foreign countries <b>and</b> <b>unfamiliar</b> with the state of the world outside Japan, Japanese merchants were frequently manipulated into buying and selling goods at disadvantageous prices.|$|E
