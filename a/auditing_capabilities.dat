The internal <b>audit</b> <b>capability</b> model comprises a comprehensive international guide to assist any public organisation's internal audit function to measure its capability in terms of the Institute of Internal Auditors' six elements of internal auditing.

However, for public sector internal auditing to effectively support management, the internal audit function (IAF) should be capable.

The Institute of Internal Auditors Research Foundation published the Internal <b>Audit</b> <b>Capability</b> Model (IA-CM) in 2009 to provide a capability self-assessment tool for public sector IAFs.

To achieve these objectives, the model was applied in a South African public sector organisation by means of a case study, where the IAF of the case was ranked against the key process areas (KPAs) of the model. The ranking was conducted based on a documentary review and interviews with applicable officials within the case. The model was successfully tested in measuring the internal <b>audit</b> <b>capability</b> level of a South African public sector organisation; however, a total of eight potential feasibility hindrances or considerations have been identified that could negatively affect the implementation of seven of the KPAs of the IA-CM.

40|$|The South African {{public sector}} faces {{significant}} challenges that impact on {{its ability to}} deliver services to the public. There are several parties that can assist the public sector in addressing these challenges. One of these is the internal audit functions of government organisations. For internal auditing to support effectively the managements of the government organisations they serve, the internal audit function should be sufficiently capable. The questions remain as to whether South African public sector internal audit functions are sufficiently capable and how internal <b>audit</b> <b>capability</b> can be measured. The Institute of Internal Auditors Research Foundation published the Internal <b>Audit</b> <b>Capability</b> Model (IA-CM) in 2009. The main purpose of the model is to provide a capability self-assessment tool for public sector internal audit functions. This model {{could be used as a}} yardstick in measuring public sector internal <b>audit</b> <b>capability</b> within South Africa, should the elements and key process areas (KPAs) of the model be applicable to the South African context. This study therefore aims to determine whether the IA-CM can be applied within a South African context. The South African public sector, the role of internal auditing within the South African public sector as well as the IA-CM as a tool of measuring public sector internal <b>audit</b> <b>capability</b> were investigated. A literature review was conducted on these topics, as a foundation for the study. Specific data was obtained on each of the KPAs of the IA-CM through a case study design by selecting an appropriate South African national department and ranking the case against the KPAs of the IA-CM. The ranking was conducted based on a review of relevant documents and interviews with applicable internal audit and management staff and audit committee members of the selected case. The study concludes that 82. 9 % of the KPAs of the IA-CM appear to be applicable within a South African context and that, in essence, the model can be applied within a South African context. However, eight hindrances that may negatively affect the feasibility of implementing the remaining 17. 1 % of the KPAs or certain components of these KPA’s, have been also been identified.

Current SCADA systems, however, do not have sufficient tailored electronic security solutions. Solutions available are developed primarily for information technology systems. Indeed the toolkit for SCADA incident prevention and response is unavailing as the operating parameters associated with SCADA systems are different from information technology systems. The unique environment necessitates tailored solutions.

The tool does not require any modifications to a SCADA system and can be implemented on a variety of platforms. These features, along with the ability to isolate the tool from production systems and adapt it to various architectures, make the tool attractive for use in diverse SCADA environments...|$|E
