5|$|Erin {{produced}} moderate winds across Newfoundland, {{including a}} maximum sustained wind report of 53mph (85km/h) with <b>a</b> <b>gust</b> of 67mph (108km/h) at Cape Race. The storm also produced moderate amounts of precipitation, peaking at 5.1inches (131mm) at Sagona Island. Along the coast, {{the passage of}} the storm led to wave heights of up to 30feet (9.3m), while offshore a buoy recorded a wave height of 47feet (14.2m). No damage was reported in Canada.|$|E
5|$|Intense rainbands {{spread across}} the state's eastern coastline; Hillsboro Inlet Light near Fort Lauderdale {{recorded}} sustained winds of 91mph (147km/h), and St. Augustine Light recorded <b>a</b> <b>gust</b> of 87mph (141km/h). Further inland, Jacksonville reported sustained winds of 72mph (116km/h) with gusts to 82mph (133km/h). In Jacksonville, Hurricane King left widespread power outages due to the winds knocking over trees and power lines. Street flooding was reported, and around 30families required evacuation due to the storm.|$|E
5|$|Most {{species have}} 12 ovules and 36 seeds, {{although}} some {{species such as}} N. bulbocodium have more, up {{to a maximum of}} 60. Seeds take five to six weeks to mature. The seeds of sections Jonquilla and Bulbocodium are wedge-shaped and matte black, while those of other sections are ovate and glossy black. <b>A</b> <b>gust</b> of wind or contact with a passing animal is sufficient to disperse the mature seeds.|$|E

The island of Roatán received <b>a</b> <b>gust</b> of 58mph (93km/h). Farther {{north and west}} in Belize, the Belize Zoo and Tropical Education Center—popular attractions for tourists—were heavily damaged. About 80% of the grapefruit and nearly 25% of the orange crop were lost there. Two deaths were observed: one man was killed when his boat capsized in rough seas, while a second man was mauled to death by a jaguar that escaped after a tree mangled its cage. The damage cost topped $80 million.|$|E
5|$|Cumulus {{supplementary}} features are most commonly {{seen with the}} species congestus. Cumulus virga clouds are cumulus clouds producing virga (precipitation that evaporates while aloft), and cumulus praecipitatio produce precipitation that reaches the Earth's surface. Cumulus pannus comprise shredded clouds that normally appear beneath the parent cumulus cloud during precipitation. Cumulus arcus clouds have <b>a</b> <b>gust</b> front, and cumulus tuba clouds have funnel clouds or tornadoes. Cumulus pileus clouds refer to cumulus clouds that have grown so rapidly as to force the formation of pileus {{over the top of}} the cloud. Cumulus velum clouds have an ice crystal veil over the growing top of the cloud.|$|E
5|$|Juan set {{an all-time}} maximum wind gust speed record at the Halifax Stanfield International Airport; {{during the peak}} of the storm, <b>a</b> <b>gust</b> reached 143km/h, a record which still stands to this day. Another high windspeed {{occurred}} at the McNabs Island autostation, which recorded a 2-minute sustained wind of 151km/h, with gusts to 176km/h. Hurricane-force gusts extended as far east as Beaver Island, where gusts reached 132km/h. The hurricane was strong enough to destroy the anemometers at Shannon Hill, Chebucto Head and Sambro Island, even though the Sambro Island instrument had survived a 193km/h storm some years earlier.|$|E

5|$|This cyclone brought {{widespread}} rain to Tamil Nadu as it formed {{and to the}} Andaman and Nicobar Islands as it moved over the Bay of Bengal. After its landfall it brought severe rains to West Bengal, Assam and East Pakistan. The highest recorded rainfall in India was at Shillong where 220mm (8.6inches) fell on October 24. <b>A</b> <b>gust</b> of 105km/h (65mph) was recorded in Calcutta as the storm passed by to the east, where it caused {{the failure of the}} power supply.|$|E
5|$|A broad area of low {{pressure}} formed at the tail-end of a stationary front, organizing into a tropical depression by 18:00UTC on October28 about 520mi (835km) south-southeast of Bermuda. Steered west-northwest and then sharply northeast ahead {{of an approaching}} cold front, the system intensified into Tropical Storm Shary six hours after formation. Within an environment of low wind shear, Shary strengthened into a hurricane and attained peak winds of 75mph (120km/h) by 00:00UTC on October30 as an eye became apparent on microwave imagery. The storm became increasingly asymmetric as it interacted with the front, and Shary transitioned into an extratropical cyclone by 18:00UTC that day. The extratropical system was completely absorbed by the front six hours later. Since Shary remained south and east of Bermuda, its effects were limited to 0.54in (13.7mm) of rainfall and <b>a</b> <b>gust</b> to 35mph (56km/h).|$|E
5|$|Around noon, as {{a result}} of poor {{coordination}} and signaling, the Swedish line unexpectedly turned toward the allied fleet. When the flagship Kronan came about in the maneuver it suddenly heeled over and began to take in water. According to master gunner Anders Gyllenspak, the sails were not reefed and the ship leaned over so hard that water flooded in through the lower gunports. As the ship was leaning over, <b>a</b> <b>gust</b> of wind pushed the ship on her side, bringing her masts and sails down in line with the surface of the sea. Shortly afterwards, the gunpowder store exploded and ripped the forward section of the starboard side apart. Kronan quickly lost buoyancy and sank, taking most of her 850-man crew with her.|$|E

5|$|As the mesocyclone lowers {{below the}} cloud base, {{it begins to}} take in cool, moist air from the {{downdraft}} region of the storm. The convergence of warm air in the updraft and cool air causes a rotating wall cloud to form. The RFD also focuses the mesocyclone's base, causing it to draw air from a smaller and smaller area on the ground. As the updraft intensifies, it creates an {{area of low pressure}} at the surface. This pulls the focused mesocyclone down, {{in the form of a}} visible condensation funnel. As the funnel descends, the RFD also reaches the ground, fanning outward and creating <b>a</b> <b>gust</b> front that can cause severe damage a considerable distance from the tornado. Usually, the funnel cloud begins causing damage on the ground (becoming a tornado) within a few minutes of the RFD reaching the ground.|$|E
5|$|During the storm's passage, {{there were}} 61daily {{rainfall}} records broken by Nabi's precipitation across Japan. The rains from Nabi caused significant slope failures and large accumulations of driftwood. The amount of sediment {{displaced by the}} rains was estimated at 4,456m3/km2, over four times the yearly average. A total of 630m3 (2,066ft3) of driftwood was recorded. However, the rainfall also helped to end water restrictions in Kagawa and Tokushima prefectures. In addition to the heavy rainfall, Nabi produced gusty winds on the Japan mainland, peaking at 115km/h (72mph) in Muroto. A station on Tobishima in the Sea of Japan recorded <b>a</b> <b>gust</b> of 119km/h (74mph). The typhoon spawned a F1 tornado in Miyazaki, which damaged several buildings. In Wajima, Ishikawa, Nabi produced a Foehn wind, causing temperatures to rise quickly.|$|E
5|$|Erika {{produced}} light rainfall across southern Texas, peaking at 3.83inches (97mm) in Sabinal, {{though most}} locations reported {{less than two}} inches (50mm) of precipitation. In addition, weather radar estimated isolated accumulations of 4 to 6inches (100 to 150mm) of precipitation in Kenedy and Brooks Counties. Sustained winds from Erika in south Texas peaked at 39mph (62km/h) in Brownsville, where <b>a</b> <b>gust</b> of 47mph (75km/h) was also recorded. Strong waves were reported northwards to Corpus Christi. The storm caused minor flooding and beach erosion along South Padre Island. Strong wind gusts of up to 60mph (95km/h) caused isolated, minor wind damage in south Texas, including in South Padre Island, where the winds damaged {{the roof of a}} business. The winds also uprooted a large tree and caused limb damage to several small- to medium-sized trees in Brownsville. In Texas, damage totaled to $10,000 (2003USD, $ USD).|$|E

5|$|Hurricane Erin {{developed}} from a tropical wave on September 1, and strengthened to a 60mph (95km/h) tropical storm {{as it moved}} to the west-northwest. After weakening due to wind shear, the remnants re-organized into a tropical depression the next day, and Erin strengthened into a hurricane on September 9 while moving northwestward. The hurricane quickly intensified and reached peak winds of 120mph (195km/h) later on September 9. A trough turned Erin to the northeast, and after passing just east of Cape Race, Newfoundland it became extratropical on September 15. The extratropical remnant continued northeastward and lost its identity near Greenland on September 17. Hurricane Erin brushed Newfoundland, producing a sustained wind of 53mph (85km/h) with <b>a</b> <b>gust</b> of 67mph (108km/h) at Cape Race. Along the coast, {{the passage of the}} storm led to wave heights of up to 30ft (9.3m).|$|E
5|$|In Nova Scotia, Able {{produced}} hurricane-force winds, {{the only}} land along its path to receive such winds; <b>a</b> <b>gust</b> of 99mph (160km/h) {{was reported in}} Halifax. The hurricane also dropped heavy rainfall, including over 4.92inches (125mm) in Annapolis Valley. Initially there were three fishing boats missing throughout the region, although two later returned to harbor. By August22, the third was still missing over the Grand Banks, which prompted a rescue team {{to search for the}} boat. Many other boats crashed against the coast, and two children died when their raft capsized. Two bridges and several roadways were washed out or flooded, and in Charlottetown, Prince Edward Island, floodwaters left roadways impassable. On land, Able produced heavy damage estimated at over $1million (CAD), half of which in Annapolis Valley, and split between crops, communications, and fishing industries.|$|E
5|$|On Grand Bahama Island, Wilma {{produced}} sustained {{winds of}} 155km/h (95mph) and <b>a</b> <b>gust</b> of 178km/h (111mph). The hurricane also produced a storm surge of over 3.7m (12ft), reportedly {{as high as}} 6.1m (20ft) along the southwestern portion of the island. The surge, which moved about 305m (1,000ft) inland, caused large-scale flooding that washed away or destroyed about 800homes. Damage was estimated at $100million (2005USD) on the western portion of the island. Excluding the southwestern region of Grand Bahama, {{the majority of the}} island reported minor wind damage, and the eastern end of the island reported little, or no, damage. Over 7,000people on the island were directly affected by the hurricane, many of whom had not fully recovered from hurricanes Frances and Jeanne during the previous year.|$|E
