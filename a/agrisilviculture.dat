40|$|The {{reclamation}} {{areas of}} the opencast coal mining in South Sumatera are predominantly compact and nutrient-poor, marginal sites, but have a high potential for cultivation of fast-growing trees and agricultural crops.  This paper aims to promote several models of agroforestry in the post-mined land in South Sumatera as a new strategy in reclaiming degraded soil properties for both enviroment and economic purposes.   About 5, 000 ha of coal mining areas were observed to characterize the landscape and soil properties in the area, then overlaid with the landuse maps of post-mining plans issued by the company.   Results showed that about 1, 730 ha of the reclamation areas was suitable for agroforestry while the rest was for utilities, camping ground, water pond and grassland.   Three models were proposed for the agroforestry areas, including (i) <b>agrisilviculture</b> model (1, 190 ha), (ii) silvihorticulture model (203 ha), and (iii) local-species collection model for agrihortisilviculture (337 ha).   Prior to the agroforestry establishment, all reclamation sites were subjected to the revegetation with fast-growing trees and other rejuvenation treatments in order to restore favour soil and microclimate conditions.   The proposed components for each model were as follows: for <b>agrisilviculture</b> model were cultivation on the alley cropping system of trees and food crops, for silvihorticulture model were the plantation of fruit trees in the bench of water pond, and for local-species collection model for agrihortisilviculture were the cultivation of local forest and food crop species...|$|E
40|$|Glycans are macromolecules (O-glycosidic and N-glycosidic linkage of monosacharides) {{which can}} be {{extracted}} from various agricultural products (i. e. cellulose, lignin, starch, insect). Preliminary data indicate that glycans can stimulate inflammation without initiating an anti-inflammatory feedback loop. Notwithstanding, inhibition of immune response by anti-inflammatory cytokines is {{a major cause of}} cancer therapy failure in human. The goal of the project is to study the ability of glycans to modulate the functions of macrophages and dendritic cells in order to stimulate anti-tumor immune response. The project aims to assess this hypothesis in a high incidence cancer: Malignant Pleural Mesothelioma. Glycan extracts will be isolated from a variety of agroforestry resources and especially broadleaved trees of the different systems tested on the platform AgricultureIsLife (zones 1 - 3 : hedges, tree lines, <b>agrisilviculture,</b> short rotation coppice) and modified by physical, chemical, enzymatic or microbiotic approaches.

30|$|Agroforestry {{systems in}} India {{include the use}} of trees grown on farms, {{community}} forestry and a variety of local forest management and ethnoforestry practices (Pandey, 1998). The Indian Council of Agricultural Research has classified systems used in different agro-climatic zones as silvipasture, <b>agrisilviculture</b> or agrihorticulture based on irrigated or rain-fed conditions. The practice of growing scattered trees on farmland is quite old. These trees are used for shade, fodder, fuelwood, food and medicinal purposes. Eucalypts and poplars are also grown in fields or on farm boundaries in the Punjab and Haryana. Traditional agroforestry systems include such practice of growing trees on farmlands used for fodder, fuelwood and vegetables etc. along with shifting cultivation in the Northeast India and Taungya cultivation. The Taungya 2 cultivation system is used in Kerala, West Bengal, and Uttar Pradesh and to a limited extent in Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh, Orissa, Karnataka, {{as well as in the}} Northeast hill regions. In addition, home gardens, tea plantation, wood lots and alder (Alnus spp.) -based agriculture are other kinds of agroforestry systems prevailing in India.|$|E

To solve these problems, in the region upstream of Bengawan Solo, enforced by Agroforestry plantings. Research carried out at the upstream of Bengawan Solo Wonogiri and Laboratory of Chemistry and Fertility of Soil Faculty of Agriculture, Sebelas Maret University Surakarta, in June 2013 until March 2014. Research used a survey method by descriptive and exploratory. Determination of {{the location of the}} site sample is done by a stratified random sampling based onland map unit. Sampling was done by a purposive sampling method. The soil quality index is determined by summing the scores for each variable which has selected from Principal Component Analysis (PCA), and then it multiplied by the weight index. The result of the study show that the soil quality of Agroforestry in the upstream of Bengawan Solo Wonogiri based on the chemical properties of the soil is low. The value of soil quality index in the secondary forest is 2. 6. While in the Agrosilvopastoral is 2. 3 and in the <b>Agrisilviculture</b> is 2. 1, which are lower than the secondary forest.

40|$|Data on {{earthworm}} surface cast {{deposition in}} undisturbed, cropped and recovering sites from West and Central Africa were compiled {{to assess the}} effects of land use system (LUS) change and if casting {{can be used to}} indicate soil quality. Annual cast deposition in undisturbed systems was significantly higher on Alfisols (49, 000 kg ha 1) than on Ultisols (25, 000 kg ha 1). Vegetation clearance had significant detrimental effects on earthworm activity. With an increasing length of continuous cropping, cast deposition declined. In young fallows, cast production exceeded levels attained in previously un-cropped controls on Alfisols, yet, on Ultisols, it depended on the previous LUS and length of the previous cropping phase. Recovery was highest after <b>agrisilviculture</b> and after clearing bush fallow. After forest clearance, burning and one year cropping, cast deposition did not recover within three years. On Alfisols, cast production was higher under planted tree fallow and natural fallow than under herbaceous fallow. On Ultisols, fallow type had no effect. Earthworm surface cast production contributes to soil quality. However, its suitability as an indicator of soil quality is limited to rough assessments as it is dependent upon earthworm species composition, vegetation management and soil type, with more drastic changes on the poorer Ultisols than the morefertile Alfisols.

40|$|This {{research}} {{aimed to}} determine pattern of agroforestry system and agroforestry spesies???s structure and composition. This {{research was conducted}} in January to February 2009 in village of Makuang, Regency of Mamasa. It was decided to establish four categories of Sub Village (dusun) area based on the preliminary survey and field orientation namely dusun 1, 2, 3, dan 4. Method used to set up those categories was Purposive Sampling in which there were 6 plots established for measurement of structure and species composition in each dusun. The size of plot was 20 x 50 m or 0. 1 ha. Tree height was measured and species name was recorded to identify the structure and composition of plant species. Herbarium was made for those plant species that have not identified. The research showed that pattern of agroforestry system practiced by farmer community was <b>Agrisilviculture</b> and Silvopasture with irregular, rows, alternate rows, and border pattern. The vertical structure of agroforestry system was relatively similar namely consisted of four stratums, but species composition and crops arrangement was different for all agroforestry patterns. While the species composition were 18 species at irregular pattern, 13 species at rows pattern, 4 species at alternate rows pattern, and 8 species at border pattern area...|$|E

The aboveground biomass ranged between 124.56 and 254.99  t ha−[*] 1 and carbon stock ranged from 60.09 to 121.43  t ha−[*] 1 across the study area. At Poplar (Populus deltoides) agroforestry system in Yamunanagar and Saharanpur districts of Northwestern India, biomass production and carbon stock were estimated by Rizvi et al. (2011). The contribution of Poplar plantation to carbon storage was found 27 – 32  t ha−[*] 1 in boundary system, whereas it was 66 – 83  t ha−[*] 1 in <b>agrisilviculture</b> system at rotation period of 7  years in the two districts. They also concluded that Poplar plantations may {{play a significant role}} in atmospheric CO 2 assimilation. In the Eastern Himalayas, North-East India, Gogoi et al. (2017) estimated carbon stock of rain forest using suitable regression equations, and they found highest stock (306.61 [*]±[*] 17.14  Mg C ha−[*] 1) in least disturbed site. Moderately distributed and highly distributed site showed 169.91 [*]±[*] 2.59  Mg C ha−[*] 1 and 102.43 [*]±[*] 3.18  Mg C ha−[*] 1, respectively. They also attributed that carbon sequestration is impacted by anthropogenic disturbances in forest ecosystems. Niirou and Gupta (2017) reported tree carbon stock ranging from 25.59  t ha−[*] 1 to 164.81  t ha−[*] 1 and basal area from 10.13  m 2  ha−[*] 1 to 92.04  m 2  ha−[*] 1, in Oak- and Pine-dominant forests using regression equation models at Senapati district of Manipur, India.|$|E

40|$|Graduation date: 1996 In an <b>agrisilviculture</b> system, {{trees and}} crops compete for {{above and below}} ground resources. This study aimed at {{quantifying}} the effect of shoot pruning and root barriers around pollarded trees on the production of crop and tree components with and without application of fertilizer to the crop. Sorghum (1991 & 1992) and cowpea (1993 & 1994) were grown as intercrops with Lezicaena trees on a shallow red soil (alfisol) under rain fed conditions at Hyderabad, India. Crops grown with pruned trees had higher leaf area index and dry matter than did those with unpruned trees. The grain yield of sorghum was 76 % and 39 % of the pure crop yield (1553 kg ha⁻¹) with pruned and unpruned trees with no root barriers. The corresponding values for cowpea were 49 % and 26 % of the pure crop yield (1075 kg ha⁻¹). Intercropped sorghum and cowpea responded to fertilizer application more strongly than their respective pure crops, suggesting a need for fertilizer application in an agrisilvi-system. impact of root bamers was not significant on either crop. The study suggested that competition for light was stronger than for soil water. Straw and grain yield of sorghum, and dry matter yield of cowpea {{were found to be}} roughly proportional to the amount of light intercepted by the crop at harvest. Pruning of trees twice during the cropping season reduced tree diameter growth and branch and foliage yield compared to no pruning. Unpruned trees yielded 5643 kg ha⁻¹ yr⁻¹ of branches and foliage compared to 2028 kg ha⁻¹ yr⁻¹ by pruned trees. Pruning eliminated litter fall and nutrient input to the soil nutrient pool because pruned material was utilized as fodder. Unpruned trees contributed 103 kg of nitrogen and 6. 4 kg of phosphorus per hectare annually to the soil nutrient pool through litter fall. During the cropping season, soil water content was higher near the surface in tree plots compared to pure crop plots. Tree transpiration declined only after {{more than half of the}} leaf area was removed. Pruning of roots to a depth of 60 cm caused no decline in transpiration suggesting trees can draw water equally well from deeper or shallow soil layers. The study highlighted the competitive interaction between trees and crops. The agrisilvi-system produced about 50 % more biomass with unpruned trees than with pure crop or pure tree. Based on cash value (fodder yield equivalent) it would require 1. 55 times as much land if trees and crops were grown separately compared to agrisilvi-system with unpruned trees. Soil nitrogen economy and stability of fodder and fuelwood production can be achieved with pollarded-unpruned leucaena trees in an agrisilvi-system but grain crop yields are severely depressed. Thus, there was little advantage of the agrisilvi-system over pure cropping for meeting the present and increasing demand of food production. For this agrisilvi-system to be adopted by subsistence farmers in India further refinements must be developed so that crop yields are maintained...|$|E
