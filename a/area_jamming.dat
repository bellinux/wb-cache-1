30|$|If all <b>jam</b> <b>areas</b> {{distribute}} in a same group, each <b>jam</b> <b>area</b> {{will surely}} select an unblocked area to reuse the same sub resource pool so that resource blocks are wasted.

30|$|Numtotal is {{the total}} number of <b>jam</b> <b>areas,</b> and ⌈ ⌉ is the top {{integral}} function. In Fig. 9, the Num is equal to 2 obviously. In other words, every group is going to contain two <b>jam</b> <b>areas</b> in this example.|$|R
30|$|For guaranteeing the {{universality}} of the simulation, the number of <b>jam</b> <b>areas</b> is increased to 5 and we choose the areas 1, 3, 6, 12, and 13 to become <b>jam</b> <b>areas</b> instead. The PRR of DGRSA and other geo-based algorithms is calculated again.|$|R
40|$|Abstract—The {{wireless}} medium used by sensor networks {{makes it}} easy for adversaries to launch jamming attacks that can block communication. In order to bypass the <b>jamming</b> <b>area,</b> tree-based routing protocols need to reconstruct the tree, a path or choosing new parent which is time consuming. In addition, bypassing congests the nodes at the border of the <b>jamming</b> <b>area.</b> In this paper, we present and implement a recovery algorithm based on a weighted backpressure function that bypasses the <b>jamming</b> <b>area</b> by spreading the congestion over a large subset of the sensor nodes, while no tree reconstruction and mapping of the <b>jamming</b> <b>area</b> are needed. As future work, we will implement and simulate our recovery algorithm using the IPv 6 Routing Protocol for Low-power and Lossy Networks (RPL). I...|$|R

30|$|After that, {{the breadth}} first search (BFS) is used to ensure areas in the same group close to each other. The BFS is a common search {{strategy}} of the connected graph and it searches nodes in a radial way from a start point. So, {{we have to decide}} a start point of BFS, four corners of the abstracted graph are ideal candidates. Meanwhile, in order to search for more <b>jam</b> <b>areas</b> in our method, one of the four corners is determined based on the distribution of <b>jam</b> <b>areas.</b> A simple voting system is built. Every <b>jam</b> <b>area</b> has four votes for the four corners. The distance between a <b>jam</b> <b>area</b> and a corner is closer, the value of the vote is larger.

30|$|All in all, {{this method}} will {{classify}} all of areas into two same-sized groups {{during the process}} of BFS, and the number of <b>jam</b> <b>areas</b> in each group is roughly equal.|$|R
30|$|By the way, the <b>jam</b> <b>areas</b> in Fig.  15 are {{concentrated}} so that traffic congestion is extremely serious especially when {{quite a lot}} of VUEs are deployed in the scene. In this situation, VUEs near from each other in <b>jam</b> <b>areas</b> will achieve a similar result once they detect the average received energy on resource blocks in EGRSA or SGRSA. Collisions among these VUEs take place because all of these VUEs are likely to select a resource block which has relatively low energy based on the similar result. Therefore, the PRR of EGRSA and SGRSA decreases and is lower than the PRR of RGRSA when the communication distance is less than 50 m in Fig.  18.|$|R
30|$|If a <b>jam</b> {{geographic}} <b>area</b> and an unblocked {{geographic area}} are mapped {{into the same}} sub resource pool. The unblocked area which has lesser VUEs does not need such many resource blocks {{with respect to the}} <b>jam</b> <b>area.</b> So, resource wasting still exists.|$|R
30|$|Besides, the <b>jam</b> <b>areas</b> in Fig.  19 are dispersive, {{which is}} {{different}} {{with those in}} Fig.  15. The PRR of EGRSA and SGRSA is not lower than the PRR of RSRSA in Fig.  22 because traffic congestion is relatively assuasive when {{quite a lot of}} VUEs are deployed.|$|R
30|$|The {{number of}} VUEs in a <b>jam</b> <b>area</b> {{may be much}} larger than the amount of {{resource}} blocks in the corresponding sub resource pool. The resource blocks are not enough, so collisions are bound to be generated in this situation {{no matter what kind of}} algorithm is performed.|$|R

25|$|Interstate 45 gained notoriety during Hurricane Rita in 2005. Thousands of Houston <b>area</b> {{evacuees}} <b>jammed</b> {{the roadway}} trying to leave.

Four-hour drives suddenly became 24-hour drives. Even though the Texas Department of Transportation started contraflow lane reversal at FM 1488, it did not alleviate the traffic jam deep into the city, as that starting point was even north of The Woodlands, which is close to Conroe, the northern terminus of the greater Houston area.|$|R
30|$|When we set {{the weight}} between nodes to {{calculate}} optimal matching result, the weight for distance makes the areas which {{are close to}} each other cannot become the geographic pair so that the problem of hidden node is addressed.

30|$|We {{deal with}} a {{technical}} issue of assembling a ring part into a shaft part with the clearance of several micrometers by using a robotic manipulator. This issue is difficult because of deformation of a ring part compared with peg-in-hole assembly. We propose a precise assembly method of a ring part with finger shape to solve this issue. We also propose a method to decide design parameters of the finger by maximizing a closed <b>area</b> in <b>Jamming</b> diagram, which represents a successful condition of assembling rigid parts by quasi-static force analysis. Finally, availability of the proposed method is verified by an experiment of ring assembly with a robotic hand attached to the designed fingers.|$|R

40|$|International audienceMost of {{the recent}} {{research}} about airports has considered them in their role as points within airline networks,and the focus has been generally on hub airports. But airports are also places offering many similarities with cities, particularly with edge cities. They are places of human diversity and job centers for surrounding <b>areas.</b> Traffic <b>jams</b> are common on ground facilities as they are on taxiways, runways and airways. Often divided in specialized districts, such as cargo warehousing, hotel rows, rental car parking lots or office clusters, they are also urban organisms exerting strong demands on the local environment. In the post 9 - 11 era, their importance for economic activities and their high visibility make them ideal targets for terrorism, because the flow of visitors cannot be entirely controlled This paper will present the way the administrators of a major international airport deal with these urban characteristics, with a special focus on the management of ground traffic around and inside CDG airport's limits...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Traffic {{congestion}} is {{a widespread}} epidemic that continually wreaks havoc in urban <b>areas.</b> Traffic <b>jams,</b> car wrecks, construction de-lays, and other causes of congestion, can turn even the biggest highways into a parking lot. Several congestion mitigation strategies are being stud-ied, many focusing on micro-simulation of traffic to determine how mod-ifying road structures will affect the flow of traffic and the networking perspective of vehicle-to-vehicle communication. Vehicle routing on a net-work of roads and intersections can be modeled as a distributed constraint optimization problem and solved using a range of centralized to decentral-ized techniques. In this paper, we present a constraint optimization model of a traffic routing problem. We produce congestion data using a sinu-soidal wave pattern and vary its amplitude (saturation) and frequency (vehicle waves through a given intersection). Through empirical evalua-tion, we show how a centralized and decentralized solution each react to unknown congestion information that occurs after the initial route plan-ning period...|$|R

30|$|Besides, the DGRSA shows a {{crushing}} resistance {{to a large}} degree when Figs.  16, 17, and 18 are compared together. With increasing the total amount of VUEs from 600 to 1200 in the interval of 300, the EGRSA, SGRSA, and RGRSA sharply decrease in PRR. However, the DGRSA keeps fine performance even if the amount of VUEs is increased to 1200. This can be explained that <b>jam</b> <b>areas</b> will be matched in pair in spite of the VUEs’ growing total amount, and these geographic area pairs are allocated with more resource blocks. The efficiency of resource blocks rises up in DGRSA.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{simulation of}} WiMAX based system under jamming. The {{performance of the}} system was found out to greatly differ {{with the use of}} different jamming signals, allowing central areas to be identified, where system devel-opment should be focused on. In addition, from the basic theory point of view, rather surprising results were also found. This work should give a clear picture of how the studied WiMAX system performs under jamming as well as without jamming. The results show that some forms of interference degrade the performance of the system rapidly, thus the form of incoming jamming should be known and considered before deploying the system. Single carrier jamming and multi–carrier jamming are discussed here. The issues related to jamming and jamming reduction techniques are also covered. Jamming can destroy communication in the targeted <b>area.</b> Multi–carrier <b>jamming</b> is challenge in WiMAX because WiMAX is having OFDM based physical layer.

40|$|We {{study the}} jamming {{transition}} of two-dimensional point-to-point traffic through cooperative mechanisms using computer simulation. We propose two decentralized cooperative mechanisms which {{are incorporated into}} the point-to-point traffic models: stepping aside (CM-SA) and choosing alternative routes (CM-CAR). Incorporating CM-SA is to prevent a type of ping-pong jumps from happening when two objects standing face-to-face want to move in opposite directions. Incorporating CM-CAR is to handle the conflict when more than one object competes for the same point in parallel update. We investigate and compare four models mainly from fundamental diagrams, jam patterns {{and the distribution of}} cooperation probability. It is found that although it decreases the average velocity a little, the CM-SA increases the critical density and the average flow. Despite increasing the average velocity, the CM-CAR decreases the average flow by creating substantially vacant <b>areas</b> inside <b>jam</b> clusters. We investigate the jam patterns of four models carefully and explain this result qualitatively. In addition, we discuss the advantage and applicability of decentralized cooperation modeling.
