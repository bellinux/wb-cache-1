40|$|Salmonella typhimurium, as well {{as other}} enteric bacteria, {{experiences}} significant fluctuations in H ' ion concentrations during growth in diverse ecological niches. In fact, some pH conditions which should kill cells rapidly, such as stomach acidity, are nevertheless tolerated. The complete mechanism for this tolerance is unknown. However, I have recently demonstrated that S. typhimurium has the ability to survive extreme low pH (pH 3. 0 to 4. 0) if first adapted to mild pH (pH 5. 5 to 6. 0). This phenomenon has been referred to as the acidifiction tolerance response (ATR). The exposure to mild acid is referred to as preshock, and the proteins involved are called preshock ATR proteins. A second type of encounter with acid, called <b>acid</b> <b>shock,</b> involves shifting cells directly from alkaline conditions (pH 7. 7) to acid conditions (pH 4. 5 or below). During <b>acid</b> <b>shock,</b> the organism immediately ceases reproduction and dramatically changes the expression of at least 52 proteins. All but four are distinct from the preshock ATR proteins. Surprisingly, <b>acid</b> <b>shock</b> alone did not afford significant protection against strong acid challenge in minimal medium. Furthermore, inhibiting protein synthesis prior to <b>acid</b> <b>shock</b> revealed that the <b>acid</b> <b>shock</b> proteins do not appear to contribute to acid survival in minimal medium even at pH 4. 3. Constitutive cellular pH homeostatic mechanisms seem sufficient to protect cells at this pH.

In the current work, B. cereus cells were grown in anaerobic chemostat culture at external pH (pHe) 7. 0 or 5. 5 and at a growth rate of 0. 2 h - 1. Population reduction and internal pH (pHi) after <b>acid</b> <b>shock</b> at pH 4. 0 was examined either with or without ATPase inhibitor N,N’-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (DCCD) and ionophores valinomycin and nigericin. Population reduction after <b>acid</b> <b>shock</b> at pH 4. 0 was strongly limited in cells grown at pH 5. 5 (acid-adapted cells) compared with cells grown at pH 7. 0 (unadapted cells), indicating that B. cereus cells grown at low pHe were able to induce a significant ATR and Exercise-induced increase in ATPase activity. However, DCCD and ionophores had {{a negative effect on}} the ability of B. cereus cells to survive and maintain their pHi during <b>acid</b> <b>shock.</b> When <b>acid</b> <b>shock</b> was achieved after DCCD treatment, pHi was markedly dropped in unadapted and acid-adapted cells. The ATPase activity was also significantly inhibited by DCCD and ionophores in acid-adapted cells. Furthermore, transcriptional analysis revealed that atpB (ATP beta chain) transcripts was increased in acid-adapted cells compared to unadapted cells before and after <b>acid</b> <b>shock.</b> Our data demonstrate that B. cereus is able to induce an ATR during growth at low pH. These adaptations depend on the ATPase activity induction and pHi homeostasis.

For instance, transit through the stomach was characterized by up-regulation of genes that encode products that are involved in the use of nitrite as a terminal electron acceptor and down-regulation of genes that are involved in capsular polysaccharide expression.

40|$|The {{response}} of Salmonella typhimurium to low pH includes a low-pH protection system called the acid tolerance response (ATR). The iron-regulatory protein Fur has {{been implicated in}} the ATR since fur mutants are acid sensitive and cause altered expression of several <b>acid</b> <b>shock</b> proteins (J. W. Foster, J. Bacteriol. 173 : 6896 - 6902, 1991). We have determined that the acid-sensitive phenotype of fur mutations is indeed due to a defect in Fur that can be complemented by a fur(+) -containing plasmid. However, changes in cellular iron status alone did not trigger the ATR. Cells clearly required exposure to low pH in order to induce acid tolerance. The role of Fur in acid tolerance was found to extend beyond regulating iron acquisition. A mutation in fur converting histidine 90 to an arginine (H 90 R) eliminated Fur-mediated iron regulation of enterochelin production and deregulated an iroA-lacZ fusion but {{had no effect on}} acid tolerance.

40|$|Enterobacteria have {{developed}} numerous {{constitutive and inducible}} strategies to sense and adapt to an external acidity. These molecular responses require dozens of specific <b>acid</b> <b>shock</b> proteins (ASPs), as shown by genomic and proteomic analysis. Most of the ASPs remain poorly characterized, and {{their role in the}} acid response and survival is unknown. We recently identified an Escherichia coli gene, asr (<b>acid</b> <b>shock</b> RNA), encoding a protein of unknown function, which is strongly induced by high environmental acidity (pH < 5. 0). We show here that Asr is required for growth at moderate acidity (pH 4. 5) {{as well as for the}} induction of acid tolerance at moderate acidity, as shown by its ability to survive subsequent transfer to extreme acidity (pH 2. 0). Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and Western analysis of acid-shocked E. coli cells harboring a plasmid-borne asr gene demonstrated that the Asr protein is synthesized as a precursor with an apparent molecular mass of 18 kDa. Mutational studies of the asr gene also demonstrated the Asr preprotein contains 102 amino acids. This protein is subjected to an N-terminal cleavage of the signal peptide and a second processing event, yielding 15 - and 8 -kDa products, respectively. Only the 8 -kDa polypeptide was detected in acid-shocked cells containing only the chromosomal copy of the asr gene. N-terminal sequencing and site-directed mutagenesis revealed the two processing sites in the Asr protein precursor. Deletion of amino acids encompassing the processing site required for release of the 8 -kDa protein resulted in an acid-sensitive phenotype similar to that observed for the asr null mutant, suggesting that the 8 -kDa product plays an important role in the adaptation to <b>acid</b> <b>shock.</b> Analysis of Asr:PhoA fusions demonstrated a periplasmic location for the Asr protein after removal of the signal peptide.

40|$|Background: Escherichia coli have an optimum pH {{range of}} 6 - 7 {{for growth and}} {{survival}} that′s why, called neutrophiles. The ∆pH across the cytoplasmic membrane is linked to cellular bioenergetics and metabolism of the body which is the major supplier of the proton motive force, so homeostasis of cellular pH is essential. When challenged by low pH, protons enter the cytoplasm; as a result, mechanisms are required to alleviate the effects of lowered cytoplasmic pH. Materials and Methods: The activities of Succinate dehydrogenase, isocitrate dehydrogenase, malate dehydrogenase and glucose- 6 -phosphate dehydrogenase in <b>acid</b> <b>shocked</b> cells of E. coli DH 5 α and E. coli W 3110 subjected to pH 3, 4, and 5 by two types of acidification, like external (using 0. 1 N HCl), external along with the monensin (1 μM) and cytoplasmic acidification using the sodium benzoate as an acid permeant (20 mM) which is coupled to the electron transport chain by the reducing power, as yet another system possessed by E. coli as an armor against harsh acidic environments. Result: Results showed that an exposure to acidic environment (pH 3, 4 and 5) {{for a short period}} of time increased the activities of these dehydrogenases in all types of acidification except cytoplasmic acidification, which shows that higher recycling of reducing power results in pumping out of protons from the cytoplasm through the electron transport chain complexes, thereby restoring the cytoplasmic pH of the bacteria in the range of 7. 4 - 7. 8.

40|$|Although Salmonella typhimurium prefers neutral-pH environments, it {{can adapt}} to survive {{conditions}} of severe low-pH stress (pH 3. 3). The process, termed the acid tolerance response (ATR), includes two distinct stages. The first stage, called pre-acid shock, is induced at pH 5. 8 and involves {{the production of}} an inducible pH homeostasis system functional at external pH values below 4. 0. The second stage occurs following an <b>acid</b> <b>shock</b> shift to pH 4. 5 or below and is called the post-acid shock stage. During {{this stage of the}} ATR, 43 <b>acid</b> <b>shock</b> proteins (ASPs) are synthesized. The present data reveal that several ASPs important for pH 3. 3 acid tolerance are only transiently produced. Their disappearance after 30 to 40 min of pH 4. 4 <b>acid</b> <b>shock</b> coincides with an inability to survive subsequent pH 3. 3 acid challenge. Clearly, an essential feature of inducible acid tolerance is an ability to synthesize these key ASPs. The pre-acid shock stage, with its inducible pH homeostasis system, offers the cell an enhanced ability to synthesize ASPs following rapid shifts to conditions below pH 4. 0, an external pH that normally prevents ASP synthesis. The data also address possible signals for ASP synthesis. The inducing signal for 22 ASPs appears to be internal acidification, while external pH serves to induce 13 others. Of the 14 transient ASPs, 10 are induced in response to changes in internal pH. Mutations in the fur (ferric uptake regulator) locus that produce an Atr- acid-sensitive phenotype also eliminate induction of six transiently induced ASPs...|$|E

The unicellular green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii is the premier experimental model system for studying such cellular processes. When acid shocked, C. reinhardtii excises its flagella, rapidly and coordinately activates transcription of a set of flagellar genes, and ultimately regenerates a new flagellar pair. To define functionally the regulatory sequences that govern induction of the set of genes after <b>acid</b> <b>shock,</b> we analyzed the a 1 -tubulin gene promoter. To simplify transcriptional analysis in vivo, we inserted the selectable marker gene ARG 7 on the same plasmid with a tagged a 1 -tubulin gene and stably introduced it into C. reinhardtii cells. By deletion of various sequences, two promoter regions (2176 to 2122 and 285 to 216) were identified as important for induction of the tagged a 1 -tubulin gene. Deleting the region between 2176 and 2122 from the transcription start site resulted in an induction level which was only 45 to 70 % of that of the resident gene. Deleting the region upstream of 256 resulted in a complete loss of inducibility without affecting basal expression.

Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium possesses two general forms of inducible acid tolerance. One is evident in exponentially growing cells exposed to a sudden <b>acid</b> <b>shock.</b> The other is induced when stationary-phase cells are subjected to a similar shock. These log-phase and stationary-phase acid tolerance responses (ATRs) are distinct in that genes identified as participating in log-phase ATR have little to {{no effect on the}} stationary-phase ATR (I.

An insertion mutagenesis strategy designed to reveal genes associated with acid-inducible stationary-phase acid tolerance (stationary-phase ATR) yielded two insertions in the response regulator gene ompR. The ompR mutants were defective in stationary-phase ATR but not log-phase ATR. EnvZ, the known cognate sensor kinase, and the porin genes known to be controlled by OmpR, ompC and ompF, were not required for stationary-phase ATR. However, the alternate phosphodonor acetyl phosphate appears to {{play a crucial role in}} OmpR-mediated stationary-phase ATR and in the OmpR-dependent acid induction of ompC.

The data also revealed that <b>acid</b> <b>shock</b> increases the level of ompR message and protein in stationary-phase cells.

Here we demonstrate that H. pylori strain 26695 increases the transcription and activity of its urease, amidase, and formamidase enzymes four- to ninefold in response to growth at pH 5. 5. Supplementation of growth medium with NiCl 2 resulted in a similar induction of urease activity (at low NiCl 2 concentration) and amidase activity (at ≥ 500 μM NiCl 2) but did not affect formamidase activity. Mutation of the fur gene, which encodes an iron-responsive repressor of both amidases, resulted in a constitutively high level of amidase and formamidase activity at either pH but did not affect urease activity at pH 7. 0 or pH 5. 5. In contrast, mutation of the nikR gene, encoding the nickel-responsive activator of urease expression, resulted in a significant reduction of acid-responsive induction of amidase and formamidase activity. Finally, acid-responsive repression of fur transcription was absent in the H. pylori nikR mutant, whereas transcription of the nikR gene itself was increased at pH 5. 5 in wild-type H. pylori.

40|$|Salmonella typhimurium {{encounters}} {{a variety of}} acid stress situations during growth in host and nonhost environments. The organism can survive potentially lethal acid conditions (pH < 4) if it is first able to adapt to mild or more moderate acid levels. The molecular events that occur during this adaptive process are collectively {{referred to as the}} acid tolerance response and vary depending on whether the cells are in log- or stationary-phase growth. The acid tolerance response of logarithmically growing cells includes the participation of an alternate sigma factor, sigmaS (RpoS), commonly associated with stationary-phase physiology. Of 51 <b>acid</b> <b>shock</b> proteins (ASPs) induced during shifts to pH 4. 4, 8 are clearly dependent on sigmaS for production (I. S. Lee, J. Lin, H. K. Hall, B. Bearson, and J. W. Foster, Mol. Microbiol. 17 : 155 - 167, 1995). The <b>acid</b> <b>shock</b> induction of these proteins appears {{to be the result of}} an acid shock-induced increase in the level of sigmaS itself. We have discovered that one component of a potential signal transduction system responsible for inducing rpoS expression is the product of the mouse virulence gene mviA+. MviA exhibits extensive homology to the regulatory components of certain two-component signal transduction systems (W. H. Benjamin, Jr., and P. D. Hall, abstr. B- 67, p. 38, in Abstracts of the 93 rd General Meeting of the American Society for Microbiology 1993, 1993). Mutations in mviA (mviA::Km) caused the overproduction of sigmaS and sigmaS-dependent ASPs in logarithmically growing cells, as well as increases in tolerances to acid, heat, osmolarity and oxidative stresses and significant decreases in growth rate and colony size. Mutations in rpoS suppressed the mviA::Km-associated defects in growth rate, colony size, ASP production, and stress tolerance, suggesting that the effects of MviA on cell physiology occur via its control of sigmaS levels. Western blot (immunoblot) analyses of sigmaS produced from natural or arabinose-regulated promoters revealed that <b>acid</b> <b>shock</b> and MviA posttranscriptionally regulate sigmaS levels. Turnover experiments suggest that MviA regulates the stability of sigmaS protein rather than the translation of rpoS message. We propose a model in which MviA or its unknown signal transduction partner senses some consequence of <b>acid</b> <b>shock,</b> and probably other stresses, and signals the release of sigmaS from proteolysis. The increased concentration of sigmaS drives the elevated expression of the sigmaS-dependent ASPs, resulting in an increase in stress tolerance.

The presence of chloramphenicol negated the heat shock response and production of GroES and GroEL, confirming that de novo protein synthesis was involved in cell protection. These proteins were also identified in stationary phase cells grown under non-controlled pH, suggesting their involvement in induced thermotolerance during growth at low pH. Very few studies have investigated the response of stationary phase cells. The evaluation development of the response to sub-lethal stresses {{as a function of}} the pH conditions during growth is a new insight;. In fact, it was demonstrated that the pH of growth is a crucial factor...|$|E
40|$|Listeria monocytogenes is a {{foodborne}} {{bacterial pathogen}} {{that has been}} isolated from various natural and urban environments during different seasons and {{has been shown to}} persist in food processing environments. L. monocytogenes has the ability to grow at refrigeration temperatures and is therefore a danger to makers and consumers of ready-to-eat (RTE) food products, as these foods are not subjected to a heating step prior to consumption. During transmission from the environment through foods to humans, L. monocytogenes must adapt to a range of environmental conditions including varying temperature, preservative stress, gastric stress, and host immunological defenses. Mechanisms of environmental adaptation in L. monocytogenes include two-component response regulators (RRs), alternative sigma factors, and other positive (e. g., PrfA) and negative (e. g., CtsR) transcriptional regulators. We characterized the effects of L. monocytogenes growth temperature on (i) the contributions to in vitro host cell invasion of 14 RRs, alternative sigma factor [sigma][EXP]B, virulence regulator PrfA and surface associated proteins InlA and FlaA and (ii) the response to sudden <b>acid</b> <b>shock.</b> Overall, invasion was higher for L. monocytogenes grown at 30 [DEGREE]C compared to 37 [DEGREE]C. RR mutants "cheY and "degU were invasiondeficient when grown at 30 [DEGREE]C, but not 37 [DEGREE]C. We observed 37 [DEGREE]C-growth-dependent functional synergisms between !B and PrfA in contributing to host cell invasion and contributory synergisms between FlaA and InlA at both temperatures. Bacteria grown at 37 [DEGREE]C were more resistant to HCl <b>acid</b> <b>shock</b> (pH 3. 5) than cells grown at 7 [DEGREE]C. For cells grown at 37 [DEGREE]C, the transcriptional response to acid treatment involved the induction of genes with prior implication in acid response and intracellular survival, whereas the response of 7 [DEGREE]C-grown cells involved the induction of two large operons of bacteriophage genes, which may explain the increased survival of 37 [DEGREE]C grown cells. Our data show that growth temperature affects regulation of host cell invasion and the response to <b>acid</b> <b>shock,</b> which are both vital stages in L. monocytogenes transmission. Therefore, growth temperature should be considered an important variable in modeling L. monocytogenes stress survival and virulence...|$|E
40|$|Bacillus cereus is a {{ubiquitous}} Gram-positive organism, which frequently causes foodborne illnesses. The widespread {{prevalence of}} B. cereus {{makes it a}} common contaminant in fresh foods where it also can cause spoilage. To prevent food-borne diseases and food spoilage, foods are often processed and/or preserved. In recent years, consumers’ preferences have directed to fresher and tastier foods and this has acted as a driver for food industry to use milder processing and preservation techniques. Examples of hurdles {{that can be applied}} to preserve foods are low pH and the addition of organic acids. B. cereus may overcome these adverse conditions by displaying an adaptive stress response. The response of B. cereus upon exposure to these hurdles was investigated using two model strains, ATCC 14579 and ATCC 10987. Comparative analysis revealed numerous strain-specific genes and differences in metabolic capacities, including a urease encoding gene cluster in ATCC 10987 and a nitrate respiration cluster in ATCC 14579. A survey including ATCC 10987 and 48 environmental and outbreak-associated isolates revealed urease activity, i. e., the conversion of urea in ammonia and carbon dioxide, to be present in 10 isolates. However, the activity appeared to be too low to contribute to acid resistance in the strains tested. To search for other acid resistance mechanisms, comparative phenotype and transcriptome analyses of strains ATCC 14579 and ATCC 10987 cells exposed to organic and/or inorganic <b>acid</b> <b>shocks</b> were performed. Upon exposure to low pH with or without the addition of lactic acid or acetic acid, common acid resistance mechanisms and induction of the nitrate reductase cluster in the more acid resistant strain ATCC 14579 were revealed. Furthermore, a major oxidative response was displayed, which included the induction of several oxidative stress related genes and the production of inactivation-associated reactive oxygen species (ROS), such as hydroxyl radicals, peroxynitrite, and superoxide. ROS were detected using fluorescent probes in combination with flow cytometry, including a newly developed method using a specific probe that enables superoxide detection in Grampositive and Gram-negative bacteria. The formation of ROS was also shown upon exposure to heat and was found to be oxygen dependant. Correspondingly, assessment of B. cereus stress survival capacity revealed increased heat- and acid-resistance with cells grown and exposed to stresses in the absence of oxygen. The excess ROS may originate from stressinduced dysfunction of the aerobic electron transfer chain, which was indicated by the induction of alternative electron transfer chain components upon exposure to organic and inorganic <b>acid</b> <b>shocks.</b> Upon exposure to stress, superoxide is generated through the premature leakage of electrons to oxygen at sites in the electron transfer chain at elevated rates. Subsequently, superoxide may promote the formation of other ROS, which can cause cellular damage leading to cell death. The induction of oxidative stress related genes has been reported in numerous other studies involving a wide range of bacteria exposed to different adverse conditions. However, a clear relation between the formation of ROS and the applied environmental stress was up to now not established. Secondary oxidative responses, including the formation of ROS, are possibly common bacterial responses to severe stresses under aerobic conditions. This thesis describes genomic differences between B. cereus strains and the acid stress response of these strains on transcriptome and phenotype levels, including measurements of intracellular ROS. The findings in this study can contribute to further understanding of bacterial stress responses and secondary oxidative responses. Furthermore, the results obtained may aid to optimize and select (combinations of) stresses to apply in hurdle technology, thus enabling design of safe, milder food processing and preservation techniques...|$|R
40|$|Four {{groups of}} dogs were studied; a control group, a group which had an i. v. {{injection}} of 0. 035 milliliter/kg of oleic acid; a group subjected to moderate shock for one hr; {{and a group}} that was subjected {{to a combination of}} moderate shock and i. v. injection of 0. 035 milliliter/kg of oleic acid. Prior to injury and every 30 min for 2 hr, followed by every one hr for 4 hr, lung mechanics, respiratory work, shunt fraction, and cardiac output were determined. These studies were repeated on days 1 and 2 after injury. The arterial pO 2 values were not significantly different in the control and experimental groups on any studies during the experimental day. On day 3, arterial pO 2 values were significantly depressed in both the oleic and the <b>shock</b> plus oleic <b>acid</b> groups. The shunt fraction was significantly elevated only on the final determination in the oleic <b>acid</b> and <b>shock</b> group. Compliance fell and respiratory work increased in all experimental groups but were unchanged in the control group. The dogs that suffered the combined insults of oleic <b>acid</b> injection and <b>shock</b> showed a more profound fall in compliance than did those in the other experimental groups. These findings point to the greater sensitivity of measurements of respiratory mechanics than blood gas studies in indicating early changes in lung function. They also suggest that shock aggravates the injury to the lungs when produced by injection of fatty acids. SCOPUS: ar. jinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|R

40|$|Brucella abortus is a facultative, intracellular, {{pathogenic}} bacterium that replicates within macrophages and resists macrophage microbicidal mechanisms. To study gene expression and to elucidate the defense mechanisms used by B. abortus to resist destruction within macrophages, protein synthesis by B. abortus was examined by pulse-labeling techniques during intracellular growth within J 774 A. 1, a macrophage-like cell line. Prominent changes observed include increased synthesis of Brucella proteins with estimated molecular masses of 62, 28, 24, and 17 kDa. The 62 -kDa protein was identified by immunoprecipitation analysis as Hsp 62, a GroEL homolog. A protein of 60 kDa was expressed during <b>acid</b> <b>shock</b> and {{may represent a}} modified form of Hsp 62. The 28 - and 17 -kDa proteins have not been observed under any in vitro stress condition and presumably represent macrophage-specific induction. The 24 -kDa protein comigrates with an unidentified protein induced by <b>acid</b> <b>shock,</b> designated Asp 24. Expression of Asp 24 is optimal at pH values below 4. 0 and within the first 3 h following a shift from pH 7. 3 to 3. 8. This corresponds directly with a period of optimal bacterial survival at a reduced pH and suggests an active role for this protein in resistance to such environments. The identification of these gene products and the mechanisms controlling their expression {{is an important step}} in understanding the resistance of Brucella spp. to intracellular destruction within macrophages...|$|E
40|$|Our working {{hypothesis}} is that the major molecular chaperones DnaK and GroE play central roles {{in the ability of}} oral bacteria to cope with the rapid and frequent stresses encountered in oral biofilms, such as acidification and nutrient limitation. Previously, our laboratory partially characterized the dnaK operon of Streptococcus mutans (hrcA-grpE-dnaK) and demonstrated that dnaK is up-regulated in response to <b>acid</b> <b>shock</b> and sustained acidification (G. C. Jayaraman, J. E. Penders, and R. A. Burne, Mol. Microbiol. 25 : 329 – 341, 1997). Here, we show that the groESL genes of S. mutans constitute an operon that is expressed from a stress-inducible ςA-type promoter located immediately upstream of a CIRCE element. GroEL protein and mRNA levels were elevated in cells exposed to a variety of stresses, including <b>acid</b> <b>shock.</b> A nonpolar insertion into hrcA was created and used to demonstrate that HrcA negatively regulates the expression of the groEL and dnaK operons. The SM 11 mutant, which had constitutively high levels of GroESL and roughly 50 % of the DnaK protein found in the wild-type strain, was more sensitive to acid killing and could not lower the pH as effectively as the parent. The acid-sensitive phenotype of SM 11 was, at least in part, attributable to lower F 1 F 0 -ATPase activity. A minimum of 10 proteins, in addition to GroES-EL, were found to be up-regulated in SM 11. The data clearly indicate that HrcA {{plays a key role in}} the regulation of chaperone expression in S. mutans and that changes in the levels of the chaperones profoundly influence acid tolerance...|$|E

We therefore propose arginine decarboxylase as a possible transducer of the various initially received tropistic stimuli in plants.
