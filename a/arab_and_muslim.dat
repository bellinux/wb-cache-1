50|$|Stereotypes of <b>Arabs</b> <b>and</b> <b>Muslims</b> in the United States {{have been}} {{presented}} in various forms by the mass media in the American culture. Stereotypical representations of Arabs are often manifested in a society's media, literature, theater and other creative expressions. These representations, which have been historically and predominantly negative, have adverse repercussions for <b>Arab</b> Americans <b>and</b> <b>Muslims</b> in daily interactions and in current events. In American textbooks, which theoretically should be less-creative expressions, similar negative and inaccurate stereotypes are also found for <b>Arabs</b> <b>and</b> <b>Muslims.</b>|$|R

40|$|This {{research}} investigates {{variation in}} hate crime offending against <b>Arabs</b> <b>and</b> <b>Muslims</b> across U. S. coun-ties {{in the months}} before and after September 11, 2001. Four questions are of particular interest. First, what were the determinants of anti-Arab <b>and</b> <b>Muslim</b> hate crimes prior to 9 / 11 ? Second, in what social contexts were <b>Arabs</b> <b>and</b> <b>Muslims</b> at greatest risk of victimization? Third, to what extent did hate crimes against these groups increase after the terrorist attacks? And last, did the predictors of hate crimes against <b>Arabs</b> <b>and</b> <b>Muslims</b> change appreciably after 9 / 11 ? Findings show that hate crimes targeting <b>Arabs</b> <b>and</b> <b>Muslims</b> increased dramatically in the months following 9 / 11, although the structural determinants and geographic concentration of these crimes remained largely consistent after the attacks. Negative binomial regression results further suggest that counties with larger concentrations of <b>Arabs</b> <b>and</b> <b>Muslims</b> have higher incidents of such hate crimes, which likely reflects the availability of targets for this type of offending. At the same time, the likelihood of victimization for a given Arab or Muslim person is lowest in counties where the percent Arab or percent Muslim is highest, in line with a power-differential perspective on discrimination and intergroup violence. The findings imply that terrorist attacks may indeed incite retaliation and set off a wave of hate crime offending, but the location of these crimes is likely to remain consistent after a galvanizing event.

25|$|Immigration of Holocaust {{survivors}} and Jewish refugees from Arab lands doubled Israel's population {{within one year}} of its independence. Over the following years approximately 850,000 Sephardi and Mizrahi Jews fled or were expelled from surrounding mostly due persecution in Arab countries, and in smaller numbers from Turkey, India, Afghanistan, and Iran. Of these, about 680,000 settled in Israel (see also Jewish exodus from <b>Arab</b> <b>and</b> <b>Muslim</b> countries).|$|E

25|$|While {{there were}} antisemitic {{incidents}} before the twentieth century, antisemitism increased dramatically {{as a result}} of the Arab–Israeli conflict. After the 1948 Arab–Israeli War, the Palestinian exodus, the creation of the state of Israel, and Israeli victories during the wars of 1956 and 1967 were a severe humiliation to Israel's opponents—primarily Egypt, Syria and Iraq. However, by the mid 1970s the vast majority of Jews had left <b>Arab</b> <b>and</b> <b>Muslim</b> countries, moving primarily to Israel, France and the United States.

25|$|Whether {{there was}} {{significant}} <b>Arab</b> <b>and</b> <b>Muslim</b> immigration into Palestine during the 19th and 20th centuries, {{especially after the}} beginning of Zionist settlement there in the late 19th century has {{become a matter of}} some controversy. It is known that the Arab population of Palestine doubled during the British Mandate era, from 670,000 in 1922 to over 1.2 million in 1948, and there has been considerable debate over the subject on how much of this growth was due to natural increase, as opposed to immigration. Estimates on the scope of Arab immigration to Palestine during this period vary.|$|E
