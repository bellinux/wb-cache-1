40|$|It is {{well known}} that REMs are strong oxide and {{sulphide}} formers that can easily form large clusters which have harmful effect on the casting process as well as the quality of the final steel product. By adding these elements right before casting, the number of narrow transfer parts are eliminated (compared to if added in ladle) Also, the REM inclusions has less time to sinter together to form large clusters, preventing clogging. The general idea behind this alloying method in the continuous casting machine is to feed a wire of FeSiRE powder blend, coated with a metal strip, into the melt in the chilled Cu mold (CC mold) Adding REMs to the steel, in particular Ce, can increase the resistance to oxidation at high temperatures by improving the properties of the chromia layer. This is of big interest for SANDVIK as it can improve their corrosion resistant grades and may also, in the future, enable alloying in with other volatile elements such as Zr. This master thesis has the objective to find out the dissolution time of the wire, coated with three different metal strips; Steel, Cu and Al. The experiments were performed with steel grade 316 L, provided by SMT, in a 2 kg melt in a lab scaled induction furnace at 1500 oC, 1510 oC and 1530 oC. The operations were performed both with and without FeSiRE powder inside. The results obtained with powder inside at 1500 oC showed that the Al wire experienced the shortest dissolution time (0, 5 to 1 s) followed by Cu (≤ 10 s) and Steel (18 to 20 s). In addition to this, sampling procedures was implemented (1, 1, 3, 5 10 and 29 mins after wire addition) in a depth of 40 mm for each wire. Here, the yield of Ce 1 minute after wire addition was highest for the Steel wire (41. 9 %) followed by Cu wire (25 %) and Al wire (< 14. 8 %). From samples taken 1 and 5 mins after wire addition in the Al wire experiment, inclusions were extracted and collected on a film filter after electrolytic extraction and filtration. The film filter was observed in SEM. The morphology and compositions were analysed and compared. It was found that Ce and La was present as Ce La oxy sulfides both individually and on <b>Al</b> <b>Mg</b> <b>O</b> clusters...|$|E

As {{it is important to}} establish the long-term safety and efficacy of treatments for a chronic disease such as OA, the present study compared the effects of lumiracoxib at doses of 100 <b>mg</b> once daily (<b>o.</b> d.) and 100 mg twice daily (b. i. d.) with those of celecoxib 200 <b>mg</b> <b>o.</b> d. on retention on treatment over 1 year. Methods In this 52 -week, multicentre, randomised, double-blind, parallel-group study, male and female patients (aged at least 40 years) with symptomatic primary OA of the hip, knee, hand or spine were randomised (1 : 2 : 1) to lumiracoxib 100 <b>mg</b> <b>o.</b> d. (n = 755), lumiracoxib 100 mg b. i. d. (n = 1, 519) or celecoxib 200 <b>mg</b> <b>o.</b> d. (n = 758). The primary objective {{of the study was to}} demonstrate non-inferiority of lumiracoxib at either dose compared with celecoxib 200 <b>mg</b> <b>o.</b> d. with respect to the 1 -year retention on treatment rate. Secondary outcome variables included OA pain in the target joint, patient's and physician's global assessments of disease activity, Short Arthritis assessment Scale (SAS) total score, rescue medication use, and safety and tolerability. Results Retention rates at 1 year were similar for the lumiracoxib 100 <b>mg</b> <b>o.</b> d., lumiracoxib 100 mg b. i. d. and celecoxib 200 <b>mg</b> <b>o.</b> d. groups (46. 9 % vs 47. 5 % vs 45. 3 %, respectively). It was demonstrated that retention on treatment with lumiracoxib at either dose was non-inferior to celecoxib 200 <b>mg</b> <b>o.</b> d. Similarly, Kaplan-Meier curves for the probability of premature discontinuation from the study for any reason were similar across the treatment groups.

The Al/Mg ratio is found to significantly increase as the surface is sputtered and annealed in oxygen at intermediate temperatures ranging from 1073 – 1273 K. The Al excess is explained by the observed surface structure, where the formation of nanometer-sized pits and elongated patches with Al terminated step edges contribute to stabilizing the structure by compensating surface polarity. Surface X-ray diffraction reveals a reduced occupancy in the top two surface layers for both <b>Mg,</b> <b>Al,</b> and <b>O</b> and, moreover, vacancies are preferably located in octahedral sites, indicating that <b>Al</b> and <b>Mg</b> ions interchange sites. The excess of Al and high concentration of octahedral vacancies, very interestingly, indicates that the top few surface layers of the $MgAl_{ 2 }O_{ 4 }(100) $ adopts a surface structure {{similar to that of}} a spinel-like transition $Al_{ 2 }O_{ 3 }$ film. However, after annealing at a high temperature of 1473 K, the Al/Mg ratio restores to its initial value, the occupancy of all elements increases, and the surface transforms into a well-defined structure with large flat terraces and straight step edges, indicating a restoration of the surface stoichiometry. It is proposed that the tetrahedral vacancies at these high temperatures are filled by Mg from the bulk, due to the increased mobility at high annealing temperatures...|$|R

40|$|This project {{evaluated}} {{the potential for}} using ozone gas as post-harvest treatment for control of disease in stored potatoes. Ozone is a short-lived, highly reactive oxidizing agent with demonstrated potential to control disease-causing microorganisms. Preliminary trials showed that the atmospheric concentration of ozone obtained using commercial ozone generation equipment depended on the room size and reactive demands in the treatment area. Ozone applied to freshly harvested seed-grade potatoes up to 0 - 20 <b>mg</b> <b>O</b> 3 /kg/hr for 1, 7 or 21 days had little {{significant effect on the}} incidence or severity of a range of diseases or tuber colour, but did increase tuber weight loss in a dosage-dependant manner. Continuous ozone application (1. 9 <b>mg</b> <b>O</b> 3 /kg/hr) accentuated weight loss by the stored crop. Application of ozone (10 - 20 <b>mg</b> <b>O</b> 3 /kg/hr) and Purogene® (Chlorine dioxide; 200 ppm) for 1 day at the mid-point of the winter storage period had no effect on disease levels, skin colour or weight loss measured at the end of storage. When tubers were inoculated with a range of pathogens (Fusarium sambucinum, F. solani., Phytophthora infestans, Helminthosporium solani), introduced at wound depths appropriate to each disease, disease levels typically increased, however ozone treatment (20 <b>mg</b> <b>O</b> 3 /kg/hr) did not reduce development of any of these diseases. In the absence of potential interference by the surrounding storage environment, pure cultures of Fusarium spp., P. infestans and sclerotia of Sclerotinia sclerotiorum were exposed to 45 <b>mg</b> <b>O</b> 3 /plate/hr for 1 or 2 days. The ozone treatments had no effect on sporulation of any of the pathogens and did not reduce mycelial growth of Fusarium spp. Mycelial growth of Phytophthora and sclerotial germination of Sclerotinia were suppressed {{for the duration of the}} ozone treatment period, however normal growth resumed when the cultures were placed in ozone-free conditions. 	Ozone treatments (up to 320 <b>mg</b> <b>O</b> 3 /kg/hr for 2 days) did not reduce the sprouting ability of seed potatoes, however ozone treatments (~ 20 <b>mg</b> <b>O</b> 3 /kg/hr for 1, 7 or 21 days) significantly reduced wound periderm thickness of treated potatoes. Treating seed potatoes with ozone (0 or 20 <b>mg</b> <b>O</b> 3 /kg/hr for 1 or 2 days) prior to planting typically did not affect plant stand or yield, however under cool, wet conditions, ozone-treated seed potatoes produced poorer stands and yields relative to the controls. Based on the results obtained for the range of treatments evaluated in this project, ozone appears to have limited potential as a disease management tool in stored potatoes...|$|R
40|$|The {{tolerance}} of striped trumpeter, Latris lineata (Bloch and Schneider 1801) embryos to ozonated seawater was examined {{as a possible}} means of disinfection. The effect {{of a range of}} ozone doses and exposures (CT = concentration × exposure time) was tested at different stages of embryonic development. Three-day-old embryos two-thirds developed around the yolk were exposed for 0. 5, 1 or 5 min to ozone concentrations of 0. 5, 1, 2 and 5 <b>mg</b> <b>O</b> 3 l− 1 in a fully orthogonal factorial design. For each treatment there were four replicate 250 ml containers that each received 100 ± 15 embryos.

An ozone concentration of 0. 5 mg l− 1 had no effect on hatching success at any stage of development, but a concentration of 2 mg l− 1 significantly reduced hatching success on all days except Day 3. A safe and tested hatchery practise is to disinfect striped trumpeter embryos with 1 <b>mg</b> <b>O</b> 3 l− 1 for 1 min on Day 3 post-fertilisation when the embryo is two-thirds developed around the yolk...|$|R
40|$|Aeroponics root {{chambers}} {{were designed}} to evaluate the influence of low oxygen on disease development in clones of Eucalyptus marginata susceptible or resistant to infection by Phytophthora cinnamomi. Actively growing 7 -month-old clones of E. marginata were transferred into the aeroponics chambers, into which a nutrient solution was delivered in a fine spray, providing optimal conditions for root growth. Prior to inoculation by zoospores of P. cinnamomi under normal oxygen, the roots were exposed to four treatments: (i) normal oxygen, approximately 8 <b>mg</b> of <b>O</b> 2 liter- 1; (ii) 6 days of hypoxia, 2 <b>mg</b> of <b>O</b> 2 liter- 1; (iii) anoxic acclimatization 2 days at 2 <b>mg</b> of <b>O</b> 2 liter- 1, 2 days at 1 <b>mg</b> of <b>O</b> 2 liter- 1, 2 days at 0. 5 <b>mg</b> of <b>O</b> 2 liter- 1, 2 days at 2 <b>mg</b> of <b>O</b> 2 liter- 1, and 6 h at < 0. 05 <b>mg</b> of <b>O</b> 2 liter- 1; and (iv) 6 h of anoxia, < 0. 05 <b>mg</b> of <b>O</b> 2 liter- 1.

40|$|The benthos of Lough Hyne (Europe’s first marine reserve) in SW Ireland {{has changed}} {{dramatically}} {{in the past decade}} with declining invertebrate communities and proliferating ephemeral macroalgae. In summer 2011 and 2012, we measured dissolved oxygen (DO) levels on shallow subtidal rocky shores of the lough and recorded both benthic hypoxia (< 2 <b>mg</b> <b>O</b> 2 L− 1) and hyperoxia (∼ 10 – 16 <b>mg</b> <b>O</b> 2 L− 1). In late summer 2013, we systematically characterized the spatial and temporal patterns of DO in the lough seawater. Daytime DO levels were hyperoxic either at or near the rocky shore, declined with increased distance for the first 5 m offshore, then stabilized at normoxic levels (∼ 8 <b>mg</b> <b>O</b> 2 L− 1). DO levels above and below rocks were variable and often showed large differences (max. difference of 15. 6 <b>mg</b> <b>O</b> 2 L− 1), particularly at rocky shore sites with low current flow. At night, the DO in shallow water declined, becoming hypoxic to anoxic during calm weather. These extreme oxygen fluctuations (i) are amongst the first records to report severe conditions within Irish coastal waters and (ii) could contribute to the known recent decline in benthic invertebrate diversity within the marine reserve...|$|R

Structure refinements were performed by the Rietveld method using X-ray diffraction data, indicating that the layered compounds are fully structurally ordered. The compounds crystallize in a rhombohedral supercell of the cubic pyrochlore structure, in the space group R- 3 m. As indicated by magnetic susceptibility measurements, they exhibit predominantly antiferromagnetic interactions between rare earth moments. Except for possibly Pr 3 Sb 3 <b>Mg</b> 2 <b>O</b> 14 and Eu 3 Sb 3 <b>Mg</b> 2 <b>O</b> 14, none of the compounds show any signs of magnetic ordering above 2 K.

40|$|Near- and {{mid-infrared}} spectroscopy {{allows for}} the detection of local patterns of forest soil properties. In combination with dendrometric data, it may be used as a prospective tool for determining soil heterogeneity before setting up long-term forest monitoring experiments. Forest soils and stands generally exhibit higher spatial heterogeneity than other terrestrial ecosystems. This variability needs be taken into account before setting up long-term forest monitoring experiments to avoid multiple interactions between local heterogeneity and the factors tested in the experiment. We hypothesized that raw near- and mid-infrared spectra can be used as an integrated proxy of a large set of soil properties. The use of this method, in combination with dendrometric data, should provide a quick and cost-effective tool for optimizing the design of experimental forest sites. We assessed the local soil heterogeneity at 11 experimental sites in oak and beech stands, which belong to a new forest long-term ecological research (LTER) network. We used near- and mid-infrared spectroscopy in soil and litter samples. The spectra were subjected to principal components analyses (PCA) to determine the intra-site variability of the soil and litter layers. Based on mapped PCA coordinates and basic dendrometric data, it was possible to design the experiment and minimize the interactions between the treatment layout and the tested variables. The method was validated with chemical analyses of the soil. No interaction was detected at the set-up of the experiment between the treatment layout and chemical soil properties (C, N, C/N ratio, pH, CEC, <b>Al,</b> <b>Mg,</b> P 2 <b>O</b> 5, Fe, Mn, Na, and K). Near-infrared (NIR) and mid-infrared (MIR) spectroscopy is a useful tool for characterizing the overall heterogeneity of soil chemical properties. It can be used without any preliminary calibration. In combination with dendrometric data, it provides a reliable method for optimizing LTER plots in different types of ecosystems...|$|R
