With {{scandium}} anatase {{deposit of}} Qinglong Shazi and three typical laterite gold deposit of Laowanchang, Baozidong and Shaguochang in western Guizhou as research objects, this paper makes a comparative analysis on characteristics of geochemistry between scandium anatase and gold deposit: 1) The main oxides in the scandium anatase deposits and laterite gold deposits are similar, {{both of which}} include SiO 2, Al 2 O 3 and Fe 2 O 3 and its features are similar with that of laterite weathering crust in the contemporary age; 2) There are large differences of TiO 2 content in the scandium anatase deposits and laterite gold deposits with the TiO 2 content is much higher in the former one of 3. 42 - 5. 03 %. 3) Both the scandium anatase deposits and laterite gold deposits {{have gone through the}} intense weathering and the complete oxidization; 4) Both the scandium anatase deposits and laterite gold deposits are <b>argillaceous</b> <b>ore,</b> while Laowanchang lateritic gold mines and Baozidong lateritic gold mines are featured with silty clay-based; 5) Baozidong’s equals to 10. 21 - 14. 13 with the average value is 12. 17; which indicates the enrichment of the light rare earth. This obviously reflects the differences of the ore-forming environments. 6) According to the analysis result of correlation of trace elements of scandium anatase deposits of Qinglong Shazi, {{it can be seen that}} related elements can obviously be divided into two groups with the correlation coefficient above 0. 6 : Au-Ag-As-Sb-Hg-Tl group and Sc-TiO 2 -Cu-Fe-Mn group...|$|E
5000|$|The Musoshi {{ore body}} is the {{northern}} extension into the DRC of the Zambian Konkola North ore body. It is located 1.5 km {{to the north}} west of Kasumbalesa. It is a typical [...] "Ore Shale" [...] deposit, hosted in a fine-grained siltstone / <b>argillaceous</b> sandstone. The <b>ore</b> body dips steeply in the upper levels.

40|$|Abstract. Thallium {{concentrations}} in primary mineral commodities extracted in Poland and processed in high temperatures {{were determined by}} ICP-MS method. Samples of hard and brown coal, copper-silver and zinc-lead <b>ores,</b> <b>argillaceous</b> and calcareous rocks of different genesis and age were analyzed. The highest thallium concentrations occur in the zinc-lead ores, the average content being of 52. 1 mg/kg. The copper ores contain in average 1. 4 mg/kg of thallium. Hard coals from the Upper Silesian Coal Basin display higher thallium content than those exploited in the Lublin Coal Basin. Brown coals from Turow deposit distinguish by much higher values, 0. 7 mg/kg Tl, than those from huge Bełchatów and smaller Konin-Turek region deposits. Average thallium {{concentrations in}} clays used for ceramic materials are lower than 1 mg/kg, except of Mio-Pliocene Slowiany deposit. The average content of thallium in the studied limestone and dolomite raw materials for cement, lime, and metallurgical flux, and refractories is very low {{in comparison to the}} average amounts in the world carbonate rocks...|$|R
