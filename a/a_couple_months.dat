25|$|During the {{administration}} of Morrison's successor, Vic Schiro, the government sponsored studies of the feasibility of relocating New Orleans International Airport to a new site, contemporaneous with similar efforts that were ultimately successful in Houston (George Bush Intercontinental Airport) and Dallas (Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport). This attempt {{got as far as}} recommending a site in New Orleans East; a man-made island was to be created south of I-10 and north of U.S. Route 90 in a bay of Lake Pontchartrain. In the early 1970s it was decided that the current airport should be expanded instead, leading to the construction of a lengthened main terminal ticketing area, an airport access road linking the terminal to I-10, and the present-day Concourses A and B. New Orleans Mayor Sidney Barthelemy, in office from 1986 to 1994, later reintroduced the idea of building a new international airport for the city, with consideration given to other sites in New Orleans East, {{as well as on the}} Northshore in suburban St. Tammany Parish. Only <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>months</b> before Hurricane Katrina's landfall, Mayor Ray Nagin again proposed a new airport for New Orleans, this time to the west in Montz, Louisiana. These initiatives met with the same fate as 1960s-era efforts concerning construction of a new airport for New Orleans.|$|E
25|$|Wilkinson's {{best teams}} {{came during the}} first eleven years of his tenure. In that time, he {{recorded}} winning streaks of 31 and 47games and went 114–10–3, a winning percentage of 90.9%. Wilkinson left Oklahoma after the 1963 season {{with a record of}} 145–29–4, 14 conference titles and 123 straight games without being shut out. During Wilkinson's tenure, another first would be recorded. Prentice Gautt would become the first black football player at the University of Oklahoma. Gautt had been a superior student at his Oklahoma City high school. He {{was a member of the}} National Honor Society and president of his senior class. During his junior and senior years of high school, he helped his team amass a 31-game win streak. He was also the first black player to participate in the Oklahoma state all-star game. Because of Gautt's academic success in high school, he was supported financially by a group of local black doctors and pharmacists. <b>A</b> <b>couple</b> <b>months</b> into his freshman year, Gautt was placed on athletic scholarship and the money was returned to the investors. Unfortunately, some members of Gautt's team were not too happy to play with him. One player even left Oklahoma because he refused to play with an African American. However, most of the team had his support. After a freshman game in Tulsa, Gautt was refused service in the restaurant where the team was scheduled to eat. His teammates abruptly left and found an eating establishment that would also serve him. As a player, Gautt broke out in 1958. In 1959, he was named the Orange Bowl MVP. He was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame in 1985.|$|E
25|$|Madison {{hoped that}} the war would be over in <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>months</b> after the capture of Canada, but his hopes were quickly dashed. Madison had {{believed}} the state militias would rally to the flag and invade Canada, but the governors in the Northeast failed to cooperate. Their militias either sat out the war or refused to leave their respective states for action. The senior command at the War Department and in the field proved incompetent or cowardly—the general at Detroit surrendered to a smaller British force without firing a shot. Gallatin discovered the war {{was almost impossible to}} fund, since the national bank had been closed and major financiers in the Northeast refused to help. The American campaign in Canada, led by Henry Dearborn, ended with defeat in the Battle of Stoney Creek. The British armed American Indians in the Northwest, most notably several tribes allied with the Shawnee chief, Tecumseh. But, after losing control of Lake Erie at the naval Battle of Lake Erie in 1813, the British were forced to retreat. General William Henry Harrison caught up with them at the Battle of the Thames, where he destroyed the British and Indian armies, killed Tecumseh, and permanently destroyed Indian power in the Great Lakes region. Madison remains the only president to lead troops in battle while in office, although that battle (the Battle of Bladensburg in 1814) did not go well for the American side. The British then raided Washington, as Madison headed a dispirited militia. Dolley Madison rescued White House valuables and documents shortly before the British burned the White House, the Capitol and other public buildings.|$|E

500|$|During {{the summer}} of 2009, The Smeezingtons were booked for a week of writing {{sessions}} for Lupe Fiasco, B.o.B and Travie McCoy. Mars and Lawrence usually hummed melodies, while Aaron Bay-Schuck, former Atlantic A, encouraged both of them to develop the best of those melodies, such as [...] "Nothin' on You" [...] and [...] "Billionaire". In the beginning, they only had [...] "scratch chorus demos of [...] "Nothin' On You" [...] and [...] "Billionaire", with a guitar on the backing track and Bruno singing on top of it. In an interview to MTV News Mars and Lawrence explained how the song was created [...] "Me and Phil always had that hook," [...] Mars told MTV News, spontaneously breaking out into the chorus. [...] "It was a different melody at first, though," [...] Lawrence added. The instrumental of the song was composed when Levine programmed the drums , based on an old-school hip-hop beat.

[...] "Nothin' on You" [...] was only finished <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>months</b> later, around November, with B.o.B working with The Smeezingtons to shape it {{in the best way}} possible.

500|$|The {{music video}} for [...] "I Will Be" [...] {{was shot in}} New York City on 18 December 2008, and {{features}} Gossip Girl actor Chace Crawford {{as one of the}} characters. A reporter for People explained how the inclusion of Crawford in the video came to fruition, writing that [...] "Chace went to London <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>months</b> ago for meetings and to promote Gossip Girl. He went to a party and ended up meeting Leona. [...] hit it off and talk {{every once in a while}} and have become fast friends. A couple weeks ago Leona called Chace and asked if he would be in her next video. He obviously said yes." [...] In the video, it is presumed that Lewis and Crawford have stolen a large amount of money, as it opens with dialogue between the pair and how they are going to try and arrange to meet each other at a later date, due to the police closing in on them. As the song begins to play, Lewis sings the first verse on the car bonnet in which they were shown sitting in previously. As she sings the first chorus, she stands up and faces Crawford in the car, and begins to walk away in a car park as she sings the second verse. For the second chorus, Lewis is shown to evade the police by trying to escape by car park stairways, but is confronted by policemen in most directions she goes. For the final chorus, Lewis makes it out onto the road and runs from the police in their cars, but is ultimately blocked from escape in all directions as they close in on her, arrest her, and place her in the back of a police car. People ranked the video as one of the most anticipated videos to be released in January 2009.|$|E
500|$|The large {{positive}} {{response to the}} alpha footage convinced the studio to develop Goat Simulator as a full title to Steam, putting more people on the title. The team, having no plans for a full release, debated on whether to approach a large publisher to receive funding {{to help make the}} title into something like Grand Theft Auto, but decided to stay with a small, inexpensive title that would be truer to the teaser video. Recognizing that the glitching was part of the game's appeal, Ibrisagic only sought to fix software bugs that might cause the game to crash, leaving in the other glitches and bugs associated with the physics engine as the results from these were [...] "really hilarious". They limited themselves to a short development time of four weeks without significant management oversight as to set an urgent but realistic goal to bring the game to a playable state. Ibrisagic felt it was important for the game to be supported on Steam, but initially feared that Valve Corporation would not accept the quirky title. He instead found Valve to be welcoming of the title, including a joking response from the company that stated [...] " [...] has started wearing a goat costume to work he’s so excited about this game". As part of its release, Coffee Stain added support for Steam Workshop which would let players modify the game, aware that players would likely create levels and scenarios that will glitch and crash the game for humorous results. While the physics engine allows for spectacular rendering of destruction of the game environment, which is a main feature of the game, Coffee Stain acknowledged the downside of this as [...] "it would synchronise terribly in multiplayer". They estimated that adding multiplayer would remove [...] "90 percent of the physics" [...] and many other features, and left the game as a single player title at launch. The studio considered that it only spent <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>months</b> to complete the Windows version, and opted to outsource versions for OS X and Linux, with Ryan Gordon handling the porting.|$|E
