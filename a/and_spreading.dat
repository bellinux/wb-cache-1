5|$|Rodents {{have been}} used as food, for clothing, as pets, and as {{laboratory}} animals in research. Some species, in particular the brown rat, the black rat, and the house mouse, are serious pests, eating and spoiling food stored by humans, <b>and</b> <b>spreading</b> diseases. Accidentally introduced species of rodents are often considered to be invasive, and have caused the extinction of numerous species, such as island birds, previously isolated from land-based predators.|$|E
5|$|The Renaissance was a {{cultural}} movement that profoundly affected European intellectual {{life in the}} early modern period. Beginning in Italy, <b>and</b> <b>spreading</b> {{to the rest of}} Europe by the 16th century, its influence was felt in literature, philosophy, art, music, politics, science, religion, and other aspects of intellectual inquiry. Renaissance scholars employed the humanist method in study, and searched for realism and human emotion in art.|$|E

5|$|With urbanisation, {{distinctive}} urban accents {{have arisen}} which often differ greatly from the historical accents {{of the surrounding}} rural areas and sometimes share features with Southern English accents. Northern English dialects remain {{an important part of}} the culture of the region, and the desire of speakers to assert their local identity has led to accents such as Scouse and Geordie becoming more distinctive <b>and</b> <b>spreading</b> into surrounding areas.|$|E
5|$|Z.sexpunctatus males exhibit ritualized agonistic {{behavior}} when encountering other {{males of}} the same species. This behavior may include many {{of the same}} elements as courtship, such as raising <b>and</b> <b>spreading</b> the first pair of legs and vibrating the abdomen. During agonistic display, males will also extend their pedipalps and fangs. Lethal attacks between males appear to be rare, however.|$|E
5|$|Because of the {{low number}} of subfossil finds, Hadropithecus {{is thought to have}} been rare, and it died out sooner than its sister taxon, Archaeolemur. Both {{disappeared}} shortly after the arrival of humans to the island, but being a large, specialized, terrestrial grazer, Hadropithecus would have faced more pressure from domestic livestock, introduced pigs, <b>and</b> <b>spreading</b> human populations than its more generalized cousin. The last known record was radiocarbon dated to around 444–772 CE.|$|E

5|$|During Simeon's reign, Bulgaria {{reached its}} {{cultural}} apogee, becoming the literary and spiritual centre of Slavic Europe. In this respect, Simeon continued his father Boris' policy of establishing <b>and</b> <b>spreading</b> Slavic culture and attracting noted scholars and writers within Bulgaria's borders. It {{was in the}} Preslav Literary School and Ohrid Literary School, founded under Boris, that the main literary work in Bulgaria was concentrated {{during the reign of}} Simeon in the new Cyrillic alphabet which was developed there.|$|E
5|$|During {{the height}} of the typhoon at Cabras Island on Guam, a {{gasoline}} tank caught fire, believed to be from friction caused by extremely high winds running through its ventilation system. The tank exploded, sending its lid airborne <b>and</b> <b>spreading</b> the fire to other nearby tanks. The proximity of the tanks as well as low water pressure hampered firefighting efforts, and the fire was extinguished five days later; it resulted in three destroyed gasoline tanks with two more caught on fire. While the fire was burning, transportation of gasoline from the port to the rest of Guam was suspended resulting in a halt in gasoline sales for the general public.|$|E
5|$|Earlier {{hypotheses}} of the epidemic's origin have varied. Some hypothesized the flu {{originated in}} East Asia. Dr. C. Hannoun, leading expert of the 1918 flu for the Institut Pasteur, asserted the former virus {{was likely to}} have come from China, mutating in the United States near Boston <b>and</b> <b>spreading</b> to Brest, France, Europe's battlefields, Europe, and the world using Allied soldiers and sailors as main spreaders. He considered several other hypotheses of origin, such as Spain, Kansas, and Brest, as being possible, but not likely.|$|E

5|$|Early church {{buildings}} may originally {{have been}} wooden, like that excavated at Whithorn, but of those for which evidence survives from this era are basic masonry-built churches, beginning {{on the west}} coast and islands <b>and</b> <b>spreading</b> south and east. Early chapels tended to have square ended converging walls, similar to Irish chapels of this period. Medieval parish church architecture in Scotland was typically much less elaborate than in England, with many churches remaining simple oblongs, without transepts and aisles, and often without towers. In the Highlands they were often even simpler, many built of rubble masonry and sometimes indistinguishable from the outside from houses or farm buildings.|$|E
5|$|On 17 January 1968, the Khmer Rouge {{launched}} their first offensive. It was aimed more at gathering weapons <b>and</b> <b>spreading</b> propaganda than in seizing territory since, at that time, the adherents {{of the insurgency}} numbered no more than 4–5,000. During the same month, the communists established the Revolutionary Army of Kampuchea as the military wing of the party. As early {{as the end of}} the Battambang revolt, Sihanouk had begun to reevaluate his relationship with the communists. His earlier agreement with the Chinese had availed him nothing. They had not only failed to restrain the North Vietnamese, but they had actually involved themselves (through the Khmer Rouge) in active subversion within his country.|$|E
5|$|Opposition to Chicago's skyscrapers {{began to}} grow during the late 1880s and early 1890s. Even before the {{development}} of the skyscraper, some criticized large buildings in Chicago for dominating churches and private houses, and this sentiment strengthened. Critics complained that the concentration of tall buildings {{in the center of the}} city was causing huge congestion, and each new skyscraper was also burning additional coal to power its facilities, together consuming a total of over one million tons each year, leaving smoke and stagnant air hanging over Chicago. Many were concerned over the risk of a major fire breaking out <b>and</b> <b>spreading,</b> uncontrolled, from building to building.|$|E

5|$|Recreational gold mining {{is popular}} along the Klamath {{and some of}} its tributaries, {{including}} the Salmon and the Trinity. Although simple methods such as panning are still used, some methods use suction pumps—a practice involving turning over deposits of sediment <b>and</b> <b>spreading</b> them in order to find gold. Debates over the practice, which opponents contend damage water quality (mercury) and fish habitat, continue. Currently, suction dredge mining is banned in California until 2016.|$|E
5|$|The African crake is {{territorial}} on {{both the}} breeding and non-breeding grounds; the male threat display involves the bird standing upright <b>and</b> <b>spreading</b> the feathers of the flanks and belly like a fan to show the barred underparts. He may march towards the intruder, or walk {{side by side with}} another displaying male. The female may accompany the male, but with feathers less widely fanned. Fighting at territorial boundaries involves the male birds jumping at each other and pecking. Paired females will attack other females in the territory, especially if the male has shown an interest in them.|$|E
5|$|The Finns faced a {{detrimental}} {{interaction of}} power struggle and breakdown of society during 1917. The collapse of Russia induced {{a chain reaction}} of disintegration, starting from the government, military power and economy, <b>and</b> <b>spreading</b> downwards to all fields of the society such as local administration and workplaces, and finally {{to the level of}} individual citizens as changes and questions of freedom, responsibility and morality. The Social Democrats wanted to retain the civil rights achieved and increase socialists' power over the society. The conservatives feared to lose the long-held socioeconomic might. Both factions, with groups aiming at major supremacy, collaborated with the corresponding political forces in Russia, deepening the split in the nation.|$|E

5|$|The Lobata have {{a pair of}} lobes, {{which are}} muscular, cuplike {{extensions}} {{of the body that}} project beyond the mouth. Their inconspicuous tentacles originate from the corners of the mouth, running in convoluted grooves <b>and</b> <b>spreading</b> out over the inner surface of the lobes (rather than trailing far behind, as in the Cydippida). Between the lobes {{on either side of the}} mouth, many species of lobates have four auricles, gelatinous projections edged with cilia that produce water currents that help direct microscopic prey toward the mouth. This combination of structures enables lobates to feed continuously on suspended planktonic prey.|$|E
5|$|The Roman Rite is {{the most}} common rite of worship used by the Catholic Church. Its use is found worldwide, {{originating}} in Rome <b>and</b> <b>spreading</b> throughout Europe, influencing and eventually supplanting local rites.

An outline of its major liturgical elements {{can be found in the}} side bar.|$|E
5|$|The Soviets {{employed}} maskirovka (military deception) to mask defensive {{positions and}} troop dispositions and {{to conceal the}} movement of men and materiel. These included camouflaging gun emplacements, constructing dummy airfields and depots, generating false radio-traffic, <b>and</b> <b>spreading</b> rumours among the Soviet frontline troops and the civilian population in the German-held areas. Movement of forces and supplies {{to and from the}} salient took place at night only. Ammunition caches were carefully concealed to blend in with the landscape. Radio transmission was restricted and fires were forbidden. Command posts were hidden and motor transport in and around them forbidden.|$|E
