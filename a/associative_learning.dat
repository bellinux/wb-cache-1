40|$|Emotional deficits {{are among}} the core {{features}} of schizophrenia and both <b>associative</b> emotional <b>learning</b> and the related ability to verbalize emotions can be reduced. We investigated whether schizophrenia patients demonstrated impaired function of limbic and prefrontal areas during <b>associative</b> emotional <b>learning.</b> Patients and controls filled out an alexithymia questionnaire and performed an <b>associative</b> emotional <b>learning</b> task with positive, negative and neutral picture-word pairs during fMRI scanning. After scanning, they indicated for each pair whether they remembered it We conducted standard GLM analysis and Independent Component Analysis (ICA). Both the GLM results and task-related ICA components were compared between groups. The alexithymia questionnaire indicated more cognitive-emotional processing difficulties in patients than controls, but equal experienced intensity of affective states. Patients remembered less picture-word pairs, irrespective of valence. GLM analysis showed significant visual, temporal, amygdalar/hippocampal, and prefrontal activation in all subjects. ICA identified a network of brain areas similar to GLM, mainly in response to negative stimuli. Neither analysis showed differences between patients and controls during learning. Although in previous studies schizophrenia patients showed abnormalities in both memory and emotion processing, neural circuits involved in cross-modal <b>associative</b> emotional <b>learning</b> may remain intact to a certain degree, which may have potential consequences for treatment.

40|$|<b>Associative</b> {{emotional}} <b>learning,</b> {{which is}} important for the social emotional functioning of individuals and is often impaired in psychiatric illnesses, is in part mediated by dopamine and glutamate pathways in the brain. The protein DARPP- 32 is involved in the regulation of dopaminergic and glutaminergic signaling. Consequently, {{it has been suggested that}} the haplotypic variants of the gene PPP 1 R 1 B that encodes DARPP- 32 are associated with working memory and emotion processing. We hypothesized that PPP 1 R 1 B should have a significant influence on the network of brain regions involved in <b>associative</b> emotional <b>learning</b> that are rich in DARPP- 32, namely the striatum, prefrontal cortex (comprising the medial frontal gyrus and inferior frontal gyrus (IFG)), amygdala and parahippocampal gyrus (PHG). Dynamic causal models were applied to functional MRI data to investigate how brain connectivity during an <b>associative</b> emotional <b>learning</b> task is affected by different single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of PPP 1 R 1 B: rs 879606, rs 907094 and rs 3764352. Compared to heterozygotes, homozygotes with GTA alleles displayed increased intrinsic connectivity between the IFG and PHG, as well as increased excitability of the PHG for negative emotional stimuli. We have also elucidated the directionality of these genetic influences. Our data suggest that homozygotes with GTA alleles involve stronger functional connections between brain areas in order to maintain activation of these regions. Homozygotes might engage a greater degree of motivational learning and integration of information to perform the emotional learning task correctly. We conclude that PPP 1 R 1 B is associated with the neural network involved in <b>associative</b> emotional <b>learning.</b> (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|Recent neuropsychological {{theories}} {{emphasize the}} influence of maladaptive learning and memory processes on pain perception. However, the precise relationship between these processes {{as well as the}} underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood; especially the role of perceptual discrimination and its modulation by <b>associative</b> fear <b>learning</b> has received little attention so far. Experimental work with exteroceptive stimuli consistently points to effects of fear learning on perceptual discrimination acuity. In addition, clinical observations have revealed that in individuals with chronic pain perceptual discrimination is impaired, and that tactile discrimination training reduces pain.

25|$|Jensen's {{interest}} in learning differences directed him to the extensive testing of school children. The results led him to distinguish between two separate types of learning ability.

25|$|In particular, <b>associative</b> <b>learning,</b> {{which is}} another type of episodic memory, is {{vulnerable}} {{to the effects of}} aging, and this has been demonstrated across various study paradigms. This has been explained by the Associative Deficit Hypothesis (ADH), which states that aging is associated with a deficiency in creating and retrieving links between single units of information. This can include knowledge about context, events or items. The ability to bind pieces of information together with their episodic context in a coherent whole has been reduced in the elderly population. Furthermore, the older adultsâ€™ performances in free recall involved temporal contiguity to a lesser extent than for younger people, indicating that associations regarding contiguity become weaker with age.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{studies the}} {{fundamental}} interplay between Hebbian synaptic changes and neuronally driven processes modifying synaptic efficacies, {{and its role}} in <b>associative</b> memory <b>learning.</b> The importance of neuronally driven normalization processes has already been demonstrated in the context of self-organization of cortical maps [1, 2] and in continuous unsupervised learning as in Principal-Component-Analysis networks [3]. In these scenarios such normalization was shown to be necessary to prevent the excessive growth of synaptic efficacies that occurs when learning and neuronal activity are strongly coupled. In this paper we focus on <b>associative</b> memory <b>learning</b> where this excessive synaptic runaway growth is mild [4], and show that even in this more simple learning paradigm, normalization processes are essential. Moreover, while various normalization procedures can prevent synaptic runaway, our analysis shows that a specific neuronally-driven correction procedure that preserves the total sum of synaptic efficacies is essential for effective memory storage. To this end we analyze the effectiveness of Hebbian synaptic learning rules and identify a critical constraint on effective learning. We then describe a neuronal procedure obtaining this constraint and show how it can be implemented via a biologically plausible mechanism. 2 The Space of Synaptic Learning Rule...|$|R
