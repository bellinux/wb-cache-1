40|$|The Oregon Department of Transportation {{evaluated}} {{the effectiveness of}} a “sequentially flashing diamond” arrow panel display as an advance caution warning in temporary work zones. This display was evaluated by comparing it to flashing line and flashing four-corner modes. When surveyed, 33 state transportation agencies rated each display about the same in terms of effectiveness. Daytime and nighttime field trials using the three modes were conducted in two work zones set up on highway shoulders. Nine hours of evaluation time at each site was divided into three, three-hour test periods, with each display operating for one hour. Hourly average and 85 th percentile speeds recorded during the tests were lower than corresponding hourly baseline speeds for all display modes. The greatest speed reductions occurred when the diamond display was operating. Additionally, motorists at a highway rest area were surveyed about the three displays that were operating in the parking area. Over 70 % of 274 respondents chose the diamond display as the most effective at getting their attention, and 80 % said {{they would like to see}} the diamond used when work is taking place on Oregon highways. However, 61 % found the three displays confusing, particularly the line and the four-corner. The results of the field trials and motorist survey show potential for the diamond display’s use as an <b>advance</b> <b>warning</b> <b>device</b> in temporary work zones...|$|E
40|$|Abstract — Extended patient cardiac {{function}} monitoring during {{normal activity}} {{is a growing}} field in medical research. The research reported in this paper focuses {{on the development of}} a portable platform based on Laptop PC for real-time analysis of cardiac oscillations, which can be used as an <b>advanced</b> <b>warning</b> <b>device</b> for heart abnormalities. The emphasis is on algorithms and techniques for QRS complex detection and frequency analysis of heart rate variability. The reliability and effectiveness was quantitatively assessed using simulated and real signals of healthy and pathological cardiac state. The system presents good results on heart rate variability analysis by adapting itself to any electrocardiogram amplitude and frequency. I...|$|R
50|$|New {{technologies}} {{were also}} tried {{as a way}} to regain the upper hand. In mid-1943, two new technologies were introduced to the U-boats: the Wanze radar <b>warning</b> <b>device</b> and T5 Zaunkönig torpedoes. The Wanze <b>warning</b> <b>device</b> was designed to give U-boats <b>advance</b> <b>warning</b> of aircraft by detecting incoming radar waves so that the U-boats could dive before the aircraft started its attack run. The T5 Zaunkönig torpedoes were designed to zigzag in the hope that they would {{have a better chance of}} finding a target within a convoy. The Allies, in turn, introduced the Foxer noisemaking decoy in an attempt to defeat the acoustic homing device of the T5 torpedo. As a response, the Germans developed the T11 torpedo that was designed to ignore noisemaking decoys, but the war ended before it could be deployed.|$|R
40|$|The {{drivers who}} {{received}} a combined audible and visual message (combination group) responded that the average effectiveness rating of the IVR was 3. 6 using a 5. 0 scale. This was higher than the 2. 5 rating from the drivers who received only a visual message throughout the study (visual-plus group). The combination group gave the IVR a rating that {{was similar to the}} clanging bell and the train horn, lower than the ratings for the crossing gate and flashing lights, but higher than the ratings for the <b>advance</b> <b>warning</b> and crossbuck signs. The visual-plus group gave IVR a rating that was similar to the <b>advance</b> <b>warning</b> sign, but was lower than the ratings of the other <b>warning</b> <b>devices.</b> About 61 % of the combination group trusted the IVR to give an accurate warning of a train presence compared to 33 % for the visual-plus group. For participating drivers who had experience with the audible, visual, and combination modes, the IVR had a high or very high ability {{to attract the attention of}} 71. 0 % using the audible mode, 26. 7 % usin...|$|R

40|$|The {{introduction}} of safety technologies into complex socio-technical systems requires an integrated and {{holistic approach to}} HF and engineering, considering the effects of failures not only within system boundaries, but also at the interfaces with other systems and humans. Level crossing <b>warning</b> <b>devices</b> are examples of such systems where technically safe states within the system boundary can influence road user performance, giving rise to other hazards that degrade safety of the system. Chris will discuss the challenges that have been encountered to date in developing a safety argument in support of low-cost level crossing <b>warning</b> <b>devices.</b> The design and failure modes of level crossing <b>warning</b> <b>devices</b> {{are known to have}} a significant influence on road user performance; however, quantifying this effect is one of the ongoing challenges in determining appropriate reliability and availability targets for low-cost level crossing <b>warning</b> <b>devices...</b>|$|R

40|$|This report {{contains}} {{the results of}} the third survey (out of four surveys) that was conducted six months after the IVR system was operational. Drivers who had the IVR in the audible (visual) mode for the first three months would have switched to the visual (audible) mode for the next three months. The audible and visual groups gave similar average effectiveness ratings to all of the <b>warning</b> <b>devices</b> except the flashing lights, clanging bell, and IVR. The audible group rated these three devices higher than the visual group. The IVR average effectiveness rating from the audible group was 3. 8 using a 5. 0 scale, significantly higher than 2. 7 from the visual group. The visual warning message from the visual IVR was not as effective in attracting attention of the drivers as the beeping sound from the audible IVR. This is reflected in its effectiveness rating. The effectiveness rating for the audible mode of IVR was significantly higher than that of the <b>advance</b> <b>warning</b> and the crossbuck signs, {{similar to that of the}} train horn...|$|R
40|$|Survey Number 2 (out of four surveys) was {{conducted}} {{three months after}} the IVR system was operational. During the period, the participating drivers received only one type of message from their IVRs, either an audible or a visual message. The audible and visual groups gave similar effectiveness ratings for all <b>warning</b> <b>devices</b> except the clanging bell. The visual group rated the clanging bell higher than the audible group. The IVR average effectiveness rating from the audible group was 3. 3 and from the visual group it was 3. 4 using a 5. 0 scale. The effectiveness of the IVR was similar to the crossbuck and <b>advance</b> <b>warning</b> signs, but lower than the crossing gate, flashing lights, clanging bell, and the train horn. The audible and visual groups trusted the IVR to the same degree. About 60. 6 % of the audible group and 58. 4 % of the visual group trusted the IVR to give an accurate warning of a train approaching/occupying the equipped crossings. The drivers in general were satisfied with the quality of the message from their IVR. For th...|$|R
40|$|AbstractConstruction workers {{suffer the}} most {{electrocution}}s among all industries. Major reasons for electrocution {{in the construction}} industries are workers contact with the power line or material handling equipment contact with the power line.
