5|$|In 1999, {{four women}} {{were killed by}} Cary Stayner just outside the park. That same year a large rockslide {{originating}} at {{the east side of}} Glacier Point ended near the Happy Isles of the Merced River, creating a debris field larger than several football fields. Tourism dropped <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>after</b> those incidents, but soon returned to its previous level.|$|E
5|$|Eventually <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>after</b> noon Wilton {{arrived at}} the inquest, and gave a full account of the incident. Lord Granville (half-brother of the Marquess of Stafford) told the jury that Huskisson had been {{suffering}} from numbness in his leg from a previous operation, and that this may have caused his apparent problems with movement. No witnesses recollected seeing any signal flags raised {{from any of the}} locomotives involved, including Rocket, although a system of warning flags {{was supposed to have been}} in place.|$|E
5|$|Matt's brigade {{began moving}} to Tasa at 4:30 PM on October 15, before turning eastwards on Akavish. Heavy {{congestion}} {{on the roads}} made the brigade's progress very slow. <b>A</b> <b>little</b> <b>after</b> midnight, the brigade left Akavish and moved westward to the Yard, an area 700 meters long and 150 meters wide surrounded by protective sand walls. The site had been made long before the war.|$|E

5|$|Ilić {{recruited}} the Serbian youths Vaso Čubrilović and Cvjetko Popović {{shortly after}} Easter (Orthodox Easter {{as given by}} Dedijer: 19 April 1914), for the assassination, {{as evidenced by the}} testimony of Ilić, Čubrilović, and Popović at the Sarajevo trial. Three youths – Gavrilo Princip, Trifko Grabež, and Nedeljko Čabrinović – Bosnian Serb subjects of Austria-Hungary, living in Belgrade, testified at the Sarajevo trial that {{at about the same time}} (<b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>after</b> Easter), they were eager to carry out an assassination and approached a fellow Bosnian Serb and former guerrilla fighter known to be well connected and with access to arms, Milan Ciganović, and through him Major Tankosić and reached an agreement to transport arms to Sarajevo and participate in the assassination.|$|E
5|$|That evening, {{his wounds}} became infected; he {{suffered}} a strong fever and septicemia set in. His doctors considered amputating his leg, but none wished {{to take responsibility for}} so drastic an act. On 19 October, he became delirious and called out for his mother, but the Greek government refused to allow her to re-enter the country from exile in Switzerland, despite her own protestations. Finally, the queen dowager, Olga, George I's widow and Alexander's grandmother, was allowed to return alone to Athens to tend to the king. She was delayed by rough waters, however, and by the time she arrived, Alexander had already died of sepsis twelve hours previously at <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>after</b> 4 p.m. on 25 October 1920. The other {{members of the royal family}} received the news by telegram that night.|$|E
5|$|Towards {{the end of}} his life, Sorabji ceased composing, {{because of}} his failing {{eyesight}} and difficulties in holding a pen. His health deteriorated severely in 1986, obliging him to abandon his home and spend several months in a Wareham hospital. In March 1987, together with his companion Reginald Norman Best (1909–1988), he moved into a two-room suite in Marley House Nursing Home, a private nursing home in Winfrith Newburgh, where he was permanently chairbound and received daily nursing care. In June 1988 he suffered a mild stroke, which left him slightly mentally impaired. He died of heart failure on 15 October 1988 at <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>after</b> 7pm, at the age of 96. He was cremated in Bournemouth Crematorium on 24 October of that year, and the funeral services took place in Corfe Castle Parish Church on the same day.|$|E

5|$|<b>A</b> <b>little</b> <b>after</b> {{two o'clock}} in the afternoon, Victorio and his Apaches slowly {{approached}} the springs. Victorio somehow sensed danger and halted his men. With the hostile Apaches in their sights appearing ready to bolt, the soldiers did not wait and opened fire on their own initiative; Victorio's men scattered and withdrew out of carbine range. Victorio's people needed water and believing that {{there were only a few}} soldiers present, regrouped and attacked immediately. As the battle progressed, Victorio sent his warriors to flank the soldiers. Carpenter charged forward with Companies B and H and a few massed volleys from their carbines sent the hostiles scattering back up the canyon. Stunned by the presence of such a strong force but in desperate need of water, Victorio repeatedly charged the cavalrymen in attempts to reach the spring. Grierson's cavalry defenders, now bolstered by Carpenter's two companies, stood firm. The last such attempt to break the soldiers was conducted near nightfall and when it failed, Victorio and his followers withdrew into the westward into the mountains. Carpenter with his two companies remounted in pursuit until darkness halted the effort.|$|E

25|$|The {{hostages were}} seized on 23 October at the House of Culture of State Ball-Bearing Plant Number 1 in the Dubrovka area of Moscow about four {{kilometers}} south-east of the Moscow Kremlin. During Act II of a sold-out performance of Nord-Ost <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>after</b> 9:00 PM, 40–50 heavily armed and masked {{men and women}} drove in a bus to the theater and entered the main hall firing assault rifles in the air.|$|E
25|$|<b>A</b> <b>little</b> <b>after</b> noon the Union {{soldiers}} {{began to}} move toward the Confederate lines, and {{at about the same time}} the rains began. The road was soon turned into mud, and the mere act of walking required great exertion. The gunners with the howitzers accompanying the infantry soon were exhausted trying to move their pieces, so a regiment of infantry (51st Pennsylvania) were detailed to help them. Many of those foot soldiers long remembered this as the most arduous part of the battle.|$|E

25|$|Atlantis crew tested shuttle’s {{re-entry}} systems. Commander Hobaugh and Pilot Wilmore, {{with help}} from Mission Specialist Bresnik checked out the Flight Control System (FCS). Immediately afterwards, at 10:58 UTC, the astronauts test fired Reaction Control System (RCS) thrusters. The RCS thrusters control the shuttle’s orientation as it descends and begins its re-entry through the atmosphere. All astronauts gathered for a deorbit briefing <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>after</b> 11:00 UTC, just before their midday meal. The Thanksgiving dinner aboard Atlantis was more traditional than expected.|$|E
25|$|Timmermann coaxed Busch out {{and talked}} with him. Busch {{described}} {{the situation in the}} tunnel and offered to translate for the surrender. The German officers were still reluctant to surrender. Timmermann, through Busch, finally had a German officer come out of the tunnel and a peaceful surrender was arranged. Some 200 soldiers and over 100 civilians, along with young Busch's mother, surrendered and were escorted over the bridge to safety. It was now <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>after</b> 1715 hours (5:15 PM), less than two hours had passed. The only German killed in the railroad tunnel that afternoon was young Willi Felten.|$|E
25|$|Bolling was an {{attorney}} at Guthrie, Cravath, and Henderson. <b>A</b> <b>little</b> <b>after</b> a year there {{he began his}} career in the legal department of the United States Steel Corporation. By 1907 he was assistant general solicitor and married Anna Tucker Phillips, June 25, 1907 in Beverly, Massachusetts. She was the sister of William Phillips, a prominent career diplomat. He also joined the New York National Guard. He and his wife had four daughters and a son, one of whom, Cecelia Raynal Bolling, died in infancy. In 1913 he was named general counsel of US Steel at the age of 36.|$|E

25|$|Vaginal births {{are more}} common, {{but there are}} {{sometimes}} complications and a woman might undergo a caesarean section (commonly known as a C-section) instead of a vaginal delivery. The vaginal mucosa has an abnormal accumulation of fluid (edematous) and is thin, with few rugae, <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>after</b> birth. The mucosa thickens and rugae return in approximately three weeks once the ovaries regain usual function and estrogen flow is restored. The vaginal opening gapes and is relaxed, until it returns to its approximate pre-pregnant state by {{six to eight weeks}} in the period beginning immediately after the birth (the postpartum period); however, it will maintain a larger shape than it previously had.|$|E
25|$|At {{the time}} Beltrán de Guzmán {{was already in}} New Spain, at Pánuco, so Charles ordered the judges to {{assemble}} in Veracruz and from there make a joint entrance into the capital. However, Beltrán de Guzmán was delayed. The oidores from Spain did not wait for his arrival, but proceeded directly to the capital. They arrived there on December 8, 1528, taking over the government on the following day. They were given a splendid reception by the city government. Beltrán arrived <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>after</b> the others. Two of them (Maldonado and Parada) were sick on their arrival and soon died. They did not {{take part in the}} government.|$|E

He then went to Billy Haas's Chophouse at 332 West 45th Street, where he ate dinner with Ritzi and William Klein, a lawyer friend. Klein later told {{investigators}} that Crater was {{in a good mood}} that evening and gave no indication that anything was bothering him. The dinner ended <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>after</b> 9 p.m., shortly after the curtain rose on the show for which Crater had bought a ticket, and the small group went outside.|$|E
