5|$|After several {{diplomatic}} {{failures and}} military defeats in the 1730s, Austria {{seemed to be}} declining, or even {{on the verge of}} collapse. After her forty years reign, Maria Theresa left a revitalised empire that influenced the rest of Europe throughout the 19thcentury. She gave the Habsburg dominions an efficient administrative system that allowed it to remain <b>a</b> <b>great</b> <b>power</b> in its own right, without the support of the Holy Roman Empire. Her descendants followed her example and continued reforming the empire. The acquisition of the Kingdom of Galicia and Lodomeria gave the empire an even more multinational character that would ultimately lead to its destruction. Her introduction of compulsory schooling, as a means of Germanisation, eventually triggered the revival of Czech culture.|$|E
5|$|Austria {{is closely}} linked to the fate of {{prominent}} Russian diplomat and statesman Prince Alexander Mikhailovich Gorchakov. He arrived in Vienna in 1833 as an adviser to the embassy, and, from 1854 to 1856, he led the Russian diplomatic mission. Gorchakov became Envoy Extraordinary and Minister Plenipotentiary to the Austrian court at the most difficult period for Russia during the Crimean War, during which time he was able to preserve diplomatic relations with Austria and helped to overcome the international isolation of the Russian Empire and reinforced Russia's status as <b>a</b> <b>great</b> <b>power.</b> The Vienna Conference in 1855 was the first presence of Gorchakov in an international forum, and his performance in representing Russia at the Paris Conference of 1856 saw Alexander II appoint him as Russian Minister of Foreign Affairs.|$|E
5|$|Barrow became {{manager of}} the Boston Red Sox in 1918. As the team lost many of its better players during World War I, Barrow {{encouraged}} owner Harry Frazee to purchase Stuffy McInnis, Wally Schang, Bullet Joe Bush, and Amos Strunk from the Philadelphia Athletics for $75,000 ($ in current dollar terms). During the season, Barrow feuded with his assistant, Johnny Evers, who undermined Barrow's leadership. The Red Sox won the 1918 World Series. Recognizing that star pitcher Babe Ruth was also <b>a</b> <b>great</b> <b>power</b> hitter, Barrow had Ruth pinch hit on days when he wasn't scheduled to pitch. When Ruth told Barrow that he could only pitch or hit, Barrow decided that Ruth's bat was more useful than his pitching, and transitioned him from a pitcher into an outfielder.|$|E

5|$|Byzantium looked {{impressive}} when Manuel died in 1180, {{having just}} celebrated the betrothal {{of his son}} Alexios II to {{the daughter of the}} king of France. Thanks to the diplomacy and campaigning of Alexios, John, and Manuel, the empire was <b>a</b> <b>great</b> <b>power,</b> economically prosperous, and secure on its frontiers; but there were serious problems as well. Internally, the Byzantine court required a strong leader to hold it together, and after Manuel's death stability was seriously endangered from within. Some of the foreign enemies of the Empire were lurking on the flanks, waiting for a chance to attack, in particular the Turks in Anatolia, whom Manuel had ultimately failed to defeat, and the Normans in Sicily, who had already tried but failed to invade the Empire on several occasions. Even the Venetians, the single most important western ally of Byzantium, were on bad terms with the empire at Manuel's death in 1180. Given this situation, it would have taken a strong Emperor to secure the Empire against the foreign threats it now faced, and to rebuild the depleted Imperial Treasury. But Manuel's son was a minor, and his unpopular regency government was overthrown in a violent coup d'état. This troubled succession weakened the dynastic continuity and solidarity on which the strength of the Byzantine state had come to rely.|$|E
5|$|The {{representatives of}} France, Great Britain, and the Dutch Republic signed the Treaty of Utrecht on 11 April 1713 (N.S.) – the Emperor and his German allies, {{including}} the Elector of Hanover, continued {{with the war}} before finally accepting the general settlement the following year. The Treaty marked Britain's emergence as <b>a</b> <b>great</b> <b>power.</b> Domestically, however, the country remained divided between Whig and Tory, Jacobite and Hanoverian factions. By now Oxford and St John (Viscount Bolingbroke since 1712) – absorbed entirely by their mutual enmity and political squabbling – had effectively wrecked the Tory administration. Marlborough had been kept well informed of events while in exile and had remained a powerful figure on the political scene, not least because of the personal attachment the Queen still retained for him. After {{the death of his}} daughter Elizabeth from smallpox in March 1714, Marlborough contacted the Queen. Although the contents of the letter are unknown it is possible that Anne may have summoned him home. Either way, it seems that an agreement was reached to reinstate the Duke in his former offices.|$|E

Although unlike the contemporary great powers who have long been considered so, India's recognition among authorities as <b>a</b> <b>great</b> <b>power</b> is comparatively recent. However there is no collective agreement among observers as {{to the status of}} India, for example, a number of academics believe that India is emerging as <b>a</b> <b>great</b> <b>power,</b> while some believe that India remains a middle power.|$|E

25|$|Nations such as France, Russia and the United Kingdom are {{generally}} considered to be great powers due to their military and strategic importance, their status as recognised nuclear powers and also their permanent seats on the United Nations Security Council. Some academics also believe that Germany and Japan are great powers, but due to their large advanced economies and global influence as opposed to military and strategic capabilities. Italy also has seen much discussion among academics and commentators regarding its status as <b>a</b> <b>great</b> <b>power,</b> particularly for its position in the G7 and the nation's influence in regional and international organisations. Although broad academic support for India as <b>a</b> <b>great</b> <b>power</b> is uncommon, recent years have seen some in the field of political science, such as Malik Mohan (2011) and Dr. Zbigniew Brzezinski (2012) put forward the assertion that India holds the status of <b>a</b> <b>great</b> <b>power.</b>|$|E

5000|$|The {{strategic}} behaviour {{of small}} powers {{is characterized by}} dependence. A small power recognizes that it cannot obtain security by relying solely on its own capabilities.

A small power plays a dispensable and non-decisive part in <b>a</b> <b>great</b> <b>power’s</b> array of political and military resources. Small powers therefore tend towards a policy of either strict neutrality or alliance. Those ‘located in geopolitical regions critical to maintaining <b>a</b> <b>great</b> <b>power’s</b> position in the international system tend to opt for alliance’. In an alliance, small powers tend to follow the alliance leader closely, lend it what support they can and avoid antagonizing it. Under regional hegemony with a low probability of punishment, small powers tend to adopt neutrality.|$|R
