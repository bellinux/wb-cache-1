5000|$|Each pad {{contained}} a two-piece <b>access</b> <b>tower</b> system, the Fixed Service Structure (FSS) and the Rotating Service Structure (RSS). The FSS permitted {{access to the}} Shuttle via a retractable arm and a [...] "beanie cap" [...] to capture vented LOX from the External Tank. The RSS contained the Payload Changeout Room, which offered [...] "clean" [...] access to the orbiter's payload bay, protection from the elements, and protection in winds up to 60 kn.|$|E
50|$|A {{project that}} is {{proceeding}} {{is the creation}} of The Queen's Diamond Jubilee Galleries in the medieval triforium of the abbey. The aim is to create a new display area for the abbey's treasures in the galleries high up around the abbey's nave. To this end a new Gothic <b>access</b> <b>tower</b> with lift has been designed by the abbey architect and Surveyor of the Fabric, Ptolemy Dean. It is planned that the new galleries will open in 2018.|$|E
50|$|The East Quarter, {{apart from}} its {{courtyard}} façade is ruined. The centrally placed <b>access</b> <b>tower,</b> the Crosshouse, was reconstructed by the Marquis of Bute. The National Trust's architect, Schomberg Scott recreated the King and Queen's bedchambers within. The northern section of the East quarter was originally a lodging built by James IV. The master of works, James Murray of Kilbaberton was ordered to repair the flat roof of the King and Queen's galleries and {{the roof of the}} lodging of the East Quarter in 1616 in anticipation of the visit of James VI.|$|E

50|$|Facilities {{to support}} manned {{launches}} were built at both pads. These included large mobile <b>access</b> <b>towers,</b> {{which would have}} allowed the crew to board a spacecraft {{on top of the}} rocket. These towers were never used. The tower at area 45/1 is still intact, and the tower at area 45/2 is still standing, but was heavily damaged in the October 1990 explosion. The towers are not used in unmanned launch operations, as all systems are automated, and no access to the rocket is required.|$|R
50|$|Opened in 1975, {{the current}} station was {{designed}} by the local architectural firm of Antinozzi Associates. Unusually, the station spans the six lanes of Water Street, with the passenger waiting room located over the roadway. The simple concrete facades are scored with vertical lines or channels to create a textured surface. Throughout the day, as the sun rakes across the walls, the channels—of varying depth and width—produce a range of ever-changing shadows. Boxy in appearance and punctuated by rectangular windows, the station’s angularity is softened by the rounded edges of the <b>access</b> <b>towers.</b>|$|R

50|$|The monastery's living {{quarters}} are formed by nine rooms and a hall, {{all of them}} communicating with each other. There is also a lower ground floor containing cellars. The <b>access</b> <b>tower</b> in the complex is fairly large, and is {{regarded as one of}} the most beautiful examples of such constructions found in Romania. It is situated in the southern part of the complex, and has three levels and a total height of approximately 20 metres. The third levels is used for bells, and has an open space in all four sides. Part of the exterior walls of the tower were repainted by Sava Henţia at the beginning of the 20th century.|$|E
50|$|Sant Climent de Taüll is the largest, most well preserved, and has {{the most}} {{outstanding}} architecture {{out of all the}} churches in the Valley of Boí. The church is a basilica plan structure, that has three naves (each of them with a terminal apse), and large columns separating the side naves. One of the doorways opens {{on the west side of}} the building, with the remains of what might have been a porch. The other openings are located on the south side and on the <b>access</b> <b>tower.</b> The facades of the church do not have any decoration, but the apses have simple Lombard decorations and are built with stone and brick. The central apse on the exterior is decorated by groups of four arches, separated by half columns. The apsidioles (apses on either side of the central apse), have groups of three arches instead of four, with each of the apses having one window each. In addition, the central apse has three arched windows located on ground level and two portholes on either side of the central apse.|$|E

50|$|The town {{consisted}} of upper town, lower town, and the suburb that expanded eastwards {{up to the}} Vučjanka river. Upper town's surface is around 400 squared meters overall. It had two diagonally placed towers - one being the <b>access</b> <b>tower</b> towards the lower town, and the other being a large donjon tower in the northwestern corner. Surface of the lower town {{is believed to be}} as big as 1400 squared meters. Based on the pottery found in the compound, as well as some preserved details of the fortification, indicates that the town had a significant importance during the times of Desa Vukanović, Stefan Nemanja, and his successors. The complex is located on steep rock, overgrown with tall trees, above a narrow terrain which is limited by a river. The town silhouette is barely spotted against the trees and terrain until in near immediate vicinity, so it is believed that it was a very well-defensible town. This {{may be one of the}} reasons why the town is called Zelen grad (Green town).|$|E
5000|$|The installation, {{known as}} a 200 Series, fixed ground [...] "high flying" [...] radar station {{was one of only}} two of this type located in north Queensland (the other being No 220 at Bones Knob, Tolga). The 211 Radar Station {{utilised}} British Advanced Chain Overseas (ACO) equipment, operated in the HF band at 42.05 megacycles per second, which is a wave length of about 7 metres, and had height finding capabilities. Two 186 foot wooden towers, which were assembled in kit form, stood approximately 100 metres apart, and supported the transmitting and receiving aerials. The equipment was housed in two above ground semi-circular bomb-proof igloos constructed of reinforced concrete. The eastern igloo housed the receiving equipment whilst the western igloo housed the transmitting equipment. It is believed that these igloos were designed to be built underground, with a short <b>access</b> <b>tower</b> at the end, although the tower would have also provided much needed ventilation. Other services provided at the site include a camp-site of huts, mess and toilet facilities and a power generator. These were constructed {{at the base of the}} hill on the north-western side.|$|E

2500|$|The Multi-storey {{car park}} had seven tiers of parking decks. These were raised above the {{adjoining}} shopping centre by a [...] "forest" [...] of piloti columns.

Each level of car park was therefore uninterrupted, so that when viewed from a distance the sky was visible through the structure. A cafe unit in a contrasting box structure sat above the top tier of the car park connected to the <b>access</b> <b>towers</b> by an expressed glazed 'bridge' and an open walkway. The cafe had large windows providing views across the Tyne Valley.|$|R
40|$|We {{developed}} a ground-based method for estimating {{leaf area index}} (LAI) and vertical distribution of leaf area density (LAD) for two Betula ermanii plots, combining an allometric method for tree leaf area with the MacArthur–Horn (MH) method using a portable laser rangefinder, including a correction for changes in leaf inclination angle along the vertical gradient measured with a portable digital protractor from a canopy <b>access</b> <b>tower</b> in each plot. Vertical distribution of projected leaf area density obtained by the MH method (LADMH) was transformed to relative distribution for allotting fixed LAI to different heights. Hence, we first {{developed a}}n allometric method for estimating tree leaf area for LAI determination. Trunk cross-sectional area at branching height (AB) was accurately estimated (r 2 = 0. 97) from ground-based measurements of tree dimensions. We used this method to apply pipe model allometry between tree leaf area and AB, and estimated LAI (4. 56 and 4. 57 m 2 m– 2). We then examined how leaf inclination angle affected estimation of the vertical distribution of actual LAD. Leaf inclination angle measurements revealed that actual LAD in the upper canopy was 1. 5 – 1. 8 -times higher than LADMH, because of steep leaf inclination, while the correction factor was 1. 15 – 1. 25 in the lower canopy. Due to the difference among heights, vertical distribution of LAD estimated with correction for vertical change in leaf inclination was more skewed to the upper canopy than that without correction. We also showed that error in LAD distribution can result if horizontal canopy heterogeneity is neglected when applying the MH method...|$|E
