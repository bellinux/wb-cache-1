500|$|Eventually Butler's {{leadership}} {{style and the}} directness of actions undermined his support within the community. His departure seemed imminent. Mayor Kendrick reported to the press, [...] "I {{had the guts to}} bring General Butler to Philadelphia <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> guts to fire him." [...] Feeling that his duties in Philadelphia were coming to an end, Butler contacted General Lejeune to prepare for his return to the Marine Corps. Not all of the city felt he was doing a bad job, though, and when the news started to break that he would be leaving, people began to gather at the Academy of Music. A group of 4,000 supporters assembled and negotiated a truce between him and the mayor to keep him in Philadelphia for a while longer, and the president authorized a one-year extension.|$|E
500|$|During {{his tenure}} Kennedy {{became one of}} the most {{recognizable}} and influential members of his party, and was sometimes called a [...] "Democratic icon" [...] as well as [...] "The Lion of the Senate". Kennedy and his Senate staff authored around 2,500bills, of which more than 300 were enacted into law. Kennedy co-sponsored another 550bills that became law after 1973. Kennedy was known for his effectiveness in dealing with Republican senators and administrations, sometimes to the irritation of other Democrats. During the 101st Congress under President George H. W. Bush, at least half of the successful proposals put forward by the Senate Democratic policy makers came out of Kennedy's Labor and Human Resources Committee. During the 2000s, almost every bipartisan bill signed during the George W. Bush administration had significant involvement from Kennedy. A late 2000s survey of Republican senators ranked Kennedy first among Democrats in bipartisanship. Kennedy strongly believed in the principle [...] "never let the perfect be the enemy of the good," [...] and would agree to pass legislation he viewed as incomplete or imperfect with the goal of improving it down the road. In April 2006, Kennedy was selected by Time as one of [...] "America's 10 Best Senators"; the magazine noted that he had [...] "amassed a titanic record of legislation affecting the lives of virtually every man, woman and child in the country" [...] and that [...] "by the late 1990s, the liberal icon had become such a prodigious cross-aisle dealer that Republican leaders began pressuring party colleagues not to sponsor bills with him". In May 2008, soon-to-be Republican presidential nominee John McCain said, [...] " [...] is a legendary lawmaker <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> highest respect for him. When we have worked together, he has been a skillful, fair and generous partner." [...] Republican Governor of California and Kennedy relative Arnold Schwarzenegger described [...] "Uncle Teddy" [...] as [...] "a liberal icon, a warrior for the less fortunate, a fierce advocate for health-care reform, a champion of social justice here and abroad" [...] and [...] "the rock of his family". At the time of Kennedy's death, sociologist and Nation board member Norman Birnbaum wrote that Kennedy had come to be viewed as the [...] "voice" [...] and [...] "conscience" [...] of American progressivism.|$|E

2500|$|The ritualistic {{elements}} {{involved in}} the execution of Coleman’s murder {{may have been in}} response to a public sermon made three years earlier by Brigham Young on March 3, 1863. In this sermon, Young states, “I am a human being, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> care of human beings. I wish to save life, and have no desire to destroy life. If I had my wish, I should entirely stop the shedding of human blood.” Following this statement, however, Young makes a statement regarding interracial relations in which he continues, [...] "Shall I tell you the law of God in regard to the African race? If the white man who belongs to the chosen seed mixes his blood with the seed of Cain, the penalty, under the law of God, is death on the spot. This will always be so." [...] Young continues his sermon by condemning whites for their abuse of slaves with the proclamation, “for their abuse of that race, the whites will be cursed, unless they repent.” ...|$|E

We have to lower the key when I sing live." [...] Bieber guest-starred in the season premiere of the CBS crime drama , which aired on September 23, 2010. He played a [...] "troubled teen who is faced with a difficult decision regarding his only brother", who is also a serial bomber. Bieber was also in a subsequent episode which aired on February 17, 2011, in which his character is killed.
