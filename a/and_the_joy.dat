500|$|The Eucharistic hymn, with a tune that {{alternates}} in {{an intriguing}} way between phrases {{of two and}} three measures, appears in three movements, the opening chorale fantasia, within a recitative and as the closing four-part chorale.

Alfred Dürr compares the opening chorus and both arias to dances: movement 1 to a gigue, movement 2 to a bourrée, and movement 5 to a polonaise. All movements are set in the major mode. The inner movements are distinguished by their obbligato instruments.

Helen McCarthy in 500 Essential Anime Movies said that the natural world was [...] "beautifully represented", with [...] "some absolutely breathtaking mountains and lakeside landscapes". She also praised the design of the Castle and added that Miyazaki added his own themes to the film: [...] "man's relationship to nature, the futility of war, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>joy</b> of flight". Joel Morgenstern of The Wall Street Journal called the film [...] "a moveable feast of delights". Richard Corliss of TIME magazine wrote, [...] "Palaces and shimmering lakes, warplanes and fire sprites all come to life at the breath of Miyazaki's graphic genius." [...] Writing for The Boston Globe, Ty Burr said, [...] "At its best, 'Howl's Moving Castle' offers a rich fantasy of adolescent escape, of romance in the old and epic sense. At its worst, it's the most amazing 12-course meal you can't bring yourself to finish." [...] A.O. Scott of The New York Times wrote, [...] "Admirers of [...] work, which is wildly imaginative, emotionally intense and surpassingly gentle, will find much to appreciate in this film because it demonstrates, once again, his visual ingenuity and his sensitivity as a storyteller.

500|$|Entertainment Weeklys Ken Tucker {{gave the}} episode an A, posing the question: [...] "Has there {{ever been a}} TV show more aptly named than Glee? It both embodies and inspires exactly that quality." [...] Glee was the top ranked topic on social {{networking}} site Twitter {{on the night of}} its initial airing. Alessandra Stanley for The New York Times called the show [...] "blissfully unoriginal in a witty, imaginative way", saying the characters are [...] "high school archetypes" [...] but noted [...] "a strong satiric pulse that doesn’t diminish the characters’ identities or dim the showmanship of a talented cast". The Daily News David Hinckley wrote that the show [...] "isn't close to perfect" [...] but [...] "has likable characters, {{a good sense of humor}} and a reasonably deft touch with music." [...] He called the pilot episode [...] "not very plausible" [...] but [...] "potentially heartwarming", writing of the musical choices: [...] "The duet of [...] "You're the One That I Want" [...] from Grease may be a little obvious, but setting a group dance routine to Amy Winehouse's [...] "Rehab" [...] shows some inspiration. Whether Glee can hold that note remains a very unanswered question. But it will at least be worth watching to see." [...] USA Today Robert Bianco assessed: [...] "There's a lot to like here: the exuberance of the musical numbers, the bite to the comedy <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>joy</b> of seeing something different.

500|$|Despite being {{promoted}} as the show's heart and moral conscience, {{the flaws in}} Gwen's own morality are explored throughout the series; a press release noted that she is both selfless and selfish. The first series sees Gwen embark on a brief affair with colleague Owen Harper. Executive producer Russell T Davies explains that the episode [...] "Countrycide" [...] was deliberately structured {{in order to make}} the affair seem inevitable as Gwen struggles to cope with Torchwood life. For Davies, the dalliance is a [...] "human" [...] one, told in an adult manner characterised by [...] "lust and anger and hurt <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>joy</b> you get out of the initial stages of having an affair". Myles commented that Gwen's compromised morality, as demonstrated by her affair was suitably challenging for a science fiction audience, and served to demonstrate that none of the Torchwood team were [...] "safe" [...] from temptation. Writer Stephen James Walker argues that Gwen's moral ambiguity made her a more compelling character. Since she was introduced as an audience surrogate, Walker claimed it would have been an easy trap to make her a [...] "one-dimensional paragon of virtue". Instead, the writers made Gwen more [...] "realistic" [...] by giving her [...] "distinct human failings", which Walker felt made her [...] "arguably the most complex and interesting of the five regulars". He identified these failures as her [...] "tendency towards egotism", [...] "self-righteousness", and [...] "selfishness", evident in her [...] "highly questionable treatment" [...] of boyfriend Rhys Williams. Walker cited her affair with Owen as an example, as well as the scene in [...] "Combat" [...] where she confesses this betrayal to Rhys after dosing him with the amnesia drug Retcon so he won't remember.|$|E
