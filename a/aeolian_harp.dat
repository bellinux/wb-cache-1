500|$|The poem {{creates a}} series of oppositional themes with aspects of nature {{representing}} each: seduction and innocence, order and chaos. These oppositions establish tension before the poem asks {{as to how they}} can be reconciled. These images and their being reconciled are described as analogous to the effects of an <b>Aeolian</b> <b>harp</b> and Coleridge's pantheistic feelings towards nature. In terms of religion, The Eolian Harp describes the mind's desire to seek after the divine. His approach is similar to Ralph Cudworth's in The True Intellectual System of the Universe. [...] However, Coleridge's pantheistic feelings on nature are said to receive reproof from Fricker, and Coleridge returns to a more traditional view of God that deals more with faith than finding the divine within nature.|$|E

500|$|The poem {{portrays a}} series of oppositional ideas {{and how they can}} be {{reconciled}} with each other. The image of a beanfield is contrasted against the image of a lute while they are compared to the image of a coy woman being caressed and then resisting the caresses. This image is compounded with the coy woman being caressed compared to the innocence of Fricker. Nature is also seen in its oppositions, with a wildness within nature being contrasted with order within nature, especially in regards to the effects of an <b>Aeolian</b> <b>harp</b> and Coleridge's pantheistic feelings about nature. In terms of religion, The Eolian Harp describes the mind's desire to seek after the divine. Coleridge's approach is similar to Ralph Cudworth's in The True Intellectual System of the Universe.

500|$|The Eolian Harp is a poem {{written by}} Samuel Taylor Coleridge in 1795 and {{published}} in his 1796 poetry collection. It {{is one of the}} early conversation poems and discusses Coleridge's anticipation of a marriage with Sara Fricker along with the pleasure of conjugal love. However, The Eolian Harp is not a love poem and instead focuses on man's relationship with nature. The central images of the poem is an <b>Aeolian</b> <b>harp,</b> an item that represents both order and wildness in nature. Along with the harp is a series of oppositional ideas that are reconciled with each other. The Eolian Harp also contains a discussion on [...] "One Life", Coleridge's idea that humanity and nature are united along with his desire to try to find the divine within nature. The poem was well received for both its discussion of nature and its aesthetic qualities.|$|E
500|$|After the poem's {{original}} creation, it {{was expanded}} {{from its original}} use of an <b>Aeolian</b> <b>harp</b> as its theme over the months that followed. However, Coleridge did not stop working on it {{when it was first}} published. Instead, the poem was expanded and rewritten throughout Coleridge's life until 1817. Of the final version, lines 21–25 were previously removed between the 1797 and 1815 editions of Coleridge's poems. Likewise, lines 26–33 were altered through the multiple editions. Regardless of the amount of editing, Coleridge believed that the poem served as a model for other poems, especially those in the series called Conversation poems. Of The Eolian Harp as a model for poetry, Coleridge wrote, [...] "Let me be excused, if it should seem to others too mere a trifle to justify my noticing it—but I have some claim to the thanks of no small number of the readers of poetry in having first introduced this species of short blank verse poems—of which Southey, Lamb, Wordsworth, and others have since produced so many exquisite specimens." ...|$|E

500|$|The poem {{discusses}} love, sex, and marriage, {{but it is}} {{not done}} {{in the form of a}} love poem. Instead, it compares love with an <b>Aeolian</b> <b>harp,</b> which is a symbol of poetry. In terms of the relationship described, the desire expressed during an engagement with Fricker is described as innocent. Also, the anticipation of the conjugal union is free of any potential disappointment or any guilt that would result in sex outside of marriage. As such, there is a thematic connection with the poem [...] "Lines Written at Shurton Bars" [...] written on the same subject around the same time. As the poem was completed after Coleridge's marriage, the themes became similar to the ideas expressed in his Reflections on Having Left a Place of Retirement. Both poems discuss the Clevedon area and the impact of the countryside upon the viewer. Also, they provide information on how Coleridge and Fricker felt during their relationship and marriage. However, Reflections suggests that there are some problems within the relationship.|$|E
500|$|The poem {{discusses}} {{his understanding}} of nature within the concept of [...] "One Life", an idea that {{is presented as a}} resulting from Coleridge's reflection on his experiences at Clevedon. The conversation poems as a whole are connected to the ideas within The Eolian Harp that deal with understanding the universe. The [...] "One Life" [...] lines added to the 1817 edition interconnect the senses and also connects sensation and experience of the divine with the music of the <b>Aeolian</b> <b>harp.</b> Although the earlier editions do not include the same understanding of perception, there traces of the idea expressed in the earlier editions. Coleridge derived his early understanding from the works of Jakob Böhme, of which he wrote in a 4 July 1817 letter to Ludwig Tieck: [...] "Before my visit to Germany in September, 1798, I had adopted (probably from Behmen's Aurora, which I had conjured over at School) the idea, that Sound was = Light under the praepotence of Gravitation, and Color = Gravitation under the praepotence of Light: and I have never seen reason to change my faith in this respect." [...] Along with this view of sensation, Coleridge adopted Böhme's idea of connecting to God through the will instead of the intellect, and that pantheism should be denied. Coleridge also relies in part on Böhme's understanding of polarity of opposites in his own views of Polar Logic and man's attempt to return to Paradise.|$|E

2500|$|Beginning in {{the early}} 1920s, Cowell toured widely in North America and Europe as a pianist, playing his own {{experimental}} works, seminal explorations of atonality, polytonality, polyrhythms, and non-Western modes. It was {{on one of these}} tours that in 1923, his friend Richard Buhlig introduced Cowell to young pianist Grete Sultan in Berlin. They worked closely togetheran aspect vital to Grete Sultan's personal and artistic development. Cowell later made such an impression with his tone cluster technique that Béla Bartók requested his permission to adopt it. Another novel method advanced by Cowell, in pieces such as <b>Aeolian</b> <b>Harp</b> (ca. 1923), was what he dubbed [...] "string piano"—rather than using the keys to play, the pianist reaches inside the instrument and plucks, sweeps, and otherwise manipulates the strings directly. Cowell's endeavors with string piano techniques were the primary inspiration for John Cage's development of the prepared piano. In early chamber music pieces, such as Quartet Romantic (1915–17) and Quartet Euphometric (1916–19 [...] ), Cowell pioneered a compositional approach he called [...] "rhythm-harmony": [...] "Both quartets are polyphonic, and each melodic strand has its own rhythm," [...] he explained. [...] "Even the canon in the first movement of the Romantic has different note-lengths for each voice." ...|$|E
2500|$|Cowell {{pursued a}} radical {{compositional}} approach through the mid-1930s, with solo piano pieces remaining {{at the heart}} of his output—important works from this era include The Banshee (1925), requiring numerous playing methods such as pizzicato and longitudinal sweeping and scraping of the strings (...) , and the manic, cluster-filled Tiger (1930), inspired by William Blake's famous poem. Much of Cowell's public reputation continued to be based on his trademark pianistic technique: a critic for the San Francisco News, writing in 1932, referred to Cowell's [...] "famous 'tone clusters,' probably the most startling and original contribution any American has yet contributed to the field of music." [...] A prolific composer of songs (he would write over 180 during his career), Cowell returned in 1930–31 to <b>Aeolian</b> <b>Harp,</b> adapting it as the accompaniment to a vocal setting of a poem by his father, How Old Is Song? He built on his substantial oeuvre of chamber music, with pieces such as the Adagio for Cello and Thunder Stick (1924) that explored unusual instrumentation and others that were even more progressive: Six Casual Developments (1933), for clarinet and piano, sounds like something Jimmy Giuffre would compose thirty years later. His Ostinato Pianissimo (1934) placed him in the vanguard of those writing original scores for percussion ensemble. He created forceful large-ensemble pieces during this period as well, such as the Concerto for Piano and Orchestra (1928)—with its three movements, [...] "Polyharmony," [...] "Tone Cluster," [...] and [...] "Counter Rhythm" [...] (...) —and the Sinfonietta (1928), whose scherzo Anton Webern conducted in Vienna. In the early 1930s, Cowell began to delve seriously into aleatoric procedures, creating opportunities for performers to determine primary elements of a score's realization. One of his major chamber pieces, the Mosaic Quartet (String Quartet No. 3) (1935), is scored as a collection of five movements with no preordained sequence.|$|E

Kinetic sculptures are sculptures that are designed to move, which include mobiles. Snow sculptures are usually carved out of a single block of snow about [...] on each side and weighing about 20–30 tons.

He had been caught in a vortex and was being whirled on with a velocity of advance and gyration that made him giddy and sick. In a few moments he was flung upon the gravel {{at the foot of}} the left bank of the stream --the southern bank--and behind a projecting point which concealed him from his enemies. The sudden arrest of his motion, the abrasion of one of his hands on the gravel, restored him, and he wept with delight. He dug his fingers into the sand, threw it over himself in handfuls and audibly blessed it. It looked like diamonds, rubies, emeralds; he could think of nothing beautiful which it did not resemble. The trees upon the bank were giant garden plants; he noted a definite order in their arrangement, inhaled the fragrance of their blooms. A strange, roseate light shone through the spaces among their trunks and the wind made in their branches the music of <b>æolian</b> <b>harps.</b> He had no wish to perfect his escape--was content to remain in that enchanting spot until retaken.|$|R
