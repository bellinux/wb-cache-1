5|$|<b>A</b> <b>close</b> {{binary star}} system occurs when two stars orbit {{each other with}} an average {{separation}} that is of the same order of magnitude as their diameters. At these distances, more complex interactions can occur, such as tidal effects, transfer of mass and even collisions. Tidal interactions in <b>a</b> <b>close</b> binary system can result in modification of the orbital and rotational parameters. The total angular momentum {{of the system is}} conserved, but the angular momentum can be transferred between the orbital periods and the rotation rates.|$|E

5000|$|<b>A</b> <b>closed</b> {{immersion}} is finite and radicial (universally injective). In particular, <b>a</b> <b>closed</b> immersion {{is universally}} <b>closed.</b> <b>A</b> <b>closed</b> immersion is stable under base change and composition.

40|$|We {{prove the}} {{existence}} of <b>a</b> <b>closed</b> regularization of the integration current associated to an effective analytic cycle, with a bounded negative part. By means of the King formula, we are reduced to regularize <b>a</b> <b>closed</b> differential form with L 1 loc coefficients, which by extension has a test value on any positive current with the same support as the cycle. As a consequence, the restriction of <b>a</b> <b>closed</b> positive current to <b>a</b> <b>closed</b> analytic submanifold is well defined as <b>a</b> <b>closed</b> positive current. Lastly, given <b>a</b> <b>closed</b> smooth differential (qʹ, qʹ) -form on <b>a</b> <b>closed</b> analytic submanifold, we prove {{the existence of}} <b>a</b> <b>closed</b> (qʹ, qʹ) -current having a restriction equal to that differential form.
