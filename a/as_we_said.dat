2500|$|A Duke University {{spokesperson}} {{responded that}} [...] "e have now seen the lawsuit and <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>said</b> before, if these plaintiffs have a complaint, {{it is with}} Mr. Nifong. Their legal strategy – attacking Duke – is misdirected and without merit. To help these families move on, Duke offered {{to cover the cost}} of any attorneys' fees or other out-of-pocket expenses, but they rejected this offer. We will vigorously defend the university against these claims." [...] The city never released an official response to the suit. The lawsuit against the university was settled out of court in 2013. Neither side would discuss the details of the settlement.|$|E
2500|$|... "The natives {{are healthy}} and clean, and {{although}} the island of Cebu is also healthful and had a good climate, most of its inhabitants are always afflicted with the itch and buboes. In the island of Panay, the natives declare that no {{one of them had}} ever been afflicted with buboes until the people from Bohol - who, <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>said</b> above, abandoned Bohol on account of the people of Maluco - came to settle in Panay, and gave the disease to some of the natives. For these reasons the governor, Don Gonzalo Ronquillo, founded the town of Arevalo, {{on the south side of}} this island; for the island runs north and south, and on that side live the majority of the people, and the villages are near this town, and the land here is more fertile." ...|$|E
2500|$|Meanwhile, Emperor Susenyos was {{preoccupied with}} raiding {{parties of the}} Oromo. An initial {{encounter}} with the Marawa Oromo near the upper course of the Reb River ended in a defeat for the Ethiopians; Susenyos rallied his men and made a second attack which scattered the Oromo. The Marawa allied with other Oromo, and the united force entered Begemder to avenge their defeat. Upon hearing of this, the Emperor responded by summoning his son-in-law Qegnazmach Julius and Kifla Krestos to join him with their troops, and defeated the raiders at Ebenat on 17 January 1608. According to James Bruce, the Royal Chronicle of Susenyos reports 12,000 Oromo were killed while only 400 on the Emperor's side were lost. With the Oromo threat dealt with, Susenyos now could turn his attention to Yaqob the pretender; he marched to Axum {{by way of the}} Lamalmo and Waldebba, where he was formally [...] crowned Emperor 18 March 1608, in a ceremony described by João Gabriel, the captain of the Portuguese in Ethiopia. Despite this act legitimizing his rule, Susenyos had no luck capturing the pretender, and was forced to leave the task to his servant Amsala Krestos. Amsala Krestos induced two brothers who had joined the rebellion to assassinate Yaqob the pretender, who then sent the dead man's head to Susenyos. Without a scarf obscuring his features, writes Bruce, [...] "it now appeared, that he had neither scars in his face, broken jaw, nor loss of teeth; but the covering was intending only to conceal the little resemblance he bore to king Jacob, slain, <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>said</b> before, at the battle of Lebart." ...|$|E
60|$|It was at {{this point}} in the evening that Jack resolved, <b>as</b> <b>we</b> have <b>said,</b> to be condescending.|$|R
6000|$|... "What shall {{you do in}} life?" [...] said Dorothea, timidly. [...] "Have your {{intentions}} remained {{just the}} same <b>as</b> when <b>we</b> <b>said</b> good-by before?" ...|$|R
60|$|The doctor, <b>as</b> <b>we</b> have <b>said,</b> read it twice; and he at once {{resolved}} stoutly that {{he would}} not go.|$|R
6000|$|Between {{which two}} great Silences, do not, <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>said,</b> all human Noises, in the naturalest times, most preternaturally march and roll?-- ...|$|E
6000|$|... "The money, if he DOESN'T go in?"--Mitchy broke almost {{with an air}} of {{responsibility}} into Vanderbank's silence. [...] "Ah but, <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>said,</b> surely--!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>said</b> before, Gale," [...] Fortescue urged, [...] "why shouldn't {{they now}} attack us, {{if they wanted}} to? We have been here more than an hour." ...|$|E
60|$|But let us {{return to}} Mr Sharp. Having, <b>as</b> <b>we</b> have <b>said,</b> {{gone to his}} office, he found his {{faithful}} servant Blunt there.|$|R
60|$|On {{this scene}} the {{nautical}} man stood gazing, <b>as</b> <b>we</b> have <b>said,</b> with much interest; {{but he was}} too polite to gaze long.|$|R
60|$|As she spoke, {{a fierce}} yell was heard issuing from the keeper's cottage, which, <b>as</b> <b>we</b> have <b>said,</b> stood {{close to his}} mother's abode.|$|R
6000|$|... "Now you {{see what}} we have done," [...] said the Wax-moths. [...] "We have created New Material, a New Convention, a New Type, <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>said</b> we would." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "IN NOMINE DOMINI, <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>said</b> at Mareschal-College--SANTISSMA MADRE DI DIOS, as the Spaniard has it--ALLE GUTEN GEISTER LOBEN DEN HERRN, saith {{the blessed}} Psalmist, in Dr. Luther's translation--" ...|$|E
60|$|The Giant picked {{himself up}} and pulled himself together, <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>said,</b> and then {{approached}} Jaqueline in a very civil way, for a person of his breeding, head in hand.|$|E
6000|$|... "Les moustaches," [...] gasped Joe; [...] "les moustaches--coupy, rasy, vite!"--his French was of this sort--voluble, <b>as</b> <b>we</b> have <b>said,</b> but not {{remarkable}} for grammar.|$|R
60|$|Lifting his eyes, <b>as</b> <b>we</b> have <b>said,</b> while thus regretfully and despairingly muttering these words, he saw Middleton {{against the}} oak, within three paces of him.|$|R
60|$|But, <b>as</b> <b>we</b> have <b>said,</b> {{this effect}} was not immediate, and he {{remained}} {{in a state of}} uncertainty and sadness while the warlike councils and preparations went on.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{will run}} home now, Bill; mother will likely enough {{hear of the}} fire, and <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>said</b> we should be back soon after eight she will be getting anxious." ...|$|E
60|$|Can Mrs. Jones have rushed {{him back}} and hidden him away in Nebraska? I {{remember}} that <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>said</b> good-bye, there was that in her smile that recalled the vulpine complacency of Mona Lisa, the Wise.|$|E
60|$|Karlsefin, <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>said,</b> was {{somewhat}} more expert {{than most of}} the men in managing canoes, and Krake, besides having had more experience than many of his fellows, had once before visited and ascended this rapid. They therefore made the ascent almost as well as the Scots had done.|$|E
60|$|Besides {{being such}} a fine religionist, Miss Crawley was, <b>as</b> <b>we</b> have <b>said,</b> an Ultra-liberal in opinions, and always took {{occasion}} to express these in the most candid manner.|$|R
5000|$|... "And women, <b>as</b> <b>we</b> have <b>said,</b> have a {{great deal}} to do with the {{condition}} in general, although they have enjoyed the full co-operation of men in bringing it about." ...|$|R
60|$|As for {{the rest}} of the crew--Big Swinton, Little Stubbs, George Blazer, Squill, and the like--it was well, <b>as</b> <b>we</b> have <b>said,</b> that they could not see into the future.|$|R
60|$|Of course Queeker's secret mission was, for {{the time}} being, at an end;--and thus it came to pass that an old pump, <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>said</b> at the {{beginning}} of this chapter, was the cause of the failure of several deep-laid plans, and of much bodily anguish and mental felicity to the youthful Nimrod.|$|E
60|$|But, <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>said</b> before, {{all this}} was talked about; and ladies in their letters, chronicling {{the events of the}} passing hour, sent the tidings up and down the country; and so Miss Letitia Ferguson got a letter from Mrs. Wilcox with full {{pictures}} and comments; and she brought the same to Grace Seymour.|$|E
60|$|L (seeing {{objections}} {{begin to}} express themselves in the eyes). Now you needn't say you can't; for you can: and it's what you were meant to do, always; and to dress your houses, and your gardens, too; and to do very little else, I believe, except singing; and dancing, <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>said,</b> of course; and--one thing more.|$|E
6000|$|... "Please set me {{down before}} the others come up!" [...] whispered Manuela, who, having, <b>as</b> <b>we</b> have <b>said,</b> half fainted, had allowed {{her head to}} fall on her rescuer's shoulder.|$|R

60|$|But {{a little}} later he drew for his private partisans this bitter poetical {{indictment}} against her, which, <b>as</b> <b>we</b> have <b>said,</b> was used discreetly during his life, and published after his death.|$|R
60|$|But, <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>said,</b> this is {{a glorious}} July evening,--and you may discern two figures picking their way over those low sunken rocks, yellowed with seaweed, of which we have often spoken. They are Moses and Sally going on an evening walk to that {{favorite}} grotto retreat, which has so often been spoken of {{in the course of}} this history.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh {{you must}} take it all quietly. You're of a special class; one of those who, <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>said</b> the other day--don't you remember?--are a source of the sacred terror. People made {{in such a way}} must take the consequences; just as people must take them," [...] Mitchy went on, [...] "who are made as I am. So cheer up!" ...|$|E
6000|$|But Johnson only ran off, {{to return}} [...] With many other warriors, <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>said,</b> [...] Unto that rather {{somewhat}} misty bourn, [...] Which Hamlet tells us is a pass of dread. [...] To Jack howe'er this gave but slight concern: [...] His soul (like galvanism upon the dead) [...] Acted upon the living as on wire, [...] And led {{them back into}} the heaviest fire.|$|E
60|$|Now, <b>as</b> <b>we</b> have <b>said,</b> {{there are}} three grades in the kind and {{character}} of the measures which may be considered violent that a mother may resort to {{in a case like}} this.|$|R
60|$|The captain {{admitted}} that the difficulties were great and his countenance grew longer, for, being <b>as</b> <b>we</b> have <b>said</b> a remarkably sympathetic man, the emotions of his heart were quickly telegraphed to his features.|$|R
60|$|Well, one day, <b>as</b> <b>we</b> have <b>said,</b> Charlie Considine rode {{towards the}} farm. He {{had been out}} hunting alone, and a {{springbok}} tied across the horse behind him showed {{that he had been}} successful.|$|R
