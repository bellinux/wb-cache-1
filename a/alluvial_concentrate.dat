40|$|Crystals of {{essentially}} nonmetamict nioboeschynite-(Ce), {{a complex}} oxide {{with the general}} formula AB. O", were identified in an <b>alluvial</b> <b>concentrate</b> from the Tofty tin belt in central Alaska. The mineral grains are mostly sand-size (0. 2 to L 5 mm), red-brown to dark brown, generally tabular, slender to stubby striated prisms, Crystal parameters of this rare orthorhombic mineral are: a = 5. 396, b = 11. 085, c...|$|E
40|$|Three <b>alluvial</b> zircon <b>{{concentrate}}s</b> {{from the}} Blue Tier region were dated by the fission-track method. Euhedral zircons in one concentrate gave {{an age of}} 367 + or - 15 m. y., confirming their derivation from Upper Devonian granites. Zircons from the other concentrates are rounded and gave a combined age of 46. 7 + or - 0. 6 m. y., agreeing with K/Ar results for Blue Tier basalts. -R. A. H. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
50|$|Although gold {{had been}} {{discovered}} in various locations in South Africa, such as Barberton and Pilgrim's Rest, {{as well as at}} several sites near the Witwatersrand, these were <b>alluvial</b> <b>concentrates</b> in contemporary rivers, or in quartz veins, in the form that gold had always been found elsewhere on earth. When George Harrison, probably accompanied by George Walker, found gold on the farm Langlaagte, 5 km west of the city of Johannesburg, in an outcrop of conglomerate rocks, in February 1886, they assumed that this was alluvial gold in an old riverbed, that had been tilted as a result of earth movements. However, when it was found that, traced downdip, the conglomerate was not merely developed for the narrow width of a river, but continued in depth, there came the realisation that this conglomeratic zone was part of a sedimentary succession. Harrison had stumbled on the Main Reef conglomerate (part of the “Johannesburg Subgroup” of rocks — see illustration above). The conglomerate was quickly traced east and westward for a total continuous distance of 50 km to define {{what became known as the}} “Central Rand Gold Field”.|$|R
40|$|Potassium (K) {{balances}} provide {{crucial information}} for assessment of fertilizer needs and sustainability of rice cropping systems. Potassium input-output balances constructed for wetland rice inAsia often include only a few, selected {{aspects of a}} full K budgetsuch as fertilizer K as input {{and the amount of}} K removed by the crop as output (e. g. Patnaik, 1978; Bajwa, 1994; Dobermann, et al., 1996). In this study, we use a complete K budgeting approach to assess K inputs from sedimentation by annual flooding in double- and triple-crop systems of the Mekong River Delta in South Vietnam (Figure 1), which supplies about 50 % of Vietnam’s rice (Maclean et al., 2002). Rice is grown on <b>alluvial</b> soil <b>concentrated</b> {{along the banks of the}} Mekong and Bassac rivers (30 % of the area), acid sulfate soils (45 %), and coastal saline soils (20 %). About 70 % of the rice is grown with irrigation, the rest under rainfed conditions. The area with two rice crops per year is about 1. 3 million hectares (M ha), and three crops are grown on about 0. 4 M ha. The water depth of annual floods is greatest in the north of the river delta, while the south is less affected (Figure 1). The sedimen...|$|R
40|$|Considerable {{attention}} {{has been focused on}} the role of gullies as a contributor to contemporary sediment loads of rivers in Australia. In southern Australia rapid acceleration of hillslope gully erosion has been widely documented in the post-European period (sim last 200 years). In the northern Australian tropics, however, gully erosion processes operating along alluvial plains have not been well documented and can differ substantially from those gullies eroding into colluvium on hillslopes. Aerial reconnaissance surveys in 2004 along 13 500 km of the main stem rivers that drain into the Gulf of Carpentaria (GoC), identified extensive areas of alluvial lands that have been impacted by a pervasive form of gully erosion. More detailed remote sensing based mapping within the 31 000 km 2 Mitchell River fluvial megafan has identified that active gullying into alluvium occupies sim 0 紥 (129 km 2) of the lower Mitchell catchment. These <b>alluvial</b> gullies are <b>concentrated</b> along main drainage channels and their scarp heights are highly correlated to the local relief between the floodplain and river thalweg. While river incision into the megafan since the Pleistocene has developed the relief potential for erosion, other factors such as floodplain hydrology, soil dispersibility, and vegetation also influence the distribution of gullies. In this paper we present a conceptual model of alluvial gullies, and contend that they represent a distinct end member in the continuum of gully forms that have been described in the geomorphic literature. An understanding of the processes driving this form of alluvial gullying can only be gained when they are differentiated from widely described colluvial hillslope gully models and theories. We present evidence of type examples of alluvial gullying in the Mitchell, and through analysis of their distribution and morphology at different scales, highlight some of the key mechanisms that are potentially initiating these features and driving their expansion.
