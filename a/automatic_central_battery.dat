5000|$|Originally, power rings {{were unable}} to affect objects colored yellow, though Lanterns have {{typically}} found ways around the limitation by indirect manipulation. The reason why the rings {{were unable to}} affect yellow objects has changed significantly from writer to writer. In early stories, {{it was because of}} a design flaw. Gerard Jones revised this, in a story that revealed that the Guardians could change the weakness randomly and at will. After the destruction of the <b>central</b> <b>battery</b> Ganthet revealed to Kyle Rayner that an [...] "imperfection" [...] in the <b>central</b> <b>battery</b> was responsible for the yellow weakness (which his ring did not share as there was no <b>Central</b> <b>Battery</b> {{at the time it was}} created). In Green Lantern: Rebirth, writer Geoff Johns revealed that the [...] "yellow impurity" [...] was the result of Parallax, a yellow energy being made of pure fear, which had been imprisoned in the <b>Central</b> Power <b>Battery.</b> This change to the fictional history also allowed characters to overcome the yellow weakness by recognizing the fear behind it and facing that fear.|$|R

5|$|The Roma {{class was}} {{designed}} by Insp. Eng. Giuseppe De Luca, who initially planned to build both ships as broadside ironclads. By this time, however, other navies had begun to build <b>central</b> <b>battery</b> ships, which concentrated {{a smaller number of}} guns in an armored casemate that had limited capability for end-on fire. This change allowed the ship to be shorter, which in turn required less armor and made the ship more maneuverable. As a result, De Luca re-designed the second ship of the class, , into a <b>central</b> <b>battery</b> ironclad while she was under construction.|$|R
50|$|Originally {{classified}} as armored corvettes, the General-Admirals were redesignated as semi-armored frigates on 24 March 1875. They {{were laid out}} as <b>central</b> <b>battery</b> ironclads with the armament concentrated amidships.|$|R
5000|$|The <b>central</b> <b>battery</b> ship, {{also known}} as a centre battery ship in the United Kingdom and as a casemate ship in European {{continental}} navies, was a development of the (high-freeboard) broadside ironclad of the 1860s, given a substantial boost due to the inspiration gained from the Battle of Hampton Roads, the very first battle between ironclads fought in 1862 during the American Civil War. One of the participants was the Confederate casemate ironclad , essentially a <b>central</b> <b>battery</b> ship herself, albeit a low-freeboard one. The <b>central</b> <b>battery</b> ships had their main guns concentrated {{in the middle of the}} ship in an armoured citadel. [...] The concentration of armament amidships meant the ship could be shorter and handier than a broadside type like previous warships. In this manner the design could maximize the thickness of armour in a limited area while still carrying a significant broadside. These ships meant the end of the armoured frigates with their full-length gun decks.|$|R
50|$|For a 208 VAC {{emergency}} supply system, a <b>central</b> <b>battery</b> system with <b>automatic</b> controls, {{located in the}} power station building, is used to avoid long electric supply wires. This <b>central</b> <b>battery</b> system consists of lead-acid battery cell units {{to make up a}} 12 or 24 VDC system as well as stand-by cells, each with its own battery charging unit. Also needed are a voltage sensing unit capable of receiving 208 VAC and an automatic system that is able to signal to and activate the {{emergency supply}} circuit in case of failure of 208 VAC station supply.|$|R
50|$|Venezia was {{designed}} as a broadside ironclad, but other navies had developed the <b>central</b> <b>battery</b> ship while she was under construction, prompting the Italian Navy to re-design the ship. She was armed with a main battery of eighteen 10 in guns placed in a central casemate. The <b>central</b> <b>battery</b> design allowed two guns to fire ahead and two to fire astern. The ship was protected by iron belt armor that was 5.9 in thick and extended for {{the entire length of the}} hull at the waterline. The casemate was protected with 4.75 in of iron plating.|$|R

50|$|The {{philosophy}} of the gun port survived for a time with the <b>central</b> <b>battery</b> ship and the casemates of the secondary batteries of pre-dreadnought and dreadnought battleships, which were intended to repulse torpedo boats.|$|R
50|$|Redoutable was a <b>central</b> <b>battery</b> and barbette ship of the French Navy. She was {{the first}} warship {{in the world to}} use steel as the {{principal}} building material. She was preceded by the Colbert-class ironclads.|$|R
5000|$|Ironclads {{equipped}} with barbettes {{were referred to}} as [...] "barbette ships" [...] much like their contemporaries, turret ships and <b>central</b> <b>battery</b> ships, which mounted their heavy guns in turrets or in a <b>central</b> armored <b>battery.</b> Many navies experimented with all three types in the 1870s and 1880s, including the British Admiral-class battleships, the French s, the Italian s, and the German s, all of which employed barbettes to mount their heavy guns. All of these navies also built turret and or <b>central</b> <b>battery</b> ships during the same period, though none had a decisive advantage over the other. The British and the Russian navies experimented with using disappearing guns afloat, including on the British [...] and the Russian monitor Vitse-admiral Popov {{and some of the}} Ekaterina II class battleships. They were not deemed particularly successful and were not repeated.|$|R
500|$|Fusō had a wrought-iron {{waterline}} armor belt [...] thick amidships that tapered to [...] at {{the ends}} of the ship. The sides of the <b>central</b> <b>battery</b> were 9 inches thick and the transverse bulkheads were [...] thick.|$|R
50|$|Flodo's {{most notable}} {{activity}} in the comics is when he assists Hal Jordan in traveling through the dimensional barrier {{to speak with the}} Guardians of the Universe, after the execution of Sinestro triggered the implosion of the <b>Central</b> Power <b>Battery</b> on Oa, and the subsequent absorption of the Green Lanterns' rings. Flodo and Hal made it through to the Guardians, but in the process, Flodo's ring was absorbed by the <b>Central</b> <b>Battery</b> and his gaseous form dissipated.|$|R
