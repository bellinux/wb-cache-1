Abandoned acacia stands with an invasive behaviour, of environmental concern in many Mediterranean countries, may perform better as biomass producers under summer drought than those coppices. Seedlings of invasive Acacia dealbata, A. melanoxylon and A. pycnantha were planted to test for early growth performance under rain-fed and irrigated conditions. Rooted cuttings of an E. globulus clone were also established as a reference for biomass production. Plants were harvested after one year, sorted by biomass components and oven-dried. Above-ground dry weight was calculated on an area basis, accounting for survival. A. dealbata and A. melanoxylon showed low survival and biomass production, even irrigated, whereas A. pycnantha had better survival and growth performance than eucalypt, even in rain-fed plots, suggesting potential for the harvest of this drought-adapted species as a biomass source.

40|$|Agroforestry {{is a term}} which {{describes}} systems in which trees, animals and/or crops are grown together in intimate mixtures. The term does not include farm woodlands which do not involve significant biological or environmental interactions between the woodland and agricultural components. A number of papers in this volume have discussed the possibility of increasing timber production in Cumbria, in response to Britain's present high rate of timber imports and excess agricultural production. Agroforestry could contribute to this increased timber production in a manner which would be attractive to the farming community because land would sustain a significant agricultural income whilst the trees were maturing. There are several types of agroforestry. Silvoarable systems are mixtures of trees and crops, while silvopastoralism describes intimate mixtures of trees and animals. Agrenforestry is a term used here to emphasize the co-production of bioenergy crops with agricultural and timber crops. Agrenforestry, described later in more detail, could involve strips of <b>energy</b> <b>coppice</b> amongst agricultural crops, {{or the use of}} coppice beneath wide-spaced standard trees.

However, growing demand for dedicated energy crops could lead to conflicts with food production and ecosystem services. This study uses a geographic information systems-embedded modeling approach to assess the spatial supply of short-rotation coppice, taking into account social, economic and environmental constraints. Results: results suggest that 7. 5 million tons of biomass (from short-rotation coppice) is realistically available in England.

This study investigated the potential of co-digestion of grass clippings (waste) in a typical Flemish agro-digester characterized by an input of 30 % manure, 30 % maize silage and 40 % side streams. No significant adverse effects in the microbiological functioning of the reactors were detected when 10 to 20 % out of the 30 % maize input was replaced by grass.

Concerns over the competition for agricultural land resources between food and bioenergy supply hinder the further development of bioenergy, especially in China, the country that needs to feed the world’s largest population.

However, {{there is a lack}} of quantitative studies which estimate the value, contribution, and impact of bioenergy for specific conditions at the county level and provide adequate information to guide local practices.

40|$|The ARBRE (<b>ARable</b> Biomass Renewable <b>Energy)</b> project, {{the first}} {{large-scale}} wood-fueled electricity generating {{plant in the}} U. K., represents a significant development in realising British and European policy objectives on renewable energy. The plant is fueled by a mix of wood from short rotation coppice (SRC) and forest residues. Where feasible, composted/conditioned sewage sludge is applied to coppice sites to increase yields and improve soil structure. In the Yorkshire Water region, typical total N:P:K composition of composted/conditioned sludge is 2. 9 : 3. 8 : 0. 3, respectively. Sludge application is calculated {{on the basis of}} total nitrogen (N) content to achieve 750 kg N ha- 1, for 3 years’ requirement. Willow coppice forms a dense, widely spaced, root network, which, with its long growing season, makes it an effective user of nutrients. This, in combination with willow’s use as a nonfood, nonfodder crop, makes it an attractive route for the recycling of sewage sludge in the absence of sea disposal, banned under the EC Urban Waste Water Treatment Directive (UWWTD). Further work is required on the nutritional requirements of SRC in order to understand better the quantities of sludge that can be applied to SRC without having a detrimental impact on the environment.

Recycling of plant nutrients from waste and by-products from society would reduce the use of chemical fertilisers. These plant nutrient sources are also of interest for organic farming, where chemical fertilisers are not allowed, especially organic farms without access to manure. This thesis assessed {{the environmental impact of}} systems recycling plant nutrients from slaughterhouse waste, toilet waste fractions, digested food waste and mussels too small to be used in food production. The methodology used was life cycle assessment (LCA) and the functional unit was production of 1 kg plant-available nitrogen. The environmental impact categories studied were primary energy use, global warming potential (GWP), potential eutrophication and potential acidification. Flow of cadmium to arable soil, use of non-renewable phosphate rock and potential carbon sequestration were also assessed. In addition, additional functions such as phosphorus added to <b>arable</b> soil, <b>energy</b> production, removal of nitrogen and phosphorus from wastewater streams etc. were considered. The reference scenario for all comparisons was the production and use of chemical fertilisers. In general, storage and spreading of the organic fertilisers contributed greatly to potential eutrophication and acidification, except in the case of meat meal fertiliser, which was in a pseudo-stable form. All investigated fertilisers gave rise to goal conflicts as none of the fertilisers reduced the impact for all impact categories studied. The urine fertiliser reduced the largest amount of impact categories and added the least amount of cadmium to arable soil. Meat meal reduced, or had similar results as the reference scenario, for all impact categories except primary energy use and potential eutrophication. For digested food waste, chemical fertiliser use was an environmentally better option for all impacts. Composting gave rise to large nitrogen emissions, thus anaerobic storage was a better environmental option for mussel treatment. Due to the large amount of phosphorus per kg nitrogen in the compost, the reference scenario used the largest amount of non-renewable phosphate rock.

Paul Robson and Andrea Monti contributed strongly to the writing up. Astley Hastings performed modelling to understand the longer term effects of land use change and to fit our data. To date, most Miscanthus trials and commercial fields have been planted on <b>arable</b> land. <b>Energy</b> crops {{will need to be}} grown more on lower grade lands unsuitable for arable crops. Semi-improved grasslands represent a major land resource for energy crops. In such grasslands, where soil organic carbon (SOC) levels can be high, there have been concerns that the carbon mitigation benefits of bioenergy from Miscanthus could be offset by losses in SOC associated with land use change. At a site in Wales (UK), we quantified the relatively short-term impacts (6 years) of four novel Miscanthushybrids andMiscanthus 9 giganteuson SOC in improved grassland. After 6 years, using stable carbon isotope ratios (13 C/ 12 C), the amount of Miscanthus derived C (C 4) in total SOC was considerable (ca. 12 %) and positively correlated to belowground biomass of different hybrids. Nevertheless, sig-nificant changes in SOC stocks (0 ? 30 cm) were not detected as C 4 Miscanthuscarbon replaced the initial C 3 grassland carbon; however, initial SOC decreased more in the presence of higher belowground biomass. We ascribed this apparently contradictory result to the rhizosphere priming effect triggered by easily available C sources. Observed changes in SOC partitioning were modelled using the RothC soil carbon turnover model and projected for 20 years showing that there is no significant change in SOC throughout the anticipated life of a Miscanthus crop. We interpret our observations to mean that the new labile C from Miscanthushas replaced the labile C from the grassland and, therefore, planting Miscanthus causes an insignificant change in soil organic car-bon. The overall C mitigation benefit is therefore not decreased by depletion of soil C and is due to substitution of fossil fuel by the aboveground biomass, in this instance 73 ? 108 Mg C ha- 1 for the lowest and highest yielding hybrids, respectively, after 6 years. publishersversionPeer reviewe...|$|R

The model deals with both source separated solid organic waste and liquid organic waste i. e. wastewater. Included are transport for collection, incineration, landfilling, anaerobic digestion, composting, transportation of residuals and spreading on arable land. The model is intended for simulation of handling scenarios for organic waste and calculates emissions to air, water, recirculation to <b>arable</b> land and <b>energy</b> turnover. The flows in the model are described by a variable vector of 43 substances, including e. g. plant nutrients, heavy metals and some organic priority pollutants. The construction of the models for anaerobic digestion, sewage plant, sewage system and spreading of residuals included in ORWARE, are described in detail. The anaerobic digestion model is a continuous, single stage, mixed tank reactor (C. S. T. R.) operating under mesophilic conditions. The gas production {{is related to the}} retention time and the maximum degradation ratio and first order rate constant, for the organic components fat, protein and three classes of carbohydrates respectively. The combustion of the gas in a stationery engine is also included. The sewage plant model includes mechanical, biological and chemical treatment of the wastewater, and anaerobic digestion and dewatering of the sewage sludge. The separation of sludge is based on the suspended solids and water separated in the respectively treatment processes with data primarily from the plant in Uppsala. Separation of the remaining substances included in the vector is principally modelled from assumptions of the substances to be attached to the suspended solids or soluble in water. Sewage systems included are conventional systems and vacuum systems. The model deals with leakage and energy consumption. Alternatives in ORWARE are also urine separation and kitchen disposers for transporting and treating the solid organic waste in a sewage plant.

The present version of the model consists of different submodels for transport, treatment, and disposal of different types of liquid and solid wastes and recycling of materials. Flows between submodels are described by a vector of several substances of different relevance to the system. The model calculates emissions to water and air, amount of residues returned to <b>arable</b> land and <b>energy</b> flows using the tools of life cycle analysis (LCA) and substance flow analysis (SFA). In going in the direction of stringent environmental standards and policies, {{there is a need for}} maximizing energy recovery from waste for both environmental and economic benefits. Sweden has already experience of recovering energy from waste for district heating. Recovering energy not only of high value but also of higher quality from waste would be of interest. Hydrogen is one carrier of such energy. The possibility of using hydrogen from waste as a fuel in the transport sector would contribute in heading for creating a clean environment. In this thesis a new submodel for steam reforming of biogas recovered from an anaerobic digester is developed and used with other submodels within the ORWARE framework. Four scenarios representing alternative ways of energy recovery from the organic waste in Stockholm have been simulated to compare the associated energy turnover and different environmental impacts. Digestion of the organic waste and using the biogas to fuel cars is compared against steam reforming of biogas to hydrogen or thermal gasification of the waste and processing the product gases to hydrogen. In the latter two cases hydrogen produced is used in fuel cell cars. Avoided impacts of using the biogas and hydrogen are analyzed using the fourth scenario where the waste is incinerated to generate heat and electricity. Functional equivalence between scenarios is achieved by external supply of heat, electricity and petrol. While recognizing the uncertainties during modelling and simulation, it is possible to conclude that the results indicate that there is advantage of reduced environmental impact and high energy turnover in introducing the technologies of producing hydrogen from waste into the waste management system. Further and thorough investigation is recommended to come up with a sound and firm conclusion.

40|$|Published in: Origin of Relief of Central Poland and Its Anthropogenic Transformation in Łódź University Geographical Research, edited by. E. Kobojek, T. MarszałThe {{review of}} the localities with biogenic, slope, fluvial and aeolian {{deposits}} in which the indirect impact of human activity on their ori gin is recorded, shows that evidence of changes of the vegetation pat tern and evolution of the relief and geological structure are in Central Poland particularly numerous. The exact correlation of the sites {{is beyond the scope}} of this chapter, due to the strictly local nature of prehistoric anthropopressure and a variety of environmental condi tions. Nevertheless it is possible to draw some general remarks. 1. More significant changes in the relief and geology of Central Poland that occurred under human pressure date back to the Neo holocene (the Early Subboreal Period and Subatlantic Period). More pronounced transformation of the slopes, river valley bottoms and aeolian landforms occurred since the Middle Bronze Age, around 3500 years ago. 2. The punctuated changes, in both vegetation and abiotic com ponents of the environment, were marked at the earliest in the large river valleys (e. g. Warta, Ner, Bzura rivers) and minor valleys within the Warsaw-Berlin pradolina. In higher lying parts of Central Po land, these changes on a similar scale emerged much later, only after ca. 2000 – 2500 years. It was connected with much worse conditions for the settlements in areas of more diversified relief configuration, with poorer soils and limited access to water. 3. The transformation of the vegetation, relief and geological structure took place gradually, along with the expansion of prehis toric settlement of the Trzciniec Culture, the Lusatian Culture and the Przeworsk Culture, whereas in the historical period – along with Early Medieval settlement. Less important for these changes were the impact of people of the Neolithic cultures, and short-stay of peo ple of the Pomeranian Culture in the Central Poland area. 4. The studied transformations were driven by both natural factors, particularly climate, which has changed during the Holo cene repeatedly (but on a relatively moderate scale), and by anthro pogenic factors, the importance of which was growing rapidly in the expansion phases of prehistoric cultures. These influences are rela tively easy to distinguish in the palynological profiles by a well-de fined group of plants accompanying the settlement and economy, whereas their distinguishing in the relief and geology transforma tions is much more difficult. However, it should be stressed that the development of the slopes and aeolian geosystems, and superim posing increased fluvial activity, in many cases were synchronous. This synchronous response, noting at the same time in different sed imentary environments, rather indicates the dominance of anthro pogenic factor, because the humid climate, favourable to stimulate fluvial and slope processes is less favourable for the simultaneous development of aeolian relief. Favourable natural conditions un doubtedly facilitated breaking the balance of the geosystem and the initiation of processes and their more efficient course under anthro pogenic changes of the environment. 5. The trends of the Neoholocene relief transformations were very different. Both processes, leading to local increases of relief and diversified terrain morphology (e. g. gully erosion, so-called wheel erosion, formation of agricultural terraces, accumulation of series overlaying of Late Glacial dunes) and the processes of op posite trends (e. g. aggradation of valley bottoms, tillage erosion, dismant ling of old dunes). Most Neoholocene morphogenetic pro cesses resulted in the increased lithological differentiation, soil for mation and increasing geodiversity of the environment. 6. A number of processes that affected the nature of the vegeta tion, relief and geology was a targeted, intentional and direct inter ference (e. g. land clearance in order to obtain <b>arable</b> fields, <b>energy</b> raw materials and building materials, construction of embankments in river valleys, exploitation of till, sand and other aggregates). How ever, most of the changes should be regarded as unintended and negative, so to speak, a side effect of centuries of settlement and economy. There may be mentioned here: planation of slopes used for agriculture, gully erosion, wheel erosion, the spread of poor aeo lian areas or the increase in the frequency and scale of floods in the Central Poland rivers as a result of an accelerated water circulation on the vegetation-free slopes. 7. Obviously, the Holocene morphogenetic cycle occurred in the past (and is still occurring) under human impact, which proves the J. Dylik’s thesis quoted in the Introduction. This cycle, superim posed on the periglacial morphogenesis, partially obliterates its ef fects and partially only modifies them. Taking into account the short duration of the Holocene cycle, it is characterised by a large dynam ics of the processes being accelerated and intensified by man...|$|R
40|$|Since land is {{a finite}} resource, the {{competition}} for land among different uses has become a real problem. Competition for land takes place when different alternative uses (such as agriculture, forestry, energy or/and natural conservation) are competing for the same piece of land. When {{the competition for}} land is highly intense in a given territory, a specific land use/cover might cause the displacement of another one, leading to land-use conversion and, potential negative environmental, economic and social impacts. In the long term, this exacerbated competition might increase {{the pressure on the}} land and the impacts on the land capacity to support ecosystems and productive systems. Methodologies and tools to assess the potential impacts of bioenergy development in the EU on land uses and functions provide useful insight to shed light on the environmental impacts of energy policies. The territorial assessment carried out by the Land Use-based Sustainability Assessment (LUISA) modelling platform highlights where in Europe the current macro-economic trends and energy policy targets might pose a threat to our land resources in the mid to long term. This might happen, for instance, in regions where the demand for energy crops and the need for residential and industry/commerce/services functions, is forecasted to increase. Essential land uses, such as agriculture for food and feed production, could therefore be transferred to less suitable lands at a regional or local scale. The herein report explores in detail the land uses that are expected to be in direct competition for land (food, feed and energy) {{as a result of the}} EU bioenergy targets and considering the suitability characteristics of the land for these uses. The analysis is carried out per main crop group (cereals, maize, root crops, other <b>arable</b> crops and <b>energy</b> crops), as simulated by the LUISA modelling platform. The results presented highlight where and how the displacement of food and feed crops from highly suitable land to lower levels of suitability can be caused by different drivers, among which the expansion of built-up areas and dedicated energy crops. In summary, the majority of cereal, maize and root crops in Europe are allocated on land classified as highly suitable (according to local biophysical conditions, possible fertiliser input and current cropping patterns) between 2020 and 2050. However, the amount of land cultivated with food crops (cereal, maize and root crop production) is shown to experience a substantial decrease in the majority of the MSs, on average higher than 10 % across the entire simulation period. On the opposite, energy crop production increases at fast pace, at times doubling the amount of allocated land from the year 2020, when they first appears in the modelling, to 2050. Due to the growth of residential and ICS (industry, commercial and services) sites, land highly suitable for the cultivation of food crops and non-food crops is increasingly being used for artificial uses. In general terms, growing crops on highly suitable land results in a cost reduction associated to inputs use, such as fertilizers, pesticides and water. However, as result of the competition, there is – in several areas in Europa - an increasing shift towards low quality land for growing food and feed crops, with environmental and economic impacts to be carefully evaluated.

40|$|This thesis looks {{directly}} into the controversial subject of the microwave field effect by {{the production of a}} versatile prototype isothermal microwave reactor for the investigation of enzymatic and microbiological reactions. The observed results from the prototype reactor and experiments conducted conclude that there is a nonthermal, nonlinear response between the exposure microwave power and rate and yield of cellulose saccharification. The nature of the nonthermal response is controversial and may be dependent on the definition of "nonthermal,' leading to ambiguity of exact mechanism. Enzymatic and microbial conversion of cellulosic material to ethanol is a highly desirable industrial process. Whether the demand is for the mitigation of climate change, political obligations or energy independence, the use of <b>arable</b> land for <b>energy</b> crops limits the available glucose carbon sources for conversion to bioproducts. To prevent this limitation, cellulose (~-l, 4 -linked glucose polymers) are touted as the "silver bullet" to prevent carbon exhaustion or impinging on food crops. The technical constraint for the industrialization of cellulose based processing is the rate limitation in the cellulase enzymatic action on cellulose. The enzyme rate is limited by feedback cycles and limited mechanical freedom, therefore a relatively high enzyme concentration is required to speed up the process. To date, the associated enzyme production costs and infrastructure prevents bulk volume exploitation. Biomolecular advances (amino acid substitutions, recombination of expression vectors etc) have gone some way to increase either enzymatic rate or enzyme concentration. The work presented in this thesis differs by increasing the rate of the enzyme without molecular modification. Using a microwave field, the work presented shows that by separating the system into its base units, irradiation of the enzyme/substrate complex in an aqueous environment can increase both the initial enzyme rate and the saccharification yield without alteration of the temperature set point. This study shows that the rate increase is not proportional to the microwave field power. An optimal power in each study is either found or suggested. The results cited show that in the three systems (Endoglucanase and cellobiohydrolase with cellulose, endoglucanase and cellobiohydrolase and ~- glucosidase with cellulose, and ~-glucosidase with cellobiose) the initial rates can be increased by 201 %, 65. 5 % and 69 % respectively. In the total hydrolytic process (endoglucanase and cellobiohydrolase and ~-glucosidase on a cellulose substrate) the final glucose yield was increased by 43 % in comparison to the conventional thermal control reaction. This is shown in Figure 1. 10. 000 1 9. 000 1 8. 000 j 7. 000 6. 000 o 20 40 60 80 100 120 140 160 180 I I 1 I U 5. 000 r:: o u 4. 000 3. 000 2. 000 j i t t, f 1. 000 0. 000 Time (hours) =->=OOOW Glucose' ? 012 W Glucose ?p 025 W Glucose ~ 050 W Glucose ? 075 W Glucose Figure 1.

40|$|SUMMARY A large {{increase}} in agricultural production {{is needed to}} feed the increasing world population with their increasing demand per capita. However, growing competition for <b>arable</b> land, water, <b>energy,</b> and the {{degradation of the environment}} impose challenges to improve crop production. Hence agricultural production efficiency needs to increase. Greenhouses provide the possibility to create optimal growth conditions for crops, thereby improving production and product quality. Light is the driving force for plant photosynthesis and in greenhouse horticulture, light is often the most limiting factor for plant growth. Therefore, improving radiation use efficiency (RUE) in greenhouse production systems is imperative in order to improve plant growth and production. The objective of this thesis is to obtain insight in improving RUE in greenhouse production systems through better understanding of crop physiology. Three aspects related to RUE have been studied in this thesis, 1) improving light distribution in the crop canopy; 2) allowing more light in the greenhouse during summer; and 3) balancing the source and sink strength during plant growth. Light is heterogeneously distributed in the crop canopy. Due to the saturating response of leaf photosynthesis rate to light, a more homogeneous light distribution in the canopy will result in a higher crop photosynthesis. In Chapter 2, the effect of diffuse glass on spatial light distribution in a fully developed tomato canopy and its direct and indirect effects on crop photosynthesis were explored. Diffuse glass, which transforms a portion of direct solar light into diffuse light without influencing the light transmissivity of the glass, was applied as greenhouse cover. Under diffuse glass cover, light was more evenly distributed (in both horizontal and vertical direction) within the canopy compared with plants grown under conventional clear glass cover. Besides a more uniform light distribution, diffuse glass also resulted in higher leaf photosynthetic capacity {{in the middle of the}} crop canopy and in a higher leaf area index (LAI). The higher leaf photosynthetic capacity was positively correlated with a higher leaf total nitrogen and chlorophyll content. Moreover, lower leaf temperature and less photo-inhibition of top canopy leaves were observed under diffuse glass cover when global radiation was high. Total crop photosynthesis between 1 st April and 1 st October was enhanced by 7. 2 % under diffuse glass. This enhancement mainly resulted from four factors (in order of decreasing importance) : a more homogeneous horizontal light distribution, a higher leaf photosynthetic capacity, a more uniform vertical light distribution and a higher LAI. In summer growers of shade tolerant pot-plants often apply shading screens in the greenhouse or white wash on the greenhouse cover in order to avoid leaf or flower damage caused by high light. Shading carries a penalty on potential crop growth which is positively related to the amount of light that can be captured. Considering the advantageous properties of diffuse glass cover, i. e. a more homogeneous light distribution, a lower leaf temperature and less photo-inhibition when global radiation is high, in Chapter 3 we tested the feasibility of allowing more light (i. e. less shading) via diffuse glass cover for cultivation of shade tolerant pot-plants during summer. Two Anthurium andreanum cultivars (Pink Champion and Royal Champion) were grown in 3 greenhouse compartments. Under similar DLI [7. 5 mol m- 2 d- 1 PAR (photosynthetic active radiation) ], diffuse glass cover resulted in 8 % higher crop RUE (i. e. dry mass production per unit intercepted light) in ‘Royal Champion’ compared with clear glass cover treatment, which consequently resulted in higher total biomass production. This effect was not observed in ‘Pink Champion’. Under diffuse glass cover, high DLI (10 mol m- 2 d- 1 PAR) resulted in 20 - 23 % higher total biomass production in both cultivars compared with low DLI (7. 5 mol m- 2 d- 1 PAR), this mainly resulted from the higher cumulative intercepted light. No flower or leaf damage was observed in these treatments. High DLI even resulted in more compact plants as indicated by a higher ratio of aboveground fresh mass to plant height. In Chapter 4, we addressed a question resulting from Chapter 3, i. e. why the stimulating effect of diffuse light on crop RUE in anthurium pot-plants is cultivar specific? We excluded the fraction of canopy light interception and steady-state leaf photosynthesis as potential explanations, and explained it from instantaneous leaf photosynthesis which closely correlates with the temporal light distribution. Diffuse glass cover smoothed the variation of temporal light distribution at a given point on a leaf during a clear day, which consequently resulted in less temporal variation of stomatal conductance in ‘Royal Champion’ which had stomata showing a fast-response to the variation in light intensity. As stomata are the gateway for CO 2 uptake, less variation in stomatal conductance imposed less limitation for leaf photosynthesis under diffuse glass cover, thereby resulting in a higher crop RUE. For ‘Pink Champion’, however, stomata were less responding to variations in light intensity. Therefore, stomata imposed only a marginal limitation on leaf photosynthesis even under clear glass cover where the temporal incident light intensity varied substantially due to the shadow cast by the greenhouse construction parts and equipment. Application of supplementary assimilation light in greenhouses is rapidly increasing. The beneficial effect of supplementary assimilation light is determined by the balance between assimilate production in source leaves and the overall capacity of the plant to use these assimilates. Therefore, it is important to identify the source-sink balance during plant growth. In Chapter 5, three tomato cultivars with different potential fruit size [‘Komeett’ (large size); ‘Capricia’ (medium size); ‘Sunstream’ (small size, cherry tomato) ] were grown under commercial crop management. We estimated the source-sink ratio from the early growth stage to fully fruiting stage through experimentation and model simulation. Carbohydrate content of leaves and stems were periodically determined. Tomato plants showed a period of sink limitation (‘Komeett’ and ‘Capricia’) or came close to sink limitation (‘Sunstream’) during the early growth stage under ample natural irradiance (early September) as indicated by a source-sink ratio higher than or close to 1. Fruiting tomato plants were source-limited as indicated by an extremely low source-sink ratio (average source-sink ratio from 50 days after planting onwards was 0. 17, 0. 22 and 0. 33 for ‘Komeett’, ‘Capricia’ and ‘Sunstream’, respectively). During the fully fruiting stage, the source-sink ratio was negatively correlated with the potential fruit size when commercial fruit load was maintained. Carbohydrate content in tomato stems and leaves increased linearly with plant source-sink ratio. The experiments and results described in this thesis provide insights for improving RUE in greenhouse production systems. The main achievements and limitations as well as practical applications are discussed in Chapter 6.  ...|$|R
40|$|The {{increases}} in price for conventional energy fuel, growing import of energy {{as well as}} the climate change issue have caused a high interest in the renewable energy sources in the European Union. In the last decade there were several papers established which promote and set the objectives for future share of renewables in energy sector. In doubling the use of renewables the biomass energy is expected to play a leading role. This {{is due to the fact}} that the biomass converted into energy does not add to global warming because plants use and store CO 2 as they grow. What is more, biomass can be used for electricity production, but also for transportation, heat and as a feedstock for the chemical industry. According to many studies, the significant biomass potential is being recognized in the region of the Baltic countries. At the same time the rate at which the biomass is implemented is different for each country in the EU. This is mainly connected with the strength of financial measures and incentives for the biomass utilization on the national level, domestic availability of other fuels and their price. It is also observed that even though the region of Baltic countries owns the highest biomass potential, it does not use a considerable part of its biomass resources. Consequently, the potential is being wasted. At the same time in the Netherlands, there is a high interest in switching from the currently used natural gas into biomass (the goal of 30 % of all raw materials to be bio-based up to the year 2030). The problem the country is facing is the shortages of biomass domestic supply. Nevertheless, the Netherlands has already started some projects on the regional level because it hopes it will import biomass from the countries in the Baltic region. The purpose of this study was therefore to investigate whether the biomass potential in the Baltic Sea Region countries will be high enough to become available as an export resource within the next 25 - 30 years. Special attention was given to the refined wood fuel like pellets or briquettes because as acknowledged during the research both represent the best type of biomass for export due to its low moisture content and consequently high energetic value. Also, the possibility to use a part of arable land in the Baltic region countries for energy crops cultivation was analyzed under three different routes of development in energy sector in Europe. It was concluded that the highest amount of biomass available potential or simply supply is currently available in Poland and Finland. In the case of the former this is due to by-products of agriculture and for the latter it is owing to the by-products from forestry. It was also established that both countries are a net exporters of refined wood fuels in the form of pellets. Moreover Finland is already exporting pellets to the Netherlands. An other observation was made that there is a lot of doubt about the increase in the pellet production in Poland in the coming future due to the warm winter of 2007 and significant amount of pellets being left in the stock. This brought the conclusion about the importance of the demand when the future possibility of biomass fuel trade is being studied. The solution to the paradoxical situation in which the Netherlands would like to import pellets, whereas Poland is “stuck” with the unsold product was that the Netherlands should try to make an agreement with Poland for a long time period trade at constant price. The timing was recognized as an important issue as the biomass demand is predicted to increase significantly in the future and thus it may become not available and expensive. Consequently, as concluded the agreement could guarantee the security of price and stability of delivery. In the second step of the research the author elaborated the effects of the different development routes in the energy sector in the EU on the formation of incentives for energy crops cultivation in Baltic region countries. The three development routes considered for the energy sector were first the accelerated use of renewables, second the accelerated increase in nuclear power and the third so called business-as-usual scenario. There were also assumptions made for the future demand for biomass for each scenario approach. Except for the fallow land in Baltic countries, the land theoretically available for energy crop cultivation was assumed to appear due to technological improvement that increase the crop yield and decrease the required land for agricultural purposes. It was concluded that the condition to create a situation in which it will be worth for countries of Baltic region to grow energy crops is only when there is a link made between the policies in energy and agricultural sectors. While the EU promotes the increase in renewable energy sources and consequently biomass use the agricultural sector is driven by the market conditions. If both policies concentrated on the common goal of the biomass promotion and deliver good incentives and fiscal measures then the energy crops would be profitable to grow on arable land. Only in this situation the use of <b>arable</b> land for <b>energy</b> crops may “win” with the alternative uses of land like urbanization or devoting land for nature conservation as it is promoted by several EU directives. It was noted that in the case of scenario in which there is an accelerated use of nuclear power in the European energy sector there will be no incentive to promote energy crops. On the other hand, although for the scenario with the accelerated renewable energy sources there is an incentive to cultivate energy crops there is a risk that the price for it may be very high in the light of rapid rise in the demand in BSR countries and in the whole Europe, which may effect the attractiviness for import of biomass by the Netherlands. Therefore, during the research there was not one fine conclusion made on how the Netherlands should proceed to reach their biomass goal. It was concluded that as in the case of pellets it is recommended to make the agreements as soon as possible, the situation is much more complicated for the use of arable land. It is mainly due to the arable land use competition which is limited and the fact that it is not possible to predict the future when it comes to issues like energy or technological development. Consequently, in the case of arable land use for the energy crops cultivation there are many aspects in when the Netherlands has no influence and it is impossible to give an unconditional advice on how to proceed. In the large part the chances to import from the Baltic region will depend on future policies in energy at the EU level and agricultural policy on the national levels. Last but not least, due to the fact that Poland has the highest arable land share out of the countries studied it was concluded that it is highly probable it will be a leader in the energy crops cultivation in the case of scenario with accelerated use of renewable energy and in the case of business-as-usual scenario. ...|$|R
