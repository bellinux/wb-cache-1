The Régie also has extended powers, including <b>approval</b> <b>authority</b> over every transmission {{and distribution}}-related capital expenditure project exceeding C$10 million; approval {{of the terms of}} service and of long-term supply contracts; dealing with customer complaints; and the setting and enforcement of safety and reliability standards for the electric grid.|$|E
25|$|GAO {{was created}} {{out of the}} office of the Comptroller of the Treasury, and McCarl {{inherited}} most of that office's 1,700 workers. He largely retained the Treasury structure, although he concentrated <b>approval</b> <b>authority</b> for communication with Congress in his own office. He also created a legal office, and ordered that any interpretation of law issue only under his own signature. In 1922, he established a Bookkeeping Section to sign off on all government contractual expenditures, a Transportation Division to ensure that shipping costs were reasonable, and an Investigations Section to make investigations and inspections, write reports, and make recommendations regarding the operation and financial procedures of the federal government. This unit (later renamed the Office of Investigations in the late 1920s) quickly became the major arm of GAO.|$|E
40|$|Building {{regulations}} {{are in a}} state of transition, from a traditionally prescnpnve approach, to performance based regulations Fire regulations for buildings are still predominantly prescriptively applied but there is an international move to performance based design and regulation. The use of performance regulations will mean that the regulatory authorities will need to come to terms with a new way of assessing the suitability of proposals for approval. As a result of research involving a literature review and interviews with <b>approval</b> <b>authorities</b> in Australia and internationally, issues relating to the use of fire engineering, performance based regulations and computer models are raised and explored Implications for the <b>approval</b> <b>authorities</b> include the need for appropriate expertise of the <b>approval</b> <b>authorities,</b> lack of data, performance levels and verification methods, providing faster and cheaper approvals, science setting the level of fire safety and litigation. One of the principle objectives in undertaking research into fire is to improve the fire safety provisions in building regulations There are problems in relation to the transition of fire research outcomes into the building regulation...|$|R

25|$|According to Chief Smith, the Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act of 1975 overrode the 1970 Principal Chiefs Act, and the Cherokee Nation had the {{sovereign}} right {{to determine its}} citizenship requirements. Smith stated that the Cherokee Nation Supreme Court ruled that the Cherokee Nation could take away the <b>approval</b> <b>authority</b> it had granted {{the federal government and}} that the Nation will abide by the court's decision. Despite the ruling, the issue of amending the process of federal approval was placed on the ballot for the June 23, 2007 general election. Cherokee voters approved the amendment to remove federal oversight by a 2–1 margin, but the BIA still has to approve. Jeanette Hanna, director of the BIA's Eastern Oklahoma Regional Office, said that the regional office has recommended approval of the vote on removal of Secretarial oversight.|$|E
500|$|The {{common thread}} of the {{nineteen}} years of Tigert's administration was doing more with less. [...] Faculty salary cuts were common; Tigert himself never drew his full authorized annual salary of $10,000. [...] Among Tigert's many significant reforms, he decentralized the university budget {{to the level}} of the individual academic colleges, allowing them to set their own spending priorities. [...] The University Council, composed of the president, the registrar and the college deans, retained final <b>approval</b> <b>authority.</b> [...] Tigert also established the faculty senate, the Institute of Inter-American Affairs and the Bureau of Economic and Business Research.|$|E
500|$|Vlastimil Koubek {{passed his}} {{architectural}} exam and established Koubek Architects in 1957. One {{of his first}} commissions to be built was Southern Maryland Medical Center (now Southern Maryland Hospital Center) in Clinton, Maryland. His first major commission in the area was for 1701 Pennsylvania Avenue NW, a 13-story building with a facade of gold-anodized aluminum and white marble. [...] But the United States Commission of Fine Arts, which had design <b>approval</b> <b>authority</b> over all private buildings adjacent to federal buildings in the city, objected to this facade. Koubek submitted a revised design which utilized larger, octagonal window designs of marble with recessed ribs of bronze aluminum, which not only was accepted but highly praised by influential architect Frederick Gutheim as pushing District architectural design [...] "forward 10 years." [...] A similar design was created for the facade of One Farragut Square South, which began construction in November 1960. A more Modernist glass-wall building was planned in October 1961 for 1666 Connecticut Avenue NW (the southwest corner of Connecticut Avenue NW and R Street NW).|$|E

2500|$|The {{regulatory}} scheme for class III gaming {{is more complex}} than a casual reading of the statute might suggest. Although Congress clearly intended regulatory issues to be addressed in Tribal-State compacts, it left a number of key functions in federal hands, including <b>approval</b> <b>authority</b> over compacts, management contracts, and Tribal gaming ordinances. [...] Congress also vested the Commission with broad authority to issue regulations in furtherance of the purposes of the Act. Accordingly, the Commission {{plays a key role in}} the regulation of class II and III gaming.|$|E
2500|$|The Marriott Marquis' {{design was}} {{submitted}} to the National Capital Planning Commission in late 2008. The designs outlined a 14-story, [...] hotel with a glass and steel facade. The facade of the historic 1916 Pipefitters building would {{be incorporated into the}} facade. The design required digging [...] below ground to build 1,000 parking spaces and two levels of usable space to accommodate [...] of ballroom and meeting room space (which had been restored to the project). The plans also called for a tunnel beneath 9th Street NW to link the hotel and the convention center. The commission, which had <b>approval</b> <b>authority</b> over the development, reported favorably on February 4. The same month, WCSA announced the underwriters for its forthcoming $187 million bond issue (of which $134 million would go toward the hotel).|$|E

The Army Corps of Engineers gave their approval in mid-January 1934. By July 1934, the D.C. Commissioners and National Capital Planning Commission (which had approval over all major structures and all roads, bridges, and memorials in the metropolitan area) had given their approval as well, and construction went forward. The new structure had abutments which extended an additional [...] onto the shore {{on either side of the}} bridge, and it was [...] rather than [...] above the water. Protective pilings and walls were also placed around the piers, to prevent fast-moving water from scouring around the piers and causing another collapse.|$|E
50|$|Although all countries' type {{approvals}} {{are legally}} equivalent, {{there are real}} and perceived differences in the rigour with which the regulations and protocols are applied by different national type <b>approval</b> <b>authorities.</b> Some countries have their own national standards for granting type approvals, which may be more stringent than called for by the UN regulations themselves.

2500|$|On May 15, 2007, the Cherokee Nation Tribal Courts {{reinstated}} the Cherokee Freedmen {{as citizens}} while appeals were {{pending in the}} Cherokee Nation Courts and Federal Court. [...] On May 22, 2007, the Cherokee Nation received notice from the United States Bureau of Indian Affairs that the BIA and Federal Government had denied the amendment to the 1975 Cherokee Nation Constitution because it required BIA approval, which had not been obtained. The BIA {{also noted that the}} Cherokee Nation had excluded the Cherokee Freedmen from voting on the amendment. On this issue, the Cherokee Nation Supreme Court ruled that the Cherokee Nation could take away the <b>approval</b> <b>authority</b> which it had previously granted the federal government. Pending the resolution of litigation, the Cherokee Freedman had all rights as full Cherokee Nation citizens, including voting rights and access to tribal services. In early 2011, the tribal district court ruled that the special election in 2007 on the constitutional amendment was unconstitutional, as it excluded Freedmen from voting. [...] The Nation appealed. On August 22, 2011, the Cherokee Supreme Court upheld the results of the 2007 special election.
