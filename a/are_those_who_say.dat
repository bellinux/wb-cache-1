The balladeer allows that “maybe {{it was just}} a dream/maybe just a legend”. In the morning, the last two verses tell us, “the accursed valley was filled with the chirping of birds/and there <b>are</b> <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>say</b> that to this day/along the Yarkon/the birds sing of Yoel Moshe Salomon”.|$|E
500|$|Publication of {{the sequel}} The Lord of the Rings altered many critics' {{reception}} of the work. Instead of approaching The Hobbit as a children's book in its own right, critics such as Randell Helms {{picked up on the}} idea of The Hobbit as being a [...] "prelude", relegating the story to a dry-run for the later work. Countering a presentist interpretation <b>are</b> <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>say</b> this approach misses out on much of the original's value as a children's book and as a work of high fantasy in its own right, and that it disregards the book's influence on these genres. Commentators such as Paul Kocher, John D. Rateliff and C. W. Sullivan encourage readers to treat the works separately, both because The Hobbit was conceived, published, and received independently of the later work, and to avoid dashing readers' expectations of tone and style.|$|E
500|$|Humphrey's {{progress}} with {{civil rights in}} Minneapolis gained national attention, with many cities inquiring about how they could establish their own civil rights commissions. In 1947, he was reelected with 102,000 votes over his opponent's 52,000 votes. As a delegate to the 1948 Democratic National Convention, he led the call for a strong civil rights plank. In his address, he said, [...] "There <b>are</b> <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>say</b> to you– we are rushing this issue of civil rights. I say we are 172 years late. There are those who say– this issue of civil rights is an infringement on states rights. The time has arrived for the Democratic Party {{to get out of}} the shadow of state's rights and walk forthrightly into the bright sunshine of human rights." [...] Humphrey was elected to the United States Senate in the 1948 election and served many years as a prominent Minnesota politician, including Vice President of the U.S. from 1965–1969.|$|E
500|$|Boyd {{believes}} {{that he needs to}} work on his turn of pace and also improve his heading ability, and considers these as his main weaknesses. Former manager Darren Ferguson said [...] "there might <b>be</b> <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>say</b> he lacks a little bit of pace but what he does not have in his legs he has in his head". In his career, Boyd has only ever scored three headed goals, and says that he is much more comfortable with the ball at his feet.|$|R
5000|$|The {{ideas of}} Jesus' {{imminent}} return {{and the final}} messianic triumph coupled with that of it being delayed until an unknown date in the future, or perhaps until after death, have always characterized Christian thought through the ages.

But I {{think it is}} the same from the moral point of view. Is it better to drop an atomic bomb on a city than to kill a handful of persons? I don’t think so. But nobody says that President Truman was a terrorist. All the men we went for individually – Wilkin, Martin, MacMichael and others – were personally interested in succeeding in the fight against us.|$|E
2500|$|... "Throughout the Middle East, {{the fear}} of free choices can no longer justify the denial of liberty. It is time to abandon the excuses that are made to avoid {{the hard work of}} {{democracy}}. There <b>are</b> <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>say</b> that democracy is being imposed. It is tyranny that must be imposed. People choose democracy freely. And successful reform is always homegrown. Just look around the world today. For the first time in history, more people are citizens of democracies than of any other form of government. This is the result of choice, not of coercion. There <b>are</b> <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>say</b> that democracy leads to chaos, or conflict, or terror. In fact, the opposite is true: Freedom and democracy are the only ideas powerful enough to overcome hatred, and division, and violence. For people of diverse races and religions, the inclusive nature of democracy can lift {{the fear of}} difference that some believe is a license to kill. But people of goodwill must choose to embrace the challenge of listening, and debating, and cooperating with one another. For neighboring countries with turbulent histories, democracy can help to build trust and settle old disputes with dignity. But leaders of vision and character must commit themselves to the difficult work that nurtures the hope of peace. And for all citizens with grievances, democracy can be a path to lasting justice. But the democratic system cannot function if certain groups have one foot in the realm of politics and one foot in the camp of terror." ...|$|E

2500|$|Later, Joseph Fielding Smith {{published}} his book Man: His Origin and Destiny, which denounced evolution without qualification. Similar statements of denunciation {{were made by}} Bruce R. McConkie, who as late as 1980 denounced evolution as one of [...] "the seven deadly heresies" [...] (BYU Fireside, June 1, 1980), and stated: [...] "There <b>are</b> <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>say</b> that revealed religion and organic evolution can be harmonized. This is both false and devilish." [...] Evolution was also denounced by the conservative Ezra Taft Benson, who as an Apostle called on members to use the Book of Mormon to combat evolution and several times denounced evolution as a [...] "falsehood" [...] {{on a par with}} socialism, rationalism, and humanism.

2500|$|Today, [...] "yakiniku" [...] {{commonly}} {{refers to}} a Japanese style of cooking bite-size meat (usually beef and offal) and vegetables on gridirons or griddles over a flame of wood charcoals carbonized by dry distillation (sumibi, 炭火) or a gas/electric grill. In North America, China, and Taiwan, yakiniku is {{also referred to as}} [...] "Japanese barbecue" [...] In Japan the origin of yakiniku has become a subject of debate, though it is conventionally considered to have originated from or inspired by Korean cuisine. In 2002 the NHK program NHK Ningen Kouza (NHK人間講座, literally NHK Humanity Lecture) stated that: [...] "While some tend to think that yakiniku came from Korea, it was born in post war Japan." [...] Yet there <b>are</b> <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>say</b> that while yakiniku may have its beginnings in Japan, they believe it was first made by Zainichi Koreans (long-term Korean residents) and should therefore be considered Korean cuisine.|$|E
2500|$|Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu {{immediately}} called a special government meeting after Obama finished his address. Yedioth Ahronoth {{has stated that}} the address' words [...] "resonated through Jerusalem's corridors". On 14 June, Netanyahu gave a speech at Bar-Ilan University in which he endorsed, for the first time, a two-state solution for Israelis and Palestinians; the speech was widely seen {{as a response to}} Obama's speech. In a rejoinder to Obama's mentioning of the founding of Israel {{in the context of the}} Holocaust, Netanyahu remarked, [...] "here <b>are</b> <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>say</b> that if the Holocaust had not occurred, the State of Israel would never have been established. But I say that if the State of Israel would have been established earlier, the Holocaust would not have occurred." [...] Netanyahu stated that he would accept a Palestinian state if Jerusalem were to remain the united capital of Israel, the Palestinians would have no army, and the Palestinians would give up their demand for a right of return. He also stated that existing Jewish settlements in the West Bank will expand while their permanent status is up to further negotiation. The overture was quickly rejected by Palestinian leaders such as Hamas spokesman Sami Abu Zuhri, who called the speech [...] "racist".|$|E

There <b>be</b> <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>say</b> that if a man be anything of a man, he can always insure obedience in his own household.

5000|$|With victory {{a number}} of Communists {{occupied}} prominent positions on the ANC benches in parliament. Most prominently, Nelson Mandela appointed Joe Slovo as Minister for Housing. This period also brought new strains in the ANC-SACP alliance when the ANC's programme did not threaten the existence of capitalism in South Africa and was heavily reliant on foreign investment and tourism. However, the Freedom Charter had been considered only as a blueprint for a future democratic and free South Africa. Joe Slovo recognised that Stalinism had failed in Eastern Europe {{and could not be}} regarded {{as a model for the}} SACP.

2500|$|Rabbi Jacob bar Acha {{taught in}} the name of Rabbi Zorah that the command to Aaron in [...] "at the door of the tent of meeting shall you abide day and night seven days, and keep the charge of the Lord," [...] served as a source for the law of seven days of {{mourning}} for the death of a relative ( [...] , shivah).
