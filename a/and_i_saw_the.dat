500|$|In a 2009 interview, Sevigny {{reflected}} on her career, {{and said she}} was content with the level of stardom she had maintained: [...] "When I was in my early 20s, I went out with a British pop star, Jarvis Cocker; of course, pop stars have much more celebrity, I think, than actors even. They're really hunted by their fans much more. I remember driving around these remote towns in Wales and kids running after us in the street. I was like, 'This is horrible!' <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>the</b> effect it had on him, and that's when I decided I never wanted to be a celebrity at that level, and I think that's why I've chosen to do the work that I do and just kind of work with directors that I love and try and do work that means something to me." ...|$|E
500|$|The D-Day {{scenes were}} shot in Ballinesker Beach, Curracloe Strand, Ballinesker, {{just east of}} Curracloe, County Wexford, Ireland. Hanks {{recalled}} to Roger Ebert that although {{he realized it was}} a movie, the experience still hit him hard, stating, [...] "The first day of shooting the D-Day sequences, I was {{in the back of the}} landing craft, and that ramp went down <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>the</b> first 1-2-3-4 rows of guys just getting blown to bits. In my head, of course, I knew it was special effects, but I still wasn't prepared for how tactile it was." [...] Filming began June 27, 1997, and lasted for two months. Some shooting was done in Normandy, for the Normandy American Cemetery and Memorial in Colleville-sur-Mer and Calvados. Other scenes were filmed in England, such as a former British Aerospace factory in Hatfield, Hertfordshire, Thame Park, Oxfordshire and Wiltshire. Production was due to also take place in Seaham, County Durham, but government restrictions disallowed this.|$|E
500|$|The song's {{lyrics are}} about the {{breakdown}} of a relationship between Beyoncé and her lover, a situation that suits both of them. They also touch on revenge and karma, particularly the opening line, [...] "What goes around comes back around", the lines [...] "Best thing I never had", [...] "Best thing you never had", and the closing line, [...] "Sucks to be you right now". Happy to have avoided heartbreak, Beyoncé continues to sing about her ex-lover, who did not recognize {{the possibility of a}} happy relationship with Beyoncé until the relationship broke down. Beyoncé no longer desires her lover after discovering his deceit; as shown in the pre-chorus and chorus lines, [...] "When I think of the time that I almost loved you / You showed your ass <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>the</b> real you / Thank God you blew it, I thank God I dodged a bullet / I’m so over you, so baby good looking out / I wanted you bad / I’m so through with that / Because honestly / You {{turned out to be the}} best thing I never had / And will always be the best thing you never had." ...|$|E

It was headed toward the school, which panicked me, because all three of my kids were there. Then you heard the explosion and felt the blast and saw the fire and smoke." [...] Another witness, Eric Peterson, looked up when he heard the plane, [...] "It was low enough, I thought you could probably count the rivets. You could see more of the roof of the plane than you could the belly. It was on its side. There was a great explosion and you could see the flames. It was a massive, massive explosion. Flames and then smoke and then a massive, massive mushroom cloud." [...] Val McClatchey had been watching footage of the attacks when she heard the plane. She saw it briefly, then heard the impact. The crash knocked out the electricity and phones. McClatchey grabbed her camera and took the only known picture of the smoke cloud from the explosion. Ten years after 9/11, a video of the rising smoke cloud filmed by Dave Berkebile (deceased by 2011) from his yard located eight miles away from the crash site was published on YouTube.|$|E
500|$|When Principal Skinner {{tells the}} {{children}} at school that Valentine's Day is not a joke (due to Bart fabricating candy hearts with mean insults), he has a flashback {{in which he is}} sitting in a PBR somewhere in Da Nang in 1969. On an oil drum next to him is a manila envelope and a photograph of Colonel Kurtz. Skinner sees Johnny, one of his army friends, holding a Valentine card and asks him, [...] "Sending your chick a Valentine?", to which Johnny replies [...] "Yep", right before he is shot to death. Cutting back to the present, Skinner repeatedly calls out Johnny's name in anguish, to which a perplexed Bart states [...] "Cool! I broke his brain." [...] After the episode aired, a Vietnam veteran sent {{in a letter to the}} show that read, [...] "I was watching the Valentine's Day episode of your cartoon <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>the</b> horrifying Vietnam flashback. Do you really think this was funny, this horrible experience?" [...] The staff ignored the letter and, as Wes Archer pointed out, the scene was [...] "an obvious" [...] reference to Apocalypse Now even featuring characters that resembled Chef (Frederic Forrest) and Mr. Clean (Laurence Fishburne). In contrast, Mark Groening—the brother of Matt Groening and himself a Vietnam veteran—"loved" [...] the sequence as well as the episode.|$|E
500|$|Gloria Stuart as Rose Dawson Calvert: Rose narrates {{the film}} in a modern-day framing device. Cameron stated, [...] "In order to see {{the present and the}} past, I decided to create a fictional {{survivor}} who is [...] 101 years, and she connects us in a way through history." [...] The 100-year-old Rose gives Lovett information regarding the [...] "Heart of the Ocean" [...] after he discovers a nude drawing of her in the wreck. She tells the story of her time aboard the ship, mentioning Jack {{for the first time since}} the sinking. At 87, Stuart had to be made up to look older for the role. Of casting Stuart, Cameron stated, [...] "My casting director found her. She was sent out on a mission to find retired actresses from the Golden Age of the thirties and forties." [...] Cameron said that he did not know who Stuart was, and Fay Wray was also considered for the role. [...] "But [...] was just so into it, and so lucid, and had such a great spirit. <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>the</b> connection between her spirit and [...] spirit," [...] stated Cameron. [...] "I saw this joie de vivre in both of them, that I thought the audience would be able to make that cognitive leap that it's the same person." [...] Stuart died on September 26, 2010, at age 100, approximately the same age elder Rose was in the film.|$|E

500|$|The {{band was}} {{still searching for}} a lead singer. Chimes recalls one Billy Watts (who [...] "seemed to be, like, {{nineteen}} or eighteen then, as we all were") handling the duties for a time. Rhodes had his eye on Strummer, with whom he made exploratory contact. Jones and Levene had both seen him perform and were impressed as well. Strummer, for his part, was primed to make the switch. In April, he had taken in the opening act {{for one of his}} band's gigs—the Sex Pistols. Strummer later explained:I knew something was up, so I went out in the crowd which was fairly sparse. <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>the</b> future—with a snotty handkerchief—right in front of me. It was immediately clear. Pub rock was, [...] "Hello, you bunch of drunks, I'm gonna play these boogies and I hope you like them." [...] The Pistols came out that Tuesday evening and their attitude was, [...] "Here's our tunes, and we couldn't give a flying fuck whether you like them or not. In fact, we're gonna play them even if you fucking hate them."On 30 May, Rhodes and Levene met surreptitiously with Strummer after a 101'ers gig. Strummer was invited to meet up at the band's rehearsal location on Davis Road. After Strummer turned up, Levene grabbed his guitar, stood several inches away from Strummer, {{looked him in the eye}} and then began playing [...] "Keys to Your Heart", one of Strummer's own tunes.|$|E
500|$|... "Best Thing I Never Had" [...] {{received}} moderately positive {{reviews from}} music critics. [...] Gerrick D. Kennedy of the Los Angeles Times noted similarities between [...] "Best Thing I Never Had" [...] and [...] Beyoncé's previous singles including [...] "Irreplaceable" [...] and [...] "If I Were a Boy", [...] {{and concluded that}} Beyoncé [...] "certainly knows how to dump a man in style". Matthew Perpetua of Rolling Stone wrote that [...] "Best Thing I Never Had" [...] could be [...] "Irreplaceable Part Two" [...] and noted that Beyoncé's vocal performance brings depth to the song. Rich Juzwiak of The Village Voice wrote that the song is not as iconic as its reference point [...] "Irreplaceable", but [...] "nor is it as shady". He commended the optimism in the song's lyrics. Consequence of Sound writer Chris Coplan commented that the ballad is a powerful moment of self-realization, which is enhanced by Beyoncé's vocal performance [...] "as [...] wounded bird turned resilient lioness". Choosing [...] "Best Thing I Never Had" [...] as the highlight of 4, Andy Kellman of Allmusic described it as [...] "a bombastic kiss-off saved by Beyoncé's ability to plow through it". Kyle Anderson of Entertainment Weekly noted the moderate chart performance of [...] "Run the World (Girls)", and wrote: [...] "Best Thing I Never Had" [...] finds Beyoncé mining {{the same kind of}} girl-power imagery as she did on 'Run the World (Girls)'. But there is something more direct and honest about the lyrics on the new single (perhaps it's the instant greatness of the line, 'When I think of the time I almost loved you / You showed your ass <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>the</b> real you'). 'Best Thing I Never Had' feels like the kind of crossover hit that will help 4 join the rest of Beyoncé's discography in multiplatinum land.|$|E

So she told my friend Dennis, who always gets me good music anyway, and he got that for me. So that was one of my first albums that I loved." [...] She would later tell MTV News: [...] "I kind of clicked into soul music more than anything else because of the vocals. You've got to have good vocals to sing soul music and I always liked it ever since I was little." ...|$|E
2500|$|Reserve sophomore {{running back}} Mikell Simpson racked up 119 yards rushing and two TDs {{to go along}} with 152 {{receiving}} yards, for 271 all-purpose yards, as 19th-ranked Virginia came from behind to defeat Maryland. The game ended when, with 16 seconds left, Simpson dived into the endzone as the ball was knocked out of his hands. It was ruled a touchdown and Virginia defeated Maryland. Terps coach Ralph Friedgen said [...] "I saw the ball come out on the goal line. I saw it and I don't think he had possession." [...] Simpson himself stated, [...] "It crossed the line.
