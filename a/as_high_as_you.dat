He summarised his visit by saying that [...] "If {{you are interested in}} the pursuit of excellence, then a table at the Oak Room is <b>as</b> <b>high</b> <b>as</b> <b>you</b> can go in this country, and close to <b>as</b> <b>high</b> <b>as</b> <b>you</b> can go in the world." [...] He recommended the starters of red mullet soup, the ballotine of salmon, and the chicken oyster served with a celeriac remoulade. He called his main course [...] "utterly simple and completely perfect"; it consisted of roast partridge with choucroute garnie. He called the interior of the dining room [...] "soft and thick and luxurious", adding that a painting by Mark Gertler and three bronzes by Rembrandt Bugatti were [...] "worth the entrance fee alone".|$|E

2500|$|During Guizot’s {{tenure as}} foreign minister, he and Lord Aberdeen, the foreign {{secretary}} to Sir Robert Peel, carried on well, and thus they secured France and Britain in the entente cordiale. Part {{of the formation}} of the entente came about when Guizot secured the transfer of Napoleon’s ashes from St. Helena to the French government. The opposition in France denounced Guizot's foreign policy as basely subservient to England. He replied in terms of unmeasured contempt: [...] "You may raise the pile of calumny <b>as</b> <b>high</b> <b>as</b> <b>you</b> will; vous n'arriverez jamais a la hauteur de mon dédain!"

[...] He wrote the story in response, and citing the potential backlash from rewriting Shakespeare, he says, [...] "If you think it's blasphemous to fiddle with Shakespeare's work, then for heaven's sake don't read this story. I leave his version in shreds on the floor. But my body count is just <b>as</b> <b>high,</b> <b>as</b> long <b>as</b> <b>you</b> don't expect me to account for Rosencrantz and Guildenstern.

30|$|My {{marriage}} {{was not able}} to be blessed with children, though we had every resources. My husband died after four years of marriage. Forty days later after his death, the PA officials confiscated my land, without my awareness. When I realized that my land was appropriated, I requested the community leaders. They said that you do not have children and you are getting older and no possibility to remarry another man, the probability to leave this place is <b>high</b> <b>as</b> long <b>as</b> <b>you</b> have nothing to stay. Thus, since the law favors men over women, I {{was not able to}} go to the court.|$|R

"Then I'll {{tell you}} why they were taken first: because the mist, when we came through it, only rose five or six feet above the stream, {{and we were in}} it, while you on board were above it. And those that were taken on board this morning, every one of them, slept on the main-deck, and every one of them, too, was in fear of the fever, whereby I judge two things,--Keep <b>as</b> <b>high</b> <b>as</b> <b>you</b> can, and fear nothing but God, and we're all safe yet." ...|$|E

40|$|Asscrack  Bandit  leads  the  player  through  a  city  that  is  being  invaded  by  demonic  entities.   The player  acts  as  the  Bandit  who  before  the  invasion  had  decided  to  toss  coins  at  people�s  exposed asscracks  out  of  annoyance.   Over  the  course  of  the  game  the  Bandit  wanders  through different  areas  of  the  city  in  search  of  answers  as  to  what  is  happening  and  why.   All  of  the  while the  Bandit  practices  their  coin  shooting  skills  on  frightened  bystanders�  asscracks  and  uses  coins to  fight  off  the  enemies  they  encounter. The {{game is a}} maze style turn-based {{game that}} is set up on a grid system and {{requires}} some strategy to avoid excessively fighting enemies. Fighting enemies consists of something similar to a mini game. The goal is to achieve <b>as</b> <b>high</b> a score <b>as</b> <b>you</b> can, losing to an enemy in the Battle Room results in your score being reset. The game uses the arrow keys {{to move through the}} levels. It also uses the space bar to charge for attacks and the B button to attack. To {{move on to the next}} level the player must �collect� all of the station targets (people with their asses exposed) and then reach the checkered flag in each level. ...|$|R
6000|$|Climbing.--Climbing trees.--Colonel Jackson, in his book, 'How to Observe,' {{gives the}} {{following}} directions for climbing palms and other trees that have very rough barks:--"Take {{a strip of}} linen, or two towels or strong handkerchiefs tied together, and form a loop at each end, for the feet to pass tightly into without going through; or, for want of such material, make a rope of grass or straw in the same way. The length should embrace {{a little more than}} half of the diameter of the trunk to be climbed. Now, being at the foot of the tree, fix the feet well into the loops, and opening the legs a little, embrace the tree <b>as</b> <b>high</b> up <b>as</b> <b>you</b> can. Raise your legs, and pressing the cord against the tree with your feet, stand, as it were, in your stirrups, and raise your body and arms higher; hold fast again by the arms, open the legs, and raise them a stage higher, and so on to the top. The descent is effected in the same way, reversing, of course, the order of the movements. The ruggedness of the bark, and the weight of the body pressing diagonally across the trunk of the tree, prevent the rope from slipping. Anything, provided it be strong enough, is better than a round rope, which does not hold so fast." [...] A loop or hoop embracing the body of the climber and the tree, is a helpful addition. Large nails carried in a bag slung round the waist, to be driven into the bare trunk of the tree, will facilitate its ascent. Gimlets may be used for the same purpose. High walls can be climbed by help of this description; a weight attached to one end of a rope, being first thrown over the wall, and the climber assisting himself by holding on to the other end. Trees of soft wood are climbed by cutting notches two feet apart on alternate sides. Also by driving in bamboo pegs, sloping alternately to left or to right; these pegs correspond to the [...] "rungs" [...] of a ladder.|$|R
60|$|That is the can-can.

There is no word of exaggeration in this. Any of the staid, respectable, aged people who were there that night can testify to the truth of that statement. There were a good many such people present. I suppose French morality is not of that straight-laced description which is shocked at trifles.|$|E

Have the entrance-story low-studded, and your parlours on the next floor <b>as</b> <b>high</b> <b>as</b> <b>you</b> please.

60|$|At a {{distance}} from London (say as small {{a distance}}, in time if not space, <b>as</b> Bath), <b>you</b> will hear it said that everybody is well in London, but in London {{you will find that}} the hygienic critics or authorities distinguish. All England, indeed, is divided into parts that are relaxing, and parts that are bracing, and it is not so strange then that London should be likewise subdivided. Mayfair, you will hear, is very bracing, but Belgravia, and more particularly Pimlico, on which it borders, is terribly relaxing. Beyond Pimlico, Chelsea again is bracing, and as for South Kensington {{it stands to reason that}} it is bracing because it is very <b>high,</b> almost <b>as</b> <b>high</b> <b>as</b> Mayfair. If <b>you</b> pass from your Pimlico borderland of Belgravia to either of those regions you are certainly not sensible of any sharp accent, but there is no telling what a gradual rise of eight or ten feet may make in the quality of the air. To the stranger all London seems a vast level, with perhaps here and there the sort of ground-swell you may note from your car-window in the passage of a Western plain. Ludgate Hill is truly a rise of ground, but Tower Hill is only such a bad eminence as may gloomily lift itself in history irrespective of the actual topography. Such an elevation as our own Murray Hill would be a noticeable height in London, and there are no such noble inequalities as in our up-town streets along the Hudson. All great modern cities love the plain surfaces, and London is not different from Chicago, or Philadelphia, or Paris, or Berlin, or Vienna, or St. Petersburg, or Milan in this; New York is much more mountainous, and Boston is a Sierra Nevada in comparison.|$|R

60|$|And now as to results. It is {{something}} {{to say that in}} this way 10,000 volumes can be placed within a room of quite ordinary size, all visible, all within easy reach, and without destroying the character of the apartment as a room. But, on the strength of a case with which I am acquainted, I will even be a little more particular. I take as before a room of forty feet in length and twenty in breadth, thoroughly lighted by four windows on each side; <b>as</b> <b>high</b> <b>as</b> <b>you</b> please, but with only about nine feet of height taken for the bookcases: inasmuch as all heavy ladders, all adminicula requiring more than one hand to carry with care, are forsworn. And there is no gallery.

6000|$|... "The {{likes of}} us--the likes of us!" [...] Mrs. Rooth {{repeated}} plaintively {{and with a}} resentment as vain as a failure to sneeze. [...] "I don't know what you're talking about and I decline to be turned upside down, I've my ideas as well as you, and I repudiate the charge of false humility. I've been through too many troubles to be proud, and a pleasant, polite manner was the rule of my life even in the days when, God knows, I had everything. I've never changed and if with God's help I had a civil tongue then, I've a civil tongue now. It's more than you always have, my poor, perverse, passionate child. Once a lady always a lady--all the footlights in the world, turn them up <b>as</b> <b>high</b> <b>as</b> <b>you</b> will, make no difference there. And I think people know it, people who know anything--if I may use such an expression--and it's because they know it that I'm not afraid to address them in a pleasant way. So I must say--and I call Mr. Dormer to witness, for if he could reason with you a bit about it he might render several people a service--your conduct to Mr. Sherringham simply breaks my heart," [...] Mrs. Rooth concluded, taking a jump of several steps in the fine modern avenue of her argument.|$|E
6000|$|I can fancy your losing {{patience}} with me altogether just now. [...] "We asked this fellow down {{to tell our}} workmen how to make shawls, and he is only trying {{to teach them how}} to caricature." [...] But have a little {{patience with}} me, and examine, after I have done, a little for yourselves into the history of ornamental art, and you will discover why I do this. You will discover, I repeat, that all great ornamental art whatever is founded on the effort of the workman to draw the figure, and, in the best schools, to draw all that he saw about him in living nature. The best art of pottery is acknowledged to be that of Greece, and all the power of design exhibited in it, down to the merest zigzag, arises primarily from the workman having been forced to outline nymphs and knights; from those helmed and draped figures he holds his power. Of Egyptian ornament I have just spoken. You have everything given there that the workman saw; people of his nation employed in hunting, fighting, fishing, visiting, making love, building, cooking--everything they did is drawn, magnificently or familiarly, as was needed. In Byzantine ornament, saints, or animals which are types of various spiritual power, are the main subjects; and from the church down to the piece of enamelled metal, figure,--figure,--figure, always principal. In Norman and Gothic work you have, with all their quiet saints, also other much disquieted persons, hunting, feasting, fighting, and so on; or whole hordes of animals racing after each other. In the Bayeux tapestry, Queen Matilda gave, as well as she could,--in many respects graphically enough,--the whole history of the conquest of England. Thence, as you increase in power of art, you have more and more finished figures, up to the solemn sculptures of Wells Cathedral, or the cherubic enrichments of the Venetian Madonna dei Miracoli. Therefore, I will tell you fearlessly, for I know it is true, you must raise your workman up to life, or you will never get from him one line of well-imagined conventionalism. We have at present no good ornamental design. We can't have it yet, and we must be patient if we want to have it. Do not hope to feel the effect of your schools at once, but raise the men <b>as</b> <b>high</b> <b>as</b> <b>you</b> can, and then let them stoop as low as you need; no great man ever minds stooping. Encourage the students, in sketching accurately and continually from nature anything that comes in their way--still life, flowers, animals; but, above all, figures; and so far as you allow of any difference between an artist's training and theirs, let it be, not in what they draw, but in the degree of conventionalism you require in the sketch.|$|E
