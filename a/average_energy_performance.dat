The simulated results from the AMY are compared to those from TMY 3 to determine and analyze the differences. It was found that yearly weather variation has significant impact on building performance especially peak electric demand.

EPCs may enable rent premiums for energy efficient dwellings, incentivizing energy efficiency investment in rental property. However, low EPC disclosure rates may undermine their potential to promote investment. Using a cross-sectional dataset of residential rental advertisements from Brussels, we estimate rent premiums from EPCs under de facto voluntary EPC disclosure. We use the Heckman correction and an instrumental variable approach to tackle potential selection bias and endogeneity.

40|$|AbstractDuring {{the last}} years the aim to reduce {{environmental}} impacts in the building sector {{has led to the}} development of assessment methods called protocols, to certify the sustainable quality of the building, such as the ITACA Protocol. In the present work the national version 2011 of the ITACA Protocol has been applied to several residential buildings study cases, and the resulting performances have been compared with a reference building with the same geometric shape and performances within the limit of the law. These results have been compared with the <b>average</b> <b>energy</b> <b>performance</b> of an Italian residential estate, to evaluate the contribution to climate change adaption. Furthermore, the comparison has also been carried out from the costs point of view, to verify the necessity of long-term subsidizing policies. The criteria used to analyze the effective impact reduction are: primary energy for heating and hot water and related CO 2 emissions. The average value of savings in energy consumption obtained in the evaluated building (designed and certified with the ITACA Protocol, compared to reaching the law limit value) is 51. 25 kWh/m 2 ·y, with corresponding 8. 52 kg CO 2 /m 2 ·y emissions saved. Intervening on 22 % of the current Italian housing estates with the performances of the study cases, results in a reduction of the energy load of 20. 10 %.

40|$|MBA, North-West University, Vaal Triangle Campus, 2005 Setting {{performance}} targets {{for a business}} is a strategically important function. These targets focus the efforts of teams and team members, and as such define the direction of development of the business's competencies and thus its competitiveness. In the highly competitive world of commodities, {{it is imperative that}} resources be focused optimally. This implies that the focus be placed on those few aspects that if achieved, it would yield maximum benefit. The objective of this report is to, for the Natref refinery: • Define and prioritise those business aspects that should be focused on {{over the next three years}} so as to maximise profit and long-term competitiveness, • Define target performance levels for the respective aspects, and • Define interim targets that could be applied in yearly performance incentive schemes. The aspects of importance for Natref have been defined through an analysis of the South African liquid fuel industry, its profit profile and the implications for Natref specifically. Benchmarking was primarily based on the 2002 refinery performance survey, as executed by Solomon Associates. Optimal profit performance is subject to the combination of optimal integration, and optimal relative performance of the contributing functional roles. Over-emphasis of one role relative to another inevitably results in lower than achievable long-term profitability. Benchmarking the relative performance of refineries is complicated by the extensive differences between refineries and their respective business situations. As a result, technical aspects can be consistently compared through a process of normalisation and peer groups. However, no fundamentally sound method could be found to compare the overall performance of refineries in different business situations. Return-on-investment and refining margin were evaluated, but found unsuitable for this purpose. As a compromise, the Profit Index as developed by Natref, is proposed for evaluating integrated refinery performance. In addition, a new parameter, the Profit Potential Index, aimed at measuring growth of relevant value-adding capability, is proposed. Evaluation of and {{performance targets}} for total cash cost, fixed cost, and variable cost, round of evaluation of integrated performance. Total production cost, including fixed and variable cost, has to improve by approximately 10 % to be competitive with the Asia-Pacific peer group and other South African refineries. It is proposed to achieve a 10 % composite cost reduction over the next three years. The targeted improvement in energy consumption, if achieved, could represent the full 10 % reduction in operating cost. It was found that Natrefs performance in terms of energy efficiency was of the poorest of all the refineries included in the 2002 benchmarking survey. Given the increasing cost of energy, it is considered critical to improve energy efficiency. The proposed three-year performance target of 92 Ell, if achieved, will result in matching the <b>average</b> <b>energy</b> <b>performance</b> of the Asia-Pacific peer group, but will still fall short of the energy efficiency of the best performers in the group. Refinery availability is of strategic importance in the current industry situation where Natref production is cut back due. to over-capacity and tactics. It is thus recommended that performance in terms of availability be targeted to be first quartile, whereas third quartile performance was achieved in the 2002 benchmarking survey. The overall availability performance is required to increase to 96. 7 %. The following practices are recommended for implementation in addition to the performance targets set: Operating cost is strongly influenced by the R/$ exchange rate. Systems are required to proactively identify the impact of this exchange rate. In contrast with previous practice of always operating Natref at full capacity, Natrefs production rate is subject to market share, product demand and price competitiveness since termination of the Main Supply Agreement. Sasol' s overall unbalanced product slate results in Sasol being long in petrol production capacity and short in diesel production capacity. Sasol is thus obliged to sell part of its petrol production at discount prices, which motivates other producer-distributors to maximise their production of diesel and to minimise petrol production. Marginal sales are in competition with the marginal cost of production with other South African refineries for inland sales, and with that of Asia-Pacific peer group refineries for export markets. More emphasis is thus required on knowledge of marginal production cost, and on minimising marginal production cost than was before. It is concluded that producer-distributors utilise the imbalance in product supply capacity stemming from Synfuels' product slate to negotiate price discounts. It would thus be in the interest of the producer-distributors to increase their production capacity according to demand growth so as to maintain the petrol over-supply situation and thus reduced purchase prices. The optimisation model for the refinery forms the backbone towards determining not only the marginal cost of production, but also for optimisation of business decisions, crude purchasing, profit apportionment between the Shareholders, and for determining the Profit Index and the Profit Potential Index. As such it is recommended that the accuracy of this model be targeted at 15 USc/bbl. Finally, crude oil cost represents approximately 90 % of the overall production cost. Yet the refinery has only indirect input on crude slate optimisation, i. e. via the accuracy and number of crudes represented in the refinery model. It is recommended that this input be expanded.

Most of the residential buildings or building units that were studied were “E” class (53. 6 %).

Tertiary sector buildings were found to have slightly better <b>energy</b> <b>performance</b> (26. 4 % of buildings were rated “D class”), with an <b>average</b> <b>energy</b> consumption of 317. 8 kWhp/m 2. Modern buildings consume less energy, as they must meet the higher <b>energy</b> <b>performance</b> requirements stated in thermal building regulations. Residential buildings or building units located in hotter climate zones consume slightly less energy than those located in colder zones, mainly because heating accounts for a high percentage of overall energy expenditure (70 – 75 % in residential buildings). A significant proportion of the energy consumed in tertiary sector buildings is for lighting (37. 2 %). This research defines the current energy consumption baseline of existing buildings in Spain.

The impact of this variation is clearly shown in the comparison between the <b>average</b> photon <b>energy</b> versus irradiance plot and the efficiency versus irradiance plot of the clear day data. These plot show that the relatively higher <b>average</b> photon <b>energy</b> relates to a relatively lower efficiency. This effect confirmed by the overall statistic taken over all four days whereby the higher than <b>average</b> <b>average</b> photon <b>energy</b> and lower than average efficiency has the highest share in the measurements. The difference between the two investigated module types (amorphous and (multi) crystalline) is proven in the efficiency versus irradiance plot. The behaviour at the relatively higher <b>average</b> photon <b>energy</b> is similar in both cases. In the case of the relatively lower <b>average</b> photon <b>energy</b> the efficiency of the amorphous modules remains at the same level as at <b>average</b> <b>average</b> photon <b>energies.</b> The impact of clouds on the spectral irradiance distribution is investigated in this project.

40|$|Building {{portfolio}} management {{on campus and}} metropolitan scale involves decisions about energy retrofits, energy resource pooling, and investments in shared energy systems, such as district cooling, community PV and wind power, CHP systems, geothermal systems etc. There are currently no tools that help a portfolio/campus manager make these decisions by rapid comparison of variants. The research has developed an energy supply network management tool at the campus scale. The underlying network <b>energy</b> <b>performance</b> (NEP) model uses (1) an existing <b>energy</b> <b>performance</b> toolkit to quantify the <b>energy</b> <b>performance</b> of building <b>energy</b> consumers on hourly basis, and (2) added modules to calculate hourly <b>average</b> <b>energy</b> generation {{from a wide variety}} of energy supply systems. The NEP model supports macro decisions at the generation side (decisions about adding or retrofitting campus wide systems) and consumption side (planning of new building design and retrofit measures). It allows testing different supply topologies by inspecting which consumer nodes should connect to which local suppliers and to which global suppliers, i. e. the electricity and gas utility grids. A prototype software implementation allows a portfolio or campus manager to define the demand and supply nodes on campus scale and manipulate the connections between them through a graphical interface. The NEP model maintains the network topology which is represented by a directed graph with the supply and demand nodes as vertices and their connections as arcs. Every change in the graph automatically triggers an update of the energy generation and consumption pattern, the results of which are shown on campus wide <b>energy</b> <b>performance</b> dashboards. The dissertation shows how the NEP model supports decision making with respect to large-scale building energy system design with a case study of the Georgia Tech campus evaluating the following three assertions: 1. The normative calculations at the individual building scale are accurate enough to support the network <b>energy</b> <b>performance</b> analysis 2.

To meet the goal that all new buildings should be nearly zero-energy buildings by 2020, set in the EU directive 2010 / 31 /EU [1] on the <b>energy</b> <b>performance</b> of buildings (EPBD recast), the building sector in Europe now faces a transition towards buildings with improved <b>energy</b> <b>performance.</b> In such a transition, a discussion is needed about {{the objective of the}} improvement – why, or to what end, the building <b>energy</b> <b>performance</b> should be improved. The objective of improving building <b>energy</b> <b>performance</b> is often a political decision, but scientific research can contribute with knowledge on how the objectives can be achieved. This thesis addresses how the indicators used in the requirements used to achieve building <b>energy</b> <b>performance</b> in Sweden, Norway, and Finland, and the methods used to evaluate these requirements, reflect building <b>energy</b> <b>performance.</b> It also addresses difficulties in achieving comparable and verifiable indicators in evaluations of building <b>energy</b> <b>performance.</b> The research objective has two parts: to review, compare, and discuss (i) requirements and (ii) evaluation methods used to achieve <b>energy</b> <b>performance</b> of residential buildings in Sweden, Norway and Finland. The work in this thesis includes reviews of the requirements used in national building codes and passive house criteria to achieve building <b>energy</b> <b>performance,</b> of methods used to evaluate compliance with such requirements, and of methods used specifically to evaluate the indicator Envelope Air Tightness. The results show that different sets of indicators are used to achieve building <b>energy</b> <b>performance</b> in the studied building codes and passive house criteria. The methods used to evaluate compliance with requirements used to achieve building <b>energy</b> <b>performance</b> are also different, but calculation methods are generally more often used than measurement methods. The calculation- and measurement methods used are often simple. A methodology to analyze the deviation between predictions- and measurements of building <b>energy</b> <b>performance</b> (the performance gap) was developed, to investigate the effects of different evaluation methods on different indicators used to achieve building <b>energy</b> <b>performance.</b> The methodology was tested in a case-study. This study indicated that the choice of method affects which parts of the performance gap reflected in the indicators Supplied Energy (see Terminology), Net Energy (see Terminology), and Overall U-value. Among the reviewed methods to evaluate air tightness, the Fan/Blower Door Pressurization is well known and preferred by professionals in the field. The results in this thesis may be useful when choosing indicators and evaluation methods to achieve different objectives of improving building <b>energy</b> <b>performance</b> and in the quest towards comparable and verifiable indicators used to achieve building <b>energy</b> <b>performance.</b> Increasing <b>Energy</b> Efficiency in Buildings (IEEB) Sustainable Buildings for the High North (SBHN...|$|R

Building information and energy consumption data had been collected by field survey of 45 star hotels. The {{results show that}} the hotels were mostly built after 1990 s, and the area of guest room accounts {{for more than half of}} the gross floor area. The breakdown of energy use shows that electricity is the main energy source, which accounts for 75 % of total energy consumption. The annual <b>average</b> <b>energy</b> use intensity (EUI) for 3 -star, 4 -star and 5 -star hotels are 61. 95 kgce/m 2, 73. 18 kgce/m 2 and 86. 64 kgce/m 2 respectively by converting all consumed energy into equivalent coal. In addition, some other factors were also reviewed such as occupancy rate and hotel's class. Some suggestions are put forward to improve <b>energy</b> <b>performance</b> of hotel buildings...|$|R
