5|$|Given that FH {{is present}} from birth and <b>atherosclerotic</b> changes may begin early in life, it is {{sometimes}} necessary to treat adolescents or even teenagers with agents that were originally developed for adults. Due to safety concerns, many physicians prefer to use bile acid sequestrants and fenofibrate as these are licensed in children. Nevertheless, statins seem safe and effective, and in older children {{may be used as}} in adults.|$|E
25|$|Diabetics, despite {{not having}} {{clinically}} detectable <b>atherosclerotic</b> disease, have more severe debility from <b>atherosclerotic</b> events over time than non-diabetics {{who have already}} had <b>atherosclerotic</b> events. Thus diabetes has been upgraded {{to be viewed as}} an advanced <b>atherosclerotic</b> disease equivalent.|$|E
25|$|<b>Atherosclerotic</b> plaque {{contains}} vascular {{smooth muscle}} cells, macrophages and endothelial cells and {{these have been}} found to accumulate 8-oxoG, a common type of oxidative DNA damage. DNA strand breaks also increased in <b>atherosclerotic</b> plaques, thus linking DNA damage to plaque formation.|$|E
25|$|The {{actions of}} macrophages drive <b>atherosclerotic</b> plaque progression.|$|E
25|$|Calcification at {{the outer}} base of older or more {{advanced}} lesions. <b>Atherosclerotic</b> lesions, or <b>atherosclerotic</b> plaques, are separated into two broad categories: Stable and unstable (also called vulnerable). The pathobiology of <b>atherosclerotic</b> lesions is very complicated, but generally, stable <b>atherosclerotic</b> plaques, {{which tend to}} be asymptomatic, are rich in extracellular matrix and smooth muscle cells. On the other hand, unstable plaques are rich in macrophages and foam cells, and the extracellular matrix separating the lesion from the arterial lumen (also known as the fibrous cap) is usually weak and prone to rupture. Ruptures of the fibrous cap expose thrombogenic material, such as collagen, to the circulation and eventually induce thrombus formation in the lumen. Upon formation, intraluminal thrombi can occlude arteries outright (e.g., coronary occlusion), but more often they detach, move into the circulation, and eventually occlude smaller downstream branches causing thromboembolism.|$|E
25|$|An autopsy {{revealed}} Warrior {{died of a}} {{heart attack}} caused by <b>atherosclerotic</b> cardiovascular disease.|$|E
25|$|When inhaled, ozone {{reacts with}} {{compounds}} lining the lungs to form specific, cholesterol-derived metabolites that {{are thought to}} facilitate the build-up and pathogenesis of <b>atherosclerotic</b> plaques (a form of heart disease). These metabolites have been confirmed as naturally occurring in human <b>atherosclerotic</b> arteries and are categorized into a class of secosterols termed atheronals, generated by ozonolysis of cholesterol's double bond to form a 5,6 secosterol {{as well as a}} secondary condensation product via aldolization.|$|E
25|$|Besides the {{traditional}} diagnostic {{methods such as}} angiography and stress-testing, other detection techniques have been developed in the past decades for earlier detection of <b>atherosclerotic</b> disease. Some of the detection approaches include anatomical detection and physiologic measurement.|$|E
25|$|Monocyte counts, {{as well as}} {{cholesterol}} markers such as LDL:HDL {{ratio and}} apolipiprotein B: apolipoprotein A-1 ratio {{can be used as}} markers to monitor the extent of <b>atherosclerotic</b> regression which proves useful in guiding patient treatments.|$|E
25|$|According to United States {{data for}} 2004, in about 66% {{of men and}} 47% of women, the first symptom of <b>atherosclerotic</b> {{cardiovascular}} disease is {{a heart attack or}} sudden cardiac death (death within one hour of onset of the symptom).|$|E
25|$|The <b>atherosclerotic</b> {{process is}} not fully understood. Atherosclerosis is {{initiated}} by inflammatory processes in the endothelial cells of the vessel wall associated with retained low-density lipoprotein (LDL) particles. This retention may be a cause, an effect, or both, of the underlying inflammatory process.|$|E
25|$|Atherosclerosis: The AAA {{was long}} {{considered}} {{to be caused by}} atherosclerosis, because the walls of the AAA frequently carry an <b>atherosclerotic</b> burden. However, this hypothesis cannot be used to explain the initial defect and the development of occlusion, which is observed in the process.|$|E
25|$|Numerous studies linking edentulism with {{instances}} {{of disease and}} medical conditions have been reported. In a cross-sectional study, Hamasha and others found significant differences between edentulous and dentate individuals with respect to rates of <b>atherosclerotic</b> vascular disease, heart failure, ischemic heart disease and joint disease.|$|E
25|$|A true {{aneurysm}} is {{one that}} involves all three layers of the wall of an artery (intima, media and adventitia). True aneurysms include <b>atherosclerotic,</b> syphilitic, and congenital aneurysms, as well as ventricular aneurysms that follow transmural myocardial infarctions (aneurysms that involve all layers of the attenuated wall of the heart are also considered true aneurysms).|$|E
25|$|Two of {{the cell}} types {{targeted}} for DNA methylation polymorphisms are monocytes and lymphocytes, which experience an overall hypomethylation. One proposed mechanism behind this global hypomethylation is elevated homocysteine levels causing hyperhomocysteinemia, a known risk factor for cardiovascular disease. High plasma levels of homocysteine inhibit DNA methyltransferases, which causes hypomethylation. Hypomethylation of DNA affects gene that alter smooth muscle cell proliferation, cause endothelial cell dysfunction, and increase inflammatory mediators, {{all of which are}} critical in forming <b>atherosclerotic</b> lesions. High levels of homocysteine also result in hypermethylation of CpG islands in the promoter region of the estrogen receptor alpha (ERα) gene, causing its down regulation. ERα protects against atherosclerosis due to its action as a growth suppressor, causing the smooth muscle cells to remain in a quiescent state. Hypermethylation of the ERα promoter thus allows intimal smooth muscle cells to proliferate excessively and {{contribute to the development of}} the <b>atherosclerotic</b> lesion.|$|E
25|$|The lowest {{incidence}} of <b>atherosclerotic</b> events over time occurs within the <20% group, with increased {{rates for the}} higher groups. Multiple other measures, including particle sizes, small LDL particle concentrations, large total and HDL particle concentrations, along with estimations of insulin resistance pattern and standard cholesterol lipid measurements (for comparison of the plasma data with the estimation methods discussed above) are also routinely provided.|$|E
25|$|The {{distribution}} of <b>atherosclerotic</b> plaques {{in a part}} of arterial endothelium is inhomogeneous. The multiple and focal development of <b>atherosclerotic</b> changes is similar to that in the development of amyloid plaques in the brain and that of age spots on the skin. Misrepair-accumulation aging theory suggests that misrepair mechanisms {{play an important role in}} the focal development of atherosclerosis. Development of a plaque is a result of repair of injured endothelium. Because of the infusion of lipids into sub-endothelium, the repair has to end up with altered remodeling of local endothelium. This is the manifestation of a misrepair. Important is this altered remodeling makes the local endothelium have increased fragility to damage and have reduced repair-efficiency. As a consequence, this part of endothelium has increased risk to be injured and to be misrepaired. Thus, the accumulation of misrepairs of endothelium is focalized and self-accelerating. In this way, the growing of a plaque is also self-accelerating. With{{in a part of}} arterial wall, the oldest plaque is always the biggest, and is the most dangerous one to cause blockage of local artery.|$|E
25|$|Hypertensive {{heart disease}} {{is the result of}} {{structural}} and functional adaptations leading to left ventricular hypertrophy, diastolic dysfunction, CHF, abnormalities of blood flow due to <b>atherosclerotic</b> coronary artery disease and microvascular disease, and cardiac arrhythmias. Individuals with left ventricular hypertrophy are at increased risk for, stroke, CHF, and sudden death. Aggressive control of hypertension can regress or reverse left ventricular hypertrophy and reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease.|$|E
25|$|By radiographic, i.e. X-Ray, methods, after arteries have {{developed}} advanced calcified <b>atherosclerotic</b> plaque, IMT {{can also be}} semi-estimated by {{the distance between the}} outer edges of calcification (actually this leaves out most of the media) and the outer edges of an angiographic dye column within the artery lumen. This is a far more complex technique; it is invasive to the body due to the use of X-Ray radiation, catheters and angiographic contrast agents.|$|E
25|$|CYR61 is overexpressed in {{vascular}} {{smooth muscle}} cells of <b>atherosclerotic</b> lesions {{and in the}} neointima of restenosis after balloon angioplasty, both in rodent models and in humans. Suppression of CYR61 expression results in reduced neointimal hyperplasia after balloon angioplasty, an effect that is reversed by delivery of CYR61 via gene transfer In a mouse model of oxygen-induced retinopathy, expression of CYR61 in the vitreous humor produced significant beneficial effects in repairing damaged vasculature.|$|E
25|$|On June 16, 2012, Chizek {{suffered}} a heart attack in Orlando International Airport. He was found unresponsive on a terminal bench. After being transported to Florida Hospital East, he died at 7:40 p.m. from <b>atherosclerotic</b> and hypertensive heart disease, according to the local Medical Examiner's Office. He was en route to the Walt Disney World Resort, taking ten children from the Cleveland Heights area on a summer trip as part of his annual New Adventures charity.|$|E
25|$|Coronary artery luminal {{narrowing}} {{reduces the}} flow reserve for oxygenated {{blood to the}} heart, typically producing intermittent angina. Very advanced luminal occlusion usually produces a heart attack. However, it has been increasingly recognized, since the late 1980s, that coronary catheterization does not allow {{the recognition of the}} presence or absence of coronary atherosclerosis itself, only significant luminal changes which have occurred as a result of end stage complications of the <b>atherosclerotic</b> process. See IVUS and atheroma for a better understanding of this issue.|$|E
25|$|The role {{of iodine}} in marine fishes (rich in iodine) and {{freshwater}} fishes (iodine-deficient) {{is not completely}} understood, {{but it has been}} reported that freshwater fishes are more susceptible to infectious and, in particular, neoplastic and <b>atherosclerotic</b> diseases, of marine fishes. Marine elasmobranch fishes such as sharks, stingrays etc. are much less affected by cancer than freshwater fishes, and therefore have stimulated medical research to better understand carcinogenesis so it can be useful in other animals and especially in humans.|$|E
25|$|Small vessel disease {{involves}} the smaller arteries inside the brain: {{branches of the}} circle of Willis, middle cerebral artery, stem, and arteries arising from the distal vertebral and basilar artery. Diseases that may form thrombi in the small vessels include (in descending incidence): lipohyalinosis (build-up of fatty hyaline matter in the blood vessel {{as a result of}} high blood pressure and aging) and fibrinoid degeneration (a stroke involving these vessels are known as a lacunar stroke) and microatheroma (small <b>atherosclerotic</b> plaques).|$|E
25|$|The <b>atherosclerotic,</b> hypertension-related {{vascular}} lesions in {{the kidney}} primarily affect the preglomerular arterioles, resulting in ischemic {{changes in the}} glomeruli and postglomerular structures. Glomerular injury {{may also be a}} consequence of direct damage to the glomerular capillaries due to glomerular hyperperfusion. Glomerular pathology progresses to glomerulosclerosis, and eventually the renal tubules may also become ischemic and gradually atrophic. The renal lesion associated with malignant hypertension consists of fibrinoid necrosis of the afferent arterioles, sometimes extending into the glomerulus, and may result in focal necrosis of the glomerular tuft.|$|E
25|$|Both {{anatomic}} and physiologic methods allow {{early detection}} before symptoms show up, disease staging and tracking of disease progression. Anatomic methods {{are more expensive}} {{and some of them}} are invasive in nature, such as IVUS. On the other hand, physiologic methods are often less expensive and safer. But they do not quantify the current state of the disease or directly track progression. In recent years, developments in nuclear imaging techniques such as PET and SPECT have provided ways of estimating the severity of <b>atherosclerotic</b> plaques.|$|E
25|$|Apart from thromboembolism, chronically {{expanding}} <b>atherosclerotic</b> lesions {{can cause}} complete {{closure of the}} lumen. Chronically expanding lesions are often asymptomatic until lumen stenosis is so severe (usually over 80%) that blood supply to downstream tissue(s) is insufficient, resulting in ischemia. These complications of advanced atherosclerosis are chronic, slowly progressive and cumulative. Most commonly, soft plaque suddenly ruptures (see vulnerable plaque), causing {{the formation of a}} thrombus that will rapidly slow or stop blood flow, leading to death of the tissues fed by the artery in approximately five minutes. This event is called an infarction.|$|E
25|$|Scleroderma, polymyositis, and {{dermatomyositis}} elicit {{little or}} no CRP response. CRP levels also tend not to be elevated in SLE unless serositis or synovitis is present. Elevations of CRP {{in the absence of}} clinically significant inflammation can occur in renal failure. CRP level is an independent risk factor for <b>atherosclerotic</b> disease. Patients with high CRP concentrations are more likely to develop stroke, myocardial infarction, and severe peripheral vascular disease. Elevated level of CRP can also be observed in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), including Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis.|$|E
25|$|A stroke is {{the rapid}} decline of brain {{function}} {{due to a}} disturbance in the supply of blood to the brain. This can be due to ischemia, thrombus, embolus (a lodged particle) or hemorrhage (a bleed). In thrombotic stroke, a thrombus (blood clot) usually forms around <b>atherosclerotic</b> plaques. Since blockage of the artery is gradual, onset of symptomatic thrombotic strokes is slower. Thrombotic stroke {{can be divided into}} two categories—large vessel disease and small vessel disease. The former affects vessels such as the internal carotids, vertebral and the circle of Willis. The latter can affect smaller vessels such as the branches of the circle of Willis.|$|E
25|$|Initial {{reports of}} Savage's death {{indicated}} {{that he had been}} killed in the collision, when, in fact, {{he and his wife had}} been wearing seatbelts and suffered only minor physical injuries in the crash. An autopsy performed by the medical examiner's office found that he had an enlarged heart and advanced coronary artery disease (more than 90% narrowed). The drugs found in his system included a prescription painkiller and a small amount of alcohol. Savage had never been treated for heart problems and there was no evidence that he was aware of his heart condition. The cause of death was officially ruled as <b>atherosclerotic</b> heart disease.|$|E
25|$|It is {{relatively}} unusual (25% {{of the total}} number of cases) for cholesterol emboli to occur spontaneously; this usually happens in people with severe atherosclerosis of the large arteries such as the aorta. In the other 75% it is a complication of medical procedures involving the blood vessels, such as vascular surgery or angiography. In coronary catheterization, for instance, the incidence is 1.4%. Furthermore, cholesterol embolism may develop after the commencement of anticoagulants or thrombolytic medication that decrease blood clotting or dissolve blood clots, respectively. They probably lead to cholesterol emboli by removing blood clots that cover up a damaged <b>atherosclerotic</b> plaque; cholesterol-rich debris can then enter the bloodsteam.|$|E
25|$|The modern {{clinical}} {{application of}} the principle of angiogenesis can be divided into two main areas: anti-angiogenic therapies, which angiogenic research began with, and pro-angiogenic therapies. Whereas anti-angiogenic therapies are being employed to fight cancer and malignancies, which require an abundance of oxygen and nutrients to proliferate, pro-angiogenic therapies are being explored as options to treat cardiovascular diseases, the number one cause of death in the Western world. One of the first applications of pro-angiogenic methods in humans was a German trial using fibroblast growth factor 1 (FGF-1) for the treatment of coronary artery disease. Clinical research in therapeutic angiogenesis is ongoing for a variety of <b>atherosclerotic</b> diseases, like coronary heart disease, peripheral arterial disease, wound healing disorders, etc.|$|E
25|$|King's {{cause of}} death was {{determined}} to be multi-infarct dementia, brought on by a series of small strokes caused by <b>atherosclerotic</b> vascular disease as a consequence of type 2 diabetes. However, two of his daughters alleged that King was deliberately poisoned by two associates trying to induce diabetic shock. The Clark County coroner's office confirmed on May 25, 2015, that it was performing an autopsy on King's body and conducting a homicide investigation with the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department, although CNN reported that initial indications did not support the notion of foul play. The autopsy revealed King's death was of complications of Alzheimer's disease and congestive heart failure, with no evidence of poisoning.|$|E
25|$|Arterial ultrasound, {{especially}} of the carotid arteries, with measurement of {{the thickness of the}} artery wall, offers a way to partially track the disease progression. As of 2006, the thickness, commonly referred to as IMT for intimal-medial thickness, is not measured clinically though it has been used by some researchers since the mid-1990s to track changes in arterial walls. Traditionally, clinical carotid ultrasounds have only estimated the degree of blood lumen restriction, stenosis, a result of very advanced disease. The National Institute of Health did a five-year $5 million study, headed by medical researcher Kenneth Ouriel, to study intravascular ultrasound techniques regarding <b>atherosclerotic</b> plaque. More progressive clinicians have begun using IMT measurement as a way to quantify and track disease progression or stability within individual patients.|$|E
25|$|The {{endothelium}} {{of blood}} vessels produces an extensive range of substances that influence blood flow and, in turn, is affected by changes in the blood and the pressure of blood flow. For example, local nitric oxide and endothelin, which are secreted by the endothelium, are the major regulators of vascular tone and blood pressure. In patients with essential hypertension, the balance between the vasodilators and the vasoconstrictors is upset, which leads {{to changes in the}} endothelium and sets up a “vicious cycle” that contributes to the maintenance of high blood pressure. In patients with hypertension, endothelial activation and damage also lead to changes in vascular tone, vascular reactivity, and coagulation and fibrinolytic pathways. Alterations in endothelial function are a reliable indicator of target organ damage and <b>atherosclerotic</b> disease, as well as prognosis.|$|E
25|$|In {{laboratory}} experiments, animals {{exposed to}} certain PAHs have shown increased development of plaques (atherogenesis) within arteries. Potential mechanisms for the pathogenesis {{and development of}} <b>atherosclerotic</b> plaques may {{be similar to the}} mechanisms involved in the carcinogenic and mutagenic properties of PAHs. A leading hypothesis is that PAHs may activate the cytochrome enzyme CYP1B1 in vascular smooth muscle cells. This enzyme then metabolically processes the PAHs to quinone metabolites that bind to DNA in reactive adducts that remove purine bases. The resulting mutations may contribute to unregulated growth of vascular smooth muscle cells or to their migration {{to the inside of the}} artery, which are steps in plaque formation. These quinone metabolites also generate reactive oxygen species that may alter the activity of genes that affect plaque formation.|$|E
