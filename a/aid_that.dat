5|$|As Taylor took office, Congress faced {{a battery}} of {{questions}} related to the Mexican Cession, acquired by the U.S. after the Mexican War and divided into military districts. It was unclear which districts would be established into states and which would become federal territories, while the question of their slave status threatened to bitterly divide Congress. Additionally, many in the South had grown increasingly angry about the <b>aid</b> <b>that</b> northerners had given to fugitive slaves. While a southern slaveowner himself, Taylor believed that slavery was economically infeasible in the Mexican Cession, and as such he opposed slavery in those territories as a needless source of controversy. His major goal was sectional peace, preserving the Union through legislative compromise. As the threat of Southern secession grew, he sided increasingly with antislavery northerners such as Senator William H. Seward of New York, even suggesting that he would sign the Wilmot Proviso to ban slavery in federal territories should such a bill reach his desk.|$|E
5|$|Robert van Voren {{also says}} Russian {{psychiatry}} {{is now being}} headed by the same psychiatrists who was heading psychiatry in Soviet times. Since then Russian psychiatric system has not almost changed. In reality, we still see a sort of the Soviet psychiatry {{that was in the}} late 1980s. Russian psychiatrists {{do not have access to}} specialized literature published in other countries and do not understand what is world psychiatry. Staff training has not changed, literature is inaccessible, the same psychiatrists teach new generations of specialists. Those of them who know what is world psychiatry and know it is not the same as what is happening in Russia are silent and afraid. The powerful core of the old nomenklatura in psychiatry was concentrated in Moscow, and it was clear that the struggle inside their fortress would be not only difficult, but also it would be a waste of time, energy and resources, so the Global Initiative on Psychiatry has been avoiding Moscow almost completely for all the years. Instead, the Global Initiative on Psychiatry took active part in projects for reforming the mental health service in Ukraine, donated a printing plant to Ukrainian public, organized a publishing house, helped print a huge amount of medical and legal literature distributed for free, but the Ukrainian tax police accused the publishing house of manufacturing counterfeit dollars, and a significant part of humanitarian <b>aid</b> <b>that</b> the Global Initiative on Psychiatry had gathered in the Netherlands for Ukrainian psychiatric hospitals was stolen in Kiev.|$|E

40|$|Automation users often mistrust {{diagnostic}} <b>aids</b> <b>that</b> are imperfectly reliable (Parasuraman & Riley, 1997), {{particularly on}} occasions when automation errors appear conspicuous (c. f. Dzindolet, Peterson, Pomranky, Pierce, & Beck, in press), or simple to the user. Madhavan, Wiegmann, and Lacson, (2003) {{found that when}} operators catch easy mistakes made by an automated aid, it bolsters their self-confidence in their own ability to outperform the aid even on difficult tasks, resulting in automation under-trust and under-reliance. Specifically, Madhavan et al. proposed the “easy-errors hypothesis” <b>that</b> <b>aids</b> <b>that</b> miss targets exclusively on “easy ” tasks {{are more likely to}} be mistrusted than <b>aids</b> <b>that</b> generate misses only on “difficult ” tasks. However, such is rarely the case in the real world where systems are designed such that the probability of the system generating an error on an easy task is lower than that of generating an error on a difficult task. Easy automation errors are typically interspersed among more difficult errors. Therefore, the main purpose of this study was to examine the effects of such occasional easy errors on automation trust and reliance.

25|$|On December 23, 1972, a {{magnitude}} 6.2 earthquake leveled the capital city, Managua. The earthquake killed 10,000 of the city's 400,000 residents and left another 50,000 homeless. About 80% of Managua's commercial buildings were destroyed. President Anastasio Somoza Debayle's National Guard embezzled {{much of the}} international <b>aid</b> <b>that</b> flowed into the country to assist in reconstruction, and several parts of downtown Managua were never rebuilt. The president gave reconstruction contracts preferentially to family and friends, thereby profiting from the quake and increasing his control of the city's economy.

25|$|A {{sign that}} order had been {{restored}} among the Derg was {{the announcement of}} Mengistu Haile Mariam as head of state on February 11, 1977. However, the country remained in chaos as the military attempted to suppress its civilian opponents in a period known as the Red Terror (or Qey Shibir in Amharic). Despite the violence, the Soviet Union, which had been closely observing developments, {{came to believe that}} Ethiopia was developing into a genuine Marxist–Leninist state and that it was in Soviet interests to aid the new regime. They thus secretly approached Mengistu with offers of <b>aid</b> <b>that</b> he accepted. Ethiopia closed the U.S. military mission and the communications centre in April 1977.|$|E
25|$|In some jurisdictions, good Samaritan laws only {{protect those}} who have {{completed}} basic first aid training and are certified by health organizations, such as the American Heart Association, or American Red Cross, provided that they have acted {{within the scope of}} their training. In these jurisdictions, a person who is neither trained in first aid nor certified, and who performs first aid incorrectly, can be held legally liable for errors made. In other jurisdictions any rescuer is protected from liability so long as the responder acted rationally. In Florida, paramedics, EMTs, and Emergency Medical Responders (First Responders) are required by law to act under the Duty to Act law, which requires them to stop and give <b>aid</b> <b>that</b> falls within their practice.|$|E

25|$|Mobilization, popular {{demonstration}} and social movements, {{came together in}} a new way in response to the devastating 1985 earthquakes. The scope of the destruction invigorated the dormant women's movement to meet the immediate needs of families. Feminist groups, local grass-roots organizations, and NGOs stepped in to offer <b>aid</b> <b>that</b> the government or official political organizations were either unable or incapable of providing. There was a recognition during this time that a short-term disaster relief movement could be turned into an organization focused on implementing long-term political gain. Simultaneously, several worker's unions implemented female advisory boards, with the goals of educating, training and politically organizing garment workers. Feminists serving on advisory boards made workers aware that they could change the environment and attitude of their places of employment and demand changes in areas other than wages and hours. Expanding demands to address sexual harassment, cover child and health care, improve job training and education, raised workers awareness and changed the actual work conditions.|$|E

The terms of the agreement provided that the materiel was to be used until returned or destroyed. In practice very little equipment was returned. Supplies that arrived after the termination date were sold to Britain at a large discount for £1.075 billion, using long-term loans from the United States.
