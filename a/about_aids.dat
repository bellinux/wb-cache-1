5|$|In New York City, {{men like}} Larry Kramer and Paul Popham, who had {{previously}} shown no desire for leadership, were forced by bureaucratic apathy into forming the Gay Men's Health Crisis {{to raise money for}} medical research and to provide social services for scores of gay men who began getting sick with opportunistic infections.

5|$|Shilts made {{comparisons}} to the government's disparate {{reaction to the}} Chicago Tylenol murders, and the recent emergence of Legionnaire's Disease in 1977. In October 1982, seven people died after ingesting cyanide-laced Tylenol capsules. The New York Times wrote a front-page story about the Tylenol scare every day in October, and produced 33 more stories about the issue after that. More than 100 law enforcement agents, and 1,100 Food and Drug Administration employees worked on the case. Johnson & Johnson disclosed they spent $100million attempting to uncover who had tampered with the bottles. In October 1982, 634 people were reported having AIDS, and of those, 260 had died. The New York Times wrote three stories in 1981 and three more stories in 1982 <b>about</b> <b>AIDS,</b> none on the front page. The Tylenol Crisis was a criminal act of product-tampering; Legionnaire's Disease was a public health emergency. Twenty-nine members of the American Legion died in 1976 at a convention in Philadelphia. The National Institute of Health spent $34,841 per death of Legionnaire's Disease. In contrast, the NIH spent $3,225 in 1981 and about $8,991 in 1982 for each person who died of AIDS.|$|E

5|$|The {{publicity}} of Ryan White's story catapulted {{him into}} the national spotlight, amidst a growing wave of AIDS coverage in the news media. Between 1985 and 1987, the number of news stories <b>about</b> <b>AIDS</b> in the American media doubled. While isolated in middle school, White appeared frequently on national television and in newspapers to discuss his tribulations with the disease. Eventually, he became known as a poster child for the AIDS crisis, appearing in fundraising and educational campaigns for the syndrome. Ryan participated in numerous public benefits for children with AIDS. Many celebrities appeared with Ryan, starting during his trial and continuing {{for the rest of}} his life, to help publicly destigmatize socializing with people with AIDS. Singers John Cougar Mellencamp, Elton John and Michael Jackson, actor Matt Frewer, diver Greg Louganis, President Ronald Reagan and First Lady Nancy Reagan, Surgeon General Dr. C. Everett Koop, Indiana University basketball coach Bobby Knight and basketball player Kareem Abdul-Jabbar all befriended White. He also was a friend to many children with AIDS or other potentially debilitating conditions.|$|E

40|$|A {{considerable}} {{and increasing}} share {{of foreign aid}} stems from private donations. Hence, individual donors can increase social welfare in developing countries by directing their funds to the most effective NGOs. Surprisingly few studies have analyzed whether private donors care <b>about</b> <b>aid</b> effectiveness when they donate to an international charity. In a laboratory experiment, we investigate if private donors seek information about the exact impact of their donation to an international NGO before they donate. Furthermore, we investigate how relevant private donors find information <b>about</b> <b>aid</b> impact compared to information about administrative costs, and the recipient type who benefits from a donation. First, we find that a relatively small share of individuals makes a well-informed donation decision. Second, the demand for information <b>about</b> <b>aid</b> impact is lowest, and it is highest {{for information about the}} recipient type. Third, exact information <b>about</b> <b>aid</b> impact did not lead to a significant change in average donation levels, while information about the exact recipient type and administrative costs led to a significant change in donation levels. In the recipient type group, informed participants donated significantly more than uninformed participants because they "rewarded" the preferred recipient with higher-thanaverage transfers. In the administration costs group, informed participants donated significantly less than uninformed participants because they used the information to "punish" NGOs with high administration costs...|$|R

40|$|The {{question}} if private donors care <b>about</b> <b>aid</b> effectiveness when they donate {{to an international}} charity has received little attention {{in the literature on}} private charitable giving as well as in development microeconomics. This discussion is important, because a considerable share of foreign aid stems from private sources. Thus, individual donors can have an important influence on increasing social welfare by directing their funds to more effective organizations. We conducted a laboratory experiment to investigate if private donors want information about the exact Impact of their donation to an international charity before they donate, and how much they care <b>about</b> <b>aid</b> impact compared to other information: namely, information about administrations costs, and the recipient type benefiting from their donation. Our main results are the following. First, the demand was lowest for information <b>about</b> <b>aid</b> effectiveness, and highest for information about the recipient type. Second, donation levels were not significantly affected by differences in aid effectiveness, but were significantly affected by differences in administration costs, and recipient types. Participants in the administrations costs group used the additional information to punish the less preferred NGO by decreasing their transfers to zero. Participants in the recipient type group used the additional information to reward the preferred recipient type with higher-thanaverage transfers...|$|R
