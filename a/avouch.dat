60|$|Conrade arose boldly to answer, and in despite, as he {{expressed}} himself, {{of man and}} brute, king or dog, <b>avouched</b> his innocence of the crime charged.|$|R
6000|$|Our chronicler <b>avouched,</b> that on {{the sole}} of Bello's dexter foot was stamped the crest of Franko's king, his {{hereditary}} foe. [...] "Thus, thus," [...] cried Bello, stamping, [...] "thus I hourly crush him." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "For {{what should}} I forgive thee, silly wench?" [...] said Elizabeth; [...] "for being the {{daughter}} of thine own father? Thou art brain-sick, surely. Well I see I must wring the story from thee by inches. Thou didst deceive thine old and honoured father--thy look confesses it--cheated Master Tressilian--thy blush <b>avouches</b> it--and married this same Varney." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Before God and man, I will <b>avouch</b> the deed," [...] {{answered}} Endicott. [...] "Beat a flourish, drummer!--shout, {{soldiers and}} people!--in {{honor of the}} ensign of New England. Neither Pope nor Tyrant hath part in it now!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Away, fool!" [...] {{said the}} Lady; [...] "send me that hag hither; she shall <b>avouch</b> {{what it was}} that she hath given to the wretch Dryfesdale, or the pilniewinks and thumbikins shall wrench it out of her finger joints!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Aye, we {{know that}} the Frenchwoman can make the poor fool of a King believe and <b>avouch</b> {{anything}} she choose! This is not the point. No more words, young man. Here stands my daughter; there is the rope. Choose--wed or hang." ...|$|E

If the Master be unconscionable in his Dealing, and trades with lying words; or if bad Commodities be <b>avouched</b> to be good, or if {{he seeks}} after {{unreasonable}} gain, or the like; his servant sees it, and {{it is enough to}} undo him.

Eli's sons being bad before the congregation, made men despise the sacrifices of the Lord (1 Sam 2).|$|R
6000|$|... 2. The Quakers are deceivers, in {{that they}} persuade souls that Christ is crucified in them, dead within them, and kept down with some thing within them, which was never taught by those that spoke the scripture from the Spirit of God. Shew me a scripture to confirm such a {{doctrine}} as this, which hath been <b>avouched</b> over and over by the Quakers.|$|R

5000|$|In their {{retrospective}} review, Allmusic sarcastically {{suggested that}} the self-aggrandizing front cover of Schemer-Dreamer [...] "very well could be the greatest album cover in rock history." [...] They criticized the music itself as [...] "a big, loud, dumb arena rock record, one that sounds completely tied to its year, if not month, of release", but also <b>avouched</b> that [...] "it's kind of fun because of that".|$|R
6000|$|He did {{not know}} (alas! how men will lie) [...] That a report (especially the Greeks) [...] <b>Avouched</b> his death (such people never die), [...] And put his house in {{mourning}} several weeks,-- [...] But now their eyes and also lips were dry; [...] The bloom, too, had returned to Haidée's cheeks: [...] Her tears, too, being returned into their fount, [...] She now kept house upon her own account.|$|R
500|$|Critics {{praised the}} {{interactions}} between Amy and Andrea. Serba asserted that Kirkman effectively set up Amy's death {{at the beginning of}} the episode, and added that it established a sisterly bond. Serba also acclaimed Laurie Holden's performance; he stated that she [...] "powerfully conveys her grief and despair." [...] Pierce <b>avouched</b> that the opening sequence was likable, while Michelle Kung of The Wall Street Journal summated that the concluding scene was [...] "an emotional release after a tense build-up." ...|$|R

6000|$|The author seems principally to have valued {{himself on}} this piece, because it {{contains}} some scenes executed in rhyme, {{in what was then}} called the heroic manner. Upon this opinion, which Dryden lived to retract, I have ventured to offer my sentiments in the Life of the Author. In other respects, though not slow in perceiving and <b>avouching</b> his own merit, our author seems to consider the [...] "Rival Ladies" [...] as no very successful dramatic effort.|$|R
60|$|Had {{she been}} envious {{she might have}} hated the woman; {{but she did not}} do that--she allowed herself the {{pleasure}} of feeling fascinated. She wondered where the lady had come from. The stumpy and practical walk of honest homeliness which mostly prevailed there, the two styles of dress thereabout, the simple and the mistaken, equally <b>avouched</b> that this figure was no Casterbridge woman's, even if a book in her hand resembling a guide-book had not also suggested it.|$|R
25|$|The race is {{the most}} prestigious event of the IndyCar calendar, {{and one of the}} oldest and most {{important}} automobile races. It has been <b>avouched</b> to be the largest single-day sporting event in the entire world. Likewise, the Indianapolis Motor Speedway itself is regarded as the world's largest sporting facility in terms of capacity. The total purse exceeded $13 million in 2011, with over $2.5 million awarded to the winner, making it one of the richest cash prize funds in sports.|$|R
60|$|I {{own this}} to be a temper of so desperate a nature, that few females can be found willing to own {{themselves}} anyway addicted to it; and yet, it is thought that there is scarce a single parson, 'prentice, alderman, squire, or husband, who would not solemnly <b>avouch</b> the very reverse.|$|E
6000|$|The Norman knight gazed on the Flemish artisan, {{for such}} was Wilkin Flammock, {{with such a}} mixture of {{surprise}} and contempt, as excluded indignation. [...] "I have heard much," [...] he said, [...] "but {{this is the first}} time that I have heard one with a beard on his lip <b>avouch</b> himself a coward." ...|$|E
6000|$|Much {{alarmed at}} {{the import of}} these expressions, which seemed to burst from him even in sleep with the stern energy {{accompanying}} the perpetration of some act of violence, Morton shook his guest by the shoulder in order to awake him. The first words he uttered were, [...] "Bear me where ye will, I will <b>avouch</b> the deed!" ...|$|E
5000|$|Other sources {{include the}} vilâyetname of Otman Baba's {{successor}} Demir Baba, {{which refers to}} Otman Baba as the [...] "pole of poles" [...] and [...] "Pole of the Universe and Time", symbols of his high spiritual rank; the vilâyetname also <b>avouches</b> Otman Baba’s ability to instantly appear and disappear. Another source {{is the work of}} Evliya Çelebi, which cites Otman Baba as a leader of ascetic dervishes and a gazi (religious warrior) who helped conquer the Ottoman Empire's European province of Rumelia.|$|R
60|$|Tales {{of magic}} and of necromancy were the {{learning}} of the period, and Sir Kenneth heard his companion's confession of diabolical descent without any disbelief, and without much wonder; yet not without a secret shudder at finding himself in this fearful place, {{in the company of}} one who <b>avouched</b> himself to belong to such a lineage. Naturally insusceptible, however, of fear, he crossed himself, and stoutly demanded of the Saracen an account of the pedigree which he had boasted. The latter readily complied.|$|R
50|$|Maimonides, in his Epistle to Yemen, heaps lavish praises {{upon the}} Jews of Yemen in his day, and uses {{hyperbolic}} speech {{to describe the}} condition in which he found them. Evidently, Maimonides had knowledge of the Jews of Yemen, and <b>avouched</b> that they maintained a strict adherence to Jewish law and custom, long before his writings became widespread throughout Yemen. Unfortunately, the rhyme employed in his verse has {{been lost in the}} translation. The Epistle was sent from Egypt to Aden in anno 1173/4 CE.|$|R
6000|$|The knight, after a moment's recollection, said in reply, [...] "I will be {{open with}} you, my father--bid these men stand out of ear-shot, and I will tell you all I know of this mysterious business; and muse not, good father, though it may pass thy wit to expound it, for I <b>avouch</b> to you it is too dark for mine own." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'So please you, Sir,' growled {{the first}} in his throat, 'here stands Christopher Kitson of Barrowbridge, ready to <b>avouch</b> himself a true man, and prove in yonder fellow's teeth {{that it was not}} a broken-kneed beast that I sent up for a heriard to my Lord Archbishop when my father died; but that he of Easingwold is a black slanderer and backbiter.' ...|$|E
60|$|WHITE. Goodly? I {{feel most}} goodly heart and hand, And strong to throw ten Wyatts and all Kent. Ha! ha! sir; but you jest; I love it: a jest In time of danger shows the pulses even.

60|$|Hob {{had done}} nothing in that way, not even begun to teach him the quarterstaff, though he <b>avouched</b> that when there was cause the young lord was no craven, no more than any Clifford ever was--witness when he drove off the great hound, which some said was a wolf, when it fell upon the flock, or when none could hold him from {{climbing}} down the Giant's Cliff after the lamb that had fallen. No fear but he had heart enough to make his hand keep his own or other folks' heads.|$|R
6000|$|Thereupon he {{was told}} that advocates were not allowed to men accused of heresy, and that he had better take care how he contradicted his own deposition, or he would be {{condemned}} as relapsed. His own deposition, as three cardinals <b>avouched</b> that he had made it before them, was then translated to him from the Latin, which he did not understand. In horror-struck amazement at hearing such words ascribed to himself, the old knight twice made the sign of the cross, and exclaimed, [...] "If the cardinals were other sort of men, he should {{know how to deal with}} them!" ...|$|R
60|$|When {{the words}} Kenneth of Scotland {{announced}} {{the name and}} character of the champion, hitherto scarce generally known, a loud and cheerful acclaim burst from the followers of King Richard, and hardly, notwithstanding repeated commands of silence, suffered the reply of the defendant to be heard. He, of course, <b>avouched</b> his innocence, and offered his body for battle. The esquires of the combatants now approached, and delivered to each his shield and lance, assisting to hang the former around his neck, that his two hands might remain free, one {{for the management of}} the bridle, the other to direct the lance.|$|R
