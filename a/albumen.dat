5|$|Photographs of the 19th century often now {{show the}} {{limitations}} of the technology used, yet Felice Beato managed to successfully work within and even transcend those limitations. He predominantly produced <b>albumen</b> silver prints from wet collodion glass-plate negatives.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} other {{techniques}} developed in parallel {{with the use of}} daguerreotypes. The ambrotype, using collodium to produce a positive image on glass, and the pannotype, also collodium-based, were both used in Denmark from around 1855. Negative-based paper prints, used {{from the beginning of the}} 1850s, were produced on salt paper until around 1857 when salt was replaced by <b>albumen.</b> Collodion emulsion chloride paper was used from 1865 and in 1880 gelatin emulsion paper was introduced.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{innovations}} of Felice Beato and Baron Raimund von Stillfried, Farsari {{further developed the}} trade in photograph albums. His studio generally produced sepia monochrome <b>albumen</b> prints that were hand-coloured and mounted on album leaves. These pages were often hand decorated and bound between covers of silk brocade or lacquer boards inlaid with ivory, mother-of-pearl and gold. Like his contemporaries, Farsari usually captioned and numbered his photographs in the images, often in white lettering on a black background.|$|E
5|$|When Meessen {{returned}} to the Netherlands in 1870 he established a short-lived partnership with Abraham Vermeulen and began disseminating his photographs. Selected images were gifted to King William III in an elaborately decorated album in 1871, while more were published by De Bussy in 1875 and exhibited in Paris and Amsterdam. In his final years Meessen worked predominantly as an architect. Collections of his <b>albumen</b> prints, {{some of which were}} hand-tinted or annotated, are held in four institutions in the Netherlands.|$|E
5|$|During that period, the Batavia Society of Arts and Sciences, {{whose main}} {{interests}} were in archaeological research and conservation, {{became interested in}} the newly invented <b>albumen</b> print medium. The society felt that the world should know more about Javanese culture as expressed in the old inscriptions, statues, customs and temples. The Society arranged an archaeological tour around Java, headed by J.F.G. Brumund, a priest of the Batavian Evangelic Community and a specialist in Javanese. The Society also commissioned van Kinsbergen to accompany Brumund during his tour in order to illustrate Brumund's publication of Javanese culture and antiquities. The government granted permission for this tour, with the restriction that all wet-prints (cliches) would be government property and that extra printing would only be allowed with permission from the government.|$|E
25|$|Ovary {{is small}} (0.75 whorl), {{composed}} of simple, stalked lobes. It is slightly overlapping stomach anteriorly. Female glandular oviduct and associated structures are as follows: Coiled oviduct is narrow, vertical. Bursa copulatrix is small, ovate, horizontal, about 50% overlapped by <b>albumen</b> gland. Bursal duct {{is longer than}} bursa, narrow, opening from distal edge, partly embedded in <b>albumen</b> gland proximally, entirely embedded distally, junction with common duct well in front of posterior wall of pallial cavity. Seminal receptacle is small, pouch-like, positioned near ventral edge of <b>albumen</b> gland slightly anterior to bursa copulatrix. <b>Albumen</b> gland is largely visceral. Capsule gland composed of two distinct tissue sections. Genital aperture a terminal slit.|$|E
25|$|Reproductive system: the bursa copulatrix {{is partly}} {{surrounded}} by <b>albumen</b> gland (posterior pallial oviduct). <b>Albumen</b> gland and spermathecal duct {{have a common}} opening. Sperm duct and also spermathecal duct emerges from mid-ventral part of the bursa copulatrix.|$|E
25|$|If {{differs from}} Marstonia lustrica by its smaller {{prostate}} gland, smaller penial lobe, narrower penial filament, straight anterior vas deferens, partly imbedded (in <b>albumen</b> gland) bursal duct, and larger seminal receptacle.|$|E
25|$|It can be {{distinguished}} from Marstonia gaddisorum by its less convex shell whorls, distinctive pallial roof pigmentation, larger number of cusps {{on the inner side}} of the lateral teeth and on the outer marginal teeth, larger penial lobe, narrower terminal gland, and smaller overlap of the bursa copulatrix by the <b>albumen</b> gland.|$|E
25|$|The {{reproductive}} system is remarkable for extreme reduction of male organs {{and the absence}} of receptaculum seminis (spermatheca). The male organ (penis) is a short tube, and exhibits little difference from the vas deferens, except that it is slightly wider; the latter is a short tube not sharply marked off from the verge. The <b>albumen</b> gland is large.|$|E
25|$|Works in {{this section}} {{included}} Oscar E. Berninghaus’ A Showery Day, Grand Canyon (1915), Andrew Joseph Russell’s, Temporary and Permanent Bridges and Citadel Rock, Green River (1868) <b>Albumen</b> print, Thomas Moran's, The Chasm of the Colorado (1983–84), Albert Bierstadt’s Donner Lake from the Summit (1873), as well as commercial landscapes and advertising images by unidentified artists, entitled Splendid (1935) and Desert Bloom (1938).|$|E
25|$|Very thin {{strands of}} <b>albumen</b> could be soft and fine {{enough to allow}} the {{trapdoor}} to close completely; these would not be drawn in any further unless the trigger hairs were indeed stimulated again. On the other hand, a human hair, finer still but relatively hard and unyielding, could prevent a seal being formed; these would prevent the trap from resetting at all due to leakage of water.|$|E
25|$|Eggs {{are laid}} by female animals of many {{different}} species, including birds, reptiles, amphibians, mammals, and fish, and have been eaten by humans for thousands of years. Bird and reptile eggs consist of a protective eggshell, <b>albumen</b> (egg white), and vitellus (egg yolk), contained within various thin membranes. The most commonly consumed eggs are chicken eggs. Other poultry eggs including those of duck and quail are also eaten. Fish eggs are called roe and caviar.|$|E
25|$|In the March 1851 {{issue of}} The Chemist, Frederick Scott Archer {{published}} his wet plate collodion process. It {{became the most}} widely used photographic medium until the gelatin dry plate, introduced in the 1870s, eventually replaced it. There are three subsets to the collodion process; the Ambrotype (a positive image on glass), the Ferrotype or Tintype (a positive image on metal) and the glass negative, which was used to make positive prints on <b>albumen</b> or salted paper.|$|E
25|$|The Yoreh De'ah {{argues that}} if there is blood in the egg yolk, then {{hatching}} must have begun, and therefore consumption of the egg would be forbidden. Modern Orthodox Jews adhere to these requirements; however, the Ashkenazi Orthodox Jews treat an egg as nonkosher if blood is found anywhere within it. Sephardi Orthodox Jews consider only blood in the yolk to be a problem, and treat eggs with blood in the <b>albumen</b> as legitimate food if the blood is removed before use.|$|E
25|$|Cataracts {{have been}} {{associated}} with ionizing radiation such as X-rays. The addition of damage to the DNA of the lens cells has been considered. Finally, electric and heat injuries denature and whiten the lens as a result of direct protein coagulation. This same process makes the clear <b>albumen</b> of an egg become white and opaque during cooking. Cataracts of this type are often seen in glassblowers and furnace workers. Lasers of sufficient power output are known to damage the eyes and skin.|$|E
25|$|A Cadbury Creme Egg is a {{chocolate}} product {{produced in the}} shape of an egg. The product consists of a thick chocolate shell, housing a white and orange fondant filling which mimics the <b>albumen</b> and yolk of a chicken egg. The Creme Eggs are the best selling confectionery item between New Year's Day and Easter in the UK, with annual sales in excess of 200 million and a brand value of approximately £55 million. However, in 2016 sales plummeted after the controversial decision to change the recipe from the original Dairy Milk chocolate to a cheaper substitute, with reports of a loss of more than £6m in sales.|$|E
25|$|At first Ueno practiced wet-plate photography, but {{by about}} 1877 he began using {{imported}} Belgian dry plates. In {{spite of the}} contemporary popularity of hand-coloured photographs, Ueno's photographs are usually uncoloured. Some of Ueno's negatives were probably purchased at some point by the photographer Kusakabe Kimbei, as these images appear in the latter's albums. Though he apparently did not regularly offer photograph albums, {{he seems to have}} made some albums by special request for foreign customers. Ueno considered French and American photographic techniques and materials (for example, paper and lenses) to be superior to those of the British, whose products he also complained were overpriced, noting that <b>albumen</b> paper sold (c. 1868) for 100 ryō per box.|$|E
25|$|Reproductive system: The {{hermaphrodite}} gland (HG) is elongated and large, and {{is connected}} with spermoviduct (SO) {{by means of the}} hermaphrodite duct (HD) which takes its course through a portion of the <b>albumen</b> gland (AG). The spermoviduct is thick and well convoluted, and separates further down into a vas deferens or sperm-duct (VD) and an oviduct (OV). The former opens into the upper end of a very long penis (P), to which a strong retractor muscle (PRM) is attached. The lower portion of the penis unites with that of the oviduct at the genital orifice, so that there is no vestibule. The receptaculum seminis (RS) opens into {{the lower end of the}} penis near the junction of the two ducts.|$|E
500|$|Isidore van Kinsbergen {{was born}} in Bruges in 1821 (at that time, Bruges {{was part of the}} United Kingdom of the Netherlands). Having studied {{painting}} and singing in Paris, he joined a French opera group that travelled to Batavia (the present day Jakarta) in 1851. After several performances the group left the Dutch East Indies, but Van Kinsbergen decided to stay there. [...] He became interested in the new medium of photography, particularly in using the <b>albumen</b> print technique. He opened the first <b>albumen</b> print processing shop in Batavia.|$|E
500|$|Bird {{used his}} {{position}} {{as head of the}} department of electricity and galvanism to further his research efforts and to aid him in teaching his students. [...] He was interested in electrolysis and repeated the experiments of Antoine César Becquerel, Edmund Davy and others to extract metals in this way. [...] He was particularly interested in the possibility of detecting low levels of heavy metal poisons with this technique, pioneered by Davy. [...] Bird also studied the properties of <b>albumen</b> under electrolysis, finding that the <b>albumen</b> coagulated at the anode because hydrochloric acid was produced there. [...] He corrected an earlier erroneous conclusion by W. T. Brande that high electric current caused coagulation at the cathode also, showing that this was entirely due to fluid flows caused by the strong electric field.|$|E
500|$|Desbouvrie {{received}} {{international attention}} in the press for two unrelated reasons: the bird experiments, and also for a proposal he made to the Paris Academy of Medicine. [...] The Academy published his paper, which declared chronic alcoholism {{to be a serious}} public health problem and offered a solution {{in the form of a}} claimed cure for hangovers. [...] Desbouvrie hypothesized that the consumption of food which contained an appropriate balance of fat and <b>albumen</b> would prevent hangovers from occurring. [...] He sent the Academy a selection of homemade chocolates along with his manuscript, with assurances that he had tested the concoction extensively upon himself.|$|E
500|$|Also defined herewith: eggshell, yolk, albumen; chalaza. The organic vessel {{containing}} the zygote, in which birds develop until hatching. Eggs are usually oval in shape, {{and have a}} base white colour from the predominant calcium carbonate makeup of the outer shell, called the eggshell, though [...] birds especially may have eggs of other colours, such as through deposition of biliverdin and its zinc chelate, which give a green or blue ground colour, and protoporphyrin which produces reds and browns. A viable bird egg (as opposed to a non-viable egg: see [...] ) consists {{of a number of}} structures. The eggshell is 95–97% calcium carbonate crystals, at least in chickens, stabilized by a protein matrix, without which the crystalline structure would be too brittle to keep its form; the organic matrix is thought to have a role in deposition of calcium during the mineralization process. The structure and composition of the avian eggshell serves to protect the egg against damage and microbial contamination, prevention of desiccation, regulation of gas and water exchange for the growing embryo, and provides calcium for embryogenesis. Inside the eggshell are two shell membranes (inner and outer), and at the center is a yolk—a spherical structure, usually some shade of yellow, to which the fertilized gamete attaches and which the embryonic bird uses as sustenance as it grows. The yolk is suspended in the <b>albumen</b> (also called egg white or glair/glaire) by one or two spiral bands of tissue called the chalazae. The <b>albumen</b> protects the yolk and provides additional nutrition for the embryo's growth, though it is made up of approximately 90% water in most birds. Prior to fertilization, the yolk is a single cell ovum or egg cell; one of the few single cells that can be seen by the naked eye.|$|E
500|$|In 1888 the Bulletin de l'academie de {{medicine}} (Bulletin of the Academy of Medicine) {{published a}} report that Desbouvrie had sent them a manuscript and requested verification of an invention {{he claimed to have}} made. [...] He called {{it was a matter of}} public health to counter the effects of chronic alcoholism. [...] According to the report, which was republished in English in summary form in the Medical Record and the Cincinnati Lancet-clinic, Desbouvrie had attempted a preventive cure for hangovers. Desbouvrie asserted that the cure required eating <b>albumen</b> and fat in appropriate proportions one hour before alcohol consumption, and had invented a chocolate which he claimed contained both ingredients in an effective ratio. He provided samples to the Academy and assured its members he had tested the cure upon himself.|$|E
500|$|Altogether, Meessen's {{photographic}} {{ventures in}} the Indies {{and the resulting}} albums cost some 34,000Netherlands Indies gulden, which included camera equipment (though {{it is not known}} what model(s) he used), chemicals, transportation, and accommodations. Meessen worked alone, never taking a partner while in the Indies, and documented the land and people in the colony in his <b>albumen</b> prints. In his ethnographic photography of the indigenous peoples of the Indies, he often had to overcome superstitions which, the Bataviaasch Handelsblad wrote, [...] "made taking images of the people outside Java almost impossible". Others were more enthusiastic, including the villagers of Nias: [...] "Upon arrival I fired a few shots and flew the Dutch flag. Soon the villagers came and asked what I wanted. Once I told them, they promised their assistance. At exactly 5a.m. the following morning I found some 60warriors waiting for me on the beach." ...|$|E
500|$|On {{his arrival}} in Japan, Rossier presumably {{introduced}} himself as a photographer despatched to Japan by Negretti and Zambra, perhaps thereby inspiring a misconception, for while he remained in the country he was {{often referred to as}} an [...] "English" [...] photographer. In Nagasaki, Rossier was assisted in his work by Maeda Genzō, who had been instructed to accompany the [...] "Englishman" [...] and to further learn photography. With Maeda and other students escorting him around the city, Rossier took photographs of priests, beggars, the audience of a sumo match, the foreign settlement, and the group portrait of Alexander von Siebold and samurai. Rossier believed that Pompe van Meerdervoort's failures in photography were {{due to a lack of}} the necessary chemicals and so he provided Maeda with a letter of recommendation to procure photographic apparatus and chemicals from a source in Shanghai. Both Maeda and Furukawa bought lenses, chemicals and <b>albumen</b> paper through Rossier.|$|E
500|$|Adult {{macaroni}} penguins typically {{begin to}} breed late in October, and {{lay their eggs}} in early November. The nest itself is a shallow scrape in the ground which may be lined with some pebbles, stones, or grass, or nestled in a clump of tussock grass (on South Georgia Island). Nests are densely packed, ranging from around 66cm apart {{in the middle of}} a colony to 86cm at the edges. A fertile macaroni penguin will lay two eggs each breeding season. The first egg to be laid weighs , 61–64% the size of the [...] second, and is extremely unlikely to survive. The two eggs together weigh 4.8% of the mother's body weight; the composition of an egg is 20% yolk, 66% <b>albumen,</b> and 14% shell. Like those of other penguin species, the shell is relatively thick to minimise risk of breakage, and the yolk is large, which is associated with chicks born in an advanced stage of development. Some of the yolk remains at hatching and is consumed by the chick in its first few days.|$|E
500|$|The sperm from a mating {{is stored}} by the female and can suffice to {{fertilise}} about six eggs. The pair mate every day or two, and every {{second or third}} day the female lays one of a clutch of five to fifteen very large, thick-shelled, green eggs. The shell is around [...] thick, but rather thinner in northern regions according to indigenous Australians. The eggs are on average [...] and weigh between [...] The maternal investment in the egg is considerable, {{and the proportion of}} yolk to <b>albumen,</b> at about 50%, is greater than would be predicted for a precocial egg of this size. This probably relates to the long incubation period which means the developing chick must consume greater resources before hatching. The first verified occurrence of genetically identical avian twins was demonstrated in the emu. The egg surface is granulated and pale green. During the incubation period, the egg turns dark green, although if the egg never hatches, it will turn white from the bleaching effect of the sun.|$|E

When caught by one end, the strand would gradually be drawn in, sometimes in sudden jumps, {{and at other times}} by a slow and continuous motion. [...] Strands of <b>albumen</b> would often be fully ingested in as little as twenty minutes.|$|E

2500|$|Proteins were {{recognized}} as a distinct class of biological molecules {{in the eighteenth century}} by Antoine Fourcroy and others. [...] Members of this class (called the [...] "albuminoids", Eiweisskörper, or matières albuminoides) {{were recognized}} by their ability to coagulate or flocculate under various treatments such as heat or acid; well-known examples {{at the start of the}} nineteenth century included <b>albumen</b> from egg whites, blood serum albumin, fibrin, and wheat gluten. The similarity between the cooking of egg whites and the curdling of milk was recognized even in ancient times; for example, the name <b>albumen</b> for the egg-white protein was coined by Pliny the Elder from the Latin albus ovi (egg white).|$|E
2500|$|In 1866, [...] "Lincoln's {{favorite}} photographer" [...] {{published his}} two-volume anthology, Gardner's Photographic Sketch Book of the War. Two editions {{were published in}} 1865 an 1866, consisting of two leather-bound volumes. Each volume contained 50 tipped-in, imperial size <b>albumen</b> prints, with an accompanying page of descriptive, letterpress. However, at $150 per set, {{it was not the}} success Gardner had hoped. When asked about his work he said, [...] "It is designed to speak for itself [...] [...] As mementos of the fearful struggle through which the country has just passed, it is confidently hoped that it will possess an enduring interest." ...|$|E
2500|$|Originally, all {{photography}} was monochrome, or black-and-white. Even after {{color film}} was readily available, black-and-white photography continued to dominate for decades, {{due to its}} lower cost and its [...] "classic" [...] photographic look. The tones and contrast between light and dark areas define black-and-white photography. It {{is important to note}} that monochromatic pictures are not necessarily composed of pure blacks, whites, and intermediate shades of gray but can involve shades of one particular hue depending on the process. The cyanotype process, for example, produces an image composed of blue tones. The <b>albumen</b> print process first used more than [...] years ago, produces brownish tones.|$|E
