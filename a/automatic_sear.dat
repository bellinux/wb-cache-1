50|$|In Receiver, players must {{search for}} eleven audio tapes from around a procedurally {{generated}} world, randomly arranged after each death. Ammunition and flashlights are {{scattered throughout the}} world as well. Players start with a random handgun, either a Smith & Wesson Model 10 revolver, a Colt M1911A1 semi-automatic pistol, or a selective fire Glock 17 pistol with an <b>automatic</b> <b>sear.</b> Players are also given a random inventory of ammunition and/or spare magazines for their weapon. Players may also start with a flashlight. While searching for tapes, the player will encounter stationary sentry turrets and mobile hover drones that will attack the player. A single hit to the player will kill them. Shooting these automated defenses can disable them, with shots to vital components, such as cameras, weapons, motor, or battery scoring significantly more damage. If a player dies, they lose all progress and the game is reset with a new randomly-generated level layout, spawn position, and inventory.|$|E
5000|$|The FG 42 {{fired in}} {{semi-automatic}} mode from a closed bolt, accomplished by delaying {{the release of}} the firing pin (mounted on the bolt carrier and released by the front sear notch) until after the trigger had been pressed; the short lock time, and little movement in the action during firing translated into greater single-shot accuracy. When operating in the <b>automatic</b> mode, the <b>sear</b> mechanism was designed to fire from an open bolt by simultaneously releasing both the bolt and bolt carrier. This had the advantage of preventing a phenomenon known as [...] "cook off" [...] where the heat of repeated rounds being fired caused a chambered round to overheat and prematurely ignite the powder or primer. With automatic fire selected, the bolt would remain open between bursts to provide maximum cooling. The rotating fire selector switch was situated in the trigger group, above the pistol grip on the right side. The charge lever also served as the safety, disabling the sear mechanism when engaged.|$|R
