5|$|At {{first he}} took soft clay in his bill {{from the edge}} of the water <b>and</b> <b>seemed</b> to be {{smearing}} it on one leg near the knee. Then he fluttered away on one foot for a short distance <b>and</b> <b>seemed</b> to be pulling tiny roots and fibers of grass, which he worked into the clay that he had already smeared on his leg. Again he took some clay and plastered it over the fibers, putting on more and more till I could plainly see the enlargement, working away with strange, silent intentness for fully fifteen minutes, while I watched and wondered, scarce believing my eyes. Then he stood perfectly still for a full hour under an overhanging sod, where the eye could with difficulty find him, his only motion meanwhile being an occasional rubbing and smoothing of the clay bandage with his bill, until it hardened enough to suit him, whereupon he fluttered away from the brook and disappeared in the thick woods.|$|E
5|$|By careful examination, the {{luminosity}} {{was found}} to proceed from the gills and not the stipe, nor from any fragment of rotten wood attached to the specimen. This phosphoresence was not observed in all specimens brought in for examination, <b>and</b> <b>seemed</b> to depend on some peculiar condition of the air, having been noticed only in specimens gathered in damp weather or just before a storm.|$|E

His most useful ability is being able to {{transfer}} one of his nine lives to someone who has died, resurrecting them in perfect health. He seems particularly fond of Ryunosuke <b>and</b> <b>seems</b> to want the young man to be happy.|$|R
5|$|In 6BC, on {{the verge}} of {{accepting}} command in the East and becoming the second most powerful man in Rome, Tiberius suddenly announced his withdrawal from politics and retired to Rhodes. The precise motives for Tiberius's withdrawal are unclear. Historians have speculated a connection with the fact that Augustus had adopted Julia's sons by Agrippa Gaius and Lucius, <b>and</b> <b>seemed</b> to be moving them along the same political path that both Tiberius and Drusus had trodden.|$|E
5|$|A farmworker heard Jeremy leave around 9:30 pm. Barbara Wilson, the farm's secretary, telephoned Nevill {{at around}} that time, and {{was left with}} the {{impression}} that she had interrupted an argument. She said he was short with her <b>and</b> <b>seemed</b> to hang up in irritation, something he had never done before; he was by all accounts an even-tempered man. June Bamber's sister, Pamela Boutflour, telephoned around 10 pm. She spoke to Sheila, who she said was quiet, then to June, who seemed normal.|$|E
5|$|Bamber {{told the}} police that Sheila was {{familiar}} with guns {{and that they had}} gone target shooting together. He said he had been at the farmhouse himself a few hours earlier, and that he had loaded the rifle because he thought he had heard rabbits outside. He had left it on the kitchen table fully loaded, with a box of ammunition nearby. After the bodies were discovered, a Dr. Craig, was called to the house to certify the deaths, which he testified could have occurred {{at any time during the}} night. He said Bamber appeared to be in a state of shock; Bamber broke down, cried <b>and</b> <b>seemed</b> to vomit. The doctor said Bamber told him about the discussion the family had had about possibly having Sheila's sons placed in foster care.|$|E

5|$|Bengaluru FC began 2014–15 {{season with}} the Federation Cup and won the {{domestic}} cup competition for the first time. Club captain Sunil Chhetri ended the tournament as joint top scorer. Bengaluru FC began their I-League campaign as defending champions <b>and</b> <b>seemed</b> on track to defend the title until the dying minutes of the last {{game of the season}} against Mohun Bagan. The Kolkata side scored the equalizing goal in the 87th minute of the 1–1 match which was enough to secure their first league title. Bengaluru FC also participated in Asian club competition for the first time. Although they were defeated in the qualifiers for the AFC Champions League, they reached the Round of 16 in the AFC Cup. Defeat to South China meant that their first Asian campaign ended there.|$|E
5|$|By 1972, McBride {{had made}} {{his way through the}} minor leagues to the Cardinals' Class AA {{affiliate}} in Little Rock. Though he was successful there and he received a promotion to the Class AAA team in Tulsa, he was initially hesitant to report there, wondering whether he was ready for Class AAA baseball. In his first at bat at the Class AAA level, McBride hit a ball off of the outfield wall <b>and</b> <b>seemed</b> to collect a triple, but he was called out for failing to touch second base.|$|E
5|$|Classified as a 2.5 point player, Lindholm plays power forward. She {{was part}} of the team that won the European Championships in Nazareth, Israel, in 2011, thereby {{qualifying}} for the 2012 Summer Paralympic Games in London. As part of the team's preparation, they toured the United States and Australia. The German team went through the group stage undefeated, but started off slow in its games against the United States and China, winning these games by six-point margins, <b>and</b> <b>seemed</b> to play its best basketball only in the final minutes of a game.|$|E

5|$|Green was {{released}} from the police station in the early morning of October 24 after questioning. With the family home burned down, she had nowhere to stay. Farrar refused to let her stay in his apartment, but gave her some cash, and she rented a room in a local hotel. Ellen Ryan, Green's divorce lawyer, found her there later in the day in a distraught state. She repeatedly asked Ryan whether her children had died, chanted rhythmically about their deaths, <b>and</b> <b>seemed</b> unable to care for herself. Green was transported to a local hospital for treatment but remained emotionally unstable, suffering from insomnia and appearing to Ryan to be unable to take care of day-to-day life, even after her release from the hospital.|$|E
5|$|Hügel-Marshall {{continued}} {{to study and}} achieved a license in child education and welfare. She then found work in a children's home in Frankfurt am Main, where she worked for twelve years. The home {{reminded her of the}} degrading orphanage she had been sent to <b>and</b> <b>seemed</b> more like a detention center than a school. Working with the other teachers, and over the opposition of the school's management, she was able to make substantial changes and to modernize it during her time there. While working there, she completed a degree in social work and pedagogy.|$|E
5|$|In {{order to}} protect the Big Bend region, the United States {{deployed}} a number of cavalry and signalmen in various posts along the Texas border. One of these posts was at the village of Ojo de Agua which had been raided on September 3, 1915 and was the planned target of a Seditionista raid in October 1916. The American base at Ojo de Agua under the command of Sergeant Ernest Schaeffer consisted of a radio station manned by approximately ten men from Troop G, 3rd Cavalry, and eight men of the United States Army Signal Corps. The post at Ojo de Agua was lightly defended <b>and</b> <b>seemed</b> to be little match for the 25 to 100 raiders that planned to raid the village.|$|E

5|$|In {{the first}} Test of the 2009 Ashes at the SWALEC Stadium in Cardiff, Collingwood scored 64 {{in the first}} innings as England totalled 435. On a flat wicket, however, this was put into context by the Australians, who amassed 674 for 6 declared, with four centurions; Collingwood bowled nine overs, and claimed the wicket of Brad Haddin caught at deep midwicket. In reply, England slid to 70 for 5 <b>and</b> <b>seemed</b> certain to succumb to an innings defeat. In response, Collingwood stayed at the crease for 5¾ hours (nearly {{the whole of the}} final day) and top-scored for England with 74 runs from 245 balls. He was ninth man out, edging Peter Siddle to gully, but final pair James Anderson and Monty Panesar blocked out the final 11½ overs of the match to secure an {{improbable}} draw.|$|E
5|$|In {{the fourth}} stage, Aucouturier {{had a clear}} lead <b>and</b> <b>seemed</b> set to win a third {{successive}} stage, but was caught using the slipstream of a car, and {{was removed from the}} race. Swiss Charles Laeser (who had abandoned in the 3rd stage) took the victory, becoming the first non-French winner. As in the third stage, the cyclists departed in two groups, and Laeser was in the second group because he was no longer contending for the general classification. Laeser finished more than 50 minutes after a group of six cyclists, but he had travelled the distance 4 minutes faster than them, so he was declared the winner.|$|E
5|$|Originally a Danish prince, George {{was born}} in Copenhagen, <b>and</b> <b>seemed</b> destined {{for a career in}} the Royal Danish Navy. He was only 17 years old when he was elected king by the Greek National Assembly, which had deposed the unpopular former king Otto. His {{nomination}} was both suggested and supported by the Great Powers: the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, the Second French Empire and the Russian Empire. He married the Russian grand duchess Olga Constantinovna of Russia, and became the first monarch of a new Greek dynasty. Two of his sisters, Alexandra and Dagmar, married into the British and Russian royal families. King Edward VII and Tsar Alexander III were his brothers-in-law and King George V and Tsar Nicholas II were his nephews.|$|E

5|$|The Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA, today {{known as}} DARPA) {{was formed in}} 1958 by President Dwight Eisenhower's Secretary of Defense, Neil McElroy, in {{reaction}} to Soviet rocketry advances. US efforts had suffered from massive duplication of effort between the Army, Air Force, and Navy, <b>and</b> <b>seemed</b> to be accomplishing little {{in comparison to the}} Soviets. ARPA was initially handed the mission of overseeing all of these efforts. As the problems with Zeus became clear, McElroy also asked ARPA to consider the antimissile problem and come up with other solutions. The resulting Project Defender was extremely broad in scope, considering everything from minor Zeus system upgrades to far-out concepts like antigravity and the recently invented laser.|$|E
5|$|The German {{team had}} been undefeated {{up to that}} point, but had started off slow in its games against the United States and China, winning these games by six-point margins, <b>and</b> <b>seemed</b> to play its best {{basketball}} only in the final minutes of a game. They defeated the Australians 44–58 {{in front of a}} crowd of over 12,000 at the North Greenwich Arena to win the gold medal, the first that Germany had won in women's wheelchair basketball since 1984. They were awarded Germany's highest sporting honour, the Silbernes Lorbeerblatt (Silver Laurel Leaf) by President Joachim Gauck in November 2012, and were named Team of the Year for 2012.|$|E
5|$|United were unbeaten {{from their}} first 10 league games of the 1985–86 campaign, and unbeaten {{from their first}} 15, <b>and</b> <b>seemed</b> destined to win the First Division title. However they dropped off in mid-season and won just six of their final 18 games to end the season in fourth place, 12 points behind champions Liverpool. The press blamed the decline in form on the club's {{drinking}} culture and Ron Atkinson's lax disciplinary attitude, though in his autobiography Whiteside denies that this was to blame, and states that stories of the player's drinking sessions were exaggerated.|$|E
