5|$|As per Tulsidas, Rama is the {{efficient}} and material cause (Nimitta and Upadana) of the world, which is real since Rama is real. In several verses of the Ramcharitmanas, Tulsidas {{says that the}} animate and inanimate world is a manifestation of Rama, and the universe is the cosmic form of Rama. Authors interpret these verses to mean {{that the world is}} real according to Tulsidas, in keeping with the Vishishtadvaita philosophy of Ramanuja. However, at some places in the Ramcharitmanas and Kavitavali, Tulsidas compares the world to <b>a</b> <b>night</b> <b>or</b> a dream and says it is Mithya (false or unreal). Some commentators interpret these verses to mean that in Tulsidas' opinion the world is unreal as per the Vivartavada doctrine of Adi Shankara, while some others interpret them to mean that the world is transient yet real as per the Satkhyativada doctrine of Ramananda. Uday Bhanu Singh concludes that in Tulsidas' view, the world is essentially the form of Rama and appears to be different from Rama due to Maya. Its visible form is transient, which is what Tulsidas means by Mithya.|$|E

25|$|Most {{children}} who leave home {{to live on}} the streets come from slums or low cost housing, both which are areas of high illiteracy, drug use, and unemployment.

25|$|The tribe went on buffalo hunts {{in summer}} and winter.

25|$|While {{ancestor}} veneration is {{an ancient}} part of Filipino culture, the modern observance {{is believed to have}} been imported from Mexico when the islands (as part of the Spanish East Indies) were governed from Mexico City as part of the Viceroyalty of New Spain. During the holiday (observed every November 1), Filipinos customarily visit family tombs and other graves, which they repair and clean. Entire families spend <b>a</b> <b>night</b> <b>or</b> two at their loved ones' tombs, passing time with card games, eating, drinking, singing and dancing. Prayers such as the rosary are often said for the deceased, who are normally offered candles, flowers, food, and even liquor. Some Catholic Chinese Filipino families additionally offer joss sticks to the dead, and observe customs otherwise associated with the Hungry Ghost Festival.|$|E
500|$|Robert Copsey of Digital Spy {{described}} the song as a [...] "hefty slab of dramatic rock {{which includes the}} band's trademark electric guitars with melodic choruses". In another review, he awarded the song four stars out of five stating [...] "electro it certainly ain't, but the result is as dancefloor-friendly as it is mosh pit-ready." [...] He further praised the [...] "catchy-as-cholera" [...] chorus and gave a mixed review about the lyrics and the title saying [...] "fortunately their words {{seemed to have been}} a touch overzealous; though it's clear from the trailer for the group's third album that they've been spending <b>a</b> <b>night</b> <b>or</b> two on the tiles." [...] Lewis Corner of the same publication concluded: [...] "'What You Want' proved... the band's melodious rock sensibilities remain firmly in tact". Tamar Anitai of MTV, Theon Weber of Spin, Stephen Thomas Erlewine of Allmusic and Edna Gundersen of USA Today chose the song as an album highlight. Entertainment Weeklys Kyle Anderson also chose it as a highlight, further describing it as [...] "fierce". Los Angeles Times Mikael Wood wrote that [...] "'What You Want' rides its central riff with a bulldozer's efficiency." [...] Marc Hirsh of The Boston Globe found a [...] "metallic lurch playing off of Lee's goth-empress vocals" [...] in the song. Hirsh went on to call the song a [...] "strong declaration" [...] announcing the band's comeback.|$|E

2500|$|The return {{journey was}} very {{different}} from coming down in a hospital train as a draft usually travelled at night, in practically open trucks with about 35 men packed into each truck including all their kits, rifles, 48 hours' rations, and a loaded bandolier.

From there they would be despatched in motor lorries down the hill to Jericho, where led horses would be sent in some miles, from the brigade bivouac, to meet them and carry them back to their units.|$|E
