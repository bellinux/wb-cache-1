40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{present the}} legal and {{professional}} issues related to nurse administration of drugs <b>according</b> <b>to</b> <b>protocols,</b> and describe the implementation and initial audit findings of such a scheme. SETTING: Accident and emergency (A&E) department of a district general hospital. METHODS: Analysis of legal and professional opinion. Protocols acceptable to the medical, nursing, and pharmacy professions were developed across {{a wide range of}} drugs appropriate for administration by accident and emergency nurse practitioners (ENPs). The {{first six months of the}} scheme were audited. Audit initially addressed general compliance with protocols and later the specific areas of tetanus immunisation and emergency contraception. RESULTS: ENPs assessed 2925 patients in six months (10. 9 % of all new patients); 455 patients (15. 5 % of the ENP patients) were given drugs <b>according</b> <b>to</b> <b>protocols.</b> There were no breaches of the protocols. Subsequent audit of tetanus immunisation showed 94 - 100 % compliance with protocol standards and 71 - 100 % compliance for emergency contraception. CONCLUSIONS: There are no legal or professional obstacles to the development of protocols for the administration of drugs to patients by nurses without reference to a doctor, providing the protocols meet all the requirements of the UKCC and have the support of consultant medical staff. Such a system must be subject to regular audit to promote a dynamic approach to protocols and training. The system safely enhanced the quality of care of patients treated by ENPs in A&E...|$|E

40|$|Implementation of {{advanced}} radiation therapy techniques in clinical practice can greatly improve tumour control and normal tissue sparing. An {{important part of}} this implementation is quality control (QC) of every part of the radiotherapy process, as it helps to detect errors and provides instant remedy. This increases the probability of successful radiation treatment and ensures patient radiation safety. Every radiotherapy quality assurance (QA) programme is based on quality control of radiotherapy equipment. The aim of our survey was to review QC practices in a number of radiotherapy centres in Croatia. As a fi rst step, we defi ned a set of tests to check different parameters of linear accelerators and simulators in these centres. The tests were defi ned and performed <b>according</b> <b>to</b> <b>protocols</b> developed at two university hospitals. Test results varied largely between the centres.

40|$|We {{describe}} an implementation of session types in Haskell. Session types statically enforce that client-server communication proceeds <b>according</b> <b>to</b> <b>protocols.</b> They {{have been added}} to several concurrent calculi, but few implementations of session types are available. Our embedding takes advantage of Haskell where appropriate, but we rely on no exotic features. Thus our approach translates with minimal modification to other polymorphic, typed languages such as ML and Java. Our implementation works with existing Haskell concurrency mechanisms, handles multiple communication channels and recursive session types, and infers protocols automatically. While our implementation uses unsafe operations in Haskell, it does not violate Haskell’s safety guarantees. We formalize this claim in a concurrent calculus with unsafe communication primitives over which we layer our implementation of session types, and we prove that the session types layer is safe. In particular, it enforces that channel-based communication follows consistent protocols...|$|E
