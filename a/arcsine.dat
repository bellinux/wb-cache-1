[...] See Shapes section in this article for a full list of mode cases, for arbitrary values of α and β. For several of these cases, the maximum value of the density function occurs at one or both ends. [...] In some cases the (maximum) value of the density function occurring at the end is finite. For example, in the case of α = 2, β = 1 (or α = 1, β = 2), the density function becomes a right-triangle distribution which is finite at both ends. In several other cases there is a singularity at one end, where the value of the density function approaches infinity. For example, in the case α = β = 1/2, the Beta distribution simplifies to become the <b>arcsine</b> distribution.

2500|$|While for typical {{unimodal}} distributions (with {{centrally located}} modes, inflexion points at {{both sides of}} the mode, and longer tails) (with Beta(α,β) such that [...] ) it is known that the sample mean (as an estimate of location) is not as robust as the sample median, the opposite is the case for uniform or [...] "U-shaped" [...] bimodal distributions (with Beta(α,β) such that [...] ), with the modes located at the ends of the distribution. [...] As Mosteller and Tukey remark ( [...] p.207) [...] "the average of the two extreme observations uses all the sample information. This illustrates how, for short-tailed distributions, the extreme observations should get more weight." [...] By contrast, it follows that the median of [...] "U-shaped" [...] bimodal distributions with modes {{at the edge of the}} distribution (with Beta(α,β) such that [...] ) is not robust, as the sample median drops the extreme sample observations from consideration. [...] A practical application of this occurs for example for random walks, since the probability for the time of the last visit to the origin in a random walk is distributed as the <b>arcsine</b> distribution Beta(1/2,1/2): the mean of a number of realizations of a random walk is a much more robust estimator than the median (which is an inappropriate sample measure estimate in this case).|$|E
