5|$|On August 19, 1864, {{with his}} {{remaining}} guerrillas facing serious supply problems and suffering from hunger, Định was betrayed {{by a former}} follower and ambushed by French forces. Wounded and facing imminent capture, Định committed suicide. His 20-year-old son Truong Quyen (1840–1870), attempted with modest success to carry on his father's struggle. A new base {{was set up in}} Tây Ninh. It allowed more room for tactical manoeuvring but still depended on supplies being carried north from Tan Hoa. Quyen was eventually killed and in 1874, long after the southern insurgency had been crushed, Tự Đức granted a monthly <b>allowance</b> <b>in</b> <b>grain</b> and cash to Định's widow Le Thi Thuong, who had returned to her native village in Quảng Ngãi, which at the time was still in independent Vietnamese territory. The ration of 20 francs and 60 litres of rice was substantial, because the monthly salary of a ninth-rank mandarin was only 18 francs and 48 litres of rice.|$|E

40|$|We {{examine the}} roles of {{slotting}} and renewal <b>allowances</b> <b>in</b> the allocation of scarce retail shelf space. Several contrasting features of the two shelf allocational mechanisms are shown. With slotting allowances, manufacturers can signal the profitability of new products and retailers can screen out the least profitable products. With re-newal <b>allowances</b> <b>in</b> a full information context, manufacturers can induce retailers to carry their less profitable products, illustrating a "push " ap-proach to attaining shelf placement: manufacturers of product that enjoy strong consumer "pull * obtain shelf placement without paying renewal <b>allowances.</b> <b>In</b> both cases, product proliferation results in higher slotting and renewal allowances by raising the opportunity cost of shelf space. However, as countervailing leverage against retailers, manufacturers of successful product lines can use their successful products to help attain placement for their relatively weak products...|$|R
