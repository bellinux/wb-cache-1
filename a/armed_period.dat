40|$|This thesis aims {{to provide}} better {{understanding}} of mass loss and outflows from asymptotic giant branch stars using the Bowen code. There are 3 projects involved in this thesis. The main project presented here is on the morphology of the outflow when disturbed by a super Jupiter size companion. There exists resonant modes between the pulsation period and orbital period. At different resonant modes, multiple spiral arms with different spiral <b>arm</b> <b>periods</b> form in the outflows. A simple formula gives the spiral <b>arm</b> <b>period</b> {{as a function of}} pulsation and orbital periods. Since the resonant modes appear in close orbits, the decay time scale and spiral arm morphology are also presented. These results may explain asymmetry in the outflows that form planetary nebulae. It also explains the origin of the spiral arm structure around some late AGB stars. A 3 -D code will ultimately be need to resolve some questions unanswered by the current 1 -D models. The paper on the outflow morphology has been submitted to ApJ. In this thesis, ongoing mass loss studies using the Bowen code are also briefly explained. I generated a large grid of models with varying mass, luminosity, metallicity, mixing length and Bowen model parameters in order to find correlations between the mass loss rate and these parameters. Since dust abundance is an important factor for mass loss, for the third project I tested dust formation in the refrigeration zone which is closer to the photosphere than normal dusty regions. In this test, I assumed that the dust temperature equals to the gas kinetic temperature which is lower than the radiative equilibrium temperature. Since dust temperature is close to the radiative temperature when the dust grain is large, this assumption brings excessive dust into the refrigeration zones. The detailed treatment of dust formation will be refined in future studies...|$|R

40|$|We {{investigate}} a stochastic multi-armed bandit problem {{in which the}} forecaster’s choice is restricted.

We extend the application ranges of these algorithms by proposing their natural conversion from ones for the stochastic bandit problem (index-based algorithms and greedy algorithms) to ones for the multi-armed bandit problem with lock-up periods. We prove that the regret of the converted algorithms is O(log T +Lmax), where T is the total number of rounds and Lmax is the maximum size of the lock-up periods. The regret is preferable, except for the case when the maximum size of the lock-up periods is large. For these cases, we propose a meta-algorithm that results in a smaller regret by using a empirical best <b>arm</b> for large <b>periods.</b> We empirically compare and discuss these algorithms...|$|R

40|$|Circadian rhythms are 24 -hour {{fluctuations}} in physiology and behavior that {{are driven by}} the oscillatory expression of positive arm (Clock, Bmal 1) and negative <b>arm</b> (<b>Period,</b> Per; Cryptochrome, Cry) core clock genes. Glucocorticoid hormone (CORT) circulation exhibits robust circadian rhythmicity, which stabilizes physiological and behavioral clocks during times of unanticipated environmental change. In Chapter 2 of this dissertation, I extend CORT’s stabilizing nature {{to the effect of}} constant light-induced disruption of circadian locomotor activity. In Chapter 3, I show that the presence and appropriate circadian phasing of CORT circulation is necessary for normal prefrontal cortex (PFC) Per 1, Per 2, and Bmal 1 mRNA expression in rats. In Chapter 4, I describe circadian variation in PFC-dependent cued conditioned fear extinction learning (a behavior that is often disrupted in human psychopathology), as evidenced by enhanced extinction recall and attenuated fear renewal in rats when they are trained/tested during their active phase. In Chapter 5, I provide evidence that optimal extinction learning requires the presence of a functional PFC molecular clock, as evidenced by exaggerated fear behavior in rats after PFC Per 1 knockdown through RNA interference. Furthermore, removal of CORT via adrenalectomy (ADX) impairs extinction learning in rats trained/tested during their active phase but has no effect on rats trained/tested during their inactive phase (described in Chapters 4 and 5). Complete normalization of this ADX effect requires an undisrupted history of circadian CORT circulation and acute CORT circulation at the time of extinction testing/training—neither is sufficient by itself. I submit that circadian CORT entrainment of PFC clock gene expression, which is necessary for optimal extinction learning, primes PFC neurons to respond to acute CORT during active phase extinction training/testing, thereby enabling learning-associated neuroplasticity. The research presented in this report provides evidence of heretofore uncharacterized CORT-dependent circadian entrainment of the PFC molecular clock and establishes the functional ramifications of its disruption. Many psychiatric disorders are associated with impaired circadian rhythmicity, abnormal basal and stress-induced CORT release, and impaired PFC function. Therefore, the clinical implications of the research presented in this dissertation are apparent...|$|R
