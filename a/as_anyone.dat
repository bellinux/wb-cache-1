5|$|Shortly {{after the}} {{beginning}} of the war, the board of the orchestra received a petition from rank and file players protesting about Borsdorf's continued membership of the LSO. Although he had done as much <b>as</b> <b>anyone</b> to found the orchestra, had lived in Britain for 30 years and was married to an Englishwoman, Borsdorf was regarded by some colleagues as an enemy alien and was forced out of the orchestra.|$|E
5|$|Pollack {{is known}} for his {{aggressive}} marketing. He’s noted on several occasions that he’s taken the strategies of the major sports brands, i.e. NASCAR, the NBA, and the NFL, and extracted the best practices to grow the WSOP. He has asserted, moreover, that “ports marketing fundamentally is about the selling of hope. Fans have the hope of their favorite team trading for the right player, drafting the right player, winning a game, winning the season, winning the world championship.” And furthermore that, “he World Series of Poker offers a brand of hope that is infinitely more accessible” insofar <b>as</b> <b>anyone</b> can enter the tournament and have a chance to play at the final table.|$|E

In 1971, there were still 32 agricultural operations in the municipality, but by 2007, this had shrunk to three, none of which was run <b>as</b> <b>anyone’s</b> main income earner.|$|R

5|$|In 1909 Harold Oliver {{moved to}} Lyrup, South Australia {{and started a}} farm growing fruit. During this time, he captained the Lyrup {{football}} team. In 1909, after never previously winning a game, the Lyrup football club won the local riverland league premiership. They subsequently traveled to Mildura where they lost twice to the home team. The Mildura Cultivator praised Oliver's marking and kicking reporting that it was as good <b>as</b> <b>anyone</b> who had played at the ground. An umpire at the game from Melbourne told Harold {{that he would be}} welcome in Melbourne to play football if he wanted to. At the end of 1909 Oliver was contemplating moving to Queensland to join his sister in the state but two friends, the Musgrave brothers, who played for West Suburbans in Adelaide suggested he come down and visit.|$|E
5|$|PRSA is {{organized}} as a 501(c)(6) not-for-profit organization and {{governed by a}} set of bylaws. A Chair is nominated each year and elected based on a vote of the Leadership Assembly. The Leadership Assembly consists of one delegate for every 100 members, as well <b>as</b> <b>anyone</b> that holds an elected office. Elected positions within PRSA are held on a volunteer-basis. A Board of Directors can propose membership fee changes that must be approved by the assembly. The board has the authority to create or dissolve task forces and committees as well as revoke or reward membership status. PRSA's Board of Ethics and Professional Standards and the Universal Accreditation Board make recommendations on the code of conduct and accreditation programs respectively. PRSA has more than 100 chapters in ten districts, 300 student chapters and 14 interest groups.|$|E
5|$|In post-trial analyses, {{blame for}} the outcome varied. Mamie Till Bradley was criticized for not crying enough on the stand. The jury was noted to have been picked almost {{exclusively}} from the hill country section of Tallahatchie County, which, due to its poorer economic make-up, found whites and blacks competing for land and other agrarian opportunities. Unlike the population living closer to the river (and thus closer to Bryant and Milam in Leflore County), who possessed a noblesse oblige toward blacks, according to historian Stephen Whitaker, those {{in the eastern part}} of the county were virulent in their racism. The prosecution was criticized for dismissing any potential juror who knew Milam or Bryant, for the fear that such a juror would vote to acquit. Afterward, Whitaker noted that this was a mistake, <b>as</b> <b>anyone</b> who had personally known the defendants usually disliked them. One juror voted twice to convict, but on the third discussion, acquiesced and voted with the rest of the jury to acquit. In later interviews, the jurors acknowledged that they knew Bryant and Milam were guilty, but simply did not believe that life imprisonment or the death penalty were fit punishment for whites who had killed a black man. But two jurors said as late as 2005 that they believed the defense's case. They said that the prosecution had not proved that Till had died, nor that it was his body that was removed from the river.|$|E
