6000|$|On {{the fourth}} day from our start we left Middelburg, and, taking a {{north-east}} course from this outpost of civilisation, overtook the waggon, and camped, after a twenty miles' trek, just {{on the edge of}} the bush-veldt. We had two young Boers to drive our waggons--terrible louts. However, they understood how to drive a waggon, and whilst one of them drove, the other would sit for hours, with a vacant stare on his face, thinking. It is a solemn fact that, from the time we left Middelburg till the time we returned, neither of those fellows touched water, that is, to wash themselves. The only luxury in the shape of comforts of the toilette which they allowed themselves was a comb with a brass back, carefully tied to the roof of the waggon with two strips of ox-hide thick enough to have held a hundredweight of lead. I don't think they ever used it--it was too great a luxury for general use--but they would occasionally untie it and look at it. Our own outfit in the waggon was necessarily scanty, consisting of a few iron pots and plates, a kettle, some green blankets, a lantern, and an old <b>anti-friction</b> grease-can used for water, which gave it a fine flavour of waggon-wheels. We also had a [...] "cartle," [...] or wooden frame, across which were stretched strips of hide fitted into the waggon about two feet above the floor, and intended to sleep on; but the less said about that the better.|$|E

5000|$|Reducing {{friction}} {{was one of}} {{the major}} reasons for the success of railroads compared to wagons. This was demonstrated on an iron plate covered wooden tramway in 1805 at Croydon, U.K. “ A good horse on an ordinary turnpike road can draw two thousand pounds, or one ton. A party of gentlemen were invited to witness the experiment, that the superiority of the new road might be established by ocular demonstration. Twelve wagons were loaded with stones, till each wagon weighed three tons, and the wagons were fastened together. A horse was then attached, which drew the wagons with ease, six miles in two hours, having stopped four times, in order to show he had the power of starting, as well as drawing his great load.”Better lubrication, such as from petroleum oils, reduced friction losses in mills and factories.

50|$|Ducts can be {{purchased}} {{with a variety of}} options or features. One such enhancement is pre-lubrication. Pre-lubricated ducts may be either permanently impregnated with <b>anti-friction</b> compounds or coated with liquid lubricant during manufacture (see GR-3155). This may or may not eliminate the need for supplementary lubrication when pulling cable into the duct. Before using a supplementary lubricant with a pre-lubricated duct, the user should check with the manufacturer to determine if the added lubricant is compatible with the pre-lubricated surface of the duct. Failure to do this may result in the cable seizing up rather than reducing the friction coefficient of the duct.|$|E
50|$|The American Bearing Manufacturers Association is an {{industry}} trade group that deals with all aspects of bearing technology.

In 1934 the AFBMA was incorporated as an organization in New York City. In 1993 the organization formally changed its title to the American Bearing Manufacturers Association in order to better serve its members and to expand membership eligibility.|$|E

This design allows for higher speeds but decreases the load capacity. The cage also increases internal space so it can hold more lubrication, which increases the time between relubrications. Depending on the exact design sometimes two rollers are put in each pocket of the cage, using a cage design originated by RBC Bearings in 1971.|$|E
