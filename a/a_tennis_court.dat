5|$|By 1944, {{space was}} running short, and Monsanto began {{negotiations}} {{to acquire the}} Runnymede Playhouse in the wealthy residential Dayton suburb of Oakwood. Built in 1927, the Playhouse was a leisure facility that included an outdoor swimming pool, a ballroom, a squash court, <b>a</b> <b>tennis</b> <b>court</b> with a cork floor and a stage for community theater. It had showers with Italian marble and a -story garage. The estate was owned by the Talbott Realty Company, which was controlled by Thomas's wife's family. The Talbotts were among the heirs of the Delco company, which was by then a part of General Motors.|$|E
5|$|Henry {{rebuilt the}} {{principal}} castle gateway in about 1510 and constructed <b>a</b> <b>tennis</b> <b>court</b> {{at the base}} of the motte in the Upper Ward. He also built a long terrace, called the North Wharf, along the outside wall of the Upper Ward; constructed of wood, it was designed to provide a commanding view of the River Thames below. The design included an outside staircase into the king's apartments, which made the monarch's life more comfortable at the expense of considerably weakening the castle's defences. Early in his reign, Henry had given the eastern Lady Chapel to Cardinal Wolsey for Wolsey's future mausoleum. Benedetto Grazzini converted much of this into an Italian Renaissance design, before Wolsey's fall from power brought an end to the project, with contemporaries estimating that around £60,000 (£295million in 2008 terms) had been spent on the work. Henry continued the project, but it remained unfinished when he himself was buried in the chapel, in an elaborate funeral in 1547.|$|E
5|$|Tennis for Two is {{a sports}} video game {{developed}} in 1958, which simulates {{a game of}} tennis, {{and was one of}} the first games developed in the early history of video games. American physicist William Higinbotham designed the game for display at the Brookhaven National Laboratory's annual public exhibition after learning that the government research institution's Donner Model 30 analog computer could simulate trajectories with wind resistance. He designed the game, displayed on an oscilloscope and played with two custom aluminum controllers, in a few hours, after which he and technician Robert V. Dvorak built it over three weeks. The game's visuals show a representation of <b>a</b> <b>tennis</b> <b>court</b> viewed from the side, and players adjust the angle of their shots with a knob on their controller and try to hit the ball over the net by pressing a button.|$|E

Tudor-style real <b>tennis</b> <b>courts</b> were long, high-ceiling buildings, with galleries for spectators; their dimensions [...] - [...] about 75 by 30 feet [...] - [...] are similar to the earlier theatres, and much larger than <b>a</b> modern <b>tennis</b> <b>court.</b>|$|R

5|$|The castle is {{approached}} {{through the}} castle meadow, {{an area of}} open parkland, lined with Holm oaks planted in the 1860s, and is surrounded by the dry moat, now a garden dating from at least the 1850s and planted with trees and shrubs. Adjacent to the castle are the Queen Mother's Garden and the kitchen garden and glasshouses. The Queen Mother's Garden was built by English Heritage as a 95th birthday gift for the then Lord Warden in 1997, the site having been originally part of the wider kitchen gardens, before being turned into <b>a</b> <b>tennis</b> <b>court</b> in the 1920s. Designed by Penelope Hobhouse, the garden incorporates classical and Islamic themes, with a 92-foot-long (28 m) pool, a viewing mound and a classical pavilion. The two glasshouses have been restored, functioning as cold greenhouses, while {{the remainder of the}} kitchen garden is planted with a mixture of vegetables, fruit trees and flowers.|$|E
5|$|There {{are three}} main public parks in Shaw and Crompton. Dunwood Park lies {{alongside}} the Oldham and Rochdale Metrolink Line {{and has a}} children's play area, bowling green, and over a mile of wooded pathways along {{the base of a}} forested hillside. The land that forms Dunwood Park was presented to Crompton Urban District Council by Captain Abram Crompton JP on 22 June 1911, and opened as a park by him on 14 September 1912. It was redeveloped with a new park and bowling green for its 2012 centenary after winning a £1 million grant from the National Lottery. High Crompton Park is in High Crompton and is home to <b>a</b> <b>tennis</b> <b>court,</b> bowling green, children's play area, and gardens. Jubilee Gardens are found in the centre of Shaw and Crompton town centre, behind the Crompton War Memorial. Shaw and Crompton has large areas of land reserved for sporting and communal events; these are located off George Street, Edward Road, and Rushcroft Road respectively.|$|E
5|$|To {{pay for the}} {{demolition}} of the 1960s extension, the consent application indicated that the University planned to sell off {{another part of the}} current South Stoneham estate, currently occupied by <b>a</b> <b>tennis</b> <b>court</b> and caretakers' house, for a residential scheme comprising 65 flats. In addition, to replace the student accommodation that {{the demolition}} would remove, the plan was for another building containing 64 student flats plus staff accommodation to be constructed on {{the eastern part of the}} site. The plan also indicated the provision of better access to the site including new footpaths alongside Monks Brook and the River Itchen as well as the possibility of handing part of the site to the city council as a nature conservation area. The University also planned a series of repairs and alterations to the original house.|$|E

5|$|To the south, is the Croquet lawn, {{previously}} <b>a</b> <b>tennis</b> <b>court</b> – Lady Churchill was {{an accomplished}} and competitive player of both, although Churchill was not. Beyond the lawn {{are a number}} of structures grouped around the Victorian kitchen garden, many of which Churchill was involved in building. He had developed an interest in bricklaying when he bought Chartwell and throughout the 1920s and 1930s constructed walls, a summerhouse and a number of houses on the estate. In 1928 he joined the Amalgamated Union of Building Trade Workers, a move which caused some controversy. Near the kitchen garden are the Golden Rose walk, a Golden Wedding anniversary present to the Churchills from their children in 1958, and Churchill's painting studio, constructed in the 1930s, which now houses a large collection of his artistic works.|$|E
5|$|Dunster Beach, which {{includes}} {{the mouth of the}} River Avill, is located half a mile from the village, and used to have a significant harbour, known as Dunster Haven, which was used for the export of wool from Saxon times; however, it was last used in the 17th century and has now disappeared, as new land was laid down among the dykes, meadows and marshes near the shore. During the Second World War, considerable defences were built along the coast as a part of British anti-invasion preparations, though the north coast of Somerset was an unlikely invasion site. Some of the structures remain to this day. Most notable are the pillboxes on the foreshore of Dunster Beach. These are strong buildings made from pebbles taken from the beach and bonded together with concrete. From these, soldiers could have held their ground if the Germans had ever invaded. The beach site has a number of privately owned beach huts (or chalets as some owners call them) along with a small shop, <b>a</b> <b>tennis</b> <b>court</b> and a putting green. The chalets, measuring , can be let out for holidays; some owners live in them all the year round.|$|E
5|$|English castles, {{including}} Kenilworth, did {{not play}} a decisive role during the Wars of the Roses (1455–85), which were fought primarily {{in the form of}} pitched battles between the rival factions of the Lancastrians and the Yorkists. With the mental collapse of King Henry VI, Queen Margaret used the Duchy of Lancaster lands in the Midlands, including Kenilworth, as one of her key bases of military support. Margaret removed Henry from London in 1456 for his own safety and until 1461, Henry's court divided almost all its time among Kenilworth, Leicester and Tutbury Castle for the purposes of protection. Kenilworth remained an important Lancastrian stronghold {{for the rest of the}} war, often acting as a military balance to the nearby castle of Warwick. With the victory of Henry VII at Bosworth, Kenilworth again received royal attention; Henry visited frequently and had <b>a</b> <b>tennis</b> <b>court</b> constructed at the castle for his use. His son, Henry VIII, decided that Kenilworth should be maintained as a royal castle. He abandoned the Pleasance and had part of the timber construction moved into the base court of the castle.|$|E

5|$|Higinbotham {{designed}} {{a game that}} used an oscilloscope to display {{the path of a}} simulated ball on <b>a</b> <b>tennis</b> <b>court</b> viewed from the side. The attached computer calculated the path of the ball and reversed its path when it hit the ground. The game also simulated the ball hitting the net if it did not achieve a high enough arc as well as changes in velocity due to drag from air resistance. Two aluminum controllers were attached to the computer, each consisting of a button and a knob. Pressing the button hit the ball, and turning a knob controlled the angle of the shot. Originally, Higinbotham considered having a second knob to control the velocity of the shot, but decided it would make the controller too complicated. The device was designed in a few hours with the help of colleague Dave Potter and was assembled over three weeks with the help of technician Robert V. Dvorak. While most of the circuitry was based on vacuum tubes and relays, the circuits to display the graphics on the oscilloscope used transistors, then beginning to replace vacuum tubes in the electronics industry. Excluding the oscilloscope and controller, the game's circuitry approximately took up the space of a microwave oven.|$|E
