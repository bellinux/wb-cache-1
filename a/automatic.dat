5|$|As {{champions of}} the Atlantic Coast Conference, Virginia Tech was awarded an <b>automatic</b> bid to the Orange Bowl game. The <b>automatic</b> ACC bid {{was the result of}} an {{off-season}} deal following the inaugural ACC Championship Game which granted the winner of the ACC Championship Game an <b>automatic</b> bid to the Orange Bowl unless it was ranked high enough in the Bowl Championship Series standings to play in the National Championship Game.|$|E

5|$|The Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC) {{conference tournament}} {{champion}} was Duke.

5|$|The entire metro {{system and}} the trains are run by a fully {{automated}} computer system, located at the Control and Maintenance Center south of Vestamager Station. The <b>automatic</b> train control (ATC) consists of three subsystems: <b>automatic</b> train protection (ATP), <b>automatic</b> train operation (ATO) and <b>automatic</b> train supervisory (ATS). The ATP is responsible for keeping the trains' speed, ensuring that doors are closed before departure and switches are correctly set. The system uses fixed block signaling, except around stations, where moving block signaling is used.|$|E
5|$|To be an <b>automatic</b> process, {{the effect}} should, like other <b>automatic</b> {{processes}} involving preferences, {{be influenced by}} deliberate thought. Multiple {{studies have shown that}} thinking about feelings inhibits <b>automatic</b> responding. Koole, Dijksterhuis, and van Knippenberg had subjects give their preferences for letters and numbers 1 to 50. They made half of them explain their preferences. They found a name-letter effect and birthday-number effect in those subjects asked to answer without thinking, but no effects in those asked to think. This points to the effect being the result of an <b>automatic</b> process.|$|E

5000|$|Next, McDaniel {{moved on}} to quick-drawing the handgun. Suitable types of handguns were those in which the hammer can be cocked and the gun fired simply by pulling the trigger {{straight}} through: double-action revolvers, double-action-only <b>automatics</b> (or [...] "auto-loaders"), and double-action/single-action <b>automatics,</b> which are fired double-action for the first shot, and single-action thereafter, the hammer then being cocked automatically by the cycling of the gun. Single-action revolvers and single-action <b>automatics,</b> which require that the hammer be cocked separately, require different procedures than those that McDaniel used.|$|R

5|$|A {{variant of}} the <b>Automatic</b> Block System, <b>Automatic</b> and Track Control (ATC) has since been introduced, which {{provides}} the same benefits as ABS on single lines of track, while still ensuring only one train in a section at a time. Centralised Traffic Control was also introduced in the 1960s on the new standard gauge line to Albury, {{and then on the}} main interstate line to Adelaide, allowing trains to be directed from a distance.|$|E
5|$|All {{versions}} of Perl do <b>automatic</b> data-typing and <b>automatic</b> memory management. The interpreter knows {{the type and}} storage requirements of every data object in the program; it allocates and frees storage for them as necessary using reference counting (so it cannot deallocate circular data structures without manual intervention). Legal type conversions — for example, conversions from number to string — are done automatically at run time; illegal type conversions are fatal errors.|$|E

All trains are still manned with train operators who open and close the doors, make station announcements, and supervise their trains. The system was designed so that an operator could manually operate a train when necessary.|$|E

5|$|GTAW welding torches are {{designed}} for either <b>automatic</b> or manual operation and are equipped with cooling systems using air or water. The <b>automatic</b> and manual torches are similar in construction, but the manual torch has a handle while the <b>automatic</b> torch normally comes with a mounting rack. The angle between the centerline of the handle and the centerline of the tungsten electrode, known as the head angle, can be varied on some manual torches according to the preference of the operator. Air cooling systems are most often used for low-current operations (up to about 200A), while water cooling is required for high-current welding (up to about 600A). The torches are connected with cables to the power supply and with hoses to the shielding gas source and where used, the water supply.|$|E

It is listed at 22 of the top 50 punk songs from that era by Punks Reunited. [...] The <b>Automatics</b> also played gigs with Johnny Thunders and The Heartbreakers and Thunders himself played on the <b>Automatics</b> first album, Walking with the Radio (available through Angel Air, UK). The <b>Automatics</b> toured England with the Vibrators and played the Reading Festival in 1979. In 1980, Dave Philp moved to California, where he remained lead singer and songwriter for the <b>Automatics</b> but with different players in the band.
