5|$|NC State, {{needing to}} score, {{drove down the}} field <b>and</b> <b>kicked</b> a go-ahead 33-yard field goal with 7:12 {{remaining}} in the game. After a failed possession, Tech was forced to punt the ball, allowing NC State to run down the clock. The Virginia Tech defense eventually forced a stop, giving the Tech offense one final {{chance to win the}} game. With 1:53 on the clock and beginning from their own 20-yard line, the Hokies drove 57yards to the NC State 23-yard line. There, kicker Chris Kinzer successfully kicked a 40-yard field goal as time expired to give Virginia Tech the win.|$|E

5|$|The Soviet coaches {{blamed the}} loss on the refereeing. Bobrov {{complained that the}} pair of American referees, Frank Larsen and Steve Dowling, let the Canadians get away with everything.

The pair of referees, scheduled to referee game four in Vancouver, were replaced by the pair who had refereed game one and game three, Gord Lee and Len Gagnon. Team Canada agreed to the request by the Soviets to change referees, apparently not aware of Starovoitov's tantrum after game two.|$|E

5|$|Wyatt Earp and Cochise County sheriff Johnny Behan were {{interested}} in the same sheriff's position and also may have shared an interest in the same woman, Josephine Marcus, known as Sadie. Citizens of Tombstone believed that Behan and Marcus were married, but Behan was a known womanizer and had sex with prostitutes and other women. Marcus ended the relationship after she came home and found Behan in bed with the wife of a friend <b>and</b> <b>kicked</b> him out, although she used the Behan surname through the end of that summer. She rented her home sometime before April 1881 to a doctor, George Goodfellow.|$|E

5|$|After {{playing their}} {{previous}} game at Birmingham's Lakeview Park, {{the city of}} Montgomery gave Alabama and the Agricultural & Mechanical College of Alabama (now known as Auburn University) $500 to play each other at Riverside Park. In the second edition of what has since {{become known as the}} Iron Bowl, Auburn won 40–16. Auburn scored first when Rufus Dorsey scored on a 10-yard touchdown run <b>and</b> <b>kicked</b> the extra point for a 6–0 lead. Alabama responded on their next possession when John Burgett scored on a 35-yard touchdown run. However G. H. Kyser missed the extra point and Auburn still held a 6–4 lead. Auburn then extended their lead to 18–4 at halftime after a pair of touchdown from J. C. Dunham.|$|E
5|$|After the album's release, {{the band}} {{embarked}} on a successful world tour that was once again filled with incidents. In late summer 2002, whilst the band were on tour in the US, Noel, Bell and touring keyboardist Jay Darlington {{were involved in a}} car accident in Indianapolis. While none of the band members sustained any major injuries, some shows were cancelled as a result. In December 2002, {{the latter half of the}} German leg of the band's European tour had to be postponed after Liam Gallagher, Alan White and three other members of the band's entourage were arrested after a violent brawl at a Munich nightclub. The band had been drinking heavily and tests showed that Liam had used cocaine. Liam lost two front teeth <b>and</b> <b>kicked</b> a police officer in the ribs, while Alan suffered minor head injuries after getting hit with an ashtray. Two years later Liam was fined around £40,000. The band finished their tour in March 2003 after returning to those postponed dates.|$|E
5|$|Bulldogs battled the Dayton Triangles in week five. The Bulldogs {{opened the}} scoring {{in the first}} quarter on a two-yard rushing {{touchdown}} by Pete Calac. But the Triangles came back in the second quarter, scoring twice: back Frank Bacon had a four-yard rushing touchdown, and end Dave Reese had a 50-yard receiving touchdown. Guyon scored a 22-yard rushing touchdown during the corner, but the extra point sailed wide. In the third quarter, the Triangles responded with a 3-yard rushing touchdown by back Lou Partlow, but Dayton missed the extra point to make the score 20–14. Thorpe then came into the game, <b>and</b> <b>kicked</b> a 45-yard field goal to bring his team within three points. In the final minutes, Thorpe kicked another 35-yard field goal to tie it. The Triangles were the first team to score on the Bulldogs since the opening game of the previous year.|$|E

5|$|Due to the war, the SAFA {{suspended}} its {{competition from}} 1916 through to 1918. Despite this official suspension, {{a group of}} South Australian clubs decided to form their own league in 1916 and the money generated would be put toward the war effort. The Railways Football Club {{was one of the}} clubs that participated in this competition and managed to attract Harold Oliver to be the clubs captain. Unfortunately for the Railways, Oliver would only play one game for the Railways, and would instead return to Berri to focus on his farm. Later in the season, Oliver returned to Port Adelaide to play a few games for the club who was also partaking in the Patriotic League. Port Adelaide would end up winning the 1916 South Australian Patriotic League Grand Final defeating West Torrens 7.11 (53) to 1.13 (19). Harold Oliver played for Port Adelaide during the game <b>and</b> <b>kicked</b> a goal.|$|E
5|$|Following the post-field goal kickoff, the Virginia Tech offense {{attempted}} to answer Auburn's quick score. Unfortunately for the Hokies, their second drive fared {{even worse than}} the first. Tech committed a 10-yard penalty, suffered an eight-yard loss on a play, then had a Bryan Randall pass intercepted by Auburn safety Junior Rosegreen. Rosegreen returned the ball 31 yards, and put Auburn's offense into good field position for its second drive of the game. Auburn also suffered an early penalty in its drive, but moved the ball with another long play—a 23-yard pass to Courtney Taylor—to recover. Again, however, the Virginia Tech defense recovered to force Auburn into a fourth down and a field goal attempt. Vaughn returned to the field <b>and</b> <b>kicked</b> a 19-yard field goal, giving Auburn a 6–0 lead with 1:06 remaining in the quarter.|$|E

He finished the season with 847 yards rushing and 16 touchdowns. He also completed 13 of 36 passing attempts for 160 yards. His 98 points scored (111 including the bowl game) led the nation. After the season, the Associated Press named Van Buren to its All-Southeastern Conference first team.|$|E

5|$|In a {{situation}} with more time, Virginia Tech would have kicked the ball off to Florida State and {{hoped for a}} defensive stop to give the offense {{a chance for a}} game-winning drive. With less than twominutes remaining, however, and with Virginia Tech having used all its timeouts, the only chance for the Hokies was to attempt a difficult onside kick. A successful recovery would give the Hokies another chance on offense. Kicker Brandon Pace teed up the ball, <b>and</b> <b>kicked</b> it forwards, bouncing the ball high into the air to create a jump ball situation. Virginia Tech's Xavier Adibi recovered the ball, but because the kick had only traveled nineyards before the recovery, the ball was awarded to Florida State. NCAA rules state that an onside kick must travel at least 10yards before the kicking team can legally touch the ball, and Pace's kick had not traveled the requisite distance.|$|E
5|$|In regular time, Cardiff took {{an early}} lead with a penalty before Leicester's Scott Hamilton scored a {{converted}} try and they kicked another penalty.

Early in the second half, Geordan Murphy scored another try for Leicester, which again was converted <b>and</b> <b>kicked</b> two more penalties to extend their lead to 26–12 with 20 minutes remaining. Leicester then had two players sent to the sin bin, and Cardiff scored two tries in the last 10 minutes of regular time, first by Jamie Roberts and then Tom James, with both conversions successful to bring the scores level at 26–26 and take the game into extra time.|$|E
