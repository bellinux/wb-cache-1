5000|$|... 1961 Development of {{the first}} <b>avalanche</b> <b>rectifier</b> diode in the world ...|$|E
50|$|In 1974 Tallinn Electrotechnical plant {{manufactured}} experimental UVP-5 rectifying units. They featured tablet <b>avalanche</b> <b>rectifiers</b> (12th class) {{with natural}} air cooling. One of these units was mounted in ER9P-32304 motor car, {{which were in}} use by Gorky Railroad.|$|R
5000|$|Starting with ER9p-230 {{trainset}} (1969), the UVP-1 rectifying unit {{is changed}} by UVP-3. It features 84 VKLD-200-8B <b>avalanche</b> <b>rectifiers.</b> Every bridge's arm has 3 parallel circuits, consisting of 6 rectifiers connected in series. The branchings have 3 parallel circuits, with 2 rectifiers connected in series. the connection resistors are absent in UVP-3, {{as well as}} devices reacting to rectifier fan-out. (?) ...|$|R
