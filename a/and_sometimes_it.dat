If someone with Raynaud's is placed into a cold climate, it could potentially become dangerous.|$|E
25|$|Wind {{instruments}} tend {{to work in}} sections, {{with groups}} of trombones or flutes or whatever alternating or overlapping in tone blocks that are displaced from each other rhythmically, ultimately to a heavy effect that leaves little room for luminosity. Indeed, rhythm was the score’s strong suit, <b>and</b> <b>sometimes</b> <b>it</b> injected considerable momentum. By the end, though, it did not sustain a score of this length on its own, unassisted as it was by concomitant strength in harmonic direction or, most regrettably, melodic contour.|$|E

25|$|When {{large amounts}} of weight are needed, a harness {{may be used to}} carry the load on the diver's shoulders, rather than around the waist, where it may tend to slip down into an uncomfortable {{position}} if the diver is working in a vertical posture, which is often the case. Sometimes this is a separate harness, worn under the safety harness, with pockets at the sides to carry the weights, <b>and</b> <b>sometimes</b> <b>it</b> is an integrated system, which carries the weight in pockets built into or externally attached to the safety harness.|$|E
25|$|The {{only other}} source of {{freshwater}} was from wells bored into the isthmus with Spain, which produced non-potable water. During the 19th century, the public could draw {{water for a}} fee but this supply was taxed by the British. A few dwellings, mainly those occupied by British officials, had their own private wells. However, most of the population {{had to rely on}} the public wells, from where they drew water which they carried back into the town. The water level gradually receded during the dry summer months, <b>and</b> <b>sometimes</b> <b>it</b> dried up altogether if precipitation during the year had been lower than usual.|$|E

Every morning, travelling cart of bubur ayam vendors are often found regularly frequenting residential area to sell their wares in the neighbourhood. A popular version is bubur ayam, which is rice congee with shredded chicken meat. It is also served with many condiments, such as green onion, crispy fried shallot, fried soybean, Chinese crullers (youtiao, known as cakwe in Indonesia), both salty and sweet soy sauce, <b>and</b> <b>sometimes</b> <b>it</b> is topped with yellow chicken broth and kerupuk (Indonesian style crackers).

By early 2017, he had uploaded almost 3,500 videos to his channel, around 400 {{of which have been}} made private. In March 2017, PewDiePie commented that his channel was running on a daily output, stating, [...] " [...] a lot of challenges in doing daily content, it's stupid. I really shouldn't be doing it, I really should just fucking go back and upload twice a week or some shit, and then take a step back, but I still really, really love the daily challenge—the daily grind—of just being like, 'hey, I'm gonna make a video today, no matter what.' <b>And</b> <b>sometimes</b> <b>it</b> really works, <b>and</b> <b>sometimes</b> <b>it</b> doesn't." ...|$|E
500|$|The Super Cub {{has been}} {{compared}} to the Ford Model T, Volkswagen Beetle and the Jeep as an icon of 20th century industry and transport. The C100 used a pressed steel monocoque chassis, with the horizontal engine placed below the central spine, a configuration now called the 'step through' or 'underbone' motorcycle. By some criteria, the type of motorcycle the Super Cub falls into is difficult to classify, landing somewhere between a scooter and a motorcycle, <b>and</b> <b>sometimes</b> <b>it</b> was called a moped, [...] "", or scooterette.|$|E

It also is categorized in genres like speed metal and heavy metal. Thom Jurek said Lombardo's percussion beats [...] "are WAAAAAAAY up in the mix," [...] and said that [...] "you can understand every word, even on the thrashers" [...] about Tom Araya's vocal style. [...] "he guitars are simply further down in the mix <b>and</b> <b>sometimes</b> <b>it</b> becomes difficult to discern Araya's bass. Therefore, the first listen or two to World Painted Blood {{might be a bit}} confusing for the seasoned Slayer fan, but that changes quickly, and the sound of those drums blasting in one's head will become a more than welcome presence in the mix." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Start Over" [...] finds Knowles affirming her {{individuality}} and expressing {{her love for}} a man with whom she attempts to start a relationship all over again rather than losing it. Jon Caramanica of The New York Times added that Knowles' emotional radar [...] "is set to loyalty, for better or worse — sometimes that loyalty is rewarded, <b>and</b> <b>sometimes</b> <b>it</b> has been betrayed, but over all, she operates on the axis of faithfulness". Her vocals throughout the song are [...] "so vulnerable that they're almost tortured" [...] as stated by Rubenstein. Lewis Corner of Digital Spy further noted that the [...] "raspy and husky growls" [...] that Knowles adopts occasionally on [...] "Start Over", show an [...] "offering moments of raw, heartfelt emotion".|$|E

500|$|Nelson and {{the band}} {{encountered}} problems in producing {{some aspects of the}} song. According to Champion, [...] "...it was really difficult to record, because it worked at about five or six different tempos. It was a tough choice of choosing which tempo to play, because sometimes it sounded too rushed, <b>and</b> <b>sometimes</b> <b>it</b> sounded as if it was dragging..." [...] The band was trying to get the right tempo, according to Nelson, [...] "because a beat either side of the tempo we picked didn't have the same groove". To improve the song, they recorded this part live and Buckland overdubbed his guitar. They recorded it two or three times until Nelson {{and the band}} were happy at the output. The backing vocals were recorded in the control room of Quadrangle.|$|E
500|$|On 25 August Hooke began {{picking up}} {{occasional}} radio signals being exchanged between Macquarie Island and New Zealand. By {{the end of}} August open leads were beginning to appear, <b>and</b> <b>sometimes</b> <b>it</b> was possible to discern a sea-swell under the ship. However, severe weather returned in September, when a hurricane-force wind destroyed the wireless aerial and temporarily halted Hooke's efforts. On 22 September, when Aurora was in sight of the uninhabited Balleny Islands, Stenhouse estimated that they had travelled over [...] from Cape Evans, in {{what he called a}} [...] "wonderful drift". He added that regular observations and records of the nature and direction of the ice had been maintained throughout: [...] "It [...] has not been in vain, and [...] knowledge of the set and drift of the pack will be a valuable addition to the sum of human knowledge".|$|E
500|$|Reviews of {{the episode}} by {{television}} critics were mostly positive, noting its [...] "hilarious beginning and the nice ending." [...] Dan Iverson of IGN praised the episode, stating that the episode [...] "looks to show that this fifth season {{is going to bring}} the series back to the irreverent basics that made it so appealing." [...] Iverson went on to comment that some of the jokes were [...] "extremely funny" [...] and that [...] "the episode had it all, from the Electric Company bit to making fun of people who drive Hummers and watch movies like Madagascar." [...] In the conclusion of his review, Iverson gave the episode an eight out of ten. Brett Love of TV Squad also gave the episode a positive review, calling the installment much better than the previous two episode's from the season, [...] "Stewie Loves Lois" [...] and [...] "Mother Tucker", but criticized the storyline's similarity to the South Park episode [...] "Something Wall-Mart This Way Comes". Love commented negatively on the portrayal of Peter working at the superstore, however, stating, [...] "it's a fine line when they go retarded with Peter. Sometimes it plays really funny, <b>and</b> <b>sometimes</b> <b>it</b> just gets annoying." ...|$|E

500|$|Hirst's batting {{continued}} to be more successful than his bowling, {{to the point where}} commentators regarded him as primarily a batsman, who bowled occasionally. In 1900, he scored 1,960 runs at an average of 40.83, his best batting record to date, but his total of wickets fell to 62 at an average of 26.90, his worst average until 1914. His only representative cricket came in end-of-season festival matches, including a Gentlemen v Players match. Yorkshire won the County Championship, the first of three consecutive victories in which Hirst played a leading role. After his achievements in the season, Hirst was selected as one of Wisden's Cricketers of the Year. The citation described him as a confident batsman who could be relied upon in difficult batting conditions or when his team were under pressure, but noted how his bowling had suffered as he improved as a batsman. However, around this time, Hirst began to develop his use of swing bowling, known at the time as swerve bowling. Previously, the ball occasionally swung through the air without his deliberate intention after he released it, but he now discovered a method to control the [...] "swerve" [...] in certain atmospheric conditions. He never discussed how he achieved the effect, limiting his comments to [...] "sometimes it works <b>and</b> <b>sometimes</b> <b>it</b> doesn't." ...|$|E
