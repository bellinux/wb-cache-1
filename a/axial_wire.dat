40|$|Insertion of {{electrically}} floating wires {{along the}} axis of a squid giant axon produces an apparent increase in diameter in the region where the wire surface has been treated {{to give it a}} low resistance. The shape of action potentials propagating into this region depend upon the surface resistance (and the length) of the wire. As this segment's internal resistance is lowered by reducing the wire's surface resistance, the following characteristic sequence of changes in the action potential is seen at the transition region: (a) the duration increases; (b) two peaks develop, the first one generated in the normal axon region and the second one generated later in the <b>axial</b> <b>wire</b> region, and; (c) blockage occurs (for a very low resistance wire). Action potentials recorded at the membrane region near the tip of the <b>axial</b> <b>wire</b> in (b) resemble those recorded at the initial segment of neurons upon antidromic invasions. Squid axon action potentials propagated from a normal region into that containing the low resistance wire also resemble antidromic invasions recorded in neuron somas. Hyperpolarizing current pulses applied through the wire act as if the wire surface resistance was momentarily reduced. For example, the two components of the action potential recorded at the <b>axial</b> <b>wire</b> membrane region noted in (b) can be sequentially blocked by the application of increasing hyperpolarizing current through the wire. Similar effects are seen when hyperpolarizing currents are injected into motoneuron somas. It is concluded that the geometrical properties of the junction of a neuron axon with its soma may be in themselves sufficient to determine the shape of the action potentials usually recorded by microelectrodes...|$|E

40|$|Many of the {{flexible}} risers in service {{do not meet}} their documented service life. A common failure mode is the rupture of the abrasive external layer which, in itself, is not critical, but seawater ingress may corrode tensile wires over time and, in worst case, cause breakage. Damaged tensile armour could significantly reduce the load capacity of the riser. Integrity assessment of flexible riser with damaged tensile armour based on stress concentration factors (SCF) could predict the remaining fatigue life of the structure. SCF could be based on experimental tests, but they are expensive. Finite element analyses can be used instead {{at a much lower}} cost. In this thesis, three finite element models are created in Abaqus to replicate a 2. 5 inch flexible riser. In the first model, the tensile wires are represented by beam elements and the other layers by shell elements. In the second and third model, the tensile wires are represented by solid elements and the other layers are represented by shell and solid elements, respectively. However, only the two last models are used in the analyses. To reduce simulation time, the carcass and pressure armour are modelled in a simplified manner with equivalent material properties. A convergence study is performed to find the minimum element size needed to yield good results. The equivalent material properties used in the simplified layers are evaluated by comparing the hoop stress to analytical values which are in good agreement. Two load cases are considered in the stress analyses, where one is tension and the other is bending. The models are verified by comparing the axial stiffness to the physical one and <b>axial</b> <b>wire</b> stress due to bending to analytical values found in the literature.

40|$|Three new {{approaches}} to generating thrust in uniform magnetic fields are proposed. The first direction is based on employing Lorentz force acting on partial magnetically shielded 8 -shaped loop with current in external magnetic field, whereby a net force rather than a torque origins. Another approach, called a Virtual Wire System, is based on creating a magnetic field having an energetic symmetry (a virtual wire), with further superposition of external field. The external field breaks the symmetry causing origination of a net force. Unlike a wire with current, having radial energetic symmetry, the symmetry of the Virtual Wire System is closer to an <b>axial</b> <b>wire.</b> The third approach refers to the first two. It is based on creation of developed surface system, comprising {{the elements of the}} first two types. The developed surface approach is a way to drastically increase a thrust-to-weight ratio.

40|$|AbstractGeometric {{variations}} {{by means}} of orientation of obstructions to the fluid flow can {{have a significant effect}} on the flow dynamics of gases in pursuit of maintaining required mixing in a low Reynolds number flow for a prospective reaction between the two gases. In this study, the effect of placing the obstructions parallel and perpendicular to the N 2 and H 2 flow was observed initially. Parallel placement resulted in favorable conditions in maintaining the desired ratio of the two components giving more than 90 % mixing index throughout the channel length while perpendicular placement signaled better lateral movement on encountering the obstruction. Taking a cue from this, geometries having a combination of parallel and perpendicular obstructions were proposed based on results of parametric study on number of wires and spacing between them. Increasing perpendicular obstruction sets beyond 5 took the mixing index down to as low as 60 %. Increasing spacing from 1. 5 mm to 2 mm deteriorated mixing index further but reducing perpendicular sets from 5 to 3 with 2 mm spacing resulted in 90 % mixing index throughout the channel and benchmark observed in axial-only configuration was regained. Also, increasing number of <b>axial</b> <b>wires</b> on a given perpendicular set or reducing their spacing did not alter desired mixing index to a great extent...|$|R

Furthermore, conductance and permeability ratios of NH+ 4 or Rb+ to K+ are functions of ion concentration. Conductance measurements also reveal the presence of an anomalous mole fraction effect for NH+ 4, Rb+, or Tl+ to K+. Finally, internal Cs+ blocks these K channels in a voltage-dependent manner, with relief of block by elevations in external K+ but not external NH+ 4 or Cs+. Energy profiles for K+, NH+ 4, Rb+, Tl+, and Cs+ incorporating three barriers and two ion-binding sites are fitted to the data.

30|$|In {{this type}} of tibial hemimelia, {{there is only a}} {{proximal}} tibial epiphysis present and no proximal tibial physis. The proximal tibial epiphysis is often unossified at an early age. The foot is in severe equinovarus, and the fibula is relatively overgrown and proximally migrated at the knee. The treatment preferred is also a two-stage surgery similar to that described for Paley type 4 a tibial hemimelia. Since the tibial epiphysis is so small it needs to be fixed to the proximal femoral ring with an <b>axial</b> <b>wire</b> and/or a transverse tibial epiphysis wire to prevent the tibial epiphysis from being transported distally during the distal transport of the proximal fibula. There are two options for the fibular transport. The first option is to bring it down to station and then osteotomize as described for type 4 a. The second option is to distract the fibular head below the level of the proximal tibial epiphysis. In this case the proximal tibial epiphysis is fused to the proximal fibular epiphysis (Fig.  10 left leg). This has the advantage of preserving and transferring the proximal fibular physis to become the proximal tibial physis, thus reducing leg length discrepancy from the absence of a proximal tibial physis.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT Giant axons {{from the}} {{crayfish}} have been voltage clamped with an <b>axial</b> <b>wire</b> system. General characterististics of observed ionic currents under normal conditions {{are similar to}} those measured in other giant axons and in nodes of Ranvier. As the pH of the external bath is lowered below 7, a marked, reversible slowing of potassium currents is seen with little effect on sodium currents. The steady-state potassium conductance-voltage curve is shifted along the voltage axis {{in a manner consistent with}} the development of a hyperpolarizing surface charge. Results suggest that this potential shift accounts for part, though not all, of the observed increase in r,. From the behavior of the kinetics of the delayed current with external pH these alterations in potassium conductance are attributed to the titration of a histidine imidazole residue of a membrane protein. Chemical modification of histidine by carbethoxylation at pH 6 slows and strongly depresses potassium currents. The results suggest that in addition to the introduction of electrostatic forces, possibly resulting from a hyperpolarizing surface charge, protonation of a histidine group at low pH also alters the nonelectrostatic chemical interactions determining the ease with which potassium gates open and close. The evidence indicates that the modified histidine residue is closely associated with the membrane components involved in the control of potassium conductance...|$|E
40|$|Modification {{of sodium}} {{channels}} by chloramine-T was examined in voltage clamped internally perfused crayfish and squid giant axons using the double sucrose gap and <b>axial</b> <b>wire</b> technique, respectively. Freshly prepared chloramine-T solution exerted two major actions on sodium channels: (a) an irreversible {{removal of the}} fast Na inactivation, and (b) a reversible block of the Na current. Both effects were observed when chloramine-T was applied internally or externally (5 – 10 mM) to axons. The first effect was studied in crayfish axons. We found that {{the removal of the}} fast Na inactivation did not depend on the states of the channel since the channel could be modified by chloramine-T at holding potential (from - 80 to - 100 mV) or at depolarized potential of - 30 mV. After removal of fast Na inactivation, the slow inactivation mechanism was still present, and more channels could undergo slow inactivation. This result indicates that in crayfish axons the transition through the fast inactivated state is not a prerequisite for the slow inactivation to occur. During chloramine-T treatment, a distinct blocking phase occurred, which recovered upon washing out the drug. This second effect of chloramine-T was studied in detail in squid axons. After 24 h, chloramine-T solution lost its ability to remove fast inactivation but retained its blocking action. After removal of the fast Na inactivation, both fresh and aged chloramine-T solutions blocked the Na currents with a similar potency and in a voltage-dependent manner, being more pronounced at lower depolarizing potentials.

40|$|Inactivation of delayed {{rectifier}} K conductance (gK) was {{studied in}} squid giant axons {{and in the}} somata of giant fiber lobe (GFL) neurons. Axon measurements were made with an <b>axial</b> <b>wire</b> voltage clamp by pulsing to VK (∼− 10 mV in 50 – 70 mM external K) for a variable time and then assaying available gK with a strong, brief test pulse. GFL cells were studied with whole-cell patch clamp using the same prepulse procedure {{as well as with}} long depolarizations. Under our experimental conditions (12 – 18 °C, 4 mM internal MgATP) a large fraction of gK inactivates within 250 ms at − 10 mV in both cell bodies and axons, although inactivation tends to be more complete in cell bodies. Inactivation in both preparations shows two kinetic components. The faster component is more temperature-sensitive and becomes very prominent above 12 °C. Contribution of the fast component to inactivation shows a similar voltage dependence to that of gK, suggesting a strong coupling of this inactivation path to the open state. Omission of internal MgATP or application of internal protease reduces the amount of fast inactivation. High external K decreases the amount of rapidly inactivating IK but does not greatly alter inactivation kinetics. Neither external nor internal tetraethylammonium has a marked effect on inactivation kinetics. Squid delayed rectifier K channels in GFL cell bodies and giant axons thus share complex fast inactivation properties that do not closely resemble those associated with either C-type or N-type inactivation of cloned Kv 1 channels studied in heterologous expression systems...|$|E

30|$|The unossified {{portion of}} the tibia will {{eventually}} ossify after many years. To accelerate this process, bone morphogenic protein (BMP 2) can be inserted into the cartilage. This is an off-label use of INFUSE (Medtronic, Memphis, TN). The basis of its use in tibial hemimelia is the author’s experience using BMP 2 in delayed ossification of the femoral neck to promote ossification in congenital femoral deficiency [62]. Ossification of the tibia facilitates lengthening and deformity correction of the tibia through bone. If sufficient parts of the tibia are bony, an osteotomy can be made through the bony portion and pins placed in the bony portion. If an insufficient {{portion of the}} tibia is ossified to allow for external fixation, then open surgery is performed to acutely realign the foot with a tibial osteotomy, combined with resection of part of the fibular diaphysis. To ossify the tibial anlage (non-ossified portion of the tibia), BMP 2 is inserted into drill holes in the cartilage. Stabilization of the osteotomy is achieved with retrograde <b>axial</b> Kirschner <b>wires</b> through the foot and up the tibia. In most cases, ossification of the anlage is already seen by 3  months after BMP 2 implantation surgery.

40|$|The squid giant axon {{was used}} as a model system in which to {{determine}} the independent contributions of membrane excitability and diameter changes to threshold parameters and propagation of action potentials in inhomogeneous regions. The membrane excitability of a segment of an axon was altered by changes in the bathing solution, while its effective electrical diameter was increased by the insertion of a low-resistance <b>axial</b> <b>wire.</b> In computer simulations of these experiments, similar alterations were made in the membrane's conductance and axon's diameter. The inflexions in the shapes of action potentials propagating into a region with abrupt decreases in axial resistance become more pronounced when the interval between impulses was shortened. At short intervals, propagation of the second impulse failed. In contrast, reduction of membrane excitability produced inflexion-free changes in action potential shape and allowed a close-following second impulse to pass through the inhomogeneity. A combined decrease in membrane excitability and increase in diameter of the same region exaggerated the changes in action potential shape characteristic of the diameter increase alone. Threshold parameters were obtained from 'strength-duration' excitability relationships measured by injection of current at different points along the axon. When only the membrane excitability was reduced, threshold characteristics changed smoothly from one region of the nerve to another. In contrast, lowering the internal resistance or increasing the diameter in one region of a nerve lowered the time constant of excitation and the threshold for brief (relative to rheobasic) current stimuli in the small-diameter region near the transition while raising them in the larger-diameter region...|$|E

To identify how the flow regimes generated in this continuously forced system are modified {{by the presence of}} a radial depth gradient, experiments have been performed with both horizontal (f-plane) and oppositely sloping boundaries. Endwall configurations which cause the fluid depth (D) to increase with radius (∂D/∂> 0) and to decrease with radius (∂D/∂r 0 endwall experiments consists of modes with azimuthal wavenumbers m = 1 to 5. Only the mode m = 1 is seen in the regular wave regime of the ∂D/∂r 0 (∂D/∂r 0 endwall experiments, which leads to the formation of between two and three independent trains of eddies within the lateral domain at sufficiently high values of Ω. Within the non-axisymmetric flow regimes of all three endwall configurations the number of zonal jets observed in the lateral domain of the experiment is larger than expected from the form of the background thermal forcing. The radial scale of the multiple zonal jets seen in the oppositely sloping boundary experiments is, however, much larger than a barotropic Rhines scale L β, suggesting that L β cannot be used to predict the radial wavenumber of the zonal mean flow in this continuously forced system. © 1998 American Institute of Physics...|$|E

Later, patients in the series were fixed with a nail that permitted axial compression of the osteotomy.|$|R

Execute Dynamic response analysis of transmission tower-line system under broken wire impact with SAP 2000. The results show that:broken wire {{influence on the}} reaction of transmission tower-line system displacement and internal force can not be ignored;influence on the reaction of transmission tower-line system displacement and internal force caused by ground wire broken is less while that of conductor is significant,peak value of a stem internal force can {{be as much as}} 2 times initial <b>axial</b> force;the more <b>wires</b> are broken,the vibration response of transmission tower-line system is greater, the safety degree is lower;when it comes to internal force,there is significant difference between consider broken wire load as impact load and as static load,dynamic effects cannot be ignored...|$|R
