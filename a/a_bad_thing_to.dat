500|$|After the Super Furry Animals {{had decided}} to call the album Hey Venus! they remembered [...] "slightly too late" [...] that the name had already been used by Northern Irish band That Petrol Emotion for a single taken from their Chemicrazy LP. However, as Rhys and Guto Pryce in {{particular}} were fans of the band, they reasoned that it [...] "wasn't necessarily <b>a</b> <b>bad</b> <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> share a name" [...] with the song.|$|E
500|$|In {{the first}} episode of the fourth season, [...] "The New Rachel", Blaine becomes the lead singer of New Directions and {{successfully}} prompts Kurt to follow his New York City dreams. In addition, Blaine successfully runs for senior class president with Sam (Chord Overstreet), and the two subsequently develop a friendship. Kurt inadvertently pulls away from Blaine due to his Vogue.com internship; distraught and feeling isolated from his friends, Blaine cheats on Kurt. After confessing to Kurt of his infidelity, Kurt severs all ties. New Directions' Nationals trophy is stolen by Hunter Clarington (Nolan Gerard Funk), the new captain of the Dalton Academy Warblers. When Blaine goes to Dalton Academy to retrieve it, Hunter and Sebastian attempt to seduce Blaine into returning to the Warblers. Blaine becomes conflicted, believing {{that he does not}} belong in New Directions. Sam ultimately convinces him that, despite having done <b>a</b> <b>bad</b> <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> Kurt, Blaine is still a good person and an important member of New Directions.|$|E
2500|$|The fictional ticking {{time bomb}} {{scenario}} {{suggested by the}} moderator was: [...] "Three shopping centers near major U.S. cities have been hit by suicide bombers. Hundreds are dead, thousands injured. A fourth attack has been averted when the attackers were captured off the Florida coast and taken to Guantanamo Bay, where they are being questioned. U.S. intelligence believes that another larger attack is planned and could come at any time." [...] John McCain and Ron Paul were the only candidates {{who said they were}} opposed to the concept of [...] "enhanced interrogation techniques", a phrase Paul labeled Orwellian newspeak for torture. Mitt Romney suggested that the U.S. double the size of facilities holding non-citizen enemy combatants held in places like Guantanamo and deny them access to the protections afforded to American citizens, such as the right of having an attorney. Giuliani said interrogators should use [...] "any method they can think of" [...] and did not exclude water-boarding. Expressing disbelief at the idea of debating [...] "whether or not waterboarding would be <b>a</b> <b>bad</b> <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> do" [...] Tom Tancredo said [...] "I'm looking for Jack Bauer." ...|$|E

2500|$|Singing {{consists}} {{mostly of}} vocables, though recordings and {{reports from the}} early 1900s and prior indicate there were {{a great deal more}} lyrics or vocal texts. Blackfoot people see the profusion of words in European American music and African American music as lessening the importance and meaning of both words and music; and the same for the manner of listening to such music, that is, for entertainment or enjoyment, often while doing other things: if someone needed to say so many words, why didn't they just talk (p.69). Blackfoot music is not based on instruments or texts, and singing is not supposed to sound like talking (or imitate any other sound). Typically, songs which contain texts are short and not repetitive, such as: [...] "It's <b>a</b> <b>bad</b> <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> be an old man", (Nettl, 1989, p.73, 1951 recording of a Crazy Dog Society song) or the relatively lengthy, [...] "Yonder woman, you must take me. I am powerful. Yonder woman, you must take me, you must hear me. Where I sit is powerful." [...] (Nettl, 1989, p.73, Wissler and Duvall 1909:85 sung by a rock to a woman in the buffalo-rock myth). Often when the text takes up most of the melody with fewer vocables the melodies are short. The vocables used, as in Plains Indian singing, are the consonants h, y, w, and vowels. They avoid n, c (ts) and other consonants. i and e tend slightly to be higher in pitch, a, o, and u lower (p.71). (Nettl, 1989) ...|$|E

5000|$|The {{reversal}} test {{was introduced in}} the context of the bioethics of human enhancement by Nick Bostrom and Toby Ord.

The {{reversal test}} attempts to do this by asking whether it would be a good thing if the trait was decreased: An example given is that if someone objects that an increase in intelligence would be <b>a</b> <b>bad</b> <b>thing</b> due <b>to</b> more dangerous weapons being made etc., the objector to that position would then ask [...] "Shouldn't we decrease intelligence then?" ...|$|R
