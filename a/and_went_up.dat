5|$|On September 8, 1913, the Army and Navy Union {{began its}} sixteenth {{biennial}} national encampment convention in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Some {{of the delegates}} took a river steamer trip the next day <b>and</b> <b>went</b> <b>up</b> the Delaware River from the Arch street wharf to Port Richmond. They were shown various piers and shipbuilding yards and stopped at League Island. Colonel H. Ogden Lake was presented as the next commander of the national organization, since Commander Downs retired from the position. There were about a thousand delegates that attended this convention.|$|E
5|$|The next possession, Kansas' John Parker {{stole the}} ball and crossed half court when coach Harp called a timeout. Chamberlain {{received}} {{the ball in the}} post, went up for a shot and received some contact; however, no referee called a foul and the ball rolled out of bounds off Carolina. The next play, Elstun was run into by a Tar Heel and went to the line for two shots with 31 seconds remaining, where he missed the first and made the second shot. Out of timeouts, Kearns drove into the lane and put up a shot that was blocked out of bounds by Chamberlain. The following play, Quigg pumpfaked <b>and</b> <b>went</b> <b>up</b> for a shot that Chamberlain blocked; however, simultaneously King made contact with Quigg's body while shooting and the referees called a shooting foul. Quigg went to the free throw line for two shots with six seconds to go and made both, which gave the Tar Heels the lead 5453. Kansas called a timeout and in-bounded to Loneski who then passed the ball towards Chamberlain who was under the basket. The pass was under thrown and Quigg tipped the ball away from Chamberlain. Kearns grabbed {{the ball and}} got away from a defender before he threw the ball into the air to run out the clock. Time expired as the ball was in the air and the Tar Heels won the National Championship.|$|E

25|$|Meanwhile, Moore {{built the}} Alaskan {{and took her}} up to the Stikine, which he now had to himself for the 1885 season of navigation. In 1886, Moore heard the call of gold again <b>and</b> <b>went</b> <b>up</b> to the Yukon River.

High Wood, which had held up the British for two months, was finally taken, but casualties were so heavy that 141 Bde had to be reorganised into a composite battalion.|$|E
25|$|A {{fight against}} Roberto Durán followed. Durán {{was the first}} {{challenger}} to last the distance with Hagler in a world-championship bout. Durán was the WBA Light Middleweight Champion <b>and</b> <b>went</b> <b>up</b> in weight to challenge for Hagler's middleweight crown. Hagler won a unanimous 15-round decision, although after 13 rounds, Duran was ahead by one point on two scorecards and even on the third.

25|$|During 2010, Johnson {{managed to}} win his fifth {{consecutive}} championship, becoming the third driver who made up points to win the title since 1975. During the season, he scored two poles, 17 top fives, 23 top tens and six victories. He also remained the only driver {{to qualify for the}} Chase every year since its inception in 2004. He became the 12th, and currently the last driver, to win 50+ NASCAR races when he won at Bristol in March, <b>and</b> <b>went</b> <b>up</b> to 10th on the all-time wins list. Johnson was also named Driver of the Year for the fourth time in his career, joining Gordon as the only drivers to win the award that many times. He also managed to win Tony Stewart's charity race, the Prelude to the Dream, his first victory on a dirt oval.|$|E
25|$|The Protestant army laid siege {{to several}} {{cities in the}} Poitou and Saintonge regions (to protect La Rochelle), and then Angoulême and Cognac. At the Battle of Jarnac (16 March 1569), the Prince de Condé was killed, forcing Admiral de Coligny to take command of the Protestant forces. Coligny and his troops retreated to the {{south-west}} and regrouped with Gabriel, comte de Montgomery, and in spring of 1570 they pillaged Toulouse, cut {{a path through the}} south of France <b>and</b> <b>went</b> <b>up</b> the Rhone valley to La Charité-sur-Loire. The staggering royal debt and Charles IX's desire to seek a peaceful solution led to the Peace of Saint-Germain-en-Laye (8 August 1570), which once more allowed some concessions to the Huguenots. In 1572, rising tensions between local Catholics and Protestant forces attending the wedding of the Protestant Henry of Navarre, and the King's sister, Marguerite de Valois, culminated in the Saint Bartholomew's Day Massacre. This led to the Fourth and Fifth Civil wars in 1572 and 1573-1576.|$|E

25|$|In the {{original}} 1925 {{plan for the}} U.S. Highway System, US9 was designated along {{the west bank of}} the Hudson River from the New Jersey line to Albany, utilizing then-NY10. North of Albany, US9 mostly followed NY6 to Canada. The lone deviation was from Elizabethtown to Keeseville, where US9 was routed on a previously unnumbered highway to the east instead. NY6 east of the Hudson (up to Rensselaer) and a further extension to Glens Falls via Troy, Mechanicville, and Schuylerville was designated as US109. The alignment of US9 within New York remained unchanged in the final system alignment approved on November11, 1926. However, when US9 was commissioned in New York in 1927, the US109 designation had been dropped and was signed instead as US9E, but only up to Waterford. The segment on {{the west bank of the}} Hudson from New Jersey to Waterford was redesignated as US9W, with the split routes meeting in Waterford. From there, unsuffixed US9 began (still along NY6) <b>and</b> <b>went</b> <b>up</b> to the Canadian border via Rouses Point as planned in 1925.|$|E
25|$|The August {{session of}} the Assembly {{was the last to}} be held in Newport for the next four years, with the pending {{occupation}} of Aquidneck Island (Rhode Island) by British Forces. In December 1776 seven ships and four frigates under the command of Sir Peter Parker appeared off Block Island <b>and</b> <b>went</b> <b>up</b> the sound to join a fleet of 70 transports with about 6000 troops, destined for Newport. Summons went out from the colony to as far as New Hampshire for aid. Women and children in seaboard towns had already been advised to move, with their furniture, to the interior, and livestock was driven off from the larger islands. Rhode Island had about 700 troops on the island when the enemy landed at Middletown. After a night of pillaging, the British troops marched into Newport on December 8 under the command of General Clinton. The Rhode Island troops left the island, moving to Tiverton and Bristol. Assistance poured in from neighboring states, and the Americans assumed defensible positions {{on each side of the}} bay.|$|E
25|$|Douglas {{argued that}} the {{tabernacle}} ran horizontally toward the most sacred area, Mount Sinai went up vertically to the summit, and the sacrificial pile started with the head underneath <b>and</b> <b>went</b> <b>up</b> to the entrails, and one can interpret each by reference to the others. Douglas noted that in mystical thought, “upper” and “inner” can be equivalent. The pattern is always there throughout creation, with God in the depths or on the heights of everything. Likening the tabernacle to a body, the innards corresponded to the Holy of Holies, for the Bible locates the emotions and thought in the innermost parts of the body; the loins are wrung with remorse or grief; God scrutinizes the innermost part; compassion resides in the bowels. The Tabernacle was associated with creation, and creation with fertility, implying that the innermost part of the Tabernacle was a Divine nuptial chamber, depicting the union between God and Israel. Douglas concluded that {{the summit of the}} mountain was the abode of God, below was the cloudy region that only Moses could enter, and the lower slopes were where the priests and congregation waited, and analogously, the order of placing the parts of the animal on the altar marked out three zones on the carcass, the suet set around and below the diaphragm corresponding to the cloud girdling the middle of the mountain.|$|E

25|$|Starting {{with the}} release of Jose Luis Real as coach in October 2011, Chivas {{struggled}} to maintain form finding themselves with 9 coaches being hired and released in the past 3 years. The club was in danger of being relegated to the second division {{for the first time in}} their history. In February 2012, Johan Cruyff was hired as the team's advisor. Nine months later the club sacked him, mainly due to the fact that the team was not improving. On 22 November 2013 Guadalajara placed multiple important players on the transfer list: Marco Fabián, Miguel Ponce, and veterans Luis Michel and Héctor Reynoso. On 25 November 2013, it was confirmed that Jose Luis Real would return to C.D. Guadalajara as head coach. Real showed improvement in the squad but was soon released after the team lost 4–0 at home to rivals Club América. On 2 April 2014, veteran manager Ricardo La Volpe was appointed as head coach. He was immediately released on 30 April 2014 supposedly due to having inappropriate conduct with a female staff member who later took legal action against him. On 12 May 2014, Carlos Bustos was appointed as head coach. On 2 October 2014, Bustos resigned after a 3–1 loss to Club Toluca. He left the team with two wins, four draws, and four losses. On 7 October 2014, former Mexico national team manager José Manuel de la Torre was appointed as head coach. The club started the 2015 season with a 2–1 loss against Chiapas, and this result caused them to become tied in the last position of the Liga MX relegation table with Puebla. The very next week the club showed better character after a 2–1 win at home against Pumas UNAM in front of a very supportful, sold out crowd of fans. By game 12 of the 2015 Clausura season, Guadalajara managed to earn 21 points after winning crucial matches against teams such as Monterrey and relegation rivals Puebla. José Manuel de la Torre's strategic 4–2–3–1 formation proved effect during matches despite the fans' constant requests to use two strikers in the starting line-up. In game 13 of the season, Guadalajara defeated Club León in the Estadio Omnilife's 100th official match <b>and</b> <b>went</b> <b>up</b> to 1st place with 24 points. José Manuel de la Torre's effectiveness rose to 62.1%, the highest rate in the Clausura 2015 season. The club finished the 2015 Clausura in fifth place with the third best defense of the season, thus, qualifying to the playoffs for the first time since 2012. The team started the 2015 Apertura season with 4 points in 6 games and a squad plagued with injuries. On 14 September 2015, the club announced they had released De la Torre.|$|E

500|$|Races {{gradually}} became more formalised, and regulations were introduced prohibiting colleges from using professional rowers {{or members of}} other colleges. A race for the colleges' second boats (Torpids) was introduced in 1826, and eventually boats with less than eight oars {{were excluded from the}} races. During the late 1820s and early 1830s, Jesus did not take part in races, but the college was mentioned as having a second boat by 1836. The formal foundation of the club dates from 1835, and official records of inter-college races begin in 1837. The Jesus College 1st VIII started the competition that year in second position, behind the Christ Church 1st VIII, but after being bumped on successive nights by Exeter, Balliol and Queen's colleges, Jesus took no further part in that year's competition. In 1838, the Jesus College boat rowed in last place on one evening, but did not participate in the races again until 1844. The club's fortunes varied in the years thereafter. In 1859, the eight achieved an unusual [...] "overbump" [...] (catching the crew that had started three places ahead of them, after the boat immediately ahead of it had bumped the boat it was chasing) and so went up three positions in one race. However, the college boat did not compete in 1860 and it finished in last place in 1864. From 1864 onwards, said Ernest Hardy (in his 1899 history of the college), [...] "the boating record of the College has not been good"– the college did not take part in the races in many years, and it seldom improved its position by {{more than one or two}} places when it did participate. The college resumed regular participation in the races in 1882; although it was in last place in 1889, the college improved its position, <b>and</b> <b>went</b> <b>up</b> by nine places between 1894 and 1896. Hardy also commented that the 1896 Jesus College boat had a reputation of being one of the faster boats in the university. The crew entered for the Ladies' Challenge Plate at the Henley Regatta, but lost to Eton, the eventual winners.|$|E
