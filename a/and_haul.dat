5|$|Later, in Walter Skinner's (Mitch Pileggi) office, Mulder {{begins to}} doubt once more {{that they are}} free at all, asking Scully to name any sort of drug that causes its effects to halt once users know they are hallucinating. Scully is in disbelief until Mulder proves his point by {{shooting}} Skinner in the chest; the yellow substance oozes out of the bullet wounds. Once again, their surroundings melt away as they awaken underground again in the cave. Mulder sticks his hand through the earth ceiling as Skinner {{and a team of}} rescue staff manage to locate them and drag them out <b>and</b> <b>haul</b> them to the safety of an ambulance. Once inside the ambulance, Mulder and Scully weakly hold hands.|$|E
5|$|On 17 June, Nymphe was {{cruising}} alone off the Devon coast under Captain Edward Pellew when a sail {{appeared to}} the south east. Closing to investigate, Pellew rapidly identified the ship as Cléopâtre and gave chase, the French frigate initially fleeing but Captain Jean Mullon then turning to fight as Nymphe began to overtake his ship. At 06:15, with both crews cheering loudly, the frigates exchanged broadsides, the action lasting 50 minutes. Both ships fought hard, but at 07:10 the British crew were able to successfully board the French frigate <b>and</b> <b>haul</b> down the tricolour. Mullon was mortally wounded in the engagement, and his crew lost 63 casualties compared to 50 on board Nymphe. Pellew returned to Britain with his prize, the first major French warship captured during the conflict, and was proclaimed a hero.|$|E
5|$|The redback {{is mainly}} nocturnal; the female remains {{concealed}} during the day, and spins her web during the night, usually {{remaining in the}} same location {{for most of her}} adult life. Classified as a gum-footed tangle web, the web is an irregular-looking tangle of fine but strong silk. Although the threads seem random, they are strategically placed for support and entrapment of prey. The rear portion of the web forms a funnel-like retreat area where the spider and egg sacs are found. This area has vertical, sticky catching threads that run to ground attachments. The vertical strands act as trip wires to initially alert the spider to the presence of prey or threats. They also snare <b>and</b> <b>haul</b> prey into the air when weaker horizontal strands that hold them down, known as guy lines, break when prey thrash around. These webs are usually placed between two flat surfaces, one beneath the other. The female spends more time in the funnel and less time moving around during cooler weather.|$|E

25|$|The {{principal}} waste-waters {{associated with}} mines and quarries are slurries of rock particles in water. These arise from rainfall washing exposed surfaces <b>and</b> <b>haul</b> roads {{and also from}} rock washing and grading processes. Volumes of water can be very high, especially rainfall related arisings on large sites. Some specialized separation operations, such as coal washing to separate coal from native rock using density gradients, can produce wastewater contaminated by fine particulate haematite and surfactants. Oils and hydraulic oils are also common contaminants.|$|E
25|$|Coastal fishing fleets that hunt {{dolphins}} use {{many small}} boats in a coordinated effort. The fishermen bang metal poles {{in the water}} in order to frighten and therefore guide noise-sensitive dolphins toward the shore. A series of nets are then used to corral the dolphins in. Divers and fishermen in boats next lance or cut the throats of the dolphins <b>and</b> <b>haul</b> them away to a nearby shore station for processing. A few dolphins are selected for sale to aquariums and spared for the marine aquarium (dolphinarium) entertainment industry.|$|E
25|$|At first light, the Austrians began assaulting {{the trapped}} Frenchmen, sending attack after {{attack against the}} {{cemetery}}. One charge broke into the church and liberated all the prisoners. Another thrust by the Simbschen Infantry managed to force {{its way into the}} cemetery <b>and</b> <b>haul</b> away one of the two cannons before being driven off. When the attackers seized an eagle, a much-decorated French sergeant waded into a group of Austrians and retook it. There were many other acts of heroism during the 16-hour defense of the position. Finally, the 84th began to run low on ammunition.|$|E

Then after New York scored on quarterback Ken O'Brien's 11-yard {{touchdown}} pass to running back Johnny Hector, Franklin kicked his second field goal from 41 yards. Late in the second quarter, safety Fred Marion intercepted a pass from O'Brien and returned it 26 yards to the Jets 33-yard line. A few plays later, Jets defensive back Russell Carter failed to make contact with receiver Stanley Morgan while trying to jam him at the line of scrimmage, enabling Morgan to take off past Carter <b>and</b> <b>haul</b> in a 36-yard touchdown completion from Tony Eason, giving New England a 13–7 halftime lead.|$|E
25|$|Handliners – are {{normally}} undecked vessels used for handlining (fishing {{with a line}} and hook). Handliners include canoes and other small or medium-sized vessels. Traditional handliners are less than 12 metres o/a, {{and do not have}} special gear handling, there is no winch or gurdy. Locating fish is left to the fishermen's personal knowledge of fishing grounds rather than the use of special electronic equipment. Non traditional handliners can set <b>and</b> <b>haul</b> using electrical or hydraulic powered reels. These mechanised reels {{are normally}} fastened to the gunwale or set on stanchions close to or overhanging the gunwale. They operate all over the world, some in shallow waters, some fishing up to 300 metres deep. No typical deck arrangement exists for handliners.|$|E
25|$|Drift nets {{are usually}} used to catch {{schooling}} forage fish such as herring and sardines, and also larger pelagic fish such as tuna, salmon and pelagic squid. Net haulers are usually {{used to set}} <b>and</b> <b>haul</b> driftnets, with a drifter capstan on the forepart of the vessel. In developing countries most nets are hauled by hand. The mesh size of the gillnets is very effective at selecting or regulating the size of fish caught. The drift net has a low fuel/fish energy consumption compared to other fishing gear. However, the issue of concern {{with this type of}} net is the bycatch of species that are not targeted, such as marine mammals, seabirds and to a minor extent turtles. The use of drift nets longer than 2.5 kilometres on the high seas was banned by the United Nations in 1991. Prior to this ban, drift nets were reaching lengths of 60 kilometres. However, there are still serious concerns with ongoing violations.|$|E

25|$|Entering the 1969–70 season, Chappell hit four {{hundreds}} {{to earn a}} {{place on}} an Australian A trip to New Zealand. Scoring 519 runs at 57.70, he was the dominant batsman of the tour and with the Test team failing in South Africa, he only needed a solid start to the next season to force his way in to play against England in the 1970–71 Ashes Series. After acting as twelfth man in the first Test, he was selected to bat at number seven for the second match, the first Test played at Perth's WACA ground. During an historic century on debut, he teamed with Ian Redpath to add 219 runs <b>and</b> <b>haul</b> Australia out of a difficult situation. Just days after the Test, he belted 102 in two hours against the English in a tour match. However, the dream start affected Chappell, who struggled {{for the rest of}} the series, apart from a score of 65 in the last Test. In the main, he was getting out by playing too many big shots early in his innings.|$|E

The Lehigh Valley's top New York City-Ithaca-Buffalo passenger train, [...] "The Black Diamond", was optimistically publicized as 'The Handsomest Train in the World', perhaps to compensate for its roundabout route to Buffalo. It was named after the railroad's largest commodity, anthracite coal.|$|E
2500|$|Tales {{from other}} parts of Germany make mine kobolds {{beneficial}} creatures, at least if they are treated respectfully. Nineteenth-century miners in Bohemia and Hungary reported hearing knocking in the mines. They interpreted such noises as warnings from the kobolds to not go in that direction. Other miners claimed that the knocks indicated where veins of metal could be found: the more knocks, the richer the vein. In 1884, spiritualist Emma Hardinge Britten reported a story from a Madame Kalodzy, who claimed to have heard mine kobolds while visiting a peasant named Michael Engelbrecht: [...] "On the three first days after our arrival, we only heard a few dull knocks, sounding in and about the mouth of the mine, as if produced by some vibrations or very distant blows..." [...] Kobolds are sometimes portrayed as being indifferent to human miners, so long as they are left alone. In these depictions, they are content to simply mine ore themselves, collect it, <b>and</b> <b>haul</b> it away by windlass.|$|E
