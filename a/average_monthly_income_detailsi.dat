30|$|Though it was {{observed}} that nearly all of the women had no formal book keeping system for their business transactions, they were able to report on their <b>monthly</b> generated <b>income</b> (Akinbami, 2015). Despite the well-known challenges in gathering estimates of <b>monthly</b> <b>income</b> for rural farmers through questionnaire survey methods, the findings indicate some clear patterns which appear consistent with other studies. According to the women interviewed, a greater percentage of <b>income</b> generated <b>monthly,</b> concentrated around ₦ 10, 000 and ₦ 20, 000, that is, <b>average</b> <b>monthly</b> <b>income.</b> About 10.6 % of the total respondents earned less than ₦ 5000 <b>average</b> <b>monthly</b> <b>income,</b> while 17 % earned between ₦ 5000 - ₦ 10, 000 and less than one tenth of the respondents earned above ₦ 20, 000 <b>monthly.</b> The mean <b>average</b> <b>monthly</b> <b>income</b> was about ₦ 7500.

This again could be the reason why most of the women’s livelihood practices remain at the micro level, since there is a lack of sufficient capital for expansion.

Three different zones namely, Low Density (LD), Medium Density (MD) and High Density (HD) were considered,, both close-ended and open-ended questionnaire were administered to 900 households representing 75 % of the total population. Using Statistical Package for Social Sciences version 16 data were analyzed and binomial logistic regression analysis was used in developing a model which showed that only academic qualification of household head, number of household members and <b>average</b> <b>monthly</b> <b>income</b> of household significantly influences motorcycle ownership across the zones at the 95 % confidence level.

The results shows that there is a 1. 43 times likelihood of owning a motorcycle with a unit increase in the number of household members, while there is a reduction in the likelihood of owning a motorcycle by 1. 66 times and 2. 17 times for a unit increase in the <b>average</b> <b>monthly</b> <b>income</b> and academic qualification of household head respectively.
