Krypton costs about 100 {{times as much as}} argon. Krypton (along with xenon) is also used to fill incandescent lamps to reduce filament evaporation and allow higher operating temperatures. A brighter light results with more blue color than conventional incandescent lamps.|$|E

5|$|A small species, the Inaccessible Island rail has brown plumage {{and a black}} {{bill and}} feet. It {{occupies}} most habitats on Inaccessible Island, from the beaches to the central plateau, feeding {{on a variety of}} small invertebrates and also some plant matter. Pairs are territorial and monogamous, with both parents being responsible for incubating the eggs <b>and</b> <b>raising</b> <b>the</b> chicks. Its adaptations to living on a tiny island at high densities include low base metabolic rates, small clutch sizes, and flightlessness.|$|E

5|$|The Nazi anti-tobacco {{campaign}} included banning {{smoking in}} trams, buses and city trains, promoting health education, limiting cigarette rations in the Wehrmacht, organizing medical lectures for soldiers, <b>and</b> <b>raising</b> <b>the</b> tobacco tax. The National Socialists also imposed restrictions on tobacco advertising and smoking in public spaces, and regulated restaurants and coffeehouses. The anti-tobacco movement {{did not have}} much effect {{in the early years of}} the Nazi regime and tobacco use increased between 1933 and 1939, but smoking by military personnel declined from 1939 to 1945. Even by the end of the 20th century, the anti-smoking movement in postwar Germany had not attained the influence of the Nazi anti-smoking campaign.|$|E
5|$|The storm {{produced}} widespread rainfall in the Southeastern United States, {{accompanied by}} gale-force winds along the coast, and ships reported severe conditions at sea. High tides occurred around St. Augustine, Florida, washing over the South Street Causeway. Winds {{from the storm}} dispersed large amounts of dead grass from marshes in the area. No significant damage was reported due to thorough warnings before the cyclone. A 2005 reanalysis of the storm made some minor changes to its listing in the official hurricane database, setting back the time of formation <b>and</b> <b>raising</b> <b>the</b> peak intensity.|$|E

5|$|After the {{government}} of Nova Scotia established a lifesaving station on Sable Island in 1801, workers trained some of the horses to haul supplies and rescue equipment. Lifesaving staff recorded the importation of a stallion, Jolly, taken there in 1801, who was probably similar in type to the original Acadian horses released on the island. Although Jolly {{was not the first}} horse on the island, {{he was the first to}} be identified by name in historic records, and is known to have survived on the island until at least 1812. Other breeding stock, probably including horses of Thoroughbred, Morgan and Clydesdale breeding, were sent to the island during the first half of the 19th century, in the hopes of improving the type of horses found on the island <b>and</b> <b>raising</b> <b>the</b> price for which they could be sold on the mainland.|$|E
5|$|David Hudson (February 17, 1761– March 17, 1836) was an American {{businessman}} {{noted for}} founding Hudson Township, the present-day Hudson, Ohio. Hudson {{was born in}} Branford, Connecticut and lived there until the age four when {{his family moved to}} Goshen, Connecticut. He lived in Goshen for many years, owning a farm, marrying Anna Norton in 1783 <b>and</b> <b>raising</b> <b>the</b> oldest seven of their nine children there. In 1789, Hudson joined a group to purchase a parcel of land in the Connecticut Western Reserve. The following year, he left Goshen to survey the parcel and settle it as Hudson Township. Hudson traveled through the state of New York, west along Lake Erie and south along the Cuyahoga River to reach his land.|$|E
5|$|Females become {{sexually mature}} at eight months, but mate no earlier than two years. Males mature later, at one-and-a-half years. Mating takes place {{throughout}} the year; peaks occur during {{spring and fall}} in Texas. Two peaks have been observed in India: from August to October and from March to April. Rutting males aggressively establish and defend their territories from other males, giving out loud grunts and engaging in serious head-to-head fights, pushing each other using horns. Aggressive display consists of thrusting the neck forward and raising it, folding the ears <b>and</b> <b>raising</b> <b>the</b> tail. The dominant male pursues the female with his nose pointing upward, smells her urine and shows a flehmen response. The female shows her receptivity by waving her tail and thumping the hindlegs on the ground. This is followed by several mounting attempts, and copulation. The whole process may {{last as long as}} six hours. The female will remain still for some time after copulation, following which she may start grazing. The male may then move on to mate with another female.|$|E

5|$|The {{goldcrest}} is monogamous. The male sings {{during the}} breeding season, usually while foraging {{rather than from}} a perch. It has a display involving bowing its head towards another bird <b>and</b> <b>raising</b> <b>the</b> coloured crest. Firecrests will sometimes defend their territories against goldcrests, but the amount of actual competition between the species may not be very great. A Spanish study suggested that territorial conflicts between species, and other phenomena like males singing mixed or alternating songs, were most frequent when one species locally far outnumbered the other; in other circumstances, the two species learned to ignore each other's songs. However, in very small areas of conifers it is rare for the goldcrest and the firecrest to share territories; either {{one or the other}} is present, but not both. A male goldcrest will defend his territory against either species, sometimes including some firecrest phrases in his song.|$|E
5|$|The {{large amount}} of CO2 in the {{atmosphere}} together with water vapour and sulfur dioxide create a strong greenhouse effect, trapping solar energy <b>and</b> <b>raising</b> <b>the</b> surface temperature to around 740K (467°C), hotter than any other planet in the Solar System, even that of Mercury despite being located farther out from the Sun and receiving only 25% of the solar energy (per unit area) Mercury does. The average temperature on the surface is above the melting points of lead (600K, 327°C), tin (505K, 232°C), and zinc (693K, 420°C). The thick troposphere also makes the difference in temperature between {{the day and night}} side small, even though the slow retrograde rotation of the planet causes a single solar day to last 116.5 Earth days. The surface of Venus spends 58.3 days of darkness before the sun rises again behind the clouds.|$|E
5|$|During {{his service}} as {{lieutenant}} governor, Beshear formed and chaired the Kentucky Tomorrow Commission, a privately financed group assembled {{to make recommendations}} for the state's future growth and development. The 30-person commission was formed in July 1984 and presented its report – containing more than 100 recommendations – in September 1986. Among the recommendations in the commission's report were several changes to the state constitution, adopted in 1891. The recommended changes included eliminating the offices of state treasurer, {{secretary of state and}} superintendent of public instruction, holding elections only in odd-numbered years instead of every year, <b>and</b> <b>raising</b> <b>the</b> term limit for the state's constitutional officers from one term to two consecutive terms. The state legislature showed little interest in calling a constitutional convention, however, and the commission's recommendations were not immediately adopted, though several have since been implemented. Other recommendations in the commission's report included the creation of lifelong learning programs, implementation of criminal justice reforms, and improvements in worker training. The commission was hailed by some as the most substantial undertaking by a lieutenant governor to date, but was panned by others as a move by Beshear to better position himself for a run for governor in 1987.|$|E
