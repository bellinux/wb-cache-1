To overcome these issues, storage options will need to be introduced into the distribution network with benefits for both demand management and power systems quality. How this can be utilised most effectively within the distribution network will allow for an even greater proportion of our energy demand to be met through renewable resources and meet the <b>aspirational</b> <b>targets</b> set.

40|$|Strategies {{to reduce}} excess salt {{consumption}} {{play an important}} role in preventing cardiovascular disease, which is the largest contributor to global mortality from non-communicable diseases. In many countries, voluntary food reformulation programs seek to reduce salt levels across selected product categories, guided by <b>aspirational</b> <b>targets</b> to be achieved progressively over time. This paper evaluates the industry-led salt reduction programs that operate in the United Kingdom and Australia. Drawing on theoretical concepts from the field of regulatory studies, we propose a step-wise or “responsive” approach that introduces regulatory “scaffolds” to progressively increase levels of government oversight and control in response to industry inaction or under-performance. Our model makes full use of the food industry’s willingness to reduce salt levels in products to meet reformulation targets, but recognizes that governments remain accountable for addressing major diet-related health risks. Creative regulatory strategies can assist governments to fulfill their public health obligations, including in circumstances where there are political barriers to direct, statutory regulation of the food industry...|$|R
40|$|On {{the face}} of it, the 1990 s have marked the {{transformation}} of the UK's waste management policy. A commitment to waste minimisation and recycling, within the terms of the internationally accepted waste hierarchy, have replaced an almost complacent defence of landfill. However, aside from the dramatic transformation of the vocabulary, the reality of local authority waste disposal has, with a few notable exceptions, been characterised more by continuity than revolution. This article suggests that the modesty of local authority recycling is best explained through an appreciation of what can be described as recycling practice. Recycling in the UK has taken a distinctive form comprising: environmentalism, entrepreneurialism and policy advocacy. The components of this practice explain both the successes and failures of local authority recycling. Despite its oppositional roots, the Conservative Government found ‘recycling practice’ conducive to their reliance upon a mix of <b>aspirational</b> <b>targets</b> and market‐based instruments (MBIs). Advice circulated as guidance to local authorities emphasised viability as the principal criterion of scheme assessment and in such a way sustained the limited scale and ambitions of recycling practice...|$|R

About one in four patients admitted to hospital are prescribed at least one inappropriate medication and up to 20 % of all inpatient deaths are attributed to potentially preventable ADR. Lists of drugs to avoid (unnecessary or where risks outweigh benefits) and drugs not to be omitted (strong indications if there are no contraindications) can assist in identifying suboptimal prescribing although, to date, no trials have established the ability of such screening, by itself, to improve prescribing quality. Remedial strategies proven to be effective in randomized trials include detailed appraisal of medication lists by multidisciplinary teams, which involve geriatricians and close liaison with specialist clinical pharmacists. A multifaceted quality improvement strategy is proposed that includes an <b>aspirational</b> <b>target</b> of no more than five different drugs be regularly prescribed to vulnerable older patients. Achieving this target involves prioritizing drug selection on the basis of strength of indication which may run counter to current disease-specific clinical guideline recommendations based on trials that have excluded most older patients.

Industrialisation, urbanisation and population growth have resulted in changed relationships between many human communities and the natural world. A potential consequence is a compromised capability to make well-informed decisions about how to live sustainably. To gain a measure of ecological literacy within the South Australian community, we collaborated with senior scientists and educators to develop and apply an instrument with the capacity to determine indicative levels of ecological knowledge {{and understanding}}. A formal, variable credit, multiple-choice assessment instrument was distributed online to groups and individuals within diverse community sectors and industries. Quantitative analyses of scores indicated that levels of ecological knowledge and understanding within a self-selected sample of over one thousand individuals ranged from very low to extremely high, {{with the majority of}} respondents achieving moderate to high scores.

40|$|Uncertainty {{about future}} spread of {{invasive}} organisms hinders planning of effective response measures. We present a two-stage scenario optimization model {{that accounts for}} uncertainty about the spread of an invader, and determines survey and eradication strategies that minimize the expected program cost subject to a safety rule for eradication success. The safety rule includes a risk standard for the desired probability of eradication in each invasion scenario. Because the risk standard may not be attainable in every scenario, the safety rule defines a minimum proportion of scenarios with successful eradication. We apply the model {{to the problem of}} allocating resources to survey and eradicate the Asian longhorned beetle (ALB, Anoplophora glabripennis) after its discovery in the Greater Toronto Area, Ontario, Canada. We use historical data on ALB spread to generate a set of plausible invasion scenarios that characterizes the uncertainty of the beetle's extent. We use these scenarios in the model to find survey and tree removal strategies that minimize the expected program cost while satisfying the safety rule. We also identify strategies that reduce the risk of very high program costs. Our results reveal two alternative strategies: (i) delimiting surveys and subsequent tree removal based on the surveys' outcomes, or (ii) preventive host tree removal without referring to delimiting surveys. The second strategy is more likely to meet the stated objectives when the capacity to detect an invader is low or the aspirations to eradicate it are high. Our results provide practical guidelines to identify the best management strategy given <b>aspirational</b> <b>targets</b> for eradication and spending...|$|R
40|$|Turbine discs {{experience}} {{a range of}} temperature and load conditions in service, but the increasing operating temperatures expected for new, more efficient engine designs, mean that increasingly their time-dependent fatigue response is of more and more importance. A variety of alloying and heat treatment approaches have now been developed to improve the high temperature fatigue performance of turbine disc alloys (whilst maintaining an appropriate balance of their other required properties). In this study {{we have reviewed the}} microstructures achieved in a range of sub-solvus and super-solvusheat treated PM alloys: U 720 Li, RR 1000, N 18 and LSHR alloys. The microstructures are examined in terms of grain and gamma prime size (?') variations, whilst fatigue crack growth (FCG) rates for all materials have been obtained at 650 ºC and 725 ºC in air and in vacuum. These show that RR 1000 provides the best performance at the most severe conditions, i. e. the highest temperatures and longest dwells. In general failure modes become increasingly intergranular with increasing temperature and ?K. Some of the variations in FCG rate between the alloys are due to reduction in grain boundary oxidation processes with increased grain size, but more subtle interplays between grain boundary character, alloy composition and slip character are also clearly important. The comparison between air and vacuum conditions is especially helpful in separating out creep and environmental contributions, and the vacuum conditions have some service relevance for sub-surface defect growth. An apparent activation energy analysis approach is also presented to further assess the micromechanistic variations between these alloys. This allows a more explicit analysis of the mechanistic dependence of F. C. G rate changes between these two temperatures, where 650 oC (a current possible service temperature) is compared to 725 oC (a much higher, <b>aspirational.</b> <b>target</b> service temperature) ...|$|E

Second, to analyze whether the companies also increase their disclosure using several highlighting device to draw direct attention of the readers. Third, to analyze the tendency of carbon footprints disclosure practices of aerospace and airlines companies listed in Forbes 2000 in 2011 and 2013. To achieve the objectives, the right method used should be content analysis. Content analysis is applied to analyze four type of disclosures; annual reports, sustainability reports, annual reports of annual reporters only, and annual reports of sustainability reporters. There are three set of categories used. The first category is symbolic statement; normative statement, <b>aspirational</b> <b>target,</b> and awards or recognition. Second category is behavioural statement; internal activities, external activities, and assisting others. The third category is any sentence exclude previous categories disclosed in the reports; descriptive statements and other. The sample then selected based on purposive sampling method. The amount of final sample is forty seven companies. The study uses Wilcoxon signed-ranks test as its statistical test. The results showed that generally firms do not increase their carbon footprints disclosure. However, in annual reports of annual reporters only, firms increased their disclosure practices. Companies also did not take a step to signeled their disclosure clearly to stakeholders and generally more like relied on symbolic management approach instead of behavioural management approach, even though there is a small tendency that firms can also rely on behavioural management approach. Further, the study appears to be the first, to the best of author’s knowledges, to provide direct international evidence on favoured impression and legitimacy by analyzing symbolic versus behavioural management...|$|E
40|$|It {{gives me}} great {{pleasure}} to write this Foreword to Dr Dar’s 2011 speeches and presentations. ICRISAT is now one year into implementing its bold Strategic Plan to 2020 to help ensure integrated marketoriented development for prosperous, food-secure and resilient dryland tropics. Change is the leitmotif of ICRISAT and the Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research (CGIAR) and the many countries in which they work. ICRISAT has been constantly reinventing itself and directing its research to tackle mounting challenges and major changes occurring in the external environment. To help orient ICRISAT in the changing world, I am pleased to have witnessed the emergence and adoption of a strong Strategic Plan and the start to its systematic implementation in Asia and sub-Saharan Africa. Although, as the Plan reveals, the issues and their solutions are complex, ICRISAT has the single <b>aspirational</b> <b>target</b> of halving poverty, hunger, malnutrition and reducing environmental degradation in the dryland tropics. The conceptual framework of Inclusive Market- Oriented Development or IMOD spelt out in the Strategic Plan envisages not just the unleashing of the energies of the poor, but also that {{of the people and}} agencies that serve the poor with their science. In striving to become a learning organization, ICRISAT has demonstrated a collective will and commitment to harness novel ideas and channel them towards fulfilling the Institute’s goals. This has been possible through buy-in by staff and partners to the critical ideas and change plans. It has involved not only changing what is done but also how it is done. By adopting, owning and practising shared values and a culture of service, ICRISAT and partners strive to help smallholder farmers in the semiarid tropics map out a prosperous, food-secure and resilient future. ICRISAT also contributes significantly to the reforms and progress being achieved in the CGIAR. The speeches in this compendium reflect the changes that have taken place in ICRISAT and the stabilizing influence of its leadership in providing decisive directions and support. It is an instructive chronology of how an Institute can build on its past while innovating in its transition into the future...|$|E
30|$|Although the {{restoration}} project at Nurcoung is relatively new, results obtained from this study, to date, show that restoration efforts {{appear to be}} promising {{as evidenced by the}} significant number of planted seedlings and broadcast seeds that are established and surviving. As Audet et al. (2013) found, restored sites are travelling on a positive trajectory when the desired ecosystem characteristics are starting to establish there. Some of the desired ecosystem characteristics are now starting to establish in the restored Nurcoung sites. However, it will take a considerable amount of time for this to become a fully functioning ecosystem (Doley and Audet, 2013). It is only then that {{we would be able to}} determine whether it is a natural or novel system (Shackelford et al., 2013 a; Shackelford et al., 2013 b). As Monie et al. (2013) pointed out in their conclusion, seedling recruitment is one of the useful parameters in detecting development trends towards a sustainable restoration target, but it will be some time before we could determine any long-term resemblance to the pre-disturbance conditions. Restoring native biodiversity and ecosystem function among degraded landscapes is, of course, technically and financially demanding (Menz et al., 2013). Hence, it is necessary to assess ongoing ecological trajectories dispassionately and, when possible, using multiple indicators of ecosystem development and resilience. Ultimately, our findings support the convergence of rehabilitated sites toward reference communities. Then again, it should be recognized that, where sites may diverge from intended (or <b>aspirational)</b> <b>targets,</b> intervention should be required to achieve the highest ecological outcome, regardless of whether these are deemed natural, hybrid, or novel (Doley and Audet, 2013; Perring et al., 2013).|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Climate change {{adaptation}} {{education is}} most urgently needed for those nations {{most at risk}} for the impacts of human induced climate change. The most in need include those peoples who have {{the least amount of}} resources including financial, knowledge and time to cope. In this paper, we report on using a methodology designed to evaluate human resource capacity to implement climate change adaptation strategies in three Large Ocean States in the Western Indian Ocean region. The methodology builds on the framework described by Fahey and Meyers (2014). We used qualitative and quantitative methods to evaluate perceptions of human resource capacity building needs among government, nongovernment, private sector, and higher education professionals. We conducted three working groups, one in each of Zanzibar, Seychelles, and Comoros to determine the needs for climate change education. Participants reflected common needs, similar challenges, and shared interests. As would be expected, each nation would begin from a different starting point based on existing expertise and capacity. Analysis of stakeholder’s perceptions from each of the three working groups demonstrates the robustness of our chosen methods for data collection: on-line questionnaires, handwritten survey, and working groups of stakeholders. The use of working groups, comprising stakeholders from multiple sectors provides a valuable format for determining the needs of organisations to build capacity to deliver outcomes aligned with the Mauritius Strategy (2005) and National Climate Change Needs Self-assessment <b>aspirational</b> <b>targets.</b> ecommendations from the pilot assessment include: collaborative selection (between facilitators and national stakeholders) of workshop and focus group participants, well in advance of the activities; electronic distribution of surveys and questionnaires as a priority; and repeated communication with stakeholders regarding project activities and the purpose for the pilot and larger context...|$|R
40|$|The United Kingdom {{has been}} a good example for {{improving}} road safety for decades and a source of inspiration for many countries. A low mortality rate and a low fatality rate have not prevented it from making further progress. The UK was, and still is, a leading country with a reputation for excellent evidence-based road safety policies; brilliant policy documents; good implementation of policies; and the high level of expertise and dedication of its road safety professionals. However, progress has slowed down in recent years, as in many high-motorised and well-performing countries, and {{there is a need for}} new approaches and measures. Two promising lines of development can be identified. The first approach is one of performing better with existing measures and, through optimization and quality assurance, trying to gain more positive effects from these existing measures. This requires a sound and comprehensive monitoring and evaluation system with an emphasis on the ‘dose-response’ relationship. Based on the (annual) monitoring of results it is recommended that an increased level and/or higher quality implementation of existing interventions is considered. It is expected that further progress can be made by doing this. However this would most probably not result in a dramatic decline in the number of fatalities and injuries. Over the last decade this has been the approach favoured in the UK. The second line is to develop strategies to reach very <b>aspirational</b> <b>targets.</b> Here we talk about adopting new visions and make them operational by using interim, empirical based targets. The UK seems to have been hesitant to embark on these high ambition type of approaches, such as developed in Sweden and the Netherlands, and recently documented in the OECD study (2008) : ‘Towards Zero. Ambitious road safety targets and the safe system approach‘. The lecture introduces this new way of thinking and discusses its ‘achievability’, its consequences and implications. This new approach puts the human being (physically and psychologically) at its focal point and attempts to “nudge” human behaviour in a safe direction by creating safe conditions. This will only be possible if all road authorities accept and follow this approach and offer road users predictable, if not self-explaining, roads and credible legislation. The option of less orthodox types will also be discussed given the role that raising awareness and public acceptance by campaigns, education and enforcement has in supporting this ambitious and promising approach.

40|$|At the 21 st {{session of}} the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC, COP 21), a {{voluntary}} action plan, the ‘ 4 per 1000 Initiative: Soils for Food Security and Climate’ was proposed under the Agenda for Action. The Initiative underlines the role of soil organic matter (SOM) in addressing the three-fold challenge of food and nutritional security, {{adaptation to climate change}} and mitigation of human-induced greenhouse gases (GHGs) emissions. It sets an ambitious <b>aspirational</b> <b>target</b> of a 4 per 1000 (i. e. 0. 4 %) rate of annual increase in global soil organic carbon (SOC) stocks, with a focus on agricultural lands where farmers would ensure the carbon stewardship of soils, like they manage day-to-day multipurpose production systems in a changing environment. In this paper, the opportunities and challenges for the 4 per 1000 initiative are discussed. We show that the 4 per 1000 target, calculated relative to global top soil SOC stocks, is consistent with literature estimates of the technical potential for SOC sequestration, though the achievable potential is likely to be substantially lower given socio-economic constraints. We calculate that land-based negative emissions from additional SOC sequestration could significantly contribute to reducing the anthropogenic CO 2 equivalent emission gap identified from Nationally Determined Contributions pledged by countries to stabilize global warming levels below 2  °C or even 1. 5  °C under the Paris agreement on climate. The 4 per 1000 target could be implemented by taking into account differentiated SOC stock baselines, reversing the current trend of huge soil CO 2 losses, e. g. from agriculture encroaching peatland soils. We further discuss the potential benefits of SOC stewardship for both degraded and healthy soils along contrasting spatial scales (field, farm, landscape and country) and temporal (year to century) horizons. Last, we present some of the implications relative to non-CO 2 GHGs emissions, water and nutrients use as well as co-benefits for crop yields and climate change adaptation. We underline the considerable challenges associated with the non-permanence of SOC stocks and show how the rates of adoption and the duration of improved soil management practices could alter the global impacts of practices under the 4 per 1000 initiative. We conclude that the 4 per 1000 initiative has potential to support multiple sustainable development goals (SDGs) of the 2030 Agenda. It can be regarded as no-regret since increasing SOC in agricultural soils will contribute to food security benefits that will enhance resilience to climate change. However, social, economic and environmental safeguards will be needed to ensure an equitable and sustainable implementation of the 4 per 1000 target...|$|E
40|$|Within {{a diverse}} and {{expanding}} system {{of higher education}} (HE), {{such as in the}} UK, discourse on teaching and student learning highlights tensions between different notions of excellence. For example, excellence as a positional good for students, an <b>aspirational</b> <b>target</b> for continuous quality enhancement, a form of reputational advantage for HE institutions or a means of achieving governmental economic and social goals. Concepts of excellence such as these also operate differently {{at the level of the}} individual, the academic unit, the institution and an HE system. Discussion about excellence usually focuses on teaching, and there is much less attention given to excellence in student learning, or even students’ perceptions of excellent teaching. The emphasis tends to be on process and form rather than content; so, what is being taught and learned has become increasingly obscured by concerns over whether teaching and learning are performed excellently. In the literature on pedagogy, there is a large body of writing that employs psychologised understandings of teaching and learning processes and which focuses on micro-level transactions between teachers and students. Though there is some conflicting evidence surrounding the idea of a hierarchy of approaches to learning and teaching – surface, deep and strategic – there seems to be consensus that excellence in pedagogy is associated with more sophisticated conceptions of learning and even, perhaps, of knowledge and its construction. However, it is clear that the dynamics of the relationship between teaching and learning are mediated by students’ perceptions of their environment and by their own motivations to study: excellence in student learning may or may not require excellent teaching. Concepts of teaching excellence are linked to two other notions, viz. the scholarship of teaching and the expert teacher, with some suggestion that excellence should be an attribute of any professional teacher – perhaps confusing excellence with notions of good (enough) teaching or even ‘fitness for purpose’. Much has also been written about institutional mechanisms for recognising and rewarding excellent teaching and the need for these to reflect an institution’s values, missions and culture. A recurring critical theme within the literature contends that the current focus on teaching (and to a lesser extent learning) excellence is symptomatic of a ubiquitous contemporary desire to measure HE performance by means of standardised criteria and quasi-scientific practices. Reinforced by the marketisation of HE and the repositioning of students as consumers, commercial publishers draw on these performance measures to compile institutional rankings, which construct broader notions of ‘excellence’ and ‘world class’ qualities in particular ways. These aggregations of available data appear to be biased towards research reputation and academic prestige, and reduce teaching ‘excellence’ to the numerical ratios between students and academic faculty, and learning to the results of student satisfaction surveys. The biases in favour of particular notions of ‘excellence’ are even more apparent in the increasingly influential world rankings of institutions: with Western, English language and ‘big science’ values predominating. This paper draws on two recent research studies undertaken by the UK Open University’s Centre for Higher Education Research and Information: a review of literature on teaching and learning to elicit conceptions of excellence; and research on league tables (rankings) and their impacts on HE institutions in England. It looks at how the term ‘excellence’ is used in the context of teaching and the student learning experience in: policy documents, research literatures, guidance material and the publicity surrounding commercially published institutional rankings. It examines the key concepts underlying such usage and considers the implications of these for future policies for developing and promoting excellence in a diverse system as it moves beyond mass to universal HE...|$|E
40|$|Although the {{percentage}} of children fully immunised in Australia is high, rates are not uniform {{across the country and}} there are significant variations at the local level. Overview: The third report on child immunisation rates from the National Health Performance Authority finds that while coverage has improved in some local areas, {{there are a number of}} areas where rates remain potentially too low to prevent the spread of diseases. The report shows {{the percentage}}s of children who were fully immunised at 1 year, 2 years and 5 years, as well as the numbers of children who are not fully immunised, in each of the 31 Primary Health Network (PHN) areas. Where possible the results are broken down into smaller geographic areas – including more than 300 statistical areas and across Australian postcodes. The report focuses on variation in immunisation rates for 1 year olds at different levels of geography including changes in immunisation rates over time. In late 2014, the Australian Chief Medical Officer and all state and territory chief health officers agreed to an <b>aspirational</b> <b>target</b> for 95 % of children to be fully immunised in line with the National Immunisation Program Schedule. The report shows that for 1 -year-old children, rates are below 95 % in all PHN areas, although this fact does not reflect on the performance of PHNs as they were set up after the period to which the data relate. The report finds: 	 90. 9 % of all children aged 1, 2 and 5 years were fully immunised and 9. 1 % (84, 571) were not fully immunised, though rates vary across local areas 	 89. 2 % of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children aged 1, 2 and 5 years were fully immunised and 10. 8 % (4, 922) were not fully immunised, though rates vary across local areas 	Immunisation rates for all 1 year olds ranged across PHN areas from 93. 6 % to 87. 7 % with a total of 26, 671 children not fully immunised nationally. None of the 31 PHNs had immunisation rates of 95 % or higher for this age group 	Immunisation rates for 2 year olds ranged across PHN areas from 92. 3 % to 86. 7 % with a total of 33, 681 children not fully immunised nationally. None of the 31 PHNs had immunisation rates of 95 % or above for this age group, although rates for 2 year olds may have been lower due to a recent change in the number of vaccines counted in the definition for ‘fully immunised’ 2 year olds 	Immunisation rates for 5 year olds ranged across PHN areas from 95. 6 % to 89. 2 % with a total of 24, 219 children not fully immunised nationally. Only two of the 31 PHN areas had immunisation rates of 95 % or higher for this age group 	Across smaller local areas (SA 3 s), among all 1 -year-old children, 39 out of 324 local areas (SA 3 s) recorded a significant increase in immunisation rates, while only one area showed a significant decrease. Among 5 year olds, 16 SA 3 s showed an increase and six a decrease 	Immunisation rates for 1 -year-old Indigenous children significantly increased in seven out of 49 geographic areas (SA 4 s) where data were available, and decreased in none.  ...|$|E
40|$|Māori are {{under-represented}} {{across all}} levels of education in New Zealand. Although this trend has improved over time, a gap remains between tertiary education and Māori participation rates. One question is whether universities’ recruitment strategies are targeting Māori students effectively. The focus of this research on Māori was firstly, to identify significant issues which contribute to the weak educational outcomes (particularly regarding participation and completion) and secondly, to explore both why and how university recruitment strategies can target these issues more effectively. A qualitative and comparative research design was developed to explore these topics. In order to provide the research context, the literature review identifies and discusses the political, socio-economic and educational trends for indigenous peoples abroad, then moves to New Zealand and Māori. Semi-structured, open-ended {{interviews were conducted with}} both staff recruiters and students at the same university. The questions were directed towards canvassing their views on university recruitment strategies and their effectiveness in engaging Māori students. This method allowed for both an organisational perspective to be presented (through staff interviews) as well as the views of the recipients (students) of the strategy implementation. A process of thematic analysis was used to distil key findings from the interviews. These findings were discussed in conjunction with the literature presented and the personal experiences and prior research of the researcher. A number of key findings emerged; worldwide, indigenous students are under-represented in higher education and this trend is reflected in New Zealand with Māori being under-represented in tertiary education. Universities are actively seeking to recruit Māori students. These reasons include legislative and moral obligations, as well as to meet <b>aspirational</b> <b>targets.</b> Parallel to universities’ desire to recruit Māori are students’ recruitment experiences. Findings revealed {{that there are a number}} of key influences in students’ decisions. The three key factors universities can use advantageously in their recruitment were: relationships, finance and support. Relationships, finance and support can form a central part of universities’ recruitment strategies and provide a foundation to help universities develop a targeted framework directed towards raising Māori representation in tertiary education. Examples of current recruitment strategies that align with these recommendations are Auckland University of Technology’s Prefect Training Programme- Māori and the Māori Liaison Service. Not all Māori students are struggling to meet academic requirements however, this research has highlighted a number of key factors relevant to the educational experiences of Indigenous students; providing the ‘what’ and ‘why’ universities’ recruitment strategies should target these groups. What remains outstanding is how universities can provide a culturally sensitive framework for recruitment. The experiences of Māori students, as provided through their interviews, have indicated ways in which successful recruitment could be achieved. The thesis recommends the need for universities to plan and implement proactive, successfully positioned recruitment strategies in order to successfully attract Māori students...|$|R
40|$|Background. Influenza (flu) is {{an acute}} viral {{infection}} of the respiratory tract, {{which can lead to}} serious complications for individuals within at-risk groups. Evidence indicates that aspects of organization and delivery within GP practices can have an influence on the rates of flu vaccination uptake. Positive deviance is a methodological approach that facilitates identification of factors associated with high performance. Objective. To use positive deviance to isolate factors associated with high performance by comparing GP practices achieving high and low flu vaccination uptake. Methods. This was a qualitative study. A total of 18 practice managers and 2 GPs from 20 GP practices participated, 10 with high and low vaccination rates, respectively. Telephone interviews were conducted, audio recorded and fully transcribed. Framework Analysis was used to analyse the data. Results. High uptake practices were more likely than low uptake practices to have a lead member of staff who demonstrated tenacity, have <b>aspirational</b> uptake <b>targets,</b> have developed and used additional prompts within their IT systems to identify eligible patients, have GPs who were opportunistically vaccinating and use phone calls as a first-line strategy to invite patients for vaccination. Conclusions. This is the first known qualitative study to identify strategies used by UK GP practices to deliver seasonal flu vaccination programmes. It is one of few studies using the robust and novel approach of positive deviance to inform health care recommendations. This approach has offered new and more nuanced insights into GP practice factors associated high flu vaccination uptake beyond those captured through large-scale survey research...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} was to explore the attitudes and {{associations}} of smoking among adolescents to highlight the implications for the development of social policy. We report the results of a study based on a series of in-depth focus group discussions among school children. Several themes are identified, providing some indication of the susceptibility factors that can lead to smoking behaviour: the perception of infallibility despite knowledge of smoking related diseases; social influences from friends and family; the desire to experiment; and stress. The social policy initiatives recommended include the creation of anti-smoking messaging for cinema audiences in order to counteract the effect of <b>aspirational</b> role models. <b>Targeting</b> anti-smoking education programmes at the primary school level, extending current initiatives addressed at Maori and Pacific Island populations to pre- and primary-school education, and encouraging family involvement in these education programmes are also recommended. The reframing of current physical threatthemed media communication to focus more on social threat themes, and the widening of the media mix to reflect adolescent audience use are believed to be effective. © 2003 Australian and New Zealand Marketing Academy...|$|R
