5|$|On February 15, 1993, Clinton {{made his}} first address to the nation, announcing his plan to raise taxes to close a budget deficit. Two days later, in <b>a</b> <b>nationally</b> <b>televised</b> address to {{a joint session of}} Congress, Clinton {{unveiled}} his economic plan. The plan focused on reducing the deficit rather than on cutting taxes for the middle class, which had been high on his campaign agenda. Clinton's advisers pressured him to raise taxes, based on the theory that a smaller federal budget deficit would reduce bond interest rates.|$|E
5|$|Flanders {{was noted}} for {{introducing}} a 1954 {{motion in the}} Senate to censure Senator Joseph McCarthy. McCarthy had made sensational claims that there were large numbers of Communists and Soviet spies and sympathizers inside {{the federal government and}} elsewhere. He used his Senate committee as <b>a</b> <b>nationally</b> <b>televised</b> forum for attacks on individuals whom he accused. Flanders felt that McCarthy’s attacks distracted the nation from a much greater threat of Communist successes elsewhere in the world and that they had the effect of creating division and confusion within the United States, to the advantage of its enemies. Ultimately, McCarthy's tactics and his inability to substantiate his claims led to his being discredited and censured by the United States Senate.|$|E

5|$|Following the shooting, American and {{international}} politicians expressed grief and condemnations. Gun control advocates pushed for increased {{restrictions on the}} sale of firearms and ammunition, specifically high-capacity ammunition magazines. Some commentators criticized the use of harsh political rhetoric in the United States, with a number blaming the political right wing for the shooting; in particular, Sarah Palin was criticized for a poster by her political action committee that featured stylized crosshairs on an electoral map. Palin rejected claims that she bore responsibility for the shooting, and others defended her by noting that Loughner hated all politicians regardless of their affiliation. President Barack Obama led <b>a</b> <b>nationally</b> <b>televised</b> memorial service on January 12, and other memorials took place.|$|E
5|$|Claire's main storyline {{in season}} 2 is her advocacy, as Second Lady, for {{a sexual assault}} {{prevention}} bill. During her campaign for the bill a skeleton from her college days emerges: during <b>a</b> <b>nationally</b> <b>televised</b> interview, she admits that she was raped in college and that her rapist, Dalton McGinnis (Peter Bradbury), is now a high-ranking general. (She had earlier had an uncomfortable encounter with McGinnis at a White House dinner, during which she had told Frank what the general had done to her.) She also admits to having aborted a pregnancy that she claims {{was the result of}} the rape; it is later revealed that she in fact aborted Frank's child, with his consent. She then converts the focus on that issue into political support that becomes critical to the Underwoods' ascension to the Oval Office.|$|E
5|$|The Virginia Tech Hokies {{entered the}} 2010 season after a 2009 {{campaign}} {{that saw the}} team finish 10–3, including a season-ending win in the 2009 Chick-fil-A Bowl against the Tennessee Volunteers. Because of that season-ending victory and the Hokies' general good performance during the 2009 season, Virginia Tech was ranked No. 10 in preseason national polling. The Hokies' {{first game of the}} season was <b>a</b> <b>nationally</b> <b>televised</b> contest against then-No. 3 Boise State at FedExField near Washington, D.C.. Because the game {{was the first of the}} season to feature two top-10 teams, it received large amounts of media coverage. During the game, Virginia Tech fell behind 17–0 in the first quarter, but rallied to take a 21–20 lead early in the third quarter. The two teams traded the lead, alternating scoring drives until Boise State scored a touchdown with 1:06 remaining. Virginia Tech was unable to reply one final time, and Boise State earned a 33–30 victory.|$|E

5|$|Virginia Tech {{began the}} 1984 season under head coach Bill Dooley, {{who at the}} time was the winningest coach in Tech history. In 1983, the Hokies had gone 92, with one of the two losses coming at the hands of No. 9 West Virginia in <b>a</b> <b>nationally</b> <b>televised</b> game. Tech began the 1984 season with a win against Wake Forest, but {{followed}} that by a loss against West Virginia {{in one of the most}} contentious college football rivalries in the country at that time. In the two weeks that followed, Tech continued to alternate wins and losses, reaching an overall record of 22 by the end of the fourth week of the season. Tech's fortunes took a turn for the better during the latter portion of the season, however, as the Hokies proceeded to win six of their final seven games before earning a bid to the 1984 Independence Bowl.|$|E
