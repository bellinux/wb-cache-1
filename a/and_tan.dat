There are also black <b>and</b> <b>tan,</b> and sometimes liver <b>and</b> <b>tan,</b> as well as a variety of color mixtures of those solid colors including roans, roan and tans, tricolors and those solid colors with additional white markings.|$|E
5|$|The {{earliest}} {{examples of}} the breed were white or occasionally brown or black. Queen Victoria adopted a small red Pomeranian in 1888, which caused that color to become fashionable {{by the end of}} the 19th century. In modern times, the Pomeranian comes in the widest variety of colors of any dog breed, including white, black, brown, red, orange, cream, blue, sable, black <b>and</b> <b>tan,</b> brown <b>and</b> <b>tan,</b> spotted, brindle, plus combinations of those colors. The most common colors are orange, black or cream/white.|$|E

5|$|The coat of {{the breed}} {{come in a}} variety of shades with the colours being {{separated}} into three main groups: black/black <b>and</b> <b>tan,</b> any solid colour other than black (ASCOB), and parti-colour. The black variety is either all black, or with tan points on the dog's head, the feet and the tail in a pattern called black <b>and</b> <b>tan.</b> The group known as ASCOB includes all other solid colours from light cream through to dark red, although some lighter colouring is allowed on the feathering according to standards. Parti-coloured dogs are white with patches of another colour such as black or brown, and includes any roan coloured dogs. In addition, American Cockers coats can come in a pattern known as merle, which is not recognised by the American Kennel Club.|$|E
5|$|This type {{of small}} white terrier {{dates back to}} the work of the Reverend John Russell, born in 1795. In 1819 he {{purchased}} a small white <b>and</b> <b>tan</b> terrier bitch named Trump from a milkman in the hamlet of Elmsford. She formed the basis for his breeding programme, and by the 1850s the dogs were recognised as a distinct type of Fox Terrier.|$|E

5000|$|The new {{recruits}} received three months' hurried training, and were rapidly posted to RIC barracks, mostly in rural County Dublin, Munster and eastern Connacht. The first men arrived on 25 March 1920. The British government also raised another unit, the Auxiliary Division of the constabulary, {{known as the}} Auxiliaries or Auxies, consisting of ex-army officers. The Black <b>and</b> <b>Tans</b> aided the Auxiliaries in the British government's attempts to break both the IRA and the Dáil. The Blacks <b>and</b> <b>Tans</b> were meant {{to back up the}} RIC in the struggle against the IRA, playing a defensive-reactive role whereas the role of the [...] "Auxies" [...] were those of heavily armed, mobile units meant for offensive operations in the Irish countryside intended to hunt down and destroy IRA units. At least part of the infamy of the Blacks <b>and</b> <b>Tans</b> is undeserved as many of the war crimes attributed to the Blacks <b>and</b> <b>Tans</b> were actually the work of the [...] "Auxies".|$|R

However, he now feels threatened by Chief, a younger, faster Black <b>and</b> <b>Tan</b> Coonhound. Copper hates Chief, who is taking Copper's place as pack leader. During a bear hunt, Chief protects the Master when the bear turns on him, while Copper is too afraid of the bear to confront him. The Master ignores Copper to heap praise on Chief and Copper's hatred and jealousy grow.|$|E
5|$|Srigala Item (Indonesian for Black Wolf, also advertised {{with the}} Dutch title De Zwarte Wolf) is a 1941 film from the Dutch East Indies that was {{directed}} by Tan Tjoei Hock and produced by The Teng Chun for Action Film. Starring Hadidjah, Mohamad Mochtar, <b>and</b> <b>Tan</b> Tjeng Bok, the film's plot– inspired by Zorro– follows {{a young man who}} became a masked vigilante to take revenge against his conniving uncle. Srigala Item was a commercial success, which Misbach Yusa Biran credits to the plot's use for escapism. A copy of the black-and-white film, which featured kroncong music, is stored at Sinematek Indonesia.|$|E
5|$|After Si Ronda, Lie <b>and</b> <b>Tan</b> {{collaborated on}} three further films. Lie left Tan's in 1932, {{reportedly}} as his approach no longer matched Tan's low-class target audience and caused the works {{to go over}} budget. Effendi continued to work with Tan's until 1932, when he left to head the cinema magazine Doenia Film. Momo continued acting until 1941, first with Tan's and later with Standard Film. The film is likely lost. The American visual anthropologist Karl G. Heider writes that all Indonesian films from before 1950 are lost. However, JB Kristanto's Katalog Film Indonesia (Indonesian Film Catalogue) records several as having survived at Sinematek Indonesia's archives.|$|E

5|$|Although both Sjair Abdoel Moeloek and Siti Akbari {{were often}} {{performed}} on stage, {{the similarities between}} the two were not discovered for several years. Zaini-Lajoubert writes that Tio Ie Soei uncovered these similarities while working as a journalist for the Chinese Malay newspaper Lay Po in 1923. Kwee Tek Hoay followed this article with another discussion of the work's origins in 1925. Later writers criticised Lie's other works as blatant adaptations. Tan Soey Bing <b>and</b> <b>Tan</b> Oen Tjeng, for instance, wrote that none of his works were original. Tio Ie Soei, in response, stated that Lie had changed the stories he had adapted, and thus shown originality.|$|E
5|$|At the Crystal Palace dog show in 1870, in {{what was}} {{considered}} to be the dog champion class of that time with the qualification requirement of a first place win at another show, Old Jock placed second. The winner was a black <b>and</b> <b>tan</b> terrier named Trimmer, with a line-up of notable dogs {{in the history of the}} Fox Terrier including Mr. Murchison's Old Trap; Mr. W.J. Harrison's Jocko; Mr. F Sale's Tyrant, Hornet and Tartar; the Marquis of Huntly's Bounce; Mr. Bewley and Mr. Carson's Quiz; and Mr. W. Gammon's Chance.

5|$|In 1567 Qi Jiguang <b>and</b> <b>Tan</b> Lun, {{successful}} generals who fended off {{the coastal}} pirates, were reassigned {{to manage the}} Ji–Chang Defense Commands and step up the defences of the capital region. Under their ambitious and energetic management, 1200 brick watchtowers were built along the Great Wall from 1569 to 1571. These included the first large-scale use of hollow watchtowers on the Wall: up until this point, most previous towers along the Great Wall had been solid, with a small hut on top for a sentry to take shelter from the elements and Mongol arrows; the Ji–Chang towers built from 1569 onwards were hollow brick structures, allowing soldiers interior space to live, store food and water, stockpile weapons, and take shelter from Mongol arrows.|$|E

The {{main body of the}} 304th Division and the 3rd Regiment, 324th Division, had assembled in Nong Son and Thường Đức to attack Da Nang from the west. In Military Region 5, the 2nd Division had established its positions in Tiên Phước, Tra My and Trà Bồng in Quảng Ngãi Province, and Đắk Tô <b>and</b> <b>Tân</b> Cảnh in Kon Tum Province.|$|E
5|$|Throughout his life, Crean {{remained}} an extremely modest man. When {{he returned to}} Kerry, he put all of his medals away and never again spoke about his experiences in the Antarctic. Indeed, there is no reliable evidence of Crean giving any interviews to the press. It has been speculated that {{this may have been}} because Kerry was a hotbed of Irish nationalism and later Irish republicanism, and, along with County Cork, an epicentre of violence. The Crean family were once subject to a Black <b>and</b> <b>Tan</b> raid during the Irish War of Independence. Their inn was ransacked until the raiders happened across Crean's framed photo in Royal Navy dress uniform and medals. They then left his inn.|$|E
5|$|Writing for the Chinese-owned {{newspaper}} Lay Po in 1923, Tio {{revealed that}} Sair Tjerita Siti Akbari had been {{heavily influenced by}} the 1847 poem Sjair Abdoel Moeloek, credited variously to Raja Ali Haji or his sister Saleha. He noted that Sair Siti Akbari, which Lie stated to be his own, closely followed the earlier work's plot. In his 1958 biography, Tio revealed that Lie's Tjhit Liap Seng was an amalgamation of two European novels: Jacob van Lennep's Klaasje Zevenster (1865) and Jules Verne's Les Tribulations d'un Chinois en Chine (1879). Tio noted that a third book, Pembalasan Dendam Hati, had extensive parallels with a work by Xavier de Montépin translated as De Wraak van de Koddebeier. In face of these revelations, literary critics such as Tan Soey Bing <b>and</b> <b>Tan</b> Oen Tjeng wrote that none of Lie's writings were original.|$|E
