5|$|Late on 28 November 1980, {{the night}} before the team's {{departure}} for Italy, goalkeeper Józef Młynarczyk and forward Włodzimierz Smolarek, both of Widzew Łódź, left the team hotel in Warsaw, the Hotel Vera, without permission. According to Smolarek they did this to get some dinner because they did not like the food at the hotel. They met a friend of Młynarczyk's, sports journalist Wojciech Zieliński, at the Adria nightclub. According to Andrzej Iwan, another member of the team, the main topic of conversation was Zieliński's estranged wife, who had been caught prostituting herself around Warsaw, and had since moved to Italy. Several Poland players knew her, and Młynarczyk had just been to Italy to play for Widzew Łódź against Juventus. According to Iwan, the journalist encouraged Młynarczyk to drink <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>talked,</b> hoping the goalkeeper might have news of her.

Besides the laughing man, she included her primary school, her apartment and a sandwich store where she used to work. Stead also added memories of herself acting mean without reason.

After developing the basic idea, Stead began researching the science behind time travel to make sure her ideas would be logical. She asked her father for help with the science and complicated technical aspects, since he enjoyed mathematical puzzles. <b>As</b> <b>they</b> <b>talked</b> about time travel, Stead [...] "just kept falling into the same hole with the logic, and he really helped me straighten it out".|$|E

500|$|In his {{foreword}} of the novel, John Galsworthy {{called it}} a [...] "delicious book" [...] and a [...] "little masterpiece" [...] that shows a [...] "delicacy of perception and essential truth". He notes that while reading the galley proof of the novel while crossing the English Channel, he, his wife, and his nephew read each page in turn {{over the course of}} three hours in [...] "silent absorption." [...] The New York Times reviewer John Chamberlain praised Salten's [...] "tender, lucid style" [...] that [...] "takes you out of yourself". He felt that Salten captured the essence of each of the creatures <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>talked,</b> catching the [...] "rhythm of the different beings who people his forest world" [...] and showed particular [...] "comprehension" [...] in detailing the various stages of Bambi's life. He also considered the English translation [...] "admirably" [...] done. A reviewer for Catholic World praised the approach of the subject, noting that it was [...] "marked by poetry and sympathy [...] charming reminders of German folklore and fairy tale". However, they disliked the [...] "transference of certain human ideals to the animal mind" [...] and the vague references to religious allegory. The Boston Transcript {{called it a}} [...] "sensitive allegory of life". The Saturday Review considered it [...] "beautiful and graceful" [...] piece that showed a rare [...] "individuality". The Times Literary Supplement stated that the novel is a [...] "tale of exceptional charm, though untrustworthy of some of the facts of animal life." [...] Isabel Ely Lord, reviewing the novel for the American Journal of Nursing, called the novel a [...] "delightful animal story" [...] and Salten a [...] "poet" [...] whose [...] "picture of the woods and its people is an unforgettable one." [...] In comparing Bambi to Salten's later work Perri—in which Bambi makes a brief cameo—Louise Long of the Dallas Morning News considered both to be stories that [...] "quietly and completely [...] the heart". Long felt the prose was [...] "poised and mobile and beautiful as poetry" [...] and praises Salten for his ability to give the animals seemingly human speech while not [...] " [...] their essential natures." ...|$|E
