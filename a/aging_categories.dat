40|$|This study {{defined and}} {{examined}} the interrelationships among four multicategory definitions of robust aging: productive involvement, affective status, functional status, and cognitive status. Data are from a sample of 1, 644 adults aged 60 and older who participated in a nationwide household survey in 1986. The four robust aging indicators were minimally correlated, suggesting that they tap a multidimensional phenomenon. Several personal characteristics were found to distinguish robustly aging individuals from their less-well-functioning counterparts {{for at least one}} robust aging criterion. The most robustly aging individuals reported greater social contact, better health and vision, and fewer significant life events {{in the past three years}} than their less robustly aging counterparts. The data also indicated a linear age-related decrease in the proportion of respondents found in the most robust <b>aging</b> <b>categories,</b> but membership in the oldest-old cohort did not preclude one from being identified as aging robustly. ROBUST aging — referred to by various terms such as"successful aging, " "productive aging, " "vitality," "maintenance of functioning, " or "aging well " — is at-tracting increasing attention by gerontological researchers. Predicated on the recognition of the heterogeneity in health among older Americans (Danneffer, 1988; Rowe and Kahn, 1987), this research has helped to redirect attention from th...|$|E

40|$|Purpose Employees {{experiencing}} a high need for recovery (NFR) {{are at risk}} of long-term adverse effects in both their health and labour participation. So far, the determinants of NFR across <b>age</b> <b>categories</b> remain unknown. The aim {{of this study is to}} investigate the determinants of the NFR among employees in three <b>age</b> <b>categories</b> (30 – 44, 45 – 54 and 55 – 65 years), for men and women separately. Methods T he study was based on data from the prospective Maastricht Cohort Study. Wave T 3 (May 1999) was chosen as article baseline (n = 7, 900). The followup period of 20 months included five follow-up waves. Cox regression analyses were performed to investigate the determinants, which originated from the work environment, health and lifestyle and personal domain of employees, of NFR across <b>age</b> <b>categories</b> over time. Results C ross-sectional results demonstrated substantial differences in mean scores and proportion of cases of NFR across <b>age</b> <b>categories.</b> Longitudinal analyses demonstrated risk factors in the multifactorial aetiology of NFR that played a role in all <b>age</b> <b>categories,</b> but also showed several age-specific risk factors, e. g. low decision latitude appeared to be a risk factor only in the oldest <b>age</b> <b>category.</b> Conclusions Although selection effects may have occurred, this study shows that the risk factors for a high NFR were different among the <b>age</b> <b>categories.</b> To prevent and reduce a high NFR among employees, it is important to develop preventive measures that target age-specific risk factors. status: publishe...|$|R

40|$|Nitrogen {{fertilization}} augments tiller {{appearance and}} death, modifying the age profile of tiller population. Tillers from different <b>age</b> <b>categories</b> present distinct responses to environmental factors and management practices characterized by variation in their morphogenetic responses, which interfere in {{the dynamics of}} the herbage accumulation process. In that context, rates of leaf appearance and elongation and leaf lifespan were used as indicators to identify tiller <b>age</b> <b>categories</b> of continuously stocked marandu palisade grass managed at 30 cm and subjected to nitrogen fertilization regimes using cluster analysis. Analysis was based on the average distance method using combined means of the response-variables studied, and the results used to build a dendogram to illustrate the arrangement of the resulting clusters. Three clusters were identified corresponding to the tiller <b>age</b> <b>categories</b> denominated young (tillers with age between 0 and 60 days), mature (between 60 and 120 days) and old (over 120 days). Discrimination of the tiller <b>age</b> <b>categories</b> according to nitrogen fertilization regime followed the same pattern of clustering. The fact demonstrates consistency and indicates the three <b>age</b> <b>categories</b> as reference for detailed studies regarding the ecophysiology of marandu palisade grass...|$|R
