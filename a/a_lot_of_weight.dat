5|$|McCabe married Edna May Linton on 5 February 1935 at St Mary's Cathedral, Sydney, and {{the couple}} had two {{children}}, {{a son and a}} daughter, born in 1939 and 1950 respectively. The devout McCabe sent both of his children to Catholic boarding schools even though the family home was nearby. Plagued by ill-health in his middle age, McCabe’s fitness was further hindered by his feet, which prevented him from exercising. He thus gained <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>weight,</b> and heavy smoking wore down his body, as did the large amount of people who wanted to meet him. McCabe weakened significantly {{in the last two years}} of his life and was hospitalised for a period for liver problems. He was released from hospital soon before his death, but still aged 58, was a very frail man who moved very tentatively.|$|E

Seeing Tallchief's frail appearance– she had lost <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>weight</b> from a {{combination}} of poor nutrition and stress– and her minor role in The Snow Maiden, her mother attempted to persuade Tallchief to quit ballet and return to piano. Ruth Tallchief changed her mind when Lichine showed her Martin's column and explained that he was America's top dance critic. Tallchief's second year with Ballet Russe brought bigger roles. She was a soloist in Le Beau Danube and got the lead in Ancient Russia, another Nijinska ballet.|$|E
25|$|Unfortunately for Chappell, {{his health}} was now blighted by {{recurring}} tonsillitis {{and he found}} it difficult to bat for long periods during the 1974–75 Ashes series. He was the backbone of Australia's sometimes inconsistent batting, scoring 608 runs at 55.3. At Sydney, where Australia won to reclaim the Ashes, Chappell dominated with 84 and 144, which he followed up with a century in a losing cause in the sixth Test at Melbourne. At Perth, he broke the world record for a fielder by snaring seven catches. Ironically, his grandfather Vic Richardson was one of several players who held the old record of six. Chappell reluctantly had his tonsils removed, but he quickly lost <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>weight</b> which affected his performance on the tour of England that followed. He played in the World Cup (for what proved to be the only time), then made only one good score (73* at Lords) in the four Ashes Tests that followed.|$|E

The only gig that year was an informal show on 15 December at the Gaumont State Cinema in Kilburn, London, filmed for the documentary, The Kids Are Alright.

500|$|After {{a role as}} the Bostonian love {{interest}} of Cornel Wilde in Humberstone's The Homestretch (1947), O'Hara had grown frustrated with Hollywood and took a considerable break {{to return to her}} native Ireland, where people thought she did not look well, having lost <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>weight.</b> While there she received a call from 20th Century Fox to portray the role of Doris Walker, the mother of Susan Walker (played by a young Natalie Wood) in the Christmas film, Miracle on 34th Street (1947). It became a perennial Christmas classic, with a traditional network television airing every Thanksgiving Day on NBC. On Natalie Wood, O'Hara said: [...] "I have been mother to almost forty children in movies, but I always had a special place in my heart for little Natalie. She always called me Mamma Maureen and I called her Natasha... when Natalie and I shot the scenes in Macy's, we had to do them at night because the store was full of people doing their Christmas shopping during the day. Natalie loved this because it meant she was allowed to stay up late. I really enjoyed this time with Natalie. We loved to walk through the quiet, closed store and look at all the toys and girls' dresses and shoes. The day she died, I cried shamelessly". The film garnered several awards, including an Academy Award nomination for Best Picture.|$|E
50|$|King Offa's {{currency}} reform replaced the sceat with the silver penny. This coin {{was derived from}} half of a silver dirhem.

A shilling was set to twelve pence, an ounce to twenty pence, and a pound to twelve ounces or twenty shillings. The penny was quite <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> money, so <b>weight</b> by coins was not a general practice.|$|R
50|$|Historically, mobile robots {{have been}} {{designed}} to be statically stable, which results in the robot not needing to expend energy while standing still. This is typically achieved through the use of three or more wheels on a base. In order to avoid tipping, these statically-stable mobile robots have a wide base for a large polygon <b>of</b> support, and <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> dead <b>weight</b> in the base to lower the center of gravity. They also tend to have low acceleration or deceleration to avoid tipping. The wide base makes it difficult for statically-stable mobile robots to navigate cluttered human environments. Moreover, these robots have several other limitations that make them poorly suited to a constantly changing human environment. They can neither roll in any direction, nor can they turn in place.|$|R

Weiss added, [...] "The more we thought about it, Jon is going to come up against so many old guys with beards in the North that like 'What if she was a tougher audience?'

There's not <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> room for sort of soft, and gentle psychology.

50|$|Despite {{giving up}} <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> height and <b>weight</b> to Ruiz, Jones {{dominated}} {{most of the}} fight. Jones used his superior boxing skills and hand speed to his advantage and used timely jabs and uppercuts against Ruiz, who was unable to land a sustained amount of offense, only connecting with 89 of 433 thrown punches for a dismal 21% success rate. By round four Jones' punches caused Ruiz's nose to bleed, which hindered Ruiz {{for the remainder of}} the fight. The fight went the full 12 rounds with neither man being able to score a knockdown. The official judge's scorecards were one-sided in Jones' favor and he secured a unanimous decision victory with scores of 118-110, 117-111 and 116-112. Jones victory made him only the second light-heavyweight boxer in history to move up and win a major heavyweight title in his first fight in the heavyweight division (Michael Spinks being the first to do so in 1985).|$|R

30|$|In my {{usage of}} the concept, “experimental Hinduism” {{does not mean that}} the Hindu Dharma traditions {{analyzed}} in the case of renunciation here, or in the case of the other Hindu expressions featured in this volume, intentionally break away from the perceived continuities of “tradition” and struggle haplessly to anchor themselves to a “sacred canopy” (Berger 1967) which, regardless of its attitude toward the fact or significance of social change, must wrestle with the challenges of contemporary life. “Tradition” is not at all problematic to the sādhus. The notion of “tradition” (dharm), however it is imagined and enacted, carries <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> cultural <b>weight</b> for them and, because of the importance ascribed to it, they want their work, and their teachings, and in some cases their religious activism, to be seen as aligned both in “spirit” and “principle” with Hindu “dharm,” even as they reinterpret its boundaries for identity formation. At the same time, “experimental Hinduism” does not suggest that the creativity born of humanity’s relationship to technology and other forms of the modern is entirely new. 6 In the case of sannyās, the theological experimentation illustrative of the sādhus’ views of communication technologies has been a component of the experimental outlook of ancient yogis (Stoler Miller 1996) as well as modern holy figures like Mahatma Gandhi (see Howard 2014; see also Bakshi 1998), Vivekananda, and Aurobindo Ghose (Brown 2012; Dobe 2016). Religious experimentation, as Nelson’s work similarly suggests, demonstrates the pan-historical, pan-cultural response of people precisely to the fact of change.|$|R

The White Team is up next, and it's {{time to find out}} whether they were sinners or winners during their week in Vegas. They must lose more than 28 pounds to stay safe. Rondalee weighs in first and loses three pounds. JJ is up next, and everyone is concerned his partying will have taken its toll. But for the third week in a row, he drops a solid seven pounds. Toma loses eight and Woody is overjoyed to have lost seven. Overall, the team really stepped it up in Vegas, losing a total of 31 pounds, or 2.22%. It's the moment of truth for the Blue Team. Damien and Lori need to lose a collective 11 pounds, or they'll be down to a team of one. Lori loses only three and is heartbroken. It's once again up to Damien to pull through... and he does!

40|$|In {{this essay}} I present an outline and {{examination}} of the Finnish Luther research, with an aim {{to learn more about}} some different aspects of Luther’s teaching on justification as sanctification, and sanctification as the growth of the new man. I will also draw my attention to the formal language of metaphysics, as it is continuously employed by Luther to depict the issues and the content of his reformation theology. Apart from the program of research in Helsinki, I have turned to the writings of Luther himself; and I have as well tried to engage in a broader survey of Luther-scholars, some of which seem to, or in fact, support the Finnish interpretation, others which raise a critical stance towards it. The later portion of the essay picks up on the Finnish critique of dominant 19 th and 20 th century German Lutheran theologians, such as Albrecht Ritschl and Gerhard Ebeling. The Finns trace an influence of enlightenment teaching among these theologians, a teaching having incorporated Kant’s separation between immanent and transcendent. They try to show how conforming Luther’s thought to such a mindset will fail to do justice to – or even render unacceptable – an important body of his theological claims, depriving Luther’s theology of it’s own content. To a certain extent I intend to establish my own impression of these representatives of German theology, and on this backdrop I enter into the discussion myself. In the substructure of the theology ensuing the kantian paradigm the Finns point on the one hand to the aforementioned notion of a human cognition incapable of ‘real’ knowledge, but also to the idea of erlebnis (an experience) so vital to existentialist thought. The latter will in theology at times appear as a dogmatically somewhat undetermined concept, which yet seem to have to carry <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> theological <b>weight,</b> if it is used for example as a substitute for a theologically informed anthropology dealing with the nature – or the nature of spiritual growth – of the human being. Following the Finnish critique I fashion a rudimentary sketch of this modern-theology complex and try to perceive how and in what instances or attitudes the enlightenment idiom of a fundamental and non-bridgeable separation between immanent cognition and transcendent truth may be unravelled as specific theological tensions, or inconsequences. Apart from the continental theologians and philosophers invoked for critique by the Finns I present also a brief survey of 20 th century Swedish theology in order to find what might be summoned from here to the issue of sanctification. In this section I will also have a closer look at Gustaf Wingren and his antagonist Torgny Bohlin in a controversy where I suspect an effect of such a putative theological tension may perhaps be visible...|$|R
2500|$|I have {{a theory}} about what caused her vocal decline, but it's more from {{watching}} her sing than from listening. I really think it was her weight loss that was so dramatic and so quick. It's not the weight loss per se—you know, Deborah Voigt has lost <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>weight</b> and still sounds glorious. But if one uses the weight for support, and then it's suddenly gone and one doesn't develop another musculature for support, {{it can be very}} hard on the voice. And you can't estimate the toll that emotional turmoil will take as well. I was told, by somebody who knew her well, that the way Callas held her arms to her solar plexus [...] to push and create some kind of support. If she were a Soubrette, it would never have been an issue. But she was singing the most difficult repertoire, the stuff that requires the most stamina, the most strength.|$|E
2500|$|Octave Chanute {{organized}} the International Conference on Aerial Navigation in 1893, during the World's Columbian Exposition in Chicago. From there, {{in conjunction with}} his contacts in Europe, he joined with younger experimenters, including Augustus Herring and William Avery.

These experiments convinced Chanute and his partners to achieve the extra lift needed without <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>weight</b> was to place stack several wings one above the other. The idea was originally proposed by British engineer Francis Wenham in 1866 and tested by Lilienthal in the 1890s.

The Strut wire design came from Chanutes bridge designs using the Pratt truss. The Wright brothers, based their Flyer designs on the Chanute [...] "double-decker.".|$|E

40|$|The thesis explores {{narrative}} {{techniques used}} in the genre of news reportage, specifically related to reporting from disaster contexts. This particular context is highly interesting, as the journalistic idea of ‘witnessing’ is very pronounced and also a major journalistic rational of deploying reporters. At the same time, reporters in this context might often ‘parachute’ in to the country, they will often have to work in poor security conditions and are exposed to stress and trauma. There are strong indications {{of an increase in}} the frequency and effect of disasters globally, which underlines the need to know more about how media reports on such events. This thesis is a small contribution to that end, exploring what narratological choices can be observed in the published news reportages. The material examined consists of news reportages from Haiti published in four different daily newspapers in Finland and Sweden immediately after the devastating earthquake there in January 2010. Out of a total of 30 articles, 8 have been examined in detail with a descriptive and also comparative approach. The method is that of narratological analysis, to a large extent based on the structuralist narratology. The categories included in the analysis are the narrative situation (how the author is present/absent in the text and how she regulates the information), narrative space (how the author present the space on which the reportage is centred) and characterization (how the author presents the characters in the text). The main findings regarding the narrative situation is that the author is present in all the analysed articles, but often not in a clear and consistent way. Rather the author will ‘place’ herself in the text more for temporary effect, particularly in the preamble, but the presence is not for example used to drive the narrative forward. In the category of narrative space, frame space (where the space is passive) is clearly the dominant narratological choice, despite the fact that disaster often has a clear effect on the ‘landscape’ and could potentially be given quite <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> narrative <b>weight.</b> Regarding characterization, there is very little of it in the analysed articles; interviewees or people observed are generally not introduced or characterized in any way. The analysis of the results and the overall process of writing the thesis leads to two distinct features in the examined material that are discussed in the summary: fading narrativity and low descriptiveness. Fading narrativity refers {{to the fact that the}} use of narrative techniques is patchy and often with a focus on the preamble and the beginning of the article, whereas the end of the article often resembles a more traditional news text. External issues can be assumed to be one clear reason for this fading narrativity (time pressure, difficult context, etc.) but I argue that there are internal issues as well, namely that the genre of news reportage and the expectations on the reports is ill defined. Low descriptiveness, in turn, refers to the fact that in all of the articles the narratological categories of narrative space and characterization is used sparsely. This is highly interesting, considering the basic rational behind deploying reporters to such context, i. e. the idea of witnessing. I argue that one possible explanation for this is linked to the McLuhan Galaxy, i. e. that we are dominated by the audio-visual and that this has – consciously or unconsciously – led to a reduction in the perceived need to be descriptive in print journalism...|$|R
