40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to explore the {{differences}} of feeling of insecurity, and mental health among working and non working women in Pakistan.

The sample of 250 (125 working and 125 non-working) women were recruited from different areas of Karachi through purposive sampling technique. Their age ranged between 28 years to 45 years (mean age = 34. 126; SD= 4. 129). For working women different organizations were approached to collect the data. After taking informed consent on individual basis, Zeab Insecurity Scale, Rosenberg Self-esteem Scale and Depression Anxiety and stress Scale (DASS, 1995) were administered on the participant women. The sample of control group was taken by convenient sampling and same scales were administered individually. The data was statistically analyzed through SPSS. The results showed significantly higher scores in working-women's insecurity feeling stress and on to the Self-esteem scales. A significant increment of the scores has seen on to the Depression and Anxiety evaluation of non working females against the working-females.

40|$|The present work aim was “Formulation Strategy for Dissolution Enhancement of Simvastatin”. Simvastatin is lipid {{lowering}} drug {{which is}} known as HMG CoA reductase. The objective {{of this study was}} to increase the solubility of poorly water soluble drug, namely simvastatin, by the formation of solid dispersion and complex and also using the microwave induction technique on these formations. For solid dispersion method dispersion carrier used were poloxamer 407 and gelucire 44 / 14. The fusion method was used to prepare the dispersions. For inclusion complexation method β-cyclodextrin derivative of cyclodextrin was used to prepare complex with drug. Kneading method was used for formulation. After completion of these two techniques these polymers were used for the microwave induced fusion method. All the ratio of drug and polymer were used to heat for different time interval. These samples were used for solubility measurement. In the solid dispersion technique, simvastatin show higher increase in solubility with gelucire 44 / 14 in the ratio of 1 : 5 <b>as</b> <b>compare</b> <b>to</b> poloxamer 407.

40|$|The {{performance}} analysis of various multiplier architectures are compared {{in terms of}} power, delay and area occupation {{in the view of}} low-power low-voltage signal processing for low-frequency applications.

Measurements point out that the shorter full-adder chains in the Wallace multiplier dissipates less energy than <b>as</b> <b>compare</b> <b>to</b> other longer full-adder chains traditional array multipliers.

In this study transmission gates combined with static CMOS circuits to reduce glitches in Wallace multiplier architecture is proposed to improve the energy-efficiency <b>as</b> <b>compare</b> <b>to</b> traditional array architecture. The reduced number of Vdd-to-ground paths, reduced glitches due to level restoring gates, the equalized internal signal delay and shortening of full adder chains are the unique techniques used to reduce power dissipation in proposed transmission gate based Wallace multipliers <b>as</b> <b>compare</b> <b>to</b> prior designs...|$|R
