5|$|If a {{mandatory}} order, prohibiting order or quashing order is sought, the applicant must follow the procedure {{set out in}} Order 53 of the Rules of Court. In general, there are two stages. At the first stage, an applicant must obtain leave {{to apply for the}} prerogative order. This requirement prevents unmeritorious applications from being taken against decision-makers by filtering out groundless cases at an early stage to prevent wastage of judicial time, and protects public bodies from harassment, intentional or otherwise. An application for such leave must be made by ex parte originating summons and must be supported by a statement setting out the name and description of the applicant, the relief sought and the grounds on which it is sought; and by an affidavit, to be filed when the application is made, verifying the facts relied on. In granting leave, the judge hearing the <b>application</b> <b>for</b> <b>leave</b> may impose such terms as to costs and as to security as he or she thinks fit.|$|E

25|$|On January 21, 1960, Truscott's appeal, {{put forth}} by John G. J. O'Driscoll to the Court of Appeal for Ontario was dismissed. Immediately {{afterwards}} the Government of Canada commuted Truscott's sentence to life imprisonment. An <b>application</b> <b>for</b> <b>leave</b> {{to appeal to the}} Supreme Court of Canada was denied on February 24. On that date, Truscott did not have an automatic right to appeal to this court.|$|E
25|$|Leave for a quashing order must {{generally}} be applied for {{within three months}} of the act or decision that is sought to be quashed. However, an <b>application</b> <b>for</b> <b>leave</b> can still be allowed if the applicant can account for the delay to the satisfaction of the court. There is no specified time limit within which leave to apply for a mandatory order or prohibiting order must be sought. However, the High Court has held that such an application should be made without undue delay.|$|E
25|$|While Pickton had an {{automatic}} {{right to appeal}} to the Supreme Court of Canada based on the legal issues on which Justice Donald had dissented, Pickton's lawyers applied to the Supreme Court of Canada for leave to appeal on other issues as well. On November 26, 2009, the Supreme Court of Canada granted this <b>application</b> <b>for</b> <b>leave</b> to appeal. The effect of this was to broaden the scope of Pickton's appeal, allowing him to raise arguments that had been rejected unanimously in the B.C. Court of Appeal (not just arguments that had been rejected by the 2-1 majority).|$|E

25|$|Bladel then {{objected to}} the {{admissibility}} of the confession but the trial court overruled his objection. He was {{convicted and sentenced to}} three life sentences to run consecutively. On appeal from his conviction and sentence, Bladel challenged the confession. The Michigan Court of Appeals first rejected that challenge and affirmed the conviction, but, after reconsideration in the light of a recent decision by the State Supreme Court, it reversed and remanded for a new trial. The Michigan Supreme Court then granted the prosecutor's <b>application</b> <b>for</b> <b>leave</b> to appeal, and considered the case with respondent Jackson's appeal of his conviction.|$|E
500|$|In addition, {{there is}} a time {{requirement}} which stipulates that leave shall not be granted to apply for a quashing order to remove any judgment, order, conviction or other proceeding for the purpose of its being quashed, unless the <b>application</b> <b>for</b> <b>leave</b> is made within three months after the date of the proceeding or such other period (if any) as may be prescribed by any written law. However, the High Court may allow an <b>application</b> <b>for</b> <b>leave</b> to be filed out of time if the delay [...] "is accounted for to the satisfaction of the Judge", {{as was the case in}} Chai Chwan v. Singapore Medical Council (2009). No such time limit requirements exist for mandatory or prohibiting orders, but such orders should be applied for without undue delay.|$|E

500|$|Hodgson {{appealed the}} conviction, but his pre-trial confessions, his {{knowledge}} of the [...] "secret details" [...] and his refusal to take the stand during the trial led to the <b>application</b> <b>for</b> <b>leave</b> to appeal being refused: [...] "n 1998 an inquiry was made by solicitors then acting on behalf of the appellant to the Forensic Science Service to discover whether the relevant exhibits associated with the murder were available. Presumably that request would have been made in order to see whether further testing might then be possible. The inquiry failed. The response from the Forensic Science Service, as we are told today, was that none of the exhibits had been retained." [...] Hodgson, who was at that time in the prison hospital, became more seriously ill, his solicitor was unable to take further instructions, and the line of inquiry was closed.|$|E

2500|$|On 26 July 2010, {{the court}} {{dismissed}} Gnango's renewed <b>application</b> <b>for</b> <b>leave</b> to appeal against sentence.

2500|$|After the {{takeover}} by the National Socialists and {{the elimination of}} the parliamentary opposition, the Law for the Restoration of the Professional Civil Service on 7 April 1933, prescribed the release of all distinguished public servants that held unpopular political opinions or who were [...] "Jewish" [...] in origin; a subsequent regulation extended this to professors and therefore also to Schur. Schur was suspended and excluded from the university system. His colleague Erhard Schmidt fought for his reinstatement, and since Schur had been a Prussian official before the First World War, he was allowed to participate in certain special lectures on teaching in the winter semester of 1933/1934 again. Schur withdrew his <b>application</b> <b>for</b> <b>leave</b> from the Science Minister and passed up the offer of a visiting professorship at the University of Wisconsin-Madison for the academic year 1933-34. One element that likely {{played a role in the}} rejection of the offer was that Schur no longer felt he could cope with the requirements that would have come with a new beginning in an English-speaking environment.|$|E
