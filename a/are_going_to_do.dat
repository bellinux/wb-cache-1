5|$|The book {{identifies}} {{a corporate}} underpinning influencing public opinion {{by way of}} companies which derive profit from the fossil fuel industry. Washington and Cook write that politicians often use weasel words {{as a form of}} spin and propaganda, in order to act as if they <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> something about climate change, while in actuality remaining passive on the issue. The authors go on to identify a greater level of denial— within the wider public itself. They argue that society enables denial of climate science through inaction and resistance to the scientific consensus. The authors conclude that if the public stopped denying climate change, the problem itself could realistically be significantly addressed.|$|E
25|$|The {{inevitable}} {{combat and}} chase sequences in the James Bond theme are handled by Action Rounds, representing 3–5 seconds of time. All characters {{involved in a}} chase or combat declare their actions in reverse order of Speed (1-3, based on the sum of Perception and Dexterity), then executed in order of speed, giving faster characters the advantages of knowing what slower characters <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>do,</b> {{and being able to}} take their action earlier. Speed also affects how many attacks a character may make in a round.|$|E

And that is exactly what these closures <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> – oh, not intentionally, except in a few cases; very few people are stupid intentionally; but that will be the effect. Books will be harder to get at. Stupidity will gain a little ground.|$|E

25|$|The {{documentary}} was {{notable for}} showing {{a wide range}} of previously unseen photographs and video material from the case. From an anonymous source, the makers obtained a longer and unedited version of the mobile phone video showing the murder of Sergei Yatzenko on 12 July 2007. Suprunyuk and Sayenko are seen standing at the woodland roadside next to their Daewoo Lanos taxi, waiting for a suitable victim to arrive, and discussing what they <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>do.</b> At one point, Suprunyuk is seen looking through binoculars for any approaching vehicles. He can also be seen posing with a hammer, which he conceals inside a yellow plastic bag. After 20 minutes, Sergei Yatzenko arrives on a bicycle, and is knocked to the ground before the attack in the woods next to the road begins. Yatzenko's children were asked {{to take part in the}} documentary, but declined. According to the commentary, at least five more murder videos are known to exist. The Yatzenko video was shown to the Chilean horror film director Jorge Olguín, who was so disturbed that he was unable to watch all of it. The documentary also showed brief excerpts from a five-minute video of the murder of another victim of the maniacs, an unidentified man. At one point in the video, the killers comment that the man has a gold tooth. The man was killed with blows to the head and a knife, with some of his personal belongings taken as trophies.|$|E

Voorhis went on the attack, charging Nixon with misrepresenting the [...] "46votes" [...] to avoid real debate and any discussion of where Nixon himself stood on issues. The Republican candidate stated that he was fighting for [...] "the person on a pension {{trying to keep up}} with the rising cost of living... the white-collar worker who has not had a raise... Americans have had enough, and they have come to the conclusion that they <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> something."

500|$|The use of {{the phrase}} as a {{reference}} to demagoguery and hypocrisy is traced to a Russian political joke about a dispute between an American and a Soviet man. After receiving criticism of his country beca{{use of the}} deaths caused by the 1905 anti-Jewish Kishinev pogrom, the Russian Ambassador to the United States pointed out [...] "Americans had recently lynched blacks". The Russian Ambassador said locals engaged in violence when drunk, [...] "just like Americans." [...] Soviet artist Dmitri Moor produced the lithograph Freedom to the Prisoners of Scottsboro!, after the 1931 trial of the Scottsboro Boys of Alabama. The treatment of the Scottsboro Boys popularized the phrase in usage by the Soviet Union against the U.S. {{as a form of}} criticism against those who themselves criticized human rights abuses. In his 1934 book Russia Today: What Can We Learn from It?, Sherwood Eddy wrote: [...] "In the most remote villages of Russia today Americans are frequently asked what they <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> to the Scottsboro Negro boys and why they lynch Negroes." ...|$|E
500|$|Daniels {{announced}} the first tuition freeze {{before the state}} had determined Purdue's funding for the next biennium.

This {{is the right thing}} to do and we <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> it...the same way families do; the same way some governments do and all businesses do. [...] We are going to adjust our spending to what we believe is the available and in this case the fair amount of revenue. [...] I know often with good reason there has been an opportunity in higher education to adjust tuition to match what the place wanted to spend, and I just think we've reached the point where we ought to break that pattern." [...] The first tuition freeze required the university to find $40 million in savings or new revenue. In order to make up for the lost revenue from tuition freezes, Daniels and the Purdue Board of Trustees focused on finding operating efficiencies such as consolidating information technology data centers, investing cash reserves and switching to a consumer-driven health plan for employees.|$|E

500|$|Other than studio personnel, only twelve {{people saw}} the {{original}} 42-reel version of Greed {{at a special}} screening in January 1924; they included Harry Carr, Rex Ingram, Aileen Pringle, Carmel Myers, Idwal Jones, Joseph Jackson, Jack Jungmeyer, Fritz Tidden, Welford Beaton, Valentine Mandelstam, and Jean Bertin. After the screening Jones, Carr and Ingram all agreed that they had just seen the greatest film ever made {{and that it was}} unlikely that a better film would ever be made. Carr wrote a review of the advance screening where he raved that he [...] "saw a wonderful picture the other day—that no one else will ever see... I can't imagine what they <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> with it. It is like Les Miserables. Episodes come along that you think have no bearing on the story, then 12 or 14 reels later it hits you with a crash. For stark, terrible realism and marvelous artistry, it is the greatest picture I have ever seen. But I don't know what it will be like when it shrinks to 8 reels." [...] Jonathan Rosenbaum suggested that Carr was most likely referring to a cut sequence early in the film that introduced all of the characters who lived in McTeague's building. The forty-minute scene depicted what the tenants did on a Saturday afternoon, and established cinematic atmosphere without furthering the plot. Rosenbaum compared the cut sequence to novels of the 19th century and to the first few hours of Jacques Rivette's Out 1. Jones publicly praised the advance screening and compared Greed to The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari and Dr. Mabuse the Gambler. However, Welford Beaton of The Film Spectator disliked the 42-reel version and criticized its excessive use of close-ups.|$|E
