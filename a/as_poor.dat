5|$|After {{the judges}} {{returned}} home, Lawrence {{was made a}} Baron for his work at Nuremberg, but Birkett received nothing. The lack of reward for his work pushed him into depression, which he took many months to recover from. He was eventually made a Privy Counsellor in the 1947 Birthday Honours list, but he saw this <b>as</b> <b>poor</b> reward for the work he had put in at Nuremberg.|$|E

Amstrad Action rated this version at 54% calling it challenging, but lacking in action. They described environmental detail and fighting as the high points, but criticized sound <b>as</b> <b>poor</b> and graphics as slow.|$|E
5|$|Following the Dutch defeat, Queen Wilhelmina {{established}} a government-in-exile in England. The German occupation officially began on 17 May 1940. It would be {{five years before}} the entire country was liberated, during which time over 210,000 inhabitants of the Netherlands became victims of war, among them 104,000 Jews and other minorities, victims of genocide. Another 70,000 more may have died from indirect consequences, such <b>as</b> <b>poor</b> nutrition or limited medical services.|$|E

5|$|His earlier {{books as}} Michael A. Weiner, Ph.D., are focused around his {{doctoral}} {{expertise in the}} field of nutritional ethnomedicine. In them, he advocates nutritional, herbal, and homeopathic options to approach the prevention and treatment of diseases such <b>as</b> <b>poor</b> diet, aging, arthritis, Alzheimer's disease, cancer, allergies, cocaine addiction, the common cold, and AIDS. He has also written about tree planting, beer-tasting, and nutritional cooking.|$|E

50|$|There is a {{long history}} of study and debate about the {{interactions}} between population growth and the environment. According to a British thinker Malthus, for example, a growing population exerts pressure on agricultural land, causing environmental degradation, and forcing the cultivation of land of <b>poorer</b> <b>as</b> well <b>as</b> <b>poorer</b> quality. This environmental degradation ultimately reduces agricultural yields and food availability, famines and diseases and death, thereby reducing the rate of population growth.|$|R

5|$|Boron is an {{essential}} plant nutrient, required primarily for maintaining the integrity of cell walls. However, high soil concentrations of greater than 1.0ppm lead to marginal and tip necrosis in leaves as well <b>as</b> <b>poor</b> overall growth performance. Levels as low as 0.8ppm produce these same symptoms in plants that are particularly sensitive to boron in the soil. Nearly all plants, even those somewhat tolerant of soil boron, will show at least some symptoms of boron toxicity when soil boron content is greater than 1.8ppm. When this content exceeds 2.0ppm, few plants will perform well and some may not survive.|$|E

5|$|Common herbs such as sage, mustard, {{and parsley}} were grown {{and used in}} cooking all over Europe, as were caraway, mint, dill and fennel. Many of these plants grew {{throughout}} all of Europe or were cultivated in gardens, and were a cheaper alternative to exotic spices. Mustard was particularly popular with meat products and was described by Hildegard of Bingen (1098â€“1179) <b>as</b> <b>poor</b> man's food. While locally grown herbs were less prestigious than spices, they were still used in upper-class food, but were then usually less prominent or included merely as coloring. Anise was used to flavor fish and chicken dishes, and its seeds were served as sugar-coated comfits.|$|E
5|$|Critical {{reception}} to Knuckles' Chaotix, both {{contemporary and}} in retrospect, has been mixed. Critics found the partner mechanic and tethering physics to be cumbersome, although many journalists appreciated Sega's attempt to innovate the series. The level design was also cited <b>as</b> <b>poor</b> by multiple publications. The game {{has been considered}} the last classic game of the Sonic series and a declining point. Some characters and concepts introduced in Knuckles' Chaotix were later featured in other Sonic games and media. Despite interest from fans, the game itself has not been re-released except {{for a brief period}} through GameTap in the 2000s.|$|E
5|$|Heroes of Mana was {{produced}} by series creator Koichi Ishii and directed by Takeo Oin. The story was written by Masato Kato, and the music was composed by Yoko Shimomura. The game was not a commercial success, selling around 180,000 copies worldwide {{by the end of}} 2007, less than contemporary Mana games. While critics generally praised the graphics, they were dismissive of the plot, mixed on the actual gameplay and sharply negative on what they saw <b>as</b> <b>poor</b> artificial intelligence and pathfinding inhibiting actual play.|$|E
40|$|Patients {{with social}} phobia report {{experiencing}} negative images of themselves performing poorly when in feared social situations. The present study investigates whether such negative self-imagery (based on memory of past social situations) contaminates social interactions. High socially anxious volunteers participated in two conversations with another volunteer (conversational partner). During one conversation, the socially anxious volunteers held in mind a negative self-image, {{and during the}} other they held in mind a less negative (control) self-image. As predicted, when holding the negative image the socially anxious volunteers felt more anxious, reported using more safety behaviours, believed that they performed more poorly, and showed greater overestimation of how poorly they came across (relative to ratings by the conversational partner). Conversational partners rated the socially anxious volunteers' performance <b>as</b> <b>poorer</b> in the negative image condition. Furthermore, the conversation was contaminated since both groups of participants rated its quality <b>as</b> <b>poorer</b> in the negative image condition...|$|R

5|$|Hypothyroidism, {{also called}} underactive thyroid or low thyroid, {{is a common}} {{disorder}} of the endocrine {{system in which the}} thyroid gland does not produce enough thyroid hormone. It can cause a number of symptoms, such <b>as</b> <b>poor</b> ability to tolerate cold, a feeling of tiredness, constipation, depression, and weight gain. Occasionally there may be swelling of the front part of the neck due to goitre. Untreated hypothyroidism during pregnancy can lead to delays in growth and intellectual development in the baby, which is called cretinism.|$|E
5|$|Kalinovka was {{a peasant}} village; Khrushchev's teacher, Lydia Shevchenko, later stated {{that she had}} never seen a village <b>as</b> <b>poor</b> as Kalinovka had been. Nikita worked as a herdsboy from an early age. He was schooled for a total of four years, part in the village parochial school and part under Shevchenko's tutelage in Kalinovka's state school. According to Khrushchev in his memoirs, Shevchenko was a {{freethinker}} who upset the villagers by not attending church, and when her brother visited, he gave the boy books which had been banned by the Imperial Government. She urged Nikita to seek further education, but family finances did not permit this.|$|E
5|$|Money No Enough was {{produced}} by JSP Films on a budget of S$850,000. The production crew included Deri Ng as first assistant director, J.P. Tan as producer, Kamis as cinematographer, A. Supranamian as film editor, Anthony Ng as art director and Abdul Shukar Mohd as sound designer. Filming was plagued by financial problems, such <b>as</b> <b>poor</b> quality shooting equipment. After the Board of Film Censors reviewed and approved Money No Enough, distributor Shaw Organisation released the film on 21 screens on 7 May 1998 and 18 April 2008. The success of the movie led to a dispute between Neo and Producer over their shares of the profits. To mark its tenth anniversary, Money No Enough was released in cinemas again and {{was followed by a}} sequel, Money No Enough 2.|$|E

5|$|Passport to Pimlico is set {{during a}} {{heatwave}} {{that occurred in}} Britain in 1947, but, despite this, filming took place during 1948's abnormally wet summer. The poor weather caused delays in production, {{which led to the}} film being over-time and over-budget. Shooting started early each day, in an attempt to get the first successful shot completed before 9:00 am. An average of ten takes a day were taken, in an attempt to get two and a half minutes of usable film per day. There were arguments between Cornelius and Balcon throughout the production, because Balcon was unhappy with what he saw <b>as</b> <b>poor</b> direction. Cornelius left Ealing Studios after working on Passport to Pimlico and did not work for the studio again.|$|E
5|$|Paul Kummer raised many of Fries' tribi (subgenera) to genus rank in his 1871 work Der FÃ¼hrer in die Pilzkunde, {{classifying}} the violet chanterelle in {{the genus}} Thelephora. Jacques Emile Doassans and Narcisse ThÃ©ophile Patouillard {{placed it in}} the genus Neurophyllum (also spelt Nevrophyllum) in 1886, removing it from Cantharellus on account of its orange spores. Charles Horton Peck discarded the name in 1887 and returned G.clavatus to Cantharellus. In 1891, German botanist Otto Kuntze published Revisio generum plantarum, his response to what he perceived <b>as</b> <b>poor</b> method in existing nomenclatural practice. He coined the genus Trombetta to incorporate the violet chanterelle, hence giving it the name Trombetta clavata. However, Kuntze's revisionary program was not accepted {{by the majority of}} botanists.|$|E
5|$|Relatively {{little is}} known about the {{historical}} and current population levels of the Southern fin whale. The IWC officially estimates that the Southern Hemisphere pre-whaling population was 400,000 whales and that the population in 1979 (at the cessation of Antarctic large scale whaling) was 85,200. Both the current and historical estimates should be considered <b>as</b> <b>poor</b> estimates because the methodology and data used in the study are known to be flawed.
