25|$|I saw in {{his hand}} a long spear of gold, and at the point {{there seemed to be}} a little fire. He <b>appeared</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> to be {{thrusting}} it at times into my heart, and to pierce my very entrails; when he drew it out, he seemed to draw them out also, and to leave me all on fire with a great love of God. The pain was so great, that it made me moan; and yet so surpassing was the sweetness of this excessive pain, that I could not wish to be rid of it...|$|E
25|$|In this fourth Edition I {{have made}} no {{alterations}} of any kind. I now, however, find myself at liberty to acknowledge my very great obligations to Mr. HENRY HOP of Amsterdam. To that Gentleman I owe the most distinct, as well as liberal information, concerning a very interesting and important subject, the Bank of Amsterdam; of which no printed account had ever <b>appeared</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> satisfactory, or even intelligible. The name of that Gentleman is so well known in Europe, the information which comes from him must do so much honour to whoever has been favoured with it, and my vanity is so much interested in making this acknowledgment, that I can no longer refuse myself the pleasure of prefixing this Advertisement to this new Edition of my Book.|$|E
500|$|Let {{the object}} of affection be {{snatched}} away by death, and how is all the pain ever inflicted upon them avenged! The same imagination that led us to slight or overlook their sufferings, {{now that they are}} forever lost to us, magnifies their estimable qualities ... How did I feel this when my daughter, Allegra, died! While she lived, her existence never seemed necessary to my happiness; but no sooner did I lose her, than it <b>appeared</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> as if I could not live without her.|$|E
6000|$|My Lords, it <b>appears</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> {{that the}} measure is unfortunate in its [...] origin, unfortunate in its scope and object, and unfortunate in [...] the {{circumstances}} which accompanied its passage through the other [...] House. It <b>appears</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> establish a precedent most novel, and [...] fraught with the utmost danger.—LORD HERSCHELL.(243) ...|$|R

500|$|However, rumors persisted and it {{was later}} whispered in society that Rasputin had seduced not only the Tsarina but also the four grand duchesses. The gossip was fueled by ardent, yet by all {{accounts}} innocent, letters written to Rasputin by the Tsarina and the four grand duchesses which were released by Rasputin and which circulated throughout society. [...] "My dear, precious, only friend," [...] wrote Anastasia. [...] "How much I should {{like to see you}} again. You <b>appeared</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> today in a dream. I am always asking Mama when you will come... I think of you always, my dear, because you are so good to me..." ...|$|E
500|$|In the Rights of Men, Wollstonecraft {{challenges}} Burke's rhetoric as much as, or more, {{than his}} political theory. She begins by redefining the sublime and the beautiful, terms he had established in his Enquiry into the Sublime and Beautiful. While Burke associates the beautiful with weakness and femininity, and the sublime with strength and masculinity, Wollstonecraft writes, [...] "for truth, in morals, has ever <b>appeared</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> {{the essence of}} the sublime; and, in taste, simplicity the only criterion of the beautiful." [...] With this sentence, she calls into question Burke's gendered definitions; convinced that they are harmful, she argues later in the Rights of Men: ...|$|E

"His {{figure was}} that of a robust, large-framed man, worn down by {{confinement}} and hard fare; but he was now recovering his flesh and spirits; and a suit of blue clothes, with a gold laced hat that had been presented to him by the gentlement of Cork, enabled him to make a very passable appearance for a rebel colonel ... I have seldom met with a man, possessing, in my opinion, a stronger mind, or whose mode of expression was more vehement and oratorical. [...] Notwithstanding that Allen might have had something of the insubordinate, lawless frontier spirit in his composition ... he <b>appeared</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> to be a man of generosity and honor." ...|$|E

500|$|After days {{of celebration}} and {{recuperation}} the ship left Tromsø on 26 August. The voyage south was a triumphal procession, with receptions at every port. Fram finally arrived in Christiania on 9 September, escorted into the harbour by {{a squadron of}} warships and welcomed by thousands—the largest crowds the city had ever seen, according to Huntford. Nansen and his crew were received by King Oscar; {{on the way to}} the reception they passed through a triumphal arch formed by 200gymnasts. Nansen and his family stayed at the palace as special guests of the king; by contrast, Johansen remained in the background, largely overlooked, and writing that [...] "reality, after all, is not so wonderful as it <b>appeared</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> in the midst of our hard life." ...|$|E
500|$|Edward Teller {{was opposed}} to the hearing, feeling it was {{improper}} to subject Oppenheimer to a security trial, but was torn by longstanding grievances against him. He was called by Robb to testify against Oppenheimer, and shortly before he appeared Robb showed Teller a dossier of items unfavorable to Oppenheimer. Teller testified that he considered Oppenheimer loyal, but that [...] "in {{a great number of}} cases, I have seen Dr. Oppenheimer act – I understand that Dr. Oppenheimer acted – in a way which for me was exceedingly hard to understand. I thoroughly disagreed with him in numerous issues and his actions frankly <b>appeared</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> confused and complicated. To this extent I feel that I {{would like to see the}} vital interests of this country in hands which I understand better, and therefore trust more." [...] Asked whether Oppenheimer should be granted a security clearance, Teller said that [...] "if it is a question of wisdom or judgement, as demonstrated by actions since 1945, then I would say one would be wiser not to grant clearance." [...] This led to outrage by many in the scientific community and Teller's ostracism and virtual expulsion from academic science.|$|E
500|$|Her {{indirect}} {{influence on}} literature, through her salon and her many literary friendships, {{can be seen}} in the number of writers who have addressed or portrayed her in their works. [...] Claudine S'en Va (Claudine and Annie, 1903) by Colette contains a brief appearance by Barney as [...] "Miss Flossie," [...] echoing the nickname she had earlier been given in de Pougy's novel Idylle Saphique. [...] Renée Vivien wrote many poems about her, as well as a Symbolist novel, Une Femme M'Apparut (A Woman <b>Appeared</b> <b>to</b> <b>Me,</b> 1904), in which she is described as having [...] "eyes ... as sharp and blue as a blade.... The charm of peril emanated from her and drew me inexorably." [...] Remy de Gourmont addressed her in his Letters to the Amazon, and Truman Capote mentioned her in his last, unfinished novel [...] [...] She also appeared in two later novels by writers who never met her: Francesco Rapazzini's Un Soir chez l'Amazone (An Evening with the Amazon, 2004) is a historical novel about Barney's salon, while Anna Livia's Minimax (1991) portrays both her and Renee Vivien as still-living vampires.|$|E
6000|$|... "It is a wonder," [...] growled out Mr. Warrington, [...] "that {{that sweet}} girl can belong {{to such a}} woman. I don't {{understand}} much about women, but that one <b>appears</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> be--hum!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Hum!' said Miss Grandison. 'And now I {{think of}} it, it does <b>appear</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> very strange {{how we have}} all become {{suddenly}} such intimate friends. The Armines and your family not previously acquainted: Miss Temple, too, unknown to my aunt and uncle. And yet we never live now out of each other's sight. I am sure I am grateful for it; I am sure it is very agreeable, but still it does <b>appear</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> be very odd. I wonder what the reason can be?' ...|$|R

500|$|Bülow was {{committed}} to Wagner's music; in 1858 he had undertaken the preparation of a vocal score for Tristan und Isolde, and by 1862 {{he was making a}} [...] of Die Meistersinger von Nürnberg. A social relationship developed, and during the summer of 1862 the Bülows stayed with Wagner at the composer's home at Biebrich. Wagner records that Cosima became [...] "transfigured" [...] by his rendering of [...] "Wotan's Farewell" [...] from Die Walküre. In October 1862, just after Blandine's death, Wagner and Bülow shared conducting duties at a concert in Leipzig; Wagner records that, during a rehearsal, [...] "I felt utterly transported by the sight of Cosima ... she <b>appeared</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> as if stepping from another world". In these years Wagner's emotional life was in disarray. He was still married to his first wife, Minna Planer (she was to die in 1866), and was involved in several extramarital relationships. On 28 November 1863 Wagner visited Berlin; while Bülow was rehearsing a concert, Wagner and Cosima took a long cab ride through Berlin and declared their feelings for each other: [...] "with tears and sobs", Wagner later wrote, [...] "we sealed our confession to belong to each other alone".|$|E
2500|$|Paul's {{conversion}} can be {{dated to}} 31–36 by his reference {{to it in}} one of his letters. In [...] Paul writes that God [...] "was pleased to reveal his son to me." [...] In , as he lists the order in which Jesus appeared to his disciples after his resurrection, Paul writes, [...] "last of all, as to one untimely born, He <b>appeared</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> also." ...|$|E
2500|$|McKean {{was over}} six feet tall, always wore a large cocked hat and carried a gold-headed cane. He {{was a man of}} quick temper and {{vigorous}} personality, [...] "with a thin face, hawk's nose and hot eyes." [...] John Adams described him as [...] "one of the three men in the Continental Congress who <b>appeared</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> to see more clearly {{to the end of the}} business than any others in the body." [...] As Chief Justice and Governor of Pennsylvania he was frequently the center of controversy.|$|E

2500|$|My {{greatest}} {{pride and}} pleasure was seeing {{you as the}} head of the greatest orchestra in Germany. You may remember that I missed almost no performance which you conducted, saw only you and was happy. I believed that what I was hearing emanated from you only...the Ninth Symphony will be forever unforgettable to me on account of you. You <b>appeared</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> like a God governing all the powerful elements and working enchantments on men. See, dear Richard, you own the power, the glorious gift of creating something great even as a conductor...|$|E
2500|$|Borlaug {{said that}} his first few years in Mexico were difficult. He lacked trained {{scientists}} and equipment. Local farmers were hostile towards the wheat program because of serious crop losses from 1939 to 1941 due to stem rust. [...] "It often <b>appeared</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> that I had made a dreadful mistake in accepting the position in Mexico," [...] {{he wrote in the}} epilogue to his book, Norman Borlaug on World Hunger. He spent the first ten years breeding wheat cultivars resistant to disease, including rust. In that time, his group made 6,000 individual crossings of wheat.|$|E
2500|$|During the war, her {{relationship}} with her aunt improved and she visited her regularly at the convent Elizabeth had established. Maria Pavlovna was at Pskov when she learned that Dmitri had participated in the murder of Grigori Rasputin on 17 December 1916, she was stunned. [...] "For {{the first time in my}} life," [...] she wrote, [...] "my brother <b>appeared</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> an individual standing apart from me, and this feeling of unaccustomed estrangement made me shiver." [...] Maria signed a letter along with other members of the Imperial family, begging Nicholas II to reverse his decision to exile Dmitri to the Persian front.|$|E

2500|$|Once the Emperor and the {{officials}} arrived at Hanyuan Hall, Wenzong ordered the chancellors, {{as well as}} officials of the examination bureau ( [...] , Menxia Sheng) and legislative bureau ( [...] , Zhongshu Sheng) to examine the sweet dews at the Left Jinwu headquarters. After they did so, Li Xun returned and announced, [...] "After we took our examinations, it <b>appeared</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> that those were not real sweet dews. This should not be announced immediately; otherwise, the empire would prematurely congratulate you." [...] Wenzong expressed surprise, and ordered Qiu Shiliang and fellow Shence Army commander Yu Hongzhi (...) to lead the other eunuchs to examine the sweet dews.|$|E
2500|$|But Edmunds {{also had}} admirers. One Democrat with {{no reason to}} {{appreciate}} him wrote a colleague that among all the Republicans, [...] "Edmunds made the most impression upon me. [...] I couldn't help admiring his clear and incisive way of putting a question, although it <b>appeared</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> that his manner is occasionally very irritating. [...] This manner of his is very much that of a lawyer employed as counsel in a case, who therefore makes ex parte statements, and thinks it fair to make all manner of allegations." [...] His closest friend in the chamber for many years was the ranking Democrat on the Judiciary Committee, Senator Allen G. Thurman of Ohio.|$|E
2500|$|Francis Perrin had {{defined a}} {{critical}} mass of uranium to be the smallest amount that could sustain a chain reaction, and had calculated the critical mass of uranium to be about [...] He reckoned that if a neutron reflector were placed around it, this might be reduced to [...] Peierls attempted to simplify the problem by using the fast neutrons produced by fission, thus omitting consideration of moderator. He too calculated the critical mass of a sphere of uranium in a theoretical paper written in 1939. He later recalled that the size of the critical mass [...] "was of the order of tons. It therefore <b>appeared</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> that the paper had no relevance to a nuclear weapon." ...|$|E
