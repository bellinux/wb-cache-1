500|$|On January 20, 2012, in {{what the}} Associated Press {{described}} as their [...] "breakthrough performance", eight {{members of the group}} performed a song on the Lobnoye Mesto in Red Square, entitled [...] "Putin Zassal". The title was variously translated by English language media as [...] "Putin has Pissed Himself", [...] "Putin Chickened Out", [...] "Putin Got Scared" [...] and [...] "Putin is Wetting Himself". The song called for a popular revolt against the Russian government and an occupation of Red Square. According to a Pussy Riot member identified as [...] "Shayba", the song was inspired by the events of December 24, 2011, during which approximately 100,000 people attended anti-Putin rallies in central Moscow. She told the Financial Times: [...] "We saw how troops were moving around Moscow, there were helicopters in the sky, the military was put on alert. The regime just wet its pants on that day. And the symbol of the regime is Putin." [...] During the performance a member ignited a smoke bomb, which led to Pussy Riot members being arrested and briefly detained on <b>administrative</b> <b>charges,</b> a Russian legal term similar to a summary offence or misdemeanor. A judge found two members of the group, Galkina and Schebleva, [...] "guilty under article 20.2 of the Administrative Code (violation of the rules for conducting rallies and pickets) and imposed a fine of 500 rubles on each." ...|$|E

2500|$|This did not, as some think, prevent investment. What it stipulated {{was that}} in order for the {{investor}} to share in the profit he must share the risk. In short he must be a joint-venturer. Simply to invest the money and expect it to be returned regardless {{of the success of the}} venture was to make money simply by having money and not by taking any risk or by doing any work or by any effort or sacrifice at all. This is usury. St Thomas quotes Aristotle as saying that [...] "to live by usury is exceedingly unnatural". St Thomas allows, however, charges for actual services provided. Thus a banker or credit-lender could charge for such actual work or effort as he did carry out e.g. any fair <b>administrative</b> <b>charges.</b>|$|E
2500|$|The British made education, in English—a high {{priority}} {{hoping it would}} speed modernization and reduce the <b>administrative</b> <b>charges.</b> The colonial authorities had a sharp debate over policy. [...] This was divided into two schools - the orientalists, who believed that education should happen in Indian languages (of which they favoured classical or court languages like Sanskrit or Persian) or utilitarians (also called anglicists) like Thomas Babington Macaulay, who strongly believed that traditional India had nothing to teach regarding modern skills; the best education for them would happen in English. [...] Macaulay introduced English education in India, especially through his famous minute of February 1835. [...] He called for an educational system that would create a class of anglicised Indians who would serve as cultural intermediaries between the British and the Indians. [...] Macaulay succeeded in implementing ideas previously put forward by Lord William Bentinck, the governor general since 1829. Bentinck favoured the replacement of Persian by English as the official language, the use of English as the medium of instruction, and the training of English-speaking Indians as teachers. He was inspired by utilitarian ideas and called for [...] "useful learning." [...] However, Bentinck's ideas were rejected by the Court of Directors of the East India Company and he retired as governor general.|$|E
2500|$|Outlawing usury did {{not prevent}} investment, but stipulated {{that in order for}} the {{investor}} to share in the profit he must share the risk. In short he must be a joint-venturer.

St Thomas quotes Aristotle as saying that [...] "to live by usury is exceedingly unnatural". Islam likewise condemns usury but allowed commerce (Al-Baqarah 2:275) - an alternative that suggests investment and sharing of profit and loss instead of sharing only profit through interests. Judaism condemns usury towards Jews, but allows it towards non-Jews. (Deut 23:19-20) [...] St Thomas allows, however, charges for actual services provided. Thus a banker or credit-lender could charge for such actual work or effort as he did carry out e.g. any fair <b>administrative</b> <b>charges.</b> The Catholic Church, in a decree of the Fifth Council of the Lateran, expressly allowed such charges in respect of credit-unions run for the benefit of the poor known as [...] "montes pietatis".|$|E
