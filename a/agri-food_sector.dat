40|$|Abstract: This paper {{presents}} a simulation analysis for EU agricultural policy scenarios {{based on the}} combined use of a PE (partial equilibrium) and a GE (general equilibrium) model. In order to draw upon the strengths of both model types, the PE model ESIM (European Simulation Model) and the GE model LEITAP are combined to analyze four agricultural policy scenarios until the year 2020, including a baseline with moderate reforms {{as well as a}} full liberalization of EU agriculture. Compared to the pronounced developments of the <b>agri-food</b> <b>sectors</b> under the baseline, the impact of policy scenarios is rather small. Real agricultural prices in the EU fall by about 20 % under the baseline, whereas the additional price decrease in case of full liberalization is only 14 %. Agricultural supply in the EU is rather stable. Even under full liberalization, agricultural supply will not decline dramatically: it falls by about 10 % if compared to the baseline. The contribution of the agricultural and food sector to the overall economy of the EU is rather limited. The full liberalization of the EU agricultural sector results in a decline of the shares of the <b>agri-food</b> <b>sectors</b> in total GDP by 0. 11 percentage points and in total employment by 0. 08 percentage points. The consideration of a decline of agricultural factor prices for capital and labor matters for the supply response, but not too much. Farm supply for the EU- 25 is 0. 5 % higher when taking into account lower factor prices after liberalization. ...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{competitiveness}} of Hungarian agriculture in relation {{to that of the}} EU employing four indices of revealed comparative advantage, for the period 1992 to 1998.

The results suggest that despite of significant changes in Hungarian agriculture during the 1990 s, the pattern of revealed comparative advantage has remained fairly stable.

40|$|This paper investigates how the {{formation}} of Economic Partnership Agreements (EPAs) with the EU might affect {{the ability of the}} six Development Cooperation Ireland programme countries in Sub-Saharan Africa to continue to provide protection to their domestic <b>agri-food</b> <b>sectors.</b> Various scenarios are constructed on the assumption that ‘substantially all' trade with the EU must be liberalised if the EPAs are to be compatible with WTO rules on regional trade agreements. The paper concludes that EPAs are unlikely to require major changes in existing levels of border protection provided to domestic agriculture in Ethiopia, Lesotho, Mozambique and Zambia but that the effects on Tanzania and Uganda could be greater. It argues that the preparation of a ‘defensive' EPA strategy by these countries should occur in parallel with a strategic review of agricultural trade policy.
