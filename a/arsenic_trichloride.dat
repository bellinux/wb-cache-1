50|$|FlAsH-EDT2 can be {{prepared}} in three steps from fluorescein. In the first step, fluorescein is treated with mercury(II) oxide in trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) to produce fluorescein mercuric acetate. This purified yellow-orange solid is then treated with <b>arsenic</b> <b>trichloride,</b> palladium acetate, N,N-diisopropylethylamine (DIEA), and N-methyl-2-pyrrolidinone (NMP) under an inert atmosphere, affecting a transmetallation. 1,2-Ethanedithiol (EDT) in aqueous acetone is then used to complete the 1,3,2-dithiarsolane moieties, yielding FlAsH-EDT2 as a pale yellow or pinkish solid.|$|E
50|$|Substituting in this {{reaction}} <b>arsenic</b> <b>trichloride</b> for phenylarsenous dichloride yields 1-chloro-2,3,4,5-tetraphenylarsole, which also forms yellow needles {{but with a}} lower melting point of 182-184 °C. Pentaphenylarsole can further be oxidized with hydrogen peroxide resulting in yellow crystals with melting point of 252 °C. It can also be reacted with iron pentacarbonyl (Fe(CO)5) in isooctane at 150 °C to yield a solid organoarsenic compound with the formula C34H25As,Fe(CO)3.

50|$|He {{published}} his first scientific paper, about {{carbon dioxide and}} oxygen metabolism in plants, with Dehérain in 1874. He left plant physiology and then turned towards inorganic chemistry; subsequently his research on pyrophoric iron was well received by the two most prominent French inorganic chemists of that time, Henri Etienne Sainte-Claire Deville and Jules Henri Debray. After Moissan received his Ph.D. on cyanogen and its reactions to form cyanures in 1880, his friend Landrine offered him a position at an analytic laboratory. His marriage, to Léonie Lugan, took place in 1882. They had a son in 1885. During the 1880s, Moissan focused on fluorine chemistry and especially the production of fluorine itself. He had no laboratory of his own, but used several laboratories, for example that of Charles Friedel. There he had access to a strong battery consisting of 90 Bunsen cells which {{made it possible to}} observe a gas produced by the electrolysis of molten arsenic trichloride; the gas was reabsorbed by the <b>arsenic</b> <b>trichloride.</b> The electrolysis of hydrogen fluoride yielded fluorine on 26 June 1886. The French academy of science sent three representatives, Marcellin Berthelot, Henri Debray, and Edmond Frémy, to verify the results, but Moissan was unable to reproduce them, owing to the absence from the hydrogen fluoride of traces of potassium fluoride present in the previous experiments. After resolving the problem and demonstrating the production of fluorine several times, he was awarded a prize of 10,000 francs. In subsequent years, until 1891, he focused on the study of fluorine chemistry. He discovered numerous fluorine compounds, such as (together with Paul Lebeau) SF6 in 1901. His research in the production of boron and artificial diamonds and the development of an electrically heated oven capable of reaching 3500°C using 2200 amperes at 80 volts followed by 1900.|$|E

40|$|The axial {{resistivity}} {{profiles of}} the silicon crystals were quite level.

Figure 4 shows some typical plots of resistivity vs. the percentage crystal pulled for crystals grown by the vapor-phase technique and doped with <b>arsenic</b> <b>trichloride.</b> A few experiments using higher arsenic tri-chloride-supply rates and longer buildup periods of arsenic in the melt, produced crystals with re-sistivities not lower than 0. 0009 ohm-cm. It appears that saturation of arsenic in the melt occurs after 45 - 60 min, limiting the carrier concentration of arsenic in the crystal to a maximum value of 3 x 101 ~ atoms/cm'. Summary Arsenic-doped, melt-grown silicon crystals with level resistivity profiles, ranging from 1 x 104 to 5 x 10 - ~ ohm-cm, were obtained by passing an arsenic trichloride-helium ixture into a silicon crystal grower. The desired resistivity could be obtained by varying the <b>arsenic</b> <b>trichloride</b> supply rate and/or by varying the arsenic buildup period in the melt.

Growth rates of 300 - 4000 A/rain were obtained at growth temperatures between 650 ~ and 780 ~ At III/V ratios below 2. 3, the growth rate increased as the TMG flow rate increased and the AsC 13 flow rate decreased. The growth rate was independent of the temperature in the gas mixing region of the reactor. High purity n-GaAs with a 77 K mobility of 36, 000 cm~/Vs was obtained. Because of its superior high frequency performance, GaAs has been used for microwave devices.

40|$|Information on the {{physical}} and chemical properties of arsenic and arsenic compounds can be found in Table 1. 1, for further details please refer to IARC (1980). The list is not exhaustive, nor does it comprise necessarily the most commercially important arsenic-containing substances; rather, it indicates the range of arsenic compounds available. 1. 2 Chemical and physical properties of the agents Arsenic (atomic number, 33; relative atomic mass, 74. 92) has chemical and physical properties intermediate between a metal and a nonmetal, and {{is often referred to as}} a metalloid or semi-metal. It belongs to Group VA of the Periodic Table, and can exist in four oxidation states: – 3, 0, + 3, and + 5. Arsenite, As III, and arsenate, As V, are the predominant oxidation states under, respectively, reducing and oxygenated conditions (WHO, 2001; IARC, 2004). From a biological and toxicological perspective, there are three major groups of arsenic compounds:-inorganic arsenic compounds,-organic arsenic compounds, and-arsine gas. Of the inorganic arsenic compounds, arsenic trioxide, sodium arsenite and <b>arsenic</b> <b>trichloride</b> are the most common trivalent compounds, and arsenic pentoxide, arsenic acid and arsenates (e. g. lead arsenate and calcium arsenate) are the most common pentavalent compounds. Common organic arsenic compounds include arsanilic acid, methylarsonic acid, dimethylarsinic acid (cacodylic acid), and arsenobetaine (WHO, 2000). 1. 3 Use of the agents Arsenic and arsenic compounds have been produced and used commercially for centuries. Current and historical uses of arsenic include pharmaceuticals, wood preservatives, agricultural chemicals, and applications in the mining, metallurgical, glass-making, and semiconductor industries. Arsenic was used in some medicinal applications until the 1970 s. Inorganic arsenic was use...|$|E

At lower temperatures, faceting results from the unequal etch rates for the different orientations. Etch rates of 0. 02 - 14 #m/rain were obtained in this study.

It is an inherent feature of gallium arsenide epitaxial systems util izing <b>arsenic</b> <b>trichloride</b> but details of the etching step are not available. Lin, Chou, and Miller (1) have studied the vapor-phase etching of (111) and (100) gall ium arsenide using hydrogen-water vapor mixtures.
