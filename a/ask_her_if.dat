While initially cold and distant from others, Yasuna gradually changes and becomes much easier to approach. Her friends in the musical ensemble tell her this, and <b>ask</b> <b>her</b> <b>if</b> she changed due to someone she likes, and Yasuna affirms this.

After Deng positively identifies DiStasio from the lineup, Tutuola and Benson {{take him to}} Dr. Warner's (Tamara Tunie) office for a forensic exam. The results confirm that his DNA matches that recovered from the crime scene. Benson and Assistant District Attorney Alexandra Cabot (Stephanie March) then warn Deng that DiStasio's defense team will claim in court that she fabricated the accusation for monetary reasons and <b>ask</b> <b>her</b> <b>if</b> she has been completely truthful; she replies that she has been. Later, the police and prosecution learn of a tape recording of Deng in which she admits that she could {{get a lot of}} money from DiStasio for assaulting her, weakening her credibility. However, Deng does not retract her accusation and insists that she was raped by DiStasio.|$|E

500|$|... "Te Lo Agradezco, Pero No" [...] {{was written}} by Alejandro Sanz for his album El Tren de los Momentos (2006). He also handled the song's {{production}} together with Lulo Pérez. Shakira, {{a close friend of}} Sanz, was the one who approached him in order to sing on his album, asking of him to make sure that she sounds [...] "nothing like she does on her own". [...] "Te Lo Agradezco, Pero No" [...] marks the second time Sanz and Shakira collaborated after [...] "La Tortura", included on the latter's Fijación Oral, Vol. 1 (2005). Sanz stated, [...] "I hadn't dared <b>ask</b> <b>her</b> <b>if</b> she wanted to do something with me, because it was a little like, 'I sing with you, now sing with me'. Plus, we didn't want it to be 'La Tortura 2' because we're very considerate of each other. She's the one who came and said, 'Hey, I want to sing'." [...] He concluded the interview by saying that with the collaborations, he managed to expand his artistry by experimenting with new styles.|$|E
2500|$|On {{the night}} of 1 August, at 1:00 in the morning, Marie Antoinette was {{transferred}} from the Temple to an isolated cell in the Conciergerie as 'Prisoner n° 280'. Leaving the tower she bumped {{her head against the}} lintel of a door, which prompted one of her guards to <b>ask</b> <b>her</b> <b>if</b> she was hurt, to which she answered, [...] "No! Nothing now can hurt me." [...] This was the most difficult period of her captivity. She was under constant surveillance, with no privacy. The [...] "Carnation Plot" [...] (Le complot de l'œillet), an attempt to help her escape at the end of August, was foiled due to the inability to corrupt all the guards. She was attended by Rosalie Lamorlière, who took care of her as much as she could. At least once she received a visit by a Catholic priest.|$|E
2500|$|On [...] October 16, 2006, {{the tone}} of the {{messages}} changed. After Megan got home from school, Tina Meier signed onto MySpace for Megan. She was in a hurry because she had to take her younger daughter, Allison, to the orthodontist. Before she could get to the door, Megan was upset. [...] "Josh" [...] sent troubling messages to Megan, including one that said: [...] "I don't know if I want to be friends with you anymore because I've heard that you are not very nice to your friends." [...] More messages of this type were sent, some of Megan's messages were shared with others, and bulletins were posted about her. Tina told her daughter to sign off, and went to the orthodontist. She called her daughter to <b>ask</b> <b>her</b> <b>if</b> she signed off, and she didn't. Megan was sobbing hysterically. When her mother got home, she was furious that she hadn't signed off. She was shocked at the vulgar language her daughter was firing back. Megan then told her mother, [...] "You're supposed to be my mom! You're supposed to be on my side!" [...] and then left from the computer and went upstairs. According to her father Ron Meier and a neighbor who had discussed the hoax with Drew, the last message sent by [...] "Josh" [...] read: [...] "Everybody in O'Fallon knows who you are. You are a bad person and everybody hates you. Have a shitty rest of your life. The world would be a better place without you".|$|E
