5|$|Fossils of {{both the}} Malagasy pygmy {{hippopotamus}} and H. lemerlei show a cursorial adaptation, distinct from the hippos on the African continent, <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> been much better runners. This common trait is a possible indicator that both species of Malagasy hippo descended from a common ancestor, and that the similarities to the modern hippopotamus and pygmy hippopotamus are a case of parallel evolution.|$|E
5|$|In 1944, Yasui {{was allowed}} to leave the {{internment}} camp {{in the summer and}} was employed in Chicago before moving to Denver, Colorado, in September 1944. There he passed the bar in June 1945, but was only admitted to practice law after an appeal to the Colorado Supreme Court. The following year in November he married former internee True Shibata, <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> three daughters together, Iris, Holly, and Laurel.|$|E
5|$|On 9 August 1941, RAF ace Douglas Bader {{bailed out}} over St Omer, France. Bader {{was well known}} to the Luftwaffe {{and at the time}} of his capture had been {{credited}} with 22 aerial victories. Galland himself claimed two Spitfires on that date. Galland and JG 26 entertained Bader over the next few days. Owing to the significant stature of the prisoner, Galland permitted Bader, under escort, to sit in the cockpit of a Bf 109. Apparently, despite losing one of his tin legs in the aircraft, Bader, in a semi-serious way, asked if they wouldn't mind if he took it on a test flight around the airfield. Galland replied that he feared Douglas would attempt to escape <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> to give chase and shoot at each other again, and declined the request.|$|E

5|$|Accompanied by Brady, Hindley {{approached}} 12-year-old John Kilbride in {{the early}} evening of 23 November 1963, at a market in Ashton-under-Lyne and offered him a lift home on the pretext that his parents would be worried about him being out so late. With the added inducement of a bottle of sherry, Kilbride readily agreed to get into the Ford Anglia car that Hindley had hired. Brady told Kilbride that the sherry was at their home, <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> to make a detour to collect it. On the way he suggested that they take another detour, to search for a glove he said that Hindley had lost on the moor. When they reached the moor Brady took the child with him while Hindley waited in the car. Brady sexually assaulted Kilbride and attempted to slit his throat with a six-inch serrated blade before fatally strangling him with a piece of string, possibly a shoelace.|$|E
5|$|Another effort {{involving}} the plan came about after Milošević asked the United States to stop an imminent Croatian {{attack against the}} RSK on 30 July. Although in his request he indicated that negotiations should be held based on the Z-4 Plan, he refused to meet Galbraith (who wanted Milošević to pressure the RSK into accepting it) on 2 August. Instead, Galbraith met Babić in Belgrade {{in an effort to}} persuade him to accept the plan. He told Babić that the RSK could not expect international sympathy because of its involvement in the Siege of Bihać, <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> to accept Croatian terms to avoid war. As an alternative, Galbraith advised Babić to accept negotiations based on the Z-4 Plan. Babić complied, and Stoltenberg invited Croatian and RSK delegations to talks on 3 August. Genthod, near Geneva, was selected as the location to avoid media attention. The RSK delegation was headed by Major General Mile Novaković of the Army of the Republic of Serb Krajina and the Croatian delegation was headed by Tuđman's advisor, Ivić Pašalić.|$|E

25|$|By 2009, {{crime in}} Los Angeles had {{declined}} enough from its earlier levels that detectives began looking into cold cases {{to increase their}} clearance rates. In Van Nuys, Jim Nuttall and Pete Barba reviewed the Rasmussen file and found it interesting enough to be worth pursuing.

25|$|With {{their high}} copper content (97%), the {{intrinsic}} value of pre-1992 1p and 2p coins increased with {{the surge in}} metal prices of the mid-2000s, until by 2006 the coins, would, if melted down, have been worth about 50% more than their face value. (To do this, however, would be illegal, <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> had to be melted in huge quantities to achieve significant gain.) In subsequent years the price of copper fell considerably from these peaks.|$|E
25|$|During 1867 Jackman {{bought a}} ranch near Kyle, Texas, and settled his family there, farming and raising cattle. He {{and his wife}} helped found the First Christian Church, Disciples of Christ, and he later was a Blanco Chapel Free School trustee. His wife of 21 years, Martha, died in 1870. In 1873 Jackman won {{election}} as representative to the Fourteenth Texas Legislature.

25|$|A {{freshwater}} well or spring {{lies in a}} rock cut basin in {{the middle}} of the island. This may be entirely natural or partly so, as place name and other evidence suggests that a chapel once existed here and a supply of freshwater would have been essential.

25|$|Jackman {{was born}} in Jessamine County, Kentucky, {{in the spring of}} either 1826 or 1828, the son of Thomas Jackman and his wife Mary Drake. Sometime in 1830 the family moved to Howard County, Missouri, where Sidney Jackman was taught some basic schooling. By late in the 1840s he was living in Boone County, Missouri, where he look up work as a schoolteacher as well as farming. On February 18, 1849, Jackman married his first wife, Martha Rachael Slavin, in Boone County, <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> two daughters and four sons together.|$|E

25|$|On 26 April 2012, the RAB with a {{court order}} oversaw the {{exhumation}} of the corpses at the Azimpur cemetery for a viscera test. The RAB said that the viscera test was for checking whether the couple had been poisoned and for DNA. Nowsher Alam Roman, who represented the families, was also present. The samples were sent to a lab in the United States for analysis. In August 2012, {{it was announced that}} two US labs had discovered the DNA of others and the RAB announced it would at a later date test the DNA samples of suspects for a match. After the announcement, the RAB then came under criticism from Bangladesh's National DNA Profiling Laboratory Programme. The RAB had suggested that the analysis could not have been done by a domestic lab when the Programme said it had handled over 1800 cases since 2006 <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> been able to use the same technologies in Bangladesh.|$|E
25|$|Xavier Marshall with 82 and Daren Ganga with 99 – {{both with}} ODIs for West Indies – lifted West Indies A to 228 for 2, {{but there was}} little {{resistance}} after that, and Sajeewa Weerakoon could take six wickets with his left-arm spin. However, Jermaine Lawson and Tino Best put pressure on with good and lucky fast bowling, as only wicket-keeper Prasanna Jayawardene passed fifty runs. The touring team had a slender lead of 37, but batting with more composure the second time around, Ryan Ramdass and Carlton Baugh, who both made fifties, ensured that the visitors would have to chase 316. They were well on their way – despite two wickets from Best early on, and Avishka Gunawardene retiring hurt – with 126 for 2 at stumps on day 3. <b>And</b> <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> fancied their chances with the hard-hitting Gunawardene at the crease, and the score 255 for 5. Then the wheels fell off – the last five wickets went for three runs, and the West Indians took the first of the three-game series.|$|E
25|$|Wisconsin {{started the}} half {{with the ball}} and a big 61-yard {{completion}} to TE Jacob Pedersen from QB Joel Stave would get the Badgers down to the Hoosiers 2-yard line. Wisconsin was unable {{to get the ball}} into the endzone <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> to settle for a 26-yard field goal by Jack Russell. Indiana then put together their best drive of the game, a 14 play, 70 yard drive but were unable to get into the endzone so they were forced to kick a 23-yard field goal. Once again both team exchanged punts. The Badgers got the ball back with less than a minute left in the third quarter. On the second play of the drive, Jared Abbrederis took a jet sweep handoff and ran 49 yards for his second rushing touchdown of the game. The Badgers led 37–3 {{by the end of the}} third quarter. A three–and–out for the Hooisers would then lead to another scoring drive for the Badgers, a 19-yard touchdown run by RB Corey Clement. Indiana's next drive would again stall right at midfield so they punted the ball back to Wisconsin. The Badgers started the drive at their own 17-yard line and they would use 9 plays (all running plays) to go 83 yards and score on a 21-yard touchdown run by Corey Clement. The Hoosier got the ball with less than two minutes left in the game. They ran the ball four times as time expired. Badgers would win 51–3.|$|E
