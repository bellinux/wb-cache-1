With respect to active smoking and risk, misclassification will dilute an ob-served association. Accordingly, an excess risk associ-ated with active smoking may be underestimated or, if active smoking is associated with an only modest increase in risk, perhaps overlooked. In more complex situations, a passive smoking bias may arise, i. e. dis-ease occurrence may incorrectly be <b>ascribed</b> <b>to</b> <b>th...</b>|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT Neuroimmunomodulation has {{experienced}} an explosive growth {{not only in}} basic research, but expanding {{to the point that}} prospective clinical research could be now a reality. A crucial factor for the functioning of this intimate bidirectional network was the demonstration that the immune and neuroendocrine systems speak a mutual biochemical language. This implies 1) production of neuroendocrine hormones and neuropeptides by immune cells and of cytokines by neuroendocrine cells; 2) evidence for shared receptors on cells of the immune and neuroendocrine systems; 3) effect of neuroendocrine mediators on immune functions; and 4) effect of cytokines on the neuroendocrine system. This reduces traditional differences between neurotransmitters, hormones, and immune mediators and raises the following question: what can we now regard as immune or neuroendocrine? Vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) is one example of this paradigm. VIP has traditionally been classified as a neuropeptide/neurotransmitter based in its capacity to mediate and regulate neuronal functions. Recent work has demonstrated that VIP is produced by T cells, especially Th 2 cells, and that through specific receptors it exerts immunological functions typically <b>ascribed</b> <b>to</b> <b>Th</b> 2 cytokines in nervous and immune systems. Here, we postulate that instead of a neuropeptide, VIP could be fully considered a type 2 cytokine with a key role i...|$|E

40|$|Protective {{immunity}} to Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) is commonly <b>ascribed</b> <b>to</b> a <b>Th</b> 1 profile; however, {{the involvement of}} Th 17 cells remains to be clarified. Here, we characterized Mtb-specific CD 4 (+) T cells in blood and bronchoalveolar lavages (BALs) from untreated subjects with either active tuberculosis disease (TB) or latent Mtb infection (LTBI), considered as prototypic models of uncontrolled or controlled infection, respectively. The production of IL- 17 A, IFN-γ, TNF-α, and IL- 2 by Mtb-specific CD 4 (+) T cells was assessed both directly ex vivo and following in vitro antigen-specific T-cell expansion. Unlike for extracellular bacteria, Mtb-specific CD 4 (+) T-cell responses lacked immediate ex vivo IL- 17 A effector function in both LTBI and TB individuals. Furthermore, Mtb-specific Th 17 cells were absent in BALs, while extracellular bacteria-specific Th 17 cells were identified in gut biopsies of healthy individuals. Interestingly, only Mtb-specific CD 4 (+) T cells from 50 % of LTBI but not from TB subjects acquired the ability to produce IL- 17 A following Mtb-specific T-cell expansion. Finally, IL- 17 A acquisition by Mtb-specific CD 4 (+) T cells correlated with the coexpression of CXCR 3 and CCR 6, currently associated <b>to</b> <b>Th</b> 1 or Th 17 profiles, respectively.

40|$|The {{specific}} in vitro disturbance of capacities <b>ascribed</b> <b>to</b> <b>Th</b> 1 cells in HIV-infected individuals suggests a switch from Th 1 to Th 2 lymphokine secretion. Indeed, when T cell clones are generated from HIV-infected individuals compared with controls, an increased percentage of Th 0 clones is present upon HIV infection. We studied cytokine {{production in the}} supernatant of in vitro activated PBMC from {{a large group of}} HIV-infected patients at various stages of infection. IL- 2, IFN-gamma, IL- 4, IL- 5, and IL- 10 production all were decreased significantly, which does not support a switch to Th 2 lymphokine secretion and is possibly due to the generalized impaired response of T cells from HIV-infected individuals to activation signals in vitro. Therefore, we investigated the capacity of single cells to produce a certain cytokine. Intracellular staining of IL- 4 - and IFN-gamma-producing cells revealed that T cells from HIV-infected individuals contained decreased numbers of IFN-gamma-producing cells, in the presence of normal percentages of cells with the capacity to produce IL- 4. This resulted in significantly decreased IFN-gamma/IL- 4 ratios in both CD 4 + and CD 8 + T cells. Thus, in agreement with previous findings in T cell clones, we conclude, from cytokine production upon stimulation of T cells in vitro, that there is a change in the cytokine balance to the Th 2 side in HIV infection due to decreased Th 1 and preserved Th 2 cytokine productio...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE Multiple {{sclerosis}} (MS) is {{a disease}} of {{the central nervous system}} with marked heterogeneity in several aspects including pathological processes. Based on infiltrating immune cells, deposition of humoral factors and loss of oligodendrocytes and/or myelin proteins, four lesion patterns have been described. Pattern II is characterized by antibody and complement deposition in addition to T-cell infiltration. MS is considered a T-cell-mediated disease, but until now the study of pathogenic T cells has encountered major challenges, most importantly the limited access of brain-infiltrating T cells. Our objective was to identify, isolate, and characterize brain-infiltrating clonally expanded T cells in pattern II MS lesions. METHODS We used next-generation sequencing to identify clonally expanded T cells in demyelinating pattern II brain autopsy lesions, subsequently isolated these as T-cell clones from autologous cerebrospinal fluid and functionally characterized them. RESULTS We identified clonally expanded CD 8 (+) but also CD 4 (+) T cells in demyelinating pattern II lesions {{and for the first time}} were able to isolate these as live T-cell clones. The functional characterization shows that T cells releasing Th 2 cytokines and able to provide B cell help dominate the T-cell infiltrate in pattern II brain lesions. INTERPRETATION Our data provide the first functional evidence for a putative role of Th 2 /Tc 2 cells in pattern II MS supporting the existence of this pathogenic phenotype and questioning the protective role that is generally <b>ascribed</b> <b>to</b> <b>Th</b> 2 cells. Our observations are important to consider for future treatments of pattern II MS patients...|$|E

As I will try to suggest {{at the end of this}} paper, it is rather an attempt to typify a symptomatic problem that inheres in important aspects of our engagement with the medieval English canon. British Library MS Cotton Galba E. ix is a northern manuscript of the early fifteenth century.

Null mutation of IEX- 1 enhanced the susceptibility of the mice to L. major infection, and aggravated inflammatory responses in comparison with wild-type control mice. The excessive inflammation was not <b>ascribed</b> <b>to</b> a <b>Th</b> 2 -biased immune response or a defect in Th 1 polarization, but rather to an elevated level of IL- 17 production by both ?d T and CD 4 + cells, concomitant with an increase of the neutrophil recruitment early in the infection. The lack of IEX- 1 also suppressed TNF-a production in both macrophages and T cells, resulting in a high intralesional load of parasites and delayed healing of the lesion, both of which were reversed by TNF-a treatment. These findings indicate the crucial role of IL- 17 and TNF-a in determining the outcome of L. major infection beyond a balance between Th 1 - and Th 2 -mediated immune responses...|$|R
40|$|Cytokines orchestrate the tumor-promoting {{interplay between}} {{malignant}} cells and the immune system. In many experimental and human cancers, the cytokine TNF-α {{is an important}} component of this interplay, but its effects are pleiotropic and therefore remain to be completely defined. Using a mouse model of ovarian cancer in which either TNF receptor 1 (TNFR 1) signaling was manipulated in different leukocyte populations or TNF-α was neutralized by antibody treatment, we found that this inflammatory cytokine maintained TNFR 1 -dependent IL- 17 production by CD 4 + cells and that this led to myeloid cell recruitment into the tumor microenvironment and enhanced tumor growth. Consistent with this, in patients with advanced cancer, treatment with the TNF-α–specific antibody infliximab substantially reduced plasma IL- 17 levels. Furthermore, expression of IL- 1 R and IL- 23 R was downregulated in CD 4 +CD 25 – cells isolated from ascites of ovarian cancer patients treated with infliximab. We have also shown that genes <b>ascribed</b> <b>to</b> the <b>Th</b> 17 pathway map closely with the TNF-α signaling pathway in ovarian cancer biopsy samples, showing particularly high levels of expression of genes encoding IL- 23, components of the NF-κB system, TGF-β 1, and proteins involved in neutrophil activation.

40|$|Histamine, an {{important}} inflammatory mediator in allergic diseases and asthma, {{has been reported}} to have modulator effects on T cells, suggesting that the bronchial microenvironment may regulate the function of resident T cells. We examined the effect of histamine on the release of the Th 2 -associated cytokines IL- 4 and IL- 5 and the Th 1 -associated cytokine IFN-γ by 30 CD 4 + T cell clones from peripheral blood or bronchial biopsy of one atopic subject. Based on the IL- 4 /IFN-γ ratio, the clones were <b>ascribed</b> <b>to</b> the <b>Th</b> 2 (ratio > 1), Th 0 (ratio ⩾ 0. 1 and ⩽ 1) or Th 1 (ratio < 0. 1) phenotype. Histamine inhibited IFN-γ production by Th 1 -like cells (P< 0. 02, Kruskall–Wallis), especially from bronchial biopsy, but had no effect on IL- 4 release. Regarding Th 0 clones, histamine inhibited IL- 4 production (P< 0. 02) in a dose-dependent manner and slightly inhibited IFN-γ production, but had no effect on Th 2 -like cells. Histamine had a heterogeneous and insignificant effect on IL- 5 production. The H 2 -receptor antagonist ranitidine completely reversed the inhibition of IL- 4 and IFN-γ production, whereas the agonist dimaprit mimicked this effect. In contrast, H 1 - and H 3 -receptor agonists and antagonists had no significant effect. These data demonstrate that histamine has different effects on IL- 4 and IFN-γ release by T helper cells according to their phenotype via H 2 -receptors. This study extends the immunomodulatory effects of histamine which may contribute to the perpetuation of airway inflammation in asthma...|$|R
40|$|Filarial infections {{have been}} {{associated}} with the development of a strongly polarized Th 2 host immune response and a severe impairment of mitogen-driven proliferation and type 1 cytokine production in mice and humans. The role of this polarization {{in the development of the}} broad spectra of clinical manifestations of lymphatic filariasis is still unknown. Recently, data gathered from humans as well as from immunocompromised mouse models suggest that filariasis elicits a complex host immune response involving both Th 1 and Th 2 components. However, responses of a similar nature have not been reported in immunologically intact permissive models of Brugia infection. Brucella abortus-killed S 19 was inoculated into the Brugia-permissive gerbil host to induce gamma interferon (IFN-γ) production. Gerbils were then infected with B. pahangi, and the effect of the polarized Th 1 responses on worm establishment and host cellular response was measured. Animals infected with both B. abortus and B. pahangi showed increased IFN-γ and interleukin- 10 (IL- 10) and decreased IL- 4 and IL- 5 mRNA levels compared with those in animals infected with B. pahangi alone. These data suggest that the prior sensitization with B. abortus may induce a down regulation of the Th 2 response associated with Brugia infection. This reduced Th 2 response was associated with a reduced eosinophilia and an increased neutrophilia in the peritoneal exudate cells. The changes in cytokine and cellular environment did not inhibit the establishment of B. pahangi intraperitoneally. The data presented here suggest a complex relationship between the host immune response and parasite establishment and survival that cannot be simply <b>ascribed</b> <b>to</b> the <b>Th</b> 1 /Th 2 paradigm...|$|R
