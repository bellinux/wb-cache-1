50|$|The major phone sex {{and adult}} chat lines spend {{millions}} of dollars in advertising every month. Thanks to technology, their marketing departments can track the effectiveness of their <b>advertising</b> <b>campaigns</b> by assigning unique phone numbers to each <b>advertising</b> <b>campaign,</b> regardless if it includes TV, print, online or a combination of all these. Unique numbers might either be toll-free 1-800 numbers or local access numbers in order to accommodate callers who have been targeted in a local <b>advertising</b> <b>campaign.</b> Phone sex <b>services</b> will usually list all the local numbers on their websites.

This information can be further analyzed to determine key insights such as the most and least profitable caller's demographics, best and worst times to advertise and ultimately which advertising channels to invest more in and which ones to cut.|$|R
