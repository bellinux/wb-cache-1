5|$|Various architects {{were invited}} by an {{appointed}} War Memorial Board to submit designs for a memorial intended to honor all {{who fought in}} World War I and also to provide meeting places, archives, and offices for the American Legion. The partnership of Walker and Weeks of Cleveland, Ohio was chosen in 1923. Their plan consisted of a main memorial and two auxiliary buildings, an obelisk, a mall, and a cenotaph. Bids for the American Legion building, {{one of the two}} auxiliary buildings, were put out in 1925 and construction by the Craig-Curtiss Company began the same year. In style the structure complimented the nearby local library. The second <b>auxiliary</b> <b>building</b> was not constructed until 1950. When Congress authorized the payment of World War I veterans' bonuses in 1936, the state of Indiana used the money for construction of the memorial plaza, rather than paying it to the veterans. The Neoclassical design incorporated the existing library, federal building, and University Park. One additional building was planned but never built.|$|E
25|$|The release {{occurred}} when the cladding was damaged while the pilot-operated relief valve was still stuck open. Fission products were released into the reactor coolant. Since the pilot-operated relief valve was stuck open {{and the loss of}} coolant accident was still in progress, primary coolant with fission products and/or fuel was released, and ultimately ended up in the <b>auxiliary</b> <b>building.</b> The <b>auxiliary</b> <b>building</b> was outside the containment boundary.|$|E
25|$|With the {{pilot-operated}} {{relief valve}} still open, the pressurizer relief tank that collected the {{discharge from the}} pilot-operated relief valve overfilled, causing the containment building sump to fill and sound an alarm at 4:11am. This alarm, along with higher than normal temperatures on the pilot-operated relief valve discharge line and unusually high containment building temperatures and pressures, were clear indications {{that there was an}} ongoing loss-of-coolant accident, but these indications were initially ignored by operators. At 4:15am, the relief diaphragm of the pressurizer relief tank ruptured, and radioactive coolant began to leak out into the general containment building. This radioactive coolant was pumped from the containment building sump to an <b>auxiliary</b> <b>building,</b> outside the main containment, until the sump pumps were stopped at 4:39am.|$|E
