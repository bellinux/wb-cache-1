40|$|A {{human factors}} study {{was carried out}} to assess drivers 2 ̆ 7 {{tailgating}} behavior {{and the effect of}} <b>advisory</b> <b>signs</b> in mitigating tailgating. Tailgating is a dangerous driving behavior and a leading cause of most rear-end crashes. Through a prior study, serious tailgating was identified on urban Rhode Island highways. It is critical to many urban traffic management authorities to understand tailgating and to explore means to mitigate drivers’ tailgating behavior, especially on urban highways with high-speed and high-volume traffic. Properly designed <b>advisory</b> <b>signs</b> could reduce tailgating and related motor crashes. To assess drivers 2 ̆ 7 behavior with regards to tailgating, a questionnaire survey was developed and given to a number of subjects with daily highway driving experience. The survey is designed to identify causes of tailgating and drivers’ perceptions and engagements on tailgating behavior. Drivers 2 ̆ 7 driving behaviors were further assessed through driving simulation under different traffic conditions. To help mitigate tailgating behavior, <b>advisory</b> <b>signs</b> and an educational video were developed. The effectiveness of these proposed countertailgating measures was assessed in the driving simulation. Subjects’ real driving behaviors were further studied in a follow-up field study. Study results found that the majority had an incorrect sense regarding safe following distance and were tailgating while driving on highways. Heavy traffic was identified as the top tailgating cause. The simulation results confirmed the tailgating phenomenon observed on urban Rhode Island highways. The proposed <b>advisory</b> <b>signs</b> were found effective in mitigating tailgating behavior...|$|R

40|$|Intersections pose {{a risk to}} drivers, as {{they are}} {{the point at which}} {{different}} directions of traffic converge. Indeed a large proportion of serious and fatal crashes on Australian road occur in these circumstances. While some intersections provide less opportunity for crashes than others, unsignalised T-intersections on rural roads have the combined danger of reliance upon appropriate gap-judgments of minor road drivers turning on to the major road and the regulated high-speeds of the major road drivers. The current study investigated a strategy to mitigate high-speed crashes on rural roads by reducing the speed of major road drivers on approach to an intersecting minor road. Using a fixed-based medium-fidelity driving simulator, drivers’ speeds on major roads with intersecting minor roads were compared across three different types of warning signs. These were, a standard static side-road warning sign and two dynamic, two-state warning signs that activated when vehicles were present on the minor road. A further aim was to compare whether a regulatory sign, which when activated, mandated a speed of 80 km/h (reduced from 100 km/h), or an <b>advisory</b> <b>sign,</b> recommending a speed of 80 km/h when activated was the most effective in reducing speed. Results indicated that when compared to the standard warning sign, dynamic regulatory and <b>advisory</b> <b>signs</b> were effective in reducing speed. However, while drivers largely complied with the regulated speed decrease of the regulatory sign, selected speeds were reliably higher than recommended by the <b>advisory</b> <b>sign...</b>|$|R

40|$|The {{history of}} gold mining and {{industrial}} development around the waterways of Northern California {{have made the}} prominence of mercury contamination an increasing problem in the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta (the Delta). Scientists strive to {{understand the relationship between}} mercury and aquatic environments, between mercury and fish, and between mercury and human health. Meanwhile, fishermen frequent the Delta for both sport and subsistence fishing and are often greeted with <b>advisory</b> <b>signs</b> urging them to limit their locally-caught fish consumption. <b>Advisory</b> <b>signs,</b> however, leave out the more complex historical and political processes that surround mercury’s presence in the Delta waters, leaving fishermen with little information outside of the vague threat present on <b>advisory</b> <b>signs.</b> <b>Advisory</b> <b>signs</b> and similar education efforts make assumptions {{that the best way to}} mitigate the problem of mercury contamination is through public education, and that fishermen will share an expert-driven understanding of the risks associated with mercury contamination. This thesis addresses the many contexts in which knowledge about mercury is generated, and the many ways its risks are interpreted, framing the case of mercury contamination in four contexts: mercury in the environment, mercury in the body, mercury in the academy, and mercury in the community. Understanding mercury in the environment means placing it in a larger environmental context and understanding both its historic and present day significance. To look at the body means looking at both the toxicology of mercury and how scientists have assessed the risk of its consumption by people. Looking at mercury in the body is in part a reflection on scientific understandings of methylmercury (MeHg), and in part a look at how scientists and researchers impose perceptions of the problem on to affected communities. Academics frequently examine the case of mercury contamination. The methods they have used and recommendations they have made provide a springboard for my own fieldwork and analysis. Finally, I look to communities of fishermen to see how they understand the problem, how they understand their environments, and how they can be involved as the process to curb the problem of mercury contamination lumbers forward...|$|R

40|$|Tailgating is an {{aggressive}} driving behavior {{and a leading}} cause of rear-end crashes. Understanding tailgating and finding means to mitigate tailgating behavior on highways has become a priority to many urban traffic management authorities. A human factors study was conducted to investigate the tailgating issue and possible counter-tailgating measures. The study started with a questionnaire survey and a traffic analysis to assess the causes and effects of tailgating and its impact on urban RI highway traffic. To identify drivers’ perceptions on tailgating behavior, 210 subjects were recruited in the survey. It found that 95 % of participants are potential tailgators and heavy traffic was identified as the top tailgating cause. Vehicle headways on specific urban segments of three major RI highways were next examined in the traffic analysis. It found that over 60 % of vehicles were tailgating during rush hours and about 40 % during non-rush hours. The findings confirmed that serious tailgating exists on urban RI highways. To advise drivers and mitigate their tailgating behaviors, counter-tailgating measures such as <b>advisory</b> <b>signs</b> and an educational video were designed and assessed through a driving simulation experiment. Pronounced effect of <b>advisory</b> <b>signs</b> on limiting tailgating was identified especially after subjects viewing the video. Participants’ driving behaviors were further studied through a field study. The majority found it difficult to maintain a safe following distance in a real driving environment without employing any measures. Based on the results, it is recommended that the proposed counter-tailgating measures be adopted into a more sophisticated tailgating treatment system...|$|R

40|$|A {{number of}} 80 km/h <b>advisory</b> speed <b>signs</b> {{were placed on}} {{unsealed}} roads in the Yankalilla area in South Australia in November 2014. As part of the evaluation of this trial, two weeks of vehicle speed measurement data was collected at 12 sites on these roads in June 2014 and again in January 2015. While the legal speed limit for these roads was 100 km/h, typical vehicle speeds at the measurement sites were well below this limit with typical mean speeds being around 60 km/h and only around 10 per cent of vehicles exceeding 80 km/h and less than 1 % exceeding 100 km/h. Based on this, {{it is clear that}} a 100 km/h travel speed is not suitable for these roads and that an 80 km/h maximum <b>advisory</b> speed <b>sign</b> is not out of place. A reduction in vehicle speeds (using various measures) was found after the <b>advisory</b> speed <b>signs</b> were installed. However, the interpretation of this reduction is complicated by the seven month gap between the two surveys.

The purpose of these signs is to provide the driving public with a safe speed to negotiate such curves; however, the link between these signs and safety {{has not yet been}} clearly established. The first manuscript in this dissertation presents an effort to model safety as it relates to curve <b>advisory</b> speed <b>signs.</b> It proposes a statistical model relating crash frequency at 2 -lane rural highways in Oregon to curve <b>advisory</b> speed <b>signs</b> and other influential factors. The Advisory Speed Crash Factor (ASCF) emerges as a sub-model that characterizes the safety effect of <b>advisory</b> speed <b>signs.</b> Results indicate that safety may be compromised if the advisory speed is either excessively prohibitive or excessively permissive. The second manuscript extends the use of the proposed ASCF to develop the OSU posting method, a new procedure that procures the "optimal" advisory speed derived from the ASCF. A field validation analysis, also presented in this manuscript, verified the meaningfulness of the proposed ASCF sub-model. The third manuscript outlines another methodology, named 'the Hybrid OSU Posting Method' in an effort to mitigate the well documented variability associated with using the Ball Bank Indicator (BBI). This method determines the advisory speed using the BBI in combination with the ASCF.

As a result, <b>advisory</b> curve/speed <b>signs</b> are standard practice to mitigate these risks on sharp horizontal curves. The industry standard for determining appropriate and uniform speeds for such signs has long been the ball-bank indicator; however, debates over suitable ball-bank thresholds continue and inconsistent standards between jurisdictions persist. Moreover, research regarding the effectiveness of <b>advisory</b> speed/curve <b>signs</b> in general has been long neglected.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: Deteriorating ward {{patients}} are at increased risk. Electronic automated <b>advisory</b> vital <b>signs</b> monitors may help identify such patients {{and improve their}} outcomes. SETTING: A total of 349 beds, in 12 general wards in ten hospitals in the United States, Europe, and Australia. PATIENTS: Cohort of 18, 305 patients. DESIGN: Before-and-after controlled trial. INTERVENTION: We deployed electronic automated <b>advisory</b> vital <b>signs</b> monitors {{to assist in the}} acquisition of vital signs and calculation of early warning scores. We assessed their effect on frequency, type, and treatment of rapid response team calls; survival to hospital discharge or to 90 days for rapid response team call patients; overall type and number of serious adverse events and length of hospital stay. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: We studied 9, 617 patients before (control) and 8, 688 after (intervention) deployment of electronic automated <b>advisory</b> vital <b>signs</b> monitors. Among rapid response team call patients, intervention was associated with an increased proportion of calls secondary to abnormal respiratory vital signs (from 21 % to 31 %; difference [95 % confidence interval] 9. 9 [0. 1 - 18. 5]; p =. 029). Survival immediately after rapid response team treatment and survival to hospital discharge or 90 days increased from 86 % to 92 % (difference [95 % confidence interval] 6. 3 [0. 0 - 12. 6]; p =. 04). Intervention was also associated with a decrease in median length of hospital stay in all patients (unadjusted p <. 0001; adjusted p =. 09) and more so in U. S. patients (from 3. 4 to 3. 0 days; unadjusted p <. 0001; adjusted ratio [95 % confidence interval] 1. 03 [1. 00 - 1. 06]; p =. 026). The time required to complete and record a set of vital signs decreased from 4. 1 ± 1. 3 mins to 2. 5 ± 0. 5 mins (difference [95 % confidence interval] 1. 6 [1. 4 - 1. 8]; p <. 0001). CONCLUSIONS: Deployment of electronic automated <b>advisory</b> vital <b>signs</b> monitors was associated with an improvement in the proportion of rapid response team-calls triggered by respiratory criteria, increased survival of patients receiving rapid response team calls, and decreased time required for vital signs measurement and recording (NCT 01197326) ...|$|R

40|$|This report {{presents}} {{a review of}} a research effort to evaluate the safety implications of advisory speeds at horizontal curve locations on Oregon rural two-lane highways. The primary goals of this research effort were to characterize driving operations at rural two-lane highway curve locations where <b>advisory</b> speed <b>signs</b> were present, and to determine to what extent these signs {{play a role in}} enhancing safety. Placement of <b>advisory</b> speed <b>signs</b> at horizontal curve locations in the State of Oregon is a practice aided by unique and specific state-level policies and, as such, may vary from nationally accepted procedures. Speed data was collected at 16 sites and compliance with <b>advisory</b> speed <b>signs</b> determined. An evaluation of site crash data and how advisory speed relates to historic crash information is included along with a statistical model that identifies critical variables that are associated with the posted speed and how they ultimately relate to the expected crash frequency. The research team developed a statistically based advisory speed model that assesses predicted crash outcomes based on a combination of geometric design, operations, and signage. The resulting advisory speed models were then contrasted to the expected advisory speeds based on the Oregon Policy as well as the 2009 MUTCD thresholds. They determined that the safety-based model actually predicted advisory speeds that are not as conservative as those recommended using the ballbank thresholds in the 2009 MUTCD or those identified using the thresholds Oregon has been using. Just prior to publication of this report, the Oregon Traffic Control Devices Committee (OTCDC) decided to adopt the 2009 MUTCD without making an exception to advisory speed posting guidelines.

The operational effectiveness of these signs has long been questioned in the current literature.

The function stems from a statistical analysis on crash data from 2 -lane rural highways in the state of Oregon. In general, that research effort found that <b>advisory</b> speed <b>signs</b> tend to enhance safety. However, the authors also determined that <b>advisory</b> speed <b>signs</b> may not be displaying the value with the greatest potential safety benefit. Since the derived function proved meaningful from the engineering and human factors perspectives, these authors then extend the use of this function to compute and recommend the theoretically “optimal” advisory speed. A new posting procedure resulted from this effort. The authors compared the expected performance of advisory speeds from the proposed procedure to the speeds derived from current posting guidelines. A comparable performance suggests that current guidelines are close to the hypothetically “optimal” advisory speed. In general, both the current and new computational methods performed better than speeds determined by the ball bank indicator method. This paper also presents a field validation analysis of the engine function of the new posting method. The results confirmed the meaningfulness of the function, and therefore, of the potential benefit for determining safety-based advisory speeds with the method proposed in this paper...|$|R
