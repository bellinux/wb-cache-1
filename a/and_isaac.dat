40|$|Persi Diaconis <b>and</b> I. M. <b>Isaacs</b> {{generalized}} {{the character}} theory to super-character theories for an arbitrary finite group (Diaconis <b>and</b> <b>Isaacs,</b> in Trans Am Math Soc 360 (5) : 2359 - 2392, 2008). In these theories, the irreducible characters {{are replaced by}} certain so-called supercharacters, and the conjugacy classes of the group are replaced by superclasses. Also, Diaconis <b>and</b> <b>Isaacs</b> discussed supercharacter theories and gave some properties of them. We consider in this note certain sums of irreducible Brauer characters and compatible unions of regular conjugacy classes in an arbitrary finite group and we give a generalization of the Brauer character theory to super-Brauer character theories. We also discuss super-Brauer character theories and obtain some results which {{are similar to those}} of Diaconis <b>and</b> <b>Isaacs...</b>|$|R

In 1890 an incident occurred when she demanded money <b>and</b> <b>Isaacs</b> {{was shot in the}} arm. Vincent was indicted for attempted murder, but acquitted.|$|R

In March 1890 Samuel Webster & Sons became a {{registered}} company with £175,000 (£17.5million in 2010) of capital <b>and</b> <b>Isaac</b> Webster, Samuel's eldest son, its first chairman.

At Frederick's request, Béla released his imprisoned brother, Géza, who joined the crusaders and left Hungary. Béla mediated a peace treaty between Frederick I <b>and</b> <b>Isaac</b> II, whose mutual distrust had almost caused war between the German crusaders and the Byzantines.|$|E

5000|$|While working {{together}} at the NIMR, Lindenmann <b>and</b> <b>Isaacs</b> noticed that if they killed viruses using heat and applied the dead viruses to living cells, those cells became resistant to further infections from live viruses. [...] In 1957, Lindenmann <b>and</b> <b>Isaacs</b> discovered that the cells exposed to the dead viruses secreted a previously unknown substance which blocked future viral infections, which became known as interferon. It was later found that interferons are too toxic for use as general antiviral drugs, but {{they are used to}} treat hepatitis C as well as some types of cancer.|$|R
50|$|Georgette {{continued}} to drift until she drifted into the surf at Calgardup Bay, {{where she was}} seen by the Bussell familys Aboriginal stockman, Sam Isaacs. Isaacs ran for the Bussells homestead to raise the alarm, where he found only Ellen Bussell and her 16-year-old daughter Grace. Grace Bussell <b>and</b> <b>Isaacs</b> {{then returned to the}} scene on horseback. Meanwhile, Georgette had grounded and begun to break up. On arriving at the scene, Grace Bussell immediately rode down the cliffs and into the surf, swimming her horse out until it was alongside one of the swamped lifeboats. With {{as many people as possible}} clinging to her and her horse, she returned to shore and landed them. One man was left on the boat, <b>and</b> <b>Isaacs</b> was sent to collect him. Godfrey {{continued to}} launch lifeboats, but every one was swamped or capsized in the surf. Bussell <b>and</b> <b>Isaacs</b> continued their rescuing efforts, taking over four hours to land all the passengers.|$|R

5|$|Koch himself {{believes}} that a considerable part of the poem can be dated to the 6th century. Greene in 1971 considered that {{the language of the}} poem was 9th century rather than 6th century, <b>and</b> <b>Isaac,</b> writing in 1999, stated that the linguistic evidence did not necessitate dating the poem as a whole before the 9th or 10th century.|$|E
5|$|Later, Brunjes {{is found}} murdered and Mulder and Scully watch the shop's {{surveillance}} tape. They {{discover that the}} Golem has features similar to Isaac. Mulder deduces that, because Ariel <b>and</b> <b>Isaac</b> were not officially wed in a Jewish synagogue, Ariel created the Golem out of love {{to serve as a}} surrogate for her late husband. The two agents arrive at the synagogue to find Ariel and the creature exchanging wedding vows. After an intense fight, in which Jacob and Mulder are both wounded, Ariel declares her love for Isaac and returns the creature to dust.|$|E
