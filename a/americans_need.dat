[...] Instead of finding those values in the writings of contemporary theorists, Satin says they are just new versions of the values that inspired 18th-century American revolutionaries: liberty, equality, pursuit-of-happiness, and fraternity, respectively. [...] He calls Benjamin Franklin the radical middle's favorite Founding Father, and says Franklin [...] "wanted us to invent a uniquely American politics that served ordinary people by creatively borrowing from all points of view." ...|$|E

In general, Americans always want more and more, so <b>Americans</b> <b>need</b> to work more in order to have the money to spend on these consumer products.|$|E

50|$|In Black Sexual Politics, Hill Collins proposes several {{ideas for}} black liberation, though {{the book is}} focused on getting {{individuals}} to find creative ways to challenge racism, sexism and homophobia as it manifests itself in their own communities.
