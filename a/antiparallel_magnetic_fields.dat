The plasmoid is generated ahead of the fast reconnection jet as a result of distinct compression of the magnetized plasma. Inside the plasmoid, the sheared (east-west) field component has the peak value at the plasmoid center located at x=XC, where the north-south field component changes its sign. The plasmoid center corresponds to the so-called contact discontinuity that bounds the reconnected field lines in x&lt;XC and the field lines without reconnection in x&gt;XC. Hence, contray to the conventional prediction, the reconnected sheared field lines in x&lt;XC are not spiral or helical, since they cannot be topologically connected to the field lines in x&gt;XC. It is demonstrated that the resulting profiles of magnetic field components inside the plasmoid are, in principle, consistent with satellite observations.

In this concern, a key problem {{is that of the}} resistive diffusion region where the reconnection process is initiated.

The nonsteady resistive incompressible MHD equations are solved numerically for the case of symmetric reconnection of <b>antiparallel</b> <b>magnetic</b> <b>fields.</b> A Petschek type steady-state solution is obtained as a result of time relaxation of the reconnection layer structure from an arbitrary initial stage. The structure of the diffusion region is studied for various ratios of maximum and minimum values of the plasma resistivity. The effective length of the diffusion region and the reconnection rate are determined as functions of the length scale and the maximum of the resistivity. For sufficiently small length scale of the resistivity, the reconnection rate is shown to be consistent with Petschek's formula. By increasing the resistivity length scale and decreasing the resistivity maximum, the reconnection layer tends to be wider, and correspondingly, the reconnection rate tends to be more consistent with that of the Parker-Sweet regime...|$|E

The AFM tips set the impurity levels at the Fermi energy, where two contrasting behaviors emerge: the Fano factor for the graphene diverges, while in the 2 DEG it approaches zero. As result, the spin-degeneracy of the LDOS is lifted exclusively in the graphene system, in particular for the asymmetric regime of Fano interference. The aftermath of this limit is a counterintuitive phenomenon, which consists of a dominant Fano factor due to the subsurface impurity even with a stronger STM-adatom coupling.

Using exact diagonalization, we find that when the intercomponent coupling is attractive (g_↑↓< 0), the product states of a pair of nearly uncorrelated quantum Hall states are remarkably robust and persist even when |g_↑↓| is close to g. This contrasts with the case of an intercomponent repulsion, where a variety of spin-singlet quantum Hall states with high intercomponent entanglement emerge for g_↑↓≈ g.

The {{spatial distribution of}} electrons illustrated the fundamental structure of the NLD plasma, and its dynamics were depicted from the distributions of the mean electron energy, the electron energy gain and the azimuthal electron flux. The peak of mean electron energy appeared at the neutral loop (NL), which confirmed that electrons gain energy near this loop. High mean electron energy was observed not only near the NL but also along the separatrices of the quadrupole magnetic field. Energetic electrons were transported along the separatrices and induced ionization at those locations. However, the electron distribution had valleys along the separatrices, because electrons accelerated near the NL were likely to leave this region where the binding of the magnetic field is weak. The azimuthal electron flux representing the loop plasma current showed that the electron conduction path around the NL, which has conventionally been modelled as a ring conductor, has a particular directionality due to the rectification effect of <b>antiparallel</b> <b>magnetic</b> <b>fields</b> composing the quadrupole magnetic field.

We also investigate the role of the numerical collisionality due to the finite number of macroparticles in PIC codes. It is shown that it is appropriate to choose higher order shape functions of the macroparticles compared to a larger number of macroparticles per cell. This allows to estimate better the anisotropic electron heating due to the collisions of macroparticles in a PIC code. Temperature anisotropies can stabilize the tearing mode instability and trigger additional current sheet instabilities. We found a good agreement between the analytically derived threshold for the stabilization of the anisotropic tearing mode and other instabilities, either spontaneously developing or initially triggered ones. Numerical effects causing anisotropic heating at electron time scales, become especially important for higher mass ratios (above $m_i/m_e = 180 $). If numerical effects are carefully taken into account, one can recover the theoretical estimated linear growth rates of the tearing instability of thin isotropic collisionless current sheets, also for higher mass ratios.

Second, we present another two-dimensional problem of a current sheet in a cross-field plane. In this case, the relativistic drift kink instability (RDKI) occurs. Particle acceleration also takes place, but the RDKI fast dissipates the magnetic energy into plasma heat. We discuss the mechanism of particle acceleration and the theory of the RDKI in detail. It is important that properties of these two processes are similar in the relativistic regime of T > mc^ 2, as long as we consider the kinetics. Comparison of the two processes indicates that magnetic dissipation by the RDKI is more favorable process in the relativistic current sheet.

The velocity distribution functions (VDFs) of electrons have a fine structure and vary strongly depending on their location within the reconnection setup. The goal is to start cataloging multidimensional fine-structured electron velocity distributions showing different reconnection processes in the Earth's magnetotail under various conditions. This will enable a direct comparison with observations from, e. g., the NASA Magnetospheric MultiScale (MMS) mission, to identify reconnection-related events. We find regions with strong non-gyrotropy also near the separatrix layer and provide a refined criterion to identify an electron diffusion region in the magnetotail. The good statistical significance of this work for relatively small analysis areas reveals the gradual changes within the fine structure of electron VDFs depending on their sampling site.

In order to {{study the effects of}} an antiparallel magnetic field topology on the linear stage and nonlinear evolution of the Kelvin Helmholtz (KH) instability, we performed direct numerical simulations to solve the ideal magnetohydrodynamic equations in a variety of initial configurations. Single shear layers presented growth rates of the instability higher than in the uniform (parallel) case, and a typical oscillation wave vector Ka 0. 4. Vortical motions were observed for Alfv´en Mach numbers Ma > 2. The presence of tearing type magnetic islands, driven by the KH instability, reduced the magnetic field enhancement {{around the perimeter of the}} KH vortices proper of the KH instability and, subsequently, reduced the value of the magnetic saturation energy as compared to the uniform field case. The extended domain simulations showed an inverse cascade to bigger scales, more turbulent than in the uniform case.
