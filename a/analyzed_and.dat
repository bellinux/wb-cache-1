5|$|Anekāntavāda was <b>analyzed</b> <b>and</b> critiqued by Adi Sankarācārya (~800 CE) in his bhasya on Brahmasutra (2:2:33–36): He {{stated that}} anekantavada {{doctrine}} {{when applied to}} philosophy suffers from two problems: virodha (contradictions) and samsaya (dubiety), neither {{of which it is}} able to reconcile with objectivity.|$|E
5|$|The {{chemical}} composition of fruit bodies collected from Turkey has been <b>analyzed,</b> <b>and</b> the dried fruit bodies determined {{to contain the}} following nutritional components: protein, 19.46%; fat, 3.65%; ash, 32.51%; carbohydrates, 44.38% (including 6.71% as non-digestible cellulose). Fresh fruit bodies have a moisture content of 84.4%. The mushrooms are {{a good source of}} the element vanadium, shown in a 2007 study to be present at a concentration of 0.142mg/kg (dry weight).|$|E
5|$|The fruit {{bodies of}} Geastrum triplex have been {{chemically}} <b>analyzed</b> <b>and</b> shown {{to contain a}} number of bioactive compounds, including fungal sterols such as ergosta-4,6,8,(14),22-tetraen-3-one,5,6-dihydroergosterol, ergosterol, and peroxyergosterol. The fungus also contains various fatty acids, notably myristic, palmitic, stearic, oleic, alpha-linolenic, and linoeic acid.|$|E

Research uses explanatory research to explain the relationship between research variables. It is conducted at micro, small and medium enterprises (MSME) in food and beverage industry sector. Unit of analysis is 152 owners of micro, small and. medium enterprises. Statistic analysis is used for hypothesis testing. Method of this analysis is Structural Equation Model (SEM). Result of {{research has indicated that}} there are seven (7) direct relation paths, five (5) significant relation paths, and two (2) not significant paths.

5|$|A jury {{consultant}} helped {{pick the}} jury in the O. J. Simpson murder trial. Criminologist Jo-Ellan Dimitrius used surveys to determine the ideal defense juror demographic (black women) and <b>analyzed</b> <b>and</b> judged the prospective jurors' answers to a questionnaire and response and body language during voir dire (the stage of jury selection where lawyers are permitted to directly question the jury). Prosecutor Vincent Bugliosi gives more credit to the traditional change of venue. He argues that transferring the case to a section of Los Angeles with more blacks in the jury pool was most detrimental to the selection of a prosecution-friendly jury. Incidentally, the prosecutor fired her court-appointed jury consultant early in the process.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{these reports}} of toxicity, L.torminosus {{mushrooms}} are prepared in Finland, Russia, and other northern and eastern European countries by parboiling, soaking in brine for several days, or pickling, after {{which it is}} valued for its peppery taste. In Norway, it is roasted and added to coffee. Mushrooms are harvested for commercial sale in Finland. The nutrient composition of Finnish specimens has been <b>analyzed</b> <b>and</b> found to contain the following components (as a percentage of dry weight): protein, 17.2%; phosphorus, 0.46%; calcium, 0.12%; magnesium, 0.088%; potassium, 2.97%; sodium 0.011%.|$|E

The aliens' use of a dental drill on Barry {{was inspired by a}} neighbour of Carter who said that he was abducted and that the aliens drilled holes into his teeth – which a dentist <b>analyzed</b> <b>and</b> said could not be done with any equipment he knew.|$|E

Questions about 2001 range from uncertainty about its deeper philosophical implications about humanity's origins and final destiny in the universe, to interpreting elements of the film's more enigmatic scenes such as the meaning of the monolith, or the final fate of astronaut David Bowman. There are also simpler and more mundane questions about what drives the plot, in particular the causes of Hal's breakdown (explained in earlier drafts but kept mysterious in the film).|$|E
