50|$|In {{an ideal}} current or {{transconductance}} amplifier the output impedance approaches infinity. Practically all commercial audio amplifiers are voltage amplifiers. Their output impedances have been intentionally developed to approach zero. Due {{to the nature}} of vacuum tubes and <b>audio</b> <b>transformers,</b> the output impedance of an average tube amplifier is usually considerably higher than the modern audio amplifiers produced completely without vacuum tubes or <b>audio</b> <b>transformers.</b> Most tube amplifiers with their higher output impedance are less ideal voltage amplifiers than the solid state voltage amplifiers with their smaller output impedance.|$|R
50|$|Signal and <b>audio</b> <b>transformers</b> {{are used}} to couple stages of {{amplifiers}} and to match devices such as microphones and record players to the input of amplifiers. <b>Audio</b> <b>transformers</b> allowed telephone circuits {{to carry on a}} two-way conversation over a single pair of wires. A balun transformer converts a signal that is referenced to ground to a signal that has balanced voltages to ground, such as between external cables and internal circuits. Transformers made to medical grade standards isolate the users from the direct current. These are found commonly used in conjunction with hospital beds, dentist chairs, and other medical lab equipment.|$|R

50|$|A typical triode audio power {{amplifier}} {{will have a}} driver that provides voltage gain, coupled to a triode (like 2A3 and 300B) or a pentode or kinkless tetrode such as EL34 or KT88 connected as a triode, connected to the loudspeaker through an <b>audio</b> <b>transformer</b> in a common cathode arrangement. The triode is biased to Class A operation by applying a suitable negative bias voltage to its input control grid (see diagram), or by raising the cathode potential with biasing components.|$|E
50|$|<b>Audio</b> <b>transformers</b> {{are those}} {{specifically}} designed for use in audio circuits to carry audio signal. They {{can be used to}} block radio frequency interference or the DC component of an audio signal, to split or combine audio signals, or to provide impedance matching between high impedance and low impedance circuits, such as between a high impedance tube (valve) amplifier output and a low impedance loudspeaker, or between a high impedance instrument output and the low impedance input of a mixing console. <b>Audio</b> <b>transformers</b> that operate with loudspeaker voltages and current are larger than those that operate at microphone or line level, which carry much less power.

50|$|The TR-1 was a {{superheterodyne}} receiver made with four n-p-n transistors and one diode. It contained a single transistor converter stage, {{followed by two}} intermediate-frequency amplifier stages. After detection, a single-transistor stage amplified the sound frequency. All amplifier stages used common emitter amplifiers. Stages were transformer coupled, with tuned transformers for the intermediate frequency amplifiers and a miniature <b>audio</b> <b>transformer</b> for the loudspeaker. The intermediate frequency transformers were paired with capacitors, and hand tuned to the intermediate frequency (262 kHz) using movable cores.|$|E
50|$|The {{resulting}} {{audio signal}} extracted by the diode from the RF signal is coupled {{back into the}} grid circuit by <b>audio</b> <b>transformer</b> T1, T2 whose iron core serves as a choke to help prevent RF from getting back into the grid circuit and causing feedback. The capacitor C4 provides more protection against feedback, blocking the pulses of RF from the diode, but is usually not needed since the transformers winding T1 normally has enough parasitic capacitance. The audio signal {{is applied to the}} grid of the tube and amplified. The amplified audio signal from the plate passes easily through the low inductance RF primary winding L3 and is applied to the earphones T. The rheostat R1 controlled the filament current, and in these early sets was used as a volume control.|$|E
50|$|<b>Audio</b> <b>transformers</b> for {{vacuum tube}} {{equipment}} were coded blue for the finishing {{lead of the}} primary, red for the B+ lead of the primary, brown for a primary center tap, green for the finishing lead of the secondary, black for grid lead of the secondary, and yellow for a tapped secondary. Each lead had a different color since relative polarity or phase was more important for these transformers. Intermediate-frequency tuned transformers were coded blue and red for the primary and green and black for the secondary.|$|R
40|$|Transformers {{used in the}} {{transmission}} of digital audio signals affect signal fidelity, interference susceptibility, and conducted EMI emission. Commercially-available transformers specified for digital audio exhibit vast differences in performance. Transmission standards often specify only transformer ratio and bandwidth, and ignore many other parameters which affect critical applications. This paper reviews the function, parameters and performance of digital <b>audio</b> <b>transformers,</b> and presents data on frequency response, pulse aberration, common mode rejection ratio, and jitter. It also discusses several applications and compares a number of transformers in detail...|$|R
50|$|A {{particularly}} {{critical component}} is the output transformer of a valve amplifier. Valve circuits for quality reproduction {{have long been}} produced with no other (inter-stage) <b>audio</b> <b>transformers,</b> but an output transformer is needed to couple the relatively high impedance (up to a few hundred ohms depending upon configuration) of the output valve(s) to the low impedance of a loudspeaker. (The valves can deliver a low current at a high voltage; the speakers require high current at low voltage.) Most solid-state power amplifiers need no output transformer at all.|$|R
5000|$|A passive DI unit {{typically}} {{consists of}} an <b>audio</b> <b>transformer</b> used as a balun. The term [...] "passive" [...] indicates that the unit {{does not require a}} battery or other power source to operate. This makes passive DIs less expensive, but it also means that they cannot include preamplifier features which enable the user to boost the gain. The turns ratio on a passive DI is typically chosen to convert a nominal 50 kΩ signal source (such as the magnetic pickup of an electric guitar or electric bass) to the 100-200 Ω expected by the mic input of an audio mixer. Typical turns ratios are in the range of 10:1 to 20:1. Less commonly, a passive DI unit may consist of a resistive load, with or without capacitor coupling. Such units are best suited to outputs designed for headphones or loudspeakers.|$|E
5000|$|The diagram (right) shows one of {{the most}} common single tube reflex {{circuits}} from the early 1920s. It functioned as a TRF receiver with one stage of RF and one stage of audio amplification. The radio frequency (RF) signal from the antenna passes through the bandpass filter C1, L1, L2, C2 and is applied to the grid of the directly heated triode, V1. The capacitor C6 bypasses the RF signal around the <b>audio</b> <b>transformer</b> winding T2 which would block it. The amplified signal from the plate of the tube is applied to the RF transformer L3, L4 while C3 bypasses the RF signal around the headphone coils. The tuned secondary L4, C5 which is tuned to the input frequency, serves as a second bandpass filter as well as blocking the audio signal in the plate circuit from getting to the detector. Its output is rectified by semiconductor diode D, which was a carborundum point contact type.|$|E
5000|$|Passive direct boxes first {{appeared}} in the United States in the middle 1960s, most notably in Detroit at radio stations and recording studios like [...] "Motown", [...] "United Sound Systems", [...] "Golden World Records", Tera Shirma Studios and the Metro-Audio Capstan Roller remote recording truck. These DIs were custom made by engineers like Ed Wolfrum with his [...] "Wolfbox" [...] and by concert sound companies to solve certain problems associated with amplifying electronic musical instruments, especially electric guitars. These boxes typically contained an <b>audio</b> <b>transformer</b> (like the Triad A11J through 1974) with a turns ratio from approximately 8:1 to 12:1, and thus an impedance ratio of around 144:1. With this kind of transformer, the output voltage of the instrument is stepped down to a range compatible with the typical mixing console's microphone preamp. The typical console preamp input impedance of 1,500 ohms would appear to the electronic instrument as a high input impedance of 216,000 ohms.|$|E

50|$|In {{low level}} {{modulation}} a small audio stage {{is used to}} modulate a low power stage. The output of this stage is then amplified using a linear RF amplifier. The great disadvantage of this system is that the amplifier chain is less efficient, because {{it has to be}} linear to preserve the modulation. Hence high efficiency class C amplifiers cannot be employed, unless a Doherty amplifier, EER (Envelope Elimination and Restoration) or other methods of predistortion or negative feedback are used. High level modulation uses class C amplifiers in a broadcast AM transmitter and only the final stage or final two stages are modulated, and all the earlier stages can be driven at a constant level. When modulation is applied to the plate of the final tube, a large audio amplifier is needed for the modulation stage, equal to 1/2 of the DC input power of the modulated stage. Traditionally the modulation is applied using a large <b>audio</b> <b>transformer.</b> However many different circuits have been used for high level AM modulation. See Amplitude Modulation.|$|E
50|$|Manufacturing is {{considered}} one of Røde’s core competencies, and the centre of its competitive advantage - a concept that Røde refers to as “The Røde Difference”.Since {{the early days of the}} company it has adopted a strategy of bringing most of the manufacturing in-house, focussing on robotic automation to maximise consistency of manufacture, as well as minimising labour costs which are relatively high in Australia compared to other regions.By adopting a strategy of vertical integration, Røde has been able to leverage its internal production facilities for R&D, allowing it to venture into other product areas. “That’s the thing with Røde - we buy all the gear” explains Peter. “The machining gear, the test gear; machinery that we invest in lets us do what we want to do. It’s like the transformer, we’re talking about one type but we could make any type of <b>audio</b> <b>transformer</b> because we have the machinery now.”Røde’s manufacturing success has been acknowledged by the Australian government on two occasions, winning awards for manufacturing innovation in 2012 and 1999.|$|E
50|$|To equip US Army Air Corps planes, the US Army {{adopted in}} 1941 a reduced set of radios from the ARA/ATA range. Designated SCR-274-N, these Army radios were {{electrically}} {{almost identical to}} their ARA/ATA counterparts, except for receiver output and modulator sidetone <b>audio</b> <b>transformer</b> output impedance. Structurally and in appearance, they were virtually identical except for most later units being left unpainted aluminum {{in contrast to the}} black wrinkle finish of the Navy sets. The designation SCR-274-N is a pre-World War II Army equipment nomenclature. The Army never acquired the ARA 1.5 to 3.0 MHz receiver, nor the ATA 2.1 to 3.0 MHz transmitter. Initially, it did not acquire the 3.0 to 4.0 MHz transmitter, nor the 0.52 to 1.5 MHz receiver, but the need to communicate on the common civil airfield frequency of 3.105 MHz plus the anticipated USAAF use of the AN/ARR-1 homing adapter (see below) compelled adding these units to the SCR-274-N. Early Army units were made by Aircraft Radio Corporation, but the vast majority was made by Western Electric, plus a few by Colonial Radio and others.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Audio</b> <b>transformers</b> were {{originally}} designed to connect different telephone systems to one another while keeping their respective power supplies isolated, and are still commonly used to interconnect professional audio systems or system components, to eliminate buzz and hum. Such transformers typically have a 1:1 ratio between the primary and the secondary. These {{can also be used}} for splitting signals, balancing unbalanced signals, or feeding a balanced signal to unbalanced equipment. Transformers are also used in DI boxes to convert high-impedance instrument signals (e.g., bass guitar) to low impedance signals to enable them to connect to a microphone input on the mixing console.|$|R
