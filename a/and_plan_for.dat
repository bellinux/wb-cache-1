5|$|Mel {{tries to}} return to Tlanth, with Debegri, Shevraeth and (ostensibly) his cousin the Duke of Savona in pursuit. Along the way people of the {{countryside}} assist her, but Debegri eventually captures Mel, furious about the months of trouble she caused. Taken to Debegri's nearby fortress, Shevraeth unexpectedly frees her and takes her to Renselaeus where she finds Bran. Shevraeth and his father reveal {{that they had been}} secretly fighting Galdran for years, wish to form an alliance with the Astiars, <b>and</b> <b>plan</b> <b>for</b> Shevraeth to take the throne. However, Mel refuses their help still deeply distrustful of Shevraeth and thinking of the promise made by Bran herself to their father: to become Remalna's rulers. Mel also thinks of Shevraeth as insincere, having been taught by her father to distrust of anyone who resides at court.|$|E

25|$|Docherty {{imposed a}} regime of strict discipline, sold off {{many of the}} club's older players, and {{replaced}} them with the new generation of talented youngsters emerging from the youth system, supplemented by some shrewd transfers. By the time he took over in January 1962, the team were already all but doomed to relegation and he used the time to experiment <b>and</b> <b>plan</b> <b>for</b> the future. Chelsea were duly relegated and in Docherty's first full season as manager he led them back to promotion as Second Division runners-up, secured with a crucial and hard-fought 1–0 win at rivals Sunderland (and a goal scored via Tommy Harmer's groin) and a 7–0 final day win over Portsmouth.|$|E
25|$|Elected a {{corresponding}} {{member of the}} Romanian Academy in 1898 and upgraded to titular member in 1900, he took part in its sessions twice, in 1910 and 1918. Philippide pursued two major tasks: the composition of a Romanian dictionary and {{the writing of the}} language's history from its origins to his day. Between 1898 and 1906, under the Academy's aegis, he worked on Dicționarul limbii române ("Dictionary of the Romanian Language"), together with several students. The project was sponsored by Maiorescu, who, like Philippide, deplored the excessive tendency to ascribe Latin etymologies. He managed to write definitions for letters A through D before having to interrupt his work; the manuscript covers 11,744 folio pages. He put together a bibliography <b>and</b> <b>plan</b> <b>for</b> the whole dictionary and collected over 600,000 files.|$|E
25|$|Carl Akeley died on November 18, 1926, {{only three}} days after the {{expedition}} arrived at Kabara, on the slope of the volcano Mount Mikeno. Derscheid undertook and completed many of the expedition's objectives after Akeley’s death: completing a topographical survey, attempting the first census of the mountain gorilla population in the area, conducting a general scientific survey and making recommendations for research sites. In 1928, he co-authored with Mary Jobe Akeley the final report <b>and</b> <b>plan</b> <b>for</b> the park’s administration to King Albert I of Belgium. She repeatedly refers to the expedition as the Akeley-Derscheid expedition in her book, although the financial backers of the expedition are named in the title. The Parc national Albert was ceremonially opened on October 19, 1930. It was placed under the authority of an Administrative Council with twenty-one members, with the Prince Albert de Ligne as president and Derscheid as secretary. A board was also created for which Jean-Marie Derscheid was named director.|$|E

Instructions to the Invasion Committees stated: [...] "...every citizen will regard it as his duty to hinder and frustrate the enemy and help our own forces by every means that ingenuity can devise and common sense suggest." ...|$|E
