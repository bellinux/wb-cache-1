5|$|COPD {{is a type}} of obstructive {{lung disease}} in which chronic incompletely {{reversible}} poor airflow (airflow limitation) and inability to breathe out fully (<b>air</b> <b>trapping)</b> exist. The poor airflow is the result of breakdown of lung tissue (known as emphysema) and small airways disease (known as obstructive bronchiolitis). The relative contributions of these two factors vary between people. Severe destruction of small airways can lead to the formation of large air pockets—known as bullae—that replace lung tissue. This form of disease is called bullous emphysema.|$|E
5|$|Narrowing of the airways occurs due to {{inflammation}} and scarring within them. This {{contributes to the}} inability to breathe out fully. The greatest reduction in air flow occurs when breathing out, as the pressure in the chest is compressing the airways at this time. This can result in more air from the previous breath remaining within the lungs when the next breath is started, resulting {{in an increase in}} the total volume of air in the lungs at any given time, a process called hyperinflation or <b>air</b> <b>trapping.</b> Hyperinflation from exercise is linked to shortness of breath in COPD, as it is less comfortable to breathe in when the lungs are already partly full. Hyperinflation may also worsen during an exacerbation.|$|E

25|$|The {{theoretical}} {{concern for}} asthmatic divers is that pulmonary obstruction, <b>air</b> <b>trapping</b> and hyperinflation may increase risk for pulmonary barotrauma, and the diver may {{be exposed to}} environmental factors that {{increase the risk of}} bronchospasm and the development of an acute asthmatic attack which could lead to panic and drowning. As of 2016, there is no epidemiological evidence for an increased relative risk of pulmonary barotrauma, decompression sickness or death among divers with asthma. This evidence only accounts for asthmatics with mild disease and the actual risk for severe or uncontrolled asthmatics, may be higher.|$|E
50|$|Exhaled volumes are {{measured}} by a pulmonary function test or simple spirometry, leading to an elevated residual volume and a measurement of forced expiratory volume. <b>Air</b> <b>trapping</b> is often incidentally diagnosed on computed tomography (CT) scanning.

50|$|<b>Air</b> <b>trapping</b> in {{the lungs}} of COPD {{patients}} causes the diaphragm to be pushed down and flattened, which reduces the effect of contraction of the diaphragm during inspiration.

40|$|Complete wetting {{is crucial}} for {{efficient}} recombination of powders. On the powder bed scale, wetting is governed solely by capillary forces and the resistance to flow, i. e. spontaneous imbibition. Slow or incomplete imbibition of the powder bed may lead to gelling of the liquid front, which will stop the recombination process and cause the formation of lumps, which is usually undesirable. In this study, the spontaneous imbibition of powder beds consisting of spray-dried dairy powders with diverse morphologies has been investigated. Uniform radial spreading of the imbibition front was seen in all the beds, but {{a large amount of}} <b>air</b> was <b>trapped</b> in the inter-particle free space in the imbibed volume. A positive correlation was found between bed porosity and the fraction of <b>air</b> <b>trapped</b> in the bed after imbibition. Since the amount of <b>trapped</b> <b>air</b> was calculated as a fraction of the porosity of the dry bed, this relation was unexpected. The large fraction of <b>air</b> <b>trapped</b> in the bed and the uniform radial spreading of the imbibition front indicate considerable heterogeneity of bed on the microscopic scale, but a homogenous structure on the macroscopic scale. Possible explanations of the large fraction of <b>trapped</b> <b>air</b> are the presence of local dead-end structures in the bed and film flow of the imbibing liquid...|$|R

5000|$|<b>Air</b> <b>trapping,</b> {{also called}} gas trapping, is an {{abnormal}} retention of {{air in the}} lungs where {{it is difficult to}} exhale completely. [...] It is observed in obstructive lung diseases such as asthma, bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome and chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases such as emphysema and chronic bronchitis.|$|E
50|$|Several {{tests are}} often needed to {{correctly}} diagnose bronchiolitis obliterans, including chest x-rays, diffusing {{capacity of the}} lung tests (DLCO), spirometry, lung volume tests, high-resolution CT (HRCT), and lung biopsy. Diffusing capacity of the lung (DLCO) tests are usually normal; people with early-stage BO {{are more likely to}} have normal DLCO. Spirometry tests usually show fixed airway obstructions and sometimes restriction, where the lungs can't expand fully. Lung volume tests may show hyperinflation (excessive air in lungs caused by <b>air</b> <b>trapping).</b> HRCT can also show <b>air</b> <b>trapping</b> when the person being scanned breathes out completely; it can also show thickening in the airway and haziness in the lungs. Transthoracic lung biopsies are preferable for diagnosis of constrictive BO compared to transbronchial biopsies; regardless of the type of biopsy, a diagnosis may only be achieved by examination of multiple samples.|$|E
50|$|<b>Air</b> <b>trapping</b> {{represents}} poorly aerated lung, but {{on its own}} is clinically benign. It is {{a common}} problem for smokers who dive. On diving the lung volume collapses and pushes air into the poorly aerated regions. On arising from a deep depth, these air-trapped areas of lung expand. This places great pressure on the lung tissue which can rupture.|$|E
2500|$|When a {{piece of}} iceberg ice melts, a fizzing sound called the [...] "Bergie Seltzer" [...] is produced. This sound is made when the {{water-ice}} interface reaches compressed <b>air</b> bubbles <b>trapped</b> in the ice. As this happens, each bubble bursts, making a 'popping' sound. The bubbles contain <b>air</b> <b>trapped</b> in snow layers {{very early in the}} history of the ice, that eventually got buried to a given depth (up to several kilometers) and pressurized as it transformed into firn then to glacial ice.|$|R
