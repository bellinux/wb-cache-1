5|$|The 25,400-strong Allied {{left flank}} corps under William Beresford began its advance on 16 February, {{aiming for the}} village of Bidache. Beresford's corps {{was made up of}} the 4th, 6th, 7th and Light Division as well as Somerset's and Vivian's cavalry. Altogether, Wellington had 42,000 foot {{soldiers}} and 3,000 horsemen marching to the east. Reacting to the Allied pressure, Soult joined two of the three divisions north of the Adour to the four divisions farther east. This action created a field army of 32,000 infantry and 3,800 cavalry. The French divisions were directed to form a new line behind the Gave d'Oloron River, along a line from Peyrehorade to Sauveterre-de-Béarn to Navarrenx. On 17 February, Hill's corps forded the Saison River, breaching yet another French defensive line. The French marshal sent Abbé's division to help defend Bayonne, a questionable move which left his army with fewer troops to fight Wellington. By 18 February, Soult had his troops in position on the Gave d'Oloron. That day the weather broke again, causing <b>another</b> <b>pause</b> in operations.|$|E
2500|$|No {{doubt the}} old General remembered (the) costly {{charges against the}} entrenched enemy during the last war. And maybe hesitated at that memory. Jules then declared, [...] "If you {{do not wish to}} order a charge, General, I should like to volunteer." [...] Then after <b>another</b> <b>pause</b> he pleaded, [...] "May I volunteer? We can't stay here, can we?" ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{artillery}} {{plan had}} the first belt of creeping barrage beginning [...] beyond the jumping-off tapes. After three minutes the barrage was to creep forward by [...] lifts in four minutes for , when the machine-gun barrage would begin, then every six minutes to the protective line, [...] beyond first objective. During the pause the barrage was to move [...] further to hit German counter-attacks and then suddenly return. At [...] minutes, it was to advance in [...] lifts every eight minutes to the final objective. After <b>another</b> <b>pause</b> the barrage was to creep forward at hourly intervals for [...] into the German defences.

2500|$|The Battle of Le Transloy {{began in}} good weather and Le Sars was {{captured}} on 7 October. Pauses {{were made from}} [...] due to rain and [...] to allow time for a methodical bombardment, {{when it became clear}} that the German defence had recovered from earlier defeats. Haig consulted with the army commanders and on [...] reduced the scope of operations by cancelling the Third Army plans and reducing the Reserve Army and Fourth Army attacks to limited operations, in co-operation with the French Sixth Army. <b>Another</b> <b>pause</b> followed before operations resumed on 23 October on the northern flank of the Fourth Army, with a delay during more bad weather on the right flank of the Fourth Army and on the French Sixth Army front, until 5 November. Next day the Fourth Army ceased offensive operations, except for small attacks intended to improve positions and divert German attention from attacks being made by the Reserve/Fifth Army. Larger operations resumed in January 1917.|$|E
60|$|There was <b>another</b> <b>pause</b> of uncomfortably {{protracted}} duration.|$|E
60|$|<b>Another</b> <b>pause</b> ensued; Marianne {{was greatly}} agitated, and it ended thus.|$|E
60|$|After <b>another</b> long <b>pause,</b> Pigling {{pushed a}} {{peppermint}} under the door. It was sucked in immediately.|$|R
60|$|Eagerly, with an ardour to show {{themselves}} {{intimate with}} {{the affairs of}} towns, as {{is the way of}} rustics, they related to me what already I had gathered to be the vulgar version of Fifanti's death. Each spoke in turn, cutting in the moment <b>another</b> <b>paused</b> to breathe, and sometimes they spoke together, each anxious to have the extent of his information revealed and appreciated.|$|R
60|$|There was <b>another</b> {{thoughtful}} <b>pause,</b> for the detective's assertions were so astonishing {{that they}} fairly overwhelmed his hearers.|$|R
60|$|There was <b>another</b> <b>pause,</b> {{and nobody}} seemed {{inclined}} to answer the question.|$|E
60|$|There was <b>another</b> <b>pause.</b> Drummond {{raised his}} book and went on reading.|$|E
60|$|He made <b>another</b> <b>pause,</b> and his {{thoughts}} ran off upon a fresh track.|$|E
60|$|The {{four members}} of Council looked at one <b>another,</b> and <b>paused.</b> 'Shall he be brought here, ma'am?' asked Rokesmith.|$|R
60|$|Suddenly a loud murmur arose {{and spread}} along {{the stream of}} church-goers, and one group after <b>another</b> <b>paused</b> and looked backward. At {{the far end of}} the street, men, {{accompanied}} by a miscellaneous group of onlookers, were slowly carrying something--a body stretched on a door. Slowly they passed along the middle of the street, lined all the way with awe-struck faces, till they turned aside and paused in the red sunlight before Dempster's door.|$|R
60|$|There was <b>another</b> long <b>pause.</b> His eyes, as {{he looked}} at me, seemed to take every shade of colour that could make eyes ugly.|$|R
60|$|<b>Another</b> <b>pause.</b> They look at {{each other}} again, still more seriously than before.|$|E
60|$|There came {{a little}} inarticulate murmur from the girl, and then <b>another</b> <b>pause.</b>|$|E
60|$|<b>Another</b> <b>pause,</b> {{during which}} Señor Montefalderon and Captain Spike looked {{significantly}} at each other.|$|E
6000|$|<b>Another</b> long <b>pause.</b> [...] "They told me Caston {{had been}} killed. But someone hinted--or I guessed--that {{there was more}} in it than an {{ordinary}} casualty.|$|R
50|$|After <b>another</b> grand <b>pause,</b> {{the piece}} is {{concluded}} by a fugue, again based on {{the beginning of the}} main theme, and a lengthy and joyful coda.|$|R
6000|$|... "Sue," [...] said Adeline, after <b>another</b> little <b>pause,</b> [...] "I don't {{know what}} you'll think of me, for what I've done. Mr. Hilary has been here--" ...|$|R
60|$|There was <b>another</b> <b>pause,</b> and {{she stood}} with a hand defensively {{clutching}} the knob.|$|E

6000|$|... "Are {{there no}} tidings for us, mademoiselle?" [...] asked Eve, after <b>another</b> long <b>pause,</b> {{during which she}} had poured out her {{gratitude}} in trembling, but secret thanksgivings.|$|R
6000|$|... "Not my sort of ghost wouldn't," [...] said Mr. Polly, {{emerging}} from <b>another</b> long <b>pause.</b> [...] "I'd be {{a sort of}} diaphalous feeling--just mellowish and warmish like...." ...|$|R

60|$|Then {{there was}} <b>another</b> <b>pause,</b> {{at the end}} of which Mrs. Broughton got up from the sofa.|$|E
60|$|Suddenly, amid this tumult of oaths and drunken cries, men became {{conscious}} of a quiet monotone which underlay all other sounds and obtruded itself at every {{pause in the}} uproar. Gradually first one man and then <b>another</b> <b>paused</b> to listen, until {{there was a general}} cessation of the hubbub, and every eye was turned in the direction whence this quiet stream of words flowed. There, mounted upon a barrel, was Elias B. Hopkins, the newest of the inhabitants of Jackman's Gulch, with a good-humoured smile upon his resolute face.|$|R
6000|$|As {{they went}} from one small {{whitewashed}} room to <b>another,</b> <b>pausing</b> to examine some rude relic of early mission days, Isabel led in the conversation. [...] "It {{is all very}} interesting," [...] she declared. [...] "And the church has been so consistently restored," [...] she went on. [...] "I do not wonder that you are proud of the only mission in California {{which has not been}} treated to some shocking innovation. Even the dear old church at San Gabriel has taken on a modern redwood ceiling utterly devoid of art's religion." ...|$|R
