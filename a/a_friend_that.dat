5|$|Lowell did {{not know}} what {{vocation}} to choose after graduating, and he vacillated among business, the ministry, medicine, and law. He ultimately enrolled at Harvard Law School in 1840 and was admitted to the bar two years later. While studying law, however, he contributed poems and prose articles to various magazines. During this time, he was admittedly depressed and often had suicidal thoughts. He once confided to <b>a</b> <b>friend</b> <b>that</b> he held a cocked pistol to his forehead and considered killing himself at the age of 20.|$|E
5|$|Narayan {{moved to}} Mysore {{to live with}} his family when his father was {{transferred}} to the Maharajah's College High School. The well-stocked library at the school, as well as his father's own, fed his reading habit, and he started writing as well. After completing high school, Narayan failed the university entrance examination and spent a year at home reading and writing; he subsequently passed the examination in 1926 and joined Maharaja College of Mysore. It took Narayan four years to obtain his bachelor's degree, a year longer than usual. After being persuaded by <b>a</b> <b>friend</b> <b>that</b> taking a master's degree (M.A.) would kill his interest in literature, he briefly held a job as a school teacher; however, he quit in protest when the headmaster of the school asked him to substitute for the physical training master. The experience made Narayan realise that the only career for him was in writing, and he decided to stay at home and write novels. His first published work was a book review of Development of Maritime Laws of 17th-Century England. Subsequently, he started writing the occasional local interest story for English newspapers and magazines. Although the writing did not pay much (his income for the first year was nine rupees and twelve annas), he had a regular life and few needs, and his family and friends respected and supported his unorthodox choice of career. In 1930, Narayan wrote his first novel, Swami and Friends, an effort ridiculed by his uncle and rejected by a string of publishers. With this book, Narayan created Malgudi, a town that creatively reproduced the social sphere of the country; while it ignored the limits imposed by colonial rule, it also grew with the various socio-political changes of British and post-independence India.|$|E

5|$|Trevor {{eventually}} {{discovers that}} Michael set him and Brad up, and that Brad {{is not in}} jail but buried in Michael's fake grave. This leads to Trevor vowing to kill Michael, but needing him alive for one last heist. When that heist is successful, Trevor is so pleased that he lifts the death vow but still hates Michael. Near {{the end of the}} game, Franklin is given a choice: kill Trevor, kill Michael, or let them live and face their enemies. If the latter is chosen, Trevor kills Federal Investigation Bureau (FIB) agent Steve Haines, before capturing Weston, and killing him alongside Michael and Franklin. Trevor once again considers Michael his friend, albeit <b>a</b> <b>friend</b> <b>that</b> he hates, which Michael accepts. If the second option is chosen, Trevor ends all contact with Franklin and says to stay away from him after finding out about Michael's death. If the first option is chosen, Franklin meets up with Trevor, before chasing him with Michael to an oil plant. When Trevor crashes into an oil tank, causing himself to be covered in oil, either Franklin or Michael shoot the oil, setting Trevor alight and killing him. If Trevor and Michael are spared, they continue to spend time together with Franklin, during which Trevor eventually admits that he over-reacted after learning the truth about Brad, and refers to himself and Michael as friends.|$|E

Ismail was also reportedly worried about Razak's political plans, as he intended to rehabilitate Mahathir – a move opposed by Ismail, who preferred Musa Hitam to Mahathir.|$|E
25|$|On 10 March 2012, Sanal Edamaruku {{investigated}} {{a so-called}} miracle in Vile Parle, where a Jesus statue had started weeping {{and concluded that}} the problem was caused by faulty drainage. Later that day, during a TV discussion with some church members, Edamaruku accused the Catholic Church of miracle-mongering. On 10 April, Angelo Fernandes, President of the Maharashtra Christian Youth Forum, filed a police complaint against Edamaruku under Indian Penal Code Section 295A. In July while on a tour in Finland, Edamaruku was informed by <b>a</b> <b>friend</b> <b>that</b> his house was visited by the police. Since, the offence is not bailable, Edamaruku decided to stay in Finland.|$|E
25|$|The album {{consists}} of five tracks with song durations ranging from 7 to 17 minutes {{that deal with}} events and {{people who had been}} important in Newsom's life in the year previous to recording. These events include the sudden death of Newsom's best friend, a continuing illness and a tumultuous relationship. The album was named after the city of Ys, which according to myth was built on the coast of Brittany and later swallowed by the ocean. The albums' title was the last element to be confirmed and was a result of a dream that Joanna had which featured the letters Y and S and a book recommended by <b>a</b> <b>friend</b> <b>that</b> contained reference to the myth.|$|E

25|$|Topology, as a {{well-defined}} mathematical discipline, originates {{in the early}} part of the twentieth century, but some isolated results can be traced back several centuries. Among these are certain questions in geometry investigated by Leonhard Euler. His 1736 paper on the Seven Bridges of Königsberg is regarded as one of the first practical applications of topology. On 14 November 1750 Euler wrote to <b>a</b> <b>friend</b> <b>that</b> he had realised the importance of the edges of a polyhedron. This led to his polyhedron formula, V − E + F = 2 (where V, E and F respectively indicate the number of vertices, edges and faces of the polyhedron). Some authorities regard this analysis as the first theorem, signalling the birth of topology.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to Abarca and Pineda, another person {{was arrested by}} the authorities that day in Santa María Aztahuacán, Iztapalapa. Federal agents stated that the individual was Noemí Berumen Rodríguez, who was believed to have aided the couple in their hiding by lending them her house. She {{is a friend of}} the couple's 25-year-old daughter Yazareth Liz Abarca Pineda, who was taken into custody along with her parents. However, Yazareth was only considered an eye-witness and does not face criminal charges. Authorities were able to link Berumen with the Abarcas due to her friendship with Yazareth and her presence on social media. They discovered that Yazareth had a picture with <b>a</b> <b>friend</b> <b>that</b> lived in Iztapalapa, who followed Berumen online.|$|E
25|$|Piaget {{argued that}} {{children}} and adults used speech for different purposes. In order to confirm his argument, he experimented analyzing a child’s interpretation of a story. In the experiment, the child listened to a story and then told <b>a</b> <b>friend</b> <b>that</b> same story in his/her/their own words. The {{purpose of this study}} was to examine how children verbalize and understand each other without adult intervention. Piaget wanted to examine the limits of naturalistic observation, in order to understand a child’s reasoning. He realized the difficulty of studying children's thoughts, as it is hard to know if a child is pretending to believe their thoughts or not. Piaget was the pioneer researcher to examine children’s conversations in a social context – starting from examining their speech and actions – where children were comfortable and spontaneous (Kose, 1987).|$|E

25|$|Fairbridge {{applied to}} the Rhodes {{trustees}} for a scholarship, feeling that once in England he would find ways of developing his scheme. He was informed by the Rhodes trustees that if he passed the Oxford entrance examination his application would be favourably considered, and in 1906 he went to England to be privately coached. After his fourth attempt, he succeeded in passing the required examination. In October 1908 Fairbridge entered Exeter College, Oxford, with a Rhodes Scholarship. In 1909 he published an anthology of poetry entitled Veld Verse and Other Lines. He began to write on child emigration until he was advised by <b>a</b> <b>friend</b> <b>that</b> speaking would be more effective. Fairbridge was rebuffed by the British South Africa Company, which informed him that they considered Rhodesia too young {{a country in which}} to start child emigration. The Premier of Newfoundland, however, provided support for the concept.|$|E
25|$|When he was 37, {{he married}} his 22-year-old backup singer and dancer Mayte Garcia, on Valentine's Day 1996.

When Garcia turned 17 she moved to Prince's home, Paisley Park and he became her legal guardian. At 19, Prince {{told her it was}} time to go on birth control and took her virginity just one week later. They had a son named Amiir Gregory Nelson on October 16, 1996; he was born with Pfeiffer syndrome and died a week later. In a later interview, she stated that she and Prince also lost a pregnancy early on to a miscarriage in late 1997. The couple eventually divorced in June 2000. Garcia said that all she wanted to take from the union was the urn with their son's ashes.
