5|$|The name Burnham {{is derived}} from Burnhamm, <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>called</b> in the will of King Alfred, made up from the Old English words Burna meaning stream and Hamm for enclosure. On-Sea was added later as {{there are several other}} towns of the same name in England.|$|E
5|$|Another {{potential}} source of income was {{the prospect of a}} Spanish dowry from a marriage between Charles, Prince of Wales, and Infanta Maria Anna of Spain. The policy of the Spanish Match, <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>called,</b> was also attractive to James as a way to maintain peace with Spain and avoid the additional costs of a war. Peace could be maintained as effectively by keeping the negotiations alive as by consummating the match—which may explain why James protracted the negotiations for almost a decade.|$|E
5|$|Even {{before the}} {{announcement}} proclaiming the ACC's expansion to 12teams, several cities and sports organizations were preparing bids {{to host the}} ACC Football Championship Game. The prospect {{of tens of thousands}} of visitors could provide a multimillion-dollar economic boost for a host city and region while requiring few, if any, additional facilities. One early contender was the city of Charlotte, North Carolina. Even before Virginia Tech, Miami, and Boston College were chosen as the ACC's picks to expand, Carolinas Stadium Corporation, the owner and operator of Charlotte's Ericsson Stadium (<b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>called</b> then) lobbied heavily for Charlotte's selection. Other early options included Orlando, Tampa, Atlanta, and Jacksonville.|$|E

5|$|With {{the spread}} of Christianity Coracesium, <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>called,</b> became a bishopric. Its bishop Theodulus {{took part in the}} First Council of Constantinople in 381, Matidianus in the Council of Ephesus in 431, Obrimus in the Council of Chalcedon in 451, and Nicephorus (Nicetas) in the Third Council of Constantinople in 680. Coracesium was a suffragan of the {{metropolitan}} see of Side, the capital of the Roman province of Pamphylia Prima, to which Coracesium belonged. It continued to be mentioned in the Notitiae Episcopatuum as late as the 12th or 13th century. No longer a residential bishopric, Coracesium is today listed by the Catholic Church as a titular see.|$|E
5|$|As the {{prospect}} of war with Japan became more likely, so also did {{the need to make}} appropriate arrangements for leading the defence of Australia. In 1935, Lavarack had recommended that in the event of war, the Military Board be abolished and its powers vested in a Commander-in-chief. In April 1941, the Minister for the Army, Percy Spender, recommended that this now be done, with Sturdee becoming Commander in Chief of the Australian Military Forces. Instead, the government elected to adopt the British system, in which the Military Board (or Army Council <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>called</b> there) continued to operate, with a separate GOC Home Forces. On 5 August 1941, Major General Sir Iven Mackay was appointed to this newly created post. However, the idea of a Commander in Chief did not go away and editorials in the Sunday Telegraph and The Sydney Morning Herald advocated the appointment.|$|E
5|$|Due to the {{practical}} limitations {{of meetings with}} 74 members {{on a regular basis}} (the total number of members from the five Chambers), the Charter called for a board of directors comprising nineteen members of the five Chambers. Van Rensselaer was chosen a member of this College of XIX, <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>called.</b> It is said that care was exercised in the selection of the directors of each chamber, and only men of wealth and the highest known integrity were eligible for the trust. Van Rensselaer was apparently known as an unusually clear-headed man and an able and practical merchant who did not limit himself to his own branch of trade. These qualities presumably garnered the trust needed to be elected to the College of XIX.|$|E

5|$|Following {{the defeat}} of Japan in the Second World War, anti-Japanese {{resistance}} movements in Malaya turned their attention towards the British, who had moved to quickly retake control of the colony, valuing it {{as a source of}} rubber and tin. The fact that the guerrillas were primarily Malayan-Chinese Communists meant that the British attempt to quell the uprising was supported by the Muslim Malay majority, on the understanding that once the insurgency had been quelled, independence would be granted. The Malayan Emergency, <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>called,</b> began in 1948 and lasted until 1960, but by 1957, Britain felt confident enough to grant independence to the Federation of Malaya within the Commonwealth. In 1963, the 11 states of the federation together with Singapore, Sarawak and North Borneo joined to form Malaysia, but in 1965 Chinese-majority Singapore was expelled from the union following tensions between the Malay and Chinese populations. Brunei, which had been a British protectorate since 1888, declined to join the union and maintained its status until independence in 1984.|$|E

25|$|A {{great deal}} of funk is rhythmically based on a two-celled onbeat/offbeat structure, which {{originated}} in sub-Saharan African music traditions. New Orleans appropriated the bifurcated structure from the Afro-Cuban mambo and conga in the late 1940s, and made it its own. New Orleans funk, <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>called,</b> gained international acclaim largely because James Brown's rhythm section used it to great effect.|$|E

A new, more centrally located, library designed by Frank Furness opened its doors in 1880 at Juniper and Locust Street.|$|E
