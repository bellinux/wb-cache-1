Liverpool had been forced to enter the first qualifying round of the 2005–06 UEFA Champions League, despite being champions.

UEFA granted them special dispensation to enter the competition as holders.

5|$|Manstein {{took part}} in a conference on 22 August 1939 where Hitler {{underlined}} to his commanders the need for the physical destruction of Poland as a nation. After the war, he would state in his memoirs that he did not recognise <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> meeting that Hitler was going to pursue a policy of extermination against the Poles. He did become aware of the policy later on, as he and other Wehrmacht generals received reports on the activities of the Einsatzgruppen, the Schutzstaffel (SS) death squads tasked with following the army into Poland to kill intellectuals and other civilians. These squads were also assigned to round up Jews and others for relocation to ghettos and Nazi concentration camps. Manstein later faced three charges of war crimes relating to Jewish and civilian deaths in the sectors under his control, and the mistreatment and deaths of prisoners of war.|$|E

5|$|The {{flag was}} {{examined}} in the early 20th century by A.J.B. Wace of the Victoria and Albert Museum, who concluded that the silk was woven in either Syria or Rhodes, and the darns {{were made in the}} Near East. It was his opinion that the flag, in its original state, would have been quite precious, possibly a relic like the shirt of a saint. The belief <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> examination was the MacLeods were descended from Harald Hardrada, who spent some time in Constantinople in the 11th century. In line with this belief, it was suggested that the flag may have passed from Harald Hardrada down to the eponymous ancestor of the clan—Leod. The MacLeod Estate Office (Dunvegan Castle) website claims that experts have dated the flag to the 4th and 7th centuries—hundreds of years before the Crusades. The flag is currently held in Dunvegan Castle, along with other notable heirlooms such as the Dunvegan Cup and Sir Rory Mor's Horn.|$|E
5|$|When {{this episode}} was being produced, The Bachelorette was a {{bigger and more}} {{prolific}} program than when this episode was originally broadcast. In addition, ABC was not doing very well <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> episode's production. The production staff encountered some trouble when deciding what Peter would be doing in the lobby with Cleveland during his Bachelorette audition; although the series could never come up with ideas they deemed to be suitable, they intended for Peter to put his buttocks in an aquarium tank in order to embarrass Cleveland and make him want to leave. This scene was not used, and the production staff used a scene of Peter putting his naked buttocks on Cleveland's naked buttocks; they also shortened this more detailed version and used the less-detailed current version.|$|E
5|$|Around 2012, {{development}} of The Witness for the next-generation of consoles with improved hardware capabilities became a possibility, and Blow {{and his team}} started looking at this opportunity. They had discounted the Wii U, again citing low specs, and decided {{to choose between the}} PlayStation 4 and the Xbox One platform. <b>At</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> decision, Sony was able to provide hardware information and development kits. Sony has also sought out independent developers like Blow to learn about the upcoming PlayStation 4 in preparation for its launch, while Microsoft had not yet released firm specifications for their console. Blow opted to go with the PlayStation platform; this decision was also aided by representatives from Sony that were interested in bringing the game to their system, and a larger trend of Sony to bring more downloadable and independently-developed games to their next console in contrast to Microsoft's tighter controls. Blow affirmed that there was no monetary deal involved with this decision. Blow also later acknowledged that he has had difficulties working with Microsoft in the past, and had previously explained several of the issues he had to go through with Microsoft to release his earlier game, Braid. The Witness had been planned as a launch-window title for the PlayStation 4 in 2013, a time-limited console exclusive. The Windows and iOS versions, at this point, were planned to be released alongside the PlayStation 4 version, barring any development delays that Blow and his team encountered. Other console versions would come later, if they opted to develop for them.|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{determine}} whether the circadian rhythm of circulating levels of insulin-like growth factor binding protein- 1 (IGFBP- 1) is evident <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>of</b> delivery. DESIGN: Prospective observational study in six pregnant women and cross-sectional study in 65 women <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>of</b> delivery. SUBJECTS: Six pregnant women sampled {{over a period of}} 24 hours, 23 women sampled <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>of</b> elective caesarean section, and 42 women sampled <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>of</b> vaginal delivery. RESULTS: In the women sampled serially over a 24 hour period there was an obvious circadian rhythm of IGFBP- 1 with a peak between 01. 00 and 09. 00 hours. In <b>the</b> women sampled <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>of</b> delivery there was no evidence for any relationship between <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>of</b> delivery and maternal or fetal levels of IGFBP- 1.

30|$|In addition, an {{assessment}} of the working situation requires various intertask relations to correctly estimate the working situation. For example, a semantic relation is more important than a geometric relation when determining whether the robot is approaching an object or is about to collide with that object. The movement <b>of</b> <b>the</b> robot <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>of</b> a collision resembles that <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> approach operation, but the semantic connection between the target object and <b>the</b> robot <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>of</b> collision is different than that <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> approach operation.

40|$|Introduction & Objective: Hospitalization can {{significantly}} disrupt sleeping patterns. considering {{the prevalence of}} insomnia and widespread use of benzodiazepines and other hypnotics in hospitalized patients, we conducted this study to assess the quality of sleep and hypnotic drug use in hospitalized adult patients in 2007. Materials & Methods: This descriptive analytical cross-sectional study involved an assessment of sleep quality for patients whose consent had been obtained when admitted to the internal ward of Hamadan Ekbatan hospital. The Pittsburg sleep quality index (PSQI) {{was used to measure}} the quality of sleep in patients and completed <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>of</b> admission and discharge. Also the relation of factors such as age, sex. Marital status, education and sedating drug use prior to and during hospitalization with sleep quality were assessed. 300 patients entered this study and completed PSQI sleep questionnaires two twice, <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>of</b> admission & discharge. Results: <b>At</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>of</b> admission only 36 % of patients had good sleep quality (PSQI score < 5) while this percent decreased to 18. 3 % <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>of</b> discharge. Mean global PSQI score was 7. 6 <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>of</b> admission versus 9. 4 <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>of</b> discharge indicating <b>the</b> patients’ worse sleep quality <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>of</b> discharge (Pv< 0. 05). 23 % of patients received hypnotic drugs while in the hospital with no evidence of preadmission hypnotic use. Benzodiazepines were prescribed for all of them. Conclusion: Quality <b>of</b> sleep <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>of</b> discharge was significantly worse than it <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>of</b> admission and it seems that despite widespread use of sedative drug in the hospital, there are still patients with poor sleep quality in the hospital...|$|R
