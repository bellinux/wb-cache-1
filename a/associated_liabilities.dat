40|$|With {{this paper}} we explore how differing forms of {{entrepreneurial}} learning are facilitated {{within the context of}} business incubation. To support new technology venturing, university business incubators offer their tenants professional support and advice plus exposure to entrepreneurial networks with the objective of assisting them to address <b>associated</b> <b>liabilities</b> of newness. Accordingly, new venture founders are offered access to a range of resources to assist them in learning how to commercialize technological ideas. Entrepreneurial learning can be deemed explorative or exploitative; we explore how business incubation assists entrepreneurs to leverage these differing learning approaches to generate a secure resource base within the firm. From case-study evidence we suggest business incubation is effective in aligning a balance of learning approaches which support future growth prospects and add competitive advantage to young, fragile firms. We conclude by suggesting that incubator managers are critical actors in facilitating appropriate learning environments for new technology entrepreneurs. ...|$|E

40|$|Structured finance {{instruments}} {{represent a}} form of securitization technology which can be defined by the characteristics of pooling of financial assets, delinking of the credit risk of the asset pool from the credit risk of the originating intermediary, and issuance of tranched liabilities backed by the asset pool. Tranching effectively accomplishes a "slicing" of the loss distribution of the underlying asset pool. This paper reviews the finance literature relating to security design and securitization, {{in order to identify}} the economic forces underlying the creation of SF instruments. A question addressed is under what circumstances one would expect to observe pooling alone (as with traditional securitization) versus pooling and tranching combined (as with structured finance). It is argued that asymmetric information problems between an originator and investors can lead to pooling of assets and tranching of <b>associated</b> <b>liabilities,</b> as opposed to pooling alone. The more acute the problem of adverse selection, the more likely is value to be created through issuance of tranched assetbacked securities. Structured finance instruments also help to complete incomplete financial markets, and they may also appear in response to market segmentation. Structured finance, securitization...|$|E

Despite repeated judicial scrutiny {{at the highest}} level, the doctrine's scope, proper doctrinal basis and function {{in relation to other}} modes of complicity remain uncertain. This article examines the doctrine's elements and underlying principles. It argues that while joint criminal enterprise is largely used to make individuals liable for offences committed by their associates in excess of the common criminal purpose, its proper function is to police the limits of <b>associate</b> <b>liability</b> and thus to exculpate rather than inculpate. The doctrine governs not only instances of accessorial liability; it also applies where the parties involved are joint principal offenders. As this puts into question the prevalent view that joint criminal enterprise is a form of secondary participation that results in accessorial liability, the article concludes that it is best seen as a doctrine sui generis. ...|$|R

Most portfolio optimization methods utilize linear or quadratic programming and require the user to specify lhe asset and liability attributes and cash flows into the program. The programmer must also supply an objective function to allow the program to find the optimal asset mix for the <b>associated</b> <b>liabilities.</b> Two problems with this approach are that the liability cash flows are fairly static and that one must frequeutly rebalauce the portfolio. An alternative approach would be to develop a corporate model of bolh the assets and liabilities and incorporate various econon,ic sce-narios as input into the model. Asset. strategies would be measured against a specific objective function that is calculated by the corl) orate model. Unfortunately, the majority of inaximization algorithms avail-able are very t ilne consuming, and obtaining a reasonable portfl) lio mix becomes impractical.

40|$|Executive Summary This report {{presents}} {{a set of}} pragmatic and workable generic procedures, suggested best practices and other recommendations and observations for the safe and sustainable closure of geological CO 2 storage sites. These have been distilled {{from the results of}} the CO 2 CARE project and represent the most important messages that will be of benefit to Regulators, storage site Operators and other stakeholders. Key observations and recommendations are set out below. Transfer of responsibility for all legal obligations for a storage site from the Operator to the Competent Authority (CA) marks a radical change in the balance of responsibilities between stakeholders in a storage project. The CA is ultimately the representative of the public, and this implies an acceptance by the public of the benefits and <b>associated</b> <b>liabilities.</b> Acceptance of the Transfer Report and transfer of responsibility for all legal obligations for the site to the CA marks the end of a process that began with site selection and a permit application by the Operator many years previously. It is vital that a relationship based on transparency and openness should have developed between the Operator and Regulator during that period, to build mutual confidence into the regulatory process and, ultimately, the transfer of responsibility. Continuity of knowledge through changes of personnel should also be ensured. This, together with the regular reporting requirements that most jurisdictions require (e. g. those required under the EU Directive) should help to ensure that the transfer of responsibility proceeds smoothly and to the satisfaction of all parties involve...|$|E
40|$|The {{practice}} of using constructed wetlands to treat seleninmladen wastewater is gaining {{popularity in the}} linited States and elsewhere. However, proponents of treatment wetlands often overlook important ecological liabilities and regulatory implications when developing new methods and applications. Their research studies typically seek to answer a basic performance question-are treatment wetlands effective in improving water quality-rather than answering an implicit safety question-are they hazardous to wildlife. Nevertheless, wetland owners are responsible for both the operational performance of treatment wetlands {{and the health of}} animals that use them. This is true even if wetlands were not created with the intent of providing wildlife habitat; the owner is still legally responsible for toxic hazards. If poisoning of fish and wildlife occurs, the owner can be prosecuted under a variety of federal and state laws, for example, the Migratory Bird Treaty Act and the Endangered Species Act. In considering this type of treatment technology it is important to document the selenium content of the wastewater, understand how it cycles and accumulates in the environment, and evaluate the threat it may pose to fish and wildlife before deciding whether or not to proceed with construction. Many of the potential hazards may not be obvious to project planners, particularly if there is no expressed intention for the wetland to provide wildlife habitat. Ecological risk assessment provides an approach to characterizing proposed treatment wetlands with respect to wildlife use, selenium contamination, and possible biological impacts. Proper application of this approach can reveal potential problems and the <b>associated</b> <b>liabilities,</b> and form the basis for selection of an environmentally sound treatment option.

40|$|Brownfields are {{properties}} for which redevelopment is hampered by known or suspected contamination and by concerns about <b>associated</b> <b>liability.</b> Because failing to redevelop brownfields may negatively affect welfare and the environment, {{a number of}} states have created voluntary programs to reduce liability risks and encourage redevelopment of brownfields. For clean or remediated properties, the state certifies that owners of such sites are not subject to federal or state liability under certain conditions. Certification could increase nearby property values because of decreased contamination risk and amenities associated with redeveloping the brownfield. This paper focuses on the Site Remediation Program in Illinois, and estimates the effect of brownfields certification on nearby property values. Employing several strategies to account for unobserved and time-varying variables that may be correlated with certification, I find that certification of a brownfield 0. 25 miles away raises property values by about one percent.

There are the following two opposing views on how loyalty programs should be accounted for: 1.

Credits granted to customers in a customer loyalty program can be accounted for as an expense incurred in respect of the initial sale (a provision for future cost approach). In Draft Interpretation D 20, Customer Loyalty Programs, the IFRIC rejects the use of the provision for future cost approach for all loyalty programs, as the IFRIC considers the multiple elements approach to be the most appropriate application of IAS 18.

40|$|At first 'sustainable mining' {{could be}} {{perceived}} as a paradox [...] minerals are widely held to be finite resources with rising consumption causing pressure on known resources. The true sustainability of mineral resources, however, is a much more complex picture and involves exploration, technology, economics, social and environmental issues, and advancing scientific knowledge [...] predicting future sustainability is therefore not a simple task. This paper presents the results from a landmark study on historical trends in Australian mining, including ore milled, ore grades, open cut versus underground mining, overburden/waste rock and economic resources. When complete data sets are compiled for specific metals, particular issues stand out with respect to sustainability [...] technological breakthroughs (e. g. flotation, carbon-in-pulp), new discoveries (e. g. uranium or U), price changes (e. g. Au, boom/bust cycles), social issues (e. g. strikes), etc. All of these issues are of prime importance in moving towards a semi-quantitative sustainability model of mineral resources and the mining industry. For the future, critical issues will continue to be declining ore grades (also ore quality and impurities), increased waste rock and <b>associated</b> <b>liabilities,</b> known economic resources, potential breakthrough technologies, and broader environmental constraints (e. g. carbon costs, water). For this latter area, many companies now report annually on sustainability performance [...] facilitating analysis of environmental sustainability with respect to production performance. By linking these two commonly disparate aspects [...] mining production and environmental/sustainability data [...] it becomes possible to better understand environmental sustainability and predict future constraints such as water requirements, greenhouse emissions, energy and reagent inputs, and the like.

40|$|Since their {{commercial}} introduction in 1996, {{genetically modified}} (GM) crops {{have been adopted}} by farmers around the world at impressive rates. In 2011, 180 million hectares of GM crops were cultivated by more than 15 million farmers in 29 countries. In the next decade, global adoption {{is expected to grow}} even faster as the research pipeline for new biotech traits and crops has increased almost fourfold in the last few years. The adoption of GM crops has led to increased productivity, while reducing pesticide use and the emissions of agricultural greenhouse gases, leading to broadly distributed economic benefits across the global food supply chain. Despite the rapid uptake of GM crops, the various social and economic benefits as well as the expanding rate innovation, the use of GM crops remains controversial in parts of the world. Despite the emergence of coexistence between GM, organic and conventional crops as a key policy and practical issue of global scale, there is no coherent literature that addresses it directly. Governments and market stakeholders in many countries are grappling with policy alternatives that settle conflicting property rights, minimize negative market externalities and <b>associated</b> <b>liabilities,</b> maximize the economic benefits of innovation and allow producer and consumer choice.

Continuity of knowledge through changes of personnel should also be ensured. This, together with the regular reporting requirements that most jurisdictions require (e. g. those required under the EU Directive) should help to ensure that the transfer of responsibility proceeds smoothly and to the satisfaction of all parties involved. When CO 2 injection at a storage site has ceased, the storage site is described in the EU CO 2 Storage Directive as being closed and the project life cycle enters the post-closure phase, leading to transfer of responsibility. During the post-closure phase the wells will not necessarily be sealed immediately, the site will continue to be monitored and reservoir management will continue, in accordance with the project risk assessment and management plan, which will have been updated at site closure. The main purpose of reservoir management in the post-closure phase is to demonstrate that the key regulatory requirements for transfer of storage site liability to the Competent Authority have been met. In the EU CO 2 Storage Directive these are: • Observed behaviour of the injected CO 2 conforms to the modelled behaviour • No detectable leakage • The storage site is evolving towards a situation of long-term stability Meeting these criteria involves demonstrating understanding of reservoir processes, the ability to make robust predictions of future behaviour and providing assurance against leakage. Demonstrating conformance between predictive models of reservoir performance and monitoring observations is technically challenging because a unique and perfect match is near-impossible to achieve. CO 2 CARE recommends that conformance is based on demonstrating that predictive modelling capability increases systematically with time as monitoring data is progressively acquired. This indicates that storage processes are well understood and the modelling approach is robust. If predictive modelling is robust, uncertainties will progressively reduce as more monitoring data is acquired through time. Nevertheless it is necessary to maintain a sufficiently wide range of predictive scenarios, such that any reasonable outcome will fall within it...|$|E
