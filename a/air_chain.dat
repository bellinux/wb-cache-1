40|$|Purpose: This paper aims to {{evaluate}} and optimize the various operations within the <b>air</b> cargo <b>chain.</b> It pursues to improve {{the efficiency of the}} <b>air</b> cargo supply <b>chain</b> and to provide more information to the decision-makers to optimize their fields. Design/methodology/approach: The method used is a process simulation modelling software, WITNESS, which provides information to the decision-makers about the most relevant parameters subject to optimization. The input for the simulation is obtained from a qualitative analysis of the <b>air</b> cargo supply <b>chain</b> with the involved agents and from a study of the external trade by air mode, given that their behaviour depend on the location. The case study is focused on a particular location, the Case of Zaragoza Airport (Spain). Findings: This paper demonstrates that efficiency of the <b>air</b> cargo supply <b>chain</b> can increase by leveraging several parameters such as bottlenecks, resources or warehouses. Originality/value: It explores the use of a simulation modeling software originally intended for manufacturing processes and extended to support decision making processes in the area of air cargo. </p...|$|R
40|$|Due to {{the complex}} nature of air {{material}} demand and supply process, inventory pooling {{among a number of}} airlines is an intuitive way of exploiting the scale economies of availability services, and this paper analyzes the <b>air</b> material supply <b>chain</b> within sharing model and introduces revenue-sharing contract coordination mechanism into air material supply process. On the basis of analyzing stock-out compensation and inventory costs, it establishes the coordination model of <b>air</b> material supply <b>chain</b> whose demand quantity is in accordance with Poisson Distribution and Normal Distribution. The paper presents the collaborative decision-making algorithm for <b>air</b> material supply <b>chain</b> and verifies the coordination model by means of actually analyzing a numerical example for application. Based on a reasonable contract form and contract parameters, the optimization of production and ordering quantity and expected profit of each node on the <b>air</b> material supply <b>chain</b> can be achieved and hence the optimization of collaborative decision-making of air material supply and the performance of supply chain...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{introduces}} an <b>air</b> cargo supply <b>chain</b> operations reference (ACSCOR) {{model to}} examine the integrated impact of airport operating strategies and industrial forces on airport performances, and quantifies the economic benefits of the air cargo service business. In the light of Singapore and Hong Kong statistics, it is shown that the cargo traffic at an airport is significantly influenced by its operating characteristics, the performances of its downstream airfreight and supporting logistics industry, and the economic environment that it is functioning within. Through the traditional economic models, {{it is found that}} on average Hong Kong experiences a higher accelerator effect but lower multiplier effect in airport investment compared to Singapore. While the multiplier effect may signify that Singapore can benefit from higher returns in terms of the spillover effect to the overall <b>air</b> cargo supply <b>chain,</b> the higher accelerator effect in Hong Kong corresponds to the empirical results from the ACSCOR model that advocate Chek Lap Kok airport increasing its physical inputs relative to human inputs. <b>Air</b> cargo supply <b>chain</b> operations reference (ACSCOR) model Performance linkages Economic contributions Accelerator effect Multiplier effect...|$|R

40|$|This study aims {{to analyze}} the effects (e. g. changes of power and processes) of the e-freight {{initiative}} introduced by IATA on the <b>air</b> freight supply <b>chain</b> network by focusing on two specific cases within the U. S. and Chinese market. After identifying two representative cases (cross sectional), data was gathered using semi- structured interviews, additional data provided by the participants, as well as secondary data, such as annual reports and case studies. The findings are analyzed using key words and suitable categories. A power model based on the current situation of the <b>air</b> freight supply <b>chain</b> is developed by analyzing the circumstances while implementing e-AWB/e-freight. This model {{can be used to}} add to the existing gap within the present literature framework. Further, changes regarding the supply chain network, especially processes and information flow were identified. Lastly, mainly positive (e. g. increased sustainability of the transportation process) as well as some negative effects (e. g. investments of the dual process) are mentioned in a de- tailed manner. Limitations of the study include a research population of two major actors of the <b>air</b> freight supply <b>chain</b> network, as well as a theoretical framework primarily based on literature {{and the fact that the}} study focuses on a cross sectional time period. Future research would include an analysis of all involved actors, while including IATA as the trade association, of the <b>air</b> freight supply <b>chain,</b> and especially issues related to customs procedures. Also, a longitudinal study, a more in depth analysis of the power distribution and any related changes should be of interest. ...|$|R
