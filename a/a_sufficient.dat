5|$|A {{standard}} analogy for compactification is {{to consider}} a multidimensional object such as a garden hose. If the hose is viewed from <b>a</b> <b>sufficient</b> distance, {{it appears to have}} only one dimension, its length, but as one approaches the hose, one discovers that it contains a second dimension, its circumference. Thus, an ant crawling inside it would move in two dimensions.|$|E

5|$|A {{symmetric}} multiprocessor (SMP) is {{a computer}} system with multiple identical processors that share memory and connect via a bus. Bus contention prevents bus architectures from scaling. As a result, SMPs generally do not comprise more than 32processors. Because of {{the small size of}} the processors and the significant reduction in the requirements for bus bandwidth achieved by large caches, such symmetric multiprocessors are extremely cost-effective, provided that <b>a</b> <b>sufficient</b> amount of memory bandwidth exists.|$|E
5|$|After the Great Depression, the {{building}} housed {{a succession of}} tenants, including barber shops and cafés. The building changed hands many times and was scheduled for demolition on several occasions, but escaped this fate apparently because <b>a</b> <b>sufficient</b> number of local residents came to its defense. It was eventually deeded {{to the city of}} Wichita Falls. As {{the building}} continued to deteriorate, in 1986 the city gave the building to the Wichita County Heritage Society (WCHS), with the hope that it would eventually be restored, making it a viable part of the Depot Square Historic District.|$|E
5|$|Americans with origins {{from the}} Pacific are the {{smallest}} minority in Texas. According to the survey, only 18,000 Texans are Pacific Islanders; 16,400 are of non-Hispanic descent. There are roughly 5,400 Native Hawaiians, 5,300 Guamanians, and 6,400 {{people from other}} groups. Samoan Americans were scant; only 2,920 people were from this group. The city of Euless, a suburb of Fort Worth, contains a sizable population of Tongan Americans, at nearly 900 people, over {{one percent of the}} city's population. Killeen has <b>a</b> <b>sufficient</b> population of Samoans and Guamanian, and people of Pacific Islander descent surpass one percent of the city's population.|$|E

5|$|Among {{the extreme}} trans-Neptunian objects are two high {{perihelion}} objects: Sedna and 2012 VP113. Sedna and 2012 VP113 are distant detached objects with perihelia greater than 70 AU. Their high perihelia keep them at <b>a</b> <b>sufficient</b> distance to avoid significant gravitational perturbations from Neptune. Previous {{explanations for the}} high perihelion of Sedna include a close encounter with an unknown planet on a distant orbit and a distant encounter with a random star {{or a member of}} the Sun's birth cluster that passed near the Solar System.|$|E
5|$|As the stallions of the Poitevin breed {{could not}} be used to produce mules, they were {{generally}} sold as two-year-olds at the summer fair in Vendée and the winter fair in Saint-Maixent, as well as to horse merchants in Berry, Beauce, Perche and the Midi. In these areas, they were used for agriculture. In Paris, they were used for pulling omnibuses, and the French military used the Poitevin for pulling artillery. At the beginning of the 21st century there has been a new demand for mules for leisure purposes, but this demand cannot be filled by Poitevin mares until their numbers have recovered to <b>a</b> <b>sufficient</b> level.|$|E
5|$|Bohr {{was aware}} of the {{possibility}} of using uranium-235 to construct an atomic bomb, referring to it in lectures in Britain and Denmark shortly before and after the war started, but he did not believe that it was technically feasible to extract <b>a</b> <b>sufficient</b> quantity of uranium-235. In September 1941, Heisenberg, who had become head of the German nuclear energy project, visited Bohr in Copenhagen. During this meeting the two men took a private moment outside, the content of which has caused much speculation, as both gave differing accounts.|$|E

5|$|Following the sinking, a Board of Inquiry was {{established}} to investigate the loss. Based on its findings, Captain Loben Maund was court-martialled in February 1942 for negligence. He was found guilty on two counts of negligence: one of failing to ensure that properly constituted damage control parties had remained on board after the general evacuation, and one of failing to ensure the ship was in <b>a</b> <b>sufficient</b> state of readiness to deal with possible damage. The board tempered their judgement with an acknowledgement that a high standard was being expected of Maund, {{and that he was}} primarily concerned with the welfare of his crew.|$|E
5|$|Harrison {{had many}} {{friends in the}} eastern aristocracy, and quickly gained a {{reputation}} among them as a frontier leader. He ran a successful horse-breeding enterprise that won him acclaim throughout the Northwest Territory. Harrison became a champion of lower land prices, a primary concern of settlers in the Territory at the time. The U.S. Congress had legislated a territorial land policy that led to high land costs, which many of the territory's residents disliked. In October 1799, after it had been determined that the Northwest Territory's population had reached <b>a</b> <b>sufficient</b> number to have a delegate in the U.S. Congress, Harrison ran for election. He campaigned to encourage further migration to the territory, which eventually led to statehood.|$|E
