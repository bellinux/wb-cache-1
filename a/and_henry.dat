5|$|Robert {{issued an}} appeal {{for help to}} his barons, <b>and</b> <b>Henry</b> {{was the first to}} arrive in Rouen in November. Violence broke out, leading to savage, {{confused}} street fighting as both sides attempted {{to take control of the}} city. Robert <b>and</b> <b>Henry</b> left the castle to join the battle, but Robert then retreated, leaving Henry to continue the fighting. The battle turned in favour of the ducal forces <b>and</b> <b>Henry</b> took Conan prisoner. Henry was angry that Conan had turned against his feudal lord. He had him taken to the top of Rouen Castle and then, despite Conan's offers to pay a huge ransom, threw him off the top of the castle to his death. Contemporaries considered Henry to have acted appropriately in making an example of Conan, <b>and</b> <b>Henry</b> became famous for his exploits in the battle.|$|E

5|$|During this period, Anne Boleyn {{played an}} {{important}} role in England's international position by solidifying an alliance with France. She established an excellent rapport with the French ambassador, Gilles de la Pommeraie. Anne <b>and</b> <b>Henry</b> attended a meeting with the French king at Calais in winter 1532, in which Henry hoped to enlist the support of Francis I of France for his intended marriage. On 1 September 1532, Henry granted her suo jure the Marquessate of Pembroke, an appropriate peerage for a future queen; as such she became a rich and important woman: the three dukes and two marquesses who existed in 1532 were the King's brother-in-law, the King's illegitimate son, and other descendants of royalty; she ranked above all other peeresses. The Pembroke lands and the title of Earl of Pembroke had been held by Henry's great-uncle, <b>and</b> <b>Henry</b> performed the investiture himself.|$|E
