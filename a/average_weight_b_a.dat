40|$|Objective: To compare parental {{report of}} child body image with {{perceived}} healthy weight body image in preschoolers and describe weight-counseling preferences. Methods: Parents seeking well-child care were interviewed {{and asked to}} select images resembling: (a) their own child’s current <b>weight,</b> (<b>b)</b> <b>a</b> healthy <b>weight</b> preschooler, and (c) friend and family report of a healthy weight preschooler. Those indicating that their overweight or obese child resembled a healthy weight image were considered to misclassify child weight. Logistic regression was used to identify predictors of misclassification and card-sorting exercises explored weight-counseling preferences. Results: Of the 150 preschoolers in our sample, 32. 7 % (n = 49) were overweight or obese with misclassification occurring in 71. 4 % of parents (n = 35). Absence of pediatrician comment on child weight strongly predicted misclassification (odds ratio, 12. 3; 95 % confidence interval, 1. 74 - 87. 2). Pediatricians were highly valued weight advisors.

40|$|In {{order to}} achieve good {{performance}} in object classification problems, {{it is necessary to}} combine information from various image features. Because the large margin classifiers are constructed based on similarity measures between samples called kernels, finding appropriate feature combinations boils down to designing good kernels among a set of candidates, for example, positive mixtures of predetermined base kernels. There are a couple of ways to determine the mixing weights of multiple kernels: (<b>a)</b> uniform <b>weights,</b> (<b>b)</b> <b>a</b> brute force search over a validation set and (c) multiple kernel learning (MKL). MKL is theoretically and technically very attractive, because it learns the kernel weights and the classifier simultaneously based on the margin criterion. However, we often observe that the support vector machine (SVM) with the average kernel works at least as good as MKL. In this paper, we propose as an alternative, a two-step approach: at first, the kernel weights are d etermined by optimizing the kernel-target alignment score and then the combined kernel is used by the standard SVM with a single kernel. The experimental results with the VOC 2008 data set [8] show that our simple procedure outperforms the average kernel and MKL...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The {{objective}} {{of this research was}} to identify MspI polymorphism in the forth intron of chicken growth hormone (cGH) gene and their associations with growth traits in native Indonesian chickens. A total of 72 Indonesia native chickens were genotyped for a locus in the forth intron of cGH gene (cGH-I 4 /MspI locus) by PCR-RFLP with MspI restriction enzyme. The result showed two genotypes in this locus: AA and BB, with the frequency of 90. 28 % and 9. 72 %, respectively. Based on body <b>weight</b> <b>average,</b> <b>B</b> allele had <b>a</b> beneficial effect in increasing the live body weight. The result of General Linier Models analysis indicated that the polymorphism of this locus had significant association (P< 0. 05) with body weight at 4 months of age and so did the daily gain between 2 to 4 months of age. Therefore, these results suggest that there is a possibility of cGH-I 4 /MspI locus acting as a genetic marker for growth traits of native Indonesian chickens, especially for body weight at 4 months and daily gain between 2 to 4 months of age...|$|R
