5|$|Article Seven of the {{proposed}} Constitution set the terms by which the new frame of government would be established. The new Constitution would become operational when ratified by at least nine states. Only then would it replace the existing government under the Articles of Confederation and would <b>apply</b> <b>only</b> <b>to</b> those states that ratified it.|$|E

Commerce {{which does not}} involve the crossing of state lines is considered intrastate, and is {{under the jurisdiction of}} the respective state's laws. However, most states have adopted intrastate regulations which are identical or very similar to the federal HOS regulations.|$|E

5|$|An ideal {{surface is}} flat, rigid, {{perfectly}} smooth, and chemically homogeneous, and has zero contact angle hysteresis. Zero hysteresis implies the advancing and receding contact angles are equal. In other words, only one thermodynamically stable contact angle exists. When {{a drop of}} liquid is placed on such a surface, the characteristic contact angle is formed as depicted in Fig. 1. Furthermore, on an ideal surface, the drop will return to its original shape if it is disturbed. The following derivations <b>apply</b> <b>only</b> <b>to</b> ideal solid surfaces; they are only valid for the state in which the interfaces are not moving and the phase boundary line exists in equilibrium.|$|E
5|$|Fluorine is not {{essential}} for humans or other mammals; small amounts may be beneficial for bone strength, but {{this has not been}} definitively established. As there are many environmental sources of trace fluorine, the possibility of a fluorine deficiency could <b>apply</b> <b>only</b> <b>to</b> artificial diets. Natural organofluorines have been found in microorganisms and plants but not animals. The most common is fluoroacetate, which is used as a defense against herbivores by at least 40 plants in Africa, Australia and Brazil. Other examples include terminally fluorinated fatty acids, fluoroacetone, and 2-fluorocitrate. An enzyme that binds fluorine to carbon – adenosyl-fluoride synthase – was discovered in bacteria in 2002.|$|E
5|$|In March 1848, Garrison, the Motts, Abby Kelley Foster, Stephen Symonds Foster {{and others}} hosted an Anti-Sabbath meeting in Boston, {{to work toward}} the {{elimination}} of laws that <b>apply</b> <b>only</b> <b>to</b> Sunday, and to gain for the laborer more time away from toil than just one day of rest per week. Lucretia Mott and two other women were active within the executive committee, and Mott spoke to the assemblage. Lucretia Mott {{raised questions about the}} validity of blindly following religious and social tradition.|$|E

5|$|In his {{newspaper}} Berliner Arbeiterzeitung (Berlin Workers Newspaper), Gregor Strasser was {{highly critical of}} Goebbels' failure to attract the urban vote. However, the party as a whole did much better in rural areas, attracting as much as 18 per cent {{of the vote in}} some regions. This was partly because Hitler had publicly stated just prior to the election that Point 17 of the party programme, which mandated the expropriation of land without compensation, would <b>apply</b> <b>only</b> <b>to</b> Jewish speculators and not private landholders. After the election, the party refocused their efforts to try to attract still more votes in the agricultural sector. In May, shortly after the election, Hitler considered appointing Goebbels as party propaganda chief. But he hesitated, as he worried that the removal of Gregor Strasser from the post would lead to a split in the party. Goebbels considered himself well suited to the position, and began to formulate ideas about how propaganda could be used in schools and the media.|$|E
