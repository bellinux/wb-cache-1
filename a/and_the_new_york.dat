5|$|Subway Series {{is a term}} {{applied to}} any series of {{baseball}} games between New York City teams, as opposing teams can travel to compete merely by using the subway system.

Today, the term is {{used to describe the}} rivalry between the Yankees <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>New</b> <b>York</b> Mets.

The term could also be applied to the rivalry between the New York Knicks and the Brooklyn Nets of the National Basketball Association, or the New York Rangers <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>New</b> <b>York</b> Islanders of the National Hockey League ever since the Nets and the Islanders moved to the Barclays Center in Brooklyn.|$|E

5|$|In September 2005, an Israeli-declared AIDS expert {{claimed that}} Arafat bore all the {{symptoms}} of AIDS based on obtained medical records.

Arafat's personal doctor Ashraf al-Kurdi and aide Bassam Abu Sharif maintained that Arafat was poisoned, possibly by thallium. A senior Israeli physician concluded that Arafat died from food poisoning. Both those claims were rejected by Haaretz <b>and</b> <b>The</b> <b>New</b> <b>York</b> Times.
