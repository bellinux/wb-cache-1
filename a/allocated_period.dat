40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to explore the {{experiences}} of educators of training in the Curriculum Assessment Policy Statement. South Africa has undergone different curriculum changes in order to improve the standard of the education system. These changes have given educators moments of anxiety, fear and confusion. The literature review revealed that, in any curriculum change, educators as implementers of curriculum should undergo CPD so that they can be informed about changes in the education system. By being informed, educators will also refresh and increase their subject knowledge. The study employed a qualitative approach in which 12 educators were interviewed and were observed while presenting lessons in their classrooms. All 12 educators participated in semi-structured interviews. The study was conducted in Shiluvane circuit in the Mopani district in Limpopo province. The findings of the study suggest that there should be proper planning when a new curriculum is introduced. The educators felt that the time allocated for CAPS training was too short, as they could not learn everything they were supposed to learn in the <b>allocated</b> <b>period.</b> The findings also show that the CAPS presenters had little knowledge of what CAPS entails, although different useful materials were brought to the CAPS training sessions and given to the educators. There is a need for CPD of educators; and educators, like learners, need more time to adapt and adjust to changes. Sufficient monitoring and support should be provided for educators when a new curriculum is implemented. Dissertation (MEd) [...] University of Pretoria, 2016.

40|$|OBJECTIVE [...] To {{compare the}} {{outcomes}} {{in women with}} mild and moderate dyskaryosis after increasing periods of surveillance and thereby to define a rational protocol for managing such women. DESIGN [...] Prospective study with randomisation of women to one of four treatment groups, each with a different period of surveillance; one group in which the women were given immediate treatment and three other groups in which the women were under surveillance for six, 12, and 24 months. SETTING [...] A dedicated colposcopy clinic in Aberdeen, Scotland. SUBJECTS [...] 902 women who presented with a mildly or moderately dyskaryotic smear for the first time. INTERVENTIONS [...] Cytological and colposcopic examinations at intervals of six months until the <b>allocated</b> <b>period</b> of surveillance was completed, at which time biopsy was performed. Women with severe dyskaryosis were withdrawn from surveillance and a biopsy was performed. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES [...] The histological findings after punch biopsy or large loop excision of the transformation zone, and the trends in cytological appearances of serial cervical smears. RESULTS [...] 793 women completed the study. In all, 769 women had an adequate final smear, of which 197 were normal cytologically, 328 were still mildly or moderately dyskaryotic, and 244 were severely dyskaryotic. Seventeen of the 67 (25 %) women with one repeat smear showing non-dyskaryosis had cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade III compared with {{only one of the}} 31 (3 %) women with no dyskaryosis in four repeat cervical smears (P < 0. 0001). None of the women had invasive cancer. Of 158 women whose index smear showed mild dyskaryosis and who were allocated to the group under surveillance for two years, only 40 had not defaulted or still had dyskaryotic smears {{by the end of the}} two years. CONCLUSION [...] Cytological surveillance, although safe, is not an efficient strategy for managing women with mildly abnormal smears. Women with any degree of dyskaryosis in a smear should be referred for colposcopy...|$|E

25|$|In Greece, a water {{clock was}} known as a clepsydra (water thief). The Greeks {{considerably}} advanced the water clock by tackling the problem of the diminishing flow. They introduced several types of the inflow clepsydra, one of which included the earliest feedback control system. Ctesibius invented an indicator system typical for later clocks such as the dial and pointer. The Roman engineer Vitruvius described early alarm clocks, working with gongs or trumpets. A commonly used water clock was the simple outflow clepsydra. This small earthenware vessel had a hole in its side near the base. In both Greek and Roman times, this type of clepsydra was used in courts for <b>allocating</b> <b>periods</b> of time to speakers. In important cases, when a person's life was at stake for example, it was filled. But, for more minor cases, it was only partially filled. If proceedings were interrupted for any reason, such as to examine documents, the hole in the clepsydra was stopped with wax until the speaker was able to resume his pleading.|$|R

40|$|This {{full text}} paper was peer {{reviewed}} {{at the direction}} of IEEE Communications Society subject matter experts for publication in the IEEE ICC 2011 proceedingsNowadays wireless sensor networks (WSNs) have attracted a great deal of study due to their low cost and widerange applications. Most of the sensors used so far are point sensors which have a disc-shaped sensing region. In this paper, we study a new type of sensor: the fiber optic cable sensor. Unlike a traditional point sensor, this type of sensor has a rectangular sensing region with a processor installed on it to do processing and communication. Like wireless sensor networks with point sensors, energy-efficient communication is still an important issue in wireless sensor networks with cable sensors because of the need to efficiently use limited resources. To address the issue, we propose a Cable Mode Transition (CMT) algorithm, which determines the minimal number of active sensors to maintain Kcoverage of a terrain as well as K-connectivity of the network. Specifically, it <b>allocates</b> <b>periods</b> of inactivity for cable sensors without affecting the coverage and connectivity requirements of the network based only on local information. Before presenting CMT, we first show the relationship between coverage and connectivity, then the eligibility algorithm permitting a cable sensor to decide whether to stay active. CMT calls the eligibility algorithm to schedule cables. Simulation results show that our scheme is efficient in saving energy and thus can prolong the lifetime of wireless cable sensor networks. supported by NSF grant CBET 072969...|$|R
