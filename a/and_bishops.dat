5|$|From the 3rd century, {{the school}} tolerated Christian teachings, {{producing}} {{a number of}} students who would become influential church leaders <b>and</b> <b>bishops,</b> such as Pamphilus of Caesarea, Severus of Antioch and Aphian.

Chess960 uses a random initial set-up of main pieces, with {{the conditions that}} the king is placed somewhere between the two rooks, <b>and</b> <b>bishops</b> on opposite-color squares. The castling rules are extended to cover all these positions.|$|E
5|$|The lower clergy <b>and</b> <b>bishops</b> {{resisted}} Richard's {{attempt to}} impose the 1198 carucage on their estates. In response, Richard withdrew their access to his royal courts forcing them to buy it back for a sum greater than the carucage would have collected.|$|E
5|$|After the Roman Empire {{collapsed}} and the aqueduct fell into disuse, the Pont du Gard remained largely intact, {{due to the}} importance of its secondary function, as a toll bridge. For centuries the local lords <b>and</b> <b>bishops</b> were responsible for its upkeep, in exchange for the right to levy tolls on travellers using it to cross the river, although some of its stones were looted and serious damage was inflicted on it in the 17th century. It attracted increasing attention starting in the 18th century, and became an important tourist destination.|$|E

5|$|By {{the end of}} February, Bothwell was {{generally}} believed to be guilty of Darnley's assassination. Lennox, Darnley's father, demanded that Bothwell be tried before the Estates of Parliament, to which Mary agreed, but Lennox's request for a delay to gather evidence was denied. In the absence of Lennox, and with no evidence presented, Bothwell was acquitted after a seven-hour trial on 12 April. A week later, Bothwell managed to convince {{more than two dozen}} lords <b>and</b> <b>bishops</b> to sign the Ainslie Tavern Bond, in which they agreed to support his aim to marry the queen.|$|E
5|$|In the Holy Roman and Byzantine empires, {{imperial}} purple was a colour {{reserved for}} emperors, kings <b>and</b> <b>bishops,</b> and purple parchment was rarely used for writing.

In 2005, the document was proposed for inclusion in the Memory of the World Register, but was not included.|$|E
5|$|Magnus' {{rule was}} {{generally}} marked by Norway's increasing similarity to other European kingdoms. Royal rule became established, and he consolidated power through {{a network of}} powerful noblemen (some of whom were relatives); church organisation also developed. The Nordic bishops belonged to the Archdiocese of Hamburg-Bremen until a year after Magnus' death (when the Archdiocese of Lund was formed); priests <b>and</b> <b>bishops</b> were largely foreigners from England and Germany. In reality, however, Magnus ruled the church in Norway.|$|E

Three seats were added later: an additional Roman Catholic representative, one for the Lemberg Polytechnical University, {{and one for the}} Kraków Academy of Learning.|$|E
5|$|Ralph was {{not chosen}} {{archbishop}} of Canterbury by the chapter of Canterbury alone. His election involved an {{assembly of the}} lords <b>and</b> <b>bishops</b> meeting with King Henry I of England. Ralph then received his pallium from Pope Paschal II, rather than travelling to Rome to retrieve it. As archbishop, Ralph was very assertive {{of the rights of}} the see of Canterbury and of the liberties of the English church. He claimed authority in Wales and Scotland. Ralph also quarrelled for a time with Pope Paschal II.|$|E
5|$|The vacancy {{may also}} have {{occurred}} because Wilfrid, who {{was at that point}} having problems in Northumbria, desired to become Archbishop of Canterbury. A contemporary biographer of Wilfrid, Stephen of Ripon, says that Theodore had wished for Wilfrid to succeed Theodore at Canterbury. Æthelred of Mercia may have supported Wilfrid's translation to Canterbury also, but despite these desires, the translation did not happen. Berhtwald was consecrated on 29 June 693, having travelled to France for his consecration as archbishop of Canterbury by Godwin, Archbishop of Lyon. Berhtwald went to the continent for consecration probably because he feared that his election was not supported by all of the kings <b>and</b> <b>bishops.</b> After his consecration, Berhtwald travelled to Rome to obtain the support of Pope Sergius I, who wrote to a number of Anglo-Saxon kings <b>and</b> <b>bishops</b> in support of the archbishop. Two of these letters survive, and their authenticity has been doubted, mainly because they are only preserved as part of the post-Norman Conquest Canterbury-York dispute. Historians have since come to regard the two letters as genuine. Sergius also gave Berhtwald a pallium, the symbol of an archbishop's authority.|$|E

5|$|Unlike in Western Europe where priests {{were clearly}} demarcated from the laymen, the clergy of the Eastern Roman Empire {{remained}} {{in close contact}} with the rest of society. Readers and subdeacons were drawn from the laity and expected to be at least twenty years of age while priests <b>and</b> <b>bishops</b> had to be at least 30. Unlike the Latin church, the Byzantine church allowed married priests and deacons, {{as long as they were}} married before ordination. Bishops, however, were required to be unmarried.|$|E
5|$|Allowing the enpassant capture, {{together}} {{with the introduction of}} the two-square first move for pawns, {{was one of the last}} major rule changes in European chess, and occurred between 1200 and 1600. Other relatively recent rule changes were castling, the unlimited range for queens <b>and</b> <b>bishops</b> (Spanish master Ruy López de Segura gives the rule in his 1561 book Libro de la invencion liberal y arte del juego del axedrez) and a change to the rules on pawn promotion. In most places the en passant rule was adopted at the same time as allowing the pawn to move two squares on its first move, but it was not universally accepted until the Italian rules were changed in 1880.|$|E
5|$|Based {{on recent}} DNA-analysis, the genus Ploceus is almost {{certainly}} polyphyletic. If all species currently included in the genus would remain and the genus would be made monophyletic, {{it would have to}} encompass the entire subfamily Ploceinae. The Ploceinae can be divided into two groups. In the first group, the widowbirds <b>and</b> <b>bishops</b> (genus Euplectes) are sister to a clade in which the genera Foudia and Quelea are closest relatives and which further includes the Asiatic species of Ploceus, i.e. P. manyar, P. philippinus, P. benghalensis, P. megarhynchus, (and P. hypoxanthus, although untested). Since Georges Cuvier picked P. philippinus as the type species, these five species would logically remain assigned to the genus Ploceus.|$|E

5|$|Henry's wealth {{allowed him}} to {{maintain}} what was probably the largest curia regis, or royal court, in Europe. His court attracted huge attention from contemporary chroniclers, and typically comprised {{a number of major}} nobles <b>and</b> <b>bishops,</b> along with knights, domestic servants, prostitutes, clerks, horses and hunting dogs. Within the court were his officials, ministeriales, his friends, amici, and the familiares regis, the king's informal inner circle of confidants and trusted servants. Henry's familiares were particularly important to the operation of his household and government, driving government initiatives and filling the gaps between the official structures and the king.|$|E
5|$|In November 1167 Foliot {{was summoned}} to Normandy, then ruled by Henry II, to meet with papal legates and the king. Roger of York, Hilary of Chichester, and Roger of Worcester were also summoned to attend. After some {{discussion}} and argument, Henry appears to have agreed that the legates could judge both the king's case against Becket {{as well as the}} bishops' case. Henry also offered a compromise {{on the subject of the}} Constitutions of Clarendon, that the legates accepted. However, when the legates met with Becket on 18November, it quickly became apparent that Becket would not accept negotiations with the king nor accept the legates as judges of either case against him. As the legates had no mandate to compel Becket to accept them as judges, the negotiations came to an end with the king <b>and</b> <b>bishops</b> still appealing to the papacy.|$|E
5|$|In {{the event}} Scotland regained its {{independent}} system of law, its parliament and its kirk, {{but also the}} Lords of the Articles (through which the crown controlled parliamentary business) <b>and</b> <b>bishops.</b> It also had a king who did not visit the country and ruled largely without reference to Parliament {{through a series of}} commissioners. These began with Middleton, now an earl, and ended with the king's brother and heir, James, Duke of York (known in Scotland as the Duke of Albany). Legislation was revoked back to 1633, by the Rescissory Act 1661, removing the Covenanter gains of the Bishops' Wars, but the discipline of kirk sessions, presbyteries and synods were renewed. Only four Covenanters were excluded from the general pardon and were executed, the most prominent being the Marquis of Argyll, but also including the Protester James Guthrie.|$|E
