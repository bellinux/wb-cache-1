25|$|<b>A</b> <b>new</b> <b>trend</b> in the United States for Hispanics is to hyphenate their father's and mother's last names.

In doing so they would, for example, mistakenly refer to Esteban Álvarez Cobos as Esteban A. Cobos. Such confusion can be particularly troublesome in official matters. To avoid such mistakes, Esteban Álvarez Cobos, would become Esteban Álvarez-Cobos, to clarify that both are last names.|$|E

25|$|<b>A</b> <b>new</b> <b>trend</b> in {{the heated}} {{controversy}} between First Nations groups and scientists is the repatriation of native artifacts {{to the original}} descendants. An example of this occurred June 21, 2005, when community members and elders {{from a number of}} the 10 Algonquian nations in the Ottawa area convened on the Kitigan Zibi reservation near Maniwaki, Quebec, to inter ancestral human remains and burial goods — some dating back 6,000 years. It was not determined, however, if the remains were directly related to the Algonquin people who now inhabit the region.

Convergence devices for home entertainment will likely play a much larger role {{in the future of}} broadcast television, effectively shifting traditional revenue streams while providing consumers with more options.|$|E
