5|$|The {{governing}} <b>African</b> <b>National</b> <b>Congress</b> (ANC), {{supported by}} its Tripartite Alliance with the Congress of South African Trade Unions (COSATU) and the South African Communist Party (SACP), have held {{a majority of}} the seats in the National Assembly since 1994. They were re-elected with increasing majorities in 1999 and 2004, and with a slight fall in its majority from 69% to 65.9% in 2009. The ANC is led by Jacob Zuma. In 2012, Zuma was re-elected to a second five-year term as President of the <b>African</b> <b>National</b> <b>Congress,</b> beating his only rival and deputy, Kgalema Motlanthe, by a wide margin. Cyril Ramaphosa was elected as Deputy President of the ANC, succeeding Motlanthe who had declined a second term after losing to Zuma.|$|E
5|$|The National Assembly {{election}} was {{won by the}} <b>African</b> <b>National</b> <b>Congress</b> (ANC), but with a reduced majority of 62.1%, down from 65.9% in the 2009 election. The official opposition Democratic Alliance (DA) increased {{its share of the}} vote from 16.7% to 22.2%, while the newly formed Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) obtained 6.4% of the vote.|$|E
50|$|The {{order is}} named after the late Oliver Tambo, who was the <b>African</b> <b>National</b> <b>Congress's</b> president-in-exile for many years.|$|R
50|$|Waters {{has been}} a vocal critic of the <b>African</b> <b>National</b> <b>Congress's</b> health policies, {{particularly}} those of controversial former health minister Manto Tshabalala-Msimang.|$|R
50|$|Indians {{also contributed}} to the <b>African</b> <b>National</b> <b>Congress's</b> {{struggle}} against the Apartheid regime. The Indian government was an outspoken critic of the apartheid-era South African government, refusing to maintain diplomatic relations. India's support evoked goodwill in South Africa and other African countries.|$|R
5|$|Following growing {{pressure}} from the anti-apartheid movement both domestically and internationally, in 1990 State President Frederik Willem de Klerk reversed the ban on the <b>African</b> <b>National</b> <b>Congress</b> and other anti-apartheid organisations, and announced that Mandela would shortly be released from prison. Mandela was released in February 1990. He persuaded Makeba to return to South Africa, which she did, using her French passport, on 10 June 1990.|$|E
5|$|Biko {{endorsed}} {{the unification of}} South Africa's black liberationist groups—among them the BCM, PAC, and <b>African</b> <b>National</b> <b>Congress</b> (ANC)—in order to concentrate their anti-apartheid efforts. To this end, {{he reached out to}} leading members of the ANC, PAC, and Unity Movement. His communications with the ANC were largely via Griffiths Mxenge, and plans were being made to smuggle him out of the country to meet Oliver Tambo, a leading ANC figure. Biko's negotiations with the PAC were primarily through intermediaries who exchanged messages between him and Sobukwe; those with the Unity Movement were largely via Fikile Bam.|$|E
5|$|In September 1960, at the United Nations General Assembly in New York City, MalcolmX {{was invited}} to the {{official}} functions of several African nations. He met Gamal Abdel Nasser of Egypt, Ahmed Sékou Touré of Guinea, and Kenneth Kaunda of the Zambian <b>African</b> <b>National</b> <b>Congress.</b> Fidel Castro also attended the Assembly, and MalcolmX met publicly with him {{as part of a}} welcoming committee of Harlem community leaders. Castro was sufficiently impressed with MalcolmX to suggest a private meeting, and after two hours of talking, Castro invited MalcolmX to visit Cuba.|$|E
50|$|On 2 June 1980, Sasolburg was {{attacked}} by Umkhonto we Sizwe (MK), the <b>African</b> <b>National</b> <b>Congress's</b> (ANC) military wing. They bombed two strategically important SASOL (oil-from-coal) plants and an oil refinery. This event was depicted in the 2006 film Catch a Fire.|$|R
5000|$|Penguin Books {{obtained}} {{the rights to}} publish the initial volume in the Commonwealth in 1986. In support of the <b>African</b> <b>National</b> <b>Congress's</b> cultural boycott in opposition to apartheid, Spiegelman refused to [...] "compromise with fascism" [...] by allowing publication of his work in South Africa.|$|R
50|$|Malema, a Mopedi, {{was born}} {{and grew up in}} Seshego, Transvaal Province. His mother was a {{domestic}} worker and a single parent. He joined the <b>African</b> <b>National</b> <b>Congress's</b> Masupatsela at the age of nine or ten. His main task at the time, was to remove National Party posters.|$|R
5|$|Jack Abramoff {{wrote and}} co-produced the film Red Scorpion {{with his brother}} Robert in 1989. In the film, Dolph Lundgren plays Nikolai, a Soviet agent sent to assassinate an African revolutionary in a fictional country modeled on Angola. The South African {{government}} financed the film through the International Freedom Foundation, a front-group chaired by Abramoff, {{as part of its}} efforts to undermine international sympathy for the <b>African</b> <b>National</b> <b>Congress.</b> While working in Hollywood, Abramoff was convicted for fraud and other offenses that he had committed during his concurrent career as a lobbyist.|$|E
5|$|While Mugabe was {{teaching}} abroad, an anti-colonialist African nationalist movement {{was established in}} Southern Rhodesia. This was first led by Joshua Nkomo's Southern Rhodesia <b>African</b> <b>National</b> <b>Congress,</b> founded in September 1957 and then banned by the colonial government in February 1959. This {{was replaced by the}} more radically oriented National Democratic Party (NDP), founded in January 1960. In May 1960, Mugabe returned to Southern Rhodesia, bringing Hayfron with him. The pair had planned for their visit to be short, however Mugabe's friend, the African nationalist Leopold Takawira, urged them to stay.|$|E
5|$|Back {{home she}} resumes {{her job as}} a {{physiotherapist}} in Soweto. Then in June 1976 Soweto school children start protesting about their inferior education and being taught in Afrikaans. They go on a rampage, which includes killing white welfare workers. The police brutally put down the uprising, resulting in hundreds of deaths. In October 1977, many organisations and people critical of the white government are banned, and in November 1977 Rosa Burger is detained. Her lawyer, who also represented her father, expects charges to be brought against her of furthering the aims of the banned SACP and <b>African</b> <b>National</b> <b>Congress</b> (ANC), and of aiding and abetting the students' revolt.|$|E
5000|$|Toyi-toyi {{was often}} used for intimidating the South African police and {{security}} forces during anti-apartheid demonstrations. The toyi-toyi was also used with chants such as the <b>African</b> <b>National</b> <b>Congress's</b> [...] "Amandla" [...] ("power") and [...] "Awethu" [...] ("ours") or the Pan African Congress's [...] "One Settler, One Bullet".|$|R
25|$|On 20 September 2008, Thabo Mbeki {{announced}} his resignation after being recalled by the <b>African</b> <b>National</b> <b>Congress's</b> <b>National</b> Executive Committee. The recall came after South African High Court Judge Christopher Nicholson ruled that Mbeki had improperly {{interfered with the}} operations of the National Prosecuting Authority (NPA), including the prosecution of Jacob Zuma for corruption.|$|R
50|$|Gxowa {{was born}} in Germiston. She first started working as an office {{assistant}} in the South African Clothing Workers' Union. Gxowa {{became involved in the}} <b>African</b> <b>National</b> <b>Congress's</b> (ANC) Youth League and the Women's League at a young age. She first signed up with ANC during the anti-Bantu education campaign.|$|R
5|$|Following {{the end of}} {{apartheid}}, when apartheid legislation {{had been}} repealed, Springbok colours started to be issued to non-whites again. In 1994, following the election of Nelson Mandela and the <b>African</b> <b>National</b> <b>Congress,</b> the National Colours Board {{was set up to}} control the distribution of Springbok colours. Despite this, the majority of South Africa's sporting organisations stopped awarding Springbok colours following the replacement of the Springbok by the Protea following a government demand. The only sporting body in South Africa that was allowed to retain Springbok colours was the South African Rugby Union as an act of conciliation towards the white minority who made up the majority of the national rugby union team.|$|E
5|$|In 1992, {{eight years}} after their last {{official}} series, South Africa hosted New Zealand in a one-off test match. The resumption of international rugby in South Africa came after {{the dismantling of the}} apartheid system, and was only done with permission of the <b>African</b> <b>National</b> <b>Congress.</b> With their return to test rugby, South Africa were selected to host the 1995 Rugby World Cup. After upsetting Australia in the opening match, South Africa continued to advance through the tournament until they met New Zealand in the final. After a tense final that went into extra time, South Africa emerged 15–12 winners, with then President Nelson Mandela, wearing a Springbok jersey, presenting the trophy to South Africa's captain, Francois Pienaar.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 1950s, protest against South Africa's {{apartheid}} regime reached {{the stage of}} seeking to exclude the nation from international sport. In 1956, government rules requiring separate events for whites and non-whites in South Africa were issued; non-whites received poorer facilities. Brundage initially opposed taking any action. The run-up to the 1960 Rome Olympics had seen tumult in South Africa, including the Sharpeville massacre and a crackdown on the <b>African</b> <b>National</b> <b>Congress.</b> Activists attempted to persuade Brundage that South Africa should be excluded from the Games. Brundage initially took the word of South African sport leaders that all citizens were able to compete for {{a place on the}} Olympic team, and that non-white South Africans simply were not good enough.|$|E
50|$|Masizole Mnqasela (born 1 March 1981) is a South African politician, {{currently}} a Member of Parliament with the Democratic Alliance, and the Shadow Minister of Home Affairs from 2009 to 2014. He is the country's third youngest parliamentarian after the <b>African</b> <b>National</b> <b>Congress's</b> Mduduzi Manana, and Congress of the People's Luzelle Adams.|$|R
50|$|One Settler, One Bullet was a {{rallying}} cry and slogan originated by the Azanian People's Liberation Army (APLA), the armed wing of the Pan Africanist Congress (PAC), during the struggle of the 1980s against apartheid in South Africa. The slogan parodied the <b>African</b> <b>National</b> <b>Congress's</b> slogan 'One Man, One Vote', which eventually became 'One Person, One Vote'.|$|R
50|$|The main trial {{lasted until}} 1961, {{when all of}} the {{defendants}} were found not guilty. During the trials, Oliver Tambo left the country and was exiled. Whilst in other European and African countries he started an organisation which helped bring publicity to the <b>African</b> <b>National</b> <b>Congress's</b> cause in South Africa. Some of the defendants were later convicted in the Rivonia Trial in 1964.|$|R
5|$|Nigeria's {{foreign policy}} was {{tested in the}} 1970s after the country emerged united from its own civil war. It {{supported}} movements against white minority governments in the Southern Africa sub-region. Nigeria backed the <b>African</b> <b>National</b> <b>Congress</b> (ANC) by taking a committed tough line {{with regard to the}} South African government and their military actions in southern Africa. Nigeria was also {{a founding member of the}} Organisation for African Unity (now the African Union), and has tremendous influence in West Africa and Africa on the whole. Nigeria has additionally founded regional cooperative efforts in West Africa, functioning as standard-bearer for the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) and ECOMOG, economic and military organizations, respectively.|$|E
5|$|The main militant African {{nationalist}} {{parties in}} each territory were {{banned by the}} federal and territorial governments, but all reorganised under new names only months later. The Southern Rhodesian ANC became the National Democratic Party (later ZAPU), the Northern Rhodesian ANC became the Zambian <b>African</b> <b>National</b> <b>Congress,</b> and the Nyasaland ANC became the Malawi Congress Party. The media's {{use of the term}} 'police state' to describe the response to the violence outraged the Liberals, the Church of Scotland, and leftist Conservatives, and particularly the Labour Party, in Britain. John Stonehouse, a Labour MP, had been deported prior to the declaration of the state of emergency, adding to the tension. A Royal Commission was announced to investigate the violence. Welensky was indignant when asked to contribute to the Royal Commission, and the Labour Party boycotted it.|$|E
5|$|At the {{university}} Goldstone {{became involved in}} the international effort to end South Africa's apartheid system. He had been brought up in an anti-apartheid atmosphere; although his parents were not activists, they were opposed to racial discrimination and this was to have a profound influence on his later career. Like many other South African Jews, he chose to become conspicuously active in public life in an effort to oppose or alleviate the worst aspects of apartheid. While he was chairman of {{the university}}'s Students' Representative Council, he campaigned against the exclusion of black students. He also attracted attention from the state security police by having contact with anti-apartheid groups within South Africa, including the <b>African</b> <b>National</b> <b>Congress,</b> which was a banned organisation at the time. On one occasion he secretly tape-recorded a spy sent by the police to infiltrate the anti-apartheid student movement at the university. The recording was later used as evidence in the firing of the national police commissioner.|$|E
50|$|A noted {{dissenter}} {{from the}} predominant opinion of COSATU, he had publicly backed Thabo Mbeki {{for the presidency}} at the <b>African</b> <b>National</b> <b>Congress's</b> 2007 <b>national</b> conference in Polokwane while the trade union federation had adopted a resolution backing Jacob Zuma. He currently backs the Congress of the People (COPE) breakaway party being formed by Mosiuoa Lekota, the former defence minister in Mbeki's second government.|$|R
50|$|The SANDF {{took over}} the {{personnel}} and equipment from the SADF and integrated forces from the former Bantustan homelands forces, as well as personnel from the former guerrilla forces {{of some of the}} political parties involved in South Africa, such as the <b>African</b> <b>National</b> <b>Congress's</b> Umkhonto we Sizwe, the Pan Africanist Congress's Azanian People's Liberation Army and the Self-Protection Units of the Inkatha Freedom Party (IFP).|$|R
50|$|His {{political}} career {{began as a}} student activist and leader in the UDF-aligned SANSCO (South <b>African</b> <b>National</b> Student <b>Congress)</b> and its predecessor, AZASO (Azanian Students Organisation).|$|R
5|$|Freedom Square {{was located}} {{on the corner of}} Victoria and Morris Streets. It was famous in the 1950s for the {{political}} meetings held there. It was utilised by the <b>African</b> <b>National</b> <b>Congress</b> (ANC) and the Transvaal Congress Party. Many of the meetings were chaired by Trevor Huddleston. Freedom Square facilitated the cooperation between the aforementioned political parties. Here parties worked together against the apartheid regime. Freedom Square in Sophiatown {{should not be confused with}} Freedom Square in Kliptown, Soweto, where the Freedom Charter was adopted by the ANC in 1955. It was in this Freedom Square in Sophiatown that Nelson Mandela made his first public allusion to violence and armed resistance as a legitimate tool for change. This earned him a reprimand from Albert Luthuli who by then replaced Dr A.B. Xuma as president of the ANC. Current remnants of Freedom Square may be found beneath a school playing field alongside the Christ the King Church.|$|E
5|$|In the 19th century, {{the valley}} was {{dominated}} by the Kingdom of Lunda of Mwata Kazembe. The boundaries of the province between Zambia and DR Congo were disputed for many years, running from an 1894 treaty into the late 1960s. The province {{has a long history}} of opposing colonial rule through militancy. From the 1950s, there were revolutionary groups that supported the Anti Federationist <b>African</b> <b>National</b> <b>Congress.</b> Post independence, the province was the base for the United National Independence Party (UNIP) militants. Laupula has constant migration of labour from DR Congo and also from nearby Copperbelt Province. During the 1980s, the then President Kenneth Kaunda appointed traditional Chiefs of the region as District Governors or members of the powerful UNIP central committee. The practice was seen similar to colonial rule when local leaders were drafted to political domain. Mwata Kazambe was appointed the District Governor for the province by the President during the 1980s.|$|E
5|$|Nevertheless, {{many white}} Zimbabweans {{complained that they}} were {{suffering}} from racial discrimination. Many whites remained uneasy about living under the government of a black Marxist and they also feared that their children {{would be unable to}} secure jobs. There was a growing exodus to South Africa, and in 1980, 1700 whites—approximately a tenth of the white Zimbabwean population—emigrated. Mugabe's government had pledged support for the <b>African</b> <b>National</b> <b>Congress</b> and other anti-apartheid forces within South Africa, although did not allow them to use Zimbabwe as a base for their military operations. To protest apartheid and white minority rule in South Africa, Mugabe's government banned Zimbabwe from engaging South Africa in any sporting competitions. In turn, South Africa tried to destabilise Zimbabwe by blocking trade routes into the country and supporting anti-Mugabist militants among the country's white minority.|$|E
50|$|In 1996 the University Education Committee and the University Technikon Education Collaboration Committee merged {{and were}} tasked {{to pursue the}} {{establishment}} of a University in the Province by the former MEC for Education, Mr D D Mabuza. The National Institute for Higher Education (Mpumalanga), established in 2006, under the leadership of the late Prof C C Mokadi coordinated the provision of Higher Education in the province. An important milestone was the decision taken at the <b>African</b> <b>National</b> <b>Congress’s</b> <b>National</b> General Council meeting held in eThekwini (Durban) in 2010 which resolved to establish two new universities. This decision was instrumental in facilitating for {{the establishment of a}} university in the Mpumalanga Province.|$|R

50|$|Sexwale {{became a}} member of the Steve Biko's Black Consciousness Movement in the late 1960s and became a local leader of the radical South African Students' Movement. In the early 1970s, he joined the <b>African</b> <b>National</b> <b>Congress's</b> armed wing, Umkhonto we Sizwe ("spear of the nation"). While in Swaziland, he {{completed}} a Certificate in Business Studies at the University of Botswana, Lesotho and Swaziland. In 1975, Sexwale went into exile, undergoing military officers' training in the Soviet Union, where he specialized in military engineering.|$|R
