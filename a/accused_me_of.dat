25|$|It was as hard-hitting a {{memorandum}} as I could make it. Butler <b>accused</b> <b>me</b> <b>of</b> overstating {{the lack of}} resolve in both Washington and London. But my argument over {{the need to get}} a concealment-based inspection on track did resonate with him. He authorized me to put together an updated inspection plan to take place following his August visit to Baghdad.|$|E
500|$|Pope Pius IX's {{determination}} to keep Edgardo {{developed into a}} strong paternal attachment. According to Edgardo's memoirs, the pontiff regularly spent time with him and played with him; the Pope would amuse the child by hiding him under his cassock and calling out: [...] "Where's the boy?" [...] At one of their meetings, Pope Pius told Edgardo: [...] "My son, you have cost me dearly, and I have suffered a great deal because of you." [...] He then said to others present: [...] "Both the powerful and the powerless tried to steal this boy from me, and <b>accused</b> <b>me</b> <b>of</b> being barbarous and pitiless. They cried for his parents, but they failed to recognise that I, too, am his father." ...|$|E
500|$|So far, {{changes to}} the {{original}} had been of a minor nature, but when the opera reappeared in June 1869 it had been entirely restructured. Although the musical numbers were still linked by dialogue, the first act had been divided in two, to create a three-act opera. Various numbers, including the drinking song and the new polka, were repositioned, and the polka was now followed by a furiant. A [...] "March of the Comedians" [...] was added, to introduce the strolling players in what was now Act III. A short duet for Esmeralda and the Principal Comedian was dropped. In September 1870 The Bartered Bride reached its final form, when all the dialogue was replaced by recitative. Smetana's own opinion of the finished work, given much later, was largely dismissive: he described it as [...] "a toy ... composing it was mere child's play". It was written, he said [...] "to spite those who <b>accused</b> <b>me</b> <b>of</b> being Wagnerian and incapable of doing anything in a lighter vein." ...|$|E

2500|$|Sheen is staunchly {{opposed to}} vaccinations. After {{separating}} from Denise Richards {{he sent a}} legal notice to his daughters' physician stating his lack of consent to vaccinate them. The dispute over vaccines seems to have {{played an important role}} in the failure of the marriage. Richards said in an interview in 2008, [...] "When I vaccinated Sam, he <b>accused</b> <b>me</b> <b>of</b> poisoning her. And I knew when he said that that the marriage wasn't going to work." ...|$|E
2500|$|Some people <b>accused</b> <b>me</b> <b>of</b> being pro-Muslim in Bosnia, but I {{realised}} {{that our}} job is to give all sides an equal hearing, but in cases of genocide you can't just be neutral. You can't just say, [...] "Well, this little boy {{was shot in the head}} and killed in besieged Sarajevo and that guy over there did it, but maybe he was upset because he had an argument with his wife." [...] No, there is no equality there, and we had to tell the truth.|$|E
2500|$|Olbermann has {{addressed}} the assertions of liberal bias {{by stating that}} he would be equally critical of a Democratic president who had invited criticism by his actions: [...] "I mean, no one in 1998, no one <b>accused</b> <b>me</b> <b>of</b> being a liberal in 1998 because I was covering the Lewinsky scandal. And whatever I had to do about it, I tried to be fair and honest and as accurate and as informed as possible, and allow my viewer to be the same way. And nowadays it's the same thing. And {{now all of a sudden}} I’m a screaming liberal." ...|$|E

2500|$|Vang further {{testified that}} Joseph Crotteau {{deserved}} to die [...] "because he <b>accused</b> <b>me</b> <b>of</b> {{giving him the}} finger and tried to cut {{in front of me}} to stop me from leaving." [...] And Laski deserved to die because he had a gun, he said. Vang re-enacted his deeds while on the stand, using his hands and arms to imitate the motions of firing a rifle. Vang's lawyers commented that some of his abnormal remarks were due to the language barrier. Therefore, when Vang responded affirmatively to the question that Mr. Crotteau and Mr. Laski [...] "deserved to die," [...] his meaning implied that the men contributed to the circumstances that led to their deaths.|$|E
2500|$|On April 28, 1932, Bow {{signed a}} two-picture deal with Fox Film Corporation, for Call Her Savage (1932) and Hoop-La (1933). Both were successful; Variety favored the latter. The October 1934, Family Circle Film Guide rated {{the film as}} [...] "pretty good entertainment", and of Miss Bow said: [...] "This is the most {{acceptable}} bit of talkie acting Miss Bow has done." [...] However, they noted, [...] "Miss Bow is presented in her dancing duds as often as possible, and her dancing duds wouldn't weigh two pounds soaking wet." [...] Bow commented on her revealing costume in Hoop-La: [...] "Rex <b>accused</b> <b>me</b> <b>of</b> enjoying showing myself off. Then I got a little sore. He knew darn well I was doing it because we {{could use a little}} money these days. Who can't?" ...|$|E
2500|$|Abu Ghosh mayor Salim Jaber {{attributed}} the {{good relations with}} Israel to the great importance attached to being hospitable: [...] "We welcome anybody, regardless of religion or race." [...] According to a village elder interviewed by the Toronto Globe and Mail: [...] "Perhaps because {{of the history of}} feuding with the Arabs around us we allied ourselves with the Jews...against the British. We did not join the Arabs from the other villages bombarding Jewish vehicles in 1947. The Palmach fought many villages around us. But there was an order to leave us alone. The other Arabs never thought there would be a Jewish government here...During the first truce of the War of Independence, I {{was on my way to}} Ramallah to see my father and uncles, and I was captured by Jordanian soldiers. They <b>accused</b> <b>me</b> <b>of</b> being a traitor and tortured me for six days." ...|$|E

2500|$|In 1967, she {{performed}} as Carmen in the Carmen Suite, choreographed specifically for her by Cuban choreographer Alberto Alonso. The music was re-scored from Bizet’s original by her husband, Rodion Shchedrin, and its themes were re-worked into a [...] "modernist and almost abstract narrative." [...] Dancer Olympia Dowd, who performed alongside her, writes that Plisetskaya’s dramatic portrayal of Carmen, her favorite role, {{made her a}} legend, and soon became a [...] "landmark" [...] in the Bolshoi's repertoire. Her Carmen, however, at first [...] "rattled the Soviet establishment," [...] which was [...] "shaken with her Latin sensuality." [...] She was aware that her dance style was radical and new, saying that [...] "every gesture, every look, every movement had meaning, was different from all other ballets... The Soviet Union was not ready {{for this sort of}} choreography. It was war, they <b>accused</b> <b>me</b> <b>of</b> betraying classical dance." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{financial}} crisis that originated in Thailand in 1997 was particularly unnerving {{because of its}} scope and severity.... By the beginning of 1997, {{it was clear to}} Soros Fund Management that the discrepancy between the trade account and the capital account was becoming untenable. We sold short the Thai baht and the Malaysian ringgit early in 1997 with maturities ranging from six months to a year. (That is, we entered into contracts to deliver at future dates Thai baht and Malaysian ringgit that we did not currently hold.) Subsequently Prime Minister Mahathir of Malaysia <b>accused</b> <b>me</b> <b>of</b> causing the crisis, a wholly unfounded accusation. We were not sellers of the currency during or several months before the crisis; on the contrary, we were buyers when the currencies began to decline—we were purchasing ringgits to realize the profits on our earlier speculation. (Much too soon, as it turned out. We left most of the potential gain on the table because we were afraid that Mahathir would impose capital controls. He did so, but much later.) ...|$|E
2500|$|Hooley {{claims that}} she was promised major storylines that never materialised, was asked {{to come up with}} ideas for black characters, but that all her pages of {{suggestions}} (including developing an interesting relationship with the character Dot Cotton or having Josie start her own business) were ignored. She also claims {{that she was}} only used for two-thirds of her contracted appearances. She said: [...] "In the 18 months I was in EastEnders, I had no impact. There was nothing that made people sit up and take notice of what Josie was doing. It was like they remembered I was around and threw me a line where I would slide into the bar and say, 'Hello, how are you' and then sit on a stool and say nothing {{for the rest of the}} episode. I came to feel that I was letting the black community down because my character was so empty. People of my own colour often accosted me in public and <b>accused</b> <b>me</b> <b>of</b> playing a token black. I was so little-used that they even wrote me cheques for episodes I never appeared in. So why did they not use me? Why are they wasting the taxpayers' money? It was very dispiriting." ...|$|E

2500|$|Following the {{declaration}} {{of a state of}} emergency, Bolivian troops took control of the airport in Pando's capital, Cobija, and prepared to retake the city. Morales accused the governor of Pando of orchestrating [...] "a massacre" [...] of farmers supporting Morales. Pando Governor Leopoldo Fernández rejected the accusation, saying [...] "They've <b>accused</b> <b>me</b> <b>of</b> using hit men, when everyone knows those socialist peasants, those fake peasants, were armed." [...] In a speech in Cochabamba, Morales condemned the opposition governors, saying they were [...] "conspiring against us with a fascist, racist coup," [...] and said they were [...] "the enemies of all Bolivians." [...] While promising to adopt a constitution opposed by the governors Morales said Bolivia's [...] "democratic revolution" [...] had to be seen through saying [...] "We have always cried 'fatherland or death'. If we don't emerge victorious, we have to die for the country and the Bolivian people." [...] Morales also said he would not hesitate to extend the state of emergency to other opposition-controlled departments. Rubén Costas, the governor of Santa Cruz, belittled the chances of a breakthrough in talks adding that [...] "if there is just one more death or person wounded, any possibility of dialogue will be broken." ...|$|E
