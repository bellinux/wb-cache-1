25|$|A {{related and}} more general {{phenomenon}} {{is that of}} subjective validation. Subjective validation occurs when two unrelated or even random events <b>are</b> <b>perceived</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> related because a belief, expectation, or hypothesis demands a relationship. For example, while reading a horoscope, people actively seek a correspondence between its contents and their perception of their personality.|$|E
25|$|Social {{comparison}} {{means that}} individuals {{are more comfortable}} interacting with others who share common characteristics with themselves, such as a psychiatric illness, {{in order to establish}} a sense of normalcy. By interacting with others who <b>are</b> <b>perceived</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> better than them, peers are given a sense of optimism and something to strive toward.|$|E

25|$|After harvesting, {{the seeds}} are usually cleaned and hulled. In some countries, once the seeds have been hulled, they are passed through an {{electronic}} colour-sorting machine that rejects any discolored seeds to ensure perfect colour. This is done because sesame seeds with consistent appearance <b>are</b> <b>perceived</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> of better quality by consumers, and sell {{for a higher}} price.|$|E
25|$|Mammalian cells require {{stimulation}} for {{cell division}} and survival; {{in the absence}} of growth factor, apoptosis ensues. Such requirements for extracellular stimulation are necessary for controlling cell behavior in unicellular and multicellular organisms; signal transduction pathways <b>are</b> <b>perceived</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> so central to biological processes {{that a large number of}} diseases are attributed to their disregulation.|$|E
25|$|Inflation {{levels and}} trends: Typically a {{currency}} will lose value {{if there is}} a high level of inflation in the country or if inflation levels <b>are</b> <b>perceived</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> rising. This is because inflation erodes purchasing power, thus demand, for that particular currency. However, a currency may sometimes strengthen when inflation rises because of expectations that the central bank will raise short-term interest rates to combat rising inflation.|$|E

Females who are physically attractive have a higher mate value than those who are less physically attractive.|$|R

25|$|Practitioners of {{traditional}} herbal-based medicine and divination called albularyo {{are not considered}} witches. They <b>are</b> <b>perceived</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> either quack doctors or a quasi-magical option when western medicine fails to identify or cure an ailment that is thus suspected to be of supernatural, often malevolent, origin. Feng shui, an influence of Filipino Chinese culture, is also not classified as witchcraft as it is considered a separate realm of belief altogether.|$|E
25|$|Cricket imposes {{penalties}} on captains {{if their}} players bowl their overs {{at a very}} slow rate, such as fines, loss of competition points, and match bans. If a team is proceeding slowly, some captains will choose to use slow/spin bowlers. Such bowlers have a shorter run up so they complete their overs more quickly. Often this means choosing an inferior strategy by employing a less skillful bowler to avoid penalties that <b>are</b> <b>perceived</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> greater, such as being banned or losing points.|$|E
25|$|Micropsia is a {{condition}} affecting human visual perception in which objects <b>are</b> <b>perceived</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> smaller than they actually are. Micropsia {{can be caused by}} optical factors (such as wearing glasses), by distortion of images in the eye (such as optically, via swelling of the cornea or from changes {{in the shape of the}} retina such as from retinal edema, macular degeneration, or central serous retinopathy), by changes in the brain (such as from traumatic brain injury, epilepsy, migraines, prescription drugs, and illicit drugs), and from psychological factors. Dissociative phenomena are linked with micropsia, which may be the result of brain-lateralization disturbance.|$|E

25|$|Psychologists such as John B. Watson, Robert Plutchik, and Paul Ekman have {{suggested}} {{that there is only}} a small set of basic or innate emotions and that fear is one of them. This hypothesized set includes such emotions as acute stress reaction, anger, angst, anxiety, fright, horror, joy, panic, and sadness. Fear is closely related to, but should be distinguished from, the emotion anxiety, which occurs as the result of threats that <b>are</b> <b>perceived</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> uncontrollable or unavoidable. The fear response serves survival by generating appropriate behavioral responses, so it has been preserved throughout evolution.|$|E
25|$|IFS (B) {{officers}} {{themselves have}} an acrimonious rivalry with the secretarial personnel or stenographers who <b>are</b> <b>perceived</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> lower in prestige than the IFS (B) officers {{but have a}} closer working relationship with IFS (A) officers, giving the stenographers at times promotion opportunities ahead of IFS (B) officers. This rivalry {{was brought to the}} fore when a stenographer was appointed as Indian ambassador to North Korea in 2012. Within a week of the appointment IFS (B) officers vociferously protested. Three different associations representing IFS (B) officers came together to write a single complaint to the Prime Minister’s Office and the external affairs minister expressing their “utter disappointment” and requesting a review of the appointment.|$|E
25|$|Central to Theosophical {{belief is}} the idea that a group of spiritual adepts known as the Masters both exist and were {{responsible}} for the production of early Theosophical texts. For most Theosophists, these Masters are deemed to be the real founders of the modern Theosophical movement. In Theosophical literature, these Masters are also referred to as the Mahatmas, Adepts, Masters of Wisdom, Masters of Compassion, and Elder Brothers. They <b>are</b> <b>perceived</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a fraternity of human men who are highly evolved, both in terms of having an advanced moral development and intellectual attainment. They are claimed to have achieved extra-long life spans, and to have gained the power of clairvoyance and to project their soul out of their body to any other location in an instant. These are powers that they have allegedly attained through many years of training. According to Blavatsky, their chief residence was in the Himalayan kingdom of Tibet. She also claimed that these Masters were the source of many of her published writings.|$|E
40|$|Social {{rejection}} {{can lead}} to a variety of emotions. Two studies show that specific emotional reactions to social rejection can be understood by relying on the fundamental distinction between competence and warmth. Rejection that <b>is</b> <b>perceived</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> due <b>to</b> incompetence leads to anger, whereas rejection that <b>is</b> <b>perceived</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> due <b>to</b> lack of warmth leads to sadness. Study 1 measures perceptions of competence and warmth judgments. Study 2 manipulates those perceptions. In both studies, rejection that <b>was</b> <b>perceived</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> the result of incompetence led primarily to anger, while rejection that <b>was</b> <b>perceived</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> the result of lack of warmth led primarily to sadness. These results show that the effects of rejection can be better understood if we take into account how rejection <b>is</b> <b>perceived.</b> Highlights ► Adaptive emotional reactions to social rejection ► Compare effects of rejection due to lack of competence and due to lack of warmth ► Rejection due to lack of competence primarily leads to anger ► Rejection due to lack of warmth primarily leads to sadness Keywords: Social rejection, Competence warmth, Social perception, Emotio...|$|R

In-depth interviews were conducted, producing 802 pages of double-spaced interview transcripts, which were analyzed inductively for commonly experienced contradictions of stepchild-stepparent communication. Three underlying contradictions were identified. First, stepchild-stepparent communication <b>was</b> <b>perceived</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> characterized by a dialectic of integration, characterized by both closeness and distance. Second, stepchild-stepparent communication <b>was</b> <b>perceived</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> characterized by a dialectic of parental status, in which the stepparent was, and was not, granted legitimacy in a parent role. Third, stepchild-stepparent communication <b>was</b> <b>perceived</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> animated by a dialectic of expression in which both candor and discretion were featured...|$|R
25|$|I admire {{a lot of}} what's {{going on}} out there, but the {{oversize}} kind of cartoon action movies is not something I'm terribly comfortable with. I think what I do is much more in the tradition that the bullets are real and they'll knock you down. I used to really get criticized for my lack of realism, but now I think my films <b>are</b> <b>perceived</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> vastly more realistic {{than most of the}} action movies that are happening out there... I {{think one of the things}} about being a director is, you should always try to re-create within yourself the kind of emotions you had watching film when you were very young. The kind of action movies that I always liked, the kind of comic books I always liked, were the serious ones. The characters were very realistic within the framework of the drama, and that kind of action movie interests me a lot more than the super-heroes. And so in that sense, maybe I'm slightly out of step, I suppose, but so be it.|$|E
25|$|Electric cars enjoyed {{popularity}} {{between the}} late 19th century and early 20th century, when electricity {{was among the}} preferred methods for automobile propulsion, providing a level of comfort and ease of operation {{that could not be}} achieved by the gasoline cars of the time. Advances in internal combustion technology, especially the electric starter, soon rendered this advantage moot; the greater range of gasoline cars, quicker refueling times, and growing petroleum infrastructure, along with the mass production of gasoline vehicles by companies such as the Ford Motor Company, which reduced prices of gasoline cars to less than half that of equivalent electric cars, led to a decline in the use of electric propulsion, effectively removing it from important markets such as the United States by the 1930s. However, in recent years, increased concerns over the environmental impact of gasoline cars, higher gasoline prices, improvements in battery technology, and the prospect of peak oil, have brought about renewed interest in electric cars, which <b>are</b> <b>perceived</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> more environmentally friendly and cheaper to maintain and run, despite high initial costs, after a failed reappearance in the late-1990s.|$|E
25|$|War soon {{broke out}} over Nagorno Karabakh {{and ended in}} 1994 with the Armenian separatists gaining control over the territory. Turkic {{nationalism}} is the leading force in Baku and has undoubtedly contributed to the conflict with the Armenians given the historical enmity between Armenians and Turkey. All the major human rights monitors agreed that the status of Armenians, those married to or those who associate with Armenians, and those who <b>are</b> <b>perceived</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> sympathetic to Armenians, is extremely grave. There has also been numerous acts of vandalism against the Armenian Apostolic Church throughout Azerbaijan. The Armenians still remaining in Azerbaijan practically live in virtual hiding, and have also changed their Armenian names and surnames to Azerbaijani names and surnames {{because they have to}} maintain an extremely low profile to avoid harassment and physical attacks. They have continued to complain (in private due to fear of attacks) that they remain subject to harassmant and human rights violations and therefore have to hide their identity. Armenians and part Armenians living in Azerbaijan were reported as being refused permission to leave the country. They have also reported that the Department of Visas and Registrations took them off of the list of residents.|$|E

500|$|Proponents of {{neoliberalism}} have {{theorized that}} by increasing women's {{participation in the}} workforce, there will be heightened economic progress, but feminist critics have noted that this participation alone does not further equality in gender relations. Neoliberalism has failed to address significant problems such as the devaluation of feminized labour, the structural privileging of men and masculinity, and the politicization of women's subordination {{in the family and}} the workplace. The [...] "feminization of employment" [...] refers to a conceptual characterization of deteriorated and devalorized labour conditions that are less desirable, meaningful, safe and secure. [...] Employers in the global south have perceptions about feminine labour and seek workers who <b>are</b> <b>perceived</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> undemanding, docile and willing to accept low wages. [...] Social constructs about feminized labour have played a big part in this, for instance, employers often perpetuate ideas about women as 'secondary income earners to justify their lower rates of pay and not deserving of training or promotion.|$|E
