5|$|Bilinguals {{using two}} {{different}} alphabets should demonstrate a name-letter effect in both alphabets. A weaker effect should {{be found in}} the second alphabet, as names in second alphabets are likely to be less connected to the self. Hoorens and Todorova found that bilinguals with <b>a</b> <b>tendency</b> <b>to</b> like their name letters in Cyrillic also had <b>a</b> <b>tendency</b> <b>to</b> like their name letters in the Roman alphabet. The effect was found to be weaker in the second alphabet. This was replicated in a Thai-English study by Hoorens, Nuttin, Herman and Pavakanun.|$|E

5|$|The Chinese Huangdi Neijing (The Inner Canon of the Yellow Emperor) {{dating from}} ~300 BCE – 200 CE {{apparently}} refers to repeated paroxysmal fevers associated with enlarged spleens and <b>a</b> <b>tendency</b> <b>to</b> epidemic occurrence.|$|E

5|$|An {{invasive}} species is a plant, fungus, or animal species {{that is not}} native to a specific location (an introduced species), and which has <b>a</b> <b>tendency</b> <b>to</b> spread to a degree believed to cause damage to the environment, human economy or human health.|$|E

5|$|Because General Maurice Sarrail had {{demonstrated}} <b>a</b> <b>tendency</b> <b>to</b> interfere in politics, Prime Minister Georges Clemenceau relieved {{him of his}} command in December 1917. There was a strong French influence in Korçë even after the Autonomous Republic ceased to exist.

5|$|Despite being bred for racing, Whippets can be couch potatoes. When {{not running}} around, {{they are usually}} asleep or cuddled in their owner's lap. They are not prone to {{fighting}} but {{have been known to}} chase small pets, due to their sighthound nature. They also have <b>a</b> <b>tendency</b> <b>to</b> get up on furniture. Whippets are touch sensitive, meaning that they tend to jump or overreact when touched unexpectedly.|$|E
5|$|Herodian {{describes}} Caracalla {{as having}} preferred northern European clothing, Caracalla being {{the name of}} the short Gaulish cloak that he made fashionable, and he often wore a blond wig. Dio mentions that when Caracalla was a boy, he had <b>a</b> <b>tendency</b> <b>to</b> show an angry or even savage facial expression.|$|E

50|$|Most summer monsoons have a {{dominant}} westerly component and <b>a</b> strong <b>tendency</b> <b>to</b> ascend and produce copious amounts of rain (because of the condensation of water vapor in the rising air). The intensity and duration, however, are not uniform {{from year to}} year. Winter monsoons, by contrast, have {{a dominant}} easterly component and <b>a</b> strong <b>tendency</b> <b>to</b> diverge, subside and cause drought.|$|R
5|$|Iron(II) {{complexes}} {{are less}} stable than iron(III) complexes but {{the preference for}} O-donor ligands is less marked, so that for example 2+ is known while 3+ is not. They have <b>a</b> <b>tendency</b> <b>to</b> be oxidized to iron(III) but this can be moderated by low pH and the specific ligands used.|$|E
5|$|Like Lovinescu, other {{advocates of}} modernist {{literature}} rejected most of Cerna's contributions. One {{of the first}} to have done so is Ovid Densusianu, who stated his belief that an artist's work should be separated from his life. Lovinescu, who commented on Densusianu and his thoughts on Cerna, opined that Densusianu had <b>a</b> <b>tendency</b> <b>to</b> reject all poets who registered popular success, and that he treated Dimitrie Anghel's work in much the same way.|$|E
5|$|Similarly, {{pathogenic}} mutations {{have been}} identified in the prion-like domains of heterogeneous nuclear riboproteins hnRNPA2B1 and hnRNPA1 in familial cases of muscle, brain, bone and motor neuron degeneration. The wild-type form of all of these proteins show <b>a</b> <b>tendency</b> <b>to</b> self-assemble into amyloid fibrils, while the pathogenic mutations exacerbate this behaviour and lead to excess accumulation.|$|E
60|$|I {{have now}} {{shown that the}} great qualities of our {{lifeboat}} are--buoyancy, or <b>a</b> <b>tendency</b> not <b>to</b> sink; self-righting power, or inability to remain upside down; self-emptying power, or a capacity to discharge any water that may get into it; and stability, or <b>a</b> <b>tendency</b> not <b>to</b> upset. The last quality I shall refer to, though {{by no means the}} least, is strength.|$|R

5|$|Staszic was {{remembered by}} his contemporaries as a loner {{and not a}} person who was quick to make friends. He has been {{described}} as somewhat miserly; despite acquiring significant wealth, he was said to wear old clothes and use an old carriage. He was nonetheless widely respected by his contemporaries. He was seen as stern but honest, and had <b>a</b> <b>tendency</b> <b>to</b> speak in a fashion that some found amusing.|$|E
5|$|The {{lineup of}} the live band had <b>a</b> <b>tendency</b> <b>to</b> change {{drastically}} between major tours: aside from Reznor remaining on lead vocals, keyboards and guitar, no {{member of the}} live band had remained constant since its inception. Reznor cited the long gestation period between studio albums {{as part of the}} reason for these frequent personnel changes, as well as his desire for fresh interpretations of his music.|$|E
5|$|The {{object of}} your command is, to destroy with fire and sword (if practicable) the Indian town and {{settlement}} at Sandusky, {{by which we}} hope to give ease and safety to the inhabitants of this country; but, if impracticable, then you will doubtless perform such other services in your power as will, in their consequences, have <b>a</b> <b>tendency</b> <b>to</b> answer this great end.|$|E

5|$|The only decorations in the {{manuscript}} are decorative tail-pieces {{at the end of}} each book (see illustration) and it also shows <b>a</b> <b>tendency</b> <b>to</b> increase the size of the first letter of each sentence. The capitals at the beginning of the sections stand out in the margin as in codices Ephraemi and Basilensis. Codex Alexandrinus is the oldest manuscript to use capital letters to indicate new sections.|$|E
5|$|Another {{difficulty}} encountered {{during the}} aircraft's introduction was {{the occurrence of}} surging and stalling with the Avon engines. The F.2, which used the Armstrong-Siddeley Sapphire engine, did not suffer from this issue. Further problems occurred; ejected cannon ammunition links had <b>a</b> <b>tendency</b> <b>to</b> strike and damage {{the underside of the}} fuselage, and diverting the gas emitted by the cannon during firing was another necessary modification. The original split-flap airbrakes caused adverse changes in pitch trim and were quickly replaced by a single ventral airbrake. This meant, however, that the airbrake could not be used for landings.|$|E
5|$|Ayumi is Yuu's and Shunsuke's {{energetic}} {{younger sister}} {{in junior high}} school. She has an innocent personality and deeply cares for Yuu, providing moral support to him.

She {{is a fan of}} the band How-Low-Hello and an avid admirer of Yusa. She eventually awakens an ability to cause anything around her to suddenly collapse, but this is stolen by Yuu to prevent her death.|$|E
