5|$|The foyer of {{the tower}} was {{originally}} planned to be an open-air forecourt between {{the building and the}} remains of the Palace Hotel, however extensive <b>aeroelastic</b> wind testing of the structure by the Institute of Environmental Sciences at Murdoch University forced this area to be covered with a glass canopy. Mocks of the curtain walls {{to be used in the}} tower were also tested to 1.5 times the proof load to ensure they could withstand cyclone-force weather and seismic shocks. The building is clad with green-tinted double-pane glass on windows, with the service core and structure of the building covered with aluminium sheeting skin coated with a light grey fluoropolymer paint.|$|E
25|$|X-53 Active <b>Aeroelastic</b> Wing: A NASA F/A-18 {{has been}} {{modified}} {{to demonstrate the}} Active <b>Aeroelastic</b> Wing technology, and was designated X-53 in December 2006.|$|E
25|$|Larger, {{more costly}} {{turbines}} generally have geared power trains, alternating current output, flaps and are actively pointed into the wind. Direct drive generators and <b>aeroelastic</b> blades for large wind turbines are being researched.|$|E
25|$|The {{model can}} be used to predict the flutter margin and, if necessary, test fixes to {{potential}} problems. Small carefully chosen changes to mass distribution and local structural stiffness can be very effective in solving <b>aeroelastic</b> problems.|$|E
25|$|In 2002, the Directorate {{initiated}} the X-53 Active <b>Aeroelastic</b> Wing program {{in cooperation with}} NASA's Dryden Flight Research Center and Boeing Phantom Works to research ways to make more efficient use of the wing surface during high-speed maneuvers.|$|E
25|$|In {{flexible}} wings, much {{or all of}} a {{wing surface}} can change shape in flight to deflect air flow much like an ornithopter. Adaptive compliant wings are a military and commercial effort. The X-53 Active <b>Aeroelastic</b> Wing was a US Air Force, NASA, and Boeing effort.|$|E
25|$|These videos {{detail the}} Active <b>Aeroelastic</b> Wing {{two-phase}} NASA-Air Force flight research program {{to investigate the}} potential of aerodynamically twisting flexible wings to improve maneuverability of high-performance aircraft at transonic and supersonic speeds, with traditional control surfaces such as ailerons and leading-edge flaps used to induce the twist.|$|E
25|$|Tacoma Narrows Bridge, (USA), 853m – 1940. The Tacoma Narrows {{bridge was}} {{vulnerable}} to structural vibration in sustained and moderately strong winds {{due to its}} plate-girder deck structure. Wind caused a phenomenon called <b>aeroelastic</b> fluttering that led to its collapse only months after completion. The collapse was captured on film.|$|E
25|$|The 2nd {{failure of}} Samuel Langley's {{prototype}} plane on the Potomac has {{been attributed to}} <b>aeroelastic</b> effects (specifically, torsional divergence). Problems with torsional divergence plagued aircraft in the First World War, and were solved largely by trial-and-error and ad-hoc stiffening of the wing. In 1926, Hans Reissner published a theory of wing divergence, leading to much further theoretical research on the subject.|$|E
25|$|In an aeroplane, two {{significant}} static <b>aeroelastic</b> effects may occur. Divergence {{is a phenomenon}} in which the elastic twist of the wing suddenly becomes theoretically infinite, typically causing the wing to fail spectacularly. Control reversal is a phenomenon occurring only in wings with ailerons or other control surfaces, in which these control surfaces reverse their usual functionality (e.g., the rolling direction associated with a given aileron moment is reversed).|$|E
25|$|Given {{the large}} {{economic}} and commercial interests at stake, {{there was a}} certain amount of controversy surrounding the decision. After the loss of the G.91 prototype due to <b>aeroelastic</b> vibration on 20 February 1957, the French government decided to pursue development of the locally designed Étendard. The British government similarly ignored the competition to concentrate on Hawker Hunter production. In contrast, the Italian government preemptively ordered the G.91 for the Italian Air Force before the results of the competition were known.|$|E
25|$|Most {{suspension}} bridges have open truss {{structures to}} support the roadbed, particularly owing to the unfavorable effects of using plate girders, discovered from the Tacoma Narrows Bridge (1940) bridge collapse. Recent developments in bridge aerodynamics have allowed the re-introduction of plate structures first seen on the Severn bridge built in the 1960s. In {{the picture of the}} Yichang Bridge, note the very sharp entry edge and sloping undergirders in the suspension bridge shown. This enables this type of construction to be used without the danger of vortex shedding and consequent <b>aeroelastic</b> effects, such as those that destroyed the original Tacoma Narrows bridge.|$|E
25|$|The {{control system}} is complex {{due to the}} sheer size of the {{aircraft}} and the need to compensate for <b>aeroelastic</b> deformation of the structure, as well as the very large friction loads of the control rods, levers etc. To keep control forces felt by the pilots to a minimum, the control system is in three distinct phases. Phase one is direct mechanical control from pilot inputs which is fed into phase two. Phase two is the intermediate powered control system with low-powered hydraulic boosters transferring commands to the third phase. Phase three is the high-powered rapid action control actuators at the main gearboxes operating the swashplates directly.|$|E
25|$|The first {{prototype}} {{was followed}} by the second prototype early on during the following year. During testing, the aircraft reportedly attained 805km/h (500mph) in a dive free of negative tendencies such as flutter and other <b>aeroelastic</b> issues; although it could muster only 500km/h (310mph) in level flight {{due to a lack of}} engine power. Nevertheless, this capability was superior than the performance of the competing Fiat G.50, Reggiane Re.2000, A.U.T. 18, IMAM Ro.51, and Caproni-Vizzola F.5; of these, the Re.2000 was seen as the most capable of the C.200's rivals, being more maneuverable and capable of greater performance at low altitude but lacked structural strength.|$|E
25|$|A 1 to 80 scale section {{model of}} the deck in the {{erection}} stage, and a 1 to 400 scale full <b>aeroelastic</b> {{model of the}} entire bridge were constructed. It is a Monte-Carlo simulation of the typhoon wind climate. The full model was tested in different stages of construction in turbulent boundary layer flow, complete with the local topography to model the wind conditions at the site. The model tests identified critical stages of erection that allowed the construction schedule of the bridge to be tailored to avoid the typhoon season. The comparison of model test results and the full scale monitoring will assist engineers {{to better understand the}} behaviour of long span bridges in wind and to improve current design methods.|$|E
25|$|Small wind {{turbines}} {{may be used}} for a variety of applications including on- or off-grid residences, telecom towers, offshore platforms, rural schools and clinics, remote monitoring and other purposes that require energy where there is no electric grid, or where the grid is unstable. Small {{wind turbines}} may be as small as a fifty-watt generator for boat or caravan use. Hybrid solar and wind powered units are increasingly being used for traffic signage, particularly in rural locations, as they avoid the need to lay long cables from the nearest mains connection point. The U.S. Department of Energy's National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) defines small wind turbines as those smaller than or equal to 100 kilowatts. Small units often have direct drive generators, direct current output, <b>aeroelastic</b> blades, lifetime bearings and use a vane to point into the wind.|$|E
25|$|There were {{problems}} with the innovative use of blue reflective glass in a steel tower: Entire 4' × 11', 500-lb (1.2 × 3.4 m, 227kg) windowpanes detached from the building and crashed to the sidewalk hundreds of feet below. Police closed off surrounding streets whenever winds reached 45mph (72km/h). Under the direction of Frank H. Durgin of MIT's Wright Brothers Wind Tunnel a scale model of the entire Back Bay and an <b>aeroelastic</b> model of the John Hancock Tower were built and tested in the wind tunnel to identify the problem. The research {{raised questions about the}} structural integrity of the entire building (due to unanticipated twisting of the structure), but did not account for the loss of the glass panels. An independent laboratory eventually confirmed that the failure of the glass was due to oscillations and repeated thermal stresses caused by the expansion and contraction of the air between the inner and outer glass panels which formed each window; the resilient bonding between the inner glass, reflective material, and outer glass was so stiff that it was transmitting the force to the outer glass (instead of absorbing it), thus causing the glass to fail.|$|E

500|$|The YB-52, {{the second}} XB-52 {{modified}} with more operational equipment, first flew on 15 April 1952 with [...] "Tex" [...] Johnston as pilot. During ground testing on 29 November 1951, the XB-52's pneumatic system failed during a full-pressure test; the resulting explosion severely damaged the trailing {{edge of the}} wing, necessitating considerable repairs. A two-hour, 21-minute proving flight from Boeing Field, King County, in Seattle, Washington to Larson AFB was undertaken with Boeing test pilot Johnston and air force Lieutenant Colonel Guy M. Townsend. The XB-52 followed on 2 October 1952. The thorough development, including 670 days in the wind tunnel and 130 days of aerodynamic and <b>aeroelastic</b> testing, paid off with smooth flight testing. Encouraged, the air force increased its order to 282 B-52s.|$|E

2500|$|The {{primary test}} {{objective}} was to study the <b>aeroelastic</b> effects on the aft wing of the forward wing's rotors and establish a baseline aircraft configuration. Alan Ewing, Bell's QTR program manager, reported that [...] "Testing showed those loads from that vortex on the rear rotor [...] same as the loads we see on the front ," [...] and [...] "Aeroelastic stability of the wing looks {{exactly the same as}} the conventional tiltrotor". These tests used a model with a three-bladed rotor, future tests will explore the effects of using a four-bladed system.|$|E
2500|$|Like many {{introductory}} physics texts, The Mechanical Universe {{cites the}} spectacular 1940 {{collapse of the}} Tacoma Narrows Bridge {{as an example of}} resonance, using footage of the disaster in the [...] "Resonance" [...] episode. However, as more-recent expositions have emphasized, the catastrophic oscillations that destroyed the bridge were not due to simple mechanical resonance, but to a more complicated interaction between the bridge and the winds passing through it—a phenomenon known as <b>aeroelastic</b> flutter. This phenomenon is a kind of [...] "self-sustaining vibration" [...] that lies beyond the regime of applicability of the linear theory of the externally-driven simple harmonic oscillator.|$|E
2500|$|Before the Boeing 747 had flown, a Ministry of Civil Aviation {{delegation}} {{visited the}} USA {{for a series}} of detailed sales presentations on the type lasting three days. At the 1971 Paris Salon, Ilyushin bureau head Genrikh Novozhilov and Boeing's Joe Sutter are claimed to have arranged an informal technology trade-off. Over supper in a Paris restaurant, the Soviet side ceded information on titanium technology to the Americans, while the latter, [...] "sketching on the tablecloth," [...] ceded information on pylon-mounted podded engines and [...] "the structural and aerodynamic amity of the <b>aeroelastic</b> wing." [...] Soviet interest in buying the 747s continued until the end of détente in the late 1970s.|$|E
2500|$|Between 1934 and 1938 A. R. Collar and W. J. Duncan {{published}} the first papers with the representation and terminology for matrix {{systems that are}} used today. <b>Aeroelastic</b> research continued through World War II but publication restrictions from 1938 to 1947 make this work difficult to trace. The second major breakthrough in matrix structural analysis occurred through 1954 and 1955 when professor John H. Argyris systemized the concept of assembling elemental components of a structure into a system of equations. Finally, on Nov. 6 1959, M. J. Turner, head of Boeing’s Structural Dynamics Unit, published a paper outlining the direct stiffness method as {{an efficient model for}} computer implementation [...]|$|E
2500|$|During {{development}} testing <b>aeroelastic</b> flutter was observed during {{a test that}} measured how the aircraft performed if its wing-to-strut join fitting fails {{at the same time}} the fuel tanks in the horizontal stabilizer were filled at over 15% of their capacity. [...] To meet FAA regulations, Boeing reported in January 2012 that 747-8's fuel tanks in the horizontal stabilizers will be closed off to prevent their use until the flutter condition can be resolved; this reduced range by [...] On December 18, 2013, Boeing announced that a series of new performance packages will allow for the reactivation of the tail fuel tanks by early 2014. Older 747-8s can also be retrofitted with them.|$|E
2500|$|The first {{experimental}} model, with a [...] antenna, {{was set up}} on {{the roof}} of the Radiation Lab. Although crude, it demonstrated that the basic idea was sound. A [...] version followed late in 1942, and then an [...] one with 108 dipoles in early 1943. It was pointed out that the dihedral and sweepback of most aircraft would make installation of an in-wing scanner difficult, and <b>aeroelastic</b> loads during flight, especially [...] "flapping", would be a serious concern. The team moved to a [...] long model with 252 dipoles, mounted in a separate streamlined wing-like enclosure. The width was limited to 16feet simply because that was the largest wood planer the team could access. Two dipoles were later removed at the request of an industrial partner who preferred to work with round numbers.|$|E
2500|$|The F-18, {{initially}} {{known as}} McDonnell Douglas Model 267, was drastically modified from the YF-17. For carrier operations, the airframe, undercarriage, and tailhook were strengthened, folding wings and catapult attachments were added, and {{the landing gear}} widened. To meet Navy range and reserves requirements, McDonnell increased fuel capacity by , by enlarging the dorsal spine and adding a 96-gallon fuel tank to each wing. A [...] "snag" [...] {{was added to the}} wing's leading edge and stabilators to prevent an <b>Aeroelastic</b> flutter discovered in the F-15 stabilator. The wings and stabilators were enlarged, the aft fuselage widened by , and the engines canted outward at the front. These changes added [...] to the gross weight, bringing it to [...] The YF-17's control system was replaced with a fully digital fly-by-wire system with quadruple-redundancy, the first to be installed in a production fighter.|$|E
2500|$|Senior {{engineer}} Charles Alton Ellis, collaborating remotely with Moisseiff, was {{the principal}} engineer of the project. Moisseiff produced the basic structural design, introducing his [...] "deflection theory" [...] by which a thin, flexible roadway would flex in the wind, greatly reducing stress by transmitting forces via suspension cables to the bridge towers. Although the Golden Gate Bridge design has proved sound, a later Moisseiff design, the original Tacoma Narrows Bridge, collapsed in a strong windstorm soon after it was completed, because of an unexpected <b>aeroelastic</b> flutter. Ellis was also tasked with designing a [...] "bridge within a bridge" [...] in the southern abutment, to avoid the need to demolish Fort Point, a pre–Civil War masonry fortification viewed, even then, as worthy of historic preservation. He penned a graceful steel arch spanning the fort and carrying the roadway to the bridge's southern anchorage.|$|E
2500|$|The Nieuport 11 was a smaller, {{simplified}} {{version of}} the Nieuport 10, designed specifically as a single-seat fighter. Like the [...] "10" [...] the [...] "11" [...] was a sesquiplane, a biplane with a full-sized top wing with two spars, and a lower wing of much narrower chord and a single spar. Interplane struts {{in the form of}} a [...] "Vee" [...] joined the wings together. The sesquiplane layout reduces drag and improves the rate of climb, as well as offering a better view from the cockpit than either biplane or monoplane, while being substantially stronger than contemporary monoplanes. The narrow lower wing may be subject to [...] <b>aeroelastic</b> flutter at high air speeds, a problem that manifested itself on the much faster German Albatros D.III and the later [...] "vee-strut" [...] Nieuport fighters. A single example of the Nieuport 11 was modified with a smaller lower wing and canted interplance struts but no further development ensued.|$|E
2500|$|As {{aircraft}} speed increased, designers began to encounter challenges associated with air compressibility at speeds near {{or greater than}} the speed of sound. [...] The differences in air flows under such conditions leds to problems in aircraft control, increased drag due to shock waves, and the threat of structural failure due to <b>aeroelastic</b> flutter. [...] The ratio of the flow speed to the speed of sound was named the Mach number after Ernst Mach {{who was one of the}} first to investigate the properties of supersonic flow. William John Macquorn Rankine and Pierre Henri Hugoniot independently developed the theory for flow properties before and after a shock wave, while Jakob Ackeret led the initial work of calculating the lift and drag of supersonic airfoils. Theodore von Kármán and Hugh Latimer Dryden introduced the term transonic to describe flow speeds around Mach 1 where drag increases rapidly. This rapid increase in drag led aerodynamicists and aviators to disagree on whether supersonic flight was achievable until the sound barrier was broken for the first time in 1947 using the Bell X-1 aircraft.|$|E

Active <b>Aeroelastic</b> Wing Technology is a technology that integrates wing aerodynamics, controls, and structure to harness and control wing <b>aeroelastic</b> twist at high speeds and dynamic pressures. By using multiple leading and trailing edge controls like [...] "aerodynamic tabs", subtle amounts of <b>aeroelastic</b> twist can be controlled to provide large amounts of wing control power, while minimizing maneuver air loads at high wing strain conditions or aerodynamic drag at low wing strain conditions.
