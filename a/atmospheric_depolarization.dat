40|$|The {{experiment}} considered {{is mainly}} {{concerned with the}} depolarizing effects of precipitation at millimeter wavelengths. Excessive depolarization introduces cross talk into communication systems which employ orthogonal polarization for frequency reuse. An understanding of <b>atmospheric</b> <b>depolarization</b> phenomena is, therefore, required {{for the design of}} future earth-satellite communications systems. Attenuation and cross polarization ratio data obtained under various meteorological conditions, including rain and a snowstorm, are presented...|$|E
40|$|During the Nauru 99 field campaign, the National Oceanic and <b>Atmospheric</b> Administration’s (NOAA’s) <b>depolarization</b> and {{backscatter}} lidar (DABUL) obtained cloud {{data from}} aboard the research vessel Ron Brown. This lidar system, which obtains information on cloud occurrence and phase, documented {{a variety of}} cloud scenarios: boundary layer water clouds; mid-level, mixed-phase cloud systems with precipitation; and high-altitude ice phase cirrus clouds. This latter cloud type is especially interesting and emphasized here because it was often not detected by other instruments...|$|R
40|$|As part of EUCAARI (European {{integrated}} project on Aerosol loud Climate and Air Quality Interactions) the field campaign LONGREX (LONG Range Experiment) {{was carried out}} in May / June 2008 to investigate physical and chemical properties of aerosols on European scale. During the campaign the DLR Falcon research aircraft was equipped with a nadir-looking high spectral resolution lidar (HSRL) and a set of in-situ sensors and conducted a total of 15 research flights from Oberpfaffenhofen, Germany. The advantage of a HSRL over a normal backscatter lidar is the ability to directly measure the climatically important aerosol extinction. The Falcon flights were coordinated with the British BAe- 146 (FAAM, Airborne Facility for Atmospheric Measurements), which was mainly operating within the boundary layer. The HSRL on board the Falcon provided direct measurements of the aerosol optical thickness, the aerosols’ vertical distribution, and their optical properties at 532 nm as well as <b>atmospheric</b> backscatter and <b>depolarization</b> at 1064 nm. The HSRL measurements were compared to results of satellite based sensors and in-situ instruments, respectively. Due to a persistent high pressure system over Europe {{during the first half of}} the campaign, the build-up of pollution aerosol within the boundary layer was favoured and the aerosol layers could be analyzed with respect to ageing and transport. Different source contributions to the aerosol layers could be estimated using backward trajectory and retro-plume calculations...|$|R
