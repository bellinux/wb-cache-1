25|$|On {{the night}} of February 10, 1981, an arson fire started at the Las Vegas Hilton, {{which at the time}} was being {{retrofitted}} with modern fire safety equipment. Firefighters, using the knowledge they had learned from the MGM Grand fire, used local television networks to notify people to stay in their rooms <b>and</b> <b>not</b> <b>go</b> out to the halls and stairwells. Because of the lessons learned, only eight people died in this fire compared with the 85 people who died in the MGM Grand fire. Famed singer Natalie Cole was trapped inside the Hilton during the fire, possibly sustaining lung damage from smoke inhalation that was not detected by doctors in 1981. In 1982, Philip Bruce Cline was sentenced to eight life sentences for his role in starting the fire.|$|E
25|$|If Charlie {{is uncomfortable}} with Nancy and her desires, he has bigger {{problems}} with the lizards. At first, he insists {{that they are a}} death hallucination caused by rotten liver paste sandwiches. While the creatures intrigue Nancy, Charlie continually acts with fear and resistance. He follows his wife's lead on posing submissively when the creatures first approach, but he will not respond to them until she orders him to. Even after the ice has been broken, Charlie remains uncertain about the creatures and their intentions. Leslie and Sarah's ignorance on many things (emotions, anatomy, etc.) adds to Charlie's negative attitude. When he has to explain these ideas to them, he is easily frustrated and often condescending. He drives Leslie to beat and choke him. Yet at the end, Charlie agrees with Nancy that the lizards have to stay on land <b>and</b> <b>not</b> <b>go</b> back into the water. Though he helps because Nancy will do it whether or not he agrees, Charlie does offer to take them by the hand.|$|E
25|$|Prior to {{the early}} 1990s, any {{producer}} of Muscadet wine could use the phrase sur lie on their wine labels regardless {{of the length of}} time and manner that it actually spent in contact with the lees. In 1994, French authorities designed regulations that limit the use of sur lie to only wines that comply with a set guideline. First, while the sub-appellations of Muscadet-Sèvre et Maine, Muscadet-Coteaux de la Loire and Muscadet-Côtes de Grandlieu are permitted to use the term, any wine labeled with just the generic AOC Muscadet cannot. Second, the wine must spend at least a full winter in contact with the lees and not be bottled until after the third week of March following the harvest. Some wines are kept in contact longer, in order to produce a more full-bodied style, and not bottled till between mid-October to mid-November. Finally the wine must be bottled directly off its lees <b>and</b> <b>not</b> <b>go</b> through any racking or filtration process. Currently there is no regulation on the size or type of vessel that the wine should be kept in sur lie with. There is a movement among some Muscadet producers to limit the practice to just that done in standard-sized oak barrels, but currently any size barrel or even stainless steel fermentation tanks are allowed to age a wine sur lie and label it accordingly.|$|E

[...] Garson Kanin shared their viewpoint and described Leigh as [...] "a stunner whose ravishing beauty often tended to obscure her staggering achievements as an actress. Great beauties are infrequently great actresses– simply because they don't need to be. Vivien was different; ambitious, persevering, serious, often inspired." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{response}} to questions posed by The Guardian and handed to the band via their lawyer, Pussy Riot accused Putin and the Russian Orthodox Church of orchestrating the case. Samutsevich said in December 2012 that [...] "more than anything, what many people didn't see during the trial were those moments when our 'right to defence' was violated. It's not that we were helpless, it was a situation of despair." [...] In an interview with The Guardian, she continued: [...] "The trial was built {{in such a way}} that we couldn't defend ourselves. They didn't listen to us. We could have sat downstairs, where you wait till you're taken to the courtroom, <b>and</b> <b>not</b> <b>go</b> in at all and everything would've gone the same way.

Eden's predecessor Sir Winston Churchill commented on 22 November, [...] "I cannot understand why our troops were halted. To go so far <b>and</b> <b>not</b> <b>go</b> on was madness." [...] Churchill further added that while {{he might not have}} dared to begin the military operation, nevertheless once having ordered it he would certainly not have dared to stop it before it had achieved its objective. Without further guarantee, the Anglo-French Task Force had to finish withdrawing by 22 December 1956, to be replaced by Danish and Colombian units of the UNEF.|$|E
2500|$|On an April 13, 2012, {{appearance}} on Stossel, Palin {{explained that she}} disagreed with host John Stossel {{on the subject of}} drug legalization but reiterated her belief that the government should better prioritize drug laws: [...] "You take even more of a stronger libertarian view than I do on some of those issues, like the War on Drugs. I happen to believe that we need to continue to do all that we can to discourage drug use, especially with our youth. I would like to see, though, law enforcement prioritize its time and resources <b>and</b> <b>not</b> <b>go</b> out and bust a guy in his house, maybe smoking a joint, who's not doing anybody else any harm, and, in the meantime, go out and find the bad guys and you know, try to help keep society safe that way.

After not having directed a film in years, he returned to adapt the autobiography. The script mostly followed Northup's autobiography, though Parks had to change some parts. Parks said, [...] "Solomon was very tolerant in a terrible situation, and very fair in his reporting. I tried to remain fair in my reporting <b>and</b> <b>not</b> <b>go</b> overboard, although it's very difficult not to when you know so much happened that was so bad to so many people. But there were things I had to change." [...] Five historical advisers assisted with the film, though Parks said he felt pressured [...] "to keep it toned down".|$|E

2500|$|On {{the issue}} of fair play, Blatter said [...] "There {{is a lack of}} {{discipline}} and respect in the game by the players because they are cheating" [...] and [...] "How can it happen that all over the world, through TV cameras, we have seen through a cheating handball that a pass was given for a goal? Everyone is asking what is and what isn't fair play. The highest crime in football is touching the ball with the hands". Referring to the possibility of using assistant referees or goal line technology, Blatter stated, [...] "match control is now is on the agenda. How shall we avoid such situations as we have seen in this very specific match?" [...] Blatter repeated his stated opposition to video refereeing, saying, [...] "With technology, you have to stop a match. You have a look at cameras...

Around the time of its release, it was rumored that drummer Ryan Seaman parted ways with the band, and now has a new band with Dallon Weekes of Panic! at the Disco entitled I Don't Know How But They Found Me. This was confirmed when the band performed on May 8, without Seaman with Chris Kamrada playing drums as a touring member.|$|E

One of his favorite exclamatory phrases is [...] "frickin' frack!" [...] He refers to the bullpen as the [...] "ballpen", and once shouted that the Yankees are [...] "... done! D-O-E-N , DONE!" [...] His relationship status is intriguing enough for Steve Somers to once give Jerome $60 to take a lady out on a date, only for Jerome to keep the money <b>and</b> <b>not</b> <b>go</b> out on the date. Former host Sid Rosenberg once asked Jerome if he was upset that he was not taking his eagerly anticipated trip [...] "... to Colorado?", and Jerome replied, [...] "No, [...] to Denver." [...] He does [...] "... not like jets. They make [...] seasick." [...] Jerome, when he still called WFAN regularly, was known as being the only caller to have an audio intro, much like those played at the top of each show. Mr. Mittelman's health problems had kept him from the WFAN airwaves on a regular basis from late 2004 until mid-2008; when he again started to call in more frequently. Occasionally when he calls into Steve Somers' program, a special introduction is played to the tune of The Twilight Zone.|$|E
