5|$|In both Mozambique and Malawi, Delfina dropped heavy {{rainfall}} that caused flooding. In the former country, over 18,000houses were severely damaged or destroyed, leaving thousands homeless. The storm damaged roads and bridges, which disrupted relief {{efforts in the}} aftermath, and floods destroyed widespread areas of crops {{in the midst of}} an ongoing food shortage. Lingering flooding caused an outbreak of cholera <b>and</b> <b>malaria</b> in Mozambique, and 47people were killed by Delfina. In Malawi, flooding was not widespread, although the storm destroyed about 3,600houses and killed eight people. Only two months after the storm struck, however, Cyclone Japhet left damage and deaths in many of the same areas that Delfina affected.|$|E

However, soon after his election, Mutharika experienced tensions with Muluzi after implementing an anti-corruption program, which distracted the government from addressing the nation's food and HIV/AIDS-related crises. Despite these obstacles, Mutharika successfully developed a National AIDS Policy and appointed a Principal Secretary for HIV/AIDS during his presidency.|$|E

5|$|In April 1931, Siamese King Prajadhipok and Queen Rambai Barni {{traveled}} from Bangkok to Ophir Hall (currently Reid Hall of Manhattanville College).

5|$|In October 1918, with victory near, Downes {{was confronted}} by his most serious medical crisis. Damascus {{contained}} over 3,000 sick and wounded Turkish soldiers, {{many of them in}} appalling condition. Downes appointed the DADMS of the Australian Mounted Division, Major W. Evans, as Principal Medical Officer of Damascus, and gave him orders to organise the medical arrangements, bury the dead and provide care for the living. The task was made more difficult by the poor communications and transport shortages, which hampered the delivery of supplies and evacuation of the hospitals; by shortages of medical units; and by the actions of Lieutenant Colonel T. E. Lawrence, who was more concerned with establishing the political authority of Hussein bin Ali, Sharif of Mecca over Damascus. At this point the Desert Mounted Corps itself began to experience epidemic diseases, particularly of bronchopneumonia, cholera <b>and</b> <b>malaria,</b> putting the medical services under enormous pressure. Through extraordinary measures, including the diversion of lighthorsemen and motor vehicles to medical units, Downes managed to evacuate the sick to Beirut, and the crisis abated.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} twentieth century, before antibiotics, {{patients}} with tertiary syphilis were intentionally infected with malaria to induce a fever; this was called malariotherapy. In 1917, Julius Wagner-Jauregg, a Viennese psychiatrist, began to treat neurosyphilitics with induced Plasmodium vivax malaria. Three or four bouts of fever were enough to kill the temperature-sensitive syphilis bacteria (Spirochaeta pallida also known as Treponema pallidum). P. vivax infections were then terminated by quinine. By accurately controlling the fever with quinine, the effects of both syphilis <b>and</b> <b>malaria</b> could be minimized. While about 15% of patients died from malaria, this was preferable to the almost-certain death from syphilis. Therapeutic malaria opened up a wide field of chemotherapeutic research and was practised until 1950. Wagner-Jauregg was awarded the 1927 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for his discovery of the therapeutic value of malaria inoculation {{in the treatment of}} dementia paralytica.|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: During {{the period}} of 1996 - 1999, we prospectively {{monitored}} 243 Javanese adults and children after arriving in Papua, Indonesia, and microscopically documented each new case of malaria by active surveillance. METHODS: In a randomized, open-label, comparative malaria treatment trial, 72 adults and 50 children received chloroquine for each incident case of <b>malaria,</b> <b>and</b> 74 adults and 47 children received mefloquine. RESULTS: Among 975 primary treatment courses, the cumulative 28 -day curative efficacies were 26 % and 82 % for chloroquine against Plasmodium falciparum <b>malaria</b> <b>and</b> Plasmodium vivax <b>malaria,</b> respectively. Mefloquine cure rates were far superior (96 % against P. falciparum <b>malaria</b> <b>and</b> 99. 6 % against P. vivax malaria). CONCLUSIONS: Mefloquine is a useful alternative treatment for P. vivax <b>malaria</b> <b>and</b> P. falciparum <b>malaria</b> {{in areas such as}} Papua, where chloroquine is still recommended as the first-line therapeutic agent...|$|R

5|$|The Spanish {{established}} colonial settlements {{to extend}} their power over the surrounding territory, and to serve as administrative centres. They preferred to locate these towns in areas with dense native populations, or close to easily exploitable mineral wealth. Many Spanish towns were founded close to pre-Columbian centres of population. Trujillo was founded near the native settlement of Guaimura, and Comayagua was founded upon a pre-existing town of the same name. In {{the first half of}} the 16th century, towns were abandoned or moved for a variety of reasons, including native attacks, harsh conditions, and the spread of Old World diseases such as smallpox, measles, typhoid, yellow fever, <b>and</b> <b>malaria.</b> In many cases, towns were moved for purely political reasons owing to infighting between Spanish factions, with those currently in power seeking to undermine the work of those who had come before them. The frequent relocation of colonial towns and the reallocation of encomiendas served to prolong political instability, and delay the progress of the conquest.|$|E
25|$|After {{retiring}} from the MPAA in 2004, Valenti became the first President of Friends of the Global Fight Against AIDS, Tuberculosis, <b>and</b> <b>Malaria,</b> an organization founded by philanthropists Edward W.

40|$|To date, {{there have}} been {{conflicting}} reports concerning the clinical significance of nitric oxide (NO) in Plasmodium falciparum malaria. Some authors have proposed that NO contributes {{to the development of}} severe <b>and</b> complicated <b>malaria,</b> while others have argued that NO has a protective role. To investigate these apparently contradictory reports, reverse transcription-coupled PCR was used to study inducible NO synthase (iNOS) in whole-blood RNA samples from patients with severe <b>and</b> complicated <b>malaria</b> or uncomplicated <b>malaria</b> <b>and</b> from healthy donors. This work produced three principal findings. First, samples of patients with severe <b>and</b> complicated <b>malaria</b> were variably positive, with weak to moderate intensity. Markedly higher iNOS RNA levels were observed in samples of patients with uncomplicated malaria than in patients with severe <b>and</b> complicated <b>malaria.</b> Samples of healthy donors were uniformly negative. Second, since we initially demonstrated iNOS expression in whole-blood RNA samples, we extended our investigations to individual blood cells such as monocytes, lymphocytes, neutrophils, and platelets to identify the cellular source of iNOS. We found that iNOS was expressed predominantly in monocytes. Third, retrospective statistical analysis of monocyte counts clearly demonstrated that patients with uncomplicated malaria had higher monocyte counts at the time of presentation than patients with severe <b>and</b> complicated <b>malaria.</b> Taken together, our findings give room to the interpretation that NO may have a beneficial rather than a deleterious role in falciparum malaria...|$|R
