40|$|Background: Non-removable knee-high {{devices are}} the gold {{standard}} to treat diabetic foot ulcers located on the plantar forefoot, but they immobilize the ankle, which restricts daily life activities and has negative effects on joint functioning. Objective: To investigate the feasibility of <b>sealing</b> <b>a</b> therapeutic <b>shoe</b> to off-load and heal diabetic forefoot ulcers. Design: A case series of seven men with type 2 diabetes and a metatarsal head ulcer were prescribed therapeutic shoes and custom-made insoles. The <b>shoe</b> was <b>sealed</b> with <b>a</b> plastic band. Off-loading was assessed with the F-scan pressure measurement system. Adherence to wearing the shoe was assessed with a temperature sensor and by documenting {{the status of the}} seal. Results: The off-loading was effective and all ulcers healed. Median time to healing was 56 days (range 8 - 160). Complications were secondary ulcer (n =  1) and plantar hematoma (n =  1). Five of seven participants did not disturb the <b>seal.</b> Conclusions: <b>Sealing</b> <b>a</b> therapeutic <b>shoe</b> is a feasible way to off-load and heal forefoot ulcers. A controlled trial is needed to compare the effectiveness and safety of <b>a</b> <b>sealed</b> <b>shoe</b> to other non-removable devices...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{develops}} {{an implicit}} integration scheme for transient rotor dynamic rub prediction {{and includes a}} correlation study with actual test results. A Nordsieck-like numerical integration scheme is applied directly to the second-order equations of motion. The assumption that forces and torques on the rotor are functions of {{the position and velocity}} at the point of application and its nearest neighbor is made {{in order to make the}} computational time proportional to the number of elements in the rotor dynamics model rather than the cube of the number. The test rig consists of a turbine driven, flexible shaft supported by squeeze film dampers. The blade loss event occurs due to collision of a balance bolt on one of the disks with a high speed plunger. The rotor is seen to spiral outward and contact against a stationary assemblage of <b>seal</b> <b>shoes...</b>|$|R

The seal-engaging object has <b>a</b> <b>sealing</b> surface, wherein, when the seal-engaging object is selectively engaged with the seal-bearing object, the sealing surface of the seal-engaging object engages the sealing surface of the seal, and the seal is compressed between the seal-bearing object and the seal-engaging object such {{that at least one}} shaded channel surface engages the sealing surface of the seal-engaging object...|$|R
