2500|$|Davey Wreden, 22 {{years old}} at the time of the modification's release, was {{inspired}} to create The Stanley Parable about three years prior, after considering the typical storytelling narratives within video games, and thought of what would happen if the player would go against that narration; Wreden also saw this as a means towards his planned career as a game developer. As a video game player, Wreden has found that most major triple-A titles at the time make numerous assumptions about the player's experience and fitting that within the game, and don't provide answers for [...] "what if" [...] questions that the player may consider. Wreden considered that more recent games with more engaging or thought-provoking stories, including the Metal Gear Solid series, Half-Life 2, Portal, Braid, and BioShock, started to approach this void, giving reason for the player to stop <b>and</b> <b>think</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> narration instead of simply going through the motions. Though his initial intent was a personal project simply to try to make such a game that asked the questions about why people play video games, he found that there were other gamers that had been considering the same type of questions. He then set out to make a game that would be the subject of discussion for players after they completed it. According to Wreden, his design document for the game was [...] "Mess with the player's head in every way possible, throwing them off-guard, or pretending there's an answer and then kinda whisking it away from in front of them." ...|$|E

60|$|In {{the first}} place, because first {{in order of}} realisation, there is its value as a mental bouleversement, a {{revolution}} in ideas, a sort of moral and intellectual cold shower-bath, a nervous shock to the system generally.

It is good for the ordinary man to get thus unceremoniously upset. Take the average young intelligence of the London streets, with its glib ideas already formed from supply and demand in a civilised country, where soil is appropriated, and classes distinct, and commodities drop as it were from the clouds upon the middle-class breakfast-table--take such an intelligence, self-satisfied and empty, and place its possessor all at once in a new environment, where everything material, mental, and moral seems topsy-turvy, where life is real and morals are rudimentary--and unless he is a very particular fool indeed, what a lot you must really give that blithe new-comer to turn over <b>and</b> <b>think</b> <b>about!</b> <b>The</b> sun that shifts now north, now south of him; the seasons that go by fours instead of twos; the trees that blossom and bear fruit from January to December, with no apparent regard for the calendar months as by law established; the black, brown, or yellow people, who know not his creed or his social code; the castes and cross-divisions that puzzle and surprise him; the pride and the scruples, deeper than those of civilised life, but that nevertheless run counter to his own; the economic conditions that defy his preconceptions; the virtues and the vices that equally rub him up the wrong way--all these things are highly conducive to the production of that first substratum of philosophic thinking, a Socratic attitude of supreme ignorance, a pure Cartesian frame of universal doubt.|$|E
