50|$|After {{nine years}} without a {{properly}} released album, Bilal made a comeback on 14 September 2010 with <b>Airtight's</b> Revenge, a sophomore LP released under independent record label Plug Research. Bilal describes the album as a retrospective album: an album that explores his experiences and things that he's learned since his last release. An experimental album, <b>Airtight's</b> Revenge blends jazz, hip-hop, electronic, rock, soul, and blues into one raw, genuine collection of music.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Airtight's</b> Revenge is {{the second}} studio album by American {{recording}} artist Bilal, released September 6, 2010, on independent record label Plug Research. Production for the album took place during 2007 to 2010 and was handled by Bilal, Steve McKie, Nottz, Shafiq Husayn, Conley [...] "Tone" [...] Whitfield, and 88-Keys. The follow-up to his debut album 1st Born Second (2001), it was conceived following the shelving of Bilal's Love for Sale project in 2004 and conflicts with his former label Interscope Records. <b>Airtight's</b> Revenge is a neo soul album with elements of jazz, funk, and psychedelic rock.|$|R

5|$|With the {{invention}} of the <b>airtight</b> pad, and as key technology improved and more keys were added to woodwinds, the need for clarinets in multiple keys was reduced. However, the use of multiple instruments in different keys persisted, with the three instruments in C, B, and A all used as specified by the composer.|$|E
5|$|Although {{ytterbium}} {{is fairly}} stable chemically, it {{is stored in}} <b>airtight</b> containers and in an inert atmosphere such as a nitrogen-filled dry box {{to protect it from}} air and moisture. All compounds of ytterbium are treated as highly toxic, although studies appear to indicate that the danger is minimal. However, ytterbium compounds cause irritation to human skin and eyes, and some might be teratogenic. Metallic ytterbium dust can spontaneously combust, and the resulting fumes are hazardous. Ytterbium fires cannot be extinguished using water, and only dry chemical class D fire extinguishers can extinguish the fires.|$|E
5|$|Andr√©e gave a glowingly optimistic {{account of}} {{the ease with which}} these {{requirements}} could be met. Larger balloons had been constructed in France, he claimed, and more <b>airtight,</b> too. Some French balloons had remained hydrogen-filled for over a year without appreciable loss of buoyancy. As for the hydrogen, filling the balloon at the launch site could easily be done with the help of mobile hydrogen manufacturing units; for the steering he referred to his own drag-rope experiments with the Svea, stating that a deviation of 27degrees from the wind direction could be routinely achieved.|$|E

These paper-based, bomb-carrying hot air balloons were used in a failed attempt to cause havoc on American soil. Local high school girls made these fire balloons out of Mino washi (a thin but strong Japanese paper) and konnyaku paste. Originally, rubberized silk was used to help these bombs use the newly discovered jet stream to traverse the Pacific Ocean, but Gifu's paper was found to be both stronger, lighter, and more <b>airtight.</b>|$|E
5|$|Meibomian glands, in the eyelids, secrete {{a form of}} sebum called meibum {{onto the}} eye, that slows the {{evaporation}} of tears. It also serves to create an <b>airtight</b> seal when the eyes are closed and its lipid quality also prevents the eyelids from sticking together. The meibomian glands are also known as tarsal glands, Zeis glands and palpebral glands. They attach directly to the follicles of the eyelashes, which are arranged vertically within the tarsal plates of the eyelids.|$|E

At that point, the shuttle fired its downward steering jets and moved the shuttle toward the docking module. Once the two spacecraft were locked together, the docking ring on the Orbiter Docking System retracted, {{and a series of}} hooks and latches were engaged to ensure an <b>airtight</b> seal between the two spacecraft.|$|E

The {{song was}} produced by the singer, along with Steve McKie, from his album <b>Airtight's</b> Revenge as well as Robert Glasper's Double-Booked. [...] The song was nominated at the 52nd Grammy Awards for Best Urban/Alternative Performance.|$|R
5000|$|The album debuted {{at number}} 106 on the US Billboard 200 chart, selling 4,600 copies {{in its first}} week. Although it charted modestly, <b>Airtight's</b> Revenge was well {{received}} by music critics upon its release. PopMatters ranked the album number 61 in its year-end list of best albums for 2010, calling it a [...] "wildly inventive, wildly enjoyable album".|$|R
5000|$|Bilal {{worked on}} the album for three years, {{according}} to an interview with The Root in September 2010. Bilal said of <b>Airtight's</b> Revenge: [...] "The concept beyond this album was really just to write short stories and dark tales of life in general. I used a lot and drew a lot from my own life and my own experiences, but I also {{took a lot of}} things from fiction and tried to make certain statements, from a love standpoint." [...] Bilal said that his experiences with his leaked, unreleased album Love for Sale and the ensuing conflict with his then-record label Interscope led him to the [...] "dark underworld" [...] storytelling showcased in <b>Airtight's</b> Revenge. The track [...] "Little One" [...] references Bilal's eldest son's autism. The album features Bilal's famous falsetto and Afro-futuristic sound. The album was released earlier in the United Kingdom on September 6, 2010.|$|R
5|$|Haylage, {{also known}} as Round bale silage is a term for grass sealed in <b>airtight</b> plastic bags, a form of forage that is {{frequently}} fed in the United Kingdom and continental Europe, but is not often seen in the United States. Because haylage {{is a type of}} silage, hay stored in this fashion must remain completely sealed in plastic, as any holes or tears can stop the preservation properties of fermentation and lead to mold or spoilage. Rodents chewing through the plastic can also spoil the hay introducing contamination to the bale. If a rodent dies inside the plastic, the subsequent botulism toxins released can contaminate the entire bale.|$|E
5|$|Carpet beetles {{are members}} of the family Dermestidae, and while the adult beetles feed on nectar and pollen, the larvae are {{destructive}} pests in homes, warehouses and museums. They feed on animal products including wool, silk, leather, fur, the bristles of hair brushes, pet hair, feathers and museum specimens. They tend to infest hidden locations and may feed on larger areas of fabrics than do clothes moths, leaving behind specks of excrement and brown, hollow, bristly-looking cast skins. Management of infestations is difficult and is based on exclusion and sanitation where possible, resorting to pesticides when necessary. The beetles can fly in from outdoors and the larvae can survive on lint fragments, dust and inside the bags of vacuum cleaners. In warehouses and museums, sticky traps baited with suitable pheromones can be used to identify problems, and heating, freezing, spraying the surface with insecticide and fumigation will kill the insects when suitably applied. Susceptible items can be protected from attack by keeping them in clean <b>airtight</b> containers.|$|E
5|$|The larvae {{of clothes}} moths (mainly Tineola bisselliella and Tinea pellionella) feed on fabrics and carpets, {{particularly}} those that are stored or soiled. The adult females lay batches of eggs on natural fibres, including wool, silk and fur, as well as cotton and linen in blends. The developing larvae spin protective webbing and chew into the fabric, creating holes and specks of excrement. Damage is often concentrated in concealed locations, under collars and near seams of clothing, in folds and crevices in upholstery and round the edges of carpets as well as under furniture. Methods of control include using <b>airtight</b> containers for storage, periodic laundering of garments, trapping, freezing, heating {{and the use of}} chemicals; mothballs contain volatile insect repellents such as 1,4-Dichlorobenzene which deter adults, but to kill the larvae, permethrin, pyrethroids or other insecticides may need to be used.|$|E
5|$|A Love Surreal explores {{different}} stages of love in a cycle of slow-burning songs that Bilal deliberately wrote for female listeners. Its songs eschew the personal and societal themes of <b>Airtight's</b> Revenge in favor of upbeat songs about cultivating a romance and meditative laments on its dissolution. Bilal {{wanted to make the}} album sound multidimensional and drew on the surrealist art of Salvador Dal√≠ for inspiration.|$|R
50|$|The Little One Tour is {{a concert}} tour by American R&B/jazz vocalist, Bilal, {{in support of}} his album <b>Airtight's</b> Revenge. The trek kicked off in February 2011, with shows {{scheduled}} throughout America and Europe ending on September 16. On June 18, the singer headlined along with other acts as part of the Stockholm Jazz Festival. and performed 2 shows in South Africa in August.|$|R

5|$|The {{next major}} {{development}} {{in the history of}} clarinet was the invention of the modern pad. Because early clarinets used felt pads to cover the tone holes, they leaked air. This required pad-covered holes to be kept to a minimum, restricting the number of notes the clarinet could play with good tone. In 1812, Iwan M√ºller, a Baltic German community-born clarinetist and inventor, developed a new type of pad that was covered in leather or fish bladder. It was <b>airtight</b> and let makers increase the number of pad-covered holes. M√ºller designed a new type of clarinet with seven finger holes and thirteen keys. This allowed the instrument to play in any key with near-equal ease. Over the course of the 19th-century makers made many enhancements to M√ºller's clarinet, such as the Albert system and the Baermann system, all keeping the same basic design. Modern instruments may also have cork or synthetic pads.|$|E
5|$|The soup {{has even}} {{played a role}} in the Soviet space program. In March 1961, as part of a {{communications}} equipment test, a pre-recorded recipe for borscht was broadcast from the Korabl-Sputnik 4 spacecraft. The craft, carrying animals and a mannequin, had been launched into low Earth orbit in preparation for manned space flights. Actual borscht eventually made its way into outer space as space food for Soviet and, later, Russian cosmonauts. Originally, a pur√©ed version of borscht was supplied in tubes. All ingredients for the space borscht (which include beef, beetroots, cabbage, potatoes, carrots, onions, parsley root and tomato paste) were cooked separately, then combined one by one in strictly controlled order, sterilized, packed into tubes, sealed <b>airtight</b> and autoclaved. In the 1970s, the tubes were replaced with packages of rehydratable freeze-dried borscht with regular-size bits of cooked vegetables.|$|E
5|$|When collected, {{the skin}} of the cap is left intact, and dirt is brushed off the surface. Pores are left unless old and soft. Boletus aereus is {{especially}} suited for drying, a process which enhances its flavour and aroma. Like other boletes, the mushrooms can be dried by being sliced and strung separately on twine, then hung close to the ceiling of a kitchen. Alternatively, the mushrooms can be dried by cleaning with a brush (washing is not recommended), and then placed in a wicker basket or bamboo steamer on top of a boiler or hot water tank. Once dry, they are kept in an <b>airtight</b> jar. They are easily reconstituted by soaking in hot, but not boiling, water for about twenty minutes; the water is infused with the mushroom aroma and can be used as stock in subsequent cooking. When dried, a small amount of the mushroom can improve the taste of less flavoursome fungi-based dishes.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Airtight's</b> Revenge {{received}} widespread acclaim from critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to {{reviews from}} mainstream publications, the album received an average score of 87, based on nine reviews. AllMusic writer Andy Kellman called it [...] "one heavy, messy, dynamite album ‚Äî {{one that could}} take a decade to be fully processed". Tyler Lewis of PopMatters cited the album as [...] "a generation-defining masterwork of unflinching vision" [...] and wrote that it is [...] "all about texture and musicality. Songs more than shout or intimate their ideas, they envelop you fully, so you feel {{the full weight of}} what it is Bilal is talking about". Los Angeles Times journalist Jeff Weiss noted its [...] "formless floating funk" [...] and praised Bilal as [...] "ludicrously soulful and endearingly experimental", calling the album [...] "a soothing anodyne to the often over-processed come-ons that pass for contemporary R&B". The Philadelphia Inquirers A.D. Amorosi stated, [...] "Bilal - the vocalist - opens the valves and bleats, glides, coos, and cajoles like Coltrane at his freest". The A.V. Clubs Nathan Rabin perceived a [...] "brooding, airless intensity" [...] and praised its [...] "claustrophobic introspection and soul-searching". Sputnikmusic's Nick Butler said that, [...] "musically, there are dozens of neo-soul records in the past three or four years that reach far beyond the limits of most of <b>Airtight's</b> Revenge ... but nobody is writing or delivering lyrics like this. Emotionally, it is so revealing that it gets difficult to listen to". In a year-end article on overlooked albums in 2010, Edna Gundersen of USA Today described <b>Airtight's</b> Revenge a [...] "buried jewel that really deserved a wider audience", commenting that [...] "It's personal, idiosyncratic, complex, dense, sophisticated and messy, a thoroughly contemporary soul record with a defiant indie-rock sensibility, which is why it never found a home on radio".|$|R
5|$|A Love Surreal {{comprises}} a {{cycle of}} slow-burning songs about different stages of love, including infatuation, seduction, romance, estrangement, longing, renewal, and existential peace. Bilal's intimate lyrics address love's ephemeral nature and how to sustain happiness. It veers between danceable, upbeat songs about cultivating a new romance and bluesy, meditative songs about how romances dissolve. In contrast to <b>Airtight's</b> Revenge, A Love Surreal deals more with feelings of lust and flirting rather than personal and societal issues.|$|R
50|$|With {{the release}} of A Love Surreal, Bilal {{immediately}} achieved commercial success, debuting at No. 1 on iTunes' R&B Chart. On Billboard, the album debuted at No. 17 on the Independent Albums Chart, No. 19 on the R&B Albums Chart, and No. 103 on the Billboard 200, ranking higher than its predecessor, <b>Airtight's</b> Revenge. The album also received numerous high reviews, including an 8/10 from SPIN Magazine, a 4.5/5 stars from Allmusic, and a 4/4 stars from USA Today.|$|R
5|$|After another full {{examination}} in 1911, with {{comparisons to}} the Ashmolean head, archaeologists dismissed the Ashmolean head as a fake. The absence of firm {{evidence of the}} whereabouts of Cromwell's head between 1684 and 1787 made them wary about declaring the head genuine. They concluded their study unable to verify or refute the head's identity. The uncertainty increased public demand for a full scientific examination, and Wilkinson reluctantly allowed the head to be taken for examination by the eugenicist Karl Pearson and the anthropologist Geoffrey Morant. Their 109-page report {{concluded that there was}} a ‚Äúmoral certainty‚Äù that the Wilkinson head was that of Oliver Cromwell. Horace Wilkinson died in 1957, bequeathing the head to his son, also called Horace. Horace Wilkinson wished to organise a proper burial for the head rather than a public display, so he contacted Sidney Sussex College, which welcomed the burial. There it was interred on 25 March 1960, in a secret location near the antechapel, preserved in the oak box in which the Wilkinson family had kept the head since 1815. The box was placed into an <b>airtight</b> container and buried with only a few witnesses, including family and representatives of the college. The secret burial was not announced until October 1962.|$|E
5|$|Another {{close friend}} of SpongeBob is Sandy Cheeks, a {{squirrel}} from Texas. She is a scientist and an expert in karate. She lives in an oak tree entrapped in a clear glass dome locked by an <b>airtight,</b> hand-turned seal. When outside of her dwelling, she wears an astronaut-like suit because she cannot breathe underwater. Mr. Krabs, a miserly crab obsessed with money, {{is the owner of}} the Krusty Krab restaurant and SpongeBob's boss. Krabs has a teenage whale daughter named Pearl, whom he values equally with his riches. His rival, Plankton, is a small green copepod who owns a low-rank fast-food restaurant called the Chum Bucket, located {{across the street from the}} Krusty Krab. Plankton spends most of his time planning to steal the secret recipe for Mr. Krabs's popular Krabby Patty burgers, so as to gain the upper hand and put the Krusty Krab out of business. The majority of Plankton's plans come from his intelligent yet sarcastic computer wife Karen, who is more competent and less conceited than him. When SpongeBob is not working at the Krusty Krab, he can often be found at Mrs. Puff's boating school (the underwater equivalent of a driver's education course). SpongeBob is perpetually unable to pass Mrs. Puff's exams, which is why he almost always walks around town.|$|E
5|$|The {{mouthpiece}} {{and reed}} {{are surrounded by}} the player's lips, which put light, even pressure on the reed and form an <b>airtight</b> seal. Air is blown past the reed and down the instrument. In {{the same way a}} flag flaps in the breeze, the air rushing past the reed causes it to vibrate. As air pressure from the mouth increases, the amount the reed vibrates increases until the reed hits the mouthpiece. At this point the reed stays pressed against the mouthpiece until either the springiness of the reed forces it to open or a returning pressure wave 'bumps' into the reed and opens it. Each time the reed opens, a puff of air goes through the gap, after which the reed swings shut again. When played loudly, the reed can spend up to 50% of the time shut. The 'puff of air' or compression wave (around 3% greater pressure than the surrounding air) travels down the cylindrical tube and escapes {{at the point where the}} tube opens out. This is either at the closest open hole or at the end of the tube (see diagram: image 1).|$|E
5|$|A Love Surreal is {{the third}} studio album by American neo soul singer Bilal, {{released}} on February 26, 2013, by eOne. He recorded the album for five months at various studios {{with most of the}} recording crew from his 2010 album <b>Airtight's</b> Revenge, including producer Shafiq Husayn, drummer Steve McKie, and pianist Robert Glasper. Bilal wrote and produced most of the album, which he titled in reference to his unreleased album Love for Sale and John Coltrane's 1965 album A Love Supreme.|$|R
500|$|After {{preparing}} {{it on his}} Logic recording software, Bilal recorded A Love Surreal in five months, {{which he}} said was the fastest he had recorded an album. Recording sessions for the album took place at Brooklyn Recording and Breeding Grounds Studio in Brooklyn, New York; Lalabelle Music and Lamont Caldwell's Bedroom in Clifton, New Jersey; Pine Studios in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania; and Prime Rib Productions and The Krusty Lab in Los Angeles, California. He recorded his vocals at a beach-side studio in Los Angeles. Bilal originally intended to record A Love Surreal as an extended play {{when he entered the}} studio, but, according to him, [...] "it was just so easy that the music started to flow ... by the fifth day we were like 'damn, we made a mistake and wrote five extra songs". He worked with most of the recording crew from <b>Airtight's</b> Revenge and produced 10 of the album's 14 songs. Bilal viewed that his role as a producer had progressed from his 2001 debut 1st Born Second to A Love Surreal, which he felt best conveyed his vision for the album's sound.|$|R
5000|$|Since its {{original}} popularity, neo soul has been expanded and diversified musically through {{the works of}} both African-American and international artists. The more popular neo soul artists in recent years are John Legend, Anthony Hamilton, Jill Scott, Maxwell, Amy Winehouse, Chrisette Michele, Leela James, and Raheem DeVaughn. DeVaughn has described himself as an [...] "R&B Hippy Neo-Soul Rock Star", viewing it as a reference to his eclectic musical style. In its 2010 issue on critical moments in popular music, Spin cited D'Angelo's Voodoo and its success as {{a turning point for}} neo soul: [...] "D'Angelo's pastiche of funk, carnal ache, and high-minded, Afrocentric rhetoric stands as neo-soul's crowning achievement. So unsurpassable that it'd be eight years before we'd hear from Erykah Badu and Maxwell again, while Hill and D'Angelo remain missing. But Alicia Keys, John Legend, and Cee-Lo picked up D's mantle and ran with it". Evan Rytlewski of The A.V. Club discerns [...] "a line of revelatory, late-period neo-soul albums" [...] with the releases of Maxwell's BLACKsummers'night (2009), Badu's New Amerykah Part Two (Return of the Ankh) (2010), Bilal's <b>Airtight's</b> Revenge (2010), and Frank Ocean's Channel Orange (2012).|$|R
