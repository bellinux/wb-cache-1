40|$|Abstract—Reservoir {{computing}} (RC) {{is a novel}} {{approach to}} time series prediction using recurrent neural networks. In RC, an input signal perturbs the intrinsic dynamics of a medium called a reservoir. A readout layer is then trained to reconstruct a target output from the reservoir’s state. The multitude of RC architectures and evaluation metrics poses a challenge to both practitioners and theorists who study the task-solving performance and computational power of RC. In addition, in contrast to traditional computation models, the reservoir is a dynamical system in which computation and memory are inseparable, and therefore hard to analyze. Here, we compare echo state networks (ESN), a popular RC architecture, with tapped-delay lines (DL) and nonlinear <b>autoregressive</b> exogenous (NARX) <b>networks,</b> which we use to model systems with limited computation and limited memory respectively. We compare {{the performance of the}} three sys-tems while computing three common benchmark time series: Hénon Map, NARMA 10, and NARMA 20. We find that the role of the reservoir in the reservoir computing paradigm goes beyond providing a memory of the past inputs.
