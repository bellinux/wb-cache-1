2500|$|Li's {{business}} empire has presence {{around the}} world, including China. Li {{came under attack}} from Global Times in early 2015, when his companies put out word that it was considering selling prime Shanghai and Beijing properties. It became apparent that Li aimed at re-weighting his <b>asset</b> <b>portfolio</b> to more stable and transparent markets in the West. Concerted attacks ensued and went into a crescendo as China's economy slowed down dramatically in the second half, and the central government sought a way to stem the capital outflows. Specific reproaches were that his asset disposals were [...] "an act of ingratitude" [...] and [...] "immoral at such a sensitive juncture". Security Times, a People's Daily publication, estimated that Li has sold at least 73.8billion yuan worth of assets since 2014. Li's holding companies denied divesting in China, saying that its asset disposals were being undertaken in the ordinary course of business. The attacks stopped abruptly several weeks later, when editorials in official publications such as People's Daily, Beijing Youth Daily took a neutral stance in unison.|$|E

40|$|Is there {{evidence}} that households adjust their <b>asset</b> <b>portfolios</b> {{just prior to}} retirement {{in response to a}} means-tested public pension? We address this question by estimating a system of asset equations constrained to add up to net worth. We find little {{evidence that}} in 2006 healthy households or couples responded to the incentives embedded in the means test determining pension eligibility by reallocating their assets. While there are some significant differences in <b>asset</b> <b>portfolios</b> associated with being near the income threshold, being of pensionable age, and being in poor health these differences are often only marginally significant, are not robust across time, and are not clearly consistent with the incentives inherent in the pension eligibility rules. In 2006, any behavioral response to the means test seems to occur among single pensioners in poor health. Comparison with 2002 results suggests the incentives to reallocate assets may have weakened over time. <b>asset</b> <b>portfolios,</b> means testing, public pension, household wealth...|$|R

The numerical results show that the presence of health spending risk drives households to shift their portfolios from risky equities to safer assets and works to enhance the demand for annuities due to their increasing-with-age superiority over bonds as a hedge against life-contingent health spending as well as longevity risks. The safe and higher-return annuities in turn provide a greater leverage for equity investment in the remaining <b>asset</b> <b>portfolios.</b> This health-spending-uncertainty-enhanced optimal annuitization result is compatible with the broader theory about liquidity constraints and precautionary savings. ...|$|R

For plausible parameter values, the model explains the fact that typical investors hold most of their wealth in domestic <b>assets</b> (<b>portfolio</b> home bias). In the model, the current account balance (change in net foreign assets) is mainly driven by fluctuations in equity prices; the current account is predicted to be highly volatile and to exhibit low serial correlation; changes in a country's foreign equity assets and liabilities are predicted to be highly positively correlated. The paper constructs current account series that include external capital gains/losses, for 17 OECD economies. The behaviour of those series confirms the theoretical predictions. consumption and portfolio home bias; current account; international portfolio holdings...|$|R
