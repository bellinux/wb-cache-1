25|$|A Dutch door or stable door {{consists}} of two halves. The top half operates independently from the bottom half. A variant exists in which opening the top part separately is possible, but because the lower part has <b>a</b> <b>lip</b> on the inside, closing the top part, while leaving the lower part open, is not.|$|E

25|$|In 1793, François Chopart {{performed}} operative procedure on <b>a</b> <b>lip</b> using a flap {{from the}} neck. In 1814, Joseph Carpue successfully performed operative procedure on a British military {{officer who had}} lost his nose to the toxic effects of mercury treatments. In 1818, German surgeon Carl Ferdinand von Graefe published his major work entitled Rhinoplastik. Von Graefe modified the Italian method using a free skin graft from the arm instead of the original delayed pedicle flap.|$|E
25|$|Trills, though {{generally}} simple with valves, {{are difficult}} on the slide trombone. Trills {{tend to be}} easiest and most effective higher in the harmonic series because the distance between notes is much smaller and slide movement is minimal. For example, a trill on B3/C4 is virtually impossible as the slide must move two positions (either 1st-to-3rd or 5th-to-3rd), however at an octave higher (B4/C5) the notes can both be achieved in 1st position as <b>a</b> <b>lip</b> trill. Thus, the most convincing trills tend to be above the first octave {{and a half of}} the tenor's range. Trills are most commonly found in early Baroque and Classical music for the trombone as a means of ornamentation, however, some more modern pieces will call for trills as well.|$|E
25|$|The saltasaurids, one of {{the several}} {{titanosaur}} families, are recognized by the convexities in certain caudal vertebrae and the markings on their coracoid bones. All saltasaurids have thirty-five or fewer caudal vertebrae, {{each of which is}} convex on both sides of its centrum, and the one closest to the tail is shorter than the others. Their coracoid bones have rectangular margins on the anteroventral side, as well as <b>a</b> <b>lip</b> where they meet the infraglenoid. The Opisthocoelicaudiinae, a subfamily of the saltasaurids, are unique in that they lack phalanges in their forelimbs. Although Saltasaurus is known to possess dorsal osteoderms, scutes have not been discovered in all saltasaurids, and it is unclear when and where the evolution of osteoderms occurred in saltasaurids and titanosaurs in general.|$|E

25|$|The shell can {{be found}} in various colour variants, but is {{basically}} yellow or white with dark color bands or spots and often a dark bluish grey apex. The shells of juveniles are sharply keeled, however the keel is not present on the final adult whorl. The aperture often has <b>a</b> <b>lip</b> that is light reddish on the inside, and the lip margin is only reflected at columellar side. The umbilicus is narrow and half covered by the reflected columellar margin. The apex has a characteristic size in the eastern Mediterranean when compared with other species, where there are no other Theba species. The umbilicus is also rarely seen in other species. Juveniles of Eobania vermiculata have a considerably larger apex.|$|E
25|$|Evidence of Neolithic {{settlement}} can {{be found}} throughout the county. There are great burial mounds including the portal tombs and dolmens at Owning, Kilmogue-Harristown and Borrismore. There are passage graves at Clomantagh Hill and Knockroe. There were non-megalith single-grave burial tombs, Linkardstown-type Cists, excavated at Jerpoint West. These are late Neolithic and before the single-grave rite of the Bronze Age. A Neolithic house was identified in Granny near Waterford, making it the oldest house in County Kilkenny. The square house consisted of slot-trenches, internal floor surfaces, a hearth and wooden posts at each corner, one of the post-holes was radiocarbon-dated to 3997-3728 BC. A new form of early Neolithic pottery with <b>a</b> <b>lip</b> around {{the inside of the}} rim were found. This Granny pottery is similar to pottery found in the south-east of England.|$|E
25|$|In warm, damp climates, H. aspersa may {{lay eggs}} {{as often as}} five times from February through October, {{depending}} on the weather and region. Mating and egg-laying begin when {{there are at least}} 10 hours of daylight and continue until days begin to get shorter. In the United States, longer hours of sunlight that occur when temperatures are still too cold will affect this schedule, but increasing hours of daylight still stimulate egg laying. If warm enough, the eggs hatch in about 2 weeks, or in 4 weeks if cooler. It takes the baby snails several more days {{to break out of the}} sealed nest and climb to the surface. In a climate similar to southern California's, H. aspersa matures in about 2 years. In central Italy, H. aspersa hatches and emerges from the soil almost exclusively in the autumn. If well fed and not overcrowded, those snails that hatch at the start of the season will reach adult size and form <b>a</b> <b>lip</b> at the edge of their shell by the following June. If the environment is manipulated to get more early hatchlings, the size and number of snails that mature the following year will increase. In South Africa, some H. aspersa mature in 10 months, and under ideal conditions in a laboratory, some have matured in 6 to 8 months. Most of H. aspersa's reproductive activity takes place in the second year of its life.|$|E
50|$|The {{earliest}} excavated Chinese thumb ring {{came from}} the Shang dynasty tomb of Fu Hao (who died circa 1200 BCE). The ring was a slanted cylinder where the front, which contained a groove for holding the bow string, was higher than the back. An excavation of the Marquis of Jin's tomb in Quwo County, Shanxi revealed a Western Zhou jade thumb ring, which had <b>a</b> <b>lipped</b> design but featured taotie decorations similar to the Shang dynasty Fu Hao ring. From the Warring States period through the Han dynasty (475 BCE-220 CE), excavated rings typically had <b>a</b> <b>lipped</b> design with <b>a</b> distinctive spur on the side (there exist several theories about the spur's function). Rings from the Qing dynasty (1644-1911) were round cylinders or D-shaped cylinders.|$|R

Jim points out parkour was used in a chase scene in the 2006 James Bond film Casino Royale. This is the first season premiere to include an internet trend in the cold open.

500|$|Lip {{piercing}} and lip stretching were historically {{found in}} certain tribal cultures in Africa and the Americas. Pierced adornments of the lip, or labrets, were sported by the Tlingit {{as well as}} peoples of Papua New Guinea and the Amazon basin. Aztecs and Mayans also wore labrets, while the Dogon people of Mali and the Nuba of the Nile Valley wore rings. The practice of stretching the lips by piercing them and inserting plates or plugs was found throughout Pre-Columbian Mesoamerica and South America as well as {{among some of the}} tribes of the Pacific Northwest and Africa. In some parts of Malawi, it was quite common for women to adorn their lips with <b>a</b> <b>lip</b> disc called a [...] "pelele" [...] that by means of gradual enlargement from childhood could reach several inches of diameter and would eventually alter the occlusion of the jaw. Such lip stretching is still practiced in some places. Women of the Nilotic Mursi tribe in the Nile Valley wear lip rings on occasion that may reach [...] in diameter.|$|E

Jim asks Pete if he likes the Philadelphia Phillies, but Pete mistakes his reference to mean horses.|$|E
500|$|The {{sequence}} {{was shot}} {{over a period}} of two days. Principal photography on the first day commenced inside a well, which was built by Gregory Melton in approximately four weeks. It measured over forty feet in height, and the base of the well was located in a swimming pool. Nicotero stated that [...] " [...] could open the door, put the zombie actor in there, then close the door. The camera would shoot down." [...] Atop of the well was <b>a</b> <b>lip</b> that measured a height of six feet. Despite putting slime and K-Y Jelly on a board inside of the well, Nicotero and his production team found the particular sequence to be difficult to shoot. [...] "On 'action', we pulled him out, and he slid up and over the lip," [...] Nicotero stated. [...] "It was challenging to get all those pieces to come together on a television schedule." [...] By the time Hilliard was pulled out of the well, producers used a second suit equipped with prosthetic legs and prosthetic body. Various blood bags were inserted in the torso of the suit; each were filled with viscous liquids in a variety of colors. Entrails were lastly added inside the suit, as Nicotero asserted that his team wanted [...] "a gigantic explosion of gore." ...|$|E
