25|$|MacKenzie took {{a radically}} {{different}} approach and was criticised for producing severely down-market programming. MacKenzie introduced features such as nightly editions of 'Topless Darts' (featuring topless women playing darts on a beach), 'The Weather in Norwegian' (with a young, typically blonde and bikini-clad Scandinavian woman presenting weather forecasts in both English and Norwegian), other weather forecasts featuring dwarfs bouncing on trampolines and stock exchange reports presented by Tiffany, a young female presenter who would strip to her underwear <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>read</b> out the latest share prices. A large amount of airtime was given over to tarot card readers and astrologers. L!VE TV's best known character was the News Bunny, a man dressed as a giant rabbit who popped up during news broadcasts to give a thumbs up or a thumbs down to the various news stories to indicate {{whether or not he}} found them interesting or exciting.|$|E
25|$|Robinson {{remained}} in the Seanad for four more years, although at this point {{many of the issues}} she had campaigned for had been tackled. Contraception had been legalised although heavily restricted, women were on juries, and the marriage bar on women in the civil service had been revoked. To the surprise of many, she decided not to seek re-election to the senate in 1989. One year later, however, Labour approached her about running for president in that year's election. She thought she was being asked her legal advice about the type of policy programme party leader Dick Spring was proposing. However, <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>read</b> the briefing notes, she began to realise that the programme was aimed at her. After some consideration, she agreed to become the first Labour nominee for the presidency and the first woman candidate in what was only the second presidential election to be contested by three candidates since 1945.|$|E
500|$|According to Lupton, [...] "On the Pulse of Morning" [...] is Angelou's {{most famous}} poem. Lupton {{has argued that}} [...] "Angelou's {{ultimate}} greatness will be attributed" [...] to the poem, and that Angelou's [...] "theatrical" [...] performance of it, using skills she learned as an actor and speaker, marked {{a return to the}} African-American oral tradition of speakers such as Frederick Douglass, Martin Luther King, Jr. and Malcolm X. British reporter Kate Kellaway compared Angelou's appearance <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>read</b> the poem at Clinton's inauguration with the eight-year-old child in Caged Bird, noting that the coats she wore in both occasions were similar: [...] "She looked magnificent, sternly theatrical with an unsmiling bow mouth. She wore a coat with brass buttons, a strange reminder of the eight-year-old Maya Angelou who stood in a courtroom, terrified {{at the sight of the}} man who had raped her". Gillespie stated regarding Kellaway's observations: [...] "But standing tall on the steps of the Capitol, she was light-years removed from that terrible time, and America was no longer an 'unfriendly place.' Her poem 'On the Pulse of Morning' was a soaring call for peace, justice, and harmony. Capturing the hope embodied in the human spirit, it was a solemn and joyful reminder that all things are possible. She wished us 'Good morning' in her poem, and one felt as if a new day was truly dawning." ...|$|E
