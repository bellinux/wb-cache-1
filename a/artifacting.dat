2500|$|Human Target – The Complete 1st Season was {{released}} as a widescreen three-disc region 1 DVD box set {{as well as}} a two-disc region free Blu-ray version on September 21, 2010. In addition to the 12 episodes of the season, which have an enhanced audio mix, a number of extras are included; several unaired and deleted scenes, an audio commentary by Mark Valley, Chi McBride, Jonathan E. Steinberg and Peter Johnson for the pilot episode and two featurettes; [...] "Human Target: Full Contact Television" [...] and [...] "Human Target: Confidential Informant". The set received a rating of 4.5 out of 5 from Blu-ray.com, with concerns expressed that [...] "squeezing twelve episodes onto two discs takes a bit of a toll" [...] and caused some <b>artifacting.</b> The site also questioned the use of a lossy 640 kbit/s audio track and the small number of special features, calling it [...] "a tad pricey for twelve episodes". By contrast, DVD Verdict said that the DVD's gave [...] "a better-than average offering of supplements".|$|E
50|$|A {{handful of}} {{cartoons}} {{in the first}} two collections and the bonus cartoons on Volume 6 have digital video noise reduction (DVNR) <b>artifacting.</b> The noise reduction process sometimes unintentionally erases or blurs some of the picture on certain scenes of the cartoons, which has caused controversy among some Looney Tunes fans. The most recent collections, however, lack such <b>artifacting.</b> Since August 2007, Warner Bros. Home Video has been quietly reissuing copies of the fourth disc of Volume 2 that lacks <b>artifacting</b> and interlacing, because of numerous complaints by consumers.|$|E

30|$|Minor Attenuation map <b>artifacts</b> {{were found}} in 22 {{patients}} and major <b>artifacts</b> in 16 patients. Minor <b>artifacts</b> were field of view edge <b>artifacts,</b> lung boarder <b>artifacts,</b> small body contour <b>artifacts,</b> respiratory <b>artifacts</b> and trachea <b>artifacts.</b> Major <b>artifacts</b> were body contour <b>artifact</b> with missing dorsal body contour including both lungs (n= 10), left lung (n= 5) and wide expanded areas around breast and chest (n= 1). All FDG-avid malignant mass were not affected by <b>artifacts</b> on visual PET interpretation. SUVmax in PET/MR mammography and whole body PET/MR in group A and B were 8.31 ± 6.31, 6.15 ± 4.20, 4.75 ± 3.70 and 4.70 ± 4.10, respectively. The changes in group A and B was 31.11 % and 14.08 %, respectively. Quantitatively, major μ-map <b>artifacts</b> led to significant SUVmax changes (p< 0.001). No change in diagnosis was caused by μ-map <b>artifacts.</b> Major attenuation map <b>artifacts</b> that occur in a considerable percentage of hybrid PET/MR mammography {{have the potential to}} falsify PET quantification. However, there was no change in clinical diagnosis due to μ-map <b>artifacts.</b>|$|R
50|$|Other <b>artifacts</b> {{found in}} the cave were stone, shell, glass and metal <b>artifacts.</b> Two out of the seven stone <b>artifacts</b> were polished. The glass <b>artifact</b> is {{a portion of a}} blue glass bead. Iron and bronze <b>artifacts</b> were {{found in the}} site. The iron <b>artifacts</b> {{excavated}} were probably used as weapons.|$|R
40|$|Magnetic {{resonance}} (MR) imaging {{is vulnerable}} {{to a variety of}} <b>artifacts,</b> which potentially degrade the perceived quality of MR images and, consequently, may cause inefficient and/or inaccurate diagnosis. In general, these <b>artifacts</b> can be classified as structured or unstructured depending on the correlation of the <b>artifact</b> with the original content. In addition, the <b>artifact</b> can be white or colored depending on the flatness of the frequency spectrum of the <b>artifact.</b> In current MR imaging applications, design choices allow one type of <b>artifact</b> to be traded off with another type of <b>artifact.</b> Hence, to support these design choices, the relative impact of structured versus unstructured or colored versus white <b>artifacts</b> on perceived image quality needs to be known. To this end, we conducted two subjective experiments. Clinical application specialists rated the quality of MR images, distorted with different types of <b>artifacts</b> at various levels of degradation. The results demonstrate that unstructured <b>artifacts</b> deteriorate quality less than structured <b>artifacts,</b> while colored <b>artifacts</b> preserve quality better than white <b>artifacts...</b>|$|R
50|$|In 2010, a YouTube user {{created an}} homage to I am sitting in a room {{entitled}} VIDEO ROOM 1000, in which he uploaded a video of himself speaking text similar to Lucier's original to YouTube, then manually downloaded and re-uploaded it 1,000 times in sequence {{over the course of}} a year, in order to demonstrate the resulting digital <b>artifacting</b> of audio and video analogously to Lucier's original demonstration of analog <b>artifacting</b> of audio.|$|E

50|$|<b>Artifacts</b> {{are found}} in or around anomalies. Players have to use special {{detectors}} to bring <b>artifacts</b> into the visible spectrum, as they are naturally invisible. Every time an Emission occurs, each anomaly field has a chance of creating a new <b>artifact</b> within its wake. These <b>artifacts</b> can be sold, be put into <b>artifact</b> slots that are incorporated into suits that the player can wear and are occasionally given as rewards for services rendered. Primarily, <b>artifacts</b> serve {{as a means to}} enhance the player's abilities, dependent on which <b>artifact</b> the player has put into his <b>artifact</b> slot. Most are modular and can be used in conjunction with other <b>artifacts,</b> or multiple <b>artifacts</b> of the same kind can be used to multiply their effects. Most of these <b>artifacts</b> emit harmful radiation, limiting their usage to short periods of time. Radiation-reducing <b>artifacts</b> can be used to counter this effect.|$|R
50|$|<b>Artifacts</b> are the {{physical}} entities that are deployed on Nodes (ie. Devices and Execution Environments).

40|$|We {{present a}} {{conceptual}} model of design science research <b>artifacts.</b> The model views an <b>artifact</b> at three levels. At the <b>artifact</b> level a selected <b>artifact</b> {{is viewed as}} a combination of material and immaterial aspects and a set of representations hereof. At the design level the selected <b>artifact</b> is viewed through its design in terms of descriptions, models, prototypes etc. At the knowledge level the selected <b>artifact</b> is viewed through ontologies, categories and various types of relevant knowledge. The model is based on descriptions and analysis of existing work about DSR <b>artifacts</b> and on an analysis of a set of designed <b>artifacts...</b>|$|R

50|$|Super 0: This mode {{is based}} out of GRAPHICS 0 (ANTIC 2) and shifts the {{character}} set, background color and text luminance every VBI.

50|$|DIN (Display Interlace): This mode {{shifts the}} Display List every VBI, between ANTIC 4 and ANTIC 2. The {{result is an}} 8x8 {{character}} grid with two colors, overlaid by a 4x8 4-color character grid which adds additional color data, allowing an effective character resolution of 8x8 with 10 colors available. With Graphics 0 <b>artifacting,</b> there are 20 colors perceivable.|$|E
40|$|There {{are many}} {{attempts}} to bridge paper digital gap, new <b>artifacts</b> and tools are being delivered continuously. Many of these <b>artifacts</b> work with paper and cooperate with other <b>artifacts.</b> Despite {{the fact that}} these <b>artifacts</b> are good enough to perform their work, they tend to be dull in exchanging data and cooperating with other <b>artifacts.</b> This causes a problem especially when <b>artifact</b> cooperation is essential. In order to solve this {{we need to have a}} standard for presenting the data used in the <b>artifacts</b> and facilitating communication among <b>artifacts.</b> Paper Digital Classes is a new standard that aims at providing a standard implementation of the <b>artifacts</b> in matters of data exchange and interoperabilit...|$|R
40|$|The {{concept of}} the “IT artifact” plays {{a central role in}} the {{information}} systems research community’s discourse on design science. We pose the alternative {{concept of the}} “IS artifact,” unpacking what has been called the IT <b>artifact</b> into a separate “information artifact,” “technology artifact,” and “social <b>artifact.</b> ” Technology <b>artifacts</b> (such as hardware and software), information <b>artifacts</b> (such as a message), and social <b>artifacts</b> (such as a charitable act) are different kinds of <b>artifacts</b> that together interact in order to form the IS <b>artifact.</b> We illustrate the knowledge value of the IS <b>artifact</b> concept with material from three cases. The result is to restore the idea that the study of design in information systems needs to attend to the design of the entire IS <b>artifact,</b> not just the IT <b>artifact.</b> This result encourages an expansion in the use of design science research methodology to study broader kinds of <b>artifacts...</b>|$|R
40|$|PURPOSE Our {{objective}} was to determine clinically the value of time-of-flight (TOF) information in reducing PET <b>artifacts</b> and improving PET image quality and accuracy in simultaneous TOF PET/MR scanning. METHODS A total 65 patients who underwent a comparative scan in a simultaneous TOF PET/MR scanner were included. TOF and non-TOF PET images were reconstructed, clinically examined, compared and scored. PET imaging <b>artifacts</b> were categorized as large or small implant-related <b>artifacts,</b> as dental implant-related <b>artifacts,</b> and as implant-unrelated <b>artifacts.</b> Differences in image quality, especially those related to (implant) <b>artifacts,</b> were assessed using a scale ranging from 0 (no <b>artifact)</b> to 4 (severe <b>artifact).</b> RESULTS A total of 87 image <b>artifacts</b> were found and evaluated. Four patients had large and eight patients small implant-related <b>artifacts,</b> 27 patients had dental implants/fillings, and 48 patients had implant-unrelated <b>artifacts.</b> The average score was 1. 14 ± 0. 82 for non-TOF PET images and 0. 53 ± 0. 66 for TOF images (p[*]<[*] 0. 01) indicating that <b>artifacts</b> were less noticeable when TOF information was included. CONCLUSION Our study indicates that PET image <b>artifacts</b> are significantly mitigated with integration of TOF information in simultaneous PET/MR. The impact is predominantly seen in patients with significant <b>artifacts</b> due to metal implants...|$|R
5000|$|Composite <b>artifacting,</b> whether used {{intentionally}} or as {{an unwanted}} artifact, reduces the effective horizontal resolution to a minimum of 160 pixels, more for black-on-white or white-on-black text, without changing the vertical resolution. The resulting composite video display with [...] "artifacted" [...] colors was thus sometimes described as a 160×200/16-color [...] "mode", though technically it was a method, not a mode.|$|E
5000|$|However, programmers {{learned that}} this flaw {{could be turned}} into an asset, as {{distinct}} patterns of high-resolution dots would [...] "smear" [...] into consistent areas of solid colors, thus allowing the display of completely new colors. Since these new colors {{are the result of}} cross-color <b>artifacting,</b> they are often called [...] "artifact colors". Both the standard 320&times;200 four-color and the 640&times;200 color-on-black graphics modes could be used with this technique.|$|E
50|$|M-JPEG is an intraframe-only {{compression}} scheme (compared {{with the}} more computationally intensive technique of interframe prediction). Whereas modern interframe video formats, such as MPEG1, MPEG2 and H.264/MPEG-4 AVC, achieve real-world compression ratios of 1:50 or better, M-JPEG's lack of interframe prediction limits its efficiency to 1:20 or lower, depending on the tolerance to spatial <b>artifacting</b> in the compressed output. Because frames are compressed independently of one another, M-JPEG imposes lower processing and memory requirements on hardware devices.|$|E
40|$|<b>Artifacts</b> {{have been}} {{proposed}} as basic building blocks for complex processes that are driven by life-cycle aware data objects. An <b>artifact</b> choreography describes the interplay of several <b>artifacts</b> from which the process “emerges”. By design, an <b>artifact</b> choreography is tightly coupled to the process’ underlying data model which gives rise to complex interactions between <b>artifacts.</b> This paper presents a simple model for these interactions and outlines open challenges in <b>artifact</b> choreographies...|$|R
5000|$|<b>Artifacts</b> also {{received}} a rule change. Before the change, an <b>artifact</b> [...] "shut off" [...] or stopped working while it was tapped, unless it was an <b>artifact</b> creature. After, an <b>artifact</b> remains active while tapped. This was to bring <b>artifacts</b> {{more in line with}} other cards. Some <b>artifacts</b> (like [...] and [...] ) retained the [...] "shut off" [...] aspect, which necessitated explicitly printing that they only worked while untapped.|$|R
30|$|Kirsh [11] takes a {{more global}} approach. According to him, each <b>artifact</b> ecology is {{characterized}} by five elements that mutually constrain each other: 1) <b>artifact</b> species, 2) <b>artifact</b> systems or collections, 3) user groups who select and keep <b>artifacts,</b> 4) practices that users have evolved to work with <b>artifacts</b> and accomplish tasks, and 5) task environments. For Kirsh, <b>artifact</b> ecologies are systems of interdependent artifactual niches which “jointly determine how <b>artifacts</b> are used, when they are used, for what, by whom and how effectively”. These systems are never stable because <b>artifacts,</b> tasks, practices, and users constantly interact and co-evolve. Krippendorff [30] defines an ecology of <b>artifacts</b> as {{the net effect of}} numerous personal decisions concerning the deployment of technology. He distinguishes cooperative, competitive, and independent interactions between two <b>artifact</b> species. Both authors provide explanations for effects of mass production (and advertisement) on individual behavior and vice versa. For example, the greater the prevalence of an <b>artifact</b> is the better users think it is compared with similar <b>artifacts</b> [11].|$|R
50|$|Later demonstrations by enthusiasts have {{increased}} {{the maximum number of}} colors the CGA is known to produce in a single image to approximately a thousand. Aside of <b>artifacting,</b> this technique involves the text mode tweak which quadruples its rows, thus offering the benefit of 16 foreground and 16 background colors. Certain ASCII characters such as U and ‼ are then used to produce the necessary patterns, which result in non-dithered images with an effective resolution of 80&times;100 on a composite monitor.|$|E
50|$|Although all {{cartoons}} on The Looney Tunes Golden Collection: Volume 2 {{are presented}} uncut, {{a handful of}} cartoons in this DVD set feature digital video noise reduction (DVNR) applied artifacting: the noise reduction process unintentionally erases or blurs some of the scenes in the cartoons. This process has upset consumers and animation collectors; subsequent Looney Tunes DVDs lack such <b>artifacting.</b> Cartoons in the collection that have been afflicted with DVNR are Bob Clampett's The Big Snooze, Frank Tashlin's Have You Got Any Castles?, and Robert McKimson's Gorilla My Dreams.|$|E
50|$|Each company employs its own (often proprietary) {{technology}} for turning interlaced video into high-resolution digital video files of 24 discrete images every second, called 24 progressive video or 24p. The technology must filter {{out all the}} visually unappealing <b>artifacting</b> that results from the inherent mismatch between video and film movement. Moreover, the conversion process usually requires human intervention at every edit point of a video program, so that each type of scene can be calibrated for maximum visual quality. The use of archival footage in video especially calls for extra attention.|$|E
40|$|Electroencephalogram (EEG) is {{susceptible}} to various nonneural physiological <b>artifacts.</b> Automatic <b>artifact</b> removal from EEG data remains a key challenge for extracting relevant information from brain activities. To adapt to variable subjects and EEG acquisition environments, this paper presents an automatic online <b>artifact</b> removal method based on a priori <b>artifact</b> information. The combination of discrete wavelet transform and independent component analysis (ICA), wavelet-ICA, was utilized to separate <b>artifact</b> components. The <b>artifact</b> components were then automatically identified using a priori <b>artifact</b> information, which was acquired in advance. Subsequently, signal reconstruction without <b>artifact</b> components was performed to obtain artifact-free signals. The results showed that, using this automatic online <b>artifact</b> removal method, there were statistical significant improvements of the classification accuracies in both two experiments, namely, motor imagery and emotion recognition...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: A new no-reference {{blocking}} <b>artifact</b> metric for B-DCT compression {{video is}} presented in this paper. We first present a new definition of blocking <b>artifact</b> and a new method for measuring perceptive blocking <b>artifact</b> based on HVS {{taking into account the}} luminance masking and activity masking characteristic. Then, we propose a new concept of blocking <b>artifact</b> cluster and the algorithm for clustering blocking <b>artifacts.</b> Considering eye movement and fixation, we select several clusters with most serious blocking <b>artifacts</b> and utilize the average of their blocking <b>artifacts</b> to assess the total blocking <b>artifact</b> of B-DCT recon-structed video.

5000|$|Volpe {{considered}} the Moto X's camera software to be [...] "basically idiot-proof", allowing users to take photographs without needing specialized camera knowledge, letting the camera adjust itself for each photo automatically, However, Topolsky discovered that [...] "somehow the Moto X’s post-processing is so aggressive and so ubiquitous that it ruins as many shots as it saves. There’s terrible <b>artifacting</b> and noise even in well-lit photos—like you cranked the JPEG settings way down." [...] The camera was also criticized for having inconsistent focus and exposure, and for lacking certain advanced options.|$|E
50|$|Cinepak {{is based}} on vector quantization, which is a {{significantly}} different algorithm from the discrete cosine transform (DCT) algorithm used by most current codecs (in particular the MPEG family, as well as JPEG). This permitted implementation on relatively slow CPUs (video encoded in Cinepak will usually play fine even on a 25 MHz Motorola 68030, consoles like the Sega CD usually used even slower CPUs, e.g. a 12.5 MHz 68000), but tended to result in blocky <b>artifacting</b> at low bitrates, which explained the criticism leveled at the FMV-based video games. Cinepak files tend to be about 70% larger than similar quality MPEG-4 Part 2 or Theora files.|$|E
5000|$|In 1998, Bill Kendrick {{created a}} puzzle video {{game for the}} Atari (Gem Drop) which {{utilized}} a similar effect, but by using two alternating character sets (fonts) in colored text. (Each character is 4×8 pixels, each pixel being one of 4 colors.) No color palette changes occurred, and ANTIC's display list wasn't altered — only a vertical blank interrupt was used to change the character set. This allowed for approximately 13 colors on the screen. Solid color fields that were based on two actual colors (e.g., dark red created by flickering between red and black) had less <b>artifacting</b> because they could be drawn in a checkerboard fashion. This mode was called SuperIRG. (Normal 4×8 multi-colored text on the Atari is called IRG.) ...|$|E
