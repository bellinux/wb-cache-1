In this case it was the Cheese Man. He confounds everybody because of that, and people ascribe him meaning. This to me means that we're being successful, because this means they're not worried about everything else, which means they sort of did understand most other things." ...|$|E

[...] Giving evidence in December 2011, Morgan, who bragged in a newspaper column for the Daily Mail in 2006 about hearing the message, refused to say who had played him the recorded message of the call, saying he was protecting a source. Mills told the inquiry that Morgan was [...] "a man that has written nothing but awful things about me for years and would have relished telling the inquiry if I had played a personal voicemail message to him." [...] In the official findings of his Inquiry, Lord Justice Leveson said Morgan's testimony under oath on phone hacking was [...] "utterly unpersuasive.

500|$|McEntire's seventy-sixth chart single, [...] "I'm Gonna Take That Mountain", {{released}} in mid-2003, ended her two-year break from recording. In November 2003, her twenty-third studio album, Room to Breathe, marked her first release of new material in four years. Writing for The Boston Globe, Steve Morse found the album's material {{to have a}} variety of musical stylings, saying the track [...] "Love Revival" [...] sounded like Tanya Tucker and calling [...] "If I Had <b>Any</b> <b>Sense</b> <b>at</b> All" [...] "a mournful country ballad". Dan MacIntosh of Country Standard Time gave Room to Breathe a less-received review, reporting that [...] "it ultimately falls short of leaving the listener breathless". He highlighted [...] "I'm Gonna Take That Mountain" [...] for sounding like a Bluegrass-inspired song such as music by Ricky Skaggs or Patty Loveless. The album itself reached a peak of No. 4 on the Billboard Top Country Albums chart and No.25 on the Billboard 200, staying at the position for only one week. The second single, [...] "Somebody", also recorded by Mark Wills on his [...] "Loving Every Minute" [...] release, became her twenty-second number-one single on the Billboard Hot Country Songs chart and first since [...] "If You See Him/If You See Her" [...] six years previous. This became her thirty-third number-one single overall. It took longer than expected to become a hit, according to McEntire, who said, [...] "Yeah, that had us concerned. The album came out in November and it took 30 weeks for [...] "Somebody" [...] to work its way up the charts. Usually, it's 15 weeks. But this one had a resurgence of life, especially after the video came out. MCA is really kicking butt with it."

Indeed, money was tight, but funds {{were still being}} supplied for the Historic Preservation Fund to provide matching grants-in-aid to listed property owners, first in house museums [...] and institutional buildings but later in commercial structures as well. During this time period, the SHPO had little time to devote to serious planning, even if it wanted to; the demands of saving historic properties and building the organizations {{from the ground up}} consumed most of the early state office's resources. As a result, neither the State Historic Preservation Offices nor OAHP really took planning seriously.

40|$|AbstractStatistical {{decision}} theory (SDT) and Bayesian {{decision theory}} (BDT) {{are closely related}} mathematical frameworks used to model ideal performance {{in a wide range}} of visual and motor tasks. Their elements (gain function, likelihood, prior) are readily interpretable in terms of information available to the observer. We briefly describe SDT and BDT and then review recent work employing them as models of biological perception or action. We emphasize work that employs gain functions and priors as independent or dependent variables. At one extreme, Bayesian decision theory allows the experimenter to compute ideal performance in specific tasks and compare human performance to ideal (Geisler, 1989). No claim is made that visual processing is in <b>any</b> <b>sense</b> “Bayesian”. <b>At</b> the other extreme, researchers have proposed Bayesian decision theory as a process model of “perception as Bayesian inference” (Knill & Richards, 1996). We end by discussing how possible ideal models are related to imperfect, actual observers and how the “Bayesian hypothesis” can be tested experimentally...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{the article}} is to {{determine}} what role the liar sentence plays in our language. On the one hand, {{it seems to be}} well formed formula, and on the other, {{it does not seem to}} have <b>any</b> clear <b>sense.</b> <b>At</b> the beginning of the article I point what form an adequate solution of the liar paradox should take. In my opinion it could not consist in giving rules which do not allow to build such a sentence. The paradox remains unsolved until there is such a language in which it could be expressed. In the first part of the text I try to explain why Tarski’s solution is not satisfactory. If the semantical definition of truth is correct, the liar sentence could not lead to a contradiction because formulas which are not well formed could not be premisesof any inference. From that follows that the so called liar paradox does not arise and that leads to the conclusion: ‘the reconstruction’ of the liar propounded by Tarski could not be correct. In the second part I present an approach to the liar which appeals to Frege’s and Wittgenstein’s conceptions of language. The conclusion of my consideration is that the liar sentence is nonsense, which means it is not given <b>any</b> <b>sense</b> – either its logical form is determined but we do not fix any definite meaning to some parts of it, or an attempt to determine its logical form in the standard way leads to regressad infinitum...|$|R
