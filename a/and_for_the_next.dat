In the 2004 general election, the NDA suffered an unexpected defeat, <b>and</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> ten years the BJP was the principal opposition party.

5|$|The AIF {{departed}} Australia in November 1914 and, {{after several}} delays {{due to the}} presence of German naval vessels in the Indian Ocean, arrived in Egypt, where they were initially used to defend the Suez Canal. In early 1915, however, it was decided to carry out an amphibious landing on the Gallipoli peninsula with the goal of opening up a second front and securing the passage of the Dardanelles. The Australians and New Zealanders, grouped together as the Australian and New Zealand Army Corps (ANZAC), went ashore on 25 April 1915 <b>and</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> eight months the Anzacs, alongside their British, French and other allies, fought a costly and ultimately unsuccessful campaign against the Turks.|$|E
5|$|The folwark, a {{large-scale}} system of agricultural production based on serfdom, was a dominant feature on Poland's economic landscape {{beginning in the}} late 15th century <b>and</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> 300 years. This dependence on nobility-controlled agriculture in central-eastern Europe diverged from {{the western part of the}} continent, where elements of capitalism and industrialization were developing to a much greater extent, with the attendant growth of a bourgeoisie class and its political influence. The 16th-century agricultural trade boom combined with free or very cheap peasant labor made the folwark economy very profitable.|$|E
5|$|The {{territory}} {{which would}} {{come to be known}} as Brazil was claimed by Portugal on 22 April 1500, when the navigator Pedro Álvares Cabral landed on its coast. Permanent settlement followed in 1532, <b>and</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> 300 years the Portuguese slowly expanded westwards until they had reached nearly all of the borders of modern Brazil. In 1808, the army of French Emperor Napoleon I invaded Portugal, forcing the Portuguese royal family—the House of Braganza, a branch of the thousand-year-old Capetian dynasty—into exile. They re-established themselves in the Brazilian city of Rio de Janeiro, which became the unofficial seat of the Portuguese Empire.|$|E

5|$|After {{a period}} of leave, the {{battalion}} began to reform on the Atherton Tablelands in Queensland during February 1944 <b>and</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> eight months they undertook a number of exercises and training periods as they prepared for {{the next stage of}} the war. During this time, the battalion's authorised strength was reduced to 803 men of all ranks, as the 3rd Division was converted to the Jungle divisional establishment. On 20 July 1944, the 61st Battalion embarked upon HMAT Katoomba in Cairns and proceeded overseas again. They arrived at Madang in New Guinea four days later. As it was considered that there were still isolated pockets of Japanese in the area, the battalion began patrolling operations almost as soon as they had landed.|$|E
5|$|After {{an attack}} across the Ilebbe Creek by the 2/13th Infantry Battalion, which cost the Australians 80casualties on 1 October, the Japanese naval troops which were holding Finschhafen began to withdraw. On 2 October, the town {{fell to the}} Australians and the Japanese {{abandoned}} the Kakakog Ridge amidst heavy Australian air and artillery attacks. Once the 20th Brigade was established in Finschhafen, it linked up with the 22nd Infantry Battalion, a Militia infantry battalion. This unit had cleared the coastal area {{in the south of}} the peninsula, advancing from Lae over the mountains. Meanwhile, the Japanese that had been around Finschhafen withdrew back into the mountains around Sattelberg. Allied air operations from the airfield at Finschhafen commenced on 4 October. The following day, the 2/17th Infantry Battalion was sent to Kumawa to follow up the retreating Japanese forces, <b>and</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> couple of days minor clashes resulted before it established itself at Jivevaneng again on 7 October.|$|E

5|$|Apart {{from his}} {{treatment}} by Bradman, Larwood {{was successful in}} 1930, rising to fourth place in the national bowling averages (99 wickets at 16.38). He also batted well on occasions, including a not-out century against Northamptonshire. He was not selected for the 1930–31 tour of South Africa, <b>and</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> two years he concentrated mainly on domestic cricket. He made one Test appearance in 1931, against New Zealand, in a rain-ruined game in which he neither batted nor bowled. He headed the domestic bowling averages in 1931 and 1932, in the latter year with 162 wickets at 12.86, the best seasonal figures of his career. However, because of his poor Test record in 1930, Larwood thought his chances of selection for the 1932–33 tour to Australia were slim. The 1932 Test trial was limited to half a day's play, during which Larwood bowled 15 overs for a single wicket. Nevertheless, to his great relief he was selected for the tour, as was Voce, who had been England's most successful bowler during the South African tour of 1930–31.|$|E
5|$|Assigned to the American Patrol Detachment, Schurz {{departed}} Charleston {{toward the}} end of April <b>and,</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> two months, conducted patrols and performed escort duty and towing missions along the east coast and in the Caribbean. On 19 June, she departed New York for Key West. At 04:44 on the 21st, southwest of Cape Lookout lightship, she was rammed by the merchant ship Florida. The ship hit Schurz on the starboard side, crumpling that wing of the bridge, penetrating the well and berth deck about 12 feet, and cutting through bunker no. 3 to the forward fire room. One of Schurzs crewmen was killed instantly; twelve others were injured. Schurz was abandoned and sank three hours later. The ship was struck from the Navy list on 26 August 1918.|$|E
5|$|At 08:30 Robertson and Lalor {{decided to}} take their {{companies}} up Baby 700. Instead of going round to the right like Tulloch, they went straight up the centre, crossed over the summit onto the northern slope and went to ground. A spur on their left, leading to Suvla Bay, was defended by a Turkish trench system. At 09:15 Turkish troops started moving down Battleship Hill, <b>and</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> hour they exchanged fire. Where the spur joined Baby 700, a group of Australians from the 9th, 11th, and 12th Battalions crossed Malone's Gully and charged the Turkish trench. A Turkish machine-gun on Baby 700 opened fire on them, forcing them back, followed by a general withdrawal of Australian troops. The Turks had secured Battleship Hill and were now driving the Australians off Baby 700. From his headquarters {{at the head of}} Monash Valley, Maclagen could see the Turks attacking, and started sending all available men towards Baby 700.|$|E
