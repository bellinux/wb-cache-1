Changes include an on-campus stadium, additional on-campus housing, {{and the establishment of}} a College of Medicine in 2010.|$|E
5|$|The Zelda story {{setting was}} {{initially}} supposed to include technological elements, {{such as a}} time-travelling main character and a Triforce made of electronic circuits. While the final game follows <b>a</b> <b>more</b> <b>traditional</b> heroic fantasy setting, subsequent games in the series have used more technology-based concepts.|$|E
5|$|While {{the console}} {{versions}} of the game are fully three-dimensional, the Game Boy Advance version is rendered in an isometric style that incorporates both 2D sprites and 3D models. This version is <b>a</b> <b>more</b> <b>traditional</b> Tony Hawk's game, with little attention given to story or customization. The mobile phone version is similarly restricted.|$|E

5|$|<b>A</b> <b>more</b> <b>traditional</b> Serbian nightlife experience, {{accompanied}} by traditional music known as Starogradska (roughly translated as Old Town Music), typical of northern Serbia's urban environments, is most prominent in Skadarlija, the city's old bohemian neighborhood where the poets and artists of Belgrade {{gathered in the}} 19th and early 20th centuries. Skadar Street (the centre of Skadarlija) and the surrounding neighbourhood are lined with some of Belgrade's best and oldest traditional restaurants (called kafanas in Serbian), which date back to that period. At {{one end of the}} neighbourhood stands Belgrade's oldest beer brewery, founded {{in the first half of}} the 19th century. One of the city's oldest kafanas is the Znak pitanja("?").|$|E
5|$|A {{video of}} the Stockholm {{performance}} of the Final Fantasy VI Symphonic Poem was released on October 11, 2014, and a full album recorded by the London Symphony Orchestra at Abbey Road Studios was released on February 23, 2015 by Merregnon Studios. The album, along with the concerts themselves, were heavily praised, both {{for the quality of}} the performance and for the quality of the arrangements, which overlaid themes from multiple pieces rather than relying on <b>a</b> <b>more</b> <b>traditional</b> medley. The concert series was followed by Final Symphony II, a similar concert tour by Merregnon Studios which began in 2015 with music from Final Fantasy V, VII, IX, and XIII.|$|E
5|$|Composer Tyler Bates began scoring Watchmen in November 2007. He {{planned to}} visit the shoot for a week during each month, and view {{assembly}} cuts of scenes to begin rough composing. Snyder and Bates listened to the soundtracks of 1980s films such as Manhunter, Blade Runner, and To Live and Die in L.A. for inspiration. Bates switched between a Yamaha CS-80 or an MOTM for moments that he felt should have more ambience or synthesizers. Snyder wanted a scene where Nite Owl and Silk Spectre rescue people from a burning building to have <b>a</b> <b>more</b> <b>traditional</b> superhero feel, so Bates implemented a four to the floor guitar rhythm. A 64-strong choir and the 87-piece ensemble from the Hollywood Studio Symphony were hired for the more orchestral themes.|$|E

5|$|In March 1992, John C. Hitt became UCF's fourth president, {{ushering}} {{in an era}} of unprecedented growth and prominence for the university. Once known mainly as a small commuter and technology school, in recent years UCF has undertaken an effort to increase its academic and research standings while also evolving into <b>a</b> <b>more</b> <b>traditional</b> research university. When Hitt took office, UCF's enrollment was 20,302, and as of 2014 enrollment consists of 60,821 students attending classes on twelve campuses spread across Central Florida. The university consists of thirteen colleges and employs more than 10,150 faculty and staff. Under the direction of Hitt, UCF has raised admissions standards, increased research funding, built new facilities, and established notable partnerships with major research institutions.|$|E
5|$|In Ronaldo's absence, however, Nani's {{style has}} {{developed}} into that of <b>a</b> <b>more</b> <b>traditional</b> winger; while {{being able to}} play on both wings, he is more comfortable on the right, {{where he has been}} known to utilise his pace, ball control, technical skills and trickery to create space and provide crosses for teammates. While capable of cutting off both wings to strike at goal from distance, Nani has substantially fewer goals, yet a substantially higher proportion of assists than his former colleague. Due to his offensive movement, he can also play in a more offensive role, as a forward, inverted winger, second striker, or even in a more central position, as a main striker.|$|E
5|$|Karmal was {{promoted}} to Chairman of the Revolutionary Council and Chairman of the Council of Ministers on 27 December 1979. He remained in office until 1981, when he was succeeded by Sultan Ali Keshtmand. Throughout his term, Karmal worked to establish a support base for the PDPA by introducing several reforms. Among these were the Fundamental Principles of the Democratic Republic of Afghanistan, introducing a general amnesty for those people imprisoned during Nur Mohammad Taraki's and Amin's rule. He also replaced the Khalqist flag with <b>a</b> <b>more</b> <b>traditional</b> one. These policies failed to increase the PDPA's legitimacy {{in the eyes of}} the Afghan people.|$|E

50|$|For CBS' {{coverage}} of Super Bowl XXIV {{at the end}} of the 1989 season, they introduced a brand new theme.

The theme was used until the 1991 NFC Championship Game.|$|R
50|$|The CT05 was {{designed}} to use Renault's new 1.6-litre V6 turbocharged engine, the Energy F1-2014. The car was unveiled on 28 January during the first winter test at Circuito de Jerez. It was noted for its unique nose design, which was replaced with <b>a</b> slightly <b>more</b> <b>traditional</b> design at the Belgian Grand Prix.|$|R
5|$|Many of Daniel Libeskind's {{original}} concepts {{from the}} 2002 competition were discarded from the tower's final design. One World Trade Center's final design consisted of simple symmetries and <b>a</b> <b>more</b> <b>traditional</b> profile, intended {{to compare with}} selected elements of the contemporary New York skyline. The tower's central spire draws from previous buildings, such as the Empire State Building and the Chrysler Building. It also visually resembles the original Twin Towers, rather than being an off-center spire similar to the Statue of Liberty.|$|E
5|$|Strange {{arranged}} the Pro Tools session in <b>a</b> <b>more</b> <b>traditional</b> manner by {{laying out the}} drums, bass instruments, guitars, keyboards, main vocals and overdubs from left to right. While mixing, he began with drums, then the main vocals. He added the chorus and bridge, followed by other instrumentation. Strange mixed the track to satisfy Eminem, who, after entering the studio, made his own adjustments, providing additional production; by then, Resto's tracks were added. Strange made adjustments to Boi-1da's tracks, using SSL equalization (EQ) and some compression. To keep the track in tune from pitch fluctuation, Strange used Trim and Auto-Tune on Resto's TR-808 kick. Strange arranged reverberation tools, including the Bricasti, Eventide 2016, the Lexicon 480, Lexicon PMC70, and the Yamaha SPX90.|$|E
5|$|The {{figure of}} Joan of Arc {{represents}} both a common {{person and a}} child that was free from society's corruption. Between the editions, however, Southey's understanding of politics and religion began to change, and this {{is reflected in the}} changes of Joan of Arc for the second edition. Joan was originally a character that had a natural understanding of religion that was connected to a Socinian form of Christianity. She, as a child, was ignorant of Church and of theology except what was revealed to her directly. However, this was replaced in the second edition with Joan having <b>a</b> <b>more</b> <b>traditional</b> form of religion that was provided to her during her youth.|$|E

5|$|The {{score for}} the Bourne Identity was {{composed}} by John Powell. Powell was bought in to replace Carter Burwell, who had composed and recorded <b>a</b> <b>more</b> <b>traditional</b> orchestral {{score for the}} film, which director Doug Liman rejected. Since {{a lot of the}} music budget had been spent recording the rejected score, Powell's score was initially conceived to be entirely non-orchestral, making extensive use of percussion, guitars, electronics and studio techniques. However, a string section was later overdubbed onto many of the cues to give them a 'cinematic' quality.|$|E
5|$|The soundtracks have {{received}} mixed to positive reviews from both dedicated video game music outlets and video game critics. The first game was {{noted for its}} disturbing style, which both drew criticism for repetitiveness and praise for suiting the game's atmosphere. It has been generally cited as an experimental soundtrack. The second game's soundtrack received a more positive reception, with the general opinion being that it was <b>a</b> <b>more</b> <b>traditional</b> and consequently more comfortable soundtrack. The third game's soundtrack also received fairly positive comments, mainly praising its quality, although critiques were made concerning its variety. The chiptune compilation was generally liked, except for its exclusivity to the special release. The singles have also received praise.|$|E
5|$|Throughout Charles's reign, {{the issue}} of how far the English Reformation should {{progress}} was constantly brought to the forefront of political debate. Arminian theology emphasised clerical authority and the individual's ability to reject or accept salvation, and was consequently viewed as heretical and a potential vehicle for the reintroduction of Roman Catholicism by its Calvinist opponents. Charles's sympathy to the teachings of Arminianism, and specifically his wish to move the Church of England away from Calvinism in <b>a</b> <b>more</b> <b>traditional</b> and sacramental direction, were perceived by Puritans as irreligious tendencies. In addition, Charles's Protestant subjects followed news of the European war closely and grew increasingly dismayed by Charles's diplomacy with Spain and his failure to support the Protestant cause abroad effectively.|$|E
