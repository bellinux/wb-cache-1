40|$|Abstract: There are {{two phases}} to the polar {{alignment}} problem. First one must quantify the <b>alignment</b> <b>error</b> for each axis. Once <b>alignment</b> <b>error</b> is known the mount must {{be adjusted to}} correct for this error. Often the adjustment amount must be estimated based on {{the magnitude of the}} error. This is primarily {{due to the fact that}} most mount manufacturers do not provide or calibrate the altitude and azimuth axes with high precision scales. This article will show a simple method utilizing a calculated star offset position to make the mount adjustment. The star offset position is calculated based on the known celestial coordinates of a reference star and the <b>alignment</b> <b>error</b> such that pointing the telescope at this coordinate and adjusting the mount to recenter the reference star will bring the mount into close alignment. This method is called “star offset positioning ” and should greatly reduce the amount of time to perform the alignment procedure. Overview In Measuring Polar Axis <b>Alignment</b> <b>Error</b> [1] we discussed various methods to measure the polar <b>alignment</b> <b>error.</b> If the mount were designed with encoders on the altitude and azimuth adjustment axes, or if these were calibrated with an accurate visual scale, the adjustment to th...|$|R

40|$|AbstractAlthough {{studied for}} decades, {{effective}} face recognition remains difficult to accomplish {{on account of}} occlusions and pose and illumination variations. Pose variance is a particular challenge in face recognition. Effective local descriptors have been proposed for frontal face recognition. When these descriptors are directly applied to cross-pose face recognition, the performance significantly decreases. To improve the descriptor performance for cross-pose face recognition, we propose a face recognition algorithm based on multiple virtual views and <b>alignment</b> <b>error.</b> First, warps between poses are learned using the Lucas–Kanade algorithm. Based on these warps, multiple virtual profile views are generated from a single frontal face, which enables non-frontal faces to be matched using the scale-invariant feature transform (SIFT) algorithm. Furthermore, warps indicate the correspondence between patches of two faces. A two-phase <b>alignment</b> <b>error</b> is proposed to obtain accurate warps, which contain pose alignment and individual alignment. Correlations between patches are considered to calculate the <b>alignment</b> <b>error</b> of two faces. Finally, a hybrid similarity between two faces is calculated; it combines the number of matched keypoints from SIFT and the <b>alignment</b> <b>error.</b> Experimental results show that our proposed method achieves better recognition accuracy than existing algorithms, even when the pose difference angle was greater than 30 °...|$|R

Figures of merit for wafer-level packaging techniques are chip size, hermeticity, processing temperature, (in)tolerance to <b>alignment</b> <b>errors</b> and surface roughness. Anodic and silicon fusion bonding do not require an intermediate layer, but do not tolerate surface roughness.
