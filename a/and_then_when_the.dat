5|$|Lord Wilberforce, in Quistclose, {{stated that}} the {{contract}} gives the moneylender an equitable interest in the loan. Under Wilberforce's two-stage trust, the interest in the money first goes from the lender to the borrower (the primary trust) <b>and</b> <b>then,</b> <b>when</b> <b>the</b> trust's purpose fails, reverses (the secondary trust). In Twinsectra Lord Millett also explained that a Quistclose trust is a resulting trust, but held that the lender retains the interest throughout the transaction, with no need for this interest to reverse if {{the purpose of the}} loan fails. The problem with Wilberforce's analysis, as explained by Alastair Hudson, Professor of Equity and Finance Law at the University of Exeter, is that because the resulting trust only comes into existence after the misuse of the loan, it may come too late; if the money is not available when the claim is brought, there is no remedy. The borrower may already have spent the money, or already be insolvent and the subject of claims by creditors.|$|E
5|$|Qiao Weiyue {{also built}} five double slipways (lit. dams) between Anbei and Huaishi (or, the quays on the Huai waterfront). Each of these had ten lanes for the barges {{to go up}} and down. Their cargoes of {{imperial}} tax-grain were heavy, and as they were passing over they often came to grief and were damaged or wrecked, with loss of the grain and peculation by a cabal of the workers in league with local bandits hidden nearby. Qiao Weiyue therefore first ordered the construction of two gates at the third dam along the West River (near Huaiyin). The distance between the two gates was rather more than 50 paces (250ft) and the whole space was covered over with a great roof like a shed. The gates were 'hanging gates'; (when they were closed) the water accumulated like a tide until the required level was reached, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>when</b> <b>the</b> time came it was allowed to flow out. He also built a horizontal bridge to protect their foundations. After this was done (to all the double slipways) the previous corruption was completely eliminated, and the passage of the boats went on without the slightest impediment.|$|E
5|$|To stop this, the Spartan {{commander}} ordered {{some of his}} men {{to charge}} the Athenians, but the peltasts fell back, easily outrunning the hoplites, <b>and</b> <b>then,</b> <b>when</b> <b>the</b> Spartans turned {{to return to the}} regiment, the peltasts fell upon them, flinging spears at them as they fled, and inflicted casualties. This process was repeated several times, with similar results. Even when a group of Spartan cavalrymen arrived, the Spartan commander made the curious decision that they should keep pace with the hoplites in pursuit, instead of racing ahead to ride down the fleeing peltasts. Unable to drive off the peltasts, and suffering losses all the while, the Spartans were driven back to a hilltop overlooking Lechaeum. The men in Lechaeum, seeing their predicament, sailed out in small boats to as close as to the hill as they could reach, about a half mile away. The Athenians, meanwhile, began to bring up their hoplites, and the Spartans, seeing these two developments, broke and ran for the boats, pursued by the peltasts all the way. All in all, in the fighting and pursuit, 250 of the 600 men in the regiment were killed.|$|E

25|$|According to Ward, when, {{in about}} 1,500 million years, the {{distance}} of the Moon, which is continuously increasing from tidal effects, has increased from the current 60.3 to approximately 66.5 Earth radii, resonances from planetary effects will push precession to 49,000 years at first, <b>and</b> <b>then,</b> <b>when</b> <b>the</b> Moon reaches 68 Earth radii in about 2,000 million years, to 69,000 years. This will be associated with wild swings in the obliquity of the ecliptic as well. Ward, however, used the abnormally large modern value for tidal dissipation. Using the 620-million year average provided by tidal rhythmites of about half the modern value, these resonances will not be reached until about 3,000 and 4,000 million years, respectively. However, due to the gradually increasing luminosity of the Sun, the oceans of the Earth will have vaporized long before that time (about 2,100 million years from now).|$|E
25|$|Clough was {{replaced}} in October 1974 by former England captain Jimmy Armfield, who stabilised the club – Leeds finished 9th {{in the league}} – and Revie's old team made one last swansong in the European Cup, reaching {{the final of the}} competition after defeating Spanish champions Barcelona over two legs, a team captained by Johan Cruyff. However Leeds would lose another European final in controversial circumstances, going down 2–0 to defending European champions Bayern Munich. Leeds had dominated the match with Bayern taking the defensive from the outset; in the 60th minute Peter Lorimer had a seemingly decisive goal disallowed due to a dubious offside decision given against captain Billy Bremner. This came after both the linesman and referee had initially signalled a goal. The referee Michel Kitabdjian also turned down two Leeds claims for penalties, firstly when Franz Beckenbauer handled the ball inside the penalty area, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>when</b> <b>the</b> Bayern Munich captain tripped Allan Clarke in the box after going through on goal. In response to these decisions, frustrated Leeds fans ripped out seats at the Parc des Princes stadium and rioted, which resulted in Leeds receiving a three-year ban from European football. Kitabdjian never officiated in Europe again.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Hydrogenated {{amorphous}} carbon (a-C:H) films on silicon wafers were prepared by middle frequency pulsed unbalanced magnetron sputtering technique (MFPUMST) at different substrate bias under the acetylene-argon mixed gases. These films were characterized with Raman spectroscopy, {{atomic force microscopy}} (AFM) and nanoindentation. Raman spectra show that the sp 3 fraction in a-C:H films increases with increasing substrate bias voltage from 0 to 100 V, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> decreases <b>when</b> <b>the</b> substrate bias above 100 V. AFM and nanoindentation results reveal that the surface roughness and nano-hardness of the films increase with increasing substrate bias voltage from 0 to 100 V, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> decreases <b>when</b> <b>the</b> substrate bias above 100 V. The mechanism of sputtering current on the sp 3 fraction is discussed in this paper...|$|R
