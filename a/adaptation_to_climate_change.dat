These shifts in allele frequency have progressed toward more tolerant types of zooxanthellae.

25|$|Autonomous {{adaptation}} are adaptations {{that are}} reactive to climatic stimuli, and are {{done as a}} matter of course without the intervention of a public agency. Planned adaptation can be reactive or anticipatory, i.e., undertaken before impacts are apparent. Some studies suggest that human systems have considerable capacity to adapt autonomously (Smit et al., 2001:890). Others point to constraints on autonomous adaptation, such as limited information and access to resources (p.890). Smit et al.
