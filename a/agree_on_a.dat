5|$|On June 28, 2012, {{a divided}} Supreme Court {{held that the}} Stolen Valor Act's {{prohibition}} against making false statements of having been awarded a military medal violated the First Amendment.

5|$|Gliding did {{not return}} to the Olympics after the war for two reasons: a {{shortage}} of gliders, and the failure to <b>agree</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> single model of competition glider. (Some in the community feared doing so would hinder development of new designs.) The re-introduction of air sports such as gliding to the Olympics has occasionally been proposed by the world governing body, the Fédération Aéronautique Internationale (FAI), but has been rejected on the grounds of lack of public interest.|$|E
5|$|House Republicans {{planned to}} hold a {{non-binding}} caucus vote on October 8, followed by the official floor vote on October 29. The winning candidate requires a 218-vote majority to win. Multiple ballots may be cast if {{the majority of the}} House cannot <b>agree</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> candidate. While McCarthy and Chaffetz both said they would vote for the winner of the caucus vote in the floor vote, Webster did not make the same promise.|$|E

5|$|If {{both houses}} cannot <b>agree</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> budget or a treaty, {{even through the}} {{appointment}} of a joint committee of the Diet, or if the House of Councillors fails to take final action on a proposed budget or treaty within 30 days of its approval by the House of Representatives, then the decision of the lower house is deemed to be that of the Diet.|$|E
5|$|Loading and {{unloading}} a bulker is {{time-consuming and}} dangerous. The process is planned by the ship's chief mate under {{the direct and}} continued supervision of ship's captain. International regulations require that the captain and terminal master <b>agree</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> detailed plan before operations begin. Deck officers and stevedores oversee the operations. Occasionally loading errors are made that cause a ship to capsize or break in half at the pier.|$|E

5|$|Since Minnesota had divided governments {{for decades}} before 2010, {{a number of}} past budgets had brought the state close to a {{shutdown}}, {{and there had been}} one shutdown before in state history. After Governor Pawlenty and the Republican-majority House could not <b>agree</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> budget with the DFL-majority Senate in 2005, the state government went through a nine-day shutdown.|$|E
5|$|The Turkish Grand Prix {{was removed}} from the {{calendar}} after Formula One Management and the event organisers could not <b>agree</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> renewed contract. In August 2011, organisers of the race revealed that they were negotiating with Bernie Ecclestone to resume their place on the calendar. However, the race {{was removed from}} the calendar later that month.|$|E
5|$|Also in Oregon v. Mitchell, the Supreme Court {{addressed}} {{the constitutionality of}} various other provisions relating to voter qualifications and prerequisites to voting. The Court upheld Section 202, which prohibits any state or local jurisdiction from requiring people to live in their borders for longer than 30 days before allowing them to vote in a presidential election. Additionally, the Court upheld the provision lowering the minimum voting age to 18 in federal elections, but it held that Congress exceeded its power by lowering the voting age to 18 in state elections; this precipitated the ratification of the Twenty-sixth Amendment the following year, which lowered the voting age in all elections to 18. The Court was deeply divided in Oregon v. Mitchell, {{and a majority of}} justices did not <b>agree</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> rationale for the holding.|$|E

Under the Constitution, should both houses not <b>agree</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> common candidate, then a joint {{committee}} is allowed to be established {{to agree on the}} matter; specifically within a period of ten days, exclusive of the period of recess. However, if both houses still do not agree to each other, the decision made by the House of Representatives is deemed to be that of the National Diet. Upon designation, the Prime Minister is presented with their commission, and then formally appointed to office by the Emperor.|$|E
5|$|By {{his third}} season, 1998–99, Iginla led the Flames in goals with 28. His success {{complicated}} negotiations {{for a new}} contract, as he and the Flames struggled to <b>agree</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> new deal following the season. Hoping to help resolve the contract impasse, Iginla agreed to attend training camp without a contract and purchased his own insurance as the team {{would not have been}} responsible financially if he suffered an injury. He remained without a contract {{at the start of the}} 1999–2000 season and missed the first three games as a holdout before signing a three-year deal worth US$4.9 million, plus bonuses. He finished the year with career highs in goals (29) and points (63). He then topped both marks in 2000–01 by recording 31goals and 71points.|$|E
5|$|Dougan succeeded Terry Neill – {{his future}} Northern Ireland manager – as {{chairman}} of the Professional Footballers' Association (PFA) in 1970.

He oversaw the inaugural PFA awards in 1973–74, which included the PFA Players' Player of the Year, PFA Young Player of the Year, PFA Team of the Year, and PFA Merit Award. He pushed for freedom of contract for players, and in 1978 accepted a compromise deal that allowed players to switch clubs {{at the end of their}} contracts, providing that the player's new club and old club could <b>agree</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> transfer fee, with a tribunal agreeing on a fee in cases where clubs could not agree.|$|E

5|$|Following {{the release}} of Toy Story 2 in 1999, Pixar and Disney had a gentlemen's {{agreement}} that Disney would not make any sequels without Pixar's involvement, despite their own right to do so. After the two companies were unable to <b>agree</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> new deal, Disney announced in 2004 they would plan move forward on sequels with/without Pixar, and put Toy Story 3 into pre-production at Disney's new CGI division Circle 7 Animation. However, when Lasseter was placed {{in charge of all}} Disney and Pixar animation following the 2006 merger of the companies, he put all sequels on hold and Toy Story 3 was cancelled. In May 2006, it was announced that Toy Story 3 was back in pre-production with a new plot and under Pixar's control. The film was released on June 18, 2010, as Pixar's eleventh feature film.|$|E
5|$|In August 2008, Zardari relented, and the {{coalition}} agreed to proceed full speed towards Musharraf's impeachment by drafting a charge-sheet against him. The coalition charged him with high treason for the 1999 coup and the imposition of martial law. He warned Musharraf against dismissing Parliament, and {{the coalition}} selected Gillani instead of Musharraf to represent Pakistan at the 2008 Beijing Olympics. On 18 August, Musharraf resigned {{in order to avoid}} impeachment. Although Zardari favoured granting Musharraf immunity from prosecution, the coalition could not <b>agree</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> decision. The coalition also could not reach a united stance {{on the future of the}} judiciary.|$|E
5|$|Returning to Los Angeles in 2005–06, Cammalleri {{established}} himself as an NHL regular, appearing in 80 games with the Kings and leading the team with 26 goals. He improved to 34 goals and 80 points in 2006–07 and was voted {{the recipient of the}} Bill Libby Memorial Award as the Kings' most valuable player by the local media. He and the Kings were unable to <b>agree</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> new contract following the season. Cammalleri was asking for $6-million per season, while the team offered $2.6 million. The two sides went to arbitration, where Cammalleri was awarded a two-year contract that paid him $3.1 million then $3.6 million.|$|E
