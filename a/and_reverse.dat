5|$|As Boykett argues, any {{one-dimensional}} reversible {{cellular automaton}} {{is equivalent to}} an automaton in rectangular form, in which the cells are offset a half unit at each time step, and in which both the forward <b>and</b> <b>reverse</b> evolution of the automaton have neighborhoods with just two cells, the cells a half unit away in each direction. If a reversible automaton has neighborhoods larger than two cells, it can be simulated by a reversible automaton with smaller neighborhoods and more states per cell, in which each cell of the simulating automaton simulates a contiguous block of cells in the simulated automaton. The two axioms of a semicentral bigroupoid are exactly the conditions required on the forward <b>and</b> <b>reverse</b> transition functions of these two-cell neighborhoods to be the reverses of each other. That is, every semicentral bigroupoid defines a reversible cellular automaton in rectangular form, in which the transition function of the automaton uses the operation to combine the two cells of its neighborhood, and in which the operation similarly defines the reverse dynamics of the automaton. Every one-dimensional reversible cellular automaton is equivalent to one in this form.|$|E

5|$|Desalination is the {{technique}} of removing salts from seawater to leave fresh water suitable for drinking or irrigation. The two main processing methods, vacuum distillation <b>and</b> <b>reverse</b> osmosis, use large quantities of energy. Desalination is normally only undertaken where fresh water from other sources is in short supply or energy is plentiful, as in the excess heat generated by power stations. The brine produced as a by-product contains some toxic materials and is returned to the sea.|$|E

5|$|Wave Race 64 is {{a racing}} {{game in which}} players race on Jet Skis in {{different}} weather conditions and {{on a variety of}} courses. The game features three single-player modes (Championship, Time Trials, and Stunt Mode) as well as a multiplayer mode for competitive play. In the Championship mode, the player must race opponents through a series of courses and win the first place. Up to four levels of difficulty can be chosen: Normal, Hard, Expert <b>and</b> <b>Reverse,</b> the latter being Expert with the tracks oriented backwards. Hard, Expert, <b>and</b> <b>Reverse</b> must be unlocked by completing an earlier difficulty. The difficulty also determines the number of courses played: six in Normal, seven in Hard, and eight in Expert/Reverse. When the player completes a course, points are awarded based on the rank they finished. If the required quantity is not met, the player will be disqualified and the game will be over.|$|E

5|$|Enzymes serve a {{wide variety}} of {{functions}} inside living organisms. They are indispensable for signal transduction and cell regulation, often via kinases and phosphatases. They also generate movement, with myosin hydrolyzing ATP to generate muscle contraction, and also transport cargo around the cell as part of the cytoskeleton. Other ATPases in the cell membrane are ion pumps involved in active transport. Enzymes are also involved in more exotic functions, such as luciferase generating light in fireflies. Viruses can also contain enzymes for infecting cells, such as the HIV integrase <b>and</b> <b>reverse</b> transcriptase, or for viral release from cells, like the influenza virus neuraminidase.|$|E

5|$|Sukhoi {{is working}} on a more {{advanced}} version, the Su-33K, a development to integrate the advanced technologies of the Su-35 fighters into the older Su-33 airframe.

Various aircraft are alleged to have originated partially from the Su-33, such as the Shenyang J-15. Photos of Shenyang aircraft designers posing in front of a T-10K carrier based fighter prototype strongly suggest that the J-15 is directly related to T-10K. Negotiations stagnated as the Shenyang Aircraft company sought to reduce Russian content in the aircraft, while Sukhoi wanted to ensure a level of income from future upgrades and modifications made to the J-11.|$|E

In December 1930, however, it was planned to construct stations only up to 169th Street, with tail tracks and switches installed up to the foot of the station at 178th Street, along with a provision for the station. The tracks ended at bumper blocks, and the tunnel at a bulkhead. Under these plans, the 178th Street station would be built during a further eastward extension. The Queens Boulevard Line was extended up to 169th Street on April 24, 1937, with the tail tracks and switches used to store <b>and</b> <b>reverse</b> trains.|$|E
5|$|The United States trade dollar was {{a dollar}} coin minted by the United States Mint {{to compete with}} other large silver trade coins that were already popular in East Asia. The idea first came about in the 1860s, {{when the price of}} silver began to decline due to {{increased}} mining efforts in the western United States. A bill providing in part for the issuance of the trade dollar was eventually put before Congress, where it was approved and later signed into law as the Coinage Act of 1873. The act made trade dollars legal tender up to five dollars. A number of designs were considered for the trade dollar, and an obverse <b>and</b> <b>reverse</b> created by William Barber were selected.|$|E
5|$|The {{player is}} a {{foreigner}} who {{arrives in the}} Dyrwood. Their caravan is hit by a mysterious storm that kills everyone but them. Taking refuge in a cave, the player character witnesses some cultists perform a ritual on a machine that can strip souls from their bodies.

This curses the Watcher with waking visions and an inability to sleep. In time, the Watcher will go insane from this, so they must track down the cultists <b>and</b> <b>reverse</b> the curse.|$|E

5|$|Toyota Australia {{planned to}} sell 50 to 70 TRD Aurion units per month with the {{majority}} of the sales coming from Australia. However, the project was unsuccessful, and as of 31 March 2009, TRD Australia halted production of the Aurion TRD (and TRD Hilux), and the division was shut down. When available, the range comprised two variants, the 3500S and 3500SL. The former features performance mufflers, 19-inch alloy wheels, red alcantara leather seats with black alcantara fabric bolsters and other high-performance upgrades. The range-topping 3500SL adds clearance <b>and</b> <b>reverse</b> parking sensors, dual-zone climate control air conditioning, a colour-coded transmission selection lever, and an eight-way adjustable driver's seat. Furthermore, the SL gains an aluminium rear bumper reinforcement addition, and is the first production car in the world to use the Eaton twin-vortices supercharger. This substantially reduces engine noise while bringing gains to power and torque.|$|E
5|$|Although the CCC {{became a}} {{powerful}} political {{force in the}} following years, at the 8th National Congress in 1956 its inspectors were warned about abusing their power and becoming independent of their local party committees. Its power waned during the Great Leap Forward, but the CCC, the Secretariat and the Organisation Department became the chief weapons {{in the aftermath of}} the Great Leap to combat corruption <b>and</b> <b>reverse</b> verdicts on rightists. The CCC played its new role until the Cultural Revolution, a socio-political movement which lasted from 1966 until 1976, when it was affected by purges (partly due to its close ties to Peng Zhen, one of the first highly ranked officials purged during the Cultural Revolution). At the 9th National Congress in 1969 the CCC was abolished, removed from the party constitution and replaced by special-case organisations (such as the Central Case Examination Group) formed under Mao and Kang Sheng. Despite its abolition at the congress, little criticism was directed at the CCC during the Cultural Revolution; although CCC Deputy Secretary Min Yifan was criticised by the Red Guards, a revolutionary youth movement independent of the party (but inspired by Mao) during the Cultural Revolution, most of their disapproval focused on his career on local committees rather than the CCC. Talk of an internal party-control system would not resurface until the death of Mao and the arrest of the Gang of Four in 1976.|$|E
