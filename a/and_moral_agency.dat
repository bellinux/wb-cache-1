5000|$|Agency is the {{capacity}} of an actor {{to act in a}} given environment. The capacity to act does not at first imply a specific moral dimension to the ability to make the choice to act, <b>and</b> <b>moral</b> <b>agency</b> is therefore a distinct concept. In sociology, an agent is an individual engaging with the social structure. Notably, though, the primacy of social structure vs. individual capacity with regard to persons' actions is debated within sociology.

For a greater consideration of MacIntyre's virtue ethics approach in order to respond to such challenges is argued.

40|$|This {{project is}} {{primarily}} exegetical {{in nature and}} aims to provide a rational reconstruction {{of the concept of}} moral responsibility in the work of Immanuel Kant, specifically in his Critique of Pure Reason (CPR), Groundwork of the Metaphysics of Morals (GR), and Critique of Practical Reason (CPrR). It consists of three chapters – the first chapter interprets the concept of freedom that follows from the resolution to the Third Antinomy in the CPR. It argues that Kant is best understood here to be providing an unusual but cogent, compatibilist account of freedom that the author terms meta-compatibilism. The second chapter examines the GR and CPrR to interpret the theory of practical reason <b>and</b> <b>moral</b> <b>agency</b> that Kant develops in these works. This chapter concludes by evaluating what has been established about Kant’s ideas of freedom <b>and</b> <b>moral</b> <b>agency</b> at that point in the project, identifying some problems and objections in addition to providing some suggestions for how Kantian ethics might be adapted within a consequentialist framework.

40|$|The {{discussion}} about <b>moral</b> <b>agency</b> <b>and</b> technology is troubled by some severe misunderstandings.

Much of the discussion then focuses on the question whether not only humans but also technologies can have intentionality, freedom, responsibility, <b>and,</b> ultimately, <b>moral</b> <b>agency.</b> From the perspective of mediation theory, this discussion remains caught in a dualist paradigm that locates human beings and technological artifacts in two separate realms, humans being intentional and free, technologies being instrumental and mute. Against the question to what extent technologies can be moral agents, mediation theory {{makes it possible to}} investigate how intentionality, freedom, and agency are in fact the result of intricate connections and interactions between human beings and technological artifacts.

40|$|I outline {{a program}} for the {{scientific}} naturalization of ethics, focusing on metaethics and the sciences of biology and psychology.

In particular, I propose a selectionist model, based on natural, behavioral, and social/cultural selection, to explain the origin, development, <b>and</b> operation of <b>moral</b> <b>agency.</b> Arguably epistemology is being scientifically naturalized (Kornblith, 1994; Kitcher, 1992). Can ethics also be naturalized, scientifically naturalized? In this paper, I argue that {{there is good reason to}} think so. After sketching some requirements for a successful scientific naturalization of ethics, I show how one piece of those requirements can be filled in by appeal to current plausible theories in evolutionary biology, developmental psychology, and social cognitive theory. I conclude that although the project of naturalizing ethics is not as far along as that of naturalizing epistemology, the former project merits pursuit.

This study will explain how the construction process of moral identity actor is formed in the era of cultural globalization. Moral identity construction of the actor in the era of globalization will be the anchor for agents to act and preserve the traditional culture with motivation, passion, and hope. This study used a qualitative approach by using the framework of Zygmunt Bauman concept of liquid modernity <b>and</b> <b>moral</b> <b>agency.</b> Through the framework of moral agency, this study shows how the construction of moral identity process begins with the actor disquiet over the state of traditional culture in globalization era. Moral identity of the actor is capable of forming social practices agent in a daily life. First, by forming a community KISS. Second, as the cornerstone of actors to act and to select the choice in their life. The author argues that the expression of the identity of the actor through this social movement will create the role of cultural diversity in the era of cultural globalization and liquid modernity. Through this analytical approach, which is an identity <b>and</b> <b>moral</b> <b>agency</b> in the process of globalization, the author wants to move away from an agentless view of globalization process by viewing at the dynamics of the agency.

40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{grounded}} in philosophy and in literature. It {{is concerned with the}} recognized human need for self-affirmation and with the consequences of its denial caused by exile. For the victim this means the loss of social interaction <b>and</b> public <b>moral</b> <b>agency</b> within his natural community through which self-affirmation can be actualized. In certain types of exilic literature constructive reactions were found to counteract this loss of freedom of choice of action and place, which entails potential annihilation of the exile's personal integrity. In the exilic text of Dante as my chosen case study, I investigate the use of philosophical and literary means admitting of various kinds of self-referential expressions and of similacra of <b>moral</b> <b>agency</b> as substitutes for self-affirmation by public acts. Stimulated by these means, an intellectual <b>and</b> <b>moral</b> 'self-portrait' of the poet eventually emerges in the reader's consciousness. This 'portrait' is no static image of a pre-existent character, but a dynamic presence of an evolving human person of intellectual <b>and</b> <b>moral</b> integrity, as a reflection of the poet's self-perception. By sample analyses and comparisons, my exposition substantiates the claim that Dante's text exemplifies the distinct and identifiable literary mode to which I refer as 'Exilic Discourse'...|$|R
40|$|Mark Rowlands argues some {{non-human}} {{animals can}} be moral subjects that can act for moral reasons, but cannot be moral agents {{because they lack}} sufficient understanding for responsibility.

Moral autonomy is an ideal to which some humans can aim.

I argue that although under certain conditions stimulant drug treatment may increase the risk of a threat to authenticity, there are ways to minimise this risk and to maximise the benefits of stimulant drug treatment. Medical professionals in particular should help children to flourish with stimulant drug treatments, in good and in bad conditions...|$|E

She is also cited for her critique of Lockean arguments for intellectual property, for her efforts to develop a non-comparative alternative theory of harm, and for her argument that the federal law authorizing exploitative penalty fees for minor breaches of credit card contracts violates constitutional due process guarantees against disproportionate punitive damages.|$|R

40|$|Unauthorized {{immigrants}} and immigration enforcement {{are once again}} {{at the center of}} heated public debates and reform agendas. This paper examines the importance of applying a subject-centered approach to understanding immigration noncompliance and to developing effective, ethical, and equitable immigration policies. In general, a subject-centered approach focuses on the beliefs, values, and perceptions of individuals whose behavior the law seeks to regulate. This approach has been widely used in non-immigration law contexts to produce a richer and more nuanced understanding of legal noncompliance. By contrast, the subject-centered approach has been an overlooked and underappreciated tool in the study of immigration noncompliance. This paper argues that a subject-centered understanding of why people obey or disobey the law has the potential to generate new insights that can advance public knowledge and inform public policy on immigration in a number of important ways. Specifically, the paper considers how the use of this approach might help us: (1) recognize the basic humanity <b>and</b> <b>moral</b> <b>agency</b> of unauthorized immigrants, (2) appreciate not only direct and immediate costs of immigration enforcement policies, but also their indirect and long-term costs, and (3) develop new and innovative strategies to achieving desired policy goals...|$|E
