40|$|Despite {{the many}} {{existing}} crosslinking procedures, glutaraldehyde (GA) {{is still the}} method of choice used {{in the manufacture of}} bioprosthesis. The major problems with GA are: (a) uncontrolled reactivity due to the chemical complexity or GA solutions; (b) toxicity due to the release of GA from polymeric crosslinks; and (c) tissue impermeabilization due to polymeric and heterogeneous crosslinks formation, partially responsible for the undesirable calcification of the bioprosthesis. A new method of crosslinking glutaraldehyde acetals has been developed with GA in acid <b>ethanolic</b> <b>solution,</b> and after the distribution inside de matrix, GA is released to crosslinking. Concentrations of hydrochloride acid in <b>ethanolic</b> <b>solutions</b> between 0. 1 and 0. 001 mol/L with GA concentration between 0. 1 and 1. 0 % were measured in an ultraviolet spectrophotometer to verify the presence of free aldehyde groups and polymeric compounds of GA.
