5|$|Appeals to nonviolent {{resistance}} were unsuccessful. On September 11, 1791, {{a recently}} appointed tax collector named Robert Johnson was tarred and feathered by a disguised gang in Washington County. A man sent by officials to serve court warrants to Johnson's attackers was whipped, tarred, and feathered. Because {{of these and}} other violent attacks, the tax went uncollected in 1791 and early 1792. The attackers modeled their actions on the protests of the American Revolution. Supporters of the excise argued that there was <b>a</b> <b>difference</b> <b>between</b> taxation without representation in colonial America, and a tax laid by the elected representatives of the American people.|$|E
5|$|It {{should be}} noted that the {{relative}} atomic mass of the electron Ar(e) is measured relative to the mass of a carbon-12 atom (divided by 12). When the Avogadro constant is set in the new SI, atomic masses might be measured in dalton (by fixing the Avogadro constant), instead of atomic mass units (by fixing the mass of carbon-12), thus resulting in <b>a</b> <b>difference</b> <b>between</b> the values of the relative atomic mass and the atomic mass in units of dalton.|$|E

This {{included}} the 1997 National Invitation Tournament title and the 1998 Big Ten Tournament title. It also vacated its two Final Four games in 1992 and its entire NCAA tournament record in 1993, 1996 and 1998. There is <b>a</b> <b>difference</b> <b>between</b> forfeiting {{a game and}} vacating a game; a vacated game does not result in the other school being credited with a win. This included virtually the entire career of Fisher's successor, Brian Ellerbe. However, it did not include all games that Webber played or was eligible because all but the final two games of his freshman year were retained.|$|E

5|$|A careful {{examination}} of Facsimile No. 2 {{shows that there}} is <b>a</b> <b>difference</b> <b>between</b> most of the hieroglyphic signs and the signs on the right third of the figure on the outer edge {{as well as the}} outer portions of the sections numbered 12–15. These signs are hieratic, not hieroglyphic, and are inverted, or upside down, {{to the rest of the}} text. In fact, they are a fairly accurate copy of lines 2, 3, and 4 of the Joseph Smith Papyrus XI, which contains a portion of the Book of Breathings. Especially clear is the word snsn, in section 14, and part of the name of the mother of the owner of the papyrus, (tay-)uby.t, repeated twice on the outer edge. An ink drawing of the hypocephalus in the Church Historian's office shows these same areas as being blank. It is likely that these portions were destroyed on the original hypocephalus and someone (the engraver, one of Joseph Smith's associates, or Joseph himself) copied the lines from the Book of Breathings papyrus for aesthetic purposes.|$|E
5|$|English pronouns {{conserve}} many {{traits of}} case and gender inflection. The personal pronouns retain <b>a</b> <b>difference</b> <b>between</b> subjective and objective case in most persons (I/me, he/him, she/her, we/us, they/them) {{as well as}} a gender and animateness distinction in the third person singular (distinguishing he/she/it). The subjective case corresponds to the Old English nominative case, and the objective case is used both {{in the sense of the}} previous accusative case (in the role of patient, or direct object of a transitive verb), and in the sense of the Old English dative case (in the role of a recipient or indirect object of a transitive verb). Subjective case is used when the pronoun is the subject of a finite clause, and otherwise the objective case is used. While grammarians such as Henry Sweet and Otto Jespersen noted that the English cases did not correspond to the traditional Latin based system, some contemporary grammars, for example , retain traditional labels for the cases, calling them nominative and accusative cases respectively.|$|E
5|$|Standard cards can be {{purchased}} at vending machines within all Metrorail stations, at Metro sales offices, selected retail stores, and online. The purchase price includes $2 for the card itself plus an initial fare value, which varies depending on where they are purchased: cards purchased at stations cost $10 ($2 for the card and $8 fare value), while those purchased online cost either $10 or $30 ($2 for the card and $8 or $28 fare value). The cards can be reloaded using farecard vending machines or using cash at fareboxes onboard buses. Until 2016, riders could also add value to their SmarTrip cards by trading in paper farecards (a used farecard up to $20, or an unused farecard of any value). There is <b>a</b> <b>difference</b> <b>between</b> SmarTrip and CharmCard on the maximum value that can be stored on the card.

40|$|This study {{compared}} {{high school}} student’s perceptions {{of technology and}} technological literacy to those perceptions of the general public. Additionally, individual student groups were compared statistically to determine significant <b>differences</b> <b>between</b> the groups. The ITEA/Gallup Poll instrument was used to survey high school student’s perceptions of technology in the study. The student population in question consisted of three subgroups: students enrolled in a standards-based technology education courses, students enrolled in a Project Lead the Way (PLTW) Principles of Engineering pre-engineering course, and students enrolled in a general education course (language arts, mathematics, or science). In addition, each student group’s perceptions of technology were compared to one another to determine differences within each group. Responses from 4 items in the ITEA/Gallup Poll showed descriptive <b>differences</b> <b>between</b> students and adults, and responses from 13 items showed <b>a</b> significant <b>difference</b> <b>between</b> the three student groups. Of those 13 items showing <b>a</b> significant <b>difference</b> <b>between</b> all three groups, 7 of the 13 items showed <b>a</b> significant <b>difference</b> <b>between</b> technology education and PLTW respondents, 6 of the 13 items showed <b>a</b> significant <b>difference</b> <b>between</b> PLTW and general education respondents, and 8 of the 13 items showed <b>a</b> significant <b>difference</b> <b>between</b> technology education and general education group respondents...|$|R
