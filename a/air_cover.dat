5|$|A-10s of the 23rd TFW were {{deployed}} to Bridgetown, Barbados during Operation Urgent Fury, the American Invasion of Grenada.

5|$|As the Khmer Rouge had no {{air force}} and only limited {{anti-aircraft}} capability, no fleet <b>air</b> <b>cover</b> was necessary, but the evacuation was supported by USAF aircraft based in Thailand. It was suspected that the Khmer Rouge might possess SA-7 shoulder-launched surface to air missiles and so the evacuation helicopters were painted with infra-red low-reflective paint and equipped with ALE-29 flare dispensers.|$|E
5|$|By this point, the British {{high command}} had {{realised}} {{that they could}} not hold the Germans in southern Norway. The evacuation of Allied troops from Molde and Åndalsnes began, with Ark Royal providing <b>air</b> <b>cover</b> from 30 April. On 1 May, the Germans tried to sink the carrier, with numerous air attacks through the day. Ark Royals fighters and a heavy anti-aircraft barrage drove off the enemy, and although several bombs were dropped at the carrier, none impacted. The evacuation was completed on 3 May, and the carrier was recalled to Scapa Flow to refuel and rearm before returning to Norway. While in port, Captain Arthur Power left the ship for a promotion to the Admiralty, and was replaced by Captain Cedric Holland. On return to Norway, Ark Royal was told to provide <b>air</b> <b>cover</b> for operations around Narvik, including the landing of French troops on 13 May. She was joined on 18 May by the carriers Glorious and Furious.|$|E

5|$|Cunningham, {{realising}} that an {{air attack}} could weaken the Italians, ordered {{an attack by}} the Formidables Albacore torpedo-bombers.

Cunningham gave the order to pursue the Italian Fleet.|$|E
5|$|During the Evacuation of Greece, Formidable {{provided}} <b>air</b> <b>cover</b> for Convoy GA-15 on 29 April. A Fulmar from 803 Squadron {{was forced}} to ditch on 2 May before the carrier returned to Alexandria the next day. She put to sea on 6 May to provide <b>air</b> <b>cover</b> for the convoys involved in Operation Tiger. On the morning of 8 May, a pair of Fulmars claimed to have shot down a pair of Z.1007s searching for the fleet; one Fulmar failed to return. Later that afternoon, the fighters shot down four German Heinkel He 111 bombers {{at the cost of}} one Fulmar forced to crash-land. Two Albacores and a Fulmar crashed due to non-combat causes during the day. The next day a pair of Fulmars from 806 Squadron badly damaged a Ju 88 reconnaissance bomber that crash-landed at its base in Sicily. As the fleet and the Tiger convoy approached Alexandria on 11 May, a pair of Fulmars attacked a formation of Ju 88s, damaging one bomber; one Fulmar and another Ju 88 were seen falling together towards the sea. Many of the Fulmars had been rendered unserviceable during the operation and Formidable was unable to provide <b>air</b> <b>cover</b> until they were repaired.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to major conflicts, USMC AV-8Bs {{have been deployed}} in support of contingency and humanitarian operations, providing fixed-wing <b>air</b> <b>cover</b> and armed reconnaissance. The aircraft served in Somalia throughout the 1990s, Liberia (1990, 1996, and 2003), Rwanda (1994), Central African Republic (1996), Albania (1997), Zaire (1997), and Sierra Leone (1997).|$|E

50|$|Easy Cheese is the {{trademark}} for a processed cheese spread product distributed by Mondelēz International.

Easy Cheese is packaged in metal can filled with <b>air</b> <b>covered</b> with a plastic cap that reveals a straight, flexible nozzle where the cheese is extruded.|$|R
5|$|JG 1's {{role was}} to provide <b>air</b> <b>cover</b> over {{a large portion of}} the North Sea coastline. Its {{commander}} was Oberstleutnant Carl-August Schumacher.

5|$|Taking {{advantage}} of dusk, at 17:50 four Sa'iqa battalions were airdropped {{deep into the}} Sinai by helicopters flying at low altitude.

5|$|Aided by NATO <b>air</b> <b>cover,</b> {{the rebel}} militia pushed westward, {{defeating}} loyalist armies and securing {{control of the}} centre of the country. Gaining the support of Amazigh (Berber) communities of the Nafusa Mountains, who had long been persecuted as non-Arabic speakers under Gaddafi, the NTC armies surrounded Gaddafi loyalists in several key areas of western Libya. In August, the rebels seized Zliten and Tripoli, ending the last vestiges of Gaddafist power.|$|E
5|$|Argus was recommissioned and {{partially}} modernised {{shortly before the}} Second World War {{and served as a}} training ship for deck-landing practice until June 1940. The following month she made the first of her many ferry trips to the Western Mediterranean to fly off fighters to Malta; she was largely occupied in this task for the next two years. The ship also delivered aircraft to Murmansk in Russia, Takoradi on the Gold Coast, and Reykjavík in Iceland. By 1942, the Royal Navy was very short of aircraft carriers and Argus was pressed into front-line service despite her lack of speed and armament. In June, she participated in Operation Harpoon, providing <b>air</b> <b>cover</b> for the Malta-bound convoy. In November, the ship provided <b>air</b> <b>cover</b> during Operation Torch, the invasion of French North Africa, and was lightly damaged by a bomb. After returning to the UK for repairs, Argus was used again for deck-landing practice until late September 1944. In December, she became an accommodation ship and was listed for disposal in mid-1946. Argus was sold in late 1946 and scrapped the following year.|$|E

5|$|As Ironside was a {{marginal}} operation, {{and they were}} worried about exposing agents as false, the Twenty Committee for the most part utilised less important agents and added words of caution to the messages they sent, reducing the impact of the story. Allied landings around Bordeaux may also have seemed implausible because it was beyond <b>air</b> <b>cover</b> from the UK and lacked the normal physical elements (such as naval activities and dummy landing craft) associated with an invasion.|$|E
5|$|At the bridge, Frost's forces {{continued}} to hold but without supply or reinforcement their position was becoming weaker. The Germans—realising that infantry attacks were unlikely to remove the stubborn defenders—began to systematically destroy the houses the British were in using tanks, artillery and mortars. In {{the absence of any}} Allied <b>air</b> <b>cover,</b> the Luftwaffe were able to make strafing runs on the British occupied houses as well.|$|E
