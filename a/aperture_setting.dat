25|$|Aperture {{priority}} is a semi-automatic shooting mode used in cameras. It permits the photographer to select an <b>aperture</b> <b>setting</b> {{and let the}} camera decide the shutter speed and sometimes also ISO sensitivity for the correct exposure. This is {{also referred to as}} Aperture Priority Auto Exposure, A mode, AV mode (aperture-value mode), or semi-auto mode.|$|E
25|$|Motion {{pictures}} {{make only}} limited {{use of this}} control; to produce a consistent image quality from shot to shot, cinematographers usually choose a single <b>aperture</b> <b>setting</b> for interiors and another for exteriors, and adjust exposure {{through the use of}} camera filters or light levels. Aperture settings are adjusted more frequently in still photography, where variations in depth of field are used to produce a variety of special effects.|$|E
25|$|The word stop is {{sometimes}} confusing {{due to its}} multiple meanings. A stop can be a physical object: an opaque part of an optical system that blocks certain rays. The aperture stop is the <b>aperture</b> <b>setting</b> that limits {{the brightness of the}} image by restricting the input pupil size, while a field stop is a stop intended to cut out light that would be outside the desired field of view and might cause flare or other problems if not stopped.|$|E
40|$|An {{improved}} multiple circular array (MCA) configuration {{is proposed}} for sparse aperture (SA) optical imaging systems. Using genetic algorithms, the practical cutoff frequency (PCOF), {{based on the}} modulation transfer function for the array, is selected as the fitness function. Moreover, the parameters, such as diameters of <b>aperture</b> <b>sets,</b> spacing between the <b>aperture</b> <b>sets,</b> and relative rotation angles between <b>aperture</b> <b>sets</b> on different concentric circles, are calculated. Improved MCA configurations, with aperture numbers of 6, 9, 12, 10, 15, 11, and 13, are given. Golay arrays, MCAs, a single annular aperture, and improved arrays with the same fill factor are compared. The {{results show that the}} improved array has highest PCOF of all the SA arrays, smoother coverage in Fourier space, and better midfrequency contrast than MCAs. Consequently, the improved array is a promising aperture configuration that can approximate a single annular aperture. © 2017 Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers (SPIE). </p...|$|R

50|$|Exposure {{metering}} is through-the-lens (TTL) {{and thus}} {{accounts for the}} <b>aperture</b> <b>set</b> on the lens in use. (Unlike SLR lenses, where the diaphragm controlling lens aperture is generally closed only {{at the time of}} shutter release, rangefinder camera lenses close or open the diaphragm directly as the aperture control is applied).|$|R
2500|$|In photography, stops {{are also}} a unit used to {{quantify}} ratios of light or exposure, with each added stop meaning a factor of two, and each subtracted stop meaning a factor of one-half. The one-stop unit {{is also known as}} the EV (exposure value) unit. On a camera, the <b>aperture</b> <b>setting</b> is traditionally adjusted in discrete steps, known as f-stops. Each [...] "stop" [...] is marked with its corresponding f-number, and represents a halving of the light intensity from the previous stop. This corresponds to a decrease of the pupil and aperture diameters by a factor of 1/ or about 0.7071, and hence a halving of the area of the pupil.|$|E

5000|$|Like the [...] "crippled" [...] KAF mount used on {{previous}} Pentax digital SLRs, the [...] "crippled" [...] KAF2 lacks the mechanism to mechanically sense a lens's <b>aperture</b> ring <b>setting.</b> For that reason, {{when using the}} manual aperture ring on K-mount lenses, {{it is necessary to}} <b>set</b> the 'Use <b>aperture</b> ring' <b>setting</b> in the 'Custom Menu' to 'Permitted' and use stop-down metering mode (Pentax calls it optical preview) to ensure proper exposure. KA and KAF lenses with aperture rings are fully compatible when the <b>aperture</b> ring is <b>set</b> to automatic ('A'), giving control over the aperture to the camera body.|$|R
50|$|To {{take the}} photograph, the {{photographer}} pulls back the ground glass and slides the film holder into its place. The shutter is then closed and cocked, the shutter speed and <b>aperture</b> <b>set.</b> The photographer removes the darkslide {{that covers the}} sheet of film in the film holder, and triggers the shutter to make the exposure. Finally, the photographer replaces the darkslide and removes the film holder with the exposed film.|$|R
5000|$|The {{camera is}} {{compatible}} with all K mount lenses; K mount lenses started being made in 1975. Lenses without the [...] "A" [...] <b>aperture</b> <b>setting</b> will only meter properly using stop-down metering. Manual focus lenses will continue to function as manual-focus only.|$|E
5000|$|Used as an {{indicator}} of camera settings, EV corresponds to actual combinations of shutter speed and <b>aperture</b> <b>setting.</b> When the actual EV matches that recommended by the light level and the ISO speed, these settings should result in the [...] "correct" [...] exposure.|$|E

50|$|The Lurie-Houghton uses a {{spheroidal}} {{primary mirror}} unlike the paraboidal mirror {{used in the}} Newtonian telescope. A spheroidal mirror {{is much easier to}} make because the entire surface appears to evenly black out when tested with a Foucault tester. In the Houghton and the Lurie-Houghton, the radius of curvature of the primary mirror is slightly less than that of the total system. The diameter of the primary mirror should be larger than the <b>aperture</b> <b>set</b> by the corrector to avoid vignetting.|$|R

50|$|These are {{adaptors}} {{designed by}} Tamron {{to allow the}} transfer of <b>aperture</b> <b>setting</b> from lens to camera or vice verse, including the Adapt-A-matic (1969), Adaptall (1973) and Adaptall-2 (1979). When Pentax introduced the KA-mount in 1983 Tamron upgraded their Adaptall-2 K-mount into an Adaptall-2 KA-mount. For more details see the Tamron article or the Adaptall-2 web site.|$|E
50|$|Cameras {{can perform}} autobracketing by {{adjusting}} either the shutter speed (typically in aperture priority mode, sometimes also in manual or program mode) or the <b>aperture</b> <b>setting</b> (typically in shutter priority mode). In programmed exposure mode, many cameras will alter both parameters {{at the same}} time. Some cameras allow to swap the parameter used for shifting in manual mode. Digital cameras may also alter the ISO setting if auto-ISO is enabled.|$|E
50|$|The R6 is manual {{exposure}} only, with a Leica developed and manufactured mechanical shutter. Aimed at professional photographers and significantly {{more expensive than}} the R5, the R6 depended on batteries only for 2 functions: exposure metering and the electronic self-timer, everything else could be used without power. Meter modes were selective and integrated (centre weighted) including TTL flash exposure. Viewfinder backlighting was provided which also illuminated the <b>aperture</b> <b>setting.</b>|$|E
5000|$|In 1966 Asahi Optical showed another {{prototype}} called Metalica, {{sometimes referred}} to as Metallica II. Gone was the cumbersome selenium light meter, replaced with a now standard internal CdS meter. Like the 1960 prototype, the Metalica had a bayonet lens mount, and also featured an improved Copal-square metallic shutter. But the biggest innovation was the fully automatic shutter operation coupled to the TTL meter. The metering system, {{for the first time in}} a 35mm SLR, controlled the shutter speed automatically based on the <b>aperture</b> <b>set.</b> With these innovative developments, the Metalica pioneered features that would not surface on Pentax production cameras until the Electro-Spotmatic (ES) (automatic aperture-priority exposure) in 1971 and K2 (vertical metal shutter, bayonet lens mount, automatic aperture-priority exposure) in 1975.

40|$|A large astronomical telescope, {{termed the}} Space Telescope, is {{expected}} to be placed in orbit in the early 1980 's. It will be operated as an international observatory that will enable astronomers to detect electromagnetic radiation over a much broader spectrum than is possible from ground observatories. The image quality (not degraded by atmospheric effects) will be limited only by the quality of the optics and by aperture diffraction. This opportunity to approach diffraction-limited imagery on an astronomical telescope of this size (2. 4 -m <b>aperture)</b> <b>sets</b> unusually stringent tolerances on the optical quality. The budgeting and control of these qualities throughout the design, fabrication, assembly, and operation of the Space Telescope is described. A feedback control system which will maintain the telescope at peak performance in the orbital environment is examined...|$|R

50|$|Industrial F-mount lenses have varying, often small, film/sensor coverage.
