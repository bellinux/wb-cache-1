Under Article 39(1)(b) of the Constitution which {{was introduced by}} the constitutional <b>amendment</b> <b>Act,</b> {{the maximum number of}} NCMPs was set at six. However, the actual number that could be declared elected at any general election was fixed at three, less the total number of Opposition MPs elected to Parliament. The President, acting on the advice of the Cabinet, could order that between four and six NCMPs be declared elected for the purpose of a particular general election. Such an order ceased to have effect at the next dissolution of Parliament. On 1 July 2010, the need for a presidential order {{to increase the number of}} NCMPs was removed. Instead, the maximum number of NCMPs in Parliament was increased from six to nine, and the actual number that would be declared elected following a general election would be nine less the number of opposition MPs elected to Parliament.|$|E

Section8B(1) of the amended ISA provides {{that the law}} pertaining to the judicial review of decisions made by the President or the Minister was restored to the legal position applicable in Singapore on 13 July 1971, the date when Lee Mau Seng was decided.

5|$|Section 8B(2) {{contained}} an ouster clause that restricted {{the scope of}} judicial review to any question relating to compliance with any procedural requirements of the ISA governing acts or decisions by the President or the Home Affairs Minister. The amendments to the ISA were made retrospective by section 8D, which meant that they applied to judicial review proceedings that had been started before the <b>amendment</b> <b>Act</b> came into force. In addition, the Constitution was amended through the Constitution of the Republic of Singapore (<b>Amendment)</b> <b>Act</b> 1989 to prevent the Internal Security (<b>Amendment)</b> <b>Act</b> 1989 from being challenged as unconstitutional. Article 149(3) was inserted into the Constitution, with the effect that {{if the issue of}} whether any executive decision made pursuant to the ISA came before a court (whether before or after this constitutional amendment came into force on 27 January 1989), the court had to decide this issue according to the new provisions introduced by the 1989 ISA amendments. Article 149(1) was amended to add Articles 11 and 12 to the list of fundamental liberties that the ISA cannot be challenged against, and to extend its immunizing effect to the 1989 ISA amendments.|$|E
