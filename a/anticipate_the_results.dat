40|$|Cavitation {{mediated}} {{effects in}} liquids exposed to ultrasound, play pivotal roles {{in a number}} of industrial arenas, including precision acoustic cleaning (megasonics) and sonochemistry. The spontaneous occurrence of cavitation, and the subsequent interaction with the liquid and the acoustic field, is however poorly understood, which prevents optimization for any given application. In this paper we report on observations made of single isolated cavitation-bubble clouds, exposed to a well characterized burst of propagating focused ultrasound, and the resulting translational motion of the clouds under the action of the primary acoustic radiation force. As may be expected, larger clouds develop under higher intensity insonations, which translate away from the ultrasound source more rapidly, although a larger associated drag force somewhat tempers the effect. Critically, however, a resonant condition is identified whereby small clouds at lower intensities translate much more rapidly than might otherwise be expected. A model is derived from first principles, adapted to the experimental conditions and demonstrates good agreement with the observations, including the frequency resonance. We <b>anticipate</b> <b>the</b> <b>results</b> will have significance for any application in which understanding and predicting a dynamic cavitating liquid is important, particularly under non-standing wave conditions...|$|E

40|$|Deep {{precision}} {{strike is}} a generic military operation that depends importantly on C 4 /ISR system contributions. Information from {{the latter is}} realistically subject to chance influences: targets are found and correctly identified generally at rates proportional to their numbers, locations, and activities, and to the coverage of shooter-serving sensors; the events of detection are realistically random, as are the delays, results, outcomes, and follow-up of the targeting shooters. In this paper a simplified version of the above complicated process is analyzed mathematically, here as a multi-stage queuing process with imperfect service. The probabilistic outcomes {{can be used to}} <b>anticipate</b> <b>the</b> <b>results</b> of higher-resolution simulations; these often are far more time consuming both to set up and run. Aspects of the above queuing situations can also be deduced via a deterministic 'fluid' queuing approximation that gives an adequate and convenient representation of aspects of the state variables and various Measures of Effectiveness in the stochastic queuing model. Relying on that agreement, we have elsewhere generalized the stochastic queuing model setup to fluid models that incorporate omitted realities, such as losses from target-list tracking, and the inevitable time dependencies, non- stationarities, and adaptive behaviors that typically occur in actual military operations or vignettes. Both the stochastic and deterministic model results are informative and produce reasonable insights. Further validation steps using mathematical probability techniques as well as simulation are planned; some are in progress.

We explore the feasibility of implementing medical linear array imaging technology as a viable ultrasonic-based nondestructive evaluation method to inspect and characterize complex materials. As an initial step toward the application of linear array imaging technology to the interrogation of a wide range of complex composite structures, we present images obtained using an unmodified medical ultrasonic imaging system of two epoxy-bonded aluminum plate specimens, each with intentionally disbonded regions. These images are compared with corresponding conventional ultrasonic contact transducer measurements in order to assess whether these images can detect disbonded regions and provide information regarding the nature of the disbonded region.

The effect of the replacement phenomena is very variable in different Countries and depends on {{one or more of}} several factors i. e. serotype before PCV 7 implementation, PCV 7 coverage, period from PCV implementation, vaccination schedule, antibiotic use, etc. The long-term epidemiological picture in Europe regarding serotype change is limited because of the relatively recent introduction of PCV 7 - the majority of European Countries have only experienced PCV implementation since 2006 - and the difficulty in reaching very high vaccination coverage. In May 2003, a large-scale program of vaccination against Streptococcus pneumoniae with PCV 7 was started in Liguria achieving coverage higher than 90 %. The results of this program <b>anticipate</b> <b>the</b> <b>results</b> likely to be achieved when high coverage has been reached in Europe for a period of several years.

40|$|Some {{practical}} {{criteria for}} free-will are suggested where free-will {{is a matter}} of degree. It is argued that these are more appropriate than some extremely idealised conceptions. Thus although the paper takes lessons from philosophy it avoids idealistic approaches as irrelevant. A mechanism for allowing an agent to meet these criteria is suggested: that of facilitating the gradual emergence of free-will in the brain via an internal evolutionary process. This meets the requirement that not only must the choice of action be free but also choice in the method of choice, and choice in the method of choice of the method of choice etc. This is directly analogous to the emergence of life from non-life. Such an emergence of indeterminism with respect to the conditions of the agent fits well with the `Machiavellian Intelligence Hypothesis' which posits that our intelligence evolved (at least partially) to enable us to deal with social complexity and modelling `arms races'. There is a clear evolutionary advantage in being internally coherent in seeking to fulfil ones goals and unpredictable by ones peers. To fully achieve this vision several other aspects of cognition are necessary: open-ended strategy development; the meta-evolution of the evolutionary process; the facility to <b>anticipate</b> <b>the</b> <b>results</b> of strategies; and the situating of this process in a society of competitive peers. Finally the requirement that reports of the deliberations that lead to actions need to be socially acceptable leads to the suggestion that the language that the strategies are developed within be subject to a normative process in parallel with the development of free-will.

30|$|In Steffe and Cobbâ€™s (1988) {{study with}} K- 2 {{students}} {{in which the}} number sequences were first theorized, operating with a TNS {{was thought to be}} a transitional stage that students would move through quickly as various tacit quantitative relationships were made explicit upon repeated exposure and reflection. In Steffe and Oliveâ€™s (2010) work with grade 3 â€“ 5 students, the stage associated with construction of a TNS clearly lasted many months but was still seen as transitional. In working with middle-grade students (Ulrich, 2012; Ulrich & Phillips, 2015), we have begun to suspect that some students remain at this stage for multiple years: We have found students who can utilize composite units in unexpected ways, implying a great familiarity with composite units, and yet have not yet moved to the next stage of unit construction and coordination (Ulrich, 2016 b). One indication of a studentâ€™s familiarity with composite units is an ability to <b>anticipate</b> <b>the</b> <b>results</b> of constructing composite units before they construct them.

Despite this anticipatory use of composite units, {{the fact that they are}} constrained to the stage associated with the TNS is made clear through several serious constraints in their mathematical thinking (see Ulrich, 2016 b). Because we are interested in what percentage of middle-grade students are constrained to these kinds of advanced operations with a TNS, we broke the stage associated with a TNS into two substages when designing the written assessment: (1) students who are still early in the stage (eTNS students) and (2) students who can do advanced operations within this stage (aTNS students).|$|E

This review highlights {{the latest developments in}} this area, explains the interface between these in silico tools and the experimental implementation tools of metabolic engineers, and provides a way forward so that in silico predictions can better mimic reality and more experimental methods can be considered in simulation studies. The several methodologies for solving genome-scale models (eg, flux balance analysis [FBA], parsimonious FBA, flux variability analysis, and minimization of metabolic adjustment) all have unique advantages and applications. There are two basic approaches to designing metabolic engineering strategies in silico, and both have demonstrated success in the literature. The first involves: 1) making a genetic manipulation in a model; 2) testing for improved performance through simulation; and 3) iterating the process. The second approach has been used in more recently designed in silico tools and involves: 1) comparing metabolic flux profiles of a wild-type and ideally engineered state and 2) designing engineering strategies based on the differences in these flux profiles. Improvements in genome-scale modeling are anticipated in areas such as the inclusion of all relevant cellular machinery, the ability to understand and <b>anticipate</b> <b>the</b> <b>results</b> of combinatorial enrichment experiments, and constructing dynamic and flexible biomass equations that can respond to environmental and genetic manipulations.

40|$|An ether is {{an organic}} {{compound}} {{that consists of}} an oxygen atom bonded to two alkyl or aryl groups. In this work, we investigate the bimolecular dehydration of two alcohols, n-propanol and methanol with catalysts {{that are used in}} transesterification. Experiments were carried out to evaluate the feasibility of promoting etherification reaction using methanol and n-propanol as model alcohols. When methanol and n-propanol are reacted together, three types of ethers can be produced; i. e., dimethyl ether, methyl-propyl ether (also referred to as methoxypropane), and di-propyl ether. The latter two ethers are of more fuel interest due to their ability to stay in liquid phase at room temperature; however, the ability of catalysts to selectively produce liquid ethers is not established. Initial studies were conducted to discern the effect of sulfuric acid, amberlyst- 36 and titanium isopropoxide, catalysts that are known to be effective for transesterification, at four levels of temperature on the substrate conversion, ether yield and selectivity using n-propanol. Subsequent studies with n-propanol and methanol additionally looked at the impact of select catalyst concentrations and reaction conditions. Studies indicate that liquid mixtures of 1 -methoxypropane and di-propyl ethers could be formed by reacting n-propanol and methanol in the presence of sulfuric acid or Amberlyst 36. Higher concentrations of sulfuric acid (5 % w/w) coupled with higher temperatures (> 140 Â°C) favored substrate conversion and ether yields. However, it was revealed that the selectivity toward specific ethers, i. e., coupling of the two larger alcohols to produce di-propyl ether vs larger one with the smaller one to produce methoxypropane could be controlled by appropriate selection of the catalyst. We <b>anticipate</b> <b>the</b> <b>results</b> being a starting point for a simple technique to produce specific ethers using a mixture of alcohols that could be applied for applications such as transesterification byproduct utilization...|$|E

By means of gravity models, it studies the determinants of the internationalization of inventive activity between a group of industrialized countries and a sample of developing and emerging economies. The paper examines in detail the influence exerted by skilled diasporas in fostering cross-country co-inventorship as well as R&D offshoring. The study finds a strong and robust relationship between inventor diaspora and different forms of international co-patenting. However, the effect is decreasing {{with the level of}} formality of the interactions. Interestingly, some of the most successful diasporas lately documented ? namely, Chinese and Indian ones ? do not govern the results. Migrant networks may smooth the obstacles to the internationalization of inventive activity. They create trust across national boundaries, provide information on market opportunities and, in general, reduce transaction costs of economic interactions between countries. Diaspora networks have been studied in the context of trade (Gould, 1994), FDI (Javorcik et al., 2011; Kugler and Rapoport, 2007), and international diffusion of ideas (Agrawal et al., 2011; Kerr, 2008). In parallel, numerous papers have investigated the internationalization of R&D activities (Guellec and van Pottelsberghe de la Potterie, 2001; Patel and Vega, 1999; Picci, 2010). To the best of my knowledge, however, no study has looked at the role of high-skilled diasporas in fostering international technological collaborations.

40|$|Abstract Background The {{shoulder}} is {{the most}} frequently dislocated joint in the body. Multiple causes and pathologies account for {{the various types of}} shoulder instability. Multi-directional instability (MDI) and multi-directional laxity with antero-inferior instability (MDL-AII) are similar in pathology, less common and more difficult to treat. These instabilities are caused by ligamentous capsular redundancy. When non-operative management fails for these patients, quality of life is significantly impaired and surgical treatment is required to tighten the ligaments and joint capsule. The current reference (gold) standard treatment for MDI/MDL-AII is an open inferior capsular shift (ICS) surgical procedure. An alternative treatment involves arthroscopic thermal shrinkage of redundant capsular tissue to tighten the joint. However, {{there is a lack of}} scientific evidence to support the use of this technique called, electrothermal arthroscopic capsulorrhaphy (ETAC). This trial will compare the effectiveness of ETAC to open ICS in patients with MDI and MDL-AII, using patient-based quality of life outcome assessments. Methods This study is a multi-centre randomized clinical trial with a calculated sample size of 58 patients (p = 0. 05, 80 % power). Eligible patients are clinically diagnosed with MDI or MDL-AII and have failed standardized non-operative management. A diagnostic shoulder arthroscopy is performed to confirm eligibility, followed by intra-operative randomization to the ETAC or ICS surgical procedure. The primary outcome is the disease-specific quality of life questionnaire (Western Ontario Shoulder Instability Index), measured at baseline, 3, 6, 12 and 24 months. Secondary outcomes include shoulder-specific measures (American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons Score and Constant Score). Other outcomes include recurrent instability, complications and operative time. The outcome measurements will be compared on an intention-to-treat basis, using two-sample independent t-tests to assess statistical significance. A Generalized Estimated Equations (GEE) analysis will determine whether there is an effect over time. Discussion This ongoing trial has encountered unexpected operational and practical issues, including slow patient enrollment due to high intra-operative exclusion rates. However, the authors have a greater understanding of multi-directional laxity in the shoulder and <b>anticipate</b> <b>the</b> <b>results</b> of this trial will provide the medical community with the best scientific clinical evidence on the efficacy of ETAC compared to open ICS. </p...|$|E

As it could be <b>anticipated,</b> <b>the</b> <b>results</b> suggest that best thermal performance is generally achieved when the heat extraction path is minimized...|$|R
