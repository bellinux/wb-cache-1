5|$|Paciorek, {{who was the}} {{starting}} right fielder, began the day with <b>a</b> <b>walk</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> second inning. He then had a single in the fourth inning, which drove in Rusty Staub and Bob Aspromonte. After singling and again bringing home Aspromonte in the fifth, Paciorek had <b>a</b> <b>walk</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> sixth, and ended {{the day with a}} leadoff single in the eighth. In total, he went to the plate five times and hit three singles and had two walks, scoring four runs en route to a 134 Houston victory over the New York Mets. He had a perfect major league career batting average and on-base percentage of 1.000 {{as a result of his}} performance that day, something no one else with as many plate appearances as Paciorek has done.|$|E
5|$|The {{inspiration}} for Nemo sprang from multiple experiences, {{going back to}} director Andrew Stanton's childhood, when he loved going to the dentist to see the fish tank, assuming that the fish were from the ocean and wanted to go home. In 1992, shortly after his son was born, {{he and his family}} took a trip to Six Flags Discovery Kingdom (which was called Marine World at the time). There, after seeing the shark tube and various exhibits, he felt that the underwater world could be done beautifully in computer animation. Later, in 1997, he took his son for <b>a</b> <b>walk</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> park, but realized that he was overprotecting him and lost an opportunity to have a father-son experience that day.|$|E

25|$|The tie was broken, however, in {{the bottom}} of the seventh. Chono lead off the inning with a walk and was quickly {{advanced}} to second on a sacrifice bunt from Tetsuya Matsumoto. Two batters later, Shinnosuke Abe hit a single up the middle of the field to earn what proved to be the game-winning RBI. Abe returned to the Giants roster for Game 6 after missing the previous two games because of discomfort in his right leg. Scott Mathieson then threw a scoreless eighth and Tetsuya Yamaguchi earned the save by keeping the Fighters from capitalizing on a hit and <b>a</b> <b>walk</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> ninth.|$|E

25|$|In {{the summer}} of 1992, {{a series of events}} were set in motion by the black metal inner circle. Samoth, along with various other black metallers, set out to burn down the ancient churches of Norway. Also in 1992, Faust lived in Lillehammer, and in the newly {{constructed}} Olympic park a man named Magne Andreassen approached him and suggested that they take <b>a</b> <b>walk</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> nearby forest. Faust agreed, and, once in the forest, Faust claimed the man began to make strong sexual advances towards him. Faust then stabbed the man to death, kicking him in the head afterward to ensure that he was dead. He was not convicted until two years later. The day after Faust committed the murder, he went with Euronymous of Mayhem and Varg Vikernes of Burzum to burn the Holmenkollen Chapel in Oslo. In {{the summer of}} 1993, the band began working on their first full-length album. Emperor ceased wearing corpse paint; they stated that it was becoming a trend and losing its original significance and symbolism. In autumn of that year, the police began to investigate the murder of Euronymous of Mayhem, naming Varg Vikernes as a suspect; this investigation eventually led to the incarceration of Samoth for arson, and of Faust for the murder of Magne Andreassen.|$|E
25|$|In a low-scoring thriller at The County Ground, Derby, Dominic Cork had the {{pleasure}} of beating his old county, though it became a tougher task than expected, considering that Derbyshire had not won a Championship match since 2004. Winning the toss and batting, Derbyshire had a good opening partnership between Australian Michael Di Venuto and Ben France, but Greg Chapple put the pressure on with some patient, economical bowling and reaped the rewards with three wickets for 29. However, it was Cork who got the most wickets, after taking the last three of the innings to finish with four for 40 and send Derbyshire off for 191. Lancashire lost two quick wickets in reply, and were in trouble when Warren Hegg departed at 128 for 6, but a fine innings worth 64 from Cork down the order - along with 24 from Muttiah Muralitharan - sent Lancashire into a 50-run lead. Muralitharan was, indeed, in contention for Man of the Match, bowling 27 overs in succession and taking six for 50 as Derbyshire collapsed to 185, setting a target of 136 to win. Lancashire thought that would be <b>a</b> <b>walk</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> park, especially as Iain Sutcliffe and Mal Loye paired up for 53 for the second wicket, but they then lost seven men for sub-12 scores and were in trouble at 131 for 9. Only Sutcliffe kept his head calm, carrying his bat to 62 not out, and he and Muralitharan managed to add the required five runs.|$|E

[...] "Somehow they blunder on toward their whimsical destination", he remarks, the [...] "seductive and tickling narrative" [...] told with [...] "understatement, self-effacement, savage wit, honed irony, and unrelenting honesty."

Neither film was a critical success, although the latter received some positive reviews and Empire magazine wrote that Thomson was [...] "unforgettable". Later that year, she had a supporting role in John Wells' restaurant-based film Burnt, alongside Bradley Cooper. In 2016, she starred with Brendan Gleeson in the World War II-drama Alone in Berlin, based {{on the story of}} Otto and Elise Hampel.

500|$|Like {{previous}} Sonic Youth albums, A Thousand Leaves {{also contains}} songs {{that deal with}} gender roles and stereotypes. The song [...] "Female Mechanic Now on Duty", sung by band member Kim Gordon, was a reaction to how journalists categorize female musicians. It was inspired by Meredith Brooks's hit [...] "Bitch". Similarly, in [...] "The Ineffable Me", Gordon expressed her opposition to such limitations. The song [...] "Karen Koltrane", sung by Ranaldo, is about a lover from his college days who had [...] "a far less extraordinary adulthood" [...] than he had first thought, while [...] "Hoarfrost", which was originally titled [...] "Woodland Ode", was inspired when Ranaldo and his wife Leah Singer went for <b>a</b> <b>walk</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> snow during a visit they made to Singer's parents in Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada. The track [...] "Sunday" [...] is generally considered the album's most accessible song.

500|$|Pregnant {{and often}} ill, Mary Godwin {{had to cope}} with Percy's joy at the birth of his son by Harriet Shelley in late 1814 and his {{constant}} outings with Claire Clairmont. Shelley and Clairmont were almost certainly lovers, which caused much jealously on Godwin's part. Shelley greatly offended Godwin at one point when during <b>a</b> <b>walk</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> French countryside he suggested that they both take the plunge into a stream naked as it offended her principles. She was partly consoled by the visits of Hogg, whom she disliked at first but soon considered a close friend. Percy Shelley seems to have wanted Mary Godwin and Hogg to become lovers; Mary did not dismiss the idea, since in principle she believed in free love. In practice, however, she loved only Percy Shelley and seems to have ventured no further than flirting with Hogg. On 22 February 1815, she gave birth to a two-months premature baby girl, who was not expected to survive. On 6 March, she wrote to Hogg: ...|$|E

His next start, in game one of the 2003 NL Championship Series against the Chicago Cubs, did not go well as he allowed four runs in the first inning, two of them on a home run by Moisés Alou, and six runs in his 6 [...] innings. The Marlins battled back and won the game in extra innings. The Cubs took the next three games and only needed one more win to take the series when Beckett returned to the mound in game five. He allowed only three Cubs to reach base in the game, on two singles and <b>a</b> <b>walk,</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> complete game shutout to keep his team alive. The Marlins took game six also, thanks partly to the infamous Steve Bartman incident.
