In particular, {{he was interested}} in the possibility that sulphaguanidine (or a related sulphonamide) might be a causal prophylactic against malaria, as they could be manufactured in Australia, unlike atebrin and plasmoquine. Fairley decided to establish a unit in Cairns to investigate malaria. The LHQ Medical Research Unit commenced work in June 1943.|$|E
5|$|Costume {{designer}} Sue Blane was not keen {{on working}} for the film until she became aware that Curry, an old friend, was committed to the project. Curry and Blane had worked together in Glasgow's Citizens Theatre in a production of The Maids, where Curry had worn a woman's corset in the production. Blane arranged it with the theatre to loan her the corset from the other production for Rocky Horror. Blane admits {{that she did not}} conduct research for her designing, had never seen a science fiction film, and is <b>acutely</b> <b>aware</b> that her costumes for Brad and Janet may have been generalizations.|$|E
5|$|She was <b>acutely</b> <b>aware</b> of the {{importance}} of promptly publishing her discoveries and thus establishing her priority. Had not Becquerel, two years earlier, presented his discovery to the Académie des Sciences the day after he made it, credit for the discovery of radioactivity, and even a Nobel Prize, would instead have gone to Silvanus Thompson. Curie chose the same rapid means of publication. Her paper, giving a brief and simple account of her work, was presented for her to the Académie on 12 April 1898 by her former professor, Gabriel Lippmann. Even so, just as Thompson had been beaten by Becquerel, so Curie was beaten in the race to tell of her discovery that thorium gives off rays {{in the same way as}} uranium; two months earlier, Gerhard Carl Schmidt had published his own finding in Berlin.|$|E
5|$|Miller's {{season ended}} early {{after he was}} called back for army service and he was {{stationed}} in the northern suburb of Broadmeadows. However, he had disciplinary problems and disliked taking orders from his officers, whom he often felt were inferior to him. He left the Militia on 8 November 1941. Miller and a friend then attempted to join the Royal Australian Navy (RAN) as stokers. When the navy would not take his friend, Miller tore up his paperwork in protest, left the recruiting office, and walked {{around the corner to}} the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) recruiting office. He was <b>acutely</b> <b>aware</b> of the risks, as many of his playing colleagues had been killed, injured or captured. The threat of combat increased when the Pacific Theatre of World War II opened on 7 December 1941 with the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor. The 194142 cricket season was cancelled and many cricket and football grounds were converted into army bases.|$|E
5|$|No formal {{educational}} {{method was}} applied to the production, and no attempt was made to follow the official UK National Curriculum for primary school history. The show's creators were <b>acutely</b> <b>aware</b> of educational possibilities, but—in line with Deary's overall mandate for the franchise—saw their basic role as popularising history, inspiring further curiosity about the academic subject rather than attempting to teach it seriously. The show's effectiveness in this respect was endorsed by historical scholars, including presenter Dan Snow. Writing in The Independent, Gerard Gilbert notes that Horrible Histories is part of an extensive British black-comedy tradition not only in adult but also in children's programming. In later series, as usable material from the books began to run out, there was a progression towards more sophisticated, adult sketches in terms of both creativity and educational content, as the show began relying on material that their younger viewers would be less familiar with.|$|E

25|$|Ancient Greek {{literature}} especially influenced later Greek literature. For instance, the Greek novels {{influenced the}} later work Hero and Leander, written by Musaeus Grammaticus. Ancient Roman writers were <b>acutely</b> <b>aware</b> {{of the ancient}} Greek literary legacy and many deliberately emulated the style and formula of Greek classics in their own works. The Roman poet Vergil, for instance, modeled his epic poem The Aeneid off The Iliad and The Odyssey.|$|E
25|$|Archduke Charles of Austria-Teschen, himself <b>acutely</b> <b>aware</b> of {{the dire}} {{consequences}} {{of the fall of}} Ulm, was planning to move towards Vienna, in order to reinforce the remains of the Austrian army and link up with the Russians. However, in order to avoid having Masséna's men on his heels, he decided to suddenly turn and face the French, hoping that by defeating them he would ensure the success of his march towards inner Austria.|$|E
25|$|These {{sometimes}} immense gatherings {{fuel the}} ocean food web. Most forage fish are pelagic fish, {{which means they}} form their schools in open water, and not {{on or near the}} bottom (demersal fish). Forage fish are short-lived, and go mostly unnoticed by humans. The predators are keenly focused on the shoals, <b>acutely</b> <b>aware</b> of their numbers and whereabouts, and make migrations themselves, often in schools of their own, that can span thousands of miles to connect with, or stay connected with them.|$|E
25|$|Forage fish {{compensate}} for their small size by forming schools. Some swim in synchronised grids with their mouths open {{so they can}} efficiently filter plankton. These schools can become immense shoals which move along coastlines and migrate across open oceans. The shoals are concentrated fuel resources for the great marine predators. The predators are keenly focused on the shoals, <b>acutely</b> <b>aware</b> of their numbers and whereabouts, and make migrations themselves that can span thousands of miles to connect, or stay connected, with them.|$|E
25|$|The Nazi {{regime was}} <b>acutely</b> <b>aware</b> of the {{political}} necessity of protecting the Reich capital against devastation from the air. Even before the war, work had begun on an extensive system of public air-raid shelters, but by 1939 only 15% of the planned 2,000 shelters had been built. By 1941, however, the five huge public shelters (Zoo, Anhalt Station, Humboldthain, Friedrichshain and Kleistpark) were complete, offering shelter to 65,000 people. Other shelters were built under government buildings, the best-known being the so-called Führerbunker under the Reich Chancellery building. In addition, many U-Bahn stations were converted into shelters. The {{rest of the population}} had to make do with their own cellars.|$|E
25|$|On 2 March 1815, British agents – {{including}} Robert Brownrigg and John D'Oyly – {{met with}} the nobility of the kingdom and concluded in a conference known as the Kandyan Convention. The resulting agreement allowed {{for the protection of}} Buddhism and the preservation of local systems of government under the authority of the British Governor in Colombo and supervised by British agents in Sabaragamuwa, the Three Korales, and Uva. In practice, however, local chiefs such as Ehelepola and Molligoda were <b>acutely</b> <b>aware</b> that they were ultimately answerable to the British, and were in practice junior to British military officers who now had free access to their domains.|$|E

Most forage fish are pelagic fish, {{which means they}} form their schools in open water, {{and not on the}} bottom (benthic fish) or near the bottom (benthopelagic fish). They are short-lived, and go mostly unnoticed by humans, apart from an occasional support role in a documentary about a great ocean predator. While we may not pay them much attention, the great marine predators are keenly focused on them, <b>acutely</b> <b>aware</b> of their numbers and whereabouts, and make migrations that can span thousands of miles to connect with them. After all, forage fish are their food.|$|E
25|$|Aided by a {{favorable}} {{resolution of the}} Linn County Chamber of Commerce, Macpherson was able to help orchestrate a hearing on land use planning before the Linn County Commission, the elected county government authority for rural Linn County. The hearing, at which positive testimony was heard from {{a broad range of}} community figures including the head of the Linn Chamber of Commerce, led to an initial appropriation of $5,000 towards the development of a first building code for the county. A county planning commission was established, with Macpherson recruited as chairman, and in 1967 the first land use zoning hearings for Linn County were held. Macpherson would remain active in the Linn County planning commission's affairs, <b>acutely</b> <b>aware</b> of the rapidly changing land-use planning landscape in Oregon.|$|E
25|$|The Wolfhound {{of today}} {{is far from}} the one that struck fear into the hearts of the Ancient Romans. Irish Wolfhounds are often favored for their loyalty, affection, {{patience}} and devotion. Although at some points in history they have been used as watchdogs, unlike some breeds, the Irish Wolfhound is usually unreliable in this role as they are often friendly toward strangers, although their size can be a natural deterrent. However, when protection is required this dog is never found wanting. When they or their family are in any perceived danger they display a fearless nature. Author and Irish Wolfhound breeder Linda Glover believes the dogs' close affinity with humans makes them <b>acutely</b> <b>aware</b> and sensitive to ill will or malicious intentions leading to their excelling as a guardian rather than guard dog.|$|E
25|$|Maximilian I shared rule {{with his}} father during the latter year of Frederick's reign, being elected King of the Romans in 1486. By {{acquiring}} the lands of the Tyrolean line of the Habsburgs in 1490 he finally reunited all the Austrian lands, divided since 1379. He also needed {{to deal with the}} Hungarian problem when Mathias I died in 1490. Maximilian reconquered the lost parts of Austria and established peace with Mathias's successor Vladislaus II at the Peace of Pressburg in 1491. However the dynastic pattern of division and unification would be one that kept repeating itself over time. With unsettled borders Maximilian found Innsbruck in the Tyrol a safer place for a capital, between his Burgundian and Austrian lands, although he was rarely in any place for very long, being <b>acutely</b> <b>aware</b> of how his father had been repeatedly besieged in Vienna.|$|E
25|$|While Feldmarshalleutnant Klenau {{was being}} ousted from Essling, Archduke Charles {{received}} much-awaited {{news about the}} arrival of his brother on the battlefield. However, the news were disappointing: Archduke John of Austria and his 13,000 men, Charles's only hope for rescuing his collapsing left flank, would {{only be able to}} arrive towards 17:00, much too late to make any difference. By now, Charles was <b>acutely</b> <b>aware</b> that his troops would not hold out much longer. His three corps on the Wagram plateau (I, II and IV) had been in action for some ten hours. On his right, Kollowrat's III Korps, Klenau's VI Korps and the Reserve Korps were being pushed back. Crucially, he had no battle reserves with which to either support his battered line or to launch a counterattack of his own. Continuing to fight in these conditions would have spelled the end of the Kaiserlich-königliche Hauptarmee and, in Charles's view, the end of the Habsburg Empire. His only realistic option was to begin an orderly retreat, which he ordered by mid morning, directing each corps along its line of retreat.|$|E
25|$|Because Shong was illiterate, it is {{sometimes}} assumed that he invented Pahawh ex nihilo. However, Shong was <b>acutely</b> <b>aware</b> of writing and of the advantages that it provided; indeed, that was {{the basis of his}} messianic movement. It would appear that existing scripts provided his inspiration, even if he did not fully understand them, much as the Roman alphabet inspired the illiterate Sequoyah when he invented the Cherokee script, in a process called trans-cultural diffusion. Not only do the forms {{of the majority of the}} letters in the oldest stage of Pahawh closely resemble the letters of the local Lao alphabet and missionary scripts such as Pollard and Fraser, though they are independent in sound value (much like the relationship between Roman and Cherokee), but the appearance of vowel and tone diacritics in those scripts, which would appear nearly random to the illiterate, may explain the idiosyncratic use of diacritics in early Pahawh. Nevertheless, even if the graphic forms of Pahawh letters derive from other scripts, much of the typology of the script, with its primary rimes and secondary onsets, would appear to be Shong's invention.|$|E
25|$|Replaced as Carlist {{political}} leader by marqués de Villores, Larramendi remained {{engaged in the}} party executive; his activity was related to dynastical issues rather than to daily business. In 1922 he represented Don Jaime’s sister, Doña Blanca, in court; wife {{to a member of}} the imperial Habsburg house she refused to recognize the Austrian republic and sought shelter in Spain. Larramendi presented her case when claiming the Spanish citizenship, resulting in a booklet titled Dictamen referente a la nacionalidad de S.A.R. Doña Blanca de Borbón y Borbón. His efforts were crowned with success and Doña Blanca with her family settled in Barcelona. In the future the episode would prove of great value for the Carloctavista dynastic claim, but no source clarifies whether in the early 1920s Larramendi considered her sons would-be claimants to the Spanish throne. It is confirmed, however, that he was <b>acutely</b> <b>aware</b> of the looming dynastical crisis. As Don Jaime, at that time in his early 50s, had no offspring, the Carlist branch was endangered with extinction. Larramendi kept advocating last-minute rescue mission by Don Jaime’s marriage with his niece; the scheme crashed when in 1922 Fabiola Massimo married an Italian aristocrat.|$|E
25|$|France's main adversary {{in central}} Europe was the Austrian Empire. Defeated at Ulm and Austerlitz in 1805 {{and forced to}} {{conclude}} the humiliating Peace of Pressburg, Austria still possessed a formidable army which, {{in the years following}} Austerlitz, had undergone major reforms. By 1809, the state was almost bankrupt and <b>acutely</b> <b>aware</b> that it could not retain its status as a great power if it did not manage to regain some of its former influence in Germany and Italy. Encouraged by Napoleon's peninsular imbroglio, British subsidies and the promise of a military intervention in northern Europe, the Austrians decided that the European political context of 1808 and 1809 offered their best chance to retake lost provinces. In order to win the war against the French, Vienna was counting on massive nationalist, anti-French uprisings throughout Germany and hoping that an early success might convince Prussia to join the new coalition, while calculating that Russia would most likely not interfere in support of the French. Austrian military preparations were accelerated in 1808 and early 1809, with operations set to occur in several war theatres, including the main one in Bavaria and sideshows in Italy, Dalmatia, Westphalia, Tyrol and Poland. In stark contrast to 1805, by 1809 Austria had managed to reform its military and build a relatively modern and overall redoubtable army, placed in the hands of their best commander, Archduke Charles of Austria, brother of Emperor Francis I of Austria.|$|E

For Robert Shelton, who had given Dylan an important boost in his 1961 review in the New York Times, this song was [...] "a landmark in topical, folk-based songwriting. Here blooms the promised fruit of the 1950s poetry-jazz fusion of Ginsberg, Ferlinghetti, and Rexroth." [...] Folk singer Dave Van Ronk later commented: [...] "I was <b>acutely</b> <b>aware</b> that it represented {{the beginning of an}} artistic revolution." [...] Pete Seeger expressed the opinion that this song would last longer than any other written by Dylan.|$|E
500|$|Russell is <b>acutely</b> <b>aware</b> {{that power}} tends to {{coalesce}} {{in the hands}} of a minority, and no less so when it comes to power over opinion. The result is [...] "systematic propaganda", or the monopoly over propaganda by the state. Perhaps surprisingly, Russell avers that the consequences of systematic propaganda are not as dire as one might expect. (Russell 1938:114–115) A true monopoly over opinion leads to careless arrogance among leaders, as well as to indifference to the well-being of the governed, and a lack of credulity on behalf of the governed towards the state. In the long-term, the net result is: ...|$|E
500|$|The French and Indian War {{began in}} 1754 and Adams began to {{struggle}} {{with the issue of}} a young man's responsibility in the conflict; contemporaries of his social position were largely spectators, while those who were less solvent joined the battle as a means to make some money. Adams later said, [...] "I longed more ardently to be a Soldier than I ever did to be a Lawyer."

500|$|While light {{comedy and}} satire might have {{established}} Yiddish theater as a commercially successful medium, it was Goldfaden's higher aspirations for it that eventually earned him recognition as [...] "the Yiddish Shakespeare." [...] As a man broadly read in several languages, he was <b>acutely</b> <b>aware</b> {{that there was}} no Eastern European Jewish tradition of dramatic literature – that his audience was used to seeking just [...] "a good glass of Odobeşti and a song." [...] Years later, he would paraphrase the typical Yiddish theatergoer of the time as saying to him: [...] "We don't go to the theater to make our head swim with sad things. We have enough troubles at home... We go to the theater to cheer ourselves up. We pay up a coin and hope to be distracted, we want to laugh from the heart." ...|$|E

Joel Schumacher once said of him in 2000, [...] "The bad news is that Philip won't be a $25-million star. The good news is that he'll work for the rest of his life". The Aiken Standard of South Carolina referred to him as an [...] "anti-star", whose real identity remained [...] "amorphous and unmoored". Hoffman was <b>acutely</b> <b>aware</b> that he was often too unorthodox for the Academy voters.

I think there are other people who are interested in what I do." ...|$|E
500|$|By December 1915, New Delhi felt it {{necessary}} to put more pressure on the Afghans. Communications between the British Empire and Kabul had been hitherto through the Viceroy at Delhi. <b>Acutely</b> <b>aware</b> of the pressure on Habibullah from his pro-German relatives and the strong anti-British feeling among the tribes, Viceroy Hardinge suggested that a letter from King George might help Habibullah maintain his neutrality. Accordingly, George V personally sent a handwritten letter on Buckingham Palace stationery to Habibullah, praising the Emir for his steadfast neutrality and promising an increase to his subsidy. The letter, which addressed Habibullah as [...] "Your Majesty", was intended to encourage Habibullah and make him feel an equal partner in the Empire. It had the intended effect: Habibullah sent verbal communication through British agents in Kabul that he could not formally acknowledge the letter because of political pressure, but he nonetheless sent reassurances he would remain neutral.|$|E
500|$|The Bond {{books were}} written in post-war Britain, when the country was still an {{imperial}} power. As the series progressed, the British Empire was in decline; journalist William Cook observed that [...] "Bond pandered to Britain's inflated and increasingly insecure self-image, flattering us with the fantasy that Britannia could still punch above her weight." [...] This decline of British power was referred to {{in several of the}} novels; in From Russia, with Love, it manifested itself in Bond's conversations with Darko Kerim, when Bond admits that in England, [...] "we don't show teeth any more—only gums." [...] The theme is strongest in one of the later books of the series, the 1964 novel You Only Live Twice, in conversations between Bond and the head of Japan's secret intelligence service, Tiger Tanaka. Fleming was <b>acutely</b> <b>aware</b> of the loss of British prestige in the 1950s and early 60s, particularly during the Indonesia–Malaysia confrontation, when he had Tanaka accuse Britain of throwing away the empire [...] "with both hands".|$|E
500|$|One of {{his first}} actions as {{president}} was to meet directly with the company's 40department heads and 150other employees. This contrasted starkly with Yamauchi's practice of rarely meeting with employees and generally having a single, annual speech. Shigeru Miyamoto described the previous business atmosphere as [...] "stuffy" [...] and stated Iwata [...] "improved the ventilation." [...] Iwata was <b>acutely</b> <b>aware</b> that his position as president would not ensure compliance from his employees and sought to communicate with them on a personal level. If employees disagreed with his view, Iwata would suggest they follow their idea instead of his own, stating [...] "creators only improve themselves by taking risks." [...] Alongside the increased level of interaction, Iwata also brought more data and science into the business aspect of the company. Whereas Yamauchi made decisions based on intuition and experience, Iwata brought forth hypotheses loaded with data to convey his position. Iwata also promoted Miyamoto, Genyo Takeda, Yoshihiro Mori, and Shinji Hatano to representative directors on the company's board of directors, equaling his own position.|$|E

During a battle, Shino directs his bugs towards an opponent, boxing them in without their knowledge and absorbing their chakra once they have been surrounded. Shino's merciless tendencies, in regards to opponents as well as his attachment to and collection of insects, have caused other characters to label him as [...] "creepy". Nevertheless, Shino cares deeply for his teammates, being <b>acutely</b> <b>aware</b> of their inner workings and always regretting when he is unable to help them. In the series epilogue, Shino becomes a Ninja Academy teacher. In the Japanese anime, his voice actor is Shinji Kawada.

500|$|On 20 August 1934 Downes became Director General of Medical Services (DGMS), a {{full-time}} post and the Army's most senior medical officer. His priority was a recruiting campaign {{to increase the}} number of medical professionals in the Army. [...] The Munich Crisis caused people to believe that another war was imminent, and an Army-wide recruiting campaign led by Major General Sir Thomas Blamey doubled the size of the Army from 35,000 in 1938 to 70,000 in 1939. Downes' efforts at recruiting were far more modest. In 1934, there were 299 part-time officers in the AAMC; by 1939 there were 394, and increase of only 32 per cent. This included 320 medical practitioners, 37 dentists and 13 pharmacists. Downes was <b>acutely</b> <b>aware</b> that a large Army would require mobilisation of the country's doctors, and pushed for all doctors to be prepared for either military service or direction by civil authorities. He presided over a major effort to stockpile drugs and medical equipment required for a mobilisation. With the help of the Department of Health and the Commonwealth Serum Laboratories, most of this was delivered by July 1939.|$|E

When a staff officer complained about shortages, Model snapped: [...] "If you need anything, take it from the Americans". When Ludwig Heilmann warned Model that his command 5th Parachute Division was only a Class IV outfit, Model, who by now must have been surfeited with complaints on lack of equipment and insufficient training, merely replied that success would be won by the paratroopers' [...] "usual audacity."
