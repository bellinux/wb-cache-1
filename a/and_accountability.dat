In the October 2012 elections, he won 24.3 percent {{of the first round}} vote and 74.4 percent of the first-past-the-post runoff, giving him the seat. Another candidate, Karel Berka, challenged the decision, but the Czech Supreme Administrative Court found the claims unfounded.

In the 2014 election, he lost the Democratic primary to Seth Moulton, who went on to hold the seat in the general election.|$|E
5|$|The new {{block grant}} program {{differed}} {{significantly from the}} former Food Stamp program in three major ways. First, the new NAP program was designed to distribute the benefits through physical cheques, ensuring that the benefit would be payable only to the beneficiary {{while at the same}} time reducing administrative costs, since the former physical vouchers (cupones in Spanish) were subject to storage <b>and</b> <b>accountability</b> problems, theft, counterfeiting and even trafficking. Second, the benefits were no longer restricted to vouchers redeemable only for food, but were provided in cash. The beneficiary could then elect to purchase a product or select services other than food. Third, the overall assistance provided to Puerto Rico was limited to an annual block appropriation, requiring the Puerto Rican government to adjust its program management to allocate the funds. Between 1982 and 1986, the U.S. Congress awarded $825 million annually in block grants for NAP program, and since then the appropriations have steadily increased by an estimated 3% to 4% to compensate for inflation. It has surpassed $1 billion annually since the early 1990s, and increased 30% from 1993 to 2002. Since fiscal year 2006, the appropriation has reached over $1.5 billion annually.|$|E
