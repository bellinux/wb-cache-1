5|$|From 1643 to 1659, {{he served}} as master mason for the {{construction}} of Heriot's Hospital (now a school), succeeding William Aytoun. The building had been started in 1628 by William Wallace, <b>and</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> finally completed until 1700; Mylne rebuilt {{one or two of the}} towers in 1648. Also in 1648, Mylne was engaged to repair the crown steeple of St. Giles'.|$|E
5|$|After {{his release}} from Bradford, Brandon spent {{a period of time}} {{training}} with Scottish-side Dundee United, although that was because he was visiting his friend and former teammate Danny Cadamarteri <b>and</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> offered a contract, before he was offered a trial with Port Vale in July 2010. It proved to be an unsuccessful trial, with Brandon spending time away from the game. He later held talks with Conference North side Guiseley, a non-league team from near Bradford. At the start of 2011, he signed for Thai Premier League side BEC Tero Sasana.|$|E
5|$|Backup guard Brandon Gore {{broke his}} ankle during the Hokies' loss to Florida State <b>and</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> able to participate. Senior Tech running back Mike Imoh, who shared time running the ball {{during the regular}} season with Ore and Humes, was also out after {{undergoing}} surgery to repair an injured ankle. Adding to the injury situation for Virginia Tech was offensive tackle Jimmy Martin, who suffered a sprained knee ligament in practice leading up to the game. Martin started 45consecutive games prior to the Gator Bowl, a streak that was broken when he was replaced by Brandon Frye {{on the day of the}} game.|$|E

5|$|During a {{televised}} address on 20 April, Nixon announced {{the withdrawal of}} 150,000 U.S. troops from South Vietnam during the year. This planned withdrawal implied restrictions on any offensive U.S. action in Cambodia. By the spring of 1970, MACV still maintained 330,648 U.S. Army and 55,039 Marine Corps troops in South Vietnam, {{most of whom were}} concentrated in 81 infantry and tank battalions. Many of them, however, were preparing to leave the country or expected to leave in the near future <b>and</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> available for immediate combat operations.|$|E
5|$|Even after Suys' {{proposal}} was officially adopted, Anspach faced strong {{opposition to the}} project. This opposition came first from engineers who felt that the covering was incompatible with Brussels’s geology, would accumulate potentially dangerous gases <b>and</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> able to handle enough water to prevent floods. Others opposed to the project complained about the high taxes resulting from its high cost, poor compensation for seized property {{and the lack of}} public input into the project. The press accused Anspach of being responsible for demolishing Brussels' old town, and published numerous caricatures mocking him.|$|E
5|$|Hamilton won the race, having {{overtaken}} Rosberg at the start, {{who fell}} back to fourth, but recovered to finish second. Rosberg's {{deficit in the}} Drivers' Championship therefore increased to 48 points. Sebastian Vettel finished third for Ferrari. This was the first race in which all cars were classified as finishers since the 2011 European Grand Prix, <b>and</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> replicated again until the 2016 Chinese Grand Prix.|$|E

5|$|On 3 May 2012, {{the club}} {{was taken over by}} DFC 1883 Ltd with the {{intention}} of moving into community ownership. Because it failed to agree a creditors voluntary agreement (CVA), and proposed to play at a ground without the required grading for the Northern Premier League, Darlington were relegated four divisions, to the Northern League Division One, on the recommendation of the Football Association. Martin Gray was appointed manager. An appeal was rejected, confirming that {{the club was}} to be treated as a new club <b>and</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> able to play under the name Darlington F.C. The new owners opted to rename the new club Darlington 1883.|$|E
5|$|Shortly thereafter, the Mallards molt, <b>and</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> {{able to fly}} {{until their}} new wings grew again, and Mrs. Mallard hatches eight ducklings named Jack, Kack, Lack, Mack, Nack, Ouack, Pack, and Quack. After the ducklings are born, Mr. Mallard decides to take a trip up the river {{to see what the}} rest of it is like. Mr. and Mrs. Mallard agree to meet at the Public Garden in one week. In the meantime, Mrs. Mallard teaches the eight ducklings all they need to know about being ducks, such as swimming, diving, marching along, and to avoid dangers such as {{bicycles}} and other wheeled objects.|$|E
5|$|The 8th Military Police Brigade (Provisional) was {{constituted}} in South Korea in September 1984 {{in response}} to the need for cohesive command and control element in the event of war, for the numerous non-divisional Military Police units on the peninsula. At the time it consisted of the 94th Military Police Battalion in Yongsan (Seoul) and the 728th Military Police Battalion in Taegu (Camp Walker). However, the brigade would remain provisional <b>and</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> officially activated for another ten years while it operated in this capacity.|$|E

5|$|The {{action was}} the first of two in this {{campaign}} in which lone British frigates were briefly overwhelmed by superior French forces as they sailed independently to join Rowley's squadron. On each occasion however, Rowley was able to recapture the lost frigate and drive off the French attackers. Corbet's action was particularly violent, British casualties totalling 49 killed and 114 wounded, including every single officer and all but three of the soldiers embarked. Africaine was seriously damaged <b>and</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> ready to return to active service for some months. French losses were less severe, Astrée suffering one killed and two wounded, Iphigénie nine killed and 33 wounded.|$|E
5|$|The {{subsequent}} Inchon landings were {{a crushing}} blow for the North Korean army, catching them completely unprepared and breaking the already-weak forces along the perimeter. With virtually no equipment, exhausted manpower and low morale, the North Koreans {{were at a}} severe disadvantage <b>and</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> able to continue pressure on the Pusan Perimeter while attempting to repel the landings at Inchon. By September 23, the North Koreans were in full retreat from Pusan Perimeter, with UN forces rapidly pursuing them north and recapturing lost ground along the way.|$|E
5|$|To {{add to the}} debate, it was {{becoming}} clear that the missile gap was fictional. The first Corona spy satellite mission in August 1960 put limits on their program {{that appeared to be}} well below the lower bound of any of the estimates, and a follow-up mission in late 1961 clearly demonstrated the US had a massive strategic lead. A new intelligence report published in 1961 reported that the Soviets had no more than 25 ICBMs <b>and</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> able to add more for some time.|$|E

5|$|After his arrest, Edwards {{was imprisoned}} in the Tombs, New York City's jail. When he was arrested, {{he had more}} than $44,000 in a trunk in his room. While in jail {{awaiting}} trial, Edwards forged a letter alleging he had funds in New Orleans, and then showed the letter {{to one of his}} lawyers in order to reassure the lawyer about Edwards' ability to pay for legal counsel. In an attempt to delay his trial, Edwards also forged a letter from a supposed witness, Charles Johnson, stating that he was in Cuba <b>and</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> able to come and testify for Edwards for a while; this gained Edwards a three-month delay.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{outbreak}} of the war, the government's immediate response was to announce on 5 September 1939 that it would begin calling up 10,000 militiamen at a time to provide sixteen days continuous service manning guard posts at selected points around the country. This was later expanded on 15 September to include all of the Militia, in two drafts of 40,000 men, for one month's continuous training, however, the suspension on compulsory training introduced in 1929 was not amended until January 1940. On 5 September 1939 it was also announced that a division would be raised for overseas service, but there was still large-scale opposition to the concept of conscription and the provisions of the Defence Act still precluded conscripts from serving outside of Australian territory, so it was announced that this force would be raised from volunteers only <b>and</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> raised directly from the Militia. Conscripts, however, were required to serve in the Militia, with the result being that the Militia's ranks were filled with both volunteers and conscripts during this time.|$|E
5|$|Having {{lost all}} of its Bristol Blenheim night fighters in the raid of 16 August, Tangmere {{dispatched}} two Hurricanes from the Fighter Interception Unit (FIU) fitted with FIU airborne radar to test the device in action. RAF Coastal Command also joined in, and committed No. 235 Squadron RAF and its Bristol Blenheims. The defence was reliant on the 68 Spitfires and Hurricanes. The numerical standing meant a ratio of one RAF fighter to every four German fighters and bombers, or in other words, one British aircraft to every two German fighters. Even had the fighter controllers realised {{the strength of the}} raid, there was little that could be done. Other fighters were refuelling and rearming after the attacks on Kenley and Biggin Hill <b>and</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> available.|$|E

5|$|Having {{received}} {{permission to}} conduct the raid, Mountbatten and his staff studied the Bruneval installation and its defences, rapidly coming {{to the conclusion that}} due to the extensive coastal defences in the area around the installation it was too well-guarded to permit a seaborne commando raid. They considered that such a raid would result in high casualties among the attacking troops <b>and</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> fast enough to capture the Würzburg radar before it was destroyed by the Germans. Believing that surprise and speed were to be the essential requirements of any raid against the installation to ensure the radar was captured, Mountbatten saw an airborne assault as the only viable method. On 8 January 1942, he therefore contacted the headquarters of 1st Airborne Division and 38 Wing RAF, asking if they were able {{to conduct the}} raid. The division's commander, Major-General Frederick Browning, was particularly enthusiastic, as a successful operation would be an excellent morale boost to the airborne troops under his command, as well as a good demonstration of their value.|$|E
5|$|Historian David Detzer {{has argued}} that the fame that {{surrounds}} the 11th New York is misplaced. During its time in service, the 11th New York Regiment saw little fighting compared to other well-known regiments such as the 69th New York, 20th Maine, and 28th Massachusetts. The 11th New York was often overshadowed by the 73rd New York, also known as the Second Fire Zouaves, which fought at Antietam, Gettysburg, and Appomattox. In addition, Ellsworth failed to consider that the New York City fire companies from which his troops were drawn often competed against each other at blazes. The cohesion he sought in firefighters did not exist <b>and</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> created when they joined the regiment. In that respect, 11th New York was no different than many regiments, North and South.|$|E
5|$|In 1956, {{the test}} program was {{transferred}} to Fort Eustis, Virginia, where Captain Selmer Sundby took over test-flying duties. The HZ-1 had been designed to be very easy to fly, and early testing indicated that untrained soldiers could learn to operate the craft in less than 20 minutes, and some claiming that only five minutes of instruction were required. In addition, the HZ-1 proved to be faster than other flying platform designs evaluated by the Army. Sundby, however, quickly determined that the craft was {{much more difficult to}} fly than had been expected, <b>and</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> safe {{in the hands of an}} inexperienced pilot. In addition, the low-mounted rotors proved to be prone to kicking up small rocks and other debris.|$|E
