In this paper, an initial registration algorithm of point clouds based on random sampling is proposed. In the proposed algorithm, the base points set is first extracted randomly in the target point cloud, next an optimal corresponding points set is got from the source point cloud, then a transform matrix is estimated based on the two sets with least square methods, finally the matrix is applied on the source point cloud. Experimental results show that this algorithm has ideal precision as well as good robustness...|$|R

CT scan comparisons of the skulls of Stegoceras validum, Prenocephale prenes, and several head-striking artiodactyls have also supported pachycephalosaurids as being well-equipped for head-butting.|$|E

The SUMO conjugation pathway is biochemically similar to ubiquitin conjugation, although the enzymes within the pathway act exclusively on SUMO proteins. This post-translational modification controls many processes. Here, I will focus on evidence that SUMOylation plays <b>a</b> <b>critical</b> <b>role(s)</b> <b>in</b> mitosis: Early studies showed a genetic requirement for SUMO pathway components {{in the process of}} cell division, while later findings implicated SUMOylation in the control of mitotic chromosome structure, cell cycle progression, kinetochore function and cytokinesis. Recent insights into the targets of SUMOylation are likely to be extremely helpful in understanding each of these aspects.

5|$|Some psychologists {{believe that}} 'while object {{permanence}} alone may not predict communicative achievement, object permanence {{along with several}} other sensorimotor milestones, plays <b>a</b> <b>critical</b> <b>role</b> <b>in,</b> and interacts with, the communicative development of children with severe disabilities'. This was observed in 2006, in a study recognizing where the full mastery of object permanence {{is one of the}} milestones that ties into a child's ability to engage in mental representation. Along with the relationship with language acquisition, object permanence is also related to the achievement of self-recognition. This same study also focused specifically on the effects that Down syndrome has on object permanence. They found that the reason why the children that participated were so successful in acquiring object permanence, was due to their social strength in imitation. Along with imitation being a potential factor in the success, another factor that could impact children with Down syndrome could also be the willingness of the child to cooperate.|$|E
