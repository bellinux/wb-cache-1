25|$|An {{example of}} the {{difficulties}} inherent in the enlarged war was the siting of Lima Site 85 on a mountaintop at Phou Pha Thi, Laos. This clandestine guidance radar facility was proposed at a mid-1967 meeting chaired by General Hunter Harris. Its purpose was radar directed air raids into Hanoi. Lair's opinion of the installation was <b>asked,</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> was the local expert, and he was being charged with its defense. He predicted that the Vietnamese would build a road toward the radar site until they could attack it. When asked if LS 85 could be defended, Lair pointed out that guerrilla forces were not equipped or trained for fixed defensive battles. He recommended the use of special forces or other trained infantry for defense, but his request was rejected. In January 1968, North Vietnamese forces bypassed the site temporarily to attack royalist positions at the Battle of Nam Bac. Despite the PAVN's delay of the battle, Lair's prediction of Lima Site 85's fall was prophetic. The radar site was captured by Vietnamese sappers on 11 March 1968 even though Hmong guerrillas and Thai mercenaries remained on the mountain. Shackley had predicted in a cable to headquarters that the site could not hold out beyond 10 March. The accuracy of his estimate burnished his reputation in the agency.|$|E

6000|$|... 'Are you ill?' Midmore <b>asked</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> {{entered the}} room. The red eyelids blinked cheerfully. Mr. Sidney, beneath a sumptuous patch-work quilt, was smoking.|$|E

'At {{least you}} will vouchsafe to trust {{yourself}} {{with me for}} the Lancers,' said Owen, as Cilla's partner came to claim her, and Phoebe rejoiced in anything to change the tone of the conversation; still, however, <b>asking,</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> led her off, what had become of the poor schoolmistress.|$|R
6000|$|By such methods as these, {{the teacher}} will {{certainly}} secure {{a majority in}} favor of all his plans.
