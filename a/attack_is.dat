5|$|A common example {{might be}} {{following}} unauthorized network intrusion. A specialist forensic examination {{into the nature}} and extent of the <b>attack</b> <b>is</b> performed as a damage limitation exercise. Both to establish the extent of any intrusion and in an attempt to identify the attacker. Such attacks were commonly conducted over phone lines during the 1980s, but in the modern era are usually propagated over the Internet.|$|E
5|$|In {{the video}} game , this <b>attack</b> <b>is</b> showcased {{in one of the}} final Dracula campaigns. After killing several Ottoman troops and {{suffering}} losses of his own, Dracula calls off the attack because he realizes Mehmed II fled the camp before the attack began.|$|E
5|$|Kirby's Dream Land is an action-platformer. Like {{many other}} platformers of the 8-bit and 16-bit era of video games, levels are side-scrolling, {{played on a}} {{two-dimensional}} plane in which Kirby can move left or right as well as jump. Kirby's main method of <b>attack</b> <b>is</b> to inhale enemies and objects into his mouth, after which the player can either swallow them or spit them out as a projectile attack. In addition to running and jumping, Kirby can also fly by inflating himself with a mouthful of air and flapping his arms. Flying can be done indefinitely; however, while flying, Kirby's only method of <b>attack</b> <b>is</b> to release the air puff held in his mouth which cancels his flight.|$|E
50|$|Mark Blunden and Adrian Escott {{described}} differential related key {{attacks on}} {{five and six}} rounds of KASUMI. Differential <b>attacks</b> <b>were</b> introduced by Biham and Shamir. Related key <b>attacks</b> <b>were</b> first introduced by Biham. Differential related key <b>attacks</b> <b>are</b> discussed in Kelsey et al.|$|R
50|$|The Beckton <b>attack</b> <b>was</b> part of {{a series}} of acid attacks {{targeting}} British Asians in London. However, not all acid <b>attacks</b> <b>were</b> similarly classified as hate crimes. The London boroughs of Newham and Tower Hamlets are among the areas of London where acid <b>attacks</b> <b>are</b> most common.|$|R
50|$|The Dinosaurs <b>Attack!</b> trading cards <b>were</b> {{created as}} a {{follow-up}} to the successful trading card series, Mars Attacks. Like Mars <b>Attacks,</b> Dinosaurs <b>Attack!</b> <b>was</b> intended as an homage and a parody of 1950s B-movies. While Mars <b>Attacks</b> <b>was</b> a parody of alien invasion movies, Dinosaurs <b>Attack!</b> <b>was</b> inspired by monster movies such as The Beast from 20,000 Fathoms and Godzilla.|$|R
5|$|Men in Black: Alien <b>Attack</b> <b>is</b> an {{interactive}} dark ride located at Universal Studios Florida in Orlando, Florida. As the name suggests, {{the ride is}} based on the 1997 film, Men in Black (MIB). The ride opened in 2000 after a three-year development process. The ride has generally been well received, winning an Outstanding Achievement award from the Themed Entertainment Association.|$|E
5|$|Ned Flanders - (Unlockable) Ned Flanders is a weak {{character}} with very strong special attacks. His prayer <b>attack</b> <b>is</b> {{the most damaging}} in the game as it causes high damage, stuns instantly and hits repeatedly anywhere in the ring. He also fully recovers when pinned, so opponents must beat him twice just to win one singular round.|$|E
5|$|Olaf Tryggvason's ships {{pass the}} {{anchorage}} of his allied enemies {{in a long}} column without order, as no <b>attack</b> <b>is</b> expected. Conveniently placed to observe the fleet, Jarl Eirik and the two kings remark upon the passing vessels. Svein and Olaf are eager to join battle, but Eirik is portrayed as more cautious and familiar with the Norwegian forces.|$|E
30|$|Detecting {{multistage}} <b>attacks</b> <b>is</b> also {{handled by}} Ning et al, where prerequisites {{and consequences of}} <b>attacks</b> <b>are</b> represented as predicates of first order logic [5]. Alerts that represent different stages of a single <b>attack</b> <b>are</b> fused together into hyperalerts. This concept diminishes the number of alerts to be analysed by the security team.|$|R
5000|$|It is not {{uncommon}} for the number of real <b>attacks</b> to <b>be</b> far below the number of false-alarms. Number of real <b>attacks</b> <b>is</b> often so far below the number of false-alarms that the real <b>attacks</b> <b>are</b> often missed and ignored.|$|R
30|$|Attacks on hosted applications. These <b>attacks</b> <b>are</b> {{considered}} in our classification because VMs might also host {{services that are}} publicly accessible. However, such <b>attacks</b> <b>are</b> not exclusive to cloud. Known <b>attacks</b> <b>are</b> for instance: SQL injection, buffer overflow, flooding and browser attacks. An attacker’s goal is to tamper with the application hinder the VM to properly deliver its services.|$|R
5|$|The {{reason for}} the <b>attack</b> <b>is</b> unknown, with {{theories}} that Centaur was in breach of the international conventions that should have protected her, that I-177s commander was unaware that Centaur was a hospital ship, or that the submarine commander knowingly attacked a protected vessel. The wreck of Centaur was found on 20 December 2009; a claimed discovery in 1995 had been {{proven to be a}} different shipwreck.|$|E
5|$|Al-Qaeda under Abu Musab al-Zarqawi's {{leadership}} launched coordinated {{explosions in}} three hotel lobbies in Amman on 9 November 2005, resulting in 60 deaths and 115 injured. The bombings, which targeted civilians, caused widespread outrage among Jordanians. The <b>attack</b> <b>is</b> {{considered to be}} a rare event in the country, and Jordan's internal security was dramatically improved afterwards. No major terrorist attacks have occurred since then. Abdullah and Jordan are viewed with contempt by Islamic extremists for the country's peace treaty with Israel and its relationship with the West.|$|E
5|$|American {{alligators}} {{are capable}} of killing humans. Mistaken identity leading to an <b>attack</b> <b>is</b> always possible, especially in or near cloudy waters. American alligators are often less aggressive towards humans than larger crocodile species, a few of which (mainly the Nile and Saltwater crocodiles) may prey on humans with some regularity. American alligator bites are serious injuries due to the reptile's sheer bite force and risk of infection. Even with medical treatment, an American alligator bite may still result in a fatal infection.|$|E
30|$|DDoS {{flooding}} <b>attacks</b> <b>are</b> one of {{the biggest}} threats faced by the critical IT infrastructure, from the simplest enterprise network to complex corporate networks. DDoS <b>attacks</b> <b>are</b> here since the very advent of computer networks, and they are not going anywhere anytime soon. The first DDoS <b>attack</b> incident [17] <b>was</b> reported in 1999 by the Computer Incident Advisory Capability (CIAC). Since then, most of the DoS <b>attacks</b> <b>are</b> distributed in nature and they continue to grow in frequency, sophistication, and bandwidth. The main aim of these <b>attacks</b> <b>is</b> to overload the victim’s machine and make his services unavailable, leading to revenue losses.|$|R
25|$|The <b>attack</b> <b>was</b> planned at Tauheed Hotel, {{and a house}} rented {{for this}} purpose in Madina Colony, Walton Road. The auto rickshaws used in the <b>attack</b> <b>were</b> {{purchased}} by Samiullah.|$|R
25|$|The <b>attack</b> <b>was</b> {{believed}} to have been carried out by Lashkar-e-Jhangvi. In August 2016, three of the terrorists involved in the <b>attack</b> <b>were</b> killed during a police raid in Lahore. In October, the <b>attack's</b> mastermind <b>was</b> killed in eastern Afghanistan during a military operation, while hiding there.|$|R
5|$|As {{with other}} forms of malware, {{security}} software (antivirus software) might not detect a ransomware payload, or, {{especially in the case}} of encrypting payloads, only after encryption is under way or complete, particularly if a new version unknown to the protective software is distributed. If an <b>attack</b> <b>is</b> suspected or detected in its early stages, it takes some time for encryption to take place; immediate removal of the malware (a relatively simple process) before it has completed would stop further damage to data, without salvaging any already lost.|$|E
5|$|Bond {{flies to}} Imperial Iran (Persia) to investigate. Gorner owns {{factories}} and produces legitimate pharmaceuticals, however MI6 suspects he has other motives. During Bond's investigation he identifies Gorner {{due to a}} deformity of his hand, and establishes Gorner's complicity in a scheme to not only flood Europe with cheap drugs but also to launch a two-pronged terrorist attack on the Soviet Union, whose retaliation will subsequently devastate the UK. The <b>attack</b> <b>is</b> to be made using a stolen British airliner, earlier hijacked over Iraqi airspace, and an ekranoplan. Bond is assisted in his investigation by Scarlett Papava (whose twin sister Poppy is under Gorner's emotional spell), Darius Alizadeh (the local head of station), JD Silver (an in-situ agent), and Felix Leiter.|$|E
5|$|During {{the threat}} display, any sudden {{movement}} by the intruder may provoke the mamba {{into a series}} of rapid strikes leading to severe envenomation. Also, the size of the black mamba, plus its ability to raise its head well off the ground, enable it to launch as much as 40% of its body length upwards, so mamba bites in humans quite often are on the upper body. This behaviour also permits the snake to land a strike at unexpectedly long range. The black mamba's reputed readiness to <b>attack</b> <b>is</b> often much exaggerated and usually is provoked by perceived threats, such as blocking its intended retreat, accidentally or otherwise.|$|E
50|$|The Shindo Renmei were a Japanese-Brazilian terror {{organization}} whose <b>attacks</b> <b>were</b> {{focused on}} {{resistance to the}} Japanese surrender {{at the end of}} World War Two; <b>attacks</b> <b>were</b> perpetrated against other Japanese-Brazilians.|$|R
50|$|Responsibility for the Quetta <b>attack</b> <b>was</b> {{claimed by}} Jamaat-ul-Ahrar and ISIL, while no group {{accepted}} {{responsibility for the}} Parachinar attack. According to the Pakistani military, both <b>attacks</b> <b>were</b> coordinated from terrorist sanctuaries in Afghanistan.|$|R
50|$|The 13 June 2012 Iraq <b>attacks</b> <b>were</b> {{a series}} of {{simultaneous}} bombings and shootings that killed 93 people and wounded over 300 others. The <b>attacks</b> <b>were</b> carried out in seven different locations throughout Iraq.|$|R
5|$|Each enemy has a meter, {{called a}} Chain Gauge, {{consisting}} of a percentage that increases from a base level of 100 when the enemy is struck by attacks or spells. Different attacks have different effects; some raise the chain by a larger amount while others give the player longer before the Chain Gauge resets to 100 percent. The amount of damage performed by an <b>attack</b> <b>is</b> multiplied by the chain percentage before it {{is applied to the}} enemy. When the chain counter reaches a preset amount, different for each enemy, the enemy becomes Staggered. In this mode, the enemy has lowered defense and is easily interrupted, and some may even be launched into the air, preventing them from attacking and stopping their ATB gauges from replenishing.|$|E
5|$|Egwene {{begins to}} expose the Black Ajah among the rebels, {{requiring}} every sister to re-swear her allegiances. Fifty sisters are exposed and executed, while twenty are able to escape. Taking advantage of the weakened White Tower defenses following the Seanchan raid, the rebels prepare an immediate attack. Just before the <b>attack</b> <b>is</b> mounted, the Tower Aes Sedai announce that Elaida was captured in the Seanchan raid, {{and that they would}} have Egwene as their leader, the Amyrlin Seat. The rebels return and they begin rebuilding the Tower.|$|E
5|$|Greene's <b>attack</b> <b>is</b> the {{earliest}} surviving mention of Shakespeare's {{work in the}} theatre. Biographers suggest that his career may have begun any time from the mid-1580s to just before Greene's remarks. After 1594, Shakespeare's plays were performed only by the Lord Chamberlain's Men, a company owned {{by a group of}} players, including Shakespeare, that soon became the leading playing company in London. After the death of Queen Elizabeth in 1603, the company was awarded a royal patent by the new King James I, and changed its name to the King's Men.|$|E
5000|$|He {{wrote that}} the <b>attacks</b> <b>were</b> {{the result of a}} CIA/Saudi Arabian/Mossad conspiracy, saying [...] "The {{strategic}} period & the timing of the terror <b>attacks</b> <b>are</b> a pointer to the powers behind the perpetrators." ...|$|R
50|$|The 1 April <b>Attacks</b> <b>were</b> {{a series}} of attacks across Cyprus in 1955 by the EOKA {{which led to the}} start of the Cyprus Emergency. Multiple British {{locations}} <b>were</b> <b>attacked</b> after midnight by EOKA members. This <b>attack</b> <b>was</b> accompanied by the distribution of leaflets across Cyprus.|$|R
50|$|The <b>attacks</b> <b>were</b> later {{condemned}} by Supreme Leader of Iran Ali Khamenei, and Iranian president Hassan Rouhani. On 24 January, Gholam-Hossein Mohseni-Eje'i announced that around 100 {{people involved in}} the <b>attack</b> <b>are</b> in custody by the authorities.|$|R
5|$|In October 1242, Nablus was raided by the Knights Templar. This was the {{conclusion}} of the 1242 campaign season in which the Templars had joined forces with the Ayyubid emir of Kerak, An-Nasir Dawud, against the Mamluks. The Templars raided Nablus in revenge for a preceding massacre of Christians by their erstwhile ally An-Nasir Dawud. The <b>attack</b> <b>is</b> reported as a particularly bloody affair lasting for three days, during which the Mosque was burned and many residents of the city, Christians alongside Muslims, were killed or sold in the slave markets of Acre.|$|E
5|$|In addition, Kerrigan briefly {{appears in}} Gabriel Mesta's Shadow of the Xel'naga, set between StarCraft and Brood War, {{in which she}} {{attempts}} to secure a Xel'naga artifact on the independent colony world Bhekar Ro, but fails when it eradicates her forces. Kerrigan is also observed in Shadow Hunters, the second novel in The Dark Templar Saga, a trilogy {{that acts as a}} precursor to StarCraft II. After sensing a nexus of joined human minds caused by protagonist Jake Ramsey {{at the end of the}} first novel, Kerrigan sends Zerg forces to its location, infesting the half-dead body of a Dominion-funded black marketeer, Ethan Stewart. As the <b>attack</b> <b>is</b> the first Zerg activity for years, it inadvertently raises the suspicions of Arcturus Mengsk, who wonders what could have motivated it.|$|E
5|$|In {{relation}} {{to this group}} of works, the Commission express the opinion that an enemy {{will not attempt to}} enter Washington from this direction, and that we cannot (as a general rule) expect to be able to meet him with a line of troops. What is to be prevented is the seizure of these heights for the purpose of establishing batteries to destroy the navy-yard and arsenal. For this purpose the works should be self-sustaining, or relying only upon such aid as a small movable body of troops can furnish, and upon succor, which may be thrown over the Branch after an <b>attack</b> <b>is</b> developed.|$|E
25|$|Like {{many other}} side-channel <b>attacks,</b> {{electromagnetic}} <b>attacks</b> <b>are</b> {{dependent on the}} specific implementation of the cryptographic protocol {{and not on the}} algorithm itself. Electromagnetic <b>attacks</b> <b>are</b> often done in conjunction with other side-channel attacks, like power analysis attacks.|$|R
50|$|According to prosecutors, an <b>attack</b> <b>was</b> staged on Ankvab in November 2011, in the Gudauta District {{village of}} Primorskoe, {{on the road}} to Aatse. The <b>attack</b> <b>was</b> aborted because the {{perpetrators}} had insufficient confidence in their escape routes.|$|R
