5|$|Moore {{returned}} to London in 1911, where, {{with the exception}} of frequent trips to France, he was to spend {{much of the rest of}} his life. In 1913, he travelled to Jerusalem to research for his next novel, The Brook Kerith (1916).

Other books from this period include a further collection of short-stories called A Storyteller's Holiday (1918), <b>a</b> <b>collection</b> <b>of</b> <b>essays</b> called Conversations in Ebury Street (1924) and a play, The Making of an Immortal (1927).
