40|$|The {{injection}} {{water for}} the Nelson Project {{is a combination of}} produced and make-up water, typical of many Eastern Kansas operations. The make-up water is a low-salinity salt water from the Arbuckle Formation and contains dissolved minerals and sulfides. The produced water contains suspended oil, suspended clay and silt particles, along with a combination of other dissolved minerals. The combination of the two waters causes several undesirable reactions. The suspended solids load contained in the combined waters would plug a 75 -micron plant bag filter within one day. Wellhead filters of 75 -micron size were also being used on the injection wells. The poor water quality resulted in severe loss of injectivity and frequent wellbore cleaning of the injection wells. Various mechanical and graded-bed filtration methods were considered for cleaning the water. These methods were rejected {{due to the lack of}} field equipment and service availability. A number of vendors did not even respond to the author`s request. The air flotation process was selected as offering the best hope for a long-term solution. The objective of this work is to: increase the cost effectiveness of the process through optimizing process design factors and operational parameters. A vastly modified air flotation system is the principal tool for accomplishing the project objective. The <b>air</b> <b>flotation</b> <b>unit,</b> as received from manufacturer Separation Specialist, was primarily designed to remove oil from produced water.

40|$|Thesis (M. S.) [...] Humboldt State University, Natural Resources: Wildland Soil Science, 2009 Wastewater algae were {{harvested}} from the dissolved <b>air</b> <b>flotation</b> <b>unit</b> at the Sunnyvale Water Pollution Control Plant in Sunnyvale, CA, to determine algal biomass suitability {{as a source}} of plant nutrition, specifically nitrogen. AlgaRhythms, Inc., an Arcata-based company, is interested in utilizing algae from treatment plants to further the development of wastewater algae as a fertilizer for use in retail markets. The experiment compared the suitability of wastewater algae as a fertilizer by comparing dry shoot biomass production, total Kjeldahl nitrogen content of leaf tissue, and mineralizable nitrogen content of growth medium to inorganic, organic, and commercial fertilizers. Annual ryegrass, Lolium multiflorum, and Wisconsin Fast Plants, Brassica rapa, were used as indicator organisms in a greenhouse potted plant study. Application rates of algae and other nitrogen sources were 111, 222, and 445 kg N ha- 1, along with four control groups that tested interactions with phosphorus, potassium, and micronutrients. After 28 days of growth, Lolium multiflorum showed significant differences between fertilizers and application rates, with regard to dry biomass yield, but very little difference was shown in the mineralizable nitrogen in the potting medium or in the total Kjeldahl nitrogen content of the leaves. Scanning and transmission electron microscopy images of algal biomass were obtained to visually characterize isolated algae. While lower application rates of algal biomass were not competitive with other fertilizers when considering yield, the highest application rate was similar to the 444 kg N ha- 1 inorganic and commercial treatments, and the lowest application rate of organic fertilizer. With its slower mineralization rate, wastewater algae have {{the potential to be a}} useful fertilizer especially where nitrate leaching is common. The algal fertilizer also contains high levels of carbon, which could help depleted soils improve organic matter levels while providing a source of fertility...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} was to study {{the effect of the}} treated oil {{refinery}} effluents of Bahrain Petroleum Company (BAPCO) on the marine environment. The study has been carried out in seven chapters, the first de ling with general introduction about the physical environment of the Arabian Gulf and its oil industry in addition to marine pollution and fishery in Bahrain. The second chapter was aimed at studying the quality of water at different areas in Bahrain to compare it with the quality of water at an area adjacent to the refinery outfalls. The third chapter deals with the impact of the refinery on the marine environment. The research approach adopted was ecological and observational I involving water and sediment analysis. The fourth chapter was aimed at studying the effects of the refinery effluents on the fish through toxicity tests and estimation of trace metals and hydrocarbons in the fish tissues. The studies were conducted with several effluents from the main and side streams of the refinery, outlets of the induced <b>air</b> <b>flotation</b> <b>unit</b> and Sitra separator. The fifth chapter was aimed at studying the effect of Sitra oil storage tanks treated effluent on the intertidal fauna of the adjacent area. The sixth chapter deals with a general discussion on the whole studies. While the seventh chapter deals with sions and recommendations. From the study conducted, it could be said that in general the water quality of the western and northern regions of Bahrain is better than the water quality of the eastern region. The east has in general higher pH, higher ammonia, higher nitrite, lower nitrate, and higher phosphate levels than the other regions. The higher concentrations of all these substances reflects the urbanisation and industrialisation of this part of Bahrain and the consequent discharges of waste material. The fish, safee, were tested with different concentrations of the refinery main stream effluent using both short and long term exposures. The same experiment was set up using effluents from the side stream, the I. A. F. discharge of the refinery and Sitra separator outlet. The results indicated a greater toxicity of pollutants in the I. A. F. and Sitar separator effluents than in the main and the side stream effluents. The lethal concentration of I. A. F. and Sitra separator effluents which brought death to fifty percent of the test population of fish (safee) within 96 hours was approximately twenty percent. Fish from the experimental media showed a higner concentration of heavy metals. The study of the effect of Sitra oil storage tanks treated effluent on the intertidal fauna of the adjacent area revealed that no fauna was found at stations located just outside the effluent outlet. The sediment of these stations was black, slimy, heavily oiled with a bad smell and contains dead shells and turrets. Away from the effluent, a diverse fauna was found. It is concluded that the BAPCO refinery has a measurable impact on the marine environment of the east coast of Bahrain, and recommenqations are made tor the development of future policies with regard to Bahraini coastal waters...|$|E

40|$|Contaminants {{present in}} paper {{recycling}} mills can degrade product properties {{and can also}} lead to substantial downtime. Of these, adhesive material such as hot melts and pressure sensitive adhesives are especially troublesome. These are known as ÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ stickies ÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ and their handling and re- moval requires process equipment such as screens and cleaners as well as chemical additives. In the preceding phase of the project we demonstrated that firing an underwater spark in a tank of stock reduces the tack of the stickies and reduces their impact. The present phase was to demon- strate the technology in full-scale trials, address any issues that might arise, and commercialize the process. Trials were run at the Appleton papers mill in West Carrollton, OH, the Graphics Packag- ing mill at Kalamazoo, MI, Stora Enso mills at Duluth, MN, and Wisconsin Rapids, WI, and the Jackson Paper mill at Sylva, NC.

The installation of screens and DAF units resulted in large quantities of screenings and sludge, which are then transported to a landfill for disposal. Hence, the aims of this Masters were to investigate the potential of different wastes for biogas production and to evaluate selected AD processes, as alternative technologies {{for the treatment of}} these wastes. The criteria for AD processes evaluation included, biogas quantity and quality, digestate and supernatant quality. Process configurations studied included batch, conventional (i. e. single stage, mesophilic), two-stage AD (TSAD) and two-phase AD (TPAD). The processes were monitored for the effect of operation factors such as organic loadings, temperature and hydraulic retention time (HRT). To conclude, AD of pre-DAF using TPAD showed biogas yield of 0. 54 m 3 biogas/kg VSadded, which are comparable to those obtained for degradable organic wastes. The AD of DAF-sludge using TPAD was more effective than using conventional AD. On the other hand CODt and TS removal both using TPAD and conventional AD were in the range of 19 - 31 % and 45 to 62 %, which is low. It is recommended that pre-treatment of DAF-sludge is investigated to enhance its degradability to the recommended removal rate...|$|R

The raw sewage coming from the Sharjah Municipality Drainage Department (SMDD) flow divider is first screened through a 3 Â mm screen to reduce solids loading, and stabilize and optimize the DAF unit performance. The screened wastewater is pumped into the flocculation pipes that have several fissures for coagulants and/or flocculent additions. However, no flocculent or any other chemicals are added during the runs. The flow passes through the sedimentation tank, then to the inflow tank. A portion of the effluent is combined with compressed air {{and returned to the}} sedimentation tank in the DAF unit. DAF unit is employed to perform sedimentation, aeration and for the removal the oils and greases. The accumulated sludge (including scum cleaned out by scraper, and the sediment sludge) is pumped into a manhole, which join the SMDD sludge treating line. The pretreated influent of the raw wastewater is screened up to 3 Â mm size and it is free of grit, oil, and grease. It is supplied at constant flow during experimentation but the wastewater flowrate to the bioreactor may vary between one and 3.5 Â m 3 /h. The screened, raw influent is pumped from the inflow tank via a submersible pump into the aeration chamber. The mixture of activated sludge and inflow is transferred by the recirculation pump, into the VRM chamber, and the mixture will return to the aeration chamber by over flow. The permeate pump draws permeate through the ultrafiltration membranes in the bioreactor at a vacuum (160 â 230 Â mbar). Permeate is then directed to the permeate tank. The permeate pump operates for a specified time interval; 8 Â min permeate with 2 Â min rest cycle.|$|R

Prior to coagulation, air flow rates of 3 and 5 l/min were the best for having FOG removal efficiencies of 60 % and 62 %, respectively. Significant improvements in these were measured (94. 5 % and 96. 2 % for the mentioned air flow rates respectively) after the addition of 0. 5 g/l Alum, while extra 0. 2 g/l bentonite clay as coagulation aid had achieved efficiencies of 96. 3 % and 99. 3 % for these air flow rates respectively. Also, the addition of 0. 5 g/l Alum had improved the BOD 5 reduction efficiency from 54 % to 65 % and from 63 % to 71 %, for air flow rates of 3 l/min and 5 l/min respectively, as compared with no Alum cases. Higher BOD 5 removal efficiencies of 73 % and 78 % were measured for the two air flow rates respectively, by aiding the coagulation with 0. 2 g/l bentonite clay. At least 25 % saving of flotation time was proved {{by the addition of}} bentonite clay to achieve final results, similar to these with Alum only for both FOG and BOD 5, which in turn may save part of the operational costs.

These five reactors were operated at two different temperatures (25 C and 45 C), to determine the temperature effects on digestion performance. COD removal efficiencies of 72. 6 %, 68. 6 %, 60. 1 %, 52. 1 %, and 43. 25 % were achieved for R 1 -R 5 respectively, at temperature of 25 C. These removal efficiencies were significantly improved when operating these reactors at temperature of 45 C, where efficiencies of 91. 2 %, 81. 5 %, 72. 1 %, 60. 7 % and about 50 % were achieved for these reactors. In addition to the achievement of good removal efficiencies regarding the COD and TSS, very promising biogas production rates were determined to have average values of 4. 5 - 5. 8 l/day at operation temperatures of 45 C (compared with 3 - 4 l/day at 25 C) for the majority reactor life times.

40|$|Dissolved <b>Air</b> <b>Flotation</b> (DAF) is a {{well-established}} treatment method for water containing low density particles. The density-driven process is {{operated by the}} injection of water saturated with air under high pressure. At the pressure reduction microscopic air bubbles are formed. The bubbles attach to the particles and the aggregates created rise {{to the surface of}} the unit where they are removed. Researchers working with DAF units struggle with disturbances in their measurements caused by air bubbles and the intrusion of the measuring equipment into the flow. In order to increase the knowledge and efficiency of the process researchers are now turning to Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD). The aim of this thesis is to investigate the applicability to use CFD for modelling DAF. The work is carried out by examining single and multiphase, steady-state numerical models of a pilot tank where the flow is simulated with ANSYS Fluent. The options of making a two- or a three-dimensional model and the choice of turbulence and multiphase models are examined. The simulations are compared to experimental measurements for validation. A model describing the formation of the aggregates in the <b>flotation</b> <b>unit</b> is derived and a field study on <b>flotation</b> <b>units</b> in operation in Finland and Sweden is carried out. The work demonstrates that a single-phase, two-dimensional model can capture the flow in the separation zone reasonably well, but that a three-dimensional model is required if the flow in the contact zone is to be studied. A two-phase flow can be captured in a two-dimensional geometry if it carries the characteristics of a stratified flow, suggesting that a two-dimensional model should be used with caution. A three-dimensional, two-phase model will reflect the flow in a DAF tank more truthfully, but requires more computer capacity and results indicate that a transient solver is required. The implementation of the aggregate model demonstrates the creation and motion of the aggregates within the contact zone of the DAF unit. The field study proves the acceptance of the DAF process and indicates that a numerical model would be valuable for investigating the performance of a <b>flotation</b> <b>unit</b> in operation...|$|R

Suspended solids and fat inhibit advanced treatment systems and cause lot of problems like clogging etc. Traditionally dairy industry uses sedimentation and fat traps to remove solids and fat. Dissolved <b>air</b> <b>flotation</b> is a novel treatment method to purify dairy wastewaters. A laboratory bench scale <b>flotation</b> <b>unit</b> was used {{to carry out the}} flotation experiments. The wastewater was collected from a dairy factory manufacturing milk powder and butter. Two types of wastewater was collected, one type (Type-I) of wastewater was used when the plant was manufacturing only milk powder. Type-II wastewater contained discharge from butter plant, thus exhibiting a overall characteristics of the discharges from the plant. The effects of change in pH, temperature and the usage of coagulant alum were examined to assess the process performance of flotation. Experiments with changing the pH showed that pH {{plays an important role in}} the treatment of dairy wastewaters. When the pH was lowered to 4 from original pH of wastewater of 11. 3, the solids and fat in the wastewater precipitated. High removal efficiencies were obtained at pH 4. Flotation tests were carried out at pH 4, 5, 7, 8 and original pH of wastewater. Considerable removal efficiencies were obtained at pH 7 and 8. This pH range is considered to be effective for further treatment like biological treatment. Temperature studies were carried out at pH 7 and 8. Removal efficiencies were average and were comparable to the removals with pH studies, at temperatures 25 Â° C and 34 Â° C. At a higher temperature of 48 Â° C removal efficiency decreased considerably. Maximum removal efficiencies were obtained for solids and fat at a temperature of 34 Â° C. Coagulant alum was used to increase the removal efficiency of solids and fat. Jar tests indicated that high dosage of alum was necessary to obtain optimum removal efficiencies. Alum was used in the concentrations of 150 mg/l to 400 mg/l. Removal efficiencies upto 92 % were obtained for fat and solids.

Dissolved <b>air</b> <b>flotation</b> <b>units</b> are generally designed {{on the basis}} of two parameters: the mA/mS ratio of the air mass to the solid mass in reaction, and the contact time between the gas phase and the solid phase. The insufficiency of this approach, which neglects energy dissipation, is demonstrated. Five units, the efficiencies of which were quantified by turbidimetry, were operated with a bentonite suspension previously flocculated with WAC or ferric chloride. Batch flotator 1 was a commercial unit designed to evaluate flotation feasibility (Fig. 1). Flotators 2 and 3 were used to establish flotation efficiency {{as a function of the}} mA/mS ratio in continuous operation (Figs. 2 and 3). The influence of contact time was determined with batch flotator 4 (Fig. 4). Continuous flotators 3 and 5 were identical rectangular reactors but the latter was designed to allow the injection of pressurized water through five different points (Fig. 3). Turbidity abatement increases as a function of mA/mS, reaching a plateau, the curve having a classical sigmoidal shape in batch or in continuous operation (Fig. 5). However the important air requirement (mA/mS= 1) to attain 70 % abatement would hamper industrial applications. The contact time is the residence time of the gas phase through a batch cell or the residence time of the solid phase through a continuous flotator. Its influence is displayed in Fig. 6 where a sigmoidal curve shows that a 100 second contact time is required to reach a significant abatement even with a low mA/mS of 0. 1. However, flotator 3 operated with a 108 second contact time and 0. 1 mA/mS ratio afforded only 40 % abatement (Fig. 7). Efficiency is not therefore determined by the two classical parameters only but also by energy dissipation. The energetic conditions can be quantified by velocity gradient measurements, of classical use in flocculation; this parameter is 3100 s-Â¹ in flotator 3 and between 590 and 1670 s-Â¹ in flotator 4. Flotation kinetics are classically considered first-order with respect to the particle concentration (Eqn. 3). In fact there is an analogy between flotation and flocculation which allows one to extend the well-known flocculation kinetics (Eqn. 4) to the flotation process (Eqn. 5). The steadiness of the bubble concentration permits the derivation of Eqn. 6, which enables one to calculate the efficiency of a batch or a plug-flow reactor as a function of the Camp number Gt (Eqn. 9). In fact there is an optimum range of velocity gradients between 3000 and 4000 s-Â¹ and an optimum range of Camp number between 105 and 106 (Fig. 9). The difference with the range currently observed in flocculation could be explained by the contact efficiencies in each process and by the probable existence of two ranges of optimal conditions. The model accuracy can be verified and the rate constant calculated (Figs. 8 and 10). This approach should be extended by testing particles exhibiting different degrees of hydrophobicity...|$|R

40|$|Dissolved <b>air</b> <b>flotation</b> (DAF) {{has been}} used for several decades in water {{treatment}} systems. It is a unit operation for the separation of solid and semisolid (floc) particles from a liquid phase that {{has been used}} for the clarification of potable water. The removal is achieved by dissolving air in the water or wastewater under pressure and then releasing the air at atmospheric pressure in a flotation tank or basin. The increased dissolved air concentration in water at elevated pressure is the fundamental principle that allows the formation of microbubbles. In this article a simple predictive tool is developed to estimate air saturated concentration in dissolved <b>air</b> <b>flotation</b> (DAF) systems. Estimations are found to be in excellent agreement with reported data in the literature with average absolute deviation being around 0. 5 %. The tool developed in this study can be of immense practical value for process engineers to have a quick check of air concentration in dissolved <b>air</b> <b>flotation</b> systems (DAF) at various conditions without opting for any experimental trials. In particular, water practitioners and process engineers would find the proposed approach to be user-friendly with transparent calculations involving no complex expressions...|$|R
