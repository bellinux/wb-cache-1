The plan would increase seating up to 69,050 as soon as the 2012 NFL season. Seating was added in that section for the 2011 NHL Winter Classic, which had an attendance of 68,111. The temporary seating was left in place for the 2010–11 NFL playoffs, with the AFC Championship game on January 23 having a record attendance of 66,662.|$|E

Sixty-ninepercent of the {{population was}} European American (of which 64.5percent was non-Hispanic white), 15.3percent was African American, and 0.3percent was American Indian or Alaska Native.

5|$|Mathematical {{notation}} was decimal, {{and based}} on hieroglyphic signs for each power of ten up to one million. Each of these could be written {{as many times as}} necessary to <b>add</b> <b>up</b> to the desired number; so to write the number eighty or eight hundred, the symbol for ten or one hundred was written eight times respectively. Because their methods of calculation could not handle most fractions with a numerator greater than one, they had to write fractions as the sum of several fractions. For example, they resolved the fraction two-fifths into the sum of one-third + one-fifteenth. Standard tables of values facilitated this. Some common fractions, however, were written with a special glyph—the equivalent of the modern two-thirds is shown on the right.|$|E

5|$|The Waterloo Wind Farm is a 111 MW {{wind farm}} which was {{completed}} in 2010 at an estimated cost of $300 million. Thirty-seven Vestas V90 3 MW turbines stretch over the 18km wind farm site and are connected through a 33 kilovolt (kV) internal reticulation network to the wind farm substation. The wind farm is approximately 30 kilometres south-east of the township of Clare and 100km north of Adelaide. A Stage 2 expansion was approved to <b>add</b> <b>up</b> to an additional 6 turbines to the existing farm and increase its total generating capacity to over 130 MW. Expansion is expected to commence in 2016.|$|E
5|$|A {{scoring system}} to {{evaluate}} material is to <b>add</b> <b>up</b> the piece {{values of the}} material on the board. In chess, when a pawn equals one unit, a bishop or knight is worth three, a rook five and a queen nine. These values are {{a consequence of the}} difference in mobility of the pieces. In bughouse, piece values differ because pieces in reserve essentially have the same mobility as they can be dropped on any vacant square. The pawn relatively gains importance in bughouse chess, as its very limited mobility does not handicap reserve pawns. They can for instance be dropped to block non-contact checks. Pawns can be dropped onto the seventh rank, one step away from promotion, which again adds to their importance. Long-range pieces like the queen or the rook lose relative value, due to the constantly changing pawn structure. They {{are also more likely to}} be hemmed in. A valuation system, first suggested by FICS-player Gnejs, often applied to bughouse is pawn=1, bishop=knight=rook=2 and queen=4.|$|E
5|$|The {{episode was}} {{originally}} broadcast on digital channel BBC Three from 10:30 pm on Monday, 27 October 2008, {{the same day}} as the BBC One viewing of the first episode. The episode would be repeated on the frontline BBC One a day later, during the 9 pm to 10 pm time slot. The BBC Three broadcast was viewed by 827,000 and a 7.3% audience share. It was the second most seen multichannel of the night, beaten by the first episode of Dead Set from E4. The BBC One repeat was seen by 5.06 million viewers with a 22.2 per cent; though it was down by 450,000 from the previous episode, it still won its time slot; and both broadcasts achieved a total reach of 5.89 million. According to the Broadcasters' Audience Research Board, the episode received final viewing figures of 0.93 million on BBC Three, and 5.63 million on BBC One; together they <b>add</b> <b>up</b> to 6.56 million.|$|E

5|$|Andre Norton Award nominees and {{winners are}} chosen {{by members of}} the SFWA, though the authors of the nominees {{do not need to be}} members. Works are {{nominated}} each year between November15 and February15 by published authors who are members of the organization, and the six works that receive the most nominations then form the final ballot, with additional nominees possible in the case of ties. A SFWA panel of jurors determines if the nominated works are written for young adults, and they may <b>add</b> <b>up</b> to three works to the ballot. Members may then vote on the ballot throughout March, and the final results are presented at the Nebula Awards ceremony in May. Authors are not permitted to nominate their own works, and ties in the final vote are broken, if possible, by the number of nominations the works received. Beginning with the 2009 awards, the rules were changed to the current format. Prior to then, the eligibility period for nominations was defined as one year after the publication date of the work, which allowed works to be nominated in the calendar year after their publication and then be awarded in the calendar year after that. Works were added to a preliminary list for the year if they had ten or more nominations, which were then voted on to create a final ballot, to which the SFWA organizing panel was also allowed to add an additional work.|$|E
5|$|The {{widespread}} use of conscription, the compulsory recruitment of soldiers' sons, the relaxation of age and height requirements and the branding of recruits all <b>add</b> <b>up</b> to {{a picture of an}} army that had severe difficulties in finding, and retaining, sufficient recruits. Recruitment difficulties are confirmed in the legal code evidence: there are measures to deal with cases of self-mutilation to avoid military service (such as cutting off a thumb), including an extreme decree of 386 requiring such persons to be burnt alive. Desertion was clearly a serious problem, and was probably much worse than in the army of the Principate, since the latter was mainly a volunteer army. This is supported {{by the fact that the}} granting of leave of absence (commeatus) was more strictly regulated. While in the 2nd century, a soldier's leave was granted at the discretion of his regimental commander, in the 4th century, leave could only be granted by a far senior officer (dux, comes or magister militum). In addition, it appears that comitatus units were typically one-third understrength. The massive disparity between official and actual strength is powerful evidence of recruitment problems. Against this, Elton argues that the late army did not have serious recruitment problems, on the basis of the large numbers of exemptions from conscription that were granted.|$|E
5|$|The inaugural champions were Shinjiro Otani and Tatsuhito Takaiwa, who {{defeated}} Dr. Wagner Jr. and Koji Kanemoto on August 8, 1998, in {{the finals}} of a tournament. Rocky Romero holds the record for most reigns by an individual wrestler, with eight. At six reigns, The Young Bucks (Matt Jackson and Nick Jackson) hold {{the record for the}} most by a team. Gedo and Jado's combined four reign lengths <b>add</b> <b>up</b> to 960 daysthe most of any team. Separately, Gedo and Jado are tied for most days as champion. NJPW keep track of all championship title defenses per reign, which is unlike most mainstream wrestling organizations. They also hold the most total defenses as champions, with 15. Gedo and Jado separately are tied for the record of total defenses by a single wrestler. Apollo 55 (Prince Devitt and Ryusuke Taguchi) hold the record for most defenses during a single reign, with 7. The Great Sasuke and Jushin Thunder Liger's only reign, Minoru and Prince Devitt's first reign, El Samurai and Koji Kanemoto's only reign, Apollo 55's fourth reign, Jushin Thunder Liger and Tiger Mask's only reign, The Young Bucks' second and fourth reigns, Roppongi Vice's (Beretta and Rocky Romero) first, second and fourth reigns and Matt Sydal and Ricochet's first and second reigns share the record for the fewest successful defenses, with zero. At 348 days, Otani and Takaiwa's second reign is the longest in the title's history. Minoru and Prince Devitt's first reign is the shortest, at 21 days. Overall, there have been 54 reigns shared among 43 wrestlers, who made up 33 different teams. The current champions are Roppongi 3K (Sho and Yoh), who are in their first reign both individually and as a team.|$|E
