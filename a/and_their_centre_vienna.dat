40|$|In {{this paper}} we propose a new cephalometric x-ray {{registration}} technique based on angular radial transform (ART). The registration is used as a first step in most hybrid cephalometric landmark detection algorithms to find the approximate landmark locations which are further used to find the exact landmark locations in the test x-ray image. All the existing cephalometric algorithms use features like distance between landmarks, distance between landmarks <b>and</b> <b>their</b> <b>centre</b> of gravity <b>and</b> <b>their</b> angular information for x-ray registration. The results achieved by the proposed technique are significantly better in terms of error and robustness...|$|R

40|$|A simple {{characterization}} method of the ordering of the nanopores is described for nanoporous anodized aluminium oxides. The method starts with image analysis on {{scanning electron microscopy}} representations for the purpose to find repetitive shapes <b>and</b> <b>their</b> <b>centres,</b> i. e. nanopores. Then triangles defined by coordinates of the centres are identified by Delaunay tessellation. Evaluation of the ordering degrees is then performed by a two-level analysis of the triangles. We define order parameters for triangular and hexagonal organization levels and show through typical examples that they are highly sensitive on ordering. (c) 2007 Elsevier B. V.

Hence the population of possible solutions of the system is at first determined with a quasi-deterministic approach, as intersecting loci, and then the optimal solution is determined using a simple and efficient stochastic approach.|$|R

The simulated in-cylinder velocities are compared to published laser Doppler anemometry (LDA) experimental data which is re-processed to illustrate the time history of mean velocities for all LDA measured points. Using the k-e RNG turbulence model, the numerical prediction seems in good agreement with the LDA measurements with an overall averaged correlation of 78. 3 % for the intake and compression stroke.

40|$|The {{emphasis}} on temporal and geographic {{scale of the}} French Annales school of history (cf. Braudel 1980; Baker 1984; Lewthwaite 1988) is the inspiration for this paper. Braudel (1980) divides time into three durations: short term events (days, weeks, months, a few years), medium length conjunctures (years, decades, even major portions of centuries), and long term structures (which may last centuries, even millennia). This last duration is the longue dur√©e. Basic to Annales 2 ÃÜ 7 thought - and the longue dur√©e - {{is the idea that}} to understand historical developments, to explain <b>their</b> causes <b>and</b> dynamics, one must know <b>their</b> temporal <b>and</b> <b>their</b> geographic scale; one must know what happened at <b>their</b> edges <b>and</b> <b>their</b> <b>centre,</b> why they developed and why they passed away; and how they changed during their span.
