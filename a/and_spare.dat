5|$|A {{total of}} 26 Lancasters were armed with Tallboys and the {{remainder}} with JW mines. The Film Unit Lancaster also flew out of Bardney carrying three RAF cameramen {{as well as an}} Associated Press journalist and a radio reporter from the BBC. The Liberators departed Bardney just before the bombers, carrying McMullen, maintenance personnel <b>and</b> <b>spare</b> parts. The No. 540 Squadron Mosquito left Bardney the next day. Despite not being notified of the new plan until after all of the Lancasters were airborne, the Soviet military quickly agreed to the changed arrangements.|$|E
5|$|Extravagant {{to a great}} degree, Ernest {{had many}} money {{troubles}} throughout his reign. In January 1848, Ernest visited his brother {{in the midst of}} political unrest in Germany. Upon his return, he also discovered unrest in Coburg. One of the many concerns related to finances. Although Ernest had a large inheritance, he also had frequent debts. There were increasing calls to nationalize most of his property. Indeed, Albert had to intervene at one point <b>and</b> <b>spare</b> his brother the embarrassment of losing one of his Coburg properties.|$|E
5|$|Hawkes & Son (later Rivière & Hawkes), a rival to Boosey & Company, {{was founded}} in 1865 by William Henry Hawkes selling orchestral sheet music. The company also made musical {{instruments}} <b>and</b> <b>spare</b> parts such as clarinet reeds, and by 1925 Hawkes had set up an instrument factory in Edgware, North London. The business, which was particularly known for brass and military band music, was eventually inherited by Ralph Hawkes (1898–1950).|$|E

5|$|The M19 was {{developed}} from the T65 {{which was based on}} the M5 light tank chassis. The original design was improved upon and designated the T65E1. It was accepted into service in May 1944 as the M19 MGMC, equipping several U.S. Army anti-aircraft units during World War II. The M19A1 was an improved variant with an auxiliary engine <b>and</b> <b>spare</b> barrels for the 40mm Bofors guns.|$|E
5|$|The Royal Yugoslav Navy {{operated}} {{a series of}} seaplane bases on the Dalmatian Coast before World War II and decided that it needed a ship to transport seaplanes between them and to rescue downed aircraft after operations as had been common during World War I. It decided on the smallest possible ship that could carry supplies <b>and</b> <b>spare</b> parts for ten seaplanes.|$|E
5|$|The {{service is}} {{typically}} used for valuable and somewhat time-sensitive cargo where the time advantage of rail over ship is essential, which, however, is heavy {{enough to make}} the cost saving vs. air transport noticeable. Typical cargoes include complex machinery <b>and</b> <b>spare</b> parts (in both directions), as well as high-end groceries and consumer goods (primarily toward China). While major customers ship their products by full container load, freight forwarders also make it possible to send less-than-container shipments.|$|E

5|$|Due to {{the rapid}} pace of operations, deployment, and redeployment, {{coordination}} of artillery units and their fires became a worrisome quandary during the operations. This was made even more problematic by the confusion generated {{by the lack of}} adequate communications systems between the rapidly advancing units. The joint nature of the operation added another level of complexity to the already overstretched communications network. Regardless, due to the ability of U.S. logisticians to innovate and improvise, supplies of food, water, ammunition, <b>and</b> <b>spare</b> parts arrived at their destinations without any shortages hampering combat operations and the communications system, although complicated, functioned well enough during the short duration of U.S. operations.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the brief}} April War, the Germans had {{captured}} over 300 ex-VVKJ aircraft. They considered {{them to be}} of little use for the Luftwaffe, so {{it was decided to}} equip the ZNDH with an appropriate number of these aircraft. These aircraft, scattered in every corner of Yugoslavia, were then collected, minor damage repaired and stocks of fuel <b>and</b> <b>spare</b> parts stored at airfield workshops. Naturally, the majority of the aircraft were more or less damaged and action was undertaken to repair as many of them as possible. Former VVKJ pilots of Croatian background and other personnel of aeronautical specialty were approached and offered instant rehabilitation (most of them were in German POW camps), jobs and safety for their families.|$|E
5|$|From a {{military}} point of view, the 10th Harel Brigade required reinforcements and Ben-Gurion dispatched {{a battalion of}} the 6th Etzioni Brigade. He considered it imperative that the 7th Brigade join the forces in Jerusalem {{as well as a}} contingent of 400 new recruits to reinforce the Harel Brigade. Weapons <b>and</b> <b>spare</b> parts that had arrived in Israel by air were also now ready for combat on the Jerusalem front. The commander of the 7th Brigade wished to neutralize the negative effects of the debacle on the morale of the troops and on his prestige. The central front was reorganized and its command given to an American volunteer fighting on the Israeli side, Colonel David Marcus, who was subsequently appointed Aluf (Major General). He took command of the Etzioni and 7th Brigades, and the 10th Palmach Harel Brigade.|$|E

5|$|In August 1941, McAloney {{was posted}} to the Directorate of Equipment at RAAF Headquarters, Melbourne. In this {{capacity}} he advised on the procurement of equipment <b>and</b> <b>spare</b> parts for RAAF aircraft. He was further tasked with compiling a register of aeroplane equipment at RAAF flight training units and operational bases throughout Australia. The latter entailed McAloney visiting several Air Force units in Victoria, New South Wales and Queensland to check equipment stores. On 1 March 1942, he was commissioned as a flying officer. Transferred to the Directorate of Equipment Administration in July, McAloney was made Officer Commanding Technical and Photographic Staffs {{and served as}} a liaison between his own directorate and that of Technical Services.|$|E
5|$|In {{the days}} prior to hitting Dominica, David was {{originally}} expected to hit Barbados <b>and</b> <b>spare</b> Dominica in the process. However, on August 29 a turn in the hours before moving through the area caused the 150 mph (240 km/h) hurricane to make a direct hit on {{the southern part of}} Dominica. Even as it became increasingly clear that David was headed for the island, residents did not appear to take the situation seriously. This can be partly attributed to the fact that local radio warnings were minimal and disaster preparedness schemes were essentially non-existent. Furthermore, Dominica had not experienced a major hurricane since 1930, thus leading to complacency amongst much of the population. This proved to have disastrous consequences for the island nation.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Gelimer {{remained}} blockaded by Pharas at {{the mountain}} stronghold of Medeus, {{but as the}} blockade dragged through the winter, Pharas grew impatient. He attacked the mountain stronghold, only to be beaten back {{with the loss of}} a quarter of his men. While a success for Gelimer, it did not alter his hopeless situation as he and his followers remained tightly blockaded and began to suffer from lack of food. Pharas sent him messages calling upon him to surrender <b>and</b> <b>spare</b> his followers the misery, {{but it was not until}} March that the Vandal king agreed to surrender after receiving guarantees for his safety. Gelimer was then escorted to Carthage.|$|E

5|$|Once interested, Soichiro Honda began {{developing}} the Super Cub {{on his return}} to Japan. The following year Honda displayed a mockup to Fujisawa that finally matched {{what he had in}} mind, Fujisawa declaring the annual sales would be 30,000 per month, half again as many as the entire monthly two-wheeler market in Japan. His goal was to export motorcycles on a scale yet unseen in the economic disorder of postwar Japan, when most companies' halting trade efforts were handled through foreign trading companies. Honda would have to establish its own overseas subsidiary to provide the necessary service <b>and</b> <b>spare</b> parts distribution in a large country like the United States. To this end American Honda Motor Company was founded in 1959. In 1961 a sales network was established in Germany, then in Belgium and the UK in 1962, and then France in 1964.|$|E
5|$|The 49th Pursuit Group {{was soon}} {{on its way}} to fight the Japanese in the South West Pacific. Arriving in Australia in February 1942, the 49th Pursuit Group moved to the Darwin area in March and April 1942. By this time, Darwin had been bombed a number of times. The 49th Pursuit Group became its {{principal}} defense. Conditions in the area were still primitive, <b>and</b> <b>spare</b> parts and equipment were scarce. Lacking adequate logistical support, the Americans were heavily dependent on their Australian allies. Morale was low, but the sight of Wurtsmith's aircraft patrolling the skies provided an important boost.|$|E
5|$|The five {{locomotives}} <b>and</b> <b>spare</b> parts {{acquired by}} Roger Broggie {{were sent to}} the Tampa Ship Repair & Dry Dock Company in Tampa, Florida, to receive the aesthetic and mechanical restorations necessary to run on the planned Walt Disney World Railroad (WDWRR). At the time, this was the closest facility to the Walt Disney World site in Bay Lake, Florida with the space and equipment needed to accommodate full-size railroad rolling stock. Here Transportation Superintendent Earl Vilmer, who had accompanied Broggie on his trip to Mexico, along with Project Engineer Bob Harpur and the facility's Machinist Supervisor George Britton were tasked with the project's completion.|$|E

5|$|After this, No. 6 Commando was {{put into}} the role of mobile reserve in an effort to {{maintain}} the unit's integrity <b>and</b> <b>spare</b> it from incurring further losses that might render it unable to remain in the line. Nevertheless, throughout March and into April they continued to carry out patrol operations around Goubellat and Ben Arada. Finally, in early April {{the decision was made to}} withdraw the commandos from the fighting in North Africa. Lacking the administrative support and reinforcements of regular infantry units, the unit's strength had fallen to just 150 men and as a result it was no longer considered effective. On 7 April, No. 6 Commando arrived in Algiers, where it remained for two weeks before embarking on HMT Staffordshire on 24 April. After a short voyage, it arrived back in the United Kingdom on 2 May 1943 to begin preparations for the invasion of German-occupied France.|$|E
5|$|During {{the early}} 1980s the RNZAF {{considered}} options to replace or upgrade its A-4Ks. A team of senior RNZAF personnel visited France, the United Kingdom and the United States to assess new aircraft, and the New Zealand Government released a tender in May 1982 seeking proposals {{to upgrade the}} Skyhawks. After {{the decision was made}} to disband the RAN's fighter force, the Australian Government offered the ten surviving A-4Gs <b>and</b> <b>spare</b> parts for these aircraft to New Zealand for $NZ40 million. The Cabinet of New Zealand gave the RNZAF authority to begin formal discussions of this deal on 5 September 1983. A team of Air Force personnel inspected the A-4Gs at Albatross in November that year and judged that they were in generally good condition. The commander of the RNZAF, Air Vice-Marshal David Crooks, favoured purchasing the A-4Gs and then upgrading the entire A-4 fleet over the alternative of buying new aircraft, as this option was the cheapest way to improve the Air Force's capabilities. He recommended to Prime Minister Rob Muldoon that the deal be taken up, and a decision to acquire the aircraft was made in May 1984. As part of the purchase agreement, the New Zealand Government committed to return one of the Skyhawks to Australia for display after the type was retired from service.|$|E
5|$|In 1949, Grant befriended {{the occult}} artist Austin Osman Spare, and in ensuing years helped to {{publicise}} Spare's artwork {{through a series}} of publications. During the 1950s he also came to be increasingly interested in Hinduism, exploring the teachings of the Hindu guru Ramana Maharshi and publishing a range of articles on the topic. He was particularly interested in the Hindu tantra, incorporating ideas from it into the Thelemic practices of sex magic. On Germer's death in 1969, Grant proclaimed himself Outer Head of the O.T.O.; this title was disputed by the American Grady McMurtry, who took control of the O.T.O. Grant's Order became known as the Typhonian Ordo Templi Orientis, operating from his Golders Green home. In 1959 he began publishing on the subject of occultism, and proceeded to author the Typhonian Trilogies, {{as well as a number}} of novels, books of poetry, and publications devoted to propagating the work of Crowley <b>and</b> <b>Spare.</b>|$|E
