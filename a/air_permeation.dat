40|$|Abstract. Tyre {{is one of}} {{the most}} crucial {{components}} in a vehicle structure not only to have the vehicle running smoothly on the road, but also to provide physical and acoustic comfort for the passengers. But, since the day the inflatable tyres were invented, sudden loss of air in a tyre acts as a major problem associated with tyres; and are still being treated to date by professional researchers and giant tyre manufacturers. The phenomena where tyre experiences natural pressure loss over the time is called <b>air</b> <b>permeation</b> which causes tyre to deflate on its own. Besides reviewing the primary theories and findings that contribute to natural <b>air</b> <b>permeation</b> that literally causes the pressure drop of an automotive tyre, this paper also reveals the experimentally validated results of the significant factor which contributes to <b>air</b> <b>permeation</b> of an automotive tyre. Additionally, a relevant nano-based solution to reduce the <b>air</b> <b>permeation</b> rate to stop the tyre deflation is also highlighted to establish the way forward total solution suiting wide range of tyres used on domestic cars...|$|E
40|$|The {{problems}} associated with grain elevation and conveying under forced flow in vertical pipes are discussed. Based on experimental results, a theory is presented to describe forced flow {{with varying degrees of}} <b>air</b> <b>permeation</b> up to and just beyond the fluidization point. The theory takes into account the boundary and internal frictional properties, the degree of consolidation of the bulk granular material, and the stress fields that occur during forced flow. The force to elevate grain in a vertical tube is shown to be composed of two components, one to overcome Coulomb friction and initiate motion, and the other a time-dependent component that depends on the stiffness and damping characteristics of the granular material. The Coulomb friction component increases approximately exponentially with column height due to the positive feedback effect of the shear stresses at the pipe wall opposing the motion. <b>Air</b> <b>permeation</b> is shown to significantly reduce this component of the conveying force by reducing both the internal friction and the apparent bulk specific weight, the latter being the actual bulk specific weight less the air pressure gradient. <b>Air</b> <b>permeation</b> has a very significant effect on reducing both the bulk stiffness and, particularly, the damping characteristics, thereby reducing the time-dependent component of the conveying force...|$|E

50|$|This plastic is {{also used}} to produce air {{separation}} membranes for generating nitrogen. The PPO is spun into a hollow fiber membrane with a porous support layer and a very thin outer skin. The permeation of oxygen occurs from inside to out across the thin outer skin with an extremely high flux. Due to the manufacturing process, the fiber has excellent dimensional stability and strength. Unlike hollow fiber membranes made from polysulfone, the aging process of the fiber is relatively quick so that air separation performance remains stable throughout the life of the membrane. PPO makes the air separation performance suitable for low temperature (35-70F)(2-21C) applications where polysulfone membranes require heated <b>air</b> to increase <b>permeation.</b>|$|R

Besides poor performance, a characteristic coloring also appeared {{on the surface of}} the membranes. In order to understand what was happening to the surface of the membranes, they were analysed with Low-Energy Ion Spectroscopy (LEIS) and X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS). The analyses showed that the surface of the LSCF membrane was covered with a SiO 2 layer, which obviously reduced the performance and caused the coloring. It was established that the source of the silicon was siloxane containing grease that was used in the manual valves of the setup. In a new improved permeation setup, where grease-free valves were used, the LSCF membranes showed remarkably better performance. The LEIS measurements showed also that the permeation experiment of 300 h did not affect the surface composition of the membranes. The contamination-free LSCF membranes only showed the presence of La, Sr and O in the outermost atomic layer. The observed absence of Co and Fe suggests that further improvement of the membrane performance is possible...|$|R

40|$|The {{production}} of O- 2 -enriched air and of high-purity oxygen was studied in a flow-through {{and in a}} dead-end permeator with BaCoxFeyZr 1 -x-yO 3 -delta (BCFZ) hollow fiber membranes at high temperatures using (i) pressurized air/O- 2 -enriched air as feed, (ii) reduced pressure on the permeate side, and (iii) a combination of both. For the effective {{production of}} oxygen with a high space-time yield, a two-step process is proposed. In a first step, O- 2 -enriched air with an oxygen concentration of 30 - 50 vol % is produced in a flow-through permeator from I bar of air as feed applying a vacuum pump to {{keep the pressure on}} the O- 2 -enriched air side at about 0. 12 bar. In a second step, pure oxygen is produced in a dead-end permeator using the O- 2 -enriched air from step 1 as pressurized feed and using again a vacuum pump to establish a reduced oxygen pressure of about 0. 05 bar on the permeate side. The oxygen permeation fluxes increase with increasing temperature, pressure on the feed side, and oxygen concentration in the fed O- 2 -enriched <b>air.</b> An oxygen <b>permeation</b> flux of 10. 2 cm(3) (STP) cm(- 2) min(- 1) was reached using O- 2 -enriched air with 50 vol % O- 2 at 5 bar as feed and reduced pressure of 0. 05 bar on the permeate side at 900 degrees C.

40|$|Current {{models for}} {{pressure}} drop prediction of slug flow pneumatic conveying in a horizontal pipeline system assume {{some type of}} steady state conditions for prediction, which limits their capability for increased predictive accuracy relative to experimental data. This is {{partly because of the}} nature of slug flow pneumatic conveying system, which, as a dynamic system, never becomes stable. By utilising conservation of mass (airflow), a dynamic pressure analysis model is proposed on the basis of the derivative of the upstream pressure behaviour. The rate of <b>air</b> <b>permeation</b> through slug, one of the important factors in the conservation model, is expressed as a function of a slug permeability factor. Other factors such as slug velocity, slug length and the fraction of stationary layer were also considered.

This study investigates the influence of an aerosol generation stop and go on the filter pressure drop and penetration. Experiments carried out using a HEPA glass fibre filter show that the pressure drop increases by up to 20 % after an aerosol generation interruption. The pressure drop increase could be countered by performing a clean <b>air</b> <b>permeation</b> during the break period. If a permeation velocity higher than the filtration velocity is used, the pressure drop of the filter is noticeably reduced compared to what it would have been without an interruption.

Analytical models are presented {{for each of the}} tests to relate the results to fundamental properties of the concrete. Experimental results are presented for the application of a vacuum technique for preconditioning concrete in situ prior to the Figg test and CAT. The application of vacuum using the initial surface absorption test cap did not lead to satisfactory results with these tests. However, direct application of vacuum to the Figg and CAT heads prior to testing resulted in improvement of the reproducibility of the permeation indices obtained from these tests. The analytical models were then used in combination with the experimental results to draw conclusions about the choice of test method for practical applications...|$|E

These highly active chemical attractants have been synthesized {{for some of}} the most important insect pests, including the boll weevil, gypsy moth, codling moth, tobacco budworm, European corn borer, and several bark beetles. While none of the synthetic sex attractants have yet been developed for use in insect control, they offer opportunities for the future both as control agents and to greatly improved insect detection. Investigations are underway on insect trapping systems employing the phermones and on <b>air</b> <b>permeation</b> techniques to disrupt insect reproduction. The pheromones are generally highly species-specific and are not likely to pose hazards to nontarget organisms in the environment.

Air permeability decreased and elastic modulus increased with increasing depth or density. Two distinct changes were found at densities of 550 and 730 kg・m^, i. e. at porosities of 0. 40 and 0. 20,in the plots of air permeability and elastic modulus against density or porosity. The former change is explained by the alteration of the densification mechanicism from mechanical packing to plastic deformation of ice particles, and the latter by the attainment of an optimum configuration of ice bonding for <b>air</b> <b>permeation</b> and mechanical strength. Observed results are compared with the theoretical air permeability of an ideal snow, to which all polar snows are considered to approach in a long ageing period under high hydrostatic pressure and high homologous temperature.

40|$|In {{its present}} form, polymer {{electrolyte}} membrane fuel cell (PEMFC) technology requires some method of humidification {{to ensure that}} high performance and long life of the fuel cell membrane is maintained. External humidification utilizing ‘gas to gas’ membrane based planar humidifiers is one method of humidifying fuel cell reactant gases. This type of humidification offers the benefit of recycling heat and moisture from the fuel cell exhaust, and returning it to the reactants entering the fuel cell. In designing a planar membrane based fuel cell humidifier the two important areas to be considered are: - humidifier channel and plate design; and - humidifier membrane selection. In this work a humidifier design procedure was developed based on prototype humidifier testing. This design procedure involves selection of design parameters based on a dimensionless parameter which describes the ratio of gas residence time, and water diffusion time from the membrane surface. Humidifiers of different flow channel geometries were created with a rapid prototyping technique. These humidifier units were tested at different operating conditions {{in an attempt to}} validate the design equations involving a design parameter which is the ratio between the residence times of gas in the humidifier over the diffusion time of water {{from the surface of the}} membrane into the channel. This parameter offers a good starting point for humidifier design, the target value of this parameter was found to be between 2. 0 and 4. 0, with a desired value of 3. 0. A fuel cell stack humidifier design procedure and suggestions are presented based this parameter. The design also considers designing a humidifier on limited volume constraints in which the humidifier would have to fit into the fuel cell system. A membrane selection procedure was developed based on design criteria requirements developed during this work for the fuel cell humidifier. This criterion includes high water permeation, low <b>air</b> <b>permeation,</b> good mechanical strength, robust handling, and long lifetime under various operating conditions.. Specific values for membrane selection included a water flux of greater than 14 kg m- 2 h- 1 in a water permeation test, less than 3 cm 3 min- 1 cm- 2 kPa- 1 <b>air</b> <b>permeation</b> when the membrane was dry, and a lifetime of at least 1500 hours of operation without performance degradation. Sixty membranes from various sources were screened for candidacy for use in the humidifier application. Membranes which passed the initial screenings were tested for durability at high and moderate temperature conditions. These membranes were operated until failure, at which time analysis was completed to determine the failure modes of the membrane. Mitigation strategies were proposed when applicable. Recommendations were made for membrane materials for the proposed operating requirements. Suggested membranes materials included those based on UHMWPE and inorganic additives, as well as homogenous membranes based on Nylon 6, 6, PEEK, and PFSA...|$|E

Exotic materials such as nanoparticles offer promising perspectives, and combining both their very high specific surface area and the possibility to incorporate them into macrostructures have already shown to substantially increase the membrane performance. In this paper {{we report on the}} fabrication and engineering of metal-reinforced carbon nanotube (CNT) Bucky-Paper (BP) composites with tuneable porosity and surface pore size. A BP is an entangled mesh non-woven like structure of nanotubes. Pure CNT BPs present both very high porosity (> 90 %) and specific surface area (> 400 m 2 /g). Furthermore, their pore size is generally between 20 – 50 nm making them promising candidates for various membrane and separation applications. Both electro-plating and electroless plating techniques were used to plate different series of BPs and offered various degrees of success. Here we will report mainly on electroless plated gold/CNT composites. The benefit of this method resides in the versatility of the plating and the opportunity to tune both average pore size and porosity of the structure {{with a high degree of}} reproducibility. The CNT BPs were first oxidized by short UV/O 3 treatment, followed by successive immersion in different plating solutions.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Current sheet molding {{compound}} (SMC) panels, when {{coated with}} powder primer, show primer popping in the bake oven due to the degassing of the substrate moisture. In the absence of moisture, however, {{it was found that}} some SMCs showed severe popping, while other SMC materials did not. These results suggested that, contrary to general opinion, the moisture content in SMC might not be the only cause for popping. This report covers the results of a systematic study that was carried out to identify the factors that contribute to powder primer popping. Several potential variables that could affect popping, such as volatiles in the substrate, thermal conductivity of the substrate, static charges, and powder bake profile were studied. The experiments showed that the poly(vinyl acetate) in the low profile additive (LPA) is the main cause. More specifically, the micro void formation of this low profile additive that eliminates SMC shrinkage, and enables a smooth surface finish, also causes primer popping. Based on the experimental results, it was concluded that the <b>air</b> <b>permeation</b> into these micro voids is the reason behind the popping of the moisture free SMC substrates. This understanding of the failure mechanism, paves the way for the development of low moisture absorbing SMC materials that can be powder primed in our assembly plants, and could remove the barriers for the usage of SMC on GM vehicles.

40|$|The idea {{of using}} species-specific {{behavior}} modifying chemicals {{for the management of}} noxious insects in agriculture, horticulture, forestry, stored products, and for insect vectors of diseases has been a driving ambition through five decades of pheromone research. Hundreds of pheromones and other semiochemicals have been discovered that are used to monitor the presence and abundance of insects and to protect plants and animals against insects. The estimated annual production of lures for monitoring and mass trapping is on the order of tens of millions, covering at least 10 million hectares. Insect populations are controlled by <b>air</b> <b>permeation</b> and attract-and-kill techniques on at least 1 million hectares. Here, we review the most important and widespread practical applications. Pheromones are increasingly efficient at low population densities, they do not adversely affect natural enemies, and they can, therefore, bring about a long-term reduction in insect populations that cannot be accomplished with conventional insecticides. A changing climate with higher growing season temperatures and altered rainfall patterns makes control of native and invasive insects an increasingly urgent challenge. Intensified insecticide use will not provide a solution, but pheromones and other semiochemicals instead can be implemented for sustainable area-wide management and will thus improve food security for a growing population. Given the scale of the challenges we face to mitigate the impacts of climate change, the time is right to intensify goal-oriented interdisciplinary research on semiochemicals, involving chemists, entomologists, and plant protection experts, in order to provide the urgently needed, and cost-effective technical solutions for sustainable insect management worldwide...|$|E
40|$|Flexible {{polyurethane}} (PU) foams {{are widely}} used in many industrial applications, such as upholstered furniture and mattresses, automotive applications, etc. The chemical nature of the PU, the high air permeability, and the high inner surface area of the foam structure cause this material to be highly flammable. Consequently, the application of flame retardants to flexible PU foams is an important issue. The use of halogenated flame retardants is not considered optimal, {{in part due to}} the high emission level and the possible phase-out by the European Risk Assessment Body. Consequently, melamine as a nonhalogenated flame retardant is applied more and more frequently. However, little data is available regarding the application of melamine as an additive in flexible PU. This paper is concerned with the influence of melamine on the synthesis of the PU foam and the resulting material-specific properties. Especially, the increase of viscosity and the high heat capacity of melamine lead to a decrease in foaming growth and rising height with increasing melamine content. This is caused by the reduced drainage rate between the struts and the plateau borders in the foam-forming process. Here, the increase in viscosity follows the Dougherty-Krieger equation with the intrinsic viscosity of k = 3. 3. The mechanical properties such as density and compression strength increase with increasing melamine content. Other properties like tensile strength and elongation decrease because of the embedding of the melamine in the PU matrix, which weakens the structure. The <b>air</b> <b>permeation</b> and number of cells also decreases because of the thickened struts caused by the reduced drainage rate in the foaming process. Furthermore, the reaction between the amino groups of melamine and the isocyanate of the PU formulation was investigated by FTIR...|$|E
40|$|A test {{facility}} {{was designed and}} constructed with the capability of isolating critical variables for controlling the novel membrane dehumidification-enabled cooling system?s operation parameters {{as well as for}} acquiring preliminary membrane and cooling system performance measurements. The completed {{test facility}} consisted of two systems: 1) the feed-air system, which simulated the inlet-air conditions and performed the feed-air dehumidification and sensible cooling and 2) the vacuum system, which enabled the feed-air dehumidification by evacuating the membrane permeate side. The feed-air system as constructed was able to supply membrane-inlet flow rates up to 10 scfm over a range of temperature and relative humidity conditions, including 90 ?F and 90 %RH, which was specified by the project sponsor. In addition, the feed-air system components included a membrane module installation site for dehumidification as well as a sensible cooling system to cool the membrane-outlet air to the 55 ?F and 50 %RH conditions again specified by the sponsor. Measurement stations were placed at the membrane-inlet, membrane-outlet, and the sensible cooler outlet to measure the temperature and relative humidity at these critical locations. The vacuum system as built used a Pfeiffer DUO 10 Vacuum Pump with a 7 cfm pumping capacity, which was preceded by a 60 plate heat exchanger with an effective area of 2. 05 m^(2) and an Oerlikon-Leybold WA 250 roots blower. The air leakage in the vacuum system was calculated to be less than 1 % of the theoretical <b>air</b> <b>permeation</b> through the membrane module. Finally, the apparatus was constructed with the capability of measuring the power consumption of the equipment used for the dehumidification and sensible cooling process. The functionality of the test facility was demonstrated through preliminary testing of the membrane module and the operation of the complete cooling system.

40|$|The {{objective}} of this research work is to understand the molecular mechanism involved in physical aging of amorphous glassy polymers. Free volume and segmental mobility arguments are commonly used to explain both the gas transport process and the physical aging of glassy polymers. Hence, gas permeation through glassy polymeric membranes is considered as an attractive tool to detect any time dependent changes of polymer free volume. Especially, emphasis is placed, in this work, on determining whether or not an experimental routine affects the time dependent changes of glassy polymeric membranes. In the first part (Chapter 5), permeability data of oxygen and nitrogen were obtained from <b>air</b> <b>permeation</b> experiments under different pressures using dense polyphenylene oxide (PPO) membranes of different thicknesses, after the membranes were almost fully stabilized. Opposite trends were observed with respect to oxygen and nitrogen as their permeabilities changed with changes in feed pressure and membrane thickness. Moreover, the pressure effect on oxygen permeability was reversed when the membrane was flipped upside down. Attempts were made to interpret the above experimental observations within a framework of entropy and enthalpy effect on the energy barrier for gas permeation and the change in void space in the cross-sectional direction of a dense PPO membrane. In the second part (Chapter 6), resemblance of aging curves of gas separation membranes to visco-elastic response curves was observed for all the studied membranes. Membrane aging curves consist of elastic and viscous components. It was further concluded that the elastic component of polymer relaxation was enhanced when membranes were aged at lower pressures while the viscous component was enhanced at higher gas pressures. The transition from the elasticity dominant to the viscosity dominant region occurred more quickly for thicker membranes. In the third part (Chapter 7), the effect of gas pressure on membrane aging was studied thoroughly by applying feed gas pressure continuously or by reducing the feed gas pressure intermittently. The effect {{of pressure on the}} physical aging of PPO membranes was demonstrated by monitoring the time dependence of the permeability and selectivity of the membranes. In general, gas pressure decelerated the physical aging process, especially in earlier stages of the membrane life. Also, the aging of thin membranes is greater than the aging of thick membranes, under all applied gas pressures. In some experiments, anti-trade-off effect, i. e. the decrease in the selectivity together with the decrease in permeability, was observed. A plausible explanation was proposed based on a dual gas permeation model...|$|E
