5|$|The Navy was {{reasonably}} {{pleased with}} the first ship, Bayan, and decided to order another cruiser {{after the start of}} the Russo-Japanese War in February 1904. Russian shipyards were still unavailable, so the Navy decided to simply order a repeat with minor modifications based on war experience. This was an attempt to minimize the work load on the Naval Technical Committee (Morskoi tekhnicheskii komitet), but they proved to require more attention than planned and a contract was not signed until 20 April 1905. The contract specified that all drawings would be turned over to allow for the construction of two identical ships in St. Petersburg, using newly available slipways. These changes generally added weight and the armor was reduced in thickness to compensate, although the change from Harvey armor to more resistant Krupp armor meant that there was little <b>actual</b> <b>loss</b> in protection.|$|E
5|$|In September 2011, the District Court granted Apple's {{motion to}} dismiss for lack of Article III {{standing}} and failure to state a claim, but gave the plaintiffs leave to amend their complaint, thereby not shutting out the claims permanently. The court ruled that without a showing of legal damages compensable under current law, the plaintiffs had not shown they sustained injury in fact by the defendants' actions. The problem facing the plaintiffs is {{the current state of}} electronic privacy law, the issue being that there is no national privacy law that provides for compensatory damages for breach of privacy, and this is the same issue faced by victims of data breaches, as breaches, per se, sustain no legal damages without a showing of actual and measurable harm such as monetary loss. Under U.S. law as of July 2012, it is only when a data breach results in <b>actual</b> <b>loss</b> as defined by applicable law that compensable damages arise. The case remained on the California court's docket as of July 2012.|$|E

25|$|Contributory {{negligence}} is a mitigatory defence, whereby a claimant's damages {{are reduced}} {{in accordance with}} the percentage of contribution made by the claimant to the loss or damage suffered. Thus, in evaluating a collision between two vehicles, for example, if the wronged driver were not wearing a seatbelt, he would most likely be contributorily negligent. The court will then quantify the damages for the <b>actual</b> <b>loss</b> or damage sustained, and then reduce the amount paid to the claimant by 20%. Contributory negligence can also function as a full defence, when it is assessed at 100%, as in Jayes v IMI Kynoch.|$|E
25|$|Retrospectively rated {{insurance}} {{is a method}} of establishing a premium on large commercial accounts. The final premium {{is based on the}} insured's <b>actual</b> <b>loss</b> experience during the policy term, sometimes subject to a minimum and maximum premium, with the final premium determined by a formula. Under this plan, the current year's premium is based partially (or wholly) on the current year's losses, although the premium adjustments may take months or years beyond the current year's expiration date. The rating formula is guaranteed in the insurance contract. Formula: retrospective premium = converted loss + basic premium Ã— tax multiplier. Numerous variations of this formula have been developed and are in use.|$|E
25|$|The {{concept of}} {{community}} restitution was not {{authorized by the}} former U.S. federal law. Also under that law, restitution was struck down where aggrieved parties were not identified and actual damages or loss caused were not evaluated with exactitude. The District Court is without power to order restitution of an amount greater than the <b>actual</b> <b>loss</b> caused by the offense for which conviction was had, regardless of a presentence report indicating a greater amount of total losses. The order to make restitution cannot extend to sums pertaining to crimes for which the defendant was neither indicted, tried, nor convicted. There {{seems to be a}} circuit split as to whether a defendant can be ordered to repay money given by the government as part of a sting operation. Under , sentencing courts are permitted to impose restitution as a condition of release to the extent agreed to by the government and defendant in a plea agreement.|$|E

[...] The deliberate hiding of Stephen's stories, remaining silent to his family after the war's end and encoding his journals, mirrors the <b>actual</b> <b>loss</b> of record and stories from veterans in post-war Britain. Elizabeth's search for that history is a process of recovering that memory in order to gain a greater emotional relationships with her grandfather, to whom she had never felt connected. Writing in the British Medical Journal, the medical doctor Paul Slade described reading about this investigation of another person's history to illuminate how [...] "superficial" [...] his own patient histories practice had been.|$|E
500|$|According to {{biologists}} {{from the}} State of California and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, the atypical low {{flow in the}} river along with high fish return numbers and high water temperatures allowed for a gill rot disease to kill at least 33,000salmon in September 2002, before they could reproduce. [...] The die-off was downstream of the Trinity inflow, and the salmon of the Trinity were impacted {{to a greater degree}} than the Klamath as the Trinity run was at its peak.

500|$|Following {{discussions between}} the Office of Fair Trading, the Financial Ombudsman Service, the Financial Services Authority {{and the major}} banks, {{proceedings}} were issued on 27 July 2007 in a test case against the banks to determine the legality and enforceability of certain charges relating to unauthorised overdrafts. It is argued that these are contrary to the Unfair Terms in Consumer Contracts Regulations 1999; Schedule 2(e) of which gives a non-exhaustive list of terms which may be regarded as unfair, such as a term requiring a consumer who fails in his obligation to pay a disproportionately high sum in compensation. Penalty charges are irrecoverable at common law. The precedent for this was Dunlop Pneumatic Tyre Co. Ltd. v New Garage and Motor Co. Ltd. [...] AC 79 along with Murray v Leisure Play [...] EWCA Civ 963, where it was held that a contractual party can only recover damages for an <b>actual</b> <b>loss</b> or liquidated losses. The Royal Bank of Scotland Group maintained that its charges were fair and enforceable and stated it intended to defend its position vigorously. On 24 April 2008, the High Court found that although these charges could not constitute penalties, they are challengeable under the Unfair Contract Terms Act 1977 and the Unfair Terms in Consumer Contracts Regulations 1999. On 26 February 2009, the Court of Appeal ruled that fees for unauthorised overdrafts and bounced cheques are subject to regulation by the OFT under these rules.|$|E

2500|$|For {{periodic}} functions, {{both the}} Fourier transform and the DTFT comprise only a discrete set of frequency components (Fourier series), and the transforms diverge at those frequencies.

But the same spectral information can be discerned from just one cycle of the periodic function, since all the other cycles are identical. Similarly, finite-duration functions can be represented as a Fourier series, with no <b>actual</b> <b>loss</b> of information except that the periodicity of the inverse transform is a mere artifact.

2500|$|As for the {{candidate}} who led the coalition into the general election, Berlusconi experienced an <b>actual</b> <b>loss</b> of support from Union of Christian and Centre Democrats (UDC), who asked for a return of the electoral law to a proportional system (which would most likely favour them) and a primary election to formally decide the alliance's candidate for Prime Minister. When the party list representation system was restored (albeit a form {{very different from the}} UDC proposal) and Marco Follini, critic of several reforms imposed by Berlusconi on the whole coalition, resigned from the UDC secretaryship, the possibility of a change of leadership inside the House of Freedoms was significantly reduced. On 27 October 2005, Lorenzo Cesa was appointed as new UDC secretary, becoming the successor of Follini himself. The coalition announced a [...] "three-forwards" [...] system, meaning that the Prime Ministerial candidate will be the political leader, among Casini, Fini and Berlusconi, whose party will win most votes. Since Berlusconi's party was known to be by far the largest one, it was understood that Berlusconi was the actual candidate.|$|E

40|$|Why are spreads on {{corporate}} bonds much wider {{than would be}} implied by expected losses from default? Previous explanations of this puzzle have assumed that investors can diversify away the risk that <b>actual</b> <b>losses</b> in a corporate bond portfolio will exceed expected losses. However, the skewness {{in the distribution of}} corporate bond returns implies that achieving such diversification will require an extraordinarily large portfolio. We present evidence from the market for collateralised debt obligations suggesting that such large portfolios are unattainable. Hence, investors always face the risk that <b>actual</b> <b>losses</b> will exceed expectations. Credit spreads are so wide because they compensate investors for such risk. ...|$|R
