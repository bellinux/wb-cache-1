The original panelists were Pat Buchanan, <b>Al</b> <b>Hunt,</b> Mark Shields and Robert Novak. When Buchanan left the network to run for president, Margaret Warner, Mona Charen, and later Margaret Carlson and Kate O'Beirne became regular panelists.|$|E

His {{status as a}} well-known print reporter brought a sense of credibility to the fledgling new network, and Novak soon created a weekly interview show that Evans co-hosted. Novak became a regular panel member of The McLaughlin Group in 1982, starring alongside McLaughlin as well as Novak's personal friends <b>Al</b> <b>Hunt</b> and Mark Shields. Novak sparred frequently with McLaughlin {{despite the fact that}} they both held similar political views. He established a public image as a combative debater on the program. Novak then became the executive producer of Capital Gang, which also featured him as a key member of the show. He also took over as host of Crossfire from Pat Buchanan.|$|E

[...] et <b>al.</b> <b>Hunting</b> still {{represents}} a conservation problem for several animal species in Spain, where it is currently {{one of the main}} threats for endangered species or populations. Here, we analyze the effect of hunting on protected wild bird species in the province of Valencia (Eastern Spain), identifying the most affected bird groups to assess its impact on endangered species. To do that, we reviewed admissions data of shot non-game birds to “La Granja” Wildlife Rehabilitation Centre (Valencia) in the last decade (from 2000 to 2010). A total of 479 protected birds coming from Valencia province were admitted during that period. Most of these protected birds were admitted during the two different hunting periods in Spain, with 8...|$|R
25|$|Novak’s wife, Geraldine, began regular churchgoing in {{the early}} 1990s and {{eventually}} settled on St Patrick’s Catholic Church, Washington, D.C. One day she persuaded Novak, who had not attended religious services for nearly 30 years, to join her at Mass. The celebrant was Fr. Peter Vaghi, whom he had known before Vaghi switched from politics to the priesthood. Novak then started to go to Mass regularly and decided to convert a few years later. According to Novak, the turning point came when he visited Syracuse University to lecture. Before he spoke, he was seated at a dinner table near a female student who wore a cross necklace. Novak {{asked her if she}} was Catholic and she asked him the same. Novak said he had been going to Mass each Sunday for the last four years, but had not converted. “Mr Novak,” the young woman replied, “life is short, but eternity is forever.” That brief sentence chilled Novak, who felt the student had channeled the Holy Spirit. When he got home and told Geraldine, they {{decided it was time to}} convert. In May 1998 Novak was received into the Roman Catholic Church at the age of 67 and became a Traditionalist Catholic. Geraldine was already a Catholic. <b>Al</b> <b>Hunt,</b> Judy Woodruff, Fred Barnes, Margaret Carlson, Daniel Patrick Moynihan, Henry Hyde, and Rick Santorum attended Novak’s baptism, with some of them openly crying.|$|E
2500|$|The Anti-Defamation League {{has called}} Buchanan an [...] "unrepentant bigot" [...] who [...] "repeatedly demonizes Jews and {{minorities}} and openly affiliates with white supremacists." [...] "There's no doubt," [...] said Pulitzer Prize-winning columnist Charles Krauthammer, [...] "he makes subliminal appeals to prejudice." [...] Buchanan denies {{that he is}} antisemitic, {{and a number of}} his journalistic colleagues, including Murray Rothbard, Justin Raimondo, [...] Jack Germond, <b>Al</b> <b>Hunt</b> and Mark Shields, have defended him against the charge. As a member of the Reagan White House, he is accused of having suppressed the Reagan Justice Department's investigation into Nazi scientists brought to America by the OSS's Operation Paperclip. In the context of the Gulf War, on September 15, 1990, Buchanan appeared on The McLaughlin Group and said that [...] "there are only two groups that are beating the drums for war in the Middle East – the Israeli defense ministry and its 'amen corner' in the United States." [...] He also said: [...] "The Israelis want this war desperately because they want the United States to destroy the Iraqi war machine. They want us to finish them off. They don't care about our relations with the Arab world." [...] Furthermore, on The McLaughlin Group Buchanan has also made such comments as “‘Capitol Hill is Israeli occupied territory’ and ‘If you want to know ethnicity and power in the United States Senate, 13 members of the Senate are Jewish folks who are from 2 percent of the population. That is where real power is at…’” ...|$|E

30|$|The {{topic of}} what {{constitute}} a clear margin {{has long been}} under debate. Lately, there have been renewed discussions related to this topic (Houssami et al. 2014; Jagsi et <b>al.</b> 2014; <b>Hunt</b> & Sahin 2014; Buchholz et <b>al.</b> 2014; <b>Hunt</b> et <b>al.</b> 2014). Specifically, the new SSO guidelines (Moran et al. 2014) suggest using tumor on ink (tumor cells at the cut surface) as the definition for positive margin. In view of this, we also looked at the contribution of device in identification of positive margins on ink. In 18 % (30 / 165) of the cases the primary (main) lumpectomy specimen, prior to intra-operative assessment, had tumor on ink. In 73 % (22 / 30) of these cases with use of device the positive margins were identified. In 3.6 % (6 / 165) of the cases re-excision procedures were performed due to margins on ink. Of these, only 2.4 % (4 / 165) were due to failed detection of tumor cells at the margins.|$|R

40|$|Hunting moving targets: an {{extension}} to Bayesian methods in multimedia databases MULLER, Wolfgang, et al. It {{has been widely}} recognised {{that the difference between}} the level of abstraction of the formulation of a query (by example) and that of the desired result (usually an image with certain semantics) calls for the use of learning methods that try to bridge this gap. Cox et al. have proposed a Bayesian method to learn the user's preferences during each query. Cox et al. 's system, PicHunter is designed for optimal performance when the user is searching for a fixed target image. The performance of the system was evaluated using target testing, which ranks systems according to the number of interaction steps required to find the target, leading to simple, easily reproducible experiments. There are some aspects of image retrieval, however, which are not captured by this measure. In particular, the possibility of query drift (i. e. ~a moving target) is completely ignored. The algorithm proposed by Cox et al. does not cope well with a change of target at a late query stage, because it is assumed that user feedback is noisy, but consistent.

30|$|Based {{on earlier}} work (Blaxter 1993; Blaxter et <b>al.</b> 1994; <b>Hunt</b> et <b>al.</b> 2009) {{we chose the}} single-domain globins {{sequences}} from A. suum to serve as outgroup in our tests for selective regimes. In agreement with earlier work and our alignment (Additional file 1 : Figure S 1) with the sequences of the hemoglobins from A. suum and P. decipiens, the orthologous sequences of each domain indicated that the duplication occurred before {{the separation of the}} two species. We used this unrooted topology (Fig.  1 b) for our analysis of selective pressures during the evolution of these di-domain globins.|$|R
30|$|Fluid {{flow and}} solute {{transport}} in rock are macroscopic {{consequences of the}} pore structure, which integrates geometry (e.g., pore size and shape, pore size distribution; Bear 1972) and topology (e.g., pore connectivity; Dullien 1992). Especially when pore connectivity is low, topological factors outweigh the better known geometrical factors (Ewing and Horton 2002; Hu et <b>al.</b> 2012; <b>Hunt</b> et <b>al.</b> 2014). However, the prevalence of low pore connectivity in tight shales, and its impacts on fluid flow and chemical transport, is poorly documented and understood. This work examines the potential of low pore connectivity of typical American and Chinese shales, {{and its effects on}} fluid flow and chemical transport.|$|R

30|$|Nematode hemoglobins (Hbs, i.e. {{circulating}} globins) can be single-domain or di-domain (see Weber and Vinogradov 2001 for a review). These latter ones {{occur in}} the pseudocoelomic cavity, and assemble into octamers in the pig intestinal parasite Ascaris suum (Darawshe et al. 1987; De Baere et al. 1992). The globin gene diversity in nematodes is very large, and intron insertions and gene duplications were frequent in the nematode globin evolutionary history (Blaxter 1993; Hoogewijs et <b>al.</b> 2008; <b>Hunt</b> et <b>al.</b> 2009). However, di-domain Hbs are only known in the gut parasite ascarids A. suum and Pseudoterranova decipiens (Darawshe et al. 1987; Dixon et al. 1991).|$|R

30|$|This large {{study of}} suicide deaths in BD found that self-poisoning {{accounted}} for 36.7 % of all deaths, which is somewhat higher than other large studies (Chen et <b>al.</b> 2009; <b>Hunt</b> et <b>al.</b> 2006; Ösby et al. 2001), {{but within the}} published range from all reports (Schaffer et al. 2015 b).

30|$|Suicide by self-poisoning is a {{prevalent}} {{cause of}} death globally. Self-poisoning accounts for approximately {{a quarter of all}} suicides in England with females and the young being particularly vulnerable to this method of suicide (Camidge et al. 2003; Kapur et al. 2005). Methods of suicide deaths in BD vary across studies and countries, but self-poisoning deaths are consistently found to be the first or second most common method (Chen et al. 2009; Dennehy et al. 2011; Gos et <b>al.</b> 2009; <b>Hunt</b> et <b>al.</b> 2006; Isomets and Henriksson 1994; Keks et al. 2009; Ösby et al. 2001; Rihmer et al. 1990; Schaffer et al. 2014). Self-poisoning accounted for 25 – 30 % of deaths in the three largest studies that reported on BD suicide methods (Chen et <b>al.</b> 2009; <b>Hunt</b> et <b>al.</b> 2006; Ösby et al. 2001) and 17 – 53 % in the smaller studies (Angst et al. 2005; Clements et al. 2013; Crump et al. 2013; Harris and Barraclough 1997; Høyer et al. 2000; Ilgen et al. 2010; Karch et al. 2006; Kessing et al. 2005; Pompili et al. 2013 a; Schaffer et al. 2014; Takizawa 2012); however, there is a paucity of data specifically focusing on characterizing this subgroup of suicide deaths in BD. Furthermore, BD also presents as a vulnerable psychiatric population to self-poisoning with elevated prevalence among BD decedents relative to non-BD decedents (33.5 vs. 17.4 %; Schaffer et al. 2014) and schizophrenia decedents (34.9 vs. 17.4 %; Sinyor et al. 2015). Little is known about who is more likely to die from this method, which substances are ingested around the time of death, and which of these specific substances were ultimately lethal. In a small Finnish study examining 11 people with BD who died by self-poisoning suicide, lethal ingestion of an antipsychotic occurred in 45 % of cases, followed by 18 % with each of a tricyclic antidepressant, lithium, or combination of benzodiazepines (Isomets and Henriksson 1994).|$|R
