40|$|In 1990, the US Geological Survey, in {{cooperation}} with the US Department of Energy, Idaho Operations Office, established the Lithologic Core Storage Library at the Idaho National Engineering Laboratory (INEL). The facility was established to consolidate, catalog, and permanently store nonradioactive drill cores <b>and</b> <b>cuttings</b> from investigations of the subsurface conducted at the INEL, and to provide a location for researchers to examine, sample, and test these materials. The facility is open by appointment to researchers for examination, sampling, and testing of cores <b>and</b> <b>cuttings.</b> This report describes the facility <b>and</b> cores <b>and</b> <b>cuttings</b> stored at the facility. Descriptions of cores <b>and</b> <b>cuttings</b> include the well names, well locations, and depth intervals available. Most cores <b>and</b> <b>cuttings</b> stored at the facility were drilled at or near the INEL, on the eastern Snake River Plain; however, two cores drilled on the western Snake River Plain are stored for comparative studies. Basalt, rhyolite, sedimentary interbeds, and surficial sediments compose the majority of cores <b>and</b> <b>cuttings,</b> most of which are continuous from land surface to their total depth. The deepest core stored at the facility was drilled to 5, 000 feet below land surface. This report describes procedures and researchers` responsibilities for access to the facility, and examination, sampling, and return of materials...|$|R

5|$|In {{addition}} to their large compound eyes, wasps have several simple eyes known as ocelli, which are typically arranged in a triangle just forward of the vertex of the head.

40|$|In {{oil and gas}} {{drilling}} operations, {{predictions of}} pressure losses <b>and</b> <b>cuttings</b> concentration in the annulus are very complex due to the combination of interacting drilling parameters. Past studies have proposed many empirical correlations to estimate pressure losses <b>and</b> <b>cuttings</b> concentration. However, these developed correlations are limited to their experimental data range and setup, and hence, they cannot be applicable to all cases. CFD methods have the advantages of handling complex multiphase flow problems, as well as, an unlimited number of physical and operational conditions. The present study employs the inhomogeneous (Eulerian-Eulerian) model to simulate a two-phase solid-fluid flow and predict pressure losses <b>and</b> <b>cuttings</b> concentration in eccentric horizontal annuli {{as a function of}} varying drilling parameters: fluid velocity, diameter ratio (ratio of inner pipe diameter to outer pipe diameter), inner pipe rotation speed, and fluid type. Experimental data for pressure losses <b>and</b> <b>cuttings</b> concentration from previous literature compared very well with simulation data, confirming the validity of the current model. The study shows how reliable CFD methods can replicate the actual, yet complex oil and gas drilling operations...|$|R
40|$|Project {{drawn up}} {{as a part}} of {{bachelor}} studies of mechanical engineering branch brings suggestion of technologies that are usable for manufacturing of slider, which is a part of turn restrictor mechanism produced by the company TOKOZ, and presents assessment of its suitability.
