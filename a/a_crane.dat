5|$|Both ships carried one {{aircraft}} catapult {{for a pair}} of Heinkel He 60 biplane reconnaissance float planes. They were {{equipped with}} <b>a</b> <b>crane</b> to retrieve the aircraft after landing. The He 60s were later replaced by the monoplane Arado Ar 196 by 1939. Leipzigs catapult was located between the funnel and the forward superstructure, while Nürnbergs was placed aft of the funnel.|$|E

5|$|In 1964 {{the stones}} {{in the circle}} were {{disturbed}} by agricultural activity. It was then decided that the site would be excavated, a project which was ordered by the Ministry of Public Building and Works and carried out in May 1965 under the directorship of Geoffrey J. Wainwright. The 28 stones were moved from the site using <b>a</b> <b>crane</b> to permit the archaeologists to excavate the area beneath them.|$|E

5|$|The beam {{of light}} seen shining from beneath the UFO in the episode was {{achieved}} by compositing several shots together, with elements including <b>a</b> <b>crane</b> carrying a spotlight—borrowed from the Canadian Coast Guard—and the spray from an aerosol combined to create the final shot.|$|E
5|$|The {{ship was}} fitted with flying-off {{platforms}} {{mounted on the}} roofs of 'B' and 'X' turrets in 1918, from which fighters and reconnaissance aircraft could launch. In 1932 the platforms {{were removed from the}} turrets and a trainable catapult was installed on her quarterdeck, along with <b>a</b> <b>crane</b> to recover a seaplane. The catapult and crane were removed by March 1937.|$|E

5|$|There is {{a variety}} of stained glass within the {{building}} including coats of arms, a sundial and depictions of various birds. A window {{to the west of}} main range has medieval stained glass including a picture of a swan ringing a bell, as at the Bishop's Palace, Wells, with others including a peacock, a heron, an owl, <b>a</b> <b>crane</b> and a bird with a bell attached to one leg.|$|E
5|$|Before {{specialized}} {{bulk carriers}} existed, shippers had two methods to move bulk goods by ship. In the first method, longshoremen loaded the cargo into sacks, stacked the sacks onto pallets, {{and put the}} pallets into the cargo hold with <b>a</b> <b>crane.</b> The second method required the shipper to charter an entire ship and spend {{time and money to}} build plywood bins into the holds. Then, to guide the cargo through the small hatches, wooden feeders and shifting boards had to be constructed. These methods were slow and labor-intensive. As with the container ship, the problem of efficient loading and unloading has driven the evolution of the bulk carrier.|$|E
50|$|Several {{breakdown}} cranes {{are preserved}} in the various Australian states. Examples preserved in New South Wales as X10 Class and include 1048 <b>a</b> 30T steam <b>crane</b> built by Cowans Sheldon, preserved at Rothbury. 1050 <b>a</b> 50T steam <b>crane</b> built by Craven Bros, preserved at Dorrigo. 1055 <b>a</b> 35T steam <b>crane</b> converted to diesel built by Ransome & Rapier, preserved at Canberra. 1060 <b>a</b> 120T steam <b>crane</b> converted to diesel built by Krupp Ardelt, preserved at Dorrigo. 1073 <b>a</b> 70T steam <b>crane</b> built by Craven Bros converted to diesel, preserved Richmond Main. 1080 <b>a</b> 50T steam <b>crane</b> built by Industrial Brownhoist, preserved Junee. 1081 <b>a</b> 50T steam <b>crane</b> built by Industrial Brownhoist, preserved Dorrigo.|$|R

50|$|<b>A</b> knuckleboom <b>crane</b> appears {{similar to}} <b>a</b> {{standard}} <b>crane,</b> {{except that the}} boom articulates at the 'knuckle' near the middle, letting it fold back like a finger. This provides a compact size for storage and manoeuvring.|$|R
5|$|Between 1903 and 1907 Kearsarge {{served in}} the North Atlantic Fleet, and from 1907 to 1909 she sailed {{as part of the}} Great White Fleet. In 1909 she was {{decommissioned}} for modernization, which was finished in 1911. In 1915 she {{served in the}} Atlantic, and between 1916 and 1919 she served as a training ship. She was converted into <b>a</b> <b>crane</b> ship in 1920, renamed Crane Ship No. 1 in 1941, and sold for scrap in 1955. She was the only United States Navy battleship to not be named after a state.|$|E
5|$|Hood was {{initially}} fitted with flying-off platforms mounted {{on top of}} 'B' and 'X' turrets, from which Fairey Flycatchers could launch. During her 1929–31 refit, the platform was removed from 'X' turret and a trainable, folding catapult was installed on her quarterdeck, along with <b>a</b> <b>crane</b> to recover a seaplane. She embarked a Fairey IIIF from No. 444 Flight of the Royal Air Force. During the 1932 West Indies cruise, the catapult proved {{to be difficult to}} operate in anything but a calm sea, as it was frequently awash in bad weather. The catapult and crane were removed in 1932, along with the flying-off platform on 'B' turret.|$|E
5|$|In 1935, {{the ship}} had an {{aircraft}} catapult installed, along with <b>a</b> <b>crane</b> to handle floatplanes. The following year, the single 8.8cm guns were replaced with a new triaxially stabilized twin-mount; two other twin mounts were added on the rear superstructure. Fire control directors for the anti-aircraft guns were also installed. After emerging from this refit, Königsberg was employed as a gunnery training ship. During the Spanish Civil War in the late 1930s, the ship participated in non-intervention patrols, during which she forced Republicans to surrender a German freighter they had seized.|$|E

5|$|Indianas keel {{was laid}} on 20 September 1939 at the Newport News Shipbuilding and Drydock Company in Newport News, Virginia. She was {{launched}} on 21 November 1941; during the fitting out process, the former battleship , {{which had been}} rebuilt as <b>a</b> <b>crane</b> ship, lowered the 16-inch guns into their turret mountings. Indiana was commissioned into the fleet on 30 April 1942. After shakedown operations, she was sent directly to the Solomon Islands; Indiana arrived off Guadalcanal on 9 November 1942 and replaced her sister South Dakota, which {{was in need of}} repairs. Indianas operations off Guadalcanal consisted primarily of shore bombardment in support of the Marines fighting on the island.|$|E
5|$|John Cena and The Great Khali also {{continued}} to feud over the WWE Championship. Following the controversial ending to their match at Judgment Day, where Cena forced Khali to submit while his foot was underneath the bottom rope, meaning Cena should have released the hold, Khali challenged Cena to a Falls Count Anywhere match for One Night Stand. Cena accepted, and Khali attacked him, performing a Chokebomb. At One Night Stand, Cena retained his title by pinning Khali after performing an FU off <b>a</b> <b>crane.</b>|$|E
5|$|No pre-dreadnoughts served postWorld War II as armed ships; {{the last}} serving pre-dreadnought was the former SMS Hessen, {{which was used}} as a target ship by the Soviet union into the early 1960s as the Tsel. The hull of the former USS Kearsarge (BB-5) served as <b>a</b> <b>crane</b> ship from 1920 until its {{scrapping}} in 1955. The hulk of the ex-USS Oregon (BB-3) {{was used as a}}n ammunition barge at Guam until 1948, after which she was scrapped in 1956.|$|E

30|$|The cradles {{of large}} mass are {{required}} to be lifted off a freight train whilst empty and replaced with a loaded cradle. To allow this loading and unloading of such heavy goods, automation is necessary. An option {{that would be very}} suitable is the use of <b>a</b> gantry <b>crane.</b> <b>A</b> gantry <b>crane</b> allows <b>an</b> empty cradle to be removed and replaced with a loaded cradle with ease.|$|R
