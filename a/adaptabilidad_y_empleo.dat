Ubiquitous computing is also changing the classic paradigm of information technology as it is forcing social and cultural changes. Determining factors affecting the use of ubiquitous services is essential to correctly define the characteristics of new value added services. However, this study investigates not only these factors, but also the moderating effect of previous experience. Due to the technological nature of ubiquitous services, previous experience alters the way in which potential users face these services. Findings suggest that previous experience changes the way in which antecedent relates to basic TAM constructs. The derived research models and empirical results also provide valuable indicators for future research and managerial guidelines for the successful adoption of ubiquitous computing servicesJunta de Andalucia.

40|$|Nowadays, data {{collection}} {{is a key}} process {{in the study of}} electrical power networks when searching for harmonics and a lack of balance among phases. In this context, the lack of data of any of the main electrical variables (phase-to-neutral voltage, phase-to-phase voltage, and current in each phase and power factor) adversely affects any time series study performed. When this occurs, a data imputation process must be accomplished in order to substitute the data that is missing for estimated values. This paper presents a novel missing data imputation method based on multivariate adaptive regression splines (MARS) and compares it with the well-known technique called multivariate imputation by chained equations (MICE).
