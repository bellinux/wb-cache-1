40|$|To {{investigate}} {{whether there is}} a relationship between the inherent maximum growth rate of a chick and its degree of developmental plasticity, we studied the effects of food restriction on morphological and physiological development in P-line (selected for high growth rates) and C-line (nonselected) chicks of the Japanese quail between 2 and 64 d of age. In each line, three groups were created; one group in which the chicks were fed ad lib. and two other groups in which the chicks received 70 % and 40 % of the line-specific <b>ad</b> <b>lib.</b> <b>feeding</b> levels, respectively. In all three groups, chick survival rates were very high, and no relationship was detected between feeding level and chick mortality. The experimental feeding levels strongly affected the chicks' attainment of body mass at all ages. In addition, at most ages the growth of the structural components (wing, tarsus, and head) were also significantly affected by the feeding experiment but to a much smaller extent than the body mass. The feeding levels also affected the achievement of female sexual maturity such that, {{at the end of the}} experiment, most of the ad lib. -fed females and none of the females that received 40 % of the <b>ad</b> <b>lib.</b> <b>feeding</b> level were laying eggs. In chicks of both lines that were fed ad lib., homeothermy was achieved at 7 d of age, but in chicks that received 40 % of the line-specific ad lib. levels, homeothermy was achieved after 15 - 22 d of age. Poikilothermic chicks (P- and C-line) that were relatively heavy for their age exhibited relatively high resting metabolic rates (RMRs) and peak metabolic rates (PMRs) for their age. In addition, a positive relationship was found between the chicks' relative mass and RMR (based on mass-based predictive equations). No relationship was detected between the chicks' relative body mass and their relative PMR (relative to mass-based predictive equations). With respect to the metabolic scope (i. e., PMR - RMR), Japanese quail chicks exhibited remarkable developmental plasticity: chicks with body masses that were 50 % lower than the normal growing chicks did exhibit a normal capacity of thermogenic heat production for their mass. Because no differences were found with respect to the level of plasticity of morphological and physiological development between the two strains, we conclude that the selection for high postnatal growth rates in P-strain chicks has not resulted in a in a higher vulnerability of these chicks to food restrictions...|$|E

The "area under the curve" (AUC) method employs a single oral dose of probe compound(s) followed by multiple blood sampling to obtain plasma concentration time curves. Separate injection of probe(s) followed by multiple blood sampling is used to calculate fractional elimination rate (K-el) and distribution pool space (S). The "steady state feeding" method relies on <b>ad</b> <b>lib.</b> <b>feeding</b> of a marked diet, with a single blood sample taken to measure steady state feeding concentration of probe(s); K-el is estimated from the decline in probe concentration in excreta after injection, with a single blood sample taken to estimate S.

The K-el values estimated using the steady state feeding protocol were significantly higher, and estimates of S and bioavailability consequently lower, compared with the AUC protocol. The AUC method relies on fewer assumptions and allows simultaneous comparisons of absorption by mediated and nonmediated (i. e., paracellular) mechanisms but cannot be easily applied to freely feeding animals.

40|$|ABSTRACT Both {{feed and}} water {{restriction}} of growing turkeys {{resulted in an}} increase in the basal levels of plasma growth hormone (GH). Restricted birds also showed an increased response to thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) stimulation. These changes were significantly greater in feed-restricted birds than in the water-restricted birds. After return to ad lib conditions, basal plasma GH levels remained elevated above control levels in both previously restricted groups. However, the GH response to TRH stimulation returned to normal during this period. The increase in GH secretion during undernutrition is a metabolic adjustment consistent with the known role of GH in glucose, protein and fat metabolism. The elevated GH levels present after return to adequate nutrition may aid compensatory growth. Feed and water restriction were equally effective in limiting the growth of young turkey poults. Body weight gain and feed efficiency were severely affected during the first 3 weeks of restriction, but improved during the 4 th week. Return to ad lib conditions resulted in compensatory growth and markedly improved feed efficiency in both restricted groups. Feed-restricted birds showed a significant increase in water consumption after 8 days of re-striction. This polydipsia may result from intermittent feeding of hungry animals.

40|$|While feeding is rewarding, {{the feeling}} of {{satiation}} has been theorized to be aversive under certain conditions. Using a food-restriction model of overeating developed in our laboratory the results presented here suggest that overeating, and the resulting experience of satiation, is capable of supporting a conditioned taste avoidance. Rats had either <b>ad</b> <b>lib</b> (n= 8) or restricted (n= 24) food access (receiving 50 % of the food eaten by <b>ad</b> <b>lib</b> fed rats) for 8 days. All rats were then given 24 hr access to a 0. 1 % saccharin solution, and two groups of food-restricted rats were given access to either 100 % of the food eaten by the <b>ad</b> <b>lib</b> rats, or <b>ad</b> <b>lib</b> food access. This cycle was given once in Experiment 1 and three times (with 4 days between cycles) in Experiment 2. Rats were then returned to their previous feeding schedules for 1 day before being placed on <b>ad</b> <b>lib</b> food access until feeding was approximately equal for all groups. Rats were then tested for saccharin consumption in a two-bottle choice test of saccharin and water. Rats that were overeating {{at the time of}} the one-bottle saccharin acquisition trial(s) were expected to experience a change in internal state as a result of the influx in calories and associate this with the novel saccharin solution. This change in state should result in an avoidance of the saccharin at the two-bottle test. In Experiment 1, at the two-bottle test, the restricted-ad <b>lib</b> <b>feeding</b> rats (those that overate) showed reduced saccharin consumption compared to the <b>ad</b> <b>lib</b> control rats, although these results were not significant. In Experiment 2, after three acquisition trials, the restricted-ad <b>lib</b> <b>feeding</b> group showed significantly reduced saccharin consumption compared to all other groups. Experiment 3 sought to understand the learning component of the taste avoidance by making the saccharin familiar. Half of the rats were given 8 days of pre-exposure to the saccharin solution, after which they underwent the experimental procedure used in Experiment 2, with half the rats on food restriction. Because they had previously shown the largest difference in saccharin consumption, only the rest-adlib (n= 32) and adlib-adlib (n= 32) groups were used in this experiment. After 8 days, all rats received 24 hr access to the saccharin solution, and the food restricted rats received access to <b>ad</b> <b>lib</b> food. Non-restricted rats received the saccharin without a change in feeding. Saccharin consumption was measured and it was found that {{at the time of the}} two-bottle test, prior saccharin exposure attenuated the decreased saccharin consumption seen in the rest-adlib group in Experiments 1 and 2. Overall, the results of these studies showed that the experimental design was successful in inducing overeating in previously restricted rats. When this bout of overeating was paired with a novel saccharin solution, rats later showed reduced consumption of the solution even after feeding levels returned to baseline.

Binge eating may become an unhealthy coping strategy as comfort food can provide emotional relief and therefore teach that eating can alleviate stress and boredom. This may negatively reinforce binge eating as a way to reduce negative emotions. We used a rodent model to explore this hypothesis. We looked at the way in which a high fat diet, versus a diet of regular rat chow, may affect HiS and LoS rats? deprivation induced hyperactivity (DIH) and startle amplitude, both measures of stress management. Selectively bred rats who differ in vulnerability to stress are used to model individual differences in people. Over ten days the rats were fed rat chow with corn oil or mineral oil.

40|$|Several {{studies have}} implicated fatty-acids as {{inflammatory}} regulators, {{suggesting that there}} may be a direct role for common dietary fatty-acids in regulating innate immune cells. In humans, a single high-fat meal increases systemic cytokines and leukocytes. In mice, short term high-fat feeding increases adipose tissue (AT) leukocytes and alters the inflammatory profile of AT macrophages. We have seen that short term high fat feeding to C 57 BL/ 6 J male mice increases palmitic and oleic acid within AT depots, but oleic acid increase is highest in the mesenteric AT (MAT). In vitro, oleic acid increases M 2 macrophage markers (CD 206, MGL 1, and ARG 1) in a murine macrophage cell line, while addition of palmitic acid is able to inhibit that increase. Three day supplementation of a chow diet, with oleic acid, induced an increase in M 2 macrophage markers in the MAT, but not in the epididymal AT. We tested whether increases in M 2 macrophages occur during short term <b>ad</b> <b>lib</b> <b>feeding</b> of a high fat diet, containing oleic acid. Experiments revealed two distinct populations of macrophages were altered by a three day high milk-fat diet. One population, phenotypically intermediate for F 4 / 80, showed diet-induced increases in CD 206, an anti-inflammatory marker characteristic of M 2 macrophages intrinsic to the AT. Evidence for a second population, phenotypically F 4 / 80 (HI) CD 11 b(HI) macrophages, showed increased association with the MAT following short term feeding that is dependent on the adhesion molecule, ICAM- 1. Collectively, we have shown that short term feeding of a high-fat diet changes two population of macrophages, and that dietary oleic acid is responsible for increases in M 2 macrophage polarization...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 1977 The {{epidemiology}} of nematode {{infections in}} ewes and lambs on irrigated pastures was investigated during one reproductive cycle {{in a commercial}} operation in Central Oregon. Primary objectives were to determine the sources of parasitism, the effect on lamb weight gains, {{and the effectiveness of}} control procedures in minimizing the detrimental effects of parasitism. Methodology included fecal nematode egg counts, animal necropsies and the use of tracer lambs. The relationships between blood trace mineral levels, parasitism and suboptimal weight gain in lambs and calves were also examined. High pasture burdens of infective larvae were found in spring and early summer from overwintering larvae and in late summer from autoinfestation by ewes and lambs. Lamb weight gain from March until mid-July was 0. 48 lb/head/day. From mid-July until September when the study terminated, lamb weight gain declined (- 0. 03 to 0. 28 lb/head/day). Parasite burdens were low to moderate early in the grazing period, but increased markedly during the mid-July to September period, despite monthly deworming of the flock. It appeared that parasite burdens, high summer temperatures and the lack of shade, and possibly low cobalt and selenium levels were responsible for the late summer decline in weight gain. Evaluation of control measures indicated that intensive deworming prior to parturition eliminated arrested or inhibited larvae in the ewes. The periparturient relaxation of resistance, however, permitted development of infective larvae acquired from the pre- and post-lambing pastures. Maturation of these larvae caused a marked rise in post-parturient egg per gram counts of the ewes with subsequent relatively high rates of pasture contamination. Monthly deworming of the flock was moderately effective in reducing parasite burdens and pasture contamination. Alternate grazing of pastures by cattle and sheep, and <b>ad</b> <b>lib.</b> <b>feeding</b> of phenothiazine in salt were not effective as control measures...|$|E

40|$|The {{effects of}} the {{halothane}} allele and other genes for rapid lean growth were examined in pigs grown {{in an environment of}} high temperature/transport stress. The halothane allele n was segregating with its normal alternative N in a line which had been selected for rapid lean growth and in an unselected control line. Pigs of the three halothane segregants, NN, Nn and nn from both lines were grown on <b>ad</b> <b>lib.</b> <b>feeding</b> from 25 to 90 kg liveweight. Relative to the control, the selected line had faster, more efficient growth with lower 90 kg backfat thickness. Least square means in the selected and control lines were 0. 87 and 0. 77 ± 0. 01 kg for daily liveweight gain, 2. 63 and 2. 98 ± 0. 03 for food conversion ratio and 13. 1 and 18. 7 ± 0. 3 mm for backfat. The halothane allele reduced appetite, growth rate, food conversion ratio and backfat. Means of the NN, Nn and nn segregants were 2. 46, 2. 31 and 2. 10 ± 0. 04 kg for daily food intake, 0. 86, 0. 84 and 0. 78 ± 0. 01 kg for daily liveweight gain, 2. 89, 2. 77 and 2. 74 ± 0. 03 for food conversion ratio and 16. 7, 15. 8 and 15. 1 ± 0. 4 mm for backfat. The average effect of the n allele on food intake and growth rate was higher in the selected than the control line. Mortality rates were increased by the halothane allele.

40|$|An {{experiment}} {{was conducted to}} study {{the effect of a}} diet with high structural component on the performance of ad lib and intermittently-fed broiler chickens; whether the supplemented enzymes had effect on ileal viscosity and litter quality. Broiler chicken were given, either ad lib or intermittently, barley-oat-wheat based experimental diet in whole grains and commercial maize-wheat based diet contain less fibrous content from 11 days of age, in a 2 × 2 factorial arrangement. For <b>ad</b> <b>lib</b> <b>feeding,</b> birds got access to feed constantly for 18 hours through continuous light and 6 hours darkness in two rooms. For intermittent feeding, in one room, feed was available for three 1 -h feeding bouts plus one 2 -h feeding bout per day. This was completed by frequently removal of feed and switching off the light at night, from day 7 to 14. From day 14 and onward, it was changed to 5 1 -h feeding bout/day {{until the end of the}} experiment. Litter quality were scored at day 22. The empty gizzard weights recorded from intermittently and ad lib fed birds at 29 and 34 & 35 days of age respectively. The ileal viscosity was also measured at day 34 & 35. The structural component interacted on adaptability of broiler chickens to intermittent feeding indicated by higher feed intake of diet consisting of whole grains (barley, oat and wheat) than wheat-maize based diet. For the empty gizzard weights from intermittently fed birds there was no significant difference at day 29, however the gizzard weights differed from ad lib fed birds at the end of experiment. Furthermore, the reduction of ileal viscosity due to enzyme supplementation (Wang et al., 1992), has found in birds fed barley-oat-wheat based diet. In conclusion, broiler chickens quickly adapted to intermittent feeding through high structural component diets, without reduction of performance. With improved feed efficiency and enzyme supplementation, the ileal viscosity was not as high as when diet without enzymes (Classen, 1996...|$|E
