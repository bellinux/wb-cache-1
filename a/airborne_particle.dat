40|$|Background: Surgical-site infections due to {{intraoperative}} contamination are chiefly ascribable to <b>airborne</b> <b>particles</b> carrying microorganisms. The {{purpose of}} this study is to identify the actions that increase the number of <b>airborne</b> <b>particles</b> in the operating room. Methods: Two surgeons and two surgical nurses performed three patterns of physical movements to mimic intraoperative actions, such as preparing the instrument table, gowning and donning/doffing gloves, and preparing for total knee arthroplasty. The generation and behavior of <b>airborne</b> <b>particles</b> were filmed using a fine particle visualization system, and the number of <b>airborne</b> <b>particles</b> in 2. 83 m 3 of air was counted using a laser particle counter. Each action was repeated five times, and the particle measurements were evaluated through one-way analysis of variance multiple comparison tests followed by Tukey-Kramer and Bonferroni-Dunn multiple comparison tests for post hoc analysis. Statistical significance was defined as a P value ≤. 01. Results: A large number of <b>airborne</b> <b>particles</b> were observed while unfolding the surgical gown, removing gloves, and putting the arms through the sleeves of the gown. Although numerous <b>airborne</b> <b>particles</b> were observed while applying the stockinet and putting on large drapes for preparation of total knee arthroplasty, fewer particles (0. 3 - 2. 0 μm in size) were detected at the level of the operating table under laminar airflow compared to actions performed in a non-ventilated preoperative room (P <. 01). Conclusions: The results of this study suggest that surgical staff should avoid unnecessary actions that produce a large number of <b>airborne</b> <b>particles</b> near a sterile area and that laminar airflow has the potential to reduce the incidence of bacterial contamination...|$|R

The model was employed to perform simulation to predict the distribution of airflow and movement of the <b>airborne</b> <b>particles</b> inside the operating theater at a steady-state condition. The <b>airborne</b> <b>particles</b> were modeled as discrete particles which were released from the exposed body surface of the surgical staffs {{at a rate of}} 10 CFU/s. The effect of laminar inlet air flow velocity on the <b>airborne</b> <b>particles</b> concentration around the operating table was examined. It was found that the air flows straight downward from the air-conditioning diffuser towards the middle of the operating table. However, the existence of the medical lamp causes a vortex air flow condition below it. Air also penetrates the ultra-clean area {{on the opposite side of}} the operating table. The <b>airborne</b> <b>particles</b> are washed away from the vicinity of the operating table by the air flow. This is more effective when the supply air flow velocity is high. At low air flow velocity, some particles appear to penetrate into the ultra-clean area near the edges of the operating table. At higher air flow velocity, the <b>airborne</b> <b>particles</b> seem to be more effectively washed away from this region.

5000|$|The {{next major}} {{development}} in technological improvement {{that came out}} of the 1970s was in 1976 by Stoffel with the development of a magnetic sector RTSPMS technique that had a direct-inlet mass spectrometry (DIMS) also known as particle-inlet mass spectrometry (PIMS). [...] The PIMS instrument was the first to have a deferentially-pumped direct inlet that consists of a stainless steel capillary, followed by a skimmer and conical collimator that focuses the sample into a particle beam that goes on to the ionization region. This type of inlet system is what modern on-line aerosol mass spectrometer instruments use today. In 1982 Sinha and Fredlander developed the particle analysis by mass spectrometry (PAMS), this method was the first to incorporate the optical detection of particles followed by laser desorption/ionization (LDI) in a RTSPMS technique. Prior to this point all RTSPMS methods used surface desorption/ionization (SDI) which consist of a heated metal that ionized the samples. [...] The LDI method involves the sample being hit with a continuous wave, where the particle absorbs photons, and undergoes both desorption and ionization by the same pulse. LDI has several advantages over SDI for on-line single particle mass spectrometry, as such since its development it has been the primary ionization method for RTSPMS.The last major step in RTSPMS development was in 1994 by Prather. Prather developed the aerosol time-of-flight mass spectrometry (ATOFMS), this method was the first that allow for simultaneous measurement of size and composition of single <b>airborne</b> <b>particle.</b> This techniques was different then previous methods in that instead of using the unreliable method of using light scattering signal intensity to measure particle size, this method uses a two laser system that allows for aerodynamic sizing.|$|E

In this study, airborne particulate was collected at an urban, a suburban, and a ruralsite in central Taiwan. The organic solvent extracts of airborne particulate were examined in human MCF- 7 and T 47 D-KBluc breastcancer cells. We observed significant increases in reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation in MCF- 7 cells after treatment with theparticulate extracts whereas aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) antagonist blocked the particulate-induced ROS generation in cells. Further, induction of CYP 1 A 1 protein expression was confirmed by immunoblots in cells treated with <b>airborne</b> <b>particles,</b> suggestingthe roles of AhR status in mediating the particulate-induced toxicity. In addition, we observed that at non-cytotoxic concentration(∼ 0. 01 m 3 air equivalent), <b>airborne</b> <b>particles</b> induced decreases in intracellularNAD(P) H andNAD+ in MCF- 7 cells. These decreaseswere completely blocked by three types of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase- 1 (PARP- 1) inhibitors. Moreover, we demonstrated increasesin the number of DNA strand breaks in MCF- 7 cells exposed to <b>airborne</b> <b>particles</b> {{as measured by the}} single-cell gel electrophoresis(Comet) assay. Overall, this evidence confirms that <b>airborne</b> <b>particles</b> induce decreases in intracellular NAD(P) H and NAD+ throughPARP- 1 activation mediated by formation of DNA strand breaks. Furthermore, we confirmed that with series dilution airborneparticles (∼ 10 − 7 – 10 − 2 m 3 air equivalent) possess both estrogenic and anti-estrogenic activities as determined by the ERα-mediatedreporter gene assay in human T 47 D-KBluc breast cancer cells. In conclusions, we confirmed that the DNA-damaging activity andestrogenicity of <b>airborne</b> <b>particles</b> varied considerably with concentration (air equivalent). Our findings add further support to thetheme that ROS formation is a significant determinant factor in mediating the induction of oxidative DNA damage and repair inhuman breast cancer cells exposed to <b>airborne</b> <b>particles</b> and that oxidative stress and the subsequent induction of DNA damage may,in part, contribute to airborne particle-induced carcinogenesis...|$|R

Materials and MethodsSixty amalgam (Tytin) disks were stored in water at 37 °C for 365 days. Half of the specimens were <b>airborne</b> <b>particle</b> abraded and the remaining half was roughened with a greenstone. Resin composite cylinders (Tetric) were bonded onto the amalgam surfaces using Amalgambond, All-Bond 2 or Scotchbond 1 (n= 10). Specimens were stored in water at 37 °C for 7 days and thermocycled. Shear bond strength testing was carried on an Instron Universal Testing Machine. Stereomicroscope examination was carried out to determine the bond failure sites. Results were analyzed by ANOVA followed by Student-Newman-Keuls’ post-hoc tests and the level of statistical significance was set at 5 %. ResultsSurface treatment significantly affected the shear bond strengths (p< 0. 001) with <b>airborne</b> <b>particle</b> abrasion producing the highest bond strengths.

40|$|The main {{objective}} {{of our research}} was to compare the <b>airborne</b> <b>particle</b> micromorphology and chemistry in the Brussels environment during agriculture working periods in the surrounding farming region. We used specific methods and instrumentation that are adapted to the climate peculiarities of the Brussels region, the period of investigations (12 months) and the proposed objectives. For the agricultural works we defined the following six periods: before sowing, sowing, after sowing, before harvest, harvest and after harvest. The results indicate a possible temporal correlation between agricultural work periods and <b>airborne</b> <b>particle</b> concentration, micromorphology and chemistry in the Brabant-Brussels region. For wheat and corn plant-growth periods, the average particle size, defined as the area obtained by a planar projection of the particulate, showed important variations in time. For sugar beet and endive, the average area size variations are less important. The roughness and sphericity parameters for the growth periods of the four different plants also showed significant differences. Many of the larger particulates (> 10 microm) are aggregates of even finer particles coated with many still finer ones. The <b>airborne</b> <b>particle</b> chemistry averages (atomic percentage At%), showed that three constituents (Si, S and Fe) dominate all the samples (except for particles 3 - 10 microm in size, which contain a relatively large percentage of Al).

Midcoronal occlusal dentin of extracted human molars was used. Teeth were randomly assigned to 4 groups according to the adhesive system used: OptiBond FL (FL), OptiBond Solo Plus (SO), Prime & Bond (PB), and Riva Bond LC (RB). Specimens from each group were further divided into two subgroups: control specimens were treated with adhesive procedures; abraded specimens were pretreated with <b>airborne</b> <b>particle</b> abrasion using 50 [*]μm Al 2 O 3 before adhesion. After bonding procedures, composite crowns were incrementally built up. Specimens were sectioned perpendicular to adhesive interface to produce multiple beams, which were tested under tension until failure. Data were statistically analysed. Failure mode analysis was performed. Overall comparison showed significant increase in bond strength (p< 0. 001) between abraded and no-abraded specimens, independently of brand.
