40|$|In {{practice}} discharges of untreated wastewater occur {{from many}} wastewater sewer systems, often via Sanitary Sewer Overflows (SSO). The untreated wastewater from SSO {{can be transferred}} through the overflow systems into receiving waters, reducing their quality and bringing risks to human health and aquatic organisms. Increased awareness of {{the negative effects of}} SSOs has {{led to the development of}} various control measures as part of watershed protection programs around the world. However, the information the number of SSO events is often unknown due to poor or limited monitoring. A further problem is that backflows can occur through an overflow system, with receiving waters entering the wastewater network due to elevated levels of the receiving waters. This additional relatively clean water often increases the volumes of water that need to be transported to the treatment facility and dilutes wastewater pollutants, resulting in lower treatment efficiency and higher costs for chemicals, increasing electricity consumption for any intermediate booster pumps and within the treatment plant. This paper illustrates how the <b>flap</b> <b>gates,</b> commonly used for preventing these backflows, also can be used for the estimation of SSO discharge volumes. An experimental full-scale setup was designed where sewage flowed through a <b>flap</b> <b>gate</b> between two chambers with a constant flow rate. The stabilised water heads in the two chambers and the flow rate were measured. Experiments were performed for both dry and submerged <b>flap</b> <b>gate</b> conditions (the latter is relevant for the SSO event occurring during high water level in the receiving waters). In total, five <b>flap</b> <b>gates</b> with opening dimensions of 200, 300, 400, 500 and 600 mm were tested and flow rating curves were established with high precision (R 2 > 0. 99). Results of the opening pressure tests showed some deviations between the values specified by the manufacturer of the <b>flap</b> <b>gates</b> and the experimentally obtained opening pressure values. An approach to generalising the flow rating curves for other than tested diameters of the <b>flap</b> <b>gates</b> is suggested. The usage of flow rating curves for estimation of the volume is discussed. This study showed that the water head measurements before and after the <b>flap</b> <b>gate</b> can provide a reliable and inexpensive method for quantification of the SSO discharge volumes.

40|$|A {{method is}} {{proposed}} {{for assessing the}} impact of rising sea levels on areas upstream of tidal <b>flap</b> <b>gates.</b> These devices, designed to allow drainage of surrounding land during low water and flood defence during high water, are commonly used in areas where tidal high water {{is higher than the}} level of the land behind the sea wall. Studies were undertaken at Pagham Harbour, West Sussex, UK, where a number of tidal <b>flap</b> <b>gates</b> are used to control the flow of water from channels carrying drainage waters away from the nearby town of Chichester. On one of these channels, water level data were collected at 15 minute intervals at three sites near the <b>flap</b> <b>gate</b> and analysed in order to obtain values over each tidal cycle of maximum and minimum water levels downstream of the gate, and the time of closure of the gate. Water level was also monitored at two locations upstream of the gate. By obtaining estimates of mean fresh water discharge for each tidal cycle, and combining these with peak tidal water level, a functional relationship (in the form of a three dimensional plot) was obtained for the parameter Tc, the length of time in hours for which the <b>flap</b> <b>gate</b> is closed during each tidal cycle. These values of tc were also used in conjunction with mean tidal fresh water discharge to produce another three-dimensional plot showing the effect on peak tidal water level upstream of the <b>flap</b> <b>gate,</b> thus providing an illustration of the sensitivity of local flooding of varying tc under differing tidal conditions. Finally an estimate was made of the likely impact of a 300 mm rise in mean sea water level on tc for the same set of fresh water flow data, using a set of 'look-up' tables based on the three-dimensional plots obtained. These indicated that the frequency of local flooding was likely to increase significantly for fresh water flows greater than 0. 8 m 3 /s. Although the increase in local flooding illustrated here is not thought to be a cause for immediate concern, particularly in view of the recent construction of a further tidal <b>flap</b> <b>gate</b> adjacent to the existing one, nevertheless the methodology employed is applicable to similar systems...|$|R

By means of Green’s theorem a system of hypersingular integral equations for the velocity potential in the ﬂuid domain is solved in terms of Legendre polynomials. We show that synchronous excitation of the natural frequencies of Sammarco et al. (2013) yields large amplitude response of gate motion.

40|$|The {{doctoral}} disertation {{considers the}} analysis of the hydrodynamic conditions near the bottom-hinged <b>flap</b> <b>gates</b> on a side weir, which are used to regulate the amount of the lateral discharge over the side weir. The disertation is divided into two parts: the experimental and the numerical part. Within the experimental part, discharge and water surface measurements for 380 variants were carried out. A new equation for the discharge coefficient of a bottom-hinged <b>flap</b> <b>gate</b> on a side weir was proposed, which covers the influence of the position and the width of the <b>flap</b> <b>gate</b> on the discharge coefficient. In addition, measurements of water levels near the <b>flap</b> <b>gate</b> and also measurements of the velocity fields were carried out with the computer-aided visualization method. From these measurements, it was possible to show that the contraction of the water jet varies with the gate opening angle. It was also found in which position a <b>flap</b> <b>gate</b> has the most favorable hydrodynamic shape. Within the numerical work, a 3 D numerical model of two-phase flow, which uses the so-called VOF method for determining the interface was established. For this purpuse, the software code OpenFOAM was used. Within the numerical modeling three different turbulence models were analysed, these are the k-ε and k-ω SST turbulence model and the LES turbulence model with a Smagorinsky subgrid scale model. With the help of a calibrated 3 D numerical model, the influence of different geometric and operational parameters of the flap on the pressure distribution at the gate, caused by the flow of water over the side weir, was analysed. Furthermore, the resultants of the forces and torsion moments in the hinge of the gate were determined {{on the basis of the}} results of the numerical model. An update of the OpenFOAM software code was also applied. In this context, a new solver named interWaterFoam was established, which allows more stable and robust calculations with limiting the velocities in the phase of air...|$|R

40|$|Floods {{forecasting}} {{and management}} of large regulated rivers require the ability to properly combine classical flow routing with the regulation dams that act as internal boundaries. Therefore a good knowledge of the stage-discharge relationships of these dams is mandatory. The Meuse River in Belgium is such a regulated river, for which the HYDROAXE software was developed jointly by the Belgian Min-istry of Public Works (SPW-SETHY) and the Hydraulics Laboratory of the Université catholique de Lou-vain (Belgium). Working for a constant improvement of this software, this paper presents an experimental study of flow over a typical dam of the River Meuse, i. e. a dam controlled by radial <b>gates</b> equipped with <b>flap</b> <b>gates.</b> Measurements of the upstream water level and of the discharge are presented for different positions of the <b>flap</b> <b>gate.</b> According to earlier works on gates featuring a variable inclination, mainly drum gates, {{it is observed that}} the stage-discharge relationship depends on the inclination of the flap. However, the theoretical discharge coefficient obtained by means of formulae of the literature always exceeds the measured discharge coefficient. This suggests that further work is required to obtain a stage-discharge relationship adapted to the particular case of radial <b>gates</b> equipped with <b>flap</b> <b>gates...</b>|$|R

40|$|Water {{diversion}} {{mechanisms are}} commonly used in the irrigation systems and this concept is older than tank (reservoir) systems in Sri Lanka. At present, for water diversions in the wet zone anicuts are constructed by using lifting type gates. Anicuts are used to maintain required water level in the upstream by releasing only the excess water to downstream. In the lifting gate, water is allowed to flow from the bottom and this causes high erosion in the canal. The thrust force due to water pressure on the lifting gate {{makes it difficult to}} operate the system and then controlling the system is a complex task. This paper describes the construction and operation of newly introduced <b>flap</b> <b>gates</b> and issues related to lifting gate which are presently used for diversion process. In this analysis, conceptual design of a <b>flap</b> <b>gate</b> with compressive arc type wall plate is proposed to minimize use of construction materials. In the proposed system, height of the anicut could be changed from the top and then the water level in the upstream is not varied much when compared with lifting gates for varying flows in the cannel.
