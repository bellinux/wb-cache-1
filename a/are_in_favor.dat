5|$|Conversely, DST can {{adversely}} affect farmers, parents of young children, and others whose hours are {{set by the}} sun and they have traditionally opposed the practice, although some farmers are neutral. One reason why farmers oppose DST is that grain is best harvested after dew evaporates, so when field hands arrive and leave earlier in summer their labor is less valuable. Dairy farmers are another group who complain of the change. Their cows {{are sensitive to the}} timing of milking, so delivering milk earlier disrupts their systems. Today some farmers' groups <b>are</b> <b>in</b> <b>favor</b> of DST.|$|E

25|$|There {{is ongoing}} {{debate about whether}} central banks should target zero {{inflation}} (which would mean a constant value for the U.S. dollar over time) or low, stable inflation (which would mean a continuously but slowly declining {{value of the dollar}} over time, as is the case now). Although some economists <b>are</b> <b>in</b> <b>favor</b> of a zero inflation policy and therefore a constant value for the U.S. dollar, others contend that such a policy limits the ability of the central bank to control interest rates and stimulate the economy when needed.|$|E
25|$|There are two {{opposing}} {{sides of the}} sex education argument amongst parents: the sexual liberals and the sexual conservatives. Sexual liberals see knowledge on sex as equipping individuals {{to make informed decisions}} about their personal sexuality, and they <b>are</b> <b>in</b> <b>favor</b> of comprehensive sexual education all throughout schooling, not just in high school. Sexual conservatives see knowledge on sex as encouraging adolescents to have sex, and they believe that sex should be taught inside the family in order for their morals {{to be included in the}} conversation. Sexual conservatives see the importance of teaching sex education, but only through abstinence-only programs.|$|E
25|$|Sciascia {{wrote of}} his unique Sicilian experience, linking {{families}} with political parties, the treachery of alliances and allegiances, and the calling of favors {{that result in}} outcomes that do not benefit society, but those individuals who <b>are</b> <b>in</b> <b>favor.</b> His books are rarely characterized by a happy ending or by justice for the ordinary man. A prime {{example of this is}} Equal Danger (1973; Uguale pericolo), in which the police's best detective is drafted to Sicily to investigate a spate of murders of judges. Focusing on the inability of authorities to handle such investigation into the corruption, Sciascia's hero is finally thwarted.|$|E

25|$|UE’s {{approach}} to grievances includes careful {{investigation of the}} issue by the steward, being well-prepared for meetings with the employer, and strategies for organizing and mobilizing members to pressure management to resolve the problem. UE warns its locals against excessive reliance on grievance arbitration, {{pointing out that the}} majority of arbitration decisions <b>are</b> <b>in</b> <b>favor</b> of management, and that an arbitrator’s unfavorable interpretation of a contract clause can harm the union for many years. UE avoids arbitrating grievances that it believes it is unlikely to win and trains its staff and local officers to carefully prepare for those cases they do take to arbitration. In most UE locals, the decision whether to arbitrate a grievance is made by membership vote.|$|E
25|$|Retail water tariffs. The same retail tariff {{structure}} {{applies to the}} entire country. Water and sewer tariffs in Morocco follow an increasing-block {{tariff structure}}, under which the tariff per cubic meter rises as consumption increases. The residential tariff has four blocks, the lowest applying to consumption of less than 6 m³ per month and the highest to consumption above 40 m³ per month. However, the level of retail tariffs varies from one locality to another. Standpipe services, which are common for the urban poor, are typically free. Utilities send bills to local governments. In a few cases, standpipe management has been entrusted to a gardien/gérant, who operates the faucet and charges users. According to a World Bank report, free standpipe services are pro-poor. But they are also increasingly unsustainable for operators, {{both in terms of}} wasted water (up to 40 percent) and in terms of lack of revenues. Operators <b>are</b> <b>in</b> <b>favor</b> of promoting individual connections in order to strengthen their revenue base.|$|E
25|$|Brenda, still {{distressed by}} the fact that Dylan chose Kelly, began the fourth season in Minnesota, where she had decided to enter university. However, hearing about the break between Dylan and Kelly and realizing that she and her old friends from Minnesota have little in common, she decides to return to Beverly Hills and {{continue}} her studies at University of California. After her return, she met a rich young man named Stuart (whom Dylan knew of as a drug dealer in the past), and soon fell in love with him. The couple get engaged even in the first few weeks of their encounter and choose Las Vegas, forcing Dylan and his friends to come and try to stop them. They succeed by using reverse psychology, pretending that they <b>are</b> <b>in</b> <b>favor</b> of a marriage between the two young people. Brenda's life also took a few shots during the season. When Donna and Brenda find a puppy on the street, they learn that he escaped from an animal testing laboratory and are helpless when the puppy dies. Brenda then falls into a group of animal rights activists and participates with them in the ransacking of a number of laboratories until she is arrested (Donna decides at the last minute not to join the group). After her arrest, {{the only person in the}} group who supported her was Dylan; David Silver questioned her judgment, Andrea was angry that she had damaged laboratories that did not test animals and Kelly told her that Dylan was no longer her boyfriend and that Brenda could not go and look for help whenever she had a problem. It turned out that one of the activists was an FBI agent who offered Brenda a deal not to jail because she had not supported vandalism.|$|E
