This tour was suggested {{to him by his}} Scottish pupil Jane Stirling and her elder sister. Stirling also made all the logistical <b>arrangements</b> <b>and</b> provided much of the necessary funding.|$|E
5|$|Prior {{to social}} {{networking}} sites, technologies like {{short message service}} (SMS) and the telephone also {{had a significant impact}} on social interactions. In 2000, market research group Ipsos MORI reported that 81% of 15- to 24-year-old SMS users in the United Kingdom had used the service to coordinate social <b>arrangements</b> <b>and</b> 42% to flirt.|$|E

5|$|Although the xx {{had been}} {{strongly}} influenced by R acts, the album also drew comparisons from critics to alternative rock, electronica, and post-punk sounds. The melancholic songs on xx featured minimalist <b>arrangements</b> <b>and</b> were built around Smith's beats, Oliver Sim's basslines, and sparse guitar figures played by Baria Qureshi and Romy Madley Croft, who employed reverb in her lead guitar parts. Most of them were sung as low-key duets by Croft and Sim, both of whom wrote emotional lyrics about love, intimacy, loss, and desire.|$|E
5|$|Brown Sugar is {{the debut}} album of American R singer and multi-instrumentalist D'Angelo. It was {{released}} on July 4, 1995, by EMI Music. Recording sessions for the album took place from 1994 to 1995 at Battery Studios and RPM Studios in New York City and at the Pookie Lab in Sacramento. Production, instrumentation, <b>arrangements,</b> <b>and</b> songwriting were primarily handled by D'Angelo, who employed both vintage recording equipment and modern electronic devices. Brown Sugar contains themes of love and romance, and features a fusion of contemporary R and traditional soul music, along with elements of funk, quiet storm, and hip hop music.|$|E

5|$|Experimental pop is {{pop music}} that cannot be {{categorized}} within traditional musical boundaries or which attempts to push elements of existing popular forms into new areas. It may incorporate experimental {{techniques such as}} musique concrète, aleatoric music, or eclecticism into pop contexts. Often, the compositional process {{involves the use of}} electronic production effects to manipulate sounds and <b>arrangements,</b> <b>and</b> its settings may combine sound-based work and note-based work, though not always simultaneously.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the success}} of Hell Awaits, Slayer was offered a {{recording}} contract with Russell Simmons and Rick Rubin's newly founded Def Jam Records, a largely hip hop-based label. The band accepted and with an experienced producer and major label recording budget, the band underwent a sonic makeover for their third album Reign in Blood resulting in shorter, faster songs with clearer production. Gone were the complex <b>arrangements</b> <b>and</b> long songs featured on Hell Awaits, ditched in favor of stripped down, hardcore punk influenced song structures.|$|E
5|$|In 1979, Laucke {{signed with}} the Waterloo Music Publishing Company, which that year {{published}} the sheet music of his transcription of Trois Gymnopédies, {{the first of many}} of his transcriptions to be published by Waterloo and arguably the only version for guitar to include all of the notes of the original piano composition. In 1985, the company created The Michael Laucke Series of guitar <b>arrangements</b> <b>and</b> transcriptions.|$|E

5|$|In 2012, {{four new}} {{performances}} were scheduled, taking stage in Tokyo, Stockholm, and a reprise in Cologne. These performances featured slightly modified {{versions of the}} original <b>arrangements,</b> <b>and</b> like the original concerts, were sold out. Another performance was held in London in October 2016 by the London Symphony Orchestra. The original concert and the Tokyo concert both sparked the release of an album. These albums, along with the concerts themselves, were heavily praised, both {{for the quality of}} the performance and for the quality of Valtonen's arrangements, which overlaid themes from multiple pieces rather than relying on a traditional medley.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to the individual ReMixes, OC ReMix also hosts albums of <b>arrangements</b> <b>and</b> original music. These albums are typically created as collaborations among groups of ReMixers; OC ReMix has released over 70 albums. The majority of these are albums of arrangements, though it also hosts and distributes original soundtrack albums for indie games. These albums are released for free, and are generally created {{by members of the}} ReMix community. Titles include the iOS game Trenches, the Xbox Live Arcade game Return All Robots!, and Missile Master, Episode 1: Invasion.|$|E
5|$|Indonesian {{independence}} was secured through {{a blend of}} both diplomacy and force. Despite their ill-discipline raising the prospect of anarchy, without youth confronting foreign and Indonesian colonial forces, Republican diplomatic efforts would have been futile. The revolution is the turning point of modern Indonesian history, and it has provided the reference point and validation for the country’s major political trends that continue to the present day. It gave impetus to communism in the country, to militant nationalism, to Sukarno's 'guided democracy', to political Islam, {{the origins of the}} Indonesian army and its role in Indonesian power, the country's constitutional <b>arrangements,</b> <b>and</b> the centralism of power in Indonesia.|$|E

5|$|MacArthur {{was annoyed}} {{at the way}} that Royle, a Royal Navy officer, communicated {{directly}} with the Admiralty; he was also aware that Royle had been critical of SWPA's command <b>arrangements,</b> <b>and</b> {{of some of his}} decisions. MacArthur proposed that an Australian officer, Captain John Collins, replace Royle as CNS, an appointment that Carpender also supported. Over the Admiralty's objections, Curtin appointed Collins to replace Crutchley as Commander, Task Force 44, in June 1944, at the rank of commodore, with the intention that Collins would replace Royle when his term expired. This did not occur, because Collins was seriously wounded in Leyte Gulf on 21 October 1944.|$|E
5|$|Prior to any {{transfer}} of cargo, the chief officer must develop a transfer plan detailing {{specifics of the}} operation such as how much cargo will be moved, which tanks will be cleaned, and how the ship's ballasting will change. The next step before a transfer is the pretransfer conference. The pretransfer conference covers issues such as what products will be moved, the order of movement, names and titles of key people, particulars of shipboard and shore equipment, critical states of the transfer, regulations in effect, emergency and spill-containment procedures, watch and shift <b>arrangements,</b> <b>and</b> shutdown procedures.|$|E
5|$|Progressive {{big band}} is {{a style of}} big band or swing music that was made for listening, with denser, more modernistic <b>arrangements</b> <b>and</b> more room to improvise. The online music guide AllMusic states that, along with Kenton, musicians like Gil Evans, Toshiko Akiyoshi, Cal Massey, Frank Foster, Carla Bley, George Gruntz, David Amram, Sun Ra, and Duke Ellington were major proponents of the style.|$|E

5|$|The Act was {{subsequently}} amended to promote private development {{of nuclear energy}} under the Eisenhower administration's Atoms for Peace program in 1954. In restricting the access to nuclear information to other countries, it created a rift between the United States and its allies, particularly Britain and Canada, which {{had participated in the}} Manhattan Project. This resulted in cumbersome command and control <b>arrangements,</b> <b>and</b> in Britain developing its own nuclear weapons. The Act was amended in 1958 to allow the United States to share information with its close allies.|$|E
5|$|The Australian Flying Corps (AFC) was {{established}} {{as part of}} the Commonwealth Military Forces in 1912, prior to the formation of the Australian Military Forces in 1916 and was later separated in 1921 to form the Royal Australian Air Force, making it the second oldest air force in the world. Regardless, the service branches were not linked by a single chain of command however, and each reported to their own minister and had separate administrative <b>arrangements</b> <b>and</b> government departments.|$|E
5|$|The British Nationality Act 1981 {{reclassified}} Hong Kong into a British Dependent Territory {{amid the}} reorganisation of global territories of the British Empire. All residents of Hong Kong became British Dependent Territory Citizens (BDTC). Diplomatic negotiations began with China and eventually concluded with the 1984 Sino-British Joint Declaration. Both countries agreed to transfer Hong Kong's sovereignty to China on 1 July 1997, when Hong Kong would remain autonomous {{as a special}} administrative region {{and be able to}} retain its free-market economy, British common law through the Hong Kong Basic Law, independent representation in international organisations (e.g. WTO and WHO), treaty <b>arrangements</b> <b>and</b> policy-making except foreign diplomacy and military defence.|$|E
