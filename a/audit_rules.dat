5000|$|In 1999, {{recognizing}} the confusion created by industry abuse of IOPS numbers following {{the release of}} IOmeter, the Storage Performance Council developed an industry-standard, peer-reviewed and audited benchmark that has been widely recognized as the only meaningful measurement of storage device IO performance; the SPC-1 benchmark suite [...] The SPC-1 requires storage vendors to fully characterize their products against a standardized workload closely modeled on 'real-world' applications, reporting both IOPS and response-times and with explicit prohibitions and safeguards against 'cheating' and 'benchmark specials'. As such, an SPC-1 benchmark result provides users with complete information about IOPS, response-times, sustainability of performance over time and data integrity checks. Moreover, SPC-1 <b>audit</b> <b>rules</b> require vendors to submit a complete bill-of-materials including pricing of all components used in the benchmark, to facilitate SPC-1 [...] "Cost-per-IOPS" [...] comparisons among vendor submissions.|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} we discuss the {{relevance}} of the major results found on the literature about optimal auditing rules to the case of a commodity tax. We found out that literature’s usual recommendations are not applied by tax administrations. In our understanding, this happens because of: i) there is a key difference between the assumed objective (theoretical) of the tax administration and the actual objectives, ii) every model assumes that taxpayers know <b>audit</b> <b>rules,</b> when in fact they are kept confidential by the tax administration. iii) most models restrict tax evasion to underreporting, iv) there might be practical or non-economical issues that prevent tax administrations using optimal auditing rules. We conclude that optimal <b>audit</b> <b>rules</b> bring in a very important issue usually neglected when tax administrations design an auditing policy: the impact of the audit policy on the returns of non-audited taxpayers.

In what regards third-parties, these will be assured that the audit is made by unitary criteria, no matter by whom it is made. Even if solicited by various firms, in order to raise the credibility of the financial situations they published, the audit process cannot take place at random, without the existence of legal regulations.

40|$|This paper {{experimentally}} examines a new <b>auditing</b> <b>rule</b> {{termed the}} bounded rule, which {{takes into account}} the budget constraint of the auditor (e. g., a tax authority). Compared to a traditional <b>rule</b> that <b>audits</b> income reports with a constant probability, the bounded rule can induce the same deterrence e¤ect with a smaller budget. The basic setting follows a classic tax-compliance game in which each taxpayer receives either high or low income with certain probability. On knowing an <b>auditing</b> <b>rule,</b> the taxpayers have to decide simultaneously and independently whether to report their income truthfully to the auditor. The traditional <b>rule</b> <b>audits</b> every low-income report with a constant probability. The bounded <b>rule</b> <b>audits</b> a randomly selected sample of low-income reports whenever the number of these reports exceeds the maximum number of audits allowed by the budget, or otherwise all of the low-income reports. The experimental evidence suggests that, as predicted, the two <b>auditing</b> <b>rules</b> have the same deterrence e¤ect. The bounded rule needs a smaller budget ex-ante, and conducts fewer audits ex-post. The results provide support for the bounded rule as a more cost-e¤ective alternative to the traditional rule. ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Due to the {{sensitive}} data contained in Data Warehouses (DWs), {{it is essential}} to specify security measures from {{the early stages of the}} DWs design and enforce them. In this paper, we will present a UML profile to represent multidimensional and security aspects of our conceptual modeling. Our approach proposes the use of UML packages in order to group classes together into higher level units creating different levels of abstraction, and therefore, simplifying the final model. Furthermore, we present an extension of the relational model to consider security and audit measures represented in the conceptual modeling. To accomplish this, we based on the Relational Package of the Common Warehouse Metamodel (CWM) and extend it to properly represent all security and <b>audit</b> <b>rules</b> defined in the conceptual modeling of DWs.

40|$|Traditional {{models of}} tax {{enforcement}} {{assume that the}} decision to be tax compliant {{is the result of a}}n interaction between individual taxpayers and a dedicated tax agency. Evidence shows that tax compliance is the result of a far more complex decision rule, involving both individual and group motivations, along with non-monetary components. In this paper, we consider a game in which the individual decision to be tax compliant is affected both by strategic competition between taxpayers and the psychological cost of being detected (i. e., shame). We ran a laboratory experiment using a sample of 138 students at the Centro di Economia Sperimentale A Roma Est (CESARE) to evaluate the efficiency of random versus targeted <b>audit</b> <b>rules</b> and to verify the interaction between strategic competition and shame. The experimental results show that strategic competition between taxpayers plays a critical role in reducing tax evasion.

By the end of the systems <b>audit,</b> <b>rules</b> for approximately 63 % of the controls tests were successfully automated.

40|$|Strategic {{models of}} auditor-inspectee {{interaction}} have neglected implementation details in multiple-inspectee settings. With multiple inspectees, the target audit probability {{derived from the}} standard analysis can be implemented with sampling plans differing in the budgets committed to support them. Overly committed audit budgets tie up unneeded resources {{that could have been}} allocated for better uses. This paper studies the minimum committed budget required to implement a target audit probability when (i) the audit sample can be contingent on "red flags" due to signals of inspectees' private information (e. g., from self-reporting) and (ii) the number of inspectees is large. It proposes an <b>audit</b> <b>rule</b> called bounded simple random sampling (SRS), which is shown to require no more committed budget to support than two other rules naturally generalized from the one-to-one analysis. When the number of inspectees is large enough, bounded SRS is nearly as good as any efficient <b>audit</b> <b>rule,</b> which demands the lowest committed budget necessary to implement the target audit probability. The results offer insights on how audit sampling plans may be formulated to reduce inefficiency and what budget usage ratios should be expected accordingly. audit sampling plan, audit budget, tax audit, tax compliance, tax evasion, inspection game, appropriation and rescission...|$|R
