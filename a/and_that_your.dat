500|$|The subplot of Homer {{entering}} the childproofing business {{was inspired by}} an instance when a salesman visited Payne and his pregnant wife to see if their home was safe for children. In an interview with Star-News, Payne commented: [...] "You hire this person to come into your home to look for changes you can make. They {{make you feel like}} the most horrible person in the world <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>your</b> house is the temple of doom." [...] "Bye Bye Nerdie" [...] features a scene based specifically on this instance in which a saleswoman (voiced by cast member Tress MacNeille) selling childproofing items visits Homer and Marge and exaggerates the dangers in their home. NRBQ's song [...] "Always Safety First" [...] is played during a montage in the episode in which Homer is seen improving the safety of the infants of Springfield.|$|E
500|$|The Franciscan Padre Luis Sotelo came to {{our country}} to spread the faith of God. On that occasion, I learnt about this faith and desired to become a Christian, but I still haven't {{accomplished}} this desire due to some small issues. However, {{in order to encourage}} my subjects to become Christians, I wish that you send missionaries of the Franciscan church. I guarantee that {{you will be able to}} build a church <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>your</b> missionaries will be protected. I also wish that you select and send a bishop as well. Because of that, I have sent one of my samurai, Hasekura Rokuemon, as my representative to accompany Luis Sotelo across the seas to Rome, to give you a stamp of obedience and to kiss your feet. Further, as our country and Nueva España are neighbouring countries, could you intervene so that we can discuss with the King of Spain, for the benefit of dispatching missionaries across the seas."

2500|$|The {{result for}} the {{necessary}} zprop given by (Ret-03) depends critically on the assumptions that you make. As an example, you might assume that price inflation will be 3.5% per year forever <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>your</b> pay will increase only {{at that same}} rate of 3.5%. If you assume a 4.5% per year nominal rate of interest, then (using 1.045/1.035 in real terms [...] ) your pre-retirement and post-retirement net interest rates will remain the same, irel to pay = 0.966 percent per year and ireal = 0.966 percent per year.

Nelson {{notes that in}} Morey's The New Atheism (1986) he quoted Nicholas Capaldi's book The Art of Deception {{as an example of}} atheist deception, but the [...] "problem is that Capaldi never says this (or anything like it) on this or on any other page. Morey has numerous other false quotes attributed to Capaldi, such as: 'Refuse to be convinced. Even if you feel that he has a good argument <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>your</b> case is weaker, refuse to be convinced of your opponent's case'. Nowhere does Capaldi advocate, as Morey accuses him of doing, that atheists should 'use any invalid or deceptive argument as long as it helps him (to) win his case.'"

2500|$|Pretty Little Liars {{opened with}} mixed reviews. Metacritic gave the pilot episode 52 out of 100, based upon 14 {{critical}} reviews. The New York Daily News gave the show a positive review, commenting that it [...] "makes most popular vampire romances look anemic", while concluding, [...] "Pretty Little Liars {{could go in}} several directions, including mundane teen clichés. It's got an equally good shot at making us care about these imperfect pretty girls." [...] A writer on Terror Hook has stated that [...] " [...] 'Pretty Little Liars' gets off to a very promising start. Great production all around, the writing keeps the viewer on their toes, and the acting just reinforces it. The overall mystery of the show in the end is dark and unpredictable, even stepping into the slasher film realm." [...] The New York Post gave the show three out of five stars, stating, [...] "OK, so we've established {{that there is no}} socially redeeming value in this series <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>your</b> kids shouldn't watch it if they are too young and impressionable. But if you can distract them enough to miss the first 15 minutes, the show isn't half-bad. Actually, it is half-good, if that makes sense." [...] The Los Angeles Times wrote that the series is [...] "one of those shows that manages to mildly, and perhaps unintentionally, spoof its genre while fully participating in it, and that's not a bad thing at all." ...|$|E
