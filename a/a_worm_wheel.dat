50|$|There was proper {{shielding}} of {{the operator}} from chuck contact, coolant and flying swarf. Both leadscrews ran in sealed oil baths. The apron {{was of a}} totally novel design. The leadscrew engaged with <b>a</b> <b>worm</b> <b>wheel</b> {{instead of the usual}} halfnuts. The apron gear system could engage every metric and imperial thread directly and automatically. The leadscrew could be disengaged for each cut without losing register. This made it easy to turn and thread directly against an endstop, even into blind holes. Accordingly, the lathe was equipped with an assortment of endstops both for the saddle and crossfeed. The endstop trip mechanism had a sensitive adjustment. There was a foot-operated emergency stop and spindle brake.|$|E

The special feature of these algorithms {{is that they}} reproduce a technological process of manufacturing components. The examples of constructing spur and helical gear sets, bevel gears, Archimedes and globoid gear pairs are given. The accuracy of construction is estimated. The construction inaccuracy doesn’t exceed a part of μm, which enables one to use the models as computer samples for production accuracy control and the algorithms {{as a basis for}} programs of components production {{with the help of the}} programmed control machine tools. The programs for implementation of the suggested algorithms are developed. The programs enable one to vary numerous model parameters and take into consideration teeth forms.

40|$|Worm gears {{are special}} gears {{consisting}} of <b>a</b> <b>worm</b> <b>wheel</b> and a worm. Worm gears {{can be produced}} in different ways, {{depending on the size}} of the transmission, the number of courses, the pitch angle of worm profile, the number of units produced, the purpose of application, etc. As cylindrical worm gears we consider the cylindrical worms with globoid gears, globoid worm with globoid worm gear and globoid worm with cylindrical worm gearing. This paper deals with the evolvent worm whose curve of the tooth side in the front plane is evolvent. The production of worm with an optimal profile for optimal meshing conditions is an increasingly frequent focus of worm gear manufacturers. The problem of designing the tool cutting edge can be divided into several steps. This article deals with the problems of optimum design of a tool shape for the production of worms; and the problems of calculating the coordinates of the transition cutting edge shape, and thus the path of grinding wheel for sharpening the tool cutting edge shape are solved. By grinding tool of grinding machine we can complete the worm shape and also sharpen the cutting edges of tools for production of worm surface. The problems of calculation of the coordinates are solved with regard to the functioning of the KON 250 CNC grinding machine logic...|$|E

50|$|A {{positioning}} goniometer or goniometric {{stage is}} a device used to rotate an object precisely (within a small angular range) about a fixed axis in space. Its appearance {{is similar to}} that of a linear stage. However, rather than moving linearly with respect to its base, the stage platform rotates partially about a fixed axis above the mounting surface of the platform. The distance of the center of rotation from the platform mounting surface is often chosen so that two different goniometer models may be stacked in an X-Y configuration and both stages will rotate about the same point. Positioning goniometers typically use <b>a</b> <b>worm</b> drive with <b>a</b> partial <b>worm</b> <b>wheel</b> fixed to the underside of the stage platform meshing with <b>a</b> <b>worm</b> in the base.

40|$|Nowadays {{worm gear}} drives usually show run-in capable {{material}} pairing. In {{most cases the}} worm is made of case hardened steel and the <b>worm</b> <b>wheel</b> of copper-tin alloy. This choice of material leads to an effective avoidance of the appearance of scuffing. The wear of the <b>worm</b> <b>wheel,</b> which is desirable in the running-in phase, limits, along with the known load carrying capacities of other gear types, the life expectancy of the gear set. The {{aim of this study}} is to optimize the copper-tin alloys of the <b>worm</b> <b>wheel</b> with respect to the wear properties. Extensive tests on worm gear drives with different copper-tin alloys allow statements concerning the effects of varying the different material parameters to the wear behaviour. The result is <b>a</b> wear optimized <b>worm</b> <b>wheel</b> material and <b>an</b> extended load carrying capacity calculation. Furthered load carrying capacity calculation makes a contribution which forms the existing calculation procedure more accurately. The derivation of a statistical evaluation procedure for the test results leads to a wear life expectancy with a specification of an appearance probability. The physical based wear parameter allows the prediction of the wear behaviour of copper-tin alloys using the material properties. Detailed measurements of the power losses in the worm gear drives make possible the calculation of the tooth coefficient of friction of the various material pairing. The introduced order- and purchase regulations guarantee, that in the future, the optimized bronze can be reproduced and supplied. (orig.)

40|$|Plastic <b>worm</b> <b>wheel</b> {{is widely}} used in the vehicle {{manufacturing}} field because it is favorable for weight lightening, vibration and noise reduction, as well as corrosion resistance.
