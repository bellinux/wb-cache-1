5|$|The VFD {{controller}} is a solid-state {{power electronics}} conversion system consisting of three distinct sub-systems: a rectifier bridge converter, a direct current (DC) link, and an inverter. Voltage-source inverter (VSI) drives (see 'Generic topologies' sub-section below) {{are by far}} {{the most common type of}} drives. Most drives are AC-AC drives in that they convert AC line input to <b>AC</b> <b>inverter</b> output. However, in some applications such as common DC bus or solar applications, drives are configured as DC-AC drives. The most basic rectifier converter for the VSI drive is configured as a three-phase, six-pulse, full-wave diode bridge. In a VSI drive, the DC link consists of a capacitor which smooths out the converter's DC output ripple and provides a stiff input to the inverter. This filtered DC voltage is converted to quasi-sinusoidal AC voltage output using the inverter's active switching elements. VSI drives provide higher power factor and lower harmonic distortion than phase-controlled current-source inverter (CSI) and load-commutated inverter (LCI) drives (see 'Generic topologies' sub-section below). The drive controller can also be configured as a phase converter having single-phase converter input and three-phase inverter output.|$|E
25|$|Electronic {{ballasts}} {{contain a}} small circuit board with a bridge rectifier, a filter capacitor and usually two switching transistors, {{which are often}} insulated-gate bipolar transistors. The incoming AC current is first rectified to DC, then converted to high frequency AC by the transistors, connected as a resonant series DC to <b>AC</b> <b>inverter.</b> The resulting high frequency {{is applied to the}} lamp tube. Since the resonant converter tends to stabilize lamp current (and light produced) over a range of input voltages, standard CFLs do not respond well in dimming applications and will experience a shorter lifespan and sometimes catastrophic failure.

50|$|Because {{many of the}} DP70s {{remaining}} in use today are in repertory venues that screen {{a wide range of}} formats, including prints of silent movies that require a lower frame rate than 24, {{a lot of them have}} now received aftermarket modifications that will typically enable any speed between 16 and 30.

50|$|Early EVcorts had a {{gasoline}} heater, while later models had an electric ceramic heater, {{as well as}} an air conditioner powered by an <b>AC</b> <b>inverter.</b> Power for accessories was provided by a 40‑amp DC-to-DC converter that took its 800‑Hz switching signal from the controller.

Post-1990 models had a feature whereby the heater or air conditioner could be set to prewarm or precool the cabin to a specified temperature using power from the AC line once charging was complete, thus minimizing use of the batteries for climate control.|$|E

50|$|Since {{the early}} 1990s, {{electronic}} flicker-free (or Square-Wave) ballasts {{have become increasingly}} popular and affordable {{as an alternative to}} magnetic ballasts by eliminating most of the problems associated with HMI flicker. Unfortunately, their operation is not as simple as a magnetic ballast. Electronic ballasts {{can be thought of as}} operating in three stages—a DC intermediate converter, a power module, and an <b>AC</b> <b>inverter.</b> Power initially flows through the main breakers into an RF mains filter that prevents the flow of noise back onto the incoming power line. Then, rectifiers and capacitors charge and discharge to invert the negative half of the AC cycle and convert the line to positive DC voltage. This is called the DC intermediate. In the second stage, a buck converter draws from the DC intermediate and regulates current to the final power electronics via an electronic control board. This control board carefully adjusts the high frequency duty cycle of its transistors to maintain optimum color and light output as the lamp ages. Finally, the regulated current is inverted by an LF-converter board that uses four Insulated Gate Bipolar Transistors (IGBTs) to switch the DC at precisely 60 Hz into a square wave AC (unlike the sinusoidal pattern of line AC). Leaders in this field include Power Gems Corp, B&S, & Mytronic.|$|E
