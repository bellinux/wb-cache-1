5|$|Seals from Tell Brak and Nabada {{dated to}} the pre-Akkadian kingdom, {{revealed}} {{the use of}} four-wheeled wagons and war carriages. Excavation in area FS recovered clay models of equids and wagons dated to the Akkadian and post-Akkadian periods. The models provide information about the types of wagons used during that period (2350–2000 BC), and they include four wheeled vehicles and two types of two wheeled vehicles; the first is <b>a</b> <b>cart</b> with fixed seats {{and the second is}} <b>a</b> <b>cart</b> where the driver stands above the axle. The chariots were introduced during the Mitanni era, and none of the pre-Mitanni carriages can be considered chariots, as they are mistakenly described in some sources.|$|E
5|$|As Luke {{leaves the}} garden, {{he realizes he}} still has much {{to learn about the}} world, and asks to become Layton's apprentice. Layton obliges, and the game ends with Luke bidding {{farewell}} to the people of Misthallery before beginning his journeys with Layton. In a final scene, Jean Descole is seen on <b>a</b> <b>cart,</b> preparing his next plan.|$|E
5|$|As can be {{seen from}} the above, in this early reference, no mention is made of live animals as co-inhabitants within the sack, nor is the mention of any initial {{whipping}} contained, nor that Malleolus, contained within the sack, was transported to the river in <b>a</b> <b>cart</b> driven by black oxen.|$|E

5|$|Before his death, Henry {{instructed}} the coachman to gather his remaining body parts in a cloth tied with blue string, {{place it in}} <b>a</b> <b>cart</b> drawn by a stallion. When the stallion broke, he was {{to replace it with}} an ox, and when the ox stopped, he was to build a church. This is where Henrik’s remains were to be buried.|$|E
5|$|Leavelle's {{design is}} based on Texan detective Jim Leavelle, as he {{appeared}} when escorting Lee Harvey Oswald when Oswald was shot by Jack Ruby. Leavelle trains the bodyguards by pretending to shoot their protectee from a grassy knoll on <b>a</b> <b>cart.</b> This is {{a reference to the}} grassy knoll at the site of President John F. Kennedy’s assassination, Dealey Plaza and a scene from the Kennedy assassination film Executive Action (1973).|$|E
5|$|Overmars {{was born}} in Emst, Gelderland, growing up on a family farm with his parents and {{assisting}} his grandfather with the potato harvest each year. There were no machines or tractors, so {{when the time came}} to extract the potatoes, his family tied a rope around Overmars' waist, connected it to <b>a</b> <b>cart</b> and made him run while they pulled the crop out.|$|E

5|$|Paulet was {{something}} of an eccentric. On one occasion, while his ship was moored at Spithead, he asked his admiral for permission to take leave to visit London. This was refused, with the comment that Paulet could travel as far on land as he could get in his barge. Thus challenged, Paulet loaded his barge onto <b>a</b> <b>cart</b> {{and went off to}} London anyway.|$|E
5|$|Rolling {{resistance}} {{is also the}} reason at least one historical human civilization abandoned the use of wheels. During {{the time of the}} Roman Empire, wheeled chariots were common in the Middle East and North Africa; yet when the Empire collapsed and its roads fell into disrepair, wheels fell out of favor with the local populations, who turned to camels to transport goods in the sandy desert climate. In his book Hen's Teeth and Horse's Toes, Stephen Jay Gould explains this curiosity of history, asserting that, in the absence of maintained roads, camels required less manpower and water than <b>a</b> <b>cart</b> pulled by oxen.|$|E
5|$|Some {{elements}} of the station, including the size of internal support structures, the amount of glass panels, and {{the width of the}} roof, were eliminated or reduced to save $20 million in construction costs. Moving walkways and electric carts were both considered and rejected for the station because of engineering difficulties and cost. In 2017, the Port of Seattle began a $3.5 million capital program to improve the walk from the station to the terminal by installing windscreens and adding <b>a</b> <b>cart</b> shuttle service.|$|E

5|$|The {{bodies of}} Warwick and Montagu {{were laid out}} 'on the morrow after' and 'openly shewed and naked' in St. Paul's, to prevent rumour {{starting}} that they had in fact survived the battle; Warkworth too said that the King personally directed this, and arranged for the corpses 'to be put in <b>a</b> <b>cart...</b> to be laid in the church of Paul's, on the pavement, that every man might see them; and so they lay {{for three or four}} days' before granting permission to their brother George for their burial at Bisham Priory.|$|E
5|$|The film's {{official}} debut was in Toronto on 7 September 2006, at the Ryerson University Theatre {{during the}} Toronto International Film Festival. Baron Cohen arrived in character as Borat in <b>a</b> <b>cart</b> pulled by women dressed as peasants. Twenty {{minutes into the}} showing, however, the projector broke. Baron Cohen performed an impromptu act to keep the audience amused, but ultimately all attempts to fix the equipment failed. The film was successfully screened the following night, with Dustin Hoffman in attendance.|$|E
5|$|The {{inhabitants}} {{were growing}} desperate {{to remove their}} belongings from the City, especially the upper class. This provided a {{source of income for}} the able-bodied poor, who hired out as porters (sometimes simply making off with the goods), and it was especially profitable for the owners of carts and boats. Hiring <b>a</b> <b>cart</b> had cost a couple of shillings on the Saturday before the fire; on Monday, it rose to as much as £40, a fortune equivalent to more than £4,000 in 2005.|$|E

5|$|The {{person was}} first whipped, or beaten, with virgis sanguinis ("blood-colored rods", probably), {{and his head}} was clad/covered in a bag made of a wolf's hide. On his feet were placed clogs, or wooden shoes, and he was then put into the poena cullei, a sack made of ox-leather. Placed along with him into the sack was also an {{assortment}} of live animals, arguably the most famous combination being that of a serpent, a cock, a monkey and a dog. The sack was put on <b>a</b> <b>cart,</b> and the cart driven by black oxen to a running stream or to the sea. Then, the sack with its inhabitants was thrown into the water.|$|E
5|$|Too weak {{to stand}} or walk, Beauchamp was loaded onto <b>a</b> <b>cart</b> to be {{conveyed}} to the gallows. He begged to see Anna, but the guards {{told him she}} was not seriously injured. The guards finally allowed him to see Anna, and Beauchamp was angered that they had underplayed her critical condition. He stayed with her until he could no longer feel her pulse; then the guards took him to the gallows to be hanged before he died of his stab wounds.|$|E
5|$|In 1795, Jones {{surveyed}} Ancaster, Thorold, Grantham, Beverley, Southwold, Whitby, York, Scarboro, Pickering, {{the lands}} of Joseph Brant and Lake Simcoe. On December 24, 1795 Jones was directed by Lieutenant Governor John Graves Simcoe to survey and open <b>a</b> <b>cart</b> road from the newly planned settlement of York, Upper Canada to Lake Simcoe. Jones began the planning work the next day. On the 29th of that December, Jones was given the assistance of thirty of the Queen's Rangers for the road's construction. The work began January 4, 1796 on this road, which would become Yonge Street. Jones worked as the effective master builder {{in addition to his}} title as surveyor. The road reached Holland Landing on February 16, 1796, and Jones returned to York on February 20 to inform the Lieutenant Governor that the road was completed. This first incarnation of Yonge Street measured some 34 miles and 53 chains. For the rest of 1796, Jones spent his time surveying Newark, Flamborough, Grimsby, Saltfleet, Beverley, York and Coot's Paradise.|$|E

5|$|Kanaan {{ran out of}} fuel on {{the final}} lap; he stopped his car between turns three and four. Andretti's {{strategy}} of four pit stops meant he was not required to conserve fuel and maintained his lead to win the race. Tagliani finished second, Fernández took third, Zanardi fourth and Dixon fifth. Tracy, Gugelmin, Papis, Nakano and Kanaan rounded out the top ten. There were four lead changes in the race; five drivers reached {{the front of the}} field. De Ferran's total of 49 laps led was the highest of any competitor. There were eleven cautions (a new track record) during the race for 31 laps. The victory was Andretti's first (and only) win of the season, his seventh at Toronto (which surpassed the record of most wins in <b>a</b> <b>CART</b> event whom Andretti previously jointly held by Al Unser Jr. with six), and the 41st of his career. The attrition rate was high, with 11 of the 26 starters finishing the race.|$|E
5|$|One {{animator}} {{was dedicated}} full-time during {{three years of}} the game's development to work out the boy's animations, including animations that showed anticipation on the player's actions or events in the game, such as reaching out for <b>a</b> <b>cart</b> handle as the player moved the boy near it. Jensen felt this was important as the character was always {{at the center of the}} player's screen, and the most important element to watch. Playdead included gruesome death sequences to highlight incorrect solutions and discourage players from repeating their mistakes. While they expected players to run the boy into numerous deaths while trying solutions, Carlsen stated that their goal was to ensure death wasn't a penalty in the game, and made the death animations entertaining to keep the player interested. Carlsen noted several early puzzles were too complex for the game, but they would end up using a portion of these larger puzzles in the final release.|$|E
5|$|The Indy Japan 300 was {{confirmed}} {{as a part}} of the Indy Racing League's (IRL) 2007 schedule for the IndyCar Series in September 2006. It was to be the fifth consecutive year the race was held in the series, and the tenth Indy Japan 300, counting the period from 1998 to 2002 when it was <b>a</b> <b>CART</b> event. Uniquely in the 2007 season, the race took place at a non-American location. The Indy Japan 300 was the third race scheduled for 2007 by the IRL, out of 17. At this early stage in the season, Dixon held the lead in the point standings with 80 points. Castroneves and Wheldon were tied for second with 75 points, and Kanaan and Hornish Jr. were fourth and fifth on 65 and 61 points, respectively.|$|E
50|$|Until 2009, {{hot dogs}} and pre-cooked {{sausages}} were {{the only kind of}} street food allowed by law. These types of hot dogs are often referred to as 'street meat' by locals, and are normally flame-grilled. The law sets extremely high requirements for street food vendors. However, there was an initiative to allow more varied and nutritious street food, which resulted in the introduction of Toronto <b>a</b> la <b>Cart</b> in 2009. Toronto <b>a</b> la <b>Cart</b> allowed vendors to sell Halal foods such as Kebab, Falafel and Shawarma. However, by 2010 Toronto <b>a</b> la <b>Cart</b> was deemed <b>a</b> failure by local politicians and discontinued.|$|R
