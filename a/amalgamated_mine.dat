25|$|Coal miners in Nova Scotia {{were first}} {{organized}} by the Provincial Workmen's Association (PWA) in 1897. The United Mine Workers of America (UMWA) attempted to organize the miners and supplant the PWA in 1908. The two unions fought for control, but in 1917 joined forces and formed the <b>Amalgamated</b> <b>Mine</b> Workers of Nova Scotia. The Amalgamated affiliated fully with UMWA a year later. Miners were represented continuously by UMWA over the next 80 years.|$|E
50|$|In 1946, in {{the wake}} of World War II, the Golden Gate, Reform, Black Cat Amalgamated, Golden Casket, Wasp and Black and White mines were reopened. Joseph Fisher and Sons {{constructed}} a road from Portland Roads to Wenlock, which necessitated seven bridges. Sheds and huts were erected and machinery was installed at the mines. At the Black Cat <b>Amalgamated</b> <b>mine</b> a Marshall portable steam engine, a rock drill sharpener, air compressor, air hoist, Blake steam duplex pump and a Worthington steam duplex pump were installed in the re-equipping of the mines.|$|E
50|$|In 1938 Larsens' Consolidated Pty Ltd {{who were}} {{employing}} 20 {{men on the}} Prohibitionist, Winner, Dole, Tin Hare and Rose leases, moved their battery closer to the Duke and other leases. The battery output was 1,122 ounces of gold from the mines and dumps. Additional drills, a generator and a wilfley table were purchased. Three head of stamps, driven by a diesel engine, were erected at the Golden Casket mine in 1938. A new multi-tubular boiler and five foot Huntington roller mill were installed at the Black Cat <b>Amalgamated</b> <b>Mine</b> in 1939 by Fisher and Sons.|$|E
50|$|Osborne was {{the first}} {{district}} Grand Master of the Freemasons of Nigeria. Before he became Attorney-General, he was a solicitor for Wassaw and Gold Coast <b>Amalgamated</b> <b>Mines.</b>|$|R
50|$|By the 1850s it {{was clear}} that the copper mines in the west of Cornwall were {{becoming}} exhausted and this together with the start of foreign production (from Chile, for instance) led to a spate of closures or further mergers to reduce running costs. Consolidated Mines ceased working in 1857, and in 1861 amalgamated with the neighbouring United Mines and Wheal Clifford to form Clifford <b>Amalgamated</b> <b>Mines,</b> which continued, unprofitably, until 1870.|$|R
50|$|By {{the late}} 1860s copper mining {{in the area}} was declining, and by 1870 it became a depression, when the Clifford <b>Amalgamated</b> <b>Mines</b> closed. This {{resulted}} in a disastrous loss of income, and decline continued. Catastrophe struck in the heavy winter of 1876-77 when the Great County Adit (a common drainage system formerly used by several deep mines) which had fallen into disrepair and become blocked, suddenly burst and caused the instant silting of Devoran Harbour, forcing vessels to discharge by tender.|$|R
50|$|Between 1917 and 1926 Cape Breton coal towns {{changed from}} company towns to labor towns, {{reflecting}} {{a change in}} the local balance of power. The main union, the <b>Amalgamated</b> <b>Mine</b> Workers of Nova Scotia, started in 1917 and won union recognition, wage increases, and the eight-hour day. The union mobilized its voters and took control of town councils. They challenged coal companies on the use of company police and assessment of taxes. The most dramatic change was the town council's success in restricting the authority of the company police, who had often served as special, unpaid town police officers. The town councils also intervened in the strife of the 1920s, assisting the miners against the British Empire Steel Corporation's wage-cutting.|$|E
5000|$|Mining {{reached its}} {{technical}} apogee in Gwennap in the 1840s with {{the installation of}} the first ever man engine in Britain at Tresavean Mine; but the nature of the area's geology, which had bestowed such wealth, eventually proved its downfall. [...] In the nearby Camborne-Redruth district, rich deposits of tin were found below the copper. In Gwennap no such deposits were found and when low prices caused the collapse of the copper market in the 1860s, many mines were forced to close or amalgamate. Consolidated and United were incorporated into Clifford <b>Amalgamated</b> <b>mine.</b> Many of the mines that continued or went over to tin production could not survive the rising cost of coal and the fluctuations of mineral prices, causing a second wave of closures in the mid-1870s.|$|E
50|$|In 1947 Joseph Fisher and Sons {{purchased}} Zamittt's mines {{to obtain}} a complete block. After finishing carting their machinery from Portland Roads harbour they commenced reconditioning the Black Cat <b>Amalgamated</b> <b>mine.</b> The first crushing was put through the battery by June 1947 and 239 ounces of gold valued at £2,264 was obtained {{by the end of}} December 1947. A total of 517 tons of stone was crushed in the first year for a total return of 296 ounces, and dewatering was commenced and completed down to below the No.1 level. The main shaft was re- timbered, a new headframe and brace constructed, and a 2,000 gallon tank installed. Also that year the Wasp Syndicate, working on the Edna May Extended and Golden Casket leases, produced 520 tons of stone for a return of 349 ounces of gold.|$|E
50|$|Accessory {{structures}} included four ditch keepers' houses. Extensive improvements {{were made}} to the mining area, including expansion of the receiving reservoir, new sluices, and two 8 in hydraulic monitors. Despite all of these measures, there was never enough water available for the mining operation to reach its full potential. Operations had to be curtailed in 1894 and again in 1896. After eleven years, the Osceola Mine shut down for good. An abortive 1906 plan to organize a new company, the Nevada <b>Amalgamated</b> <b>Mines</b> and Power Company, with plans for reduction works, a power plant, three towns and a railroad spur, never reached fruition.|$|R
50|$|From 1981 to 1983, Dr. Ofonagoro {{has served}} as Director/Chairman of the Finance and Establishment Committee of the Board of <b>Amalgamated</b> Tin <b>Mines</b> of Nigeria Bukuru, Plateau State, the largest tin mining Company in Nigeria. From 1981 to 1984, he {{has served as}} Chairman of Finance and Establishment Committee of the ATMN Board of Directors.|$|R
50|$|In 1972, Lar {{joined the}} Board of <b>Amalgamated</b> Tin <b>Mines</b> of Nigeria. He became Chairman of the Board of Directors of African Continental Bank, Member of the Nigeria Council of Legal Education {{and a member}} of the Constituent Assembly (1977-1978). He was {{vice-chairman}} of the panel chaired by Justice Ayo Irikefe that recommended expanding from 12 to 19 states during the regime of generals Murtala Muhammed and Olusegun Obasanjo.Lar was also a Board member of the USA-based World Environmental Movement for Africa.|$|R
50|$|The Wenlock {{was still}} the best {{producing}} field in Cape York in 1949, although production was far below that of 1948 - 364 ounces compared to 557 ounces. In 1950, 324 ounces of gold were produced from the Black Cat <b>Amalgamated</b> <b>mine,</b> 47 ounces from Edna May and 26 ounces from the Golden Casket. All the mines were flooded in April when the Wenlock River broke its banks. Dewatering was completed {{by the end of}} May by obtaining a Mines Department pump. Production declined markedly in 1951 to 203 ounces of gold and there were only the Fishers and one other person mining there. There were only four miners there in 1952 - the Fishers, George Scowan and Fred Taylor. Fisher and Sons put through 51 tons of Black Cat Amalgamated stone for a return of 2.63 fine ounces and another 11 tons from underground yielded 14 ounces of gold; 206 tons of dump yielded 27 ounces of gold. The total production amounted to £526. In 1953 FH Taylor, lessee of the Wasp and Edna May Extended, was carrying out improvements. He hired a Southern Cross diesel engine and pump from the Mines Department preparatory to sluicing the Edna May dump and deepening the Wasp.|$|E

50|$|Following {{national}} {{independence in}} 1964 the AMU {{changed its name}} to the Zambian Mineworkers' Union (ZMU). In April 1967 the ZMU <b>amalgamated</b> with the <b>Mines</b> Local Staff Association and the Mines Police Association to form the Mineworkers' Union of Zambia (MUZ). The amalgamation had the support of the government, as it brought an end to the conflict between the ZMU and the ruling party, the United National Independence Party.|$|R
50|$|Trained {{in civil}} engineering, Treffry {{built a new}} quay in Fowey to take larger vessels for the export of tin, the major {{industry}} of Cornwall. As a result, he became {{a partner in the}} Wheal Regent copper mine at Crinnis near Par. He then became a partner in Fowey Consols mine at Tywardreath and manager of Lanscroft <b>mine.</b> After he <b>amalgamated</b> the two <b>mines</b> in 1822 and took full control, Fowey Consols became the most productive mine in Cornwall and employed 1,680 workers.|$|R

The NRC was established in 1912 to recruit labour from the former Ciskei and Transkei as well as Lesotho (formerly Basutoland), Botswana (formerly Bechuanaland), Swaziland and KwaZulu-Natal (formerly Natal and Zululand). In 1966 the NRC became the Mine Labour Organisation (NRC) Ltd. and in 1977 it <b>amalgamated</b> with the <b>Mine</b> Labour Organisations (Wenela) Ltd. to form the Employment Bureau of Africa Ltd.

50|$|In 1903, {{frustrated}} {{when the}} Rarus property {{was subject to}} {{a court order to}} cease mining, Heinze’s miners moved down anyway from the Rarus into an adjoining Amalgamated property. Before being stopped, Heinze succeeded in taking out a hundred thousand tons of high grade copper ore. There was hand-to-hand combat with <b>Amalgamated</b> miners, opposition <b>mine</b> shafts were fouled through burning rubber and spreading caustic slaked lime, grenades were thrown, and high pressure hoses were fired. Dynamite was also set off, caving in the property and completely obliterating all the evidence. Heinze was charged with contempt of court yet he was fined only $20,000.|$|R
50|$|A {{tramline}} {{was laid}} from the Alhambra mine to the battery. Alhambra {{was the largest}} mine operating on the Coolgarra field and was the only mine in the area. Loaded ore trucks ran from the mine down to the mill, while horses hauled the empty trucks back up. Coolgarra's output of tin rose in the years 1901 to 1903, the Alhambra alone producing 20,000 pounds worth of tin in that period. The community had grown from 93 in 1893 to close to 250 in 1903. In that year 8,650 tons of ore were raised and treated but by October 1903, work was suspended pending financial reconstruction of the company known as Coolgarra Tin <b>Mines</b> <b>Amalgamated.</b> At this stage also, mines were beginning to produce a lower grade ore, which created an overall slow-down.|$|R
50|$|Houldsworth was Assistant Lecturer in the University of Leeds from 1919-26. In 1926 he {{received}} a Call to Bar by Lincoln’s Inn. He was Independent Chairman of the District Co-ordinating Committee of the Midland (<b>Amalgamated)</b> District (Coal <b>Mines)</b> Scheme 1930, from September 1936 to July 1942. In 1937 he became a Kings Counsel. He was Joint Coal Supplies Officer for the Midland Area (Mines Department) from September 1939 - July 1942. He was Fuel and Power Controller (North-Eastern Region), Board of Trade, November 1941 - July 1942. He was Regional Controller (South and West Yorkshire), Ministry of Fuel and Power from 1942-44. In 1943 he became a Bencher. He was Controller-General from 1944-45. He was Chairman of the East Midlands Division of the National Coal Board from 1946-51. He was Recorder of Doncaster from 1946-48. In 1951 he was appointed Chairman of the National Coal Board.|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe river Ankobra {{flows through}} the {{principal}} gold mining centres in Western Ghana, draining a total area of 8272 km 2 to join the Atlantic ocean. Mercury is used by thousands of small-scale miners {{in the region to}} <b>amalgamate</b> gold. Ores <b>mined</b> in some deep shafts and surface mines are arsenopyrites and the region is marked by the presence of heaps of arsenic - rich mine tailings from both past and recent activities. This study was conducted {{to assess the impact of}} mining activities on the distribution and speciation of arsenic and mercury in the aquatic environment of the Ankobra River. In all, water (filtered and non-filtered) and bed sediments were collected from various locations within the watershed. Principal parameters investigated include total mercury, arsenic (III), arsenic (V), monomethylarsonic acid (MMAA) and dimethylarsinic acid (DMAA). Seasonal and spatial variations of these parameters were investigated. Quality control systems were adopted at both the environmental and analytical stages of the study. In general, areas close to the mining centres are the most polluted. As (V) /As (III) ratios in water are reversed after the first 100 -km of the river length with the onset of industrial influence downstream...|$|R
50|$|Diamonds {{were first}} {{discovered}} on the Koffiefontein farm in 1870. Mining {{started in the}} form of small claims that were later <b>amalgamated</b> into Koffiefontein <b>Mine</b> Limited. De Beers acquired control of Koffiefontein Mine Limited in 1911. Mining operations were then continuous until the advent of the Great Depression in 1932 when work was suspended. Between 1950 and 1953, a prospecting shaft was sunk which was followed by limited production. The mine was reopened in 1970 and preparations for increased production were completed in August 1971. Immediately after completing the preparations, production from the open pit commenced and proceeded to a depth of 270 metres. Underground development started in 1974 through a sampling programme. Underground production briefly took place in 1982 but ceased soon thereafter due to the 1981 slump in the diamond market. These operations were resumed in March 1987. During the period 1972 to the end of 2004, approximately 69.5 million tonnes of kimberlite ore were mined and 6.1 million carats of diamonds were recovered. In February 2006, De Beers ceased mining when the old order mining right for Koffiefontein expired and in July of that year Petra Diamonds commenced operating the mine under care and maintenance conditions. The acquisition of the mine was completed in July 2007 and Petra Diamonds was subsequently able to commence diamond recoveries by starting to process the stockpile through the plant.|$|R
40|$|The {{advance in}} {{wearable}} and wireless sensors technology {{have made it}} possible to monitor multiple vital signs (e. g. heart rate, blood pressure) of a patient anytime, anywhere. Vital signs are an essential part of daily monitoring and disease prevention. When multiple vital sign data from many patients are accumulated for a long period they evolve into big data. The objective {{of this study is to}} build a prognostic model, ViSiBiD, that can accurately identify dangerous clinical events of a home-monitoring patient in advance using knowledge learned from the patterns of multiple vital signs from a large number of similar patients. We developed an innovative technique that <b>amalgamates</b> existing data <b>mining</b> methods with smartly extracted features from vital sign correlations, and demonstrated its effectiveness on cloud platforms through comparative evaluations that showed its potential to become a new tool for predictive healthcare. Four clinical events are identified from 4893 patient records in publicly available databases where six bio-signals deviate from normality and different features are extracted prior to 1 - 2 h from 10 to 30 min observed data of those events. Known data mining algorithms along with some MapReduce implementations have been used for learning on a cloud platform. The best accuracy (95. 85 %) was obtained through a Random Forest classifier using all features. The encouraging learning performance using hybrid feature space proves the existence of discriminatory patterns in vital sign big data can identify severe clinical danger well ahead of time...|$|R
