In some congregations the oleh follows along with the expert, reading in a whisper. In Yemenite communities, the oleh reads the portion himself, while another person, usually a young boy, recites the Targum after each verse.|$|E

25|$|Argentine cricket {{celebrated its}} 200th anniversary on 21 October 2006. An event {{was held at}} San Antonio College, where the first {{recorded}} match was played back in 1806 by British Soldiers. The history of cricket in the country can roughly be divided into various phases. From 1806 to 1900, cricket was established in Argentina, with the first international matches played, the major clubs founded, and the great North v South contest beginning. The Buenos Aires Cricket Club in Palermo was inaugurated in 1864, and is the historical reference for cricket in the country. Now known as the Buenos Aires Cricket & Rugby Club, a project is in place where cricket will once again hopefully become <b>a</b> <b>practiced</b> sport at this famous club.|$|E

Joy was not <b>a</b> <b>practiced</b> public speaker, and he stumbled and rushed through his nomination speech, [...] "because we are all now impatient for the voting."

500|$|The {{nucleus of}} the band was formed when Sean Bonniwell (lead vocals, rhythm guitar) {{took part in a}} jam session with Keith Olsen (bass guitar) and Ron Edgar (drums; born Ronald Edgar on June 25, 1946 in Minneapolis, Minnesota) – both of whom he met in the folk music circuit. Bonniwell, already <b>a</b> <b>practiced</b> [...] "folky," [...] possessed prior {{experience}} as a vocalist with the Wayfarers. The traditional folk combo had already enjoyed some regional success: releasing three albums, and building on the experience of Bonniwell who insisted on the importance of rehearsal. As Bonniwell traveled and recorded with the group, he began penning some material that would later surface with the Music Machine. [...] However, still influenced by acts now considered passé, the Wayfarers' musical conservatism became stifling to Bonniwell who wanted to explore the type of harder, cutting-edge stylistic possibilities that he eventually would find in rock. [...] Prior to meeting, Olsen had previously performed in Gale Garnett's backing band, and Edgar {{was a member of a}} bohemian folk quintet called the GoldeBriars. [...] With the GoldeBriars, Edgar contributed to their unreleased third album that was originally intended for distribution on Epic Records, but the group disbanded before it could be released.|$|E
30|$|All five {{primary care}} {{practice}} factors (total number of GPs, number of male GPs, {{number of female}} GPs, practice list size and number of patients referred from <b>a</b> <b>practice)</b> are correlated with each other (0.202 – 0.832, P ≤  0.01). The number of GPs within <b>a</b> <b>practice</b> is correlated weakly with the WIMD overall (0.120, P ≤  0.01) and WIMD health (0.112, P ≤  0.01).

Rajeev Masand gave the film a rating of 3 out of 5, and wrote, [...] "Fashion is an easy watch because the very subject lends itself to so much interest.

2500|$|Cold {{reading is}} a set of {{techniques}} used by mentalists, psychics, fortune-tellers, mediums, illusionists (readers), and other scam artists, to imply [...] that the reader knows much more about the person than the reader actually does.

Psychologists believe that this appears to work because of the Forer effect and due to confirmation biases within people.|$|E
