40|$|Abstract. We are {{currently}} investigating methods to triplify {{the content of}} Wikipedia’s tables. We propose that existing knowledge-bases can be leveraged to semi-automatically extract high-quality facts (in the form of RDF triples) from tables embedded in Wikipedia <b>articles</b> (<b>henceforth</b> called “Wikitables”). We present a survey of Wikitables and their content in a recent dump of Wikipedia. We then discuss some ongoing work on using DBpedia to mine novel RDF triples from these tables: we present methods that automatically extract 24. 4 million raw triples from the Wikitables at an estimated precision of 52. 2 %. We believe this precision can be (greatly) improved through machine learning methods and sketch ideas for features that should help classify (in) correct triples. ...|$|R
30|$|Considering the {{importance}} of teaching English, many curriculum reforms took place targeting the improvement of English teaching and learning scenario in Bangladesh. Communicative Language Teaching (CLT)-based curriculum was introduced {{at the secondary level}} of education in 1996 with a desire to bring positive changes in English language teaching and learning. Later in 2001, the first CLT-based SSC English examination took place countrywide. Regarding this, {{it should be noted that}} public examination or high stakes examinations have commonly been used to implement the curriculum in many other countries too (Cheng, 1998, 2002, 2005). But “the nature of high-stakes-test-induced curricular control is highly dependent on the structures of the tests themselves” (Au, 2007, p. 258). So, it is necessary to examine the examination itself to understand if it is adequate to serve the purpose. However, no scholarly research article has been published so far aiming at examining the SSC English examination from a scholarly standpoint. The primary aim of this <b>article,</b> <b>henceforth,</b> is to review the characteristics of the SSC English examination from a critical perspective and describe them as it is from scholarly perspectives.|$|R

40|$|Purpose. Since {{last few}} years, cold chain {{management}} (CCM) has gained growing interest among practitioners, policymakers, researchers, and academicians. This paper provides a review focused on food cold chain management (FCCM) {{over the last}} sixteen years to identify {{state of the art}} in the literature, highlight research gaps, and define appropriate research questions for future research. Design/methodology/approach. The paper analyses the content of 89 research articles published on the topic of food cold chain (FCC) from 2001 to 2016 within different journals. The Scopus and Web of Science databases were taken into consideration to shortlist research <b>articles.</b> <b>Henceforth,</b> we scrutinized the FCC industry to offer some effective strategies to tackle the chain complexities. We also draw interwoven between FCC infrastructure, integration, stakeholders’ interest, value addition, partners’ performance and overall food cold chain performance (FCCP) into a conceptual framework. Findings. This paper identifies four research gaps in the literature of FCC concerning the most popular approaches used for the FCCP measurement, the performance measurement metrics, the factors which negatively affect the FCCP, and the main sustainability issues in FCC. Originality/value. This study identifies research questions which represent possible areas of investigation to improve the body of the FCCP evaluation and management. Furthermore, the FCC practitioners, food authorities, and researchers might find this review useful, as it draws a clear picture of research in the respective domain...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe article {{system of}} English {{language}} is a linguistic form that is taken for granted by the native speakers of this language; however {{when it comes to}} the acquisition of it by non-native speakers, it turns out to be too complex to understand. This could stem from the differences between the mother tongue of the learners and the target langauge. Turkish context is an example for such cases since it consists of learners whose mother tongue does not include an article system and among the articles especially the definite one ‘the’ is problematic for Turkish learners of English because Turkish language has no definite <b>article.</b> <b>Henceforth,</b> this study aims to investigate the acquisition of the definite article in English by Turkish ELT students, namely the prospective teachers of English, focusing on only one aspect of it, that is, the various nongeneric uses of it. For the study, a grammaticality judgment test, adapted from Liu and Gleason (2002), was used. 80 students from the ELT department of a state university in Turkey participated in the study. 40 of the participants were 1 st graders while the other 40 were the 4 th grade students at the same department. The results of the study revealed that participants had problems in the application of correct uses of nongeneric the, especially in the cultural use of it. Also, there was no significant difference between the overall scores of the participants from different grades...|$|R
40|$|My target <b>article</b> (<b>henceforth</b> {{referred}} to as TA) presents evidence for causal interactions between consciousness and brain and some standard ways of accounting for this evidence in clinical practice and neuropsychological theory. I also point {{out some of the}} problems of understanding such causal interactions that are not addressed by standard explanations. Most of the residual problems have to do with how to cross the “explanatory gap” from consciousness to brain. I then list some of the reasons why the route across this gap suggested by physicalism won't work, in spite of its current popularity in consciousness studies. My own suggested route across the explanatory gap is more subterranean, where consciousness and brain can be seen to be dual aspects of a unifying, psychophysical mind. Some of the steps on this deeper route still have to be filled in by empirical research. But (as far as I can judge) there are no gaps that cannot be filled—just a different way of understanding consciousness, mind, brain and their causal interaction, with some interesting consequences for our understanding of free will. The commentaries on TA examined many aspects of my thesis viewed from both Western and Eastern perspectives. This reply focuses on how dual-aspect monism compares with currently popular alternatives such as “nonreductive physicalism”, clarifies my own approach, and reconsiders how well this addresses the “hard” problems of consciousness. We re-examine how conscious experiences relate to their physical/functional correlates and whether useful analogies can be drawn with other, physical relationships that appear to have dual-aspects. We also examine some fundamental differences between Western and Eastern thought about whether the existence of the physical world or the existence of consciousness can be taken for granted (with consequential differences about which of these is “hard” to understand). I then suggest a form of dual-aspect Reflexive Monism that might provide a path between these ancient intellectual traditions that is consistent with science and with common sense...|$|R

30|$|From the {{inception}} of the gender lens into migration studies in the early 1980 s (Morokvasic, 1984), the topic of childcare was seen as a burning issue for migrant mothers (Hondagneu-Sotelo & Avila, 1997). Since then, literature has extensively dealt with (transnational) care provisions pertaining to the challenges linked to childcare (Zontini, 2006; Ryan, 2007; Ryan, Sales, Tilki, & Siara, 2008; Kofman, 2012; Baldassar & Merla, 2014; Barglowski, Bilecen, & Amelina, 2015; Barglowski, Krzyżowski, & Świątek, 2015; Pustułka, 2016). These are undergirded by the fact that relocating abroad largely entails changes in women’s social relations and mothering practices, often devoid of support from the kinship members as a direct consequence of mobility. At the same time, studies have also shown that in spite of the changing gender norms, women still carry the main burden of securing childcare. This especially holds for the early motherhood period which engenders manifold social risks, because children’s early years are seen as requiring intensive maternal care. As a result, motherhood often hinders women’s labour market performance and deteriorates their economic position (Miller, 2007; Pustułka, 2015). The ways women strategize their childcare choices in the bounds of their social class is thus of utmost relevance for their future life chances. Although it has been shown before that mothers differently use childcare facilities according to their class (Lareau, 2000; Jensen, 2010), these insights have not been sufficiently applied to the distinct realities of migrant motherhood (see also, Fibbi & Truong, 2015). In this article, we therefore look at how social class patterns early childcare choices of women from Poland who have migrated to Germany and the United Kingdom. The comparative approach perused in this <b>article</b> <b>henceforth</b> looks at how social class plays out in two, different welfare regimes. In doing so, growing interest in various issues around migrant care, such as maternal capital brokering (Erel, 2010), access and construction of social networks post-migration (Zontini, 2006; Ryan, 2007; Ryan et al., 2008), transnationalisation of care practices (Kofman, 2012; Baldassar & Merla, 2014) and access to formal and informal care (Barglowski, Bilecen, & Amelina, 2015; Barglowski, Krzyżowski, & Świątek, 2015) are accounted for. Specifically, we pay attention to how migrant mothers’ capital shapes parenting of young children below the age of six. The 6 -year-old mark demarcates the end of a particularly care-intensive phase in children’s lives and usually signifies a transition from home-based to school-led socialization and care. Importantly, this temporal frame tends to also coincide with a period when people make greatest advances in their professional lives, thus putting women at a disadvantage of facing doubled work and family challenges. Consequently, parenting young children is also tangibly interlinked with the scope and span of social protections available in a given welfare regime.|$|R
30|$|It {{is known}} that token {{frequency}} has a strong influence on the memory representations and lexical strengths of words due to its “conserving effect.” (Bybee 2006 : 10) Bybee contends that high-frequency tokens are more accessible and resistant to change because “repetition strengthens memory representations.” High-frequency tokens also {{tend to have a}} high degree of “autonomy,” which Bybee and Brewer characterize as “the extent to which a word is likely to be represented in the speakers’ lexicon as a whole and separate unit” (Bybee and Brewer 2006 : 50). Because these cognitive effects of token frequency are highly relevant to how well the public registers, receives, remembers, and responds to individual anti-corruption metaphors, we wanted to identify the most entrenched metaphor token {{in each of the four}} categories 7. Since CPD consists of 48 articles in total, it is not ideal for obtaining token frequency information that reflects the overall site-wide distributions of tokens in the target period. However, technical challenges associated with the use of the Web as corpus limited our ability to obtain site-wide token frequencies of the metaphors. To solve this problem, we used an alternative measure—total <b>article</b> entries (<b>henceforth</b> TAE) in which a given metaphor occurs. Although this figure indirectly informs of the entrenchment of a given metaphor token, it offers clear indication of how pervasive and entrenched a metaphor is in the party discourse. Guided by the working hypothesis that the higher the number of article entries that use a metaphor, the more entrenched that metaphor is, we ran keyword searches of the PD website for the metaphor tokens identified in the CPD, using the Google search-within-site-within-period function, to see the TAE that contain each token 8. The metaphor token with the highest TAE in each metaphor category was identified as the most entrenched metaphor token (henceforth MEMT).|$|R
