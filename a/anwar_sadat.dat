5|$|After {{events in}} Munich, Jennings {{continued}} {{to report on}} Middle East issues. In 1973, he covered the Yom Kippur War, and the following year, he served as chief correspondent and co-producer of Sadat: Action Biography, a profile of Egyptian president <b>Anwar</b> <b>Sadat</b> that would win him his first of two George Foster Peabody Awards. The documentary established Jennings as Sadat's favorite correspondent. That summer, Jennings married {{for the second time}} to Anouchka Malouf, a Lebanese photographer. His first wife was childhood sweetheart Valerie Godsoe.|$|E
5|$|In early May 1971 Qandil {{left the}} ABSU after refusing {{to launch a}} {{disciplinary}} investigation of the technical team that recorded the Labor Day speech given by <b>Anwar</b> <b>Sadat,</b> who became president following Nasser's death in 1970. He left {{at a time when}} numerous broadcasters and media personalities were removed from their positions during Sadat's Corrective Revolution. However, he briefly returned to television in 1973 to announce Egypt's claimed victory in the Yom Kippur War with Israel in October of that year.|$|E
5|$|Nasser died {{unexpectedly}} in November 1970, with Gaddafi {{playing a}} prominent role at his funeral. Nasser was succeeded by <b>Anwar</b> <b>Sadat,</b> who suggested that rather than creating a unified state, the Arab states should create a political federation, implemented in April 1971; in doing so, Egypt, Syria and Sudan received large grants of Libyan oil money. In February 1972, Gaddafi and Sadat signed an unofficial charter of merger, {{but it was never}} implemented because relations broke down the following year. Sadat became increasingly wary of Libya's radical direction, and the September 1973 deadline for implementing the Federation passed by with no action taken.|$|E

5|$|Since Arafat {{was raised}} in Cairo, the {{tradition}} of dropping the Mohammed or Ahmad portion of one's first name was common; notable Egyptians such as <b>Anwar</b> <b>Sadat</b> and Hosni Mubarak did so. However, Arafat dropped Abdel Rahman and Abdel Raouf from his name as well. During the early 1950s, Arafat adopted the name Yasser, {{and in the early}} years of Arafat's guerrilla career, he assumed the nom de guerre of Abu Ammar. Both names are related to Ammar ibn Yasir, one of Muhammad's early companions. Although he dropped most of his inherited names, he retained Arafat due to its significance in Islam.|$|E
5|$|In 1967, {{just before}} the {{outbreak}} of the Six-Day War, Podgorny delivered an intelligence report to Egyptian Vice President <b>Anwar</b> <b>Sadat</b> which claimed, falsely, that Israeli troops were massing along the Syrian border. That same year, he engaged in a dialogue with Pope Paul VI as part of the pontiff's ostpolitik; the result was greater openness for the Roman Catholic Church in Eastern Europe. In 1971 Podgorny went on two state visits, the first to the People's Republic of China (PRC) and the second to North Vietnam; Kosygin went on a visit to Canada while Brezhnev visited Yugoslavia. Podgorny frequently paid visits to North Vietnam during the Vietnam War to discuss Soviet-Vietnamese foreign relations. In 1973, Podgorny visited Finland and Mohammed Daoud Khan's Afghanistan.|$|E
5|$|On October 6, 1973, Egypt {{launched}} Operation Badr, {{which started}} the Yom-Kippur War. It succeeded in crossing the Suez Canal and establishing bridgeheads {{on the east}} bank in Israeli-occupied Sinai, and counter-attacks by launched by Israeli reserves were unsuccessful. By October 10, fighting along the front {{had come to a}} lull. Egyptian President <b>Anwar</b> <b>Sadat</b> soon ordered an offensive to seize the strategic Sinai mountain passes, despite protests and objections by his senior commanders against such an offensive. Sadat hoped to divert Israeli pressure from the Syrians. The October 14 offensive was ill-planned and ill-executed, and culminated in heavy Egyptian losses without achieving any objectives.|$|E

5|$|The 1967 war {{severely}} depleted Egypt's military strength, as most {{of their}} air force and a large quantity of equipment was destroyed. Soviet assistance helped the Egyptian military to start the rebuilding of their armed forces shortly after the war, and by September 1968 Egyptian ground forces sufficiently recovered to challenge the Israeli presence east of the Suez canal. The War of Attrition began with Egyptian artillery barrages and commando raids into the Sinai, which were countered by deep-striking Israeli airstrikes and heli-borne raids into Egypt. Egypt's inability to challenge Israeli air superiority led to the deployment of Soviet-operated air-defense assets to protect parts of Egypt's interior, deterring the Israelis from launching their deep penetration raids and allowing the Egyptians to rebuild their air defenses. The defensive upgrades incurred increasing Israeli air losses, leading to an August 1970 ceasefire that lasted until 1973. Nasser died in September 1970 and was succeeded by <b>Anwar</b> <b>Sadat.</b>|$|E
5|$|<b>Anwar</b> <b>Sadat</b> was {{convinced}} that a regiment reinforced with aircraft could firmly secure Al-Sallal and his free officer movement, but within three months of sending troops to Yemen, Nasser realized that this would require a larger commitment than anticipated. A little less than 5,000 troops were sent in October 1962. Two months later, Egypt had 15,000 regular troops deployed. By late 1963, the number was increased to 36,000; and in late 1964, the number rose to 50,000 Egyptian troops in Yemen. In late 1965, the Egyptian troop commitment in Yemen was at 55,000 troops, which were broken into 13 infantry regiments of one artillery division, one tank division and several Special Forces as well as paratroop regiments. Ahmed Abu-Zeid, who served as Egypt's ambassador to royalist Yemen from 1957 to 1961, sent numerous reports on Yemen that did not reach Ministry of Defense officials. He warned Egyptian officials in Cairo, including Defense Minister Amer, that the tribes were difficult and {{had no sense of}} loyalty or nationhood. He opposed sending Egyptian combat forces and, arguing that only money and equipment be sent to the Yemeni Free Officers, and warned that the Saudis would finance the royalists.|$|E
