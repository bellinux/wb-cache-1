40|$|Authenticated Encryption (AE) is the {{cryptographic}} {{process of}} providing simultaneous confidentiality and integrity protection to messages. This approach {{is more efficient}} than applying a two-step process of providing confidentiality for a message by encrypting the message, and in a separate pass providing integrity protection by generating a Message Authentication Code (MAC). AE using symmetric ciphers can be provided by either stream ciphers with built in authentication mechanisms or block ciphers using appropriate modes of operation. However, stream ciphers {{have the potential for}} higher performance and smaller footprint in hardware and/or software than block ciphers. This property makes stream ciphers suitable for resource constrained environments, where storage and computational power are limited. There have been several recent stream cipher proposals that claim to provide AE. These ciphers can be analysed using existing techniques that consider confidentiality or integrity separately; however currently there is no existing framework for the analysis of AE stream ciphers that analyses these two properties simultaneously. This thesis introduces a novel framework for the analysis of AE using stream cipher algorithms. This thesis analyzes the mechanisms for providing confidentiality and for providing integrity in AE algorithms using stream ciphers. There is a greater emphasis on the analysis of the integrity mechanisms, as there is little in the public literature on this, in the context of authenticated encryption. The thesis has four main contributions as follows. The first contribution is the design of a framework {{that can be used to}} classify AE stream ciphers based on three characteristics. The first classification applies Bellare and Namprempre's work on the the order in which encryption and authentication processes take place. The second classification is based on the method used for accumulating the input message (either directly or indirectly) into the into the internal states of the cipher to generate a MAC. The third classification is based on whether the sequence that is used to provide encryption and authentication is generated using a single key and initial vector, or two keys and two initial vectors. The second contribution is the application of an existing algebraic method to analyse the confidentiality algorithms of two AE stream ciphers; namely SSS and ZUC. The algebraic method is based on considering the nonlinear filter (NLF) of these ciphers as a combiner with memory. This method enables us to construct equations for the NLF that relate the (inputs, outputs and memory of the combiner) to the output keystream. We show that both of these ciphers are secure from this type of algebraic attack. We conclude that using a keydependent SBox in the NLF twice, and using two different SBoxes in the NLF of ZUC, prevents this type of algebraic attack. The third contribution is a new general matrix based model for MAC generation where the input message is injected directly into the internal state. This model describes the accumulation process when the input message is injected directly into the internal state of a nonlinear filter generator. We show that three recently proposed AE stream ciphers can be considered as instances of this model; namely SSS, NLSv 2 and SOBER- 128. Our model is more general than a previous investigations into direct injection. Possible forgery attacks against this model are investigated. It is shown that using a nonlinear filter in the accumulation process of the input message when either the input message or the initial states of the register is unknown prevents forgery attacks based on collisions. The last contribution is a new general matrix based model for MAC generation where the input message is injected indirectly into the internal state. This model uses the input message as a controller to accumulate a keystream sequence into an <b>accumulation</b> <b>register.</b> We show that three current AE stream ciphers can be considered as instances of this model; namely ZUC, Grain- 128 a and Sfinks. We establish the conditions under which the model is susceptible to forgery and side-channel attacks...|$|E

The investigation covered the canal section from Bezdan to Prigrevica. By analyzing the chemical composition of dominant aquatic species in four locations of the section, we defined the species with the highest capacity to accumulate nutrients and heavy metals. Concentrations of P and K as well as of a beneficial element Na in the tissues of the analyzed macrophytes were both species- and site-dependent. The highest <b>accumulation</b> was <b>registered</b> for Ceratophyllum demersum while the species Elodea canadensis showed increased P and K accumulation values in the location Sombor. The lowest concentrations of almost all heavy metals were recorded near Sombor, indicating that this section suffered the lowest chemical pollution. Highest concentrations of all of the analyzed heavy metals were recorded in the tissue of Ceratophyllum demersum from the location Prigrevica, possibly due to the influx of polluted drainage waters from surrounding agricultural areas as well as industrial wastewaters. The obtained results showed that the enforcement of biomonitoring and analyses of other parameters indicative of ecosystem conditions might be useful for improved protection of areas experiencing a strong human impact...|$|R

Operating the dial error-free required smooth rotary motion of the finger wheel by the user, but was found as too unreliable. This mechanism was soon refined to include a recoil spring and a centrifugal governor to control the recoil speed. The user selected a digit to be dialed by inserting a finger into the corresponding hole and rotated the dial to the finger stop. When released from this position, the dial pulsing contacts were opened and closed repeatedly, thus interrupting the loop current in a pattern on the return to the home position. The exchange switch decoded the pattern for each digit thus transmitted by stepping relays or by <b>accumulation</b> in digit <b>registers.</b>|$|R
40|$|Abstract—The 2 D Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) is a {{time-consuming}} kernel in many multimedia {{applications such}} as JPEG 2000 and MPEG- 4. The 2 D DWT consists of horizontal filtering along the rows followed by vertical filtering along the columns. The vertical filtering is easy to vectorize (assuming row-major order), but to vectorize the horizontal filtering many overhead instructions are required. In this {{paper we propose some}} SIMD architectural enhancements, such as the MAC operation, extended subwords, and the matrix register file technique, to develop high-performance implementations of the 2 D DWT on SIMD architectures. The MAC operation performs four 32 -bit single-precision floating-point multiplications with <b>accumulation.</b> The matrix <b>register</b> file allows to load data stored consecutively in memory to a column of the register file, where a column corresponds to corresponding subwords of different registers. These techniques avoid the need of data rearrangement instructions. In addition, in order to avoid data type conversion instructions, the extended subword technique is applied for the (5, 3) lifting transform. Extended subwords use registers that are wider than the packed format used to store the data. These techniques provide speedups of up to 2. 90 and 1. 32 for the (5, 3) lifting and Daub- 4 transforms, respectively. Keywords-Parallelization, SIMD Architectures, DWT. I...|$|R

The experiment {{was carried out}} in a greenhouse, from May to July 2006, at DNR, Soil Science Sector, Agronomical Sciences College, UNESP, Botucatu, São Paulo State. The experiment was installed in randomized blocks and constituted of a 4 x 2 factorial scheme, being four gerbera cultivars (Cherry, Golden Yellow, Salmon Rose and Orange) and two concentrations of nutritive solution (S 1 - 50 % and S 2 - 100 %), corresponding to the electrical conductivity of 0, 92 and 1, 76 dS m- 1, during the vegetative period and 1, 07 and 2, 04 dS m- 1, during the reproductive one.

40|$|As a {{consequence}} of the non-climacteric status of grapes (Vitis vinifera), ethylene biosynthesis and signal transduction have scarcely been studied in this fruit. In spite this drawback, the available information suggests a role for ethylene in ripening grape berries. In this work, we report the identification of three homologous genes that encode 1 -aminocyclopropane- 1 -carboxylic acid oxidase (ACO), a key component of ethylene biosynthesis. A comparison of protein sequences revealed that all three VvACOs harbor a 2 OG-Fe(II) oxygenase domain, which is typical of the ACO gene family; however, VvACO 1 showed a higher amino acid sequence homology with VvACO 2 than with VvACO 3. The expression pattern of VvACOs and the effect of exogenous ethylene on their transcript accumulation were evaluated during table grape berry development in the “Thompson Seedless” cultivar. A peak in VvACO 1 transcript <b>accumulation</b> levels was <b>registered</b> around veraison that was 4 -fold higher than at harvest, and this peak was confirmed during a second season in grapes that were harvested from three different vineyards. An enhancement in ethylene production and VvACO genes transcript levels was observed in grapes sprayed with ethephon during berry development. However, VvACO 1 transcripts reached the highest accumulation earlier than VvACO 2 and VvACO 3. Altogether, these data confirmed that ethylene may have a role in some aspects of the grape ripening process, and they also highlighted the potential use of some VvACO genes as molecular markers for identifying grape veraison stages in grapes...|$|R

According to image of fluorescence signal distribution the location of photosensitizer accumulation in the cell may be detected accurately and the spectrum of fluorescence signal of near IR-range in the targeted point may be obtained. The developed system is quite comprehensive because {{there is an opportunity}} to choose technical parameters, operating modes, measuring methods and analysis. The advantage of the developed microscope-spectrum analyzer is an opportunity to focus emission and create high power intensity on the irradiated area by means of laser source with small-angle beam spreading, all this allow to perform ultra-precise operations with cells. Particularly, tunable size of the diaphragm opening in the far field allows to register fluorescence signal on certain cell organoids. By means of developed system the studies of accumulation of the new bacteriochlorine photosensitizers on HeLa cell line were performed. The system allowed to <b>register</b> <b>accumulation</b> of cancer cells with definite sites of selectively accumulated photosensitizer.

40|$|AbstractProductivity of {{temperate}} deciduous crops {{is potentially}} {{more vulnerable to}} climate change than many annual crops because temperate deciduous crops flower and set crops {{at the beginning of}} the growing season when temperatures vary greatly. The fruit development periods (time between bloom and harvest) of many fruit tree species (peach and nectarine (Prunus persica), plum (Prunus salicina), prune (Prunus domestica), sweet cherry (Prunus avium), almond (Prunus dulcis), pear (Pyrus communis)) are inversely related to accumulated heat during the first month after bloom – the higher the accumulated heat, the shorter the fruit development period (Fig. 1). The fruit development period of a cultivar can vary among years by as much as 30 days and most of the effects on development occur during the early stages of fruit development. Thus, spring temperatures can have significant effects on fruit sizes and/or tree yields because, during warm springs, rates of fruit growth cannot keep up with rates of fruit development when spring temperatures are excessively high. In recent years spring temperature variability appears to be increasing. While historic mean growing degree hour (GDH) accumulations in the month after peach tree bloom in California were around 6000 GDH, recently 3 years have <b>registered</b> <b>accumulations</b> over 8000 GDH and one year was above 9000 GDH. This caused early harvests and problems with fruit size. A harvest prediction model has been developed to help growers cope with these variable weather events ([URL] In addition, prolonged temperatures > 27 o C occurring during bloom have also negatively affected fruit set of prunes (Prunus domestica) and sweet cherries (Prunus avium). California prune production is especially vulnerable because it is dependent a single cultivar.

40|$|En las costas del sudeste de Buenos Aires hay dos {{relieves}} geomorfológicos de importancia, las playas arenosas bajas con grandes campos de médanos, y las playas de bolsillo ubicadas entre acantilados de loess u ortocuarcitas. Al Norte y Sur de la ciudad de Mar del Plata, hay extensos campos de médanos que conforman la Barrera Oriental y Austral. La conformación de estas costas es relativamente moderna ya que se han formado con posterioridad a la fluctuación holocena del nivel del mar. El objetivo del presente estudio se centró en analizar los cambios morfológicos naturales y artificiales de las playas de los partidos de Pinamar, Villa Gesell, Mar Chiquita, General Pueyrredón, General Alvarado, Lobería y Necochea, mediante la descripción y discusión de resultados obtenidos en relevamientos de playa realizados desde 1983 al 2004, con especial énfasis en la dinámica sedimentaria de sus playas y las características físicas naturales o introducidas por el hombre, como por ejemplo construcción de obras de defensa o movimiento de arenas. Los relevamientos se ejecutaron en playas con diferente orientación, dinámica, cantidad y calidad de sedimento, así como distinto grado de alteración producido por las actividades humanas. Los perfiles permitieron analizar la magnitud y velocidad de los cambios morfológicos, al tiempo que se estudiaron las variaciones texturales de las distintas zonas de la playa, reconociendo su variabilidad y la significación estadística de la misma. El trabajo se basó en la comparación de relevamientos planialtimétricos de las playas según métodos convencionales, en la evaluación de las características físicas de las olas que llegan a ellas para alcanzar una clasificación morfodinámica basada en las ecuaciones del número de Dean, parámetro W, el número de Battjes y el parámetro de Guza e Inman. Las texturas se analizaron de muestreos superficiales de sedimentos de la playa distal y de playa frontal mediante los parámetros de Folk y Ward. También fueron evaluadas las pendientes de las playas. En la discusión se evaluó la morfodinámica de playas, sus texturas, la respuesta de las playas mixtas de arena/grava, los ciclos estacionales, tormentas sudestadas y eventos El Niño, así como el efecto de las dorsales de arena (sand ridges) y la refracción. También se evalúa la actividad antrópica, con la construcción de espigones, el relleno artificial, las construcciones sobre la playa, los pluviales, la fijación de médanos y las actividades extractivas. Las conclusiones sostienen la idea de cuatro procesos que interactúan en las modificaciones morfodinámicas de las playas analizadas como son los ciclos estacionales invierno/verano, los ciclos episódicos ligados a períodos tormentosos y de inundaciones, los efectos antrópicos, y la presencia de bancos arenosos submareales que modifican el ángulo de incidencia de las olas produciendo efectos locales. Along {{the coast}} of the Southeastern Buenos Aires Province (Fig. 1), there are two important geomorphologic relieves: low sandy beaches with dune fields, and pocket beaches located between loessic or quarcitic cliffs. To the North and South of Mar del Plata City, extense dune fields conform the Eastern and Southern barriers. These dune fields are very modern, since they have been formed as consequence of a Holocene sea-level fluctuation (Schnack et al., 1982; Violante and Parker 1993; Isla, 1997). The objective {{of the study was to}} analyse the natural and artificial morphological changes of the beaches of Pinamar, Villa Gesell, Mar Chiquita, General Pueyrredón, General Alvarado, Lobería and Necochea counties, and the description and discussion of results obtained from 1983 to 2004. Special emphasis was made to the sedimentary dynamics of these beaches and the changes induced by man-made structures (groynes fields) and sand mining. The beaches have different orientation, dynamics, grain size, as well as different human alteration degree. The work was based on the comparison of beach profiles according to conventional methods (Fox and Davis, 1978; Isla, 1992; Isla et al., 1994; Bértola, 2001), the evaluation of the morphological classification based on Dean's number (Dean, 1973), Omega parameter (Masselink and Short, 1993), Battje´s number (Short, 1996), and the parameter of Guza and Inman (1975). Surface grain sizes were analysed using the parameters of Folk and Ward (1957) and evaluating beach slope changes. North Area Morphology: These are oceanic beaches, with average width of 72 m., The berm remains stabilised or it is in setback. Berm width increases at the touristic area in Mar de las Pampas. Villa Gesell beaches (Spa Los Históricos) suffered significant variations. In the pristine areas, there is presence of dunes after the backshore, although many of them are forested. Balance: In this area, there are no structures or estuaries that could affect the littoral drift. The Pinamar-Cariló sector has recorded an important accumulation (27, 580 m³) diminishing toward the North of the urban area. The beach of Villa Gesell has also <b>registered</b> <b>accumulation</b> (18, 200 m³), except in certain areas of the centre of the urban area, where erosion existed. Toward the South of Mar de las Pampas, the trend is depositional again. Grain sizes: The sediments of the backshore have increased their size up to 1994 and begin stable since 2000. In the foreshore, the mean (phi) has a reduction tendency. It diminished from 1994 to 1996 where it stops then increases very slowly. In some samples of Mar de las Pampas and Mar Azul, bioclastic composition dominates that would indicate a source of contribution from the South that coincides with old places of extraction of sands for construction. In addition, to the South of Villa Gesell, the erosion of dunes exhumes old beach crests or non-operative overwash composed by sand with shells and gravels (Isla, 1998). Slopes: Slope increases from South to North, with anomalous values in the centre of Pinamar. Temporarily, the general slopes increase their value in the time since 1998. Central Area Morphology: General Pueyrredón beaches change from North to South in: a) beaches among closed groynes, b) artificially refilled beaches, c) oceanic open beaches, and d) beaches at the foot of cliffs; in Miramar there are also beaches among groynes, but these with more spacing to each other (e). Beaches between groynes characterise La Perla area, with average widths of 64 m. Beach fills were conducted from Playa Popular to Playa Grande, their widths are of 107 m. The oceanic beaches extending from Mar del Plata Harbour to the Punta Mogotes Lighthouse and have 102 m. Beaches at the foot of cliffs (Costa Hermosa to Los Acantilados) are narrow, about 60 m. Those beaches between groynes from Chapadmalal to Miramar are 75 m. The beaches oriented to the Southeast have higher dynamics (Alfar, Chapadmalal and Miramar) with volumetric variations of the order of several thousands of cubic meters. Some have antrophic action that modifies totally and in a few days their morphology, for what we should absorb of the seasonal effects of erosion in winter and accumulation in the analysis of the results in spring. To the end of winter, beaches recover. Balance: The beaches of General Pueyrredón and Miramar are mixed and complex. There are pocket beaches, and beaches with abrasion plains; there is an important component of constructions of coastal defences. Mar del Plata beaches recorded an erosive trend (- 2. 266 m³) excluding the refilled volumes of 1998. This demonstrates the natural eroded tendency in the beaches without artificial feeding. Toward the North of the urban area of Mar del Plata there is accumulation, in their Central section there is erosion and toward the South of the urbanisation (Punta Mogotes Lighthouse) there is accumulation again. To the South -cliff areas-, erosion dominates. As expected, the highest variability was recorded at the refilled beaches, but there are significant dynamics at other of them (Acevedo, Spa Camping El Faro and Los Acantilados). General Alvarado beaches <b>registered</b> an important <b>accumulation</b> of 28. 000 m³ of sand, of which 20 % belongs to the urban coastline of Miramar (Spa HR). Grain sizes: In these beaches, the sediments have gone increasing the mean from 1998. The beaches increased the size of their sands toward the North, with fine grains in the refilled beaches and for the effect of tombolo in Los Pinos Beach (Alfar). In some samples of Chapadmalal, coarse grains of basaltic and andesitic composition have been detected in the bottom of the backshore, and pebbles of loess in the top of the backshore. This would indicate a particular dynamics that accumulates rolling stones transported by coastal drift from the South, the first one presumably of patagonic pebbles and of eroded material of the cliff bordering, in the second. Slopes: Beach slopes decrease from North to South, with abrupt peaks in the centre of the urban areas of Mar del Plata. The extreme values in the slopes were observed in the resort places from the downtown. Temporarily, the variations in the slopes were very important; in general a tendency was appreciated to increase the slope of the general beach along the time (except in beaches like Alfonsina, Las Dunas and Los Acantilados). South Area Morphology: The beaches of this area are open and with Loess cliffs. From Miramar to Mar del Sur beach widths extend to 79 m, and from Mar del Sur to Necochea they are narrower (68 m). Touristic activities diminish southwards. The beaches with more dynamics are those that possess groynes, cliffs and abrasion plains, as long as the beach open of Cruz del Moro has had smaller volumetric variations. Some beaches have suffered antrophic action (Costa Bonita or Cruz del Moro) that modified their morphology. Balance: They are heterogeneous beaches, with cliffs and engineering works in Mar del Sur and Costa Bonita, and open beaches in Cruz del Moro and Arenas Verdes. It begins to be important the action of the streams that in certain cases obstruct the longshore drift or they are plugged by effect of the same one. In General Alvarado accumulation is appreciated toward the North and South of the urban area of Miramar, with an important accumulation in Mar del Sur. Lobería presents erosion in its entire coast (- 14. 746 m³) with more loss in its Eastern sector. Costa Bonita beaches have more dynamics and Cruz del Moro suffer less variability. In both municipalities, erosion cycles and accumulation were observed along the year in correspondence to seasonal variations. Grain sizes: In the beaches of this area, an increase of the value of the mean is appreciated from 1995. In the backshore, grain size diminishes toward the South and in the foreshore, increase toward the South. Slopes: Slopes increase from North to South. With relationship to the foreshore, the slopes are had increasing through the time and all the beaches have had important variations equally. In the discussion, morphodynamics and grain sizes were evaluated, considering specially the dynamics of beaches composed of sand and gravel. The human impact was evaluated in relation to groin construction, nourishment works, buildings at the beach, dune afforestation and sand mining. The conclusions sustain the idea of four interaction processes: 1) seasonal cycles, 2) storms and flood effects, 3) human impact, 4) presence of sand ridges that modify the angle of incidence of the waves producing local effects. The refilled beaches have passed of being reflective to dissipative; as it has only modified slopes and grain size (but not climate of waves), there is still erosive. Erosive beaches have higher slopes (more than 4 %). The increase of the slope toward the North indicates more narrow beaches with smaller areas of dry sand. Southeastern beaches are therefore more vulnerable to storm effects. The differential refraction of the waves in the Southeast, generates the continuous energy concentration in certain places of the coast (for example the cliffs in Mar del Plata). Induced for sand ridges there is convergence -erosion- and divergence -sedimentation- of orthogonal separated by few kilometres of distance. The protection of the coast cannot be considered as an individual responsibility, and for it, although local solutions exist, they don't work to regional scale; therefore, the coastal defence should be a cooperative effort among all the coastal municipalities...|$|R
