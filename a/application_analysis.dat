2500|$|Benjamin Bloom (1913–1999) {{spent over}} 50 {{years at the}} University of Chicago, where {{he worked in the}} {{department}} of education. He believed that all students can learn. He developed taxonomy of educational objectives. The objectives were divided into three domains: cognitive, affective, and psychomotor. The cognitive domain deals with how we think. It is divided into categories that are on a continuum from easiest to more complex. The categories are knowledge or recall, comprehension <b>application,</b> <b>analysis,</b> synthesis and evaluation. [...] The affective domain deals with emotions and has 5 categories. The categories are receiving phenomenon, responding to that phenomenon, valuing, organization, and internalizing values. The psychomotor domain deals with the development of motor skills, movement and coordination and has 7 categories, that also goes from simplest to complex. The 7 categories of the psychomotor domain are perception, set, guided response, mechanism, complex overt response, adaptation, and origination. The taxonomy provided broad educational objectives {{that could be used to}} help expand the curriculum to match the ideas in the taxonomy. [...] The taxonomy is considered to have a greater influence internationally than in the United States. Internationally, the taxonomy is used in every aspect of education from training of the teachers to the development of testing material. Bloom believed in communicating clear learning goals and promoting an active student. He thought that teachers should provide feedback to the students on their strengths and weaknesses. Bloom also did research on college students and their problem solving processes. He found that they differ in understanding the basis of the problem and the ideas in the problem. He also found that students differ in process of problem solving in their approach and attitude toward the problem.|$|E

Net Optics now offers a range of network monitoring solutions for telecommunications, banking, finance, government and large enterprise. In 2011, Net Optics introduced the Phantom Virtual Tap, granting users 100% visibility in monitoring virtual network environments. In January 2012, Net Optics announced its entry into the Network Performance Monitoring (NPM)/ Application Performance Monitoring (APM) arena with the acquisition of Triplelayer, a private Australia-based distributor, and its sister company, nMetrics, which specializes in network and <b>application</b> <b>analysis</b> software. The first solution featuring the companies’ combined strengths, called the appTap, offers visibility and analytics for remote and branch offices. The company’s Network Performance Monitoring family, called Spyke, extends Net Optics' Access Switching capabilities via an integrated solution that offers application intelligence (statistics, analysis) through deep packet inspection.|$|E
50|$|The {{content of}} lessons may be {{differentiated}} {{based on what}} students already know. The most basic content of a lesson should cover the standards of learning set by the district or state. Some students in a class may be completely unfamiliar with the concepts in a lesson, some students may have partial mastery of the content - or display mistaken ideas about the content, and some students may show mastery of the content before the lesson begins. The teacher may differentiate the content by designing activities for groups of students that cover different areas of Bloom's taxonomy. For example, students who are unfamiliar with the concepts {{may be required to}} complete tasks on the lower levels of Bloom's Taxonomy: knowledge, comprehension, and application. Students with partial mastery may be asked to complete tasks in the <b>application,</b> <b>analysis</b> and evaluation areas, and students who have high levels of mastery may be asked to complete tasks in evaluation and synthesis.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. An {{extensible}} and configurable processor is a programmable platform {{offering the}} possibility to customize the instruction set and/or underlying microarchitecture. Efficient <b>application</b> <b>analysis</b> can identify the application parameters and instruction extensions that would influence processor performance. An application characterization flow is presented and demonstrated on the Wavelet/Scalar Quantization image compression application. In this context, novel application metrics are identified as the percentage cover, maximum cycle gain for each basic block and candidate-induced application speedup due to possible complex instructions. Furthermore, evaluating the instruction candidates during <b>application</b> <b>analysis</b> is proposed {{in order to establish}} a link with subsequent design space exploration steps. ...|$|E
