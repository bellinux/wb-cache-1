5|$|Kirby's Dream Land {{has since}} spawned dozens of sequels across {{more than a}} half-dozen video game consoles. The first direct sequel Kirby's Adventure, {{released}} on the Nintendo Entertainment System, introduced the ability to steal powers from enemies, an ability which would become {{a staple of the}} series following it. The series has featured several spin-offs, in differing genres including a racing game Kirby <b>Air</b> <b>Ride,</b> pinball game Kirby's Pinball Land, and even an Action-Golf hybrid game Kirby's Dream Course.

5|$|Mother 3 is a {{role-playing}} {{video game}} published by Nintendo for the Game Boy Advance handheld game console in 2006. The {{music for the}} game was composed exclusively by Shogo Sakai, who he had previously composed music for games such as Super Smash Bros. Melee and Kirby <b>Air</b> <b>Ride.</b> Series developer Shigesato Itoi stated that Sakai was given the position because he understood Mother 3 the most, given {{that he could not}} use Keiichi Suzuki or Hirokazu Tanaka, the composers for the first two games, as they were both busy with other projects. Itoi also said that given the massive amount of songs in the game, over 250, he needed someone who {{had a lot of time}} to dedicate to the project and who could focus exclusively on it.|$|E

5|$|The Nintendo 3DS version {{features}} stereoscopic 3D graphics with optional cel-shaded outlines to {{make the}} characters more visible. The game also features two exclusive modes; Smash Run and StreetSmash. Smash Run, based on the City Trial mode from Kirby <b>Air</b> <b>Ride,</b> has players navigate an open environment, fighting computer-controlled enemies to earn stat-increasing power-ups, before facing {{each other in a}} randomly selected match, such as vertical or horizontal races against each other or battles with various special rules. StreetSmash is a StreetPass-based game in which players control a disc on a top-down board and attempt to knock their opponents out of the arena. The 3DS version supports the additional controls featured on the New Nintendo 3DS, such as using the C-Stick to trigger Smash Attacks, but is not compatible with the Circle Pad Pro peripheral because of hardware limitations.|$|E
25|$|Regardless of {{industry}} speculation that Nintendo would eventually publish GameCube games with Internet connectivity, the company never released a first-party title with the feature. However, several games including , 1080° Avalanche, and Kirby <b>Air</b> <b>Ride</b> feature multiplayer gameplay over a LAN connection. Third-party products, such as Warp Pipe and XLink Kai, introduced methods to connect these games over the Internet. The products aimed to show game developers a low-cost solution that demonstrated {{the feasibility of}} adding online support.|$|E

500|$|Shogo Sakai, a {{video game}} {{composer}} at HAL Laboratory whose previous works include music for Kirby <b>Air</b> <b>Ride</b> and Super Smash Bros. Melee, composed Mother 3 soundtrack. Shigesato Itoi stated that Sakai was chosen for the role given his deep understanding of the game's story and the EarthBound series in general, {{in addition to the}} fact that EarthBound composers Keiichi Suzuki and Hirokazu Tanaka were both unavailable. Sakai worked to make the music feel similar to previous entries in the series. The Mother 3 soundtrack was released on compact disc on November 2, 2006. Kyle Miller of RPGFan wrote that the game retained the quirkiness of the previous soundtracks in the series despite the change in composers. He found {{the second half of the}} album, which included reinterpreted [...] "classics" [...] from the series, to be its strongest.|$|E
