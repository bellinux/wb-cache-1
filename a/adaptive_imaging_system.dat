40|$|Medical {{ultrasound}} {{research is}} typically performed using either video image data, or summed Radio Frequency (RF) data. While such data {{has led to}} improved understanding of ultrasound image formation, and {{in the development of}} novel image formation and signal processing algorithms, it contains {{only a fraction of the}} information available in the individual beamformer channels before summation. This paper describes the development of an advanced experimental system which will simultaneously acquire RF data from 128 individual beamformer channels. We refer to such data, acquired across the transducer face, as aperture domain data. The system will be capable of continuous acquisition over a period of 1. 6 seconds, the equivalent of 50 image frames. The system will also incorporate a data interface to allow future connection to custom processing units, ultimately enabling realtime processing of aperture domain data. The system will be constructed around a state of the art Agilent Technologies SONOS 5500 ultrasonic imaging system to enable real-time imaging and preserve broad signal bandwidth, high signal to noise ratio, and high dynamic range.

40|$|System {{designs in}} single photon {{emission}} tomography (SPECT) can be evaluated {{based on the}} fundamental trade-off between bias and variance {{that can be achieved}} in the reconstruction of emission tomograms. This trade off can be derived analytically using the Cramer-Rao type bounds, which imply the calculation and the inversion of the Fisher information matrix (FIM). The inverse of the FIM expresses the uncertainty associated to the tomogram, enabling the comparison of system designs. However, computing, storing and inverting the FIM is not practical with 3 -D imaging systems. In order to tackle the problem of the computational load in calculating the inverse of the FIM, a method based on the calculation of the local impulse response and the variance, in a single point, from a single row of the FIM, has been previously proposed for system design. However this approximation (circulant approximation) does not capture the global interdependence between the variables in shift-variant systems such as SPECT, and cannot account e. g., for data truncation or missing data. Our new formulation relies on subsampling the FIM. The FIM is calculated over a subset of voxels arranged in a grid that covers the whole volume. Every element of the FIM at the grid points is calculated exactly, accounting for the acquisition geometry and for the object. This new formulation reduces the computational complexity in estimating the uncertainty, but nevertheless accounts for the global interdependence between the variables, enabling the exploration of design spaces hindered by the circulant approximation. The graphics processing unit accelerated implementation of the algorithm reduces further the computation times, making the algorithm a good candidate for real-time optimization of adaptive imaging systems. This paper describes the subsampled FIM formulation and implementation details. The advantages and limitations of the new approximation are explored, in comparison with the circulant approxima- ion, in the context of design optimization of a parallel-hole collimator SPECT system and of an <b>adaptive</b> <b>imaging</b> <b>system</b> (similar to the commercially available D-SPECT) ...|$|E

There is thus a need for more versatile SPECT systems that autonomously optimize their acquisition geometry for every task and every patient.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{addresses the}} design, development, calibration and performance {{evaluation of a}} pre-clinical <b>imaging</b> <b>system</b> called AdaptiSPECT. Single-Photon Emission Computed Tomography (SPECT) systems are powerful tools for multiple applications in small-animal research, ranging from drug discovery to fundamental biology. Traditionally, pinhole SPECT systems are designed with fixed imaging characteristics in terms of sensitivity, resolution {{and size of the}} field of view, that are dictated by the hardware configuration of the system. The SPECT system described in this dissertation can change its hardware configuration in response to the subject data it is acquiring in order to improve the imaging performance. We employed 16 modular gamma-ray detectors, each of which consists of a NaI:Tl scintillation crystal, a fused silica lightguide, and an array of 9 PMTs. The camera is designed to work with maximum-likelihood position estimation methods. These detectors are arranged into 2 rings of 8 detectors around an adjustable pinhole aperture. The aperture itself comprises three cylinders of different diameters, each with pinholes of different diameters. The three aperture cylinders are stacked together along the imager axis, and selection of the appropriate ring of pinholes is carried out by translating the entire aperture assembly. In addition, some sections of the aperture are fitted with shutters to open or close additional pinholes that increase sensitivity. We reviewed the method used to calibrate AdaptiSPECT, and proposed a new interpolation scheme specific to <b>adaptive</b> SPECT <b>imaging</b> <b>systems</b> where the detectors can move to multiple locations, that yields system matrices for any configuration employed during <b>adaptive</b> <b>imaging.</b> We evaluated the performances of AdaptiSPECT for various configurations. The magnification of the system ranges from 1. 2 to 11. 1. The corresponding resolution ranges from 3. 2 mm to 0. 6 mm, and the corresponding transaxial field-of-view ranges from 84 mm to 10 mm. The sensitivity of the system varies from 220 cps/MBq to 340 cps/MBq for various configurations. Imaging of a mouse injected with a bone radiotracer revealed the finer structures that can be acquired at higher magnifications, and illustrated the ability to conveniently image with a variety of magnifications during the same study. In summary, we have brought the concept of an <b>adaptive</b> SPECT <b>imaging</b> <b>system</b> as it was originally described by Barrett et al. in 2008 to life. We have engineered a system that can switch configurations with speed, precision, and repeatability suitable to carry out <b>adaptive</b> <b>imaging</b> studies on small animals, thus opening the door to a new research and medical imaging paradigm in which the imager hardware is adjusted on the fly to maximize task-performance for a specific patient, not, as currently, an ensemble of patients...|$|R

Singlets and doublets lenses were constructed for visible, short- wavelength infrared (SWIR), and middle-wavelength infrared (MWIR) applications. The lenses are implemented {{in a variety}} of tactical <b>imaging</b> <b>systems</b> to demonstrate their performance. A process was developed that defines the allowable fabrication variables, first for APL singlets and then for APL doublets. A first-order finite element model is described that enables going from an optical design to APL fabrication. This model was then extended to the design of fluidic doublets, which are equivalent to their two-element glass counter-parts. Two constant volume fluidic chambers were enclosed by three flexible membranes resulting in a variable focal length doublet. Chromatic focal shift was then used to compare numerical modeling to experimentally measured results. These same tools, methodology, and process were lastly used in the definition and fabrication of the SWIR and MWIR adaptive polymer lens for tactical systems. vi Imaging and illumination systems are presented, based on these lensesnotably an <b>adaptive</b> zoom <b>imaging</b> <b>system,</b> in the MWIR.

40|$|Adaptive optics {{has long}} {{been used in the}} astronomical telescopes to acquire high {{resolution}} images via the real time correction of the rapidly changing wavefront aberrations. Human retinal images also suffer from rapidly changing aberrations due to, for example, eye movements, crystalline lens fluctuations or changes in the tear film. Several research groups in the world have used adaptive optics for different retinal imaging modalities and were able to acquire high resolution images of the human retina revealing the photoreceptor mosaic. Being able to image human retina in high resolution opens a new era in many important fields, such as pharmacological research for retinal diseases, researches in human cognition, nervous system, metabolism and blood stream to name a few. Having such a potential in medicine, there is not an available commercial <b>adaptive</b> optics retinal <b>imaging</b> <b>system</b> for clinical research and practice yet. The reasons are the complexity, cost and poor reliability of the available systems of the research groups.

40|$|AbstractThe {{wave front}} field aberrations induced by {{atmospheric}} turbulence can severely degrade {{the performance of}} an optical <b>imaging</b> <b>system.</b> <b>Adaptive</b> optics refers {{to the process of}} removing unwanted wave front distortions in real time, i. e., before the image is formed, {{with the use of a}} phase corrector. The basic idea in adaptive optics is to control the position of the surface of a deformable mirror in such a way as to approximately cancel the atmospheric turbulence effects on the phase of the incoming light wave front. A phase computation system, referred to as a reconstructor, transforms the output of a wave front sensor into a set of drive signals that control the shape of a deformable mirror. The control of a deformable mirror is often based on a linear wave front reconstruction algorithm that is equivalent to a matrix–vector multiply. The matrix associated with the reconstruction algorithm is called the reconstructor matrix. Since the entire process, from the acquisition of wave front measurements to the positioning of the surface of the deformable mirror, must be performed at speeds commensurate with the atmospheric changes, the adaptive optics control imposes several challenging computational problems. The goal of this paper is twofold: (i) to describe a simplified yet feasible mathematical framework that accounts for the interactions among main components involved in an <b>adaptive</b> optics <b>imaging</b> <b>system,</b> and (ii) to present several ways to estimate the reconstructor matrix based on this framework. The performances of these various reconstruction techniques are illustrated using some simple computer simulations...|$|R

Initial systems concentrate on mammography and cephalography. In our system, the exposure in each image region is optimised and the beam intensity {{is a function}} of tissue thickness and attenuation, and also of local physical and statistical parameters in the image. Using a linear array of detectors, the system will perform on-line analysis of the image during the scan, followed by optimisation of the X-ray intensity to obtain the maximum diagnostic information from the region of interest while minimising exposure of diagnostically less important regions. This paper presents preliminary images obtained with a small area CMOS detector developed for this application. Wedge systems were used to modulate the beam intensity during breast and dental imaging using suitable X-ray spectra. The sensitive imaging area of the sensor is 512 × 32 pixels 32 × 32 μm 2 in size. The sensors' X-ray sensitivity was increased by coupling to a structured CsI(Tl) scintillator. In order to develop the I-ImaS prototype, the on-line data analysis and data acquisition control are based on custom-developed electronics using multiple FPGAs.

To analyze such sensors, a functional analysis-based framework is provided in this dissertation. The framework starts from the mathematical description of the interaction between sensor and the radiation from scene reaching it. A geometric model of the spectral imaging process is provided based on the framework. The spectral response functions and the scene spectra are considered as vectors inside an 1 -dimensional spectral space. The spectral imaging process is abstracted to represent a projection of scene spectrum onto sensor. The projected spectrum, which is the least-square error reconstruction of the scene vectors, contains the useful information for image processing. Spectral sensors with arbitrary spectral response functions are can be analyzed with this model. The framework leads directly to an image pre-processing algorithm to remove the data correlation between bands. Further discussion shows that this model can also serve the purpose of sensor evaluation, and thus facilitates comparison between different sensors. The spectral shapes and the Signal-to-Noise Ratios (SNR) of different bands are seen to influence the sensor's imaging ability in different manners, which are discussed in detail.

The principle of the method is that, for a sufficiently long exposure time, the residual turbulence is averaged into a convolutive component of the image and that phase diversity estimates the sole static aberrations of interest. The advantages of such a procedure, compared to the processing of short-exposure image pairs, are that the separation between static aberrations and turbulence-induced ones is performed by the long-exposure itself and not numerically, that only one image pair must be processed, that the estimation benefits from the high SNR of long-exposure images, and that only the static aberrations of interest are to be estimated. Long-exposure phase diversity can also be used as a phasing sensor for a segmented aperture telescope.

Because of the high spatial frequency content of aberra-tors, 2 -D arrays, which generally have smaller pitch and thus higher spatial sampling frequency, and 3 -D imaging show potential to improve the performance of <b>adaptive</b> <b>imaging.</b> Phase-correction algorithms improve image qual-ity by compensating for tissue-induced errors in beamform-ing. Using the illustrative example of transcranial ultra-sound, we have evaluated our ability to perform <b>adaptive</b> <b>imaging</b> with a real-time, 3 -D scanner. We have used a polymer casting of a human temporal bone, root-mean-square (RMS) phase variation of 45. 0 ns, full-width-half-maximum (FWHM) correlation length of 3. 35 mm, and an electronic aberrator, 100 ns RMS, 3. 76 mm correlation, with tissue phantoms as illustrative examples of near-field, phase-screen aberrators. Using the multilag, least-squares, cross-correlation method, we have shown the ability of 3 -D <b>adaptive</b> <b>imaging</b> to increase anechoic cyst identification, image brightness, contrast-to-speckle ratio (CSR), and, in 3 -D color Doppler experiments, the ability to visualize flow. For a physical aberrator skull casting we saw CSR increase by 13 % from 1. 01 to 1. 14, {{while the number of}} detectable cysts increased from 4. 3 to 7. 7. I...|$|R
40|$|We propose 35 star systems within 70 pc of Earth as newly {{identified}} {{members of}} nearby young stellar kinematic groups; these identifications include the first A- and late-B type {{members of the}} AB Doradus moving group and field Argus Association. All {{but one of the}} 35 systems contain a bright solar- or earlier-type star that should make an excellent target {{for the next generation of}} <b>adaptive</b> optics (AO) <b>imaging</b> <b>systems</b> on large telescopes. AO imaging has revealed four massive planets in orbit around the λ Boo star HR 8799. Initially the planets were of uncertain mass due in large part to the uncertain age of the star. We find that HR 8799 is a likely member of the 30 Myr old Columba Association implying planet masses 6 times that of Jupiter. We consider Spitzer Space Telescope MIPS photometry of stars in the 30 Myr old Tucana/Horologium and Columba Associations, the 40 Myr old field Argus Association, and the 70 Myr old AB Doradus moving group. The percentage of stars in these young stellar groups that display excess emission above the stellar photosphere at 24 and 70 μ m wavelengths - indicative of the presence of a dusty debris disk - is compared with corresponding percentages for members of 11 open clusters and stellar associations with ages between 8 and 750 Myr, thus elucidating the decay of debris disks with time.

40|$|Inspired by {{the light}} {{scattering}} and focusing properties of distributed optical assemblies in Nature, such as rainbows and aerosols, and by recent laboratory successes in optical trapping and manipulation, we propose a unique combination of space optics and autonomous robotic system technology, to enable a new vision of space system architecture with applications to ultra-lightweight space optics and, ultimately, in-situ space system fabrication. Typically, {{the cost of an}} optical system is driven by the size and mass of the primary aperture. The ideal system is a cloud of spatially disordered dust-like objects that can be optically manipulated: it is highly reconfigurable, fault-tolerant, and allows very large aperture sizes at low cost. This new concept is based on recent understandings in the physics of optical manipulation of small particles in the laboratory and the engineering of distributed ensembles of spacecraft swarms to shape an orbiting cloud of micron-sized objects. In the same way that optical tweezers have revolutionized micro- and nano-manipulation of objects, our breakthrough concept will enable new large scale NASA mission applications and develop new technology in the areas of Astrophysical Imaging Systems and Remote Sensing because the cloud can operate as an <b>adaptive</b> optical <b>imaging</b> sensor. While achieving the feasibility of constructing one single aperture out of the cloud is the main topic of this work, it is clear that multiple orbiting aerosol lenses could also combine their power to synthesize a much larger aperture in space to enable challenging goals such as exo-planet detection. Furthermore, this effort could establish feasibility of key issues related to material properties, remote manipulation, and autonomy characteristics of cloud in orbit. There are several types of endeavors (science missions) that could be enabled by this type of approach, i. e. it can enable new astrophysical <b>imaging</b> <b>systems,</b> exo-planet search, large apertures allow for unprecedented high resolution to discern continents and important features of other planets, hyperspectral <b>imaging,</b> <b>adaptive</b> <b>systems,</b> spectroscopy <b>imaging</b> through limb, and stable optical systems from Lagrange-points. Furthermore, future micro-miniaturization might hold promise of a further extension of our dust aperture concept to other more exciting smart dust concepts with other associated capabilities. Our objective in Phase II was to experimentally and numerically investigate how to optically manipulate and maintain the shape of an orbiting cloud of dust-like matter so that it can function as an adaptable ultra-lightweight surface. Our solution is based on the aperture being an engineered granular medium, instead of a conventional monolithic aperture. This allows building of apertures at a reduced cost, enables extremely fault-tolerant apertures that cannot otherwise be made, and directly enables classes of missions for exoplanet detection based on Fourier spectroscopy with tight angular resolution and innovative radar systems for remote sensing. In this task, we have examined the advanced feasibility of a crosscutting concept that contributes new technological approaches for space <b>imaging</b> <b>systems,</b> autonomous systems, and space applications of optical manipulation. The proposed investigation has matured the concept that we started in Phase I to TRL 3, identifying technology gaps and candidate system architectures for the space-borne cloud as an aperture...|$|R
40|$|Advances in {{computer}} technology and low cost cameras open up new possibilities for three dimensional (3 D) sound reproduction. The problem is to update the audio signal processing scheme for a moving listener, so that the listener perceives only the intended virtual sound image. The performance of the audio signal processing scheme {{is limited by the}} condition number of the associated inversion problem. The condition number as a function of frequency for different listener positions and rotation is examined using an analytical model. The resulting size of the "operational area" with listener head tracking is illustrated for different geometries of loudspeaker configurations together with related cross-over design techniques. An objective evaluation of cross-talk cancellation effectiveness is presented for different filter lengths and for asymmetric and symmetric listener positions. The benefit of using an adaptive system compared to a static system is also illustrated. The measurement of arguably the most comprehensive KEMAR database of head related transfer functions yet available is presented. A complete database of head related transfer functions measured without the pinna is also presented. This was performed to provide a starting point for future modelling of pinna responses. The update of the audio signal processing scheme is initiated by a visual tracking system that performs head tracking without the need for the listener to wear any sensors. The {{solution to the problem of}} updating the filters without any audible change is solved by using either a very fine mesh for the inverse filters or by using commutation techniques. The filter update techniques are evaluated with subjective experiments and have proven to be e®ective both in an anechoic chamber and in a listening room, which supports the implementation of virtual sound <b>imaging</b> <b>systems</b> under realistic conditions. The design and implementation of a visually <b>adaptive</b> virtual sound <b>imaging</b> <b>system</b> is carried out. The system is evaluated with respect to filter update rates and cross-talk cancellation effectiveness. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R

40|$|Microwave imaging is a {{promising}} imaging modality {{for the early}} detection of breast cancer. The two most important signal processing components of a radar-based microwave <b>imaging</b> <b>system</b> are the early-time artifact removal and the image reconstruction algorithm. Several image reconstruction algorithms have been developed and their performance has been evaluated {{in a number of}} studies. However, most of these evaluation studies were either performed on numerical breast phantoms or used an idealized artifact removal algorithm. In this paper, a range of both data independent and data <b>adaptive</b> <b>imaging</b> algorithms are evaluated using experimental breast phantoms in combination with a realistic artifact removal algorithm. The clutter rejection capabilities of each algorithm are assessed in the presence of experimental noise and residual artifacts using a range of appropriate image quality metrics.
