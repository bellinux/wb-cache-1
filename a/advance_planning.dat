He also assisted the U.S. Navy with operations in Vietnam by supplying crews and cutters for Operation Market Time.

500|$|Rainier's initial impulse on {{learning}} in November 1796 {{of the impending}} declaration of war between Britain and Spain was to draw up plans for a major invasion of the Philippines, centred on Manila in repetition of the successful British capture of Manila in 1762. Co-operating with the Governor-General of India Sir John Shore and Colonel Arthur Welleley among others, a substantial naval and military forces were earmarked for the operation {{which was in the}} <b>advance</b> <b>planning</b> stages, when unexpected news arrived in India in August 1797 announcing the Treaty of Campo Formio which brought the War of the First Coalition to an end. [...] Britain now faced France and Spain alone, while emissaries from the Tipu Sultan of the Kingdom of Mysore, an old opponent of Britain in Southern India, were seeking French assistance with a renewed outbreak of hostilities. The resources planned for the operation against Manila were therefore retained in India and the operation cancelled, but the protection of the China Fleet was still essential and Rainier diverted some of his squadron eastwards to China.|$|E

500|$|Thracia 776 uses a turn-based battle system, {{where each}} side acts within {{their turn to}} move {{selected}} units across a map using a grid-based layout. Units and their alignment or status are represented through colors, with blue units being playable and red units being enemies among others. After {{a certain point in}} the game, <b>advance</b> <b>planning</b> for units becomes available, allowing players to pick a group of units to take into a battle. When two units engage, the scene transitions to a separate battle screen where the fight plays out automatically, with each units' stats being displayed below the battle. The battle is won when the map objective is completed: objectives vary from defeating all enemies to defeating specific units or rescuing particular units, or even escaping unharmed from battle. After a point in the game, specific actions such as attacking or opening chests add [...] "fatigue" [...] to a character: should they become too fatigued, they will not be playable in the following chapter. Actions in battle reward player units with experience points (EXP): when one hundred EXP are gathered, the character will level up and their stats will be randomly raised. Each stat is capped at 20 points: stats are divided into health and magic, and passive abilities such as agility, speed and critical hit likelihood.|$|E

2500|$|The corner articulations are a {{particularly}} challenging part of rug design. The ornaments {{have to be}} woven {{in a way that}} the pattern continues without interruption around the corners between horizontal and vertical borders. This requires <b>advance</b> <b>planning</b> either by a skilled weaver who is able to plan the design from start, or by a designer who composes a cartoon before the weaving begins. If the ornaments articulate correctly around the corners, the corners are termed to be [...] "resolved", or [...] "reconciled". In village or nomadic rugs, which are usually woven without a detailed advance plan, the corners of the borders are often not resolved. The weaver then discontinues the pattern at a certain stage, e.g., when the lower horizontal border is finished, and starts anew with the vertical borders. The analysis of the corner resolution helps distinguishing rural village, or nomadic, from workshop rugs.|$|E
40|$|PURPOSE: To {{evaluate}} {{the success of}} a programme of <b>Advance</b> Care <b>Planning</b> education for nursing homes by examining the effect on staff knowledge, <b>Advance</b> Care <b>Planning</b> practice within the home and end-of-life hospital admission rates. METHOD: Three longitudinal questionnaires assessing staff knowledge, <b>Advance</b> Care <b>Planning</b> Practice and hospital deaths completed before and after the initiation of the <b>Advance</b> Care <b>Planning</b> education programme by homes that had completed the training and those yet to undergo the training. RESULTS: Superior <b>Advance</b> Care <b>Planning</b> knowledge was evident in those staff that had completed the training. There was an increase of 85 % in the number of <b>Advance</b> Care <b>Plans</b> completed in the training homes and an overall reduction in hospital deaths of 25 % for residents from training homes.

2500|$|Both {{of these}} factors counsel in favor of finding the {{challenge}} to the waste disposal regulations in 25524.2 ripe for adjudication. The question of pre-emption is predominantly legal, and although {{it would be useful}} to have the benefit of California's interpretation of what constitutes a demonstrated technology or means for the disposal of high-level nuclear waste, resolution of the pre-emption issue need not await that development. Moreover, postponement of decision would likely work substantial hardship on the utilities. As the Court of Appeals cogently reasoned, for the utilities to proceed in hopes that, when the time for certification came, either the required findings would be made or the law would be struck down, requires the expenditures of millions of dollars over a number of years, without any certainty of recovery if certification were denied. 13 [...] The construction of new nuclear facilities requires considerable <b>advance</b> <b>planning</b> - on the order of 12 to 14 years. 14 [...] Thus, as in the Rail Reorganization Act Cases, 419 [...] U.S. 102, 144 (1974), [...] "decisions to be made now or in the short future may be affected" [...] by whether we act. [...] "`One does not have to await the consummation of threatened injury to obtain preventive relief. If the injury is certainly impending that is enough.'" [...] Id., at 143, quoting Pennsylvania v. West Virginia, 262 [...] U.S. 553, 593 [...] (1923). To require the industry to proceed without knowing whether the moratorium is valid would impose a palpable [...] and considerable hardship on the utilities, and may ultimately work harm on the citizens of California. Moreover, if petitioners are correct that 25524.2 is void because it hinders the commercial development of atomic energy, [...] "delayed resolution would frustrate one of the key purposes of the [...] Act." [...] Duke Power Co. v. Carolina Environmental Study Group, Inc., 438 [...] U.S. 59, 82 (1978). For these reasons, the issue of whether 25524.2 is pre-empted by federal law should be decided now. 15 ...|$|E

40|$|Background: <b>Advance</b> care <b>planning</b> {{comprises}} {{discussions about}} an individual’s wishes for future care {{while they have}} capacity. Aim: To explore professionals’ experiences on the implementation of <b>advance</b> care <b>planning</b> in two areas of clinical care, dementia and palliative care. Design: Qualitative study, focus groups and individual interviews. Setting: North East of England. Sample: Ninety-five participants from one Primary Care Trust, two acute National Health Service Hospital Trusts, one Ambulance Trust, one Local Authority and voluntary organisations and the legal sector. Results: Fourteen focus groups and 18 interviews were held with 95 participants. While professionals agreed that <b>advance</b> care <b>planning</b> {{was a good idea}} in theory, implementation in practice presented them with significant challenges. The majority expressed uncertainty over the general value of <b>advance</b> care <b>planning,</b> whether current service provision could meet patient wishes, their individual roles and responsibilities and which aspects of <b>advance</b> care <b>planning</b> were legally binding; the array of different <b>advance</b> care <b>planning</b> forms and documentation available added to the confusion. In dementia care, the timing of when to initiate <b>advance</b> care <b>planning</b> discussions was an added challenge. Conclusions: This study has identified the professional, organisational and legal factors that influence <b>advance</b> care <b>planning</b> implementation; professional training should target these specific areas. There is an urgent need for standardisation of <b>advance</b> care <b>planning</b> documentation. Greater clarity is also required on the roles and responsibilities of different professional groups. More complex aspects of <b>advance</b> care <b>planning</b> may be better carried out by those with specialist skills and experience than by generalists caring {{for a wide range of}} patient groups with different disease trajectories...|$|R
