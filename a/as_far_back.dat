50|$|The idea {{of using}} {{techniques}} developed in chemistry to study food {{is not a new}} one, for instance the discipline of food science has existed for many years. Kurti and This acknowledged this fact and though they decided that a new, organized and specific discipline should be created within food science that investigated the processes in regular cooking (as food science was primarily concerned with the nutritional properties of food and developing methods to process food on an industrial scale), there are several notable examples throughout history of investigations into the science of everyday cooking recorded <b>as</b> <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>back</b> to 18th century.|$|R

However, the precise location of the building remained unknown until {{a small part of the}} foundations, including one original pier base, was discovered in 1989 beneath the car park at the rear of Anchor Terrace on Park Street. The shape of the foundations is now replicated on the surface. As the majority of the foundations lies beneath 67—70 Anchor Terrace, a listed building, no further excavations have been permitted.|$|R
5000|$|Behind the Screen is an American late-night weekly serial which {{aired on}} CBS (Fridays, 11:30 PM EST) from October 9, 1981 to January 8, 1982. It {{was created by}} David Jacobs (Dallas, Knots Landing) for CBS, which wanted to {{experiment}} with late night programming as a counterpoint to ABC and NBC's more successful efforts {{at that time of}} night. Drawing upon his experience with the prime-time serials, Behind the Screen was a dramatization of the goings-on at a fictional TV soap opera called Generations. This was not the first attempt to explore the concept of a [...] "soap within a soap" [...] as radio soaps had used the idea <b>as</b> <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>back</b> as the 1940s (A Woman To Remember), and Ryan's Hope had used the idea for a story in the early 1980s.|$|R

50|$|Deposition from overwash (washover) can be {{deposited}} {{onto the}} beach berm, the dune, or <b>as</b> <b>far</b> <b>as</b> the <b>back</b> barrier bay, marsh, estuary, or lagoon. Sediment deposits created during overwash exhibit consistent scaling — for example, the distance inland that an overwash deposit extends {{is proportional to the}} area that the overwash deposit covers. The distance inland that an overwash deposit extends is also correlated with the volume of sand deposited. The amount of overwash and washover sedimentation also depends on the characteristics of the storm and the setting — coastal development tends to reduce in the amount of sand deposited on a barrier island during overwash, with consequences for barrier island evolution.|$|R

Only the 152 mm M 84 (NORA-A) towed howitzer was introduced in service, while the {{development of the}} NORA-B and NORA-C weapons was carried on until 1992. After it had been suspended for many years, the development of the NORAB weapon was continued in 2003, followed by serial production of the 155 mm NORA-B 52 self-propelled system for the export needs...|$|R

50|$|After {{the reunification}} of Germany, {{it was agreed that}} the Berlin S-Bahn network would be {{restored}} <b>as</b> <b>far</b> <b>as</b> possible <b>back</b> to the condition of 1961, so the re-opening of the Anhalt line was expected. This was carried out in two steps in 1995 and 1998, with the reopening of the S-Bahn from Priesterweg. Work in Lichterfelde Süd began only in 1997, one year before the reopening. The old platform B was dismantled and a new central platform was built in its place. Platform A, some old structures and the signal box were retained. The first trains station started running from Lichterfelde Ost on 28 September 1998. The Berlin-Lichterfelde Süd-Teltow Stadt railway was opened on 24 February 2005. This line used the first three kilometres of a previously planned line to connect with the Cemetery Railway.|$|R
