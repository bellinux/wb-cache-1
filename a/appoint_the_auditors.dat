50|$|The Companies Act 1985 {{dictates}} {{that it is}} the responsibility of shareholders (rather than directors) to <b>appoint</b> <b>the</b> <b>auditor</b> at <b>the</b> annual general meeting (AGM) - section 384 of the act refers. The theory behind this is that directors cannot intimidate <b>auditors</b> with <b>the</b> threat of replacement or bribe them by offering reappointment. In practice <b>the</b> existing <b>auditors</b> of a company are generally reappointed for another term at the AGM but the shareholders are free to choose another auditor if they wish to. Directors can only appoint auditors in exceptional circumstances (perhaps to fill a casual vacancy during the year). However, such appointments by directors will expire at AGMs. The Companies Act 1985 (section 386) allows shareholders to eliminate the need to reappoint an auditor each year. If they elect to do so then it is automatically assumed that <b>the</b> existing <b>auditor</b> will be reappointed each year without the matter arising at the AGM. In such circumstances it would take an extraordinary general meeting (EGM) in order to remove <b>the</b> <b>auditor.</b>|$|R

40|$|Expose Auditors as {{not being}} {{independent}} [September 14 additions colored mauve] This {{is a response to}} the Financial Reporting Council (FRC) “Discussion Paper: Choice in the UK Audit Market ” of May 2006. In response to your Question 1, I do not agree with that the focus of debate should be on the degree of choice in the market for audit services to large public companies. This is because it is little use having an audit if it lacks quality, integrity and creditability in achieving the objectives specified in the Caparo Judgment of 1990. Indeed, the present system has such low quality, integrity and creditability one can argue that Audits should not be mandated by government {{as was the case in}} the US prior to the 1933 legislation creating the SEC. At that time market forces created a demand for companies to have their financial statements audited and perhaps it might be better to allow markets for audit quality, integrity and creditability to develop by the government repealing the need for companies to have their financial statements audited? Without an auditor, Directors could become exposed to even greater liabilities and so this could provide <b>the</b> incentive to <b>appoint</b> <b>auditors</b> who could share their exposure. It would serve them little protection to appoint an auditor who had their liabilities limited. As a result market forces could be created for directors to obtain Financial Statement Insurance (FSI) to protect them from liability and provide investor confidence in their company. The proposal to introduce FIS is based on <b>the</b> insurance company <b>appointing</b> <b>the</b> <b>Auditor</b> as put forward by US scholars Ronen (2003) and Cunningham (2004) and compared with other alternatives by Shapiro (2004). The shortcomings of FIS for the UK that do not exist in the US are discussed in my article “‘How US and UK Auditing Practices Became Muddled to Muddl...|$|R
5000|$|Although it is {{possible}} to structure corporations differently, the two basic organs in a corporate constitution will invariably be the general meeting of its members (usually shareholders) and the board of directors. Boards of directors themselves have been subject in modern regulation to a growing number of requirements regarding their composition, particularly in federal law for public corporations. Particularly after the Enron scandal, companies listed on the major stock exchanges (the New York Stock Exchange, the NASDAQ, and AMEX) were required to adopt minimum standards on the number of independent directors, and their functions. These rules are enforced through the threat of delisting by the exchange, while the Securities and Exchange Commission works to ensure ultimate oversight. For example, the NYSE Listed Company Manual Rule 303A.01 requires that listed companies have a majority of [...] "independent" [...] directors. [...] "Independence" [...] is in turn defined by Rule 303A.02 as an absence of material business relationship with the corporation, not having worked {{for the last three years}} for the corporation as an employee, not receiving over $120,000 in pay, or generally having family members who are. The idea here is that [...] "independent" [...] directors will exercise superior oversight of the executive board members, and thus decrease the likelihood of abuse of power. Specifically, the nominations committee (which makes future board appointments), compensation committee (which sets director pay), and audit committee (which <b>appoints</b> <b>the</b> <b>auditors),</b> are required to be composed of independent directors, as defined by the Rules. Similar requirements for boards have proliferated across many countries, and so exchange rules allow foreign corporations that are listed on an American exchange to follow their home jurisdiction's rules, but to disclose and explain how their practices differ (if at all) to the market. The difficulty, however, is that oversight of executive directors by independent directors still leaves the possibility of personal relationships that develop into a conflict of interest. This raises the importance of the rights that can be exercised against the board as a whole.|$|R

But, though the bull had been signed on 14 January, 1285, it had not yet received the bulla (lead seal) when Pope Martin died on 28 March, 1285, and had to wait for Pope Honorius IV to order his seal to be affixed.
