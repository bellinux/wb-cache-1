After the death of the Duke of Luxembourg, the French army was led by the Duke of Villeroi, a mediocre strategist but close to the king. The king, irritated <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>recent</b> turn of events, urged Villeroi to destroy Bruges or Ghent in a surprise attack. Villeroi, eager to please the king, instead suggested that bombarding Brussels would have more of an effect in drawing the enemy to a place in which the French could attack them strategically.|$|E
25|$|In Concert 1972 is {{a double}} live album by sitar virtuoso Ravi Shankar and sarodya Ali Akbar Khan, {{released}} in 1973 on Apple Records. It was recorded at the Philharmonic Hall, New York City, in October 1972, and is a noted example of the two Hindustani classical musicians' celebrated jugalbandi (duet) style of playing. With accompaniment from tabla player Alla Rakha, the performance reflects the two artists' sorrow <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>recent</b> death of their revered guru, and Khan's father, Allauddin Khan. The latter was responsible for many innovations in Indian music during the twentieth century, including the call-and-response dialogue that musicians such as Shankar, Khan and Rakha popularised among Western audiences in the 1960s.|$|E

25|$|According to Eve Online Creative Director Torfi Frans Ólafsson, <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>recent</b> Eve Online Fanfest, the Dominion {{release is}} planned to involve sovereignty, the {{ownership}} of districts on planets {{that are capable of}} creating industry. This player ownership system will be dynamic as it will be subject to PvP diplomacy as well as subjugation. The latter allows for linking with Dust 514, whereby players within Eve Online will be able to contract, in-game, Dust 514 players to take control of planetary regions within the Eve Online universe and these 'mercenaries' will then vie with other Dust 514 players hired by the opposing faction. The integration between the console MMOFPS game and the Eve Online MMORPG is both through community interaction and through the changeable battlefields based on the planetary architecture of a common universe—the outcome of these battles in Dust 514 will affect the status and ownership of the corresponding planets in Eve Online as well. At E3 2011 it was announced that Dust 514 is a PlayStation 3 exclusive with a PS Vita tie-in, both to be released in spring of 2012.|$|E

His dedication to naval gunnery also became apparent. Some years later, one of his captains, Joel Pringle, would write: [...] " [...] devotion to duty, sound judgment and ability to inspire loyalty in his subordinates have resulted in a constant and steady increase in the efficiency of the above mentioned batteries. <b>At</b> <b>the</b> <b>recent</b> battle practice of the Pacific Fleet in 5-inch guns, he made the largest percentage of hits of any ship of the Fleet." ...|$|E

500|$|At this time, {{the stocks}} {{of the air force}} in SWPA were low. <b>At</b> <b>the</b> <b>recent</b> Battle of Milne Bay, a Japanese {{invasion}} force had managed to sail past all but a few RAAF P-40 Kittyhawk and Lockheed Hudson aircraft, suffering only limited damage. Opinion at MacArthur's General Headquarters (GHQ) was that [...] "the failure of the Air in this situation is deplorable; it will encourage the enemy to attempt further landings, with the assurance of impunity". Unable to provide MacArthur with what he most needed—more and better aircraft and the crews to man them—Arnold decided to replace Brett with Major General George C. Kenney. Arnold hoped that Kenney and the two newly minted brigadier generals could make the best use of what was available. [...] Major General George Kenney arrived in the theater on 28 July. Kenney knew Whitehead well, having served with him at Issoudun, the Air Corps Tactical School and GHQ Air Force, and had also served with Walker at the Air Corps Tactical School. [...] "I had known them both for over twenty years," [...] Kenney later wrote. [...] "They had brains, leadership, loyalty, and liked to work. If Brett had had them about three months earlier his luck might have been a lot better." ...|$|E

The musket shots hit Hindman in the jaw, throat, and hands, and he died eight hours later due to significant blood loss. Before his death, Hindman gave a farewell speech to his neighbors and political supporters from the porch of his house. With [...] "perfect composure", Hindman told listeners to [...] "unite their courage and determination to bring peace to the people". Hindman hinted <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>recent</b> political debate with Powell Clayton as a possible motivation for the shooting and said, [...] "I do not know who killed me; but I can say, whoever it was, I forgive him." [...] He asked James H. O'Connor, the husband of Mollie's stepmother, to [...] "take care of my family and be a protector to my wife and dear little ones". After O'Connor accepted, Hindman stated, [...] "I forgive everybody, and hope they will forgive me." [...] Afterwards, he was too weak to continue speaking, and he sat down on a lounge. He remained there until he died early next morning. The assassination was announced in all major newspapers throughout the state. William Woodruff of the Gazette said Hindman died as an [...] "able and distinguished man" [...] whose [...] "short but splendid career" [...] {{had a profound impact on}} Arkansan state politics.|$|E
