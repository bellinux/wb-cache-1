5|$|If White is {{compelled}} to play Nb1–d2, {{it is sometimes}} a minuscule positional concession, <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>makes</b> it harder for this knight to reach its ideal square d5. However, if Black is later {{compelled to}} exchange Bxd2, that is advantageous to White who thereby gains the bishop pair. Besides, in some situations the Bb4 could be as misplaced as the Nd2. Finally, if White has to play Bd2, then Black should exchange the bishops only if White is forced to recapture with the Nb1, as a recapture by the Qd1 would still allow the Nb1 to reach the d5-square through Nb1–c3–d5.|$|E
5|$|September 17, 2003- Hurricane Isabel {{passes to}} the {{southwest}} of the state <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>makes</b> landfall on North Carolina. In the days preceding its landfall, Isabel produces strong waves, and upon striking land, the storm causes a 5-foot (1.5m) storm surge along the Delaware coast. The waves and surge result in beach erosion and overwash. The outer rainbands of Isabel drop around 1inch (25mm) of rain, though the storm's large circulation produces strong wind gusts of up to 70mph (112km/h). The wind gusts knock down many trees and power lines, causing {{one of the worst}} power outages for Conectiv Energy. Damage totals to $17.8million (2003USD, $20.9million 2008USD). Due to the damage, President Bush declares the entire state a disaster area.|$|E
5|$|As the Dalek discovers Rose, {{the video}} feeds to the Vault are lost, and the Doctor {{immediately}} sets off {{to try to}} get back into the Vault. The Dalek tries to kill Rose but it cannot, having found compassion from Rose's DNA. The Dalek is urged to kill van Statton, but Rose instead convinces to spare his life. She follows the Dalek <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>makes</b> its way to the highest part of the Vault and destroys the roof, exposing the area to natural sunlight that the Dalek basks in. The Doctor arrives and prepares to kill the Dalek, but Rose stops him, convincing him the Dalek has developed emotions. However, the Dalek is unable to cope with them, and it asks Rose to orders its own self-destruction to end its pain. Rose reluctantly agrees, and the Dalek shortly implodes thereafter.|$|E

5|$|Route 33 {{begins in}} Trenton on a two-lane road. It passes through central Mercer County, joining {{northbound}} U.S. Route 130 in Robbinsville Township. It leaves the U.S. highway in East Windsor {{and becomes a}} local town road into the borough of Hightstown. It turns east again as it passes {{the east end of}} the Hightstown Bypass, where it becomes a divided arterial with four lanes <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>makes</b> its way through Monmouth County toward the shore. Around Freehold, it becomes a freeway. It then crosses the Garden State Parkway's Exit 100 in Tinton Falls and Route 18 in Neptune. Here, it is locally known as Corlies Avenue. Route 33 ends at Route 71 in Neptune. It has two concurrencies along the route, one with Route 34 and the second with US 130.|$|E
5|$|State Route958 {{begins at}} an {{intersection}} with a two-lane U.S. Route6 {{east of the}} city of Corry. The route progresses northward as a two-lane roadway through the rural regions of western Pennsylvania. Route958 soon enters the community of Wrightsville, a small community of a few residences and mostly fields. At Deadmans Run Road, the highway begins to cross through a populated area, however, it soon leaves Wrightsville and turns to the northwest in the deep fields north of the community. The northwestern bend curves back to the northward progression and Route958 passes through a large farm near an intersection with Kidder Road. Some residences parallel the highway <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>makes</b> another northwestern bend and soon comes on a northward stretch into the community of Lottsville, where the highway intersects with Route957.|$|E
5|$|The most {{commonly}} known wasps, such as yellowjackets and hornets, {{are in the}} family Vespidae and are eusocial, living together in a nest with an egg-laying queen and non-reproducing workers. Eusociality is favoured by the unusual haplodiploid system of sex determination in Hymenoptera, <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>makes</b> sisters exceptionally closely related to each other. However, the majority of wasp species are solitary, with each adult female living and breeding independently. Many of the solitary wasps are parasitoidal, meaning that they raise their young by laying eggs on or in other insects (any life stage from egg to adult). Unlike true parasites, the wasp larvae eventually kill their hosts. Solitary wasps parasitize almost every pest insect, making wasps valuable in horticulture for biological pest control of species such as whitefly in tomatoes and other crops.|$|E

5|$|In nature, Suillus spraguei forms ectomycorrhizal {{relationships}} with five-needled pine species. This is a mutually beneficial relationship where the hyphae of the fungus grow around {{the roots of}} the trees, enabling the fungus to receive moisture, protection and nutritive byproducts of the tree, and affording the tree greater access to soil nutrients. S.spraguei produces tuberculate ectomycorrhizae (covered with wart-like projections) that are described as aggregates of ectomycorrhizal roots encased in a fungal rind, and rhizomorphs that are tubular fungal cords with a hard outer sheath. The fungus has ecological host specificity, and in natural soils can only associate with white pine, a grouping of trees classified in subgenus Strobus of the genus Pinus. However, under controlled pure culture conditions in the laboratory, S.spraguei has also been shown to form associations with Red Pine, Pitch Pine, and Loblolly Pine. Asian populations have been associated with Korean Pine, Chinese White Pine, Siberian Dwarf Pine and Japanese White Pine. In North America, fruit bodies appear earlier than most other boletes, as early as June (bolete fruit bodies generally begin to appear in July–September), although they may be found as late as October. Mushrooms can be parasitized by the fungus Hypomyces completus. In the asexual stage of H.completus, it appears initially as patches of whitish mold {{on the surface of the}} cap or stem that rapidly spread to cover the entire mushroom surface and produce conidia (asexual spores). In the sexual stage, the mold changes color, progressing from yellow-brown to brown, greenish-brown and eventually black <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>makes</b> perithecia, asci-containing sexual structures that produce ascospores. The perithecia are pimply and give the surface a roughened texture.|$|E
5|$|The Cleveland Bay {{generally}} {{stands between}} , and is always bay in colour. Bright bay horses (bays {{with a more}} reddish tint than normal) are the most preferred by breeders, followed by ordinary bay, dark bay and then light bay. This preference for brighter shades of bay was originally stated in the official breed standard, although this stipulation has since been removed. In some bloodlines of the breed, light, grayish hairs in the mane and tail are known as a characteristic of pure blood. White markings, except for a small star on the forehead, render the horse inadmissible to the stud book. Horses {{are expected to have}} complete black points, including completely black lower legs. Legs that are red below the knees and hocks are considered faulty in colour, although they do not disqualify a horse from registry. The occasional red legs that appear in the breed are thought to come from chestnut Thoroughbred stallions that were crossed into Cleveland Bay and Yorkshire Coach Horse bloodlines at some points in the history of both breeds. The uniformity in colour is encouraged <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>makes</b> creating matching driving teams and pairs very easy. When the breed was first developed, the horses almost always had a countershaded dorsal stripe, but these disappeared with the outcrossings of the 18th century.|$|E

25|$|One of {{the most}} crucial factors in {{successfully}} crystallising an artificial gemstone is obtaining highly pure starting material, with at least 99.9995% purity. In the case of manufacturing rubies or sapphires, this material is alumina. The presence of sodium impurities is especially undesirable, <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>makes</b> the crystal opaque. Depending on the desired colouration of the crystal, small quantities of various oxides are added, such as chromium oxide for a red ruby, or ferric oxide and titania for a blue sapphire. Other starting materials include titania for producing rutile, or titanyl double oxalate for producing strontium titanate. Alternatively, small, valueless crystals of the desired product can be used.|$|E
