25|$|Nonetheless, Gold and 35 other {{delegates from}} New York City {{appeared}} at the convention and demanded to be recognized. The Credentials Committee refused to seat them, even though the Joint Board represented about 85 {{percent of the total}} IFWU membership. AFL President Green—tired of the constant conflict in New York City, believing Shachtman and the leadership of the IFWU were incompetent, and convinced that fighting the Joint Board was a waste of money—persuaded Shachtman to <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>let</b> Gold and the other Joint Board delegates speak before the convention to make their case. Gold delivered an impassioned speech in which he denounced the attacks on the political views of the Joint Board's leadership, argued that the union should be spending its money building solidarity and fighting employers, and pushed for strong internal democratic procedures in the IFWU. But despite his pleas, the convention refused to seat the delegates, and then revoked the charters of the locals which comprised the Joint Board.|$|E

Judge Hardy (Lewis Stone) had hoped that his son would {{go to college and}} study law, but Andy isn't sure that's {{what he wants to do}} so he heads off to New York City to find a job.

That ending seemed less effective especially since we saw that she’ll be just barely hanging on in the hospital in the preview for the next episode in January.
