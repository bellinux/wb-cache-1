25|$|Each pneumofathometer gauge has an {{overpressure}} valve {{to protect it}} against gas supply <b>at</b> <b>higher</b> <b>pressure</b> than {{it is designed to}} take. This is essential as the main supply pressure is significantly higher than the maximum depth pressure on the pneumo gauge. There is also often a snubbing valve or orifice between the pneumo line and the gauge to restrict flow into the gauge and ensure that the {{overpressure valve}} can adequately relieve the pressure.|$|E

25|$|The mass {{spectrum}} {{can be used}} to determine the mass of the analytes, their elemental and isotopic composition, or to elucidate the chemical structure of the sample. MS is an experiment that must take place in gas phase and under vacuum (1.33 * 10−2 to 1.33 * 10−6 pascal). Therefore, the development of devices facilitating the transition from samples <b>at</b> <b>higher</b> <b>pressure</b> and in condensed phase (solid or liquid) into a vacuum system has been essential to develop MS as a potent tool for identification and quantification of organic compounds and peptides. MS is now in very common use in analytical laboratories that study physical, chemical, or biological properties of a great variety of compounds. Among the many different kinds of mass analyzers, the ones that find application in LC-MS systems are the quadropole, time-of-flight (TOF), ion traps, and hybrid quadropole-TOF (QTOF) analyzers.|$|E
500|$|Nitrogen {{can be used}} as a replacement, or in {{combination}} with, carbon dioxide to pressurise kegs of some beers, particularly stouts and British ales, due to the smaller bubbles it produces, which makes the dispensed beer smoother and headier. A pressure-sensitive nitrogen capsule known commonly as a [...] "widget" [...] allows nitrogen-charged beers to be packaged in cans and bottles. Nitrogen tanks are also replacing carbon dioxide as the main power source for paintball guns. Nitrogen must be kept <b>at</b> <b>higher</b> <b>pressure</b> than CO2, making N2 tanks heavier and more expensive. Nitrogen gas has become the inert gas of choice for inert gas asphyxiation, and is under consideration as a replacement for lethal injection in Oklahoma. Nitrogen gas, formed from the decomposition of sodium azide, is used for the inflation of airbags.|$|E
500|$|At {{pressures}} above approximately 10 GPa {{and temperatures}} {{of a few}} hundred kelvin or less, α-iron changes into a hexagonal close-packed (hcp) structure, which is also known as ε-iron; the higher-temperature γ-phase also changes into ε-iron, but does so <b>at</b> <b>higher</b> <b>pressure.</b> The β-phase, if it exists, would appear at pressures of at least 50 GPa and temperatures of at least 1500 K and have an orthorhombic or a double hcp structure. These high-pressure phases of iron are important as endmember models for the solid parts of planetary cores. The inner core of the Earth is generally presumed to be an iron-nickel alloy with ε (or β) structure. Somewhat confusingly, the term [...] "β-iron" [...] is sometimes also used to refer to α-iron above its Curie point, when it changes from being ferromagnetic to paramagnetic, even though its crystal structure has not changed.|$|E

2500|$|Pure water boils at [...] at earth's {{standard}} atmospheric pressure. The {{boiling point}} is the temperature at which the vapor pressure {{is equal to the}} atmospheric pressure around the water. Because of this, the boiling point of water is lower at lower pressure and higher <b>at</b> <b>higher</b> <b>pressure.</b> Cooking at high elevations, therefore, requires adjustments to recipes. [...] A rough approximation of elevation can be obtained by measuring the temperature at which water boils; in the mid-19th century, this method was used by explorers.|$|E
2500|$|In gasification, on {{the other}} hand, oxygen is {{normally}} supplied to the gasifiers and just enough fuel is combusted to provide the heat to gasify the rest; moreover, gasification is often performed at elevated pressure. The resulting syngas is typically <b>at</b> <b>higher</b> <b>pressure</b> and not diluted by nitrogen, allowing for much easier, efficient, and less costly removal of CO2. Gasification and integrated gasification combined cycle’s unique ability to easily remove CO2 from the syngas prior to its combustion in a gas turbine (called [...] "pre-combustion" [...] CO2 capture) or its use in fuels or chemicals synthesis {{is one of its}} significant advantages over conventional coal utilization systems.|$|E
2500|$|During {{the flight}} the {{loosened}} nut caused increasingly excessive valve clearance eventually allowing collision of the valve {{head with the}} rising piston fracturing the valve stem, which then allowed the inlet valve to drop open, resulting in the ignition by the spark plug of the pressurised fuel/air mixture within the inlet manifold and, eventually, the pumping of the ignited fuel outboard of the rocker cover and along {{the outside of the}} engine, leading to an extensive fire in the engine nacelle. Due to the fire [...] originating in the induction system, where the supercharged fuel/air mixture was <b>at</b> <b>higher</b> <b>pressure</b> than atmospheric, the heart of the fire was much hotter burning and intense than would be the case in a simple fuel fire.|$|E

40|$|Estimation of viscosities of {{naturally}} occurring petroleum gases provides the {{information needed to}} accurately work out reservoir-engineering problems. Existing models for viscosity prediction are limited by data, especially <b>at</b> <b>high</b> <b>pressures</b> and <b>high</b> temperatures. Studies show that the predicted viscosities of natural gases using the current correlation equations are about 15 % higher than the corresponding measured viscosities <b>at</b> <b>high</b> <b>pressures</b> and <b>high</b> temperatures. This project proposes to develop a viscosity prediction model for natural gases <b>at</b> <b>high</b> <b>pressures</b> and <b>high</b> temperatures. The project shows that commercial gas viscosity measurement devices currently available suffer {{from a variety of}} problems and do not give reliable or repeatable results. However, <b>at</b> the extremely <b>high</b> <b>pressures</b> encountered in <b>high</b> <b>pressure</b> and <b>high</b> temperature reservoirs, the natural gases consist mainly of methane as the hydrocarbon constituent and some non-hydrocarbon impurities.

2500|$|The {{supercritical}} water reactor (SCWR) is {{a reduced}} moderation water reactor concept that, {{due to the}} average speed of the neutrons that would cause the fission events within the fuel being faster than thermal neutrons, it is more accurately termed an epithermal reactor than a thermal reactor. It uses supercritical water as the working fluid. [...] SCWRs are basically light water reactors (LWR) operating <b>at</b> <b>higher</b> <b>pressure</b> and temperatures with a direct, once-through heat exchange cycle. As most commonly envisioned, it would operate on a direct cycle, much like a boiling water reactor (BWR), but since it uses supercritical water (not {{to be confused with}} critical mass) as the working fluid, it would have only one water phase present, which makes the supercritical heat exchange method more similar to a pressurized water reactor (PWR). [...] It could operate at much higher temperatures than both current PWRs and BWRs.|$|E
2500|$|The first commercially {{practical}} closed-circuit scuba {{was designed}} and built by the diving engineer Henry Fleuss in 1878, while working for Siebe Gorman in London. His apparatus consisted of a rubber mask connected by a tube to a bag, with (estimated) 50–60% O2 supplied from a copper pressure tank and CO2 chemically absorbed by rope yarn in the bag soaked in a solution of caustic potash. The system allowed use for about three hours. Fleuss tested his device in 1879 by spending an hour submerged in a water tank, then one week later by diving {{to a depth of}} [...] in open water, upon which occasion he was slightly injured when his assistants abruptly pulled him to the surface. The Fleuss apparatus was first used under operational conditions in 1880 by the lead diver on the Severn Tunnel construction project, who was able to travel [...] in the darkness to close several submerged sluice doors in the tunnel; this had defeated the best efforts of hard hat divers due to the danger of their air supply hoses becoming fouled on submerged debris, and the strong water currents in the workings. Fleuss continually improved his apparatus, adding a demand regulator and tanks capable of holding greater amounts of oxygen <b>at</b> <b>higher</b> <b>pressure.</b>|$|E
2500|$|For a limnic {{eruption}} to occur, {{the lake}} must be nearly saturated with gas. [...] In the two known cases, the major component was CO2; however, in Lake Kivu, scientists {{are concerned about}} the concentrations of methane gas as well. [...] This CO2 may come from volcanic gas emitted from under the lake or from decomposition of organic material. [...] Before a lake is saturated, it behaves like an unopened carbonated beverage (soft drink): the CO2 is dissolved in the water. [...] In both the lake and the soft drink, CO2 dissolves much more readily <b>at</b> <b>higher</b> <b>pressure</b> (Henry's law). This is why bubbles in a can of soda form only after the can is opened; the pressure is released and the CO2 comes out of solution. [...] In the case of lakes, the bottom is at a much higher pressure; the deeper it is, the higher the pressure at the bottom. [...] This means that huge amounts of CO2 can be dissolved in large, deep lakes. [...] Also, CO2 dissolves more readily in cooler water, such as that {{at the bottom of a}} lake. [...] A small rise in water temperature can lead to the release of a large amount of CO2.|$|E
