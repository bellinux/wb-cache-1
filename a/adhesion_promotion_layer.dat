40|$|In this paper, the design, {{fabrication}} {{and testing}} of a 3 D printed dry electrode is proposed. 3 D printing represents an authentic breakthrough for the development and mass production of dry medical electrodes. In fact, it allows a fast and low cost production of high precision tridimensional shapes. This technique is reliable and efficient, and facilitates controllability over the whole process. Initially, 3 D capable design software is used to draw the electrode model. The resulting file is simply loaded in a 3 D printer whose resolution is 42 μm on x- and y-axes, and 16 μm on z-axis. The electrode is made by an insulating acrylic-based photopolymer. It consists of 180 conical needles (distance = 250 μm) on a truncated conical base. The metallization process undergoes two steps: sputtering of titanium as <b>adhesion</b> <b>promotion</b> <b>layer</b> and evaporation of gold to lower the impedance and prevent oxidation of the electrode. After electrode characterization, experimental results are presented and compared with planar wet Ag/AgCl electrodes for recording ECG-EEG...|$|E
40|$|Surface {{modification}} of polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) films {{is done by}} exposing the films to a sodium naphthalenide (Na/naphtha) etchant, and esterification of 4, 4 '-azobis(4 -cyanopentanoic acid) (ACP) with the hydroxyl groups covalently linked to the surface, followed by the surface-initiated free radical polymerization of 4 -vinylpyridine (4 VP). The surface elemental composition and topography of the poly(4 -vinylpyridine) (PVP) graft-functionalized PTFE surfaces (PTFE-g-PVP surfaces) were characterized by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), attenuated total reflectance (ATR) FTIR spectroscopy, and atomic force microscopy (AFM). Water contact angles on the pristine PTFE surface and PTFE-g-PVP surfaces were measured. The PVP brushes on the PTFE surface with well-preserved pyridine groups were used not only as the chemisorption sites for the palladium complexes (without the need for prior sensitization by SnCl 2) during the electroless plating of copper, but also as an <b>adhesion</b> <b>promotion</b> <b>layer</b> to enhance the adhesion of the electrolessly deposited copper to the PTFE surfaces. The T-peel adhesion strength of the electrolessly deposited copper to the PVP grafted PTFE (PTFE-g-PVP) surface could reach about 7. 2 N/cm. This adhesion strength was much {{higher than that of}} the electrolessly deposited copper to the pristine or Na/naphtha-treated PTFE surface. Effects of the graft polymerization time and the activation time in the PdCl 2 solution on the T-peel adhesion strength of the electrolessly deposited copper (from the Sn-free process) to the PTFE-g-PVP surface were determined.

40|$|In the {{aircraft}} industry, an increasing demand for <b>adhesion</b> <b>promotion</b> <b>layers</b> for titanium based materials is observed to replace polluting and unhealthy substances. Plasma enhanced {{chemical vapour deposition}} (PECVD) at atmospheric pressure (AP) seems to be favourable for the deposition of thin silica-like layers. In this work, a linearly extended and scalable DC arc plasma source is used for PECVD of silica layers on Ti 6 Al 4 V. The influence of the precursor chemistry is evaluated for HMDSO and TEOS precursors. Using HMDSO, hydrophobic almost stoichiometric SiO 2 coatings with a carbon content of 3 at. -% to 5 at. -% are deposited on the titanium alloy substrate. For TEOS, hydrophilic carbon-free stoichiometric SiO 2 coatings are deposited. The dynamic deposition rate for TEOS is 3 times lower t han that for HMDSO (up to 640 nmm/min). For the intended coating of slightly curved substrates, the film properties and deposition rates are studied for different working distances from 20 mm up to 60 mm. For 60 mm the deposition rate is reduced by a factor 6 compared to 20 mm, also the index of refraction of the film decreases from 1. 45 at 20 mm distance to 1. 39 at 60 mm. With increasing distance, the particle size and concentration on the surface increases and leads to less dense structures than {{in the case of}} shorter distances. The wedge test is used to evaluate the adhesion properties of the layer. The HMDSO-based coatings exhibit a good long-term durability and a high bonding strength comparable to that of the currently used standard pre-treatment, but without the use of harmful subs tances...|$|R
40|$|Objectives: To give an {{overview}} of aspects of silane coupling agents and surface conditioning in dentistry. Methods: Currently, silane coupling agents are used as adhesion promoters. Silanes are effective in enhancing adhesion between resin composite and silica-based ceramics. They do not bond effectively to non-silica based dental restorative materials. Surface conditioning of non-silica based ceramics with silica coating improves the bonding. This current overview {{will focus on the}} silane coupling agents: their properties, limitations in <b>adhesion</b> <b>promotion</b> and the clinical problems with the use of silanes. It will also focus on the current surface conditioning methods as well as new surface conditioning techniques to enhance the bonding through conventional silanization approaches. Results: Several surface conditioning methods are being used clinically to enhance the adhesion of resin composites to non-silica based restorative materials. Other approaches are under investigation. The clinical problem of using silanes in <b>adhesion</b> <b>promotion</b> is the bond degradation over time in oral environment. Significance: The current silane coupling agents are not ideal. The current silane coupling agents can fulfill the minimum requirements in clinical practice to enhance the bonding of resin composite to dental restorative materials. Developments of novel surface conditioning methods and silane coupling agents are required to address the bond durability problem. © 2012 Academy of Dental Materials. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|Materials for new {{applications}} are often created by combining existing polymers into blends or composites. However most polymer pairs {{tend to be}} immiscible leading to weak adhesion and poor mechanical properties, which can outweigh any advantages gained by blending. Adhesion and mechanical properties can be improved in such systems {{by the addition of}} small amounts of suitable block copolymer to the interface. Adhesion is promoted, firstly by a reduction in the interfacial tension, leading directly to an increase in the thermodynamic work of adhesion, and secondly by increasing the interfacial width, leading to more entanglements between polymer chains and hence greater mechanical reinforcement. In some cases, adhesion is further enhanced by covalent bonds between the block copolymer and the homopolymers. As progress towards nanoscale technology continues in many fields, including biomaterials and electronics, a detailed knowledge of the fundamental origins of <b>adhesion</b> <b>promotion</b> is becoming ever more vital in the design of new materials. The purpose of the research presented in this thesis was to examine several important molecular aspects of polymer-polymer <b>adhesion</b> <b>promotion</b> by block copolymers involving rubber-rubber and glass-rubber interfaces. The origins of self-adhesion hysteresis in polydimethylsiloxane elastomers were investigated using the JKR contact mechanics technique. Hysteresis was only observed in extracted elastomers and in self-adhesion experiments, suggesting its origins arose from surface interactions and not bulk viscoelasticity. The hysteresis increased with decreasing cross-linking density of the elastomers. When the platinum catalyst used to synthesize the PDMS elastomers was poisoned the hysteresis disappeared implying that a hydrosilylation reaction across the interface was responsible. The JKR method was also used to investigate the contributions to <b>adhesion</b> <b>promotion</b> by chain pull-out and covalent bonding using polydimethylsiloxane and polybutadiene elastomers in contact with silane terminated poly(styrene-b-dimethylsiloxane), poly(styrene-b-butadiene) and various functional surfaces. No evidence of adhesion enhancement caused by chain interpenetration was observed over a wide range of experimental and molecular parameters. Adhesion was only enhanced when reactions across the interface were possible. Further experiments involving end-tethered PDMS brushes showed that significant adhesion could be obtained but that this could be explained by the occurrence of various chemical reactions. ...|$|R

With different SAM conformation on Cu, the performance in adhesion between Cu/Epoxy was also investigated. Epoxy model was incorporated for predicting the adhesive strength between SAM-modified Cu/Epoxy interface by using MD simulation. The results demonstrated SAM with standing up conformation and higher relative surface coverage gave rise to higher adhesive strength between Cu/Epoxy interface.

The interfacial adhesion has 20 -fold enhancement through the treatment due to improved linkage between copper substrate and epoxy layer by chemisorbed organothiol molecules. The treatment time was greatly reduced by a factor 32 from 16 hours to 30 minutes thanks to the electrical field assisted method without compromising the maximum adhesion strength, which was shown to be in order of 97. 2 Jm- 2. Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations were also carried out for studying the surface coverage effect of Self-assembly Monolayer (SAM) on Cu surface towards adhesion strength between Cuiepoxy interface.

40|$|For {{low cost}} high {{efficiency}} fully plated NiCu contacts on silicon solar cells, a thermal formation of nickel silicide is commonly performed for <b>adhesion</b> <b>promotion.</b> Since {{the results of}} this strategy {{have been found to be}} ambiguous, and as the interface situation is not understood, a microstructural analysis of the metal-silicon interface after thermal annealing of plated nickel layers on silicon solar cells has been carried out. The point of failure upon performing solder and peel testing on sintered contacts has been identified to be at the silicide-nickel interface. Microstructural analysis shows that void formation can be observed at this interface. The mechanisms of silicide and void formation from plated layers on solar cells are studied taking into account different electrolytes and pretreatments. The cavities can be removed by selective nickel etching and replating nickel onto the formed silicide after silicide pretreatment. Excellent adhesion of up to 2. 5 N/mm has been measured, which represents the force of silicon wafer breakage rather than true metal adhesive force...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: The {{longevity}} of silane promoted adhesion of surface conditioned metallic materials {{is of concern}} in dentistry and poses both a functional and esthetic dilemma for the patient and dental professionals. Several methods for surface conditioning exist, but some are employed more frequently in clinical practice.

The primary chemical features in silane treatment will also be presented. Method of Review: The literature regarding silane utilization was systematically selected and 68 cited references published during 1967 - 2005 were reviewed. Technical descriptions of different silica-coating (silicatization) methods are presented and some comparative clinical and in vitro experiences are reported. Some other surface condition methods applied in dental laboratories were also selected for presentation.

First, five functional organosilane monomers (silicon esters), 3 -acryloxypropyltrimethoxysilane, 3 -methacryloxypropyltrimethoxysilane, 3 -glycidoxypropyltrimethoxysilane, tetrakis-(2 -methacryloxyethoxy) silane and bis-[3 -(triethoxysilyl) propyl]tetrasulfide, were diluted to 1 % (v/v) in 95 % ethanol and blended with a non-functional cross-linking silane, bis- 1, 2 -(triethoxysilyl) ethane (1 %). A commercially available pre-activated silane product {{was used as the}} control. After activation by hydrolysis, each primer blend was applied to silica-coated Ti coupons. Stubs of experimental bis-phenol-A-diglycidyldimethacrylate (bis-GMA) -based resin were bonded by photo-polymerization onto the pretreated Ti coupons. Half of the specimens were stored in deionized water for 6 months and half for 12 months. The primer containing 3 -acryloxypropyltrimethoxysilane and bis- 1, 2 -(triethoxysilyl) ethane produced significantly higher shear bond strengths than the control silane and other experimental silane primers after both periods of storage. © 2010 The Author(s). published_or_final_versionSpringer Open Choice, 01 Dec 201...|$|R
40|$|In dentistry, <b>adhesion</b> <b>promotion</b> with 3 - methacryloyloxypropyltrimethoxysilane {{is usually}} sufficient, but its hydrolytic {{stability}} is a continuous concern. The hydrolytic stability of an alternative, 3 -isocyanatopropyltriethoxysilane, was {{compared with that}} of conventional 3 -methacryloyloxypropyltrimethoxysilane. Two silanes, both in 0. 1 and 1. 0 vol-% in ethanol-water, were evaluated in the attachment of an experimental bis-phenol-A-diglycidyldimethacrylate (Bis-GMA) resin to grit-blasted (with two different systems) titanium. Silane hydrolysis was monitored by FTIR spectrometry. Bis-GMA resin was applied and photo-polymerized on titanium. The specimens were thermocycled (6000 cycles, 5 - 55 °C). Surface analysis was carried out with scanning electron microscopy. Statistical analysis (ANOVA) showed that the highest shear bond was achieved with 0. 1 % 3 -isocyanatopropyl- triethoxysilane (12. 5 MPa) with silica-coating, and the lowest with 1. 0 % 3 -methacryloyloxypropyltrimethoxysilane (3. 4 MPa) with aluminacoating. The silane, its concentration, and the grit-blasting method significantly affected the shear bond strength (p < 0. 05). SEM images indicated cohesive failure of bonding, and, in conclusion, 3 -isocyanatopropyltriethoxysilane is a potential coupling agent. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
40|$|Poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) is an {{extensively}} used {{material in}} dentistry {{because of its}} aesthetics, processability, and reparability. However, PMMA is still far from being ideal in fulfilling the mechanical requirements of prosthesis. PMMA-based denture base polymers exhibit low fracture resistance and radiopacity behavior. Efforts to improve the mechanical and radiopacity properties of denture base materials through inclusion of silica-based fillers are ongoing. Although silane-treated siliceous fillers are commonly used, they are not sufficiently strong. They also exhibit cracks, which either cut through the glass fillers or propagate around the filler particles. This defect occurs when the dental composites are placed in aqueous oral environment because of the hydrolytic degradation of silica-based fillers and silane-coupling agents. The clinical problem of using silanes in <b>adhesion</b> <b>promotion</b> is bond degradation over time in oral environment. In addition, silanes do not bond effectively to nonsilica-based dental restorative materials. This review presents titanium-derived fillers as alternatives to siliceous fillers.

40|$|The tumor {{microenvironment}} encompasses several stressful conditions for cancer cells such as hypoxia, oxidative stress and pH alterations. Galectin- 3, a well-studied {{member of the}} beta-galactoside-binding animal family of lectins has been implicated in multiple steps of metastasis as cell-cell and cell-ECM <b>adhesion,</b> <b>promotion</b> of angiogenesis, cell proliferation and resistance to apoptosis. However, both its aberrantly up- and down-regulated expression was observed in several types of cancer. Thus, the mechanisms that regulate galectin- 3 expression in neoplastic settings are not clear. In order to demonstrate the putative role of hypoxia in regulating galectin- 3 expression in canine mammary tumors (CMT), in vitro and in vivo studies were performed. In malignant CMT cells, hypoxia was observed to induce expression of galectin- 3, a phenomenon that was almost completely prevented by catalase treatment of CMT-U 27 cells. Increased galectin- 3 expression was confirmed at the mRNA level. Under hypoxic conditions the expression of galectin- 3 shifts from a predominant nuclear location to cytoplasmic and membrane expressions. In in vivo studies, galectin- 3 was overexpressed in hypoxic areas of primary tumors and well-established metastases. Tumor hypoxia thus up-regulates the expression of galectin- 3, which may in turn increase tumor aggressiveness...|$|R

The evaluation of adhesion is not entirely consistent throughout PV research, which is discussed at first. The adhesion issue of plated NiCu contacts has then been addressed by following two different routes for <b>adhesion</b> <b>promotion.</b> Firstly an “Interim Anneal” route is focussing on controlled silicide formation as a bonding agent and reliably excellent adhesion greater than wafer breakage force is shown independent of surface roughness (above 2 N/mm for measurements on clamped cells and above 4 N/mm for fortified wafers). Secondly a “Post Anneal” route is focussing on creation of high Si surface roughness by ps laser ablation of the ARC and annealing after full metallization. Excellent adhesion above wafer breakage force is demonstrated. Comparisons to different methods of ARC patterning and resulting surface roughness are made. The presented metallization technology is feasible for standard BSF cells and next generation solar cells for both p-type and n-type emitters.

These barriers need also to stop diffusion of harmful products such as Cu from the device into the body. Furthermore, the barrier layers need to be biocompatible, biostable, compatible with all process steps of the package fabrication and sterilization. Parylene is under investigation as candidate barrier material. WVTR tests are performed to characterize diffusion of water through the Parylene layer. Adhesion tests of Parylene-C on various substrates are performed and if needed <b>adhesion</b> <b>promotion</b> treatments are optimized, since good adhesion is crucial for corrosion prevention. Dedicated corrosion tests have shown that 5 um Parylene-C is protecting Cu lines for corrosion at 70 degrees C for at least 170 hours, more testing needs to be performed. Cell culture test have shown that Cu diffusion is not sufficiently stopped by 5 um Parylene-C or -N, a thicker Parylene layer or a combination with other barriers might be essential.

We find that horizontally confining each atom within an impenetrable cylinder increases the melting temperature Tm and causes melting to be less dramatic. The results also suggest that there is a limiting case of there being no transition for a sufficiently small confining cylinder. Vertical excursions of the adsorbate atoms increase at the onset of melting.

The anabolic (growth-promoting) effect of the secreted form of the amyloid- precur-sor protein (sAPP) {{may contribute to the}} state of brain overgrowth implicated in autism and FXS. Our previous report demonstrated that higher plasma sAPP levels associate with more severe symptoms of autism, including aggression. This molecular effect could contribute to intellectual disability due to repression of cell–cell <b>adhesion,</b> <b>promotion</b> of dense, long, thin dendritic spines, and the potential for disorganized brain structure as a result of disrupted neurogenesis andmigra-tion. At the molecular level, APP and FMRP are linked via the metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 (mGluR 5). Specifically, mGluR 5 activation releases FMRP repression of APP mRNA translation and stimulates sAPP secretion. The relatively lower sAPP level in AD may contribute to AD symptoms that significantly contrast with those of FXS and autism. Low sAPP and production of insoluble A would favor a degenerative process, with the brain atrophy seen in AD. Treatment with mGluR antagonists may help repress APP mRNA translation and reduce secretion of sAPP in FXS and perhaps autism. Neurology ® 2011; 76 : 1344 – 1352 GLOSSAR...|$|R

Since mediator-induced neutrophil hyperadhesiveness on plastic tissue culture dishes is invariably accompanied by intense release of lysosomal granule constituents and respiratory burst activation, thus representing a powerful model to investigate neutrophil cytotoxic states, comparative studies with neutrophils suspended in autologous plasma in {{the presence or absence of}} N-formyl-Met-Leu-Phe (2. 5 microM), the most potent adhesion inducer, were performed on different biologic surfaces. On optimally adherent closed monolayers of cultured endothelial cells or fibroblasts we observed poor stimulation of adhesion as well as minimal granule release and hexose monophosphate pathway activation. Functional behavior of neutrophils on single molecular components of basal laminas such as fibronectin and collagen (type IV) coats was intermediate, with positive <b>adhesion</b> <b>promotion</b> but markedly reduced metabolic activation. When tested on endothelial cell-derived extracellular matrices, neutrophils again showed functional nonresponsiveness to N-formyl-Met-Leu-Phe. Scanning electron microscopy revealed an impressive congruency between the degree of cellular spreading and metabolic activation in the presence of N-formyl-Met-Leu-Phe, with maximally flattened neutrophils on plastic vs. nonspread, polarized cells on monolayers. Identical results were obtained by using other adhesion inducers such as complement-activated plasma or endotoxin. Lack of cell injury by N-formyl-Met-Leu-Phe-exposed neutrophils was corroborated by the absence of tracer release from [111 In]tropolonate-labeled endothelium. These results indicate that biologic surfaces possess antiadhesive properties that protect them from cytotoxic damage by stimulated angry phagocytes...|$|R
40|$|During the {{synthesis}} of zirconium Schiff-base polymers {{it became apparent that}} the polymers adhere quite strongly to the silica (glass) vessels in which they were recrystallized from dimethyl sulfoxide solution. This observation inspired the following research:^ A new soluble linear Schiff-base zirconium-containing coordination polymer poly((N,N',N",N"'-tetrasalicylidene- 3, 3 '-diaminobenzidine) -zirconium(IV)) ((Zr(tsdb)) n) has been synthesized via the condensation of 3, 3 '-diaminobenzidine with tetrakis(salicylaldehydato-O,O') zirconium(IV) in dry dimethyl sulfoxide. Molecular weights have been characterized by nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, gel permeation chromatography, and viscosity measurements. A copolymer average degree of polymerization of up to 92 has been obtained by careful stoichiometric control and fractionation. The polymer shows high thermal stability to about 500 ∘C and has a glass transition temperature of about 74 ∘C. An electronic charge-transfer transition occurs at about 400 nm with a molar extinction coefficient of 30, 000 L(mol Zr) - 1 cm- 1. ^ The interface interaction between the polymer and oxides (glass and alumina) has been studied. A series of (Zr(tsdb)) n polymers with different end group ratios were used for the surface coverage studies. Polymers with more zirconium end groups obtain higher surface coverage. The interface bonding, Zr-O-Si, is identified from Fourier-transform infrared at 990 cm- 1. Scribe-stripping tests show adhesion vanishes after the polymers are end-capped. ^ (Zr(tsdb)) n oligomers couple with (±) -β-butyrolactone and stearoyl chloride to produce organic hybrid copolymers. These copolymers have been synthesized for the study of <b>adhesion</b> <b>promotion</b> for polymeric coatings on glass and aluminum substrates. Based on scribe-stripping, indentation debonding, and peel tests, results with films of poly(methyl methacrylate), polybutyrolactone, polythylene, and polypropylene show that adhesion increases when the substrates are pretreated with these hybrid copolymers. ...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVES: Bonding of {{restorative}} {{materials in}} dentistry may be enhanced significantly {{by the use}} of engineered silane blends. Trialkoxy silane esters have the unique property to unite dissimilar materials. Silanization is required when cementing the crown or the abutment on a silica-coated zirconia subgingival implant surface with an organophosphate-resin-composite. In this laboratory study, we report about our latest findings in laboratory experiments on experimental silane primers. MATERIAL AND METHODS: In the <b>adhesion</b> <b>promotion</b> of resin-composites to the zirconia implant surface using four experimental blends, a so-called 'Novel Silane System', consisting of a functional silane (3 -acryloxypropyltrimethoxysilane, 3 -isocyanatopropyltriethoxysilane, 3 -glycidoxypropyltrimethoxysilane and 3 -styrylethyltrimethoxysilane) and a cross-linking silane, bis- 1, 2 -(triethoxysilyl) ethane, were mixed in a water/ethanol solvent system with a pH of 4. 5, and applied onto silica-coated planar zirconia specimens. A resin composite stub (with a bonding area diameter of 2. 0 mm) was cemented using a polypropylene mold. Initial shear bond strengths (baseline values) were measured of specimens after dry storage and after thermo-cycling between 5. 0 +/- 0. 5 degrees C and 55. 0 +/- 0. 5 degrees C. As the control was a dental prehydrolyzed ready-to-use silane product. RESULTS: All the values for shear bond strength test were significantly increased (P > 0. 05) during thermo-cycling. The results showed that the highest shear bond strength was obtained for 3 -glycidoxypropyltrimethoxysilane +bis- 1, 2 -(triethoxysilyl) ethane in both dry and thermo-cycled conditions with stress values of 11. 04 and 14. 89 MPa, respectively. The lowest values were found for the control silane in both dry and thermo-cycled conditions with stress values of 4. 5 and 6. 5 MPa, respectively. CONCLUSION: Silanization with a novel silane system yielded significantly higher shear bond strength than the control silane (a 3 -methacryloxypropyltrimethoxysilane containing). We have introduced a bonding system that might be useful and durable in implant dentistry. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
40|$|Copper-epoxy molding {{compound}} (Cu-EMC) interface {{is known}} to be the weakest joint in the electronic packages, which causes delamination during a reliability test. A prime reason is the lack of adhesion between Cu and the epoxy compound. To solve the problem, a self-assembly monolayer (SAM) is introduced to improve adhesion of copper-epoxy system. Thiols/disulfides, which can effectively deposited on Cu surface, were selected as the SAM to act as surface modifier to Cu substrate. The selection of thiols/disulfides candidate with an appropriate tail group is essential for the adhesion enhancement. To promote adhesion, the SAM structures should be able to form high density covalent bonds with the EMC. This paper focuses on the use of molecular dynamics (MD) simulation to study the covalent bonds effect on the adhesion in Cu-SAM-EMC system. The data is used as a means to select SAM candidates with good interfacial adhesion strength. In this study, MD simulation models of the Cu-SAM-EMC system with covalent bonding and optimized SAM density were built to evaluate the interfacial bonding energy between the EMC and SAM coated substrate. The results show that the interfacial bonding energy changed with different SAM coatings on the Cu substrate. The modelling results were compared with the experimental button shear data. The shear test shows that when Cu substrates have been coated with SAM with amine/amide groups, adhesion increased significantly. A consistent qualitative trend is observed in the results calculated by the MD simulations. The sheared samples, which were analysed by the time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometer techniques, further confirmed the existence of covalent bonds at the interface. This proves that the covalent bonding at the interface is a key mechanism in enhancing the interfacial adhesion. This work illustrates that MD can help in understanding the behavior of bonding of SAM to polymer at the molecular scale. The MD can be a useful tool to select SAM structure for <b>adhesion</b> <b>promotion</b> in a Cu-SAM-EMC system...|$|R
40|$|Thin film {{deposition}} on fluoropolymer webs – both in {{vacuum and}} at atmospheric pressure – faces several critical challenges such as poor mechanical and thermo-mechanical properties – especially low dimensional stability and low elastic modulus, high and textured surface roughness and low adhesion of thin films. This paper discusses {{critical process parameters}} in roll-to-roll processing for both vacuum processes and wet coating processes {{with respect to the}} unique properties of fluoropolymer webs. Reactively sputtered oxide layers as well as wet coated ORMOCER® layers are deposited on ETFE, PVDF and ECTFE webs to form single- and multi-layer permeation barrier systems. The influence of relevant process parameters on the layer adhesion and permeation barrier performance is reviewed. Permeation barrier coatings have been selected as main application for this study, because they are very sensitive to substrate surface irregularities and mechanical damage due to low adhesion, high strain or roll-to-roll processing issues and therefore are a good measure for the quality of the coating on the substrate. Both the wet coated ORMOCER® layers and reactively sputtered zinc-tin oxide (ZTO) layers show surprisingly good adhesion on both ETFE and PVDF surfaces. Both ZTO and – with <b>adhesion</b> <b>promotion</b> treatment – also aluminum oxide (Al 2 O 3) layers have the potential for low water transmission rates (WVTR) below 5 · 10 − 2 g/(m 2 d) at 38 °C/ 90 % r. h. on these substrates. Further reduction of the WVTR is demonstrated with a combination of wet coated ORMOCER® layers and sputtered ZTO layers yielding a WVTR of 1 · 10 − 3 g/(m 2 d) at 38 °C/ 90 % r. h. These values were achieved using adapted process parameters and layer stack designs such as reduced web tension and lower layer thicknesses. The results shown in this paper demonstrate the potential of coated fluoropolymer webs for functionalization of membrane roofs and façades with flexible thin film solar cells; thermal insulation and solar control functionality; flexible thin film electroluminescent and OLED lighting panels as well as electrochromic devices...|$|R
40|$|Internal {{surfaces}} of pharmatechnological or biomedical microfluidic components may be functionalized—i. e., tailored or adapted to fulfill {{one or more}} specific physicochemical functions within a lab-on-chip system—by surface-technological methods selected {{from a number of}} available coating or modification processes. Among various potential functions of a surface, its wetting behavior is of particular importance if two different phases (e. g., water and air, water and oil) are involved during operation of the system. Adhesive properties of internal walls are of major relevance in applications where particulate matter (cells, micro- or nanoparticles) plays a role: It may be necessary to prevent the adhesion of such particles on the surfaces in order to prevent clogging; on the other hand, the adhesion of cells may be aspired on certain parts of the surface. <b>Adhesion</b> <b>promotion</b> may, however, not only be an issue for the operation of an MF device but also for its manufacturing, for example for sealing or bonding processes. Frequently an undesired wall deposition of proteins or other constituents of the fluid has to be prevented by an antifouling coating or a suitable pretreatment of the surface. Coatings or surface modifications generating chemically reactive groups may be utilized to bind small molecules, polymers, biomolecules, or nanoparticles covalently to a surface. Controlling the density of charged functional groups, the ζ potential of a surface can be adjusted in order to influence, e. g., the charge of droplets dispensed from a pipette. While so far mentioned functions of the MF device walls largely depend on their chemical composition close to the interface, specific geometrical and physical characteristics of surfaces and surface coatings may also be desired. Examples are the role of topography and Young’s modulus for the attachment of cells and microorganisms, coatings with specific electrical or optical functions involved in sensing and detection, electrowetting, or electrophoresis, and, last but not least, permeation barriers preventing the leaching of polymer constituents into the fluid or controlling gas transport through a polymer. The present article gives an introduction to surface modification and coating processes which are established or under development in order to attain the above-mentioned surface functions. An emphasis will be laid on special requirements of microfluidic devices to be used with two-phase fluids and particulate matter...|$|R
40|$|Copper is the {{material}} of choice for advanced interconnects due to its low electrical resistance and superior electromigration resistance. However, as feature sizes are reduced in successive generations, the difficulty of filling high aspect ratio feature increases rapidly. Supercritical Fluid Deposition (SFD) is a promising hybrid technique for single step conformal metal deposition that is extendable to sub- 45 nm device structures. The approach involves the reduction of organometallic compounds in supercritical media to yield high purity conformal films. High precursor concentration and low viscosity in supercritical fluids prevent mass transport limitations and promote excellent step coverage of very narrow features. The absence of surface tension in the supercritical fluids enables the complete wetting of complex surfaces. Moreover, since the effluent of the SFD often contains only CO 2, hydrocarbons, and H 2, this technique offers considerable environmental advantages. ^ In this work, a recirculating equilibrium system is presented for measuring organometallic compounds solubilities in supercritical carbon dioxide. Solubility of nickelocene, bis(2, 2, 6, 6 -tetramethyl- 3, 5 -heptanedionate) copper, [Cu(tmhd) 2], and bis(2, 2, 7 -trimethyloctane- 3, 5 -dionato) copper, [Cu(tmod) 2], were obtained at different temperatures and pressures. The solubility results confirm high precursor concentrations, a distinct advantage in SFD process over vapor phase metallization techniques. ^ Furthermore, the versatility and effectiveness of the SFD process is demonstrated by employing novel precursors for Cu deposition. Different type of reaction chemistries were tested and compared to demonstrate the SFD process for Cu metallization. ^ Moreover, a revolutionary interfacial <b>adhesion</b> <b>promotion</b> method was developed and tested for Cu metallization. A thin poly(acrylic acid) layer (3. 5 nm) was found to dramatically enhance the interfacial adhesion of Cu films to substrates with various barrier layers, including TaN, TiN and Ta. ^ While the utility of SFD for Cu metallization has been well demonstrated, the kinetic pathways and the mechanism of the process have not previously been studied in detail. In this dissertation, the first kinetic study of Cu metallization by hydrogen reduction of Cu(tmod) 2 in supercritical carbon dioxide is reported. Film deposition rates in the temperature range of 220 °C to 270 °C, {{as a function of}} the relevant experimental parameters including precursor and H 2 concentration, by-product concentration, and system pressure, were investigated. The implication of these results for mechanistic pathways for Cu deposition in CO 2 is discussed. A rate expression for film growth rate in terms of system control parameters is proposed. ...|$|R

The significant enhancement is ascribed to its excellent morphology, high conductivity and optical properties, fast charge transfer, and large recombination resistance. Thus, a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 17.03 % has been achieved for the solar cells based on c-TBOT.|$|R
