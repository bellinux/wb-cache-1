On the other hand, the Soviet Military Administration looked, as previously shown, for machinery and equipment. It is obvious that, at the beginning, they underestimated the value of patents, trademarks and blueprints.

50|$|The {{plaintiff}} {{starts a}} civil case by filing a summons, and generally a complaint, with the clerk of circuit court and paying a filing fee. A summons provides the defendant notice that a suit has been filed against him or her and notifies the defendant {{that he or she}} must answer the complaint. The complaint sets forth the plaintiff’s allegations against the defendant. It must contain a short and plain statement of the plaintiff’s claim, identify the events out of which the claim arises, and demand relief to satisfy the plaintiff’s claim. The plaintiff must serve an <b>authenticated</b> <b>copy</b> of the summons and complaint on the defendant. The favored method for serving the defendant is to personally hand a copy of the summons to him or her. Alternatively, the server may hand the summons to another responsible adult at the defendant’s residence or, in some cases, it is sufficient for the plaintiff to publish the summons in a newspaper and send it to the defendant’s address. Any adult who is not a party to the lawsuit may serve the summons. The person who serves the summons must sign the summons at the time of service and note the date, time, place, and manner of service and upon whom the summons is served. The plaintiff then files proof of service with the court.|$|E

40|$|The author {{describes}} {{the limits of}} the right to defence in the context of evidence by testimony of an anonymous witness. In practice, the introduction of the evidence by testimony of an anonymous witness to the Polish criminal system means that the legislator decides to limit the procedural rights of the defendant. The author notices the need to balance the defendant’s interest and right to defence against the witness’s right to personal security and the resulting prohibition of such execution of the right to defence that would lead to the violation of the fair interest of the other trial participants. Having analyzed the jurisprudence of the European Court of Human Rights the author comes to the conclusion that also {{in the light of the}} Court’s verdicts the introduction of an anonymous witness to the criminal procedure does not mean a breach of the right to defence. The author analyses some particular procedural rights of the defendant related to the evidence by testimony of an anonymous witness and shows to what degree these rights are modified in that situation. The author claims that whenever the threat to the witness’s life, freedom or health is more real and probable, greater limitations to the right to defence shall be accepted. Nevertheless, the procedure of examination of evidence should meet the standards following from procedural rules. The right to defence will be exercised in a way that does not breach the fairness of the trial if at least the following conditions are met: defendant and/or his counsel shall participate in the hearing of anonymous witness during the trial; defendant and/or his counsel shall be allowed to formulate questions to such a witness; they shall have the right to receive answers to the questions concerning the subject matter of the testimony, not the witness himself; questions not answered by the witness shall be included in the protocol of the trial and in its <b>authenticated</b> <b>copy.</b> The elementary principle to be observed is that, in every single situation, the parties have to compensate for all acceptable and admissible deviations from procedural rules and for the right to defence in particular. In such a situation, the compensation should broaden the rights of the defence and enable the exercise of those rights in practice...|$|E

The thesis is systematically structured into six chapters, each of them presenting different aspects of the notarial job. First chapter is introductory. Chapter Two gives an outline of the development of the legal status of the notaries begining in the ancient Rome until the legal regulation these days.

40|$|With a {{huge amount}} of printed {{documents}} nowadays, identifying their source is useful for criminal investigations and also to <b>authenticate</b> digital <b>copies</b> of a document. In this paper, we propose novel techniques for laser printer attribution. Our solutions do not need very high resolution scanning of the investigated document and explore the multidirectional, multiscale and low-level gradient texture patterns yielded by printing devices. The main contributions of this work are: (1) the description of printed areas using multidirectional and multiscale co-occurring texture patterns; (2) description of texture on low-level gradient areas by a convolution texture gradient filter that emphasizes textures in specific transition areas and (3) the analysis of printer patterns in segments of interest, which we call frames, instead of whole documents or only printed letters. We show by experiments in a well documented dataset that the proposed methods outperform techniques described in the literature and present near-perfect classification accuracy being very promising for deployment in real-world forensic investigations.

Justice Stephen Johnson Field later commented that Lee’s work was so {{defective}} that the judges sought to have the new law repealed and the appointing authority returned to the court. As {{a result of this}} dispute, Lee held bitter feelings toward the judges that he vented during a conversation with the clerk of the court, a Mr. Fairfax. An altercation ensued in which Lee drew his sword cane, and ran it into Fairfax’s body twice, inflicting a serious wound in the chest just above the heart. Fairfax drew his pistol in self-defense as Lee raised his sword for a third thrust but, let the pistol drop, restrained by the thought of Lee’s wife and children. During the American Civil War he was given a commission as a Lt. Colonel of 4th Infantry California Volunteers in 1861. He first served at Benecia, and then at San Pedro at Camp Drum.

Consequently, there has been an increasing demand to develop digital watermarking techniques which can be applied to both electronic and printed images (and documents) that can be <b>authenticated,</b> prevent unauthorized <b>copying</b> and withstand abuse and degradation. In this paper, a new approach to digital watermarking is presented and a range of possible applications are considered. The process is defined by using concepts and techniques borrowed from Cryptography. It is based on computing a 2 ̆ 7 scramble image 2 ̆ 7 by diffusing a watermark image with a noise field (a cipher). The cover image (covertext) is then introduced using a simple additive process (confusion). The watermark is subsequently recovered by removing the covertext and then correlating the output with the original (key dependent) noise field. For covert encryption, this approach provides the user with a method of hiding ciphertext (the scrambled image) in a host image before the transmission of the data. With regard to document authentication, a diffusion only or 2 ̆ 7 texture coding 2 ̆ 7 approach that is robust {{to a wide variety of}} attacks including geometric attacks, crumpling and print/scan attacks are considered...|$|R
40|$|Mnogi arhivski fondovi Državnog arhiva u Dubrovniku svjedoče o specifičnim odnosima i čestim kontaktima Dubrovčana i Osmanskog Carstva, od vrha do dna hijerarhije osmanske vlasti. Među tim arhivskim fondovima posebno se ističe fond osmanskih spisa nazvan Acta Turcarum, koji je nastao isključivo na temelju osmansko-dubrovačkih odnosa. Cilj ovog rada je rekonstrukcija sudbine osmanskih spisa tijekom gotovo 500 godina, to jest od vremena Dubrovačke Republike, kada su se čuvali u Turskoj kancelariji, do danas, kada su koncentrirani u fondu Državnog arhiva u Dubrovniku. This article aims to {{reconstruct}} {{the fate of the}} Ottoman documents over a period of five centuries, from the days of the Dubrovnik Republic when they were kept at the Turkish chancellery to their present location—the Acta Turcarum series of the State Archives of Dubrovnik. Prior to the arrival of the Osmanlis, Ragusan state correspondence with its neighbours was among the responsibilities of the Slavic chancellery. But with the Ottoman Empire at its borders, a Turkish chancellery developed within the former. Chancellery clerks, the co-called dragomans (translators for the Ottoman language), were in charge of the Ottoman documents which they translated into Croatian and Italian, but were of equal help to the Ragusan government officials by translating their letters to various Ottoman dignitaries into Turkish. In addition, the dragomans were responsible for the documents’ keeping, classifying and inventories. Thanks to their zeal, several inventories have been preserved. The authorities of the Dubrovnik Republic showed great concern for the archiving of the state chancellery papers. Poor fate, however, befell the archival documents {{after the fall of the}} Republic as, due to the lack of care, many of them were stolen, destroyed or lost, Ottoman documents in particular. It is unlikely that we shall ever know the exact number or at least a rough estimate of the Ottoman documents once housed by the archives, as well as how many were lost through and after the Republic period. A glance at defter (register) no. 3 of the Archives of the Government Presidency of the Republic of Turkey in Istanbul containing the records of all the Sultan papers issued to the Ragusans in the period 1627 - 1647 clearly shows that as many as 40 % of the original documents from the Dubrovnik Archives have not survived. Owing to its persistent efforts, Dubrovnik Archives managed to reclaim the materials that had been taken to Vienna, Zadar and Belgrade in the nineteenth and twentieth century. As for about 50 books from the old Turkish chancellery, they still adorn the shelves of the Austrian National Library (Österreichische Nationalbibliothek). The inventories of the Ottoman papers reveal that the collection of the most beautifully decorated documents—ahdnama (bilateral Raguso-Ottoman agreement confirmed by each new sultan) and hatt-ı humayun (containing the sultan’s order on the obeyance of his decision written in his own hand (“Be it carried out according to my order. ”) —had the least chance of surviving, probably because of their artistic appeal. This collection today contains only three original ahdname, that of Sultan Murad III, Mehmed III and Mehmed IV and only eight of the hatt-ı humayun. The trials notwithstanding, the Acta Turcarum series of the State Archives of Dubrovnik today files about 15, 000 Ottoman documents, originals mainly, but also <b>authenticated</b> and unauthenticated <b>copies</b> written in the Ottoman language, as well as Croatian and Italian translations. The series also contains a smaller number of documents written in Arabic, Hebrew and Armenian, and in terms of script in bosančica, Cyrillic and Latin. The oldest Ottoman document dates from 1458 —a firman (receipt) issued by Sultan Mehmed II on the Ragusan payment of the harac (tribute). Ottoman documents can mainly be classified as the Sultan papers (firmans, a smaller number of patents - berat, and the earlier-mentioned rare copies of ahdnama and hatt-ı humayun), buyrultu (orders generally issued by the Bosnian beylerbeys), huccet, ilam, arz and fetve (legal documents), in addition to a larger correspondence collection. In order to make the Ottoman documents more accessible, in 2002 the State Archives of Dubrovnik set up a large project to classify, catalogue and publish them. The first phase was completed by the publishing of the documents of the Ottoman sultans in 2005. Forthcoming is the analysis of the buyrultu papers issued by the beylerbeys of Bosnia which, no doubt, will cast an additional light on the relations between the Bosnian court and the Dubrovnik Republic...|$|R
