5|$|Microsoft Family Safety is {{replaced}} by Microsoft Family, <b>a</b> <b>parental</b> controls system that applies across Windows platforms and Microsoft online services. Users can create a designated family, and monitor and restrict the actions of users designated as children, such as access to websites, enforcing age ratings on Windows Store purchases, and other restrictions. The service can also send weekly e-mail reports to parents detailing a child's computer usage. Unlike previous versions of Windows, child accounts in a family must {{be associated with a}} Microsoft accountwhich allows these settings to apply across all Windows 10 devices that a particular child is using.|$|E
5|$|Shepherd {{satellites}} {{are small}} moons that orbit within, or just beyond, a planet's ring system. They {{have the effect}} of sculpting the rings: giving them sharp edges, and creating gaps between them. Saturn's shepherd moons are Pan (Encke gap), Daphnis (Keeler gap), Atlas (A Ring), Prometheus (F Ring) and Pandora (F Ring). These moons together with co-orbitals (see below) probably formed as a result of accretion of the friable ring material on preexisting denser cores. The cores with sizes from one-third to one-half the present day moons may be themselves collisional shards formed when <b>a</b> <b>parental</b> satellite of the rings disintegrated.|$|E

5|$|The Complete Studio Albums (1983–2008) is a box set by American singer-songwriter Madonna. It was {{released}} by Warner Bros. Records on March 26, 2012, {{to coincide with the}} release of her twelfth studio album, MDNA. The eleven-disc box set {{was released}} in Europe and Japan, and included all of Madonna's studio albums from the years 1983 to 2008. The album artwork consisted of a collage of the album covers, housed in a gold box, it also included <b>a</b> <b>Parental</b> Advisory sticker due to the original version of the albums Erotica (1992) and American Life (2003). On the same date, Warner Bros. released and reprinted another box set titled Madonna: Original Album Series which included five discs.|$|E
5|$|The World Health Organisation (WHO) {{estimates}} that 35% {{of women in}} the world have experienced physical or sexual violence over their lifetime and that the commonest situation is intimate partner violence. 30% of women in relationships report such experience, and 38% of murders of women are due to intimate partners. These figures may be as high as 70% in some regions. Risk factors include low educational achievement, <b>a</b> <b>parental</b> experience of violence, childhood abuse, gender inequality and cultural attitudes that allow violence to be considered more acceptable.|$|E

At school’s end, he had become Edward W. Said—a polyglot intellectual (fluent in English, French, and Arabic) who had earned a Bachelor of Arts (1957) degree at Princeton University, and Master of Arts (1960) and Doctor of Philosophy (1964) degrees in English Literature from Harvard University.|$|E

5|$|TNA {{announced}} in a January24, 2005, press release that {{they planned to}} host a PPV titled Lockdown on April24, 2005 at the TNA Impact! Zone in Orlando, Florida. In late-February 2005, In Demand ran a preview and stated {{that there would be}} two steel cage matches held at Lockdown. A Six Man Tag Team match that featured Sean Waltman was thrown around prior to the event. TNA created a section for the event on their official website before it started. On the April8, 2005 episode of TNA's television program TNA Impact!, Director of Authority (DOA) Dusty Rhodes announced that all matches at Lockdown would be held inside a six sided steel structure known as the Six Sides of Steel. TNA followed up with a press release through their website that confirmed this. TNA issued <b>a</b> <b>parental</b> advisory {{a few days after the}} announcement due to violence associated with steel cage matches. A thirty-minute pre-show was planned before the spectacle that featured a Three Way Tag Team match between 3Live Kru (Ron Killings and Konnan), David Young and Lex Lovett, and The Naturals (Andy Douglas and Chase Stevens).|$|E
5|$|The Family Edition, {{like the}} prior version, {{includes}} parental controls {{and the information}} filtering feature. Parental controls come {{with a list of}} objectionable sites, separated into 32 categories. The list is updated every two weeks by Norton LiveUpdate. Using the list alone, Norton only blocks sites present on the list. Consequently, Norton may not block sites until the next update. Parents can customize the list, adding or removing sites. A list of allowed sites can be created to restrict children to those specific sites. This version uses application blocking rather than protocol or port filtering to control Internet access. Children can be restricted in what applications they used to access the Internet. <b>A</b> <b>parental</b> controls profile can be set up for each child, and settings can be automatically configured based on their age group, whether they be a child, teenager, adult, or administrator. Internet usage and violations are noted in a report presented to parents. PC Magazine found that enabling parental controls added a minute to a computer's boot time.|$|E
25|$|When it is {{impossible}} to find the primitive or primary magma composition, it is often useful to attempt to identify <b>a</b> <b>parental</b> melt. <b>A</b> <b>parental</b> melt is a magma composition from which the observed range of magma chemistries has been derived by the processes of igneous differentiation. It need not be a primitive melt.|$|E

25|$|The {{government}} {{claimed that}} non-denominational, mandatory schooling would improve {{access to education}} for New Brunswick's children. However, opponents of the legislation claimed that sole responsibility {{for the education of}} children lay with parents, and they resented government interference in what they saw as <b>a</b> <b>parental</b> duty through the imposition of mandatory schooling. Opponents of the legislation were primarily religious organisations including the Anglican Church and the Roman Catholic Church.|$|E

25|$|According to the IFPI, The Best Damn Thing was {{the fourth}} top-selling album {{worldwide}} and Sony BMG's top-selling album of 2007 with sales of over 5 million copies worldwide.

25|$|There is {{a setting}} in each member's account {{allowing}} {{the user to}} censor songs with explicit lyrics. The censoring option applies exclusively to song versions from albums with <b>a</b> <b>Parental</b> Advisory label, as other songs with censored versions will have that version played. An example is the song Jet Airliner by the Steve Miller Band, which had one word censored for radio play. With explicit lyrics off, that version will play, because the album {{did not have a}} PA label.|$|E

25|$|However, it is {{important}} to note that recombination frequency tends to underestimate the distance between two linked genes. This is because as the two genes are located farther apart, the chance of double or even number of crossovers between them also increases. Double or even number of crossovers between the two genes results in them being cosegregated to the same gamete, yielding <b>a</b> <b>parental</b> progeny instead of the expected recombinant progeny. As mentioned above, the Kosambi and Haldane transformations attempt to correct for multiple crossovers.|$|E
25|$|An Act of January 1984 {{asserted}} a {{right for}} all parents {{to benefit from}} <b>a</b> <b>parental</b> leave of absence for childrearing, providing that they have one year’s seniority. This legislation also allowed parents (under the same conditions) to request part-time work and to shift freely between part-time work and parental leave. In 1982, the law governing the age of consent for homosexual activity was reduced from 18 to 15 years to match the age of consent for heterosexual activity. For those with disabilities, a 1982 law on urban transport reform stated that special measures {{must be taken to}} accommodate the special needs of people with limited mobility. A law passed on 9 July 1984 provided that a worker with at least two years' service must receive a redundancy payment based on gross earnings prior to termination of the work contract. The law further provided that workers aged 60 or above who voluntarily left the firm would receive a retirement severance grant.|$|E
