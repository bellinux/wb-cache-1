The impact on the Native Americans was far higher, however. So many were killed, fled, or shipped off as slaves that the entire Native American population of New England fell by sixty to eighty percent.|$|E
5|$|After {{aftershocks}} {{from the}} quake had concluded, examination took place, producing a focal {{solution to the}} small events. Movement of these shocks {{was similar to that}} of previous earthquakes around the Azores. For these earthquakes, scientists had determined that the conjugate nodal plane was responsible, seeing shearing on the right-lateral (dextral) side. All faulting in this area is strike-slip-oriented, and on <b>a</b> <b>rather</b> <b>large</b> scale. Because of this research, information now points towards Azores volcanism being controlled by earthquake movement.|$|E
5|$|Hilda {{gradually}} weakened over cool waters but maintained <b>a</b> <b>rather</b> <b>large</b> {{level of}} circulation. This caused its dissipation to be slower than normal. Tropical Depression Hilda dissipated on August 14. It large remnant circulation continued northwards and eventually passed over California. There were no casualties or damages attributed to this tropical cyclone. Hilda's remnants caused rain {{as far north}} as San Francisco.|$|E

5|$|In America, {{he again}} tried {{his hand at}} journalism, but a brief stint {{as editor of the}} New Yorker Yiddishe Ilustrirte Zaitung {{resulted}} only in getting the paper suspended and landing himself <b>a</b> <b>rather</b> <b>large</b> fine. On March 31, 1905, he recited poetry at a benefit performance at Cooper Union to raise a pension for Yiddish poet Eliakum Zunser, even worse off than himself because he had found himself unable to write since coming to America in 1889. Shortly afterwards, he met a group of young people who had a Hebrew language association at the Dr. Herzl Zion Club, and wrote a Hebrew-language play David ba-Milchama (David in the War), which they performed in March 1906, the first Hebrew-language play to be performed in America. Repeat performances in March 1907 and April 1908 drew successively larger crowds.|$|E
5|$|The first naturalists who {{investigated}} Megalosaurus mistook it for {{a gigantic}} lizard of twenty metres length. In 1842, Owen concluded {{that it was no}} longer than nine metres, standing on upright legs. He still thought it was a quadruped, though. Modern scientists, by comparing Megalosaurus with its direct relatives in the Megalosauridae, were able to obtain a more accurate picture. Megalosaurus was about seven metres long, weighing about 1.1 tonnes. It was bipedal, walking on stout hindlimbs, its horizontal torso balanced by a horizontal tail. Its forelimbs were short, though very robust. Megalosaurus had <b>a</b> <b>rather</b> <b>large</b> head, equipped with long curved teeth. It was generally a robust and heavily muscled animal.|$|E
5|$|Kepler-11f is, at 2.3 {{times the}} mass of Earth, the least massive of the six planets {{discovered}} in the orbit of Kepler-11, although the planet's mass may range from 1.1 to 4.5, or from approximately that of Earth's mass to that of Kepler-10b, <b>a</b> <b>rather</b> <b>large</b> confidence interval. Its radius is the second smallest of the six planets discovered in the system at 2.61 times the radius of Earth. Kepler-11f has a density of about 0.7g/cm3, {{comparable to that of}} the Solar System's least dense planet, Saturn. Kepler-11f is the fifth planet from Kepler-11, orbiting its host star every 46.68876 days at a distance of 0.25 AU. Its orbital eccentricity is unknown. In comparison, Mercury orbits the Sun every 87.97 days at a distance of 0.387 AU. Kepler-11f has an orbital inclination of 89.4°; it can be seen almost edge-on with respect to Earth. Its surface equilibrium temperature is 544 K, over twice the surface equilibrium temperature of Earth and about two-thirds the surface temperature of Venus.|$|E

There is some faint whitish ochreous speckling on the wing-surface. The hindwings are dark grey.|$|R
50|$|Burnham Overy is a {{civil parish}} on the north coast of Norfolk, England. In modern times a {{distinction}} is often made between the two settlements of Burnham Overy Town, the original village adjacent to the parish church and now reduced {{to a handful of}} houses, and Burnham Overy Staithe, <b>a</b> <b>rather</b> <b>larger</b> hamlet about 1 mile (2 km) away and next to the creek-side harbour.|$|R

25|$|It is {{believed}} {{that the system is}} one of the oldest elements concerning the pilot whale hunt.

50|$|Like other red colobus monkeys, Pennant's red colobus {{lives in}} troops which may consist of twelve to eighty {{individuals}} occupying a territory of 25 to 150 hectares. The troops have several males and <b>a</b> <b>rather</b> <b>larger</b> number of females and juveniles. They {{move through the}} canopy with agility, leaping {{from tree to tree}} and making use of the elasticity of the branches. The gestation period is probably about five months before a single infant is born.|$|R
25|$|While solar {{photovoltaic}} (PV) cells are promising for clean energy production, their deployment is hindered by production costs, material availability, and toxicity. Data required to investigate their impact are sometimes affected by <b>a</b> <b>rather</b> <b>large</b> amount of uncertainty.

60|$|Many {{flowers on}} this Hibiscus were crossed with pollen from a {{distinct}} plant, {{and many others}} were self-fertilised. <b>A</b> <b>rather</b> <b>larger</b> proportional number of the crossed than of the self-fertilised flowers yielded capsules, and the crossed capsules contained rather more seeds. The self-fertilised seeds were a little heavier than {{an equal number of}} the crossed seeds, but they germinated badly, and I raised only four plants of each lot. In three out of the four pots, the crossed plants flowered first.|$|R

25|$|Traditional Scanian {{architecture}} {{is shaped by}} the limited availability of wood; it incorporates different applications of the building technique called half-timbering. In the cities, the infill of the façades consisted of bricks, whereas the country-side half-timbered houses had infill made of clay and straw. Unlike many other Scanian towns, the town of Ystad has managed to preserve <b>a</b> <b>rather</b> <b>large</b> core of its half-timbered architecture in the city center—over 300 half-timbered houses still exist today. Many of the houses in Ystad {{were built in the}} renaissance style that was common in the entire Øresund Region, and which has also been preserved in Elsinore (Helsingør). Among Ystad's half-timbered houses is the oldest such building in Scandinavia, Pilgrändshuset from 1480.|$|E
25|$|The idea is {{that these}} groups have a {{centralizer}} of an involution with a component that is a smaller quasisimple group, which can be assumed to be already known by induction. So to classify these groups one takes every central extension of every known finite simple group, and finds all simple groups with a centralizer of involution with this as a component. This gives <b>a</b> <b>rather</b> <b>large</b> number of different cases to check: there are not only 26 sporadic groups and 16 families of groups of Lie type and the alternating groups, but also many of the groups of small rank or over small fields behave differently from the general case {{and have to be}} treated separately, and the groups of Lie type of even and odd characteristic are also quite different.|$|E
25|$|Although {{converts}} to Islam made up roughly 10% {{of the native}} population – {{most of the people}} living under Umayyad rule were not Muslim – this percent was significant due to the very small number of Arabs. Gradually, the non-Arab Muslims outnumbered the Arab Muslims, causing alarm among the Arab nobility. Socially, this posed a problem as the Umayyads viewed Islam as the property of the aristocratic Arab families. There was <b>a</b> <b>rather</b> <b>large</b> financial problem posed to the Umayyad system as well. If the new {{converts to}} Islam from non-Arab peoples stopped paying the jizya tax stipulated by the Qur'an for non-Muslims, the empire would go bankrupt. This lack of civil and political rights eventually led the non-Arab Muslims to support the Abbasids, despite the latter also being Arab.|$|E
60|$|They were {{watching}} Seymour's pile up an immense score against a scratch team got up {{by one of}} the masters. The first round of the competition was over.

Templar's were rather stronger than the School House, and Donaldson's had beaten them by <b>a</b> <b>rather</b> <b>larger</b> score than that which Seymour's had run up in their match. But neither Trevor nor Clowes was inclined to draw any augury from this. Seymour's had taken things easily after half-time; Donaldson's had kept going hard all through.|$|R
50|$|The palm is an {{obsolete}} anthropic unit of length, originally {{based on}} {{the width of the}} human palm and then variously standardized. The same name is also used for <b>a</b> second, <b>rather</b> <b>larger</b> unit {{based on the}} length of the human hand.|$|R

25|$|The short, very {{flattened}} tail measures 6779% {{as long as}} {{the disc}} and terminates in a short, deep, leaf-shaped caudal fin. A lateral skin fold runs along the each side of the tail, which is most obvious in juveniles. The upper surface of the tail bears <b>a</b> <b>rather</b> <b>large</b> dorsal fin followed by a serrated stinging spine. The skin entirely lacks dermal denticles. The dorsal coloration of this species is distinctive, consisting of a yellowish background with numerous large, dark brown rings surrounding light-colored spots, that may be separated from each other by a network of fine pale lines (particularly {{at the center of the}} disc) to give the impression of a mosaic. The rings become smaller and less well-defined towards the margins of the disc. The dorsal and caudal fins are light in adults and dark with nearly black margins in juveniles.|$|E
25|$|In later October 2006, a cut-off extratropical cyclone {{over the}} central north Pacific moved over {{an area of}} ocean with sea surface {{temperatures}} as high as 2 °C above normal, at 16– 18°C (60.8– 64.4°F), and stalled there for two days. By October 31, the system had acquired convection, a warmer-than-normal core, and an eye-like feature. During this time it had moved east, then northeast, and then northwest. On November 1, the system reached its peak intensity, and had estimated winds of 100km/h (60mph) and its most developed convection. After that, it slowly weakened, looped counter-clockwise, and headed east towards {{the west coast of}} North America. This system's center of circulation passed south of observation buoy 46637 on November 1. The buoy's lowest pressure reading was 989mb/hPa. Other buoys indicated that <b>a</b> <b>rather</b> <b>large</b> area of low pressure was associated with the system. Buoy 46637 was not at the system's center of circulation, so it is possible that this system had a lower minimum pressure than was actually measured. On November 2, wind shear started taking its toll, and all convection was gone by the next day, when it was located roughly 520mi (840km) off the coast of Oregon. On November 3, the storm made landfall on the Olympic Peninsula in the State of Washington, bringing tropical storm-like conditions to the Pacific Northwest, including sustained winds at 40 mph and wind gusts up to 60 mph. Following its landfall, the storm rapidly weakened and dissipated on the next day.|$|E

50|$|The term monumental {{sculpture}} {{is often}} used in art history and criticism, but not always consistently. It combines two concepts, one of function, and one of size, and may include an element of a third more subjective concept. It {{is often used}} for all sculptures that are large. Human figures that are perhaps half life-size or above would usually be considered monumental in this sense by art historians, although in contemporary art <b>a</b> <b>rather</b> <b>larger</b> overall scale is implied. Monumental sculpture is therefore distinguished from small portable figurines, small metal or ivory reliefs, diptychs and the like.|$|R

Three workers were killed, and <b>a</b> <b>rather</b> <b>larger</b> number of soldiers died of the Spanish flu during mobilization. In 1932, the army was called to suppress an anti-fascist demonstration in Geneva. The troops shot dead 13 demonstrators, wounding another 65. This incident long damaged the army's reputation, leading to persistent calls for its abolition among left-wing politicians. In both the 1918 and the 1932 incidents, the troops deployed were consciously selected from rural regions such as the Berner Oberland, fanning the enmity between the traditionally conservative rural population and the urban working class.|$|R
