By 1947, Skelton's musical conductor was David Rose, who {{would go on to}} television with him; he had worked with Rose during his time in the army and wanted Rose to join him on the radio show when it went back on the air.|$|E
500|$|Skipper W was a 1945 sorrel {{stallion}} bred by H. J. Wiescamp of Alamosa, Colorado. Sired by Nick Shoemaker, {{whose father}} was Nick sired by Shiek P-11, Skipper W was out of Hired Girl, a daughter of Cowboy P-12. His second dam, or maternal grandmother, was Leche, who was also fathered by Nick by Shiek P-11. The colt was named Skipper W because, as Wiescamp related:I had another good stud colt born {{around the same time}} as Skipper. He was a palomino sired by Gold Mount and out of Slipalong Wiescamp. That was also the year that the good movie, Showboat, came out and I named the little yellow colt after that picture. Anyway, I had Hired Girl up in a corral and, after she foaled, I told <b>a</b> <b>fellow</b> <b>who</b> was working for me to disinfect the naval on the colt [...] After the man did that, the colt got up and turned around and kicked him 'cause it smarted. I said to that fellow, [...] "Look at that, he already knows he's the boss! I've got a showboat, and every boat needs a skipper, so that's what I'm going to name him– Skipper." [...] I added the W for Wiescamp.|$|E
500|$|A {{turning point}} in Sellers's {{flailing}} career came in 1974, when he teamed up with Blake Edwards to make The Return of the Pink Panther, starring alongside Christopher Plummer, Herbert Lom and Catherine Schell. The film was shot on a budget of £3 million and earned $33 million {{at the box office}} upon release in May 1975, reinvigorating Sellers's career as an A-list film star and restoring his millionaire status. The film earned Sellers a nomination for the Best Actor– Musical or Comedy award at the 33rd Golden Globe Awards. In 1976, he followed it with The Pink Panther Strikes Again. During the filming from February to June 1976, the already fraught relationship between Sellers and Blake Edwards had seriously deteriorated. Edwards says of the actor's mental state at the time of The Pink Panther Strikes Again, [...] "If you went to an asylum and you described the first inmate you saw, that's what Peter had become. He was certifiable." [...] With declining physical health, Sellers could at times be unbearable on set. His behaviour was regarded as unprofessional and childish, and he frequently threw tantrums, often threatening to abandon projects. Peter Evans mentioned that Sellers was a [...] "volatile and perplexing character [...] left a trail of misery in his private life". He also noted that Sellers had a [...] "compulsive personality and [...] an eccentric hypochondriac" [...] who became addicted to various medicines aside from his recreational drug habits during this period. His difficult behaviour during productions was widely reported and made it more difficult for Sellers to get employment in the industry {{at a time when he}} most needed the work. Despite Sellers's deep personal problems, The Pink Panther Strikes Again was well received critically. Vincent Canby of The New York Times said of Sellers in the film, [...] "There is, too, something most winningly seedy about Mr. Sellers' Clouseau, <b>a</b> <b>fellow</b> <b>who,</b> when he attempts to tear off his clothes in the heat of passion, gets tangled up in his necktie, and who, when he masquerades—for reasons never gone into—as Quasimodo, overinflates his hump with helium." [...] Sellers's performance earned him a further nomination at the 34th Golden Globe Awards.|$|E

2500|$|Prince Oberyn Martell, nicknamed [...] "The Red Viper", {{is played}} by Chilean-American actor Pedro Pascal. [...] "This was a tough one", said showrunners David Benioff and Dan Weiss about the casting. [...] "The Red Viper is sexy and charming, yet believably dangerous; {{intensely}} likable, yet driven by hate. The boys love him, the girls love him, and he loves them all back. Unless your last name is Lannister. We found <b>a</b> <b>fellow</b> <b>who</b> can handle the job description and make it seem effortless. He wasn't easy to find and he won't be easy to stop". Martin commented on the casting by saying: [...] "I wasn't present for Pedro Pascal's audition, but I understand that he really killed it with his reading. And since his casting was announced, the producer of another TV show on which he appeared recently has written me to say how terrific Pascal is, and to congratulate us on the casting. So I suspect that he {{will turn out to}} be a wonderful Red Viper". Actress Indira Varma was cast as Ellaria Sand, Prince Oberyn's paramour.|$|E
2500|$|On December 1, 1910, Wedge {{was arrested}} and incarcerated in the city jail on charges of battery for {{attempting}} to strike a night watchman named Gus Miller and begging after being found on Fifth Street near Market Street at 4.30am. Wedge denied the allegations and explained his alcoholic odor as due to his incarceration with drunks and [...] "wine bums", and that he possessed port wine {{given to him by}} the Hahnemann Hospital to prevent pneumonia. Wedge was given the sobriquet [...] "The Fighting Parson of the Barbary Coast". In 1917 Wedge explained its origin: [...] "I was preaching on a beer keg in a saloon on the Barbary coast in San Francisco when a couple of toughs went for me. I guess maybe I cleaned out the place then. A reporter on the San Francisco newspaper gave me the name. He said I was <b>a</b> <b>fellow</b> <b>who,</b> if he could not preach good into men, would knock h—l out of them. Those fellows got me, though, and put me in the hospital for a while". After being hospitalized after a vicious assault by several denizens of the Barbary Coast at the corner of Pacific and Montgomery avenues, by the end of 1910 Wedge decided to return to Omaha to recuperate and to attempt to reconcile with Prudence Tracy.|$|E
