5|$|Ahmad Shah I retaliated {{by sending}} his son Jafar Khan to {{recapture}} the lost territory. Jafar emerged victorious in the battle fought with Ahmad Shah I Wali. In 1431, Mahim was recaptured by the Sultanate of Gujarat. The Sultanate's patronage led {{to the construction of}} many mosques, prominent being the Haji Ali Dargah in Mahim, built in honour the Muslim saint Haji Ali in 1431. After the death of Kutb Khan, the Gujarat commandant of Mahim, Ahmad Shah I Wali again despatched a large army to capture Mahim. Ahmad Shah I responded with a large army and navy under Jafar Khan leading to the defeat of Ahmad Shah I Wali. During 1491–1494, the islands suffered sea piracies from Bahadur Khan Gilani, a nobleman of the Bahamani Sultanate. After the end of the Bahamani Sultanate, Bahadur Khan Gilani and Mahmud Gavan (1482–1518) broke out in rebellion at the port of Dabhol and conquered the islands along with the whole of Konkan. Portuguese explorer Francisco de Almeida's ship sailed into the deep natural harbour of the island in 1508, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>called</b> it Bom baía (Good Bay). However, the Portuguese paid their first visit to the islands on 21 January 1509, when they landed at Mahim after capturing a Gujarat barge in the Mahim creek. After a series of attacks by the Gujarat Sultanate, the islands were recaptured by Sultan Bahadur Shah.|$|E

5|$|Endecott's {{responsibility}} was {{to establish}} the colony and to prepare it {{for the arrival of}} additional settlers. The winters of 1629 and 1630 were difficult compared to those in England, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>called</b> on the Plymouth Colony for medical assistance. His wife, who had been ill on the voyage over, died that winter. Other difficulties he encountered included early signs of religious friction among the colony's settlers (dividing between Nonconformists and Separatists), and poor relations with Thomas Morton, whose failed Wessagusset Colony and libertine practices (which including a May pole and dancing) were anathema to the conservative Puritanism practiced by most settlers in the Massachusetts Bay and Plymouth colonies. Early in his term as governor he visited the abandoned site of Morton's colony and had the Maypole taken down. When one group of early settlers wanted to establish a church independent of that established by the colonial leadership, he had their leaders summarily sent back to England.|$|E
5|$|In July 2007, {{a report}} by Waterman Environmental was publicised by Councillor Craig, which {{revealed}} that the land upon which the Abbey Mills Mosque would be built is considered to have a medium-to-high contamination risk. The site {{was used as a}} chemical works for at least 100years, and was decommissioned as such in the late 1980s. Craig was alleged to have obtained this information under the Freedom of Information Act 2000, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>called</b> for the Environment Agency to be brought in and for the site to be shut down until an independent report was undertaken. According to Craig, the Waterman Report revealed that the original pre-remediation works had discovered soil and groundwater impact by mercury, lead, arsenic, oil, fuels, and asbestos fibres. There were methane and carbon dioxide land gas readings as well. Mosque officials have stated that allowing the development to proceed would benefit the community, as decontamination of the site is part of their building plan.|$|E

25|$|During the 2012 presidential campaign, Romney {{criticized the}} Obama Administration for holding General Motors stock {{for longer than}} he thought prudent.

He also said that fuel economy standards should be determined by market forces rather than by government mandates, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>called</b> electric vehicles “a technology that people aren’t interested in.” GM and Chrysler have denied that their post-bailout returns to the Chinese market are attempts to outsource American jobs, as Romney claimed from a since corrected report by Bloomberg News.|$|E
25|$|The {{rapid change}} of sovereigns did Ronsard no harm. Charles IX, King of France, who succeeded his brother {{after a very}} short time, was even better {{inclined}} to him than Henry and Francis. He gave him rooms in the palace; he bestowed upon him diverse abbacies and priories; <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>called</b> him and regarded him constantly as his master in poetry. Neither was Charles IX a bad poet. This royal patronage, however, had its disagreeable side. It excited violent dislike to Ronsard {{on the part of}} the Huguenots, who wrote constant pasquinades against him, strove (by a ridiculous exaggeration of the Dionysiac festival at Arcueil, in which the friends had indulged to celebrate the success of the first French tragedy, Jodelle's Cleopatre) to represent him as a libertine and an atheist, and (which seems to have annoyed him more than anything else) set up his follower Du Bartas as his rival.|$|E

25|$|Tara held great {{significance}} to the Irish population {{as it was the}} historic seat of the High Kings of Ireland. Clontarf was symbolic because of its association with the Battle of Clontarf in 1014, when the Irish King Brian Boru defeated his rival Maelmordha, although Brian himself died during the battle. Despite appeals from his supporters, O'Connell refused to defy the authorities <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>called</b> off the meeting, as he was unwilling to risk bloodshed and had no others. He was arrested, charged with conspiracy and sentenced to a year's imprisonment and a fine of £2,000, although he was released after three months by the House of Lords, which quashed the conviction and severely criticised the unfairness of the trial. Having deprived himself of his most potent weapon, the monster meeting, O'Connell with his health failing had no plan and dissension broke out in the Repeal Association.|$|E
25|$|In the 2004 {{election}}, Bagapsh had {{run with}} Stanislav Lakoba as Vice Presidential candidate. The power-sharing deal between Bagapsh and Khajimba {{to end the}} post-election crisis meant that Lakoba could no longer become Vice President. Instead, after the new election on 12 January 2005, Lakoba was appointed Secretary of the Security Council on 17 February. When Khajimba resigned as Vice President on 28 May 2009 he declared that within the government he had received most support by Lakoba. On 18 August Lakoba himself handed his resignation over the Abkhazian citizenship crisis. In an interview with Caucasian Knot on 3 September Lakoba stated {{that he would not}} participate in the December 2009 presidential election <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>called</b> absurd the notion that he would join the opposition. Nevertheless, {{in an interview with the}} newspaper Nuzhnaya on 17 November, Lakoba stated that as a private citizen he supported Khajimba's candidacy and he praised his work in the Security Council. On 4 December Lakoba had a statement read out on Abkhazian television in which he stressed that this was only his private opinion and that it should not be used by any of the election campaigns.|$|E
25|$|Believing that Rosecrans was {{attempting}} to move {{the center of the}} battle farther north than Bragg planned, Bragg began rushing heavy reinforcements from all parts of his line to his right, starting with Cheatham's division of Polk's Corps, with five brigades the largest in the Army of Tennessee. At 11 a.m., Cheatham's men approached Liddell's halted division and formed on its left. Three brigades under Brig. Gens. Marcus Wright, Preston Smith, and John Jackson formed the front line and Brig. Gens. Otho Strahl and George Maney commanded the brigades in the second line. Their advance greatly overlapped Croxton's brigade and had no difficulty pushing it back. As Croxton withdrew, his brigade was replaced by Brig. Gen. Richard Johnson's division of McCook's XX Corps near the LaFayette Road. Johnson's lead brigades, under Col. Philemon Baldwin and Brig. Gen. August Willich engaged Jackson's brigade, protecting Croxton's withdrawal. Although outnumbered, Jackson held under the pressure until his ammunition ran low <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>called</b> for reinforcements. Cheatham sent in Maney's small brigade to replace Jackson, but they were no match for the two larger Federal brigades and Maney was forced to withdraw as both of his flanks were crushed.|$|E
