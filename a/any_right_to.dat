5|$|In New Jersey, older Department of Defense and Department of Interior {{properties}} such as Fort Dix {{and parts}} of Sandy Hook are federal enclaves, but most other federal properties are not enclaves. Because New Jersey generally did not reserve <b>any</b> <b>right</b> <b>to</b> regulate federal enclaves, state liquor licensing rules and alcohol taxes cannot be enforced. There is no universal policy regarding the sale of alcoholic beverages on federal lands, but almost all military bases, and some national parks allow for alcohol concessions, both for on-premises or off-premises consumption.|$|E
5|$|In the Boston Police Strike, Boston police {{officers}} {{went on strike}} on September 9, 1919. They sought recognition for their trade union and improvements in wages and working conditions. Police Commissioner Edwin Upton Curtis denied that {{police officers}} had <b>any</b> <b>right</b> <b>to</b> form a union, much less one affiliated with a larger organization like the American Federation of Labor (AFL). Attempts at reconciliation between the Commissioner and the police officers, particularly {{on the part of}} Boston's Mayor Andrew James Peters, failed.|$|E
5|$|Chesney {{served as}} a royal justice in Lincolnshire during his bishopric, and {{maintained}} {{a close relationship with}} his nephew, Foliot. He was also an early patron of Thomas Becket, and gave the young cleric an office in his diocese early in Becket's career. Although shown favour by King Stephen of England, including the right to a mint, Chesney was present at the coronation of King Henry II of England in 1154 and went on to serve Henry as a royal justice. Around 1160, Chesney became embroiled in a dispute with St Albans Abbey in the diocese of Lincoln, over his right as bishop to supervise the abbey. The dispute was eventually settled when the abbey granted Chesney land in return for his relinquishing <b>any</b> <b>right</b> <b>to</b> oversee St Albans.|$|E

5|$|Following this event, Zwingli {{and other}} humanist friends petitioned the bishop on 2 July {{to abolish the}} {{requirement}} of celibacy on the clergy. Two weeks later the petition was reprinted for the public in German as Eine freundliche Bitte und Ermahnung an die Eidgenossen (A Friendly Petition and Admonition to the Confederates). The issue was not just an abstract problem for Zwingli, as he had secretly married a widow, Anna Reinhard, earlier in the year. Their cohabitation was well-known and their public wedding took place on 2 April 1524, {{three months before the}} birth of their first child. They would eventually have four children: Regula, William, Huldrych, and Anna. As the petition was addressed to the secular authorities, the bishop responded at the same level by notifying the Zurich government to maintain the ecclesiastical order. Other Swiss clergymen joined in Zwingli's cause which encouraged him to make his first major statement of faith, Apologeticus Archeteles (The First and Last Word). He defended himself against charges of inciting unrest and heresy. He denied the ecclesiastical hierarchy <b>any</b> <b>right</b> <b>to</b> judge on matters of church order because of its corrupted state.|$|E

25|$|The Second Moroccan Crisis of 1911 {{saw another}} dispute over Morocco erupt when France tried to {{suppress}} a revolt there. Germany, still smarting {{from the previous}} quarrel, agreed to a settlement whereby the French ceded some territory in central Africa in exchange for Germany's renouncing <b>any</b> <b>right</b> <b>to</b> intervene in Moroccan affairs. This confirmed French control over Morocco, which became a full protectorate of that country in 1912.|$|E

The Church alleged that the records were needed to start their legal defense. These records were previously denied to the Church because they were part of an ongoing criminal investigation.|$|E

25|$|The {{history of}} the papacy from 1048 to 1257 would {{continue}} to be marked by conflict between popes and the Holy Roman Emperor, most prominently the Investiture Controversy, a dispute over who—pope or emperor—could appoint bishops within the Empire. Henry IV's Walk to Canossa in 1077 to meet Pope Gregory VII (1073–85), although not dispositive {{within the context of the}} larger dispute, has become legendary. Although the emperor renounced <b>any</b> <b>right</b> <b>to</b> lay investiture in the Concordat of Worms (1122), the issue would flare up again.|$|E
25|$|Suffrage, {{political}} franchise, {{or simply}} franchise {{is the right}} to vote in public, political elections (although the term is sometimes used for <b>any</b> <b>right</b> <b>to</b> vote). The right to run for office is sometimes called candidate eligibility, and the combination of both rights is sometimes called full suffrage. In many languages, the right to vote is called the active right to vote and the right to run for office is called the passive right to vote. In English, these are sometimes called active suffrage and passive suffrage.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to these problems, Bedouin women have additional obstacles to accessing care. Bedouin women are often not permitted to travel alone. In circumstances where the clinic is further away from the settlement, a male relative must accompany the woman (often forfeiting a day’s wage {{in order to do}} so). Moreover, higher school dropout rates and lower employment levels among Bedouin women mean that {{they are less likely to}} speak Hebrew. If the medical practitioner does not speak Arabic, the women must often rely on their male relatives for translation, thus forfeiting <b>any</b> <b>right</b> <b>to</b> medical privacy. When surveyed, Bedouin women cited lack of childcare (in {{addition to}} prohibitive distances and poor infrastructure) as a top barrier to accessing health care.|$|E

25|$|The American Federation of Labor (AFL) began {{granting}} charters {{to police}} unions in June 1919 when pressed {{to do so}} by local groups, and in just 5 months had recognized affiliate police unions in 37 cities. The Boston police rank and file went out on strike on September 9, 1919 in order to achieve recognition for their union and improvements in wages and working conditions. Police Commissioner Edwin Upton Curtis denied that police officers had <b>any</b> <b>right</b> <b>to</b> form a union, much less one affiliated with a larger organization like the AFL. During the strike, Boston experienced two nights of lawlessness until several thousand members of the State Guard supported by volunteers restored order, though not without causing several deaths. The public, fed by lurid press accounts and hyperbolic political observers, viewed the strike with a degree of alarm out of proportion to the events, which ultimately produced only about $35,000 of property damage.|$|E
25|$|In foreign affairs, he {{held that}} the French people should conduct their {{revolution}} as they wished, and that no foreign nation had <b>any</b> <b>right</b> <b>to</b> interfere with the country's internal affairs. But he knew that neighboring nations were disturbed by {{the progress of the}} revolution, feared its influence on their own peoples, and that foreign monarchs were being importuned by French émigrés to intervene on behalf of the French monarchy. To prevent this intervention, or rather to give no pretext for it, was the guiding principle in his foreign policy. He was elected a member of the comité diplomatique of the Assembly in July 1790, and in this capacity he was able to prevent the Assembly from doing much harm with regard to foreign affairs. He had long known Armand Marc, comte de Montmorin, the foreign secretary, and, as matters became more strained, he entered into daily communication with the minister, advising him on every point, and, while dictating his policy, defended it in the Assembly. Mirabeau's exertions in this respect showed him to be a statesman; his influence is best demonstrated by the confused state of affairs in this area after his death.|$|E
