5000|$|The largest {{cultivated}} {{forest in}} Europe was imagined by man who fought with a hostile insanitary territory {{made up of}} invasive sands, marshes, dried-up moors, where the fragile balance of an <b>agro-sylvo-pastoral</b> economy subsisted. The dunes became stable thanks to local plant species. By his ingenuity, man dried out the marshes and planted {{thousands of acres of}} maritime pines.Profiting from an embargo by the United States during its Civil War, harvesting resin really took off in France, and this right up to the 19th century. Prices started to fall until a total cease of activity around 1970. The Landais had to adapt, once again, to an economic reconversion, and the production of wood has been the main forest industry since then.The Landes Forest can still be distinguished today by it unique species of [...] "maritime pine" [...] and its straight lines the symbol of a rigorous silvicultural exploitation, the most beautiful trees destined for the most modern sawmills (to be turned into beams, wooden houses, floors, paneling, and plywood). Less interesting trees, the by-products of the forest are turned into paper and different types of wood-fiber or particle boards.Constantly over 50 percent replanted, this PEFC certified forest (Pan European Forest Certification) is the pledge of sustainable management of the environment.The top local employer, the wood industry generates one job out of three and constitutes the second largest industrial employer in the Aquitaine region. The forest is the source of a multitude of activities and was able to adapt to modern demands.Cultivated and 94% privately owned, this young and fragile ecosystem is nonetheless open to the public through an immense network of cycling paths, walking trails, guided tours for all ages and fun activities for children.|$|E
40|$|Mestrado em Engenharia do Ambiente - Instituto Superior de Agronomia - ULThe present {{dissertation}} aims at {{understanding how}} the future climate change scenarios {{may affect the}} production of grassland biomass in the montado <b>agro-sylvo-pastoral</b> system, by studying the effects of precipitation, aridity and topography (slope) in both the field, in different sites along a climatic gradient in Alentejo, and in greenhouse trials, using the seedbank collected at those sites. The impact of these three factors was studied independently, {{in order to understand}} the importance of each of them for biomass productivity and, consequently, determine the main driving factors. The results showed a stronger effect of precipitation during the growing season on biomass productivity, in both field and greenhouse trials, thus highlighting this factor, among the three studied, as the major driver of biomass response and consequently of future changes in the landscape of montado <b>agro-sylvo-pastoral</b> system in Alentejo. The comparison of field and greenhouse trial was also intended to study the seedbank ability to retain information regarding the past climate history of its site of origin – ‘memory’. Results showed that in greenhouse, regardless of the locations from where the soil samples were taken, the seed bank responded similarly in terms of biomass production, vegetation cover, species richness and flowering onset when subjected to similar favorable conditions in the greenhouse – regular and abundant watering.

40|$|International audienceIn <b>agro-sylvo-pastoral</b> villages ofWest Africa, biomass {{management}} {{ensures the}} sustainability of mixed-farming systems especially in maintaining soil fertility. Traditionally, agriculture and livestock activities are strongly linked. Cattle herds mobility leads to a positive nutrient and carbon transfer from rangelands to individual cultivated fields. In some regions, demographic growth and subsequent decline in rangelands lead to herd depletion, a phenomenon that disturbs the traditional system and threatens food security. The village of Sare Yero Bana is located in sub-humid area, region of High Casamance in Senegal. The {{aim of this study}} was to assess the sustainability at village level by comparing the changes in farm functioning and the nitrogen balance between the years 1997 and 2012...|$|E

During their investigation in this article, field and laboratory research (particularly historical ecology surveys, archaeobotany and environmental archaeology) are interpreted in tandem with archival sources, the intention of which is to contextualise the chestnut cultivation, as part of a complex <b>agro-sylvo-pastoral</b> system, within a wider socio-ecological framework. As a result an increased understanding of the historical ecology of chestnut cultivation can be beneficial to the future planning and management of its role within various environments and landscapes...|$|E
40|$|The {{contributions}} of California and Spanish oak woodlands to owners, neighbors, and society are undervalued. Recent Spanish studies {{have begun to}} identify the components of value provided by traditional oak woodland <b>agro-sylvo-pastoral</b> systems, including environmental and self-consumption values. Work in California has revealed that self-consumption by owners, benefits to neighboring properties, and benefits to the larger society are important components of the total valuation of traditional low-intensity oak woodland ranching. In Spain, this type of bioeconomic analysis, known as “Total Economic Value, ” engages an institutional framework at pan-European, national, and regional levels as the full economic values of low-intensity agriculture are increasingly recognized and supported by subsidies and public policy initiatives. In California oak woodlands this accounting helps provide a means for assessing conservation investments by third party non-governmental organizations, and sheds light on oak woodland landowner behaviors crucial to efforts to conserve these mostly private lands. We embark on a course of research to conduct comparative bioeconomic analysis in Spain and California, including evaluation of the ecological outcomes of various scenarios, and the institutional leverage points for such information. This paper introduces ecological, economic, and institutional similarities and differences in the woodlands, with {{particular attention to the}} possibilities of comparative bioeconomic analyses...|$|E

Rhythms and causalities of anthropisation {{dynamic in}} Europe between 6500 and 500 BC: sociocultural and/or climatic assumptionsInternational audienceRescue {{excavations}} in the Middle Rhone valley have provided opportunities to develop innovative {{strategies for the}} study of palaeoenvironments. These strategies involve sampling and analysis of botanical remains, recovered not only from archaeological sites but also in “off-site” pedosedimentary sequences thought to be poor in botanical remains. Thus, these remains (phytoliths, pedo-charcoal) give access to unexplored depositional contexts, like alluvial plains. Moreover, off-site data are useful because they minimise the hazard of cultural bias (e. g. selection of species during wood gathering). Comparison of data collected in the alluvial plain with data obtained via anthracological analyses of karstic caves and rock-shelters in the hinterland suggests a complex <b>agro-sylvo-pastoral</b> management of the landscape during the Middle Neolithic. We propose a pattern that supposes considerable specialization in use of plains vs. slopes in the landscape, and a strong and continuous human pressure on the vegetation and soils between 4500 and 3500 cal. B. C. Nevertheless, these constraints are not sufficient to explain the persistence of such a system for more than a millennium. Favourable climatic conditions are thought to have been a determining factor in the persistence of an ecologically meta-stable relationship between human societies and their natural environment...|$|E
40|$|Traditional {{high-quality}} {{meat products}} from Mediterranean pigs are produced in extensive-type production systems using <b>agro-sylvo-pastoral</b> resources. These production systems {{depend on a}} number of native resources, geological, plants and animals. These farms have extensive areas of land, using local breeds, valorise the regional agroforests and develop the practice of grazing, use less external inputs and less manpower. In this work different issues of traditional Mediterranean pig production systems are characterized and through a SWOT methodological approach (Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, Threats), we discuss the main advantages and disadvantages {{from the point of view}} of sustainability and future of the traditional Mediterranean pig meat chain. Benefits: these products have a high gastronomic and economic value that the consumer values for its unique quality and environmental gains, cultural and ethical advantage; typical Mediterranean hams and sausages are recognized internationally; they present organoleptic qualities and unique dietary feature; there are protective mechanisms and quality control that allow defending the genuineness of the products (PDO, PGI). Constraints: it is common to find weaknesses at the farm management level and animal husbandry, and there are also serious threats related to natural resource management (degradation of the typical Mediterranean forest) and market competitiveness. The sustainability of Mediterranean traditional pig industry depends on the preservation of endogenous resources and the quality of management at the farm level, as well as the market transparency...|$|E
40|$|The Brabant sablo-limoneux {{region is}} located in the south and near Brussels, in the phytogeographic {{district}} of Brabant (Atlantic domain). This region is characterized by a high diversity of local ecological conditions due to the alternance of important tertiary sand outcrops and quaternary silty layers. The <b>agro-sylvo-pastoral</b> activities, which were practiced on these sandy and sand-silty soils for centuries, caused the evolution of the climactic forest into semi-natural habitats such as dry heathland, sandy grassland and grassheath. The evolution of the heathland distribution from 1770 to the present has been studied on the scale of the Dyle hydrographic subbasin (43. 000 ha). It is characterized by an important regression of this habitat in the study area (from 1460 ha in 1770 to 72 ha in 2006), mainly due to Pinus sylvestris orchards, and more recently, to urbanisation caused by the proximity of Brussels. A generalized ageing and an environmental closing characterize the evolution of heathland physiognomy since the middle of the 20 th century. The phytosociology of heathlands, sandy grasslands and grassheaths has been characterized and 19 groups of vegetation have been differentiated. Among the 393 listed higher plant species, more than 30 are of great conservation interest in the regional context. A hierarchisation of restoration priorities has been established on the scale of the studied hydrographic subbasin and management measures have been proposed...|$|E
40|$|International audienceAncient Persia {{witnessed}} one of {{its most}} prosperous cultural and socio-economic periods between 550 bc and ad 651, with the successive domination of the Achaemenid, Seleucid, Parthian and Sassanian Empires. During this period agricultural activities increased on the Iranian plateau, as demonstrated by a remarkable arboricultural expansion. However, available data are not very informative about the spatial organization of agricultural practices. The possible links between climate conditions and agricultural activities during this millennium of continuous imperial domination are also unclear, {{due to the lack of}} parallel human-independent palaeoclimatic proxies. This study presents a new late Holocene pollen-based vegetation record from Lake Parishan, SW Iran. This record provides invaluable information regarding anthropogenic activities before, during and after the empires and sheds light on (i) spatial patterning in agricultural activities and (ii) possible climate impacts on <b>agro-sylvo-pastoral</b> practices during this period. Results of this study indicate that arboriculture was the most prominent form of agricultural activity in SW Iran especially during the Achaemenid, Seleucid and Parthian periods. Contrary to the information provided by some Greco-Roman written sources, the record from Lake Parishan shows that olive cultivation was practiced during Achaemenid and Seleucid times, when olive cultivation was significant, at least in this basin located close to the capital area of the Achaemenid Empire. In addition, pollen from aquatic vegetation suggests that the period of the latter centuries of the first millennium bc was characterized by a higher lake level, which might have favoured cultural and socio-economic prosperity...|$|E
40|$|The Project "Communal Forestry Development in the Bolivian Highlands (Altiplano) " : a New Vision of the Communautary Agroforestry. Since 1991, the "Communal Forestry Development in the Bolivian Highlands (Altiplano) " {{project has}} been {{promoting}} self-supporting agroforestry activities, integrated into the farmerproductive system, boosting the satisfaction of needs in forest products, increasing agriculture production and conserving natural resources. High demands on land and the difficult climatic conditions prevailing in Potosi department, where the project is located, are serious constraints to a massive forestation. Taking these constraints into account, the project has developped a strategy, the Communal Forestry Development, which is focussed on an integrated and participative approach : "integrated" means the technical available alternatives, including agroforestry actions (promotion of forester, fruit, and forrage trees and shrubs) as well as hydraulic and soil conservation actions, are implemented inside the productive <b>agro-sylvo-pastoral</b> systems. Within the scope of an implication of the stakeholders, the project uses "participative" ways as communautary planning of agroforestry priorities. Those objectives are reached by means of training, extension and communication. Another orientation consists in a flexible coordination with all the organizations working on the field. The project is now implementing a second phase. The results which have been registered so far lead towards a strenghthening of integrated actions and increasing responsabilities of as well communities as other institutions. Such an orientation points out {{the necessity of a}} long-term and flexible project conception...|$|E
40|$|Land {{degradation}} is {{an environmental}} problem which weakens <b>agro-sylvo-pastoral</b> productivity in sub-Saharan Africa. The most common manifestation of land degradation is {{the appearance of}} denuded land. We carried out an experiment to test the effect of three {{soil and water conservation}} techniques on survival and growth of Jatropha curcas seedlings transplanted onto two completely denuded lands in the Sahelian and Sudanian zones of Burkina Faso. We implemented an experimental design with three replicates per restoration technique. A total of 174 seedlings were planted in each study site. The results showed that the soil water content varied according to the restoration technique used (df = 2; F = 53. 21; p < 0. 00) as well as according to study site (df = 1; F = 74. 48; p < 0. 00). Soil water content was significantly lower in the Sahel than in the Sudanian zone. Seedling survival rate varied significantly according to technique used (df = 2; F = 8. 91; p = 0. 000) and study site (df = 1; F = 9. 74; p = 0. 003). Survival rate, diameter and seedling height were highest at the Sudanian site. At the Sahelian site, all seedlings died 2 years after establishment. These results suggest that J. curcas is unsuited to denuded land in the Sahelian zone. Most of the plants died in the Sahel between April and May, which is the peak of the dry season; this may be an indication that J. curcas may not be as drought-resistant as suggested by the prolific literature which has reported on diverse claims surrounding this plant...|$|E
40|$|International audienceIn {{the context}} of global change, the {{assessment}} of the past history and current dynamics of forest species is essential for improving our knowledge of the settlement and evolution of the present-day landscape. Several paleoecological approaches are well suited for reconstructing past landscapes and Holocene dynamics. Today, the subalpine forest of Queyras is composed primarily of larch, with lesser proportions of stone pine, mountain pine and fir. During the Holocene, the subalpine forest was subject to natural disturbances, particularly fires. By the end of the Atlantic period, human perturbations resulting from <b>agro-sylvo-pastoral</b> practices became an important factor, and this factor serves to explain the landscape dynamics and the dominance of certain woody species. In this study, a pedoanthracological approach was used to enhance existing knowledge of the history of forest species and to reach a good understanding of the processes that have shaped the current floristic assemblage. The results of the analyses of soil charcoal performed in this study provide the following new information: (i) a longer Holocene history for larch and stone pine, (ii) a lack of evidence for a natural presence of fir and (iii) a long-term history for Scots pine. The dates obtained reveal the early occurrence of recolonization by stone pine and larch following the last glaciation. The charcoals analyzed demonstrate the overall presence of stone pine, which is found throughout the studied history of the area. In terms of the changes presently occurring, among which both the abandonment of human land-use practices and climate change are especially important, the current conditions at mid-high altitudes might potentially allow the establishment of larch forests for a long period as preclimax ecosystems. The low frequency of fir in charcoal samples raises questions about the status and possible presence of fir in the past despite palynological evidence. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd and INQUA.

40|$|International audienceTwo short (100 and 175 cm-long) {{sediment}} cores {{from the}} southwestern corner of Lake Urmia provide {{a record of}} vegetation dynamics, lake-level changes {{and the role of}} climate and humans in shaping the landscape around Lake Urmia over the last 2550 years. Relatively low values of arboreal pollen (AP), and substantial values of Artemisia pollen from 2550 to 1500 cal BP indicate the prevalence of steppe vegetation and relatively arid climate in the area. However, a prominent peak of Riella spores may indicate a short-lived lake-level rise for the period 1900 - 2000 cal BP. The next period, 1500 - 550 cal BP, is characterized by substantial rise in AP, particularly Quercus, and a sharp decline of Artemisia, Chenopodiaceae/Amaranthaceae and wetland pollen types, suggesting the expansion of oak forests under a rather moist climate and/or a decline in <b>agro-sylvo-pastoral</b> practices in the area. Agricultural activity in the area can be inferred from sporadic occurrences of Vitis, Ricinus and Juglans pollen {{from the beginning of the}} record. The rise of saline habitat pollen types between 1100 and 800 cal BP, along with increased values of magnetic susceptibility and organic matter, suggest a lower water level and the subaerial exposure of saline mud flats, which could favour the re-colonization of chenopods and other halophytes around the margins of the lake. Thus, the Medieval Climatic Anomaly seems to be warmer-than-present in the Lake Urmia region. From 450 to 150 cal BP, the decline in Quercus and high values of Artemisia, along with higher lake levels and high magnetic susceptibility values, could be associated with the Little Ice Age. Since 500 cal BP, Quercus and Riella steadily decline and fade out towards the surface of the core, whereas pollen types attributable to steppe and desert vegetation increase. A prominent increase in organic matter in the uppermost part of the record could be associated with a lower lake level and the expansion of wetland vegetation in the recent past. Our findings suggest that the regional forest coverage in the highlands of Zagros and Azerbaijan has reached its minimum during recent decades, while Urmia's lake level dropped dramatically (increasing its water salinity) most likely as a function of extensive anthropogenic activities and general climate aridification.
