40|$|In this paper, {{we examine}} {{previous}} {{work on the}} naive Bayesian classifier and review its limitations, which include a sensitivity to correlated features. We respond to this problem by embedding the naive Bayesian induction scheme within an algorithm that c <b>arries</b> out <b>a</b> greedy search through the space of features. We hypothesize that this approach will improve asymptotic accuracy in domains that involve correlated features without reducing the rate of learning in ones that do not. We report experimental results on six natural domains, including comparisons with decision-tree induction, that support these hypotheses. In closing, we discuss other approaches to extending naive Bayesian classifiers and outline some directions for future research.

This paper presents a new all risks real yield (ARRY) valuation model for the 21 st Century valuer’s use. It requires a paradigm shift {{in the minds of}} valuers from 20 th Century thinking in nominal value terms to thinking in real value terms. This affects the methodology, valuation models and techniques required to value income producing property. It is compared to and distinguished from the conventional all risks yield (ARY) model used in the UK and previous real value valuation models developed in the UK and USA in the 1970 - 80 ’s.

40|$|Mammalian {{spermiogenesis}} {{is characterized}} by a unique chromatin-remodeling process in which histones are replaced by transition protein 1 (TP 1), TP 2, and TP 4, which are further replaced by protamines. We showed previously that the import of TP 2 into the haploid spermatid nucleus requires the components of cytosol and ATP. We have now <b>arried</b> out <b>a</b> detailed analysis to characterize the molecular components underlying the nuclear translocation of TP 2. Real-time PCR analysis of the expression of different importins in testicular germ cells revealed that importin- 4 and importin- β 3 are significantly up-regulated in tetraploid and haploid germ cells. We carried out physical interaction studies as well as an in vitro nuclear transport assay using recombinant TP 2 and the nuclear localization ignal of TP 2 (TP 2 NLS) fused to glutathione S-transferase in digitonin-permeabilized, haploid, round spermatids and identified importin- 4 {{to be involved in the}} import of TP 2. A three-dimensional model of the importin- 4 protein was generated using the crystal structure of importin- β 1 as the template. Molecular docking simulations of TP 2 _NLS with the importin- 4 structure led to the identification of a TP 2 _NLS binding pocket spanning the three helices (helices 21 to 23) of importin- 4, which was experimentally confirmed by in vitro interaction and import studies with different deletion mutants of importin- 4. In contrast to TP 2, TP 1 import was accomplished through a passive diffusion process...|$|R

With no doubt software agents have been proposing as an innovative paradigm for some years, and we envision a digital world populated by them to support users belonging to the human world.

40|$|Systems of {{multiple}} current sheets arise in various situations in natu ral plasmas, {{such as at}} the heliospheric current sheet in the solar wind and in the outer he liosphere in the heliosheath. Previous three-dimensional simulations have shown th at such systems can develop turbulent-like fluctuations resulting from forward and inve rse cascade in wave vector space. We present {{a study of the}} transition to turbulence of such multiple current sheet systems, including the effects of adding a magnetic guide field a nd velocity shears across the current sheets. Three-dimensional hybrid simulations are performed of systems with eight narrow current sheets in a triply-periodic geometry. We c <b>arry</b> out <b>a</b> number of different analyses of the evolution of the fluctuations as the initia lly highly ordered state relaxes to one which resembles turbulence. Despite the evide nce of forward and inverse cascade in the fluctuation power spectra, we find that non e of the simulated cases have evidence of intermittency after the initial period of fast reco nnection associated with the ion tearing instability at the current sheets. Cancellation an alysis confirms that the simulations have not evolved to a state which can be identified as f ully developed turbulence. The addition of velocity shears across the current sh eets slows the evolution in the properties of the fluctuations, {{but by the end of}} the simulatio n they are broadly similar. However, if the simulation is constrained to be two-dimensiona l, differences are found, indicating that fully three-dimensional simulations are import ant when studying the evolution of an ordered equilibrium towards a turbulent-like stat e...|$|R

40|$|The goal of {{the project}} was the {{development}} of a technique which allows to integrate optical free space interconnections in a miniaturized form. By this three-dimensional integration optical systems can be realized in a more compact form. Thus integration densities could be achieved, which are comparable to micro-electronics. The basic elements of this integration technique are the use of a stacked-layer technique, lithography and refractive optics. For numerical simulation of the light propagation through refractive components a new method, the wave-propagation method (WPM) was developed. Compared to paraxial approximations this method allows the treatment of propagation angles up to 70 degrees. For this project three technologies have been employed: micro lenses were fabricated by ion exchange in glas. Beam splitting and beam deflecting elements were fabricated with LIGA-technique and beam forming elements have been realized by photo-polymerisation. By combining the individual component arrays a micro-optical system was demonstrated, which performs a perfect-shuffle permutation on <b>an</b> <b>arry</b> of 100 data channels within a volume of less than one mm" 3.

40|$|Thermal {{pyrolysis}} {{is one of}} the renewable technologies where {{waste tyre}} and tube were pyrolysed into fuel oil, carbon lack, and combustible gas under the action of reasonable technological conditions. This technology could not only reasonably and effectively dispose waste tyre and tube without pollution, but also is effective in producing fuel that can reduce energy crisis. In the present work, thermal pyrolysis of waste bicycle tyre and tube samples were <b>arried</b> out in <b>a</b> semi batch reactor made up of stainless steel ithin the temperature range of 450 ºC to 800 ºC. The optimum yrolytic oil of 49. 6 %was obtained at 600 ºC for tyreand 9. 65 % for tube at 700 ºC. Again to increase further oil ield, different catalysts have been used. e. SiO 2 /Al 2 O 3, Kaolin, CaO, and MgO. But, it was identified that theatalyticpyrolysis was not effective when compared to thermal pyrolysis in terms of product yields (oil). The physical properties of the oil obtained were determined by using standard test methods and the chemical composition was analyzed by using FTIR, GC-MS analyzer. The char obtained was characterized for its calorific value and surface morphology by SEM. Characterization of both pyrolytic oil shows that the obtained oil is a mixture of diesel and gasoline. The composition of the oil showed the presence of aromatic and aliphatic compounds. Kinetic parameters of tyre and tube sample were also studied at the heating rates of 10, 15 and 20 ºC/min by TGA which showed that with the increase of rate of heatingactivation energy decreases. Engine performance test was done by using different blends such as 10 %, 20 %, 30 %, 40 % and 50 % of bicycle tubepyrolyticoil with diesel. Performance, emission and combustion characteristics of the diesel engine were tudied. From engine test it was concluded that 40 % blend of tube pyrolytic oil with diesel can be substituted with diesel.

40|$|The subject. The author's {{research}} methodology of social processes is represented, {{by establishing a}} bond between the ways of property organization and governmental form – especially its political regime. The analysis of methodology {{is based on the}} historical materials devoted to Russian statehood in terms of its transition states during the appropriate industrialization of domestic production. The results, scope of application. Since 1861, the Russian statehood during its existence has experienced a number of important transitional states, where the successful process of forming the traditional foundations of the corresponding society in different periods (pre- Soviet, Soviet and post-Soviet) in terms of the author's methodology was and still is untenable. The basis of this methodology is the existing relationship between the concrete way of property organization and its social function. Thus, a private way of property organization reproduces the function of social development. A mixed (corporate) way provides a function of social compromise (convergence). Finally, the common (collective) way of property organization can be determined by the function of social security. A concrete way of property organization <b>arries</b> out only <b>a</b> specific social function. An attempt to change this dependence leads the corresponding society to the destruction of the foundations of its existence. Thus, the liquidation (abolition) of the private way of property organization objectively forms the impossibility of realizing the functions of social development and the functions of social compromise (convergence) in the society by the common (collective) way of its organization. There is another aspect of the relationship between a particular way of organizing property and its social function. Each of the above methods of property organization, reaching a monopoly state that goes into rent, provides for self-destruction and transformation of its social function as opposed to: from development to degradation, from compromise to confrontation, from social provision of society to the provision of clans. A brief historical digression in the article makes it possible to disclose the content of this methodology when analyzing the facts of life of Russian statehood, including its latest history until 2017. Conclusions. The modern post-Soviet statehood in its various foundations: economic, political, social and cultural, when realizing the appropriate tendencies of segregation of the private way of property organization and the growing monopolization of state property, largely casts doubt on the future development of our society. </p...|$|R
