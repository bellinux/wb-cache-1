50|$|The {{principles}} of technical analysis {{are derived from}} hundreds of years of financial market data. Some aspects of technical analysis {{began to appear in}} Amsterdam-based businessman Joseph de la Vega's accounts of the Dutch financial markets in the 17th century. In Asia, technical analysis {{is said to be a}} method developed by Homma Munehisa during the early 18th century which evolved into the use of candlestick techniques, and is today a technical <b>analysis</b> <b>charting</b> tool. In the 1920s and 1930s Richard W. Schabacker published several books which continued the work of Charles Dow and William Peter Hamilton in their books Stock Market Theory and Practice and Technical Market Analysis. In 1948 Robert D. Edwards and John Magee published Technical Analysis of Stock Trends which is widely considered to be one of the seminal works of the discipline. It is exclusively concerned with trend <b>analysis</b> and <b>chart</b> patterns and remains in use to the present. Early technical analysis was almost exclusively the <b>analysis</b> of <b>charts,</b> because the processing power of computers was not available for the modern degree of statistical analysis. Charles Dow reportedly originated a form of point and figure <b>chart</b> <b>analysis.</b>|$|R
5000|$|In {{regard to}} {{statistical}} methodology, in 1960 Cattell founded the Society of Multivariate Experimental Psychology (SMEP), and its journal Multivariate Behavioral Research, {{in order to}} bring together, encourage, and support scientists interested in multi-variate research. He was an early and frequent user of factor analysis (a statistical procedure for finding underlying factors in data). Cattell also developed new factor analytic techniques, for example, by inventing the Scree Test, which uses the curve of latent roots to judge the optimal number of factors to extract. He also developed a new factor analysis rotation procedure—the [...] "Procrustes" [...] or non-orthogonal rotation, designed to let the data itself determine the best location of factors, rather than requiring orthogonal factors. Additional contributions include the Coefficient of Profile Similarity (taking account of shape, scatter, and level of two score profiles); P-technique factor analysis based on repeated measurements of a single individual (sampling of variables, rather than sampling of persons); dR-technique factor analysis for elucidating change dimensions (including transitory emotional states, and longer-lasting mood states); the Taxonome program for ascertaining the number and contents of clusters in a data set; the Rotoplot program for attaining maximum simple structure factor pattern solutions. As well, he put forward the Dynamic Calculus for assessing interests and motivation, the Basic Data Relations Box (assessing dimensions of experimental designs), the group syntality construct ("personality" [...] of a group), the triadic theory of cognitive abilities, the Ability Dimension <b>Analysis</b> <b>Chart</b> (ADAC), and Multiple Abstract Variance Analysis (MAVA), with [...] "specification equations" [...] to embody genetic and environmental variables and their interactions.|$|E

The PCAC method improvement a technique of Six Sigma was introduced in this research which has three phases. The first phase calculates the values which are Cpk in 6, 5, 4 and 3 when the process means shifts by 1. 5; and then to construct PCAC in 6, 5, 4 and 3 when the process means shifts by 1. 5 in the second phase. Finally, the influential quality characteristics that need to be improved must be located by the PCAC method. This method will be used to measure the aforementioned arbour bearings of sewing machine. The measuring outcome follows that the quality level of orthogonal degree arrived 6.
