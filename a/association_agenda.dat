40|$|Trade {{associations}} {{operate under}} the premise of advancing the shared interests of their member firms. How well do they fulfill this role? In this paper, I measure the activity of 148 major industry trade associations over time and relate this activity {{to the performance of}} the relevant industries and dominant firms within them. Findings suggest that trade association spending increases when the profitability of the four largest firms in an industry decreases but spending is unrelated to the profitability of the industry overall. This implies that large firms exert control over trade <b>association</b> <b>agendas</b> and may use these communal organizations to advance their own interests rather than the shared interests of the entire industry. Moreover, it points to the need for further development of the currently anemic management literature on the activities of trade associations...|$|R

50|$|The {{situation}} looks {{even more}} dramatic if one considers the amounts of money allocated for the {{health care for the}} persons in custody and improvement of health care services. These issues were the matter of serious concern within the CE institutions and priority tasks for the Ukraine-EU <b>association</b> <b>agenda.</b> This amount constituted 179.57 million UAH or about 1/33 of the entire program scope and only 1/4 of the amount to be spent on modernization of the CF system.|$|E
50|$|The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Georgia has {{submitted}} {{an action}} plan for achieve accession to the European Union. The commission received information about {{the implementation of the}} Georgia-EU Association Agreement and the National Action Plan for the Implementation of the <b>Association</b> <b>Agenda.</b> As it has pointed out during the meeting, the European side, both in the last year's meeting of the Georgia-EU Association Council and the report of the European Commission, commended the reforms of the Georgian Government aiming at the implementation of the Association Agreement. The meeting also adopted the 2017-2020 Government Strategy on Georgia's EU and NATO Integration Communications.|$|E
5000|$|On 16 June 2009, a new {{practical}} {{instrument was}} adopted - the EU-Ukraine <b>Association</b> <b>Agenda.</b> [...] 19 December 2011 EU-Ukraine summit, which {{was intended to}} lead to the signature of the Agreement, fell short due to the EU's concerns over the jailing of former premier Yulia Tymoshenko. The end of negotiations were announced, but the text of the agreement was not signed with EU leaders deciding to wait until the October 2012 Parliamentary elections as a test of the vitality of democracy and rule of law in Ukraine. The AA was initialed shortly thereafter, on 30 March 2012. Before it enters into force it must be ratified by the Ukrainian Parliament, the European Parliament, and each EU member state. However, EU leaders have suggested that the agreement will not be ratified unless Ukraine addresses concerns over a [...] "stark deterioration of democracy and the rule of law", including the imprisonment of Yulia Tymoshenko and Yuriy Lutsenko in 2011 and 2012. In November 2012, EU Commissioner for Enlargement and European Neighbourhood Policy Stefan Fule stated that the AA, and DCFTA, could be signed in November 2013 if the EU's concerns were addressed.|$|E

40|$|This article aims at {{analyzing}} the key results and future {{prospects of the}} Eastern Partnership program of the European Union. Usually the criticism toward this initiative is based on two arguments: allegedly, it was the assertiveness of the EU which contributed to the Ukrainian crisis and increased a conflict potential with Russia. Besides, in the end Brussels {{was not able to}} deliver more in terms of Ukrainian, Moldovan and Georgian integration into the EU and to counterbalance the Russian foreign policy in the region. The author argues that the Eastern Partnership, driven by the “constitutive power of outsiders”, was an adequate answer to the socio-political changes which have occurred in East European countries. It gave them an opportunity, based on the principle of “more for more”, to include themselves in internal EU regimes without formal accession. On the other hand, the Eastern Partnership is currently facing two main challenges: Russian reaction to EU association agreements with Eastern neighbors as well as disintegration and corruption of the elites. Despite some disappointment of the Euro-enthusiasts and the devastating economic crisis in the region, it is still preserving the pro-European orientation and working on the <b>association</b> <b>agenda.</b> But, in the context of substantial problems with corruption, Brussels has now to apply the policy of “sticks” in order to discipline (and not only support or encourage) the neighborhood countries...|$|E
40|$|The {{delegation}} of the European Union to Moldova takes upon itself {{the task of}} {{making the case for}} the <b>Association</b> <b>Agenda</b> between the country and the EU. The European foreign policy in the borderlands of the Union is carried out against the background of the war in Eastern Ukraine. A war of words is being fought in Moldovan media as well. Mostly on Romanian-speaking TV, Pirkka Tapiola, the EU ambassador, is among those who lead the way. At a time of renewed Western concern about Eastern Europe, the media presence of the EU in Moldova reveals anxieties about the future: once again, the former Soviet republic seems to be teetering on the brink of Russian control. The breakaway region of Trans-Dniester and the prospect of default are the two main concerns that the EU mission has to address while speaking the language of European politics in a country battered by corruption, high inflation, and unemployment. The discourse of Pirkka Tapiola, Head of the EU delegation, is an exercise in spokesmanship, which seems to underplay the seriousness of the situation. According to opinion polls conducted recently, the avowedly pro-Russian parties would win the next election. In hindsight, it is possible to surmise that the pro-EU parties pulled off a political coup by deferring the costs incurred during the mandates of the previous government coalitions. Parties whose constituencies are declining stayed in power, while better alternatives have developed: the new names that {{can be found on the}} right wing of the Moldovan political spectrum show that their electorate is ready to embrace the goal of European accession once again...|$|E

40|$|In {{the last}} decade {{there has been a}} growing body of {{research}} literature focusing on ‘stress’ and its effects on humans. Historically much of what has been written regarding stress has not had the insights now available through neuroscientific research which identifies a worrying connection between stress and cognitive impairment. Given these new insights and a greater understanding of the deleterious impact of some forms of stress, it appears axiomatic that emotional wellbeing must be larger part of any learning, and by <b>association,</b> educational <b>agenda.</b> In many respects developmental and educational psychologists have long known the importance of providing safe and supportive learning environments for children in an effort to ensure that schools could be a potential oasis of calm for all students. Yet it would appear that more can and should be done. This paper provides a theoretical foundation examining impact of stress on learning and draws on contemporary neuroscientific research to outline what stress is, how negative stress impacts on the body and mind and why schools may be the optimum sites for buffering the impact of stress, building resilience and enhancing individual capacities for learning...|$|R
40|$|This article {{examines}} how emotional reactions to political events shape public opinion. We analyze political discussions {{in which people}} voluntarily engage online to approximate the public agenda: Online discussions offer a natural approach to the salience of political issues {{and the means to}} analyze emotional reactions as political events take place in real time. We measure shifts in emotions of the public over a period that includes 2 U. S. presidential elections, the 9 / 11 attacks, and the start of military action in Afghanistan and Iraq. Our findings show that emotional reactions to political events help explain approval rates for the same period, which casts novel light on the mechanisms that mediate the <b>association</b> between <b>agenda</b> setting and political evaluations. doi: 10. 1111 /j. 1468 - 2958. 2011. 01423. x Public opinion is a proxy for the way citizens perceive political issues and react to current affairs.

40|$|Drawing on the {{articles}} assembled for this yearbook and related writings, this commentary identifies {{some of the}} issues that warrant consideration as we work to understand interest group politics more fully. The commentary discusses the importance of situating interest groups at the center of the Politics of Educa-tion <b>Association</b> (PEA) research <b>agenda</b> and highlights ways to enhance our understanding of the who, the how, and the so what of interest group politics. THIS YEARBOOK directs attention to an important but understudied aspect of the politics of education, namely the interest groups that regularly or inter-mittently seek to influence education policies and practices. Drawing on the preceding articles and related writings, this article sets forth, in broad brush fashion, {{some of the issues}} that warrant consideration as we work to under-stand interest group politics more fully. 1 What follows is a topical, not a theo-retical, synthesis. The daunting task of lending conceptual coherence to the diverse articles and offering conceptual guidance to those who wish to sys-tematically examine interest groups is taken up by Hanne Mawhinney in the final article of this volume. The present article is confined to the more modest task of discussing the importance of situating interest groups at the center of the Politics of Education <b>Association</b> (PEA) research <b>agenda</b> and highlight-ing ways to enhance our understanding of the who, the how, and the so what of interest group politics. Many of the observations offered are speculative, in part because, as con-tributors to this volume make clear, the empirical base on education-related interest groups is fragile and fragmented. All the observations are suggestive because the literature on interest groups is selectively applied, not compre-hensively reviewed. Although limited in these and other ways, hopefully thi...|$|R

5000|$|Given the American Geography Society's {{long and}} {{intimate}} <b>association</b> with imperial <b>agendas,</b> {{it is perhaps}} {{no surprise that the}} AGS sponsored México Indígena project has been the source of fierce criticism from indigenous organizations in Mexico, not to mention from a student-based group at the University of Kansas—the academic home of Mexico Indígena. Student supporters of KU Watch's critique of México Indígena demonstrated at the University of Kansas to enhance awareness about research conducted at the University funded by the Department of Defense. In response to criticisms raised by the University of Kansas student group KU Watch, Peter Herlihy, a leader of the Bowman Expedition, said that he was [...] "proud to raise the flag and say look at what the government is funding," [...] In addition, Herlihy reported that his research project [...] "empowers indigenous people by putting intellectual property where it belongs." [...] Moreover, he noted that [...] "Geographical intelligence is needed for peace and prosperity just like it is needed for war and destruction,".

40|$|This book {{examines}} some of {{the underlying}} principles and approaches which underpin e-learning in today’s higher education. It takes a critical lens to both policy and practice at the micro and macro level, exploring how e-learning and its <b>association</b> with broader <b>agendas</b> concerning teaching and learning in higher education is reconfiguring what counts as learning in today’s university. This provides a backdrop for challenging {{some of the}} more dominant approaches in the field of e-learning and presenting a unique perspective drawn from studies of language, literacies and learning. In so doing, the volume raises questions {{about the ways in which}} theories of social constructivism, collaborative learning and learning communities have tended to take centre stage in the field. It suggests that this has resulted in very little attention to the production and negotiation of the specific and contextualised texts and practices which are central to these learning environments. Through single and joint-authored contributions the authors develop a case for locating the concept of e-learning within a language and literacies based account of teaching and learning which foregrounds the social practices of the university, its literacies and discourses, and the ways in which these interplay with technologies. The authors contrast their approach, which pays attention to the broader institutional context of learning, with those which focus only on the individual learner’s engagement with the technologies. The book explicates the principles being explored through detailed case studies which are designed to help practitioners think through how they might be able to adopt such an approach in their own work. It also looks forward to how the literacies perspective that is being proposed will be particularly appropriate in the light of developments in the use of social media for learning...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{qualitative}} case {{study was to examine}} a major Pennsylvania high school reform initiative: Project 720. Through document review and interviews, the author found that Pennsylvania allocated $ 40 million to 143 school districts in an attempt to transform Pennsylvania high schools into child-centered, small learning communities focused on 21 st Century learning skills. This study examined the design, implementation, and sustainability of Project 720. This study posed three research questions: (1) What events {{led to the development of}} Project 720 ? (2) How was Project 720 implemented? (3) What is the status of Project 702 ?The focus for Pennsylvania's high school reform began during the 2005 National Governors' <b>Association</b> conference. The <b>agenda</b> for the conference was a need for high school reform. Along with the nation's governors, the nation's business leaders represented by the National Business Roundtable and the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation identified a need for high school reform. As a result of this conference Pennsylvania developed Project 720. Project 720 focused on several factors, those being; (1) poor performance on standardized tests, (2) lack of rigor in the high school curriculum, (3) lack of career preparation, and (4) concern regarding the rate of students not completing high school in four years. Implementation of Project 720 was difficult to determine. Lacking available documents, there continues to be an ambiguity regarding how Project 720 funds were allocated. This confusing allocation of funds coupled with a lack of information regarding an auditing procedure of grantee funds left the investigator to speculate how allocated funds were used for Project 720. This study concluded that there are very few formal reports regarding the sustained efforts of Project 720. Pennsylvania's 2011 proposed budget contains no funding for Project 720, or any other identified high school reform effort. Therefore, it is crucial that Project 720 funded school districts build capacity to sustain high school reform. The value of $ 40 million of Pennsylvania State grants depends on how well Project 720 districts implemented activities that improved education and how well districts ensured funding to sustain those implemented activities...|$|R
