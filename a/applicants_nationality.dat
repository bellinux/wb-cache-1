Applicants for a residence permit as entrepreneur do require an entry clearance visa before coming to the Netherlands unless this requirement is waived due the <b>applicants</b> <b>nationality</b> or previous legal residence. Those who need the entry clearance visa are at a disadvantage. They must await the outcome of their application abroad, although short visits {{on the basis of a}} business visa might be permitted. Those who are in the Netherlands awaiting the outcome may begin doing business which will increase their chances of a successful application as for them it is easier to participate in local networks and fulfil the evidentiary requirements. It can be rather lengthy procedures, easily running up to six months. The application fee for facilitators is € 2.672 and for each individual startup residence permit € 401. The fee for entrepreneurs is € 1.336, which is considered steep. 42 The 2016 report concluded, amongst others, that transparency on the material criteria and on the procedures was lacking. A trader in Dutch scrap metal wanted to export this for processing to Dubai. His business plan looked solid and the municipal Rotterdam Investment Agency assisted in his search for office space. He required an entry clearance visa but he did not apply for it as required. He kept traveling on temporary Schengen visas granted by other EU countries. In the end, the authorities, both local and national, dropped their support for him and the application was denied on procedural grounds. Another practical obstacle was that Economic Affairs didn’t have access to the Immigration Authorities files. Some of these practical issues have been dealt with since by improving the relevant websites and opening up direct communication between Economic Affairs and the applicant. 43 [...]...|$|E

40|$|Early Predictability of Asylum Court Decisions with M. Dunn and L. Sagun In the United States, foreign {{nationals}} who fear persecution {{in their home}} country can apply for asylum under the Refugee Act of 1980. Unfortunately, over the past decade, legal scholarship has uncovered significant disparities in asylum adjudication by judge, by region of the United States in which the application is filed, and by the <b>applicant’s</b> <b>nationality.</b> These disparities raise concerns about whether applicants are receiving equal treatment before the law. Using machine learning to predict judges’ decisions, we document another concern that may violate our notions of justice: significant variation among the degree of predictability of judges {{at the time the}} case is assigned to a judge. Highly predictable judges are those who almost always grant or deny asylum. Our predictive model corroborates prior work as the final outcome of the case is overwhelmingly driven by the adjudicating judge and the <b>applicant’s</b> <b>nationality.</b> We are able to predict the final outcome of a case with 80 % accuracy at the time the case opens. Additionally, this study shows that highly predictable judges tend to make use of fewer hearing sessions before making their decision. The contribution of this study is twofold. First, early prediction of a case with 80 % accuracy could assist asylum seeker in their process of application. Secondly, by demonstrating the variation of predictability among the judges, based solely on a minimal subset of case information, this study raises questions about whether the specifics of each case are being given their due weight in asylum adjudications...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{addresses}} {{the problem of}} home mortgage lending discrimination {{in one of the}} richest areas of northern Italy, characterized by a strong political support for xenophobic and racist right-wing parties. We conducted interviews with employees of the Varese city hospital to study their perception (or experience) of discriminatory behavior related to home financing. For each individual we have collected information on possible sources of discrimination (e. g., gender, country/region of origin, and family size) and creditworthiness (e. g., income, profession, and age). The analysis follows two steps. The first evaluates self-selection (i. e., the probability that individuals apply), and the second focuses on the likelihood that applications are accepted by the bank. Findings show that discrimination is likely to appear when the <b>applicant’s</b> <b>nationality</b> and/or area of origin are considered...|$|R

40|$|This is {{the author}} {{accepted}} manuscript. The final version is available from Wiley via the DOI in this record. Rising immigration rates in Western Europe concur with increasing anti-immigrant attitudes. While assessments of welfare eligibility in the United States demonstrably hinge on how public servants perceive different racial groups as deserving, we know less about ethnically motivated discrimination in the European context. This paper argues that Switzerland is a critical case for studying such developments. It combines social construction theory and the deservingness heuristic to analyze how social constructions of Swiss natives and immigrants influence 90 disability benefits insurance procedures. Findings reveal that immigrants are perceived as less deserving and less powerful than Swiss applicants. Thus, Swiss welfare workers do not allocate welfare benefits independently of an <b>applicant's</b> <b>nationality.</b> Our results raise fundamental questions about the equal treatment of welfare applicants in times of rising immigration and anti-immigrant attitudes. The feed-forward effects of social constructions imply longer-term consequences for good administrative practices and society that require scholarly attention...|$|R

500|$|There {{are many}} {{opportunities}} for students at Oxford to receive financial help during their studies. The Oxford Opportunity Bursaries, introduced in 2006, are university-wide means-based bursaries available to any British undergraduate. With a total possible grant of £10,235 over a 3-year degree, {{it is the most}} generous bursary scheme offered by any British university. In addition, individual colleges also offer bursaries and funds to help their students. For graduate study, there are many scholarships attached to the university, available to students from all sorts of backgrounds, from Rhodes Scholarships to the relatively new Weidenfeld Scholarships. Oxford also offers the Clarendon Scholarship which is open to graduate <b>applicants</b> of all <b>nationalities.</b> The Clarendon Scholarship is principally funded by Oxford University Press in association with colleges and other partnership awards. In 2016, Oxford University announced that it is to run its first free online economics course as part of a “massive open online course" [...] (Mooc) scheme, in partnership with a US online university network.

40|$|The paper {{begins with}} a {{discussion}} of the nature and relationship of trade marks to patents. We ask whether trade marks should be classed as market improving intellectual property (IP) or as private intangible assets. Our empirical aims are to document the acquisition of these two kinds of IP by UK firms and to investigate the Schumpeterian relationship between firm size and IP. We use a newly constructed data set which traces firm ownership of IP both directly and via subsidiary companies. We begin by looking at trends in IP protection by all <b>applicants</b> of any <b>nationality</b> in Britain and Europe in comparison with known trends for the USA. There was considerable similarity across all the measures and across geographical areas in the rank order of IP by product class, although consumer product groups were more represented in trade marks, whereas production technology is more important in patents. These features suggest common global patterns of demand and technological activity. However very different time trends are observed for British patent publications, which fell while all other indicators rose; furthermore chemical products moved down the rank order, in contrast to remaining a principal group for patents in Europe...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background International medical students, those {{attending}} medical school {{outside of their}} country of citizenship, account for a growing proportion of medical undergraduates worldwide. This study aimed to establish the fairness, predictive validity and acceptability of Multiple Mini Interview (MMI) in an internationally diverse student population. Methods This was an explanatory sequential, mixed methods study. All students in First Year Medicine, National University of Ireland Galway 2012 were eligible to sit a previously validated 10 station MMI. Quantitative data comprised: demographics, selection tool scores and First Year Assessment scores. Qualitative data comprised separate focus groups with MMI Assessors, EU and Non-EU students. Results 109 students participated (45 % of class). Of this 41. 3 % (n = 45) were Non-EU and 35. 8 % (n = 39) did not have English as first language. Age, gender and socioeconomic class did not impact on MMI scores. Non-EU students and those for whom English was not a first language achieved significantly lower scores on MMI than their EU and English speaking counterparts (difference in mean 11. 9 % and 12. 2 % respectively, P< 0. 001). MMI score was associated with English language proficiency (IELTS) (r = 0. 5, P< 0. 01). Correlations emerged between First Year results and IELTS (r = 0. 44; p = 0. 006; n = 38) and EU school exit exam (r = 0. 52; p< 0. 001; n = 56). MMI predicted EU student OSCE performance (r = 0. 27; p = 0. 03; n = 64). In the analysis of focus group data two overarching themes emerged: Authenticity and Cultural Awareness. MMI was considered a highly authentic assessment that offered {{a deeper understanding of}} the applicant than traditional tools, with an immediate relevance to clinical practice. Cultural specificity of some stations and English language proficiency were seen to disadvantage international students. Recommendations included cultural awareness training for MMI assessors, designing and piloting culturally neutral stations, lengthening station duration and providing high quality advance information to candidates. Conclusion MMI is a welcome addition to assessment armamentarium for selection, particularly with regard to stakeholder acceptability. Understanding the mediating and moderating influences for differences in performance of international candidates is essential to ensure that MMI complies with the metrics of good assessment practice and principles of both distributive and procedural justice for all <b>applicants,</b> irrespective of <b>nationality</b> and cultural background...|$|R
40|$|Integration of {{immigrants}} into the receiving societies has already long ago been acknowledged as fundamental {{for both the}} well-being of the immigrants and the welfare of the receiving states. While much of researchers’ attention is dedicated to immigrants’ acculturation, labour market integration {{of immigrants}} is less focused on, especially when it concerns immigrant professionals. Although successful labour market integration depends partially on immigrants themselves, it is nevertheless, a bilateral process and members of the receiving societies may either facilitate it or interfere with it. This study, anchored {{in the context of the}} European Union and its eastward expansion in 2004, approaches the problem of immigrants’ labour market integration by investigating the attitudes of the Finnish national majority towards employment of dentists trained in other EU member states (the EU 15 vs. the A 8 group). The study is based on data from 99 dentistry students; the data was collected during a field experiment conducted throughout 2011. The theoretical framework of this study is based on the SIT paradigm, but it also accommodates findings on the labour market outcomes of the A 8 immigrants in the EU 15 member states, and the ethnic hierarchies in Finland. There are two foci of interest: (1) whether national in-group identification of participants has an effect on their willingness to employ an applicant (the national in-group or out-group member), and (2) whether a specific EU <b>nationality</b> of an <b>applicant</b> (the EU 15 vs. the A 8 nationality) affects participants’ recruitment choices. The assumptions of SIT are partly supported by the results. It was found that the participants in general did not favour their national in-group applicant over the foreign applicants. This effect, however, depended on the specific EU <b>nationality</b> of an <b>applicant</b> and whereas the national in-group applicant was not favoured over the EU 15 applicant, he was favoured over the A 8 group applicant. Contrary to the expectations, national in-group identification did not have an effect on the participants’ willingness to employ either a national in-group or out-group <b>applicant.</b> Specific EU <b>nationality,</b> as expected, was an important factor affecting the participants’ recruitment decision: When juxtaposed with each other, the EU 15 applicant was favoured over the A 8 group applicant. The findings of this study, identifying nationality of EU immigrant professionals to be an important factor in recruitment and, therefore, in the process of immigrants’ labour market integration in another EU member state, have revealed a vivid problem of the contemporary EU which nevertheless, has so far not been addressed. In this thesis it is argued that A 8 citizens are not regarded by EU 15 citizens as in-group members on any supra-national level, including the supra-national level of the EU and, therefore, they are discriminated against as out-group members...|$|R
