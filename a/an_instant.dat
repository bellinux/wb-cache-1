5|$|The {{game has}} a tension gauge, {{increasing}} when a character causes damage or moves toward an adversary and decreasing when a character moves backwards or is {{stopped for a}} long time. When the gauge is half-charged a player can use specials called Overdrive Attacks, which cause more damage than regular moves. A full gauge allows a player to make <b>an</b> <b>Instant</b> Kill, defeating an opponent regardless of health; if <b>an</b> <b>Instant</b> Kill is unsuccessful, the tension gauge will not charge {{for the remainder of}} that round.|$|E

5|$|In the meantime, Romeo and Juliet {{was finally}} staged by the Kirov Ballet, choreographed by Leonid Lavrovsky, on 11 January 1940. To the {{surprise}} of all of its participants, the dancers having struggled {{to cope with the}} music's syncopated rhythms and almost having boycotted the production, the ballet was <b>an</b> <b>instant</b> success, and became recognised as the crowning achievement of Soviet dramatic ballet.|$|E

5|$|The part became Hordern's first paid role as {{an actor}} for a theatre company. The play was <b>an</b> <b>instant</b> hit and ran at the People's Theatre in Mile End for two weeks.

This allowed Hordern to take his place for which Daltry paid Hordern an extra £1 a week.|$|E

5|$|Edward Duffy, an {{associate}} professor at Marquette University, says that one of the central characters of Chamber of Secrets is a book, Tom Riddle's enchanted diary, which takes control of Ginny Weasley – just as Riddle planned. Duffy suggests that Rowling intended this as a warning against passively consuming information from sources that have their own agendas. Although Bronwyn Williams and Amy Zenger regard the diary as more like <b>an</b> <b>instant</b> messaging or chat room system, they agree about the dangers of relying too much on the written word, which can camouflage the author, and they highlight a comical example, Lockhart's self-promoting books.|$|E

5|$|Firearms combat is first-person, with {{character}} points {{assigned to}} the firearms skill determining the shot's accuracy {{and how long it}} takes to target an opponent. Melee combat is third-person, with access to weapons such as katanas and sledgehammers for melee combat, or pistols, crossbows and flamethrowers for firearm combat. If a player sneaks up on an opponent, they can perform <b>an</b> <b>instant</b> kill; weapons provide unique instant kill animations. The player can block attacks manually or automatically, by leaving their character idle. They can use stealth in missions by sneaking past guards and security cameras, picking locks, and hacking computers to locate alternative routes.|$|E
5|$|For Bradford, it was {{the first}} time they had played at Wembley in their 93-year history. City {{finished}} sixth during the regular league season only winning a play-off place with a victory on the final day of the season. They came from two goals down during the semi-finals against Blackpool to gain a place in the play-off final. Having been relegated the previous season, Notts County had the chance to win <b>an</b> <b>instant</b> promotion back to the First Division. They finished fourth during the regular season and defeated Crewe Alexandra in the semi-final by drawing the away tie and winning by one-goal in the second leg at home.|$|E
5|$|FreeBSD {{has several}} unique {{features}} related to storage. Soft updates can protect {{the consistency of}} the UFS filesystem (widely used on the BSDs) {{in the event of a}} system crash. Filesystem snapshots allow an image of a UFS filesystem at <b>an</b> <b>instant</b> in time to be efficiently created. Snapshots allow reliable backup of a live filesystem. GEOM is a modular framework that provides RAID (levels 0, 1, 3 currently), full disk encryption, journaling, concatenation, caching, and access to network-backed storage. GEOM allows building of complex storage solutions combining ("chaining") these mechanisms.|$|E

5|$|Horses are prey {{animals with}} a strong fight-or-flight response. Their first {{reaction}} to threat is to startle and usually flee, although they will stand their ground and defend themselves when flight is impossible or if their young are threatened. They {{also tend to be}} curious; when startled, they will often hesitate <b>an</b> <b>instant</b> to ascertain the cause of their fright, and may not always flee from something that they perceive as non-threatening. Most light horse riding breeds were developed for speed, agility, alertness and endurance; natural qualities that extend from their wild ancestors. However, through selective breeding, some breeds of horses are quite docile, particularly certain draft horses.|$|E
5|$|Immediately {{upon the}} {{conclusion}} of the sketch, writer Michael O'Donoghue knew it was <b>an</b> <b>instant</b> success. He had been watching the Saturday Night Live performance from beside the set, off-camera. He felt that Belushi had performed his role as Captain Kirk perfectly. As soon as Belushi left the set, O'Donoghue went over to him and gave the actor a congratulatory hug. On reflection, after the live performance, O'Donoghue stated that Belushi had performed a perfect parody of Shatner as Kirk. Belushi felt it was one of his most satisfying performances.|$|E
5|$|In May 1986, George Graham was {{appointed}} as Arsenal manager. He made <b>an</b> <b>instant</b> impact, guiding {{his team to}} League Cup success, and the club finished fourth in the Football League First Division. Arsenal however slipped to sixth in the league the following season, and lost out to Luton Town in the League Cup final a year later. Graham sought to resolve inconsistencies by freshening up his squad, promoting number of academy graduates while selling ageing players. By the summer of 1988, he achieved a blend of youth and experience, but little was thought of Arsenal's chances of winning the First Division.|$|E
