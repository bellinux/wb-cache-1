Walcott offers Atom Egoyan a story idea about [...] "a news anchor, who's shot in the head, is {{in a coma for}} two years, but survives with a bullet lodged in his brain, and then struggles to return to his news desk." [...] After Egoyan says to Walcott that he read <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>thing</b> happening to Walcott, Walcott seems surprised and says, [...] "yeah, there is a parallel there somewhere." ...|$|E

40|$|The {{challenges}} and decline in {{sales of the}} personal computer (PC) are discussed. The research findings show the folly of assuming current non-adopters care <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>things</b> as innovators and early adopters, or assuming that all they care about is PC cost. While cost may be a factor for those still holding out, it is neither the only nor the most important factor. Instead, later adopters want long-lasting products {{that have yet to}} appear on the horizon. Until the PC industry convinces this group of potential consumers that their PC will operate like a refrigerator, PC sales are likely to continue in their current stalled state...|$|R

Do you {{remember}} the story of Conachar in the 'Fair Maid of Perth;'--how his heart refused to give him blood enough to fight?

It isn't as if birthdays were common things, Marilla. Prissy Andrews is going to recite 'Curfew Must Not Ring Tonight.' That is such a good moral piece, Marilla, I'm sure it would do me lots of good to hear it. And the choir are going to sing four lovely pathetic songs that are pretty near as good as hymns. And oh, Marilla, the minister is going to take part; yes, indeed, he is; he's going to give an address. That will be just <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>thing</b> as a sermon. Please, mayn't I go, Marilla?" ...|$|E
5000|$|A+ {{began his}} music career in 1995, {{after winning a}} {{national}} talent competition sponsored by Def Jam Records. He was the first act signed to Kedar Massenburg's record label, Kedar Entertainment. According to Massenburg, the A+ moniker [...] "means that he's striving for perfection, and he's not really talking <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>things</b> as other young rappers." [...] In 1996, {{at the age of}} 14, A+ released his first album, The Latch-Key Child, which featured contributions from AZ, Mobb Deep and Q-Tip. [...] "All I See" [...] was chosen as the lead single, and it peaked at number 66 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart, staying for 14 weeks.|$|R
5000|$|Lyrically {{the album}} {{contains}} elements including depressing emotions, anger and recovery. Explaining to MTV, Bennington said: [...] "We don't talk about situations, we talk <b>about</b> <b>the</b> emotions behind the situations. Mike and I {{are two different}} people, so we can't sing <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>things,</b> but we both know about frustration and anger and loneliness and love and happiness, and we can relate on that level." [...] In <b>the</b> <b>same</b> interview, Shinoda explained it as: [...] "What {{we really wanted to}} do was just push ourselves and push each other to really find new ways to be creative." [...] He continued: [...] "We wanted each sample that was in each song to be something that might perk your ear - something that you might not have ever heard before." ...|$|R

Last winter, when Prue made me go about, though people {{probably}} thought me a stupid little thing, moping in corners, I was enjoying myself {{in my own}} way, and making discoveries that have been very useful ever since. I know I'm whimsical, and hard to please, and have no doubt the fault was in myself, but I was disappointed in nearly every one I met, though I went into what Prue calls 'our best society.' The girls seemed all made on <b>the</b> <b>same</b> pattern; they all said, did, thought, and wore <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>things,</b> and knowing one {{was as good as}} knowing a dozen.

I find speaking here and elsewhere <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>thing.</b> I was about as badly scared, and no worse as I am when I speak in court. I expect to make one within a week or two, in which I hope to succeed well enough to wish you to see it.|$|E
6000|$|Sunday Morning, June 11.--We pass'd down Lake Huron {{yesterday}} and last night, and between 4 and 5 o'clock {{this morning we}} ran on the [...] "flats," [...] and have been vainly trying, {{with the aid of}} a steam tug and a lumbering lighter, to get clear again. The day is beautiful and the water clear and calm. Night before last we stopt at Mackinaw, (the island and town,) and I went up on the old fort, one of the oldest stations in the Northwest. We expect to get to Buffalo by to-morrow. The tug has fasten'd lines to us, but some have been snapt and the others have no effect. We seem to be firmly imbedded in the sand. (With the exception of a larger boat and better accommodations, it amounts to <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>thing</b> as a becalmment I underwent on the Montauk voyage, East Long Island, last summer.) Later.--We are off again--expect to reach Detroit before dinner.|$|E

These velvet carpets on my floor have been in {{constant}} wear for ten years, and look how they wear! I never have an ingrain carpet in my house,--not even on the chambers. Velvet and Brussels cost more to begin with, but then they last. Then I cannot recommend the fashion that is creeping in of having plate instead of solid silver. Plate wears off, and has to be renewed, which comes to <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>thing</b> in the end as if you bought all solid at first. If I were beginning as Marianne is, I should just set aside a thousand dollars for my silver, and be content with a few plain articles. She should buy all her furniture at Messrs. David & Saul's. People call them dear, but their work will prove cheapest in the end, and there is an air and style about their things that can be told anywhere. Of course, you won't go to any extravagant lengths,--simplicity is a grace of itself." ...|$|E

"It's {{very easy}} to teach the University of Chicago because the {{students}} are so good, they all have questions, {{and they all have}} things to say," [...] describes Santana about his teaching experiences. [...] "The hardest thing in humanities is to teach how to be critical about what you read. We can all gather information and write a nice paper, but to present an original point of view is not just a collection of other people's ideas; {{you need to be able}} to point out others' weaknesses and strengths and integrate them into an argument of your own." [...] Santana further references the critically acclaimed Craft of Research to support and guide his argument, as he places an emphasis on careful reading of texts. [...] "Two novels can talk <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>things</b> very differently--it's <b>the</b> way they talk that can make them interesting to us." ...|$|R
40|$|Psychological {{and spiritual}} {{support of the}} dying patient {{involves}} establishing a relationship of trust, which requires special communication skills. Health professionals are not usually trained in these skills {{and they tend to}} dissociate themselves from dying patients and their relatives. An analysis of the communication proses enables us to improve our own pattern of communication. Firstly, counselling requires that we direct our attention — by eye contact, our position, listening and conversation. Various techniques may be used to improve conversation, {{such as the use of}} open and closed questions and paraphrasing. One must also be aware of the role of non-verbal communication. Secondly, confrontation is a technique used to stimulate exploration of topics which the patient is avoiding. The dying person is still a living human being and we should talk to him <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>things</b> and for <b>the</b> <b>same</b> reasons we would talk to anyone else — because we are interested in him as a person...|$|R
40|$|Popular {{products}} often attract {{an astonishing}} number of user reviews. Sifting through {{them by the}} thousands can be quite a headache, one that has inspired solutions like unique phrase identification (e. g., Yelp) and helpfulness ratings (e. g., Amazon). While clearly useful, these techniques only capitalize on a small subset of the reviews, and cannot an- swer questions like, ???do these people care <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>things</b> I care <b>about????</b> Talking Points is our solution to these problems. It employs natural language methods to summa- rize thousands of user reviews into a navigable, browser- based interface. In addition to describing our novel algo- rithm for feature extraction and sentiment classification, this paper {{presents the results of}} an exploratory user study of Talking Points. Our study suggests that users explore reviews far longer with Talking Points than with traditional methods. More surprisingly, in randomized sessions users seemed persuaded to choose those products augmented with Talking Points.

It would truly have been a pity to miss it; for here, on the basement floor, are the original models of Chantrey's busts and statues, great and small; and in the rooms above are a far richer treasure,--a large collection of original drawings by Raphael and Michael Angelo. These are far better for my purpose than their finished pictures,--that is to say, they bring me much closer to the hands that drew them and the minds that imagined them. It is like looking into their brains, and seeing the first conception before it took shape outwardly (I have somewhere else said <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>thing</b> of such sketches). I noticed one of Raphael's drawings, representing the effect of eloquence; it was a man speaking in the centre of a group, between whose ears and the orator's mouth connecting lines were drawn. Raphael's idea must have been to compose his picture {{in such a way that}} their auricular organs should not fail to be in a proper relation with the eloquent voice; and though this relation would not have been individually traceable in the finished picture, yet the general effect--that of deep and entranced attention--would have been produced.|$|E

But he isn't afraid of Eugenio. Eugenio's a splendid courier, but he can't make much {{impression}} on Randolph! I don't believe he'll go to bed before eleven." [...] It appeared that Randolph's vigil was in fact triumphantly prolonged, for Winterbourne strolled about with the young girl for some time without meeting her mother. [...] "I have been looking round for that lady you want to introduce me to," [...] his companion resumed. [...] "She's your aunt." [...] Then, on Winterbourne's admitting the fact and expressing some curiosity as to how she had learned it, she said she had heard all about Mrs. Costello from the chambermaid. She was very quiet and very comme il faut; she wore white puffs; she spoke to no one, and she never dined at the table d'hote. Every two days she had a headache. [...] "I think that's a lovely description, headache and all!" [...] said Miss Daisy, chattering along in her thin, gay voice. [...] "I want to know her ever so much. I know just what YOUR aunt would be; I know I should like her. She would be very exclusive. I like a lady to be exclusive; I'm dying to be exclusive myself. Well, we ARE exclusive, mother and I.

60|$|The madman is not he that {{defies the}} world. The saint, the criminal, the martyr, the cynic, the nihilist may all defy the world quite sanely. And even if such fanatics {{would destroy the}} world, the world owes them a {{strictly}} fair trial according to proof and public law. But the madman is not the man who defies the world; {{he is the man}} who denies it. Suppose we are all standing round a field and looking at a tree in the middle of it. It is perfectly true that we all see it (as the decadents say) in infinitely different aspects: that is not the point; the point is that we all say it is a tree. Suppose, if you will, that we are all poets, which seems improbable; so that each of us could turn his aspect into a vivid image distinct from a tree. Suppose one says it looks like a green cloud and another like a green fountain, and a third like a green dragon and the fourth like a green cheese. The fact remains: that they all say it looks like these things. It is a tree. Nor are any of the poets in the least mad because of any opinions they may form, however frenzied, about the functions or future of the tree. A conservative poet may wish to clip the tree; a revolutionary poet may wish to burn it. An optimist poet may want to make it a Christmas tree and hang candles on it. A pessimist poet may want to hang himself on it. None of these are mad, because they are all talking <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>thing.</b> But there is another man who is talking horribly about something else. There is a monstrous exception to mankind. Why he is so we know not; a new theory says it is heredity; an older theory says it is devils. But in any case, the spirit of it is the spirit that denies, the spirit that really denies realities. This is the man who looks at the tree and does not say it looks like a lion, but says that it is a lamp-post.|$|E
