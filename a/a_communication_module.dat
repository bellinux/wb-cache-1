40|$|Abstract—The aim of {{this paper}} is to present the {{implementation}} of an activity recognition system based on a data acquisition system with inertial sensors. One of the requirement of data acquisition systems used in human activity recognition is their level of acceptability or their level of obstruction [2, 4]. Starting from this important requirement, we designed a few wearable data acquisition systems using inertial sensors. The idea from which we started, takes into account the need to obtain more complete information about the studied human subject, in complex activities recognition systems. In our experiment we used inertial sensor built into so called “ 9 DOF inertial module”. Our systems contain, on the wearable side, a maximum of three inertial sensors, a microcontroller module, and <b>a</b> <b>communication</b> <b>module</b> which can be one of the three solutions. For data reception, on the fixed part of the system, we have <b>a</b> <b>communication</b> <b>module</b> corresponding to the one on wearable parts and a microcontroller module connected to a PC through a serial port.
