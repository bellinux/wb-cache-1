5|$|The Shortest Way {{with the}} Dissenters; or, Proposals for the Establishment of the Church is a {{pamphlet}} consisting of twenty-nine pages. It opens with the fable of the Cock and the Horses. The Cock, lacking any perch in the stable, {{is forced to}} rest on the ground and in fear of the Horses moving around <b>and</b> <b>stepping</b> on him, advises: “Pray, Gentlefolks! let us stand still! for fear we should tread upon one another!” The speaker then applies this to the contemporary situation, with the Cock representing the Dissenters.|$|E
5|$|Written by Joseph Lidster. A story idea {{considered}} for {{the third and fourth}} episodes of the fourth series. It was based upon the notion of 'faces' which people {{used to be able to}} see in patterned wallpaper. While redecorating, one of the Bannerman Road gang was to strip some paint off a wall and reveal old wallpaper underneath. Faces would appear on the wallpaper; these would be aliens from another dimension trying to arrive on Earth, literally taking shape in walls <b>and</b> <b>stepping</b> through. It was noted that this notion could be adapted for patterns in wooden floors and doors.|$|E

25|$|On {{the stone}} wall, (in {{the same way}} as Milecastles,) {{additional}} structures known as Wing Walls were incorporated on the east and west side, allowing bonding to the curtain wall. This is interpreted as evidence that turrets (and milecastles) were constructed before the curtain wall. Where turrets were built with the intention of bonding to a broad gauge curtain wall, they were given broad wing walls. However, there are many cases where the curtain wall actually constructed was of narrow gauge, giving a point of reduction where the curtain wall and turret wing walls join. To facilitate bonding with the curtain wall, wing walls were constructed longer at the base, <b>and</b> <b>stepping</b> inwards as they were built upwards. Turrets thought to have been constructed later in the plan were built with much shorter wing walls.|$|E

25|$|Aitken's 1829 map {{gives the}} name as both South and West Lamberton on {{different}} pages. The farm is not {{marked on the}} Pont's (1604) or Armstrong's (1775) map. The farm does not appear on Ainslie's 1821 map, however it does appears on Thomson's 1828 map, with Townhead of Lambroughton next to it, known as Lambroughtonhead in the Montgomerie Estate plans. Lambroughtonend Farm no longer exists, having been replaced by East lambroughton. A lane which ran down to a ford across the river Annick at Bankend. John Allan and his wife Margaret Hunter lived here in the 19th century. John died, aged 67 in 1885 and was buried in Dreghorn Parish churchyard.

25|$|Pachelbel's {{large-scale}} vocal {{works are}} mostly written in modern style influenced by Italian Catholic music, {{with only a}} few non-concerted pieces and old plainchant cantus firmus techniques employed very infrequently. The string ensemble is typical for the time, three viols and two violins. The former are either used to provide harmonic content in instrumental sections or to double the vocal lines in tutti sections; the violins either engage in contrapuntal textures of varying density or are employed for ornamentation. Distinct features of Pachelbel's vocal writing in these pieces, {{aside from the fact that}} it is almost always very strongly tonal, include frequent use of permutation fugues and writing for paired voices. The Magnificat settings, most composed during Pachelbel's late Nuremberg years, are influenced by the Italian-Viennese style and distinguish themselves from their antecedents by treating the canticle in a variety of ways <b>and</b> <b>stepping</b> away from text-dependent composition.|$|E
25|$|Moving to Wainiha Valley, Kauai, Hawaii, for {{the third}} season, a number of {{production}} problems were encountered, including difficulties in obtaining location permits, torrential rains, muddy conditions, and mosquitoes. It had 21 episodes including casting specials showing the selection process. One of the contestants, Rachel Lofton of the Red team, {{is the daughter of}} Pro Football Hall of Famer and San Diego Chargers coach James Lofton.There were many twists including bringing back six eliminated players, after the right to stay, to compete in a challenge to become an official endurance player. The winner would choose someone from the opposite sex and they would become the Brown Team. Tom won and chose Vanetta as his partner. Later, Vanetta injured her knee: while walking outside of her hut <b>and</b> <b>stepping</b> down, she cut her leg on a piece of bamboo. The cut required more than 20 stitches, and she was removed from the game, making Tom the first person in Endurance to be a one-person team. Also, he {{was the first person to}} go to the Temple of Fate without a partner.|$|E

25|$|NBC's {{requests}} {{became more}} unreasonable and the O'Brien camp refused them, {{such as the}} right to pull any of his final shows if the network objected to the content (i.e., a joke about the conflict/NBC). Jeffrey Immelt, GE chairman, questioned why they were paying so much for a performer destined to run to another network. Negotiations continued on into O'Brien's final week; he could not confirm on-air it was indeed his final week of shows, which produced difficulty in booking the guests he desired for his final show. On January 19, multiple media outlets reported that O'Brien and NBC were close to signing a deal between US$30 and US$40 million for the host {{to walk away from the}} network. Following his Wednesday, January 20 edition, O'Brien remained at the studio until the early hours of the morning, alongside Ross and the legal counsel, trying to finalize the settlement. O'Brien wandered off, playing his guitar alone <b>and</b> <b>stepping</b> out on the deserted Universal lot at midnight, attempting to make sense of the situation. Meanwhile, Ron Meyer passingly suggested to Zucker and Gaspin, based off the public outcry, that they should stick with O'Brien; the two executives agreed to send him on his way. O'Brien signed the agreement that night and the following day the terms were made public.|$|E

40|$|Objectives: To investigate: (i) the intra-rater, inter-rater and test-retest reliabilities of {{completion}} times <b>and</b> <b>step</b> counts on the Standardized Walking Obstacle Course test (SWOC); (ii) correlations between SWOC scores and stroke-specific impairments; (iii) the cut-off SWOC completion times <b>and</b> <b>step</b> counts for distinguishing differences in obstacle negotiation ability {{in people with}} chronic stroke and healthy older adults. Design: Cross-sectional study. Setting: University-based rehabilitation centre. Subjects: Twenty-nine people with stroke and 30 healthy older adults. Methods: SWOC completion times <b>and</b> <b>step</b> counts were measured under 3 conditions: (i) normal walking; (ii) walking with a tray; and (iii) walking with dark-glasses. The Fugl-Meyer Assessment of lower extremity, the Five-Times-Sit-to-Stand Test, the Berg Balance Scale, the Timed Up and Go Test (TUG), and the Community Integration Measure questionnaire, were also administered. Results: SWOC completion times <b>and</b> <b>step</b> counts showed very satisfactory to excellent reliabilities (intraclass correlation coefficient; ICC[*]=[*] 0. 851 – 0. 993). TUG times correlated significantly with SWOC completion times <b>and</b> <b>step</b> counts under the 3 conditions (r[*]=[*] 0. 586 – 0. 815, p[*]< 0. 001). SWOC completion times of 14. 73 – 16. 00 s <b>and</b> <b>step</b> counts of 23. 06 – 24. 13, depending on different walking conditions, were able to discriminate between stroke survivors and healthy older adults.

40|$|The {{effects of}} gait speed <b>and</b> <b>step</b> length on the {{required}} {{coefficient of friction}} (COF) confound the investigation of age-related differences in required COF. The goals {{of this study were}} to investigate whether age differences in required COF during self-selected gait persist when experimentally-controlling speed <b>and</b> <b>step</b> length, <b>and</b> to determine the independent effects of speed <b>and</b> <b>step</b> length on required COF. Ten young and 10 older healthy adults performed gait trials under five gait conditions: self-selected, slow and fast speeds without controlling <b>step</b> length, <b>and</b> slow and fast speeds while controlling step length. During self-selected gait, older adults walked with shorter <b>step</b> lengths <b>and</b> exhibited a lower required COF. Older adults also exhibited a lower required COF when walking at a controlled speed without controlling step length. When both age groups walked with the same speed <b>and</b> <b>step</b> length, no age difference in required COF was found. Thus, speed <b>and</b> <b>step</b> length can have a large influence on studies investigating age-related differences in required COF. It was also found that speed <b>and</b> <b>step</b> length have independent and opposite effects on required COF, with step length having a strong positive effect on required COF, and speed having a weaker negative effect.
