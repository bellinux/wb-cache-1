50|$|This {{butterfly}} can {{be distinguished}} from the rather similar Lapland ringlet (Erebia embla) and the <b>Arctic</b> <b>ringlet</b> (Erebia disa) {{by the fact that}} it has white blotches on the under surfaces of the hindwing and those butterflies do not. It can also be distinguished from the <b>Arctic</b> <b>ringlet</b> {{by the fact that it}} always has eyespots on its hindwings while the upperside of the Arctic ringlet's wings are plain brown. Another very similar species is the dewy ringlet, but that has a more rusty red forewing and the red strip along the underside of the wings is not continuous.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Arctic</b> <b>ringlet</b> has a Holarctic distribution. It {{is found}} in Arctic Europe, Arctic European Russia (Kanin Peninsula), Sajan, Irkutsk, Yakutsk, Yablonoi and Arctic North America. Its typical habitat is bogs and damp forests.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Arctic</b> <b>ringlet</b> or Disa alpine (Erebia disa) is {{a member}} of the Satyrinae {{subfamily}} of Nymphalidae. It is associated with wet muskeg and bogs in subarctic and Arctic climates, and is often found near the tree-line. The larva overwinters twice before undergoing metamorphosis into an adult. It is found in Arctic Europe, Arctic European Russia (Kanin Peninsula), Sajan, Irkutsk, Yakutsk, Yablonoi and Arctic North America.|$|E
50|$|Erebia polaris, the <b>Arctic</b> {{woodland}} <b>ringlet,</b> is {{a butterfly}} of the Nymphalidae family. It {{is found in}} Lapland and boreal Asia. The habitat consists of damp grasslands, but this butterfly also occurs on dry grasslands and in waste places, often where shelter is provided by birches or juniper bushes.|$|R
50|$|The <b>Arctic</b> {{woodland}} <b>ringlet</b> is {{native to}} northern Europe, occurring in northern Norway, Finland and Lapland, up to a height of 400 m above sea level. It is typically found on sandy river banks, on damp grassland, {{at the edges of}} meadows that are prone to flooding and in drier places with shelter provided by trees and bushes.|$|R
50|$|The Arctic {{woodland}} ringlet is a medium-sized butterfly with a wingspan of between 33 and 42 mm. Females {{tend to be}} a little larger than males. The upperside of both the forewings and hindwings are dark brown with black eyespots with red margins in a row near the edge. In the male the eyespots are small and do not usually have a white centre except possibly the front one. In the female they may be no bigger but many of them have white centres and they may be more numerous forming a continuous line. The underside of the wings is similar to the upperside. This butterfly can be distinguished from the rather similar Lapland ringlet (Erebia embla) and the Arran brown (Erebia ligea) {{by the fact that it}} has no white blotches on the under surfaces of the wings. It can be distinguished from the <b>Arctic</b> <b>ringlet</b> (Erebia disa) by the fact that it always has eyespots on its hindwings.|$|E
