25|$|During World War I, Fleming {{witnessed}} {{the death of}} many soldiers from sepsis resulting from infected wounds. <b>Antiseptics,</b> which were used {{at the time to}} treat infected wounds, often worsened the injuries. In an article he submitted for the medical journal The Lancet during World War I, Fleming described an ingenious experiment, which he was able to conduct {{as a result of his}} own glass blowing skills, in which he explained why <b>antiseptics</b> were killing more soldiers than infection itself during World War I. <b>Antiseptics</b> worked well on the surface, but deep wounds tended to shelter anaerobic bacteria from the antiseptic agent, and <b>antiseptics</b> seemed to remove beneficial agents produced that protected the patients in these cases at least as well as they removed bacteria, and did nothing to remove the bacteria that were out of reach. Sir Almroth Wright strongly supported Fleming's findings, but despite this, most army physicians over the course of the war continued to use <b>antiseptics</b> even in cases where this worsened the condition of the patients.|$|E

40|$|This study {{aimed to}} {{evaluate}} the survival rate of microorganisms within different <b>antiseptic</b> formulations - povidone-iodine (PVP-I) and chlorhexidine (CHX) - after intentional contamination, and to establish the minimum care necessary to ensure sterilization of non-disposable <b>antiseptic</b> solution containers.

25|$|Antibacterial soaps {{have been}} heavily {{promoted}} to a health-conscious public. To date, {{there is no}} evidence that using recommended <b>antiseptics</b> or disinfectants selects for antibiotic-resistant organisms in nature. However, antibacterial soaps contain common antibacterial agents such as triclosan, which has an extensive list of resistant strains of organisms. So, even if antibiotic resistant strains aren't selected for by antibacterial soaps, they might not be as effective as they are marketed to be.|$|E
25|$|Historically {{hydrogen}} peroxide {{was used for}} disinfecting wounds, partly because of its low cost and prompt availability compared to other <b>antiseptics.</b> It is now thought to slow healing and lead to scarring because it destroys newly formed skin cells. Only a very low concentration of H2O2 can induce healing, and only if not repeatedly applied. Surgical use can lead to gas embolism formation. Despite this it is still used for wound treatment in many developing countries.|$|E
25|$|Other pioneers include Danish {{physician}} Peter Anton Schleisner, who in 1849 related {{his work}} on the prevention of the epidemic of neonatal tetanus on the Vestmanna Islands in Iceland. Another important pioneer was Hungarian physician Ignaz Semmelweis, who in 1847 brought down infant mortality at a Vienna hospital by instituting a disinfection procedure. His findings were published in 1850, but his work was ill-received by his colleagues, who discontinued the procedure. Disinfection did not become widely practiced until British surgeon Joseph Lister 'discovered' <b>antiseptics</b> in 1865 in light of the work of Louis Pasteur.|$|E

Aphthous stomatitis has no clinically detectable signs or symptoms outside the mouth, but the recurrent ulceration can cause much discomfort to sufferers. Treatment is aimed at reducing the pain and swelling and speeding healing, and may involve systemic or topical steroids, analgesics (pain killers), <b>antiseptics,</b> anti-inflammatories or barrier pastes to protect the raw area(s).|$|E
25|$|FVR is {{transmitted}} through direct contact only. It replicates in the nasal and nasopharyngeal tissues and the tonsils. Viremia (the {{presence of the}} virus in the blood) is rare. The virus is shed in saliva and eye and nasal secretions, and can also be spread by fomites. FVR has a two- to five-day incubation period. The virus is shed for one to three weeks postinfection. Latently infected cats (carriers) will shed FHV-1 intermittently for life, with the virus persisting within the trigeminal ganglion. Stress and use of corticosteroids precipitate shedding. Most disinfectants, <b>antiseptics</b> and detergents are effective against the virus.|$|E
25|$|The use of topical {{antibiotics}} on surgical {{wounds to}} reduce infection rates has been questioned.

A systematic review published by Cochrane (organisation) in 2016, though, concluded that topical antibiotics applied over certain types of surgical wounds reduce the risk of surgical site infections, when compared to no treatment or use of <b>Antiseptics.</b> The review also did not find conclusive evidence to suggest that topical antibiotics increased the risk of local skin reactions or antibiotic resistance.|$|E

40|$|SummaryA novel alcohol-based <b>antiseptic</b> and a novel {{water-based}} <b>antiseptic</b> lotion, {{both with}} a synergistic combination of antimicrobial ingredients containing 0. 2 % benzethonium chloride, were evaluated using the standard time-kill method against 25 FDA-specified challenge microorganisms. The {{purpose of the}} testing {{was to determine whether}} a non-alcohol product could have equivalent rapid and broad-spectrum kill to a traditional alcohol sanitizer. Both the alcohol- and water-based products showed rapid and broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity. The average 15 -s kill was 99. 999 % of the challenge organism for the alcohol-based <b>antiseptic</b> and 99. 971 % for the water-based <b>antiseptic.</b> The alcohol-based product demonstrated 100 % of peak efficacy (60 s) within the first 15 s, whereas the water-based product showed 99. 97 %. The novel alcohol-based <b>antiseptic</b> reduced concentrations of 100 % of organisms by 99. 999 %, whereas the water-based <b>antiseptic</b> lotion showed the same reduction for 96 % of organisms. A novel water-based <b>antiseptic</b> product demonstrated equivalent rapid, broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity to an alcohol-based sanitizer and provided additional benefits of reduced irritation, persistent effect, and greater efficacy against common viruses. The combination of rapid, broad-spectrum immediate kill and persistent efficacy against pathogens may have significant clinical benefit in limiting the spread of disease...|$|R
