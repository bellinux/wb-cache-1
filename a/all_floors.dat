50|$|An in-floor safe {{installed}} in a concrete floor is very resistant to fire. However, not <b>all</b> <b>floor</b> safes are watertight and will often fill with water from fire hoses, therefore everything stored inside should be placed in either double zip lock bags, dry bags, or sealed plastic containers.|$|R
25|$|When {{originally}} constructed, {{the address}} of the building was 2 East 86th Street. During its renovation, the building owners applied to the Manhattan Borough President's office for an address change, citing the fact that <b>all</b> <b>floors</b> above the seventh provide an unobstructed view of Central Park. This was for marketing purposes, due to the additional value that accrues to real estate with a Fifth Avenue address. Such changes are unusual but not unheard of, and are granted if deemed justified.|$|E
25|$|With the {{exception}} of the bathroom, the walls in the house featured diverse surface treatment. Almost every wall is decorated with hand painted and stenciled art recreating geometric patterns and classic motifs: garlands, pilasters, columns and linear designs to accentuate the corners. <b>All</b> <b>floors</b> are of wooden planks made out of tabloncillo (sideroxylon portoricense), with {{the exception}} of the gallery's floor, which consist of hydraulic cement tiles, result of an early twentieth century intervention. The ceiling also consists of wooden planks, mostly decorated with hand painted geometric motifs and stenciled designs.|$|E

The central part, corresponds to the nave, and there are three sections per floor (with the doorways on the ground floor decorated in archways) and surmounted by a cut frontispiece with decorated tympanum. There is an inscription on the archway entrance to the left part of the church, that reads 1838.|$|E
25|$|The Army ordered sutler stores at prison camps {{shut down}} on December 1, 1863 in {{retaliation}} for reported Confederate mistreatment of Union prisoners. The store at Camp Douglas was closed on December 12. After a successful tunneling escape on December 3, Colonel DeLand ordered <b>all</b> <b>floors</b> torn out of barracks, {{to be replaced by}} dirt even with the floor joist. This resulted in conditions that increased sickness and mortality. The garrison also tore out partitions in the barracks. DeLand confiscated warm coats, possibly to prevent escapes but as likely {{in retaliation for}} past escapes and attempts. On December 17, 1863, the prison camp officials closed the barber shop and newsstand, and stopped sales of stamps, envelopes and writing paper, likely also in retaliation for the major escape attempt. When Sergeant–Major Oscar Cliett of the 55th Georgia Infantry Regiment reported to DeLand that his men rejected an offer of amnesty if they joined the Union Navy because they could not swim, DeLand had him placed in the dungeon for twenty-one days. Despite these harsh actions, DeLand also worked to free fifty underage prisoners who he discovered were between the ages of 14 and 17 The Army did not free them.|$|E

25|$|Taking {{into account}} the new role of the castle, the emperor Ferdinand I. of Habsburg had it rebuilt into a Renaissance castle by Italian {{builders}} and artists, such as Giulio Licino da Pordanone and Maciotanus Ulisses from Rome, between 1552 and 1562 (but some work continued even afterwards). The main designer and supervisor of the construction was the Italian architect Pietro Ferrabosco, who had been serving the emperor in Vienna and knew Count Eck Salm, the captain of Pressburg from 1552– 1571. The building’s form did not change (except that the entrance was shifted), but it was completely changed inside and outside. Above <b>all,</b> <b>floors</b> and rooms were rearranged, and most rooms received precious (golden etc.) equipment. In the late 16th century, a ball house (for various ball games) at the eastern wall and a second, better water well were added. Unfortunately, basically {{only one part of}} the castle chapel has been completely preserved from this time, paradoxically because it was walled up as “unnecessary” in the 17th century. As {{for the rest of the}} site, there were wooden dwellings for the guards (up to the 18th century) in the north-west, a (today unknown) “old tower” somewhere to the left of the castle building was improved, and the western entrance gate of the site was replaced by a big armoury.|$|E
500|$|Clark Construction was {{the general}} contractor. [...] Smislova, Kehnemui & Associates was the {{structural}} engineer, and Girard Engineering handled the mechanical engineering. [...] Clark Interiors, a subsidiary of Clark Construction, and Davis Carter Scott designed the Finnegan offices (which are contained on floors five through 11). [...] A grand staircase surrounded by a curved glass wall extends to <b>all</b> <b>floors.</b> Among the other building features constructed were a cafeteria, computer repair facility, data center, kitchen, mailroom, meeting rooms, offices, reception area, and videotaping facility.|$|E

Of its 18 floors, 15 are used as corporate space, two constitute the Premier's suite, and on top is a mechanical floor. This leads to conflicting numbers quoted for its floors (16, 17 and 18 have been variously reported), compounded by the fact the retrofitted extra floors are not visible from outside the building. Two elevators, one of which is used as a freight elevator, provide access to <b>all</b> <b>floors.</b>|$|E

In May 2011, the British fashion retailer Superdry announced it would move into the building, paying £12m for the lease. In return, Austin Reed moved to a former Aquascutum shop {{on the other side}} of the road. In 2016, Austin Reed filed for administration, ending over 100 years' presence on Regent Street.|$|E
500|$|The {{southern}} façade {{was described}} by Nikolaus Pevsner as [...] "among the most fanciful pieces of Jacobean design in [...] ". It is three storeys high and features three sets of three bays in either wing, with five inner sections. The outer two of the inner sections feature eight angular windows, aligned in rows of four {{on the first two}} floors and then a row of four windows on the top floor. The inner two sections feature the same layout on the first and top floors with eight windows aligned in rows of four on the first floor and four windows on the top floor, but the ground floor features two arches, which form part of the central loggia. The stone central bay, [...] wide, is emphasised by superimposed double decorated pilasters on <b>all</b> <b>floors</b> and the central archway of the loggia in the Doric, Ionic, and Corinthian orders, surmounted by a florid perforated pediment. In addition there is an oriel window on the first floor above the main entrance.|$|E
500|$|According to {{military}} historian Allen Brown Rochester's keep is [...] "among the finest and oldest in all England". Since its construction it underwent limited alteration, {{aside from the}} rebuilding of one corner, and although now {{in a state of}} ruin it remains significantly intact and {{is considered one of the}} most important surviving 12th-century keeps in England and France. The keep was richly decorated with hangings and furnishings. Dating from the second quarter of the 12th century, it is Rochester Castle's dominant feature. It had a square plan, and measures [...] externally with pilaster buttresses at each corner. The keep was built in the castle's southern corner, close to the curtain wall. The primary building material was local Kentish Ragstone, although Caen stone used to face the keep was imported from Normandy. The same material was imported for the Tower of London's White Tower in the 11th century. The tops of the turrets rise [...] above the ground, 12ft above the battlements. Below the latter are rectangular holes, marking where wooden hoarding would have been attached. Though 12ft thick at the base, the walls of the keep taper to 10ft at the top. It is the tallest keep in England, and only those at Dover, the Tower of London, Colchester, and Norwich are larger. During John's siege of Rochester in 1215, the south-east corner collapsed; during HenryIII's reign it was rebuilt as a cylinder. The windows increase in size higher up the walls, although only the uppermost were decorated. A spiral staircase in the north-east corner provided access to <b>all</b> <b>floors,</b> and another in the south-west corner went from the first floor to the top floor. The north-west corner tower contains small chambers, and the south-east probably had a similar layout before it was rebuilt.|$|E
