25|$|<b>Animal</b> <b>housing</b> {{practical}} when collecting germplasms {{because they}} keep donor animals in an easily accessible area, making {{the process of}} collecting germplasms easier and more efficient. The species and breeds of animals housed should be considered while planning the facility; facilities should be big enough to meet animal welfare standards, yet small enough to reduce human contact and increase ease of handling while reducing stress of the animal. As the process of collecting germplasm may take several days, the animal may become stressed causing a lower quality of genetic material to be obtained. Thus, training the animal {{to become familiar with}} the process is key. Holding facilities for animals may also serve as a quarantine. Quarantine facilities are necessary in order to prevent the transmission of disease from animal to animal, animal to germplasm, germplasm to germplasm, and germplasm to animal. Introducing quarantine to separate the diseased animal(s) from the healthy should be done immediately. However, a quarantine does not always prevent the spread of disease.|$|E

40|$|Ammonia {{emissions}} from <b>animal</b> <b>houses</b> {{are an important}} environmental issue in the Netherlands. The current technique in the Netherlands to measure ammonia emissions in mechanically ventilated <b>animal</b> <b>houses</b> is the chemiluminescence method (using a NOx monitor after conversion of NH 3 to NO). During campaigns to measure {{emissions from}} <b>animal</b> <b>houses,</b> {{it became clear that}} management {{is an important factor in}} determining the emission level. Differences between <b>animal</b> <b>houses</b> of the same type and kind of animal may differ more than the variation in time and season within one <b>animal</b> <b>house.</b> These management related differences in emission factors point at the need to measure more <b>animal</b> <b>houses</b> during a shorter period. This stresses the need for development of flexible methods to be used in short term measurements, which allows monitoring the ammonia emission from a larger number of animal buildings per year. In this paper, a practical farm with different housing systems and two types of ventilation shafts (with and without a lid in the ventilation shaft to regulate the temperature inside the <b>animal</b> <b>house)</b> was selected to test theperformance of passive flux samplers to measure the ammonia emission from mechanically ventilated <b>animal</b> <b>houses.</b> A statistical t-test shows that the differences between passive flux samplers and the reference method are not significant at the 95 % significance level when combining all measurements. The use of a lid in the ventilation shaft improves the correlation between passive flux samplers and the reference method. As a result of these measurements, passive flux samplers are presented as an alternative to measure the ammonia emission from mechanically ventilated <b>animal</b> <b>houses...</b>|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} comply with the ammonia (NH 3) {{emission}} reduction assigned to the Netherlands development of new measures are needed, which should be supported by fast and accurate measurements to arrive at new estimates of the NH 3 emission from each agricultural source. This paper gives an overview of the current methods used in the Netherlands to measure NH 3 emissions from <b>animal</b> <b>houses,</b> and provides alternative methods for some particular situations. For mechanically ventilated <b>animal</b> <b>houses,</b> passive flux samplers placed in the ventilation shafts of the <b>animal</b> <b>house</b> are presented as alternative to measure a larger number of <b>animal</b> <b>houses</b> (replicates) with the same housing system at a low price. For naturally ventilated <b>animal</b> <b>houses,</b> when mixing in the <b>animal</b> <b>house</b> is not good enough to allow measurements within the <b>animal</b> <b>house</b> (internal tracer gas ratio method), two measurement methods are discussed: the Gaussian plume dispersion model, which is usually not suitable for agricultural situations, and the flux frame method, which is not always applicable because of distortion of the flow around the building. Finally, for <b>animal</b> <b>houses</b> with outside yards for the animals, there are at this moment no methods available to measure the NH 3 emissions from these complex situations, although quick box methods (for the outside yards) and a combination of a backward Lagrangian stochastic model with open-path concentration measurements with a tunable diode laser (TDL), look promising.

50|$|Due to {{its large}} size, the Flemish Giant needs {{substantial}} living quarters that provide ample opportunity for physical movement. The House Rabbit Society recommends keeping rabbits {{inside the home}} in a very large pen or room(s) in the home.

In the United States Department of Agriculture's standards for <b>animal</b> <b>housing,</b> rabbits over 12 pounds must have at least five square feet of floor space.
