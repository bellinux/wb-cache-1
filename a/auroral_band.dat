30|$|A moving auroral {{structure}} that is observed {{well away from}} the main red line <b>auroral</b> <b>band</b> in the daytime sector is recognized as being the ionospheric signature of open magnetic flux motion driven by patchy or intermittent reconnection, known as a flux transfer event (FTE) (Haerendel et al. 1978; Russell and Elphic 1978). For a moving auroral {{structure that}} appears to be embedded in the red line <b>auroral</b> <b>band,</b> however, {{it is difficult to determine}} whether such a structure is the signature of an FTE. However, this auroral structure should also be located in the open magnetic field line region because the open/closed field line boundary generally coincides with the equatorward edge of the red line <b>auroral</b> <b>band</b> (Milan et al. 1999).|$|E
30|$|Note that in {{this event}} we again see the poleward-progressing trace, which stems from the {{latitude}} of the preexisting arc after T 1, and gradually intensifies while propagating poleward. Such a poleward-propagating trace appears to be disjointed from the main proton <b>auroral</b> <b>band,</b> and there is actually a minimum of emission intensity between such a poleward trace and the main proton <b>auroral</b> <b>band.</b> Strong intensification of the main proton <b>auroral</b> <b>band</b> occurs {{near the end of}} the poleward-progressing trace. We have also seen such a feature in a number of other events. Since this paper is focused on the late growth phase and the TSSO, proton aurora features after T 1 are not our research object here, but we plan on a dedicated investigation on such poleward-progressing traces in a separate publication in the near feature.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. We present two {{case studies}} {{in the night and}} evening sides of the auroral oval, based on plasma and field {{measurements}} made at low altitudes by the AUREOL- 3 satellite, during a long period of stationary magnetospheric convection (SMC) on November 24, 1981. The basic feature of both oval crossings was an evident double oval pattern, including (1) a weak arc-type structure at the equatorial edge of the oval/polar edge of the diuse <b>auroral</b> <b>band,</b> collocated with an upward field-aligned current (FAC) sheet of 1. 0 lA m) 2, (2) an intermediate region of weaker precipitation within the oval, (3) a more intense <b>auroral</b> <b>band</b> at the polar oval boundary, and (4) polar diuse auroral zone near the polar cap boundary.

40|$|Auroral {{optical imagery}} shows marked {{differences}} between auroral {{features of the}} evening and morning sectors: the separation between diffuse and discrete auroras in the evening sector is not distinct in the morning sector, which is dominated by auroral patches and multiple banded structures aligned along some direction. Plasma distribution function signatures also show marked differences: downward electron beams and inverted-V signatures prefer the evening sector, while the electron spectra on the morning sector {{are similar to the}} diffuse aurora. A theory of morningside auroras consistent with these features was constructed. The theory is based on modulation of the growth rates of electron cyclotron waves by the mirror instability, which is in turn driven by inward-convected ions that have become anisotropic. This modulation produces alternating bands of enhanced and reduced electron precipitation which approximate the observed multiple <b>auroral</b> <b>bands</b> and patches of the morning sector...|$|R
30|$|We have {{investigated}} the variations of electron auroral arc and proton auroras during the late growth phase and TSSO. Besides corroborating the previous notion that the preexisting and onset arc is usually situated at the poleward “shoulder” of the main proton <b>auroral</b> <b>band</b> (e.g., Lui and Burrows 1978; Samson et al. 1992; Donovan et al. 2012), the core new result {{in this study is}} that, during the TSSO when the electron auroral arc gradually enhances with intensity increasing by several times or even an order of magnitude, the proton auroral variations are much smaller or none during the TSSO. In passing, we also notice a poleward-propagating trace of emissions detached from the main proton <b>auroral</b> <b>band</b> after the expansion phase onset. In the following, we shall discuss a few possible explanations to the observations, and the implication of our results to the understanding of substorm onset mechanisms.|$|E
30|$|Figure  2 b {{shows the}} MSP observations. The upper panel {{presents}} the 557.7  nm green-line emission. These data have been preliminarily calibrated into optical Rayleigh values, though still subject to an undetermined factor presumably {{no more than}} 2. The relative change of the intensity is fully trustworthy. The lower panel of Fig.  2 b shows the 486.1  nm Hβ proton emission, with the electron aurora arc band marked. The arc is located on a poleward decreasing slope of the proton auroral intensity, between the main proton <b>auroral</b> <b>band</b> and the dark region poleward of it. In a more depictive word, the arc {{is located at the}} poleward “shoulder” of the main proton <b>auroral</b> <b>band</b> (Samson et al. 1992; Donovan et al. 2012). This has been well established as a robust feature of the preexisting arc during the late growth phase of substorms (see “Introduction” section).|$|E
30|$|Though not of {{the core}} {{interest}} of this paper, we note an interesting feature of proton auroras during the early expansion phase of the substorm: {{there appears to be}} a poleward-propagating trace after T 1, which stems from the latitudes of the preexisting arc band. Such a trace appears to be somehow disjointed from the main proton <b>auroral</b> <b>band</b> (see more clearly in the next event example).|$|E
40|$|Latitudinal {{shifts of}} the {{discrete}} dayside aurora are examined {{with respect to}} variations in the interplanetary magnetic field (IMF) and to magnetospheric substorms. Within 10 - 15 min after steplike southward (northward) transitions in the IMF the dayside auroral oval moves equatorward (poleward). In at least some cases the auroral shift is similar to an exponential relaxation in latitude from an initial to a final steady state value; for these cases the average exponential time constant {{is estimated to be}} 17 min. Substorm features in the dayside aurora include (1) an equatorward shift by 1 - 3 deg of the equatorward discrete auroral boundary, (2) a brightening of the discrete aurora near substorm onset, (3) the formation of multiple <b>auroral</b> <b>bands,</b> and (4) poleward motion of short-lived individual auroral arcs occurring nearly coincident in time with the equatorward boundary shifts, the average poleward velocity of these arcs being approximately 800 m/s...|$|R
40|$|Photographs {{of global}} scale auroral forms taken by {{scanning}} radiometers onboard weather satellites in 1972 show that <b>auroral</b> <b>bands</b> exhibit well organized wave motion with typical zonal wave number of 5 or so. The scale size of these waves is {{in agreement with}} that of well organized neutral wind fields in the 150 - to 200 -km region during the geomagnetic storm of May 27, 1967. Further, the horizontal scale size revealed by these observations are in agreement with that of high altitude traveling ionospheric disturbances. It is conjectured that the geomagnetic storm {{is a source of}} planetary and synoptic scale neutral atmospheric waves in the middle atmosphere. Although there is, at present, no observation of substorm related waves of this scale size at mesospheric and stratospheric altitudes, the possible existence of a new source of waves of the proper scale size to trigger instabilities in middle atmospheric circulation systems may be significant in the study of lower atmospheric response to geomagnetic activity...|$|R
40|$|We {{investigate}} the electrodynamic coupling between <b>auroral</b> omega <b>bands</b> {{and the inner}} magnetosphere. The goal {{of this study is}} to determine the features to which omega bands map in the magnetosphere. To establish the auroral-magnetosphere connection, we appeal to the case study analysis of the data rich event of September 26, 1989. At 6 magnetic local time (MLT), two trains of Ps 6 pulsations (ground magnetic signatures of omega bands) were observed to drift over the Canadian Auroral Network For the OPEN Program Unified Study (CANOPUS) chain. At the same time periodic ionospheric flow patterns moved through the collocated Bistatic Auroral Radar System (BARS) field of view. Similar coincident magnetic variations were observed by GOES 6, GOES 7 and SCATHA, all of which had magnetic foot points near the CANOPUS/BARS stations. SCATHA, which was located at 6 MLT, 0. 5 RE earthward of GOES 7 observed the 10 min period pulsations, whereas GOES 7 did not. In addition, DMSP F 6 and F 8 were over-flying the region and observed characteristic precipitation and flow signatures. From this fortunate constellation of ground and space observations, we conclude that <b>auroral</b> omega <b>bands</b> are the electrodynamic signature of a corrugated current sheet (or some similar spatially localized magnetic structure) in the near-Earth geostationary magnetosphere...|$|R

40|$|We present {{observations}} of <b>auroral</b> omega <b>bands</b> on 28 September 2009. Although generally {{associated with the}} substorm recovery phase and typically observed in the morning sector, the features presented here occurred just after expansion phase onset and were observed in the midnight sector, dawnward of the onset region. An all‐sky imager located in northeastern Iceland revealed that the omega bands were ∼ 150 × 200 km in size and propagated eastward at ∼ 0. 4 km s− 1 while a colocated ground magnetometer recorded the simultaneous occurrence of Ps 6 pulsations. Although somewhat smaller and slower moving than the majority of previously reported omega bands, the observed structures are clear examples of this phenomenon, albeit in an atypical location and unusually early in the substorm cycle. The THEMIS C probe provided detailed measurements of the upstream interplanetary environment, while the Cluster satellites were located in the tail plasma sheet conjugate to the ground‐based all‐sky imager. The Cluster satellites observed bursts of 0. 1 – 3 keV electrons moving parallel to the magnetic field toward the Northern Hemisphere auroral ionosphere; these bursts were associated with increased levels of field‐aligned Poynting flux. The in situ measurements are consistent with electron acceleration via shear Alfvén waves in the plasma sheet ∼ 8 RE tailward of the Earth. Although a one‐to‐one association between auroral and magnetospheric features was not found, our observations suggest that Alfvén waves in the plasma sheet are responsible for field‐aligned currents that cause Ps 6 pulsations and auroral brightening in the ionosphere. Our findings agree with the conclusions of earlier studies that <b>auroral</b> omega <b>bands</b> have a source mechanism in the midtail plasma sheet...|$|R

30|$|Such height-latitude alias imposes {{difficulties}} on {{our efforts}} to compare electron and proton auroras in the same arc region.

Particular attention was given to a sudden increase in the field-aligned current associated with a prior sudden increase in the electric field and a sudden change in the magnetic field, all occurring {{near the edge of}} a visual auroral arc.

40|$|It {{is noted}} that, {{in the distant}} plasma sheet, {{it is likely that}} {{curvature}} drift is the most important source of drift parallel to the electric field, leading to what is commonly called Fermi acceleration of the particles.

It is a form of field-aligned acceleration, with rapid lowering of mirror points, caused by the transverse electric field in the plasma sheet. It is noted that the process will work for both negative and positive particles. A filamentation of the neutral current sheet is postulated.

At these energies the correlation with VLF auroral hiss is best at 0. 7 keV and worst at 7. 3 keV.

Auroral hiss tends to occur simultaneously over a broad range of frequencies. A study based on OGO 6 data has revealed a lack of correlation between keV electrons and LF auroral hiss. These observations suggest that hiss of all frequencies is generated by electrons with energies below about 1 keV. The excellent correlation between auroral hiss and 0. 7 keV electrons in the day time cleft is apparently maintained when the region of very soft electron precipitation is in motion...|$|R

Such a radial B Z profile appears to be very similar to that assumed in the "minimum- B /cross-tail line current" model by Galperin et al.

This model considers a FAC generator mechanism by Grad-Vasyliunas-Boström-Tverskoy operating in the region of a narrow magnetic field minimum in the near-Earth neutral sheet, together with the concept of ion non-adiabatic scattering in the "wall region". The generated upward FAC branch of the double sheet current structure feeds the steady auroral arc/inverted-V at the equatorial border of the oval. When the semi-empirical B Z profile is introduced in the GVZ 92 model, a good agreement is found between the modelled current and the measured characteristics of the FACs associated with the equatorial arc.

40|$|The {{presence}} of very few statistical studies on <b>auroral</b> omega <b>bands</b> motivated us to test-use a semi-automatic method for identifying large-scale undulations of the diffuse aurora boundary and to investigate their occurrence. Five identical all-sky cameras with overlapping fields of view provided data for 438 auroral omega-like structures over Fennoscandian Lapland from 1996 to 2007. The {{results from this}} set of omega band events agree remarkably well with previous observations of omega band occurrence in magnetic local time (MLT), lifetime, location between the region 1 and 2 field-aligned currents, as well as current density estimates. The average peak emission height of omega forms corresponds to the estimated precipitation energies of a few keV, which experienced no significant change during the events. Analysis of both local and global magnetic indices demonstrates that omega bands are observed during substorm expansion and recovery phases that are more intense than average substorm expansion and recovery phases in the same region. The omega occurrence {{with respect to the}} substorm expansion and recovery phases is in a very good agreement with an earlier observed distribution of fast earthward flows in the plasma sheet during expansion and recovery phases.

40|$|Observational and {{experimental}} results concerning auroral structure, auroral zone magnetic bays, and auroral electrons are briefly reviewed {{and a brief}} outline {{of some of the}} results of the theory of adiabatia charged particle motion are given. These are used to show that the auroral zones are apparently connected by closed magnetic field lines, and that there exist in the auroral zone ionosphere electric fields which are essentially transverse to the magnetic field and which typically have magnitudes on the order of 50 millivolts/meter. These electric fields provide the driving force for localized ionospheric currents, the auroral electrojets, which flow within the regions of enhanced ionization provided by the visible auroral forms. It is shown that <b>auroral</b> arcs and <b>bands</b> are apparently ordinarily so oriented as to have their horizontal axes perpendicular to these electric fields. It is further shown that if the auroral zone magnetic field lines are equipotentials, adiabatic acceleration and precipitation of electrons will occur. In the event that the motion of the electrons is not entirely adiabatic, but involves slow diffusion in pitch angle, precipitation will still occur. Either of these processes will lead to the precipitation of electrons in extended regions of glow, and to the development of a pitch angle distribution which is highly peaked outside of the loss cone. With such a pitch angle distribution, the distortion of ionospheric electric and magnetic fields associated with localized auroral electrojets leads to a modulation of auroral precipitation, giving parallel bright and dark <b>bands</b> of <b>auroral</b> emission, which are aligned nearly perpendicular to the ionospheric electric field...|$|R

The bottom panel of Fig.  7 shows the total proton auroral intensity integrated over all FESO latitudes.

30|$|Secondly, the ion {{precipitation}} flux is also {{contingent upon}} the pitch-angle scattering rate, {{which is usually}} dominated by stochastic scattering due to curved field lines in the CPS (e.g., Sergeev et al. 1983; Donovan et al. 2003). In a more-dipolarized wave segment, the trapped ions might be energized so that the omnidirectional flux would increase. However, the field line-curvature decreases in this region, elevating the critical energy threshold so that fewer ions are scattered into the loss cone. Vice versa, in a more-stretched segment, the omnidirectional flux decreases, yet the scattering rate enhances. Such a competing effect between the omnidirectional flux and the scattering efficiency related to the change of magnetic field topology, was discussed and quantitatively investigated in Gilson et al. (2012). However, {{in the context of}} our research interest, since the arc is always located around the poleward edge of the main proton <b>auroral</b> <b>band</b> where the strong scattering condition is supposed to be met for most of the CPS thermal and energetic ions (e.g., Jiang et al. 2012), the change of the critical energy of pitch-angle scattering, due to a moderate change of the magnetic field topology, would at most play a minor role in the proton auroral variation.|$|E
40|$|A {{meridian}} scanning photometer {{was designed}} for investigating the time and space variations of auroral luminosity. With {{the aid of the}} quick-scan auroral photometer data of more than 300 clear night hours recorded at Syowa Station, Antarctica (geomagnetic lat. 69. 6 °S, long. 77. 1 °E), the following problems are studied: (1) space and time variation of auroral displays, (2) magnetic field variations associated with the space-time auroral displays, (3) relationships among auroras, magnetic field disturbance, magnetic pulsations, VLF hiss, VLF chorus and GNA during the course of substorms. Various kinds of morphological evidence obtained through the above investigations show that a polar substorm consists of the breakup phase and the post-breakup phase. The breakup phase is characterized by a sudden intensification of <b>auroral</b> arc(s) or <b>band(s)</b> and a rapid poleward movement of the intensified aurora(s) with speed of about 1 km/s (Breakup type aurora). The post-breakup phase is defined as diffused auroras or rays which still remain after the intense breakup type aurora(s) have passed away polewards (Post-breakup type aurora). Generally, the post-breakup aurora(s) move towards the equator side. A breakup type aurora is accompanied by a sharp pulsative geomagnetic disturbance (Breakup magnetic disturbance), while a post-breakup type aurora by a gradual negative bay-shape disturbance (Post-breakup magnetic disturbance). It seems that the sharp pulsative disturbance moves polewards together with the moving breakup aurora, while the gradual negative bay stays with the associated post-breakup aurora(s). Thus, the auroral electrojet can also be classified into AEJ- 1, which is an intense and narrow electrojet moving together with the breakup aurora, and AEJ- 2, which is a comparatively broad and weak electrojet associated with the post-breakup aurora(s). The auroral breakup phase is accompanied not only by a sharp pulsative geomagnetic disturbance but also by VLF hiss emissions, ULF emissions of PiB type and a sharp CNA phenomenon, while the post-breakup aurora is accompanied by a gradual geo-magnetic bay, a gradual, weak CNA, VLF chorus emissions and ULF emissions of PiC type. With reference to 2 ̆ 7 the space-time variations in auroras associated with geomagnetic perturbations at Syowa Station, an overall physical picture of dynamic auroral behaviors over the entire polar region is given, as a conclusion...|$|R
40|$|This {{final report}} {{describes}} the efforts accomplished during the grant's period of performance, covering {{the period of}} 1 May 1997 to 30 April 2001, of a NASA Supporting Research and Technology Program grant under the Ionospheric, Thermospheric, and Mesospheric Physics component of the Sun-Earth Connections program. We have met and exceeded the goals {{set forth in the}} proposed research objectives. Referred publications have appeared in the scientific literature and several others are in the review process. In addition, numerous invited and contributed presentations of these studies were presented at national and international meetings during the performance period. One graduate student completed his PhD and won two AGU Best Student Paper awards based on research funded by this grant. These studies are summarized below. The science goal delineated in the initial proposal was "to systematically explore the temporal and spatial characteristics of the aurora in a way heretofore impossible, using data from two coplanar DMSP spacecraft. " We accomplished this goal through a series of related studies. One study used these unique data to establish the role of Ps 6 waves in coupling between the magnetosphere and the <b>auroral</b> ionosphere (omega <b>bands)</b> during the recovery phase of a magnetic storm; the published paper demonstrated the causal relationships between geospace processes occurring in different regions and established a simple conceptual model based on the fortuitous constellation of observations. In the second string of papers, we used these data to explore velocity-dispersed ions (VDIS) in and near the cusp, to test region identification models, and to look at space/time structure of auroral precipitation. On the first topic, the unique DMSP data revealed a remarkable double VDIS with a latitudinal overlap. This could only be explained in terms of a unified reconnection geometry that builds on several earlier unrelated models. The paper outlining this discovery has drawn considerable attention from the community and is currently in press - it adds significantly to the debate over whether reconnection is study state versus bursty and patchy versus global. The second paper develops the model further by incorporating the electron signature - these ionospheric particle precipitation signatures reveal the presence of magnetospheric "fossilized" FTEs, demonstrating the power of ionospheric measurements as a remote diagnostic of magnetospheric processes. Finally, the general nature of aurora] stability and coherence and region identification by particle characteristics were fully explored in a final paper. We identify candidate mechanisms controlling coherence time scales and length scales and refine boundary region identification criteria. We also use the dual-DMSP observations to identify the open and closed LLBL region and related its significance to the generalized bursty, multiple x-line model developed in the first paper. All of these topics are chapters of Dr. Boudouridis' recently completed PhD thesis...|$|R
30|$|The {{electrojet}} borders {{shown in}} the middle panel of Fig. 6 exhibit extremely similar behavior to that of auroral luminosity in the keograms of Fig. 4. After pseudobreakup (red line in both figures), there was a rapid rise of the poleward border, which then stalled until expansive phase onset (orange line in both figures). Within {{a few minutes of}} this, the current had dramatically strengthened and the electrojet borders widened, much as in the keogram the aurora brightened and expanded to fill the nearly the entire meridian at RANK. Auroras and electrojet diminished in intensity and returned to lower latitudes by 5 : 10 UT, a timescale of about one half hour. The equatorward border is somewhat ill-defined in the keogram (due to being near the horizon for both stations) but does not show extreme motion for an hour after nominal onset and neither does that from the inversion. They both move northward about 5 : 30 UT but not in good synchrony. In the period before 4 : 30 UT, the small (less than 0.1 MA magnitude) current was confined to a narrow latitudinal width and moved northward, much as a distinct <b>auroral</b> <b>band</b> also was seen to do in the keogram. Some of this period was not well-defined in AMPERE integration (Connors et al. 2014), due to overly small (i.e., below noise threshold) current densities.|$|E
