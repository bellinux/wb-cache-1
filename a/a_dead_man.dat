The film then continues, alternating {{between black and white}} and color sequences.|$|E
5|$|Fictional {{portrayals of}} Walsingham tend to follow Catholic interpretations, {{depicting}} him as sinister and Machiavellian. He features in conspiracy theories surrounding {{the death of}} Christopher Marlowe, whom he predeceased. Charles Nicholl examined (and rejected) such theories in The Reckoning: The Murder of Christopher Marlowe (1992), which {{was used as a}} source by Anthony Burgess for his novel <b>A</b> <b>Dead</b> <b>Man</b> in Deptford (1993).|$|E

In this episode, Doggett and Scully encounter <b>a</b> <b>dead</b> <b>man</b> who is still living—only somewhat changed.

50|$|Before Michael, {{finding a}} usable cadaver had been difficult, as indiscreet {{inquiries}} would cause talk, {{and it was}} impossible to tell <b>a</b> <b>dead</b> <b>mans</b> next of kin what the body was wanted for. The <b>dead</b> <b>mans</b> parents had died and no known relatives were found. The body was released on the condition that the mans real identity would never be revealed. Ewen Montagu later claimed the man died from pneumonia, and that the family had been contacted and permission obtained, but none of that was true.|$|R
5|$|Mulder and Scully {{go to the}} Shipley {{house and}} find the {{bathroom}} door barricaded shut, no sign of any people. The two have a brief run-in with Deputy Greer who believes they are burglars until Mulder disarms the man and Scully shows him her FBI ID. They attempt {{to go to the}} airport but are trapped by the hurricane. Elsewhere at the Breakers Condominiums, Deputy Greer encounters the creature after finding <b>a</b> <b>dead</b> <b>man</b> covered in a slimy substance on a toilet. Mulder and Scully later find the deputy's vehicle parked outside the apartments. Searching the building, they discover Greer on the ground, his neck covered with red welts. Mulder goes around the complex to find {{the rest of the people}} and warn them that the thing is in the plumbing. He encounters Dougie, a looter, Walter Suarez whose girlfriend Angela Villareal is nine months pregnant, and George Vincent, an anti-government Second Amendment activist. Mulder attempts to get Vincent to come out and join them for his own protection. Vincent refuses but, after being attacked by the creature in his apartment, relents. Mulder hypothesizes that the entity attacking them was driven from the bottom of the sea by the hurricane into the city's water system.|$|E
5|$|Mulder goes {{to see the}} Shooter, despite Spender's objections. Mulder {{wants to}} give the Shooter {{immunity}} in exchange for testimony, which the Shooter refuses. Gibson proves his abilities {{to a group of}} clinicians while Scully and Fowley watch. The guard at the prison hands the Shooter a flattened Morley cigarette box that says he's <b>a</b> <b>dead</b> <b>man.</b> Scully visits the Lone Gunmen, wanting them to analyze the data from Gibson. She asks them who Diana is, and they tell her she worked closely with Mulder when he discovered the X-Files. The Smoking Man meets with Jeffrey in the FBI parking lot, but disappears when Mulder spots them talking. Scully and Mulder present to Skinner on Gibson, who displays extraordinary brain activities. Mulder believes that Gibson is the key to everything in the X-Files, and wants to make a deal with the Shooter. Diana and Skinner think this may result in adverse attention from the attorney general, and that the X-Files could be closed down if things go wrong, but Mulder dismisses that risk.|$|E

25|$|Disgusting {{and terrifying}} {{parasitic}} alien species are widespread in science fiction, as {{for instance in}} Ridley Scott's 1979 film Alien.

Animal viscera were used to reinforce the shock effect. The scene was filmed in a single take, and the startled reaction of the actors was genuine.|$|E

The popularity of the second film prompted the creation of a regular series on NBC, that premiered in the fall of 1971 as part of The NBC Mystery Movie wheel series rotation: McCloud, McMillan & Wife, and other whodunits.|$|E
