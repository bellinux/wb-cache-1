50|$|Columbia University Astronomy Professor Wallace Eckert was {{examining}} the process {{used by the}} Navy to produce <b>Air</b> <b>Almanacs.</b> Deciding that the manual computation techniques used were too slow and error prone, he recommended automating the process with existing punched card based unit record equipment. One of the hardest problems was getting a high-quality printout of the tables. Initially IBM 405 accounting machines with special modifications were used, but he wanted something better. In 1941 Eckert developed a specification for a card-driven composing typewriter and asked IBM to design and build it.|$|R
5000|$|Celestial navigation, {{also known}} as astronavigation, is the ancient science of {{position}} fixing that enables a navigator to transition through a space without having to rely on estimated calculations, or dead reckoning, to know their position. Celestial navigation uses [...] "sights," [...] or angular measurements taken between a celestial body (the sun, the moon, a planet or a star) and the visible horizon. The sun is most commonly used, but navigators can also use the moon, a planet, Polaris, or one of 57 other navigational stars whose coordinates are tabulated in the nautical <b>almanac</b> and <b>air</b> <b>almanacs.</b>|$|R
50|$|According to the Office of Management and Budget and the <b>Air</b> Force <b>Almanac,</b> when {{measured}} {{in real terms}} (adjusted for inflation), the figure is $790.0 billion this total does not match {{the values of the}} table below, that shows $1034.6 billion adjusted dollars in that period, or an average of $15.818 billion per year over its fifty-year history.|$|R
50|$|Celestial {{navigation}} {{serves as}} a backup to the Global Positioning System. Software is widely available to assist with this form of navigation; some of this software has a self-contained ephemeris. When software is used that does not contain an ephemeris, or if no software is used, position data for celestial objects may {{be obtained from the}} modern Nautical Almanac or <b>Air</b> <b>Almanac.</b>|$|E
50|$|Two second-magnitude stars, Alpha Pavonis and Epsilon Carinae, were {{assigned}} the proper names Peacock and Avior respectively in 1937 by Her Majesty's Nautical Almanac Office during {{the creation of}} The <b>Air</b> <b>Almanac,</b> a navigational almanac for the Royal Air Force. Of the fifty-seven stars included in the new almanac, these two had no classical names. The RAF insisted {{that all of the}} stars must have names, so new names were invented for them. These names have been approved by the IAU WGSN.|$|E
50|$|Celestial {{navigation}} {{is the use}} of angular measurements (sights) between celestial {{bodies and}} the visible horizon to locate one's position on the globe, on land as well as at sea. At a given time, any celestial body is located directly over one point on the Earth's surface. The latitude and longitude of that point is known as the celestial bodyâ€™s geographic position (GP), the location of which can be determined from tables in the Nautical or <b>Air</b> <b>Almanac</b> for that year.|$|E
50|$|Sealand was a {{communications}} support base for RAF operations around the world. It {{functioned as a}} third-line repair station for avionics equipment for all three services. The Royal <b>Air</b> Force <b>Almanac</b> 1995 said that No. 30 Maintenance Unit RAF {{was at the time}} the main unit for airborne electronic and instrument equipment. It serviced more than 100,000 items of airborne radio, radar, electronic, instrument, and missile equipment a year. It also calibrated and manufactured test equipment.|$|R
5000|$|The {{original}} 1987 {{book cover}} is blue, {{with a white}} skull and crossbones. The 1993 reversion edition is red, depicting Bert sitting with the 1987 edition in his hand, and the words [...] "Trebs dagbok", and [...] "Berts" [...] crossed. In the <b>air,</b> <b>almanac</b> dates fall down, and two heart symbols are depicted, with the names [...] "Nadja Nilsson" [...] and [...] "Rebecka", and the text Rebecka crossed. Bert wears a green weater, and in the airs are also the words [...] "Mr Walker" [...] and [...] "Klart slut - varulvstjut".|$|E
5000|$|The {{historical}} name Peacock {{was assigned}} by Her Majesty's Nautical Almanac Office {{in the late}} 1930s during {{the creation of the}} <b>Air</b> <b>Almanac,</b> a navigational almanac for the Royal Air Force. Of the fifty-seven stars included in the new almanac, two had no classical names: Alpha Pavonis and Epsilon Carinae. The RAF insisted that all of the stars must have names, so new names were invented. Alpha Pavonis was named [...] "Peacock" [...] ('pavo' is Latin for 'peacock') whilst Epsilon Carinae was called [...] "Avior". In 2016, the International Astronomical Union organized a Working Group on Star Names (WGSN) to catalog and standardize proper names for stars. The WGSN's first bulletin of July 2016 included a table of the first two batches of names approved by the WGSN; which included Peacock for this star and Avior for Epsilon Carinae.|$|E

40|$|This report {{presents}} a {{detailed discussion of}} the use of the general spherical triangle as a means of eliminating the many special cases of quadrant determination that plague most navigation computations and steal memory from computer programs. Also included are two programs, NAVALGOR and NAVEPHM which are written for the Radio Shack TRS- 80 Model 4 Computer. NAVALGOR implements three sets of computational procedures: direct solution algorithms for speroid and spherical earth models, inverse solution algorithms for spheroid and spherical earth models, and rhumb line approximations to great circle routes. NAVEPHM implements a procedure for the determination of the position of the Sun, Moon and navigational planets that reproduce 'The Nautical Almanac' and 'The Air Almanac' to within 0. 2 '.
