These can be cell contact layers to glass, contact layers to the semiconductor, encapsulant to cell, glass, or backsheet, etc. We use an Instron mechanical testing unit to measure peel strengths at 90 {sup o} or 180 {sup o} and, in some cases, a scratch and tape pull test to evaluate inter-cell layer <b>adhesion</b> <b>strengths.</b> We present peel strength data for test specimens laminated {{from the three}} T-F technologies, before and after damp heat, and in one instance at elevated temperatures.

From X-ray photoelectron spectroscopic analyses, interlayer regions of about 10 nm thick with complicated mixing bonds were found at SiOCH/SiCN interfaces. With plasma treatments, especially H- 2 /NH 3 two-step plasma, a carbon-depletion region of about 30 non thick with more Si-O related bonds of high binding energy formed at the interface. Furthermore, the <b>adhesion</b> <b>strengths</b> of the SiOCH/SiCN interfaces were measured by nanoscratch and microscratch tests. For the untreated interface, the adhesion energy was obtained as about 0. 22 and 0. 44 J/m(2) by nanoscratch and microscratch tests, respectively. After plasma treatments, especially the H- 2 /NH 3 treatment, the interfacial adhesion energy was effectively improved to 0. 41 and 0. 89 J/m(2) because more Si-O bonds of high binding energy formed at the interfaces.

Thus in this study, the mechanical properties and interface <b>adhesion</b> <b>strengths</b> of SiN thin films containing different residual stresses have been investigated by nanoindentation and nanoscratch tests. With varied residual stresses from compressive to tensile, the penetration depth of nanoindentation test shifted to a higher value, and the variations of indentation depth followed different tendencies. The hardness and elastic modulus decreased from 11. 0 and 95 GPa, respectively, for the film containing a compressive stress of 235 MPa to 9. 6 and 84 GPa for the film with a tensile stress of 86 MPa. During nanoscratch tests, interface delamination occurred and the interface <b>adhesion</b> <b>strengths</b> were accordingly measured. With decreasing compressive stress and increasing tensile stress, the interface adhesion energy decreased from 1. 8 to 1. 5 J/m 2.

From the examination of interface microstructures and the analyses of chemical compositions and bonding configurations, an oxide layer was found to exist at the untreated Cu/SiCN interface.

The <b>adhesion</b> <b>strengths</b> of the Cu/SiCN interfaces were measured by nanoindentation and nanoscratch tests under which interface delamination occurred around indented regions.

As an example, for small diameter flow lines operating at ambient temperatures, a soft mastic-based adhesive may be chosen, while on large diameter pipelines operating at higher temperatures, a hard, semi-crystalline hot-melt adhesive is used.

50|$|Techniques for {{metallization}} {{started as}} early as mirror making. In 1835, Justus von Liebig discovered the process of coating a glass surface with metallic silver, making the glass mirror {{one of the earliest}} items being metallized. Plating other non-metallic objects grew rapidly with introduction of ABS plastic. Because a non-metallic object tends to be a poor electrical conductor, the object's surface must be made conductive before plating can be performed. The plastic part is first etched chemically by a suitable process, such as dipping in a hot chromic acid-sulfuric acid mixture. The etched surface is sensitised and activated by first dipping in tin(II) chloride solution, then palladium chloride solution. The processed surface is then coated with electroless copper or nickel before further plating. This process gives useful (about 1 to 6 kgf/cm or 10 to 60 N/cm or 5 to 35 lbf/in) adhesion force, but is much weaker than actual metal-to-metal <b>adhesion</b> <b>strength.</b>|$|E

Decreased expression of plakophilin-2 via siRNA leads to a decrease in and redistribution of connexin 43 protein, {{as well as a}} decrease in coupling of adjacent cardiomyocytes. Studies also showed that GJA1 and plakophilin-2 are components in the same biomolecular complex. Plakophilin-2 also associates with Na(V)1.5, and knockdown of plakophilin-2 in cardiomyocytes alters sodium current properties as well as velocity of action potential propagation. It has also been demonstrated that plakophilin-2 associates with {{an important component of the}} Na(V)1.5 complex, ankyrin G, and loss of ankyrin G via siRNA downregulation mislocalized plakophilin-2 and connexin 43 in cardiac cells, which was coordinate with decreased electrical coupling of cells and decreased <b>adhesion</b> <b>strength.</b> These studies were further supported by an investigation in a mouse model harboring a PKP2-heterozygous null mutation, which showed decreased Na(V)1.5 amplitude, as well as a shift in gating and kinetics; pharmacological challenge also induced ventricular arrhythmias. These findings further support the notion that desmosomes crosstalk with sodium channels in the heart, and suggest that the risk of arrhythmias in patients with PKP2 mutations may be unveiled with pharmacological challenge. Evidence has also shown that plakophilin-2 binds to the K(ATP) channel subunit, Kir6.2, and that in cardiomyocytes from haploinsufficient PKP2 mice, K(ATP) channel current density was â¼40% smaller and regional heterogeneity of K(ATP) channels was altered, suggesting that plakophilin-2 interacts with K(ATP) and mediates crosstalk between intercellular junctions and membrane excitability.|$|E
