40|$|The {{expected}} lifespan of {{the machine}} is very reliable and can be operated in order {{as long as possible}} without damage. Even systems "Maintenance Management" sophisticated yet become meaningless if the machines are not done properly alignment process. Approximately 70 % of the causes of damage to machinery rotation due to misalignment. Based on these conditions, the need for a method that is reliable and quick to make the process of alignment so that the production process does not experience the delay or shutdown process. In order to do that then one way that can be done is by measuring alignment aided by using software. Alignment Quest is a mechanical device used to help straighten out the connection between one machine to another. Misalignment unnecessary, since misalignment is a major cause engine damage. By using the software can save money if the machines do not happen misalignment. Preventive maintenance {{of the machine}} will make the life of the engine becomes long. Results of this study, the conclusion that the use of the software is technically Alignment Quest accelerate work in the process of rotation of the machine shaft alignment, the software will give you the results carefully if all measurement results dail indicator has high accuracy and the <b>adjustment</b> <b>shim</b> to add to the position of the machine directly viewable from the train folder...|$|E

If fat suppression remains a problem, images can be obtained without fat suppression while the patient is instructed to remain very still. Subtraction images can then be used for interpretation.|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} get the eld quality {{required}} for the undulator of the TESLA Test Facility Free Electron Laser (TTF-FEL), two steps have been foreseen. The rst step is to sort the magnets in such away that the resulting eld quality is as good as possible with the magnets at hand. The second step is to use techniques such as pole height <b>adjustment</b> and/or <b>shimming</b> to tune both x and y eld components to the required speci cations. The main purpose of the magnet sorting is to minimize corrections in the second step. Therefore, two transverse components of the eld, ideally zero, are minimized by this procedure. In this paper we outline the magnet sorting procedure using simulated annealing. For the three undulator segments for phase I of the TTF-FEL geometrical constrains were properly taken into account. The results obtained for the magnets being used are presented. ...|$|R

5000|$|The {{two halves}} of the bearing are then split at the shim, the oil holes cleared of metal and oil ways are cut into {{the surface of the}} new bearing. The shaft is smeared with engineer's blue and rotated in the bearing. When the bearing is {{disassembled}} the blue fills the hollows and is rubbed off the high spots. The high spots are scraped down, and the process repeated, until a uniform and evenly distributed pattern of blue shows when the shaft is removed. The bearing is then cleaned and lubricated, and shimmed up such that the shaft is held firmly but not binding in the bearing. The bearing is then [...] "run in" [...] by being run heavily lubricated at low load and revolution, completing the process of exposing the hard bearing surface.

40|$|The {{fabrication}} of the full-size elliptically polarizing undulator EPU 5. 6 has lunched at SRRC after the prototype {{one has been}} fabricated and tested successfully. Reviewing the prototype testing, the block sorting algorithm is to be improved. In the full-size EPU 5. 6, we have changed {{the design of the}} magnet block shape to get a larger good-field region and better field performance in tuning the polarization. Also, before the <b>shimming</b> <b>adjustment</b> of the magnets and the end-pole correction, the magnetic field measurement results of the prototype EPU 5. 6 are not satisfactory as expected. We recognize the detail field distribution of each magnet block to be responsible for the phase deviation, high harmonics of the magnetic field, and multi-pole field behavior of the EPU device. The magnetic field measurement of magnet blocks for sorting has to be studied carefully. Due to the detail field concern as well as the design changing, we have to modify the sorting algorithm and measurement procedure as presented. ...|$|R
40|$|This study aims to {{investigate}} the quality difference of short echo time (TE) breathhold 1 H magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) of the liver at 3. 0 T using the body and phased array coils, respectively. In total, 20 pairs of single-voxel proton spectra of the liver were acquired at 3. 0 T using the phased array and body coils as receivers. Consecutive stacks of breathhold spectra were acquired using the point resolved spectroscopy (PRESS) technique at a short TE of 30 ms and a repetition time (TR) of 1500 ms. The first spectroscopy sequence was "copied" for the second acquisition to ensure identical voxel positioning. The MRS prescan <b>adjustments</b> of <b>shimming</b> and water suppression, signal-to noise ratio (SNR), and major liver quantitative information were compared between paired spectra. Theoretical calculation of the SNR and homogeneity of the region of interest (ROI, 2 cm× 2 cm× 2 cm) using different coils loaded with 3 D liver electromagnetic model of real human body was implemented in the theoretical analysis. The theoretical analysis showed that, inside the ROI, the SNR of the phase array coil was 2. 8387 times larger than that of body coil and the homogeneity of the phase array coil and body coil was 80. 10 % and 93. 86 %, respectively. The experimental results showed excellent correlations between the paired data (all r > 0. 86). Compared with the body coil group, the phased array group had slightly worse shimming effect and better SNR (all P values 0. 05).

30|$|In this study, outriggers, {{which are}} {{horizontal}} structures connecting a building core to distant columns {{to increase the}} lateral stiffness of a tall building, are proposed to reduce DAS. Conventionally, the permanent connection of outriggers to perimeter columns is delayed until {{the completion of the}} structure to avoid the development of shear forces that could be caused by DAS because the outriggers have been conventionally designed to reduce the lateral displacement caused by wind or earthquake loads. Special construction methods, such as delayed joints and <b>adjustment</b> joints with <b>shim</b> plates or oil jacks, have been proposed or used to minimize the impact of DAS during construction (Choi and Joseph 2012; Park et al. 2010). Although the main purpose of the outriggers is to limit the lateral drift of a tall building within an acceptable level (Wu and Li 2003; Hoenderkamp 2008; Lee and Tovar 2014), it is proposed that outriggers can also function as a measure to reduce DAS between core walls and perimeter columns. If the outriggers are designed to reduce DAS and lateral displacement, the additional stresses caused by DAS should be evaluated and considered during the design phase of a tall building.|$|R
5000|$|The Gibson Victory was an {{electric}} guitar produced by Gibson Guitars from 1981 until 1983 (although some sources say production lasted until 1984). [...] During the late 1970s and early 1980s, musicians watched Eddie Van Halen play his Frankenstrat and questioned and rethought everything about their instruments. They insisted on engineering advances allowing more speed and playability of skyscraping leads and rock crushing shred. The master luthiers in Kalamazoo responded to these demanding guitarists by designing the Victory. The Victory, a superstrat, was {{radical departure from}} Gibson's image as an old-fashioned guitar maker. MV stood for Multi-Voice. X stood for ten They were created by the Gibson research and development team in Kalamazoo, MI, with the body work by Chuck Burge, and the multi-voice electronics by Tim Shaw. The Victory MV's were available with an optional / special order Kahler Tremolo System. The Victory MV's had a three-point top-adjust [...] "tune-o-matic" [...] bridge designed by  Rendal Wall and patent granted in June 1982. The three post holes in the underside allow {{either side of the}} bridge unit to be moved forwards or backwards for intonation of ultra light to extremely heavy string gauges, and twelve interchangeable individually-adjustable saddles, six standard nylon saddles and 6 optional brass saddles to set the fine intonation and affect tone. The Victory MV's came with a series of specially designed Humbucker Pickups carefully made one at a time on the “center focused” KZ/LP115 PAF Pickup Winder, with high sensitivity and unique tonal signature with fewer turns of wire compared to high production winding machines that produce more scatter and a wider magnetic aperture, Each pickup across the range was different, and specifically designed for the role it was assigned. The location of the Pickups were carefully calculated to provide full frequency response and minimize dead spots by avoidance of string nodal points. Humbucker pickups are inherently low noise because the interference is significantly reduced via phase cancellation, however the Victory MV’s had additional shielding connected to ground with the use of special electrically conductive black paint in the routed out area under the pickguard. Truly silent when it should be. The coil tap switch in the up position is humbucker; in the down position is single coil. Gibson had well established business agreements for over 100 years with the best wood suppliers in the world and Gibson Luthiers had first pick to craft the Victory MV's. The availability of premium old growth wood with tight grain was better in the 1980s than it is today because of new laws and limited natural resources. The Victory MV's body and tri-laminated quartersawn neck was crafted from solid eastern hard rock maple, with a Janka Hardness ranking of 1450 pound-force, a crushing strength of 7,830 pound-force per square inch , and a tensile elasticity modulus of 1,830,000 pound-force per square inch, eastern hard rock maple is extremely hard, dense, and stiff, producing earthquaking sustain. [...] The tri-laminate opposing wood grain neck design strengthened the overall neck and gave more tuning stabilization. Evidence shows that wood improves with age, the polymerization of sap over decades, once the wood is removed from the living tree crystalizes. Aged wood also loses its ability to absorb moisture, causing the wood to become more stiff and stable as it ages… the perfect recipe for a straight, high quality guitar neck, level fret board, and great sound. The Victory MV's Set-in neck [...] and silky smooth rock-hard quartersawn Madagascan ebony fret board required better tools, more time, accuracy, attention to detail, and skill to craft, but produces a warmer fuller tone and transfers resonant energy freely and immediately due to the tight permanent coupling, and facilitates ripples of vibrational energy that round out and thicken the sound, in comparison to buzzy guitars with removable screw-on necks having a metal plate and <b>adjustment</b> <b>shims.</b> The chamfered cutaway offers musicians with large hands better access to play in the top frets. The fourteen degree pitch headstock shape and tuning machine alignment allows for a perfectly straight pull on the strings and optimum string down pressure. The Gibson Victory MV's are not recommended for the weak, these sledge axes weigh a solid nine pounds but are perfectly balanced both on the strap or on the knee, Luthiers know guitars with more mass and density have more brilliance and sustain. in fact some older Gibson models weighed as much as twelve pounds. According to Gibson, Victory MV’s were only produced in Candy Apple Red, Antique Cherry Sunburst, & Twilight Blue. However sometimes a retailer who did a lot of business with Gibson would be able to ask for a small number of guitars with a special finish. Mention has been made of Roy Orbison's special order black Victory MVX. [...] The Victory MV's came standard with a rugged black Gibson branded [...] "8170" [...] dual lock and key padded hard case with internal storage box. Decode the serial number {{on the back of the}} headstock to determine where your Victory was made and the date of it's manufacture.|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVES: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{quantify}} the influence of image resolution on the apparent transverse relaxivity (R 2 *) of the magnetic resonance (MR) signal in human renal tissue in vivo and in phantom measurements. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This prospective study included 17 healthy volunteers (age, 32 ± 8 years, 6 women). Parametrical R 2 * maps were computed via monoexponential fitting of multiecho 2 -dimensional fast-field echo data measured at 1. 5 T (repetition time [TR], 150 milliseconds; flip angle [FA], 40 °; minimum echo time [TE], 4. 6 milliseconds; ΔTE, 5 milliseconds; 16 echoes) and at 3 T (TR, 140 milliseconds; FA, 70 °; minimum TE, 2 milliseconds; ΔTE, 5 milliseconds; 16 echoes) with varying nominal volumes of the encoded voxels (from 5. 76 to 36. 0 mm). For each voxel size, mean R 2 * values were computed in regions of interest drawn in the left and right renal parenchyma. For data acquired using minimum voxel size, the mean R 2 * values were computed over the cortex and medulla separately. The squared 2 -norm of the residuals was computed to evaluate the goodness of the pixel-wise exponential fits. Six multiecho MR images of a water phantom were acquired using a 2 -dimensional fast-field echo sequence (FA, 50 °; TR, 108 milliseconds; TE, 4 milliseconds; ΔTE, 20 milliseconds) at 3 T after <b>shim</b> <b>adjustment</b> and in the presence of a uniform background gradient of 40 μT/m. The nominal voxel size was varied in a range between 2 and 12. 5 mm. RESULTS: Mean R 2 * values of 13. 04 ± 0. 71 s (right renal cortex) and 16. 47 ± 1. 92 s (right renal medulla) were computed at 1. 5 T. At 3 T, the R 2 * of the right medulla was 28. 27 ± 1. 52 s and the cortical R 2 * was 19. 22 ± 2. 32 s. Comparable relaxivity values were found over the left kidney at both field strengths. Increasing R 2 * values were observed for increasing voxel volume in both the water phantom and renal tissue data. At a constant slice thickness of 4 mm, the decrease in the in-plane resolution from 1. 2 × 1. 2 mm to 3. 0 × 3. 0 mm led to a maximum increase of the renal R 2 * of 15 % at 1. 5 T and of 12 % at 3 T. Increasing the slice thickness from 3 to 8 mm at a constant in-plane resolution of 1. 5 × 1. 5 mm resulted in a maximum increase of the renal R 2 * of 30 % at 1. 5 T and of 26 % at 3 T. On the other hand, increasing the voxel size improved the goodness of the fit implied by the smaller residuals. CONCLUSIONS: The phantom experiments and in vivo acquisitions of healthy renal tissue documented a significant dependence of the apparent R 2 * relaxation rate on the spatial resolution of the MR imaging data. In clinical practice, the voxel volume for the quantification of renal R 2 * should be optimized in a compromise between minimizing the effects of macroscopic field inhomogeneity and maintaining a sufficiently high signal-to-noise ratio and goodness of fit. When comparing quantitative R 2 * among different publications, the influence of the spatial resolution should be taken into account...|$|R
