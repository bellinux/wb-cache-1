25|$|When the Invisalign {{system was}} first developed, {{many of the}} <b>aligner</b> {{manufacturing}} processes were carried out by hand, and computer technicians had to modify each tooth in the computerized model individually.|$|E
25|$|ClearCorrect {{was founded}} in Houston, Texas, by Willis Pumphrey, Jr., a dentist. In 2001, Pumphrey started using Invisalign. He decided to switch to OrthoClear, {{because of the way}} OrthoClear {{manufactured}} its aligners and because of its reduced lab fees. When manufacture of Orthoclear ceased, Pumphrey had 400 patients in treatment. With no other options available, he started his own company to complete his patients' clear <b>aligner</b> treatment.|$|E
30|$|StreamAligner has {{two main}} {{advantages}} over state-of-the-art sequence <b>aligners.</b> Firstly, {{it is the}} only sequence alignment tool which can align stream of reads on reference genome to give real time results. Secondly, it needs to upload sorted suffix index only once for unlimited tasks whereas all state-of-the-art sequence <b>aligners</b> either need to generate (hash based <b>aligners)</b> or upload (sorted index based <b>aligners)</b> index for every task.|$|R

50|$|A {{computer}} {{graphic representation}} of the projected teeth movements, created in the software program ClinCheck, is provided {{to the doctor and}} patient for approval or modification before <b>aligners</b> are manufactured. The <b>aligners</b> are modeled using CAD-CAM (computer-aided-design and computer-aided-manufacturing) software and manufactured using a rapid prototyping technique called stereolithography. The molds for the <b>aligners</b> are built in layers using a photo-sensitive liquid resin that cures into a hard plastic when exposed to a laser. The <b>aligners</b> are made from an elastic thermoplastic material that applies pressure to the teeth to move into the <b>aligner's</b> position. Patients that need a tooth rotated or pulled down may have a small, tooth-colored composite attachment bonded onto certain teeth. More attachments can make the <b>aligners</b> less aesthetically pleasing. Reproximation, (also called interproximal reduction or IPR and colloquially, filing or drilling), is sometimes used at the contacts between teeth to allow for a better fit.|$|R
25|$|The litigious {{history in}} the clear <b>aligner</b> market {{prompted}} ClearCorrect to be proactive in addressing patent issues between itself and Align Technology. Align had previously {{filed a complaint with}} the U.S. International Trade Commission against OrthoClear Inc., In the end an agreement was made between Align and OrthoClear in which Align paid OrthoClear $20 million for its intellectual property and OrthoClear agreed to stop accepting cases in the United States.|$|E
25|$|Clear-aligner {{treatment}} {{involves an}} orthodontist or dentist, or with home-based systems, the person themselves, taking a mold of the patient's teeth, {{which is used}} to create a digital tooth scan. The computerized model suggests stages between the current and desired teeth positions, and aligners are created for each stage. Each <b>aligner</b> is worn for 20 hours a day for two weeks. These slowly move the teeth into the position agreed between the orthodonist/dentist and the patient. The average treatment time is 13.5 months.|$|E
25|$|Trimmed {{sequences}} {{from the}} previous step are aligned to the reference genome using Burrows-Wheeler <b>aligner</b> (BWA) and the unmapped reads are removed. The aligned reads that have the same 24 bp tag sequence and genomic region are detected and grouped together (Family αβ and βα in the figure 2). Each group represents a “tag family”. Tag families with lower than three members are removed from the analysis. To remove errors arise during PCR amplification or sequencing, mutations that are supported by less than 70% of the members (reads) are filtered out from the analysis. Then a consensus sequence is generated for each family using the identical sequences in each position of the remaining reads. The consensus sequence is called single strand consensus sequence (SSCS). The SSCS method increases the NGS accuracy to about 20 fold higher, however this method relies on the sequencing information from single strands of DNA and therefore is sensitive to the errors induced at the first round or before PCR amplification.|$|E

2500|$|Bacteria were {{at first}} {{classified}} {{based solely on}} their shape (vibrio, bacillus, coccus etc.), presence of endospores, gram stain, aerobic conditions and motility.

The quickest way to identify to match an isolated strain to a species or genus today is done by amplifying it's 16S gene with universal primers and sequence the 1.4kb amplicon and submit it to a specialised web-based identification database, namely either Ribosomal Database Project, which align the sequence to other 16S sequences using infernal, a secondary structure bases global alignment, or ARB SILVA, which aligns sequences via SINA (SILVA incremental <b>aligner),</b> which does a local alignment of a seed and extends it [...]|$|E

30|$|In this study, {{approximately}} 70 % of the orthodontists {{had been}} in practice for more than 20  years, {{and half of the}} orthodontists were routinely treating patients with <b>aligners.</b> Only 3 cases out of 20 cases (15 %) had {{more than half of the}} practitioners recommend clear <b>aligners.</b> These cases tended to be the less severe malocclusions.

40|$|Next-generation {{sequencing}} (NGS) {{technology has}} rapidly advanced and generated the massive data volumes. To align and map the NGS data, biologists often randomly select {{a number of}} <b>aligners</b> without concerning their suitable feature, high performance, and high accuracy as well as sequence variations and polymorphisms existing on reference genome. This study aims to systematically evaluate and compare the capability of multiple <b>aligners</b> for NGS data analysis. To explore this capability, we firstly performed alignment algorithms comparison and classification. We further used long-read and short-read datasets from both real-life and in silico NGS data for comparative analysis and evaluation of these <b>aligners</b> focusing on three criteria, namely, application-specific alignment feature, computational performance, and alignment accuracy. Our study demonstrated the overall evaluation and comparison of multiple <b>aligners</b> for NGS data analysis. This serves as an important guiding resource for biologists to gain further insight into suitable selection of <b>aligners</b> for specific and broad applications...|$|R

40|$|Next-generation {{sequencing}} technologies {{provide an}} unparallelled {{opportunity for the}} characterization and discovery of known and novel viruses. Because viruses {{are known to have}} the highest mutation rates when compared to eukaryotic and bacterial organisms, we assess the extent to which eleven well-known alignment algorithms (BLAST, BLAT, BWA, BWA-SW, BWA-MEM, BFAST, Bowtie 2, Novoalign, GSNAP, SHRiMP 2 and STAR) can be used for characterizing mutated and non-mutated viral sequences- including those that exhibit RNA splicing- in transcriptome samples. To evaluate <b>aligners</b> objectively we developed a realistic RNA-Seq simulation and evaluation framework (RiSER) and propose a new combined score to rank <b>aligners</b> for viral characterization in terms of their precision, sensitivity and alignment accuracy. We used RiSER to simulate both human and viral read sequences and suggest the best set of <b>aligners</b> for viral sequence characterization in human transcriptome samples. Our results show that significant and substantial differences exist between <b>aligners</b> and that a digital-subtraction-based viral identification framework can and should use different <b>aligners</b> for different parts of the process. We {{determine the extent to which}} mutated viral sequences can be effectively characterized and show that more sensitive <b>aligners</b> such as BLAST, BFAST, SHRiMP 2, BWA-SW and GSNAP can accurately characterize substantially divergent viral sequences with up to 15 % overall sequence mutation rate. We believe that the results presented here will be useful to researchers choosing <b>aligners</b> for viral sequence characterization using next-generation sequencing data...|$|R

30|$|Fixed {{orthodontic}} appliances might {{be associated with}} intraoral adverse effects on enamel, due to plaque accumulation and their colonization by oral microbes.
