5|$|Although {{formally}} {{separate from}} Greek Orthodox and Latin (Catholic) Christians, the Armenians consider their quarter {{to be part}} of the Christian Quarter. The three Christian patriarchates of Jerusalem and the government of Armenia have publicly expressed their opposition to any political division of the two quarters. The central reasons for the existence of a separate Armenian Quarter is the miaphysitism and distinct language and culture of the Armenians, who, unlike the majority of Christians in Jerusalem (also in Israel and Palestine), are neither Arab nor Palestinian. However, for all intents <b>and</b> <b>purposes,</b> the Armenians living in the Armenian Quarter are considered Palestinians by Israel and the United Nations (UN). They have faced many of the same restrictions on their lives as have the Palestinians.|$|E
5|$|As the French {{constructed}} further fortifications, Luftwaffe {{reconnaissance aircraft}} {{picked up the}} activity and reported it. The steep slopes {{on the banks of}} the Meuse, added to what appeared in photographic reconnaissance to be a formidable barrier of bunkers and defence lines, caused Field Marshal Gerd von Rundstedt, the commander in chief of Army Group A, to question the wisdom of Guderian in choosing Sedan as the point of maximum effort. To identify how strong these fortifications were, a team of photographic specialists were called in to evaluate the pictures. Their analysis concluded that what appeared to be strong fortified positions were just the construction sites of half-built bunkers that were, to all intents <b>and</b> <b>purposes,</b> empty shells. The contribution of the specialists tilted the Sedan attack plan into Guderian's favour.|$|E

40|$|Meaning <b>and</b> <b>purpose</b> in {{life are}} {{important}} aspects of the life experience of individuals. These aspects of life have often been studied using psychological and quantitative approaches addressing meaning <b>and</b> <b>purpose</b> across the life span. However, there is a dearth of studies of meaning <b>and</b> <b>purpose</b> in care home (nursing) life. This care sector has an important contribution to make nationally and internationally to the lives of older people who require long-term care. This study addresses the gap in the body of knowledge by exploring how to enhance meaning <b>and</b> <b>purpose</b> in the lives of care home (nursing) residents. This study of meaning <b>and</b> <b>purpose</b> in the lives of care home (nursing) residents was undertaken using an appreciative inquiry methodology. Two U. K. care homes (nursing) were the settings for the study; 20 residents and 25 members of staff were included in the sample of the study. The residents who participated in the study had moved into the care homes because of their physical disabilities. None of the residents who participated in the study had appreciable cognitive incapacity. Data were collected using life story interviews, structured interviews and focus groups. Data were constructed during the four stages of appreciative inquiry: Discovery, Dream, Design and Destiny. The data were analysed using the Framework Analysis approach. The findings of the study provide clear definitions of meaning <b>and</b> <b>purpose</b> in care home (nursing) life. The knowledge generated addresses the required focus on the creation of opportunities for residents to flourish and optimise their potential in order to enhance meaning <b>and</b> <b>purpose</b> in their lives. The ways in which care home staff can support residents enhance meaning <b>and</b> <b>purpose</b> in their care home experience through the physical setting, valuing of residents’ identities, the dynamics of relationships, the focus of activities and the component of care are articulated. This study presents the benefits of appreciative inquiry dialogue as a way of enhancing meaning <b>and</b> <b>purpose</b> in the lives of care home residents...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Meaning <b>and</b> <b>purpose</b> in {{life are}} {{fundamental}} to human beings. In changing times, with an aging population and increased life expectancy, the need for health care services and long-term care is likely to grow. More deeply understanding how older long-term care residents perceive meaning <b>and</b> <b>purpose</b> in life is critical for {{improving the quality of}} care and the residents’ quality of life. The {{purpose of this study was}} to explore crucial aspects promoting nursing home residents’ experience of meaning <b>and</b> <b>purpose</b> in everyday life. Method An exploratory hermeneutical design with qualitative interviews for collecting data. Results Four key experiences were found to promote meaning <b>and</b> <b>purpose</b> in life: 1) physical and mental well-being, 2) belonging and recognition, 3) personally treasured activities and 4) spiritual closeness and connectedness. Conclusion In supporting meaning <b>and</b> <b>purpose</b> in life of nursing home residents, the residents’ everyday well-being should be a central focus of care and facilitate personally treasured activities. Focused attention should also be given to the meaning-making power of experiencing belonging, recognition and spiritual connectedness...|$|R
40|$|Knowing cause <b>and</b> <b>purpose</b> can {{enable a}} useful {{flexibility}} in {{thought and action}} that {{is more likely to}} produce a desired outcome. Some teachers, particularly trainees, new teachers, and those without a strong background in technology, may not address this kind of knowledge. Could children's technology textbooks provide a model of practice for such teachers? This study examined 24 books intended for children aged 7 - 11 years in Design and Technology lessons in England. It was found that some books had little potential as models of practice in this regard. Others showed some concern for cause <b>and</b> <b>purpose</b> in connection with conceptual knowledge. Few, if any, addressed cause <b>and</b> <b>purpose</b> to do with procedural knowledge. It was concluded that these textbooks varied greatly in their potential to guide teachers to address cause <b>and</b> <b>purpose</b> <b>and</b> to exemplify practice. The danger is that new or non-specialist teachers may be guided by a book that shows no explicit concern for particular kinds of cause <b>and</b> <b>purpose.</b> The problem is that such teachers may not recognise the deficiencies of such books. Some implications for teacher training are discussed...|$|R

5|$|Šuljak and von Krempler soon {{fell out}} over the aims <b>and</b> <b>purposes</b> of the {{proposed}} division. Šuljak, an entirely political appointee, criticized von Krempler's Serbian dialect and his use of traditional Islamic colours and emblems (green flags and crescent moons) during the recruitment drive rather than the Ustaše symbols. When he reached Tuzla in central Bosnia, von Krempler met with the militia leader Hadžiefendić. On 28 March, Hadžiefendić escorted von Krempler to Sarajevo, where he {{introduced him to the}} leader of Bosnia's Islamic clergy, Hafiz Muhamed Pandža, the reis-ul-ulema, as well as other leading Muslim politicians not involved with the Ustaše. The NDH government and Kasche were furious, demanding von Krempler's immediate removal. The SS ignored the demand and von Krempler continued recruiting, including deserters from the NDH armed forces.|$|E
5|$|Production of {{components}} would be split between Breguet and BAC, and the aircraft themselves would be assembled on two production lines; {{one in the}} UK and one in France, To avoid any duplication of work, each aircraft component had only one source. The British light strike/tactical support versions were the most demanding design, requiring supersonic performance, superior avionics, a cutting edge nav/attack system of more accuracy and complexity than the French version, moving map display, laser range-finder and marked-target seeker (LRMTS). As a result, the initial Br.121 design needed a thinner wing, redesigned fuselage, a higher rear cockpit, and after-burning engines. While putting on smiling faces for the public, maintaining {{the illusion of a}} shared design, the British design de facto departed from the French sub-sonic Breguet 121 {{to such a degree that}} it was for all intents <b>and</b> <b>purposes</b> a new design.|$|E
5|$|Theodore's brother Manuel, {{who managed}} to escape from Klokotnitsa, now took over the throne in Thessalonica. His domain was reduced to the environs {{of the city and}} his family's core territories in Epirus and Thessaly, as well as Dyrrhachium and Corfu, while his brother Constantine in Aetolia and Acarnania {{recognized}} his suzerainty. As a son-in-law of John Asen, Manuel was allowed to maintain internal autonomy, but to all intents <b>and</b> <b>purposes</b> he was a client of the Bulgarian Tsar. At about the same time, Michael I's bastard son Michael II returned from exile and quickly succeeded, apparently {{with the support of the}} local population, in taking over control of Epirus. Manuel was forced to recognize the fait accompli under the pretense that Michael recognized his suzerainty, in token of which Manuel conferred him the title of Despot. In reality Michael was fully independent, and very quickly ceased to acknowledge Manuel's suzerainty; by 1236, he had seized Corfu. In order to preserve some freedom of manoeuvre and counter Asen's attempts to subordinate the Epirote Church to the Bulgarian Church of Tarnovo, Manuel turned to his brother's erstwhile rivals in Nicaea and brought an end to the ecclesiastical schism by acknowledging the legitimacy and superiority of the Nicaea-based Patriarch.|$|E

5|$|Inspired by Hirschfeld's {{work with}} the Scientific-Humanitarian Committee, Gerber {{resolved}} to found a similar organization in the United States. He called his group the Society for Human Rights (the English translation of Bund für Menschenrecht) and took {{on the role of}} secretary. Gerber filed an application for a charter as a non-profit organization with the state of Illinois on December 10, 1924. The application outlined the goals <b>and</b> <b>purposes</b> of the Society: o promote and protect the interests of people who by reasons of mental and physical abnormalities are abused and hindered in the legal pursuit of happiness which is guaranteed them by the Declaration of Independence and to combat the public prejudices against them by dissemination of factors according to modern science among intellectuals of mature age. The Society stands only for law and order; it is in harmony with any and all general laws insofar as they protect the rights of others, and does in no manner recommend any acts in violation of present laws nor advocate any manner inimical to the public welfare. An African American clergyman named John T. Graves signed on as president of the new organization and Gerber, Graves and five others were listed as directors. The state granted the charter on December 24, 1924, making the Society the oldest documented homosexual organization in the nation. Despite deliberately keeping the goals of the Society vague and excluding any mention of homosexuality from its mission statement, Society members were still surprised that no one with the state investigated any further before issuing the charter.|$|E
