5|$|The film {{references}} Resident Evil, {{with the}} crash site of the helicopter being located in the Arklay Forest near the Arklay Mountains, where the Resident Evil series began. Other similarities include Jill's moves from the first game. The recording of Terri's death is similar to Kenneth's death. A white goddess statue {{can be seen in}} the church, with artwork of goddesses having a large role in the puzzles of the Resident Evil series. Whilst walking on the Arklay Overpass, Jill speculates that there is no way out, and that Ashford may just be watching them on the cameras, <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> thing were some sort of sick game. The games use a fixed camera perspective, which in most of the earlier games resembles a mounted camera's perspective. Another similarity includes a scene where Jill finds a gun under a pew, mirroring the game when the player finds ammunition or weapons in certain areas.|$|E
500|$|Snowball V, later renamed Snowball II, is the Simpson family's fifth cat and {{is almost}} {{identical}} in appearance to Snowball II. In [...] "I, (Annoyed Grunt)-Bot", the Crazy Cat Lady gives Lisa {{one of her}} cats while she is mourning {{the death of her}} other four cats that are killed in the episode. Lisa then tells the cat to leave, as any cat that she owns is unlucky and is certain to be killed. As the cat starts to cross Evergreen Terrace, a car driven by Gil Gunderson drives past. As Gil swerves to avoid hitting the cat, his car hits a tree and bursts into flames, thereby giving him insurance compensation for his meals. Since the cat is intact and whole, Lisa takes it as a sign of good luck and adopts her. Lisa renames Snowball V [...] "Snowball II" [...] {{at the end of the}} episode, in her words [...] "to save money on a new dish", also promising to act <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> thing did not actually happen. Snowball V also is the focus of a subplot in the sixteenth season episode [...] "The Seven-Beer Snitch", in which she becomes overweight after abandoning the Simpsons for brief periods to visit a different family but she then goes back to live with the Simpson family. Snowball V dies after being accidentally stabbed by Rachel's knife after Rachel tried to kill Marge in [...] "BFF RIP", but this is non-canon since this was a Treehouse of Horror segment.|$|E
500|$|The animators {{were told}} to make a {{detailed}} replica of the city. David Silverman was sent to Manhattan to take hundreds of pictures {{of the city and}} areas around the World Trade Center. When he returned, Lance Wilder and his team spent time creating new scenes and backgrounds, incorporating small details such as signs and hundreds of extras that would correctly illustrate the city. Oakley and Weinstein were pleased with the final results, and both noted that the buildings, streets, and even elevator cabins were detailed closely to their real life counterparts. In the final scene, as the family is seen driving away from New York on the George Washington Bridge, the credits roll with the [...] "camera" [...] gradually pulling back from a view of the car, to a view of the side, and then on to a panorama view of the city; <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> sequence was being shot from a helicopter. To achieve this effect, a computer model of the bridge pulling out was made and then printed out. With the print outs, photocopies were made traced onto the animation cels. The process took a long time and was expensive, as the use of computer animation was not widespread when the episode was produced. Director Jim Reardon wanted to replicate films that ended in a similar way, and commented, [...] "I remembered that every movie located in New York would pull back if you were leaving town on a bridge." [...] Shortly before the episode aired, the production staff contacted Fox to make sure they would not run commercials during the credits.|$|E
5000|$|The {{preposition}} [...] "van" [...] is {{the most}} widely used preposition in Dutch surnames, but many others are also used, although not always recognized <b>as</b> such <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> surname is written as a single word.

2500|$|Elizabeth's {{life changed}} irrevocably on 11 September 1227 when Louis, {{en route to}} join the Sixth Crusade, died of a fever in Otranto, Italy, {{just a few weeks}} before the birth of her {{daughter}} Gertrude. [...] Upon hearing the news of her husband's death, Elizabeth reportedly said, [...] "He is dead. He is dead. It is to me <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> world died today." [...] His remains were returned to Elizabeth in 1228 and entombed at the Abbey of Reinhardsbrunn.|$|E
2500|$|Out of this {{situation}} evolved an uproar, which through the shouting and clamour and an inexplicable {{growth in the number}} of participants in the struggle soon assumed a truly demoniacal character. It looked to me <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> town would break out into a riot...Then suddenly I heard a heavy thump, and as if by magic the whole crowd dispersed in every direction...One of the regular patrons had felled one of the noisiest rioters ... And it was the effect of this which had scattered everybody so suddenly.|$|E
2500|$|PopMatters {{reviewer}} James Beaudreau further {{notes that}} Coltrane's performance in [...] "Ogunde" [...] reflects the personal style that he evolved {{prior to his}} death: [...] "ecstatic, brightly focused, and with a kaleidoscopic vibrato". [...] According to Beaudreau, the starting phrase of [...] "Ogunde", which features Coltrane, [...] "sounds like an ending, <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> of the music could {{be summed up in}} a single noble cadence". [...] The song is characterized by a sequence that features multiple performers and sounds and includes a fourteen-minute period, starting at 2:40, for which Coltrane is completely absent, and which is dominated by the sounds of Sanders' saxophone and Alice Coltrane's piano, as well as lengthy solos by Coltrane, Sanders, and Alice.|$|E

2500|$|To {{promote the}} album, Wakeman played {{excerpts}} from {{it on the}} BBC 2 television music show The Old Grey Whistle Test on 16 January 1973. Show producer Colin Strong and director Mike Appleton contacted A who got staffer Tony Burdfield to send them a copy, and liked the album which led to Wakeman being invited on the show. Wakeman brought along Cronk and Cousins to play the additional parts. Prior to recording they got drunk in the studio bar. An audience of around 10 million planned to watch a controversial film about American pop figure Andy Warhol on ITV, but was temporarily banned for screening. Wakeman recalled: [...] "It seems most of them, rather than watch repeats, switched over to Whistle Test and saw my preview of 'Henry'...and suddenly it seemed <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> country had discovered my music...it was a tremendous break".|$|E
2500|$|During the Chicago game, 1,000 {{students}} {{gathered at}} the Athens Theater in Ann Arbor where they listened to a play-by-play account of the game as it was transmitted by telegraph from Chicago. [...] Michigan gains were met with cheering. [...] When Widman's touchdown run was announced, [...] "It seemed <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> assembly was thrown into the air by a volcanic eruption. Men threw their hats and coats at one another and hugged and danced in the aisles for fully ten minutes." [...] After the game, the crowd marched through the streets to President James B. Angell's home. [...] President Angell greeted the crowd with a broad smile and said, [...] "I congratulate you {{on the success of}} the Michigan team in Chicago this afternoon. [...] It is a great victory, and we owe much to the men who have won the laurels of our victory from the brow of our sister institution of learning. [...] It has been said that I am opposed to the game, but I wish to say that I, too, used to play in college. [...] In those days, however, we played the Herschberger game, and used to kick the ball instead of the man. [...] It is a great termination of the fall campaign, and we are greatly indebted to those who have so actively participated in it." ...|$|E
2500|$|Two {{weeks in}} advance of the filming, the real Henry Hill was paid $480,000. The film was shot on {{location}} in Queens, New York, New Jersey, and parts of Long Island during {{the spring and summer of}} 1989, with a budget of $25 million. Scorsese broke the film down into sequences and storyboarded everything because of the complicated style throughout. According to the filmmaker, he [...] "wanted lots of movement and I wanted it to be throughout the whole picture, and I wanted the style to kind of break down by the end, so that by [...] last day as a wiseguy, it's <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> picture would be out of control, give the impression he's just going to spin off the edge and fly out." [...] He claims that the film's style comes from the first two or three minutes of Jules and Jim (1962): extensive narration, quick edits, freeze frames, and multiple locale switches. It was this reckless attitude towards convention that mirrored the attitude of many of the gangsters in the film. Scorsese remarked, [...] "So if you do the movie, you say, 'I don't care if there's too much narration. Too many quick cuts?—That's too bad.' It's that kind of really punk attitude we're trying to show". He adopted a frenetic style to almost overwhelm the audience with images and information. He also put plenty of detail in every frame because the gangster life is so rich. The use of freeze frames was done because Scorsese wanted images that would stop [...] "because a point was being reached" [...] in Henry's life.|$|E

The park is set up to give a more natural appearance than typical urban ones with extensive use of natural materials. Swings are three people wide as {{are some of the}} slides.|$|R
