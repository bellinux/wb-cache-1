40|$|Background: Microalbuminuria {{was much}} more common among obese {{individuals}} indicating a probable association with obesity. However, association of microalbuminuria with interaction between <b>obesity</b> <b>and</b> central <b>obesity</b> {{has not yet been}} studied. Design and Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted in a 2889 general population aged $ 30 years. Obesity was defined as body mass index$ 28. 0 kg/m 2 <b>and</b> central <b>obesity</b> was defined as waist-to-hip ratio$ 0. 85 for females and$ 0. 90 for males. Both additive and multipliable interactions between <b>obesity</b> <b>and</b> central <b>obesity</b> on elevated urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio (UACR) were evaluated. Results: After controlling for potential covariates, participants with both <b>obesity</b> <b>and</b> central <b>obesity</b> have significantly increased risk for elevated UACR (OR = 1. 82 P, 0. 001) compared to those with neither. Additive interaction analysis indicated that about 43. 9 % of the risk of elevated UACR in participants with both <b>obesity</b> <b>and</b> central <b>obesity</b> was attributed to the interaction between <b>obesity</b> <b>and</b> central <b>obesity</b> (the attributable proportion because of the interaction: 0. 439; 95 % CI: 0. 110 – 0. 768). The multipliable interactive effect between <b>obesity</b> <b>and</b> central <b>obesity</b> on elevated UACR was not found significant (OR = 1. 82, P = 0. 078). Conclusions: Microalbuminuria was significantly associated with the interaction between <b>obesity</b> <b>and</b> central <b>obesity.</b> Our results indicated that individuals with both <b>obesity</b> <b>and</b> central <b>obesity</b> should be intensively managed to prevent renal diseases...|$|R

5|$|Certain {{physical}} and mental illnesses and the pharmaceutical substances used to treat them can increase risk of obesity. Medical illnesses that increase obesity risk include several rare genetic syndromes (listed above) {{as well as some}} congenital or acquired conditions: hypothyroidism, Cushing's syndrome, growth hormone deficiency, and the eating disorders: binge eating disorder and night eating syndrome. However, obesity is not regarded as a psychiatric disorder, and therefore is not listed in the DSM-IVR as a psychiatric illness. The risk of overweight <b>and</b> <b>obesity</b> is higher in patients with psychiatric disorders than in persons without psychiatric disorders.|$|E

40|$|Background &amp; Objective: It is {{essential}} to conduct studies on factors related to obesity in both reproductive ages and menopausal period. The {{aim of this study}} was to describe the prevalence of general <b>and</b> android <b>obesity</b> <b>and</b> to assess determinants of overweight in pre- and post-menopausal women. Methods &amp; Materials: In this cross-sectional, random survey of households, about 610 women 20 - 65 years were recruited. Data were collected via interviews with the participants. Weight, height, waist and hip circumferences were measured as well. The Body Mass Index (BMI) and the waist to hip ratio (WHR) were calculated. Overweight <b>and</b> general <b>obesity</b> were defined as 25 &le;BMI&lt; 30 and BMI&ge; 30, respectively. Android obesity was defined as WHR&ge; 0. 85. Results: The prevalence of overweight <b>and</b> general <b>obesity</b> was 90. 6 % in the premenopausal women; and 72. 6 % in the post-menopausal women. About 75 % and 41. 9 % of pre- and post-menopausal women had android obesity, respectively. Low literate post-menopausal women had significantly more general <b>and</b> android <b>obesities.</b> In addition, postmenopausal women with more parity had more android obesity. Pre-menopausal women with low literacy and housewives had significantly more general <b>and</b> android <b>obesities.</b> In addition, pre-menopausal women with more parity had less general <b>obesity</b> <b>and</b> more android <b>obesity.</b> In these women, android obesity was increased with age and decreased with physical activity. Conclusion: The prevalence of general <b>and</b> android <b>obesities</b> was high in Islamshahr women, especially in the post-menopausal women.

5|$|Alcohol has a {{long history}} of use and misuse {{throughout}} recorded history. Biblical, Egyptian and Babylonian sources record the history of abuse and dependence on alcohol. In some ancient cultures alcohol was worshiped and in others, its abuse was condemned. Excessive alcohol misuse and drunkenness were recognized as causing social problems even thousands of years ago. However, the defining of habitual drunkenness as it was then known as and its adverse consequences were not well established medically until the 18th century. In 1647 a Greek monk named Agapios was the first to document that chronic alcohol misuse was associated with toxicity to the nervous system and body which resulted in a range of medical disorders such as seizures, paralysis, and internal bleeding. In 1920 the effects of alcohol abuse and chronic drunkenness led to the failed prohibition of alcohol being considered and eventually enforced briefly in America. In 2005 alcohol dependence and abuse was estimated to cost the US economy approximately 220 billion dollars per year, more than cancer <b>and</b> <b>obesity.</b>|$|E

Brezhnev had rarely appeared in public for most of 1982 and was usually surrounded by doctors, although the Soviet Government insisted that he was not ill. He suffered a severe stroke in May 1982, but refused to relinquish office until he died on 10 November 1982 after suffering a heart attack. He was honoured with a state funeral in the Kremlin Wall Necropolis on the Red Square after a five-day period of nationwide mourning.|$|E

40|$|Prepregnancy {{overweight}} or <b>obesity</b> <b>and</b> excessive gestational weight gain {{have been associated}} with increased risk of maternal and neonatal complications. Moreover, offspring from obese {{women are more likely to}} develop <b>obesity,</b> diabetes mellitus, <b>and</b> cardiovascular diseases in their lifetime. Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is one of the most common complications associated with <b>obesity</b> <b>and</b> appears to have a direct impact on the future metabolic health of the child. Fetal programming of metabolic function induced by <b>obesity</b> <b>and</b> GDM may have intergenerational effect and thus perpetuate the epidemic of cardiometabolic conditions.

40|$|Background: It is {{estimated}} that 20 % of all cancer cases are caused by obesity. Vitamin D {{is thought to be}} one of the mechanisms underlying this association. This review aims to summarise the evidence for the mediating effect of vitamin D on the link between <b>obesity</b> <b>and</b> cancer. Methods: Three literature searches using PubMed and Embase were conducted to assess whether vitamin D plays an important role in the pathway between <b>obesity</b> <b>and</b> cancer: (1) <b>obesity</b> <b>and</b> cancer; (2) <b>obesity</b> <b>and</b> vitamin D; and (3) vitamin D and cancer. A systematic review was performed for (1) and (3), whereas a meta-analysis including random effects analyses was performed for (2). Results: (1) 32 meta-analyses on <b>obesity</b> <b>and</b> cancer were identified; the majority reported a positive association between <b>obesity</b> <b>and</b> risk of cancer. (2) Our meta-analysis included 12 original studies showing a pooled relative risk of 1. 52 (95 % CI: 1. 33 - 1. 73) for risk of vitamin D deficiency ( 30 kg/m(2)). (3) 21 meta-analyses on circulating vitamin D levels and cancer risk were identified with different results for different types of cancer. Conclusion: There is consistent evidence for a link between <b>obesity</b> <b>and</b> cancer as well as <b>obesity</b> <b>and</b> low vitamin D. However, it seems like the significance of the mediating role of vitamin D in the biological pathways linking <b>obesity</b> <b>and</b> cancer is low.

5|$|In a dissenting opinion, a {{systematic}} review of four head-to-head comparative trials of metformin and clomifene found them equally effective for infertility. Four positive studies of metformin were in women not responding to clomifene, while {{the population in}} the negative studies was drug-naive or uncontrolled for the previous treatment. Metformin should be used as a second-line drug if clomifene treatment fails. Another review recommended metformin unreservedly as a first-line treatment option because it has positive effects not only on anovulation, but also on insulin resistance, hirsutism <b>and</b> <b>obesity</b> often associated with PCOS. A Cochrane Collaboration review found metformin improves ovulation and pregnancy rates, particularly when combined with clomifene, but is not associated with {{an increase in the number}} of live births.|$|E

5|$|The World Health Organization (WHO) {{predicts that}} {{overweight}} <b>and</b> <b>obesity</b> may soon replace more traditional public health concerns such as undernutrition {{and infectious diseases}} as the most significant cause of poor health. Obesity is a public health and policy problem because of its prevalence, costs, and health effects. The United States Preventive Services Task Force recommends screening for all adults followed by behavioral interventions in those who are obese. Public health efforts seek to understand and correct the environmental factors responsible for the increasing prevalence of obesity in the population. Solutions look at changing the factors that cause excess food energy consumption and inhibit physical activity. Efforts include federally reimbursed meal programs in schools, limiting direct junk food marketing to children, and decreasing access to sugar-sweetened beverages in schools. The World Health Organization recommends the taxing of sugary drinks.

Plantar fasciitis is a disorder of the insertion site of the ligament on the bone characterized by micro tears, breakdown of collagen, and scarring.
