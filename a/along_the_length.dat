5|$|The prehistoric {{breakup of}} the supercontinent Gondwana {{separated}} the Madagascar–Antarctica–India landmass from the Africa–South America landmass around 135million years ago. Madagascar later split from India about 88million years ago, allowing plants and animals on the island to evolve in relative isolation. <b>Along</b> <b>the</b> <b>length</b> of the eastern coast runs a narrow and steep escarpment containing much of the island's remaining tropical lowland forest.|$|E
5|$|Weh Island {{is located}} in the Andaman Sea, where two groups of islands, the Nicobar Islands and Andaman Islands, are {{scattered}} in one line from Sumatra to the north up to the Burma plate.

5|$|A {{medical report}} {{documented}} that wearing an underwire bra in the Tropics, specifically East Africa, {{can lead to}} severe furuncular myiasis of the breast caused by the Tumbu fly. The eggs and larvae from this fly are deposited in clothing, especially <b>along</b> <b>the</b> <b>length</b> of the metal wires of an underwire bra, and can only be killed by applying heat through ironing. It is almost impossible when ironing a traditional underwire bra to achieve the required heat to kill the larvae deposited along the underwire.|$|E

5|$|During the Japanese heyday in Middle Road, {{the area}} was synonymous with the Echigoya, a Japanese draper shop. The Echigoya sold high quality {{textiles}} to Japanese and non-Japanese customers alike. The textiles and clothing were stored in full-height timber cabinets that ran <b>along</b> <b>the</b> <b>length</b> of the ground level walls. On one length side, a raised platform was also constructed, known as Koagari, where customers would sit while they examine the merchandise.|$|E
5|$|In addition, a {{programme}} of modernising {{many of the}} Underground's busiest central London stations was started; {{providing them}} with escalators to replace lifts. New and refurbished rolling stock was gradually introduced {{on a number of}} lines with automatic sliding doors <b>along</b> <b>the</b> <b>length</b> of the carriages instead of manual end gates, reducing boarding times. By the middle of the 1920s, the organisation had expanded {{to such an extent that}} a large, new headquarters building designed by Charles Holden was constructed at 55 Broadway over St. James's Park station.|$|E
5|$|In the mandible, the {{diastema}} (gap) {{between the}} incisors and the cheekteeth (premolars and molars) is relatively deep. The mental foramen (an {{opening in the}} bone) is located relatively high and before the p4. The upper and lower masseteric ridges, which are located on the outer side of the jaw and anchor some of the chewing muscles, meet at the m1. The surfaces of the incisor are very flat, but there are small, irregular striations in the enamel <b>along</b> <b>the</b> <b>length</b> of the tooth.|$|E

5|$|It {{was during}} this period that the MTO {{undertook}} an engineering review of the entire route in search of cost inefficiencies. Highways 416 and 407 were constructed during a recession in the mid-1990s. Highway407 became a tolled highway {{and for a time}} it was mentioned in legislative debates that Highway416 would also be tolled, but ultimately this never happened. Instead, a hiatus in construction allowed engineers to evaluate inefficiencies in bridge and cross-section designs, as well as sensitive clay soils near Ottawa. This initiative led to a cost savings of over C$7 million and several of the unique design features located <b>along</b> <b>the</b> <b>length</b> of the freeway.|$|E
5|$|Outdoor {{activities}} including rugby, football, golf, shinty, fishing, riding, canoeing, athletics, and multi-sports {{are popular}} in the Western Isles. The Hebridean Challenge is an adventure race run in five daily stages, which takes place <b>along</b> <b>the</b> <b>length</b> of the islands and includes hill and road running, road and mountain biking, short sea swims and demanding sea kayaking sections. There are four main sports centres: Ionad Spors Leodhais in Stornoway, which has a 25 m swimming pool; Harris Sports Centre; Lionacleit Sports Centre on Benbecula; and Castlebay Sports Centre on Barra. The Western Isles {{is a member of}} the International Island Games Association.|$|E
5|$|SMS Prinz Heinrich {{was built}} at the Imperial Dockyard in Kiel. She was laid down in 1898 and {{completed}} in March 1902 {{at a cost of}} 16,588,000 Marks. Prinz Heinrichs design was a modification of Fürst Bismarck, and traded a smaller main battery for higher speed and more comprehensive armor protection. The ship set a precedent for subsequent German armored cruisers by concentrating her secondary armament amidships, as opposed to Fürst Bismarck, which spread the secondary armament <b>along</b> <b>the</b> <b>length</b> of the ship.|$|E

5|$|The French ironclad Invincible was {{the second}} of the three wooden-hulled s built for the French Navy in 1858–62. The ships of the Gloire class were {{classified}} as armoured frigates because they only had a single gun deck and their traditional disposition of guns arrayed <b>along</b> <b>the</b> <b>length</b> of the hull also meant that they were broadside ironclads. Invincible had an uneventful career and was deployed in North American waters during the Franco-Prussian War of 1870–71. The unseasoned timber of her hull rotted quickly and she was condemned in 1872 and scrapped in 1876.|$|E
5|$|The French ironclad Normandie was {{the third}} and last of the three wooden-hulled s built for the French Navy in 1858–62. The ships of the Gloire class were {{classified}} as armoured frigates because they only had a single gun deck and their traditional disposition of guns arrayed <b>along</b> <b>the</b> <b>length</b> of the hull also meant that they were broadside ironclads. Normandie was the first ironclad to cross the Atlantic {{in support of the}} French intervention in Mexico in 1862. Although the ship was active during the Franco-Prussian War of 1870–71, she saw no action. The unseasoned timber of her hull rotted quickly; she was condemned in 1871 and subsequently scrapped.|$|E

5|$|The {{reproductive}} system of females consist of paired ovaries, lateral oviducts, spermatheca, and a genital chamber. The lateral ducts are where the eggs leave the body, while the spermatheca is where sperm is stored. Unlike other insects, the gonopore, or genital opening {{is behind the}} seventh abdominal segment. The ovaries are primitive {{in that they are}} polytrophic (the nurse cells and oocytes alternate <b>along</b> <b>the</b> <b>length</b> of the ovariole). In some species these long ovarioles branch off the lateral duct, while in others, short ovarioles appear around the duct.|$|E
5|$|The sinew, {{soaked in}} animal glue, is then laid in layers {{on the back}} of the bow; the strands of sinew are {{oriented}} <b>along</b> <b>the</b> <b>length</b> of the bow. The sinew is normally obtained from the lower legs and back of wild deer or domestic ungulates. Traditionally, ox tendons are considered inferior to wild-game sinews since they have a higher fat content, leading to spoilage. Sinew will extend farther than wood, again allowing more energy storage.|$|E
