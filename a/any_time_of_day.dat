5|$|C.maenas is a predator, {{feeding on}} many organisms, {{particularly}} bivalve molluscs (such as clams, oysters, and mussels), polychaetes and small crustaceans. They are primarily nocturnal, although activity {{also depends on}} the tide, and crabs can be active at <b>any</b> <b>time</b> <b>of</b> <b>day.</b> In California, preferential predation of C.maenas on native clams (Nutricola spp.) resulted in {{the decline of the}} native clams and an increase of a previously introduced clam (the amethyst gem clam, Gemma gemma). C.maenas has been implicated in the destruction of the soft-shell clam (Mya arenaria) fisheries on the east coast of the United States and Canada, and the reduction of populations of other commercially important bivalves (such as scallops, Argopecten irradians, and northern quahogs, Mercenaria mercenaria). The prey of C.maenas includes the young of bivalves and fish, although the effect of its predation on winter flounder, Pseudopleuronectes americanus is minimal. C.maenas can, however, have substantial negative impacts on local commercial and recreational fisheries, by preying on the young of species, such as oysters and the Dungeness crab, or competing with them for resources.|$|E

In 2007, the Isle of Wight council reduced its reimbursement to Southern Vectis for free travelling passengers from 76 percent to 46 percent.

25|$|A 2010 {{review of}} {{published}} scientific research suggested that exercise generally improves sleep for most people, and helps sleep {{disorders such as}} insomnia. The optimum time to exercise may be 4 to 8 hours before bedtime, though exercise at <b>any</b> <b>time</b> <b>of</b> <b>day</b> is beneficial, {{with the exception of}} heavy exercise taken shortly before bedtime, which may disturb sleep. However, there is insufficient evidence to draw detailed conclusions about the relationship between exercise and sleep. Sleeping medications such as Ambien and Lunesta are an increasingly popular treatment for insomnia. Although these nonbenzodiazepine medications are generally believed to be better and safer than earlier generations of sedatives, they have still generated some controversy and discussion regarding side-effects. White noise appears to be a promising treatment for insomnia.|$|E
25|$|Verizon FiOS dropped The Weather Channel and {{its sister}} network Weatherscan from its lineup at 12:00a.m. Eastern Time on March 10, 2015 {{after the two}} parties were unable {{to come to terms}} on a new {{carriage}} agreement. The services have respectively been replaced by the AccuWeather Network (which launched on March 10) and a widget provided by FiOS featuring forecast content provided by WeatherBug. No public announcement was made regarding the removal until over 12 hours after TWC and Weatherscan were pulled. The Weather Channel offered a less expensive deal to Verizon FiOS, which rejected the offer. Verizon cited the wide availability of the internet and mobile apps for consumers to access weather content <b>any</b> <b>time</b> <b>of</b> <b>day</b> as the reason for dropping TWC and its services. It is unknown if Frontier FiOS customers in clusters formerly served by Verizon are affected, including (as of April 1, 2016) the recently acquired clusters from California, Texas, and Florida.|$|E

500|$|The male call can {{be heard}} at <b>any</b> <b>time</b> <b>of</b> <b>day</b> and {{consists}} of an unusual hissing-type sound, starting {{as a series of}} one-second sibilant bursts about a second apart repeated more rapidly until they become a constant hiss lasting 7–10s. Described as [...] "rp, rp, rp, rp, rrrrrp", the sound is produced when single muscular contractions click the tymbal inward, buckling 7–9 of the tymbal ribs, each of which produces a pulse. This occurs alternately on the two tymbals and is rapidly repeated at a frequency of about 143Hz (in groups of four except when the cicada is in distress– when they are ungrouped and at a lower frequency), giving a pulse repetition frequency of around 1050 per second, with a relatively broad sound frequency range of 7.5–10.5kHz, that has a dominant frequency (at which the peak energy is observed) of 9.5–9.6kHz.|$|E
500|$|Dengue {{virus is}} {{primarily}} transmitted by Aedes mosquitoes, particularly A. aegypti. These mosquitoes usually live between the latitudes of 35°North and 35°South below {{an elevation of}} [...] They typically bite during the early morning and in the evening, but they may bite and thus spread infection at <b>any</b> <b>time</b> <b>of</b> <b>day.</b> [...] Other Aedes species that transmit the disease include A. albopictus, A. polynesiensis and A. scutellaris. Humans are the primary host of the virus, but it also circulates in nonhuman primates. An infection can be acquired via a single bite. A female mosquito that takes a blood meal from a person infected with dengue fever, during the initial 2- to 10-day febrile period, becomes itself infected with the virus in the cells lining its gut. About 8–10 days later, the virus spreads to other tissues including the mosquito's salivary glands and is subsequently released into its saliva. The virus {{seems to have no}} detrimental effect on the mosquito, which remains infected for life. Aedes aegypti is particularly involved, as it prefers to lay its eggs in artificial water containers, to live in close proximity to humans, and to feed on people rather than other vertebrates.|$|E

2500|$|Cyberbullying is a {{communication}} phenomenon {{in which a}} bully utilizes electronic media in order to harass peers.

2500|$|Erections {{during sleep}} or when waking up are {{medically}} known as nocturnal penile tumescence and colloquially {{referred to as}} morning wood.

Erections can occur spontaneously at <b>any</b> <b>time</b> <b>of</b> <b>day,</b> and if clothed may cause a bulge or [...] "hump". This can be disguised or hidden by wearing close-fitting underwear, a long shirt and baggier clothes. Erections are common for male children and infants, and can even occur before birth. Spontaneous erections are also known as involuntary or unwanted erections and are normal. Such erections can be embarrassing if they happen in public, such as a classroom or living room.|$|E

6000|$|... (M108) “The {{war is a}} grievous affair,” Mr. Gladstone said to Brand, “and adds much to our cares, for to {{maintain}} our neutrality {{in such a case}} as this, will be a most arduous task. On the face of the facts France is wrong, but as to personal trustworthiness the two moving spirits on the respective sides, Napoleon and Bismarck, are nearly on a par.” His individual activity was unsparing. He held almost daily conferences with Lord Granville at the foreign office; criticised and minuted despatches; contributed freely to the drafts. “There has not, I think,” he wrote to Bright (Sept. 12), “been a single day on which Granville and I have not been in anxious communication {{on the subject of the}} war.” When Lord Granville went to Walmer he wrote to Mr. Gladstone, “I miss our discussions here over the despatches as they come in very much.” “I hope I need not say that while you are laid up with gout at Walmer,” Mr. Gladstone wrote in October, “I am most ready to start at a few hours’ notice at <b>any</b> <b>time</b> <b>of</b> <b>day</b> or night, to join you upon any matter which you may find to require it. Indeed I could not properly or with comfort remain here upon any other terms.” Details of this agitating time, with all its convulsions and readjustments, belong to the history of Europe. The part taken by Mr. Gladstone and his cabinet was for several months in pretty close harmony with the humour of the country. It will be enough for us to mark their action at decisive moments.|$|E
