Fuel {{performance}} can be increased in forced induction internal combustion engines by injecting alcohol into the air intake after the turbocharger or supercharger has pressurized the air.

25|$|The {{primary use}} of this valve is to {{maintain}} the spinning of the turbocharger at a high speed. The air is usually recycled back into the turbocharger inlet (diverter or bypass valves), but can also be vented to the atmosphere (blow off valve). Recycling back into the turbocharger inlet is required on an engine that uses a mass-airflow fuel injection system, because dumping the excessive air overboard downstream of the mass airflow sensor causes an excessively rich fuel mixtureâ€”because the mass-airflow sensor has already accounted for the extra air {{that is no longer}} being used. Valves that recycle the air also shorten the time needed to re-spool the turbocharger after sudden engine deceleration, since load on the turbocharger when the valve is active is much lower than if the <b>air</b> <b>charge</b> vents to atmosphere.|$|E

40|$|PURPOSE: We {{determined}} and compared urethral pressure measurements using <b>air</b> <b>charged</b> and microtip catheters in a prospective, single-blind, randomized trial. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A consecutive series of 64 women referred for urodynamic investigation underwent sequential urethral pressure measurements using an <b>air</b> <b>charged</b> and a microtip catheter in randomized order. Patients were blinded {{to the type}} and sequence of catheter used. Agreement between the 2 catheter systems was assessed using the Bland and Altman 95 % limits of agreement method. RESULTS: Intraclass correlation coefficients of <b>air</b> <b>charged</b> and microtip catheters for maximum urethral closure pressure at rest were 0. 97 and 0. 93, and for functional profile length they were 0. 9 and 0. 78, respectively. Pearson's correlation coefficients and Lin's concordance coefficients of <b>air</b> <b>charged</b> and microtip catheters were r = 0. 82 and rho = 0. 79 for maximum urethral closure pressure at rest, and r = 0. 73 and rho = 0. 7 for functional profile length, respectively. When applying the Bland and Altman method, <b>air</b> <b>charged</b> catheters gave higher readings than microtip catheters for maximum urethral closure pressure at rest (mean difference 7. 5 cm H(2) O) and functional profile length (mean difference 1. 8 mm). There were wide 95 % limits of agreement for differences in maximum urethral closure pressure at rest (- 24. 1 to 39 cm H(2) O) and functional profile length (- 7. 7 to 11. 3 mm). CONCLUSIONS: For urethral pressure measurement the <b>air</b> <b>charged</b> catheter {{is at least as}} reliable as the microtip catheter and it generally gives higher readings. However, <b>air</b> <b>charged</b> and microtip catheters cannot be used interchangeably for clinical purposes because of insufficient agreement. Hence, clinicians should be aware that <b>air</b> <b>charged</b> and microtip catheters may yield completely different results, and these differences should be acknowledged during clinical decision making...|$|R

50|$|Water {{injection}} {{is another}} {{effective means of}} cooling the charge air to prevent detonation. Methanol is mixed with the water to prevent freezing and {{to act as a}} slower-burning fuel. Water injection, unlike nitrous oxide or forced induction, doesn't add much power to the engine by itself, but allows more power to be safely added. It works by being sprayed into the compressed <b>air</b> <b>charge.</b> The water absorbs heat as it evaporates to cool the charge and lower combustion temperatures. The alcohol is also a fuel in the charge which burns slower and cooler than gasoline. Due to the lower intake temperatures and denser <b>air</b> <b>charge,</b> more boost pressure and timing advance can be safely added without using higher octane fuel. It is most often used in racing applications, however it was also shown to be practical for extended use.|$|E

40|$|Boosted IC engine development, both diesel and gasoline, {{is driving}} the need for better <b>charge</b> <b>air</b> {{temperature}} control. <b>Charge</b> <b>air</b> temperature directly and indirectly influences engine performance, fuel economy & emissions. To date <b>charge</b> <b>air</b> temperature control has, in the main, been passive; aiming only to reduce temperatures towards, but still above, ambient temperature. Driven by increasing specific output, the opportunities for sub-ambient charge cooling need to be investigated. For some real world driving conditions it is also desirable to raise the <b>charge</b> temperature. <b>Air</b> Cycle Technology ltd (ACT), working with the University of Huddersfield (UoH) are developing a controllable <b>charge</b> <b>air</b> cooling system, which will deliver <b>charge</b> <b>air</b> at sub-ambient temperature over a wide engine operating range.

50|$|In a {{naturally}} aspirated engine, air for combustion (diesel cycle in a diesel engine, or {{specific types of}} Otto cycle in gasoline engines - namely gasoline direct injection), or an air/fuel mixture (traditional Otto cycle petrol engines) is drawn into the engines cylinders by atmospheric pressure acting against a partial vacuum that occurs as the piston travels downwards toward bottom dead centre during the intake stroke. Owing to innate restriction in the engine's inlet tract which includes the intake manifold, a small pressure drop occurs as air is drawn in, resulting in a volumetric efficiency of less than 100 percent - and a less than complete <b>air</b> <b>charge</b> in the cylinder. The density of the <b>air</b> <b>charge,</b> and therefore the engine's maximum theoretical power output, {{in addition to being}} influenced by induction system restriction, is also affected by engine speed and atmospheric pressure, the latter which decreases as the operating altitude increases.|$|E
50|$|A {{decrease}} in intake <b>air</b> <b>charge</b> temperature sustains {{use of a}} more dense intake charge into the engine, {{as a result of}} forced induction. The lowering of the intake charge air temperature also eliminates the danger of pre-detonation (knock) of the fuel/air charge prior to timed spark ignition. This preserves the benefits of more fuel/air burn per engine cycle, increasing the output of the engine.|$|E
50|$|Intercoolers also {{eliminate}} the need for using the wasteful method of lowering intake charge temperature by the injection of excess fuel into the cylinders' air induction chambers, to cool the intake <b>air</b> <b>charge,</b> prior to its flowing into the cylinders. This wasteful practice (before intercoolers were used) nearly eliminated the gain in engine efficiency from forced induction, but was necessitated by the greater need to prevent at all costs the engine damage that pre-detonation engine knocking causes.|$|E

50|$|An {{intercooler}} is any {{mechanical device}} used to cool a fluid, including liquids or gases, between {{stages of a}} multi-stage compression process, typically a heat exchanger that removes waste heat in a gas compressor.

This sometimes requires a lower compression ratio be used, to allow a wider mapping of ignition timing advance before detonation occurs (for a given fuel's octane rating).

The valve operates to create three specific first-order resonant frequencies that increase cylinder <b>air</b> <b>charge.</b> All three resonances are used from 0 to 6250 rpm (6800 for the KL-ZE).
