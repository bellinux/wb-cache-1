25|$|Unregulated: In {{this type}} of {{programme}} the bicycles are simply released into a city or given area for use by anyone. In some cases, such as a university campus, the bicycles are only designated for use within certain boundaries. Users are expected to leave the bike unlocked in a public area once they reach their destination. Because the bike {{is not required to}} be returned to a centralised station, ready availability of such bicycles is rare, and since unlocked bikes may be taken by <b>another</b> <b>user</b> at any time, the original rider is forced to find alternative transport for the return trip. Bicycle sharing programs without locks, user identification, and security deposits have also historically suffered large loss rates from theft and vandalism.|$|E
25|$|On February 23, 2010, Facebook {{was granted}} a patent on certain aspects of its News Feed. The patent covers News Feeds in which links are {{provided}} so that one user can participate in the same activity of <b>another</b> <b>user.</b> The patent may encourage Facebook to pursue action against websites that violate its patent, which may potentially include websites such as Twitter. One {{of the most popular}} applications on Facebook is the Photos application, where users can upload albums and photos. Facebook allows users to upload an unlimited number of photos, compared with other image hosting services such as Photobucket and Flickr, which apply limits to the number of photos that a user is allowed to upload. During the first years, Facebook users were limited to 60photos per album. As of May 2009, this limit has been increased to 200photos per album.|$|E

Information found using WikiScanner showed 126 anonymous edits from the Department to articles on sometimes controversial issues and on government ministers. The Department responded by saying that Prime Minister John Howard did not direct his staff to modify the articles, and later that day {{the head of the}} Department said that the changes were not made by anyone in his department or the Prime Minister's office, but by <b>another</b> <b>user</b> with the same Internet Service Provider (ISP). Wikiscanner also identified Australian Department of Defence (DoD) employees as having made over 5,000 edits, prompting an unprecedented announcement from the DoD to block Defence staff from editing Wikipedia in case edits were interpreted as official comment.|$|E

Guaranteed prize pool contests have higher stakes, using tiered payouts based on finishing in different percentiles or positions {{of the field of}} contestants. Further variations of double-up games, including Triple-up, Quadruple-up, and Quintuple-up, may also be offered. [...] Leagues are smaller versions of GPP contests, with tiered payouts and a smaller number of contestants.|$|E

500|$|A [...] "MouseOver" [...] exploit {{occurred}} on September 21, 2010, when an XSS Worm became active on Twitter. When a user held the mouse cursor over blacked-out {{parts of a}} tweet, the worm within the script would automatically open links and re-post itself on the reader's account. The exploit was then re-used to post pop-up ads and links to pornographic sites. The origin of the worm is unclear, but Pearce H. Delphin (known on Twitter as @zzap) and a Scandinavian developer, Magnus Holm, both claim to have modified a related exploit found by <b>another</b> <b>user</b> (possibly Masato Kinugawa) who was using it to create coloured Tweets. Kinugawa, a Japanese developer, reported the XSS vulnerability to Twitter on August 14. Later, when he found it was exploitable again, he created the account 'RainbowTwtr' {{and used it to}} post coloured messages. Delphin says he exposed the security flaw by tweeting a JavaScript function for [...] "onMouseOver", and Holm later created and posted the XSS Worm that automatically re-tweeted itself. Security firm Sophos reported that the virus was spread by people doing it for [...] "fun and games", but noted it could be exploited by cybercriminals. Twitter issued a statement on their status blog at 13:50 UTC that [...] "The exploit is fully patched." [...] Twitter representative Carolyn Penner said no charges would be pressed.|$|E

2500|$|... sudo ( [...] or [...] ) is {{a program}} for Unix-like {{computer}} operating systems that allows users to run programs with the security privileges of <b>another</b> <b>user,</b> by default the superuser. It originally stood for [...] "superuser do" [...] as the older versions of sudo were designed to run commands only as the superuser.

2500|$|There are two {{mechanisms}} that Microsoft uses for locking: pessimistic locking, and optimistic locking. With pessimistic locking, the record or page is locked immediately when the lock is requested, while with optimistic locking, the locking is delayed until the edited record is saved. Conflicts {{are less likely}} to occur with optimistic locking, since the record is locked only {{for a short period of}} time. However, with optimistic locking one cannot be certain that the update will succeed because <b>another</b> <b>user</b> could lock the record first. With pessimistic locking, the update is guaranteed to succeed once the lock is obtained. Other users must wait until the lock is released in order to make their changes. [...] Lock conflicts, which either require the user to wait, or cause the request to fail (usually after a timeout) are more common with pessimistic locking.|$|E

[...] He has been considered as a possible commissioner of the jewel, in which case it would almost certainly have been made in Paris, and might have made its way to England after being presented. [...] This might also have been the case if it was commissioned by an English person, especially a royal one.
