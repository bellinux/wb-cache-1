The sorting process {{is by no means}} perfect.|$|E
5|$|All the {{received}} nominations <b>are</b> <b>sent</b> <b>to</b> SAI and National Anti-Doping Agency for the verification {{against the}} claimed achievements and doping clearance respectively.

5|$|At {{a prison}} in Dinwiddie County, Virginia, an inmate—also named Robert Torrance—receives a package {{containing}} a boil-covered piece of meat. He becomes infected and dies thirty-six hours later. Two other inmates, Paul and Steve, escape in a laundry cart after {{being sent to}} clean Torrance's cell. Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) <b>are</b> <b>sent</b> <b>to</b> help the U.S. Marshals find them.

Either party can, on specified terms, appeal the outcome of the case to the court of appeal and ultimately the Supreme Court of Norway.|$|E
5|$|Each sensory system {{begins with}} {{specialized}} receptor cells, such as light-receptive neurons in the retina of the eye, or vibration-sensitive neurons in the cochlea of the ear. The axons of sensory receptor cells travel into {{the spinal cord}} or brain, where they transmit their signals to a first-order sensory nucleus dedicated to one specific sensory modality. This primary sensory nucleus sends information to higher-order sensory areas that are dedicated to the same modality. Eventually, via a way-station in the thalamus, the signals <b>are</b> <b>sent</b> <b>to</b> the cerebral cortex, where they are processed to extract the relevant features, and integrated with signals coming from other sensory systems.|$|E
50|$|Since about 1999 Ford {{has had a}} {{more varied}} population, and some {{high-profile}} prisoners who <b>were</b> expected <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>sent</b> <b>to</b> Ford <b>were</b> instead incarcerated in other open prisons. Jonathan Aitken <b>was</b> <b>sent</b> <b>to</b> an Open Prison in Kent, and Jeffrey Archer <b>was</b> <b>sent</b> <b>to</b> North Sea Camp in Lincolnshire.|$|R

5|$|I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings is a 1969 {{autobiography}} {{about the}} early years of American writer and poet Maya Angelou. The first in a seven-volume series, it is a coming-of-age story that illustrates how strength of character and a love of literature can help overcome racism and trauma. The book begins when three-year-old Maya and her older brother <b>are</b> <b>sent</b> <b>to</b> Stamps, Arkansas, to live with their grandmother and ends when Maya becomes a mother at the age of 16. In the course of Caged Bird, Maya transforms from a victim of racism with an inferiority complex into a self-possessed, dignified young woman capable of responding to prejudice.|$|E

When Dales is told that Skur hanged himself while in custody, he feels guilty and returns to Skur's house to apologize to his wife. While there, he sees Skur alive and tries to recapture him. In the following struggle, an appendage emerges from Skur's mouth. Skur is forced to flee when a neighbor interrupts the fight. Dales' partner and Roy Cohn warn Dales to change his report about the attack. He does so, but feels guilty about it.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 1990s, {{recreational}} riding experienced a revival, and {{the consumption of}} horse meat continued to decrease. On March 11, 1994, the Trait du Nord was officially declared to be a workhorse again, and in 1996 another decree prohibited docking of tails in horses. Members of the breed are occasionally exported from France, with some going to Italy, Belgium and Germany, mainly for work in logging and pulling brewery wagons. A few <b>are</b> <b>sent</b> <b>to</b> Sicily and Guadeloupe, but this is quite rare.|$|E

5|$|Poor {{breeding}} may {{be encouraged}} {{by the fact that}} many horses <b>are</b> <b>sent</b> <b>to</b> the breeding shed following an injury. If the injury is linked to a conformational fault, the fault is likely to be passed to the next generation. Additionally, some breeders will have a veterinarian perform straightening procedures on a horse with crooked legs. This can help increase the horse's price at a sale and perhaps help the horse have a sounder racing career, but the genes for poor legs will still be passed on.|$|E

The case takes a twist when another poultry worker is shot after she goes insane, leading Mulder to believe that certain townspeople are cannibals.|$|E
5|$|Unlike early models, {{the current}} {{structures}} {{are made up}} of six sections attached together by zippers and Velcro to allow quick replacement if damaged by a plane. Prior to May 2008, the races had used more than eight tons of fabric for the various pylons, and the average life of each pylon was 15 races. Thirty-five pylons are transported to each race, and at each race's completion, the pylons <b>are</b> <b>sent</b> <b>to</b> Innsbruck, Austria to be repaired.|$|E
5|$|A varsity {{baseball}} team is an established part {{of physical education}} departments at most high schools and colleges in the United States. In 2008, {{nearly half a million}} high schoolers and over 35,000 collegians played on their schools' {{baseball team}}s. The number of Americans participating in baseball has declined since the late 1980s, falling well behind the number of soccer participants. By early in the 20th century, intercollegiate baseball was Japan's leading sport. Today, high school baseball in particular is immensely popular there. The final rounds of the two annual tournaments—the National High School Baseball Invitational Tournament in the spring, and the even more important National High School Baseball Championship in the summer—are broadcast around the country. The tournaments are known, respectively, as Spring Koshien and Summer Koshien after the 55,000-capacity stadium where they are played. In Cuba, baseball is a mandatory part of the state system of physical education, which begins at age six. Talented children as young as seven <b>are</b> <b>sent</b> <b>to</b> special district schools for more intensive training—the first step on a ladder whose acme is the national baseball team.|$|E

50|$|Email {{should be}} {{considered}} a type of private communication because it <b>is</b> <b>sent</b> <b>to</b> a specific email address, which is associated with a person.
