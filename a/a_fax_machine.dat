5|$|Kvitelach left at gravesites are {{traditionally}} burned. The gravesite {{of the sixth}} and seventh Lubavitcher Rebbes, Rabbi Yosef Yitzchak Schneersohn and Rabbi Menachem Mendel Schneerson, includes <b>a</b> <b>fax</b> <b>machine</b> which receives over 700 faxes a day, and a computer which receives 400 emails daily. These kvitelach are all printed and then taken to the graves, where they are torn into shreds and placed atop the graves. When the pile grows too high, the shredded notes are burned.|$|E
25|$|At {{the time}} of commissioning, the conference {{compartment}} was equipped with a large table, four freely movable chairs, an electronic typewriter, <b>a</b> <b>fax</b> <b>machine,</b> a telephone and power sockets. It could be used with a reservation {{of at least three}} seats. Originally, first-class tickets were necessary. If there were no reservations in the conference compartment, it could be used at the head conductor's discretion. In 1992, demand was high: the conference compartments were booked 8197 times. A year later, that number dropped to 4400. Before the refurbishment program, the train's only power sockets for passengers were located in the conference compartment.|$|E
25|$|The {{general layout}} of the House was largely {{untouched}} from the previous non-celebrity series. The living room and bedroom had no noticeable changes. There were several single beds in the same room, with one double bed, meaning that two housemates (Leo and Donny) had to share. The bathroom is much smaller than previous versions and the toilet and shower were no longer fitted with cameras. The dining room table was moved inside, and the kitchen fully equipped with modern conveniences. Outside the garden was a three-jet hot tub with a farmyard seating area. The bridge to Nowhere was still present, leading to a sitting area with heated seats and the topiary man. A workout area was situated just off the kitchen area. Inside the House there was also <b>a</b> <b>fax</b> <b>machine</b> built into the wall. On day 24 this was used to post viewers' questions to the housemates. Meanwhile, the Diary Room was identical to the previous summer's Big Brother, with an oversized gold chair and padded walls, the only change being the addition of yellow lights facing the walls.|$|E

Upon discovering her attempt at subversion, one of Luthor's henchmen attacks Lois, causing Jason's powers to emerge as he crushes the henchman with a piano [...] revealing that the (no longer asthmatic) Jason is Superman's son. Realizing this fact, Luthor and his thugs escape by helicopter as the earthquake effects from the growing landmass span back to Metropolis. While Superman works to contain the damage in the city, Richard reaches the yacht by way of floatplane and releases Lois and Jason from their locked room. The three become trapped when the yacht is split in two by the growing rock formations, knocking Lois unconscious and sinking the yacht. Superman rescues them and gets them {{to the safety of}} Richard's plane.|$|E
500|$|The third {{attempt to}} poison Litvinenko {{took place at}} around 5pm of 1 November in the Millennium Hotel in Grosvenor Square. The bus he {{travelled}} in to the hotel had no signs of radioactivity – but large amounts had been detected at the hotel. Polonium was subsequently found in a fourth-floor room and in a cup in the Pine Bar at the hotel. After the Millennium bar, Litvinenko stopped {{at the office of}} Boris Berezovsky. He used <b>a</b> <b>fax</b> <b>machine,</b> where radioactive contamination was found later. At 6pm, Akhmed Zakayev picked Litvinenko up and brought him home to Muswell Hill. The amount of radioactivity left by Litvinenko in the car was so significant that the car was rendered unusable. Everything that he touched at home during the next three days [...] was contaminated. His family was unable to return to the house even six months later. His wife tested positive for ingesting polonium, but did not leave a secondary trail behind her. This suggested that anyone who left a trail could not have picked up the polonium from Litvinenko (possibly, including Lugovoy and Kovtun). The patterns and levels of radioactivity the assassins left behind suggested that Litvinenko ingested polonium, whereas Lugovoy and Kovtun handled it directly. The human body dilutes polonium before excreting it in sweat, which results in a reduced radioactivity level. There were also traces of Po-210 found at the Hey Jo/Abracadabra bar, Dar Marrakesh restaurant, and Lambeth-Mercedes taxis.|$|E

2500|$|As {{a result}} of the accident, {{safeguarding}} against counterfeit aircraft parts skyrocketed. Peter Friedman, an expert on spare aircraft parts, stated in an episode of the television programme Mayday (Air Crash Investigation, Air Emergency) that the Partnair accident was the [...] "seminal event" [...] that required people around the world to recognize the proliferation of counterfeit aircraft parts in parts inventories. The spare aircraft parts industry had little regulation in many places in the world {{at the time of the}} Partnair accident. The United States Department of Transportation (USDOT), which oversees the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), decided to examine the scope of the spare parts in the United States. After auditing the FAA's inventory, the USDOT found that 39% of its parts were counterfeit. Those parts were traced back to some parts brokers that were prominent in making spare parts; however, up to 95% of the parts in those brokers' inventories were counterfeit. Mary Schiavo, the former inspector general of the USDOT, said that American parts brokers had [...] "no regulation whatsoever." [...] Schiavo stated that [...] "an individual with a telephone and <b>a</b> <b>fax</b> <b>machine</b> could become a parts broker" [...] and could get their parts from [...] "a variety of sources," [...] including junkyards, scrap facilities, older aircraft, aircraft involved in accidents, and illegal parts manufacturers. Counterfeit parts were often less expensive than authentic parts, which meant that airlines that were [...] "bottom-line driven" [...] (in poor financial shape) wanted to cut costs, driving them to acquire fakes.|$|E
2500|$|Lammy {{wakes up}} and realises she only has 15 minutes {{to get to her}} concert, she is blocked off by a fire. As the Chief Puddle {{attempts}} to get Lammy to help put out the fire since she's in a hurry, Lammy notices a billboard for a casino. Recalling Chop Chop's words, Lammy pictures her fire hose as a guitar and gains the confidence she usually has whilst playing. After putting out the fire, Lammy is rewarded with some pizza but eats so much that she is mistaken as a pregnant lady by Nurse Cathy Piller. Upon realizing she wasn't actually pregnant, Cathy forces Lammy to help put all the newborns to sleep using a baby as a guitar. As she leaves she slips on a skateboard and is launched in to a plane that was flying through the street. She then helps Captain Fussenpepper fly the plane while he is attacked by a ceiling panel, which makes him switch personalities. She ends up crash landing the plane into the middle of a full parking lot. Accidentally leaving her guitar on the plane upon leaving, Lammy goes to build a new one from scratch with the help from a beaver named Paul Chuck. By pretending her chainsaw is a guitar she is able to turn a tree in to a fully functional and painted guitar. Upon leaving with the new guitar, Lammy either slips on a banana peel and dies, where she's taken to the netherworld (Japan and PAL) or gets her belt snagged on [...] the shop door, propelling her backwards through time and onto a strange island (U.S). After being dragged into performing in a concert for idol Teriyaki Yoko, Lammy manages to earn the right to be brought back to Earth using <b>a</b> <b>fax</b> <b>machine,</b> but not before running into her evil twin Rammy, Yoko's original guitarist. After coming back from the dead, Lammy finally arrives at the concert {{at the same time as}} Katy and Ma-san, who had their own set of circumstances causing them to run late. With the band together, MilkCan go ahead and perform their concert before their adoring fans.|$|E

50|$|The law {{has often}} been {{illustrated}} using the example of <b>fax</b> machines: <b>a</b> single <b>fax</b> <b>machine</b> is useless, but the value of every <b>fax</b> <b>machine</b> increases with {{the total number of}} <b>fax</b> <b>machines</b> in the network, because the total number of people with whom each user may send and receive documents increases.
