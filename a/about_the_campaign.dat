5|$|In May 2010, the Barr {{campaign}} was sued by libertarian pundit Jim Bovard, {{who was hired}} to ghostwrite a book <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>campaign.</b> Bovard claims he was never paid the $47,000 he was to receive for his efforts. Campaign manager Russ Verney stated that the campaign hoped to raise {{enough money to pay}} Bovard, and asked for donations. The ensuing litigation resulted in a judgment entered for Bovard against the Bar 2008 Presidential Committee, Inc., in the full amount of $47,000.00.|$|E

25|$|The British {{historian}} Dominic Lieven {{wrote that}} much of the historiography <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>campaign</b> for various reasons distorts the story of the Russian war against France in 1812-14. The number of Western historians who are fluent in French and/or German vastly outnumbers those who are fluent in Russian, which has the effect that many Western historians simply ignore Russian language sources when writing <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>campaign</b> because they cannot read them.|$|E

25|$|The detectives {{visit the}} yacht club, where a valet (Grayson Gabriel) shares the guest sign-in log for October 5. Gwen's name is signed in at 8:37 p.m. with {{a license plate}} number that matches the {{campaign}} car in which Rosie's body was found. They question Gwen, who admits she recently lost her keycard but maintains she was at a Tacoma bed and breakfast {{on the night of}} Rosie's murder. Linden asks her <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>campaign</b> car, but she warns them to be careful with murder accusations. Later at Holder's apartment, Linden studies the grand opening photo and notices Jackson's former head of security had a broken arm. At the casino, the detectives tell Drays that Jackson framed her former head of security for murder and will eventually do the same to her. They demand to see all withheld casino security footage from the night of Rosie's murder.|$|E
25|$|Zeno, {{as member}} of the protectores domestici, did not {{take part in the}} {{disastrous}} expedition against the Vandals, led in 468 by Leo's brother-in-law Basiliscus. The following year, during which he held the honour of the consulate, he was appointed magister militum per Thracias and led an expedition in Thrace. The sources do not clearly state what enemy he fought there, and historians had proposed either Goths or Huns, or the rebels of Anagastes. Either way, before leaving, Leo and Zeno asked for Daniel the Stylite's opinion <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>campaign,</b> and Daniel answered that Zeno would have been the target of a conspiracy but would have escaped unharmed. What happened was that Leo sent some of his personal soldiers with Zeno to protect him, but they were bribed by Aspar to actually capture him. Zeno was informed of their intention and fled to Serdica, and because of this episode, Leo grew even more suspicious of Aspar.|$|E

500|$|A {{few days}} later, Thompson sent out an e-mail {{alerting}} {{the press about}} a conference call where he would make major announcement <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>campaign.</b> [...] Though some speculated that Thompson would {{drop out of the}} race during the call, he instead announced his intentions to participate in the Ames Straw Poll. [...] The move reaffirmed his strategy of relying on the straw poll to propel him from the lower tier, despite moves by the campaigns of Rudy Giuliani and John McCain to withdraw from the event. Drake University political science professor Dennis Goldford analyzed the straw poll strategy and commented that if Thompson [...] "didn't make some sort of substantive showing" [...] {{it would be hard for}} his money flow to continue.|$|E
500|$|After the announcement, Trump and Knauss {{had dinner}} with Ventura and were joined by actor Woody Harrelson. Ventura later commented that Trump's chances of success {{depended}} on his impression of the Reform Party. [...] Onlookers questioned Trump's motive in running. [...] Democratic pollster Harrison Hickman expressed doubts about the authenticity of Trump's campaign, saying [...] "It’s all marketing of his name." [...] Matt Bai of Newsweek commented [...] "Most serious-minded people think Trump's flirtation with the Reform Party's presidential nomination is just a publicity stunt." [...] Ex-wife Ivana Trump doubted he would actually run. [...] Former New York City Mayor Ed Koch commented that people would likely not flock to Trump's campaign, suggesting that Trump was merchandising his brand. Trump disagreed with the critics, arguing that even though his sales had increased {{as a result of}} media coverage, he was serious <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>campaign.</b> [...] Roger Stone was hired as director of the exploratory committee.|$|E
500|$|As {{the year}} 1900 began, Hanna hinted {{that he might}} not want to run McKinley's {{re-election}} campaign, stating that he was suffering from rheumatism. [...] In spite of his statement, the senator did want to run the campaign, but McKinley (who apparently saw an opportunity to show the public that he was not Hanna's creature) was slow to ask him. [...] This was a source of great stress to Hanna, who was concerned <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>campaign</b> and his relationship with McKinley; the senator fainted in his office during the wait and may have suffered a heart attack. [...] In late May, the President announced that Hanna would run his campaign. Margaret Leech suggested that McKinley was angry at Hanna for unknown reasons, thus the President's [...] "uncharacteristic coldness". [...] Morgan, on the other hand, wrote that [...] "the president was using his usual indirect pressure and the power of silence. [...] He wanted and needed Hanna, but on his own terms." ...|$|E

500|$|Parlophone's {{advertising}} campaign was unorthodox. The label took full-page advertisements in high-profile British newspapers and tube stations with lyrics for [...] "Fitter Happier" [...] pitched in large black letters against white backgrounds. The same lyrics, and artwork {{adapted from the}} album, were repurposed for shirt designs. Yorke said, [...] "We actively chose to pursue the 'Fitter Happier' thing" [...] to link what a critic called [...] "a coherent set of concerns" [...] between the album artwork and its promotional material. More unconventional merchandise included a floppy disk with Radiohead screensavers and an FM radio {{in the shape of}} a desktop computer. In America, Capitol sent 1,000 cassette players to prominent members of the press and music industry, each with a copy of the album permanently glued inside. When asked <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>campaign</b> after the album's release, Capitol president Gary Gersh said, [...] "Our job is just to take them as a left-of-center band and bring the center to them. That's our focus, and we won't let up until they're the biggest band in the world." ...|$|E
500|$|The early {{reports that}} General Howe sent to his {{superiors}} in London concerning the battles at Trenton and Princeton attempted to minimize their significance, blaming Rall for Trenton, {{and trying to}} recast Princeton as a nearly successful defense. [...] Not everyone was fooled by his accounts, in particular Lord Germain. [...] In {{a letter to the}} Hessian General Leopold Philip von Heister Germain wrote that [...] "the officer who commanded [...] and to whom this misfortune is to be attributed has lost his life by his rashness." [...] Heister in turn had to report the loss to his ruler, Frederick II, Landgrave of Hesse-Kassel, with the news that not only had an entire brigade been lost, but sixteen regimental colors and six cannon as well. [...] The news reportedly enraged Frederick, who broadly suggested that Heister return home (which he did, turning over command of the Hessian forces to Wilhelm von Knyphausen). [...] Frederick also ordered extensive inquiries into the events of 1776, that took place in New York from 1778 to 1782. [...] These inquiries created a unique archive of materials <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>campaign.</b>|$|E
500|$|Scott Lasley, a {{political}} science professor at Western Kentucky University and chairman of the Warren County Republican Party, criticized Bevin's appearance at the rally, saying, [...] "Either they were totally unvetted and unprepared for it, which says a lot <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>campaign</b> and its ability to compete at this level, or...they think that message is going to be receptive. Otherwise you don't go there." [...] On April 25, 2014, Bevin apologized for attending the event, saying [...] "I am genuinely sorry that my attendance at an event which, other than my comments, appears to have primarily involved a discussion of cockfighting, has created concern on the part of many Kentucky voters. I understand that concern. I am not and have never been a supporter of cockfighting or any other forms of animal cruelty." [...] The Daily Beast said the issue could be the [...] "nail in the coffin" [...] for Bevin's campaign, while The Washington Post wrote, [...] "On its own, the cockfighting story isn't enough to sink Bevin's campaign. But viewed in the context of the string of other distractions he's had to deal with, it reinforces the reality that his campaign is in serious need of repairs down the stretch." ...|$|E

500|$|Barr {{received}} some media exposure {{a few days}} after his nomination by visiting New York City to appear on both the Colbert Report and on Glenn Beck's Headline News program for an hour-long interview. The former appearance was part of the campaign's strategy to inform young voters and former Ron Paul supporters <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>campaign.</b> During the interview with Colbert, Barr was asked why he [...] "voted for the PATRIOT Act" [...] if he was such a [...] "big advocate of personal privacy." [...] He responded by saying that the Bush Administration [...] "went back on everything they told us [...] they would do with the PATRIOT Act." [...] In early June, the campaign dealt with the issue of racism when a white supremacist group posted a Barr endorsement on Stormfront.org, urging whites to vote for the [...] "best man" [...] rather than the [...] "liberal" [...] John McCain. The Barr campaign repudiated this endorsement. Campaign manager Russ Verney stated, [...] "We do not want and will not accept the support of haters. Tell the haters I said don't let the door hit you in the backside on the way out." [...] He emphasized that [...] "anyone with love in their heart for our country and for every resident of our country regardless of race, religion, nationality, or sexual orientation is welcome with open arms." ...|$|E
500|$|The band {{attracted}} {{media attention}} in March 2007 through the campaign [...] "Bum Rush the Charts", {{in which one}} of their songs was promoted through podcasting and blogging. The aim of this was to harness independent media and music to promote unsigned bands and {{to raise money for}} a scholarship fund. As a result of this effort, on March 22, 2007, the single [...] "Mine Again" [...] was purchased over 14,000 times in the United States. The iTunes charts represent a weekly average of purchases, not just “a snapshot of the previous 24 hours’ worth of sales,” as a spokesman for Apple reported in a Washington Post story <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>campaign.</b> “Mine Again,” however, still cracked the top 100 songs on the U.S. chart at No.99, and peaked at No.11 on the U.S. rock chart. The campaign had a significant international impact, selling songs in every country in which iTunes has stores and pushing [...] "Mine Again" [...] to No.53 on the Canadian chart (#10 rock), No.15 in the Netherlands (#2 rock), and No.73 in Germany (#12 rock), among others. The song broached the iTunes rock charts in eleven additional countries as well. Songs from the album also became popular on the PMC Top10 podcast, with three of them reaching the site's year-end Top 10: [...] "Mine Again" [...] (#8), [...] "Broken Heart" [...] (#6), and [...] "Hole in My Heart" [...] (#5).|$|E
