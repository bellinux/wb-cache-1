Nevertheless, the cross was regarded as Christ's emblem, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>so</b> used by the Crusaders. Sometimes the arms of Christ feature a Paschal lamb as the principal charge. By the 13th century, however, numerous indulgences had brought increased veneration for the instruments of the Passion. These instruments were described in heraldic terms and treated as personal to Christ much as a coat of arms (Dennys, 96). An early example in a seal from c. 1240 includes the Cross, nails, lance, crown of thorns, sponge and whips.|$|E

25|$|One such {{story is}} that of Rabbi Joshua ben Levi. The rabbi, a friend of Elijah’s, was asked what favor he might wish. The rabbi {{answered}} only that {{he be able to}} join Elijah in his wanderings. Elijah granted his wish only if he refrained from asking any questions about any of the prophet’s actions. He agreed and they began their journey. The first place they came to was the house of an elderly couple who were so poor they had only one old cow. The old couple gave of their hospitality as best they could. The next morning, as the travelers left, Elijah prayed that the old cow would die and it did. The second place they came to was the home of a wealthy man. He had no patience for his visitors and chased them away with the admonition that they should get jobs and not beg from honest people. As they were leaving, they passed the man’s wall {{and saw that it was}} crumbling. Elijah prayed that the wall be repaired <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>so.</b> Next, they came to a wealthy synagogue. They were allowed to spend the night with only the smallest of provisions. When they left, Elijah prayed that every member of the synagogue might become a leader.|$|E
25|$|Wanyan Heda's army {{still had}} more than 100,000 men after the battle at Mount Yu, and the Mongols adopted a {{strategy}} of exhausting the enemy. The Jin troops had little rest {{all the way from}} Dengzhou, and had not eaten for three days because of the severing of their supply lines. Their morale was plummeting and their commanders were losing confidence. When they reached Three-peaked Hill, a snowstorm suddenly broke out, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>so</b> cold that the faces of the Jin troops went as white as corpses, and they could hardly march. Rather than attack them when they were desperate with their backs to the wall, the Mongols left them an escape route and then ambushed them when they let down their guard during the retreat. The Jin army collapsed without a fight, and the Mongols pursued the fleeing Jin troops relentlessly. Wanyan Heda was killed, and most of his commanders also lost their lives. After the Battle of Three-peaked Hill, Kaifeng was doomed and Emperor Aizong soon abandoned the city and entered Hebei Province in a vain attempt to reestablish himself there. Thousands of people offered a stubborn resistance to the Mongols, who entrusted the conduct of the attack to Subutai, the most daring of all their commanders. Emperor Aizong was driven south again, and by this time Kaifeng had been taken by the Mongols so he established his new capital at Caizhou (present-day Runan County, Henan Province). Subutai wished to massacre the whole of the population. But fortunately for the Khitans, Yelü Chucai was more humane, and under his advice Ögedei Khan rejected the cruel proposal.|$|E

500|$|The {{doctrine}} {{was widely}} seen as unfair, for various reasons - it made no exception for cases where the parties to a contract obviously intended {{for it to be}} enforced by a third party, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>so</b> inconsistently applied that it provided no solid rule and was therefore [...] "bad" [...] law. The doctrine attracted criticism from figures such as Lord Scarman, Lord Denning, Lord Reid and Arthur Linton Corbin, and as early as 1937 the Law Revision Committee recommended that it should be significantly altered. With the passing of the Contracts (Rights of Third Parties) Act 1999 on 11 November 1999 the doctrine was significantly altered, and it now allows a third party to enforce the terms of a contract if the third party is specifically authorised to do so by the contract or if the contractual terms [...] "purport to confer a benefit" [...] on such third party.|$|E
500|$|The final scene, {{featuring}} Burt's face superimposed {{onto the}} cityscape, {{was created by}} special effects supervisor Mat Beck.

Later, Burton's name was attached to the role. During an appearance on The Talk the following January, Burton officially confirmed that he was cast as Dylan. The episode of The Talk was described as [...] "phenomenal"; Burton had no idea it would have been [...] "New Year's Eve kinda crazy." [...] After one of the show's co-hosts Julie Chen made the announcement of his casting and welcomed Burton to the CBS family, confetti dropped while another co-host Sheryl Underwood did a [...] "wild happy dance".

500|$|Many {{instances}} in the episode were character-driven. The {{action of the}} Angel to torture Amy [...] "for fun" [...] was met with anger from the Doctor but also gave him courage to defeat the Angels and save Amy. Moffat stated that in the scene in which the Doctor must {{figure out how to}} save Amy {{in a matter of seconds}} he was [...] "very basic...very pure, simple Doctor" [...] and did not have time to comfort Amy because his compassion would get in the way of his thinking process. River was also meant to understand this and explain to Amy that he needed to think. Moffat believed that Amy was [...] "passionate and a fighter and...also really smart" [...] which he showcased in the scene where Amy could not open her eyes for more than a second but was determined to do it for less than one. Moffat also believed that Amy's decision to attempt to seduce the Doctor was consistent with the character he had built up from her first episode. It was also a reflection of how the two had just escaped from death and shared a hard time together, and Amy's tendency to do things [...] "in the heat of the moment", although Moffat later admitted he regretted the way he wrote the scene, saying [...] "I played it for laughs, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>so</b> wrong". The Doctor's reaction was intended to be a reflection of how he often acted embarrassed and flustered when women behaved that way.|$|E
500|$|Following the album's low-budget release, Shields boasted, [...] "We {{know more}} about how the record {{industry}} works than our record company half the time. We do. I'm not joking." [...] That winter the band toured Europe, an event music critic David Cavanagh described as a [...] "unique chapter in live music". To recreate the higher tones from Loveless, Shields employed American flautist Anna Quimby. According {{to a friend of}} the band, [...] "She had a little skirt on, black tights...she was a little indie girl. But when she blew into the flute, it was like fucking Woodstock". NME editor Danny Kelly attended a show he described as [...] "more like torture than entertainment, I had a half pint of lager; they hit their first note <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>so</b> loud that it sent the glass hurtling". A US spring tour followed, during which Shields and Butcher tested their audiences' ability to sustain noise played at high volumes. Critic Mark Kemp said of the American tour, [...] "After about thirty seconds the adrenaline set in, people are screaming and shaking their fists. After a minute you wonder what's going on. After another minute it's total confusion. The noise starts hurting. The noise continues. After three minutes you begin to take deep breaths. After four minutes, a calm takes over." [...] The tour saw My Bloody Valentine accused of criminal negligence by the music press, who took exception to the long period of extreme noise played during [...] "You Made Me Realise", referring to it as [...] "the holocaust". In December 2000 Mojo magazine rated the tour as the second loudest in history.|$|E

500|$|It was {{recorded}} {{that during the}} Yuan dynasty, envoys were sent to Long Ya Men in 1320 to obtain tame elephants. The people of Long Ya Men then returned in 1325 with a tribute and trade mission to China. In around 1330, the traveller Wang Dayuan {{was said to have}} sailed through this passageway. In his travelogue Daoyi Zhilüe, he recorded that Long Ya Men was the two hills of Temasek between which a strait runs, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>so</b> called because the two hills looked like [...] "Dragon's teeth". Wang described the people of Long Ya Men as being prone to acts of piracy, and that while the natives traded with Chinese from Quanzhou, Chinese junks on their way back from the Western Oceans (西洋) may be met by pirates there who attacked with two to three hundred perahus (boats). He mentioned that in olden times a chief there found a jewelled head-dress while digging in the ground, and that [...] "the beginning of the year is calculated from the [...] rising of the moon, when the chief put on this head-gear and wore his [...] dress". [...] He also said the natives would [...] "gather their hair into a chignon, and wear short cotton bajus girded about with black cotton sarongs". The description of the people may be the first known record of the Orang Laut who inhabited the region. A different settlement called Ban Zu (班卒), described as being located on a hill behind Long Ya Men, is thought to be a transcription of the Malay Pancur and may be today's Fort Canning Hill.|$|E
500|$|Chandler and the Experience {{found time}} to record between {{performances}} in Europe. They began on October 23, recording [...] "Hey Joe" [...] at De Lane Lea Studios, with Chandler as producer and Dave Siddle as engineer. The song featured backing vocals by the Breakaways. Soon after the session began, Chandler asked Hendrix to turn his guitar amplifier down, and an argument ensued. Chandler commented: [...] "Jimi threw a tantrum because I wouldn't let him play guitar loud enough... He was playing a Marshall twin stack, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>so</b> loud in the studio that we were picking up various rattles and noises." [...] According to Chandler, Hendrix then threatened to leave England, stating: [...] "If I can't play as loud as I want, I {{might as well go}} back to New York." [...] Chandler, who had Hendrix's immigration papers and passport in his back pocket, laid the documents on the mixing console and told Hendrix to [...] "piss off". Hendrix laughed and said: [...] "All right, you called my bluff", and they got back to work. Redding wrote in his diary that they completed two songs during the October 23 session, but the second one has never been positively identified. Author Sean Egan speculated that it might have been Howlin' Wolf's [...] "Killing Floor" [...] or Wilson Pickett's [...] "Land of a Thousand Dances". Chandler decided that they should use an Experience original for the B-side of the single, so he encouraged Hendrix to start writing; he composed his first Experience song, [...] "Stone Free", the following day. Chandler, in an effort to minimize studio expenses, purchased rehearsal time at the Aberbach House in London. He abandoned this practice after realizing how quickly the group could learn songs while warming up in the studio. On November 2, 1966, the Experience returned to De Lane Lea to continue work on their first single. During the session, they recorded [...] "Stone Free" [...] and a demo version of [...] "Can You See Me". This marked {{the first time that the}} Experience recorded a song that was eventually included on the original UK release of the album.|$|E
