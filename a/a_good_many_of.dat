25|$|At {{the start}} of the war, the Tyrolese people rose in revolt. Under leaders such as Andreas Hofer they started attacking the Bavarian garrisons. Hoping to aid the rebellion, Austrian {{commander-in-chief}} Archduke Charles, Duke of Teschen ordered John to detach Chasteler and 10,000 Austrian troops to assist the Tyrolese. Chasteler's replacement as the commander of the shrunken VIII Armeekorps was Albert Gyulai, Ignaz Gyulai's brother. Suspecting that Austria planned to initiate a war, Napoleon built up the French part of the Army of Italy to six infantry and three cavalry divisions. Actually, <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> the so-called French soldiers were Italians, because Napoleon had annexed parts of northwest Italy to the First French Empire. In addition, Eugène assembled three Italian infantry divisions so that the Franco-Italian army numbered 70,000 troops. However, the army was dispersed across northern Italy.|$|E

Portions of his boxing portfolio, The Brutal Aesthetic , {{were published in the}} book On Boxing (Doubleday, 1987) with the text written by Joyce Carol Oates. Ranard went on to photograph squatters and the homeless in New York City, and spent lengthy periods in Russia photographing perestroika and the poignant problem of HIV/AIDS in Russia. He gained access to Russian prisons and photographed the grim life of Russian prisoners. <b>A</b> <b>good</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> his Russian photographs appeared in Forty Pounds of Salt (Fly by Night Press, 1995), Full Life and The Fire Within (the last two published by Medecins Sans Frontieres (Holland) & AIDS Foundation East-West, 2001). Ranard was closely connected with Louisville, Kentucky throughout his career. In his portfolio On Every Corner he photographed the inside world of the black communities' store-front churches. The churches were faced with the problem of violence by black teenagers.|$|E

2500|$|A {{pervasive}} theme, {{according to}} Publishers Weekly, is the discomfort responders felt in professing unproven beliefs, which Publishers Weekly declared [...] "an interesting {{reflection of the}} state of science". The question inspired implicit or explicit reflection in a number of responders about the scientific method's reliance on observable, empirical and measurable evidence, with <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> what The Observer points out as largely American responders defending against [...] "a return to an age of uncertainty in which creationism and intelligent design hold sway in the public mind". [...] "What's really at stake here", Wired said in its review, [...] "is the nature of 'proof' itself".|$|E
2500|$|<b>A</b> <b>good</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> {{the jokes}} are puns {{based on the}} fact that a {{widespread}} Chinese syllable (written as [...] "hui" [...] in pinyin) looks very similar to the obscene Russian word for penis. For this reason, since about 1956 the Russian-Chinese dictionaries render the Russian transcription of this syllable as [...] "хуэй" [...] (huey) (which actually is closer to the correct Chinese pronunciation). [...] The most embarrassing case for the Chinese-Soviet friendship probably is the word [...] "socialism" [...] (社会主义; pinyin: shè huì zhǔ yì), rendered previously as шэ-хуй-чжу-и. The following humorous possibilities for the misunderstanding of the Chinese syllable [...] "Hui" [...] are derived from Aarons's (2012) text: ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{first volume}} covered [...] "the Hieroglyphic and Primitive Linear Classes" [...] in three parts: the [...] "pre-Phoenician Scripts of Crete", the [...] "Pictorial Script" [...] and [...] "the Phaistos Disk". One {{or two more}} volumes {{publishing}} the Linear A and Linear B tablets were planned, but Evans ran out of time; the project required more than one man could bring to it. For <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> the years left to him, he was deeply enmeshed in war and politics in the Balkans. When he did return to Knossos, completion and publication of the palace excavations took priority. His greatest work, Palace of Minos, came out in 1935. It did include scattered descriptions of tablets. He died in 1941, soon after Nazi forces invaded Crete.|$|E
2500|$|The visa {{program was}} {{suspended}} on September 3, 1940, and officially ended on November 20, 1941. The Spanish and Portuguese governments had already refused to issue travel visas for those using the immigration visas to Brazil. [...] Innitzer updated the Vatican {{again on the}} increased pace of the deportations on May 20, 1942, and the Vatican tried {{for the last time}} to appeal to the Brazilians in July 1942. Maglione wrote in December 1941 to the bishop whose request had initiated the project that: [...] "as you have certainly been informed [...] many emigrants have departed andI regret to sayfrom what I have been told, <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> them, both by their improper conduct and alleged demands, have not corresponded to the concern which the Holy See has shown in their behalf". The emphasis of Maglione's letter was not on the failure of a diplomatic effort, but chagrin at the alleged conduct and lack of gratitude of the recipients of the visas. According to the Encyclopedia of the Holocaust, by [...] "improper conduct", Maglione could only have meant that the recipients continued to practice Judaism.|$|E
2500|$|Seger {{released}} the acclaimed The Distance {{in the final}} days of 1982. During the recording of this album, Silver Bullet guitarist Drew Abbott left the band due to his frustration with Seger's frequent use of session musicians in the studio, and was replaced by Dawayne Bailey. After the album's release, David Teegarden also left the band due to internal conflict, and was replaced by ex-Grand Funk drummer Don Brewer. Critically praised for representing a more versatile sound than that of his recent material, The Distance spawned numerous hits beginning with Rodney Crowell's [...] "Shame on the Moon". It was the biggest hit of the Silver Bullet Band's entire career, hitting #1 on the Adult Contemporary chart and holding at #2 for four consecutive weeks – behind Patti Austin and James Ingram's [...] "Baby, Come to Me" [...] and Michael Jackson's [...] "Billie Jean" [...] – on the Hot 100. It also crossed over to #15 on Billboards Country Singles chart. The follow-up single, [...] "Even Now", just missed the Top 10 and [...] "Roll Me Away" [...] peaked at #27. The driving album track [...] "Making Thunderbirds" [...] was a popular music video filmed in Detroit and well-received on MTV. Seger's multi-platinum sales dropped off at this point, with The Distance peaking at #5 and selling only 1.9 million copies in the United States. (This album was belatedly released on 8 track tape; Capitol reportedly had no plans to do so, but Seger, guessing that <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> his fans still had 8 track players in their vehicles, prevailed upon the label to release the album in that discontinued format as well.) ...|$|E
