40|$|International audienceEffective {{acoustic}} {{communication in the}} face of intense conspecific background noise constitutes a constant sensory challenge in chorusing and colonial species. An evolutionary approach suggests that behavioural and environmental constraints in these species should have shaped signal design and signalling behaviour to enable communication in noisy conditions. This could be attained both through the use of multicomponent signals and through short-term adjustments in the spatial separation of calling males. We investigated these two hypotheses in a chorusing anuran, the hylid Hyla arborea, through a series of phonotaxis experiments conducted within a six-speaker arena in a high background noise situation, by presenting females with male calls containing either single or multiple <b>attractive</b> <b>call</b> components, and by modifying distances between speakers. We found that female ability to discriminate <b>attractive</b> <b>calls</b> increased when several <b>attractive</b> <b>call</b> components were available, providing novel evidence that the use of multicomponent signals enhances communication in complex acoustic conditions. Signal discrimination in females also improved with speaker separation, demonstrating that within natural choruses, spatial unmasking conditioned by male density and spatial separation probably improves female discrimination of competing males. Implications of these results for the accuracy of mate choice within choruses are discussed...|$|R

Given the <b>call</b> <b>prices,</b> arbitrage-free digital prices at the same strikes can only move within upper and lower boundaries given by left and right call spreads. As the number of <b>call</b> <b>prices</b> increases, these bounds become tighter, and we give two examples where the densities converge to the Buchen-Kelly density in the sense of relative entropy when we use centered call spreads as proxies for digital prices. As pointed out by Breeden and Litzenberger, in the limit a continuous set of <b>call</b> <b>prices</b> completely determines the density. ...|$|R

40|$|International audienceIt is {{well known}} that in models with time-homogeneous local {{volatility}} functions and constant interest and dividend rates, the European Put prices are transformed into European <b>Call</b> <b>prices</b> by the simultaneous exchanges of the interest and dividend rates and of the strike and spot price of the underlying. This paper investigates such a Call Put duality for perpetual American options. It turns out that the perpetual American Put price is equal to the perpetual American <b>Call</b> <b>price</b> in a model where, in addition to the previous exchanges between the spot price and the strike and between the interest and dividend rates, the local volatility function is modified. We prove that equality of the dual volatility functions only holds in the standard Black-Scholes model with constant volatility. Thanks to these duality results, we design a theoretical calibration procedure of the local volatility function from the perpetual <b>Call</b> and Put <b>prices</b> for a fixed spot price x_ 0. The knowledge of the Put (resp. <b>Call)</b> <b>prices</b> for all strikes enables to recover the local volatility function on the interval (0,x_ 0) (resp. (x_ 0,+∞)) ...|$|R

40|$|In the {{beginning}} of fixed network liberalisation in Europe in the late 1990 s, the main concern of regulators was to lower <b>calls</b> <b>prices.</b> This was done by introducing wholesale regulation and promoting service based competition. Some years later, the concern of some regulators turned from too high <b>calls</b> <b>prices</b> to too low <b>calls</b> <b>prices</b> which might ‘squeeze’ entrants {{out of the market}}. We look at a simple model in which this development is explained by increasing competitive pressure from an ‘outside opportunity’, e. g. mobile telephony. We conclude that a margin squeeze is not necessarily used by the incumbent as a device to drive competitors out of the market and increase market power but can also result from increased inter-model competition. If this is the case, we argue that regulators should consider alternatives to cost oriented access prices such as retail minus or complete deregulation. access regulation, vertical integration, foreclosure, price squeeze, telecommunications, fixed networks...|$|R

A significant trouble with introducing this system in telecommunications pricing is the possibility that the receiving party may refuse to receive a call if the charge he has to bear is very high. We find the condition for no calls to be refused and show that the profit maximizing prices charged to the calling party and the receiving party must satisfy this condition. We demonstrate that the <b>calling</b> <b>price</b> under RPP must be lower than the price under the caller pays principle (CPP), that the profit of a firm will be increased under RPP, but that the consumer surplus will not necessarily be increased under RPP despite the lowered <b>calling</b> <b>price.</b> Also, we show that, if the demand function is linear, the reciprocal interconnection charge under RPP is higher than under CPP. ...|$|R
