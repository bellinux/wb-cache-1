40|$|Purpose: This study {{examined}} {{federal and state}} civil money penalties <b>and</b> <b>fines</b> collected from nursing homes and how states used the collected funds. De-sign and Methods: We used a telephone survey of state officials, Freedom of Information Act requests, state Web site searches, and stakeholder interviews to describe the funds collected, the availability {{and the use of}} funds, public information about penalties <b>and</b> <b>fines,</b> <b>and</b> the state allocation process and policies. Results: In 2004, 43 states collected a total of $ 21 million from more than 3, 000 federal and state penalties <b>and</b> <b>fines.</b> Forty-two states had $ 60. 5 million in fund accounts from penalties <b>and</b> <b>fines</b> available in 2005, and 32 states spent $ 28 million {{on a wide range of}} projects. Fifteen states spent $ 17. 9 million on survey and certification activities, 19 states spent $ 5. 6 million on provider projects, 6 states spent $ 1. 3 million on advocacy projects, and 12 states spent $ 2. 7 million for other projects. Most states did not provide information to the public about issuing penalties <b>and</b> <b>fines,</b> have formal procedures to inform stakeholders and allocate funds, or involve stakeholder groups in the decision-making pro-cess. Implications: Funds from federal and state penalties <b>and</b> <b>fines</b> vary widely across states. These funds are a resource for improving the quality of nursing home care that needs more attention from policy makers and stakeholder groups.

30|$|Law {{enforcement}} {{is among the}} key elements of a civil society that ensures the achievement of a higher social welfare. Since Becker (1968) has introduced an economic analysis of law enforcement, {{there has been a}} vast literature on economics of crime and punishment. 1 In public enforcement of law models, the state determines the level of enforcement expenditures, hence the probability of detecting violators, <b>and</b> <b>fines</b> for harmful acts. Then, the law enforcement monitors the activities of agents, detects <b>and</b> <b>fines</b> the violators. As the enforcement expenditures increase, the likelihood of violators being detected <b>and</b> <b>fined</b> increases.|$|R

5|$|Although both colour morphs {{occur in}} much of the European range, brown birds predominate in the more humid climate of western Europe, with the grey phase {{becoming}} more common further east; in the northernmost regions, all the owls are a cold-grey colour.

The Siberian and Scandinavian subspecies are 12% larger and 40% heavier, and have 13% longer wings than western European birds, in accordance with Bergmann's rule which predicts that northern forms will typically be bigger than their southern counterparts.|$|E
