The scheme enables us to derive closed-form approximation formulas for pricing currency options even with high flexibility of the underlying model; we do not model a foreign exchange rate’s variance such as in Heston [27], but its volatility that follows a general time-inhomogeneous Markovian process. Further, the correlations among all the factors such as domestic and foreign interest rates, a spot foreign exchange rate and its volatility, are allowed. At {{the end of this}} chapter some numerical examples are provided and the pricing formula is applied to the calibration of volatility surfaces in the JPY/USD option market...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{explores the}} {{relationship}} between labour values, prices of production and changes in income distribution in an actual economy. For this purpose we use a linear model of production with circulating capital and homogeneous labour, assuming that wages are paid ex ante. On {{the basis of this}} model and data from input-output tables of the Greek economy for the period 1988 - 1997 we estimate the labour values and prices of production, which are normalized {{with the use of the}} Sraffian standard commodity and the actual output vector. Furthermore, we extend Steedman's polynomial <b>approximation</b> <b>of</b> <b>prices</b> of production to include the case where wages are paid ex ante and the accuracy of this approximation is tested with actual input-output data. Finally, we find that prices of production change as a result of hypothetical changes in income distribution more often than not in a monotonic way and in a few cases display curvatures that reverse the order between prices of production and values.

40|$|A situation, {{in which}} two firms compete, is in the {{economic}} theory described by duopoly models. Market equilibrium on the duopoly market is formed in a reciprocal adjustment process of market prices and materialized market opportunities. The goal of the analysis {{is to find out}} whether the agricultural products market is significantly influenced by appearance of duopolies, what form they have and if they can fundamentally influence the price level of food. That food chain stores endeavour to mutually adapt food product prices is generally known; it is set especially by the inelastic demand for the mentioned goods on the side of consumers, i. e., by the need to demand basic food. Duopoly reactions to price competition in food chain stores are particularly strong in the case of commodities of milk and tomatoes, where the reactions and <b>approximation</b> <b>of</b> <b>prices</b> can be clearly seen. Based on statistical research {{it is obvious that the}} reactions are most reflected on sales of the food chain stores Billa and Albert. To identify specific reactions of price duopoly at retail chains the ANOVA statistical method was used. The firm’s duopoly behaviour as such on the food market need not be a subject for applying punishment from the antimonopoly bureau, if it does not have the cartel agreement character. An example can be the identical potato prices inquiry in the supermarkets of food chain stores...|$|E

A truthful mechanism can be easily obtained in this context (if we, of course, assume that the tasks cannot shrink their lengths) by scheduling the tasks following the increasing order of their lengths. The quality of a mechanism is measured by its <b>approximation</b> factor (<b>price</b> <b>of</b> anarchy, in a distributed system) w. r. t. the social optimum.

The central question in this paper is the following: "Are there other truthful mechanisms with better <b>approximation</b> guarantee (<b>price</b> <b>of</b> anarchy) for the considered scheduling problem?" This question has been raised by Christodoulou et al in the context of coordination mechanisms, but it is also relevant in centrally controlled systems. We present (randomized) truthful mechanisms for both the centralized and the distributed settings that improve the (expected) <b>approximation</b> guarantee (<b>price</b> <b>of</b> anarchy) of the SPT mechanism.

The main features of our method are twofold: firstly, it does not rely on any additional hypothesis on the regularity of the payoff function, and secondly, it allows an effective and straightfor-ward calibration procedure of the model to implied volatilities. These features were not achieved in previous works. Moreover, the central argument of our method could be applied to interest rate derivatives and compound derivatives. The only pre-requisite of our approach is the first-order <b>approximation</b> <b>of</b> the underlying derivative. Fur-thermore, the model proposed here is well-suited for commodities since it incorporates mean reversion <b>of</b> the spot <b>price</b> and multiscale stochastic volatility.
