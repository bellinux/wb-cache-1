A total of 3053 students from 21 primary and secondary schools in Baoxing County were administered the Patient Health Questionnaire- 13 (PHQ- 13), a short version of PHQ- 15 without the two items about sexuality and menstruation, the Children's Revised Impact of Event Scale (CRIES), and the self-made Earthquake-Related Experience Questionnaire 3 months after the Lushan earthquake. <b>Among</b> <b>child</b> and adolescent survivors, the prevalence rates of all somatic symptoms {{were higher in the}} probable PTSD group compared with the controls. The most frequent somatic symptoms were trouble sleeping (83. 2 %), feeling tired or having low energy (74. 4 %), stomach pain (63. 2 %), dizziness (58. 1 %), and headache (57. 7 %) in the probable PTSD group. Older age, having lost family members, having witnessed someone get seriously injured, and having witnessed someone get buried were predictors for somatic symptoms <b>among</b> <b>child</b> and adolescent survivors with probable PTSD. Somatic symptoms <b>among</b> <b>child</b> and adolescent earthquake survivors with probable PTSD in schools were common, and predictors of these somatic symptoms were identified.

40|$|Background. Malaria is an entrenched {{global health}} {{challenge}} {{particularly in the}} sub-Saharan African countries. However, in Ghana, {{little is known about}} the determinants of malaria prevalence <b>among</b> under-five <b>children.</b> As such, this study sought to examine the sociodemographic factors that determine malaria <b>among</b> under-five <b>children</b> in Ghana. Methods. This paper used secondary data drawn from the 2008 Ghana Demographic and Health Survey. Bivariate analysis and complementary log-log regression models were used to examine the determinants of malaria prevalence <b>among</b> under-five <b>children</b> in Ghana for the study period. Results. The results therefore revealed that region of residence, age of child, and ownership of mosquito net were the key predictors of malaria cases <b>among</b> under-five <b>children</b> in Ghana for the five-year period preceding the survey. Conclusion. It is therefore imperative that special education on prevention of malaria should be intensified by the National Malaria Control Programme in all the regions in order to reduce malaria prevalence particularly <b>among</b> under-five <b>children</b> in Ghana...|$|R
