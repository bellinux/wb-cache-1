5|$|A central {{principle}} of mainstream economics is that trade can make everyone better off through comparative advantage and efficiency gains from specialization <b>and</b> <b>greater</b> efficiency. Many feminist economists question this claim. Diane Elson, Caren Grown and Nilufer Cagatay explore {{the role that}} gender inequalities play in international trade and how such trade reshapes gender inequality itself. They and other feminist economists explore whose interests specific trade practices serve.|$|E

This cored wire is {{more expensive than the}} standard solid wire and can generate fumes and/or slag, but it permits even higher welding speed <b>and</b> <b>greater</b> metal penetration.|$|E
