The predicted optical colours {{as a function of}} stellar mass agree well with observation, with the SKIRT model showing marked improvement over a simple dust-screen model. The orientation dependence of attenuation is weaker than observed because EAGLE galaxies are generally puffier than real galaxies, due to the pressure floor imposed on the interstellar medium (ISM).

The fraction of galaxies with stellar mass greater than 10 (10) M-circle dot that are deemed passive is slightly smaller than observed, which is due to low levels of residual star formation in these simulated galaxies.

40|$|Many {{models of}} early {{structure}} formation predict {{a period of}} heating immediately preceding reionization, when X-rays raise the gas temperature above that of the cosmic microwave background. These X-rays are often assumed to heat the intergalactic medium (IGM) uniformly, but in reality they will heat the gas more strongly closer to the sources. We develop a framework for calculating fluctuations in the 21 cm brightness temperature that originate from this spatial variation in the heating rate. High-redshift sources are highly clustered, leading to significant gas temperature fluctuations (with fractional variations ~ 40 %, peaking on k~ 0. 1 Mpc^{- 1 } scales). This induces a distinctive peak-trough structure in the angle-averaged 21 cm power spectrum, which may be accessible to the proposed Square Kilometre Array. This signal reaches the ~ 10 mK level, and is stronger than that induced by Lyman <b>alpha</b> <b>flux</b> fluctuations. As well as probing the thermal evolution of the IGM before reionization, this 21 cm signal contains information about the spectra of the first X-ray sources. Finally, we consider disentangling temperature, density and Lyman <b>alpha</b> <b>flux</b> fluctuations as functions of redshift.

40|$|It {{has been}} {{observed}} experimentally in deuterium-tritium shots of the Tokamak Fusion Test Reactor (TFTR) that crashes of sawtooth oscillations may result in very inhomogeneous flux of alpha particles to the wall. Namely, measurements with four detectors installed at the wall at 20 °, 45 °, 60 °, and 90 ° below the midplane of the torus {{have shown that the}} <b>alpha</b> <b>flux</b> to the wall is strongly peaked at the 20 ° and 90 ° detectors and on the noise level at the 45 ° detector. To explain this phenomenon, both theoretical analysis and numerical simulation have been carried out. It is concluded that the "crash-induced prompt loss," i. e., the orbital loss of marginally trapped particles arising because of the crash-induced orbit transformation of circulating particles, is responsible for the flux to the 90 ° and 60 ° detectors, whereas the crash-induced stochastic diffusion of moderately trapped particles explains the large signal at the 20 ° detector. The calculated poloidal distributions of the integral <b>alpha</b> <b>flux</b> are in reasonable agreement with experimental data.

While previous results have shown that low-redshift LAEs have a lower space density than their high-redshift analogs, these results show that star-forming LAEs at low-redshift are rarer still. Accounting for differences in available AGN classification methods, we conclude that rest-frame optical spectroscopy is necessary to identify low-luminosity AGNs in LAEs at high redshift, and that limits on the X-ray flux are necessary {{to determine the extent to}} which the AGN contaminates the Lyman <b>alpha</b> <b>fluxes.</b> Comment: Replaced with ApJL accepted version, 5 pages, 2 figure...|$|R

We investigate radio detection quality including measured and derived parameters for all detected or marginally detected PNe from this combined sample. Some II objects from the observed sample have been successfully detected and parametrized. Except for one, all detected PNe have very low radio surface brightnesses. We use a statistical distance scale method to calculate distances and ionised masses of the detected objects. Nebulae from this sample are found to be large (> 0. 2 pc in diameter) and highly diluted which indicates old age. For 21 PNe from this sample we list integrated H <b>alpha</b> <b>fluxes</b> and interstellar extinction coefficients, either taken from the literature or derived here from the Balmer decrement and radio to H alpha ratio methods.

In these models {{the growth of the}} diffuse cosmic web differs from the standard Lambda CDM case: the density distribution is skewed towards underdense regions and the matter power spectra are typically larger (in a scale-dependent way).

The flux power spectrum is also affected at the similar to 2 per cent (similar to 5 - 10 per cent) level for beta = 0. 08 (beta = 0. 2) in a redshift-dependent way.

In addition, the ARTEMIS mission monitored the solar wind alpha particle flux to the Moon. Modeling the lunar helium exosphere, we relate the LAMP polar observations to the LADEE equatorial observations. Further, using the ARTEMIS <b>alpha</b> <b>flux</b> in the Monte Carlo model reproduces the temporal variations in helium density. Comparing the LAMP data to the LADEE data shows excellent agreement. Comparing those with the ARTEMIS data reveals that the solar wind <b>alpha</b> <b>flux</b> is the primary driver to variability in the helium exosphere throughout the LADEE mission. Using a decay time for exospheric helium of 5 days, we determine that the solar wind contributes 64 +/- 5 % of the helium to the lunar exosphere. The remaining 36 +/- 5 % is presumed to come from outgassing of radiogenic helium from {{the interior of the}} Moon. Furthermore, the model reproduces the measurements if 63 +/- 6 % of the incident alpha particles are converted to thermalized helium atoms through the interaction between the alphas and the lunar surface.

40|$|We present {{evidence}} for a correlation between the observed properties of hot Jupiter emission spectra and the activity levels of the host stars measured using Ca II H & K emission lines. We find that planets with dayside emission spectra that are well-described by standard 1 D atmosphere models with water in absorption (HD 189733, TrES- 1, TrES- 3, WASP- 4) orbit chromospherically active stars, while planets with emission spectra {{that are consistent with}} the presence of a strong high-altitude temperature inversion and water in emission orbit quieter stars. We estimate that active G and K stars have Lyman <b>alpha</b> <b>fluxes</b> that are typically a factor of 4 - 7 times higher than quiet stars with analogous spectral types, and propose that the increased UV flux received by planets orbiting active stars destroys the compounds responsible for the formation of the observed temperature inversions. In this paper we also derive a model-independent method for differentiating between these two atmosphere types using the secondary eclipse depths measured in the 3. 6 and 4. 5 micron bands on the Spitzer Space Telescope, and argue that the observed correlation is independent of the inverted/non-inverted paradigm for classifying hot Jupiter atmospheres.

These bright objects lie in the redshift interval z=[2. 5, 4. 3] and have luminosities 3. 4 × 10 ^ 45 ≲λ L_λ≲ 3. 4 × 10 ^ 46 erg/s at 1450 A. Utilizing improved spectrophotometric flux calibrations relative to nearby compact stars observed simultaneously, we are able to measure the flux changes in Lyman alpha and the nearby continuum at two epochs. We find 20 objects that exhibit Lyman <b>alpha</b> BEL <b>flux</b> variability at a significance level greater than 5 sigma on time-scales ranging from days to years in the quasar rest frame. The results show that, although some earlier work showed no significant detections of Lyman <b>alpha</b> BEL <b>flux</b> changes in a quasar sample with even higher luminosity, variability is present and readily observable in the sample studied here. We also consider the CIV lambda 1549 BEL. The lack of a strong correlation between Lyman alpha BEL variability and nearby continuum variability is consistent with the presence of a time lag between the variations, whereas the presence of a stronger correlation between Lyman alpha BEL variability and CIV BEL variability suggests that these BEL regions (BELRs) are at similar distances from the central ionizing source.

Most of the Pleiades targets were selected from the recent Hambly, Hawkins, and Jameson proper motion survey, where they were identified as probable Pleiades brown dwarfs with an age spread from 3 to 70 Myr. Our spectroscopic data and a reinterpretation of the photometric data confirm that these objects are indeed likely Pleiades members; however, we believe that they more likely have masses slightly above the hydrogen burning mass limit and that there is no firm evidence for an age spread amongst these stars. All of the very low mass Pleiades and Hyades members show H alpha in emission. However, the ratio of H <b>alpha</b> <b>flux</b> to biometric flux in the Pleiades shows a maximum near M(sub Bol) approximately equal to 9. 5 (M approximately equal to 0. 3 solar mass) and a sharp decrease to lower masses. This break occurs at the approximate mass where low mass stars are expected to become fully convective, and it is tempting to assume that the decrease in H <b>alpha</b> <b>flux</b> is caused by some change in the behavior of stellar dynamos at this mass.

E+A galaxies lacking narrow emission lines have 2. 2 to 12 micron flux ratios or limits similar to old stellar populations. Galaxies with narrow emission lines have enhanced 12 micron flux. Excess 12 micron emission is therefore correlated {{with the presence of}} on-going star formation or an AGN. From the mid/far infrared colors of the brightest galaxy in our sample, we estimate the far infrared luminosity of these galaxies. Current star formation rates estimated from H <b>alpha</b> <b>fluxes</b> are consistent with the enhanced 12 micron emission. Comparison of the current star formation rates with previous rates estimated from the Balmer absorption features shows that the current rates in some of the galaxies in our sample are lower than they must have been during the formation of the population causing the Balmer absorption features. Early-type galaxies with E+A spectral features are unlikely to be a major contributor to the total far infrared Coma cluster luminosity. We estimate this luminosity through number counts of radio sources, IRAS sources and galaxies detected in Hα emission. We find that star formation in late type galaxies, rather than emission from intracluster dust, is a significant, probably dominant, component of the Coma cluster luminosity. This conclusion appears to extend to nearby rich clusters in general.

A parent sample of 863 star-forming galaxies is used to calculate a B-band luminosity function. This is then populated with star formation information from a subsample of 327 galaxies, for which we have H alpha imaging, firstly by calibrating a relationship between galaxy B-band luminosity and star formation rate, and secondly by a Monte Carlo simulation of a representative sample of galaxies, in which star formation information is randomly sampled from the observed subset. The total star formation rate density of the local Universe is found to be between 0. 016 and 0. 023 MSun/yr/cubic Mpc, with the uncertainties being dominated by the internal extinction correction used in converting measured H <b>alpha</b> <b>fluxes</b> to star formation rates. If our internally derived B-band luminosity function is replaced by one from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey blue sequence, the star formation rate densities are approx. 60 % of the above values. We also calculate the contribution to the total star formation rate density from galaxies of different luminosities and Hubble T-types. The largest contribution comes from bright galaxies with B absolute mag of approx. - 20 mag, and the total contribution from galaxies fainter than - 15. 5 mag is less than 10 %. Almost 60 % of the star formation rate density comes from galaxies of types Sb, Sbc or Sc; 9 % from galaxies earlier than Sb and 33 % from galaxies later than Sc.

By suitably positioning the X-Shooter slit based on high spatial resolution images of Hubble Space Telescope/Advanced Camera for Surveys {{we are able to}} detect absorbing galaxies in seven out of nine fields (similar to 78 per cent success rate) at impact parameters from 10 to 30 kpc. In five out of seven fields the absorbing galaxies are confirmed via detection of multiple emission lines at the redshift of DLAs where only one out of five also emits a faint continuum. In two out of these five fields we detect a second galaxy at the DLA redshift. Extinction corrected star formation rates (SFRs) of these DLA galaxies, estimated using their H <b>alpha</b> <b>fluxes,</b> are in the range 0. 3 - 6. 7 M-aS (TM) yr(- 1). The emission metallicities of these five DLA galaxies are estimated to be from 0. 2 to 0. 9 Z(aS (TM)). Based on the Voigt profile fits to absorption lines we find the metallicity of the absorbing neutral gas to be in a range of 0. 05 - 0. 6 Z(aS (TM)). The two remaining DLA galaxies are quiescent galaxies with SFR 0. 4 M-aS (TM) yr(- 1) (3 sigma) presenting continuum emission but no emission lines. Using X-Shooter spectrum we estimate i-band absolute magnitude of - 19. 5 +/- 0. 2 for both these DLA galaxies that indicates they are sub-L-a galaxies. Comparing our results with that of other surveys in the literature we find a possible redshift evolution of the SFR of DLA galaxies...|$|R
40|$|We {{demonstrate}} that the Lyman <b>alpha</b> forest <b>flux</b> power spectrum of 'randomized' quasi-stellar object (QSO) absorption spectra is comparable in shape and amplitude to the flux power spectrum of the original observed spectra. In the randomized spectra a random shift in wave-length {{has been added to}} the observed absorption lines as identified and fitted with VPFIT. At 0. 03 s km(- 1) 15 contribute at large scales, k < 0. 03 s km(- 1). We further show that a fraction of &GSIM; 15 per cent of the mean flux decrement is contributed by strong absorbers at z &GSIM; 2. 1. Analysis of the flux power spectrum which use numerical simulations with too few strong absorption systems calibrated with the observed mean flux may underestimate the inferred rms fluctuation amplitude and the slope of the initial dark matter power spectrum...|$|R
40|$|Disturbed galaxies {{with two}} nuclei display the final {{state of the}} {{interaction}} process of two galaxies (Kollatschny et al., 1986; Fricke and Kollatschny, 1989). A few of these double nucleus galaxies contain Seyfert nuclei. Making {{the assumption that the}} Seyfert galaxies Mkn 231 and Mkn 273 are galaxies in the final state of merging, having strong tidal arms but unresolved nuclei, one can estimate that 4 percent of all Seyfert galaxies are in the merging process. The luminosities of multiple nucleus Seyfert galaxies are extremely high in comparison to morphologically undisturbed Seyfert galaxies. In a table, mean values of the visual and blue luminosities and of the far-infrared and radio (6 cm) luminosities as well as the H <b>alpha</b> <b>fluxes</b> are listed for both classes are shown. In addition, the authors have separated Seyfert 1 and Seyfert 2 galaxies. In all cases the luminosities of double nucleus Seyfert galaxies are higher by a factor of more than two with respect to undisturbed Seyfert galaxies. This result might be explained by higher luminosities in the early phases of a Seyfert's life-under the assumption that the nonthermal activity is triggered by tidal interaction-and/or additional strong starburst phenomena. Due to strong nuclear absorption, the UV spectra of these Seyfert nuclei are unusually weak. Corresponding to the Seyfert survey, the authors obtained the H alpha and far infrared radiation (FIR) luminosities as well as the (0 III) 5007 /H beta line ratios of a small sample of non-Seyfert nuclei in double nucleus galaxies. The direct image and the velocity field of the double starburst galaxy Mkn 788 (Kollatschny et al., 1986) are shown. The authors compared their measurements with those of normal interacting galaxies of Keel et al. (1985) and Bushouse (1987). The mean FIR luminosity per nucleus in multiple systems is {{the same as that of}} interacting galaxies. But the mean H alpha luminosities as well as the (OIII) /H beta line ratios are higher by a factor of 1. 5 - 2 than those of normal interacting galaxies...|$|R
