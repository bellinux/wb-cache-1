2500|$|In June 1900, Weber {{was almost}} 21 and {{was living with}} her parents and two sisters at 1717 Fremont Street, Allegheny, Pennsylvania, where she was a music student. By April 1903, Weber was {{performing}} as a soprano singer and pianist. She toured the United States as a concert pianist with renowned harpist Mrs Apt Thomas until her final performance in Charleston, South Carolina a year later. After an unfortunate incident when a piano key broke during a recital, Weber retired from the concert stage, having lost her nerve to play in public. Weber describes the incident that precipitated her retirement: [...] "Just <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>started</b> <b>to</b> play a black key came off in my hand. I kept forgetting that the key was not there, and reaching for it. The incident broke my nerve. I could not finish and I never appeared on the concert stage again. It is my belief that when that key came off in my hand, a certain phase of my development came to an end." ...|$|E

But he had actually seen me <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>started</b> <b>to</b> run. From then onwards he had hunted by sight, for the path showed him where I had gone. Now, as he came round the curve, he was springing in great bounds. The moonlight shone upon his huge projecting eyes, the row of enormous teeth in his open mouth, and the gleaming fringe of claws upon his short, powerful forearms. With a scream of terror I turned and rushed wildly down the path. Behind me the thick, gasping breathing of the creature sounded louder and louder. His heavy footfall was beside me. Every instant I expected to feel his grip upon my back. And then suddenly there came a crash--I was falling through space, and everything beyond was darkness and rest.|$|E

I sent Sherman to do this himself. I did not wish the knowledge of my presence to be known to the army generally; so I left it to Sherman to negotiate the terms of the surrender solely by himself, and without the enemy knowing that I was anywhere near the field.

The simple, pastoral melodies and the subsequent harmonies are inspired by the great English Romantics, as I felt this style was also perfectly suited to capture the natural and pastoral soul of the season.

5000|$|When {{asked about}} {{the concept of the}} album, Bannon said:"Lyrically/Thematically: After Jane Doe was {{recorded}} and released, I thought I was going to feel the emotional burden I was carrying lift from my shoulders. I had all the puzzle pieces there in front of me. Outlets bring closure, or at least that's what I thought. With that, I put myself out on the line looking for an emotional resolve with [...] "Jane..." [...] and it never came. When the album was released I didn't feel any better, nothing was changed. My depression kept collapsing on itself. At that point I stopped hoping and searching and I took a long hard look at my life and at my heart. I did a huge amount of soul searching and found so much failure within myself. That discovery was a massive realization. <b>As</b> <b>I</b> <b>started</b> <b>to</b> see clear again, I also saw the failure in friends and loved ones around me. How we fail each other, and how we fail ourselves. These are songs of failure. And ultimately, surviving self destruction and tragedy we all face in our lives. Musically our only goal was to write an album that moved us and challenged us. We feel we accomplished that."Bannon states the lyrics are [...] "opinionated" [...] and that there is definitely a rage in the writings that are not apparent in previous albums.|$|E
5000|$|De Villiers {{was born}} at Hillbrow in Johannesburg, South Africa, where she spent {{the first months of}} her life in The Princess Alice Home, a {{facility}} for adopted babies. Half-Australian and half-Ghanaian, she was adopted at nine months of age, although not told of it by her white adoptive parents until she was 20 years old. She has written about the impact of these experiences:"I started writing poetry when I was a child, my first published poem was when I was 11. I was brought up in a home that loved poetry and literature, especially the English language. But it was only when I was older that I realised that writing is so much more than words playing on a page. Writing contains the writer, their concerns, their social context and their history. My own history became a block to my creativity <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>started</b> <b>to</b> explore my identity as a black woman adopted by a white family in apartheid South Africa. I felt like the colonised and the coloniser were fighting each other inside my brain. Writing continued to be important to me but I was convinced that it was simply a therapeutic process, of no value to anyone else.As a mixed-race African and adoptee I feel, paradoxically, oppressed and completely free....My adult life has been largely devoted to healing this rift. The freedom of my paradoxical position, is in fact that I don't have the constraints of a traditional role and I have access to the world." ...|$|E

40|$|In {{thinking}} about how I might usefully contribute to the conference I was reminded of a comment by Stephen Brookfield (1994) who described the sense of impostership he felt when speaking publicly to groups of educators: “The more I know about their work, the more I feel humbled by their abilities … If I know too much about {{who they are and}} what they have done <b>as</b> educators, <b>I</b> <b>start</b> <b>to</b> say to myself ‘what on earth can I say to these people that has any chance of being taken seriously, or considered important, by them? (1994 : 207). Despite these reservations, I suspect that there are two things that bring us together and provide a point of mutual engagement: first, a shared feeling that things aren’t right; and second, a desire to change the way it is. In the case of the former, we could spend a considerable amount of time sharing stories of despair, frustration, outrage and even anger about the events, troubles and crises in our world and daily lives. Thankfully, each of us will also be able to share stories of success, joy, inspiration, and hope to nourish our sense of civic engagement. In the case of the latter, we all bring a different set of life trajectories, experiences and expertise to the task of changing our places and world. This conference provides a significant opportunity to both publicly and privately share these stories and in the process, articulate a more just, democratic and sustainable future for our children...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} I direct the focus to lesbian, gay, {{bisexual}} and transgender (LGBT) online communities in Taiwan. On the one hand, I {{argue that such}} online communities in Taiwan are worthwhile researching and deserve special academic attention because they touch upon Taiwan’s perpetual {{difference in the world}} as a de-facto, thereby questioning how a transnational perspective permanently influences or even changes the way national identity is or is not formulated. On the other, against the backdrop of globalisation, I highlight the fact of under-theorisation of issues and politics of sexuality dissidence in a non-western, non-dominant location and culture such <b>as</b> Taiwan. As <b>I</b> <b>start</b> <b>to</b> bridge the current gap of such insufficiencies in unevenly distributed research interests {{in some parts of the}} world rather than others, I also make a point of fighting against surveillance and control in cyberspace. Ultimately, such studies on Taiwanese LGBT online communities are not possible without continuous attempts and efforts in trying to keep freedom of expression and anonymity to certain extent...|$|R
