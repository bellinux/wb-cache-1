When the total concentration of oxygen in the tank reaches about 11%, the upper and lower flammable limits converge and the flammable range disappears.|$|E

5|$|Finally {{the tidal}} radius, or Hill sphere, is the {{distance}} {{from the center of the}} globular cluster <b>at</b> <b>which</b> <b>the</b> external gravitation of the galaxy has more influence over the stars in the cluster than does the cluster itself. This is the distance <b>at</b> <b>which</b> <b>the</b> individual stars belonging to a cluster can be separated away by the galaxy.

5|$|Parallel {{computers}} can be roughly classified {{according to the}} level <b>at</b> <b>which</b> <b>the</b> hardware supports parallelism, with multi-core and multi-processor computers having multiple processing elements within a single machine, while clusters, MPPs, and grids use multiple computers {{to work on the}} same task. Specialized parallel computer architectures are sometimes used alongside traditional processors, for accelerating specific tasks.|$|E
5|$|Parallel {{computers}} can be roughly classified {{according to the}} level <b>at</b> <b>which</b> <b>the</b> hardware supports parallelism.
