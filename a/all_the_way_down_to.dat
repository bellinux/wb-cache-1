25|$|Almost all {{production}} in Alsace is of AOC wine, {{since there is}} no Vin de pays region which covers Alsace. Thus, the only alternative to producing AOC wine is to declassify it <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> Vin de table, which generally means that neither grape varieties, region of origin or vintage may be identified. However, this solution is mostly avoided since edelzwicker and gentil may be blended from several varieties, i.e. varieties that exceed the AOC rules in the concerned season.|$|E

25|$|In {{the third}} quarter, the Vikings {{took the lead}} with Peterson getting a 73-yard TD run for the only score of the period. In the fourth quarter, Minnesota {{increased}} its lead with kicker Ryan Longwell getting a 48-yard field goal. The Bears would reply with kicker Robbie Gould getting a 32-yard field goal. The Vikings would answer with Peterson getting a 35-yard TD run. Chicago would tie the game with Griese completing a 33-yard TD pass to WR Muhsin Muhammad, along with an 81-yard TD pass to Hester. But on the ensuing kickoff, Adrian Peterson sprinted <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> the Chicago 38-yard line, setting up Ryan Longwell's game-winning 55-yard field goal.|$|E

25|$|In 105 BCE, while {{marching to}} Arausio, the Proconsul of Cisalpine Gaul Quintus Servilius Caepio plundered the sanctuaries {{of the town}} of Tolosa, whose {{inhabitants}} had joined the Cimbri, finding over 50,000 15lb. bars of gold and 10,000 15lb. bars of silver. The riches of Tolosa were shipped back to Rome, but only the silver made it: the gold was stolen by a band of marauders, who were believed to have been hired by Caepio himself and to have killed the legion guarding it. The Gold of Tolosa was never found, and was said to have been passed <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> the last heir of the Servilii Caepiones, Marcus Junius Brutus.|$|E
25|$|While, in 1893, Literatorul hosted {{fragments}} of Thalassa in its Romanian-language version, the author also launched a daily, Lumina ("The Light"). It {{was also at}} that stage that Alexandru Macedonski associated with Cincinat Pavelescu, the noted epigrammarian, who joined him in editing Literatorul, and with whom he co-authored the 1893 verse tragedy depicting the Biblical hero Saul, and named after him. Although showcased by the National Theater with star actor Constantin Nottara in the title role, it failed to register success with the public. Two years later, the two Literatorul editors made headlines as pioneers of cycling. An enthusiastic promoter of the sport, Macedonski joined fellow poet Constantin Cantilli on a marathon, pedaling from Bucharest {{across the border into}} Austria-Hungary, <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> Brașov.|$|E
25|$|Later in the quarter, the Giants {{drove to}} the Eagles 23-yard line.

Philadelphia responded by driving 46 yards in ten plays, including a first down rush by Westbrook, allowing the Eagles to take the clock <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> three seconds before calling on Akers to kick a 38-yard field goal as time expired.|$|E

25|$|The {{most common}} way of {{recycling}} graphite occurs when synthetic graphite electrodes are either manufactured and pieces are cut off or lathe turnings are discarded, or the electrode (or other) are used <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> the electrode holder. A new electrode replaces the old one, but a sizeable {{piece of the}} old electrode remains. This is crushed and sized, and the resulting graphite powder is mostly used to raise the carbon content of molten steel. Graphite-containing refractories are sometimes also recycled, but often not because of their graphite: the largest-volume items, such as carbon-magnesite bricks that contain only 15–25% graphite, usually contain too little graphite. However, some recycled carbon-magnesite brick is {{used as the basis}} for furnace-repair materials, and also crushed carbon-magnesite brick is used in slag conditioners. While crucibles have a high graphite content, the volume of crucibles used and then recycled is very small.|$|E
25|$|Any real {{measuring}} instrument has a limited range over {{which it can}} accurately measure absorbance. An instrument must be calibrated and checked against known standards if the readings are to be trusted. Many instruments will become non-linear (fail to follow the Beer–Lambert law) starting at approximately 2 AU (~1% transmission). It is also difficult to accurately measure very small absorbance values (below 10−4) with commercially available instruments for chemical analysis. In such cases, laser-based absorption techniques can be used, since they have demonstrated detection limits that supersede those obtained by conventional non-laser-based instruments by many orders of magnitude (detections have been demonstrated <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> 5 × 10−13). The theoretical best accuracy for most commercially available non-laser-based instruments is in the range near 1 AU. The path length or concentration should then, when possible, be adjusted to achieve readings near this range.|$|E
25|$|In 1920, Colter began a long {{effort to}} control {{the waters of the}} Colorado River. He began an effort to put {{construct}} a series of dams from southern Utah <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> Yuma, Arizona. The dams would store water, which would be used to reclaim over 6,000,000 acres of arid land through irrigation. The proposal was supposed to pay for itself through the sale of the power generated by the dams. In December 1921, the Arizona Fish and Game was formed, with Colter serving on its executive committee. In 1922, under doctor's orders, Colter booked an around-the-world cruise to recover his health. The itinerary of the trip included Hawaii, the Philippines, China, Japan, India and the mid-East. The trip was postponed when Colter learned of the Sante Fe Compact. He returned to Arizona and began a decades long fight to keep the lion's share of the water from the Colorado River for use in Arizona.|$|E
