40|$|A Polar Traverse Rover (PTR) is {{a device}} {{designed}} to determine the role of Antarctica in the global climate system by determining typical paths of continental air that passes the South Pole, and by obtaining insight into the relationship between events at the <b>Antarctic</b> and the <b>meteorology</b> of sub-polar altitudes. The PTR is a 2 -m-diameter ball in which an Iridium modem, with an integrated global positioning system (GPS) receiver and a commercial lithium battery pack, is suspended. The modem is attached to an aluminum plate and is surrounded by shock-absorbing plastic for protection. This core {{is attached to the}} interior walls of the shell by strings on three axis points. The unit s total weight is 10 kg, and it returns data regarding location, altitude, ground velocity, and vertical velocity. The PTR traverses the terrain solely through being blown around by the wind. The unit is much lighter than its predecessor, the Tumbleweed, and requires less wind to put it in motion and to sustain motion. The system is autonomous, requiring minimal monitoring, and enables long-range, unmanned scientific surface surveys in harsh environments...|$|R
40|$|We have {{assembled}} {{a team with}} expertise in astronomical site testing in the Antarctic and expertise in <b>Antarctic</b> <b>meteorology,</b> to answer the outstanding questions that must be answered before major facilities for optical and infrared astronomy can be deployed to the Antarctic plateau. Previous work {{has shown that the}} Antarctic Plateau is the best site on earth for many types of astronomical observation. The dry, tenuous and extremely cold air leads to considerable gains in sensitivity for the measurement of radiation fluxes incident on the earth from space across many wavebands. Optical turbulence in a boundary layer covering the plateau remains to be characterized, however. Understanding it is key to design of future telescopes or arrays of telescopes. Measurements should be made at a number of sites, including Dome A, Dome F, and a transantarctic mountain site...|$|E
40|$|This volume {{presents}} a comprehensive {{account of the}} {{theory and practice of}} weather forecasting in the Antarctic. It is designed to be of practical use to forecasters on the Antarctic stations and on research/supply vessels, but will also be of value to those concerned with research into <b>Antarctic</b> <b>meteorology</b> and climatology. It splits broadly into two parts. In the first, the climatology of the Antarctic is reviewed and there are discussions {{on the nature of the}} weather systems found over the continent and Southern Ocean. The means used to forecast all the main meteorological elements are discussed as well as the use of satellite data and the output of numerical weather prediction models. In the second part, the meteorological conditions found at various locations around the Antarctic are considered and guidance provided on the forecasting rules and techniques used at specific locations. JOHN TURNER is a research scientist at the British Antarctic Survey (BAS) in Cambridge, UK where he leads a project investigating the climate of the Antarctic. He has a BSc in Meteorology/Physics and a PhD in Antarctic Climate Variability. From 1974 to 1986 he worked at the UK Meteorological Office where he was in involved in the development of numerical weather prediction models and satellite meteorology. He also spent a year as...|$|E
40|$|Meteorological {{observations}} are made at Advance Camp (74 ° 12 ′S, 34 ° 59 ′E, 3200 m above sea level) in East Queen Maud Land, Antarctica, from 7 February 1985 to 3 January 1986. The observations included those by a long-term unmanned weather recoder which operated from 1 March to 15 October 1985,with some interruption {{due to the}} extremely low temperature below - 60 ℃. The total duration of data amounted to 10 months for the air temperature and 8 months for the wind speed and direction. The annual mean temperature and wind speed are - 43. 6 ℃ and 8. 2 m/s, respectively, which are estimated from the temperature difference from and the wind speed ratio to those at Mizuho Station. The wind direction constancy (W. SCHWERDTFEGER : Weather and Climate of the Antarctic, Amsterdam, Elsevier, 261 p., 1984) {{is as high as}} 0. 93 perhaps because of the steep slope (2. 7 ×(10) ^) in spite of the high altitude. We conclude that this new station is located in the Cold Katabatic region (P. C. DALRYMPLE : <b>Antarctic</b> <b>Meteorology,</b> ed. by M. J. RUBIN, 195, 1966 (Antarct. Res. Ser., 9)). Concentrated observations including low-level soundings with radiosondes and pilot balloons are carried out in November and December. Wind spirals up to 2000 m above the ice surface indicated that the wind in the free atmosphere influences strongly the surface wind and that the role of surface inversion is rather small. The surface wind system in the summer seems to be strongly affected by the synoptic pressure systems. The importance of diurnal activities is also made clear. The height of a diurnal mixing layer reaches about 400 m and the strength of a blizzard is observed to be amplified on the plateau perhaps because of the instability of the surface layer...|$|E
40|$|The in situ {{meteorological}} observing {{network in}} the Antarctic and Southern Ocean region is sparsely populated relative to other continents. Numerical weather prediction skill in Antarctica is poor, and as a scientific community our understanding of Antarctic atmospheric processes is underdeveloped. Yet the atmospheric dynamics occurring in the Antarctic region impact greatly on the weather of populated continents further north. Here several meteorological analysis and forecasting problems are investigated with {{close attention to the}} Antarctic continent and the surrounding Southern Ocean. Scatterometer wind data, derived from satellite measurements of microwave backscatter by the ocean surface, are an important modern source of data for Southern Ocean Meteorology. Wind speed and direction estimates from the scatterometer instrument flown on-board the European Space Agency ERS- 1 satellite are tested for accuracy against numerical model fields. Alternative algorithms have been developed by several meteorological agencies to deduce surface wind speed and direction from microwave backscatter measurements. Comparison is made between 10 m wind estimates generated by two alternative algorithms and co-located data from the European Centre for Medium Range Weather Forecasts' numerical analyses. Some limitations in the derivation algorithms, unique to the Southern Ocean, are detected. A data impact study, conducted {{within the framework of the}} Australian Bureau of Meteorology global data assimilation and prediction system (GASP), was conducted to assess the influence of ERS- 1 scatterometer winds on numerical analyses and forecasts. The study identified several cases of substantial analysis impact, predominantly over the Southern Ocean. Mean impact statistics from 120 six-hourly assimilation cycles indicated a small positive impact on 24 and 48 hour forecast skill. The number of positive impact events exceeded the number of negative impact events and the inclusion of scatterometer data reduced the magnitude of forecast errors. The majority of large impact events arose from simultaneous assimilation of two or more observing systems coincident in time and space. Large discrepancies between model air-pressure predictions and drifting buoy reports often resulted in the elimination of the latter on quality control grounds. On numerous occasions the superposition of scatterometer winds provided sufficient supporting evidence for the inclusion to proceed and subsequently generate improved analyses and forecasts. Another valuable form of remotely sensed atmospheric data comes from the TIROS Operational Vertical Sounder (TOVS). Estimates of thickness between pressure surfaces, variously from the surface to 250 hPa, were used heavily for meteorological analysis during the Antarctic First Regional Observing Study of the Troposphere (1 -ROST). Here TOVS estimates are compared with co-incident radiosonde data from Antarctic and sub-Antarctic meteorological stations, supporting their validation. The representation of the Antarctic surface temperature inversion in the GASP analyses is measured against results from observational studies. Improved boundary layer structure in later versions of the model is confirmed and surface wind forecasting skill has improved. Fluctuations in inversion depth and strength in successive model analyses and prognoses is identified as a wind strength forecasting aid for coastal locations. The forecast skill of numerical weather prediction systems has increased steadily over the past two decades. The GASP system, on which the bulk of this work focuses, has also seen substantial skill increases. Improvements in forecast skill of the Australian global system have come from a combination of incremental changes over many years. While horizontal and vertical resolution has increased substantially, skill improvements in the Antarctic and Southern Ocean region have also come from the marked increase in data supply and usage. Particularly important are remotely sensed data, automatic weather stations and drifting buoys. The potential for further dramatic skill improvement in the years ahead is real. Proposed future satellite missions will offer a great deal to Antarctic Atmospheric Science. Significant new satellite systems will include NPOESS (USA; programme beginning 2005), COSMIC (USA/Taiwan; programme beginning 2005), ADEOS-II (Japan; launch planned for 2002), ENVISAT (European Space Agency; launched March 2002), Coriolis (USA; launch planned for August 2002) and MetOp- 1 (European Space Agency; launch planned for 2005). Together they will provide the Meteorological Community with advanced atmospheric profiling technology, improved quality and resolution surface wind data, higher resolution multi-channel imagery and more. These remote sensing advances will come alongside an expanding network of automatic weather stations on the Antarctic continent and ongoing improvements to numerical modelling systems. <b>Antarctic</b> <b>Meteorology</b> is set to continue to benefit from the incorporation of existing observing systems as well as from new systems as they become available...|$|E
