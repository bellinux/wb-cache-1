40|$|Abstract This {{exploratory}} {{case study}} {{looks at the}} implementation <b>of</b> an adjusted <b>budgeting</b> practice at a market leader in the Dutch catering industry. The goal of the paper is to verify {{the applicability of the}} EAF in understanding the change processes involved when budgeting practices are changed. The research is formulated around the budgeting paradox debate which reveals that despite strong disadvantages to the traditional budgeting approach, there remains limited empirical evidence of organizations changing their approach to budgeting. Waal, Hermkens-Janssen, & Ven (2011) provide a framework, named the Evolutionary Adoption Framework, that looks to uncover potential reasons for the existence <b>of</b> the <b>budgeting</b> paradox. This is done by looking at four aspects that play a role in acceptance of changes by organizational members: the motives of the people involved, the constraints that may influence activities, the activities in the adoption process and the order and interaction of activities. This paper applies the framework on the two business units at Albron, Catering and Leisure in order to examine the different levels <b>of</b> <b>adoption</b> <b>of</b> the newly implemented rolling forecast. It becomes apparent that the factors uncovered through the Evolutionary Adoption Framework do influence the <b>adoption</b> <b>of</b> <b>budgeting</b> practices in organizations and help explain the adoption levels within Albron. The exploratory case study findings show that the pre-conscious constraints present at Catering along with the complexity of the business unit and the instability of the unit structure are the primary factors influencing implementation and institutionalism <b>of</b> the new <b>budgeting</b> practice. The paper uses the case study findings to suggest an expansion of the original Evolutionary Adoption Framework, which reflects a process view when looking at the <b>adoption</b> <b>of</b> <b>budgeting</b> practices. The role of leadership and momentum to change, visible in the accounting change model (Cobb, Helliar, & Innes, 1995), have an important task when attempting to overcome potential barriers or constraints that may hamper <b>adoption</b> <b>of</b> new <b>budgeting</b> practices. These factors are supported by evidence in the case study findings. Keywords: budgeting practices, budgeting paradox, Evolutionary Adoption Framework, adoption processes, change...|$|R

It also examines the moderating role of attitude towards change on the relationship between tolerance for ambiguity and the <b>adoption</b> <b>of</b> Performance-Based <b>Budgeting</b> System (PBBS). The data is obtained from a survey of 432 respondents comprising: financiers, accountants and policy makers in the Libyan higher learning institutions. Hierarchical multiple regression was used to test whether factors such as tolerance for ambiguity and attitude toward change influence the <b>adoption</b> <b>of</b> PBBS. The findings provide support for the hypothesized negative relationship between the <b>adoption</b> <b>of</b> PPBS and tolerance for ambiguity and the importance of attitude toward change as a moderating variable.

40|$|There {{would appear}} to be a growing {{consensus}} among OECD member countries concerning the merits of adopting accrual accounting in the public sector. Nearly one-third of member countries have adopted full accrual accounting {{and a number of other}} member countries have adopted accrual accounting for specific transactions – most frequently for the recording of interest on the public debt and employee pension costs (see Table 1). There {{would appear to}} be less consensus regarding the <b>adoption</b> <b>of</b> accrual <b>budgeting</b> (accrual appropriations) 1 where views diverge widely on its desirability. Only three member countries have adopted full accrual budgeting, although several member countries have adopted accruals for specific transactions in the budget – again, most frequently for the recording of interest on the public debt and employee pension costs (see Table 2). This paper is not designed to advocate a specific stance in regards to the <b>adoption</b> <b>of</b> accrual <b>budgeting.</b> Rather, it is designed to focus attention on some of the key issues involved in accrual <b>budgeting.</b> The <b>adoption</b> <b>of</b> accrual <b>budgeting</b> often offers a wide range of options for implementing many of the key issues, and the paper aims to highlight these. The paper attempts to isolate the issues relevant to accrual budgeting specifically. For a more general discussion of accruals, see “Accrua...|$|R
