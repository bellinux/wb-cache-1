60|$|Finally, {{the unhappy}} 'Gold Axe,' after being {{publicly}} paraded upon a velvet cushion {{through the streets}} of Elmina, was entrusted to Captain Knapp Barrow, who returned to England by the next steamer. It was duly presented, and found its way to the South Kensington Museum, after faring very badly {{at the hands of the}} 'society journals' and other members of the fourth estate. [Footnote: For instance: 'The gold axe of King Koffee of Ashantee, lately sent, for an unexplained reason, to the Queen, is described as a triangular blade of iron, apparently out from a piece of boiler-plate, roughly stuck into a clumsy handle of <b>African</b> <b>oak.</b> The handle is covered with leopard-skin, part of which, immediately above the blade, is deeply soiled, apparently with blood. Bands of thin gold, enriched with uncouth chevrons and lunettes en repoussé, are placed round the handle. The sheath of the blade, which is of tiger (leopard) skin, accompanies this hideous implement, and attached to it is the sole element which has anything like artistic merit. This is a nondescript object of beaten gold, in shape something like a large cockle-shell with curved horns extending from the hinge, and not inelegantly decorated with lines and punctures, en repoussé and open work of quasi-scrolls.'] Needless to say it was an utter impostor.

40|$|The Mediterranean Sea has {{separated}} the sclerophyllous forests of southern Europe and northern Africa {{for millions of}} years, but its role structuring forest bird assemblages remains unclear. To address this issue we sampled bird assemblages in cork oak woodlands located {{north and south of}} the Strait of Gibraltar and compared abundance, diversity, and species and guild assemblage structure between regions. Abundance and diversity patterns were remarkably similar, but dissimilarity analyses of species and guild composition revealed differences in bird assemblage structure between regions. Differences are partly attributable to the effect of the Mediterranean as barrier to the dispersal of forest birds; a few species were unable to colonize North Africa, and many that colonized it remained in sufficient isolation to evolve into distinct taxa. In addition to this divergence of biogeographic genesis, assemblages also differ because in North <b>African</b> cork <b>oaks</b> woodlands forest and insectivorous specialist species are less abundant. This dissimilarity could be due to the effect of different exploitation levels present in each region. Managed cork oak woodlands are widespread in the Western Mediterranean, and are valuable because they conciliate economic exploitation with high biodiversity. In North Africa these woodlands are of greater conservation concern because they harbour endemic bird species that give its assemblage a distinct character, cover a smaller area, and are currently under greater pressure from overexploitation. These results highlight the importance to implement management practices that increase resilience and maintain biodiversity value throughout the range of cork oak woodlands...|$|R
40|$|Cork oak {{woodlands}} are a keystone {{habitat for}} Mediterranean biodiversity but are currently undergoing a global decline and widespread management changes driven by social, economic and climatic factors. I {{examine the effects}} of both climate and land management changes on cork oak woodlands and their bird communities across the western Mediterranean Basin. Future climatic scenarios indicate that up to 60 % of current cork oak woodlands may become unsuitable by 2080, especially in southern areas where they will be restricted to microclimatic refugia sites. Increasing aridity, particularly in drier microclimates, will potentiate a decline of cork oak tree condition resulting in impacts across the food web that ultimately {{have a negative effect on}} breeding bird abundance and diversity, particularly for tree-dependent forest species. Farmland and shrubland birds respond mainly to habitat features modified by land management and their abundances increase in areas with open and heterogeneous ground cover.

The unique bird assemblages of North <b>African</b> cork <b>oak</b> woodlands seem particularly vulnerable to both factors and should therefore be considered a conservation priority. Nonetheless, climate change may benefit species of Mediterranean origin and seems to have enabled the establishment of resident populations of traditionally migratory bird species in the Iberian Peninsula.
