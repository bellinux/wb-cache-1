5000|$|On May 17, 2009, Bell {{returned}} to host Coast to Coast AM live from Manila. His guest was professor Peter Ward. Topics of discussion were mass extinctions, earth's [...] "self-destructive" [...] phenomena, and life beyond planet earth. While on the <b>air,</b> <b>Bell</b> answered an email question from a listener who {{asked why he}} was in the Philippines again and how long he'd be there. Bell replied that he'd address it on [...] "Friday" [...] and hinted that his move might be permanent.|$|E
5000|$|Bell is {{a member}} of the U.S. Libertarian Party. Originally, Coast to Coast AM was a {{conservative}} political talk show, but in recent years Bell has expressed both conservative and liberal views on the air. On <b>air,</b> <b>Bell</b> has shown support for immigration reform and decriminalizing marijuana. At other times he has expressed dismay at the presence of millions of illegal aliens in the US. He has at times criticized man's role in degrading the natural environment, while at other times he expressed doubt about the scientific basis behind human caused global warming. In fact hundreds of times he agreed with guests or callers who claimed global cooling was occurring or was about to occur. Bell has also stated that he opposes abortion. At the outset of the Iraq War in 2003 he stated he did not think that a war against Iraq was worth the life of [...] "one American service man or woman." [...] Bell supports a free market economy.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThis {{study is}} aimed to {{identify}} the external features of the water spiders (Argyroneta aquatica) collected from “The Natural Monument No. 412 Yeoncheon Eundaeri Water Spider Habitat” through observation of their microstructures using a scanning electron microscope. There is no study on the microstructures of the water spiders excluding several studies on protection plans and ecological investigations, thus giving this study considerable academic significance. Based on the scanning electron microscopy analysis, the water spider has eight simple eyes, and both of its lateral simple eyes are stuck together. A lateral bump was confirmed on the upper jaw, and the pedipalps had six joints and the legs had seven joints. The abdomen and sternum of A.  aquatica have more hairs {{compared with those of}} land spiders, and its structure shows an elongated area of contact with the <b>air</b> <b>bell</b> so that the <b>air</b> <b>bell</b> can become attached to the abdomen better...|$|E
40|$|A phase doppler {{anemometer}} (PDA) {{was used}} {{to determine the effects of}} evaporation on water spray for three rotary bell atomizer operational variable parameters: shaping <b>air,</b> <b>bell</b> speed and liquid flow. Shaping air was set at either 200 standard liters per minute (L/min) or 300 L/min, bell speed was set to 30, 40 or 50 thousand rotations per minute (krpm) and water flow rate was varied between 100, 200 or 300 cubic centimeters per minute (cm 3 /min). The total evaporation between 22. 5 and 37. 5 cm from the atomizer (cm 3 /s) was calculated for all the combinations of those variables. Evaporation rate increased with higher flow rate and bell speed but no statistically significant effects were obtained for variable shaping air on interactions between parameters...|$|E
40|$|A vessel is plunged {{upside down}} into a pool of 50 cSt {{silicone}} oil. An <b>air</b> <b>bell</b> is then created. This bell is vertically shaken at 60 Hz {{that leads to the}} oscillation of the air/oil interface. The edges of the immersed vessel generate surface waves that propagate towards the center of the bell. When the amplitude of the oscillation increases, wave amplitude increases. We study the influence of the angle between successive sides on the wave patterns. Two kinds of vessel have been studied: a triangular and a square prism. The shape of the air/oil meniscus depends on the angle between the sides of the considered prism. As the amplitude of the oscillation is increased, the triple line, which is the contact line between the solid and the air/oil interface, moves up and down. Above a given acceleration that depends on the immersion depth and on the shape vessel, wave goes under the corner edge of the bell. During the oscillation, the wave generates at the edges presents a singularity that leads eventually to a jet and a drop ejection. A drop is ejected at each oscillation. More complicated ejection can be produced with further increase of the amplitude. This is a sample arXiv article illustrating the use of fluid dynamics videos.

40|$|The {{water spider}} Argyroneta aquatica (Clerck) {{is the only}} spider that spends its whole life under water. Water spiders keep an air bubble around their body for {{breathing}} and build under-water air bells, which they use for shelter and raising offspring, digesting and consuming prey, moulting, depositing eggs and sperm, and copulating. It is unclear whether these bells are an important oxygen reservoir for breathing under water, or whether they serve mainly to create water-free space for feeding and reproduction. In this study, we manipulated {{the composition of the}} gas inside the bell of female water spiders to test whether they monitor the quality of this gas, and replenish oxygen if required. We exchanged the entire gas in the bell either with pure O(2), pure CO(2), or with ambient air as control, and monitored behavioural responses. The test spiders surfaced and replenished air more often in the CO(2) treatment than in the O(2) treatment, and they increased bell building behaviour. In addition to active oxygen regulation, they monitored and adjusted the bells by adding silk. These results show that water spiders use the <b>air</b> <b>bell</b> as an oxygen reservoir, and that it functions as an external lung, which renders it essential for living under water permanently. A. aquatica is the only animal that collects, transports, and stores air, and monitors its property for breathing, which is an adaptive response of a terrestrial animal to the colonization of an aquatic habitat.
