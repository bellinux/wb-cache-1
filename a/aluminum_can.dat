25|$|In {{capacitors}} {{in which}} the internal pressure build-up {{was so great that}} the capacitor case was already bulging but the vent had not opened yet, the pH value of the electrolyte could be measured. The electrolyte of the faulty Taiwanese capacitors was alkaline, with a pH of between 7 and 8. Good comparable Japanese capacitors had an electrolyte that was acidic, with a pH of around 4. As it is known that <b>aluminum</b> <b>can</b> be dissolved by alkaline liquids, but not that which is mildly acidic, an energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX or EDS) fingerprint analysis of the electrolyte of the faulty capacitors was made, which detected dissolved aluminum in the electrolyte.|$|E

25|$|Supercapacitors are {{constructed}} with two metal foils (current collectors), each coated with an electrode material such as activated carbon, which {{serve as the}} power connection between the electrode material and the external terminals of the capacitor. Specifically to the electrode material {{is a very large}} surface area. In this example the activated carbon is electrochemically etched, so that the surface of the material is about a factor 100,000 larger than the smooth surface. The electrodes are kept apart by an ion-permeable membrane (separator) used as an insulator to protect the electrodes against short circuits. This construction is subsequently rolled or folded into a cylindrical or rectangular shape and can be stacked in an <b>aluminum</b> <b>can</b> or an adaptable rectangular housing. Then the cell is impregnated with a liquid or viscous electrolyte of organic or aqueous type. The electrolyte, an ionic conductor, enters the pores of the electrodes and serves as the conductive connection between the electrodes across the separator. Finally the housing is hermetically sealed to ensure stable behavior over the specified lifetime.|$|E

2500|$|A second {{aluminum}} foil strip, called the [...] "cathode foil", serves to make electrical {{contact with the}} electrolyte. [...] The spacer separates the foil strips to avoid direct metallic contact which would produce a short circuit. Lead wires are attached to both foils which are then rolled with the spacer into a wound cylinder which will fit inside an aluminum case or [...] "can". The winding is impregnated with liquid electrolyte. This provides a reservoir of electrolyte to extend the lifetime of the capacitor. The assembly is inserted into an <b>aluminum</b> <b>can</b> and sealed with a plug.

2500|$|The {{theory of}} the {{behavior}} of columns was investigated in 1757 by mathematician Leonhard Euler. He derived the formula, the Euler formula, that gives the maximum axial load that a long, slender, ideal column can carry without buckling. An ideal column is one that is perfectly straight, made of a homogeneous material, and free from initial stress. When the applied load reaches the Euler load, sometimes called the critical load, the column comes to be in a state of unstable equilibrium. At that load, the introduction of the slightest lateral force will cause the column to fail by suddenly [...] "jumping" [...] to a new configuration, and the column is said to have buckled. This is what happens when a person stands on an empty <b>aluminum</b> <b>can</b> and then taps the sides briefly, causing it to then become instantly crushed (the vertical sides of the can understood as an infinite series of extremely thin columns). The formula derived by Euler for long slender columns is given below.|$|E

As Anderson celebrated her tournament victory Saraya reappeared and threatened her.
