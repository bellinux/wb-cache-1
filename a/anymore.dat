5|$|In a story {{recorded}} {{in the area of}} Cetinje, a zduhać was mortally wounded on Mount Lovćen in a battle against the transmarine zduhaći.

He went by night to a valley where he saw horses, oxen, rams, billy goats, men, and women. He passed by them in total silence, before he saw a black ox. He struck the ox with a wooden bar, and the animal roared tremendously. When he returned home, he found the zduhać sound and healthy. As believed in the region of Birač, eastern Bosnia, a mortally wounded zduhać could get well if he burned beech buds in a milk bucket, and censed himself with the smoke, using a spindle to wave the smoke toward himself. Before performing this rite, he should have publicly confessed that he was a zduhać. Most zduhaći would reputedly rather die than do that, because afterwards they could no more fly as zduhaći. As thought in Herzegovina, a man {{who did not want to}} be a zduhać <b>anymore,</b> should have confessed to a priest and promised that he would not fly <b>anymore.</b>|$|E

5|$|It's not literal {{about the}} drug for me, I've never taken lithium before. It's sort of a metaphor about {{numbness}} and happiness... it's me looking at happiness {{in a negative way}} because I've always been... kind of afraid to be happy. Like with the band and the art and everything else, it's always like I'm never letting myself break through into the happiness it seems like, because it's not cool or something. And describing happiness is lithium, it's like saying 'that's numbness, I won't be able to be an artist <b>anymore</b> if I'm happy', which is hilarious because that's just not true, I'm happy. So it's... this fight within the song of... 'do I do this and get out of here and get happy or do I wallow in it like I always do?' and it's cool because {{at the end of the}} song I say 'I'm going to let it go', like I am going to be happy.|$|E
