25|$|Following the Rose Revolution, {{a series}} of reforms were {{launched}} to strengthen the country's military and economic capabilities. The new government's efforts to reassert Georgian authority in the southwestern autonomous republic of <b>Ajaria</b> led to a major crisis early in 2004. Success in <b>Ajaria</b> encouraged Saakashvili to intensify his efforts, but without success, in breakaway South Ossetia.|$|E
25|$|This {{relationship}} soon foundered after Saakashvili {{vowed to}} restore central authority over Georgia's separatist regions. In mid-March 2004, a motorcade carrying Saakashvili to planned political events in <b>Ajaria</b> {{ahead of the}} March 28 Georgian legislative elections, was turned back by Ajarian border guards. Abashidze accused Saakashvili of leading a military convoy into the republic {{with the aim of}} overthrowing him, and {{declared a state of emergency}} in <b>Ajaria</b> and a mobilization of armed formations. In response, Saakashvili issued a one-day ultimatum to Abashidze to accept central authority and disband the Ajarian paramilitary forces. The government also closed transit routes into and out of <b>Ajaria.</b>|$|E

The blue background represents the Black Sea, while the seven stars represent <b>Ajaria's</b> two cities (Batumi and Kobuleti) and five districts (Batumi, Kobuleti, Keda, Shuakhevi, Khulo).|$|R
25|$|Adjara under local strongman Aslan Abashidze {{maintained}} {{close ties}} with Russia and allowed a Russian military base to be maintained in Batumi. Upon the election of Mikheil Saakashvili in 2004 tensions rose between Abashidze and the Georgian government, leading to demonstrations in Adjara and the resignation and flight of Abashidze. The region retains autonomy, {{as a sign of}} <b>Ajaria's</b> reconnection with the central Georgian government, the Georgian Constitutional Court was moved from T'bilisi to Batumi.|$|R
25|$|He {{preferred}} to exercise influence from a distance, rather than attempting {{to bid for}} national power, and consistently adopted a policy of backing whoever seemed to offer the best deal for maintaining his rule over <b>Ajaria.</b> He reached an accommodation with President Eduard Shevardnadze, who appeared to have {{preferred to}} live with a semi-independent <b>Ajaria</b> rather than risk another civil war. His relations with Shevardnadze grew frosty {{at the end of the}} 1990s, as he and the government traded accusations of corruption and treason.|$|E
25|$|In {{spite of}} his descent from a renowned Muslim family that {{played a pivotal role}} in {{strengthening}} Georgian and Islamic identities among the Muslims of <b>Ajaria,</b> Aslan Abashidze converted to Christianity.|$|E
25|$|When {{civil war}} broke out between pro- and anti-Gamsakhurdia forces {{in the winter of}} 1991-92 and again in the autumn of 1993, he kept both sides out of <b>Ajaria,</b> {{ensuring}} that the fighting did not spread to the republic.|$|E
25|$|After the Rose Revolution, {{relations}} between the Georgian government and semi-separatist Ajarian leader Aslan Abashidze deteriorated rapidly, with Abashidze rejecting Saakashvili's demands for the writ of the Tbilisi government to run in <b>Ajaria.</b> Both sides mobilised forces in apparent preparations for a military confrontation. Saakashvili's ultimatums and massive street demonstrations forced Abashidze to resign and flee Georgia (2004 Adjara crisis).|$|E
25|$|Ethnic {{violence}} also flared in South Ossetia but {{was eventually}} quelled, although {{at the cost}} of several hundred casualties and 100,000 refugees fleeing into Russian North Ossetia. In south-western Georgia, the autonomous republic of <b>Ajaria</b> came under the control of Aslan Abashidze, who managed to rule his republic from 1991 to 2004 as a personal fiefdom in which the Tbilisi government had little influence.|$|E
25|$|Abashidze {{was born}} into a renowned Muslim Ajarian family, a branch of the Abashidze princely house. His great-uncle Memed Abashidze was a famous writer and member of the Parliament of the Democratic Republic of Georgia between 1918–1921, but was shot on Joseph Stalin's orders in 1937. His father was sent to the Gulag for ten years but survived. Despite a {{difficult}} childhood, during the 1950s Abashidze was able to obtain degrees in history and philosophy at Batumi University and in economics at Tbilisi State University. He worked as a teacher and economist for a period before joining Georgia's regional public service. He was the director of several technical service institutes before being named a regional minister in Batumi, the capital of <b>Ajaria,</b> where he served as Minister of Community Service. He was later appointed the national First Deputy Minister of Community Service and moved to Tbilisi. This was, however, a relatively minor government post.|$|E
25|$|The {{political}} dispute {{has yet to}} be resolved and the South Ossetian separatist authorities govern the region with effective independence from Tbilisi. Although talks have been held periodically between the two sides, little progress was made under the government of Eduard Shevardnadze (1993–2003). His successor Mikheil Saakashvili (elected 2004) made the reassertion of Georgian governmental authority a political priority. Having successfully {{put an end to the}} de facto independence of the southwestern province of <b>Ajaria</b> in May 2004, he pledged to seek a similar solution in South Ossetia. After the 2004 clashes, the Georgian government has intensified its efforts to bring the problem to international attention. On 25 January 2005, President Saakashvili presented a Georgian vision for resolving the South Ossetian conflict at the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe session in Strasbourg. Late in October, the US government and the OSCE expressed their support to the Georgian action plan presented by Prime Minister Zurab Noghaideli at the OSCE Permanent Council at Vienna on 27 October 2005. On 6 December, the OSCE Ministerial Council in Ljubljana adopted a resolution supporting the Georgian peace plan which was subsequently rejected by the South Ossetian de facto authorities.|$|E
500|$|Ketevan Melua, {{known as}} Ketino to her family, {{was born to}} Amiran and Tamara Melua in Kutaisi, Georgia, which was then part of the Soviet Union. She spent her first years with her {{grandparents}} in Tbilisi before moving {{with her parents and}} brother to the town of Batumi, <b>Ajaria,</b> where her father worked as a heart specialist. During this time, Melua sometimes had to carry buckets of water up five flights of stairs to her family's flat and according to her, [...] "Now, when I'm staying in luxurious hotels, I think back to those days".|$|E
2500|$|However, {{unlike the}} rulers of Abkhazia and South Ossetia, he {{did not attempt to}} seek {{independence}} for <b>Ajaria</b> and pursued what can best be described as a policy of [...] "armed autonomy" [...] after the fall of Gamsakhurdia. He effectively turned <b>Ajaria</b> into a [...] "free economic zone" [...] with few restrictions on trade but with the customs duties and revenues going to his government rather than to Tbilisi.|$|E
2500|$|When Georgia regained its {{independence}} in 1991, Abashidze secured his appointment as Chairman of the Supreme Council of the Autonomous Republic of <b>Ajaria.</b> He was also appointed Deputy Chairman of the Parliament of Georgia, a post that he retained in 1990-1992 and 1992-1995. He built an independent power base in <b>Ajaria</b> by steering a course between the Tbilisi {{government and the}} opposition. He established his own army as a counterweight to the armed factions that supported and opposed President Zviad Gamsakhurdia.|$|E
2500|$|The forced {{resignation}} of Shevardnadze in November 2003 – widely dubbed the [...] "Rose Revolution" [...] – created a political crisis between Abashidze {{and the new}} government in Tbilisi. The Georgian opposition had strongly criticised Shevardnadze for failing to resolve the problem of separatism in the country, including {{what they saw as}} the lack of control which Tbilisi had over <b>Ajaria.</b> Not surprisingly, Abashidze saw this as a threat to his position and the continued semi-independence of <b>Ajaria,</b> and denounced the downfall of Shevardnadze as a [...] "coup". He {{declared a state of emergency}} in <b>Ajaria</b> and sought Russian support in the event of an open conflict. However, he failed to attract much support from Russia and came under intense pressure from the United States to compromise. On January 25, 2004 Abashidze met the newly elected President Mikhail Saakashvili in Batumi and declared his intention to work with Saakashvili.|$|E

2500|$|Abashidze {{attracted}} {{some criticism}} for his heavy-handed rule, which was {{often described as}} feudal. He established his own political party in 1992, known variously as the Union of Democratic Revival or the Union for Georgia's Rebirth. In 1998, he was elected President of <b>Ajaria</b> with 93% {{of the vote in}} what Russian observers regarded as a generally free and fair election.|$|E
2500|$|Amid {{high tension}} and {{widespread}} public demonstrations, foreign governments and international organisations appealed {{to both sides}} to exercise restraint and resolve their differences peacefully. Abashidze resigned as leader of <b>Ajaria</b> on May 5, 2004, when Special Forces entered the region and Adjarian paramilitary forces began to swap sides and disarm. The next day, after being granted assurances {{that he would not}} be extradited, Abashidze left for Moscow, without a shot being fired in the region.|$|E
