40|$|Over {{the last}} couple of years, the Commonwealth and the almost all State governments have put their annual budgets and {{departmental}} accounting on an accrual basis. Accrual accounting has, as a consequence, almost entirely replaced traditional 'cash'accounting in the Australian public sector. This is a great step forward. Accrual accounting has great advantages, particularly in the fiscal policy context. Notwithstanding the advantages of accrual accounting, it has to be frankly acknowledged that insofar as the move to accrual accounting was 'sold' on the basis of improved fiscal transparency, it has failed. Ministers, parliamentarians and other lay uses would appear to be very much confused by the new <b>accrual-based</b> <b>Budget</b> Papers. So even are many trained economists. This paper aims to do a number of things. Firstly, it outlines the elements of accrual fiscal measures, including the Commonwealth's new 'fiscal balance' measure. Secondly, it presents a view as to the key benefits of adopting accrual accounting in government. Thirdly, it points to some of the key reasons why the Budget Papers and other government financial reports have become unnecessarily confusing, and suggests some solutions...|$|E
40|$|This study appraises {{the effects}} of {{adoption}} of <b>accrual-based</b> <b>budgeting</b> on transparency and accountability in the Nigerian public sector. A sample of two hundred and ninety-five respondents in the Nigerian public sector, drawn from Cross river, Edo, Kwara and Lagos States of the federation, was used to conduct the study. Two hundred and fifty-eight valid responses representing 87 % of the sample {{were used in the}} analysis. This study employed Karl Pearson coefficient of correlation “r ” statistics for analysis. Findings from this study indicated significant impact of accrual budgeting on transparency and accountability, there is also significant impact of transparency and accountability on economic growth in the Nigerian public sector. This study provides important management information, and can be used in enhancing fiscal transparency and accountability towards good governance in the Nigerian public sector...|$|R
40|$|The Australian {{economy has}} been one of the top {{performers}} among OECD countries since the mid- 1990 s. This economic boom has brought the country's public finance into fiscal surplus since 1998, and general government net financial liabilities approached almost zero in mid- 2000. As with monetary policy, fiscal policy has been formulated and implemented under a medium-term framework based on rules. It is the Charter of Budget Honesty Act (1998) that regulates this framework. The country's sound public finances result not only from the introduction of these rules, but also to a large extent from public expenditure management reforms that have continued since the mid- 1980 s. These reforms, which satisfy both top-down overall expenditure controls and bottom-up micro-level resource allocation and expenditure efficiencies, have extensively altered the conventional budget process. The driving force behind these reforms and the building of more solid public finances originated in concern over external imbalances such as growing current account deficits. It has not been easy to maintain fiscal discipline in the conditions of fiscal surplus that have prevailed since 2000. Faced with an aging population, Australia needs to provide public services such as health care and education more efficiently and effectively while securing the sustainability of public finances. This will require further improvements in public expenditure management, especially in the <b>accrual-based</b> <b>budgeting</b> system introduced at the end of the 1990 s, and more comprehensive assessment of outcomes and outputs in public services. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{reform of}} the public sector has been a {{continuing}} challenge for many governments around the world. In recent years, this reform has become dominated by such terms as ‘new public management’, ‘managerialism’, ‘marketisation’, ‘privatisation’ and ‘commercialisation’. These terms reflect a broadly-based commercial direction that governments started taking in response to reform’s pressures resulting from a perceived crisis of legitimacy, responsiveness, efficiency and accountability in public sectors. A significant feature of this commercial orientation was the adoption of private sector practices and economic market models by governments and public sector organisations. The underlying principle was competition. Governments believed that competition {{plays a major role in}} improving organisational performance, and by subjecting government organisations to relevant forms of competition they would become more cost conscious and results focused, leading to increased efficiency, effectiveness and accountability. In Australia, this commercial orientation has taken momentum with the introduction of the National Competition Policy, which advocated that to become more economic, efficient and effective, public sector organisations should operate on the same commercial principles as the private sector. In this regard, the policy required Australian governments to ensure competitive neutrality by eliminating resource allocation distortions arising out of government ownership, such as tax exemptions, regulatory advantages, discounted interest rates on loans, and cross-subsidization. Accounting has been a key element of this reform process, with a change being required as the traditional cash accounting system was not capable of providing the additional financial information that was needed as a result of the commercial orientation. In this regard, governments in Australia have introduced a commercial accounting system through the adoption of <b>accrual-based</b> accounting, <b>budgeting</b> and reporting practices. At first, the adoption of these practices started in organisations that provide business-like services and are in competition with private providers. At a later stage, Australian governments started also to introduce the practices into their whole public sector. While accrual accounting was believed to be useful in a competitive operating environment, this study aims to analyse its working in the Northern Territory of Australia where competition is very limited. The high cost of production resulting from a relatively small and dispersed population and the lack of economies of scale have resulted in a small private sector in the Territory. This has made the provision of many government services driven more by social imperatives than economic imperatives. In this regard, the study intends to assess the extent that commercial accounting practices have achieved their intended reform objectives. This study highlights a number of findings based on an assessment of the Northern Territory public sector’s responses overall, supported by more detailed analyses of accounting changes in two departments. First, the small private sector in the Northern Territory has not supported the creation of a competitive market for most government goods and services. Second, although accrual accounting has been able to provide full cost information, the heterogeneity of some government services has resulted in a questionable full cost figure. The use of full cost in pricing has not achieved its intended benefits because of the absence of competitive market pressures. Also, the use of cost information in benchmarking has been fragile, mainly because higher costs of services are the result of ‘capital cost disabilities’ that exist in the Northern Territory and may have nothing to do with performance efficiency. Third, this study shows that accrual budgeting has not been used properly and therefore it has failed to achieve its objectives. Finally, while accrual reporting has improved the completeness of the accounting information available, especially at the whole of government level, it has not changed much from cash reporting in discharging accountability at organisational and whole of government levels...|$|R
