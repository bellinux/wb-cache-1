40|$|This {{study used}} actarit (ACT), an {{antirheumatic}} drug, {{to examine the}} molecular interaction of <b>ACT</b> <b>and</b> γ-CD in a solid state {{as a result of}} cogrinding or freeze-drying and it assessed the dissolution of ACT. Differential scanning calorimetry revealed that coground <b>ACT</b> <b>and</b> γ-CD at molar ratios of 1 : 2 and 1 : 3 <b>and</b> freeze-dried <b>ACT</b> <b>and</b> γ-CD at molar ratios of 1 : 1 and 1 : 2 lacked an endothermic peak due to melting of ACT crystals. Thus, coground <b>ACT</b> <b>and</b> γ-CD at a molar ratio of 1 : 2 had molecular interaction, as did freeze-dried <b>ACT</b> <b>and</b> γ-CD at a molar ratio of 1 : 1. Powder x-ray diffraction revealed that coground <b>and</b> humidified <b>ACT</b> <b>and</b> γ-CD at a molar ratio of 1 : 2 produced a characteristic diffraction peak at 2 θ = 15. 2 ° and 16. 5 ° due to the cage structure of γ-CD. In addition, freeze-dried <b>ACT</b> <b>and</b> γ-CD at a molar ratio of 1 : 1 that had been humidified produced a diffraction peak at 2 θ = 6. 0 ° and 15. 9 ° characteristic of a hexagonal structure with head-to-head channels due to γ-CD. Assessment of dissolution revealed that ground mixtures (GMs) and freeze-dried mixtures had improved dissolution of ACT compared to ACT, ground <b>ACT</b> alone, <b>and</b> physical mixtures. The mechanism for this is presumably the result of molecular interaction in a solid state or molecular interaction in an aqueous solution. 1 H– 1 H NOESY NMR spectra suggested that in a GM of <b>ACT</b> <b>and</b> γ-CD the benzene ring and methyl group of ACT partially enter the CD cavity. In addition, spectra for freeze-dried <b>ACT</b> <b>and</b> γ-CD suggested that protons of the methylene group of <b>ACT</b> <b>and</b> the benzene ring of ACT partially enter the CD cavity. These findings indicate that <b>ACT</b> <b>and</b> γ-CD inclusion complexes feature different forms of inclusion depending on how they are prepared, e. g., cogrinding or freeze-drying. Findings also indicated that selection of a method of preparation may {{play a major role in}} drug development...|$|R

5|$|Since the {{original}} Rocky Mountains Park Act, subsequent <b>acts</b> <b>and</b> policies placed {{greater emphasis on}} conservation. With public sentiment tending towards environmentalism, Parks Canada issued major new policy in 1979, which emphasized conservation. The National Parks Act was amended in 1988, which made preserving ecological integrity the first priority in all park management decisions. The act also required each park to produce a management plan, with greater public participation.|$|E

5|$|Traditionally, {{editors of}} Shakespeare's plays have divided them into five acts. None {{of the early}} texts of Hamlet, however, were {{arranged}} this way, and the play's division into <b>acts</b> <b>and</b> scenes derives from a 1676 quarto. Modern editors generally follow this traditional division, but consider it unsatisfactory; for example, after Hamlet drags Polonius's body out of Gertrude's bedchamber, there is an act-break after which the action appears to continue uninterrupted.|$|E

5|$|After renovation, {{owing to}} du Maurier's sponsorship, the {{facility}} {{was named the}} Stanley Theatre du Maurier Stage, {{taken over by the}} Arts Club Theatre Company and later became their main stage. This venue has allowed the Arts Club to put on new kinds of shows, such as large musicals, classics and productions from around the world. The first production was Swing!, which opened on October 28, 1998 and had a successful run, followed by Hamlet. In addition to showing Arts Club productions, the theatre is rented out for other purposes, including business and educational presentations, and has been used for comedy <b>acts</b> <b>and</b> concerts, such as Lorne Elliott, Francis Cabrel, and RyanDan.|$|E
5|$|Also in the 1878 session, tax {{assessments}} for railroad property {{were raised}} to match {{those of other}} property. Agrarian interests were pleased that the legal interest rate was again lowered, now reaching the six percent they had proposed in the previous session. Non-economic reforms included the separation of Kentucky Agricultural and Mechanical College (later the University of Kentucky) from Kentucky University (later Transylvania University) {{and the establishment of}} a state board of health.
