40|$|The pyrolytic {{kinetics}} of Jerusalem artichoke stalk, cornstalk, and sawdust (the {{latter two}} served as control) were investigated using a thermogravimetric analysis method under an inert atmosphere at heating rates of 5, 10, 20, and 30 degrees C/min from 50 to 800 degrees C. For Jerusalem <b>artichoke</b> <b>stalk,</b> starting <b>with</b> the dehydration step between 30 and 150 degrees C, the main thermal decomposition process showed two distinct degradation zones, {{corresponding to the}} devolatilization step between 200 and 400 degrees C and the combustion step between 400 and 600 degrees C. Kinetic expressions for the degradation rate in devolatilization and combustion steps have been obtained for Jerusalem <b>artichoke</b> <b>stalk</b> <b>with</b> Popescu, Flynn-Wall-Ozawa, and Kissinger-Akahira-Sunose methods. The {{results showed that the}} model agreed well with the experimental data and provided useful information for the design of a pyrolytic processing system using Jerusalem artichoke stalk as feedstock to produce bio-fuel.
