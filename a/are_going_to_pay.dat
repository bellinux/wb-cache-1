2500|$|Moscoe stood down as TTC chair {{following}} the 2006 election, and {{was selected as}} chair of Toronto's licensing and standards committee. He {{is also a member}} of David Miller's executive committee [...] Soon after the swearing-in ceremony in December 2006, Moscoe distributed a list of his priorities to journalists, which was highlighted by a plan to license Toronto's landlords. The plan calls for landlords to pay a high per-unit fee if their properties are run down, and a low fee if the buildings are in good shape.

[...] "The emphasis in whatever scheme we establish must be making the bad landlords pay". He conducted a media tour of the worst-kept buildings in Toronto in early 2007.|$|E
2500|$|Among {{the opponents}} of Batista, many wanted to {{accommodate}} the United States. However, Castro belonged to a faction which opposed U.S. influence. Castro did not forgive the U.S. supply of arms to Batista during the revolution. On 5 June 1958, {{at the height of}} the revolution, he had written: [...] "The Americans <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> dearly for what they are doing. When the war is over, I'll start a much longer and bigger war of my own: the war I’m going to fight against them. That will be my true destiny". (The United States had stopped supplies to Batista in March 1958, but left its Military Advisory Group in Cuba). Thus, Castro had no intention to bow to the United States. [...] "Even though he did not have a clear blueprint of the Cuba he wanted to create, Castro dreamed of a sweeping revolution that would uproot his country's oppressive socioeconomic structure and of a Cuba that would be free of the United States".|$|E
