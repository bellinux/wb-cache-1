40|$|INTRODUCTION Despite the {{multitude}} of systems that {{have been reported in}} the literature over 30 years, and despite the number of evaluations showing that knowledgebased systems (KBSs) ought to be useful [1 - 4], a tour of the average hospital would convince one that these systems have little use in clinical care. Basic KBS research may reduce this discrepancy, but it will not eliminate it. Part of the problem lies not within the KBS itself, but in the link between the KBS and the clinical environment [5, 6]. The routine availability of more and more clinical data in coded electronic form is reducing one of the hurdles to using KBSs: the manual entry (and re-entry) of clinical data. For example, the creators of QMR reported that one of the factors discouraging the use of QMR is the manual entry of data [7]. To reap this benefit of availability, however, a major effort is required to map conceptual entities in the KBS to <b>actual</b> <b>entries</b> in the clinical database. At Columbia-Presbyter...|$|R

40|$|In a brain network, {{weak and}} nonsignificant edge weights between nodes signal {{spurious}} connections {{and are often}} thresh-olded out of the network. The traditional practice of thresholding edge weights at an arbitrary value can be problematic. Network filtration provides an alternative by summarizing {{the changes in the}} network topology with respect to a broad range of thresholds. A well established network filtration approach depends on the graphical-LASSO (least absolute shrinkage and selection operator) model, where a sequence of binary networks are obtained based on non-zero sparse inverse covariance (IC) estimates of partial correlations at a range of sparsity parameters. The limitation of the graphical-LASSO network model is that it relies on the structural information rather than <b>actual</b> <b>entries</b> of the sparse IC matrices and therefore can only yield approximate dynamic topological changes in the network. In the current study, we propose a new network filtration approach based on least angle regression (LARS) that yields exact filtration values at which network topology changes, and apply it to study brain connectivity in response to emotional stimuli across different age groups via electroencephalographic (EEG) data...|$|R

5000|$|A [...]ZIP file is {{correctly}} {{identified by}} the presence of an end of central directory record which is located {{at the end of the}} archive structure in order to allow the easy appending of new files. If the end of central directory record indicates a non-empty archive, the name of each file or directory within the archive should be specified in a central directory entry, along with other metadata about the entry, and an offset into the [...]ZIP file, pointing to the <b>actual</b> <b>entry</b> data. This allows a file listing of the archive to be performed relatively quickly, as the entire archive does not have to be read to see the list of files. The entries within the [...]ZIP file also include this information, for redundancy, in a local file header. Because zip files may be appended to, only files specified in the central directory at the end of the file are valid.

The illustration accompanying the rust monster's <b>actual</b> <b>entry</b> shows a round tick-like creature—albeit 3 feet high and 5 feet long—with a bony shell of armor, four mammal-like legs, two long antennae and a scaly prehensile tail ending in {{what appears to be}} a propeller. In this edition, the rust monster consumed all metal, although it still preferred ferrous metals over copper, gold or platinum. It had no bite, tail or claw attack, but the rust monster could smell metal from 90 feet away, and with an increase to its already rapid speed—it now moved six times faster than the average character—it would rapidly close and attempt to touch its antennae to metal, thereby causing the object to instantly corrode. (Magical weapons had a small chance to escape this fate.) In order to escape, fleeing adventurers could discard pieces of metal in the hope that the pursuing rust monster would stop for a few seconds to devour them. David M. Ewalt, in his book Of Dice and Men, discussed several monsters {{appearing in the}} original Monster Manual, warning [...] "woe unto the armor-wearing adventurer who encounters a rust monster deep in some dark subterranean passage".|$|E

The clergy of the parish offered half their stipends to pay for architects, artists, stained glass artisans, masons, carvers, craftsman and labourers and other expenses.Several factors, including royal resistance to the temporary relocation of the royal chapel delayed the start of construction until 1434.

40|$|Dictionaries employ usage {{labels to}} warn the user of {{restrictions}} {{on the use of}} a word. Register labels are just one of several types of usage labels. Differentiating between various usages has been a practice since the very beginnings of monolingual French and English lexicography in the seventeenth century. However, the advent of sociolinguistics {{in the latter half of}} this century, and the concept of language varieties, which has emerged from sociolinguistic studies, has had an impact on lexicography. In theory, dictionaries now generally recognize that register, or use-related varieties of language (i. e. tied to the situation in which the speaker uses language), is not a question of right and wrong, only one of appropriateness. In practice, however, there are discrepancies from dictionary to dictionary in the treatment of register and register labeling. An in-depth look at the front matter or a few dictionaries, monolingual and bilingual, reveals both the lack of a clear notion of register in lexicography and inadequate explanation of the basis on which words are labeled for register. An extensive examination of the <b>actual</b> <b>entries</b> found within these dictionaries, however, reveals a certain common thread in register labeling since some labels can be found in all dictionaries, and certain words are always labeled. Although some consistency in register labeling does exist, marking words for register is always problematic since it is subjective. An examination of a few entries prepared at the Bilingual Canadian Dictionary project shows the difficulty of labeling register consistently even when specific guidelines are proposed to lexicographers. The usefulness of consulting on-line corpora as a more objective basis for labeling is examined, and certain recommendations are made to improve the consistency of register labeling in bilingual lexicography in general, and especially in the Bilingual Canadian Dictionary.
