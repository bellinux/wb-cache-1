5|$|The lectotype {{chosen for}} the species came from Marstrand, Sweden, but it is assumed to have been lost. In 1814, writing for The Edinburgh Encyclopaedia, William Elford Leach erected a new genus, Carcinus to hold this species alone (making it the type species of the genus, by monotypy). In 1847, Nardo {{described}} <b>a</b> <b>distinct</b> subspecies occurring in the Mediterranean Sea, which is now recognised as <b>a</b> <b>distinct</b> species, Carcinus aestuarii.|$|E

5|$|A related {{study also}} noted a locking {{mechanism}} {{in the lower}} jaw shared between the two genera. In a separate paper, Currie noted the possibility that Alioramus might represent a juvenile Tarbosaurus, but stated that the much higher tooth count and more prominent nasal crests in Alioramus suggest it is <b>a</b> <b>distinct</b> genus. Similarly, Currie uses the high tooth count of Nanotyrannus {{to suggest that it}} may be <b>a</b> <b>distinct</b> genus, rather than a juvenile Tyrannosaurus as most other experts believe. However, the discovery and description of Qianzhousaurus reveals that Alioramus is not a close relation to Tarbosaurus, instead belonging to a newly described family of tyrannosaurids; the Alioramini. Qianzhousaurus further reveals that similar long-snouted tyrannosaurids were widely distributed throughout Asia and would have shared the same environment while avoiding competition with larger and more robust tyrannosaurines by hunting different prey.|$|E
5|$|Amanita regalis {{was first}} {{described}} as Agaricus muscarius β regalis by Elias Magnus Fries in his Systema Mycologicum, published in 1821. In 1887, Pier Andrea Saccardo treated it as {{a variety of}} Amanitamuscaria. Edmund Michael, in 1903, became the first to consider it <b>a</b> <b>distinct</b> species. In 1941, Jean-Edouard Gilbert suggested a complete reorganization of the genus Amanita in his world monograph of the genus, and moved it to Amanitaria as A.muscaria var. regalis. In his original (1949) version of Agaricales in Modern Taxonomy, Rolf Singer considered it a subspecies of A.muscaria, but noted {{that it may be}} regarded as a separate species; in the fourth edition (1986), he listed it as <b>a</b> <b>distinct</b> species. A.regalis is classified in a section of Amanita within the genus, a grouping of related Amanitas that have a ring on the stem (or remnants thereof), and a bulb at the base of it. More recently, a Japanese group studied the biogeography of A.muscaria and related species, and, using molecular phylogenetic analysis, concluded that the taxon should be considered a grouping of A.muscaria, rather than <b>a</b> <b>distinct</b> species. However, as of 2012, both Index Fungorum and MycoBank list the taxon as Amanita regalis.|$|E
