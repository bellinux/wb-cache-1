5|$|On May 23, 1913, a {{grand jury}} convened to hear {{evidence}} for <b>an</b> <b>indictment</b> against Leo Frank {{for the murder of}} Mary Phagan. The prosecutor, Hugh Dorsey, presented only enough information to obtain the indictment, assuring the jury that additional information would be provided during the trial. The next day, May 24, the jury voted for <b>an</b> <b>indictment.</b> Meanwhile, Frank's legal team suggested to the media that Jim Conley was the actual killer, and put pressure on another grand jury to indict him. The jury foreman, on his own authority, convened the jury on July 21; on Dorsey's advice, they decided not to indict Conley.|$|E
50|$|Federal {{prosecutors}} {{announced plans}} to file <b>a</b> superseding <b>indictment</b> {{by the end of}} August. According to a representative of the U.S. District Court, <b>a</b> superseding <b>indictment</b> could mean new charges and possibly new defendants in the case. ESPN legal analyst Lester Munson said given the reputation of Richmond's federal prosecutors, he anticipates that Vick will face more federal charges. Munson also believes that the threat of <b>a</b> superseding <b>indictment</b> is intended to make the defendants plead guilty and cooperate with the government.|$|R

5|$|After the lynching, {{friends and}} {{relatives}} of the Driscolls attempted to strike back at the Regulators.

The Regulators responded by obtaining their own Bills of Indictment against every person who had stood by and witnessed the lynching. With 125 people under indictment no witnesses could be found, and no jury could be formed, so the judge cleared the charges.|$|E

She spoke in public and testified before a grand jury about her experience, and the media coverage of her testimony made national and international news. The grand jury declined to make <b>an</b> <b>indictment</b> in the case, but Dworkin's testimony contributed to public outrage over the mistreatment of inmates. The prison was closed seven years later.|$|E

He later claimed to have accepted an offered cigarette from a fan in Japan during a party back in May, but after realizing it was not a normal cigarette, threw it away. Because he was not charged, he did not lose any endorsers and made his first public appearance after the scandal at the 2011 MTV EMAs with his group.|$|E
5|$|I think {{everyone}} who disses the Columbine RPG is gutless.

Super Columbine Massacre RPG is riddled with design flaws and has mediocre graphics by 1995, the maker of the game admits this, but it regardless {{is a work of}} art. It puts you in the mindset of the killers and provides a very clear suggestion of why they did what they did; they were enacting an ideological demonstration through a terrorist act, and the game shines light on this as <b>an</b> <b>indictment</b> of the American dream and way of life painfully close to the main nerve.|$|E
5|$|In 2010, the Serbian War Crimes Prosecutor's Office {{investigated}} Borislav Peleviƒá, {{a former}} SDG member {{and a member}} of the Serbian National Assembly.

Goluboviƒá was charged with <b>an</b> <b>indictment</b> listing the names of 78 victims. Clint Williamson, the lead prosecutor, said that other members of the SDG could not be identified because their faces had been covered with masks. As of October 2014, closing arguments had been concluded in the trial of Karad≈æiƒá, the former President of Republika Srpska, for the massacre, and other crimes against humanity committed in Bijeljina, among other areas, as well as for the genocide at Srebrenica.
