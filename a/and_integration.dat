40|$|The {{evaluation}} of <b>integration</b> <b>and</b> civic <b>integration</b> policies {{is a priority}} in the policy discourse of both the EU as Flanders, {{but at the same}} time the Flemish evaluation practice in the field of <b>integration</b> <b>and</b> civic <b>integration</b> displays a number of shortcomings. For instance, Flanders has not defined any criteria to evaluate policy performance, there is little information available about the needs of the policies’ target group and the dialogue among the different studies evaluating Flemish civic integration policies is scarce. In this context, HIVA developed an evaluation framework that may serve as a basis for the {{evaluation of}} both <b>integration</b> <b>and</b> civic <b>integration</b> policies. The framework is part of the work package 'Efficiency and effectiveness' of the Policy Research Centre on Integration. The function of the evaluation framework is threefold: (1) It analyses the policy processes of <b>integration</b> <b>and</b> civic <b>integration,</b> <b>and</b> reformulates them in terms of evaluable elements such as policy needs, goals, inputs, outputs and effects. (2) It defines criteria to evaluate those policy processes: effectiveness, efficiency and relevance are the most important among them. (3) It purports a clear vision on causality, by which the consequences of the <b>integration</b> <b>and</b> civic <b>integration</b> policy can be traced. The framework is presented in a short report, that also contains information about evaluation frameworks in general and examples of policy frameworks from abroad, within the domain of <b>integration</b> <b>and</b> civic <b>integration.</b> nrpages: 54 status: publishe...|$|R

40|$|The {{complexity}} of semiconductor manufacturing equipment is growing. This growth {{results in a}} complexity increase of the <b>integration</b> <b>and</b> test phase of these systems.

5|$|After Van Leer's death, Paul Weber {{served as}} acting {{president}} from January 1956 to August 1957, while {{still holding the}} title of Dean of Faculties; {{it was difficult to}} find a permanent replacement due to discriminatory state laws and the looming issue of integration, along with a salary gap between Georgia Tech and comparable institutions. Weber's short tenure as acting president saw significantly increased enrollment standards, efforts by the Georgia Tech Foundation to increase faculty salaries, and further campus expansion including the Alexander Memorial Coliseum, which was completed and dedicated on October 27, 1956. Weber left larger organizational changes <b>and</b> <b>integration</b> for his eventual successor. After the selection of a replacement in the University of Toledo's Dean of Engineering, Edwin D.

The engines were test fired at the factory before being shipped to the Isle of Wight, where they were integrated into the rocket and the first stage engines were fired again at High Down. Bristol Aerojet produced the third stage in Somerset, while the Explosives Research and Development Establishment produced its solid propellant in Waltham Abbey, Essex.
