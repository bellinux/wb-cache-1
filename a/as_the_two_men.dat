Even in Euboea, Licario's major gain and personal fief, the Lombard barons managed to complete their reconquest of the entire island by 1296. Nevertheless, Licario proved {{one of the most}} successful military leaders in Michael VIII's employ, and his victories greatly enhanced the emperor's own standing and prestige amongst the Latins. The historian Deno John Geanakoplos ranks him, along with Michael's brother John Palaiologos, <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>men</b> who caused the most damage to the Latin rulers of Greece.|$|E
5|$|According to his biographer, John M. Taylor, Seward {{picked a}} good time to absent himself from electoral politics, as the Whig Party was in turmoil. President Tyler, a former Democrat, and Senator Clay each claimed {{leadership}} of the Whig Party and, <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>men</b> differed over such issues as whether to re-establish the Bank of the United States, party support was divided. The abolitionist movement attracted those {{who did not want to}} be part of a party led by slavery-supporting southerners. In 1844, Seward was asked to run for president by members of the Liberty Party; he declined and reluctantly supported the Whig nominee, Clay. The Kentuckian was defeated by Democrat James K. Polk. The major event of Polk's administration was the Mexican–American War; Seward did not support this, feeling that the price in blood was not worth the increase in territory, especially as southerners were promoting this acquisition to expand territory for slavery.|$|E
5|$|Formal {{nominations}} {{began the}} following day. Hardin {{felt as though}} he had been cheated and withdrew his candidacy, although some loyal delegates continued to vote for him. Delegate John Stockdale Rhea nominated Stone. Stone believed that his agreement with Goebel meant, with Hardin's withdrawal, Goebel would instruct his delegates to vote for Stone, maintaining a unified party. That understanding vanished when another delegate nominated Goebel. Stone was further incensed when all of the Louisville delegation voted for Goebel instead of being split between Stone and Goebel, <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>men</b> had previously agreed. In retaliation, some Stone supporters began to back Hardin. Seeing the breakdown of the Stone-Goebel alliance, Hardin reversed his withdrawal. After numerous ballots, the convention was deadlocked on the night of June 24 with each candidate receiving about one-third of the votes. No deliberations were held on Sunday, June 25, and when the delegates reconvened on Monday, June 26, the hall was filled with police per Redwine's request. Rhea requested that the police be removed to prevent intimidation, but Redwine ruled the motion out of order. Another delegate appealed Redwine's decision, and, in violation of parliamentary rule, Redwine ruled the appeal out of order. Angered by Redwine's obviously biased rulings, delegates for Stone and Hardin then began trying to disrupt the convention by blowing horns, singing, yelling, and standing on chairs. Although voting was attempted, many delegates abstained because they were unable to hear and understand what was going on. When the voting—such as it was—ended, the chair announced that Goebel had a majority of the votes cast, but Goebel sent word to Redwine that he would only accept the nomination if he received an absolute majority of the delegates. Further attempts to vote were likewise disrupted, and the meeting adjourned for the day.|$|E

25|$|On December 10, 1969, Emile Derlin Zinsou {{was overthrown}} by Maurice Kouandété, who had {{installed}} him as {{president in the}} first place. The military, however, refused to recognize Kouandété, and <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>men</b> could not reach agreement, a Military Directorate was established with Paul Emile de Souza as its chairman. An election was held on March 28, 1970 to determine the true president. On this occasion, the triumvirate was allowed to campaign, {{and they did not}} miss the chance. Intimidation and bribery were commonplace, and the electoral campaign saw the comeback of regional loyalties. It was also marked by a series of violent outbursts; invalidated reports state that six people were killed or wounded at incidents in Parakou {{on the eve of the}} elections.

25|$|Donovan openly {{believed}} {{during this}} time that a second major European war was inevitable. His foreign experience and realism earned him the friendship of President Franklin D. Roosevelt, notwithstanding their extreme differences in domestic policy {{and despite the fact}} that Donovan, during the 1932 election campaign, had harshly criticized Roosevelt's record as Governor of New York. The two men were from opposing political parties, but were similar in personality. Roosevelt respected Donovan's experience, felt that Hoover had done Donovan wrong on the Attorney General appointment, and believed that if Donovan had been a Democrat he could have been elected President. Also, Donovan's national profile had risen considerably thanks to the 1940 Warner Brothers film The Fighting 69th, in which Pat O'Brien played Father Duffy and George Brent played Donovan, and Roosevelt recognized a useful opportunity to exploit Donovan's newfound popularity. <b>As</b> <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>men</b> began exchanging notes about developments abroad, Roosevelt recognized that Donovan could be an important ally and adviser.|$|E
25|$|Tyson {{attacked}} Spinks {{from the}} opening bell, landing a solid left hook in the first ten seconds and forcing Spinks to cover up. Spinks clinched and was driven back to the ropes by another Tyson attack. He moved off the ropes but Tyson trapped him again; a left uppercut and a right hand to the body forced Spinks to take a knee after a minute, which marked the second time Spinks had been knocked down in his professional career since Braxton during the eighth round of their 1983 encounter. Spinks took a count of four before rising. <b>As</b> <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>men</b> moved towards each other Tyson turned away from a Spinks right hand and responded with a left-right combination to the head which put Spinks down again. This time {{he was unable to}} rise and referee Frank Cappuccino counted him out. The fight was over after 91 seconds, presently the sixth shortest heavyweight title fight in history. Just ten punches were landed, eight by Tyson, two by Spinks. The round was named round of the year for 1988 by Ring Magazine.|$|E

25|$|At the {{outbreak}} of the Crimean War, Lord Lucan applied for a post and was made commander of the Cavalry Division. His brother-in-law, the 7th Earl of Cardigan, was one of his subordinates, commanding the Light Brigade – an unfortunate choice <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>men</b> heartily detested each other. Promoted to brevet lieutenant general on 18 August 1854, he was present at the Battle of Alma in September 1854 but, on the orders of the Army commander, Lord Raglan, he held his division in reserve. At the Battle of Balaclava in October 1854, Lucan received an order from Raglan and in turn ordered Cardigan to lead the Charge of the Light Brigade, resulting in heavy British casualties without significant gains. As Lucan brought the Heavy Brigade forward in support, he was lightly wounded in the leg. Raglan blamed Lucan for the loss ("You have lost the light brigade"), and censured him in despatches. Although Lucan complained against this censure, as the relationship between the army commander and the cavalry commander had clearly broken down, he was recalled to England, where he returned at the beginning of March 1855.|$|E

He sent runners to all the bands to report back on any conduct by the Ojibwa that could construed as grounds for removal. Nothing was reported. But, President Zachary Taylor signed the removal order on February 6, 1850, under corrupt circumstances, claiming to be protecting the Ojibwa from [...] "injurious" [...] whites. [...] The Wisconsin legislature resisted the order and put aside plans for removal.

500|$|The {{situation}} caused two marshals {{from the}} pit {{wall on the}} opposite side of the track to intervene. The first marshal to cross the track was a 25-year-old panel beater named William (Bill). The second was 19-year-old Frederik [...] "Frikkie" [...] Jansen van Vuuren, who was carrying a [...] fire extinguisher. George Witt, the chief pit marshal for the race, said that the policy of the circuit was that in cases of fire, two marshals must attend and a further two act as back-up in case the first pair's extinguishers were not effective enough. Witt also recalled that both marshals crossed the track without prior permission. The former narrowly made it across the track, but the latter did not. <b>As</b> <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>men</b> started to run across the track, the cars driven by Hans-Joachim Stuck and Pryce came over the brow of a rise in the track.|$|E

As an unpaid deputy marshal for Virgil, Wyatt habitually carried a pistol in his waistband, as was the custom of that time. Witnesses reported that Wyatt drew his revolver from his coat pocket and pistol whipped Tom McLaury with it twice, leaving him prostrate and bleeding on the street. Saloon-keeper Andrew Mehan testified at the Spicer hearing afterward that he saw McLaury deposit a revolver at the Capital Saloon sometime between 1–2:00 pm, after the confrontation with Wyatt, which Mehan also witnessed.|$|E

The young people have never met, being away at school while the old folks have been cementing their friendship. <b>As</b> <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>men</b> own adjoining places, {{they believe that the}} best thing for the younger people to do is to get married. So they try to bring this about. Gladys Glade and Charlie Sears meet on the train while they are returning home and start a flirtation. Perhaps they would have married in the end, if the old folks hadn't 'butted in.' As it is, they lose all interest in each other. Then the fathers try another tack. They decide to be bitter enemies in public, hoping the opposition will bring the children together.

That night, Lesnar and McMahon were to face each other in a steel cage match with Angle as the special guest referee as per McMahon's orders on the previous week's program. During the match, Lesnar had passed out due to a staged backstage incident and McMahon was set to pin him, but Angle refused to allow McMahon to win that way. <b>As</b> <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>men</b> began to argue, Lesnar attacked Angle with an F-5 and kept attacking Angle while McMahon watched and celebrated with him afterwards, turning back into a villain in the process.

After that, Lesnar would cement his villainous turn by brutalizing smaller wrestlers and attacking his rivals on a more consistent basis. He returned to performing the F-5 into the ringpost, as he did to Spanky and Gowen, and interfered in Angle's matches on two separate occasions.
