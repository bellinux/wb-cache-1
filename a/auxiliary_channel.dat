30|$|The {{foremost}} {{theory of}} STAP is {{to adjust the}} space-time filter weights to maximize output signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) adaptively with DOF as less as possible. Therefore, the dimensionality reduction and rank reduction techniques are explored extensively and addressed in the literature. When it comes to reduced-dimension (RD) STAP, some typical suboptimal approaches like the factor approach [7], the joint domain localized (JDL) [8], and the space-time multiple-beam (STMB) [9] have been proposed, which employ a fixed dimension reducing transformation prior to the processing. Lately, a modified RD STAP was proposed by selecting <b>auxiliary</b> <b>channels</b> near the clutter ridge [10]. However, none of the traditional RD STAP can select <b>auxiliary</b> <b>channels</b> adaptively. A multistage multiple-beam (MSMB) technique is proposed in [11, 12], {{based on the principle}} of selecting <b>auxiliary</b> <b>channels</b> to cancel the interference components in the main channel clearly.

40|$|Abstract — Authenticating {{spontaneous}} {{interactions between}} devices and users is challenging for several reasons: the wireless (and therefore invisible) nature of device communication, the heterogeneous nature of devices {{and lack of}} appropriate user interfaces in mobile devices, and the requirement for unobtrusive user interaction. The most promising approach that has been proposed in literature involves the exploitation of so-called <b>auxiliary</b> <b>channels</b> for authentication {{to bridge the gap}} between usability and security. This concept has spawned the independent development of various authentication methods and research prototypes, that, unfortunately, remain hard to compare and interchange and are rarely available to potential application developers. We present a novel, unified cryptographic authentication protocol framework (UACAP) to unify these approaches on using <b>auxiliary</b> <b>channels</b> and analyze its security properties. This protocol and a selection of <b>auxiliary</b> <b>channels</b> aimed at authentication of mobile devices has been implemented and released in an open source ubiquitous authentication toolkit (OpenUAT).

40|$|The {{sensitivity}} of searches for astrophysical transients in {{data from the}} Laser Interferometer Gravitational-wave Observatory (LIGO) is generally limited {{by the presence of}} transient, non-Gaussian noise artifacts, which occur at a high enough rate such that accidental coincidence across multiple detectors is non-negligible. These “glitches” can easily be mistaken for transient gravitational-wave signals, and their robust identification and removal will help any search for astrophysical gravitational waves. We apply machine-learning algorithms (MLAs) to the problem, using data from <b>auxiliary</b> <b>channels</b> within the LIGO detectors that monitor degrees of freedom unaffected by astrophysical signals. Noise sources may produce artifacts in these <b>auxiliary</b> <b>channels</b> as well as the gravitational-wave channel. The number of auxiliary-channel parameters describing these disturbances may also be extremely large; high dimensionality is an area where MLAs are particularly well suited. We demonstrate the feasibility and applicability of three different MLAs: artificial neural networks, support vector machines, and random forests. These classifiers identify and remove a substantial fraction of the glitches present in two different data sets: four weeks of LIGO’s fourth science run and one week of LIGO’s sixth science run. We observe that all three algorithms agree on which events are glitches to within 10 % for the sixth-science-run data, and support this by showing that the different optimization criteria used by each classifier generate the same decision surface, based on a likelihood-ratio statistic. Furthermore, we find that all classifiers obtain similar performance to the benchmark algorithm, the ordered veto list, which is optimized to detect pairwise correlations between transients in LIGO <b>auxiliary</b> <b>channels</b> and glitches in the gravitational-wave data. This suggests that most of the useful information currently extracted from the <b>auxiliary</b> <b>channels</b> is already described by this model. Future performance gains are thus likely to involve additional sources of information, rather than improvements in the classification algorithms themselves. We discuss several plausible sources of such new information as well as the ways of propagating it through the classifiers into gravitational-wave searches. National Science Foundation (U. S.)
