25|$|Inevitable {{tensions}} arose, however, as {{the players}} were receiving only a 30 shillings ($3) per week, yet were training to a professional standard. Adding to the players' dissatisfaction was the increased money coming into the game – Carlton's revenue had doubled {{since the time of}} Worrall's appointment. Worrall's sometimes brusque <b>approach</b> <b>to</b> <b>dealing</b> <b>with</b> individuals and his puritanical attitude to alcohol and other distractions didn't help the situation. Early in 1909, Carlton's players revolted over money and Worrall's disciplinary demands, and some refused to take the field in the opening round. The matter rumbled on for a number of weeks, {{with a small group of}} players insisting on Worrall's resignation, which was duly given mid-season. He continued on as secretary, but resigned that position at the end of the season when the disharmony was still not repaired. A number of players who supported the ex-coach left Princes Park in sympathy.|$|E
25|$|During {{the period}} in which these polls took place, Ban made major speeches to the Asia Society and the Council on Foreign Relations in New York City. To be confirmed, Ban needed not only to win the support of the {{diplomatic}} community, but also to be able to avoid a veto from any of the five permanent members of the council: People's Republic of China, France, Russia, the United Kingdom, and the United States. Ban was popular in Washington for having pushed to send South Korean troops to Iraq, and had the support of the Bush administration as he pursued the position. But Ban also opposed several U.S. positions: he expressed his support for the International Criminal Court and favoured an entirely non-confrontational <b>approach</b> <b>to</b> <b>dealing</b> <b>with</b> North Korea. Ban said during his campaign {{that he would like to}} visit North Korea in person to meet with Kim Jong-il directly. Ban was viewed as a stark contrast from Kofi Annan, who was considered charismatic, but perceived as a weak manager because of problems surrounding the UN's oil-for-food program in Iraq.|$|E
500|$|According to {{underground}} [...] historian Patrick Rosenkranz, Green {{represents a}} break with past convention by being [...] "the first to openly render his personal demons and emotional conflicts {{within the confines of}} a comic".

His first major problem in this sphere was in 1961 when on the orders of the Soviet leader, Nikita Khrushchev, the Berlin Wall was erected to stop East Germans escaping to West Germany via West Berlin. Home wrote to his American counterpart, Dean Rusk, [...] "The prevention of East Berliners getting into West Berlin {{has never been a}} casus belli for us. We are concerned with Western access to Berlin {{and that is what we}} must maintain." [...] The governments of West Germany, Britain and the US quickly reached agreement on their joint negotiating position; it remained to persuade President de Gaulle of France to align himself with the allies. During their discussions Macmillan commented that de Gaulle showed [...] "all the rigidity of a poker without its occasional warmth". An agreement was reached, and the allies tacitly recognised that the wall was going to remain in place. The Soviets for their part did not seek to cut off allied access to West Berlin through East German territory.|$|E

However, relations soured over Sri Lanka's turn away from socialism under J. R. Jayewardene, whom Gandhi despised as a [...] "western puppet." [...] India under Gandhi was alleged to have supported LTTE militants in the 1980s to put pressure on Jayewardene to abide by Indian interests. Nevertheless, Gandhi rejected demands to invade Sri Lanka in the aftermath of Black July 1983, an anti-Tamil pogrom carried out by Sinhalese mobs.

[...] That is, this approach starts by surveying the poor in the countries in question, and then tries to directly aid individuals, rather than governments. Local markets are a key incentive structure. The primary example is of mosquito nets in Malawi. In this example, an NGO sells mosquito nets to rich Malawians, and uses the profits to subsidize cheap sales to the impoverished. Hospital nurses are used as middle-women, profiting a few cents on every net sold to a patient. This incentive structure has seen the usage of nets in Malawi spike over 40% in less than 7 years.|$|E

With its promises to cure schizophrenia, depression and Post Traumatic Stress Disorder, and its dismissal of psychiatric illnesses as psychosomatic, NLP shares similarities with Scientology and the Citizens Commission on Human Rights (CCHR)." [...] A systematic review of experimental studies by Sturt et al (2012) concluded that [...] "there is little evidence that NLP interventions improve health-related outcomes." [...] In his review of NLP, Stephen Briers writes, [...] "NLP is not really a cohesive therapy but a ragbag of different techniques without a particularly clear theoretical basis... evidence base is virtually non-existent." [...] Eisner writes, [...] "NLP appears to be a superficial and gimmicky <b>approach</b> <b>to</b> <b>dealing</b> <b>with</b> mental health problems. Unfortunately, NLP appears to be the first {{in a long line of}} mass marketing seminars that purport to virtually cure any mental disorder...it appears that NLP has no empirical or scientific support as to the underlying tenets of its theory or clinical effectiveness.

2500|$|Over the years, Duke has {{maintained}} its anti-union stance, especially within the medical center. North Carolina’s {{status as a}} [...] right-to-work state renders unionization difficult, [...] and Duke makes unionization even more challenging. In 2000, the International Union of Operating Engineers held a union drive for nurses in Duke hospital. During this campaign, many nurses claimed that Duke supported the voting rights of nurses who were “initially {{not included in the}} vote,” may not “understand related grievances ,” and would “likely vote no.” [...] Just as in the drive of 1974, the inclusion of these less involved nurses in the vote weakened union support. The NLRB held mixed opinions on whether the hospital was involved in unfair labor practices, but Duke was found guilty of trying to convince nurses that unionization would lead to a reduction of benefits. [...] As history would predict, the union lost the vote. [...] Similarly, in 2002, Constance Donahue, a registered nurse, was fired from Duke Hospital. While the hospital claimed she was fired for negligence, she argues that she was fired because she tried to initiate unionization efforts amongst nurses. [...] While a Durham judge reached a split decision regarding Donahue’s case, [...] the incident raises questions about Duke’s <b>approach</b> <b>to</b> <b>dealing</b> <b>with</b> unions.|$|E
2500|$|As {{the issue}} of {{same-sex}} marriage has broached the forefront {{of social and political}} consciousness in the United States over the past few years, it has also become more prevalent in the Jewish community as well. Certain branches of Judaism that had until recently been less open to gay rights have made organizational advances on the issues. The Conservative Movement was the last of Judaism’s liberal streams to adopt a more progressive streamlined <b>approach</b> <b>to</b> <b>dealing</b> <b>with</b> issues related to homosexuality. Even within the insular Orthodox community, there is a small, but growing population of individuals and leaders who are actively engaged in the struggle for same-sex marriage as a secular institution in America. Rabbi Steven Greenberg is an openly gay Orthodox rabbi who is leading the charge among open-minded Orthodox and traditionally-observant Jews around the world. Leading Orthodox rabbis have denounced reparative therapy and have embraced a much more toned down approach to homosexuality in Judaism. Each year dozens of observant Jewish students [...] "come out of the closet" [...] and many have increasingly remained involved in organized Jewish life. Organizations have been established to assist Jews struggling with the perceived dichotomy between living a traditional Jewish life and being homosexual. Eshel was established by Rabbi Greenberg as a platform to advocate for greater acceptance of LGBT Jews in Orthodox life. Jewish Queer Youth (JQY) also exists as a platform to connect with and advocate for LGBT rights within Jewish communities around the country.|$|E

We also show how hard constraints can eliminate cycles in the preference ordering. Finally, we extend this <b>approach</b> <b>to</b> <b>deal</b> <b>with</b> the preferences of multiple agents.
