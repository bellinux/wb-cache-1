5|$|Referring {{to the two}} ontological {{arguments}} {{proposed by}} Anselm in Chapters 2 and 3 of his Proslogion, Malcolm supported Kant's criticism of Anselm's <b>argument</b> <b>in</b> Chapter 2: that existence cannot be a perfection of something. However, he identified {{what he sees as}} the second ontological <b>argument</b> <b>in</b> Chapter 3 which is not susceptible to such criticism.|$|E

5|$|Another {{important}} <b>argument</b> <b>in</b> {{favor of}} dualism {{is that the}} mental and the physical seem to have quite different, and perhaps irreconcilable, properties. Mental events have a subjective quality, whereas physical events do not. So, for example, one can reasonably ask what a burnt finger feels like, or what a blue sky looks like, or what nice music sounds like to a person. But it is meaningless, or at least odd, to ask what a surge in the uptake of glutamate in the dorsolateral portion of the hippocampus feels like.|$|E

5|$|In the comitatus, {{there is}} {{consensus}} that vexillationes were c. 500 and legiones c. 1,000 strong. The greatest uncertainty concerns {{the size of}} the crack auxilia palatina infantry regiments, originally formed by Constantine. The evidence is contradictory, suggesting that these units could have been either c. 500 or c. 1,000 strong, or somewhere in between. If the higher figure were true, then there would be little to distinguish auxilia from legiones, which is the strongest <b>argument</b> <b>in</b> favour of c. 500.|$|E
5|$|Modern historians, however, {{doubt the}} {{veracity}} of this theory. For one thing, notes Kenneth R. Beesley, the Deseret News and every book published in the alphabet prominently feature {{the key to the}} alphabet, and anyone without a key could have gotten a copy of A Journey to Great-Salt-Lake City, or traveled to Salt Lake City themselves and bought one.

5|$|More generally, the Report {{made the}} <b>argument</b> <b>in</b> {{favor of the}} {{sovereignty}} of the individual states, for which it is best known. The basic message was that the states were the ultimate parties constituting the federal compact, and that therefore the individual states were ultimate arbiters of whether the compact had been broken by the usurpation of power. This doctrine is known as the compact theory. It was the presence of this <b>argument</b> <b>in</b> the Resolutions that had allowed the Federalists to paint the Democratic-Republicans as leaning toward secession; in the amended Report the line is moderated, with an emphasis that it is the states as political societies of the people (and therefore, one reads in, not the state legislatures alone) which possess this power. Either formulation would help the Democratic-Republican cause by refuting the finality of any constitutional interpretation advanced by the Congress and federal judiciary, both of which were dominated by Federalists.|$|E
5|$|Non-war related {{free speech}} rights were also {{advanced}} during the Vietnam war era; in 1969, the ACLU defended a Ku Klux Klan member who advocated long-term violence against the government, and the Supreme Court concurred with the ACLU's <b>argument</b> <b>in</b> the landmark decision Brandenburg v. Ohio, which held that only speech which advocated imminent violence could be outlawed.|$|E

Stephens and Nicole's father know she is lying but can do nothing. Two years later, Stephens sees Driscoll working as a bus driver in a city.|$|E

5|$|The {{validity}} of the Euclidean algorithm can be proven by a two-step <b>argument.</b> <b>In</b> the first step, the final nonzero remainder r'N−1 is shown to divide both a and b.

In the second step, it is shown that any common divisor of a and b, including g, must divide r'N−1; therefore, g must be less than or equal to r'N−1. These two conclusions are inconsistent unless r'N−1 = g.|$|E

5|$|Theologian and philosopher Anselm of Canterbury (1033–1109) {{proposed}} an ontological <b>argument</b> <b>in</b> {{the second and}} third chapters of his Proslogion.

5|$|This {{contains}} {{the notion of}} a being that cannot be conceived not to exist. He argued that if something can be conceived not to exist, then something greater can be conceived.

5|$|According to Nick Davies in The Guardian, the {{statement}} {{was the result of}} an intense <b>argument</b> <b>in</b> the Met's press office, after an earlier draft had been rejected. He wrote that both the Met and IPCC said {{the statement}} represented the truth as they understood it at the time, and that there had been no allegation at that point that Tomlinson had come into contact with police. Davies asked why the IPCC were involved if they had not realized there had been police contact. He alleged that senior sources within the Met said privately that the assault on Tomlinson had been spotted by the police control room at Cobalt Street in south London, and that a chief inspector on the ground had also reported it. The Met issued a statement saying they had checked with every chief inspector who had been part of Operation Glencoe, and that none of them had called in such a report.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the ontological}} {{argument}} {{may have been}} implicit {{in the works of}} Greek philosophers such as Plato and the Neoplatonists, the mainstream view is that the ontological argument was first clearly stated and developed by Anselm of Canterbury. Some scholars argued that the Islamic philosopher Avicenna (Ibn Sina) developed a special kind of ontological argument before Anselm, but other scholars have doubted this position. Daniel Dombrowski marked three major stages {{in the development of the}} argument: Anselm's initial explicit formulation; the eighteenth century criticisms of Kant and Hume; and the identification of a second ontological <b>argument</b> <b>in</b> Anselm's Proslogion by twentieth century philosophers.|$|E
5|$|Alvin Plantinga's {{free will}} defense {{is a logical}} {{argument}} developed by American analytic philosopher Alvin Plantinga, the John A.

Plantinga's argument is a defense against the logical problem of evil as formulated by philosopher J. L. Mackie beginning in 1955. Mackie's formulation of the logical problem of evil argued that three attributes of God, omniscience, omnipotence, and omnibenevolence, in orthodox Christian theism are logically incompatible with the existence of evil. In 1982, Mackie conceded that Plantinga's defense successfully refuted his <b>argument</b> <b>in</b> The Miracle of Theism, {{though he did not}} claim that the problem of evil had been put to rest.|$|E
