In 1830, by an address from both Houses of Parliament, he {{was removed from}} the Bench, in consequence of well-proven misappropriation of public moneys. The third volume of Personal Sketches appeared in 1833 as did the delayed volume of his Historic Memoirs. This book was subsequently reproduced in a cheaper form as The Rise and Fall of the Irish Nation. His works <b>are</b> <b>interesting,</b> racy, and valuable – although his statements of fact cannot always be depended on – containing much of personal incident, related in a fascinating style. He died at Versailles on 8 April 1834.|$|E

25|$|Fortescue {{remarked that}} the medieval {{explanations}} <b>are</b> <b>interesting</b> as showing with what reverence people studied {{the text of}} the Canon and how, when every one had forgotten the original reasons for its forms, they still kept the conviction that the Mass is full of venerable mysteries and that all its clauses mean more than common expressions. He added that in this conviction the sometimes naive medieval interpreters were eminently right.|$|E
25|$|Beet (Beta vulgaris) has {{an immense}} {{economic}} importance as sugar crop (Sugar beet), {{and a great}} importance as a vegetable (Chard, Beetroot), and as fodder plant (Mangelwurzel).

In New Zealand, A Dog's Show was a popular television show until the late 1980s, screening just before the weekend news. In the United Kingdom between 1975 and 1999, the BBC ran One Man and His Dog, which had a large urban audience. The movie Babe, about a pig who wants to herd sheep, was based on Dick King-Smith's book The Sheep Pig, about sheepdog trials in northern England.|$|E
25|$|The Stephenson Mansion {{was listed}} on The National Register of Historic Places as the William H. H. Graham House in 1982. The home {{was built in}} 1889 for William H. H. Graham, who was {{associated}} with the Benjamin Harrison administration. It also served as a sorority home for Kappa Kappa Gamma students at Butler University in 1923. D. C. Stephenson acquired the home in 1923 and remodeled it to resemble a Civil War-era plantation home. The home is one of several in the neighborhood that <b>are</b> <b>interesting</b> to people who believe in haunted houses.|$|E
25|$|This {{description}} has {{similarities to}} the older account by Adam of Bremen but the differences <b>are</b> <b>interesting.</b> Adam assigns control of the weather and produce of the fields to Thor but Snorri says that Freyr rules over those areas. Snorri also omits any explicitly sexual references in Freyr's description. Those discrepancies can be explained in several ways. It {{is possible that the}} Norse gods did not have exactly the same roles in Icelandic and Swedish paganism but it must also be remembered that Adam and Snorri were writing with different goals in mind. Either Snorri or Adam may also have had distorted information.|$|E

25|$|The {{structures}} {{observed in}} this region <b>are</b> <b>interesting,</b> and unique to areas where rocks of similar ages are found. Similar dome and keel structures {{are found in the}} Barberton Greenstone Belt. These structures were interpreted {{to be the result of}} partial convective overturn. These lighter colored domes surrounded by the darker colored greenstone belts are easily seen in satellite imagery, and can also be seen in the map above. A cross-section of this structure is provided, and the steeply dipping anticlines and synclines are characteristic of this type of structure. The interior of the granitic domes are mostly undeformed, however the margins and the greenstone belts are heavily deformed, and the metamorphic grade depends on the region's proximity to the dome-keel margins.|$|E
25|$|The wreck {{has been}} the object of several {{investigations}} by marine archaeologists from Swedish National Maritime Museum, Södertörn University and the University of Southampton. Since the hull is intact and the sinking occurred suddenly, the wreck contains a multitude of objects that <b>are</b> <b>interesting</b> to archaeologists and historians. On the top deck there are several interesting finds, both ship equipment and other assorted items, including a musket. Two of the three masts are still standing, and the damaged windlass (used to winch up the anchor) can be clearly seen. There is an intact cabinet containing carpenter's tools, including an axe, a plane and an awl. Of the several cannon with which the ship was once armed only one remains, complete with its gun carriage.|$|E
25|$|Both {{northern}} and {{southern part of the}} voivodeship is surrounded by a green belt. Bielsko-Biała is enveloped by the Beskidy Mountains which are popular with winter sports fans. It offers over 150 ski lifts and 200 kilometres of ski routes. More and more slopes are illuminated and equipped with artificial snow generators. Szczyrk, Brenna, Wisła and Ustroń are the most popular winter mountain resorts. Rock climbing sites can be found in Jura Krakowsko-Czestochowska. The ruins of castles forming the Eagle Nests Trail are a famous attraction of the region. Often visited is the Black Madonna's Jasna Góra Sanctuary in Częstochowa - the annual destination of over 4 million pilgrims from all over the world. In south-western part of the voivodeship are parks, palaces and old monastery (Rudy Raciborskie, Wodzisław Śląski).

These inscriptions {{have been known}} to scholars {{for more than a century}} and have repeatedly been the subject of interpretation, yet little attention has been paid to the elements from which they were composed. On the inner face of the octagon the declaration of faith is followed by conflated verses describing the powers of God. Next Muhammad is introduced, with a blessing that, though not directly quoted from the Quran, was clearly already in use in 694 AD. Then comes an exhortation to Christians that Jesus was also a prophet and mortal, followed by the claim that God is sufficient unto Himself. Finally comes a command to bend to His will and the threat of reckoning for those who do not.|$|E
25|$|It {{is certain}} that the {{combinations}} which present themselves to the mind {{in a kind of}} sudden illumination after a somewhat prolonged period of unconscious work are generally useful and fruitful combinations... all the combinations are formed {{as a result of the}} automatic action of the subliminal ego, but those only which <b>are</b> <b>interesting</b> find their way into the field of consciousness... A few only are harmonious, and consequently at once useful and beautiful, and they will be capable of affecting the geometrician's special sensibility I have been speaking of; which, once aroused, will direct our attention upon them, and will thus give them the opportunity of becoming conscious... In the subliminal ego, on the contrary, there reigns what I would call liberty, if one could give this name to the mere absence of discipline and to disorder born of chance.|$|E
25|$|Fairly {{straightforward}} statistics provide {{estimates of}} whether associations between genes on lists {{are greater than}} what one would expect by chance. These statistics <b>are</b> <b>interesting,</b> even if they represent a substantial oversimplification of {{what is really going}} on. Here is an example. Suppose there are 10,000 genes in an experiment, only 50 (0.5%) of which play a known role in making cholesterol. The experiment identifies 200 regulated genes. Of those, 40 (20%) turn out to be on a list of cholesterol genes as well. Based on the overall prevalence of the cholesterol genes (0.5%) one expects an average of 1 cholesterol gene for every 200 regulated genes, that is, 0.005 times 200. This expectation is an average, so one expects to see more than one some of the time. The question becomes how often we would see 40 instead of 1 due to pure chance.|$|E
