25|$|In the {{political}} philosophy of healthcare, {{the debate between}} universal healthcare and private healthcare is particularly contentious in the United States. In the 1960s, there was a plethora of public initiatives {{by the federal government}} to consolidate and modernize the U.S. healthcare system. With Lyndon Johnson's Great Society, the U.S. established public health insurance for both senior citizens and the underprivileged. Known as Medicare and Medicaid, these two healthcare programs granted certain groups of Americans access to adequate healthcare services. Although these healthcare programs were <b>a</b> <b>giant</b> <b>step</b> in the direction of socialized medicine, many people think that the U.S. needs to do more for its citizenry with respect to healthcare coverage.

40|$|Abstract. <b>Giant</b> <b>steps</b> is <b>a</b> {{technique}} to accelerate Monte Carlo radiative transfer in opticallythick cells (which are isotropic and homogeneous in matter properties and into which astrophysical atmospheres are divided) by greatly {{reducing the number}} of Monte Carlo steps needed to propagate photon packets through such cells. In an optically-thick cell, packets starting from any point (which can be regarded a point source) well away from the cell wall act essentially as packets diffusing from the point source in an infinite, isotropic, homogeneous atmosphere. One can replace many ordinary Monte Carlo steps that a packet diffusing from the point source takes by <b>a</b> randomly directed <b>giant</b> <b>step</b> whose length is slightly less than the distance to the nearest cell wall point from the point source. The <b>giant</b> <b>step</b> is assigned <b>a</b> time duration equal to the time for the RMS radius for a burst of packets diffusing from the point source to have reached the <b>giant</b> <b>step</b> length. We call assigning giant-step time durations this way RMS-radius (RMSR) synchronization. Propagating packets by series of <b>giant</b> <b>steps</b> in giant-steps random walks in the interiors of optically-thick cells constitutes the technique of <b>giant</b> <b>steps.</b> <b>Giant</b> <b>steps</b> effectively replaces the exact diffusion treatment of ordinary Monte Carlo radiative transfer in optically-thick cells by an approximate diffusion treatment.

2500|$|... 1951: Columbia Masterworks: {{the company}} {{recorded}} a 3-LP album {{of what was}} then the standard performing version of Porgy and Bess – the most complete recording made of the opera up to that time. It was billed as a [...] "complete" [...] version, but was complete only insofar as that was the way the work was usually performed then. (Actually, nearly an hour was cut from the opera.) Because album producer Goddard Lieberson was eager to bring as much of Porgy and Bess as he felt was practical on records at the time, the recording featured more of Gershwin's original recitatives and orchestrations than had ever been heard before. The recording was conducted by Lehman Engel, and starred Lawrence Winters and Camilla Williams, both from the New York City Opera. Several singers who had been associated with the original 1935 production and the 1942 revival of Porgy and Bess were finally given a chance to record their roles more or less complete. The album was highly acclaimed as <b>a</b> <b>giant</b> <b>step</b> in recorded opera in its time. It was re-released at budget price on the Odyssey label in the early 1970s. It has subsequently appeared on CD on Sony's [...] "Masterworks Heritage" [...] CD series, and on the Naxos label as well. The album is not sung in as directly [...] "operatic" [...] a style as later versions, treading a fine line between opera and musical theatre.|$|E

Then hence to my good friend John Gibson's, and talked with him of sundries. I had an odd dream last night. It {{seemed to me that}} I was at a panorama, when a vulgar little man behind me was making some very clever but impudent remarks on the picture, {{and at the same time}} seemed desirous of information, which no one would give him. I turned round and saw a young fellow dressed like a common carter, with a blue coat and red waistcoat, and a whip tied across him. He was young, with a hatchet-face, which was turned to a brick colour by exposure to the weather, sharp eyes, and in manner and voice not unlike John Leyden. I was so much struck with his countenance and talents that I asked him about his situation, and expressed a wish to mend it. He followed me, from the hopes which I excited, and we had a dreadful walk among ruins, and afterwards I found myself on horseback, and in front of a roaring torrent. I plunged in as I have formerly done in good sad earnest, and got to the other side. Then I got home among my children and grandchildren, and there also was my genius. Now this would defy Daniel and the soothsayers to boot; nor do I know why I should now put it down, except that I have seldom seen a portrait in life which was more strongly marked on my memory than that man's. Perhaps my genius was Mr. Dickinson, papermaker, who has undertaken that the London creditors who hold Constable's bills will be satisfied with 10s. in the pound. This would be turning a genius to purpose, for 6s. 8d. is provided, and they can have no difficulty about 3s. 4d. These debts, for which I am legally responsible, though no party to their contraction, amount to £30,000 odds. Now if they can be cleared for £15,000 it is just so much gained.
