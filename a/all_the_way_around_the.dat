5|$|Lesions can be transverse, {{occurring}} {{between the}} rings of the trachea, longitudinal or spiral. They may occur along the membranous {{part of the}} trachea, the main bronchi, or both. In 8% of ruptures, lesions are complex, occurring {{in more than one}} location, with more than one type of lesion, or on both of the main bronchi and the trachea. Transverse tears are more common than longitudinal or complex ones. The laceration may completely transect the airway or it may go only partway around. Partial tears that do not go <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> circumference of the airway do not allow a lacerated airway to become completely detached; tears that encircle the whole airway can allow separation to occur. Lacerations may also be classified as complete or incomplete. In an incomplete lesion, a layer of tissue surrounding the bronchus remains intact and can keep the air in the airway, preventing it from leaking into the areas surrounding the airways. Incomplete lacerations may require closer scrutiny to detect and may not be diagnosed right away.|$|E
5|$|Chest x-ray is {{the initial}} imaging {{technique}} used to diagnose TBI. The film {{may not have}} any signs in an otherwise asymptomatic patient. Indications of TBI seen on radiographs include deformity in the trachea or a defect in the tracheal wall. Radiography may also show cervical emphysema, air in the tissues of the neck. X-rays may also show accompanying injuries and signs such as fractures and subcutaneous emphysema. If subcutaneous emphysema occurs and the hyoid bone appears in an X-ray to be sitting unusually high in the throat, {{it may be an}} indication that the trachea has been severed. TBI is also suspected if an endotracheal tube appears in an X-ray to be out of place, or if its cuff appears to be more full than normal or to protrude through a tear in the airway. If a bronchus is torn <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>around,</b> <b>the</b> lung may collapse outward toward the chest wall (rather than inward, as it usually does in pneumothorax) because it loses the attachment to the bronchus which normally holds it toward the center. In a person lying face-up, the lung collapses toward the diaphragm and the back. This sign, described in 1969, is called fallen lung sign and is pathognomonic of TBI (that is, it is diagnostic for TBI because it does not occur in other conditions); however it occurs only rarely. In as many as one in five cases, people with blunt trauma and TBI have no signs of the injury on chest X-ray. CT scanning detects over 90% of TBI resulting from blunt trauma, but neither X-ray nor CT are a replacement for bronchoscopy.|$|E

25|$|The carving is so {{deep that}} the forms are almost {{completely}} offset from the background resulting in three, or even four, layers of various figures and forms.

25|$|Most of {{the ancient}} {{religions}} {{of the world have}} a tradition of using some type of prayer beads as tools in devotional meditation. Most prayer beads and Christian rosaries consist of pearls or beads linked together by a thread. The Roman Catholic rosary is a string of beads containing five sets with ten small beads. Each set of ten is separated by another bead. The Hindu japa mala has 108 beads (the figure 108 in itself having spiritual significance, as well as those used in Jainism and Buddhist prayer beads. Each bead is counted once as a person recites a mantra until the person has gone <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> mala. The Muslim misbaha has 99 beads.

25|$|In most cassettes, the {{magnetic}} tape {{is attached to}} each spool with a leader, usually made of strong plastic. This leader protected the weaker magnetic tape from the shock occurring when the tape reached the end. Leaders can be complex: a plastic slide-in wedge anchors a short fully opaque plastic tape to the take-up hub; one or more tinted semi-opaque plastic segments follow; the clear leader (a tintless semi-opaque plastic segment) follows, which wraps almost <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> supply reel, before splicing to {{the magnetic}} tape itself. The clear leader spreads the shock load to {{a long stretch of}} tape instead of to the microscopic splice. Various patents have been issued detailing leader construction and associated tape player mechanisms to detect leaders. Cassette tape users would also use spare leaders to repair broken tapes.|$|E
25|$|In 1936 a {{fragment}} of a similar Temple warning inscription was found. After 1967, archaeologists found that the wall extended <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> Temple Mount and {{is part of the}} city wall near the Lions' Gate. Thus, the Western Wall is not the only remaining part of the Temple Mount. Currently, Robinson's Arch (named after American Edward Robinson) remains as the beginning of an arch that spanned the gap between the top of the platform and the higher ground farther away. This had been used by the priests as an entrance. Commoners had entered through the still-extant, but now plugged, gates on the southern side which led through colonnades {{to the top of the}} platform. One of these colonnades is still extant and reachable through the Temple Mount. The Southern wall was designed as a grand entrance. Recent archeological digs have found thousands of mikvehs (ceremonial bathtubs) for the ritual purification of the worshipers, as well as a grand stairway leading to the now blocked entrance. Inside the walls, the platform was supported by a series of vaulted archways, now called Solomon's Stables, which still exist and whose current renovation by the Waqf is extremely controversial. The temple itself was constructed of imported white marble that gleamed in the daylight.|$|E

500|$|The {{inverted}} roller coaster, then dubbed [...] "Secret Weapon 3", {{was developed}} throughout 1992. Wardley and Nick Varney, marketing director of Alton Towers, {{came up with}} the name [...] "Nemesis" [...] and pitched a theming concept about an alien creature excavated from the ground. Tussauds Studios elaborated on this, creating the station and surrounding theme design. Wardley also worked alongside Stengel Engineering and landscape architects to develop a layout for the ride and surrounding area, which could be exciting for both riders and non-riders; for example, the final inversion was built at the eye level of an observer and the queue makes its way <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> quarry in which the track sits.|$|E
500|$|The outer part of {{the castle}} was defended by an {{octagonal}} wall, which linked the four stirrup turrets and bastions that formed the main defences for the castle. This wall had initially {{been built in the}} second phase of work on the castle, but was then supplemented in the final phase with an additional [...] exterior facing, and was originally finished with a gun embrasure along each section, and parapets. A two-storey gallery, which provided relatively spacious barrack accommodation for the garrison, ran <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> inside of the wall, although only the ground floor of the gallery now survives. The gallery would have been lit by windows facing into the courtyard. The Rampire earthwork built in the early 17th century lies across the south and south-east parts of the defences, where the gunports were blocked up with stone when the earth was piled up along the inside of the castle.|$|E
500|$|In 1369, Charles V became {{concerned}} about {{the weakness of the}} eastern side of the city to English attacks and raids by mercenaries. Charles instructed Hugh Aubriot, the new provost, to build a much larger fortification on the same site as Marcel's bastille. Work began in 1370 with another pair of towers being built behind the first bastille, followed by two towers to the north, and finally two towers to the south. The fortress was probably not finished by the time Charles died in 1380, and was completed by his son, Charles VI. The resulting structure became known simply as the Bastille, with the eight irregularly built towers and linking curtain walls forming a structure [...] wide and [...] deep, the walls and towers [...] high and [...] thick at their bases. Built to the same height, the roofs of the towers and the tops of the walls formed a broad, crenellated walkway <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> fortress. Each of the six newer towers had underground [...] "cachots", or dungeons, at its base, and curved [...] "calotte", literally [...] "shell", rooms in their roofs.|$|E
