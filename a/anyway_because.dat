Homer has made Bart's visit {{conditional}} on him getting at least a C- average on his report card. Bart receives a D- in each subject from Ms. Krabappel, so he changes each grade into straight A+. Homer chides Bart for not faking plausible grades, but lets him go to camp <b>anyway,</b> <b>because</b> {{he does not want}} Bart hanging around throughout the summer.|$|E

Though friends, including Terry Link, his colleague in the Illinois Senate, warned Obama against challenging Rush, {{as there was}} no obvious reason to displace him to the voters, Obama ran <b>anyway</b> <b>because</b> of his frustration with what he claimed was Republican obstructionism in the Illinois Legislature and the feeling Rush was representing the district less well as he could. Also challenging Rush were Donne Trotter, a state senator, and George Roby, a police officer. Raymond Wardingly, a perennial candidate {{who worked as a}} clown, ran unopposed for the Republican nomination.|$|E

After Dassin told Auric {{he did not want}} music, Auric claimed he would [...] "protect [...] I'm going to write the music for the scene <b>anyways,</b> <b>because</b> you need to be protected". After filming was finished, Dassin showed the film to Auric once with music and once without. Afterward, Auric agreed the scene should be unscored.|$|R

One of Alice's friends, Gwen, {{suggests}} finding work on a cruise ship over the summer. Gwen didn’t want to work on the cruise ship just for money but also to have some fun with her friends while working. While at first hesitant, the group of friends changes their minds and all the girls apply to work on the ship after graduation.|$|R

25|$|Opponents of ASFA {{argued that}} the real reason {{children}} languished in foster care was that too many were taken needlessly from their parents in the first place. Since ASFA did not address this, opponents said, it would not accomplish its goals, and would only slow {{a decline in the}} foster care population that should have occurred <b>anyway</b> <b>because</b> of a decline in reported child abuse.|$|E

She shunned him into compliance by pointing out that the place was hers by right <b>anyway,</b> <b>because</b> her husband had conquered it. However, Ögedei also expanded his personal appanage, seizing some territories of Tolui and took most of Sorghaghtani's soldiers.|$|E
25|$|Duffy {{was almost}} {{appointed}} Poet Laureate of the United Kingdom in 1999 {{after the death}} of Ted Hughes, but lost out on the position to Andrew Motion. Duffy said she would not have accepted the position at that time <b>anyway,</b> <b>because</b> she was in a relationship with Scottish poet Jackie Kay, had a young daughter, and would not have welcomed the public attention. In the same year, she was elected as a Fellow of the Royal Society of Literature.|$|E
50|$|Seth Zamost and Matt Brands first {{crossed paths}} in {{elementary}} school at a mutual friend’s birthday party. Two years apart in age, {{it was not until}} high school, when Seth’s older brother Ian invited Matt over, that they truly met. That night they bonded by watching WWE together and officially became friends after Matt showed Seth his D-Lo Brown impersonation. The first song they made together was a parody of Rich Boy‘s hit “Throw Some D‘s” titled “Throw Some Cheese.” While never planning on taking hip hop seriously, they obliged their friend’s demands to continue making music for their entertainment. To this day, they humbly maintain that they are no good at making music, but continue <b>anyways</b> <b>because</b> they and their listeners enjoy it, using said dissonance as a way to inspire others to pursue their passions unapologetically.|$|R

25|$|The {{team made}} a huge effort for the next 12 hours {{to try to get}} him down the mountain, but to no avail, as they were {{unsuccessful}} in getting him through the difficult sections. Even for the able, the Everest North-East ridge is recognised as a challenge. It is hard to rescue someone who has become incapacitated and it can be beyond the ability of rescuers to save anyone in such a difficult spot. One way around this situation was pioneered by two Nepali men in 2013, who had intended to paraglide off the summit. They had no choice and were forced to go through with their plan <b>anyway,</b> <b>because</b> they had run out of bottled oxygen and supplies. They successfully launched off the summit and para-glided down to Namche in just 42 minutes, without having to climb down the mountain.|$|E
25|$|When Cao Xiu {{realised}} he {{had been}} deceived by Zhou Fang, he felt humiliated but decided to continue the campaign <b>anyway</b> <b>because</b> he had superiority in numbers and his troops were well-trained. During the Battle of Shiting, Lu Xun remained in the central command, with Zhu Huan and Quan Cong leading the armies on his left and right flanks respectively. Their three armies advanced together and defeated Cao Xiu's forces lying in ambush and drove them further northward until Jiashi (夾石). They killed and captured thousands of enemies and obtained much of the enemy's livestock, equipment and supplies. Cao Xiu died of illness after returning to Wei. Lu Xun and the victorious Wu forces returned to Wuchang (武昌; present-day Ezhou, Hubei), where Sun Quan held a grand reception for them. Sun Quan instructed his servants to shield Lu Xun with his imperial parasol when he entered or left the palace, and rewarded Lu Xun with many gifts. The honours Lu Xun received were unprecedented in his time. He moved to Xiling County (西陵縣; present-day Xiling District, Yichang, Hubei) after that.|$|E
25|$|After the {{surrender}} of the city, the Church of the Holy Sephulcre was ordered to be closed for three days by Saladin while he considered {{what to do with}} it. Some of his advisers told him to destroy the Church in order to end all Christian interest in Jerusalem. Most of his advisers however told him to let the Church remain there saying that Christian pilgrimages would continue <b>anyway</b> <b>because</b> of the sanctity of the place and also reminded him of the Caliph Umar who allowed the Church to remain in Christian hands after conquering the city. Saladin rejected the destruction of the church saying that he had no intention to discourage the Christian pilgrimages to the site and it was reopened after three days on his orders. The Frankish pilgrims were allowed to enter the church upon paying a fee. To solidify Muslim claims to Jerusalem, many holy sites, including the shrine later known as Al-Aqsa Mosque, were ritually purified with rose water. Christian furnishings were removed from the mosque and it was fitted with oriental carpets. Its walls were illuminated with candelabras and text from the Quran. The Orthodox Christians and Jacobites were allowed to remain and to worship as they chose. The Copts who were barred from entering Jerusalem by the Crusader kingdom of Jerusalem as they were considered heretics and atheists, were allowed to enter the city without paying any fees by Saladin as he considered them his subjects. The Coptic places of worship that were earlier taken over by the Crusaders were returned to the Coptic priests. The Copts were also allowed to visit The Church of the Holy Sephulcre and other Christian sites. The Abyssinian Christians were allowed to visit the holy places of Jerusalem without paying any fees.|$|E

A vulnerability (v 8), which allows an attacker to inject SQL code, was purposely included in the authentication form of the application.

Murray arrives and tells them that despite the disastrous meeting, the greeting card company decided to produce the card <b>anyway,</b> but <b>because</b> the chosen design is [...] "Happy 80th Birthday, Son" [...] very few cards are made and the band ends up earning only 50¢.|$|R
500|$|The {{show was}} put out on a Friday, a night on which the WB had never {{broadcast}} before, at 8:00 pm, a time Oakley felt was inappropriate, and aired in front of The Wayans Bros., The Jamie Foxx Show and The Steve Harvey Show, all shows with which Oakley felt it was [...] "incompatible". The show's poor reviews and ratings of an average of 1.8 million led to its swift cancellation. Oakley concluded that the pair had been [...] "very naive" [...] with regard to producing the show, and that it [...] "would've been better on cable <b>anyway</b> <b>because</b> it would never have appealed to a broad enough audience due to the subject matter." [...] The 13 completed episodes were later aired on Cartoon Network's Adult Swim block and the show garnered a worldwide cult following. After lobbying from Oakley and Weinstein, the WB eventually released the series on DVD.|$|E
500|$|The {{rehearsal}} {{process is}} really understated. It's funny because it's not really needed. It's not needed for us <b>anyway.</b> <b>Because</b> {{we know how}} to play the songs, and the [...] charts don't change the songs structurally at all. But the symphony charts are something that you're not used to hearing. And then the symphony doesn't need the rehearsal because they sight-read. They sight-read better than we could even imagine. So when we get there, they already know how to play our songs better than we do... The purpose of the rehearsal is really, honestly to prepare the band for exactly how powerful the concert is going to be. When the symphony jumps in during those moments where all of a sudden you're singing a song you sing every night and then 30 more musicians start playing, it's so powerful that it causes you to take pause, and you can't take pause. And that's what the rehearsal really is for.|$|E
500|$|Matt Pryor {{continued}} {{as part of}} The New Amsterdams, an acoustic alt-country group he had formed in 2000, expanding its sound and solidifying its previously revolving-door lineup. In 2007 he formed The Terrible Twos, a children's band that has released two albums on Vagrant Records. Regarding the decision to make a children's album directly after the split, Pryor said [...] "I {{wanted to do it}} <b>anyway</b> <b>because</b> I have kids and I want to write songs for them, but nobody {{is going to be like}} 'this isn't as good as the old stuff.' It's immune to punk criticism." [...] In July 2008, he refocused his efforts on a solo career with the release of Confidence Man, an alt-country release similar in sound to The New Amsterdams. After his second album, May Day, Pryor announced that he would be formally disbanding The New Amsterdams in favor of his solo career, concluding the band's tenure with the release of Outroduction, a B-sides recording.|$|E

Pip says that because of the stupid bet Sally almost died, and that she regrets making the bet. She says the Sally Marshall is not an alien but she will quit the bet <b>anyways</b> <b>because</b> she feels so bad about what {{happened}} to her. Rhonnie delighted with winning keeps telling Pip that she was right. Pip says that shes not and that she only won because she dropped out. Sally then comes on to the beach and apologizes to Pip about her telescope. Pip tells her it's alright, and I know your not an alien. Then out of nowhere a UFO comes flying and hovers right above the beach. Sally begins crying and tells Pip that she is an alien, and if she doesn't leave now her whole family could die. Pip who is also crying tells her that she's her best friend, and so does Sally. Sally then leaves in the UFO forever. Pip leaves the beach and returns home. Pip's dad comes up to her room and comforts her about Sally. He also gives her, her telescope which he says some kids dropped it off.|$|R
25|$|Related to this, a single-pole RCD/RCBO {{interrupts}} the energized conductor only, while a double-pole device interrupts {{both the}} energized and return conductors. Usually {{this is a}} standard and safe practice, since the return conductor is held at ground potential <b>anyway.</b> However, <b>because</b> of its design, a single-pole RCD will not isolate or disconnect all relevant wires in certain uncommon situations, for example where the return conductor is not being held, as expected, at ground potential, or where current leakage occurs between the return and earth conductors. In these cases, a double-pole RCD will offer protection, since the return conductor would also be disconnected.|$|R

On November 22, 1918, days after the Armistice with Germany, the design staff sent the General Staff a proposal to complete the first four Normandies to a modified design. The General Staff replied that the ships would need {{a top speed of}} [...] and a more powerful main battery. Since the dockyard facilities had not been enlarged during the war, the size of the ships could not be significantly increased. This allowed for only modest improvements, particularly for the installation of anti-torpedo bulges. In February 1919, the General Staff decided that the ships would be completed <b>anyway,</b> <b>because</b> new vessels incorporating the lessons of the war could not be completed for at least 6 to 7 years, due to the lengthy design studies such battleships would require.|$|E

RedEye critic Curt Wagner rated it three stars out of four and wrote that it includes [...] "visual [...] ", cultural references and [...] "so-fast-you'll-miss-them jokes" [...] that it might require multiple viewings. Wagner, however, meant that this was a rather positive feature, writing: [...] "For example, you might be laughing so hard at what just happened that you miss a fun line..."

Noble found it unusual to film an episode that did not involve the lead actors. He explained, [...] "That was Walter with two really big, important guest stars, Henry Ian Cusick and Georgina Haig. It felt, to me, like it was a really strong episode. The two guest actors did a fantastic job, which is not easy to do, to step into an established company. It is out of the box and is somewhere else completely. I think that the fans will love it.

5000|$|The Soviet Union {{lived in}} {{significant}} fear of World War Three, {{and because of}} this, tended to have a hair trigger {{when it came to}} reacting to an event. Because of this, the threat of nuclear war was a very real possibility, even if the reasons were a complete misunderstanding. The Soviet Union was ready to go at any time, especially after being scared many times for smaller reasons. On the night of September 1, 1983, a civilian Boeing 747 en route to South Korea passed into Soviet airspace near the Siberian coast. An Sukhoi Su-15 interceptor aircraft piloted by Gennadi Osipovich targeted the civilian aircraft and shot it down with two missiles. [...] The Soviets claimed that they knew it was a civilian aircraft, however, they said it would be very easy to convert a civilian aircraft into an intelligence gathering platform. [...] The Soviets claimed they believed they had a justification to shoot down this aircraft because they perceived it to be a hostile intruder. There was one American on board, Larry McDonald who was a United States House of Representative member. Oleg Gordievsky believes that the Soviet Union mistook the civlian airliner to be a United States Boeing RC-135, which is a reconnaissance gathering aircraft which looks very similar to a Boeing 747 {{due to the fact that}} it has four engines and a wide body similar to the airliner. [...] This is refuted by the pilot's of the attacking Soviet aircraft claiming that he knew it was a civilian jet, but he shot it down <b>anyways</b> <b>because</b> it could have been easily converted for reconnaissance. The attitude of the Soviets towards anything that might be perceived as a threat was devolving more and more towards a 'shoot first, ask questions later' mentality. While it may have been uncalled for, Soviets were on edge about everything at this point. This would prove to be incredibly dangerous in the impending strategic nuclear war exercises about to be conducted by the United States and its NATO allies.|$|R
