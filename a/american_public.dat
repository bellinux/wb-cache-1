5|$|One poll {{reported}} in the journal Nature showed that among American scientists (across various disciplines), about 40 percent believe in both evolution and an active deity (theistic evolution). This {{is similar to the}} results reported for surveys of the general <b>American</b> <b>public.</b> Also, about 40 percent of the scientists polled believe in a God that answers prayers, and believe in immortality. While about 55% of scientists surveyed were atheists, agnostics, or nonreligious theists, atheism is far from universal among scientists who support evolution, or among the general public that supports evolution. Very similar results were reported from a 1997 Gallup Poll of the <b>American</b> <b>public</b> and scientists.|$|E

5|$|After {{the riot}} in Chicago and the {{subsequent}} trial, Ochs changed direction again. The events of 1968 convinced him that the average American was not listening to topical songs or responding to Yippie tactics.

50|$|The speech {{also made}} {{an impact on}} Norwegian-Americans {{and the rest of}} the <b>American</b> <b>public's</b> opinion on the {{struggle}} in Europe. The impression of the Norwegian's situation had been severely damaged by an article by the American reporter, Leland Stowe, who happened to be in Oslo on the day the Germans marched into the city. He witnessed shocked Norwegian civilians standing around watching the Germans march down the parade street Karl Johans gate. He misinterpreted the shock as indifference and acceptance on the part of the Norwegian population and wrote a stinging article in Time and several newspapers which severely damaged the <b>American</b> <b>public's</b> opinion of the Norwegian resistance and therefore their motivation to help Norway and Europe. The speech corrected that impression.|$|R
