50|$|In mathematics, <b>a</b> P-multimagic <b>square</b> (also {{known as}} <b>a</b> satanic <b>square)</b> is <b>a</b> magic <b>square</b> that remains magic {{even if all}} its numbers are {{replaced}} by their kth power for 1 &le; k &le; P. Thus, <b>a</b> magic <b>square</b> is bimagic if it is 2-multimagic, and trimagic if it is 3-multimagic; tetramagic for 4-multimagic; and pentamagic for <b>a</b> 5-multimagic <b>square.</b>|$|R

Working west, the square base of tower 7 was reinforced with a circular foundation. Tower 8, on the upper side of the front portcullis, has an irregular, but generally square, base. It is also the shortest of the first nine towers. Guarding {{the other side is}} tower 9, which has <b>a</b> <b>square</b> base reinforced by an eight-sided foundation.|$|E
5|$|This is a {{dissection}} puzzle {{similar to}} a Tangram, and the treatise describing it was found in more complete form in the Archimedes Palimpsest. Archimedes calculates {{the areas of the}} 14 pieces which can be assembled to form <b>a</b> <b>square.</b> Research published by Dr. Reviel Netz of Stanford University in 2003 argued that Archimedes was attempting to determine how many ways the pieces could be assembled into the shape of <b>a</b> <b>square.</b> Dr. Netz calculates that the pieces can be made into <b>a</b> <b>square</b> 17,152 ways. The number of arrangements is 536 when solutions that are equivalent by rotation and reflection have been excluded. The puzzle represents an example of an early problem in combinatorics.|$|E

5|$|Among constant-width shapes with a given width, the Reuleaux {{triangle}} has {{the minimum}} {{area and the}} sharpest (smallest) possible angle (120°) at its corners. By several numerical measures it is the farthest from being centrally symmetric. It provides the largest constant-width shape avoiding the points of an integer lattice, and {{is closely related to}} the shape of the quadrilateral maximizing the ratio of perimeter to diameter. It can perform a complete rotation within <b>a</b> <b>square</b> while at all times touching all four sides of the square, and has the smallest possible area of shapes with this property. However, although it covers most of the square in this rotation process, it fails to cover {{a small fraction of the}} square's area, near its corners. Because of this property of rotating within <b>a</b> <b>square,</b> the Reuleaux triangle is also sometimes known as the Reuleaux rotor.|$|E
