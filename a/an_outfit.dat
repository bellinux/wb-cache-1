5|$|The production’s incredible. The beat {{is just so}} {{constant}} and powerful. That was the first song that I wrote with Dimitri and Maya. I felt like I’d found my sound. And I was kind {{of looking at it}} like <b>an</b> <b>outfit.</b> So it was, ‘if this was <b>an</b> <b>outfit,</b> what would this song need now?’ So we had the pretty dress, which was the chorus. We had the lovely shoes, which was the verse. ‘But what do we need to really set this song off? A big, fancy, bow in the hair would really set this song off.’ So when I got to the middle eight I wanted to go really erratic, almost like taTu on All The Things She Said. I wanted it to be proper fucked up and crazy – hands in the air.|$|E

5|$|Gaara's initial attire, {{along with}} the costumes of his siblings, was {{difficult}} for Kishimoto to draw on a weekly basis. Because of this, Kishimoto gave {{the three of them}} simpler costumes towards the end of Part I; Gaara received <b>an</b> <b>outfit</b> with an upright collar. In addition to being easier to draw, it was used to demonstrate the change in relationship between Gaara and Naruto following their previous fight. Kishimoto cites The Matrix, one of his favorite movies, as an inspiration for Gaara's new costume, and he considers it to be his favorite costume of the three siblings. For Part II, there was a scene where an antagonist Deidara was sitting on Gaara's body. This shot was inspired by Akira, a manga by Katsuhiro Otomo that Kishimoto was a fan of.|$|E

5|$|Cope {{took his}} family {{with him as}} far as Denver, while Hayden tried to keep Cope and Leidy from {{prospecting}} in the same area. Following a tip from geologist Fielding Bradford Meek, Cope also intended to investigate reports of bones Meek had found near Black Buttes Station and the railroad. Cope found the site and some skeletal remains of a dinosaur he dubbed Agathaumas sylvestris. Believing he had {{the full support of}} Hayden and the survey, Cope then traveled to Fort Bridger in June, only to find that the men, wagons, horses, and equipment he expected were not there. Cope cobbled together <b>an</b> <b>outfit</b> at his own expense, consisting of two teamsters, a cook, and a guide, along with three men from Chicago who were interested in studying with him. As it turned out, two of Cope's men were in fact in the employ of Marsh. When the rival paleontologist found out his own men were taking Cope's money, he was furious. While the men tried to assure Marsh they were still his men (one suggested he took the job in order to lead Cope away from good fossils), Marsh's laziness in soliciting firm agreements and payments may have caused them to seek other work. Cope's journey took the expedition through rugged country only Hayden had surveyed, and he discovered dozens of new species. Meanwhile, one of Marsh's men accidentally forwarded some of his material to Cope instead. On receiving the fossils, Cope sent them back to Marsh, but further damage had been done to their relationship.|$|E

5|$|In The King of Fighters '99 Iori is {{a secret}} {{character}} in most versions of the game. Iori can be faced as a bonus fight {{in the end of}} the game if the player manages to get a high score. In the story, Iori discovers the creation of Kyo clones and enters the annual tournament where he finds those responsible, an organization named NEST. Iori follows the battles in secret and fights against the Nests' agents to continue his fight against Kyo. An assistant version of his character, named Striker, also appears for Iori in The King of Fighters 2000 but with <b>an</b> <b>outfit</b> based on his illustrations from artbooks. In The King of Fighters 2001, an agent named Seth invites Iori to join his team for the next King of Fighters tournament, presuming that he would get his shot against Kyo. While his regular form appears in KOF 2002, his Orochi form is also featured in the PlayStation 2 port from the game as well as the remake of KOF '98. In The King of Fighters 2003, Chizuru appears to both Kyo and Iori, requesting that they form a team and investigate suspicious activities concerning the Orochi seal. During the investigation, the team is ambushed by the fighter Ash Crimson, who plans to get the power from the descendants of the clans who sealed Orochi and steals the ones from Chizuru. In the following video game, Iori and Kyo form a team once again with Kyo's student Shingo Yabuki to fill Chizuru's spot to stop Ash. At the end of the tournament, the strengthening presence of Orochi causes Iori to enter the Riot of Blood state, in which he attacks his comrades. Ash appears afterward and defeats Iori, stealing his powers. Iori is a playable character in The King of Fighters XII. Iori is featured with a different outfit, and with a new moveset, that does not use purple flames. Like each character, he does not have a team. Iori's appearance in The King of Fighters XIII sees him teamed with his former team members from the 1996 tournament, Mature and Vice, who return as spirits. He recovers his flames in his ending and appears as downloadable content in this form. He is set to return in the upcoming The King of Fighters XIV, and he is also the one who tracked Orochi's weakened body in the middle of Hungary when Verse's destructions scatters every revived souls including Orochi and Ash who were sealed inside the monster's across the globe after the tournament is over, thus sealing the weakened snake with the help from Kyo and Chizuru immediately.|$|E

25|$|As the cummerbund {{is seen as}} an {{extension}} of the trousers, traditionally it should the same colour, i.e. be black.

25|$|Some {{bands of}} this period were trying to build upon the music scene {{emerging}} in Manchester at the time (e.g. Lygiai Lyja, Šiaurės Kryptis) - often fairly successfully; while others preferred grunge, noise and psychedelic experiments (for example, SH, Empti, Blyškūs Veidai, Summerland, Dogbones). Skylė from Vilnius became the favorites of Lithuanian philology students due to their often acoustic, intimate sound and poetic lyrics.
