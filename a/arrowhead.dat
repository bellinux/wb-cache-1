A Bronze Age barbed and tanged <b>arrowhead</b> was found in a nearby field.|$|E
5|$|In 1926, {{when the}} U.S. Highway system was first announced, {{there was a}} gap in US-50 between Ely and Thistle. At the time the states of Utah and Nevada were feuding about which of the old auto trails would be paved and used for the new U.S. Highway System. Nevada favored the Lincoln Highway, which the modern US-50 closely follows in that state. Utah refused to {{consider}} the Lincoln Highway west of Salt Lake City. Officials perceived that route would carry all California bound traffic directly to Nevada while passing through very few communities in Utah. Utah instead favored the Victory Highway (modern Interstate 80 west of Salt Lake) and the <b>Arrowhead</b> Trail (modern Interstate 15). By favoring these routes Utah could force travelers destined for southern California to use a different route than those destined for northern California, with both of these traversing through more cities in Utah than the Lincoln Highway. The <b>Arrowhead</b> trail was especially beneficial to Utah as it passed through many communities in the state, but only Las Vegas in Nevada.|$|E

50|$|Anglo-Saxon <b>arrowheads</b> {{have been}} {{divided into three}} main types. The first group is leaf-shaped <b>arrowheads,</b> which {{typically}} contained a socket that allowed the head to {{be attached to the}} wooden shaft. The second group consists of bodkins. The third group is barbed <b>arrowheads,</b> which usually had a tang that was driven into the shaft or tied to it. Underwood suggested that the leaf-shaped and barbed <b>arrowheads</b> developed from arrows that were used for hunting. As for bodkins, he proposed that they were designed for use against armoured opponents—the long tapering point would pass through the chain links of mail or puncture the iron plate of a helmet if fired at close range.Due to the fact that <b>arrowheads</b> varied in size from 5.5 cm (2 inches) to 15.5 cm (6 inches), there is some degree of difficulty in distinguishing between the heads of large arrows and small javelins.|$|R

5|$|The {{crowd is}} {{notoriously}} loud during Seahawks games. It has twice held the Guinness World Record for loudest crowd roar {{at an outdoor}} stadium, first at 136.6 decibels in 2013, followed by a measurement of 137.6 decibels in 2014. Both records were eventually broken by crowds at <b>Arrowhead</b> Stadium in Kansas City, Missouri. The current record was set by fans at <b>Arrowhead</b> on September 29, 2014, in a Monday Night Football game against the New England Patriots, hitting 142.2 decibels. The noise {{has contributed to the}} team's home field advantage with an increase in false start (movement by an offensive player prior to the play) and delay of game (failure of the offense to snap the ball prior to the play clock expiring) penalties against visiting teams. The stadium was the first in the NFL to implement a FieldTurf artificial field. Numerous college and high school American football games have also been played at the stadium.|$|E
5|$|The {{excavators}} {{found an}} iron object under the skeleton's vertebrae and speculated {{it might be}} an <b>arrowhead</b> {{that had been embedded}} in its back.

The win was Cutler's 46th with the Bears, tying Jim McMahon for the most in team history.|$|E
40|$|Martiality, {{elites and}} burials are {{important}} topics in current Bronze Age studies. Instead of swords, spears and axes, this thesis focuses on Bronze Age archery, and examines {{one of the}} most durable material components of this practice: bronze <b>arrowheads.</b> Despite its durability, only 25 <b>arrowheads</b> make up the entire corpus of bronze <b>arrowheads</b> found in the Netherlands. All except one of those was found in burial mounds. This raises the question of how these objects were usually employed outside a funerary context. This thesis tries to move towards an answer to this question by first collecting and interpreting the knowledge on bronze age <b>arrowheads,</b> putting these objects in a wider framework. It then introduces some theories on the use of bows during the Bronze Age. Functional analysis was applied to the <b>arrowheads</b> of Hijken, Geldermalsen-Eigenblok and Sleen. This lead to some conclusions on the production and use of these objects. It appeared they were cast, and not cut out of sheet bronze, and after slight hammering were polished. No convincing traces of use were found. This, together with the data on the context of the <b>arrowheads,</b> lead to the conclusion that these objects were indeed weapons, and shared their function, efficient implements of killing as well as objects for show, with other weapons...|$|R

5|$|A flint <b>arrowhead</b> {{discovered}} in Sale suggests a prehistoric human {{presence at the}} location, {{but there is no}} further evidence of activity in the area until the Roman period. A 4th-century hoard of 46Roman coins was {{discovered in}} Ashton upon Mersey, one of four known hoards dating from that period discovered within the Mersey basin. Sale lies along the line of the Roman road which runs between the fortresses at Chester (Deva Victrix) and York (Eboracum), via the fort at Manchester (Mamucium); the present-day A56 follows the route of the road through the town. After the Roman departure from Britain in the early-5th century, Britain was invaded by the Anglo-Saxons.|$|E
5|$|Another {{option was}} to {{relocate}} to Anaheim, in the Greater Los Angeles area. The Houston Rockets had looked into relocation to Anaheim the previous season, with <b>Arrowhead</b> Pond of Anaheim (now Honda Center) as the home venue. However, the NHL team then known as the Mighty Ducks of Anaheim had an agreement that any other tenant at the Pond should share revenues with their then-owner, The Walt Disney Company, although Disney stated {{they were willing to}} negotiate the terms. There are also two existing clubs in Los Angeles, the Lakers and the Clippers, which would make the media market small and limit revenue.|$|E
5|$|Garnering a {{great degree}} of {{attention}} from the Mighty Ducks' fanbase, Kariya's first public practice at <b>Arrowhead</b> Pond drew an attendance of 9,000, while 16,000 fans watched his first exhibition game. Due to the NHL lockout, resulting from a dispute between players and owners, his regular season debut was delayed until January 1995 and the campaign was shortened to 48 games. During the suspension, Kariya participated in a charity tournament held in Hamilton, Ontario, sponsored by the National Hockey League Players' Association (NHLPA).|$|E

5|$|In 1862, Theodore Gill {{placed the}} winghead shark {{in its own}} genus Eusphyra, derived from the Greek eu ("good") and sphyra ("hammer"). However, {{subsequent}} authors did not accept Eusphyra and preferred to keep this species with the other hammerheads in the genus Sphyrna. Eusphyra was resurrected by Henry Bigelow and William Schroeder in 1948, and came into wider usage after additional taxonomic research was published by Leonard Compagno in 1979 and 1988. Nevertheless, some sources still refer to this species as Sphyrna blochii. Other common names for the winghead shark include <b>arrowhead,</b> arrow-headed hammerhead shark, and slender hammerhead.|$|E
5|$|In 2014, it was {{announced}} that new targeting and surveillance sensors were under development to provide high-resolution color imagery to crews, replacing older low definition black-and-white imaging systems. Lockheed received the first contract in January 2016, upgrading the <b>Arrowhead</b> turret to provide higher-resolution color imaging with longer ranges and a wider field of view. In 2014, the U.S. Army was adapting its Apaches for increased maritime performance as part of the Pentagon's rebalance to the Pacific. Additional avionics and sensor improvements includes an extended-range radar capable of detecting small ships in littoral environments, software adaptions to handle maritime targets, and adding Link 16 data-links for better communications with friendly assets.|$|E
