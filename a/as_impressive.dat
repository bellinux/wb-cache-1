5|$|Lasker's match {{record was}} <b>as</b> <b>impressive</b> between his 1896–97 re-match with Steinitz and 1914: he won {{all but one}} of his normal matches, and three of those were convincing {{defenses}} of his title. He first faced Marshall in the World Chess Championship 1907, when despite his aggressive style, Marshall could not win a single game, losing eight and drawing seven (final score: 11½−3½).|$|E
5|$|At least 20 {{publishers}} {{rejected the}} book before Geisel ran {{into an old}} college classmate, who had just become juvenile editor at Vanguard Press. Vanguard agreed to publish the book, and it met with high praise from critics upon release, though sales were not <b>as</b> <b>impressive.</b> Later analyses of the book have focused on its connections to Geisel's childhood; the street of the title is probably named after a street in Geisel's hometown of Springfield, Massachusetts. Geisel returned to fictionalized versions of Springfield in later books, and Marco appeared again in 1947 in the Dr. Seuss book McElligot's Pool.|$|E

It took nearly twenty years for the second {{official}} occurrence in NBA history. Andrei Kirilenko, on January 3, 2006, recorded a five-by-six against the Lakers. Though his numbers were not quite <b>as</b> <b>impressive</b> as Olajuwon's, Kirilenko performed the feat in regulation.|$|E
5|$|In the new year, Benfica {{suffered}} {{their first}} league loss, falling to second place and beginning their erratic spell. Despite a sterling League Cup (where they earned their first honour in four seasons), the club's league play was not <b>as</b> <b>impressive.</b> They battled Porto {{for first place}} until March, when they had another costly loss and were passed by Sporting CP. Benfica tried to retake {{second place in the}} remaining eight matches, but in early May, the club dropped five points, sealing their fate; they finished third, missing the UEFA Champions League for a second consecutive season.|$|E
5|$|Renaissance humanism {{recognised}} no {{mutually exclusive}} polarities between the sciences and the arts, and Leonardo's studies {{in science and}} engineering are sometimes considered <b>as</b> <b>impressive</b> and innovative as his artistic work. These studies were recorded in 13,000 pages of notes and drawings, which fuse art and natural philosophy (the forerunner of modern science). They were made and maintained daily throughout Leonardo's life and travels, as he made continual observations of the world around him.|$|E

That winter he visited New Zealand with MCC: he did relatively little with the bat, only twice passing 50 in 11 innings, but he did take his maiden wicket when he dismissed Wellington's Harold Monaghan.|$|E

25|$|By {{the end of}} the 2009–10 {{domestic}} season Smith had {{a first-class}} batting average of over 50 after just 13 first-class matches. While his first-class bowling average in the high forties was not <b>as</b> <b>impressive,</b> his bowling appeared to be steadily improving following some well-publicised mentoring and high praise from Shane Warne. In the final match of the season he took 7 for 64 in the second innings against South Australia.|$|E
25|$|Murdoch {{was more}} of an {{off-side}} player whose drives and cut strokes were regarded as among the best of his day; but his leg-side play was reputedly not so strong, and his ability against good spin bowling was not <b>as</b> <b>impressive</b> as it might be. Also, he was believed to be lacking in command against top-class pace bowling on difficult wickets; if conditions, were perfect, however, his batting often followed suit.|$|E
25|$|Sports {{at which}} Mission High School {{typically}} excels at include badminton (2004-2017 NCS champions), tennis (2004 and 2009 NCS champions), wrestling, golf and swimming (League champions for over 26 consecutive years).

Reviewers praised The Matrix for its innovative visual effects, cinematography and entertainment value. The film's premise was both criticized for being derivative of earlier science fiction works and praised for being intriguing. The action also polarized critics, some describing it <b>as</b> <b>impressive,</b> but others dismissing it as a trite distraction from an interesting premise.|$|E
25|$|The Tahirids were a local clan {{based in}} Rada'a. While {{they were not}} <b>as</b> <b>impressive</b> as their predecessors, they were still keen builders. They built schools, mosques, and {{irrigation}} channels, as well as water cisterns and bridges in Zabid, Aden, Rada'a, and Juban. Their best-known monument is the Amiriya Madrasa in Rada' District, which was built in 1504. The Tahiride were too weak either to contain the Zaydi imams or to defend themselves against foreign attacks. The Mamluks of Egypt tried to attach Yemen to Egypt and the Portuguese led by Afonso de Albuquerque, occupied Socotra and made an unsuccessful attack on Aden in 1513.|$|E
