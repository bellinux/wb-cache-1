5|$|Against this {{economic}} backdrop {{a new generation}} of venture capitalist owners had emerged. They took the place of the community groups, local consortiums, or philanthropists that typically had owned the teams and operated them without <b>any</b> <b>serious</b> profit motive. They were led by McNall in Toronto, Larry Ryckman in Calgary, and Glieberman in Ottawa.|$|E
5|$|By 1799, the {{fortress}} of Mantua {{on the river}} Mincio in northern Italy was in poor shape. It was commanded by viscount lieutenant general François-Philippe de Foissac-Latour (1750-1804) and garrisoned by a diverse force of 10,000, including French, Polish (Polish Legionnaires under general Józef Wielhorski), Italian (Republic of Alba and Cisalpine Republic), Swiss and German units. From {{the beginning of his}} assignment, Foissac-Latour, an engineer, was convinced that {{the fortress}} would be indefensible in <b>any</b> <b>serious</b> siege.|$|E
5|$|In 1896, Hugh Fulton {{organized}} 142 {{specific and}} varietal names into eighteen species groups containing {{a total of}} 64 species. When Henry Augustus Pilsbry's 1900 monograph Manual of Conchology appeared, {{the number of species}} in the genus Amphidromus had increased to 81, and these were placed in nineteen groups. Pilsbry's study has remained the only illustrated monograph of the genus, and it is still considered indispensable for <b>any</b> <b>serious</b> study of the genus.|$|E

5|$|In {{contrast}} with other international media reports, Peruvian health officials downplayed the incident. Jorge López Tejada, the Regional Health Director for Puno, Peru, denied <b>any</b> <b>serious</b> medical situation existed. However, a health brigade arrived with personnel and medication {{to the site}} on 18 September, reporting that the odors rising from the crater were causing medical issues. Earlier, Tejada had stated that the officers were dizzy, nauseous and some were vomiting.|$|E
5|$|The {{garden warbler}} {{has a very}} large range of 9,650,000km2 (3,700,000mi2), and its {{population}} in Europe is estimated at 17–31million breeding pairs. Allowing for birds breeding in Asia, the total population is between 54–124million individuals. There {{is no evidence of}} <b>any</b> <b>serious</b> decline in numbers, so it is classified by the International Union for Conservation of Nature as being of least concern.|$|E
5|$|Basil II was at {{that time}} in the eastern provinces of his empire, {{wintering}} on the plain of Tarsus following his campaign against the Fatimid dynasty in Syria. On hearing of David’s death he marched north-eastward to claim the lands David had promised to the emperor. The local Georgian and Armenian nobility submitted without <b>any</b> <b>serious</b> resistance. The only notable incident occurred when a quarrel between a Georgian soldier and a Varangian Guardsman over a bale of hay developed into a major fight, involving 6,000 Varangians and taking the lives of thirty Georgian high-ranking nobles.|$|E

5|$|In 799, {{the founder}} of the Aghlabid dynasty, Ibrahim ibn al-Aghlab, secured {{recognition}} of his position as autonomous emir of Ifriqiya by the Abbasid caliph, Harun al-Rashid, thereby marking the establishment of a practically independent state centred on modern Tunisia. In 805, Ibrahim concluded a ten-year truce with the Byzantine governor of Sicily, which was renewed by Ibrahim's son and successor Abdallah I in 813. During this time, the Aghlabids were too preoccupied with their rivalry with the Idrisids to the west to plan <b>any</b> <b>serious</b> assault on Sicily. Instead, there are testimonies of commercial traffic between Sicily and Ifriqiya, and of the presence of Arab traders on the island.|$|E
5|$|Mellitus fled {{first to}} Canterbury, but Æthelberht's {{successor}} Eadbald {{was also a}} pagan, so Mellitus, accompanied by Justus, took refuge in Gaul. Mellitus was recalled to Britain by Laurence, the second Archbishop of Canterbury, after his conversion of Eadbald. How long Mellitus' exile lasted is unclear. Bede claims it was a year, but {{it may have been}} longer. However, Mellitus did not return to London, because the East Saxons remained pagan. Although Mellitus fled, there {{does not seem to have}} been <b>any</b> <b>serious</b> persecution of Christians in the East Saxon kingdom. The East Saxon see was not occupied again until Cedd was consecrated as bishop in about 654.|$|E
5|$|Patients {{and their}} guardians must be apprised of <b>any</b> <b>serious</b> risks {{and the common}} side effects of pain treatments. What {{appears to be an}} {{obviously}} acceptable risk or harm to a professional may be unacceptable to the person who has to undertake that risk or experience the side effect. For instance, people who experience pain on movement may be willing to forgo strong opioids in order to enjoy alertness during their painless periods, whereas others would choose around-the-clock sedation so as to remain pain-free. The care provider should not insist on treatment that someone rejects, and must not provide treatment that the provider believes is more harmful or riskier than the possible benefits can justify.|$|E

5|$|Placing {{the engines}} within the wings had the {{advantage}} of a reduction in the risk of foreign object damage, which could seriously damage jet engines. The low-mounted engines and good placement of service panels also made aircraft maintenance easier to perform. However, the Comet's buried engine configuration increased its structural weight and complexity. Armour had to be placed around the engine cells to contain debris from <b>any</b> <b>serious</b> engine failures; also, placing the engines inside the wing required a more complicated wing structure.|$|E
5|$|The {{ketogenic}} diet {{is not a}} benign, holistic {{or natural}} treatment for epilepsy; as with <b>any</b> <b>serious</b> medical therapy, there may be complications. These are generally less severe and less frequent than with anticonvulsant medication or surgery. Common but easily treatable short-term side effects include constipation, low-grade acidosis and hypoglycaemia {{if there is an}} initial fast. Raised levels of lipids in the blood affect up to 60% of children and cholesterol levels may increase by around 30%. This can be treated by changes to the fat content of the diet, such as from saturated fats towards polyunsaturated fats, and, if persistent, by lowering the ketogenic ratio. Supplements are necessary to counter the dietary deficiency of many micronutrients.|$|E
5|$|Turner only {{learned that}} Stacey was Archie's killer {{half an hour}} before the episode aired, in a bid by the {{production}} team to maintain the storyline's secrecy. 51 EastEnders cast members appeared in the episode, with several expressing trepidation about performing live prior to the broadcast. Cast members had two weeks to rehearse the episode, with one rehearsal filmed in case of <b>any</b> <b>serious</b> problems during transmission. When Turner fell ill with the flu on the day of broadcast, it was feared the producers may have needed to use the pre-recorded tape, but in the event she recovered enough to appear.|$|E

5|$|Upon {{completion}} of a major overhaul at the New York Naval Shipyard, Wisconsin headed south for refresher training in the Caribbean Sea, later taking part in another Springboard exercise. During that cruise, she again visited Port-au-Prince and added Tampico, Mexico, and Cartagena, Colombia, to her list of ports of call. She returned to Norfolk {{on the last day}} of March 1955 for local operations. On 19 October, while operating in the East River in New York Harbor, Wisconsin was accidentally grounded. However, the ship was freed in about an hour without <b>any</b> <b>serious</b> damage.|$|E
5|$|A Danish {{fleet of}} 20 ships under Admiral Niels Juel put to sea in March 1676, and on 29 April his forces landed on Gotland, which surrendered. The Swedish fleet was ordered out on 4 May with 23 {{warships}} of over 50 guns, 21 {{of less than}} 50 and 16 minor supporting vessels manned by about 12,000 men, but encountered adverse winds and was delayed until 19 May. Juel had by then left Visby, the main port on Gotland, to join up with a smaller Danish-Dutch force at Bornholm, between {{the southern tip of}} Sweden and the northern coast of Germany. Together they intended to cruise between Scania and the island of Rügen to stop Swedish troops from landing on the island and reinforcing Swedish Pomerania. On 25–26 May the two fleets fought the indecisive battle at Bornholm. The Swedish force was superior in numbers but was unable to inflict <b>any</b> <b>serious</b> losses, and two of the fleet's fireships were captured, one by the allies and the other by a Brandenburg squadron headed for Copenhagen.|$|E
5|$|Across the Philippines, Typhoon Betty brought {{widespread}} flooding, {{which resulted}} in severe destruction. Damage added up to $100million (1987USD). In the Maguindanao and Albay provinces alone, 10,000people were evacuated and 1,000were homeless. However, {{the capital city of}} Manila avoided <b>any</b> <b>serious</b> damage. Nationwide, around 200,000people were reportedly homeless, 18,000of winch were from Marinduque and another 11,400resided on Mindoro Island. In the former, 4,000dwellings sustained damage, and all of the banana crop there was lost. In all, 25,518homes received damage. Roughly 400,000people were directly affected by the storm. Overall, 85people were killed and 324others were wounded. After striking the Philippines, six people were killed by Betty in Vietnam. Approximately 10,000structures were damaged and 103people were injured. Elsewhere, in northern Thailand, one person was killed and three others were hurt by the typhoon. Several villages were flooded, and numerous streets were damaged.|$|E

5|$|After Inhaúma had punched {{through the}} {{defenses}} at Curupayty, he encountered three large chains {{stretched across the}} river at Humaitá that prevented further progress upriver beyond the fortress. He anchored his ships in a cove that became known as Porto Elisiário (Elisiário Port). For six months, the Brazilian warships remained stationed between Curupayty and Humaitá, bombarding both strongholds without causing <b>any</b> <b>serious</b> damage. The encirclement of Humaitá could not be completed until the Allies gained full control of the river. The Allied commander-in-chief, Argentine president Bartolomé Mitre, had pressed Inhaúma for months to execute that goal. The Brazilian had, however, developed second thoughts about the enterprise and procrastinated. He believed—unfairly—that Mitre would welcome the destruction of Brazil's warships, severely weakening the Empire militarily and geopolitically.|$|E
5|$|After the mutineers sought {{asylum in}} Constanța, Romania, {{and after the}} Russians {{recovered}} the ship, its name was changed to Panteleimon. It accidentally sank a Russian submarine in 1909 and was badly damaged when it ran aground in 1911. During World War I, Panteleimon participated in the Battle of Cape Sarych in late 1914. It covered several bombardments of the Bosphorus fortifications in early 1915, including one where it was attacked by the Turkish battlecruiser Yavuz Sultan Selim – Panteleimon and the other Russian pre-dreadnoughts present drove it off before it could inflict <b>any</b> <b>serious</b> damage. The ship was relegated to secondary roles after Russia's first dreadnought battleship entered service in late 1915. It was by then obsolete and was reduced to reserve in 1918 in Sevastopol.|$|E
5|$|Around 1960, ANAK held {{a series}} of secret dinner {{meetings}} with the families of Ford Greene, Ralph A. Long, Jr. and Lawrence Michael Williams, Georgia Tech's first three African American students. The goal of these meetings, facilitated through the Georgia Tech YMCA, was to discuss the range of potential situations that could arise when the three students enrolled at Georgia Tech the following year, as well as appropriate reactions to each of these situations. When Greene, Long, and Williams enrolled in the fall semester of 1961, ANAK members discreetly kept a close watch on the three students for the first two weeks to ensure their safety. As a result of ANAK's efforts and those of other Institute and city organizations, none of the students was involved in <b>any</b> <b>serious</b> incident, paving the way for continued peaceful racial integration.|$|E
