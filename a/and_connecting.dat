40|$|International audienceWe give a {{constructive}} {{proof of the}} equality between treewidth <b>and</b> <b>connected</b> treewidth. More precisely, we describe an O(nk^ 3) -time algorithm that, given any n-node width-k tree-decomposition of a connected graph G, returns a connected tree-decomposition of G of width ≤ k. The equality between treewidth <b>and</b> <b>connected</b> treewidth finds applications in graph searching problems. First, using equality between treewidth <b>and</b> <b>connected</b> treewidth, we prove that the connected search number (G) of a connected graph G is at most n+ 1 times larger than its search number.

5|$|Gephart was {{not only}} {{president}} of the iron company (and the Nittany Valley Railroad, still an affiliate), but an active railroad promoter in another direction. He {{became president of the}} Central Railroad of Pennsylvania, which, on December 2, 1893, opened its line from Mill Hall to Bellefonte, crossing <b>and</b> <b>connecting</b> with the Nittany Valley about a mile east of Bellefonte. The new line connected with the Beech Creek Railroad, controlled by the Pennsylvania Railroad's rival, the New York Central Railroad.|$|E
5|$|In 1826, a forge {{was built}} on Catawissa Creek for making bar iron. By the late 1820s, there were {{plans to build a}} {{railroad}} paralleling Catawissa Creek <b>and</b> <b>connecting</b> Catawissa with Pottsville. The Catawissa Railroad, which was built in the 1830s, paralleled Catawissa Creek for part of its course. Another railroad that historically paralleled Catawissa Creek was the Danville, Hazleton and Wilkes-Barre Railroad, which was built in 1870. A paper mill was established on Catawissa Creek in Catawissa in 1811. In the late 19th century a dam {{was built on}} Catawissa Creek in Beaver Township.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 2000s, the Lackawanna River Watershed Conservation Plan {{recommended}} constructing a greenway <b>and</b> <b>connecting</b> trail along Roaring Brook. Planned trails in the greenway include the North Pocono rail trail and {{a link to}} the Nay Aug Park. The conservation plan recommended linking such a trail to the Lackawanna River Heritage Trail. A proposed pedestrian loop trail would have a footbridge over the stream.|$|E

5|$|In {{this region}} Cofresí's {{influence}} extended to {{government and the}} military, with the Ramírez de Arellano family involved in the smuggling and sale of his loot. On land the loot, hidden in sacks and barrels, was brought to Mayagüez, Hormigueros or San Germán for distribution. When Beluche returned to Colombia, he published an article critical {{of the situation in}} the press. La Gaceta de Puerto Rico countered, accusing him of stealing Bonne Sophie <b>and</b> <b>connecting</b> him to the pirates.|$|E

By halftime, Manning had connected on another touchdown pass, this one a 23-yard strike to Leon Felts.

5|$|NY8 {{begins at}} NY 10 at the southeastern {{edge of the}} Cannonsville Reservoir {{northeast}} of Deposit. While NY10 follows {{the southern edge of}} the reservoir to the east, NY8 continues north, passing to the east of Oquaga Creek State Park (<b>and</b> <b>connecting</b> to the park via a pair of local roads) before meeting NY206 in Masonville. From Masonville, NY8 heads north to Sidney, where it meets I-88 at an interchange, crosses the Susquehanna River, and intersects NY7 before leaving the village adjacent to the Unadilla River, a tributary of the Susquehanna.|$|E

5|$|North of CR22, Rutgers Creek {{merges with}} Indigot Creek, a small stream forming {{part of the}} Minisink–Wawayanda town line. The {{combined}} stream continues {{to serve as the}} boundary between the two towns as Rutgers Creek takes on a southeasterly course from this point. NY284 crosses over the waterway, entering Wawayanda <b>and</b> <b>connecting</b> to CR93 (Lime Kiln Road) just north of the town line. From CR93, the highway runs northeastward across open, rolling terrain, following an active part of the MNJ Railroad to the hamlet of Slate Hill. NY284 ends {{in the center of the}} community at a junction with US6.|$|E
5|$|North of Highway554, {{the route}} is {{generally}} {{parallel to the}} river and Mississagi River Provincial Park. After passing west of Wakomata Lake on its journey through completely undeveloped forest and muskeg, it reaches a junction with Highway556 southwest of Aubrey Falls Provincial Park. Thereafter, the highway roughly follows the Wenebegon River through Wenebegon River Provincial Park to Wenebegon Lake. Highway129 encounters the entrance to Five Mile Provincial Park and meets Highway667, which travels east through Sultan, becoming the Sultan Industrial Road <b>and</b> <b>connecting</b> with Highway144.|$|E

5|$|Surface {{supplied}} divers may {{be supplied}} with a gas mixture suitable for accelerated decompression by connecting a {{supply to the}} surface gas panel <b>and</b> <b>connecting</b> it through the valve system to the divers. This allows accelerated decompression, usually on oxygen, {{which can be used}} to a maximum depth of 20ft (6m) in water for scuba and 30ft (9m) on surface supply. Surface supplied heliox bounce divers will be provided with mixtures suitable for their current depth, and the mixture may be changed several times during descent and ascent from great depths.|$|E
5|$|With the {{construction}} of the extensions <b>and</b> <b>connecting</b> turnpikes, the highway was envisioned {{to be a part of}} a system of toll roads stretching from Maine to Chicago. When the Delaware River Bridge was completed in 1956, a motorist could drive from New York City to Indiana on limited-access toll roads. By 1957, it was possible to drive from New York City to Chicago without encountering a traffic signal.|$|E
5|$|Although the {{extension}} of the railway was completed in 1976, work in the vicinity continued with the creation of footpaths connecting to the new station. A new footbridge was built crossing the Nant Gwernol gorge <b>and</b> <b>connecting</b> the station with the existing path {{on the east side of}} the river. The bridge and paths were opened on 3 May 1980 by Lord Parry, the chairman of the Wales Tourist Board. By the mid-1970s, it had become clear that passenger numbers were no longer increasing. After 1973, the peak year for passengers on the Talyllyn with 186,000passenger journeys made, numbers were to decline consistently until the 1990s. Preliminary work on the conversion of Irish Pete for use on the Talyllyn, which had begun in the early 1970s, was put on hold in 1975 and the chassis and boiler were put into storage at Pendre.|$|E
