5|$|As {{part of the}} Nixon Doctrine {{that the}} U.S. would avoid direct combat {{assistance}} to allies where possible, instead giving them assistance to defend themselves, the U.S. greatly increased arms sales to the Middle East—particularly Israel, Iran and Saudi Arabia—during the Nixon administration. The Nixon administration strongly supported Israel, an American ally in the Middle East, but the support was not unconditional. Nixon believed that Israel should make peace with its Arab neighbors and that the United States should encourage it. The president believed that—except during the Suez Crisis—the U.S. had failed to intervene with Israel, and should use the leverage of the large U.S. military aid to Israel to urge {{the parties to the}} negotiating table. The Arab-Israeli conflict was not a major focus of Nixon's attention during his first term—for one thing, he felt that no matter what he did, <b>American</b> <b>Jews</b> would oppose his reelection.|$|E
5|$|Following Anwar Sadat's {{ascension}} to the Egyptian presidency, Libya's {{relations with}} Egypt deteriorated. Over the coming years, the two {{slipped into a}} state of cold war. Sadat was perturbed by Gaddafi's unpredictability and insistence that Egypt required a cultural revolution akin to that being carried out in Libya. In February 1973, Israeli forces shot down Libyan Arab Airlines Flight 114, which had strayed from Egyptian airspace into Israeli-held territory during a sandstorm. Gaddafi was infuriated that Egypt had not done more to prevent the incident, and in retaliation planned to destroy the , a British ship chartered by <b>American</b> <b>Jews</b> to sail to Haifa for Israel's 25th anniversary. Gaddafi ordered an Egyptian submarine to target the ship, but Sadat cancelled the order, fearing a military escalation.|$|E

40|$|The rise of {{multiculturalism}} has meant {{somewhat of a}} crisis to the <b>American</b> <b>Jew.</b> During {{the second half of}} the 20 th century Jewish Americans gradually merged into the American mainstream. They became white, but still held on to their own particularities. They have become part of two cultures, and therfore have a double social status, they are both insider and outsider. Multiculturalism turned American society upside down, and had a great impact on the <b>American</b> <b>Jew</b> as well. Following the lead of other American minorities the <b>American</b> <b>Jew</b> started to trace his roots. Today Jewish Americans are excluded from the multicultural debate because the are not considered to be "ethnic" enough. The Baal T'shuvah phenomenon (return to religion) is an example of how the <b>American</b> <b>Jew</b> responded to their double social status. In my thesis I claim that due to the diversity present within the dramatisation of the Baal T'shuvah phenomenon, the Jewish American experience, and therfore Jewish American fiction should be included in today's multicultural debate...|$|R
