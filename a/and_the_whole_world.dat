They may also be treated in a comic or parodic vein.|$|E
25|$|Blessed Alexandrina Maria da Costa, from Balazar, was a Portuguese mystic who {{reported}} many private apparitions, messages and prophecies received directly from Jesus and Virgin Mary. In June 1938, {{based on the}} request of her spiritual director, Father Mariano Pinho, several bishops from Portugal wrote to Pope Pius XI, asking him to consecrate {{the world to the}} Immaculate Heart of Mary. In June 1938, Father Mariano Pinho, conducted a retreat at Fátima, Portugal, for the Portuguese bishops, {{at the end of which}} the bishops forwarded their own request to Pius XI for the consecration of the world to the Immaculate Heart of Mary. This request was renewed several times. At that time Cardinal Eugenio Pacelli (later Pope Pius XII) was the secretary of the state of the Vatican. On October 31, 1942, Pius XII made a solemn Act of Consecration of the Church <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> <b>world</b> to the Immaculate Heart of Mary, joined by the bishops of Portugal, gathered at the Cathedral in Lisbon. Pius spoke by radio, in Portuguese, to an audience of thousands of pilgrims who had come to Fátima to celebrate the twenty-fifth anniversary of the last apparition of Our Lady.|$|E

At least 2,000 local Muslims were subsequently killed in Foča by forces under Ostojić's command.|$|E

2500|$|... "Everybody is {{born to be}} a genius. If a child's talent cannot blossom the way it should, {{that is not the}} child's fault, but {{the school}} system and the {{environment}} he lives in. The responsibility of the parent is tiny, because most parents have never been trained to be teachers. When something is wrong with our car, our watch or our house, we call a professional to fix it. No one wants to repair these himself. In modern society, {{it is not enough to}} love the children. No seed will become a flower just because it gets love. It also needs professional care and nursing to bloom. So if we do not nurse and protect the child's talent, he will become a gloomy adult <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> <b>world</b> will be poorer. The true values of a nation are in the souls and minds of its people, not in the vaults of the National Bank." ...|$|E

During the service there was a powerful thunderstorm, streaks of lightning flashed one after the other, and {{it seemed as if the}} peals of thunder would shake even the church <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> <b>world</b> to its foundations. Suddenly it became quite dark, a blast of wind from the open door blew out the flame of the candles which were lit in front of the iconostasis, there was a long clap of thunder, louder than before, and I suddenly saw a fiery ball flying from the window straight towards the head of the Emperor. The ball (it was of lightning) whirled around the floor, then passed the chandelier and flew out through the door into the park. My heart froze, I glanced at my grandfather– his face was completely calm. He crossed himself just as calmly as he had when the fiery ball had flown near us, and I felt that it was unseemly and not courageous to be frightened as I was. I felt that one had only to look at what was happening and believe in the mercy of God, as he, my grandfather, did. After the ball had passed through the whole church, and suddenly gone out through the door, I again looked at my grandfather. A faint smile was on his face, and he nodded his head at me. My panic disappeared, and from that time I had no more fear of storms." ...|$|E
