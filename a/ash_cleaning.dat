40|$|Diesel {{particulate}} filters (DPF) {{have seen}} widespread use in on- and off-road applications {{as an effective}} means for meeting increasingly stringent particle emissions regulations. Over time, incombustible material or ash, primarily derived from metallic additives in the engine lubricant, accumulates in the DPF. Ash accumulation leads to increased flow restriction and an associated increase in pressure drop across the particulate filter, negatively impacting engine performance and fuel economy, and eventually requiring filter removal for <b>ash</b> <b>cleaning.</b> While the adverse effects of ash accumulation on DPF performance are well known, the fundamental underlying mechanisms controlling these effects are not. This work explores the parameters influencing key ash properties such as porosity and permeability, and factors controlling the soot deposition - ash formation/accumulation process, which ultimately determines {{the magnitude of the}} ash effect on DPF pressure drop. In addition to the ash properties, the location of ash deposit accumulation inside the DPF channels, whether in a cake layer along the filter walls or packed in a plug {{at the rear of the}} channels, also plays a major role in influencing DPF pressure drop. Through a combined approach employing targeted experiments and theoretical models, explanations for the key factors and processes controlling ash properties and their effects on DPF pressure drop were developed. (cont.) These results, among few fundamental data of this kind, correlate changes in diesel particulate filter performance with lubricant chemistry, exhaust conditions, and ash morphological characteristics. Results are useful in optimizing the design of the combined engine-aftertreatment-lubricant system for future diesel engines, balancing the requirements of additives for adequate engine protection with the requirements for robust aftertreatment systems. by Alexander Sappok.

A specialized experiment was set up by running three different lubricants, each with its own unique additive tracer, sequentially through a diesel burner system. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was used to analyze the evolution of the ash deposits in the DPF samples in order to explain the specific mechanisms and processes controlling ash properties and their effect on DPF pressure drop. The experimental results were compared and correlated with previous DPF test data and theoretical models, providing additional insight to optimize diesel particulate filter performance. The results are useful in optimizing the design of the engine, aftertreatment, and lubricant systems for future diesel engines, balancing the requirements of additives for adequate engine protection with the requirements for robust after treatment systems. by Ryan Morrow.

40|$|Though we must {{eventually}} find {{viable alternatives}} for fossil fuels in {{large segments of}} the energy market, there are economically attractive fossil fuel alternatives today for niche markets. The easiest fossil fuels to replace are those with the highest cost and that provide the lowest-grade energy. Stationary heating with oil is one example of low quality use of a high quality fuel. Solid biomass fuels such as wood-pellets, switchgrass-pellets, and corn can displace up to 2 % of the U. S. petroleum market through displacing oil used in home and commercial heating. Current technologies are inexpensive enough to enable consumers to save money by heating with solid bio-fuels instead of oil. Although these systems are currently difficult to operate, future systems can increase usability and potentially further reduce costs. Key developments for future adoption are fuel handling and <b>ash</b> <b>cleaning</b> automation as well as emissions reductions. These technologies exist in other industries, such as agriculture, but have not yet been integrated into U. S. solid bio-fuel heating systems. Solid bio-fuel heating is more effective at reducing environmental damage and increasing energy security than corn-ethanol. Net CO 2 emissions from solid bio-fuel heating are 75 % lower than oil heating, in contrast to the nearly equivalent CO 2 emissions between corn-ethanol and gasoline. (cont.) The total solid bio-fuel system evaluated included fuel feedstock cultivation, harvesting, processing, and processed fuel distribution. Solid bio-fuel heating also enables cellulosic feedstocks use today. Solid bio-fuel heating also displaces twice the oil of corn-ethanol for the same amount of corn consumed, displacing 7 to 11 times the petroleum consumed during solid bio-fuel production and distribution. Solid bio-fuels are also less likely to negatively impact the food supply, because heating oil demand matches biomass fuel supply more closely than transportation fuel demand. This decreases the likelihood of price shocks in the food supply. This paper does not advocate using food for fuel, but does show that burning corn for heat is a more energy and cost effective use for the limited food supply than corn-ethanol. Low grade biomass fuels provide the ecological benefits of alternative fuels while economically benefiting consumers. Solid bio-fuel heating is economically competitive with heating oil, utilizes existing infrastructures and technologies, and provides measurable reductions in oil consumption and greenhouse gas emissions. by John Robert Pendray.

However, if it is used in some other process such as feedstock it may be considered as co-product (Brown 2003). People in Indian villages use cow dung for cooking purpose by direct burning. It is also used in plastering of walls and floor in rural houses for providing insulation during winter and summer.

40|$|As device {{features}} {{scale down}} to 90 nm and Cu/low-k films are employed for back end interconnects, post etch and <b>ash</b> residue <b>cleaning</b> becomes increasingly challenging {{due to the}} higher aspect ratio of the features, tighter CD control requirements, sensitivity of the low-k films, and the requirement for high wet etch selectivity between CuxO and Cu. Traditional solvent based cleaning in wet benches has additional issues such as wafer cross-contamination and high disposal cost [1, 2]. We have developed a novel aqueous solution (AQ) based single wafer cleaning process to address these challenges. The results of physical characterization, process integration electrical data, and process integration reliability data such as electromigration (EM) and stress migration data are presented. The main conclusions can be summarized as follows: (1) The single wafer cleaning process developed on the Oasis ™ system can clean post etch residues and simultaneously clean the wafer front side and backside metallic contaminants; (2) In terms CuxO and Cu wet etch selectivity, CD loss control, the Oasis ™ aqueous single wafer clean process is superior to the bench solvent cleaning process; (3) The Oasis aqueous cleaning process shows no undercut below etchstop due to the very low Cu etch amount in one cleaning pass, therefore the electromigration and stress migration performance of the aqueous Oasis processed wafers is clearly better {{than that of the}} solvent bench processed wafers...|$|R

40|$|Coal {{gasification}} and {{the subsequent}} production of electricity from syngas in combined-cycle powerplants allows plant efficiencies of up to 43 % (LHV). Exsisting technologies allow up to 50 % in the short term. Efficiencies beyond 50 % however, require concepts and technologies that still need {{a certain amount of}} research and development. One such method to raise plant efficiencies would be a high temperature (at temperatures above the melting point of the <b>ash)</b> syngas <b>cleaning.</b> To effectively utilize the heat from the syngas and enable high turbine inlet temperatures, it is necessary to remove slag particles from the hot gas. The feasibilty of such a hot syngas cleaning has been successfully demonstrated for the Pressurized Pulverized Coal Combustion (PPCC) by passing the hot gas through a bed of ceramic balls for slag removal. In order to apply this concept to IGCC powerplants the slag resistance of various ceramic materials had to be investigated under gasifying conditions. Therefore, lab-made ceramics and commercially available refractory materials where treated with liquid slag at 1600 °C in a number of reducing atmospheres. At first, three synthetic slags with different basicity were used and after evaluating the results, selected materials were treated with a gasifier slag under continuous conditions. It was shown that both slag and ceramic have to be adjusted to ensure a sufficiant corrosion resistance of the ceramic bed for slag removal. Furthermore, the impact of the porosity of the utilized ceramic on the corrosion resistance was shown. The composition of the reducing atmosphere (mainly the partial pressure of Oxygen) affected both pysical and chemical properties of the slag via slag components that could easily be reduced or oxidized. The materials most suitable for use in slag separation were found to be dense Chromiumoxide and other ceramics containing a high amount of Chromiumoxide...|$|R

The collection efficiency of ceramic filtration catcher (h) can reach even exceed 99. 9 %, and the error of sampling in different velocities is {{less than or equal}} to 5 %. All these make the sameness between samples and the actual fly ash in many facets, including size distribution, carbon content, element compositions, etc. The coefficient of optimizing ringed electrode for concentric cirques k is 14. 6, which can adapt all kinds of fly ash whose specific resistivity is in the range from 104 to 1013 cm×W. In addition, the ceramic filtration catcher made of white corundum powder can endure high temperature, high voltage, and acid cauterization. So this test instrument can work well under the conditions in which the flue temperature is from room temperature to 300 oC and in the caustic gas. Ceramic filtration catcher also has many excellences, such as avoiding disassembly, <b>cleaning</b> <b>ash</b> easily, repeating use for long time.

40|$|Handling of air {{pollution}} control (APC) residues from {{municipal solid waste incineration}} (MSWI) is a challenge due to its toxicity and high leaching of toxic elements and salts. Electrodialysis (ED) of the material has shown potential for reduction of leaching of toxic elements and salts to produce a material feasible for substitution of cement in mortar. In this work results of 23 pilot-scale experiments (5 - 8 kg APC residue each) in electrodialysis stack designed to investigate the leaching properties as a function of time and current density for APC residue from semi-dry and wet flue-gas cleaning systems, as well as MSWI fly <b>ash</b> without flue-gas <b>cleaning</b> products are reported. Significant leaching reduction of the critical elements Pb, Zn and Cl was obtained. The final leaching, however, depended mostly on the initial leaching, thus as leaching from fly ash and residue of wet flue-gas cleaning was lower before treatment compared to residues from semidry flue-gas cleaning, both Pb and Zn leaching could be reduced to lower levels in those materials, and they therefore appear more suitable for use in construction materials. The leaching reduction of Zn and to some degree Pb decreased with longer retention times and higher current densities. Cr and SO 4 leaching increased during ED treatment, with lower increase at higher current. Washing or carbonation in combination with ED significantly reduced leaching of Pb and Zn from semidry residue. An indication of a similar effect to carbonation by simultaneous aeration with ED was observed and should be investigated further. While Mn and Mo leaching did not, Se, V and Sb leaching exceeded threshold values in semidry residue. The leaching of V seemed to increase while Se and Sb remained more or less constant during ED treatment. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R
