25|$|Career {{records for}} batting average are usually {{subject to a}} minimum {{qualification}} of 20 innings played or completed, in order to exclude batsmen who have not played enough games for their skill to be reliably assessed. Under this qualification, the highest Test batting average belongs to Australia's Sir Donald Bradman, with 99.94. Given that a career batting average over 50 is exceptional, and that only four other players have averages over 60, this is an outstanding statistic. The fact that Bradman's average is so far above {{that of any other}} cricketer has led several statisticians to argue that, statistically <b>at</b> <b>least,</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> the greatest sportsman in any sport. As at 21 October 2016, Adam Voges of Australia has recorded an average of 72.75 from 27 innings played, but only 20 innings completed.|$|E
500|$|In the August 1917 {{edition of}} the {{magazine}} Electrical Experimenter, Tesla postulated that electricity {{could be used to}} locate submarines via using the reflection of an [...] "electric ray" [...] of [...] "tremendous frequency," [...] with the signal being viewed on a fluorescent screen (a system that has been noted to have a superficial resemblance to modern radar). Tesla was incorrect in his assumption that high frequency radio waves would penetrate water. Émile Girardeau, who helped develop France's first radar system in the 1930s, noted in 1953 that Tesla's general speculation that a very strong high-frequency signal would be needed was correct. Girardeau said, [...] "(Tesla) was prophesying or dreaming, since he had at his disposal no means of carrying them out, but one must add that if he was dreaming, <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> dreaming correctly." ...|$|E

2500|$|As armed {{conflict}} {{broke out in}} Cuba between rebels led by Fidel Castro and the Batista government, the U.S. was urged to end arms sales to Batista by Cuban president-in-waiting Manuel Urrutia Lleó. Washington made the critical move in March 1958 to prevent sales of rifles to Batista's forces, thus changing {{the course of the}} revolution irreversibly towards the rebels. The move was vehemently opposed by U.S. ambassador Earl T. Smith, and led U.S. State Department adviser William Wieland to lament that [...] "I know Batista is considered by many as a son of a bitch... but American interests come first... <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> our son of a bitch." ...|$|E
2500|$|Despite its flaws - legal {{historian}} Paul Finkelman describes Tucker's plan as [...] "simultaneously visionary, philanthropic, racist, vicious, utterly impractical, internally inconsistent, and hopelessly complex" [...] - modern scholars {{recognize the}} Dissertations significance {{as the first}} genuine effort by a Southerner to effect emancipation in his state. Finkelman notes that [...] "Tucker had the strength of character to explore the problem <b>at</b> <b>least.</b> <b>He</b> <b>was</b> a true academic intellectual who used his skills as a thinker and writer in an attempt, however futile, to stimulate a serious discussion {{about the problem of}} slavery in Virginia." [...] Historian Clyde N. Wilson says that [...] "(p)erhaps the most important things about Tucker's essay for later times are the following: it shows the potential in the South for constructively addressing the most difficult issue in American society before the time when it became necessary to defend against outside control; and, it demonstrates that Tucker's state rights understanding of the Constitution is not merely a rationalization in defense of slavery." ...|$|E

[...] "Joe Jelke and {{two other}} boys were along, {{and none of the}} three could manage to take their eyes off her, even to say hello to me. She had one of those {{exquisite}} rose skins frequent in our part of the country, and beautiful until the little veins begin to break at about forty; now, flushed with the cold, it was a riot of lovely delicate pinks like many carnations. She and Joe had reached some sort of reconciliation, or <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> too far gone in love to remember last night; but I saw that though she laughed a lot she wasn't really paying any attention to him or any of them. She wanted them to go, so that there'd be a message from the kitchen, but I knew that the message wasn't coming—that she was safe. There was talk of the Pump and Slipper dance at New Haven and of the Princeton Prom, and then, in various moods, we four left and separated quickly outside. I walked home with a certain depression of spirit and lay for an hour in a hot bath thinking that vacation was all over for me now that she was gone; feeling, even more deeply than I had yesterday, that she was out of my life." ...|$|E
