5|$|Many of Weber's works famous {{today were}} collected, revised and {{published}} posthumously. Significant interpretations of his writings were produced by such sociological luminaries as Talcott Parsons and C. Wright Mills. Parsons in particular imparted to Weber's works a functionalist, teleological perspective; this personal interpretation has been criticised for <b>a</b> <b>latent</b> conservatism.|$|E
5|$|Progression from TB {{infection}} to overt TB disease {{occurs when}} the bacilli overcome the immune system defenses and begin to multiply. In primary TB disease (some 1–5% of cases), this occurs soon after the initial infection. However, {{in the majority of}} cases, <b>a</b> <b>latent</b> infection occurs with no obvious symptoms. These dormant bacilli produce active tuberculosis in 5–10% of these latent cases, often many years after infection.|$|E
5|$|Homosexuality {{addressed}} by television started much later than films. Local talk {{shows in the}} late 1950s first addressed homosexuality by inviting panels of experts (usually not gay themselves) to discuss the problems of gay men in society. Lesbianism was rarely included. The first time a lesbian was portrayed on network television was the NBC drama The Eleventh Hour in the early 1960s, in a teleplay about an actress who feels she is persecuted by her female director, and in distress, calls a psychiatrist who explains she is <b>a</b> <b>latent</b> lesbian who has deep-rooted guilt about her feelings for women. When she realizes this, however, {{she is able to}} pursue healthy heterosexual relationships.|$|E

The deflation technique is required for finding another latent pair starting from <b>a</b> computed <b>latent</b> pair.

5|$|That night, Jack tells {{everyone}} that he trusts Juliet {{and that should}} be enough, but Sayid disagrees. Jack continues to explain that John Locke blew up the submarine that was to take him home. Claire suddenly collapses with blood gushing from her face. Juliet takes Jack and Kate aside and tells them she knows what's wrong with Claire because she did it to her. At the camp, Juliet explains that Claire's immune system has turned against her due to <b>a</b> <b>latent</b> reaction to medication in her bloodstream. The medication was designed by Juliet to keep Claire alive during her pregnancy. She was brought to the island to find out why women couldn't have children. The mother's body treats the pregnancy as a foreign invader and the immune system attacks; every pregnant woman on the island has died. Claire was the first to survive even though she showed some of the symptoms.|$|E
5|$|The {{period of}} time between an injury and {{development}} of epilepsy varies, {{and it is not}} uncommon for an injury to be followed by <b>a</b> <b>latent</b> period with no recurrent seizures. The longer a person goes without developing seizures, the lower the chances are that epilepsy will develop. At least 80–90% of people with PTE have their first seizure within two years of the TBI. People with no seizures within three years of the injury have only a 5% chance of developing epilepsy. However, one study found that head trauma survivors are at an increased risk for PTE as many as 10years after moderate TBI and over 20years after severe TBI. Since head trauma is fairly common and epilepsy can occur late after the injury, it can be difficult to determine whether a case of epilepsy resulted from head trauma in the past or whether the trauma was incidental.|$|E

25|$|Actions and {{emotions}} {{in the current}} lifetime affect future incarnations depending {{on the nature of}} the particular karma. For example, a good and virtuous life indicates <b>a</b> <b>latent</b> desire to experience good and virtuous themes of life. Therefore, such a person attracts karma that ensures that his future births will allow him to experience and manifest his virtues and good feelings unhindered. In this case, he may take birth in heaven or in a prosperous and virtuous human family. On the other hand, a person who has indulged in immoral deeds, or with a cruel disposition, indicates <b>a</b> <b>latent</b> desire to experience cruel themes of life. As a natural consequence, he will attract karma which will ensure that he is reincarnated in hell, or in lower life forms, to enable his soul to experience the cruel themes of life.|$|E

40|$|This article proposes <b>a</b> general <b>latent</b> {{variable}} {{approach to}} discrete-time {{survival analysis of}} nonrepeatable events such as onset of drug use. It is showvn how the survival analysis can beformulated as <b>a</b> generalized <b>latent</b> class analysis of event history indicators. The latent class analysis can use covariates and can be combined wvith the joint modeling of other outcomes such as repeated measures for a related process. It is shown that conventional discrete-time survival analysis corresponds to <b>a</b> single-class <b>latent</b> class analysis. Multiple-class extensions are proposed, including the special cases of a class of long-term survivors and classes defined by outcomes related to survivaL The estimation uses <b>a</b> general <b>latent</b> variable framework, including both categorical and continuous latent variables and incorporated in the Mplus program. Estimation is carried out using maximum likelihood via the EM algorithm. Two examples serve as illustrations.

When these immigrants arrived en masse in Salonica, they were excluded from the economic system. Consequently, some of these outcasts watched the Jewish population with hostility. The Jewish people were more economically integrated and therefore better off, which the immigrants equated with the former Ottoman power.|$|E

In this paper, we present a large-margin learning framework to discover <b>a</b> predictive <b>latent</b> subspace representation shared by multiple views.

We provide efficient inference and parameter estimation methods for the latent subspace model. Finally, we demonstrate the advantages of large-margin learning on real video and web image data for discovering predictive latent representations and improving the performance on image classification, annotation and retrieval. ...|$|R
30|$|<b>As</b> <b>latent</b> cardiac failure {{can become}} evident during stress, a stress {{echocardiography}} (using dobutamine to assess diastolic function {{as well as}} ephedrine to evaluate functional mitral regurgitation) was recently used to identify stress-related myocardial dysfunction during the weaning period in patients with resolved cardiogenic shock who experienced weaning failure [54].

30|$|<b>As</b> <b>latent</b> {{topics are}} learned in a {{completely}} unsupervised manner, {{it is not possible}} to precisely associate a particular semantic concept to each latent topic. However, images with identical latent topic representations are assumed to contain same semantic concepts and are treated as semantically similar while measuring image similarity. Hence, the notion of latent topics considerably minimizes the semantic loss associated with BoVW model and thus increases the discriminative power of the resulting image representation.|$|R
