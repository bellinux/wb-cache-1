40|$|Current {{design of}} <b>analog</b> <b>integrated</b> <b>circuits</b> {{is still a}} {{time-consuming}} manual process resulting in static analog blocks which can hardly be reused. In order to address this problem, a new framework to ease reuse-centric bottom-up design of <b>analog</b> <b>integrated</b> <b>circuits</b> is introduced. Our IIP Framework (IIP: Intelligent Intellectual Property) enables the development of highly technology-independent analog circuit generators applicable in multiple design environments. IIP Generators are parameterizable descriptions of each view of an analog block, i. e., layout, schematic, and symbol. They allow the adaptation of complex layouts within seconds to minutes in order to incorporate hardly estimable parasitics and further considerations into the design flow. Due to the abstract generator description, valid design data is created for very different technologies such as 28 nm and 180 nm bulk CMOS, 28 nm FD-SOI, and others. The design experiment shows that procedural generators {{can be an effective}} tool for the efficient design of <b>analog</b> <b>integrated</b> <b>circuits...</b>|$|R

40|$|The idea of {{applying}} blind source separation (BSS) algo-rithms {{has recently been}} introduced for noise separation in <b>integrated</b> <b>circuits.</b> Until now, the introduced methods were based on multi-channel BSS. But in many real applications only one mixture is available. Therefore, multi-channel BSS methods are not helpful. In this paper, we propose {{a new approach to}} separate individual noise and source signals from an observed mixture in <b>analog</b> <b>integrated</b> <b>circuits.</b> This method is based on one-channel BSS and includes empirical mode decomposition (EMD), principle component analysis (PCA) and independent component analysis (ICA). By using this method, we are able to separate noise and estimate de-sired source signals from only a single observed mixture. Experimental results substantiate the strong potential of the proposed method for noise separation in <b>analog</b> <b>integrated</b> <b>circuits.</b> 1...|$|R
