The formation of 4 is thermoneutral due to the dehydrogenation being concerted with the donor coordination. Reaction of 4 with {{a limited amount of}} oxygen reveals arsinidene-like reactivity via formation of cyclooligoarsines, supporting the formulation of the bonding in 4 as base-stabilized arsinidene R 3 P→AsR.

Ge-rich IWW (Si/Ge= 3. 1) is disassembled into a layered material (IPC- 5 P), which can be reassembled into an almost pure silica IWW on treatment with diethoxydimethylsilane. Ge-poor IWW (Si/Ge= 6. 4) is not completely disassembled on hydrolysis, but retains some 3 D connectivity. This structure can be reassembled into IWW by incorporation of Al to fill the defects left when the Ge is removed. Publisher PDFPeer reviewe...|$|R

A group L is primitive monolithic if L has a unique minimal normal subgroup, N, and trivial Frattini subgroup. By PL,N(k) we denote the conditional probability that k randomly chosen elements of L generate L, given that they project onto generators for L/N. In this article we show that PL,N(k) is controlled by PY,S(2), where N≅Sr and Y is a 2 -generated almost simple group with socle S that is contained in the normalizer in L of the first direct factor of N. Information aboutPL,N(k) for L primitive monolithic yields various types {{of information about the}} generation of arbitrary finite and profinite groups. Publisher PDFPeer reviewe...|$|R
40|$|This {{reports on}} the {{publications}} arising from RCUK-funded research by University of Southampton authors. There is also a financial report detailing our expenditure from the RCUK Open <b>Access</b> <b>block</b> <b>Grant.</b> We have taken this information {{from a combination of}} searches on Thomson Reuters Web of Science and on Scopus for all eligible RCUK-funded research outputs published between 1 st April 2016 and 31 st March 2017, and a search of our own institutional repository. We are using the shorter embargo periods to determine green open access. There is likely to be under-reporting of green open access compliance as outputs could be {{in a wide variety of}} locations e. g. other institutional repositories. Some articles and proceedings are published outside of this time period, so there is not an exact match with items published in the reporting term. </span...|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} was part funded by NERC studentship, Grant Number: F 008589 / 1. The APC was paid through RCUK Open <b>Access</b> <b>block</b> <b>grant</b> funds. Analysis of a high-resolution suite of modern glacial sediments from Jostedalen, southern Norway, using a portable {{optically stimulated luminescence}} (OSL) reader, provides insights into the processes of sediment bleaching in glacial environments at the catchment scale. High-magnitude, low-frequency processes result in the least effective sediment bleaching, whereas low-magnitude, high-frequency events provide greater bleaching opportunities. Changes in sediment bleaching can also be identified at the scale of individual bar features: tails of braid-bars and side-attached bar deposits have the lowest portable reader signal intensities, {{as well as the}} smallest conventional OSL residual doses. In addition to improving our understanding of the processes of sediment bleaching, portable reader investigations can also facilitate more rapid and comprehensive modern analogue investigations, which are commonly used to confirm that the OSL signals of modern glacial sediments are well bleached.

40|$|Analyses of {{intergovernmental}} aid {{emphasize the}} difference between matching <b>grants</b> and <b>block</b> <b>grants.</b> Since a <b>block</b> <b>grant</b> has only an income effect and no price effect, conventional theory predicts that <b>block</b> <b>grants</b> have a very small impact on the local government's expenditure on the favored activity. There is, however, {{a different type of}} <b>block</b> <b>grant</b> referred to in this paper as a "differential add-on grant. " The purpose of the present paper is to measure the effectiveness of one such add-on grant, the federal government's program to increase local education spending on pupils from low-income families. The evidence implies that this aid is quite effective and therefore suggests that the traditional theory of intergovernmental aid should be extended to recognize this type of grant. ...|$|R
