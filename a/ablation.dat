5|$|Glacier retreat {{results in}} the loss of the low-elevation region of the glacier. Since higher {{elevations}} are cooler, the disappearance of the lowest portion decreases overall <b>ablation,</b> thereby increasing mass balance and potentially reestablishing equilibrium. If the mass balance of {{a significant portion of the}} accumulation zone of the glacier is negative, it is in disequilibrium with the climate and will melt away without a colder climate and or an increase in frozen precipitation.|$|E
5|$|Holmium-chromium-thulium triple-doped Yttrium {{aluminum}} garnet (Ho:Cr:Tm:YAG, or Ho,Cr,Tm:YAG) is {{an active}} laser medium material with high efficiency. It lases at 2097nm and is widely used in military applications, medicine, and meteorology. Single-element thulium-doped YAG (Tm:YAG) lasers operate between 1930 and 2040nm. The wavelength of thulium-based lasers is very efficient for superficial <b>ablation</b> of tissue, with minimal coagulation depth in air or in water. This makes thulium lasers attractive for laser-based surgery.|$|E
40|$|Inferotemporal <b>ablations</b> in the New World monkey, {{the common}} {{marmoset}} (Callithrix jacchus), produced a persistent impairment on visual discrimination learning and a florid, but transient, Klüver-Bucy syndrome. Monkeys with these <b>ablations</b> were impaired on acquisition of object discriminations {{to a high}} criterion and on concurrent discrimination learning, to a single high criterion across all trials. Neither the control monkeys nor the monkeys with inferotemporal <b>ablations</b> found acquisition more difficult when the component discriminations of a set were presented concurrently compared to consecutively, although the monkeys with inferotemporal <b>ablations</b> found acquisition under both these conditions somewhat more difficult than did control monkeys. This suggests that the severe impairment caused by inferotemporal <b>ablations</b> on concurrent learning measured across all trials {{is due to the}} need for sustained performance across a concurrent set rather than to the extra mnemonic demands of concurrent presentation. When immunotoxic lesions of the cholinergic projection to the hippocampal formation were added to the inferotemporal <b>ablations,</b> a further impairment on retention, and a differential impairment on concurrent, compared to consecutive, learning was observed. Previous studies have shown that lesions of the cholinergic projection to the hippocampus alone, or excitotoxic hippocampal lesions, do not affect simple visual discrimination learning. It is suggested that large inferotemporal <b>ablations</b> in monkeys produce a visual agnosia which causes severe 'psychic blindness' in the first instance, and a persistent impairment on visual discrimination learning. The hippocampus makes a contribution, which may be mnemonic, to discrimination performance after inferotemporal <b>ablations...</b>|$|R

But <b>ablations</b> of hippocampus have also been shown to impair retention, and this impairment transcends the visual modality. Therefore, in the first of two experiments, we compared the behavioral effects of inferotemporal cortical lesions with those of either hippocampus, entorhinal area, or fornix, using a visual concurrent discrimination task. Monkeys with either hippocampal or entorhinal <b>ablations</b> were impaired, while those with fornix sections were not. However, <b>ablations</b> of hippocampus included inadvertent damage of the inferotemporal cortex. Therefore, in the second experiment, behavioral effects of inferotemporal lesions were compared with those of hippocampus (without additional inferotemporal damage) on the concurrent task in both visual and tactual modalities. In the visual mode, monkeys with hippocampal removals were as impaired as those with inferotemporal <b>ablations.</b> In the tactual mode, however, hippocampal, but not inferotemporal, <b>ablations</b> were followed by a deficit.

40|$|PURPOSE: To {{assess whether}} laser {{guidance}} can reduce fluoroscopy and procedure time of cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) -guided radiofrequency (RF) <b>ablations</b> of osteoid osteoma compared to freehand CBCT guidance. MATERIALS AND METHODS: 32 RF <b>ablations</b> were retrospectively analyzed, 17 laser-guided and 15 procedures using the freehand technique. Subgroup selection of 18 <b>ablations</b> in the hip-pelvic region {{with a similar}} degree of difficulty was used for a direct comparison. Data are presented as median (ranges). RESULTS: Comparison of all 32 <b>ablations</b> resulted in fluoroscopy times of 365 s (193 - 878 s) for freehand and 186 s (75 - 587 s) for laser-guided procedures (p = 0. 004). Corresponding procedure times were 56 min (35 - 97 min) and 52 min (30 - 85 min) (p = 0. 355). The subgroup showed comparable target sizes, needle path lengths, and number of scans between groups. Fluoroscopy times were lower for laser-guided procedures, 215 s (75 - 413 s), compared to 384 s (193 - 878 s) for freehand (p = 0. 012). Procedure times were comparable between groups, 51 min (30 - 72 min) for laser guidance and 58 min (35 - 79 min) for freehand (p = 0. 172). CONCLUSION: Adding laser guidance to CBCT-guided osteoid osteoma RF <b>ablations</b> significantly reduced fluoroscopy time without increasing procedure time.

40|$|Background: The {{inner ear}} {{develops}} from an ectodermal thickening {{known as the}} otic placode into a complex structure that is asymmetrical along both the anterior–posterior (A-P) and dorsal–ventral (D-V) axes. Embryological manipulations in Xenopus allow us to test regenerative potential along specific axes and timing of axis determination. We explore the role of Wnt signaling with gain and loss of function experiments. Results: In contrast to A or P half <b>ablations,</b> D or V half <b>ablations</b> almost never result in mirror duplications or normal ears. Instead there is a loss of structures, especially those associated with the ablated region. Rotation experiments inverting the D-V axis reveal that it is determined by stage 24 – 26 which is just before expression of the dorsal otic marker Wnt 3 a. Conditional blocking of canonical Wnt signaling results in reductions {{in the number of}} sensory organs and semicircular canals which could be placed in one of three categories, the most common phenotypes being similar to those seen after dorsal <b>ablations.</b> Conclusions: There is less regenerative potential along the D-V axis.

25|$|In 1941, Charles Huggins {{reported}} that androgen <b>ablation</b> therapy causes regression of primary and metastatic androgen-dependent prostate cancer.

Androgen <b>ablation</b> therapy causes remission in 80-90% of patients undergoing therapy, resulting in a median progression-free survival of 12 to 33 months. After remission, an androgen-independent phenotype typically emerges, wherein the median overall survival is 23–37 months {{from the time of}} initiation of androgen <b>ablation</b> therapy. It is not clear how the prostate cancer becomes androgen-independent or how it reestablishes progression, although a few possibilities (on how) have been proposed.
