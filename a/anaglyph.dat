5|$|In a video {{posted on}} July 21, 2009, YouTube {{software}} engineer Peter Bradshaw announced that YouTube users can now upload 3D videos. The videos {{can be viewed}} in several different ways, including the common <b>anaglyph</b> (cyan/red lens) method which utilizes glasses worn by the viewer to achieve the 3D effect. The YouTube Flash player can display stereoscopic content interleaved in rows, columns or a checkerboard pattern, side-by-side or <b>anaglyph</b> using a red/cyan, green/magenta or blue/yellow combination. In May 2011, an HTML5 version of the YouTube player began supporting side-by-side 3D footage that is compatible with Nvidia 3D Vision.|$|E
5|$|On {{compatible}} systems, the Microsoft Windows version uses nVidia's PhysX software {{engine to}} produce realistic, dynamic {{interactions with the}} game world. With PhysX enabled, some areas contain smoke or fog which reacts to Batman moving through it, while with PhysX disabled the fog will not appear at all. Other effects include dynamic interaction with paper and leaves, surfaces which can be scratched and chipped, and dynamic, destructible cloth elements such as banners and cobwebs. The Game of the Year version features the ability {{to play the game}} in 3D on any 2D television using <b>anaglyph</b> 3D glasses.|$|E
5|$|The film's {{original}} title, Cheating Death: Final Destination 3, {{was changed}} during development. The companies that co-produced the franchise's first film—Craig Perry and Warren Zide's Zide/Perry Productions, and Wong and Morgan's own Hard Eight Pictures—returned to produce Final Destination 3. Practical Pictures and Manitee Pictures also {{helped with the}} film's production. The film was initially intended to be filmed in 3D, but plans for this were abandoned. Morgan revealed {{that the decision to}} not film in 3D was mostly due to financial reasons, but also because he believed that fire and blood would not be shown properly in the red color filters of <b>anaglyph</b> 3D.|$|E
40|$|My {{bachelor}} thesis <b>Anaglyphs</b> {{and their}} application in teaching stereometry deals with <b>anaglyphs</b> and their creation. It gives information about linear perspective, which {{is necessary for}} the creation of <b>anaglyphs.</b> The terms of linear perspective are explained as well as the methods we can use in constructions of this projection. The thesis is mainly devoted to <b>anaglyphs</b> and their creation by the tools of descriptive geometry - central projection and especially linear perspective. Types of <b>anaglyphs,</b> drawing of <b>anaglyphs</b> and the possibility of constructing <b>anaglyphs</b> by software are mentioned. The third chapter deals with stereometry and it uses <b>anaglyphs</b> to support the spatial imagination. There are two versions of the third chapter - each one uses different types of <b>anaglyphs</b> to show the same problems of stereometry. 3 D red cyan glasses are enclosed to the thesis as well as a CD containing both versions of the thesis and two files showing the creation of <b>anaglyphs.</b> The thesis is meant to be used by teachers and students in teaching and studying stereometry...|$|R

50|$|Images {{generated}} {{this way}} can be edited with stereo imaging software and viewed as traditional stereo pairs {{or can be}} converted to any of a number of formats, including <b>anaglyphs,</b> which are viewed using common bicolor 3D glasses, such as those often used with 3D TV and printed materials. <b>Anaglyphs</b> can be printed with normal printers and used as 3D posters.|$|R
25|$|<b>Anaglyph</b> 3D glasses have a {{different}} colored filter for each eye, typically red and blue or red and green. A polarized 3D system {{on the other hand}} uses polarized filters. Polarized 3D glasses allow for color 3D, while the red-blue lenses produce an image with distorted coloration. An active shutter 3D system uses electronic shutters. Head-mounted displays can filter the signal electronically and then transmit light directly into the viewers eyes.|$|E
25|$|Baird also {{demonstrated}} {{the use of}} the two-color tube as the basis for stereoscopic 3D television. In this use, the two color-filtered television cameras were separated to produce a measurable angle, and then broadcast normally. Viewers wore colored glasses to re-separate the images into the left and right eye, in a fashion identical to <b>Anaglyph</b> 3D movies. However, Baird also described a system using the ridged tube that eliminated the need for glasses. In this case the tube was rotated so the peaks ran vertically instead of horizontally and the red gun was removed. The guns formerly used for green and blue were now used for left and right images. The basic concept is identical to the lenticular printing system used on magazines and other printed materials to produce 3D images.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: First {{mentioned}} in 1853 by Rollmann, <b>anaglyphs</b> today are considered {{as an important}} means to represent threedimensional pictures on at surfaces {{in a variety of}} application areas such as geometry, chemistry, architecture, and mining. However, most statisticians ignore the power of printed <b>anaglyphs</b> and especially of interactively animated <b>anaglyphs</b> on CRT display systems. Generally, threedimensional data displays such as threedimensional scatterplots and three dimensional graphs of bivariate probability density functions yield better impressions of the underlying data than twodimensional displays. Relatively little additional mathematical calculus, i. e., two central projections with di erent COPs calculated independently, must be done and only cheap additional ", i. e., red and green lter glasses, is required to produce impressing stereoscopic graphics...|$|R
40|$|The aim of my {{semester}} {{work was}} {{to study the}} physiology of binocular vision for spatial perception of two-dimensional images using glasses with coloured filters, <b>anaglyphs.</b> Since the theme concerns the visual sense, I explained {{the principle of the}} vision first. Then I described the principle of physiological development of the vision and the assumptions about binocular vision. The binocular vision is a complex process ongoing in the brain. Therefore, another topic of my thesis was an analysis of three-dimensional objects, space analysis, which unknowingly takes place in our brain. The next chapter deals with stereoscopy, technology which evokes a feeling of depth in two-dimensional images. One of the techniques is obtaining spatial perception by means of glasses with colour filters. In my thesis, I summarized the knowledge about the principle of <b>anaglyphs</b> and I described the principle of obtaining <b>anaglyphs,</b> from shooting the scene, over its creation to its viewing. Finally, here {{is an example of the}} program created in Matlab. It is a simple program to obtain <b>anaglyphs</b> from two separate frames...|$|R

2500|$|Since the band's early days, Dizzy Mizz Lizzy {{have been}} using the photo of a young [...] "dizzy" [...] girl as mascot, which {{has been used in}} varying ways. Christensen explains: [...] "The photo is from around 1920. It depicts the older sister of my {{grandmother}} on mother's side. She died around the age of 12–14 of tuberculosis. Her real name is Vera. There are two or three copies of the photo in my family. I have one hanging in my apartment. The same photo hung in my home, and when we were searching for a cover for our first release (the 1993 promo), we felt it was a great idea to use the picture of her as a sort of mascot or logo." [...] On their demo's cover, the photograph was colored with fluorescent colors. Danish designer MandOverBord subsequently used the picture for the band's eponymous debut album and singles, coloring the girl with more natural colors but also adding red laser beams coming from her eyes. The 2002 compilation album The Best of Dizzy Mizz Lizzy superimposed the mascot over the cover art from the band's second album, Rotator. During the band's 2009 reunion, the mascot was used in promotional material and on stage, and appeared in a duotone black and white portrayal {{on the front of the}} 2010 Dizzcography box set, which contained all previous albums of which the artwork (including the mascot) were completely redrawn because the original designs had not been saved. The live DVD Live in Concert 2010 features a black and white rendering of the original photo amidst text in a theater poster design. After the band reunited in 2014, the mascot was again used, this time in the form of an <b>anaglyph</b> 3D rendering for promotional material, on stage, and the cover art of the 2016 studio album Forward in Reverse and its singles.|$|E
50|$|Swirsky {{is known}} for his work in 3D digital photography. He has {{developed}} algorithms for generating full-color <b>anaglyph</b> images from stereo pairs that can be viewed through red/cyan glasses. A popular freeware program, Callipygian 3D is widely used and has been featured on TechTV's The Screen Savers show several times, with Swirsky demonstrating its use. The popularity of <b>anaglyph</b> images from Mars, and in <b>anaglyph</b> movies like Spy Kids 3D introduced new people to the <b>anaglyph</b> technique. Swirsky's software {{played a major role in}} letting people create their own <b>anaglyph</b> images.|$|E
50|$|An {{alternative}} to the usual red and cyan filter system of <b>anaglyph</b> is ColorCode 3-D, a patented <b>anaglyph</b> system which was invented in order to present an <b>anaglyph</b> image {{in conjunction with the}} NTSC television standard, in which the red channel is often compromised. ColorCode uses the complementary colors of yellow and dark blue on-screen, and the colors of the glasses' lenses are amber and dark blue.|$|E

50|$|All of the 1950s US feature-length 3-D {{films were}} {{originally}} {{shown by the}} polarized light method and viewed through gray-lensed polarized glasses, but in the 1970s a few were theatrically re-released as red-and-blue-glasses <b>anaglyph</b> 3-D prints, which, unlike the original format, did not require special projection equipment and a non-depolarizing screen. Beginning in the early 1980s, <b>anaglyph</b> versions of several 1950s 3-D films were broadcast on television and released in home video formats. House of Wax was never theatrically shown, broadcast on television, or sold for home use in <b>anaglyph</b> form in the US, but an unauthorized <b>anaglyph</b> version on bootleg video or even 16 mm film may exist.|$|E

50|$|Stereoscopic films largely {{remained}} dormant for {{the first}} part of the 1960s, with those that were released usually being <b>anaglyph</b> exploitation films. One film of notoriety was the Beaver-Champion/Warner Bros. production, The Mask (1961). The film was shot in 2-D, but to enhance the bizarre qualities of the dream-world that is induced when the main character puts on a cursed tribal mask, these scenes went to <b>anaglyph</b> 3D.

40|$|Keeper of the Patterns' – an {{exploration}} of the use of 3 D <b>Anaglyphs</b> in Textile Design. The primary objective of the work was to explore the possibilities of using 3 d <b>anaglyphs</b> in textile design. Another aim was to extend the methods used for producing imagery for textile design and explore the use of narrative within imagery used for surface pattern design. Stemming from a collaborative project and exhibition with the Calais Lace museum (Crysalis) the body scanner at the Lace Museum was used to generate images which were collaged into designs that were then developed into <b>anaglyphs</b> using digital techniques. The design was digitally printed onto textiles, acetate and paper. These designs were then used {{in a number of ways}} to create a wearable fabric sculpture, a large 3 d backlit image, a sound track and a cut-up poem. Software (P 22 random sound generator) was used to create a cut-up sound track to accompany the poem which created a narrative for the ensemble of works. 3 D glasses were used to view the sculpture and imagery and headphones were used to hear the soundtrack and poem. The wearable sculpture aimed to explore another area of interest which was the interface between set design, costume design, sculpture and performance and music. The sculpture, being restrictive when worn, created certain new dynamic forms when worn by performers interpreting the poem. Oscar Schlemmer's 'Triadisches Ballett' and the Michael Clarke's work with The Fall were both both of interest in this context. Exhibited at the 'Moving textiles:Digital Encounters' exhibition of over 40 textile designers, artists and craftspeople exploring the place of digital technology in contemporary textile practice in the Herbert Read Gallery, UCA Canterbury (catalogue ISBN 9780992733698), this project was supported by the UCA Research Fund and European Interregional Development Fund...|$|R
