5|$|Swimming {{was one of}} {{the first}} {{organised}} sports for people with disabilities, and was contested at the first Summer Paralympics in 1960. Both the rules for the sport <b>and</b> <b>approval</b> of classifications were the responsibility of the Fédération International de Natation Amateur (FINA) until 1992, when the International Paralympic Committee took over the governance of classification. As of 2012, people with visual, physical and intellectual disabilities are eligible to compete in the sport. The classification system was originally based on medical criteria, but has since moved to one largely based on functional disability to make para-swimming more competitive. The sport is moving towards an evidence-based classification system.|$|E
5|$|The Sovereign still {{exercised}} a {{power to}} be reckoned with in the eighteenth century. The Court remained the centre of the political world. The King was limited in that he had to choose Ministers who could command a majority in Parliament, but the choice remained his. The leader of an administration still had to command the King's personal confidence <b>and</b> <b>approval.</b> A strong following in Parliament depended on being able to supply places, pensions, and other marks of Royal favour to the government's supporters.|$|E

40|$|Sections include {{land use}} regulations, DLNR {{geothermal}} permits, and environmental pollution control regulations. As might be expected, {{there are numerous}} laws, regulations, rules, permits <b>and</b> <b>approvals</b> needed for geothermal development. Almost all of these relate {{in one way or}} another to the environment. These laws and rules can be classified in several different ways. For the purposes of this discussion, I have divided them into three general categories: regulations controlling land uses, both State and County; State regulations specific to geothermal exploration and development administered by the State Department of Land and Natural Resources (DLNR); and State regulations whose purpose is to control environmental pollution, implementing both Federal and State legislation, and administered by the State Department of Health (DOH). There are also a number of County permits <b>and</b> <b>approvals,</b> such as grading, building, electrical, and plumbing permits, which are basically ministerial in nature. A list of required permits <b>and</b> <b>approvals</b> <b>and</b> the legal authority for each is attached...|$|R
5|$|At {{the same}} meeting, the {{governors}} also discussed {{the possibility of}} new tax incentives to motivate industry to reduce pollution {{and the creation of}} a new interstate compact to set industry standards, which would require adoption by all member states <b>and</b> <b>approval</b> by Congress. Those four states were already members of the Delaware River Basin Commission (DRBC), an interstate agency that controls water pollution in the Delaware River. The proposed air-pollution compact was modeled after the DRBC and would function similarly, setting minimum air standards across states and enabling enforcement actions against polluters. New York, New Jersey, and Connecticut adopted the proposed Mid-Atlantic States Air Pollution Control Compact with the possibility for Delaware and Pennsylvania to join in the future. Its approval by Congress became a policy goal of Rockefeller's failed primary bid for the 1968 Republican presidential nomination. The compact was never approved by Congress and thus never took effect.|$|E

5|$|Bruce {{set about}} {{applying}} his business principles to his cabinet, putting {{his experience as}} both a corporate manager and rowing coach to use in a cabinet system that was orderly and practical. He implemented a formal system whereby a proper agenda for cabinet meetings would be formulated, and the minister responsible for each item would circulate papers to bring other members {{up to speed on}} the issue. His decision-making procedures ensured that his colleagues were informed and actively participated in decisions or if they disagreed, gave leave for cabinet members to absent themselves from meetings to preserve cabinet solidarity. In this respect Bruce earned the quick respect <b>and</b> <b>approval</b> of his colleagues, and in many respects came to dominate cabinet through his industriousness and knowledgability. Cabinet minister George Pearce would later conclude that Bruce was the best of the prime ministers that he served or opposed in his 38-year parliamentary career.|$|E
