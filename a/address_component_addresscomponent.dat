40|$|Mapping of {{postal address}} to a mail {{delivery}} {{point is a}} very important task that affects the efficiency of postal service. This task is very complex in the countries such as India, where postal addresses are not structured. Further most of the times the destination addresses in such countries are incomplete, approximate and erroneous which adds to the complexity of mapping postal address to delivery point. Automation of this aspect of the postal service is a challenge. This paper presents a soft computing model to map the postal address to mail delivery point. Firstly machine readable postal address is processed to identify the <b>address</b> <b>components</b> using a novel fuzzy symbolic similarity analysis, and further these labeled components are organized as a symbolic postal address object. This postal address object is further processed using the newly devised fuzzy symbolic methodology for mapping the address to mail delivery point. Symbolic knowledge bases for postal <b>address</b> <b>component</b> labeling and mail delivery point mapping are devised. Fuzzy symbolic similarity measures are formulated once for <b>address</b> <b>component</b> labeling and the second time for mapping the entire address to a mail delivery point. In sequel to similarity computations, which are viewed as fuzzy membership values, an expert system comprising of alpha-cut de-fuzzification is proposed to evaluate the confidence factors, while inferencing the validity of <b>address</b> <b>component</b> labels and mail delivery points. The system is tested exhaustively and an efficiency of 94 % is obtained in <b>address</b> <b>component</b> identification and about 86 % in mail delivery point mapping, while working on an Indian postal data base of about 500 addresses.

40|$|It is {{important}} to properly segregate the different components present in the destination postal address under different labels namely addressee name, house number, street number, extension/area name, destination town name and the like for automatic address reading. This task is {{not as easy as}} it would appear particularly for unstructured postal addresses such as that are found in India. This paper presents a fuzzy symbolic inference system for postal mail <b>address</b> <b>component</b> extraction and labelling. The work uses a symbolic representation for postal addresses and a symbolic knowledge base for postal <b>address</b> <b>component</b> labelling. A symbolic similarity measure treated as a fuzzy membership function is devised and is used for finding the distance of the extracted component to a probable label. An alpha cut based de-fuzzification technique is employed for labelling and evaluation of confidence in the decision. The methodology is tested on 500 postal addresses and an efficiency of 94 % is obtained for <b>address</b> <b>component</b> labeling...|$|R

This information is useful in developing a strategy for selecting a useful component for recovering the value of an uncertain component. The uncertainty of a component based on another known component can be measured by conditional entropy. By ranking the uncertainty quantity, the effective processing flow for determining the value of a candidate component can be constructed. 1...|$|R

40|$|A {{method for}} {{determining}} the delivery point codes (DPCs) for handwritten addresses is described. Determining the DPC requires locating and recognizing <b>address</b> <b>components</b> (e. g., ZIP Code, street number, P. O. box number) and using multiple information sources to assign a five, nine or eleven digit barcode (i. e., the DPC) to an address. Our method uses diverse pat tern recognition and image processing algorithms (t hresholding, underline removal. separation of lines, location and recognition of <b>address</b> <b>components,</b> and Postal directory access) to determine the DPC. Three separate encoding techniques are used, each accessing a separate USPS database. There are three methods of determining the DPC: (i) the ZIP code recognized {{happens to be a}} unique ZIP Code. In such cases, the 5 -digit ZIP Code itself is the DPC; (ii) the address has a P. O. Box number. In such cases, the ZIP Code and the P. O. Box number are sufficient to determine the J-digit addon to makeup the DPC; (iii) the address has a street line. In such cases, the ZIP Code and the street number confine the possible street names to a small set using a USPS directory. The word recognition algorithm is invoked to find which of the street names in the set matches the street name image in the address. The selected street name has a 4 digit add-on which can be obtained from the Postal directory. The last two digits of the street number are appended to the ZIP+addon to generate an H-digit DPC. 321...|$|R
