5|$|As {{part of the}} {{construction}} works for the atmospheric-propulsion system, the world's first railway flyover was constructed {{at the north end}} of Portland Road, to carry the new <b>atmospheric</b> line over the conventional steam line below. In 1847, the <b>atmospheric</b> propulsion experiment was abandoned.|$|E
5|$|As {{the planet}} is not known to transit from Earth and <b>atmospheric</b> {{conditions}} are not observable with current technology, no atmosphere for the planet has been confirmed to date. As such, all climate predictions for the planet are based on predicted orbits and computer modelling of theoretical <b>atmospheric</b> conditions.|$|E
5|$|Donald Canfield {{detected}} {{records of}} the first significant quantities of <b>atmospheric</b> oxygen just before the first Ediacaran fossils appeared– {{and the presence of}} <b>atmospheric</b> oxygen was soon heralded as a possible trigger for the Ediacaran radiation. Oxygen seems to have accumulated in two pulses; the rise of small, sessile (stationary) organisms seems to correlate with an early oxygenation event, with larger and mobile organisms appearing around the second pulse of oxygenation. However, the assumptions underlying the reconstruction of <b>atmospheric</b> composition have attracted some criticism, with widespread anoxia having little effect on life where it occurs in the Early Cambrian and the Cretaceous.|$|E
5|$|The US {{suspension}} of <b>atmospheric</b> tests was lifted on 25 April 1962.|$|E
5|$|A {{high-pressure}} area, high or anticyclone is {{a region}} where the <b>atmospheric</b> pressure at {{the surface of the}} planet is greater than its surrounding environment.|$|E

5|$|<b>Atmospheric</b> instability, hot temperatures, and {{a severe}} drought fueled the fire, making it {{difficult}} to suppress. On Thursday, October 24, 2013, the Rim Fire was 100% contained.|$|E
5|$|<b>Atmospheric</b> {{twinkling}} {{limits the}} resolution obtainable from ground-based telescopes since turbulence degrades angular resolution.|$|E
5|$|Climate is the {{statistics}} of weather {{over long periods}} of time. It is measured by assessing the patterns of variation in temperature, humidity, <b>atmospheric</b> pressure, wind, precipitation, <b>atmospheric</b> particle count and other meteorological variables in a given region {{over long periods of}} time. Climate differs from weather, in that weather only describes the short-term conditions of these variables in a given region.|$|E

5|$|Declassified US {{documents}} {{indicate that}} the US may have violated the PTBT's ban on <b>atmospheric</b> testing in 1972 by, at the instruction of Henry Kissinger, monitoring and collecting data on French <b>atmospheric</b> tests over the Pacific Ocean, which may have amounted to cooperation with the French program. Declassified documents also {{indicate that the}} US and UK circumvented the prescribed verification system in 1964–65 by establishing a series of additional control posts in Australia, Fiji, Mauritius, Pakistan, and South Africa.|$|E
5|$|Diverging {{winds aloft}} ahead of these troughs cause <b>atmospheric</b> lift within the {{troposphere}} below, which lowers surface pressures as upward motion partially counteracts {{the force of}} gravity.|$|E
5|$|During {{sunrise and}} sunset, {{sunlight}} is attenuated because of Rayleigh scattering and Mie scattering from a particularly long passage through Earth's atmosphere, and the Sun is sometimes faint {{enough to be}} viewed comfortably {{with the naked eye}} or safely with optics (provided there is no risk of bright sunlight suddenly appearing through a break between clouds). Hazy conditions, <b>atmospheric</b> dust, and high humidity contribute to this <b>atmospheric</b> attenuation.|$|E
5|$|Empty air {{cylinders}} at <b>atmospheric</b> pressure are rated in Transport category 4, {{and there is}} no threshold quantity.|$|E

5|$|For the National Science Foundation (NSF), SRI {{operates}} the advanced modular incoherent scatter radar (AMISR), a novel relocatable <b>atmospheric</b> research facility. Other SRI-operated research facilities for the NSF include the Arecibo Observatory in Puerto Rico and the Sondrestrom Upper <b>Atmospheric</b> Research Facility in Greenland. In May 2011, SRI {{was awarded a}} $42 million contract to operate the Arecibo Observatory from October 1, 2011 to September 30, 2016. The institute also manages the Hat Creek Radio Observatory in Northern California, home of the Allen Telescope Array.|$|E
5|$|In bulk {{form and}} at room {{temperature}} and <b>atmospheric</b> pressure, the element resists alkalis, sulfuric acid, hydrochloric acid, dilute (but not concentrated) nitric acid, and aqua regia.|$|E
5|$|In nature, free oxygen is {{produced}} by the light-driven splitting of water during oxygenic photosynthesis. According to some estimates, green algae and cyanobacteria in marine environments provide about 70% of the free oxygen produced on Earth, and the rest {{is produced}} by terrestrial plants. Other estimates of the oceanic contribution to <b>atmospheric</b> oxygen are higher, while some estimates are lower, suggesting oceans produce ~45% of Earth's <b>atmospheric</b> oxygen each year.|$|E

5|$|Minute {{traces of}} {{plutonium}} are usually {{found in the}} human body due to the 550 <b>atmospheric</b> and underwater nuclear tests that have been carried out, and to a small number of major nuclear accidents. Most <b>atmospheric</b> and underwater nuclear testing was stopped by the Limited Test Ban Treaty in 1963, which was signed and ratified by the United States, the United Kingdom, the Soviet Union, and other nations. Continued <b>atmospheric</b> nuclear weapons testing since 1963 by non-treaty nations included those by China (atomic bomb test above the Gobi Desert in 1964, hydrogen bomb test in 1967, and follow-on tests), and France (tests as recently as the 1990s). Because it is deliberately manufactured for nuclear weapons and nuclear reactors, plutonium-239 is the most abundant isotope of plutonium by far.|$|E
5|$|Ocean acidification: {{dissolution}} of <b>atmospheric</b> carbon dioxide affects seawater pH. The reaction depends on {{total inorganic carbon}} and on solubility equilibria with solid carbonates such as limestone and dolomite.|$|E

5|$|So a 12-litre {{cylinder}} at 232 bar {{would hold}} almost 12×232/1= of air at <b>atmospheric</b> pressure (also known as free air).|$|E
5|$|The {{electrolyte}} {{is usually}} iron(II) sulfate {{in urban areas}} (formed when <b>atmospheric</b> sulfur dioxide attacks iron), and salt particles in the atmosphere in seaside areas.|$|E
5|$|The isotope 7Be (half-life 53 days) is also cosmogenic, {{and shows}} an <b>atmospheric</b> {{abundance}} linked to sunspots, much like 10Be.|$|E
5|$|Throughout history, the Earth's {{atmosphere}} and biogeochemical cycles {{have been in}} a dynamic equilibrium with planetary ecosystems. The history is characterized by periods of significant transformation followed by millions of years of stability. The evolution of the earliest organisms, likely anaerobic methanogen microbes, started the process by converting <b>atmospheric</b> hydrogen into methane (4H2 + CO2 → CH4 + 2H2O). Anoxygenic photosynthesis reduced hydrogen concentrations and increased <b>atmospheric</b> methane, by converting hydrogen sulfide into water or other sulfur compounds (for example, 2H2S + CO2 + hv → CH2O + H2O + 2S). Early forms of fermentation also increased levels of <b>atmospheric</b> methane. The transition to an oxygen-dominant atmosphere (the Great Oxidation) did not begin until approximately 2.4–2.3billion years ago, but photosynthetic processes started 0.3 to 1billion years prior.|$|E
5|$|Van den Berg was {{assigned}} as Payload Specialist on STS-51B Challenger (April 29–May 6, 1985). STS-51B, the Spacelab-3 mission, was launched from the Kennedy Space Center, Florida, {{and returned to}} land at Edwards Air Force Base, California. It was the first operational Spacelab mission. The seven-man crew aboard Challenger conducted investigations into crystal growth, drop dynamics leading to containerless material processing, <b>atmospheric</b> trace gas spectroscopy, solar and planetary <b>atmospheric</b> simulation, cosmic rays, and laboratory-animal and human medical monitoring.|$|E
5|$|Variations {{of oxygen}} shaped the climates of the past. When oxygen declined, <b>atmospheric</b> density dropped and {{this in turn}} {{increased}} surface evaporation, and led to precipitation increases and warmer temperatures.|$|E
5|$|Wind {{is caused}} by {{differences}} in the <b>atmospheric</b> pressure. When a difference in <b>atmospheric</b> pressure exists, air moves from the higher to the lower pressure area, resulting in winds of various speeds. On a rotating planet, air will also be deflected by the Coriolis effect, except exactly on the equator. Globally, the two major driving factors of large-scale wind patterns (the <b>atmospheric</b> circulation) are the differential heating between the equator and the poles (difference in absorption of solar energy leading to buoyancy forces) and {{the rotation of the}} planet. Outside the tropics and aloft from frictional effects of the surface, the large-scale winds tend to approach geostrophic balance. Near the Earth's surface, friction causes the wind to be slower than it would be otherwise. Surface friction also causes winds to blow more inward into low-pressure areas.|$|E

25|$|Numerical Weather Prediction is a {{main focus}} in {{understanding}} air–sea interaction, tropical meteorology, <b>atmospheric</b> predictability, and tropospheric/stratospheric processes. The Naval Research Laboratory in Monterey, California, developed a global <b>atmospheric</b> model called Navy Operational Global <b>Atmospheric</b> Prediction System (NOGAPS). NOGAPS is run operationally at Fleet Numerical Meteorology and Oceanography Center for the United States Military.

25|$|Aerosol direct effect. Aerosols {{directly}} scatter {{and absorb}} radiation. The scattering of radiation causes <b>atmospheric</b> cooling, whereas absorption can cause <b>atmospheric</b> warming.|$|E
25|$|In the 1880s, Hathorn Davey and Co / Leeds {{produced}} a 1 hp / 125 rpm <b>atmospheric</b> engine with external condenser but without steam expansion. It {{has been argued}} that this was probably the last commercial <b>atmospheric</b> engine to be manufactured. As an <b>atmospheric</b> engine, it did not have a pressurized boiler. It was intended for small businesses.|$|E
