50|$|The USG {{has three}} {{different}} types of agencies; independent, quasi-independent, and joint. Independent <b>agencies</b> <b>are</b> <b>agencies</b> that <b>are</b> not aligned with the Legislative or Executive Branches. Ultimately the President is responsible for ensuring that these <b>agencies</b> <b>are</b> functioning properly. Quasi-Independent <b>are</b> <b>agencies</b> that report directly to the President. Joint <b>Agencies</b> <b>are</b> <b>agencies</b> that <b>are</b> created by the President and the Senate.|$|R
30|$|Perception of {{successful}} <b>agency</b> <b>is</b> {{a sense of}} determination {{to be successful in}} pursuing goals, by which hope is fueled (Snyder et al., 1991). Perception {{of successful}} <b>agency</b> <b>is</b> conceptually similar to self-efficacy, and they are shown to be positively and moderately correlated (Magaletta & Oliver, 1999). However, successful <b>agency</b> <b>is</b> more future-oriented than is self-efficacy (Snyder et al., 1991). Thus, perception of successful <b>agency</b> <b>is</b> more closely related to achievement goals compared to self-efficacy.|$|R
50|$|Government <b>agencies</b> <b>are</b> {{often given}} names ending in directorate, inspectorate, {{administration}} (verk) or authority. Among the organisations organised as <b>agencies</b> <b>are</b> the universities and colleges. All government <b>agencies</b> <b>are</b> audited by the Office of the Auditor General of Norway. Municipalities and counties often divide their organization into etats, {{with only the}} central administration left in the core. Typically these <b>agencies</b> then <b>are</b> responsible for schools, healthcare, culture etc.|$|R

5|$|Sicherheitspolizei ("Security Police"; SiPo) was the {{criminal}} investigation security agency of Nazi Germany. Created in 1936, it {{was composed of}} the Gestapo and the Kripo.

50|$|The {{worldwide}} {{commission rate}} for advertising <b>agencies</b> <b>is</b> fixed at 15% {{of the total}} billing. This is {{the only source of}} income they earn from media. The 15% must cover costs such as payroll, fixed and variable costs. <b>Agencies</b> <b>are</b> demanding to increase the commission rate but clients are not even willing to give the 15% even though it's the only source of revenue for the <b>Agency.</b> There <b>are</b> cases that <b>agencies</b> <b>are</b> forced to lower their rates to the level of 5% to 10% due to competition. So in some cases there <b>are</b> <b>agencies</b> that <b>are</b> not even getting the fixed 15%.|$|R

The Board included Tony Newton, Baron Newton of Braintree; Prof Dougal Drysdale, an authority on fire safety; and Dr Peter Baxter, a medical expert. Environment Agency and HSE staff were also on the board. Its aim was to identify the immediate causes of the explosion, rather than consider who was to blame for any deficiencies, {{so as not to}} prejudice further legal proceedings.|$|E
5|$|Bolivia's U.S. embassy {{had become}} {{publicly}} {{highly critical of}} Morales; {{just prior to the}} election, the U.S. ambassador to Bolivia Manuel Rocha issued a statement declaring that U.S. aid to Bolivia would be cut if MAS won the election. However, exit polls revealed that Rocha's comments had served to increase support for Morales. Following the election, the U.S. embassy maintained this critical stance, characterising Morales as a criminal and encouraging Bolivia's traditional parties to sign a broad agreement to oppose the MAS; Morales himself began alleging that the U.S. Central Intelligence <b>Agency</b> <b>was</b> plotting to assassinate him.|$|E

40|$|Competent public <b>agencies</b> <b>are</b> {{associated}} with better economic outcomes. Beyond competence, political leaders need {{to secure the}} loyalty of their agencies. Unfortunately, several theories predict a tradeoff between these two valued features. This paper finds that recruitment into <b>agencies</b> <b>is</b> meritocratic where (1) agency officials have poor outside options, (2) careers in <b>agencies</b> <b>are</b> long-lasting, and (3) <b>agency</b> loyalty <b>is</b> important. Moreover, <b>agency</b> competence <b>is</b> lower when (4) loyalty is important but the time horizon is short, and (5) outside opportunities improve but the time horizon is long. This evidence fits best with a theory of loyalty as non-contractible behavior...|$|R

5|$|In 1874, Gandhi's father Karamchand left Porbandar for {{the smaller}} state of Rajkot, where he became a {{counsellor}} to its ruler, the Thakur Sahib; though Rajkot was a less prestigious state than Porbandar, the British regional political <b>agency</b> <b>was</b> located there, which gave the state's diwan a measure of security. In 1876, Karamchand became diwan of Rajkot and was succeeded as diwan of Porbandar by his brother Tulsidas. His family then rejoined him in Rajkot.|$|E

5|$|The {{choice of}} Tromsø as a {{location}} for a telemetry stations {{was in part}} tied to the Tromsø Geophysical Observatory—which had been located in Tromsø since 1928—and the planned University of Tromsø. The Canadian Space <b>Agency</b> <b>was</b> at the time working on the Alouette 2 program and were seen by NDRE as a natural cooperation partner. The NASA's International Satellite for Ionospheric Studies was also being designed and NASA therefore decided to supply equipment for a telemetry station in Tromsø to be operational by August 1966.|$|E

5|$|The rapid {{intensification}} of Patricia was well-anticipated but poorly forecast. Meteorologists at the NHC indicated {{the possibility of}} such in the system's first advisory as a tropical depression. They noted the only inhibiting factor would be how quickly the storm could organize an inner core. Just {{before the onset of}} rapid intensification, the <b>agency</b> <b>was</b> unable to utilize the Statistical Hurricane Intensity Prediction Scheme rapid intensification guidance due to technical errors. This likely contributed to even greater errors in the agency's forecast. Initial forecasts were consistently conservative with intensity and dramatic strengthening was not explicitly shown until rapid intensification was already underway.|$|E
5|$|A {{full-scale}} mockup of the Q-12 {{was ready}} by 7 December 1962, {{and had already}} undergone preliminary tests to measure its radar cross-section. Marquardt had also successfully tested the modified RJ-43 in its wind tunnel in the meantime. However, the CIA was not enthusiastic about the Q-12, mostly because the <b>agency</b> <b>was</b> overextended at the time with U-2 missions, getting the A-12 up to speed, and covert operations in Southeast Asia. The Air Force, however, {{was interested in the}} Q-12 as both a reconnaissance platform and a cruise missile, and the CIA finally decided to work with the USAF to develop the new drone. Lockheed was awarded a contract in March 1963 for full-scale development of the Q-12.|$|E
5|$|A {{radiation}} accident occurred in Samut Prakan Province, Thailand in January–February 2000. The accident happened when an insecurely stored unlicensed cobalt-60 radiation source was recovered by scrap metal collectors who, {{together with a}} scrapyard worker, subsequently dismantled the container, unknowingly exposing themselves and others nearby to ionizing radiation. Over the following weeks, those exposed developed symptoms of radiation sickness and eventually sought medical attention. The Office of Atomic Energy for Peace (OAEP), Thailand's nuclear regulatory <b>agency,</b> <b>was</b> notified when doctors came to suspect radiation injury, some seventeen days after the initial exposure. The OAEP sent an emergency response team to locate and contain the radiation source, which was estimated to have an activity of , and was eventually traced to its owner. Investigations found failure to ensure secure storage of the radiation source to be {{the root cause of}} the accident, which resulted in ten people being hospitalized for radiation injury, three of whom died, as well as the potentially significant exposure of 1,872 people.|$|E
