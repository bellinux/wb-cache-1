40|$|Finding good drug leads de novo {{from large}} {{chemical}} libraries, real or virtual, {{is not an}} easy task. High-throughput screening is often plagued by low hit rates and many leads that are toxic or exhibit poor bioavailability. Exploiting the secondary activity of marketed drugs, on the other hand, may help in generating drug leads that can be optimized for the observed side-effect target, while maintaining acceptable bioavailability and toxicity profiles. Here, we describe an efficient computational methodology to discover leads to a protein target from safe marketed drugs. We applied an in silico “drug repurposing” procedure for identification of nonsteroidal antagonists against the human androgen receptor (AR), using multiple predicted models of an antagonist-bound receptor. The library of marketed oral drugs was then docked into the best-performing models, and the 11 selected compounds with the highest docking score were tested in vitro for AR binding and antagonism of dihydrotestosterone-induced AR transactivation. The phenothiazine derivatives <b>acetophenazine,</b> fluphenazine, and periciazine, used clinically as antipsychotic drugs, were identified as weak AR antagonists. This in vitro biological activity correlated well with endocrine side effects observed in individuals taking these medications. Further computational optimization of phenothiazines, combined with in vitro screening, led to the identification of a nonsteroidal antiandrogen with improved AR antagonism and marked reduction in affinity for dopaminergic and serotonergic receptors that are the primary target of phenothiazine antipsychotics...|$|E
40|$|The {{relationship}} between binding of antipsychotic drugs and sigma psychotomimetic opiates to binding {{sites for the}} sigma agonist (+) -[3 H]SKF 10, 047 (N-allylnormetazocine) and to dopamine D 2 sites was investigated. In guinea pig brain membranes, (+) -[3 H]SKF 10, 047 bound to a single class of sites with a Kd of 4 X 10 (- 8) M and a Bmax of 333 fmol/mg of protein. This binding was different from mu, kappa, or delta opiate receptor binding. It was inhibited by opiates that produce psychotomimetic activities but not by opiates that lack such activities. Some antipsychotic drugs inhibited (+) -[3 H]SKF 10, 047 binding with high to moderate affinities {{in the following order}} of potency: haloperidol greater than perphenazine greater than fluphenazine greater than <b>acetophenazine</b> greater than trifluoperazine greater than molindone {{greater than or equal to}} pimozide greater than or equal to thioridazine greater than or equal to chlorpromazine greater than or equal to triflupromazine. However, there were other antipsychotic drugs such as spiperone and clozapine that showed low affinity for the (+) -[3 H]SKF 10, 047 binding sites. Affinities of antipsychotic drugs for (+) -[3 H]SKF 10, 047 binding sites did not correlate with those for [3 H]spiperone (dopamine D 2) sites. [3 H]-Haloperidol binding in whole brain membranes was also inhibited by the sigma opiates pentazocine, cyclazocine, and (+) -SKF 10, 047. In the striatum, about half of the saturable [3 H]haloperidol binding was to [3 H]spiperone (D 2) sites and the other half was to sites similar to (+) -[3 H]SKF 10, 047 binding sites...|$|E
