The clean air benefit is usually local because, depending on {{the source of the}} electricity used to recharge the batteries, <b>air</b> <b>pollutant</b> emissions are shifted to the location of the generation plants. In a similar manner, plug-in electric vehicles {{operating in}} all-electric mode do not emit greenhouse gases from the onboard source of power, but {{from the point of view}} of a well-to-wheel assessment, the extent of the benefit also depends on the fuel and technology used for electricity generation. This fact has been referred to as the long tailpipe of plug-in electric vehicles. From the perspective of a full life cycle analysis, the electricity used to recharge the batteries must be generated from renewable or clean sources such as wind, solar, hydroelectric, or nuclear power for PEVs to have almost none or zero well-to-wheel emissions. On the other hand, when PEVs are recharged from coal-fired plants, they usually produce slightly more greenhouse gas emissions than internal combustion engine vehicles and higher than hybrid electric vehicles. In the case of plug-in hybrid electric vehicles operating in hybrid mode with assistance of the internal combustion engine, tailpipe and greenhouse emissions are lower in comparison to conventional cars because of their higher fuel economy.|$|E

25|$|Air {{pollution}} risk {{is a function}} of the hazard of the pollutant and the exposure to that pollutant. Air pollution exposure can be expressed for an individual, for certain groups (e.g. neighborhoods or children living in a country), or for entire populations. For example, one may want to calculate the exposure to a hazardous <b>air</b> <b>pollutant</b> for a geographic area, which includes the various microenvironments and age groups. This can be calculated as an inhalation exposure. This would account for daily exposure in various settings (e.g. different indoor micro-environments and outdoor locations). The exposure needs to include different age and other demographic groups, especially infants, children, pregnant women and other sensitive subpopulations. The exposure to an <b>air</b> <b>pollutant</b> must integrate the concentrations of the <b>air</b> <b>pollutant</b> with respect to the time spent in each setting and the respective inhalation rates for each subgroup for each specific time that the subgroup is in the setting and engaged in particular activities (playing, cooking, reading, working, etc.). For example, a small child's inhalation rate will be less than that of an adult. A child engaged in vigorous exercise will have a higher respiration rate than the same child in a sedentary activity. The daily exposure, then, needs to reflect the time spent in each micro-environmental setting and the type of activities in these settings. The <b>air</b> <b>pollutant</b> concentration in each microactivity/microenvironmental setting is summed to indicate the exposure.|$|E

Under the Clean Air Act, the National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) are {{developed}} by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) for six common <b>air</b> <b>pollutants,</b> also called [...] "criteria pollutants": particulates; smog and ground-level ozone; carbon monoxide; sulfur oxides; nitrogen oxides; and lead.

50|$|Significant {{quantities}} of <b>air</b> <b>pollutants</b> are emitted from each plant, although considerable resources are expended in applying Best Available Control Technology.

25|$|Volatile organic {{compounds}} (VOC) - VOCs are a well-known outdoor <b>air</b> <b>pollutant.</b> They are categorized as either methane (CH4) or non-methane (NMVOCs). Methane {{is an extremely}} efficient greenhouse gas which contributes to enhanced global warming. Other hydrocarbon VOCs are also significant greenhouse gases because of their role in creating ozone and prolonging the life of methane in the atmosphere. This effect varies depending on local air quality. The aromatic NMVOCs benzene, toluene and xylene are suspected carcinogens and may lead to leukemia with prolonged exposure. 1,3-butadiene is another dangerous compound often associated with industrial use.|$|E
25|$|<b>Air</b> <b>pollutant</b> {{emission}} {{factors are}} reported representative values {{that attempt to}} relate the quantity of a pollutant released to the ambient air with an activity associated {{with the release of}} that pollutant. These factors are usually expressed as the weight of pollutant divided by a unit weight, volume, distance, or duration of the activity emitting the pollutant (e.g., kilograms of particulate emitted per tonne of coal burned). Such factors facilitate estimation of emissions from various sources of air pollution. In most cases, these factors are simply averages of all available data of acceptable quality, and are generally assumed to be representative of long-term averages.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{considers}} {{the issue of}} <b>air</b> <b>pollutants</b> emission for the optimal and sustainable determination of cordon location, toll level, and price of park and ride (P&R). Although <b>air</b> <b>pollutants</b> emission decreases within the cordon by the implementation of cordon pricing scheme, it may increase outside the cordon and the whole network. Hence, <b>air</b> <b>pollutants</b> emission may only transfer from inside of the cordon to its outside. Therefore, in this paper, a multi-objective bi-level optimization model is developed. A solution algorithm is also presented based on the second version of strength Pareto evolutionary algorithm (SPEA 2). The results reveal that this multi-objective model can be {{a useful tool for}} the sustainable and optimal design of the cordon and P&R scheme. In addition, cordon pricing is a multi-objective problem. Therefore, it is necessary to consider <b>air</b> <b>pollutants</b> emission.

500|$|The {{technical}} {{literature on}} air pollution dispersion is quite extensive and {{dates back to}} the 1930s and earlier. One of the early <b>air</b> <b>pollutant</b> plume dispersion equations was derived by Bosanquet and Pearson. Their equation did not assume Gaussian distribution nor did it include the effect of ground reflection of the pollutant plume. [...] Sir Graham Sutton derived an <b>air</b> <b>pollutant</b> plume dispersion equation in 1947 which did include the assumption of Gaussian distribution for the vertical and crosswind dispersion of the plume and also included the effect of ground reflection of the plume. [...] Under the stimulus provided by the advent of stringent environmental control regulations, there was an immense growth in the use of <b>air</b> <b>pollutant</b> plume dispersion calculations between the late 1960s and today. A great many computer programs for calculating the dispersion of <b>air</b> <b>pollutant</b> emissions were developed {{during that period of time}} and they were called [...] "air dispersion models". The basis for most of those models was the Complete Equation For Gaussian Dispersion Modeling Of Continuous, Buoyant Air Pollution Plumes [...] The Gaussian <b>air</b> <b>pollutant</b> dispersion equation requires the input of H which is the pollutant plume's centerline height above ground level—and H is the sum of Hs (the actual physical height of the pollutant plume's emission source point) plus ΔH (the plume rise due the plume's buoyancy).|$|E

40|$|Abstract: For {{the purpose}} of {{recording}} polarization of the earth's atmosphere, the entire sky was photographed using the all-sky camera when the Sun was just above the horizon. The ratio and width of polarization were defined using the photograph, and a method to measure them was developed. Time-series photography of the polarization ratio and its width enabled us to qualitatively analyze the polarization phenomena which changes depending on the weather conditions. Findings indicated that polarization was co-related with <b>air</b> <b>pollutants</b> in a meaningful way. The polarization phenomena of the Earth's atmosphere are influenced by <b>air</b> <b>pollutants.</b> The more <b>air</b> <b>pollutants</b> exist in the air, the lower polarization ratio and the bigger polarization width it has.

40|$|Identifying the causalities for <b>air</b> <b>pollutants</b> and {{answering}} questions, such as, where do Beijing's <b>air</b> <b>pollutants</b> come from, {{are crucial to}} inform government decision-making. In this paper, we identify the spatio-temporal (ST) causalities among <b>air</b> <b>pollutants</b> at different locations by mining the urban big data. This is challenging for two reasons: 1) since <b>air</b> <b>pollutants</b> can be generated locally or dispersed from the neighborhood, we need to discover the causes in the ST space from many candidate locations with time efficiency; 2) the cause-and-effect relations between <b>air</b> <b>pollutants</b> are further affected by confounding variables like meteorology. To tackle these problems, we propose a coupled Gaussian Bayesian model with two components: 1) a Gaussian Bayesian Network (GBN) to represent the cause-and-effect relations among <b>air</b> <b>pollutants,</b> with an entropy-based algorithm to efficiently locate the causes in the ST space; 2) a coupled model that combines cause-and-effect relations with meteorology to better learn the parameters while eliminating the impact of confounding. The proposed model is verified using air quality and meteorological data from 52 cities over the period Jun 1 st 2013 to May 1 st 2015. Results show superiority of our model beyond baseline causality learning methods, in both time efficiency and prediction accuracy. © 2016 IEEE. postprintLink_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

In Bergen cars can only enter the central area using a toll road, so that the effect {{is similar to a}} congestion charge. Though initially intended only to raise revenues to finance road infrastructure, the urban toll ring at Oslo created an unintended congestion pricing effect, as traffic decreased by around 5%. The Trondheim Toll Scheme also has congestion pricing effects, as charges vary by time of day. The Norwegian authorities pursued authorization to implement congestion charges in cities, and legislation was approved by Parliament in 2001. In October 2011 the Norwegian government announced the introduction of rules allowing congestion charging in cities. The measure is intended to [...] cut greenhouse gas and <b>air</b> <b>pollutant</b> emissions, and relief traffic congestion. , Norwegian authorities have implemented urban charging schemes that operates both on the motorways and for access into downtown areas in five additional cities or municipalities: Haugesund, Kristiansand, Namsos, Stavanger, and Tonsberg.|$|E
500|$|Since Harper's {{government}} {{took office in}} 2006, Canadian greenhouse gas emissions fell from 749 to 726Mt of carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2 eq). From 1993 until 2006, during the previous Liberal government greenhouse gas emissions increased from 600 to 749Mt of CO2 eq. The reduction corresponded Canada's decreased economic output during the Great Recession and emissions began increasing slightly in 2010, when the economy began recovering. Other significant factors in Canada's decreased emissions during Prime Minister Harper's time in office are initiatives such as the carbon tax in British Columbia, the cap and trade system in Quebec, Ontario's coal-fired power plants, and the Clean Air Regulatory Agenda which regulates emissions for automobiles and light trucks. In 2006, Canada's Clean Air and Climate Change Act was introduced to address air pollution as well as greenhouse gas emissions; it never became law.
