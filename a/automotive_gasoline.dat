25|$|The Katana is {{commonly}} {{fitted with a}} Continental O-240 piston engine, which is both a lightweight and relatively fuel-efficient powerplant. The Rotax 912 is also equipped upon many aircraft. Variants powered by the Rotax engine have been approved for use with standard <b>automotive</b> <b>gasoline,</b> automotive-grade oil Mobil is also recommended {{for use as a}} lubricant. In the event of a loss of coolant leak, the Rotax engine is capable of 'dry running' for up to 2 hours without any resulting damage if run at or below 56 per cent power. The aircraft's constant-speed propeller is hydraulically actuated and fitted with composite blades.

40|$|Adulteration of {{gasoline}} and diesel with lower-priced materials is common in South Asia as elsewhere in the world. Some adulterants increase emissions of harmful pollutants from vehicles, worsening urban air pollution. Others do not, although there is often an indirect adverse effect on society through the loss of tax revenue. This note describes the impact {{of different types of}} adulteration on air quality and various methods for detection. Adulteration of <b>automotive</b> <b>gasolines</b> and diesel fuels is widespread throughout South Asia. This can result in sub-optimal performance of transportation fuels, and often, but not always, lead to increased tailpipe emissions of harmful pollutants.

40|$|Our work {{presents}} {{an overview of}} the use of oils/waxes obtained from thermal cracking of simulatedwaste plastics for production of <b>automotive</b> <b>gasolines</b> and diesel fuels. Experiments of simulatedwaste polymers thermal cracking in a batch reactor were carried out. Thermal cracking wasrealised at the temperature 450 °C. The principal process products, gaseous and liquid hydrocarbonfractions are similar to the refinery cracking products. Liquid cracking products are unstable due to the olefins content and their chemical composition andproperties strongly depend on the applied feed composition. Gasoline and diesel fuel fractions havebeen hydrogenated over Pd/C catalyst. Bromine numbers of the hydrogenated fuels were decreasedto the value in range 0. 02 to 6, 9 g Br 2 / 100 g of the sample. The octane numbers (RON) before hydrogenation of gasoline were in the range 80. 5 to 93. 4. Afterhydrogenation of gasoline the RON decreased to the range 61, 0 to 93, 6.
