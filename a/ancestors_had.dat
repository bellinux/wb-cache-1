5|$|Only the aye-aye, the extinct giant aye-aye, and {{the largest}} of the extinct giant sloth lemurs lack a {{functional}} strepsirrhine toothcomb. In the case of the aye-aye, the morphology of the deciduous incisors, which are lost shortly after birth, indicate that its <b>ancestors</b> <b>had</b> a toothcomb. These milk teeth are lost shortly after birth and are replaced by open-rooted, continually growing (hypselodont) incisors.|$|E
5|$|Ripley's <b>ancestors</b> <b>had</b> {{lived in}} Hingham, Massachusetts for 140 years before Jerome Ripley {{moved his family}} to Greenfield, a town {{in the western part}} of the state, in 1789.

5|$|Early in 197BC, Flamininus summoned Attalus to {{join him}} at Elateia (now in Roman hands) and from there they {{traveled}} together to attend a Boeotian council in Thebes to discuss which side Boeotia would take in the war. At the council Attalus spoke first, reminding the Boeotians of the many things he and his <b>ancestors</b> <b>had</b> done for them, but during his address he stopped talking and collapsed, with {{one side of his}} body paralyzed. Attalus was taken back to Pergamon, where he died {{around the time of the}} Battle of Cynoscephalae, which brought about the end of the Second Macedonian War.|$|E
5|$|Ezra Manning Meeker {{was born}} in Butler County, Ohio, near Huntsville, on December 29, 1830, the son of Jacob (1804–1869) and Phoebe (Baker) Meeker (1801–1854). His {{paternal}} <b>ancestors</b> <b>had</b> been among the early settlers of Elizabeth, New Jersey, where their ancestral home was located. In the American Revolutionary War, about twenty Meekers fought for the new nation. Ezra was the fourth of the six children Jacob and Phoebe had together, with older brothers John, Manning (died at age one week) and Oliver, and a younger sister Hannah and brother Clark.|$|E

5|$|Joseph Desha {{was born}} to Robert and Eleanor (Wheeler) Desha in Monroe County, Pennsylvania, on December 9, 1768. He was of part French Huguenot ancestry, and his <b>ancestors</b> <b>had</b> fled from France to Pennsylvania after the {{revocation}} of the Edict of Nantes, which had largely protected the Huguenots from religious persecution. He obtained a limited education in the state's rural schools. In July 1781, Desha's family relocated to Fayette County, Kentucky, and the following year, they settled {{in what was then}} known as Cumberland district near the present-day city of Gallatin, Tennessee. Desha's younger brother, Robert, would later represent Tennessee in the U.S. House of Representatives.|$|E
5|$|Siphonaptera is a {{relatively}} small order of insects: members of the order undergo complete metamorphosis and are secondarily wingless (their <b>ancestors</b> <b>had</b> wings which modern forms have lost). In 2005, Medvedev listed 2005 species in 242 genera, and despite subsequent descriptions of new species, bringing the total up to around 2500 species, {{this is the most}} complete database available. The order is divided into four infraorders and eighteen families. Some families are exclusive to a single host group; these include the Malacopsyllidae (armadillos), Ischnopsyllidae (bats) and Chimaeropsyllidae (elephant shrews).|$|E
5|$|The Parsons {{family was}} a {{prominent}} family whose <b>ancestors</b> <b>had</b> arrived to the Thirteen Colonies from England in 1635, and relocated to Hampshire County around 1740. Parsons' paternal grandfather, {{of which he is}} a likely namesake, Isaac Parsons (1752–1796) served {{as a member of the}} Virginia House of Delegates representing Hampshire County from 1789 until his death in 1796; and operated a public ferry across the South Branch Potomac River. Through his mother, Parsons was a great-grandson of Colonial Virginia military officer William Foreman (died 1777). Parsons was raised through childhood to adulthood on his family's Wappocomo plantation north of Romney.|$|E

5|$|De Hauteclocque {{came from}} an old line of country nobility. His direct <b>ancestors</b> <b>had</b> served in the Fifth Crusade against Egypt, {{and again in the}} Eighth Crusade of Saint Louis against Tunisia in 1270. They had also fought at the Battle of Saint-Omer in 1340 and the Battle of Fontenoy in 1745. The family managed to survive the French Revolution. Three members of the family served in Napoleon's Grande Armée and a fourth, who {{suffered}} from weak health, served in the supply train. The third son, Constantin, who had served in Napoleon's Russian Campaign, was created a chevalier by King Louis XVIII, and a Papal count by Pope Pius IX in 1857. Constantin had two sons. The older, Alfred Francois Marie (1822–1902), died childless. The younger, Gustave Francois Marie Joseph (1829–1914), became a noted Egyptologist.|$|E
5|$|Gray {{was born}} in Sauquoit, New York, on November 18, 1810, to Moses Gray (b.February26, 1786), then a tanner, and Roxanna Howard Gray (b. March 15, 1789). Born {{in the back of}} his father's tannery, Gray was the eldest of their eight children. Gray's {{paternal}} great-grandfather had arrived in Boston from Northern Ireland in 1718; Gray's Scotch-Irish Presbyterian <b>ancestors</b> <b>had</b> moved to New York from Massachusetts and Vermont after Shays' Rebellion. His parents married on July30, 1809. Tanneries needed a lot of wood to burn, and the lumber supply in the area had been shrinking, so Gray's father used his profits to buy farms in the area, and in about 1823 sold the tannery and became a farmer.|$|E
5|$|In 1913, the Jockey Club and {{the owners}} of the General Stud Book passed a {{regulation}} named by the foreign press after the Jockey Club's senior steward, Lord Jersey, prohibiting the registration of horses in the book unless all of their <b>ancestors</b> <b>had</b> been registered. Despite protests from American breeders, the regulation remained in force until 1949. Among the factors influencing its relaxation were the racing success of ineligible horses in Europe and the damage caused to British and Irish breeders by the unavailability of French Thoroughbreds during and after the Second World War. In addition, by 1949 the possibly impure ancestors of the American bloodlines had receded far back in most horses' ancestry.|$|E

5|$|Rudolf Caracciola {{was born}} in Remagen, Germany, on 30 January 1901. He was the fourth child of Maximilian and Mathilde, who ran the Hotel Fürstenberg. His <b>ancestors</b> <b>had</b> {{migrated}} during the Thirty Years' War from Naples to the German Rhineland, where Prince Bartolomeo Caracciolo (nephew of Spanish-allegiance Field Marshal Tommaso Caracciolo) had commanded the Ehrenbreitstein Fortress near Koblenz. Caracciola was interested in cars from a young age, and from his fourteenth birthday {{wanted to become a}} racing driver. He drove an early Mercedes during the First World War, and gained his driver's license before the legal age of 18. After Caracciola's graduation from school soon after the war, his father wanted him to attend university, but when he died Caracciola instead became an apprentice in the Fafnir automobile factory in Aachen.|$|E
5|$|By {{the end of}} this era, Rome {{had become}} full of {{unemployed}} Plebeians. They then began filling the ranks of the assemblies, {{and the fact that they}} were no longer away from Rome made it easier for them to vote. In the principle legislative assembly, the Plebeian Council, any individual voted in the Tribe that his <b>ancestors</b> <b>had</b> belonged to. Thus, most of these newly unemployed Plebeians belonged to one of the thirty-one rural Tribes, rather than one of the four urban Tribes, and the unemployed Plebeians soon acquired so much political power that the Plebeian Council became highly populist. These Plebeians were often angry with the aristocracy, which further exacerbated the class tensions. Their economic state usually led them to vote for the candidate who offered the most for them, or at least for the candidate whose games or whose bribes were the most magnificent. The fact that they were usually uninformed as to the issues before them didn't matter, because they usually sold their votes to the highest bidder anyway. Bribery became such a problem that major reforms were ultimately passed, in particular the requirement that all votes be by secret ballot. A new culture of dependency was emerging, which would look to any populist leader for relief.|$|E
5|$|Stephanus Johannes Paulus Kruger {{was born}} on 10 October 1825 at Bulhoek, a farm in the Steynsburg area of the Cape Colony, the third child and second son of Casper Jan Hendrik Kruger, a farmer, and his wife Elsie (Elisa; née Steyn). The family was of Dutch-speaking Afrikaner or Boer background, of German, French Huguenot and Dutch stock. His {{paternal}} <b>ancestors</b> <b>had</b> been in South Africa since 1713, when Jacob Krüger, from Berlin, arrived in Cape Town as a 17-year-old soldier in the Dutch East India Company's service. Jacob's children dropped the umlaut from the family name, a common practice among South Africans of German origin, and over the following generations Kruger's paternal forebears moved into the interior. His mother's family, the Steyns, had lived in South Africa since 1668 and were relatively affluent and cultured by Cape standards. Kruger's great-great-uncle Hermanus Steyn had been President of the self-declared Republic of Swellendam that revolted against Company rule in 1795.|$|E

5|$|The Kalachuris were {{originally}} immigrants into the southern Deccan from central India and called themselves Kalanjarapuravaradhisavaras. Bijjala II and his <b>ancestors</b> <b>had</b> governed as Chalukya commanders (Mahamandaleshwar) over the Karhad-4000 and Tardavadi-1000 provinces (overlapping region in present-day Karnataka and Maharashtra) with Mangalavada or Annigeri as their capital. Bijjala II's Chikkalagi record of 1157 calls him Mahabhujabala Chakravarti ("emperor with powerful shoulders and arms") indicating {{he no longer}} was a subordinate of the Chalukyas. However the successors of Bijjala II were unable {{to hold on to}} Kalyani and their rule ended in 1183 when the last Chalukya scion, Someshvara IV made a final bid to regain the empire by recapturing Kalyani. Kalachuri King Sankama was killed by Chalukya general Narasimha in this conflict. During this time, Hoysala Veera Ballala II was growing ambitious and clashed on several occasions with the Chalukyas and the other claimants over their empire. He defeated Chalukya Someshvara IV and Seuna Bhillama V bringing large regions in the Krishna River valley under the Hoysala domains, but was unsuccessful against Kalachuris. The Seunas under Bhillama V were on an imperialistic expansion too when the Chalukyas regained Kalyani. Their ambitions were temporarily stemmed by their defeat against Chalukya general Barma in 1183 but they later had their vengeance in 1189.|$|E
