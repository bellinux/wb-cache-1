5|$|Illinois {{was ordered}} on 9 September 1940, and {{initially}} laid down on 6 December 1942. However, work was suspended pending <b>a</b> <b>decision</b> <b>on</b> whether {{to convert the}} hull to an aircraft carrier. Upon determination the result would cost more and be less capable than building from scratch construction resumed, but was canceled for good approximately one-quarter complete on 11 August 1945. She was sold for scrap and broken up on the slipway in September 1958.|$|E
5|$|It {{is illegal}} {{for a public}} {{authority}} to fetter its own decision-making power, either by adhering too strictly to a policy, or by making <b>a</b> <b>decision</b> <b>on</b> the basis of another person's decision or delegating {{the responsibility of the}} decision-making process to another person.|$|E
50|$|On 31 March 2016, {{one week}} after the {{conviction}} of Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic, the ICTY found Šešelj not guilty on all charges, with <b>a</b> majority <b>decision</b> <b>on</b> eight counts and <b>a</b> unanimous <b>decision</b> <b>on</b> one.|$|R
50|$|In {{decision}} theory and quantitative policy analysis, the expected value of including uncertainty (EVIU) is the expected {{difference in the}} value of <b>a</b> <b>decision</b> based <b>on</b> <b>a</b> probabilistic analysis versus <b>a</b> <b>decision</b> based <b>on</b> <b>an</b> analysis that ignores uncertainty.|$|R
50|$|Muhammad Ali and Leon Spinks fought two boxing matches {{with each}} other. Their first match {{took place on}} February 15, 1978 and the second on September 15, 1978.

5|$|Kleinman {{contacted}} {{a pair of}} Canadian graphic novel {{artists to}} begin the storyboarding process. Storyboarding the commercial meant that the agency could determine {{how much of the}} £1.3M budget to allocate to each section, and provided them with visuals to use as part of the presentation to Diageo when pitching the various concepts for <b>a</b> <b>decision</b> <b>on</b> which to pursue. The effort paid off and approval was given to move ahead with production.|$|E
5|$|On 3 January 1523, the Zurich {{city council}} invited the clergy {{of the city}} and {{outlying}} region to a meeting to allow the factions to present their opinions. The bishop was invited to attend or to send a representative. The council would render <b>a</b> <b>decision</b> <b>on</b> who would be allowed to continue to proclaim their views. This meeting, the first Zurich disputation, took place on 29 January 1523.|$|E
5|$|Andrea Bowen, {{who starred}} as Susan's daughter, Julie, {{departed}} from the cast, as her character left for college {{at the end of}} the fourth season. Teri Hatcher expressed disappointment in the producers' decision, but Cherry stated that Bowen would return in the future. Joy Lauren, who portrayed Bree's daughter, Danielle, and Lyndsy Fonseca, who played Katherine's daughter, Dylan, also left the main cast, although the former appeared in the season premiere as a guest star. Because the fourth season ended leaving Mike's whereabouts unknown, James Denton's return to the series was questioned during hiatus. Denton stated in May2008 that producers would not make <b>a</b> <b>decision</b> <b>on</b> his character until mid-June and that he was preparing to find work in case his contract was terminated. It was later confirmed that he would return to the series.|$|E

30|$|The {{proposed}} policy {{consists of}} an adaptive preventive maintenance policy and buffer levels for each production stage. The preventive maintenance and buffer allocation policy is characterized by <b>a</b> dynamic <b>decision</b> <b>on</b> the time between the preventive actions, and <b>a</b> dynamic <b>decision</b> <b>on</b> the maximum level of the buffers’ storage allowed. The objective is to obtain a policy adaptable to the production line conditions reducing redesign activities.|$|R
50|$|<b>A</b> final <b>decision</b> <b>on</b> {{the project}} (e.g. to {{decommission}} or extend funding) was due by end 2016, and <b>a</b> <b>decision</b> {{to close the}} facility was made in December 2016.|$|R
5|$|Another {{question}} of contention was the Progress Party's policy on Norwegian {{membership in the}} European Union. Reportedly, Carl I. Hagen wanted to postpone <b>a</b> <b>decision</b> <b>on</b> European Union policy from the national convention to a national board meeting in June. Others were {{not in favor of}} this. In an interview, Hagen stated that political parties should not agitate officially for one opinion or the other. He stated an indifference towards EU membership, and that if accessing the Union, Norway could always use a veto against EU policies when needed. Central board member Terje Sæbø submitted a competing resolution which opposed Norwegian membership.|$|E
5|$|By late 1962 <b>a</b> <b>decision</b> <b>on</b> {{whether or}} not to deploy Zeus was looming. Bell began {{considering}} a replacement for the Zeus missile that would operate at much shorter ranges, and in October, sent out study contracts to three contractors to be returned in February. Even before these were returned, in January 1963 McNamara announced that the construction funds allocated for Zeus would not be released, and the funding would instead be used for development of a new system using the latest technologies. The name Nike-X was apparently an ad hoc suggestion by Jack Ruina, the director of ARPA, who was tasked with presenting the options to the President's Science Advisory Committee (PSAC). With the ending of Zeus, the ZMAR radar effort was renamed MAR, and plans for an even more powerful version, MAR-II, became {{the central part of the}} Nike-X concept.|$|E
5|$|Elsewhere in the campaign, {{transport}} {{remained a}} major issue. David Cameron's deferral in December 2015 of <b>a</b> <b>decision</b> <b>on</b> {{plans for a}} third runway at Heathrow Airport {{until after the election}} was interpreted as an attempt to avoid a clash with Goldsmith, his party's candidate, on the issue. Caroline Pidgeon and Siân Berry both promised changes to the fares system to reduce commuter costs on the Tube, while Khan and incumbent Conservative mayor Boris Johnson clashed over planned Tube strikes. An early January 2016 poll gave Khan a 10-point lead over Goldsmith, with bookmakers and pundits all favouring a Khan victory, though most agreed that the race was still open. Towards the end of January, provisional English Democrats candidate Winston McKenzie appeared on reality TV show Celebrity Big Brother, quickly being voted off and causing over 400 complaints to Ofcom following his negative comments about homosexuality.|$|E

5|$|In 1600 Lew Sapieha led a Commonwealth {{mission to}} Moscow {{to propose a}} union with the Russian state, {{patterned}} after the Polish–Lithuanian Union, with the boyars granted rights comparable {{with those of the}} Commonwealth's nobility. <b>A</b> <b>decision</b> <b>on</b> a single monarch was to be postponed until the death of the current king or tsar. Boris Godunov, at that time also engaged in negotiations with Charles of Sweden, wasn't interested in that close a relationship and only a twenty-year truce was agreed upon in 1602.|$|E
5|$|In July 1676 Carbery {{called for}} a hearing against Morgan {{in front of the}} Assembly of Jamaica, accusing him of collaborating with the French to attack Spanish interests. Morgan {{admitted}} he had met the French officials, but indicated that that this was diplomatic relations, rather than anything duplicitous. In the summer of 1677 the Lords of Trade said they had yet to come to <b>a</b> <b>decision</b> <b>on</b> the matter and in early 1678 the king and the Privy Council recalled Carbery from Jamaica, leaving Morgan as governor for three months. In July 1678 Charles Howard, 1st Earl of Carlisle was appointed governor.|$|E
5|$|In September 2016, {{as part of}} the broadcaster's Compete Or Compare Strategy, the BBC {{confirmed}} the show {{would be one of the}} first put up for tender.

The file was submitted to the CPS three months after Black's January 2016 death, although the CPS stated that due to his death, {{they would not be}} making <b>a</b> posthumous <b>decision</b> <b>on</b> charging Black.|$|R
50|$|On December 10 and 14, 1908, Blackburn met {{competent}} Southpaw boxer Jack Robinson at the Broadway and West End Athletic Clubs in Philadelphia, {{winning in}} <b>a</b> close newspaper <b>decision</b> <b>on</b> the tenth, {{and again in}} <b>a</b> six-round newspaper <b>decision</b> <b>on</b> the fourteenth.|$|R
5|$|In {{the case}} of ministerial discretion, it has been {{established}} in Carltona Ltd. v. Commissioner of Works (1943) that it is not unlawful for a civil servant to take <b>a</b> <b>decision</b> <b>on</b> behalf of the minister, even where a statute confers discretion on a minister. Parliament will expect only that the power is to be exercised by an appropriate official. However, the minister is ultimately responsible for decisions taken on his or her behalf. While there has been discussion in case law about whether a minister should be required to personally exercise discretion in decisions that affect a person's liberty, the courts have usually been reluctant to hold so. Such a requirement, however, has been made by way of statutes which require the minister to act personally.|$|E
5|$|In {{the event}} of an absence, disability, or other cause {{preventing}} the mayor from performing his duties, the mayor may designate the business administrator or any other department head as acting mayor for up to 60 days. In {{the event of}} a vacancy in the office, the President of the City Council becomes acting mayor, and the council has 30 days to name an interim mayor. If no interim mayor is named, the Council President continues as acting mayor until a successor is elected, or the council reorganizes and selects a new President. Prior to 1971, there was no automatic succession law. The office was left vacant for 47 days in 1963 when the City Council failed to reach <b>a</b> <b>decision</b> <b>on</b> appointing an interim mayor.|$|E
5|$|On 20 January 1954, 706 Squadron, a second-line unit, flew aboard {{to conduct}} {{trials of the}} anti-submarine version of the Whirlwind helicopter. They were {{successful}} enough that the squadron was redesignated as 845 Squadron afterwards and Perseus ferried them to Malta in April. The ship continued on to deliver relief supplies to Singapore intended for Korea and was reduced to reserve again upon her return on 12 July. The Admiralty intended to convert her to a submarine depot ship and she was towed to Belfast to begin work in 1955. The cutbacks from the 1957 Defence White Paper caused the conversion to be cancelled and the ship was towed to Gare Loch to await <b>a</b> <b>decision</b> <b>on</b> the ship's disposition. Perseus sold for scrap in May 1958 and towed to Port Glasgow to begin demolition.|$|E

On 31 October 2011, Ismayil Omarov, the director general of Azerbaijani national broadcaster İctimai Television announced that <b>a</b> <b>decision</b> <b>on</b> the venue choice would {{be taken by the}} steering committee in January 2012. On 25 January 2012, it was confirmed that the Baku Crystal Hall would be the venue of the contest. Even though the venue had an extended capacity of 23,000 people, only 16,000 people were able to attend each show. Tickets for the contest became available online for purchase on 28 February 2012.|$|E
5|$|On June 21, 2014, Solo {{was arrested}} and charged with two {{misdemeanor}} counts of assault in the fourth degree; one against her half-sister and the other against her nephew. She was booked under her married name of Hope Amelia Stevens. After pleading not guilty, she was released the following day. In August, her trial was scheduled for November 4, 2014, but this was later delayed until January 20, 2015. On December 30, 2014, the judge ordered more depositions from the defendants and delayed <b>a</b> <b>decision</b> <b>on</b> whether charges against Solo would be dropped until January 6, 2015.|$|E
