40|$|Analogue (and addressable) fire {{detection}} systems enables a new quality in improving sensitivity to real fires and reducing susceptibility to nuisance alarm sources. Different decision algorithms types were developed with intention to improve sensitivity and reduce false <b>alarm</b> <b>occurrence.</b> At the beginning, it was free alarm level adjustment based on preset level. Majority of multi-criteria decision work was based on multi-sensor (multi-signature) decision algorithms - using different type of sensors on the same location or, rather, using different aspects (level and rise) of one sensor measured value. Our idea is to improve sensitivity and reduce false <b>alarm</b> <b>occurrence</b> by forming groups of sensors that work in similar conditions (same world side in the building, same or similar technology or working time). Original multi-criteria decision algorithms based on level, rise and difference of level and rise from group average are discussed in this paper...|$|E
40|$|Abstract — With {{the current}} default {{settings}} of the OSPF parameters, the network takes several tens of seconds before {{recovering from a}} failure. The main component in this delay is {{the time required to}} detect the failure using Hello protocol. Failure detection time can be speeded up by reducing the value of HelloInterval. However, too small a value of HelloInterval will result in an increased chance of network congestion causing loss of several consecutive Hellos, thus leading to false breakdown of adjacency between routers. Such false alarms not only disrupt network traffic by causing unnecessary routing changes but also increase the processing load on the routers which may potentially lead to routing instability. In this paper, we investigate the following question- What is the optimal value for the HelloInterval that will lead to fast failure detection in the network while keeping the false <b>alarm</b> <b>occurrence</b> within acceptable limits? We examine the impact of both network congestion and the network topology on the optimal HelloInterval value. Additionally, we investigate the effectiveness of faster failure detection in achieving faster failure recovery in OSPF networks. (Abstract) Keywords—Failure Recovery; OSPF (key words...|$|E
40|$|Some of {{unexpected}} fires may self-extinguish due to insufficient heat re-lease or air supply and {{some may be}} discovered and controlled by occupants. Accordingly an automatic fire detection system {{plays an important role}} in cases where effective human detection measures couldn't be expected. In Japan, auto-matic fire detection systems have been obligatorily installed in buildings for specific uses having a floor space above a certain value as prescribed by the Fire Service Law. Automatic fire detection systems seem to be considerably effective but there are many cases where the bell of the control unit does not operate because the custodians of the buildings keep the bell switched off in order to avoid false alarms. The probabilities of giving false alarm per year per detector are 6. 5 % in smoke detectors and 0. 8 % in heat detectors. There seem to be two current trends in the solution of false alarm problems. One is "right detector in the right place " and the other is to increase the informa-tion content on which discrimination between genuine fires and fire simulating phenomena can be made. Several methods have already been put into practice to greatly reduce the probability of false <b>alarm</b> <b>occurrence</b> to l%/year·detector, and much more sophisticated fire detection systems will be adopted in near future...|$|E

40|$|Abstract—To {{investigate}} obstructive {{sleep apnea}} syndrome mechanisms, we developed a device to measure the surface elec-tromyogram (EMG) time latency reflex of the genioglossus muscle stimulated by time and amplitude calibrated negative pharyngeal pressure drops. The reflex signals {{were found to be}} disturbed by transient signals that generate false alarms. Thus, to reduce false <b>alarm</b> <b>occurrences</b> we designed an adaptive multiscale method. Continuous wavelet transform (CWT) is widely used in biomedical signal event detection processes. The Berkner transform is an approximation of a CWT that is based on a hierarchical scheme similar to discrete wavelet transform. We used the Berkner trans-form to build a multiscale detector because it offers the possibility of maxima coefficients linkage that leads to good accuracy in reflex onset localization. As a contribution to this novel approach we used a reconstruction formula to develop an adaptive method for scale range determination in our surface EMG reflex detector. Finally, we characterized our detector in terms of accuracy and robustness, first on synthesized signals and second, on signals acquired on apneic patients and healthy subjects. Preliminary results showed a significant difference (p 0 01) between the two populations regarding the genioglossus muscle mean latency time. These physiological findings may partly explain why the upper airway protective reflex occurring when a negative pressure is applied to the upper airway is ineffective in OSA patients, leading to pharyngeal collapse.

40|$|Determination {{of annual}} {{lamination}} provides important additional constraints to radiometric dates on speleothems, both for dating {{the duration of}} specific growth intervals and optimizing growth models. In the absence of visible laminae, however, speleothem age models are reliant upon curve fitting through discretely dated points and are therefore inherently more uncertain than annual chronologies from laminae. Given {{that the impact of}} seasonality on speleothems is expected to be strong enough to generate an annual pulse in trace element chemistry {{regardless of whether or not}} visible or fluorescent growth laminae are visible, we demonstrate the potential for deriving high-resolution stalagmite chronologies from non-laminated samples using annual chemical variations in stalagmites from two Alpine caves (Obir, Austria and Ernesto, NE Italy). Trace element data were obtained by ion microprobe analyses for H, P, Mg, Na, Sr and Ba and the annual signal was sought using spectral and wavelet analysis. An automated chemical peak-counting software tool was developed in MATLAB&# 169;. It counts significant annual peaks using criteria of minimum amplitude in relation to the local standard deviation of signal variation and minimum separation between peaks determined by the thickness of the preceding layers. Verification of the tool using visibly laminated samples suggests the software is a reliable and accurate method of chronology building, with hit ratios greater than 0. 93 and less than 0. 75 &# 37; false <b>alarm</b> <b>occurrences.</b> Used in conjunction with other dating methods such as radiocarbon, U–Th and sulphur peak dating, the automated chemical laminae chronology-building approach provides a more meaningful alternative to simple age-depth curve fitting for non-laminated samples...|$|R

The aim {{of the present study}} was to prospectively validate this syncope warning system during head-up tilt table testing. Methods and Results: Simultaneous heart rate (HR) and pulse wave changes in 19 consecutive syncopepatients undergoing 70 ° head-up tilt table testing, generated a syncope risk score that triggered a syncope prediction alarm. The pulsearrival time (PAT) was defined as the time between the R-peak in theelectrocardiogram and the onset of the pulse wave in the photoplethysmogram. With a syncope prediction alarm based on HR and PAT, all syncopes were detected. No false alarm was generated in patients withnegative HUT.

40|$|Being able to forcast extreme {{volatility}} is {{a central}} issue in financial risk management. We present a large volatility predicting method based {{on the distribution of}} recurrence intervals between volatilities exceeding a certain threshold Q for a fixed expected recurrence time τ_Q. We find that the recurrence intervals are well approximated by the q-exponential distribution for all stocks and all τ_Q values. Thus a analytical formula for determining the hazard probability W(Δ t |t) that a volatility above Q will occur within a short interval Δ t if the last volatility exceeding Q happened t periods ago can be directly derived from the q-exponential distribution, which is found to be in good agreement with the empirical hazard probability from real stock data. Using these results, we adopt a decision-making algorithm for triggering the <b>alarm</b> of the <b>occurrence</b> of the next volatility above Q based on the hazard probability. Using a "receiver operator characteristic" (ROC) analysis, we find that this predicting method efficiently forecasts the occurrance of large volatility events in real stock data.

40|$|Prevalence of {{pathogenic}} multi-drug resistant (MDR) extended-spectrum β-lactamase (ESBL) -producing Escherichia coli {{is rapidly}} increasing, becoming a global concern. In a veterinary context, ESBL-producing E. coli are mostly reported in poultry and pigs. Here, {{we report on}} the prevalence and characterize ESBL-producing E. coli isolated from diverse dairy farms in China. Overall, 36 (23. 53 %) out of 153 E. coli isolates from mastitic milk samples (n= 1252) were confirmed as ESBL-producers by double-disc synergy testing and PCR. Nucleotide analysis of PCR amplicons revealed that blaCTX-M was the predominant ESBL gene detected in 28 (77. 78 %) isolates, with blaCTX-M- 15 being the major (78. 57 %) allele encoding for ESBLs. Also, 22 (55. 56 %) and 6 (16. 67 %) of the ESBL isolates were carrying blaTEM and blaSHV genes, respectively, in singlet or in combination. The majority of these isolates belonged to phylo-group A (69. 44 %) and D (16. 67 %). Strikingly, all these isolates were found MDR reflecting high resistance (58 - 100 %) to cephalosporins, including the fourth generation cefepime and non β-lactams. Additionally, class 1 integrons (intI 1) were found in 30 (83. 33 %) isolates. Analysis of the integron 1 variable region encoding gene cassette indicated that they were carrying up to five different gene cassettes conferring resistance to various drugs with a predominant combination of dfrA 17 -aadA 5 genes in tandem. However, no ESBL encoding genes were found in the cassettes. Interestingly, 22 (66. 11 %) of the ESBL isolates were also carrying insertion sequence common region 1 (ISCR 1) which was found associated with most of the ESBL genes. Altogether, the current report on the high prevalence of ESBL-positive E. coli, particularly CTX-M- 15, carrying integron 1 and ISCR 1 elements are likely indicative of their rapid and wider dissemination, posing threats to veterinary and public health.

During RT conditions, algal blooms {{spread out in}} the estuarine, marine and fresh waters due to different triggering factors such as nutrient loading, marine currents, and monsoonal winds. The Persian Gulf (PG) was a talent region subjected to different RTs in recent decade. A massive RT started from the Strait of Hormuz in October 2008 and extended towards the northern parts of the PG covering more than 1200 km of coastlines. The bloom of microorganism C. Polykrikoides was the main specie that generated large fish mortalities, and hampered marine industries, and water desalination appliances. Ocean color satellite data have many advantages to monitor and <b>alarm</b> RT <b>occurrences,</b> such as wide and continuous extent, short time of imagery, high accessibility, and appropriate estimation of ocean color parameters. Since 1999, MODerate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) satellite sensor has estimated satellite derived chlorophyll-a (Chl-a), normalized fluorescence line height (nFLH), and diffuse attenuation coefficient at 490 nm (kd 490). It provides a capability to study the behavior of these parameters during RT and normal conditions. This study monitors variations in satellite derived Chl-a, nFLH, and kd 490 under both RT and normal conditions of the PG between 2002 and 2008. Up to now, daily and monthly variations in these products were no synchronously investigated under RT conditions in the PG. In doing so, the MODIS L 1 B products were provided from NASA data archive. They were corrected for Rayleigh scattering and gaseous absorption, and atmospheric interference in turbid coastal waters, and then converted to level 2 data. In addition, Enhanced Red Green Blue (ERGB) image was used to illustrate better water variations. ERGB image was built with three normalized leaving water radiance between 443 to 560 nm. All the above data processes were applied by SeaDAS 7 software package. The Strait of Hormuz {{was selected as the}} study area {{in the eastern part of}} the PG.

All the above calculations and presentations were performed in Matlab 7 software package. The results show that MODIS Chl-a, nFLH, and kd 490 increased during the 2008 RT. Based on the feedback of these parameters under RT conditions, hybrid ocean color index (HOCI) is defined. HOCI is able to display better water variations during RT outbreak.

Assim, decidiu-se realizar uma pesquisa envolvendo o brinquedo terapêutico com crianças vítimas de violência institucionalizadas (abuso sexual e ou abuso físico e ou negligência). O brinquedo terapêutico, com cunho cuidativo, terá uma conotação de brinquedo não diretivo que dá à criança a liberdade de expressar-se verbal e não verbalmente, proporcionando as mesmas um meio confortável de contarem seus medos e preocupações, ajudando ao mesmo tempo, a enfermeira a perceber suas necessidades e sentimentos. A pesquisa foi aprovada pelo Comitê de Ética da Universidade Federal de Santa Catarina, Florianópolis, Brasil. Trata-se de uma Pesquisa Convergente Assistencial (PCA), de abordagem qualitativa, desenvolvida com quatro crianças entre nove e onze anos, residentes em instituições diferentes. O acolhimento a estas crianças deu-se através do brinquedo terapêutico, utilizado pela enfermeira/pesquisadora no âmbito do cuidado as crianças e promoção de cuidados adequados. Os objetivos deste estudo consistiram em elaborar um modelo de cuidado de Enfermagem as crianças vítimas de violência residentes em Casas Lares, utilizando o brinquedo terapêutico e avaliar a contribuição do brinquedo terapêutico em um modelo de cuidado de enfermagem. Com o desenvolver da metodologia proposta obtivemos uma série de resultados positivos com as crianças, as mesmas com o passar das sessões de brinquedo terapêutico conseguiram expressar seus sentimentos, medos, angústias, falar de seu mundo real e imaginal, entre outros. Assim, os resultados evidenciaram que a metodologia desenvolvida é adequada para a aplicação deste modo de cuidar nesta situação, e que, além de um cuidado imediato poderemos incentivar a promoção da saúde, através do cunho educativo e de estratégias de cuidado em longo prazo. Child {{abuse is}} {{noted for its}} <b>alarming</b> rates of <b>occurrence.</b> The {{consequences}} of child abuse may be acute or chronic. Given that, one perceives the need for amplifying the theoretical-methodological knowledge which assists nursing professionals who aid victims of child abuse. In this context, Nursing can make available a necessary instrument of care: therapeutic playing. Thus, this study was elaborated and carried out, involving therapeutic playing with institutionalized child abuse victims (sexual abuse, physical abuse, or negligence). Therapeutic playing, with intent for care, will have the connotation of non-directive playing which gives the child the freedom to express him/herself both verbally and non-verbally. Such expression is proportioned within a comfortable atmosphere, in which the child can relay his/her fears and concerns. Such interaction helps the nurse to perceive the child's needs and feelings. This study {{was approved by the}} Ethics Committee of the Federal University of Santa Catarina, in Florianópolis, Santa Catarina, Brazil. It is an Assistencial Convergent Study (PCA) and uses a qualitative approach. Four children, between nine and eleven years of age participated, all residents of different institutions. Approaching these children and gaining their confidence occurred through the use of therapeutic playing by the part of the nurse/researcher within the atmosphere of care and promotion of adequate care for the children. The objectives of this study were to elaborate a Nursing care model for victims of child abuse who are residents of "Casas Lares", using therapeutic playing; and to evaluate the contribution of therapeutic playing in a Nursing care model. With the development of the proposed methodology, a series of positive results with the children were obtained. As the therapeutic playing sessions transgressed, the same children were able to express their feelings, fears, anguishes, their views of their specific worlds, their views of their imaginary worlds, and other issues. Thus, the results evidence that the methodology developed is adequate for its application in similar care situations. They also evidence that the Nursing practice may offer incentives, beyond its immediate care, towards health promotion in general, by means of embracing education and long-term care strategies...|$|R
