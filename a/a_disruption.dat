5|$|With {{global warming}} causing glaciers and {{permafrost}} to melt rapidly and allowing {{a large amount}} of fresh water to flow into the oceans, there are concerns that if the amount of fresh water in the oceans reaches a critical point, there will be <b>a</b> <b>disruption</b> in the thermohaline circulation. Considering the blue whale's migratory patterns are based on ocean temperature, <b>a</b> <b>disruption</b> in this circulation, which moves warm and cold water around the world, would be likely to have an effect on their migration. The whales summer in the cool, high latitudes, where they feed in krill-abundant waters; they winter in warmer, low latitudes, where they mate and give birth.|$|E
5|$|As with Seasons, the Triforce {{calls out}} to Link. Link is transported to a forest {{in the land of}} Labrynna, where he hears screaming. In a clearing, Link finds a woman encircled by monsters. When the monsters see Link, they scatter in all directions. The woman is Princess Zelda's nurse, Impa, who asks Link to help her find a singer in the forest. Continuing through the forest, the two find Nayru, a young woman with blue hair singing on a tree stump, {{surrounded}} by forest creatures. A shadow emerges from Impa and reveals itself as Veran, Sorceress of Shadows. Veran soars into Nayru's body and possesses her. Nayru was the Oracle of Ages; her abduction causes <b>a</b> <b>disruption</b> in the time flow of Labrynna.|$|E
5|$|Bronchial {{injuries}} {{are divided into}} those that are accompanied by <b>a</b> <b>disruption</b> of the pleura {{and those that are}} not; in the former, air can leak from the hole in the airway and a pneumothorax can form. The latter type is associated with more minor signs; pneumothorax is small if it occurs at all, and although function is lost in the part of the lung supplied by the injured bronchus, unaffected parts of the lungs may be able to compensate.|$|E

5|$|The {{origins of}} Vivienne-Fanja are unclear {{as a result}} of sparseness of data, due to <b>a</b> <b>disruption</b> in {{satellite}} imagery coverage. It is estimated that a tropical low formed on January23 west of Christmas Island in the Australian basin. The Bureau of Meteorology named the storm Vivienne, which gradually intensified while moving to the west. On January27, the cyclone crossed 80°E into the southwest Indian Ocean, at which time it was renamed Fanja. While in the basin, the storm reached peak winds of 80km/h (50mph). It continued moving to the southwest before dissipating on January30.|$|E
5|$|A 300-strong Special Operations Task Group (SOTG) was {{subsequently}} deployed {{to support the}} Reconstruction Taskforce in April 2007, including a commando company group, elements of the SASR, and an integral combat service support team. In {{the latter part of}} 2008 the commando company conducted <b>a</b> <b>disruption</b> operation in Helmand province as part of Operation Eagle's Summit, which was a major coalition operation conducted in support of the transport and installation of an additional turbine for the Kajaki Dam hydroelectric facility. In March and April 2009, SOTG killed 80 Taliban fighters in a major four-week operation in Helmand Province, without suffering any casualties. Further operations undertaken include the Battle of Gizab in April 2010, and the Shah Wali Kot Offensive in June 2010, which resulted in heavy insurgent casualties. The bulk of SOTG was withdrawn from Afghanistan in late 2013 as part of a drawdown of Australian forces, although some special forces remained after this date as part of the small Australian force maintained in the country. The Regiment lost 12 personnel killed while deployed to Afghanistan, along with one killed during a pre-deployment exercise.|$|E
5|$|At {{the same}} time, Skanderbeg {{had been at}} war with Venice. Realizing the {{magnitude}} of his challenge, Skanderbeg attempted to relieve the garrison by engaging in skirmishes with the Ottoman army. His forces succeeded in inflicting heavy casualties on the Turkish forces through guerrilla-style attacks. Efforts were made by Skanderbeg to use intelligence forces, operating as far as Constantinople, to gather information on Murad's plans of action. Meanwhile, near Scutari, {{he had been able}} to defeat a Venetian force and managed to considerably weaken the Venetian presence in Albania. Despite these efforts, on July 31 the garrison of Svetigrad surrendered due to <b>a</b> <b>disruption</b> in the water supply. The garrison was spared and a force of Ottoman Janissaries was stationed inside the fortress instead. Two years later, Murad would march against Krujë, only to suffer a heavy defeat.|$|E

5|$|Belgrano and Saavedra, {{representing}} {{the military and}} the intellectuals, got an interview with Cisneros to request an open cabildo, but without getting an answer. Cisneros called the military leaders and requested their support, but they refused, under the grounds that his viceroyalty lacked legitimacy. Castelli and other patriots insisted in their request, and Cisneros finally accepted. A massive demonstration the following day ensured that Cisneros would keep his word. The open cabildo was held on 22 May, with all political leaders present, and armed men filling the Plaza and ready to invade the cabildo in case the peninsulars attempted <b>a</b> <b>disruption,</b> which would be indicated by a signal from Belgrano. He supported the stance of his cousin Castelli, who made a speech explaining the concept of the retroversion of the sovereignty of the people, and that Spanish America was subject to the King of Spain but not to Spain itself. At the time of voting, Castelli's proposal was coupled with the one of Cornelio Saavedra, with Belgrano among its supporters. This joint proposal for the removal of Cisneros {{and the creation of a}} government junta prevailed over the others. However, the cabildo attempted to keep Cisneros in power in spite of this result, by creating a junta with Cisneros as its president. This was rejected by the revolutionary leaders and the population. A great state of turmoil ended when the Junta was disbanded on 25 May and replaced by the Primera Junta. Belgrano was included in this junta, among many other local politicians.|$|E
5|$|In the United States, the Louisiana Governor's Office of Homeland Security and Emergency Preparedness {{activated}} its Crisis Action Team on August 16 {{to monitor}} the storm and coordinate preparation. Governor of Louisiana Kathleen Blanco {{declared a state of}} emergency early on the evening of August 17, asking for a presidential emergency declaration to give Louisiana access to federal funds prior to any landfall. Texas Governor Rick Perry declared Dean to be an imminent threat to the state, and thus initiated a full-scale hurricane preparedness effort on August 17 when the storm was at least five days away. Prior to the storm, Texas suffered severe flooding from several June–July storms, and Tropical Storm Erin left the ground still saturated. Governor Perry feared that more rainfall from Dean would cause additional flash flooding, and had 250 Texas Parks and Wildlife Department crews on standby with boats to assist in potential evacuations. He was willing to deploy up to 10,000 Texas Military Forces soldiers, and did deploy several elements of the Texas State Guard who set up emergency shelters. The Texas fuel industry began surging fuel loads to coastal counties to ensure adequate fuel in the event of the hurricane causing <b>a</b> <b>disruption</b> to the fuel distribution system. In anticipation of evacuations, the Texas Department of Transportation began working on extra evacuation lanes and contraflow. NASA cut short the STS-118 mission as a precaution, in case Dean approached Mission Control at the Lyndon B. Johnson Space Center in Houston. To that effect, mission managers cut the mission's final spacewalk short by two hours, allowing them to land a day earlier than originally planned.|$|E
5|$|Treatment of TBI varies {{based on}} the {{location}} and severity of injury and whether the patient is stable or having trouble breathing, but ensuring that the airway is patent so that the patient can breathe is always of paramount importance. Ensuring an open airway and adequate ventilation may be difficult in people with TBI. Intubation, one method to secure the airway, {{may be used to}} bypass <b>a</b> <b>disruption</b> in the airway in order to send air to the lungs. If necessary, a tube can be placed into the uninjured bronchus, and a single lung can be ventilated. If there is a penetrating injury to the neck through which air is escaping, the trachea may be intubated through the wound. Multiple unsuccessful attempts at conventional (direct) laryngoscopy may threaten the airway, so alternative techniques to visualize the airway, such as fiberoptic or video laryngoscopy, may be employed to facilitate tracheal intubation. If the upper trachea is injured, an incision can be made in the trachea (tracheotomy) or the cricothyroid membrane (cricothyrotomy, or cricothyroidotomy) in order to ensure an open airway. However, cricothyrotomy may not be useful if the trachea is lacerated below the site of the artificial airway. Tracheotomy is used sparingly because it can cause complications such as infections and narrowing of the trachea and larynx. When it is impossible to establish a sufficient airway, or when complicated surgery must be performed, cardiopulmonary bypass may be used—blood is pumped out of the body, oxygenated by a machine, and pumped back in. If a pneumothorax occurs, a chest tube may be inserted into the pleural cavity to remove the air.|$|E

40|$|Four hundred forty-nine {{students}} from 26 different grade four classes, representing six different school boards on the Avalon Penninsula of Newfoundland {{were divided into}} two groups based on family structure. Children who have experienced <b>a</b> marital <b>disruption</b> in their family were compared to their same aged peers who have not experienced <b>a</b> marital <b>disruption.</b> Eighty-seven percent of the sample were from intact homes (i. e. homes in which a mother and a father were present), and seven percent of the sample were from disrupted homes (i. e. homes in which there had been a divorce or a separation). The remaining six percent came from alternative family structures example, adopted family, and so on. [...] Research studies have suggested that the process of divorce has predictable effects upon children and that these effects can be categorized depending upon the age of the child. Using the results of these studies, a behavioral checklist was developed. This checklist was used to assess whether Newfoundland children displayed effects of divorce similar to those identified in non-Newfoundland populations. Children were compared on seven variables namely: Anxiety, Social Adjustment, Personal Adjustment, Maturity Adjustment, Perceived Academic Potential, Acceptable Classroom Behavior, and Academic Performance. [...] A sample of grade four teachers filled out a behavioral checklist for every student in their classes. Results of the study suggested that Newfoundland children who have experienced <b>a</b> marital <b>disruption</b> are similar to other elementary school children who have similar experiences as defined in the literature. The results also showed that children who have experienced <b>a</b> marital <b>disruption</b> in their family were significantly different on four out of the seven variables measured when compared to their same aged peers who have not experienced <b>a</b> marital <b>disruption.</b> <b>A</b> recommendation supporting an intervention program for this particular group of children was made...|$|R
