5|$|The {{novel was}} {{influenced}} by Goethe's Elective Affinities, which Froude later translated and published anonymously. Froude borrowed much of his novel's ending from Goethe, and also used the scientific metaphor underlying Goethe's novel to illustrate the relation of <b>an</b> <b>individual</b> <b>to</b> the church.|$|E
5|$|Alcoholism is characterised by an {{increased}} tolerance to alcohol–which means {{that an individual}} can consume more alcohol–and physical dependence on alcohol, which {{makes it hard for}} <b>an</b> <b>individual</b> <b>to</b> control their consumption. The physical dependency caused by alcohol can lead to an affected individual having a very strong urge to drink alcohol. These characteristics play a role decreasing an alcoholic's ability to stop drinking. Alcoholism can have adverse effects on mental health, causing psychiatric disorders and increasing the risk of suicide. A depressed mood is a common symptom of heavy alcohol drinkers.|$|E
5|$|All {{citizens}} of Canada, {{as well as}} corporate bodies, may petition the Crown for an award of arms. For <b>an</b> <b>individual</b> <b>to</b> obtain a grant of arms, a petition must {{be sent to the}} Chief Herald, providing a biography, references, and completed application forms. If the grant is approved, the individual then consults with heralds from the Authority to work out the design of their award. Upon completion of this process, the grant documents, in the form of letters patent, are created and provided to the grantee. The entire process is subject to certain fees required by the Government of Canada to cover costs of research and artwork; the fees are not to purchase the grant of arms. For corporations and institutions the process is similar.|$|E

50|$|New EEG fatigue {{detection}} software measures <b>an</b> <b>individual's</b> ability <b>to</b> resist sleep. Micro-sleep only occurs when <b>an</b> <b>individual</b> fails <b>to</b> resist sleep, {{it does not}} occur when <b>an</b> <b>individual</b> chooses <b>to</b> rest. Operators of heavy mobile equipment are accustomed to resist sleep; it comes natural and is almost a subconscious behaviour. However, when <b>an</b> <b>individual's</b> ability <b>to</b> resist sleep diminishes, {{there is a risk}} of a micro-sleep. The ability to resist sleep is therefore the most relevant safety measure for equipment operators. The underlying measurement behind the technology is brain activity. Electroencephalogram has been the gold standard in sleep and fatigue science. Being a more direct physiological measure, it provides improved accuracy by avoiding erroneous measurements related to the external environment.|$|R

5|$|Sleep {{deprivation}} and cumulative fatigue effects describe how individuals {{who fail to}} have an adequate period of sleep (78hours in 24hours) or who have been awake longer than the conventional 1617hours will suffer sleep deprivation. A sleep deficit accumulates with successive sleep-deprived days, and additional fatigue {{may be caused by}} breaking daily sleep into two shorter periods in place of a single unbroken period of sleep. A sleep deficit is not instantly reduced by one night's sleep; it may take two or three conventional sleep cycles for <b>an</b> <b>individual</b> <b>to</b> return to unimpaired performance.|$|E
5|$|The authors {{discuss the}} broader concept of denial using social science theory, noting its {{occurrence}} appears in society when individuals are frightened or ashamed of their actions. They write that these motivations, when expanded from <b>an</b> <b>individual</b> <b>to</b> wider society, present {{themselves as a}} form of disease. The book identifies climate change denial itself as a pathology afflicting the culture of the planet. The authors lament that an inverse relationship exists between an increasing scientific consensus regarding climate change, and a simultaneous increase in denial within the greater public about the same issue.|$|E
5|$|The {{relationship}} between the Commonwealth realms is such that any change to the laws governing succession to the shared throne requires the unanimous consent of all the realms. Succession is governed by statutes such as the Bill of Rights 1689, the Act of Settlement 1701 and the Acts of Union 1707. The rules of succession may only be changed by an Act of Parliament; {{it is not possible}} for <b>an</b> <b>individual</b> <b>to</b> renounce his or her right of succession. The Act of Settlement restricts the succession to the legitimate Protestant descendants of Sophia of Hanover (1630–1714), a granddaughter of James I.|$|E

50|$|Of {{the countless}} models that examine the {{importance}} of hope in <b>an</b> <b>individual’s</b> life, {{there are two major}} theories that have gained a significant amount of recognition in the field of psychology. One of these theories, developed by Charles R. Snyder, argues that hope should be viewed as a cognitive skill that demonstrates <b>an</b> <b>individual’s</b> ability <b>to</b> maintain drive in the pursuit of a particular goal. This model reasons that <b>an</b> <b>individual’s</b> ability <b>to</b> be hopeful depends on two types of thinking: agency thinking and pathway thinking. Agency thinking refers <b>to</b> <b>an</b> <b>individual’s</b> determination <b>to</b> achieve their goals despite possible obstacles, while pathway thinking refers {{to the ways in which}} <b>an</b> <b>individual</b> believes they can achieve these personal goals.|$|R
5|$|The {{spotted hyena}} {{is a highly}} {{successful}} animal, being the most common large carnivore in Africa. Its success {{is due in part}} to its adaptability and opportunism; it is primarily a hunter but may also scavenge, with the capacity to eat and digest skin, bone and other animal waste. In functional terms, the spotted hyena makes the most efficient use of animal matter of all African carnivores. The spotted hyena displays greater plasticity in its hunting and foraging behaviour than other African carnivores; it hunts alone, in small parties of 2–5 individuals or in large groups. During a hunt, spotted hyenas often run through ungulate herds in order to select <b>an</b> <b>individual</b> <b>to</b> attack. Once selected, their prey is chased over a long distance, often several kilometres, at speeds of up to 60km/h.|$|E
5|$|A {{few days}} after the arrests the solicitors for one of the {{deported}} men, Art O'Brien, got in contact with Sir Patrick Hastings KC, a Member of Parliament for the Labour Party and a noted barrister. On 23 March 1923 Hastings represented O'Brien in front of a Divisional Court consisting of Mr Justice Avory and Mr Justice Salter to apply for a writ of habeas corpus for O'Brien as a test case to allow the release of the others. The initial hearing did not go anywhere because Hastings was unable to provide an affidavit from O'Brien (who was in Mountjoy Prison), which was required for a writ of habeas corpus to be considered, {{but by the time the}} hearing was resumed on 10 April he had managed to obtain one. Hastings argued that because the Irish Free State was an independent nation the British laws governing it, such as the 1920 act, were effectively repealed. In addition the Home Secretary had no power to order <b>an</b> <b>individual</b> <b>to</b> be detained overseas because he had no control over what happened to them there.|$|E
5|$|Brown {{opened his}} {{campaign}} with {{a speech at}} Bowling Green on August26, 1899. He answered many allegations {{that had been made}} about him, including claims that he had secretly been seeking the Democratic gubernatorial nomination all along, that he had ambitions of succeeding Senator William Joseph Deboe, and that following the nominating convention, he had agreed to speak on behalf of the Goebel ticket. Brown conceded that he desired Senator Deboe's senate seat and that he had agreed to accept the gubernatorial nomination if it had been offered to him, but he denied that he had ever agreed to speak on Goebel's behalf. Outgoing Senator Blackburn also charged that Brown was bolting the party again, just as he had in supporting Stephen Douglas over John C. Breckinridge for president in 1860. Brown replied by quoting an article by William Jennings Bryan's Omaha World-Herald that asserted the right of <b>an</b> <b>individual</b> <b>to</b> vote against the nominee of his party if the individual deemed the nominee unfit.|$|E

5|$|The custom {{was first}} {{recorded}} in 1800, with subsequent accounts {{of it being}} produced into the early twentieth century. According to these, the Mari Lwyd was a tradition performed at Christmas time by groups of men. They would form into teams to accompany the horse on its travels around the local area, and although the makeup of such groups varied, they typically included <b>an</b> <b>individual</b> <b>to</b> carry the horse, a leader, and individuals dressed as stock characters such as Punch and Judy. The team would carry the Mari Lwyd to local houses, where they would request entry {{through the medium of}} song. The householders would be expected to deny them entry, again through song, and the two sides would continue their responses to one another in this manner. If the householders eventually relented, then the team would be permitted entry and given food and drink.|$|E
5|$|The {{doctrine}} of legitimate expectation in Singapore protects both procedural and substantive rights. In administrative law, a legitimate expectation generally arises when {{there has been}} a representation of a certain outcome by the public authorities to <b>an</b> <b>individual.</b> <b>To</b> derogate from the representation may amount to an abuse of power or unfairness. The {{doctrine of}} legitimate expectation as a ground to quash decisions of public authorities has been firmly established by the English courts. Thus, where a public authority has made a representation to an individual who would be affected by a decision by the authority, the individual has a legitimate expectation to have his or her views heard before the decision is taken. Alternatively, an individual may also have a legitimate expectation to a substantive right. The recognition of substantive legitimate expectations is somewhat controversial as it requires a balancing of the requirements of fairness against the reasons for any change in the authority's policy. This suggests the adoption of a free-standing proportionality approach, which has been said not to apply in administrative law.|$|E
5|$|The procellariids {{lack the}} {{elaborate}} breeding dances of the albatrosses, {{in no small}} part due to the tendency of most of them to attend colonies at night and breed in burrows, where visual displays are useless. The fulmarine petrels, which nest on the surface and attend their colonies diurnally, do use a repertoire of stereotyped behaviours such as cackling, preening, head waving and nibbling, but for most species courtship interactions are limited to some billing (rubbing the two bills together) in the burrow and the vocalisations made by all species. The calls serve a number of functions: they are used territorially to protect burrows or territories and to call for mates. Each call type is unique to a particular species and indeed it is possible for procellariids to identify the sex of the bird calling as well. It may also be possible to assess the quality of potential mates; a study of blue petrels found a link between the rhythm and duration of calls and the body mass of the bird. The ability of <b>an</b> <b>individual</b> <b>to</b> recognise its mate has also been demonstrated in several species.|$|E

5|$|While using Dante's terza rima style, {{the poem}} {{continues}} by describing the Battle of Britain. The image of warfare merges with {{the depiction of}} Pentecost, and the Holy Spirit is juxtaposed with the air-raids on London. In the second section, a ghost, representing the poets of the past stuck between worlds, begins talking to the narrator of the poem. The ghost discusses change, art in general, and how humankind is flawed. The only way to overcome the problematic condition of humanity, according to the ghost, is to experience purgation through fire. The fire is described {{in a manner similar}} to Julian of Norwich's writing about God's love and discussed in relationship to the shirt of Nessus, a shirt that burns its wearer. Little Gidding continues by describing the eternalness of the present and how history exists in a pattern. The poem concludes by explaining how sacrifice is needed to allow <b>an</b> <b>individual</b> <b>to</b> die into life and be reborn, and that salvation should be the goal of humankind.|$|E
5|$|Durkheim {{believed}} {{there was more to}} suicide than extremely personal individual life circumstances: for example, a loss of a job, divorce, or bankruptcy. Instead, he took suicide and explained it as a social fact instead of a result of one’s circumstances. Durkheim believed that suicide was an instance of social deviance. Social deviance being any transgression of socially established norms. He created a normative theory of suicide focusing on the conditions of group life. The four different types of suicide that he proposed are egoistic, altruistic, anomic, and fatalistic. He began by plotting social regulation on the x-axis of his chart, and social integration on the y-axis. Egoistic suicide corresponds to a low level of social integration. When one is not well integrated into a social group it can lead to a feeling that he or she has not made a difference in anyone’s lives. On the other hand, too much social integration would be altruistic suicide. This occurs when a group dominates the life of <b>an</b> <b>individual</b> <b>to</b> a degree where they feel meaningless to society. Anomic suicide occurs when one has an insufficient amount of social regulation. This stems from the sociological term anomie meaning a sense of aimlessness or despair that arises from the inability to reasonably expect life to be predictable. Lastly, there is fatalistic suicide, which results from too much social regulation. An example of this would be when one follows the same routine day after day. This leads to he or she believing there is nothing good to look forward to. Durkheim suggested this was the most popular form of suicide for prisoners.|$|E

5|$|Nietzsche {{rejected}} fundamental {{components of}} Kant's ethics, particularly his argument that morality, God, and immorality, {{can be shown}} through reason. Nietzsche cast suspicion {{on the use of}} moral intuition, which Kant used as the foundation of his morality, arguing that it has no normative force in ethics. He further attempted to undermine key concepts in Kant's moral psychology, such as the will and pure reason. Like Kant, Nietzsche developed a concept of autonomy; however, he rejected Kant's idea that valuing our own autonomy requires us to respect the autonomy of others. A naturalist reading of Nietzsche's moral psychology stands contrary to Kant's conception of reason and desire. Under the Kantian model, reason is a fundamentally different motive to desire because it has the capacity to stand back from a situation and make an independent decision. Nietzsche conceives of the self as a social structure of all our different drives and motivations; thus, when it seems that our intellect has made a decision against our drives, it is actually just an alternative drive taking dominance over another. This is in direct contrast with Kant's view of the intellect as opposed to instinct; instead, it is just another instinct. There is thus no self-capable of standing back and making a decision; the decision the self-makes is simply determined by the strongest drive. Kantian commentators have argued that Nietzsche's practical philosophy requires the existence of a self-capable of standing back in the Kantian sense. For <b>an</b> <b>individual</b> <b>to</b> create values of their own, which is a key idea in Nietzsche's philosophy, they must be able to conceive of themselves as a unified agent. Even if the agent is influenced by their drives, he must regard them as his own, which undermines Nietzsche's conception of autonomy.|$|E
