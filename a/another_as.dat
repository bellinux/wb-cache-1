Inheritance is thus particulate (definitely one trait or <b>another),</b> <b>as</b> in Mendelian genetics, unlike the Hippocratic model which was continuous and blending.|$|E

5|$|Although {{the crisis}} of the 3rd century was not the {{absolute}} beginning of Rome's decline, it nevertheless did impose a severe strain on the empire as Romans waged war on one <b>another</b> <b>as</b> they had not done since {{the last days of the}} Republic. Within the space of a single century, twenty-seven military officers declared themselves emperors and reigned over parts of the empire for months or days, all but two meeting with a violent end. The time was characterized by a Roman army that was as likely to be attacking itself as it was an outside invader, reaching a low point around 258 AD. Ironically, while it was these usurpations that led to the breakup of the Empire during the crisis, it was the strength of several frontier generals that helped reunify the empire through force of arms.|$|E
5|$|Among second basemen, Ryne Sandberg, {{who played}} 15 {{seasons with the}} Chicago Cubs in his 16-year career, owns the most Silver Sluggers with seven wins, {{including}} five consecutive from 1988 to 1992.

Jeff Kent (2000–2002, 2005) won three consecutive awards with the San Francisco Giants before adding a fourth with the Los Angeles Dodgers; Craig Biggio, who played his entire career with the Houston Astros, won the award four times as a second baseman (1994–1995, 1997–1998) after winning <b>another</b> <b>as</b> a catcher. Chase Utley followed Kent's last win by capturing four consecutive awards (20062009). Three American League players are also four-time winners at second base. Roberto Alomar won the award at the same position with three different teams (Baltimore Orioles, Toronto Blue Jays, Cleveland Indians). Julio Franco won four consecutive awards (1988–1991) with two different teams, and Lou Whitaker won four awards in five years (1983–1985, 1987) with the Detroit Tigers. José Altuve and Dee Gordon are the most recent winners.|$|E
5|$|Aristotle's pupil and {{successor}} at the Lyceum, Theophrastus, {{wrote the}} History of Plants, the first classical book of botany. It has an Aristotelian structure, {{but rather than}} focus on formal causes, as Aristotle did, Theophrastus suggested a mechanistic scheme, comparing natural and artificial processes. Where Aristotle expanded on grand theories, Theophrastus was quietly empirical. Where Aristotle insisted that species have a fixed place on the scala naturae, Theophrastus suggests that one kind of plant can transform into <b>another,</b> <b>as</b> when a field sown to wheat turns to the weed darnel.|$|E

Nevertheless, Aslam, who still feels indebted and bound to Khan, does not fight back until Inspector Awant appears through the gathered crowd - even then, Aslam only pushes Khan away so that Khan is not shot by the officer. Reacting quickly, Khan draws a pistol of his own and shoots Awant before turning his weapon on Jasmine and Aslam. Jasmine, through tears and while holding a bleeding Aslam, tells Khan that he is truly evil and will never have her love. Khan seems to recognize the truth in her words as he drops his weapon and stares at the couple. Just then, more police officers arrive on the scene and open fire on Khan, who, now injured, is dragged away by one of his henchmen. He and Aslam, both alive but bloodied, lock eyes and reach out for another, having finally put aside their differences.|$|E
5|$|Contemporary annals {{began to}} be kept in Wessex during the 7th century. The {{material}} compiled in Alfred's reign included annals relating to Kentish, South Saxon, Mercian and, particularly, West Saxon history, but, {{with the exception of the}} Cynewulf entry, does not gather momentum until it comes to the Nordic invasions of the late 8th century onwards. The Chronicle grew out of the tradition of the Easter Tables, drawn up to help the clergy determine the dates of feasts in future years: a page consisted of a sequence of horizontal lines followed by astronomical data, with a space for short notes of events to distinguish one year from <b>another.</b> <b>As</b> the Chronicle developed, it lost its list-like appearance, and such notes took up more space, becoming more like historical records.

Rachel visits Will's apartment, where his wife Terri (Jessalyn Gilsig) puts her to work cooking and cleaning. After an encounter with Suzy Pepper, during which Suzy explains {{that the two of them}} are similar and that chasing after Will won't repair Rachel's self-esteem, Rachel realizes her feelings for Will reflect her concerns about her own self-worth, and apologizes for her behavior. Afterward, Will assures her that she will find the man of her dreams who loves her for who she is.|$|E
