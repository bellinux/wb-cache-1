Annie tells Dixon of her invitation to Naomi's party, and how she saw Ethan cheating on Naomi. The next day at school, Annie finds out that Silver made a video blog about her, depicting her as a bitchy farmer. Annie confronts Silver, who felt insulted by Annie's decision {{to hang out with}} Naomi. When Silver is reprimanded by her half-sister, Kelly, she realizes that she shouldn't reprimand Annie for what happened between her and Naomi in the past.

He is mad that Naomi told Jen about his past: he wanted to keep it a secret. However, he was not aware that Jen was Naomi's sister, and upon finding out is horrified. Naomi finds out about it but thinks that Annie was with Liam, not Jen. This culminates in a major fight between Annie and Naomi where <b>Annie</b> <b>is</b> shunned by her peers, runs away, gets in her car drunk and accidentally runs over a man. This is a suspenseful way to end the season and definitely brings plot twist seeing that <b>Annie</b> <b>is</b> not sure whether or not this man survived.|$|E

Annie begins to worry about Marla's well being after she starts {{to show signs of}} dementia and finds pamphlets on assisted suicide.

Months later, he and Babe are closer again, and are more about raising their son together while not being romantically intertwined with each other. But during a snowday with Babe and Little Adam, JR suggests to Babe that she keep the idea of them as lovers open for consideration. Having enjoyed her recent time with JR, Babe accepts his request. Still perplexed by Richie, she talks with him at times, her concern more directed at {{the fact that he has}} leukemia and needs a bone marrow transplant to survive. His sister, <b>Annie,</b> <b>is</b> thought to be the best candidate to be his donor, and Babe is determined to convince her to save him. But her efforts are revealed hopeless when test results show that <b>Annie</b> <b>is</b> not a good donor match for Richie after all. The revelation comes that someone else in Pine Valley is the perfect bone marrow match for Richie. With the help of her mother, Babe discovers that JR is the match. Feeling that he will not donate the bone marrow on his own due to his hate for Richie, she decides to entice JR during a runway where she wears a sexy red dress.

50|$|<b>Annie</b> <b>was</b> used as {{the annual}} Holiday show until 2006, though it would {{periodically}} return in later years. Daddy Warbucks, the lead male character of <b>Annie,</b> <b>was</b> played by Jay Meisenhelder for several incarnations until he was not taken back {{as a result of}} controversy stemming from the show itself. <b>Annie</b> <b>was</b> the first show at The Artists' Studio to have 2 casts, a Cast A and B, though it was only for the children involved in the show. This became common practice for all the later productions of Annie and set the precedent for future shows requiring a children's cast.|$|R

25|$|The strip {{developed}} {{a series of}} formulas that ran over its course to facilitate {{a wide range of}} stories. The earlier strips relied on a formula by which Daddy Warbucks is called away on business and through a variety of contrivances, <b>Annie</b> <b>is</b> cast out of the Warbucks mansion, usually by her enemy, the nasty Mrs. Warbucks. Annie then wanders the countryside and has adventures meeting and helping new people in their daily struggles. Early stories dealt with political corruption, criminal gangs and corrupt institutions, which Annie would confront. Annie ultimately would encounter troubles with the villain, who would be vanquished by the returning Daddy Warbucks. Annie and Daddy would then be reunited, at which point, after several weeks, the formula would play out again. In the series, each strip represented a single {{day in the life of}} the characters. This device was dropped by the end of the '20s.|$|E

[...] "Everybody that I know is at least 10 or 20 years younger than I am. My wife <b>Annie</b> <b>is</b> 24 years younger than I am.

500|$|Annie Fanny is the feature's lead character. Like {{other young}} women in Playboy pictorials, <b>Annie</b> <b>is</b> beautiful, buxom, and often unclothed. She is sexually innocent, {{oblivious}} to the worldliness around her. Like her forebear Goodman Beaver, Annie was conceived as a modern Candide, above the story's corruptions and temptations. Unlike Goodman, however, <b>Annie</b> <b>is</b> never shocked or offended; she remains blithe. The authors of Icons of the American Comic Book say Annie [...] "glides through a changing world with an untiring optimism" [...] with a [...] "good-natured lack of desire". She is insulated from the carnal nature of those around her, who explain the new rules of society to her each episode. Ruthie, Annie's mother hen roommate, appears in the first episode and remains in the strip throughout its run. Wanda Homefree, Annie Fanny's wild and shapely best friend, first appears in an episode-10 beauty contest as Miss Greenwich Village and is often seen at Annie's side throughout {{the remainder of the}} series. Ralphie Towzer, Annie's nerdy-but-hip do-gooder boyfriend, has the look of Goodman Beaver (with playwright Arthur Miller's eyeglasses and pipe) and the temperament of a straight-laced, chastising prude. Solly Brass, Annie's huckster agent, is based on actor Phil Silvers.|$|E
500|$|Meanwhile, Annie convinces Laurie to babysit Lindsey Wallace (Jenny Gregg Stewart), a girl <b>Annie</b> <b>is</b> {{supposed}} to be watching, {{so that she can}} meet with her boyfriend Paul (Max Van Ville). Annie and Paul return to the Wallace home and have sex; Michael kills Paul and attacks Annie. Bringing Lindsey home, Laurie finds Annie on the floor, badly hurt but still alive, and calls the police. Michael attacks Laurie and chases her back to the Doyle home. Loomis and Brackett hear the 911 call over the radio and head toward the Wallace residence.|$|E

500|$|Krusty starts {{performing}} his clown tricks at {{a theater}} {{in front of}} adults, and not children like before. This is because Annie knows {{that there is nothing}} adults enjoy more than the things they liked as children. The performances are praised by both the audience and the critics, and Krusty and Annie initiate a relationship again. Soon, a premium cable television network called HBOWTIME (an obvious portmanteau of HBO and Showtime, straight down to their parody of HBO's longtime slogan, [...] "It's not just TV, it's more expensive.") gives Krusty his own show and <b>Annie</b> <b>is</b> hired as the producer on his demand. The stars of the series Entourage, such as Kevin Dillon, become Krusty's assistants. The network executives soon become frustrated with Annie for meddling too much in the show. For example, she refuses to let Janeane Garofalo appear only because Garofalo is funnier than Krusty. She also runs over an intern with a stage car for sharpening her pencil too much. The executives decide to fire Annie, but Krusty refuses to continue without her. The couple therefore turns to another network where they start a show called Sex Over Sixty, with them as the stars.|$|E
500|$|Sociologists Virginia Rutter and Pepper Schwartz {{consider}} Alvy and Annie's {{relationship to}} be a stereotype {{of gender differences}} in sexuality. The nature of love is a repeating subject for Allen and co-star Tony Roberts described this film as [...] "the story of everybody who falls in love, and then falls out of love and goes on." [...] Alvy searches for love's purpose through his effort to get over his depression about the demise {{of his relationship with}} Annie. Sometimes he sifts through his memories of the relationship, at another point he stops people on the sidewalk, with one woman saying that [...] "It's never something you do. That's how people are. Love fades," [...] a suggestion that it was no one's fault, they just grew apart and the end was inevitable. By the end of the film, Alvy accepts this and decides that love is ultimately [...] "irrational and crazy and absurd", but a necessity of life. Christopher Knight points out that Annie Hall is framed through Alvy's experiences. [...] "Generally, what we know about Annie and about the relationship comes filtered through Alvy, an intrusive narrator capable of halting the narrative and stepping out from it in order to entreat the audience's interpretative favor." [...] He suggests that because Allen's films blur the protagonist with [...] "past and future protagonists {{as well as with the}} director himself", it [...] "makes a difference as to whether we are most responsive to the director's or the character's framing of events". Knight believes Alvy's quest upon meeting <b>Annie</b> <b>is</b> carnal, whereas hers is on an emotional note. Despite the narrative's framing, [...] "the joke is on Alvy." ...|$|E
2500|$|<b>Annie</b> <b>is</b> a 10-year-old orphan. Her {{distinguishing}} {{physical characteristics}} are a mop of red, curly hair, a red dress and vacant circles for eyes. Her catchphrases are [...] "Gee whiskers" [...] and [...] "Leapin' lizards!" [...] Annie attributes her lasting youthfulness to her birthday on February 29 in a leap year, and ages {{only one year}} in appearance for every four years that pass. <b>Annie</b> <b>is</b> a plucky, generous, compassionate, and optimistic youngster who can hold her own against bullies, and has a strong and intuitive {{sense of right and}} wrong.|$|E

2500|$|It's hard to play ditzy. ... The {{genius of}} <b>Annie</b> <b>is</b> that despite her loopy backhand, awful driving, and nervous tics, she's also a complicated, {{intelligent}} woman.

Yo-yo? Hardly.|$|E
