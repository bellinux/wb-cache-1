5|$|<b>Adams</b> <b>is</b> home to {{a fairly}} wide variety of animal species. Several hoofed mammals call the {{mountain}} home: mountain goats, Roosevelt elk, black-tailed deer, and mule deer. Large carnivores include cougar, black bear, coyote, bobcat, and the Cascade mountain fox, an endemic subspecies of the red fox. There have also been sightings of wolverine and unconfirmed reports of wolves. Many small mammals also make Adams their home. Squirrels and chipmunks are numerous throughout the forest. Douglas squirrels, least chipmunks, and Townsend's chipmunks live throughout the forest with golden-mantled ground squirrels and California ground squirrels occupying drier areas as well. These squirrels are preyed upon by the elusive and secretive pine martens that also call Adams their home. Hoary marmots and pikas make their home on open rocky areas at any altitude while the elusive snowshoe hare lives throughout the forest.|$|E
5|$|<b>Adams</b> <b>is</b> home to {{the oldest}} {{building}} on the Gifford Pinchot National Forest, the Gotchen Creek Guard Station {{just south of the}} A. G. Aiken Lava Bed. Built in 1909, it served as the administrative headquarters of the Mount Adams District until 1916. It was built along a major grazing trail to allow for easy monitoring of the thousands of sheep grazed on the lower slopes. Later, in the 1940s, as the amount of grazing decreased, the station housed the Forest Guards responsible for the area. In 2008, it was wrapped in protective foil as a precautionary method to shield it from a large wildfire, the Cold Springs Fire, although the fire did not come near enough to burn it. Wildfires in 2012 (Cascade Creek Fire) and 2015 (Cougar Creek Fire) also required this precaution, and neither of them came close enough either.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Adam</b> <b>was</b> naturalised as a British citizen, and {{was awarded}} the OBE for {{services}} to the film industry. In 2003, <b>Adam</b> <b>was</b> knighted for services to the film industry and Anglo-German relations.|$|R
5000|$|The Adams family famously [...] "lived plainly."

50|$|When his regiment's brigade commander, Brigadier General Adley H. Gladden {{was killed}} {{on the first day}} of the Battle of Shiloh, Adams assumed command of the brigade. Soon thereafter, <b>Adams</b> <b>was</b> wounded in further {{fighting}} at the Hornet's Nest and lost his right eye. <b>Adams</b> <b>was</b> so severely wounded that the driver of the wagon in which he was being transported with other wounded soldiers left the senseless and muddy general for dead along the muddy road to lighten the wagon's load. <b>Adams</b> <b>was</b> saved when passing soldiers of the 10th Mississippi Infantry Regiment noticed that <b>Adams</b> <b>was</b> alive.|$|R
5|$|Born in Vicenza, Italy, {{and raised}} in Castle Rock, Colorado, <b>Adams</b> <b>is</b> the fourth of seven siblings. She trained to be a ballerina, but at age 18 found musical theater {{to be a better}} fit, and from 1994 to 1998, she worked in dinner theater. Adams made her feature film debut with a {{supporting}} part in the 1999 satire Drop Dead Gorgeous. After relocating to Los Angeles, she made several guest appearances in television, and took on mean girl parts in small-scale features. Her first major role came in Steven Spielberg's 2002 biopic Catch Me If You Can, opposite Leonardo DiCaprio, but she was unemployed for a year after. Her breakthrough came in the part of a loquacious pregnant woman in the 2005 independent film Junebug.|$|E
5|$|Brian Keith Adams (April 14, 1964 – August 13, 2007) was an American {{professional}} wrestler. <b>Adams</b> <b>is</b> {{well known}} for his time with the World Wrestling Federation (WWF), under the name Crush, and for World Championship Wrestling (WCW) under his real name Brian Adams. Trained in Japan by Antonio Inoki, he was a two-time WCW World Tag Team Champion and a one-time WWF Tag Team Champion and a one-time AJPW World Tag Team Champion, among other titles and accomplishments. In 2002, he briefly tried a career in boxing until {{he was forced to}} retire due to back and shoulder injuries. He died of accidental respiratory failure from a combination of buprenorphine, carisoprodol, chlordiazepoxide and alprazolam.|$|E
5|$|In many of {{the legends}} of the Cascade Mountains, there are thunderbirds that live on them and <b>Adams</b> <b>is</b> no exception. This {{particular}} thunderbird was named Enumtla and he terrorized {{the inhabitants of the}} land. Speelyi, the Klickitat coyote god, came along one day and they implored him to do something. Speelyi transformed himself into a feather and waited. It did not take long for Enumtla to see the feather and investigate. Being suspicious, he thundered at the feather with no effect. He paused and suddenly the magic feather let loose a terrific volley of thunder and lightning and stunned Enumtla. Speelyi then managed to overpower Enumtla and decreed that the thunderbird could no longer terrify the people, could only thunder on hot days, and could not destroy with lightning.|$|E
50|$|A famous case {{involving}} proxy murder {{was that of}} John Bodkin Adams. John Bodkin <b>Adams</b> <b>was</b> an Irish physician who was investigated from 1946-1952 when 152 of his patients died mysteriously. Out of the 152, 130 of them mentioned Adams in their will, leaving him various amounts of money and items. <b>Adams</b> <b>was</b> accused of having his assisting nurses give lethal doses of opiates. <b>Adams</b> <b>was</b> arrested and tried for several counts of murder. He admitted to helping his nurses deliver morphine to patients, {{but he said it}} was to ease their passing, not to kill them. <b>Adams</b> <b>was</b> acquitted for several of the murders, and many others were withdrawn because the cases were not strong enough to hold up in court. In the end, <b>Adams</b> <b>was</b> convicted of fraud for lying on cremation papers.|$|R
50|$|In 1938 <b>Adams</b> <b>was</b> {{summoned to}} Moscow, having been falsely denounced. Luckily enough, the falsified case against <b>Adams</b> <b>was</b> closed and in 1939 he {{moved back to}} the U.S., {{creating}} his intelligence network anew.|$|R
50|$|On June 5, 2012, <b>Adams</b> <b>was</b> {{signed by}} the Indianapolis Colts. On October 6, 2012, <b>Adams</b> <b>was</b> waived by the Colts. On October 8, 2012, he was re-signed and placed on the {{practice}} squad.|$|R
5|$|Since then, thermal {{anomalies}} (hot spots) and {{gas emissions}} (including hydrogen sulfide) have occurred {{especially on the}} summit plateau and indicate that <b>Adams</b> <b>is</b> dormant, not extinct. Future eruptions from Adams will probably follow patterns set by previous events and will thus be flank lava flows of andesite or basalt. Because the primary products were andesite, the eruptions that occur on Adams {{tend to have a}} low to moderate explosiveness and present less of a hazard than the violent eruptions of St. Helens {{and some of the other}} Cascade volcanoes. However, since the interior of the main cone is little more than a pile of fragmented lava and hydrothermally-altered rock, there is a potential for very large landslides and other debris flows.|$|E
5|$|The {{climate of}} Adams places {{it and the}} {{immediate}} area in two different level three eco-regions: the Cascades eco-region and the Eastern Cascades Slopes and Foothills eco-region. Within these two eco-regions are five level four eco-regions: the Western Cascade Mountain Highlands, Cascade Crest Montane Forest, and Cascades Subalpine/Alpine within the Cascades eco-region and the Yakima Plateau and Slopes and Grand Fir Mixed Forest within the Eastern Cascades Slopes and Foothills eco-region. <b>Adams</b> <b>is</b> unique among the Washington volcanoes {{in that it is}} in two level three eco-regions as well as being the only one within the Cascade Crest Montane Forest.|$|E
5|$|The large {{diversity}} of the flora around <b>Adams</b> <b>is</b> even more apparent in the herbage and, including the tree and shrub species previously mentioned, totals at least 843 species. This is {{more than any other}} mountain in the Pacific Northwest. The first extensive list of flora from the area around Mount Adams was published in 1896 by William Suksdorf and Thomas Howell and listed 480 species. Suksdorf had taken it upon himself to catalogue as many species around Adams as he could and the list was the result of his extraordinary collection efforts. This was the most complete list for over a century and has finally been updated by David Beik and Susan McDougall to the current 843 species with hundreds of additional species listed. <b>Adams</b> <b>is</b> home to many rare plants including tall bugbane, Suksdorf’s monkeyflower, northern microseris (Microceris borealis), Brewer’s potentilla (Potentilla breweri), and mountain blue-eyed grass. The plant diversity is most evident in the many meadows and wetlands on the flanks of Adams. The notable Bird Creek Meadows includes in its famous display, magenta paintbrush, arrowleaf ragwort, penstemons, lupines, monkeyflowers, mountain heathers, and many others. In wetlands, generally at lower elevations, one can find bog blueberry, highbush cranberry, sundew, purple cinquefoil, and flatleaf bladderwort, in addition to many sedges and rushes. Subalpine and alpine meadows and parklands, while not as prolific as the meadows and wetlands of lower elevations, have a beautiful display as well with partrigefoot, Cascade rockcress, subalpine buttercup, Sitka valerian, alpine false candytuft, elegant Jacob’s ladder, and various buckwheats as prominent players.|$|E

50|$|Adam {{took part}} in the Revolt of 1173-74 on the side of King Henry's sons. <b>Adam</b> <b>was</b> {{involved}} with the invasion of northern England by King William the Lion, the King of Scots. In July 1174 <b>Adam</b> <b>was</b> part of the force led by King William that was defeated. Although King William <b>was</b> captured, <b>Adam</b> <b>was</b> not captured and escaped. Nothing is known of him after his escape.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Adams</b> <b>was</b> born on 7 November 1874 in Worcester, Massachusetts. He married Frances Pendleton Sheldon (1903-1920). John Wolcott <b>Adams</b> <b>was</b> {{the son of}} John Francis and Ellen Wilson Adams and {{descendant}} of a New England family. This family had produced two United States presidents. <b>Adams</b> <b>was</b> interested in the theatre, {{and he was able}} to design at least one stage setting that was designed for a 1923 Walter Hampden production.|$|R
