40|$|This study {{focuses on}} {{questions}} of knowledge and belief {{in terms of public}} assumptions <b>about</b> <b>President</b> <b>Clinton.</b> Data from a national survey reveal the widespread assumption that Clinton is more liberal than his record would indicate. The data suggest that while people may not structure their own beliefs along conventional ideological lines, many interpret contemporary politics in terms of broad ideological frameworks, even if those frameworks lead to misleading conclusions. Thus while Clinton 2 ̆ 7 s liberal side is well‐known (or correctly assumed), his conservative side is not: indeed, most respondents associate him with liberal indicators in nearly every area. This point is explored {{in the context of the}} relation between traditional indicators of political knowledge and ideological assumptions. The authors conclude by speculating how the notion of a uniformly “liberal” Clinton may have its origins in media coverage...|$|E

Cool J song, [...] "That's A Lie", Quirk explained at some length that the band {{was well aware of}} the presence of agents with coily cords in their ears and that the Secret Service was [...] "not famous for their sense of humor". So it was explained further that the song was called [...] "That's A Lie" [...] and that the band is known to tell a lie {{at this point in the}} song at which point [...] "my friends will jump in and sing 'that's a lie'... so If I were to, for example, say that I voted for <b>President</b> <b>Clinton</b> but when I see him eviscerating the Bill of Rights it makes me want to strangle him, you'll understand that I don't mean it because..." [...] and then the band came in singing [...] "that's a lie". This would have been the end of the story but apparently the Secret Service felt obligated to take it as a serious [...] "threat". Two hours later, at the end of the show, they detained the band and questioned Quirk until they were satisfied that the band was not in fact on a mission to assassinate Clinton.
