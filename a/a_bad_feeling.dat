[...] With nineteen votes he was within striking distance of the Papacy. [...] Medici then pledged three of his votes to della Valle, on the condition (Medici later said) that he get eighteen votes at the scrutiny, not counting any additional votes at the accessio. [...] Medici, however, did not deliver the promised votes. [...] This produced <b>a</b> <b>bad</b> <b>feeling</b> all around, and the 'Elders' swore that they would never vote for a member of Medici's faction.

2500|$|The novel {{opens on}} an {{overcast}} October 23. Two friends- William [...] "Will" [...] Holloway and Jim Nightshade- {{both on the}} verge of their fourteenth birthdays, encounter a strange lightning rod salesman, Tom Fury. He announces that a storm is coming their way. Jim buys a lighting rod. Throughout the night, Will and Jim meet up with townsfolk who also sense something in the air- the barber says that it smells of cotton candy and licorice. Among the townspeople is Will's 54 year-old father, Charles Holloway who works in the local library, and who broods philosophically about life and the past. Both Mr. Holloway and the boys learn about the carnival that is to start the next day. Will's father sees a sign in a store window that advertises Cooger & Dark's Pandemonium Shadow Show, while Jim and Will find a similar handbill in the street. They are excited that a carnival has come so late in the year, but Charles Holloway has <b>a</b> <b>bad</b> <b>feeling</b> about it.|$|E

2500|$|Several critics {{compared}} The Clone Wars to a Saturday morning cartoon {{and described}} it {{as little more than}} a plug for the upcoming animated series. Linda Barnard, of the Toronto Star, said the movie [...] "pretty much drives a stake into the heart of every loyal fan of the movies. And now [...] out to stick it to those too young to know about Jar Jar Binks." [...] Variety magazine reviewer Todd McCarthy said, [...] "This isn't the Star Wars we've always known and at least sometimes loved." [...] Joe Neumiar, of the New York Daily News, wrote, [...] "If this were a true Star Wars film, right about now somebody would say, '...I've got <b>a</b> <b>bad</b> <b>feeling</b> about this.'" [...] In his review for Entertainment Weekly, critic Owen Gleiberman gave the film an F grade and wrote, [...] "George Lucas is turning into the enemy of fun." [...] Carrie Rickey, of The Philadelphia Inquirer, said, [...] "The best that can be said about the movie is that it's harmless and mostly charmless. The Clone Wars is to Star Wars what karaoke is to pop music." ...|$|E

The Mail on Sunday conducted a two-week investigation into the claims made in Michelle Remembers and found that other than Pazder and Smith, the people they interviewed described the events in Michelle Remembers as [...] "the hysterical ravings of an uncontrolled imagination". In an interview with Jack Proby, Proby cited (as an example) [...] "three specific points where … Michelle lied" [...] in Michelle Remembers. Proby indicated that although {{he decided not to}} sue, he did file a Notice of Intent to sue against the book's publisher should they go beyond the literary contract; thereby preventing the book from being made into a movie. The Mail on Sunday also interviewed the Smith’s childhood family doctor: [...] "I believe it was … an over-active imagination"; former neighbors of the Probys: [...] "I dismissed the book as crazy. The mother was a nice, gracious lady. A little girl could not have been tortured without someone hearing"; a former childhood friend of Smith: [...] "Virginia was like a second mother to me. I certainly never had <b>a</b> <b>bad</b> <b>feeling</b> about her"; and her ex-husband: [...] "Not once during their marriage or the birth of their daughter did Michelle ever mention her experience".|$|E
6000|$|When {{the captain}} came on deck, {{before the hour}} at which the men usually started for the woods, I begged of him to permit me to remain aboard that day, as I did not feel well; but {{he looked at me}} angrily, and ordered me, in a surly tone, to get ready to go on shore as usual. The fact was that the captain had been out of humour for some time past. Romata and he had had some differences, and high words had passed between them, during which the chief had {{threatened}} to send a fleet of his war-canoes, with a thousand men, to break up and burn the schooner; whereupon the captain smiled sarcastically, and going up to the chief, gazed sternly in his face while he said, [...] "I have only to raise my little finger just now, and my big gun will blow your whole village to atoms in five minutes!" [...] Although the chief was a bold man, he quailed before the pirate's glance and threat, and made no reply; but <b>a</b> <b>bad</b> <b>feeling</b> had been raised, and old sores had been opened.|$|E

Gell-Mann often expressed frustration at the attention Feynman received; he remarked: [...] " [...] was a great scientist, but he {{spent a great deal of}} his effort generating anecdotes about himself." [...] He noted that Feynman's eccentricities included a refusal to brush his teeth, which he advised others not to do on national television, despite dentists showing him scientific studies that supported the practice.|$|R

5000|$|Final Destination {{was written}} by Jeffrey Reddick after having [...] "read {{a story about a}} woman who was on {{vacation}} and her mom called her and said, 'Don’t take the flight tomorrow, I have <b>a</b> really <b>bad</b> <b>feeling</b> about it.’". The woman switched flights and the plane she was originally supposed to take crashed. Originally having written the script as an episode of The X Files, Reddick decided to turn the script into a feature length film at the behest of one of his New Line Cinema colleagues. After reading his spec script, New Line Cinema hired Reddick to write the screenplay; James Wong and Glen Morgan were later brought on board to help with the script, making alterations to comply with their standards.|$|R
6000|$|However, these {{faithful}} priests {{worked hard}} {{in teaching and}} converting the Indians all over South America. One brotherhood, called the Jesuits, had great establishments, where they trained up large villages of Indiana in Christian habits, and taught them to be very faithful and industrious. But at home, in Europe, these Jesuits did harm by stepping out of their work as ministers, interfering with governments more than was right, {{and trying to keep}} up the authority of the Pope more than real Catholic truth. They taught so many false stories as articles of faith, that at last clever people, wise in their own conceit, began to believe nothing, and became like the fool who said in his heart, [...] "There is no God." [...] So there came to be <b>a</b> <b>bad</b> <b>feeling</b> against all the clergy, and the Jesuits, who had made themselves very meddling and troublesome, were put down at the entreaty of several kings. When they were taken away from their converts in South America, {{it turned out that the}} poor Indians had not steadfastness enough to take care of themselves; so all their well-ordered establishments were broken up, and the people ran wild again. All the Spanish settlers, of whom there were many, still held fast to their Church, and all the coast of the Continent of South America is Roman Catholic.|$|E
60|$|We {{must now}} {{go back a}} little in our story,--about three weeks,--in order that the reader may be told how affairs were {{progressing}} at the Beargarden. That establishment had received a terrible blow in the defection of Herr Vossner. It was not only that he had robbed the club, and robbed {{every member of the}} club who had ventured to have personal dealings with him. Although <b>a</b> <b>bad</b> <b>feeling</b> in regard to him was no doubt engendered in the minds of those who had suffered deeply, it was not that alone which cast an almost funereal gloom over the club. The sorrow was in this,--that with Herr Vossner all their comforts had gone. Of course Herr Vossner had been a thief. That no doubt had been known to them from the beginning. A man does not consent to be called out of bed at all hours in the morning to arrange the gambling accounts of young gentlemen without being a thief. No one concerned with Herr Vossner had supposed him to be an honest man. But then as a thief he had been so comfortable that his absence was regretted with a tenderness almost amounting to love even by those who had suffered most severely from his rapacity. Dolly Longestaffe had been robbed more outrageously than any other member of the club, and yet Dolly Longestaffe had said since the departure of the purveyor that London was not worth living in now that Herr Vossner was gone. In a week the Beargarden collapsed,--as Germany would collapse for a period if Herr Vossner's great compatriot were suddenly to remove himself from the scene; but as Germany would strive to live even without Bismarck, so did the club make its new efforts. But here the parallel must cease. Germany no doubt would at last succeed, but the Beargarden had received a blow from which it seemed that there was no recovery. At first it was proposed that three men should be appointed as trustees,-- trustees for paying Vossner's debts, trustees for borrowing more money, trustees for the satisfaction of the landlord who was beginning to be anxious as to his future rent. At a certain very triumphant general meeting of the club it was determined that such a plan should be arranged, and the members assembled were unanimous. It was at first thought {{that there might be a}} little jealousy as to the trusteeship. The club was so popular and the authority conveyed by the position would be so great, that A, B, and C might feel aggrieved at seeing so much power conferred on D, E, and F. When at the meeting above mentioned one or two names were suggested, the final choice was postponed, as a matter of detail to be arranged privately, rather from this consideration than with any idea that there might be a difficulty in finding adequate persons. But even the leading members of the Beargarden hesitated when the proposition was submitted to them with all its honours and all its responsibilities. Lord Nidderdale declared from the beginning that he would have nothing to do with it,--pleading his poverty openly. Beauchamp Beauclerk was of opinion that he himself did not frequent the club often enough. Mr Lupton professed his inability as a man of business. Lord Grasslough pleaded his father. The club from the first had been sure of Dolly Longestaffe's services;--for were not Dolly's pecuniary affairs now in process of satisfactory arrangement, and was it not known by all men that his courage never failed him in regard to money? But even he declined. 'I have spoken to Squercum,' he said to the Committee, 'and Squercum won't hear of it. Squercum has made inquiries and he thinks the club very shaky.' When one of the Committee made a remark as to Mr Squercum which was not complimentary,--insinuated indeed that Squercum without injustice might be consigned to the infernal deities Dolly took the matter up warmly. 'That's all very well for you, Grasslough; but if you knew the comfort of having a fellow who could keep you straight without preaching sermons at you you wouldn't despise Squercum. I've tried to go alone and I find that does not answer. Squercum's my coach, and I mean to stick pretty close to him.' Then it came to pass that the triumphant project as to the trustees fell to the ground, although Squercum himself advised that the difficulty might be lessened if three gentlemen could be selected who lived well before the world and yet had nothing to lose. Whereupon Dolly suggested Miles Grendall. But the committee shook its heads, not thinking it possible that the club could be re-established on a basis of three Miles Grendalls.|$|E
