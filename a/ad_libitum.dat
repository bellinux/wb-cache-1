5|$|A {{key part}} of the Recovery Plan is the {{supplementary}} feeding of females. The kakapo breeds only once every two to five years, when a certain type of plant species, primarily Dacrydium cupressinum (rimu), produces protein-rich fruit and seeds. Observations of the relationship between intermittent breeding and the plant's mast year help biologists choose which suitable supplementary foods to increase kakapo breeding frequency. In 1989, six preferred foods (apples, sweet potatoes, almonds, Brazil nuts, sunflower seeds and walnuts) were supplied <b>ad</b> <b>libitum</b> each night to 12 feeding stations. Males and females ate the supplied foods, and females nested on Little Barrier Island in the summers of 1989–91 {{for the first time since}} 1982, although nesting success was low.|$|E
5|$|Also {{frequently}} performed is the Fifth Symphony (Op. 50, 1921–22) presenting another {{battle between}} the forces of order and chaos. A snare drummer is given the task of interrupting the orchestra, playing <b>ad</b> <b>libitum</b> and out of time, as if to destroy the music. Performed by the Danish Radio Symphony Orchestra conducted by Erik Tuxen at the 1950 Edinburgh International Festival, it caused a sensation, sparking interest in Nielsen's music outside Scandinavia. In the Sixth Symphony (without opus number), written 1924–25, and subtitled Sinfonia Semplice (Simple Symphony), the tonal language seems {{similar to that in}} Nielsen's other symphonies, but the symphony develops into a sequence of cameos, some sad, some grotesque, some humorous.|$|E
5|$|The {{combination}} of Lutosławski's aleatory techniques and his harmonic discoveries {{allowed him to}} build up complex musical textures. According to Bodman Rae, in his later works Lutosławski evolved a more mobile, simpler, harmonic style, in which less of the music is played with an <b>ad</b> <b>libitum</b> coordination. This development {{first appeared in the}} brief Epitaph for oboe and piano, around the time Lutosławski was struggling to find the technical means to complete his Third Symphony. In chamber works for just two instrumentalists the scope for aleatory counterpoint and dense harmonies is significantly less than for orchestra, but these developments also influenced his orchestral style in late works including the Piano Concerto, Chantefleurs et Chantefables, Chain 2 and the Fourth Symphony, which require mostly conventional coordination.|$|E
5|$|The female {{may begin}} feeding by biting off the male's head (as {{they do with}} regular prey), and if mating has begun, the male's {{movements}} may become even more vigorous in its delivery of sperm. Early researchers thought that because copulatory movement is controlled by a ganglion in the abdomen, not the head, removal of the male's head was a reproductive strategy by females to enhance fertilization while obtaining sustenance. Later, this behavior {{appeared to be an}} artifact of intrusive laboratory observation. Whether the behavior is natural in the field or also the result of distractions caused by the human observer remains controversial. Mantises are highly visual organisms and notice any disturbance in the laboratory or field, such as bright lights or moving scientists. Chinese mantises that had been fed <b>ad</b> <b>libitum</b> (so that they were not hungry) actually displayed elaborate courtship behavior when left undisturbed. The male engages the female in a courtship dance, to change her interest from feeding to mating. Under such circumstances, the female has been known to respond with a defensive deimatic display by flashing the colored eyespots on the inside of her front legs.|$|E
25|$|More radical {{approaches}} have been studied. A duck or goose with a ventromedian hypothalamic (VMH) lesion will {{tend not to}} feel satiated after eating, and will therefore eat more than a non-lesioned animal. By producing such lesions surgically, {{it is possible to}} increase the bird's food consumption when permitted to eat <b>ad</b> <b>libitum,</b> by a factor of more than two.|$|E
25|$|Wojciech Sowiński was {{the next}} who {{arranged}} Mazurek Dąbrowskiego for the piano. The arrangement, accompanied by the lyrics in Polish and French, was published 1829 in Paris. The current official musical score of the national anthem was arranged by Kazimierz Sikorski and published by the Polish Ministry of Culture and National Heritage. Sikorski's harmonization allows for each vocal version to be performed either a cappella or together {{with any of the}} instrumental versions. Some orchestra parts, marked in the score as <b>ad</b> <b>libitum,</b> may be left out or replaced by other instruments of equivalent musical scale.|$|E
25|$|European art {{music is}} largely {{distinguished}} from many other non-European classical and some popular musical forms by its system of staff notation, in use since about the 11th century. Western staff notation {{is used by}} composers to indicate to the performer the pitches (which form the melodies, basslines and chords), tempo, metre and rhythms {{for a piece of}} music. This can leave less room for practices such as improvisation and <b>ad</b> <b>libitum</b> ornamentation, which are frequently heard in non-European art music and in popular-music styles such as jazz and blues. Another difference is that whereas most popular styles adopt the song (strophic) form or a derivation of this form, classical music has been noted for its development of highly sophisticated forms of instrumental music such as the fugue, concerto, symphony, sonata, and mixed vocal and instrumental styles such as opera.|$|E
500|$|The song {{opens with}} a four-measure introduction, which {{introduces}} the Dm9-Cmaj7 modal chord progression used for the song's three verses. [...] Following each verse is the chorus, where the harmony switches to a Cmaj7-Em7-F-B progression. [...] A bridge entirely in D minor precedes the third verse. [...] After the third chorus comes a coda, which closes the song as Stefani repeats the phrase [...] "a simple kind of life" [...] <b>ad</b> <b>libitum</b> while the song fades, as the song confirms its dreamy major tonality {{in a series of}} Cmaj7 and Fmaj7 chords.|$|E
500|$|The team of Madgulkar and Phadke {{would present}} {{a new song}} every week for a year. Every song would be aired first on a Friday morning and then again on Saturday and Sunday morning, between 8:45am and 9:00am IST. The {{programme}} was initially planned for a year (with 52 songs) with the concluding song Trīvār Jayajayakār Rāmā where Rama becomes the King, but 1955 in the Hindu calendar had an extra month (Adhikmās); therefore, four songs were added to extend the series {{to a total of}} fifty-six. The series ended with the song [...] "Gā Bāḷāno, Shrīrāmāyaṇ" [...] where the part post crown ceremony was added. Apart from the number of songs, Madgulkar and Phadke left music, lyrics and choice of singers <b>ad</b> <b>libitum.</b> Madgulkar was given artistic liberty for the choice of the meters for the song, execution of the story line, and the message he could convey through it.|$|E

2500|$|Lousadzak was Hovhaness's first work to {{make use}} of an {{innovative}} technique he called [...] "spirit murmur", an early example of aleatoric music inspired by a vision of Hermon di Giovanno.

2500|$|Piglets are weaned {{and removed}} from the sows at between two and five weeks old and placed in sheds, nursery barns or {{directly}} to growout barns.

[...] Such pens will usually not contain straw or other material. [...] Alternatively, a straw-lined shed may house a larger group in age groups.

2500|$|The Nath {{tradition}} {{was not a}} new movement, but one evolutionary phase of a very old Siddha tradition of India. The Siddha tradition explored Yoga, with the premise that human existence is a psycho-chemical process that can be perfected by a right combination of psychological, alchemy and physical techniques, thereby empowering one {{to a state of}} highest sprituality, living in prime condition <b>ad</b> <b>libitum,</b> and dying when one so desires into a calm, blissful transcendental state. The term siddha means [...] "perfect", and this premise was not limited to Siddha tradition but was shared by others such as the Rasayana school of Ayurveda.|$|E
2500|$|Producers outside France do {{not always}} {{force-feed}} birds to produce fattened livers considered to be foie gras, instead allowing them to eat freely, termed <b>ad</b> <b>libitum.</b> Interest in alternative production methods has grown recently due to ethical concerns in gavage-based foie gras production. Such livers are alternatively termed fatty goose liver, ethical foie gras, or humane foie gras. [...] The British supermarket chain Waitrose also provides a version of ethical foie gras which it calls (and has been trademarked) faux gras. This {{is not to be}} confused with the American product by the same name, produced by Regal Vegan, which has the US trademark for faux gras, and is actually a vegan, nut based spread.|$|E
2500|$|The three Masses, which Bruckner {{wrote in}} the 1860s and revised later on in his life, are more often performed. The Masses {{numbered}} 1 in D minor and 3 in F minor are for solo singers, mixed choir, organ <b>ad</b> <b>libitum</b> and orchestra, while No. 2 in E minor is for mixed choir and {{a small group of}} wind instruments, and was written in an attempt to meet the Cecilians halfway. The Cecilians wanted to rid church music of instruments entirely. No. 3 was clearly meant for concert, rather than liturgical performance, and it {{is the only one of}} his Masses in which he set the first line of the Gloria, [...] "Gloria in excelsis Deo", and of the Credo, [...] "Credo in unum Deum", to music. In concert performances of the other Masses, these lines are intoned by a tenor soloist in the way a priest would, with a line of plainsong.|$|E
2500|$|Tentatively in part III of Muziek voor fluit solo (1961), but {{especially}} {{by the time}} of Espaces à remplir (1963), the Deuxième série de rondeaux (1964), and <b>Ad</b> <b>libitum</b> (1965), Bois had begun including sections with degrees of improvisation ( [...] ; [...] ). In these works, du Bois would fix the registers of certain pitch-complexes to create groups that dominate one or more parts, or even the entire ensemble for sections of the score. Sometimes these are twelve-tone complexes and sometimes smaller sets (what Josef Matthias Hauer called “tropes”). These groups serve as the focus of passages that may either be written out in all details, or partly improvised. Bois expertly fashions such sections, either as monolithic blocks or, by contrast, in a counterpointing of different groups [...] Even in a fully notated score such as Muziek voor altblokfluit (1961), when working within these fixed pitch complexes du Bois said he had the feeling of improvising [...] "like a jazz piano player" [...] (quoted in [...] ).
