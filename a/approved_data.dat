This <b>approved</b> <b>data</b> is usually contained within the aircraft's manuals (aircraft maintenance manual, structural repair manual, component maintenance manuals etc.) issued by the aircraft's manufacturer. However, sometimes there is damage to the aircraft that is {{outside the scope of}} these manuals or the operator wishes to modify the aircraft to help it perform a specific function (aerial firefighting, search and rescue) or alter the aircraft in some other way. To ensure that the aircraft continues to be airworthy (i.e. safe to fly), the repair or modification must be examined by an aeronautical engineer so that the many complex factors that affect aircraft flight, structures and systems can be assessed and the design change approved as airworthy. To do this the engineer assesses the design of the modification or repair against the airworthiness requirements for the aircraft and then must justify that the design meets these requirements through the use of analysis, testing and experience. If the design has been shown to meet the airworthiness requirements it may be approved under Civil Aviation Regulation 35 (CAR35) and is hence 'approved data', satisfying CAR42U.|$|E

Particular attention was given to describing not only the accuracy limiting factors of pure satellite measurement, but also the influence of and conditions to be attached to real-time transmission. The investigations have shown that a DGPS with a positioning accuracy of 1 - 2 m is a location procedure that is fully operational and suitable for various locating tasks. Prerequisite to a direct operational capability in the locating mode is that a functional and <b>approved</b> <b>data</b> transmission be found. If for a locating task the locating accuracy of 1 - 2 m is fully sufficient and it is sure that even in the future there will be no increased requirements, then a relatively cost-efficient single-frequency receiver is sufficient. If on internal waterways a future altitude measurement accuracy of Class I quality is desired for DGPS, either investment should be made in the expensive dual-frequency technology or a simple receiver should be used as a make-shift solution. If further development of the system provides an altitude measurement accuracy of few centimeters, a DGPS would be suitable for any locating purpose in terms of accuracy.
