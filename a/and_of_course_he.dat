500|$|In a 2012 interview, Vladimir Kramnik {{stated that}} Carlsen's [...] "excellent {{physical}} shape" [...] was {{a contributing factor}} to his success against other top players as it prevents [...] "psychological lapses", which enables Carlsen to maintain a high standard of play over long games {{and at the end}} of tournaments, when the energy levels of others have dropped. Tyler Cowen gave a point of view on Carlsen's playing style: [...] "Carlsen is demonstrating one of his most feared qualities, namely his 'nettlesomeness,' to use a term coined for this purpose by Ken Regan. Using computer analysis, you can measure which players do the most to cause their opponents to make mistakes. Carlsen has the highest nettlesomeness score by this metric, because his creative moves pressure the other player and open up a lot of room for mistakes. In contrast, a player such as Kramnik plays a high percentage of very accurate moves, <b>and</b> <b>of</b> <b>course</b> <b>he</b> is very strong, but those moves are in some way calmer and they are less likely to induce mistakes in response." ...|$|E

500|$|.....we can deduce {{that the}} {{inhabitants}} of Hijaz during Muhammad's time knew portions, at least, of 3 Enoch {{in association with the}} Jews. The angels over which Metatron becomes chief are identified in the Enoch traditions as the sons of God, the Bene Elohim, the Watchers, the fallen ones as the causer of the flood. In 1 Enoch, and 4 Ezra, the term Son of God {{can be applied to the}} Messiah, but most often it is applied to the righteous men, of whom Jewish tradition holds there to be no more righteous than the ones God elected to translate to heaven alive. It is easy, then, to imagine that among the Jews of the Hijaz who were apparently involved in mystical speculations associated with the merkabah, Ezra, because of the traditions of his translation, because of his piety, and particularly because he was equated with Enoch as the Scribe of God, could be termed one of the Bene Elohim. <b>And,</b> <b>of</b> <b>course,</b> <b>he</b> would fit the description of religious leader (one of the ahbar of the Qur'an 9:31) whom the Jews had exalted.|$|E
500|$|From the 1930s, Jinnah {{suffered}} from tuberculosis; only {{his sister and}} a few others close to him were aware of his condition. Jinnah believed public knowledge of his lung ailments would hurt him politically. In a 1938 letter, he wrote to a supporter that [...] "you must have read in the papers how during my tours... I suffered, which was not because there was anything wrong with me, but the irregularities [...] and over-strain told upon my health". Many years later, Mountbatten stated that if he had known Jinnah was so physically ill, he would have stalled, hoping Jinnah's death would avert partition. [...] Fatima Jinnah later wrote, [...] "even in his hour of triumph, the Quaid-e-Azam was gravely ill... He worked in a frenzy to consolidate Pakistan. <b>And,</b> <b>of</b> <b>course,</b> <b>he</b> totally neglected his health..." [...] Jinnah worked with a tin of Craven [...] "A" [...] cigarettes at his desk, of which he had smoked 50 or more a day for the previous 30 years, as well as a box of Cuban cigars. [...] As his health got worse, he took longer and longer rest breaks in the private wing of Government House in Karachi, where only he, Fatima and the servants were allowed.|$|E
500|$|It was {{not clear}} whether the Department of State or Lodge was {{enthusiastic}} about the political change in Saigon at the time, but if they were not, they were handed a fait accompli. A CIA report from Saigon soon after the seizure of power told the State Department that [...] "It {{is safe to say that}} Khánh's group will be essentially pro-American, anti-communist and anti-neutralist in general orientation." [...] As far as Harkins was concerned, with US policy committed to maintaining leadership in the hands of senior military officers, there were no other apparent options; he told General Taylor, [...] "One thing is for sure with this coup. We've gone through all the eligible general officers." [...] For his part, Lodge chose not to warn the junta, to which the embassy had pledged their support, as to the imminent plot, despite being well aware of it. He said in a cable a few days after the coup that [...] "General Khánh's coup was extremely disconcerting at first blush", but that the lack of public reaction to the overthrow of Minh indicated that Khánh's actions were not something to be alarmed about. He wrote that the progress of history was often made in many phases by different individuals or groups, using the analogy that in an American political party, the people who manage the primary campaigns are different from those who run the national elections, while the officer-holders are entirely separate. Lodge speculated that while Minh and his generals were successful in removing Diệm—something Lodge strongly encouraged—they may not be the ideal administrators of a nation themselves. With respect to the prospects of defeating the communists, he said [...] "Our side knows how to do it; we have the means with which to do it; we simply need to do it. This requires a tough and ruthless commander. Perhaps Khánh is it." [...] Blair said that Lodge's habit of looking for American parallels to Vietnamese situations hindered his judgment, pointing out that Khánh's rule merely saw more instability and chaos. At the end of February, Lodge was still positive and cabled Washington to say that [...] "I continue to be favorably impressed by him. He is really very much more able than the Minh, Don, Kim group <b>and,</b> <b>of</b> <b>course,</b> <b>he</b> is so far above Diệm and Nhu that there is no comparison." ...|$|E

2500|$|Tillman Johnson said, [...] "Whenever he {{came down}} the stairs from his hotel room, he called for the press. He was a showman. He was a {{handsome}} man, I'd say, {{and he made a}} good appearance <b>and</b> <b>of</b> <b>course</b> <b>he</b> had a reputation for being a killer. So the press all followed Gonzaullas." [...] He also said, [...] "No, he didn't do any real police work himself. He'd get in that car and ride around, {{ask a lot of questions}} about what the other officers had found then he'd release it to the press like it was his information. It got to where after a while some officers wouldn't tell him anything." ...|$|E
2500|$|The most {{influential}} person as Hadlee developed and through {{his career was}} Dennis Lillee as the epitome of what fast bowling was all about. [...] "He was big, strong, fit, confident, aggressive, had marvelous skills, great technique, he intimidated the batsmen with sheer presence <b>and</b> <b>of</b> <b>course</b> <b>he</b> got you out!" [...] In tough times Hadlee put himself in his shoes and thought, [...] "what would Lillee do?". The sure answer was he would never give up. In his book Menace, Lillee believed that determination was the greatest contribution to his success. Of Hadlee he considers him super skillful, the first true professional he saw in tests with serial away swingers on off stump with the occasional inswinger or cutter, the odd bouncer and a very rare yorker.|$|E
2500|$|Charles Mingus {{had known}} Eric from {{growing up in}} Los Angeles, and Dolphy joined his band shortly after {{arriving}} in New York. He took part in Mingus' big band recording Pre-Bird, and is featured on [...] "Bemoanable Lady". Later he joined Mingus' working band which also included Dannie Richmond and Ted Curson. They worked at the Showplace during 1960 and recorded two early albums together, Charles Mingus Presents Charles Mingus and Mingus at Antibes (the latter adding Booker Ervin on all tracks except [...] "What Love?" [...] and Bud Powell for [...] "I'll Remember April"). Dolphy, Mingus said, [...] "was a complete musician. He could fit anywhere. He was a fine lead alto in a big band. He could make it in a classical group. <b>And,</b> <b>of</b> <b>course,</b> <b>he</b> was entirely his own man when he soloed.... He had mastered jazz.

2500|$|Filming {{started on}} May 6, 1935 with Chester Lyons as the cinematographer. Freund insisted on Gregg Toland, whom he got for a {{reported}} [...] "8 days of additional photography". Actress Frances Drake recalled difficulty between Freund, Toland and Considine. Drake said that [...] "Freund {{wanted to be}} the cinematographer at the same time", and that [...] "You never knew who was directing. The producer was dying to, to tell you the truth, <b>and</b> <b>of</b> <b>course</b> <b>he</b> had no idea of directing." [...] Several titles for the film were announced, and on May 22, 1935, MGM announced that the title would be The Hands of Orlac. The Mad Doctor of Paris was also suggested, but the studio eventually settled on the original title of Mad Love. Shooting finished on June 8, 1935, one week over schedule. After the initial release, MGM cut about fifteen minutes of scenes from the film. Cut scenes included the surgery to get Rollo's hands, a pre-credit warning scene similar to the one in Frankenstein, and Isabel Jewell's entire portrayal of the character Marianne.|$|E
2500|$|Antonio {{inherited}} the studio against {{the claims of}} Annibale’s surviving brother Giovanni Antonio, who contested the inheritance by throwing doubt on his nephew’s paternity. [...] Despite gaining commissions, those from the Cardinal Pietro Aldobrandini, the main patron after the Farnese, declined once the cardinal's uncle Clement VIII died in 1605. This also coincides {{with the onset of}} Annibale’s incapacitating illness. The ascent of the Borghese Pope, Paul V, continued the decline of the studio. By report, Annibale could not receive Cardinal Scipione Borghese, slipping out of a back door {{when he came to the}} studio; but Antonio was introduced to the pope's Prodatario, Cardinal Tonti, also an avid collector. Tonti employed Antonio to paint four chapels in his church; other public commissions included a chapel in Santa Maria in Monticelli, work in Sant' Girolamo dei Schiavoni, Santa Maria in Trastevere, and Sant' Sebastiano fuori le Mura, and in Palazzo Mattei. Antonio and Guido Reni collaborated in the decoration of the Cappella dell’ Annunciata in the Palazzo Quirinal, painting a frieze of the Stanza del Diluvio. He contributed, around 1616, to the Alexander frescoes done for Cardinal Peretti Montalto; other works were done for Marchese Giustiniani, Cardinal Orsino, the Ludovisi, Cavalier Sachetti, Dionigio Buonavia in Bologna; <b>and</b> <b>of</b> <b>course</b> <b>he</b> was under the protection of Cardinal Odoardo Farnese, who recognized him as his ‘pittor di casa’ and paid him a monthly stipend.|$|E

5000|$|The Lone Wolf and His Lady was theatrically {{released}} in the United States in August 1949.

Randell previously helped kill the Bulldog Drummond series, and does the same here in this final entry. Mowbray inherits Eric Blore's role as Jamison the valet." [...] As a [...] "relaunch" [...] of the series, The Lone Wolf and His Lady was not considered successful, subsequently, Columbia ended the film series.|$|R
