5|$|Most {{of their}} water is {{obtained}} from their food, though they will drink water when available. As they quickly {{adjust to the}} surroundings due to seasonal changes and other causes, they <b>also</b> <b>change</b> their feeding habits. They also use their horns to break off branches {{that are hard to}} reach.|$|E
5|$|The game offers {{players the}} ability to create their own custom teams. Each team has its own name and {{includes}} eight individually named worms. The player can <b>also</b> <b>change</b> the team's special weapon, grave marker, flag, victory fanfare, and voice set. In addition to numerous defaults available, the game offers {{the ability to}} import custom voices.|$|E
5|$|All banksias have {{developed}} proteoid or cluster roots {{in response to}} the nutrient poor conditions of Australian soils (particularly lacking in phosphorus). The plant develop masses of fine lateral roots that form a mat-like structure underneath the soil surface, and enable it to extract nutrients as efficiently possible out of the soil. A study of three co-occurring species in banksia woodland in southwestern Australia—Banksia menziesii, B. attenuata and B. ilicifolia—found that all three develop fresh roots in September after winter rainfall, and that the bacteria populations associated with the root systems of B. menziesii differ from the other two, and that they <b>also</b> <b>change</b> depending on the age of the roots.|$|E
30|$|The art museums’ {{visitors}} have <b>also</b> <b>changed</b> {{expectations and}} needs.|$|R
50|$|The {{design of}} an officer's badge <b>also</b> <b>changes</b> by rank.|$|R
50|$|The fleet colours were <b>also</b> <b>changed</b> to white, black, {{blue and}} red.|$|R
5|$|Andean cocks-of-the-rocks {{influence}} the environment around them. It {{was found that}} a white-capped dipper renovated an abandoned cock-of-the-rock nest to lay its eggs in. Cock-of-the-rocks <b>also</b> <b>change</b> the surrounding flora through seed dispersal. Seeds that the birds ingest often are found deposited around lek and nesting sites. This favours the germination and growth of those seeds. The diversity {{of these types of}} seeds {{has been found to be}} increased at lek and nests and decreased throughout the surrounding forest.|$|E
5|$|El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) {{influences}} the average location of upper-level jet streams, {{and leads to}} cyclical variations in precipitation and temperature across North America, as well as affecting tropical cyclone development across the eastern Pacific and Atlantic basins. Combined with the Pacific Decadal Oscillation, ENSO can also impact cold season rainfall in Europe. Changes in ENSO <b>also</b> <b>change</b> {{the location of the}} jet stream over South America, which partially affects precipitation distribution over the continent.|$|E
5|$|The game {{begins with}} {{character}} creation, where the player assigns attribute points (such as strength, intelligence, charisma) to The Nameless One. The Nameless One starts {{the game as}} a fighter, but the player may later change his character class to thief or wizard, with the option to <b>also</b> <b>change</b> back to fighter, after finding corresponding tutors. The player may recruit adventuring companions {{over the course of}} the game; there are seven potential party members, but a maximum of five may accompany the player at any one time. Conversation is frequent among party members, occurring both randomly and during conversations with other non-player characters.|$|E
5000|$|The {{attribute}} of the Portuguese sovereign <b>also</b> <b>changed</b> several times as well: ...|$|R
50|$|WebCrawler <b>also</b> <b>changed</b> {{its image}} in early 2008, {{scrapping}} its classic spider mascot.|$|R
5000|$|Goro's {{fight with}} the giant sea louse; the louse's voice was <b>also</b> <b>changed.</b>|$|R
5|$|The game {{is played}} from an {{isometric}} perspective, and the screen, which {{does not need to}} remain centered on the protagonist, can be scrolled with the mouse or the keyboard. Areas are revealed as they are explored by the player's characters. A fog of war effect hides explored areas when the player's characters move away from them. The player can <b>also</b> <b>change</b> the formation in which the party moves. Clicking an area exit, such as a doorway or staircase, causes another area to be loaded. Clicking on the edge of an outside area causes the party to travel there; the game then presents the player with the World Map, from which the player may select a destination.|$|E
5|$|After the gubernatorial {{election}} in 1999, Louisville senator Dan Seum {{announced he would}} change his party affiliation from Democrat to Republican, citing his conservative voting history, including opposition to the state lottery, KERA, and abortion. This switch, which Patton learned of too late to intervene, equalized the number of Democrats and Republicans in the Senate. Six weeks later, Paducah senator Bob Leeper announced he would <b>also</b> <b>change</b> his party affiliation. Patton traveled to Paducah and met with Leeper, {{but was unable to}} convince him to remain a Democrat. Leeper had a history of conflict with Democratic Senate President Larry Saunders, but he insisted his party switch, like Seum's, was based on political philosophy. Leeper's switch gave Republicans a majority in the Senate {{for the first time in}} the state's history. David Williams was elected President of the Senate, and held the Republican majority together effectively. Consequently, Patton faced a difficult task in maneuvering his agenda through a divided General Assembly.|$|E
5|$|Fares on Community Transit buses {{are priced}} into three groups: adult, youth, and reduced. Adult fare is charged for {{passengers}} {{between the ages}} of 19 and 64, youth fare is charged for passengers between ages 6 & 18, and the reduced fare is charged for passengers over the age of 65 or those with disabilities or Medicare card holders. Up to two children under 5 ride free with a chaperone paying full or reduced fare for themselves. Fares <b>also</b> <b>change</b> based on service level, with local service within Snohomish County costing the least and commuter service to Seattle being more expensive; commuter service from southern Snohomish County and Everett is also less costly compared to commuter service from northern and eastern Snohomish County. The last fare increase occurred on July 1, 2015, raising the adult and DART fares by 25 cents.|$|E
5000|$|The vocal 'O' in the Qormi dialect <b>also</b> <b>changes</b> into 'U'. For example: ...|$|R
25|$|The balance-flow speeds <b>also</b> <b>changes</b> {{with the}} radius of {{curvature}} R of the trajectory/isobar.|$|R
50|$|The team <b>also</b> <b>changed</b> home venues, {{moving from}} West Chester University to Widener University.|$|R
5|$|Mini Metro is puzzle {{strategy}} video game, {{in which}} players are tasked with building an efficient rail transit network for {{a rapidly growing}} city. Each level is a flat depiction of a real city and begins with three train stations. Train stations are represented by different shaped nodes. Players can construct routes to link stations by drawing lines between them; each route has a different colour. Passengers appear at stations, each denoted by a shape that identifies which station they want to travel to. Trains travel along routes taking passengers to their desired stations. Rivers, intersecting train lines {{and the appearance of}} more stations and passengers over time causes the transit network to become more complex and difficult to manage. Common-shaped stations can <b>also</b> <b>change</b> their node shape into rarer ones. The game's visual style is minimalist, employing straight lines and bold colours, similar to modern transit maps.|$|E
25|$|A Thai {{wife that}} adopted her husband's surname {{due to the}} old law {{requiring}} it, can <b>also</b> <b>change</b> back to use her original surname.|$|E
25|$|Checked {{exceptions}} are problematic, because when a lower-level function adds a new exception type, the whole chain of methods using this method at some nested lower level must <b>also</b> <b>change</b> its contract. This violates the open/closed principle.|$|E
50|$|The {{schedule}} <b>also</b> <b>changes</b> {{during school}} holidays were RTÉjr is largely replaced by TRTÉ.|$|R
50|$|The {{company logo}} for Interfleet has <b>also</b> <b>changed</b> {{throughout}} its history as shown below.|$|R
50|$|From season 4 to onwards, {{the grand}} finale is {{held at the}} Stein Studios of Ratmalana, which is a private {{property}} of Sirasa TV. The cash prize <b>also</b> <b>changed</b> in the fifth season, where the winner won 10 million Sri Lankan rupees. The performing stages <b>also</b> <b>changed</b> from season five, with the inclusion of Battle Round and Live Audition Round.|$|R
25|$|The {{power of}} the engine could <b>also</b> <b>change</b> {{according}} to the octane rating of the aviation fuel being used. Higher octane fuels allowed boost pressures to be increased without the risks of pre-ignition or knocking.|$|E
25|$|Notably, {{during this}} time his {{physical}} characteristics <b>also</b> <b>change</b> dramatically, {{and by the time}} Arthur Hastings meets Poirot again in Curtain, he looks very different from his previous appearances, having become thin with age and with obviously dyed hair.|$|E
25|$|Formation of a {{chemical}} complex may <b>also</b> <b>change</b> solubility. A well-known example, is {{the addition of a}} concentrated solution of ammonia to a suspension of silver chloride, in which dissolution is favoured by the formation of an ammine complex.|$|E
50|$|In 2007, Kawasaki {{launched}} a newer {{version of the}} Z750. The styling was slightly changed and include a bikini fairing. The engine vibration was reduced {{and it was also}} revised for more torque. The front suspension was <b>also</b> <b>changed</b> to an Upside Down Fork. The front and rear disk brakes have been changed to a petal design. The exhaust design was <b>also</b> <b>changed..</b>|$|R
25|$|Resistivity {{varies with}} temperature. In semiconductors, {{resistivity}} <b>also</b> <b>changes</b> {{when exposed to}} light. See below.|$|R
5000|$|Harare [...] - [...] named Salisbury until 1982. Other {{place names}} in Zimbabwe <b>also</b> <b>changed.</b>|$|R
25|$|The Atmospheric {{pressure}} can <b>also</b> <b>change</b> the signals reception delay, {{due to the}} dry gases present at the troposphere (78% N2, 21% O2, 0.9% Ar...). Its effect varies with local temperature and atmospheric pressure in quite a predictable manner using {{the laws of the}} ideal gases.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the biggest}} {{challenges}} in this research area are due to the peculiar size-effect. Researchers try to solve the problems caused by the extremely high surface-to-volume ratios. Under this condition, adsorption of molecules can lead to large losses and can <b>also</b> <b>change</b> the surface properties.|$|E
25|$|Characters {{can have}} up to 15 {{keyboard}} commands, plus idle, death, and injury animations. They can hold an inventory and money, earn score, gain and lose hit points and lives, and track several counters—often used for keys and similar functions. Monsters have simple animations and movements, and can <b>also</b> <b>change</b> behavior {{in response to the}} player.|$|E
5000|$|I-90/Ohio 2 at Ohio 57 near Elyria, Ohio was <b>also</b> <b>changed</b> {{in the mid}} 1990s.|$|R
5000|$|It <b>also</b> <b>changes</b> how {{and when}} General Fund {{borrowing}} of certain transportation funds is allowed.|$|R
5000|$|The {{allocation}} {{of the money}} raised between various US agencies and programs was <b>also</b> <b>changed.</b>|$|R
