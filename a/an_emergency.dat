40|$|<b>A</b> vegetated <b>emergency</b> {{spillway}} is <b>an</b> open channel, usually trapezoidal in cross-section, that {{is constructed}} beside an embankment. It {{consists of an}} inlet channel, a control section, and an exit channel, and is lined with erosion-resistant vegetation. Purpose The purpose of <b>a</b> vegetated <b>emergency</b> spillway is to convey flows that are greater than the principal spillway’s design discharge at a non-erosive velocity to an adequate channel. Conditions Where Practice <b>A</b> vegetated <b>emergency</b> spillway is appropriate to use when the required maximum design flood volume exceeds {{the capacity of the}} principal spillway system. <b>A</b> vegetated <b>emergency</b> spillway may also be used as a safety feature to pass flood flows when or if the principal spillway becomes clogged. Planning Considerations The adjacent topography (steepness of the abutments), the existing or proposed land use, and other factors (such as a roadway over the embankment) influence the design and construction of <b>a</b> vegetated <b>emergency</b> spillway...|$|R
