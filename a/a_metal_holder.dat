40|$|A new {{technique}} on friction aided deep drawing has been proposed. <b>A</b> <b>metal</b> blank <b>holder</b> {{was designed to}} be of two layers: stationary layer or base with four planes of 5 degrees taper angle and moving layer divided into four tapered segments. Under appropriate blank holding force, these four segments can move radially to the die opening with a constant speed by using a specially designed compression tool. The main function of this developed blank holding device is adopting the frictional force between the blank and the blank holder to work in the useful drawing direction likewise the function of the rubber ring used in Maslennikov's process. Drawing deformation is efficiently performed by using <b>an</b> assistant <b>metal</b> punch, which is supplemented with a hydraulic cylinder to provide a constant punch force during the drawing process. The drawing mechanism and the effects of drawing conditions are mainly investigated to characterize the merits and defects of the proposed process. Since successful deep cups of drawing ratio 3. 76 have been produced the possibility of the present technique is already confirmed, however, further investigations are needed to enhance the drawing efficiency.

50|$|The {{process for}} making the {{americium}} used in the buttons on ionization-type smoke detectors begins with americium dioxide. The AmO2 is thoroughly mixed with gold, shaped into a briquette, and fused by pressure and heat at over 1470°F (800°C). A backing of silver and a front covering of gold (or an alloy of gold or palladium) are applied to the briquette and sealed by hot forging. The briquette is then processed through several stages of cold rolling to achieve the desired thickness and levels of radiation emission. The final thickness is about 0.008 inches (0.2 mm), with the gold cover representing about {{one percent of the}} thickness. The resulting foil strip, which is about 0.8 inches (20 mm) wide, is cut into sections 39 inches (1 meter) long. The sources are punched out of the foil strip.

40|$|Background : Chip-off {{fracture}} of veneering porcelain {{has been described}} as the most frequent reason for the failure of zirconia-based fixed partial dentures. The {{purpose of this study was}} to evaluate the shear bond strength (SBS) of two commercial zirconia core ceramics to their corresponding veneering ceramics. Materials and Methods : Zirconia disks with 7 -mm diameter and 3 -mm height were prepared (Cercon and Biodenta systems) and veneered with recommended layering ceramics (Cercon ceram and 2 in 1 ceramic, respectively) (n = 10). The disks were polished with diamond paste and airborne-particle abraded before layering. The specimens were mounted in <b>a</b> T-shaped <b>metal</b> <b>holder</b> using autopolymerized acrylic resin and stored in 37 ΀C distilled water for one week, after which they were subjected to thermal cycling. SBS of zirconia core to veneering ceramic was measured using a universal testing machine and failure modes were determined microscopically. Data were analyzed using t test (α < 0. 05). Results : Mean (΁SD) SBS values were 27. 19 (΁ 3. 43) and 28. 22 (΁ 4. 08) MPa for Cercon and Biodenta systems, respectively, with no significant difference. Biodenta system showed more adhesive failure compared to more combined (adhesive and cohesive) failures in Cercon system. Conclusion: Within the limitations of this study it can be concluded that SBS of Biodenta and Cercon specimens were nearly the same, but the fracture mode of these two systems were different. Since Biodenta fracture pattern was predominantly adhesive, it seems that maybe Biodenta porcelain was stronger than Cercon porcelain where as its adhesive bond was weaker...|$|R
40|$|Diamond {{smoothing}} tools {{have been}} proposed for use in conjunction with diamond cutting tools {{that are used in}} many finish-machining operations. Diamond machining (including finishing) is often used, for example, in fabrication of precise metal mirrors. A diamond smoothing tool according to the proposal would have a smooth spherical surface. For a given finish machining operation, the smoothing tool would be mounted next to the cutting tool. The smoothing tool would slide on the machined surface left behind by the cutting tool, plastically deforming the surface material and thereby reducing the roughness of the surface, closing microcracks and otherwise generally reducing or eliminating microscopic surface and subsurface defects, and increasing the microhardness of the surface layer. It has been estimated that if smoothing tools of this type were used in conjunction with cutting tools on sufficiently precise lathes, {{it would be possible to}} reduce the roughness of machined surfaces to as little as 3 nm. A tool according to the proposal would consist of a smoothing insert in <b>a</b> <b>metal</b> <b>holder.</b> The smoothing insert would be made from a diamond/metal functionally graded composite rod preform, which, in turn, would be made by sintering together a bulk single-crystal or polycrystalline diamond, a diamond powder, and a metallic alloy at high pressure. To form the spherical smoothing tip, the diamond end of the preform would be subjected to flat grinding, conical grinding, spherical grinding using diamond wheels, and finally spherical polishing and/or buffing using diamond powders. If the diamond were a single crystal, then it would be crystallographically oriented, relative to the machining motion, to minimize its wear and maximize its hardness. Spherically polished diamonds could also be useful for purposes other than smoothing in finish machining: They would likely also be suitable for use as heat-resistant, wear-resistant, unlubricated sliding-fit bearing inserts...|$|E
40|$|A {{study of}} RIE {{contamination}} f blanket-etched silicon surfaces was initiated {{to ensure that}} the use of RIE is compatible with VLSI applications. Contamination is of greater concern as device dimensions shrink because full dry etching in critical process teps is required to control the smaller dimensions. Silicon surfaces were blanket etched in CF 4, CF 4 + 02, and CF 4 + H 2. The RIE contamination was characterized by incorporating the etched silicon surface into MOS capacitors. The MOS retention time was measured to detect he presence of fast-diffusing heavy metals in the silicon, and the dielectric break-down defect density of the oxide was calculated to evaluate the quality of the etched surface. Small amounts of heavy metals on the RIE cathode resulted in poor MOS retention time in etched silicon wafers. However, the stainless teel walls and grounded surfaces are not sources of contamination in an RIE reactor. The silicon surfaces were roughened microscopically when etched on <b>a</b> <b>metal</b> substrate <b>holder.</b> The surface roughness resulted in a lower average breakdown field of the ther-mally grown oxide.

40|$|JRC-Geel is {{a partner}} in the EMRP project named MetroDecom, Metrology for {{decommissioning}} nuclear facilities. The project focusses on the different aspects of metrology applied in the field of decommissioning of nuclear facilities. The commitments of the Radionuclide Metrology Sector of JRC-Geel (RN) were to conduct part of the work to be carried out in WP 5 Development of reference materials and standard sources. In Task 1 reference materials and standard sources for segregation of materials and for free release measurements needed to be produced and characterised. From a standard solution a mother dilution was made to obtain a solution with an activity concentration of around 100 Bq per 20 μL. The solution was dispensed in the cavity of 1120 metallic source holders making use of a precision pattern dispenser. After evaporation of the liquid, the cavity of the CMI source holders was mechanically closed. Before and during the source preparation, check sources in the shape of aluminium pills were produced in order to monitor the stability of the activity concentration of the mother solution. The activity of all the sources was determined by gamma-ray spectroscopic measurements using a NaI-well detector. Some outliers were identified and 1100 sources with certified activity content were selected and made available for further use in Work Package 2 of the project. On the basis of the activity calculations it can be stated that sources were successfully prepared according to the specifications and will be used as calibration standards for the calibration of a free release measurement facility to measure radioactive waste. They can also be used as calibration standard for the calibration of waste segregation facilities. One of the deliverables in the task was to develop a reference material for the calibration of a free release facility and testing facility for segregation of waste. The sources are in the form of 1100 steel and 1100 plastic balls with point sources of 152 Eu and 60 Co inside.
