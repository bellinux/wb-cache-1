The film <b>also</b> <b>used</b> <b>the</b> theme of atomic bombs that was present in many films at the time, but showed how the weapons, which devastated the Japanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki a decade earlier, could be put to good use.

This change can be seen in the relationship between the League and non-members. The United States and Russia, for example, increasingly worked with the League. During the second half of the 1920s, France, Britain and Germany were all using the League of Nations as the focus of their diplomatic activity, and each of their foreign secretaries attended League meetings at Geneva during this period.

5|$|By his own reckoning, Offenbach {{composed}} {{more than}} 100 operas. Both {{the number and}} the noun are open to question: some works were so extensively revised that he evidently counted the revised versions as new, and commentators generally refer to {{all but a few}} of his stage works as operettas, rather than operas. Offenbach reserved the term opérette (English: operetta) or opérette bouffe for some of his one-act works, more often using the term opéra bouffe for his full-length ones (though {{there are a number of}} one- and two-act examples of this type). It was only with the further development of the Operette genre in Vienna after 1870 that the French term opérette began to be used for works longer than one act. Offenbach <b>also</b> <b>used</b> <b>the</b> term opéra-comique for at least 24 of his works in either one, two or three acts.|$|E
