40|$|In this paper, we make <b>attacks</b> <b>on</b> DBL (Double-Block-Length) hash {{modes of}} block ciphers with n-bit key and n-bit block. Our {{preimage}} <b>attack</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> hash function of MDC- 4 scheme requires the time complexity 23 n/ 2, which is significantly improved {{compared to the}} previous results. Our collision <b>attack</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> hash function of MJH scheme has time complexity less than 2124 for n = 128. Our preimage <b>attack</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> compression function of MJH scheme find a preimage with time complexity of 2 n.

Our preimage <b>attack</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> compression function of Mennink’s scheme find a preimage with time complexity of 23 n/ 2.
