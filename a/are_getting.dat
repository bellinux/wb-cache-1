5|$|Cyclotorna monocentra moths feed on meat ant broods. The larvae {{of these}} moths are parasites to leafhoppers and {{will move to}} meat ant colonies to {{complete}} their development, where they will proceed to consume the brood; the females lay many eggs near ant trails which {{are close to the}} leafhoppers tended by ants. Other observations show that the Iphierga macarista larvae are scavengers in meat ant nests, while Sphallomorpha beetles live in burrows near nests of meat ants, where the larvae capture and prey on workers passing by. The larvae of the spitfire sawfly and Pseudoperga guerini are able to regurgitate a fluid against the meat ant if they <b>are</b> <b>getting</b> attacked by them; depending on how much is regurgitated, an ant will either walk away and clean itself or become fatally affected by it. Lizards such as the thorny dragon, which is a sit and wait predator, consume meat ants, but other lizards which eat Iridomyrmex ants usually reject this species.|$|E
