2500|$|... 1999: General Mitchell's {{portrait}} {{was put on}} a U.S. postage stamp. Although the 55-cent stamp met an <b>airmail</b> <b>rate</b> and portrayed {{a figure}} important {{to the development of}} aviation, it was not marked or issued as an airmail stamp. It also met the two-ounce first-class rate in effect at the time.|$|R
25|$|The {{structure}} of postal rates followed broadly British practice and new services, like airmail and express delivery, were added over the years. From 1926 reduced rates applied for mail to Britain and Ireland, and from 1 March 1938 to 4 September 1939, Palestine {{was part of}} the All Up Empire <b>airmail</b> <b>rates</b> system.|$|R
5|$|Seven Irish airmail stamps {{were issued}} between 1948 and 1965 in the 1d, 3d, 6d, 8d, 1/-, 1/3 and 1/5 values. No {{specific}} <b>airmail</b> <b>rate</b> existed for the 1d and 3d stamps though their use was permitted on non-airmail correspondence; all others paid a contemporaneous rate when first produced. These {{were the only}} airmail stamps ever issued but many definitives and commemoratives have been produced in values that paid the postage <b>rate</b> for <b>airmail</b> service.|$|R
25|$|James Monroe {{appears on}} the 5-cent 1938 Presidential Series stamp, the fifth {{president}} of the United States. Monroe was a prominent leader in the Revolutionary War, and is known for the “Monroe Doctrine” of his presidency, warning Europeans {{to stay out of}} the Americas. Monroe’s likeness was taken from a medal from the U.S. Mint. The 5-cent was used for the one-ounce international surface rate and later the one-ounce domestic <b>airmail</b> <b>rate.</b>|$|R

5000|$|However, two {{modifications}} {{were made}} on the Singapore postal system in Christmas Island: the <b>airmail</b> postage <b>rate</b> to Australia was reduced and Australian cancelling stamps were sent in 1958 with the designation: [...] "CHRISTMAS ISLAND / INDIAN OCEAN / AUST".|$|R
50|$|The P&T Department issued three aerogrammes {{over the}} years. Around 1970 {{the first one}} was issued with an {{imprinted}} stamp of 85 Chetrum, picturing a dancing demon, and in 1979 a second aerogramme was issued, with the same design but the imprinted stamp had a new face value of Nu 1.25. The third and final aerogramme was issued around 1989 with a different lay-out and the imprinted stamp of Nu. 3.50 depicts birds and flowers. The 1970 aerogramme has been available in later years surcharged to Nu. 1.50 with a postage pre-paid seal. The Nu. 3.50 aerogramme is still on sale at GPO Thimphu, but has to be uprated to the current <b>airmail</b> <b>rate</b> by adding the necessary postage stamps.|$|R
50|$|During the occupation, Greek airmail {{was limited}} to two {{domestic}} routes; Athens-Thessaloniki and Athens-Heraklion. Foreign destinations were likewise restricted to Germany, Italy and certain Axis-occupied countries. At first, Greek postage due stamps were converted for airmail use by being overprinted with a small airplane design in red. However, these sold out rather quickly, creating {{the need for a}} new issue. A set of six values (2, 5, 10, 20, 25 and 50 drachmae) with designs by O. Perivolarakis depicting various Anemoi, or wind gods, was released on August 15, 1942. This set was re-printed in 1943, with three existing values (10, 25 and 50 drachmae) in different colors from the originals and three new values (100, 200 and 400 drachmae). Inflation rendered these stamps useless for mailing by April 1944; they were withdrawn from circulation in July. In the meantime, the use of regular stamps to cover <b>airmail</b> <b>rates</b> was allowed.|$|R

50|$|The postal {{services}} of some countries {{also offer a}} form of letter sheet called an aerogram consisting of a blank sheet of paper with folding instructions and adhesive flaps that becomes its own envelope, and carries prepaid postage at either the international <b>airmail</b> letter <b>rate</b> or at a special lower aerogram rate. Letter sheets lend themselves to airmail usage because they are lightweight. Enclosures are not permitted in aerograms. Sales of aerograms in the United States ended in 2006 due to poor sales.|$|R
50|$|Hoover {{appointed}} Brown as {{postmaster general}} in 1929. In 1930, with the nation's airlines apparently headed for extinction {{in the face}} of a severe economic downturn and citing inefficient, expensive subsidized air mail delivery, Brown requested supplementary legislation to the 1925 act granting him authority to change postal policy. The Air Mail Act of 1930, passed on April 29 and known as the McNary-Watres Act after its chief sponsors, Sen. Charles L. McNary of Oregon and Rep. Laurence H. Watres of Pennsylvania, authorized the postmaster general to enter into longer-term <b>airmail</b> contracts with <b>rates</b> based on space or volume, rather than weight. The Act gave Brown strong authority (some argued almost dictatorial powers) over the nationwide air transportation system.|$|R
