50|$|The <b>Abbe</b> <b>condenser</b> {{is named}} for its {{inventor}} Ernst Abbe, who developed it in 1870. The <b>Abbe</b> <b>condenser,</b> which was originally designed for Zeiss, is mounted below {{the stage of the}} microscope. The condenser concentrates and controls the light that passes through the specimen prior to entering the objective. It has two controls, one which moves the <b>Abbe</b> <b>condenser</b> closer to or further from the stage, and another, the iris diaphragm, which controls the diameter of the beam of light. The controls can be used to optimize brightness, evenness of illumination, and contrast. Abbe condensers are difficult to use for magnifications of above 400X, as the aplanatic cone is only representative of an NA 0.6.|$|E
50|$|The Arlow-Abbe {{condenser}} is {{a modified}} <b>Abbe</b> <b>condenser</b> that replaces the iris diaphragm, filter holder, lamp and lamp optics {{with a small}} OLED or LCD digital display unit. The display unit allows for digitally synthesised filters for dark-field, Rheinberg, oblique and dynamic (constantly changing) illumination under direct computer control. The device was first described by Dr. Jim Arlow in Microbe Hunter magazine, issue 38.|$|E
50|$|This {{condenser}} {{is composed}} of two lenses a plano-convex lens somewhat larger than a hemisphere and a large bi-convex lens serving as a collecting lens to the first. The focus of the first lens is traditionally about 2mm away from the plane face coinciding with the sample plane. A pinhole cap {{can be used to}} align the optical axis of the condenser with that of the microscope. The <b>Abbe</b> <b>condenser</b> is still the basis for most modern light microscope condenser designs, even though its optical performance is poor.|$|E
5000|$|In 1866, {{he became}} a {{research}} director at the Zeiss Optical Works, and in 1886 he invented the apochromatic lens, a microscope lens which eliminates both the primary and secondary color distortion. By 1870, Abbe invented the <b>Abbe</b> <b>condenser,</b> used for microscope illumination. In 1871, he designed the first refractometer, which he described in a booklet published in 1874. [...] He developed the laws of image of non-luminous objects by 1872. Zeiss Optical Works began selling his improved microscopes in 1872, by 1877 they were selling microscopes with homogenous immersion objective, and in 1886 his apochromatic objective microscopes were being sold. He created the Abbe number, a measure of any transparent material's variation of refractive index with wavelength and Abbe's criterion, which tests the hypothesis, that a systematic trend exists {{in a set of}} observations (in terms of resolving power this criterion stipulates that an angular separation cannot be less than the ratio of the wavelength to the aperture diameter, see angular resolution). Already a professor in Jena, he was hired by Carl Zeiss to improve the manufacturing process of optical instruments, which back then was largely based on trial and error.|$|E
30|$|Light {{microscope}} with <b>Abbe</b> <b>condenser,</b> N.A. of 1.25 and {{adjustable aperture}} (aperture center can be adjusted) was used. Electric components were: input voltage AC 85 – 265  V, 50 / 60  Hz, output voltage DCI. 2 – 6  V. 6  V/ 20  W halogen lamp rotation potentiometer with power switch fuses 2 A 5  ×  20 was used.|$|E
