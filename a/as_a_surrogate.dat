5|$|The {{technique}} of using flashbacks {{had been used}} in earlier films—most notably in The Power and the Glory (1933)—but no film was as immersed in this technique as Citizen Kane. The use of the reporter Thompson acts <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>surrogate</b> for the audience, questioning Kane's associates and piecing together his life.|$|E
5|$|An item of {{discussion}} between the production staff was over who would rescue Rose; Davies and Julie Gardner wanted Pete to rescue her, while Clarke and Phil Collinson wanted Mickey. The role was ultimately given to Pete, to emphasise {{that he had}} accepted Rose <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>surrogate</b> daughter. The Doctor's intended reply to Rose was also discussed; Davies, who left the reply unspecified, stated he didn't know when asked by Collinson on the episode's commentary track, and Gardner vehemently believed the Doctor would reciprocate Rose's love.|$|E
5|$|Christopher {{had three}} more {{children}} with Olivia. As money was now tight, Olivia insisted that her stepchildren {{put to work}} rather than receive schooling. The Colt brothers became attached to their one surviving sister, Sarah Ann, who acted <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>surrogate</b> mother of sorts, until she was sent off to a relative's house {{to work as a}} menial. John was known to keep locks of hair belonging to her and Margaret all through his life.|$|E

5|$|Later, Brunjes {{is found}} murdered and Mulder and Scully watch the shop's {{surveillance}} tape. They {{discover that the}} Golem has features similar to Isaac. Mulder deduces that, because Ariel and Isaac were not officially wed in a Jewish synagogue, Ariel created the Golem out of love to serve <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>surrogate</b> for her late husband. The two agents arrive at the synagogue to find Ariel and the creature exchanging wedding vows. After an intense fight, in which Jacob and Mulder are both wounded, Ariel declares her love for Isaac and returns the creature to dust.|$|E
5|$|Along {{with the}} {{broadcasts}} of the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) and the Voice of America to Central and Eastern Europe, a major propaganda effort begun in 1949 was Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, dedicated to bringing about the peaceful {{demise of the}} communist system in the Eastern Bloc. Radio Free Europe attempted to achieve these goals by serving <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>surrogate</b> home radio station, {{an alternative to the}} controlled and party-dominated domestic press. Radio Free Europe was a product {{of some of the most}} prominent architects of America's early Cold War strategy, especially those who believed that the Cold War would eventually be fought by political rather than military means, such as George F. Kennan.|$|E
5|$|His brother Joseph, who was 24 years older, acted <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>surrogate</b> {{father and}} {{encouraged}} Jefferson in his education. Two years later, Davis entered the Catholic school of Saint Thomas at St. Rose Priory, a school {{operated by the}} Dominican Order in Washington County, Kentucky. At the time, {{he was the only}} Protestant student at the school. In 1818 Davis returned to Mississippi, studying at Jefferson College at Washington. Three years later in 1821, he returned to Kentucky, where he studied at Transylvania University in Lexington. (At the time, these colleges were like academies, roughly equivalent to high schools.) His father Samuel died on July 4, 1824, when Jefferson was 16 years old.|$|E

5|$|Prior to Katherine's words, {{the view}} {{had been for}} Rowe to act <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>surrogate</b> mother; she would give the baby to Jackson as a {{friendly}} favor and he would raise it. Jackson intended to issue a statement following the birth that {{the identity of the}} mother was a secret, {{in the same way that}} the identities of many surrogates are protected. Katherine's involvement, however, influenced Jackson to call Rowe and ask her to meet him in Australia, where he was staying, as soon as she could. There, the entertainer announced his plans for them to wed the next day.|$|E
5|$|As part of {{the first}} {{amendment}} to its articles of agreement in 1969, the IMF developed a new reserve instrument called special drawing rights (SDRs), which could be held by central banks and exchanged among themselves and the Fund as an alternative to gold. SDRs entered service in 1970 originally as units of a market basket of sixteen major vehicle currencies of countries whose share of total world exports exceeded 1%. The basket's composition changed over time and presently consists of the U.S. dollar, euro, Japanese yen, Chinese yuan, and British pound. Beyond holding them as reserves, nations can denominate transactions among themselves and the Fund in SDRs, although the instrument is not a vehicle for trade. In international transactions, the currency basket's portfolio characteristic affords greater stability against the uncertainties inherent with free floating exchange rates. Special drawing rights were originally equivalent to a specified amount of gold, but were not directly redeemable for gold and instead served <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>surrogate</b> in obtaining other currencies that could be exchanged for gold. The Fund initially issued 9.5 billion XDR from 1970 to 1972.|$|E
5|$|Carlos becomes sexually {{involved}} with the Caucasian gay couple, James and Gary, who recently bought Tomas's property and are now his landlords and neighbors, but he eventually begins a secret affair with Gary without James's knowledge. With Magdalena's pregnancy progressing, Carlos offers to financially support her and to act <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>surrogate</b> father for the child once it is born. When James discovers his partner's affair with Carlos he feels betrayed and Tomas soon receives a letter notifying him that his landlords are evicting him. Tomas, Magdalena and Carlos struggle to find an affordable place to live due to the gentrification of the area and the rising real estate prices, but Tomas dies in his sleep shortly before they are due to be evicted. In the aftermath, Magdalena is reunited {{with her mother and}} together they visit a gynecologist, who confirms that Magdalena conceived without having penetrative sex. Magdalena's father apologizes to her at Tomas's funeral, believing her conception to be a miracle, and she forgives him.|$|E

40|$|Human {{creativity}} {{plays an}} important role in the production of many of the media products that permeate our society. However, non-expert creators are often limited by a lack of technical ability, as opposed to creative ability. This is especially true for story authoring. We present an approach to supporting creativity using synthetic audience – an intelligent agent that acts <b>as</b> (<b>a)</b> <b>a</b> <b>surrogate</b> story recipient and (b) critic capable of providing constructive feedback. We describe initial efforts based on computational modeling of cognitive processes and creativity...|$|R
50|$|Code {{points in}} the range U+D800-U+DBFF (1,024 code points) are known as high-surrogate code points, and code {{points in the}} range U+DC00-U+DFFF (1,024 code points) are known as low-surrogate code points. A high-surrogate code point (also known <b>as</b> <b>a</b> leading <b>surrogate)</b> {{followed}} by <b>a</b> low-surrogate code point (also known <b>as</b> <b>a</b> trailing <b>surrogate)</b> together form <b>a</b> <b>surrogate</b> pair used in UTF-16 to represent 1,048,576 code points outside BMP. High and low surrogate code points are not valid by themselves. Thus the range of code points that are available for use as characters is U+0000-U+D7FF and U+E000-U+10FFFF (1,112,064 code points). The value of these code points (i.e., excluding surrogates) is {{sometimes referred to as}} the character's scalar value.|$|R
5|$|In 1990, Wilkinson's wife, Martha, {{announced}} that she would seek the Democratic gubernatorial nomination in 1991. The move was widely seen <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>surrogate</b> candidacy so that her husband could continue his administration for a second consecutive term. Her challengers included Lieutenant Governor Jones, Lexington mayor Scotty Baesler, and Dr. Floyd G. Poore, the former Kentucky highway director. With polls consistently showing little support for her candidacy, Mrs. Wilkinson {{dropped out of the}} race in May 1991. Earlier in the year, Wallace Wilkinson was diagnosed with limited-stage Non-Hodgkin lymphoma. This diagnosis was also a factor in Ms. Wilkinson's withdrawal from the race. Wallace underwent surgery at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota, then received radiation therapy at the University of Kentucky. These treatments eliminated all signs of the disease by 1993, and doctors gave Wilkinson an excellent chance of recovery.|$|E

50|$|However UCS-2, UTF-8, and UTF-32 can encode these code {{points in}} trivial and obvious ways, and {{large amounts of}} {{software}} does so even though the standard states that such arrangements {{should be treated as}} encoding errors. It is possible to unambiguously encode them in UTF-16 by using a code unit equal to the code point, as long as no sequence of two code units can be interpreted <b>as</b> <b>a</b> legal <b>surrogate</b> pair (that is, <b>as</b> long <b>as</b> <b>a</b> high <b>surrogate</b> is never followed by <b>a</b> low <b>surrogate).</b> The majority of UTF-16 encoder and decoder implementations translate between encodings as though this were the case and Windows allows such sequences in filenames.|$|R
50|$|This {{literary}} device {{should not}} be confused with a first-person narrator, <b>an</b> author <b>surrogate,</b> or <b>a</b> character somewhat based on the author, whether the author included it intentionally or not.
