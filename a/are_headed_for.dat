[...] Dr. Wainwright and Ms. Aimes begin {{to track down}} the source of the mysterious occurrences, and quickly {{discover}} that the locusts which ate the grain have grown {{to the size of a}} city bus. The monsters have eaten all the crops in the area, and now are seeking human beings as a means of sustenance. It is also clear that they <b>are</b> <b>headed</b> <b>for</b> the city of Chicago. [...] Wainwright and Aimes meet with General Hanson (Ankrum), Colonel Sturgeon (Henry), and Captain Barton (Seay) to strategize a solution. Machine gun and artillery fire seem ineffective against the creatures, and there are far too many to effectively deal with all at once. [...] The United States Army and Illinois National Guard are called upon to help protect the city. [...] But the monsters quickly invade Chicago, and begin to feast on human flesh as well as several buildings.|$|E
2500|$|Chadian {{rebels were}} {{reported}} to have entered N'Djamena around 07:00 am on Saturday February 2, 2008, coming from Massaguet. The rebels then split into two columns. One was halted 3km from the presidential palace, where government tanks fired at it. The other took control of the eastern parts of the city, and then swung towards the presidential palace, where it too was halted by tank fire. Eyewitnesses reported seeing rebel activity in the south and east of N'Djamena, with fighting later spreading to the area around the presidential palace. Smoke rose from the city, which shook from artillery. One resident of a western embassy told Reuters: [...] "Rebels <b>are</b> <b>headed</b> <b>for</b> the palace and are about two blocks from here. The rebels are winning". The residence of the Saudi ambassador was hit by a bomb during the fighting, which led to the death of the wife and daughter of one of the embassy staff. Rebels in 15 vehicles drove past the Libya Hotel, which overlooks the parliament building, a few hours after the start of the battle. Fighting was reported to have died down by 12:45 pm, with the state radio station going off air around the same time.|$|E
