5|$|In 1874, Jacobus Henricus van 't Hoff and Joseph Achille Le Bel {{independently}} {{proposed that}} the phenomenon of optical activity {{could be explained by}} assuming that the chemical bonds between carbon atoms and their neighbors were directed towards the corners of a regular tetrahedron.

5|$|Species {{recognition}} {{is based on}} combinations of minor structural variations in the shape, aperture, whorl contour, umbilical region, and color pattern.

5|$|According to Mihardja, {{religious}} thinkers {{blasted the}} novel for depicting Hasan, whom they interpreted {{as representative of}} religion and religious people, as unable to overcome temptation; they also disliked the novel's lack of in-depth discussion of religion, necessary for <b>a</b> <b>better</b> <b>understanding</b> of theism. Marxists and anarchists also felt that their ideologies were not well explained. They considered Rusli and Anwar not truly representative of the thoughts of Karl Marx and Friedrich Nietzsche. In response, Mihardja wrote that the characters {{were meant to be}} realistic, and that few people have as much knowledge about an ideology as demanded by the critics.|$|E

5|$|At the 1906 election, Deakin {{remained}} Prime Minister {{even though}} Labour gained considerably more seats than the Protectionists. When Watson resigned in 1907, Fisher succeeded him as Labour leader, although Hughes and William Spence also stood for the position. Fisher {{was considered to}} have <b>a</b> <b>better</b> <b>understanding</b> of economic matters, was better at handling caucus, had better relations with the party organisation and the unions, and was {{more in touch with}} party opinion. He did not share Hughes' passion for free trade or that of Watson and Hughes for defence (and later conscription). In political terms he was a radical, on the left-wing of his party, with a strong sense of Labour's part in British working-class history.|$|E
5|$|For example, Bina Agarwal {{and others}} have critiqued the {{mainstream}} model and helped provide <b>a</b> <b>better</b> <b>understanding</b> of intra-household bargaining power. Agarwal shows {{that a lack of}} power and outside options for women hinders their ability to negotiate within their families. Amartya Sen shows how social norms that devalue women's unpaid work in the household often disadvantage women in intra-household bargaining. These feminist economists argue that such claims have important economic outcomes which must be recognized within economic frameworks.|$|E
5|$|Forest {{fires were}} viewed {{for many decades}} {{as a threat to}} {{protected}} areas such as forests and parks. As <b>a</b> <b>better</b> <b>understanding</b> of fire ecology developed after the 1960s, forest fires were understood to be a natural part of the ecosystem. The earlier policies of suppression resulted in the accumulation of dead and decaying trees and plants, which would normally have been reduced had fires been allowed to burn. Many species of plants and animals actually need wildfires to help replenish the soil with nutrients and to open up areas that allow grasses and smaller plants to thrive.|$|E

5|$|From 1980 on, <b>a</b> <b>better</b> <b>understanding</b> of dinosaur biomechanics, {{and studies}} by palaeontologists Andreas Christian and Holger Preuschoft on the {{resistance}} to bending {{of the back of}} Plateosaurus, led to widespread acceptance of an erect, digitigrade limb posture and a roughly horizontal position of the back. Many researchers were of the opinion that Plateosaurus could use both quadrupedal gaits (for slow speeds) and bipedal gaits (for rapid locomotion), and Wellnhofer insisted that the tail curved strongly downward, making a bipedal posture impossible. However, Moser showed that the tail was in fact straight.|$|E

5|$|The TRACERx {{project is}} looking at how NSCLC {{develops}} and evolves, and how these tumors become resistant to treatment. The project will look at tumor samples from 850 NSCLC patients at various stages including diagnosis, after first treatment, post-treatment, and relapse. By studying samples at different points of tumor development, the researchers hope to identify the changes that drive tumor growth and resistance to treatment. The results of this project will help scientists and doctors gain <b>a</b> <b>better</b> <b>understanding</b> of NSCLC and potentially {{lead to the development}} of new treatments for the disease.|$|E

5|$|Thus Meher Baba {{offers many}} {{suggestions}} that keep one moving towards God-realization. These suggestions include putting theory into practice, the internal renunciation of desires, offering selfless service to humanity or the master, spontaneity, while avoiding actions that bind one to illusion. But rather than lay out moral rules, Baba offers an understanding {{as to why}} some actions bind the individual whereas some others help towards his emancipation. Many chapters offer <b>a</b> <b>better</b> <b>understanding</b> of the mechanisms by which consciousness gets caught up between the opposites of experience, such as pleasure and pain, good and evil, and point to a way of transcending them.|$|E
25|$|The {{majority}} of Oriental carpets, however, {{continue to be}} depicted as objects with visual appeal, without political connotations, but ignoring their original cultural context.
