5|$|Though Caravan had yet {{to achieve}} strong {{commercial}} success in 1970, they had started to build a live following, including an appearance at the Kralingen Pop Festival in the Netherlands {{to an audience of}} 250,000 and the 10th Plumpton Festival. In between touring, the group had written several new pieces that they wanted to record. Having had problems self-producing the previous album, If I Could Do It All Over Again, I'd Do It <b>All</b> <b>Over</b> <b>You,</b> the group decided to collaborate with producer David Hitchcock. Hitchcock had become a fan of the band and had been a key figure in getting them signed to Decca Records. He had progressed from the label's art department to production and was keen to work on the album. The group had been apprehensive about Hitchcock working on If I Could Do It All Over Again... but after discovering his enthusiasm and creative ideas, decided {{it would be a good}} idea to enrol him as producer.|$|E

2500|$|Asahifuji has {{remained}} in the sumo world as a coach. He had married a niece of the former Kasugayama-oyakata (former maegashira Ōnobori) in 1988, and seemed set to revive Kasugayama stable, but instead {{he took over the}} Ajigawa stable in 1993 due to the poor health of the previous incumbent (former sekiwake Mutsuarashi). The first top division wrestler he produced was Aminishiki in 2000, who reached the sekiwake rank in 2007. Aminishiki's brother Asōfuji, now retired, was also a briefly a top division wrestler. Asahifuji's greatest success has come with Harumafuji (formerly known as Ama), who reached the second highest rank of ōzeki in November 2008 and won his first top division championship in May 2009. Harumafuji took his second championship in July 2011, the same tournament in which Takarafuji, like Asahifuji a Kinki University graduate, made his top division debut. Homarefuji reached jūryō in 2012, and in September of that year Harumafuji was promoted to yokozuna following two consecutive 15–0 championships. He had motivated Harumafuji by telling him before his July 2011 championship, [...] "If you are content with being ozeki then it is <b>all</b> <b>over.</b> <b>You</b> do not become a yokozuna just by wanting to be a yokozuna." [...] Like Asahifuji, Harumafuji performs the yokozuna ring entering ceremony or dohyō-iri in the Shiranui style. He has continued to produce top wrestlers, with Takarafuji reaching komusubi rank and Terunofuji, inherited from the defunct Magaki stable, being promoted to ōzeki, both in 2015.|$|E
