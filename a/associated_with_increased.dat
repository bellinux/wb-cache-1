40|$|AbstractCyclosporine A (CSA) {{is a type}} 2 B {{phosphatase}} inhibitor {{which can}} induce contraction of renal artery smooth muscle. In this investigation, we examined the phosphorylation events <b>associated</b> <b>with</b> CSA-induced contraction of bovine renal artery smooth muscle. Contractile responses were determined in a muscle bath and the corresponding phosphorylation events were determined with whole cell phosphorylation and two-dimensional gel electrophoresis. CSA-induced contractions were <b>associated</b> <b>with</b> <b>increases</b> in the phosphorylation of the 20 kDa myosin light chains (MLC 20) and different isoforms of the small heat shock protein, HSP 27. Cyclic nucleotide-dependent relaxation of CSA-induced contractions was <b>associated</b> <b>with</b> <b>increases</b> in the phosphorylation of another small heat shock protein, HSP 20, and decreases in the phosphorylation of the MLC 20, and some isoforms of HSP 27.

5|$|Benzodiazepines are {{generally}} viewed as {{safe and effective}} for short-term use, although cognitive impairment and paradoxical effects such as aggression or behavioral disinhibition occasionally occur. A minority of people can have paradoxical reactions such as worsened agitation or panic. Benzodiazepines are also <b>associated</b> <b>with</b> <b>increased</b> risk of suicide. Long-term use is controversial {{because of concerns about}} adverse psychological and physical effects, decreasing effectiveness, and physical dependence and withdrawal. As a result of adverse effects associated with the long-term use of benzodiazepines, withdrawal from benzodiazepines often leads to improved physical and mental health. The elderly are at an increased risk of suffering from both short- and long-term adverse effects, and as a result, all benzodiazepines are listed in the Beers List of inappropriate medications for older adults.|$|E

5|$|On October11, 2015, {{an area of}} {{disturbed}} weather traversed Central America {{and emerged}} over the eastern Pacific Ocean. The disturbance moved slowly {{over the next few}} days, and coalesced into a Central American gyre—a broad monsoonal circulation. A tropical wave crossed the Caribbean Sea and eventually reached Central America on October15; the two systems merged the following day near the Gulf of Tehuantepec. A concurrent Tehuantepec gap wind event on the western side of the gyre, complimented by anticyclonic flow behind a cold front, enhanced vorticity and spurred the formation of an elongated area of low pressure on October17. The broad system spanned several hundred miles from the Yucatán Peninsula into the eastern Pacific. A large, disorganized area of convection—showers and thunderstorms—accompanied the system, increasing in coverage substantially throughout the day. A strong pulse in the Madden–Julian oscillation—a propagating climate pattern <b>associated</b> <b>with</b> <b>increased</b> tropical cyclogenesis—may have aided in creating favorable conditions for further development.|$|E
5|$|Silencing systemin did {{not affect}} the ability of black {{nightshade}} to resist herbivory and, when competing against normal plants, silenced plants produced more above-ground biomass and berries. Upon herbivory, systemin was down-regulated in black nightshade in contrast to the other peptides which are up-regulated after herbivory. By contrast HypSys were up-regulated and activated the synthesis of protease inhibitors. The down-regulation of systemin was <b>associated</b> <b>with</b> <b>increased</b> root mass but did not decrease shoot mass, demonstrating that systemin can cause developmental changes as a result of herbivory, allowing the plant to tolerate, rather than directly resist attack. Tomato roots were also affected by tomato systemin, with root growth increasing at high tomato systemin concentrations. By allocating more resources to the roots, plants under attack are thought to store carbon and then use it to re-grow when the attack ends. Overexpressing AtPEP1 also increased root and shoot biomass in A. thaliana.|$|E

40|$|Objective: To {{evaluate}} {{the association between}} socioeconomic factors and suicide rates. Methods: Analysis of time series of suicide rates, gross domestic product, unemployment rates, labor force participation, and divorce rates of 18 countries are analyzed by the application of panel-vector error correction models. Main outcome measures are the association between the socioeconomic factors and suicide rates. Results: Decreasing economic growth and increasing divorce rates are significantly <b>associated</b> <b>with</b> <b>increasing</b> suicide rates in men. For women, increasing economic growth, increasing unemployment, and increasing divorce rates are significantly <b>associated</b> <b>with</b> <b>increasing</b> suicides.

However, this relationship differs by sex. The current results provide a strong argument that suicide prevention strategies must include the monitoring of socioeconomic development.
