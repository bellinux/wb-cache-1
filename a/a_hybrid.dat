40|$|Two sets {{of about}} 50 diverse variety-cross {{progenies}} each were crossed onto 5141 A and 8 IA, a d, dwarf male-sterile line of pearl millet [Pennisetum americanum (L.) Leeke]. Results from yield trials {{showed that the}} 81 <b>A</b> <b>hybrids</b> yielded significantly more than the 5141 <b>A</b> <b>hybrids.</b> There were indications that pollen parents of high yielding 5141 <b>A</b> <b>hybrids</b> will also produce high yielding hybrids when crossed onto 81 A. Relatively longer heads, larger seeds and perhaps more head girth of the 81 <b>A</b> <b>hybrids,</b> which matured 2 – 4 days later, contributed to their yield superiority over the 5141 <b>A</b> <b>hybrids</b> which, however, had more tillers. Although 81 A is shorter than 5141 <b>A,</b> <b>hybrids</b> on 81 <b>A</b> were significantly taller {{but there was no}} increase in lodging since the 81 <b>A</b> <b>hybrids</b> have stronger stems than the 5141 <b>A</b> <b>hybrids.</b> The <b>hybrids</b> on 81 <b>A</b> also showed higher grain protein content than those on 5 I 41 A.

5|$|A.× cunninghamii (Albany Woollybush), <b>a</b> <b>hybrid</b> between A.cuneatus and A.sericeus, {{was first}} {{collected}} in 1827, and published as A.cunninghamii in 1845. Other than some dubious collections in the 1830s and 1840s, no further sightings {{are known to}} have been made until 1973, when Nelson rediscovered it. At the time it was regarded as a distinct species, but by 1995 it was thought to be <b>a</b> <b>hybrid,</b> and this was confirmed by genetic analysis in 2002. In appearance it is very similar to A.sericeus, but its leaf segments are flat rather than cylindrical.|$|E
5|$|In biology, <b>a</b> <b>hybrid,</b> or crossbreed, is {{the result}} of {{combining}} the qualities of two organisms of different breeds, varieties, species or genera through sexual reproduction. Hybrids are not always intermediates between their parents (such as in blending inheritance), but can show hybrid vigour, often growing larger or taller than either parent. The concept of <b>a</b> <b>hybrid</b> is interpreted differently in animal and plant breeding, where there is interest in the individual parentage. In genetics, attention is focused on the numbers of chromosomes. In taxonomy, a key question is how closely related the parent species are.|$|E

In 1955, Wood noted that D. anglica had a chromosome count of 2n=40, and hypothesized {{that it was}} of hybrid amphidiploid origin. Since the leaf morphology of D. anglica is an intermediary between that of D. rotundifolia and D. linearis and the two occur sympatrically in several locations, Wood conjectured that D. anglica likely originated from <b>a</b> <b>hybrid</b> between these two.|$|E
