5|$|Arranging a sleep {{environment}} that is quiet, very dark, and cool is recommended. Noises, light, and uncomfortable temperatures {{have been shown to}} disrupt continuous sleep. Other recommendations that are frequently made, though less studied, include selecting comfortable mattresses, bedding, and pillows, <b>and</b> <b>eliminating</b> a visible bedroom clock, to prevent focusing on time passing when trying to fall asleep.|$|E
5|$|Benfica's {{season began}} inauspiciously but they quickly recovered, gaining {{momentum}} domestically <b>and</b> <b>eliminating</b> Napoli {{to qualify for}} the group stage of the UEFA Cup.

5|$|He {{also promised}} to seek income tax law changes {{that he said}} would help to lower federal deficits and would stimulate {{economic}} growth. These included: reducing individual income tax rates across the board by 20percent, maintaining the Bush administration-era tax rate of 15percent on investment income from dividends and capital gains (<b>and</b> <b>eliminating</b> this tax entirely for those with annual incomes less than $200,000), cutting the top tax rate on corporations from 35 to 25percent, <b>and</b> <b>eliminating</b> the estate tax and the Alternative Minimum Tax. He promised {{that the loss of}} government revenue from these tax cuts would be offset by closing loopholes and placing limits on tax deductions and credits available to taxpayers with the highest incomes, but said that that aspect of the plan could not yet be evaluated because details would have to be worked out with Congress.|$|E
5|$|In August 2012, Bean {{appeared}} as cross-dressing teacher Simon {{in the opening}} episode of the second season of UK television series Accused, a role which would earn him a Royal Television Society best actor award.

5|$|During the 20s, Sejanus {{gradually}} accumulated {{power by}} consolidating his influence over Tiberius <b>and</b> <b>eliminating</b> potential political opponents, including the emperor's son Drusus Julius Caesar. When Tiberius withdrew to Capri in AD 26, Sejanus {{was left in}} control of the administration of the empire. For a time the most influential and feared citizen of Rome, Sejanus suddenly fell from power in AD 31, the year his career culminated with the consulship. Amidst suspicions of conspiracy against Tiberius, Sejanus was arrested and executed, along with his followers.|$|E
5|$|From {{time to time}} special {{seasonal}} {{festivals and}} events are held. They last only for a set {{period of time and}} offer a variety of fun or useful rewards. Many events have changed over time, adding new features <b>and</b> <b>eliminating</b> old ones. These events are geared towards any level, often restricting players to level 1, so that veterans and novice players alike can join in together. Events celebrated are often thematically based on real life equivalents, for example: Valentione's Day in place of Valentine's Day, the Egg Hunt Egg-stravaganza in place of Easter, and the Starlight Celebration in place of Christmas.|$|E
5|$|I think {{a strong}} {{case can be made}} that {{political}} assassination actually does change things. If you look at the assassinations in this country in the 1960s you can certainly see how it affected history in a very profound way. So if you killed right wing figures, you'd also be altering the course of history, <b>and</b> <b>eliminating</b> people who might very well be president in 1996 and those who are making bashing gays their number one issue right now. On the one hand, I'm not advocating PWA's turn themselves into human bombs, {{but on the other hand}} I have to admit that if I clicked on CNN and heard somebody had blown Patrick Buchanan's head clean off, I'd be elated, and to say otherwise would be a lie.|$|E

5|$|In 1819, MÃ¤lzel {{took the}} Turk {{on a tour}} of the United Kingdom. There were several new {{developments}} in the act, such as allowing the opponent the first move <b>and</b> <b>eliminating</b> the king's bishop's pawn from the Turk's pieces. This pawn handicap created further interest in the Turk, and spawned a book by W. J. Hunneman chronicling the matches played with this handicap. Despite the handicap, the Turk (operated by Mouret at the time) ended up with forty-five victories, three losses, and two stalemates.|$|E
5|$|In December 2007 Pacific National {{announced}} plans to sell or close its grain transport and Portlink rural container business operations in Victoria. The decision has been criticised as it will force grain growers to use higher cost road transport to transport the annual grain harvest from rural silos to the ports. The decision has seen many commentators accuse Pacific National of only acquiring the operations of Freight Australia in 2004 {{for the purposes of}} asset stripping <b>and</b> <b>eliminating</b> competition in rail freight. In 2008 El Zorro took over the Warrnambool - Melbourne container service from Pacific National, and moved into broad gauge grain services, while Aurizon has taken over the Melbourne - Horsham container service.|$|E
5|$|In {{spite of}} the earlier rupture in their relations, Maxentius was eager to present himself as his father's devoted son after his death. He began minting coins with his father's deified image, proclaiming his desire to avenge Maximian's death. Constantine {{initially}} presented the suicide as an unfortunate family tragedy. By 311AD, however, he was spreading another version. According to this, after Constantine had pardoned him, Maximian planned to murder Constantine in his sleep. Fausta learned of the plot and warned Constantine, who put a eunuch in his own place in bed. Maximian was apprehended when he killed the eunuch and was offered suicide, which he accepted. Along with using propaganda, Constantine instituted a damnatio memoriae on Maximian, destroying all inscriptions referring to him <b>and</b> <b>eliminating</b> any public work bearing his image.|$|E

5|$|Mad Maxs {{landscape}} {{consists of}} canyons, caves, deserts, and abandoned wastelands. The game's world {{is divided into}} several regions, with each having its own backstory and landscape. Unique landmarks and ruins can be discovered in each region. Side activities such as races, time trials, invading enemy fortresses, <b>and</b> <b>eliminating</b> enemy convoys {{can be found in}} each region. A region's threat level is lowered by completing these activities, facilitating its navigation. Each region has a boss, who can be found and defeated in their base. Some of the game's strongholds are friendly, <b>and</b> <b>eliminating</b> hostile strongholds gives Max additional quests and rewards. These strongholds can be upgraded, offering Max different benefits such as helping Max to collect scraps when the game is turned off, or restoring Max's health and shotgun ammo upon visits. Max can ascend in a hot-air balloon (permanently attached to the ground) to look for new objectives and locations. After seeing the objectives through binoculars, they are highlighted on the map. Max can be guided by Chumbucket in strategically completing his objectives. Max is accompanied by a dog companion called Dinki-Di, who can help players detect land mines. Max has limited climbing abilities, and objects that he can climb are highlighted in yellow.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Jazz, Sideswipe and Cliffjumper track Grimlock's {{signature}} to the Sea of Rust {{to locate}} {{him and his}} Lightning Strike Coalition Force composed of Slug, Sludge, Snarl and Swoop. After exploring the area <b>and</b> <b>eliminating</b> dozens of Decepticons, Jazz and Cliffjumper find Sludge's dead body and an enormous tower in a lake of Energon firing a bright beam into Cybertron's orbit. They find the Decepticon scientist Shockwave at the scene and discover it is a Space Bridge. Shockwave escapes the ensuing confrontation, and Cliffjumper becomes trapped, leaving Jazz to fight off the incoming Insecticon swarm. Cliffjumper overloads the tower, and he and Jazz are saved from the Tower's explosion by Sideswipe. They report back to Optimus, Ironhide, Ratchet and Perceptor.|$|E
5|$|On 2 April, the Japanese divisional commander, Akanaga, {{called the}} 13th and 23rd Infantry Regiments {{back across the}} Puriata, to a {{position}} south-west of the Pain feature. At this point, {{the decision was made}} to launch a fresh attack aimed at taking Slater's Knoll <b>and</b> <b>eliminating</b> the Australian forces in the area surrounding the Puriata ford. The attack was scheduled for 5 April, and over the course of the following three days, contact was minimal. In this time, there were a few minor skirmishes, and small groups of Japanese were seen by the Australians around Barara, Slater's Knoll and Mosigetta. As further intelligence reports came in, it became clear to the Australian commanders that the Japanese were about to deliver the main attack.|$|E

5|$|The Commandos {{were divided}} into three groups: One and Two would travel in the MLs, while Three would be in Campbeltown. Under the command of Captain Hodgeson, Group One had the {{objectives}} of securing the Old Mole <b>and</b> <b>eliminating</b> the anti-aircraft gun positions around the southern quays. They were then {{to move into the}} old town and blow up the power station, bridges and locks for the new entrance into the basin from the Avant port. The capture of the mole was a major objective, as it was to be the embarkation point for the evacuation after the mission.|$|E
5|$|The Underground State's {{military}} arm, Armia Krajowa, officially disbanded on 19 January 1945 {{to avoid}} armed {{conflict with the}} Soviets and a civil war. Over {{the next few years}} the communists solidified their hold on Poland, falsifying elections, persecuting the opposition <b>and</b> <b>eliminating</b> it as a political power. Remnants of the armed resistance (NIE, Armed Forces Delegation for Poland, Freedom and Independence) that refused to lay down their weapons and surrender to the communist regime continued to hold out for several years as the cursed soldiers, fighting the Soviet-backed communist forces until eradicated.|$|E
5|$|The basic {{gameplay}} {{mechanics of}} the original game remain the same. The player controls an empire {{with the goal of}} conquering as much territory as possible <b>and</b> <b>eliminating</b> rival factions, which are controlled by the computer, or AI. The main campaign is split between two gameplay modes: a turn-based strategy map for moving whole armies and managing the empire, and a real-time battle map for fighting battles on the ground between two or more armies. The two game modes are linked, with success or failure in one game mode influencing the chances of success or failure in the other.|$|E
