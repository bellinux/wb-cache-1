Ramachandra Rao, the district collector for Nellore {{and the secretary of}} the Indian Mathematical Society. Rao was impressed by Ramanujan's research but doubted that it was his own work. Ramanujan mentioned a correspondence he had with Professor Saldhana, a notable Bombay mathematician, in which Saldhana expressed a lack of understanding of his work but concluded that he was not <b>a</b> <b>phony.</b> Ramanujan's friend C. V. Rajagopalachari tried to quell Rao's doubts about Ramanujan's academic integrity. Rao agreed to give him another chance, and listened as Ramanujan discussed elliptic integrals, hypergeometric series, and his theory of divergent series, which Rao said ultimately converted him to a belief in Ramanujan's brilliance. When Rao asked him what he wanted, Ramanujan replied that he needed work and financial support. Rao consented and sent him to Madras. He continued his research, with Rao's financial aid taking care of his daily needs. With Aiyer's help, Ramanujan had his work published in the Journal of the Indian Mathematical Society.|$|E

25|$|Soon {{after the}} break-in, Nixon's team (chiefly Haldeman, Ehrlichman, and Dean) asked Helms in effect to assert <b>a</b> <b>phony</b> {{national}} security {{reason for the}} break-in and, under that rationale, {{to interfere with the}} ongoing FBI investigation of the Watergate burglaries. Such a course would also involve the CIA in posting bail for the arrested suspects. Initially Helms made some superficial accommodation that stalled for several weeks the FBI's progress. At several meetings attended by Helms and Walters, Nixon's team referred to the Cuban Bay of Pigs fiasco, using it as if a talisman of dark secrets, as an implied threat against the integrity of CIA. Immediately, sharply, Helms turned aside this gambit.|$|E
25|$|The Federal Bureau of Investigation {{investigated}} Brown {{when he was}} Speaker. One {{investigation was}} a sting operation concerning a fake fish company attempting to bribe Brown; he was not charged with any criminal act. The FBI further investigated Brown from 1998 to 2003 over his appointees at the Airport Commission for potential conflicts of interests. Brown friend, contributor, and former law client, Charlie Walker was given a share of city contracts. He had served jail time in 1984 for violating laws concerning minority contracting. The FBI also investigated Brown's approval of expansion of Sutro Tower and SFO.

500|$|During the Republican presidential {{primaries}} of 2016, {{opponents of}} Trump's candidacy used Trump University to criticize him. Mitt Romney said in early March: [...] "Donald Trump is <b>a</b> <b>phony,</b> a fraud. His promises are as worthless as {{a degree from}} Trump University." [...] Senators Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio raised the subject during televised debates in February and March. One debate moderator, Megyn Kelly of Fox News, pursued the issue at length.

The manuscript, dated 1846, was said to have been written by the English poet Richard Horne, who shares Horse's birth name.

According to Horse, Halpke believed the Ark of the Covenant was a nuclear device, and that humans and pigs share compatible genes.|$|E

Grunge bands gave enthusiastic performances; they would thrash their long hair during shows as [...] "a symbolic weapon" [...] for releasing [...] "pent-up aggression" [...] (Dave Grohl was particularly noted for his [...] "head flips"). One of the philosophies of the grunge scene was authenticity. Dave Rimmer writes that with the revival of punk ideals of stripped-down music in the early 1990s, [...] "for Cobain, and lots of kids like him, rock & roll...threw down a dare: Can you be pure enough, day after day, year after year, to prove your authenticity, {{to live up to the}} music ...

500|$|The campaign's {{strategy}} {{called for}} winning the initial two contestsâ the January 3, 2008, Iowa Republican caucuses and the adjacent-to-his-home-state January 8 New Hampshire primaryâ and propelling Romney nationally. However, he took second place in both, losing Iowa to a vastly outspent Huckabee who received {{more than twice the}} evangelical Christian votes, and losing New Hampshire to the resurgent McCain. Huckabee and McCain criticized Romney's image as a flip flopper and this label would stick to Romney through the campaign (one that Romney rejected as unfair and inaccurate, except for his acknowledged change of mind on abortion). Romney seemed to approach the campaign as a management consulting exercise, and showed a lack of personal warmth and political feel; journalist Evan Thomas wrote that Romney [...] "came off as <b>a</b> <b>phony,</b> even when he was perfectly sincere." [...] The fervor with which Romney adopted his new stances and attitudes contributed to the perception of inauthenticity that hampered the campaign. Romney's staff would conclude that competing as a candidate of social conservatism and ideological purity rather than of pragmatic competence had been a mistake.|$|E

Using a sketch created with the assistance of Eldon Elliot, owner of the agency, the agents were able to implicate McVeigh in the bombing. McVeigh was also identified by Lea McGown of the Dreamland Motel, who remembered him parking a large yellow Ryder truck in the lot; McVeigh had signed in under his real name at the motel, using an address that matched the one on his forged license and the charge sheet at the Perry Police Station. Before signing his real name at the motel, McVeigh had used false names for his transactions. However, McGown noted, [...] "People are so used to signing their own name that when they go to sign <b>a</b> <b>phony</b> name, they almost always go to write, and then look up for a moment as if to remember the new name they want to use.

[...] In retrospect, Flanders {{felt that he had}} allowed his campaign advisers to make too many of the decisions. [...] For example, a campaign brochure showed the candidate wearing a three-piece suit and holding a piglet in his arms. Although he had grown up on a subsistence farm and had an active interest in Vermont agricultureâespecially in the type of hog shown in the pictureâthis had the effect of making him appear to be <b>a</b> <b>phony.</b> The Rutland Herald observed that, âIn Vermont in 1940, pigs were common to many households. But so was common sense. There were many people, most in fact, who did not want as their representative someone who would wear his best clothes if he intended to be handling pigs.â Aiken won by 7,000 votes, having spent $3,219.50 to Flandersâs $18,698.45.

Unsure of what the next project should be, Forman recalled an experience he'd had driving around Prague late one evening when he'd encountered a young woman struggling to cross a bridge while carrying a heavy suitcase.

[...] After confirming that she had been duped, Forman interviewed the girl for {{much of the rest of}} the night, before putting her on a train back to her home town. Commentators have noted that Forman was particularly sensitized to such situations because when he was 10, his mother had been taken away by the Gestapo, never to be seen again, which led to years of Forman traveling around searching for security with nothing but a suitcase.

500|$|At 13:30 on 1 November, Generals DÆ°Æ¡ng VÄn Minh and Tráº§n VÄn ÄÃ´n, {{respectively}} the Presidential Military Adviser and Army Chief of Staff, led a coup against Diá»m, assisted by mutinous ARVN officers. [...] The rebels had carefully devised plans to neutralise loyalist officers {{to prevent them}} from saving Diá»m. Unknown to Diá»m, General ÄÃ­nh, the supposed loyalist who commanded the ARVN III Corps that surrounded the Saigon area, had allied himself with the plotters of the coup. The second of Diá»m's most trusted loyalist generals was Huá»³nh VÄn Cao, who commanded the IV Corps in the Mekong Delta. Diá»m and Nhu were aware of the coup plan, and Nhu responded by planning a counter-coup, which he called Operation Bravo. This plan involved ÄÃ­nh and Colonel Tung, the loyalist commander of the Special Forces, staging <b>a</b> <b>phony</b> rebellion before their forces crushed the [...] "uprising" [...] to reaffirm the power of the NgÃ´ family. Unaware that ÄÃ­nh was plotting against him, Nhu allowed ÄÃ­nh to organise troops as he saw fit, and ÄÃ­nh transferred the command of the Seventh Division from Cao's IV Corps to his own III Corps. This allowed Colonel Nguyá»n Há»¯u CÃ³, ÄÃ­nh's deputy, to take command of the 7th Division based at Má»¹ Tho. The transfer allowed the rebels to completely encircle the capital and denied Cao the opportunity of storming Saigon and protecting Diá»m, as he had done during the previous coup attempt in 1960. Minh and ÄÃ´n had invited senior Saigon based officers to a meeting at TÃ¢n SÆ¡n Nhá»©t Air Base, headquarters of the Joint General Staff (JGS), on the pretext of routine business. Instead, they announced that a coup was underway, with only a few, including Tung, refusing to join. Tung was later forced at gunpoint to order his loyalist Special Forces to surrender. The coup went smoothly as the rebels quickly captured all key installations in Saigon and sealed incoming roads to prevent loyalist forces from entering. This left only the Presidential Guard to defend Gia Long Palace. The rebels attacked government and loyalist army buildings but delayed the attack on the palace, hoping that Diá»m would resign and accept the offer of safe passage and exile. Diá»m refused, vowing to reassert his control. After sunset, the 7th Division of Colonel Nguyá»n VÄn Thiá»u, who later became the nation's president, led an assault on Gia Long Palace and it fell by daybreak.|$|E
