5|$|In a 2016 {{oral history}} of South Park in The Hollywood Reporter, Vernon Chatman, {{the voice of}} Towelie {{as well as a}} writer and {{producer}} on the show said that after Comedy Central censored the episode, series co-creator Trey Parker purchased a ticket to South Africa and showed it {{to the head of the}} network as a threat because Dave Chappelle had fled to Africa, though Parker never <b>actually</b> <b>went.</b>|$|E

5|$|Shortly {{after the}} ship began its homeward voyage Christian and his discontented {{followers}} seized Bligh and {{took control of}} the vessel. Bligh and 18 loyalists were set adrift in an open boat; Heywood was among those who remained with Bounty. Later, he and 15 others left the ship and settled in Tahiti, while Bounty sailed on, ending its voyage at Pitcairn Island. Bligh, after an epic open-boat journey, eventually reached England, where he implicated Heywood as one of the mutiny's prime instigators. In 1791 Heywood and his companions were met with in Tahiti by the search vessel , and held in irons for transportation to England. Heywood and one other <b>actually</b> <b>went</b> out to the Pandora in canoes , very happy to be rescued-as they thought. They were then arrested and treated barbarously by the Captain, Edward Edwards, who had them and 12 others fettered and handcuffed in an 11 ft. box built for the purpose on deck. Their subsequent journey was prolonged and eventful; Pandora was wrecked on the Great Barrier Reef, four of Heywood's fellow prisoners were drowned, and Heywood himself was fortunate to survive, being the 3rd last {{to get out of the}} box, which had only an exit 18 inches sq. in the roof..|$|E

25|$|During Slocum's 14 {{years as}} head coach, the Aggies {{compiled}} {{a record of}} 123–47–2, making Slocum the winningest coach in Texas A history. During his career, Slocum never had a losing season and won four conference championships, including the Big 12 (the Southwest Conference was renamed in 1996) title in 1998 and two Big 12 South Championships, 1997 1998. Additionally, he led the Aggies {{to become the first}} school in the Southwest Conference history to post three consecutive perfect conference seasons and <b>actually</b> <b>went</b> four consecutive seasons without a conference loss. Slocum reached 100 wins faster than any other active coach.|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} days of the war, enthusiasm for the Southern cause was high, and many ship owners responded to the appeal by {{applying}} for letters of marque. Not all of those who gained authorization <b>actually</b> <b>went</b> to sea, but the numbers of privateers were high enough to be a major concern for US Secretary of the Navy Gideon Welles. Many ships of the Union Navy were diverted from blockade duty in efforts to capture privateers. Most of the privateers managed to remain free, but enough were caught that the owners and crew had to consider the risk seriously. The capture of the privateers Savannah and Jefferson Davis resulted in important court cases that did much to define the nature of the Civil War itself.|$|E
25|$|Rogues Gallery, {{an album}} heavy on synthesizer, was {{released}} in the UK during March, and in America during May. Reported {{to be one of}} the band's most polished productions, the band aimed to produce an album where all tracks were potential hit singles. Despite receiving critical acclaim in both Europe and America, Slade were unable to retain their new-found American audience or rekindled British following, and the album failed to live up to commercial expectations, causing the band to largely fade from sight once more. In the UK, the album reached number 60, whilst in America it made number 132. The album was a big hit in Norway, peaking at number 5. It also charted in other European countries. Tour dates in the UK to support the album were announced and tickets <b>actually</b> <b>went</b> on sale. Once again, Holder was unwilling to tour and the dates were shelved.|$|E

25|$|Nationwide, Ivo Josipović {{achieved}} 1,339,385 votes, or 60.26%, while Milan Bandić won 883,222 votes, or 39.74%. Most polls {{before the}} election were showing Josipović with a hefty double-digit lead, but never as much as 20 percentage points as he achieved during the election. The {{difference between the two}} candidates came as a surprise to many pundits and analysts for two reasons: the polls usually favor the more liberal candidate since left-leaning voters tend to participate in opinion polls more than conservative voters; and the fact that most polls {{before the election}} didn't include the votes from the citizens living abroad, which was expected to be a strong boost for Bandić come Election Day. Nevertheless, the final result is similar to the result of the last several polls when only the certain voters were taken into account, which may indicate that few undecided voters <b>actually</b> <b>went</b> to the polls in the second round.|$|E
25|$|In a {{press conference}} November 5, 2006, Chen rebutted the charges against his wife and members of his Presidential office. He said that Taiwan {{government}} offices advised him to prepare the receipts in such a fashion, and that {{after six years of}} doing so, it is strange that they would never mention an irregularity if it was not the right way to do it. He promised that all of the money <b>actually</b> <b>went</b> to diplomatic missions and did not go into any private pockets. Furthermore, he mentioned that when he took office, he thought his salary was so excessive that he cut his own salary in half, and that reduction is more than the amount he is accused of embezzling, so {{there is no need for}} him to take that money. In addition, he said that if the charges against his wife were proven in a court of law just as they were charged, then he would at that time step down as President of the Republic of China.|$|E
25|$|She {{intended}} the final corrida of the 1949 season, in Jaén, Spain, {{to be the}} last of her career. She appeared in the ring together with the matadors Manolo Vázquez and Antonio Ordóñez. After performing on horseback with the bull, Cintrón rode to the box of the presidente and asked for permission to dismount for the kill. Permission was denied. This was her signal to leave the arena, and leave the killing of the bull to the novillero assigned to her for that task. Instead, she dismounted, grabbed his sword and muleta, caped the bull and prepared it for the kill. She <b>actually</b> <b>went</b> in for the kill and then dramatically let the sword drop to the sand. The bull charged. Cintrón stepped from his path and simulated the kill by touching his shoulders with her fingers as he rushed by. Pandemonium erupted in the stands and the audience threw hats and red carnations at her feet. The novillero then entered the ring and performed the kill, as originally planned.|$|E

25|$|Funding {{from federal}} and private sources for {{research}} at MSU was $109.5 {{million in the}} 2009-2010 school year (Cruzado's first year on campus, reflecting grants awarded during her predecessor's tenure). It fell to $102.7 million in the 2010-2011 school year. This included a five-year, $3.85 million grant from the National Science Foundation to study fire and climate change in forests in Australia, New Zealand, and the United Statets. The grant was shared with the University of Colorado, the University of Idaho, and the United States Forest Service, and it was unclear how much money <b>actually</b> <b>went</b> to MSU. It also included a $1.6 million grant from the United States Department of Energy to study ways to store carbon dioxide underground, a grant the university had been working to obtain from Congress for several years. Another award was a four-year, $1.2 million grant from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute. The grant paid for integration of biomedical science into the undergraduate curriculum and paid for undergraduate biomedical research. It also paid for science and technology outreach to {{elementary and middle school}} Native Americans, and for scholarships to bring Native American students to MSU and expose them to science and technology courses. It was the third time MSU received the grant.|$|E
25|$|Meanwhile, the North-South Axis {{would have}} cut a giant swathe passing {{just to the}} west of Potsdamer Platz, some 5km long and up to 100 m wide, and lined with Nazi {{government}} edifices on a gargantuan scale. The eastern half of the former Millionaires' Quarter, including Stüler's Matthiaskirche, would have been totally eradicated. New U-Bahn and S-Bahn lines were planned to run directly beneath almost the whole length of the axis, and the city's entire underground network reoriented to gravitate towards this new hub (at least one tunnel section, around 220 metres in length, was actually constructed and still exists today, buried some 20 metres beneath the Tiergarten, despite having never seen a train). This was in addition to the S-Bahn North-South Link beneath Potsdamer Platz itself, which went forward to completion, opening in stages in 1939. In the event, a substantial amount of demolition did take place in Potsdamer Straße, between the platz itself and the Landwehrkanal, and this became the location of the one Germania building that <b>actually</b> <b>went</b> forward to a state of virtual completion: architect Theodor Dierksmeier's Haus des Fremdenverkehrs (House of Tourism), basically a giant state-run travel agency. More significantly, its curving eastern facade marked the beginnings of the Runden Platz (Round Platz), a huge circular public space {{at the point where the}} North-South Axis and Potsdamer Straße intersected. Additionally, the southern edge of the Tiergarten was to be redefined, with a new road planned to slice through the built-up area immediately to the north of Columbushaus (although Columbushaus itself would remain unscathed); this road would line up with Voßstraße, one block to the north of Leipziger Platz. Here Albert Speer erected Hitler's enormous new Reichskanzlei building, and yet even this was little more than a dry run for an even larger structure some distance further away.|$|E
25|$|In 1818 the Pemmican War trials commenced. Several years {{previous}} in 1803, the British government passed “An act for {{extending the}} jurisdiction of the courts of justice in the provinces of Lower Canada and Upper Canada” which gave the Canadian courts jurisdiction in the Indian Territories. However, rather than have the Pemmican War trials take place in Quebec or York, the seats of Upper and Lower Canada, Montreal was chosen because many of the fur traders resided there and many of the residents were already familiar with the methods of the fur trade. Selkirk wrote to the Colonial Department in an attempt to have the trials moved to England where he had more influence, and because it was impossible to find an impartial jury in Montreal, it being so intimately connected with the NWC, but the government claimed {{that they did not have}} jurisdiction, as the disputes were between commercial bodies. The total charges incurred during the Pemmican War amounted to 38 cases of murder, 60 cases of grand larceny and 13 cases of arson. Only a handful of cases <b>actually</b> <b>went</b> to trial. For example, Colin Robertson and four others were tried for the destruction of Fort Gibraltar, Cuthbert Grant, François-Firmin Boucher and 15 others were tried for the murder of Governor Semple, De Reinhard and McLellan stood trial for the murder of Owen Keveney, and Selkirk himself was tried on charges of theft, false imprisonment and resisting arrest. Since witnesses were expected to pay their own travel expenses and accommodations, Lord Selkirk personally paid the expenses of all HBC witnesses. Several Nor’Westers on trial jumped bail, including Cuthbert Grant. George Campbell, the former Red River colonist who had been arrested for helping steal the Red River colony’s cannons in 1815 escaped prison by obtaining a medical leave and then sneaking out of the hospital at night. However, they were not rigorously pursued. Every trial ended in acquittal except one. Charles De Reinhard was convicted of the murder of Owen Keveney. He was sentenced to death by hanging but the sentence was never carried out.|$|E
