The circuit level sensitivity-based approach is commonly used for analysis of possible faulty behaviour of an analogue circuit.

The authors briefly review why bipolar transistors are still of great interest and in widespread use in analogue integrated circuits. The review includes a comparison between BJTs and MOSFETs using a simple small-signal equivalent circuit with important parameters {{that can be used}} to compare these two technologies. An extensive review of the popular theories used to explain low-frequency noise results is presented. However, in almost all instances, these theories have not been fully tested. After a review of the effects of different processing technologies and conditions on the noise performance of PE-BJTs, a summary of some of the key technological steps and device parameters and their effects on noise is presented. The effects of temperature and emitter geometries scaling is reviewed. It is shown that dispersion of the low-frequency noise in ultrasmall geometries is a serious issue since the rate of increase of the noise dispersion is faster than that of the noise itself as the emitter geometry is scaled to smaller values. The same effect, but to a greater extent, is also observed in MOSFETs.

40|$|Advances in silicon {{technology}} {{over the last}} decade have led to increased integration of analogue and digital functional blocks onto the same single chip. In such a mixed signal environment, the analogue circuits must use the same process technology as their digital neighbours. With reducing transistor sizes, the impact of process variations on analogue design has become prominent and can lead to circuit performance falling below specification and hence reducing the yield. This thesis explores the methodology and algorithms for an <b>analogue</b> <b>integrated</b> <b>circuit</b> automation tool that optimizes performance and yield. The trade-offs between performance and yield are analysed using a combination of an evolutionary algorithm and Monte Carlo simulation. Through the integration of yield parameter into the optimisation process, the trade off between the performance functions can be better treated that able to produce a higher yield. The results obtained from the performance and variation exploration are modelled behaviourally using a Verilog-A language. The model has been verified with transistor level simulation and a silicon prototype. For a large analogue system, the circuit is commonly broken down into its constituent sub-blocks, a process known as hierarchical design. The use of hierarchical-based design and optimisation simplifies the design task and accelerates the design flow by encouraging design reuse. A new approach for system level yield optimisation using a hierarchical-based design is proposed and developed. The approach combines Multi-Objective Bottom Up (MUBU) modelling technique to model the circuit performance and variation and Top Down Constraint Design (TDCD) technique for the complete system level design. The proposed method has been used to design a 7 th order low pass filter and a charge pump phase locked loop system. The results have been verified with transistor level simulations and suggest that an accurate system level performance and yield prediction can be achieved with the proposed methodology...|$|E
40|$|This work {{deals with}} <b>analogue</b> <b>integrated</b> <b>circuit</b> design using {{various types of}} current-mode amplifiers. These {{circuits}} are analysed and realised using modern CMOS integration technologies. The dynamic nonlinearities of these circuits are discussed in detail as in the literature only linear nonidealities and static nonlinearities are conventionally considered. For the most important open-loop current-mode amplifier, the second-generation current-conveyor (CCII), a macromodel is derived that, unlike other reported macromodels, can accurately predict the common-mode behaviour in differential applications. Similarly, this model is {{used to describe the}} nonidealities of several other current-mode amplifiers because similar circuit structures are common in such amplifiers. With modern low-voltage CMOS-technologies, the current-mode operational amplifier and the high-gain current-conveyor (CCII∞) perform better than open-loop current-amplifiers. Similarly, unlike with conventional voltage-mode operational amplifiers, the large-signal settling behaviour of these two amplifier types does not degrade as CMOS-processes are scaled down. In this work, two 1 MHz 3 rd -order low-pass continuous-time filters are realised with a 1. 2 μm CMOS-process. These filters use a differential CCII∞ with linearised, dynamically biased output stages resulting in performance superior to most OTA-C filter realisations reported. Similarly, two logarithmic amplifier chips are designed and fabricated. The first circuit, implemented with a 1. 2 μm BiCMOS-process, uses again a CCII∞. This circuit uses a pn-junction as a logarithmic feedback element. With a CCII∞ the constant gain-bandwidth product, typical of voltage-mode operational amplifiers, is avoided resulting in a constant 1 MHz bandwidth with a 60 dB signal amplitude range. The second current-mode logarithmic amplifier, based on piece-wise linear approximation of the logarithmic function by a cascade of limiting current amplifier stages, is realised in a standard 1. 2 μm CMOS-process. The limiting level in these current amplifiers is less sensitive to process variation than in limiting voltage amplifiers resulting in exceptionally low temperature dependency of the logarithmic output signal. Additionally, along with this logarithmic amplifier a new current peak detectoris developed. reviewe...|$|E

The interest in these topics {{is related to the}} need to produce “analogue” electronic devices characterized by non-integer order impedance, and to the characterization of natural phenomena, which are systems with memory or aftereffects and for which the fractional-order calculus tool is the ideal choice for analysis.

EIS measures the electrical impedance of a specimen across a given range of frequencies, producing a spectrum that represents the variation of the impedance versus frequency – a technique that has the advantage of avoiding aggressive examinations.
