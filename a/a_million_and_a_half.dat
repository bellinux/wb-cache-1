5|$|Thomas Paine was a noted {{writer and}} {{political}} theorist whose work had influenced and helped drive the American Revolution. Having returned to England, {{he decided to}} write a book addressing the arguments of Edmund Burke, a prominent conservative strongly fearful of the French Revolution. This was simply titled Rights of Man. The first part was published in 1791, and attracted no attention from Pitt's administration. The second, published on 16 February 1792, advocated, amongst other things, {{the right of the people}} to replace their government if they thought it appropriate. The work was an immediate success, selling <b>a</b> <b>million</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>half</b> copies, and generated public support for various reform movements. It also brought Paine to the attention of the government and made him a subject to its crackdown. While Paine was visiting an aunt in Kent, Pitt had a writ issued against J.S. Jordan, Paine's publisher, prosecuting him for seditious libel—a crime based on the concept that the executive was beyond reproach, that made it illegal to criticise the government. Paine returned to London and began to campaign for Jordan, finding him a lawyer and agreeing to pay his legal fees. Jordan, however, most likely frightened for his life, pleaded guilty and turned his files over to the court. With this additional evidence, a writ was issued for Paine on 21 May, charging him with the same crime. His trial date was set for 8 June, and later rescheduled for 18 December.|$|E

Mast died in 1898 (leaving an estate of <b>a</b> <b>million</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>half</b> dollars). In 1902, John S. Crowell obtained Kirkpatrick's interests and established it as the Crowell Publishing Company. In 1906, Crowell turned around and sold {{his interest in the}} company to Joseph Knapp and George Hazen of New York, who incorporated in New Jersey and kept the name Crowell Publishing Company. Crowell Publishing acquired The American Magazine in 1911. The magazine had muckraking roots but with the decline of muckraking journalism it had turned into a general interest magazine.|$|E

25|$|The {{events of}} 1915-23 are {{regarded}} by Armenians {{and the vast}} majority of Western historians to have been state-sponsored mass killings. Turkish authorities, however, maintain that the deaths were the result of a civil war coupled with disease and famine, with casualties incurred by both sides. The exact number of deaths is hard to establish. It is estimated by many sources that close to <b>a</b> <b>million</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>half</b> Armenians perished in camps, which excludes Armenians who may have died in other ways. Most estimates place the total number of deaths between 600,000 (by Turkish authorities) and 1,500,000 (by Western academics). These events are traditionally commemorated yearly on 24 April, the Armenian Christian martyr day.|$|E
25|$|In {{the next}} decade {{important}} women writers also published novels. Susanna Rowson {{is best known for}} her novel, Charlotte: A Tale of Truth, published in London in 1791. In 1794 the novel was reissued in Philadelphia under the title, Charlotte Temple. Charlotte Temple is a seduction tale, written in the third person, which warns against listening to the voice of love and counsels resistance. She also wrote nine novels, six theatrical works, two collections of poetry, six textbooks, and countless songs. Reaching more than <b>a</b> <b>million</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>half</b> readers over a century and a half, Charlotte Temple was the biggest seller of the 19th century before Stowe's Uncle Tom's Cabin. Although Rowson was extremely popular in her time and is often acknowledged in accounts of the development of the early American novel, Charlotte Temple is often criticized as a sentimental novel of seduction.|$|E

Television critic Emily Nussbaum gave this episode praise in The New Yorker, {{comparing it to}} a fairy tale characterized by laughter and sorrow. Kohn called its mood happy yet miserable the same, evoking more emotions as a whole than even the preceding episode. The A.V. Club writer Oliver Sava gave it an A grade, finding it, like Kohn, emotionally intense. Kohn praised the episode for supplying Lumpy, a usually arrogant character, with a tragic circumstance. Sava saw the character as more explored that way. Nussbaum, who considered the episode proof of her intricacy as a character, wrote that Lumpy appropriately shows pathos.|$|E

Dimes {{had been struck}} {{intermittently}} during the 1970s and 1980s at the West Point Mint, in Roosevelt's home state of New York, to meet demand, but none bore a [...] "W" [...] mint mark. This changed in 1996, when dimes were struck there for the 50th anniversary of the Roosevelt design. Just under <b>a</b> <b>million</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>half</b> clad 1996-W dimes were minted; these were not released to circulation, but {{were included in the}} year's mint set for collectors.

[...] Over <b>a</b> <b>million</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>half</b> such pieces were struck in the second half of 1973, though they were dated 1974. [...] At congressional hearings, representatives of the vending machine industry testified that aluminum cents would jam their equipment, and the Mint backed away from its proposal. [...] Mint director Mary Brooks sought the return of samples which had been distributed to members of Congress, but 14 remained missing, with the recipients affecting not to know what had become of them. [...] One aluminum cent was donated to the Smithsonian Institution for the National Numismatic Collection; another was reportedly found by a US Capitol Police Officer. [...] Experiments were also conducted with bronze-clad steel cents. [...] Slated for disposal, when a bag of them tore open before going into a smelter a few were kept by the workers. [...] They are also considered to be illegally held government property. [...] Recognizing that a change from the current copper composition was still inevitable, Congress passed Public Law 93-441 on October 11, 1974, declaring [...] "henever in the judgment of the Secretary of the Treasury such action is necessary to assure an adequate supply of coins to meet the national needs, he may prescribe such composition of copper and zinc in the alloy of the one-cent piece as he may deem appropriate." ...|$|E
500|$|The firebombing {{campaign}} against major cities ended in June. On {{the first day}} of the month 521 B-29s escorted by 148 P-51s were dispatched in a daylight raid against Osaka. While en route to the city the Mustangs flew through thick clouds, and 27 of the fighters were destroyed in collisions. Nevertheless, 458 heavy bombers and 27 P-51s reached the city and the bombardment killed 3,960 Japanese and destroyed [...] of buildings. On 5June, 473 B-29s struck Kobe by day and destroyed [...] of buildings for the loss of 11 bombers. A force of 409 B-29s attacked Osaka again on 7June; during this attack [...] of buildings were burnt out and the Americans did not suffer any losses. Osaka was bombed for the fourth time in the month on 15June when 444 B-29s destroyed [...] of the city and another [...] of nearby Amagasaki; 300,000 houses were destroyed in Osaka. This attack marked the end of the first phase of XXIBomber Command's attack on Japan's cities. During May and June the bombers had destroyed much of the country's six largest cities, killing between 112,000 and 126,762 people and rendering millions homeless. The widespread destruction and high number of casualties from these raids caused many Japanese to realize that their country's military was no longer able to defend the home islands. American losses were low compared to Japanese casualties; 136 B-29s were downed during the campaign. In Tokyo, Osaka, Nagoya, Yokohama, Kobe, and Kawasaki, [...] "over 126,762 people were killed... and <b>a</b> <b>million</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>half</b> dwellings and over [...] of urban space were destroyed."

On June 23, 1962, the mono issue of Modern Sounds replaced the West Side Story soundtrack album as the number one album in the United States, knocking it {{off the top of the}} Billboard Pop Albums chart. The album spawned four charting singles, [...] "Born to Lose", [...] "Careless Love", [...] "I Can't Stop Loving You" [...] and [...] "You Don't Know Me", the latter two of which went number one on the Adult Contemporary chart.
