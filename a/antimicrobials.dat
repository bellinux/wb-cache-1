40|$|What is it? Definition: <b>Antimicrobial</b> MUE is a {{systematic}} analysis that focuses on evaluating and improving <b>antimicrobial</b> use processes. An <b>antimicrobial</b> MUE may be conducted to characterize and improve {{the use of a}} single <b>antimicrobial</b> agent or class, <b>antimicrobial</b> therapy for a specific infection, a single element of the <b>antimicrobial</b> use process (e. g. prescribing, preparation, dispensing, or administration), or to assess patient outcomes from <b>antimicrobial</b> therapy. Rationale: Excessive, unnecessary, or inappropriate <b>antimicrobial</b> prescribing in healthcare facilities contributes to the development of bacterial resistance, increases the risk of adverse events and healthcare-associated infections, and increases hospital costs. <b>Antimicrobial</b> stewardship programs (ASPs) promote “the four Ds ” of appropriate <b>antimicrobial</b> therapy: use of the correct Drug, at the correct Dose, for the correct Duration, with De-escalation when appropriate. <b>Antimicrobial</b> MUE is a critical, data-driven approach for determining where problems with use of <b>antimicrobial</b> agents may lie and how to address them.

40|$|<b>Antimicrobial</b> {{resistance}} {{is a global}} public health crisis and a national security threat to the United States, as stated in an executive order signed by the president in September 2014. This crisis {{is a result of}} indiscriminant <b>antimicrobial</b> use, which promotes selection for resistant organisms, increases the risk of adverse drug events, and renders patients vulnerable to drug-resistant infections. <b>Antimicrobial</b> stewardship is a key measure to combat <b>antimicrobial</b> resistance and specifically seeks to do this by improving <b>antimicrobial</b> use. <b>Antimicrobial</b> stewardship compliments infection control practices and {{it is important to note}} that these 2 disciplines are distinct and cannot be discussed interchangeably. <b>Antimicrobial</b> stewardship promotes the appropriate diagnosis, drug, dose, and duration of treatment. The appropriate diagnosis falls into the hands of the prescriber and clinical staff. Optimal <b>antimicrobial</b> drug selection, dosing strategy, and duration of treatment, however, often require expertise in <b>antimicrobial</b> therapy, such as an infectious disease–trained physician or pharmacist. Therefore, successful <b>antimicrobial</b> stewardship programs must be comprehensive and interdisciplinary. Most <b>antimicrobial</b> stewardship programs focus on hospitals; yet, in long-term care, up to 75 % of <b>antimicrobial</b> use is inappropriate or unnecessary. Thus, one of the most pressing areas in need for <b>antimicrobial</b> stewardship is in long-term care facilities. Unfortunately, there is little evidence that describes effective <b>antimicrobial</b> stewardship interventions in this setting.

Identifying the pattern of <b>antimicrobial</b> use can provide data from which targeted <b>antimicrobial</b> stewardship interventions can be made. The primary objective was to identify the prevalence of <b>antimicrobial</b> use at a tertiary care teaching hospital with both acute and long-term care patients. MethodsA point prevalence study was conducted on July 19 th, 2012. Data on <b>antimicrobial</b> utilization, indication for prescribing, duration of therapy, and frequency of infectious disease or <b>antimicrobial</b> stewardship consultations were collected using a customized integrated stewardship database (SPIRIT) and prospective chart review. ResultsOne or more <b>antimicrobial</b> agents were ordered in 31 % and 4 % of acute care and long-term care patients, respectively. Respiratory and urinary tract infections were the most common indication for <b>antimicrobial</b> therapy in both acute and long-term care. About 25 % of surgical prophylaxis orders were prescribed for greater than 24 h. ConclusionThis prospective point prevalence survey provided important baseline information on <b>antimicrobial</b> use within a large tertiary care teaching hospital and identified potential targets for future <b>antimicrobial</b> stewardship initiatives. A multi-center point prevalence survey should be considered to identify patterns of <b>antimicrobial</b> use in Canada and to establish the first steps toward international <b>antimicrobial</b> surveillance...|$|R

25|$|The most {{effective}} method for preventing CDI is proper antimicrobial prescribing.

A decrease in CDI by limiting antibiotics or by limiting unnecessary antimicrobial prescriptions in general, both in an outbreak and non-outbreak setting has been demonstrated to be most strongly associated with reduced CDI. Further, reactions to medication may be severe: CDI infections were the most common contributor to adverse drug events seen in U.S. hospitals in 2011.
