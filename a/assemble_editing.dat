[...] "Gordon Tucker (and Rabbi Leonard Levin) have done a superb job of <b>assembling,</b> <b>editing,</b> abridging, and translating a huge, not-quite-finished manuscript. Others literally died trying to translate this sprawling masterpiece. There may be some dissent from the inevitable omissions, some few typos, some doubts about Tucker's interpretations. But on the whole, the introductions to each chapter, the explanatory notes on almost every page (including identifying Heschel's often obscure sources) are wonderful aids in working through this massive work." ...|$|R

5000|$|The Florentine Codex is {{a complex}} document, <b>assembled,</b> <b>edited,</b> and {{appended}} over decades. Essentially it is three integral texts: (1) in Nahuatl; (2) a Spanish text; (3) pictorials. The {{final version of the}} Florentine Codex was completed in 1569. [...] The Nahuatl Sahagún's goals of orienting fellow missionaries to Aztec culture, providing a rich Nahuatl vocabulary, and recording the indigenous cultural heritage are at times in competition within the work. The manuscript pages are generally arranged in two columns, with Nahuatl, written first, on the right and a Spanish gloss or translation on the left. Diverse voices, views, and opinions are expressed in these 2,400 pages, and the result is a document that is sometimes contradictory.|$|R

[...] Known as the Four Treasuries Project (or Siku Quanshu), it was published in 36,000 volumes, containing about 3450 complete works and employing as many as 15,000 copyists. It preserved numerous books, but was also intended as a way to ferret out and suppress political opponents, requiring the [...] "careful examination of private libraries to assemble a list of around eleven thousand works from the past, of which about a third were chosen for publication. The works not included were either summarised or – in a good many cases – scheduled for destruction." ...|$|R

40|$|This {{dissertation}} aims at investigating {{differences in}} phraseological patterns in translated and interpreted language, {{on the basis}} of the intermodal corpus EPTIC_ 01 _ 2011 and focusing on Italian and French. First of all, an overview is offered of the main studies and theories about corpus linguistics and collocations: the notion of corpus is defined and a typology (focusing on intermodal corpora) is presented, before moving on to the linguistic phenomenon of collocation and its investigation through corpus linguistics methods. Second, the general structure of EPTIC_ 01 _ 2011 is presented, including the ways in which its texts have been <b>assembled,</b> <b>edited</b> through ad hoc conventions and enriched with metadata. The methodology proposed by Durrant and Schmitt (2009), slightly edited to fit the present study, has been used to extract and compare noun+adjective/adjective+noun bigrams from a quantitative point of view. A subset of these data have then been extracted and analysed manually. The results of the study are presented through graphs and examples, with an in-depth discussion of the bigrams considered. Lastly, the data collected are analysed and categorised in terms of shifts occurring in translation and in interpreting, potential causes are discussed and ideas for further research and for the development of the EPTIC corpus are sketched...|$|R

Sequences obtained from ITS, EF 1 -α, bloc, and RPB 1 gene regions {{were compared with}} the NCBI GenBank accessions, using Blast to confirm identifications of all isolate strains. Genomic analysis using the neighbor joining was performed using with MEGA 6.0 software (Saitou and Nei 1987).

40|$|Extensive aerosol data {{collected}} {{during the past decade}} around the Pacific Basin provide a preliminary assessment of aerosol microphysics for this region and cycling of aerosol in the troposphere. Our aircraft measurements include aerosol horizontal and vertical profiles of concentrations, size distributions, optical properties (light scattering and light absorption) and chemistry. The data characterize aerosol concentrations and properties over all sizes of primary interest to atmospheric chemistry and aerosol physics (i. e. 0. 003 to 20 µm) and address topics of aerosol nucleation, transport processes, evolution, entrainment and aerosol radiative effects. Thermal analysis of size distributions obtained from OPC (optical particle spectrometers), differential mobility analyzers (DMA) and condensation nuclei counters (CN) allowed inference of aerosol physico-chemistry, state of mixing, and aerosol with continental vs. "clean" characteristics. The first year of our projects involved <b>assembling,</b> <b>editing</b> and merging data from diverse aircraft experiments over the past decade (see below). This was followed in the second year by analysis that led to publications and presentations described below on particle production and cycling the Pacific troposphere (Part 1). In this third year we are expanding on this work with a related paper (Part 2) emphasizing size distributions and optics. Portions of these papers have also been presented in numerous meetings as outlined below. We also have our papers and other materials available on our Web Pag...|$|R
