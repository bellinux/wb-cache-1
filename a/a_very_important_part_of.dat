5|$|The 1920s {{was a new}} era for Indian {{women and}} is defined as 'feminism' that was {{responsible}} for the creation of localised women's associations.

This made the mass mobilisation of women an integral part of Indian nationalism. Women therefore were <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>important</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> various nationalist and anti-colonial efforts, including the civil disobedience movements in the 1930s.|$|E
