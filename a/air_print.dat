40|$|Drying occurs {{twice during}} coated paper production: first, when drying the base paper, then when drying the sheet freshly coated with an aqueous {{suspension}} of pigment particles. The effects on coated paper quality from the impingement drying conditions used at both base paper and coated paper drying stages were studied {{for the light}} weight coated (LWC) paper. A central feature {{of the study was}} the development of the capability to dry coated paper by impingement in superheated steam. The variables investigated were the drying fluid, air or superheated steam, drying fluid temperature, drying time and temperature, and coating-to-drying delay time. The effects of drying on the uncoated paper physical properties and the coated paper physical and printing properties were determined. The drying of the base paper with superheated steam gave higher strength and hydrophobicity but lower optical properties and smoothness than drying in air. When steam-dried base paper was coated and dried in air or steam it gave a rougher, less glossy, less bright coated paper than air-dried base paper. Print mottle remained high when air drying was used subsequently for the coated sheet. The biggest effect on LWC coated paper quality derived from the choice of drying medium, air or superheated steam. Coating-to-drying delay time had no effect. Most of the properties of steam-dried coated paper were fixed by 0. 6 s drying time. Properties the most affected were surface properties: print quality, gloss and roughness, while bulk properties were less sensitive. Drying with superheated steam gave lower gloss and smoothness than drying in <b>air.</b> <b>Print</b> mottle was significantly improved with steam drying of the coated sheet. Superheated steam drying of coated paper has advantages only if used for the coated sheet not the base sheet...|$|E
