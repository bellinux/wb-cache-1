40|$|The {{purpose of}} the work: the revelation of the {{concrete}} mechanisms, determining the structural integrity and functional effectiveness of the hair covering at the contact with water. For the first time, the moistening of hair of the half-water and ground mammals has been investigated. The influence of the lipides from the <b>animal's</b> <b>hair</b> surface {{on the surface of}} the water tension has been studied. The elasticity of the hair covering as the single construction of the alive voles to be submerged in water, has been measured. The established common laws and the peculiarities of interaction of the vole's hair covering with water can serve as the base for the quantitative analysis of the fine details of adaptations of the different <b>animals</b> <b>hair</b> covering to the half-water and water way of life.

25|$|A brush is the {{traditional}} writing instrument for Chinese calligraphy. The body of the brush is commonly made from bamboo or other materials such as wood, porcelain, or horn. The head of the brush is typically made from <b>animal</b> <b>hair,</b> such as weasel, rabbit, deer, goat, pig, tiger, wolf, etc. There is also a tradition in both China and Japan of making a brush using the hair of a newborn child, as a once-in-a-lifetime souvenir. This practice {{is associated with the}} legend of an ancient Chinese scholar who scored first in the imperial examinations by using such a personalized brush. Calligraphy brushes are widely considered an extension of the calligrapher's arm.|$|E
25|$|The {{origins of}} {{spinning}} fibre to make string or yarn are lost in time, but archaeological {{evidence in the}} form of representation of string skirts has been dated to the Upper Paleolithic era, some 20,000 years ago. In the most primitive type of spinning, tufts of <b>animal</b> <b>hair</b> or plant fibre are rolled down the thigh with the hand, and additional tufts are added as needed until the desired length of spun fibre is achieved. Later, the fibre is fastened to a stone which is twirled round until the yarn is sufficiently twisted, whereupon it is wound upon the stone and the process repeated over and over.|$|E
500|$|Breeding {{normally}} {{starts in}} early May, but often in April {{in the south}} of the range. Yellowhammers are monogamous and breed when aged one year. The males establish territories along hedges or woodland fringes and sing from a tree or bush, often continuing well into July or August. The male displays to the female by raising his wings and running towards her. The nest is built by the female on or near the ground, and is typically well hidden in tussocks, against a bank or low in a bush. It is constructed from nearby plant material, such as leaves, dry grass and stalks, and lined with fine grasses and sometimes <b>animal</b> <b>hair.</b> It is [...] across with a cup [...] deep.|$|E
50|$|In the wet felting process, {{hot water}} {{is applied to}} layers of <b>animal</b> <b>hairs,</b> while {{repeated}} agitation and compression causes the fibers to hook together or weave together into {{a single piece of}} fabric. Wrapping the properly arranged fiber in a sturdy, textured material, such as a bamboo mat or burlap, will speed up the felting process. The felted material may be finished by fulling.|$|R

Construction began in March, 2003. Traditional Chinese shipbuilding techniques were used, such as flame bending of planks, and edge-nailing using hand forged nails. Joints between the planks were sealed using traditional caulk made by volunteers out of a mixture of lime and linseed oil. This substance is called chu'nam, and also includes organic fibers, [...] such as <b>animal</b> <b>hair,</b> grasses or bamboo fiber.|$|E
50|$|Many mammals have fur {{and other}} hairs that serve {{different}} functions. Hair provides thermal regulation and camouflage for many animals; for others it provides signals to other {{animals such as}} warnings, mating, or other communicative displays; and for some <b>animals</b> <b>hair</b> provides defensive functions and, rarely, even offensive protection. Hair also has a sensory function, extending the sense of touch beyond {{the surface of the}} skin. Guard hairs give warnings that may trigger a recoiling reaction.|$|R
50|$|Leucism {{is a rare}} genetic {{pattern that}} causes a {{reduction}} in the pigment of an <b>animal's</b> <b>hair</b> and skin. The natural colour of the red deer ranges from dark red to brown. They are often thought to be albinos; however, unlike albinos, who have characteristically red eyes, deer with leucism have normal colouring in their eyes. It is distinguished biologically from albinism in that it causes a reduced pigmentation in all skin types, and not just melanin.|$|R

2500|$|The gene {{with the}} {{greatest}} role in the seal brown coat phenotype is Agouti signalling peptide (ASIP) or simply Agouti. The functional Agouti signalling peptide (protein) acts as a switch between red-yellow phaeomelanin and black-brown eumelanin. It is ASIP {{that is responsible for}} the alternate banding of dark and light on <b>animal</b> <b>hair,</b> although it is also responsible for whole-body effects. ASIP attaches to MC1R molecules to temporarily prevent the latter from continuing the production of eumelanin, and so phaeomelanin is produced in its stead.

2500|$|Quilting {{originated}} in Sweden {{in the fifteenth}} century with heavily stitched and appliqu√©d quilts made for the very wealthy. These quilts, created from silk, wool, and felt, were intended to be both decorative and functional and were found in churches and in the homes of nobility. Imported cotton first appeared in Sweden in 1870, and began to appear in Swedish quilts soon after along with scraps of wool, silk, and linen. As the availability of cotton increased and its price went down, quilting became widespread among all classes of Swedish society. Wealthier quilters used wool batting while others used linen scraps, rags, or paper mixed with <b>animal</b> <b>hair.</b> In general, these quilts were simple and narrow, [...] made by both men and women. The biggest influence on Swedish quilting in this time period is thought to have come from America as Swedish immigrants to the United States returned to their home country when conditions there improved.|$|E
50|$|The female {{constructs}} a nest in a shrub or tree. It is made {{of plant}} fibers, spider webs, <b>animal</b> <b>hairs,</b> and down, and it is lined externally with moss for camouflage. She lays a clutch of two white eggs. She regurgitates insect material for the chicks, because they cannot persist on nectar alone. She broods the chicks for about 12 days, after which {{there is not enough}} room for her in the nest. The young depart at about 20 days.|$|R
50|$|Freeze {{branding}} {{changes the}} color of the <b>animal‚Äôs</b> <b>hair</b> to white without preventing hair growth. This effect is created by killing the hair‚Äôs color follicle (CF), causing the hair to grow without pigment. It therefore appears white, even though it is actually colorless. If the branding iron is applied {{for a longer period of}} time, it will also freeze the growth follicle (GF), causing the hair to stop growing entirely. On light colored animals, this is done intentionally to leave a bald patch of dark skin.|$|R

2500|$|The mask-makers {{were called}} skeuopoios or [...] "maker of the properties," [...] thus {{suggesting}} that their role encompassed multiple duties and tasks. The masks {{were most likely}} made out of light weight, organic materials like stiffened linen, leather, wood, or cork, with the wig consisting of human or <b>animal</b> <b>hair.</b> Due to the visual restrictions imposed by these masks, it was imperative that the actors hear in order to orient and balance themselves. Thus, {{it is believed that}} the ears were covered by substantial amounts of hair and not the helmet-mask itself. The mouth opening was relatively small, preventing the mouth to be seen during performances. Vervain and Wiles posit that this small size discourages the idea that the mask functioned as a megaphone, as originally presented in the 1960s. Greek mask-maker, Thanos Vovolis, suggests that the mask serves as a resonator for the head, thus enhancing vocal acoustics and altering its quality. This leads to increased energy and presence, allowing for the more complete metamorphosis of the actor into his character.|$|E
2500|$|The {{earliest}} {{paintings were}} not representational but ornamental; they consisted of patterns or designs rather than pictures. [...] Early pottery was painted with spirals, zigzags, dots, or animals. [...] It was {{only during the}} Warring States period (475-221 BC) that artists began to represent the world around them. In imperial times (beginning with the Eastern Jin dynasty), painting and calligraphy in China {{were among the most}} highly appreciated arts in the court and they were often practiced by amateursaristocrats and scholar-officialswho had the leisure time necessary to perfect the technique and sensibility necessary for great brushwork. Calligraphy and painting were thought to be the purest forms of art. The implements were the brush pen made of <b>animal</b> <b>hair,</b> and black inks made from pine soot and animal glue. In ancient times, writing, as well as painting, was done on silk. However, after the invention of paper in the 1st century AD, silk was gradually replaced by the new and cheaper material. Original writings by famous calligraphers have been greatly valued throughout China's history and are mounted on scrolls and hung on walls {{in the same way that}} paintings are.|$|E
2500|$|Nests {{are built}} between rocks, in holes in walls or {{in a tree}} hollow. Nests are lined with <b>animal</b> <b>hair</b> {{and it has been}} noted that many nests have pieces of snake sloughs. The eggs are of regular oval form, but many are {{elongated}} and a few pointed. They have a fair amount of gloss. The ground-colour is white, often tinged with faint green or pink, and this is rather closely spotted, speckled, streaked, and mottled, with rich reddish or umber-brown and brownish yellow, with some underlying lavender. The markings are denser at the larger end of the egg, where they form an irregular cap. Some eggs are blotched with dark reddish brown at the large end. Eggs are about [...] long and [...] wide. Three to four eggs is the usual clutch. An abnormal clutch of seven has been noted although none of the eggs hatched at this nest. Only the female incubates. Eggs hatch in about 10‚Äì12 days. Chicks have black down. Both males and females feed the young, the males sometimes passing food to the female which in turn feeds the young. Nestlings may feign dead (thanatosis) when handled. Nestlings may be preyed on by the rufous treepie. The same nest site may be reused in subsequent years.|$|E

2500|$|After {{the masks}} are shaped, they are painted and {{otherwise}} decorated. Facial features may be cut into or {{painted on the}} mask. Most masks are painted first {{with a layer of}} white with colors added. Traditionally the decorative paint was oil and enamel, but many have switched to acrylics and other commercial paints. [...] Although details such as beards, mustaches and eyebrows can be painted or sculpted on the mask, more realistic versions add ixtle, cotton, <b>animal</b> <b>hair</b> (such as horse or sheep) and even human hair, as well as other materials. Eyes can be imitated on the mask with the use of marbles, mica, flat or curve glass (painted behind) or glass eyes. Many tiger masks place mirrors for eyes. Teeth can be added with the use of real ones from animals or humans, as well as metal, cactus spines, corn or reeds. If the mask has a tongue, it is often of leather or tin. Horns on devil masks are commonly made from those from cows, goats or deer. Finished masks often receive further decoration with ribbons, gold accents, bells, sequins and more. Often this addition of decoration is done by the dancers themselves to personalize them, especially the addition of beards and fangs. In the town of Teloloapan, Guerrero, the local government holds a contest for the best decoration of devil masks.|$|E
2500|$|As {{the flags}} were/are part of {{signaling}} system, {{it is important}} to analyze every part. The nomadic Mongols, close neighbors of the Turkish tribes, had from antiquity used totemic standards that were a kind of metal, wood, and <b>animal</b> <b>hair,</b> which Ottoman military continued on their flag pools (tug). The Mongols applied these materials to the typical cloth flag (cloth flag is Chinese origin), their emblems and symbols. The nomadic signs, with horse - and yaktail standards, were adopted by the Chinese, and, vice versa, which makes hard to state the source some of these signs used in Ottoman flags. These signs carried over with the subsequent migrations of the Mongols and the Turks. For the same period, very little is known about old Iranian flags (signs). Traces of ancient Mesopotamian culture, charged with typical motifs of mythical, astral, and magic origin could be in them. There are Persian flags in miniature paintings. These flags are usually small, come in various shapes and colors, and bear Koranic inscriptions. A French traveler Jean Chardin left some descriptions of the Safavid flags and according to him they differed from Ottoman flags of the same period. [...] Arab flags were of basic importance to followers Islam, including Ottoman Military. The first caliphs tried to maintain an original simplicity in their signs, appropriate to an ascetic and fighting religion, but soon, under Persian influence, the style evolved into one using more representative and pompous images. Like in Arabic flags, sophisticated abstract decoration, and lines of Koranic inscriptions were found on Ottoman military flags.|$|E
2500|$|White wagtails are monogamous {{and defend}} {{breeding}} territories. The breeding season for most is from April to August, with the season starting later further north. Both sexes {{are responsible for}} building the nest, with the male responsible for initiating the nest building and the female for finishing the process. For second broods in the subspecies personata the female alone builds the nest, which is a rough cup assembled from twigs, grass, leaves and other plant matter, as the male is still provisioning the young. It is lined with soft materials, including <b>animal</b> <b>hair.</b> The nest is set into a crevice or hole‚Äîtraditionally in a bank next to a river or ditchbut the species has also adapted to nesting in walls, bridges and buildings.

Around three to eight eggs are laid, with the usual number being four to six. The eggs are cream-coloured, often with a faint bluish-green or turquoise tint, and heavily spotted with reddish brown; they measure, on average, [...] Both parents incubate the eggs, although the female generally does so for longer and incubates at night. The eggs begin to hatch after 12 days (sometimes as late as 16 days). Both parents feed the chicks until they fledge at around 14 days, and the chicks are fed for another week after fledging.|$|E
