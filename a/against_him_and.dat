5|$|Dong Zhuo {{learns that}} the Coalition of Yuan Shao has finally started to attack, and he defeats them at Si Shui Gate and Hu Lao Gate.

His final act is to destroy Cao Cao, Liu Bei, and Sun Jian at Guandu, Xiapi, and Hefei. He rides into the capital on a victory march, taking over the land.|$|E
5|$|In April 1999, {{on the eve}} of the retrial of {{the federal}} case, Keating entered a plea agreement. He {{admitted}} to having committed four counts of wire and bankruptcy fraud by extracting nearly $1 million from American Continental Corp. while already anticipating the collapse that happened weeks later. The federal prosecutors dropped all other charges <b>against</b> <b>him</b> <b>and</b> his son, Charles Keating III. He was sentenced to time served.|$|E

Rashad Bey and 800 Egyptian soldiers were killed, while hundreds more were captured by rebels {{and taken to}} Hebron. Ibrahim Pasha had since returned to Mount Zion and the rebels attempted to lay siege <b>against</b> <b>him</b> <b>and</b> his troops.|$|E
5|$|In later years, Wolff said he {{was always}} wary of Heydrich, {{who seemed to be}} waiting for an {{opportunity}} to move <b>against</b> <b>him</b> <b>and</b> disgrace him with Himmler. Within the Allgemeine-SS, Heydrich forged relationships with some of the more powerful SS and Police Leaders such as Friedrich Jeckeln. Heydrich maintained a dialogue with him, but cautiously, especially after Jeckeln ran afoul of Himmler in the late 1930s and early 1940s.|$|E
5|$|Licinius and Martinianus {{surrendered}} to Constantine at Nicomedia {{on the promise}} their lives would be spared: they were sent to live as private citizens in Thessalonica and Cappadocia respectively, but in 325 Constantine accused Licinius of plotting <b>against</b> <b>him</b> <b>and</b> had them both arrested and hanged; Licinius's son (the son of Constantine's half-sister) was also killed.|$|E

5|$|Meanwhile, the city's mayoral primary race enters its closing weeks. Royce {{initially}} has {{a seemingly}} insurmountable lead over challengers Tommy Carcetti and Tony Gray, {{with a big}} war chest and major endorsements. Royce's lead begins to fray, however, as his own political machinations turn <b>against</b> <b>him</b> <b>and</b> Carcetti starts to highlight the city's crime problem. Carcetti is propelled to victory in the primary election.|$|E
5|$|Upon release, an Islamic group protested {{against the}} film, {{claiming}} that it portrayed Muslims as terrorists and traitors. Murugadoss, S. Thanu and Vijay's father S. A. Chandrasekhar later tendered an open apology to representatives of 23 different Muslim outfits, {{and agreed to}} delete the scenes to which objections were raised, after activists had gathered near Vijay's residence at Neelankarai and raised slogans <b>against</b> <b>him</b> <b>and</b> the film in Arabic and Urdu.|$|E
5|$|Abdul Aziz's younger brother, Ghazi Abdul Rashid, {{had been}} {{negotiating}} {{with a government}} mediator. He claimed that the remaining students were willing to leave the mosque and lay down their arms, provided the government would grant them amnesty and not fire on them. Government officials were sceptical that Abdul Rashid would honour this agreement. In {{a telephone interview from}} a live transmission of Geo TV, Ghazi Abdul Rashid denied all the charges <b>against</b> <b>him</b> <b>and</b> reiterated his innocence. He further negotiated with the government for his safe passage and a guarantee that no harm would come to his followers inside the mosque. He also received a promise that his ailing mother would receive medical care.|$|E

5|$|After reigning two years, Amon {{was assassinated}} by his servants, who conspired <b>against</b> <b>him,</b> <b>and</b> was succeeded {{by his son}} Josiah, {{who at the time}} was eight years old. After Amon's {{assassination}} his murderers became unpopular with the people, and were ultimately killed. Some scholars, such as Abraham Malamat, assert that Amon was assassinated because people disliked the heavy influence that Assyria, an age-old enemy of Judah responsible for the destruction of the Kingdom of Israel, had upon him.|$|E
5|$|Around 212AD, {{soon after}} Vologases VI of Parthia (r. c.208–222AD) took the throne, his brother Artabanus V of Parthia (d.224AD) rebelled <b>against</b> <b>him</b> <b>and</b> gained {{control over a}} greater part of the empire. Meanwhile, the Roman emperor Caracalla (r.211–217AD) deposed the kings of Osroene and Armenia to make them Roman provinces once more. He marched into Mesopotamia under the pretext of marrying one of Artabanus' daughters, but—because the {{marriage}} was not allowed—made war on Parthia and conquered Arbil east of the Tigris river.|$|E
5|$|As {{territorial}} {{governor of}} Montana, Leslie quickly drew {{the ire of}} the press for his pro-temperance position. The territory's political machinery also turned <b>against</b> <b>him,</b> <b>and</b> he was removed from office by President Benjamin Harrison. When Grover Cleveland succeeded Harrison {{for a second term}} in office, he appointed Leslie district attorney for Montana. Leslie continued to practice law well into his eighties, and was being considered for a district court judgeship in Montana when he fell ill with pneumonia and died on February 7, 1907, at the age of 87.|$|E
50|$|Senator Shoffner {{was burned}} in effigy in several counties, and the KKK unsuccessfully tried {{several times to}} kill him. To escape revenge by klansmen <b>against</b> <b>him,</b> he <b>and</b> his family fled to Hendricks County, Indiana.|$|R

5|$|Caracalla's mother Julia Domna was {{initially}} left in peace when Macrinus became emperor. This changed when Macrinus {{discovered that she}} was conspiring <b>against</b> <b>him</b> <b>and</b> had her placed under house arrest in Antioch. By this time Julia Domna was suffering from an advanced stage of breast cancer and soon died in Antioch, possibly by starving herself. Afterwards, Macrinus sent Domna's sister Julia Maesa and her children back to Emesa in Syria, from where Maesa set in motion her plans to have Macrinus overthrown. Macrinus remained in Antioch {{instead of going to}} Rome upon being declared emperor, a step which furthered his unpopularity in Rome and contributed to his eventual downfall.|$|E
5|$|Dunrobin Castle {{was built}} {{in the midst of a}} tribal society, with Norse and Gaelic in use at the time. Robert the Bruce planted the Gordons, who {{supported}} his claim to the crown, at Huntly in Aberdeenshire, and they were created Earls of Huntly in 1445. The Earldom passed to the Gordon family in the 16th century when the 8th Earl of Sutherland gave his daughter Elizabeth in marriage to Adam Gordon. After the 8th Earl died in 1508, Elizabeth's elder brother was declared heir to the title, but a brieve (writ) of idiocy brought <b>against</b> <b>him</b> <b>and</b> his younger brother by the Gordons meant that the possession of the estate went to Adam Gordon in 1512.|$|E
5|$|Even though Sava's {{diplomacy}} was of {{no effect}} either, Strez died the night after Sava's departure. Serbian sources present the death of Strez as a miracle, Strez being stabbed by an angel, though in reality he was very likely murdered in a plot orchestrated by Sava. Historian John V. A. Fine theorizes that Sava may have found supporters among Strez's nobles, {{some of whom had}} turned <b>against</b> <b>him</b> <b>and</b> organized his murder, only to defect to Serbia immediately afterwards. According to the hagiography of Saint Sava, in his dying words Strez claimed he was stabbed by a young soldier on the order of Sava.|$|E

50|$|Ford {{builds a}} solid alibi and frames other {{people for the}} double homicide. However, to {{successfully}} frame others when the evidence starts to go <b>against</b> <b>him,</b> he has to commit additional murders.

5|$|In {{his later}} years, Zara Yaqob became more despotic. When Takla Hawariat, abbot of Dabra Libanos, criticized Yaqob's beatings {{and murder of}} men, the emperor had the abbot himself beaten and imprisoned, where he died after few months. Zara Yaqob was {{convinced}} of a plot against him in 1453, which led to more brutal actions. He increasingly became convinced that {{his wife and children}} were plotting <b>against</b> <b>him,</b> <b>and</b> had several of them beaten. Seyon Morgasa, the mother of the future emperor Baeda Maryam I, died from this mistreatment in 1462, which led to a complete break between son and father. Eventually relations between the two were repaired, and Zara Yaqob publicly designated Baeda Maryam as his successor.|$|E
5|$|Lukashenko blamed {{foreign governments}} for conspiring <b>against</b> <b>him</b> <b>and,</b> in April 1998, {{expelled}} ambassadors from the Drazdy complex near Minsk and moved them to another building. The Drazdy conflict caused an international outcry {{and resulted in}} a travel ban on Lukashenko from the EU and the US. Although the ambassadors eventually returned after the controversy died down, Lukashenko stepped up his rhetorical attacks against the West. He stated that Western governments were trying to undermine Belarus at all levels, even sports, during the 1998 Winter Olympics in Nagano, Japan.|$|E
5|$|Octavian {{began to}} make common cause with the Optimates, the former enemies of Caesar. In September, the leading Optimate orator Marcus Tullius Cicero began to attack Antony {{in a series of}} speeches portraying him {{as a threat to the}} Republican order. With opinion in Rome turning <b>against</b> <b>him</b> <b>and</b> his year of {{consular}} power nearing its end, Antony attempted to pass laws that would lend him control over Cisalpine Gaul, which had been assigned as part of his province, from Decimus Junius Brutus Albinus, one of Caesar's assassins.|$|E
