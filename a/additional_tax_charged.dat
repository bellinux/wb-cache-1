5000|$|Drip pricing is a {{technique}} used by online retailers {{of goods and services}} whereby a headline price is advertised {{at the beginning of the}} purchase process, following which <b>additional</b> fees, <b>taxes</b> or <b>charges,</b> which may be unavoidable, are then incrementally disclosed or [...] "dripped". The objective of drip pricing is to gain a consumer's interest in an attractively low headline price, but the final price is not disclosed until the consumer has invested time and effort in the purchase process and made a decision to purchase. Naïve consumers will purchase based on headline price and sophisticated consumers will consider total cost when comparing offers. Drip pricing can distort competition because it can make it difficult for businesses with more transparent pricing practices to compete on a level playing field.|$|R

40|$|Designing {{a set of}} {{road user}} <b>taxes</b> and <b>charges</b> {{involves}} charging for scarce road space, setting corrective taxes for environmental externalities, and possibly <b>additional</b> <b>taxes</b> to improve the overall efficiency and equity of the tax system. On the analogy with other network utilities, revenue from road charges can be set to cover total road costs, including interest on the capital, while their structure (fuel excises, license fees, and road prices such as cordon tolls) can improve the efficiency of road use and reduce congestion. With constant returns and efficient road provision there is no conflict between efficient and cost-recovering <b>charges,</b> though optimal <b>tax</b> considerations may argue for <b>additional</b> <b>taxes.</b> The major benefit from this clarification is to simplify moves to more efficient road pricing and to address current under-investment in roads...|$|R

We consider a two-country stochastic partial equilibrium model with log-normally distributed uncertainty. The situation {{is analogous to the}} situation where European countries impose national carbon taxes in addition to the EU emissions trading. The allowance price in the joint cap-and-trade scheme depends on the tax rate, the relative size of countries and abatement options, the magnitude of uncertainty, and correlation of abatement costs. In most cases, the <b>additional</b> <b>tax</b> will not lead to additional production of the public good beyond the fixed targets. The <b>additional</b> <b>tax</b> results in higher costs of abatement to the country introducing the <b>additional</b> <b>tax,</b> and higher costs overall...|$|R
