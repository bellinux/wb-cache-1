5|$|There {{were many}} more systems added with the time, like the Atlis II in the French {{aircraft}}, and, in 1994–95, some GR1s had laser-designator systems fitted. Missiles like AS-30 {{and even the}} anti-ship Sea Eagle were added. Some IAF aircraft had the <b>Agave</b> radar system, purpusely for maritime strike. India later developed the DARIN system in its Jaguar fleet, with a modern 1553 databus.|$|E

5|$|The amputated parts {{might be}} placed in a pouch for the girl to wear. A single hole of 2–3mm is left for the passage of urine and menstrual fluid. The vulva is closed with {{surgical}} thread, or <b>agave</b> or acacia thorns, and might be covered with a poultice of raw egg, herbs and sugar. To help the tissue bond, the girl's legs are tied together, often from hip to ankle; the bindings are usually loosened after a week and removed after two to six weeks. If the remaining hole is too large {{in the view of the}} girl's family, the procedure is repeated.|$|E
5|$|The basic {{ingredients}} of beer are water; a starch source, such as malted barley, {{able to be}} saccharified (converted to sugars) then fermented (converted into ethanol and carbon dioxide); a brewer's yeast to produce the fermentation; and a flavouring such as hops. A mixture of starch sources may be used, with a secondary starch source, such as maize (corn), rice or sugar, often being termed an adjunct, especially when used as a lower-cost substitute for malted barley. Less widely used starch sources include millet, sorghum and cassava root in Africa, and potato in Brazil, and <b>agave</b> in Mexico, among others. The amount of each starch source in a beer recipe is collectively called the grain bill.|$|E
5|$|The main plant foods {{gathered}} were walnuts, saguaro fruits, juniper berries, acorns, sunflower seeds, manzanita {{berries and}} apples, hackberries, the bulbs of the Quamash, and the greens of the Lamb's quarters, Scrophularia, and Lupinus plants. <b>Agave</b> {{was the most}} crucial harvest, {{as it was the}} only plant food available from late fall through early spring. The hearts of the plant were roasted in stone-lined pits, and could be stored for later use. Primary animals hunted were deer, rabbit, jackrabbit, quail, and woodrat. Fish and water-borne birds were eschewed by most Yavapai groups. Some groups of Tolkepaya began eating fish after contact with their Quechan neighbors.|$|E

25|$|The {{industry}} generates about 29,000 jobs {{directly and}} indirectly. Certified production amounts {{to more than}} 2 million liters; 434,000 liters are exported, generating 21 million dollars in income. To truly be called mezcal, the liquor must come from certain areas. States that have certified mezcal <b>agave</b> growing areas with production facilities are Durango, Guanajuato, Guerrero, Oaxaca, San Luis Potosí, Tamaulipas, and Zacatecas. About 30 species of <b>agave</b> are certified {{for use in the}} production of mezcal. Oaxaca has 570 of the 625 mezcal production facilities in Mexico, but some in-demand mezcals come from Guerrero, as well. In Tamaulipas, 11 municipalities have received authorization to produce authentic mezcal with the hopes of competing for a piece of both the Mexican national and international markets. The <b>agave</b> used here is <b>agave</b> Americano, <b>agave</b> verde or maguey de la Sierra, which are native to the state.|$|E
25|$|The {{two types}} of mezcal are those made of 100% <b>agave</b> and those mixed with other ingredients, with at least 80% <b>agave.</b> Both types have four categories. White mezcal is clear and hardly aged. Dorado (golden) is not aged but a {{coloring}} agent is added. This is more often done with a mixed mezcal. Reposado or añejado (aged) is placed in wood barrels from two to nine months. This {{can be done with}} 100% <b>agave</b> or mixed mezcals. Añejo is aged in barrels for a minimum of 12 months. The best of this type are generally aged from 18 months to three years. If the añejo is of 100% <b>agave,</b> it is usually aged for about four years.|$|E
25|$|Bacanora {{is a local}} liquor {{which has}} been made for decades {{in the town of}} the same name, located {{in the center of the}} state. Its base is an <b>agave</b> plant (<b>agave</b> lechuguilla or <b>agave</b> angustifolia) like mezcal and tequila, and it comes in various styles {{including}} aged. It has a distinct flavor. It is estimated that half a million plants are harvested from the wilds to make this beverage each year, leading to concerns of over exploitation.|$|E

Pentheus' aunts, and his mother, <b>Agave,</b> are among them; they rip him limb from limb. <b>Agave</b> mounts his head on a pike, and takes the trophy to her father, Cadmus. The madness passes. Dionysus arrives in his true, divine form, banishes <b>Agave</b> and her sisters, and transforms Cadmus and his wife Harmonia into serpents. Only Tiresias is spared.|$|E

25|$|Today, mezcal {{is still}} {{made from the}} heart of the <b>agave</b> plant, called the piña, much the same way it was 200 years ago, in most places. In Mexico, mezcal is {{generally}} consumed straight and has a strong smoky flavor. Though mezcal is not as popular as tequila (made specifically from the blue <b>agave</b> in select regions of the country), Mexico does export the product, mostly to Japan and the United States, and exports are growing.|$|E

25|$|Upon introduction, these liquors {{were called}} aguardiente (literally fire water or fiery water). The Spanish had known {{distillation}} processes since the eighth century {{and had been}} used to drinking hard liquor. They brought a supply with them from Europe, but when this ran out, they began to look for a substitute. They had been introduced to pulque and other drinks based on the <b>agave</b> or <b>agave</b> plant, so they began experimenting {{to find a way to}} make a product with a higher alcohol content. The result is mezcal.|$|E
