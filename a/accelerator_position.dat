40|$|Abstract—A {{process to}} design the control {{strategy}} for a vehicle with electronic throttle control (ETC) and automatic transmission is proposed in this paper. The driver’s <b>accelerator</b> pedal <b>position</b> is interpreted as a power request, {{which is to be}} satisfied by coordinating the transmission gear shift and the throttle opening in an optimal fashion. The dynamic programming (DP) technique is used to obtain the optimal gear shift and throttle opening which maximizes fuel economy while satisfying the power demand. The optimal results at different power levels are then combined to form a gear map and a throttle map which governs the operation of the integrated powertrain. A control architecture concept is presented where the relationship between the <b>accelerator</b> pedal <b>position</b> and the power demand level can be adjusted according to the preference of the vehicle performance target. Simulation, vehicle test, and dynamometer test results show that the proposed integrated powertrain control scheme produces power consistently and improves fuel efficiency compared with conventional powertrain control schemes.

30|$|The wideness of the {{measured}} ranges depends {{mostly on the}} drivers. Women tend to consume and emit less than men. The {{reason for this is}} the different way they use the accelerator pedal; they push it less and keep it steadier. In other word the standard deviation of the <b>accelerator</b> <b>position</b> (or throttle) is lower. It is here shown how a correlation exist between the throttle standard deviation and the emissions which justify using such parameter as the indicator of drive-style.|$|E

40|$|Environmentally {{friendly}} driving – or eco-driving – {{refers to}} the driving of a vehicle {{in a way that}} conserves fuel and reduces emissions. Large fuel savings are possible by targeting the role of driver behaviour in the protection of the environment, and teaching them how to ‘eco-drive’. This study forms part of the ecoDriver project, which aims to develop an in-vehicle eco-driving support system. While many current systems offer after-trip feedback on the fuel efficiency of driving or simple in-trip recommendations (e. g. gear shift indicators), this study investigates a number of systems that provide real-time, feed-forward guidance on how to alter accelerator usage in the upcoming moments to minimise fuel consumption. A driving simulator was used to test three potential eco-driving interfaces which used a common eco-driving guidance algorithm. Two systems used a haptic accelerator pedal, while one presented multi-modal visual and auditory information. Objective eco-driving performance was measured as the error between desired <b>accelerator</b> <b>position</b> defined by the system and <b>accelerator</b> <b>position</b> selected by the driver. Subjective feedback on workload and acceptability of the system was analysed and driver visual distraction was monitored throughout.

40|$|The {{work done}} at SAAB Automobile AB in Trollhättan {{is about to}} study if it is {{possible}} to introduce a new mode with focus on facilitating a more economic way of driving. This mode {{came to be known as}} the ECO mode, where ECO stands for Economy, which is supposed to ease and advise the driver during the driving itself, for example by tipping which gear should be chosen with a manual transmission, which is thought to be presented at the assistance display, or with an automatic transmission to increase the drivers means to drive more fuel-efficient. The driver is able to chose whether to follow those advices or not, which basically means that the ECO mode is not governing in any way. The ECO mode itself was initiated due to that CO 2 credit was promised, in order if car companies could prove positive real life fuel consumption. Practically this would mean, for example, to cut a couple of grams (CO 2 -emission) when certifying the emission values. Therefore, there is a need to study this scope of work. In this analysis, there is an interest in what effects the ECO mode would contribute with in a vehicle with automatic transmission. A possible introduction of the mode would probably bring both positive and negative signs within a couple of areas, where vehicle control and comfort belongs to the negatives, while fuel consumption, and therefore CO 2 emissions, is expected to improve. To answer these questions, data was collected from the standardized driving patterns US, EU and Saabs own defined cycle, the THN-VBG cycle. The tests were performed with two different calibrations, ECO and STD. A summary of the main results follow: EU-cycle Fuel consumption improved by 5 % with ECO mode. Minimal difference regarding the accelerator regulations between ECO & STD. Wider variation in the <b>accelerator</b> <b>positions</b> with ECO mode. Minimal difference in the ability to follow targeted speed between ECO & STD. US-cycle Fuel consumption improved by 5 % with ECO mode. Minimal difference regarding the accelerator regulations between ECO & STD. Wider variation in the <b>accelerator</b> <b>positions</b> with ECO mode. Minimal difference in the ability to follow targeted speed between ECO & STD. THN-VBG cycle Fuel consumption improved by 1, 7 % with the ECO mode. Moderate difference regarding the ability to follow instructions, 7 % more regulation with the STD mode. All cycles including real-life driving show an increased use of higher gears. Accelerations levels – The STD calibration reaches a wider interval of acceleration: ranging from 0 m/s 2 – 4 m/s 2 whilst the ECO calibrated car rarely passes 2, 8 m/s 2. This would indicate that the ECO calibration promotes a more restrained driving style as data is captured in real-life traffic...|$|R
40|$|This work {{presents}} a methodology {{to adjust the}} electronic control system of a reciprocating internal combustion engine test bench {{and the effect of}} the control parameters on emissions produced by the engine under two extreme situations: unadjusted and adjusted, both under transient operation. The aim is to provide a tuning guide to those in charge of this equipment not needed to be experts in control engineering. The proposed methodology covers from experimental plant modelling to control parameters determination and experimental validation. The methodology proposed includes the following steps: (i) Understanding of test bench and mathematical modeling; (ii) Model parameters identification; (iii) Control law proposal and tuning from simulation and (iv) Experimental validation. The work has been completed by presenting a comparative experimental study about the effect of the test bench control parameters on engine performance profiles (engine speed, engine torque and relative fuel air ratio) and on regulated gaseous emissions (nitrogen oxides and hydrocarbons concentrations) and the profile of number of particles emitted.

40|$|The {{literature}} {{has shown that}} conversations and verbal tasks degrade the driver’s ability to maintain control of the vehicle and avoid hazardous conditions. However, {{the question of how}} the difficulty (or intensity) of a conversation relates to decrements in driving performance needs further investigation. Other studies have shown that conversations may hinder driving, but these were unable to quantify a difficulty threshold at which conversations and verbal tasks became more hazardous. This study compared two quantifiably different levels of conversation difficulty and a non-conversing condition over measures of driving performance and mental workload. This study used a GlobalSim Corporation driving simulator, allowing participants full control of the vehicle on two lane roads in a rural setting. Driving conditions were set up and controlled {{in order to determine the}} extent to which conversation had an effect on driving performance, which was assessed in terms of steering and speed-maintenance ability and the ability to deal with hazardous situations. We compared driving performance when participants were not conversing to when they were conversing, as well as whether a more difficult conversation had a greater effect on performance than an easier one. Participants conversed with the experimenter over a hands-free headset. Conversations consisted of answering and conversing based on either easy (“small talk”) or difficult (“thought provoking”) questions. Participants drove a simulated car for approximately thirty minutes, with ten minutes devoted to driving under each of the conversation conditions (no talking, easy conversation, difficult conversation). During each of the ten minute driving sessions, participants were exposed to one of three hazardous events: an ambulance running a red light in front of the driver, an oncoming car swerving into the driver’s lane, and a parallel-parked car pulling out in front of the driver. A variety of variables were measured in the categories of speed maintenance (<b>accelerator</b> <b>position</b> variability, speed variability, average speed), lane position maintenance (steering offset, average lateral speed), crash avoidance (collisions, response time to hazardous events), and mental workload (RSME). Two double multivariate ANOVAs were conducted, and then planned contrast analyses were used to test how the conversation levels affected each dependent measure. While concurrently driving and conversing, participants had higher variation in their steering and speed than when driving without conversing. While driving and conversing, participants also drove at slower average speeds and reported having to exert higher mental effort. No significant differences between conversation and non-conversation conditions were found for collisions or response time to hazards. When comparing the difficult and easy conversation conditions, the only significant difference in driving performance was for speed variation—participants showed more speed variation during difficult than during easy conversations. The findings from this study suggest that having a conversation over a hands-free phone while driving may cause decrements in steering and speed maintenance performance. Also, people thought that talking on a cell phone while driving was more mentally demanding than driving while not talking. These findings suggest that regardless of conversation intensity, driving performance will be affected by this attentional distraction both through actual decrements in performance as well as in perceived distraction from the driving task. It seems to be something about the act of talking, as opposed to the content of the material, that is detrimental to driving performance. This is consistent with other research (Briem 2 ̆ 6 Hedman, 1995; Irwin, Fitzgerald, 2 ̆ 6 Burg, 2000; McKnight 2 ̆ 6 McKnight, 1993) that has found effects for conversations but little or no effect of varying conversational difficulty...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVESThe {{study was}} {{conducted}} to examine the efficacy of uni- and multi-modal proximity warningdevices for forward object collision and side-object detection for young and older adult drivers. METHODSTwo experiments were conducted, each with 20 young (18 to 30 years of age) and 20 older (61 to 80 years of age) healthy and high functioning drivers. In each, participants drove a series ofbrief (~ 4 minute) highway scenarios with temporally unpredictable forward and side collisionevents (i. e., other vehicles). The experiments were conducted in a fixed-base Drive Safetysimulator with a 135 -degree wrap-around forward field and a 135 -degree rear field. Light crosswindswere included in Experiment 1, while heavier crosswinds were introduced in the secondexperiment. A secondary visual read-out task from an in-vehicle LCD display was also includedin the second experiment. In Experiment 1, potential collision events were signaled 2. 2 seconds before impact by visual,auditory, auditory+visual or tactile+visual warnings that were spatially mapped to the location ofthe obstacle (left, right or center). A control condition in which subjects drove without anyproximity warning device was also included in the experiment. Experiment 2 included thecontrol, auditory+visual and visual warnings from Experiment 1. A number of dependent measures were collected, including velocity, lane position, steeringwheel movement, brake and <b>accelerator</b> <b>position.</b> However, we will focus on the response time(as measured by steering wheel deflections or removal of the foot from the accelerator) topotential collision events as well as the number of collisions in different experimental conditions. RESULTSIn both Experiments 1 and 2, the auditory+visual warning device produced the most rapidresponse and also resulted in the fewest collisions. The reduction in response time and collisions,relative to the no-warning control condition was larger in Experiment 2 than in Experiment 1, likely as a result to the more challenging driving scenarios (with the higher and unpredictablewinds and introduction of the secondary task) in this experiment. Older adults responded just as quickly as younger adults to the potential collision events in bothof the experiments. This is a very surprising finding given a voluminous laboratory literature,which suggests that older adults display slower responses than younger adults on almost any taskthat has been examined in the laboratory. In an effort to understand the age-equivalent response times to collision events, we asked youngand older participants from the first experiment to take part in an additional experimental sessionin which they made simple and choice responses to visual and auditory events in a soundattenuated subject booth. Older adults were substantially (~ 35 %) slower in each of these simpleand choice tasks performed in the laboratory. Older adults displayed the same performance benefits (in terms of speeded response time andreductions in collisions) from the proximity warning devices, and particularly theauditory+visual device, in both of the experiments as younger adults. However, in Experiment 2,older adults displayed these benefits by neglecting the number read-out secondary task. CONCLUSIONSThere are several important conclusions from the present study. First, proximity warningdevices, and particularly auditory+visual devices, can substantially speed response time andreduce potential collisions in simulated driving. This is an important observation that has thepotential to reduce automobile accidents. Second, both younger and older adults benefit from theproximity warning devices. Such a finding suggests, that at least for individuals with normalvision and hearing, these devices might have substantial utility across a wide variety of drivers. Third, quite to our surprise, older adult drivers responded just as quickly, with and without theproximity warning devices, to potential collision events as younger drivers. Interestingly, ageequivalencein response time to potential collisions was not observed in simple and choiceauditory and visual laboratory response time tasks. Such data tentatively suggests that experienceand expertise in driving may act as a moderator of age-related decline in general slowing. Given the unpredictable nature of the potential collision events in our study, older drivers may becapitalizing on high levels of vigilance and attentional focus on driving relevant tasks to maintaintheir ability to rapidly respond to collision events. This hypothesis is supported, in part, by thedecrements in secondary task performed observed for the older but not for the younger adults inExperiment 2. The results from the present study are encouraging both with respect to the utility of proximitywarning devices as a means to enhance driver safety as well as for their potential application todrivers of different ages and experience levels. However, clearly additional research will beneeded to verify these results in more challenging simulator and on the road driving situations...|$|E

The motorcyclists' mortality, compared to the whole of road fatalities, does not stop increasing in Europe since 1996 (CARE, 2007). These worrying data lead to two reports: (1) motorcyclists constitute particularly vulnerable road users who do not follow the general trends from road safety progress; (2) there is a specificity of powered two wheeler riding compared {{to other forms of}} driving. However, in the scientific research field, the efforts {{to a better understanding of}} the specific phenomena associated with riding are still limited (Amans et al., 2005; Baldi et al., 2005). Our article presents an ergonomics research program (2007 - 2010) which relates to motorcycle learning in France. The main goal is to propose a hybrid curriculum which combines traditional training and motorcycle riding simulator. The first perspectives of research identified by an exploratory ethnographic work are detailed in this presentation. A cognitive ergonomics approach applied to road safety, inspired by Villame (2004), is used in this program. It consists in a longitudinal study of riders during the training process at the driving school and after obtaining their riding license.

50|$|Physical {{analysis}} {{conducted on}} Toyota’s {{electronic engine control}} system including <b>accelerator</b> pedal <b>position</b> sensors (APPSs) in 2011 showed {{the presence of a}} significant number of tin whiskers. Tin whiskers are elongated or needle-like structures of pure tin that grow from pure tin and tin alloy surfaces. Toyota's APPS were found to use tin finishes. These tin finishes can produce conductive tin whiskers capable of creating unintended electrical failures such as short circuits. The use of tin finish in Toyota's APPS is therefore a cause for concern. Similarly in 2013, materials used in an automotive engine control unit (ECU) from a 2008 Toyota Tundra truck were analyzed. It was found that pure tin with a nickel underlayer was used as the connector finish in the unit, and analysis revealed tin whiskers on the connector surface. Further testing under a standard temperature-humidity cycling showed tin whisker growth, raising additional reliability and safety concerns. These studies show that poor design choices, {{such as the use of}} tin finishes, result in unintended failures.|$|R
40|$|Accurate and {{reliable}} beam position measurements {{are required to}} commission and operate the DARHT II <b>Accelerator.</b> The Beam <b>Position</b> Monitor (BPM) system developed for use on the DARHT II accelerator consists of 31 electro-magnetic detector assemblies, a computer network based data acquisition system, and custom analysis software. During an accelerator “shot”, each BPM uses arrays of B-dot detectors to intercept the electron beam’s changing magnetic field. Post shot analysis of the BPM data provides the beam current and position information used for steering and tuning subsequent shots. This paper will analyze {{the performance of the}} BPM system, now that several thousand beam shots have been achieved...|$|R
