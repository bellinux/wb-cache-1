5|$|As Han troops {{returned}} from the Han–Nanyue War in 111 BC, the Han government debated annexing Dongyue. Dongyue, under King Zou Yushan, had agreed to assist the Han campaign against Nanyue, but the Dongyue army never reached Nanyue. Yushan blamed the delay on the weather. The proposal to annex Dongyue was suggested by General Yang Pu, but was dismissed by Emperor Wu. The naval force <b>arrived</b> <b>home</b> without having attacked Dongyue. Zou caught wind of Yang's request, and responded by revolting against the Han. Han forces were led by General Han Yue, General Yang Pu, commander Wang Wenshu, and two marquises of Yue ancestry. The army crushed the rebellion and captured Dongyue in {{the last months of}} 111 BC, placing the former Minyue territory under Han rule.|$|E
5|$|As {{soon as he}} <b>arrived</b> <b>home,</b> Etty {{began to}} work on {{ensuring}} he {{had at least one}} picture ready for the 1824 Summer Exhibition. He decided to return to a theme for which he had created a sketch in 1820, that of the story of Pandora and in particular the passage in Hesiod in which the seasons crown her with a wreath. He had exhibited a sketch in 1820 on the same theme, and had already decided on the arrangement of the figures. His first attempt in 1824 was abandoned half-finished, and he began again on a smaller canvas with different positioning of the key figures of Pandora, Vulcan and Venus.|$|E
5|$|Bruce {{decides to}} reveal his secret identity. Before he can, however, Dent announces that he is Batman. Dent is taken into {{protective}} custody, but the Joker appears and attacks the convoy. Batman comes to Dent's rescue and Gordon, who faked his death, apprehends the Joker, securing a promotion to Commissioner. Rachel and Dent are escorted away by Michael Wuertz and Anna Ramirez, detectives on Maroni's payroll; Gordon later learns that they never <b>arrived</b> <b>home.</b> Batman interrogates the Joker, who reveals {{that they have been}} trapped in separate locations rigged with explosives. Batman races to save Rachel, while Gordon attempts to rescue Dent. Batman arrives at the building, but realizes that the Joker sent him to Dent's location instead. Both buildings explode, killing Rachel and disfiguring half of Dent's face. The Joker escapes the jail with Lau.|$|E
30|$|It {{should be}} noted that, {{commuting}} PEVs usually <b>arrive</b> <b>home</b> simultaneously during [16 : 00, 22 : 00] in the first 5 time-sections [28]. For PEVs <b>arriving</b> <b>home</b> in these periods, the ratio of commuting ones to non-commuting ones in each time-period varies considerably. As trip distances of commuting and non-commuting PEVs are somewhat different, CPs in each time-period of [16 : 00, 22 : 00] vary significantly. Thus, δ_is with i ∈ [33, 44] are set to 0.06. Besides, PEVs <b>arriving</b> <b>home</b> during [6 : 00, 16 : 00]∪[22 : 00, 3 : 00] mainly consist of non-commuting vehicles. Considering that the distributions of trip distances vary smoothly for non-commuting PEVs that <b>arrive</b> <b>home</b> in adjacent time-periods, the differences of corresponding CPs of them are small. Here, δ_is with i ∈ [13, 32] ∪ [45, 54] are set to 0.03. For the last two time-sections, δ_is are set to 0.03 as PEVs <b>arriving</b> <b>home</b> during time-periods in these two time-sections are usually non-commuting vehicles.|$|R

Duncan enters the room and they discover several videotapes which show Lilly {{having an affair with}} Logan's father, Aaron Echolls (Harry Hamlin). Veronica believes that Lilly found the tapes and refused to return them, which angered Aaron and he killed her; Duncan <b>arrived</b> <b>home</b> to find Lilly dead and had an epileptic fit, at which time Jake and Celeste returned home. While an unseen person watches them from a closet, Veronica calls Keith and tells him that she will bring home the tapes, noting that Aaron is at the party. Before she leaves, Veronica tells Duncan that they are not related. Meanwhile, Logan is drunk and stands on a bridge railing. Weevil and the PCHers arrive and they initiate a fight.|$|E
5|$|A {{couple of}} months later, the Gardiners take Elizabeth {{on a trip to}} the Peak District; their visit also {{includes}} Darcy's estate, Pemberley; Elizabeth agrees to go with them, believing that he is away travelling. Elizabeth is stunned by its wealth and beauty, and hears nothing but good things about Darcy from his housekeeper. There, she accidentally runs into Darcy, who has <b>arrived</b> <b>home</b> early. He invites her and the Gardiners to meet his sister. His manners have softened considerably, and Georgiana takes an instant liking to Elizabeth. When Elizabeth learns that her immature and flirtatious youngest sister Lydia has run away with Wickham, she tearfully blurts out the news to Darcy and the Gardiners before returning home. Her family expects social ruin for having a disgraced daughter, but over a week later they are relieved to hear that Mr. Gardiner had discovered the pair in London and that they had married. Lydia later slips to Elizabeth that Darcy was the one who found them and paid for the marriage.|$|E
5|$|Cynthia {{attributed}} {{the start of}} the marriage breakdown to Lennon's use of LSD, and as a result, she felt that he slowly lost interest in her. When the group travelled by train to Bangor, Wales in 1967 for the Maharishi Yogi's Transcendental Meditation seminar, a policeman did not recognise her and stopped her from boarding. She later recalled how the incident seemed to symbolise the end of their marriage. After Cynthia <b>arrived</b> <b>home</b> at Kenwood, she found Lennon with Ono and left the house to stay with friends. Alexis Mardas later claimed to have slept with her that night, and a few weeks later he informed her that Lennon was seeking a divorce and custody of Julian on grounds of her adultery with him. After negotiations, Lennon capitulated and agreed to let her divorce him on the same grounds. The case was settled out of court in November 1968, with Lennon giving her £100,000 ($240,000 in US dollars at the time), a small annual payment and custody of Julian.|$|E

5|$|Eldred {{arrived in}} Italy in July 1918 and {{eventually}} at Sub Chaser Base 25, located in Corfu, Greece in September 1918. There {{he served as}} a machinist aboard submarine chaser SC-244, where they patrolled the Strait of Otranto and were engaged in combat. While in Corfu, Eldred and many others got sick with the flu during the 1918 flu pandemic. The conditions at the hospital were so bad that he had to crawl to a stream to get water, which resulted in a permanent scar on his left hip. Eldred began his return to the United States and arrived in Malta on December 25, 1918. By February 1919, he was in Gibraltar. He was given the option of staying in the Navy until they <b>arrived</b> <b>home</b> in six months or being discharged and paying his own way home. He elected the discharge and was separated from the Navy on March 4, 1919. He met some U.S. Army soldiers who were en route to America aboard an Army troop ship. They took him aboard as a stowaway and loaned him an Army uniform. Eldred slept in a life boat {{on the way back to}} America.|$|E
5|$|During the Second World War {{the running}} of Gibb and Partners fell largely to Paton and James Guthrie Brown. Gibb and Partners gained {{a large number of}} {{government}} contracts and within a few weeks of {{the start of the war}} in September 1939 the workforce increased by 2000. Paton designed and sited several Royal Ordnance Factories; and in March 1940 travelled to Turkey to construct an iron and steel works there. Whilst in Turkey he was contracted to build emplacements to contain guns from mothballed battleships in the Dardanelles. The construction of the emplacements was completed but the guns would later be prevented from reaching the site by the Axis occupation of Greece. Paton made his way back to Britain via Greece, Italy and France and <b>arrived</b> <b>home</b> two days prior to the Italian declaration of war against the Allies on 10 June 1940. He also constructed a plant at Barry in South Wales for the extraction of Magnesium Hydroxide from the sea, a turbine factory for British Thomson-Houston Company and a £7 million underground aircraft engine factory. From 1943-44 Paton supervised the construction, in London Docks, of the precast concrete caissons required for the construction of Mulberry Harbours following the Normandy Landings. From 1944-45 he was in charge of the rebuilding of houses damaged by V-2 rockets in the London districts of Wanstead and Woodford.|$|E
