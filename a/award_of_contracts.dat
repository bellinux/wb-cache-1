40|$|Government {{departments}} procure a large {{variety of}} products and services in order to carryout its normal operational responsibilities and to implement various plans and policies. For effectively execution of these tasks the government asks for quotation (Request For Quotation) from different contractors.

5000|$|In {{order to}} uphold an affirmative action program under strict scrutiny, there must exist a [...] "strong basis in evidence" [...] of past {{discrimination}} by the specific entity {{to support the}} conclusion that remedial action is necessary.
