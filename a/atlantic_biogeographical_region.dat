This study compares the effects of biogeography and ecology to determine the plant diversity of European forests using a representative sample of 3100 plots all over Europe (BIOSOIL project). The general aim is to compare the effects of ecology and management with respect to biogeography. Total plant diversity was divided into different spatial components: plot, site, forest type (a proxy for ecological factors) and <b>biogeographical</b> <b>region.</b> Three hypotheses were tested: H 1 : The diversity accounted by the <b>biogeographical</b> <b>region</b> is higher that the diversity accounted by the lower scale components; H 2 : Beta nestedness is higher within than across <b>biogeographical</b> <b>regions,</b> while Beta complementarity is lower within than across <b>biogeographical</b> <b>regions</b> (after correction for extent). H 3 : Distance decay rate across <b>biogeographical</b> <b>regions</b> is higher than distance decay rate within <b>biogeographical</b> <b>regions</b> (after correction for extent). The results are used to understand how the different factors contribute to determine the forest plant diversity patterns and to get indication for future forest management...|$|R
40|$|Summer {{water stress}} {{is the main}} {{limiting}} factor for Pinus pinaster growth under Mediterranean climate, but no information on limiting physiographic and climatic factors under Atlantic conditions is available for this species. We hypothesize that water availability during the active period limits P. pinaster growth, with stands nearby the Atlantic-Mediterranean boundary being more sensitive to summer drought stress. We analyzed the inter- and intra-annual climatic response of this species at ten monospecific stands in a transitional area between the <b>Atlantic</b> and Mediterranean <b>biogeographical</b> <b>regions</b> in Galicia, NW Spain. Mean sensitivity of radial growth consistently decreased with increasing elevation, and growth variation was quite similar for the earlywood, latewood or total ring widths, suggesting a strong intra-annual coherency of radial growth. Growth patterns were site dependent and geographically structured, with three groups of stands showing different climatic responses. As expected for sites suffering from summer drought stress, water availability enhances growth in western and southern Galicia, showing negative responses to maximum temperatures and positive to water availability. In northern Galicia, away from the Atlantic-Mediterranean boundary, water surplus in the rainy seasons negatively influenced growth. This was {{probably due to the}} combined effects of seasonal water-logging stress and the reduction of solar radiation associated with cloudiness, which would limit photosynthetic rates in winter and spring. Local variations of water availability strongly controlled the physiological processes that determine growth dynamics of P. pinaster in NW Spain, contributing to its geographical structure and contrasting sensitivity.

40|$|The Iberian Peninsula {{constitutes}} the south-western {{limit of the}} European distribution of Fagus sylvatica L. However, although the Iberian North-West extreme {{would appear to be}} climatically suitable for the species, F. sylvatica is not present there. This fact has led to the suggestion that the species is not yet in equilibrium with the climate {{and that there is a}} migration lag in the post-glacial expansion of the species. The objective of this work is to understand the main biotic and abiotic factors driving F. sylvatica distribution and population dynamics in the Iberian <b>Atlantic</b> <b>biogeographical</b> <b>region</b> over recent decades. Furthermore, in the light of other studies which suggest that the expansion of F. sylvatica in North-Western Iberia might be related to the retraction of Q. petraea (Matt.) Leibl. forests, we also study the demographic trends of both F. sylvatica and Q. petraea along with oak-beech interaction processes to infer forest succession dynamics. Using data from the last two cycles of the Spanish National Forest Inventory (1986 – 2012) for the study area (the Iberian Atlantic biogeographical region); dominance, population structure, recruitment and basal area increment were analyzed in different forest types for the two target species. General linear models and Bayesian structural equation modelling techniques were also applied to study the direct and indirect drivers of recruitment and forest succession. Contrary to what might be expected under the current conditions of climatic change, the population of F. sylvatica in North-Western Iberia is expanding, the basal area increment of F. sylvatica increasing westwards and new recruitment occurring in the lowlands. Accordingly, the Iberian <b>Atlantic</b> <b>biogeographical</b> <b>region</b> may be considered one of the leading edges of F. sylvatica. Our results also identify an inter-specific relationship between Q. petraea and F. sylvatica which negatively affects Q. petraea. The findings demonstrate that Q. petraea forests are being replaced by F. sylvatica forests in North-Western Iberia. These results not only confirm a previous biogeographical hypothesis but also provide new leads for forest management and conservation strategies under current and future climatic conditions...|$|E

40|$|Background: Italian forests {{contains}} a high total diversity of plants species {{and this is}} likely due to the huge biogeographical gradients covered by the country (from the Alps to the Mediterranean) {{as well as to}} the long lasting human exploitation and management practices. This study aims to investigate the interactive effects of ecology and biogeography in determining the total plant diversity of Italian forests using a spatially representative sample of forests made of 201 plots sampled all over the country (CONECOFOR LI network). The general hypothesis to be tested is that the effects of present day ecological factors are less important than biogeographical factors in determining the total diversity of forested areas. The plant diversity of the sampled forest plan communities was divided into different spatial components, in particular: plot, site, forest type (used as a proxy for present day ecological conditions) and <b>biogeographical</b> <b>region.</b> Species presence absence was only used. The three following hypotheses have then been tested: Hypothesis 1 : The diversity component accounted by the <b>biogeographical</b> <b>region</b> is higher that the diversity accounted by the lower scale components (plot, site, forest type). Hypothesis 2 : Distance decay rate across <b>biogeographical</b> <b>regions</b> is higher than distance decay rate within <b>biogeographical</b> <b>regions</b> (after correction for extent). Hypothesis 3 : Beta nestedness is higher within than across <b>biogeographical</b> <b>regions</b> (after correction for extent); on the other hand Beta complementarity is lower within than across <b>biogeographical</b> <b>regions</b> (after correction for extent).

40|$|Aim: Climbing plants (lianas, vines, scramblers) are {{under-represented}} in many global datasets that underpin {{knowledge in}} functional trait biology, important for ecological theory, conservation and predicting forest dynamics under global change. To address this omission, we tested {{a set of}} hypotheses about how the traits of climbers vary with latitude and climate and amongst major <b>biogeographical</b> <b>regions</b> of the world using a comprehensive new, global dataset. Location: Global. Methods: Data on seed mass, leaf size, specific leaf area, climbing mechanism, dispersal mode, and growth habit were compiled for 1092 species in 34 countries. For each trait we: (1) quantified the strength of latitudinal gradients using analyses across species and across evolutionary divergences, (2) examined underlying relationships between trait variation and climate variables, (3) tested for phylogenetic signal in traits (the tendency for closely related species to exhibit similar traits), and (4) compared trait variation and phylogenetic clustering between four major <b>biogeographical</b> <b>regions</b> of the world (Africa, the Americas, Asia and Australasia). Results: We found highly significant relationships between latitude and four traits (growth habit, leaf size, seed mass and specific leaf area, SLA). Leaf size, seed mass and SLA also showed significant relationships with mean annual temperature and precipitation. However, no relationship was found between dispersal mode and latitude or between climbing mechanism and latitude. These results were largely consistent in cross-species and phylogenetic analyses. All traits, except seed mass, exhibited clear differences between <b>biogeographical</b> <b>regions.</b> SLA and seed mass {{were the only two}} traits that did not present a significant phylogenetic signal. Phylogenetic clustering was detected in species from the Americas and Africa, indicating that trait conservatism is important in broad <b>biogeographical</b> <b>regions.</b> Main conclusions: The functional traits and phylogenetic patterns of climbers differ between <b>biogeographical</b> <b>regions,</b> and from other better-studied plant growth forms. Species-level trait differences may hold the key to understanding why climbers are increasing in abundance in some regions of the world, but not in others. 15 page(s...|$|R
