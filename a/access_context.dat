The framework is grounded in psychological ownership theory and informed by interviews with thirteen participants. The theory considers ownership as a mental state in which users feel the object is theirs. The interviews explored this mental state under three contexts: traditional material possession, digital possession, and access-based possession. This work helps inform the meaning of possessions, and can aid designers and policy makers in how to approach the notion of designing possessions from a human-centered viewpoint...|$|R

End-to-end performance is evaluated when the TCP protocol is employed. The effects on TCP of access network protocols and of the burst assembly procedure performed at the ingress edge nodes are evaluated both in wired and wireless scenarios, with optical and electrical technologies. The influence of the assembly time out in the different <b>access</b> <b>contexts</b> is presented and numerical investigations are performed by means of ns- 2 simulations. Results show that end-to-end throughput is mostly influenced by the delay introduced by access protocols, which arises in the different scenarios, and by the assembly time out.

They are distinguished thanks to distinct signaling codes. Often, Walsh codes are considered for multiusers spread spectrum communications. Walsh codes of given length show very variable spectra, and thus, they fail to achieve an homogeneous robustness of all users signaling against multi-path fading that occurs during transmission. Classically, users signals are whitened {{through the use of}} a scrambling sequence that consists of a sequence with long period that is multiplied, chip by chip, with users' spread data [6].

The paper proposes and analyzes a new implementation structure, named frequency spreading, for the OFDM/OQAM transceiver. On flat channels, it is equivalent to the standard one in terms of input-output relations, though more complex. On multipath channels, it offers a crucial advantage in terms of equalization, which is performed in the frequency domain, leading to high performance and no additional delay. With its flexibility and level of performance, the analyzed scheme has the potential to outperform OFDM in the asynchronous <b>access</b> <b>context</b> and in cognitive radio networks.|$|E
