40|$|This paper aims {{to throw}} {{some light on}} {{problems}} of growth and employment that {{appear to have been}} somewhat neglected in the recent development of mainstream economics. As the subtitle suggests we shall make use of a framework of thought that might be called Schumpeterian, in honor of Joseph Schumpeter, who taught in Vienna and Bonn as well as at Yale and Harvard, and who deserves - as some people here in Kiel think - more credit than he usually receives in the shadow of Keynes. This system of thought emphasizes - a medium run time horizon, as distinct from the Keynesian short run and the classical, neoclassical, or Marxian long run; - the cyclical nature of capitalist development, rather than the notions of short run or long run equilibrium, as a basic postulate; the catallactic features of activity in the private sector and hence the information and coordination problems arising in decentralized systems - in contrast to a view which Hicks calls plutologist or social accounting Keynesianism (Hicks 1976); - active or dynamic competition of all sorts (Schumpeter's creative destruction) among entrepreneurs, whom Schumpeter (1912) defined as everyone who carries out new combinations; - autonomy, spontaneity, curiosity, experimenting, and-risk taking as essentials of human action under competitive conditions in business as well as in research - in contrast to the notion of perfect competition and its implicit situational determinism (Latsis 1976); - supply activities rather than demand mechanics, such as demand induced (accelerator) investments or multiplier processes. This approach certainly is supply oriented, in contrast to the demand bias of short run macro-economics. Effective demand is taken to be a consequence (multiplier effect) of private supply activities, i. e. of <b>autonomous</b> <b>investments.</b> A shortfall of demand can be explained in this framework as a consequence of unfavorable conditions for <b>autonomous</b> <b>investments,</b> including - a shortage of technological breakthroughs, - a shortage of factors complementary to investments, - institutional constraints, - a shortage of entrepreneurs, and - a distortion of relative prices depressing profits and profit expectations. ...|$|R

40|$|Trezzini (2015) {{presents}} a methodological approach {{for the study}} of the saving ratio that does not rely on normal capacity utilization positions. To explain the saving ratio he focuses instead on the fluctuations of consumption and investment. Precisely that focus requires I would argue a different kind of approach. Once the traditional theory of saving is discarded, the ‘indeterminacy’ of the saving ratio opens the way to an analysis of the evolution of consumption, and of how that evolution affects aggregate demand. The generation and evolution of autonomous demand are matters of obvious relevance to the classical-Keynesian approach to the analysis of growth. In this comment I take Duesenberry’s criticism of demand theory as the first step for focusing on the evolving standard of consumption and <b>autonomous</b> (‘innovative’) <b>investment,</b> therefore addressing directly the investment-consumption relationship. It seems to me that in a framework centered on the pace of accumulation this is a more fruitful line of investigation.

It shows that borrowing by consumers can improve growth prospects {{in the short run}} by increasing consumer demand. However, in the longer run the effects of increasing consumer borrowing are ambiguous because, by increasing consumer debt, it redistributes income towards the rich who have a higher propensity to save, thereby possibly depressing aggregate demand and growth despite the borrowing-induced expansion. The problem may be exacerbated by financial considerations involving the increase of the interest rate due to greater borrowing, but these considerations are not necessary for it. The problem is more likely to occur when <b>autonomous</b> <b>investment</b> demand is weak, i. e. when borrowing-induced consumption increases are most required to counter tendencies towards stagnation.

40|$|Léon Walras (1874) {{already had}} {{realized}} that his neo-classical general equilibrium model could not accommodate <b>autonomous</b> <b>investment.</b> Sen analysed the same issue in a simple, one-sector macroeconomic model of a closed economy. He showed that fixing investment in the model, built strictly on neo-classical assumptions, would make the system overdetermined, thus, one should loosen some neo-classical condition of competitive equilibrium. He analysed three not neo-classical “closure options”, which could make the model well determined {{in the case of}} fixed investment. Others later extended his list and it showed that the closure dilemma arises in the more complex computable general equilibrium (CGE) models as well, as does the choice of adjustment mechanism assumed to bring about equilibrium at the macro level. By means of numerical models, it was also illustrated that the adopted closure rule can significantly affect the results of policy simulations based on a CGE model. Despite these warnings, the issue of macro closure is often neglected in policy simulations. It is, therefore, worth revisiting the issue and demonstrating by further examples its importance, as well as pointing out that the closure problem in the CGE models extends well beyond {{the problem of how to}} incorporate <b>autonomous</b> <b>investment</b> into a CGE model. Several closure rules are discussed in this paper and their diverse outcomes are illustrated by numerical models calibrated on statistical data. First, the analyses is done in a one-sector model, similar to Sen’s, but extended into a model of an open economy. Next, the same analyses are repeated using a fully-fledged multisectoral CGE model, calibrated on the same statistical data. Comparing the results obtained by the two models it is shown that although, using the same closure option, they generate quite similar results in terms of the direction and – to a somewhat lesser extent – of the magnitude of change in the main macro variables, the predictions of the multi-sectoral CGE model are clearly more realistic and balanced...|$|E

The induced <b>investments</b> exceed the <b>autonomous</b> ones, the <b>investments</b> have strong sensitiveness to the total directions of the growth and the often changes in it.

In various statements, the Government has indicated its view that monetary policy needs to be tight in order to subdue an 'excessively high' {{rate of growth of}} domestic demand.

A number of scenarios based on alternative settings of monetary policy in 1989 - 90 are derived from a short-term simulation model of the Australian economy. The scenarios suggest that, if monetary policy remains at the current degree of tightness, the Australian economy may well experience a recession in 1989 - 90.

40|$|Financial {{globalisation}} is hypothetically {{helpful to}} a country {{to the extent that}} capital inflows augment available domestic savings for investment purposes.

Using the Kaopen (Capital opening index) and average exchange rates measures of financial globalisation the paper found that, for Nigeria, the greater the level of financial globalisation, the more Nigeria experienced capital outflows. Export is particularly positively impactful on capital outflows. Capital outflows have depleted available domestic resources and impacted domestic investment negatively.

Neoclassical and Schumpeterian economists regard technological unem ployment as a transitory phenomenon. This paper argues that the capital critique (i) demolishes the neoclassical claim that market mechanisms will restore full employment whenever workers are displaced by technical change, and (ii) rehabilitates the old Ricardian argument that automatic compensation factors are generally absent. The neo-Schumpeterian notion of <b>autonomous</b> <b>investment</b> is also rejected, in favour of the view that, in the long period, all investment is induced. By extending Keynes's theory of effective demand to the long period through a model based on the supermultiplier, this paper suggests that the ultimate engines of growth {{are located in the}} autonomous components of effective demand [...] exports, government spending and autonomous con sumption.

40|$|We {{introduce}} {{public expenditure}} (PE) {{in a general}} post Keynesian framework characterized by a non-linear investment function. Our aims are: 1) 	to provide a systematic analysis {{of the effects of}} PE (‘productive' or ‘non productive') on economic growth within a post Keynesian framework in which effective demand plays a crucial role. Our work fills a lacuna in the post Keynesian literature given that scant attention has been devoted to this topic (an exception is Pressman 1995). Concerning Kaleckian models, the few formalisations involve the effects of PE on growth only via government debt (You and Dutt 1996) or deficits (Lavoie, 2000). As it is well known, the analysis of the effects of PE within Endogenous Growth models started with the seminal work of Barro (1990) and it has been successively developed in detail within that approach. Following Barro (1990) ‘Productive' PE is such since it enters in the production function affecting average factors productivity. More recently, Devarajan et al (1996) question Barro's approach. Following these authors PE is ‘productive' whenever it affects (positively) the rate of growth. In our paper, ‘Productive' Public Expenditure affects the (fixed) coefficients of production/average factors productivity similarly to Barro. We should note that in our analysis, due to the so-called ‘paradox of costs' (defined later), not necessarily an increase in the average factor productivity (following an increase in ‘Productive' PE) implies an increase in the rate of growth; 2) 	to compare and contrast two post Keynesian approaches to endogenous growth, which stress the role of demand differently. The standard Keleckian approach is characterised by an <b>autonomous</b> (linear) <b>investment</b> function according to which investment is driven by i) (exogenous) long run expectations about the growth rate of demand; ii) expected profitability (proxied by the current rate of profit); iii) the expected level of demand (proxied by the current degree of capacity utilisation). The basic result of this approach is that in equilibrium effective demand drives growth. An important corollary is the so-called ‘paradox of thrift' according to which a reduction (an increase) in the average propensity to save of the economy, rising (reducing) the level of demand and the degree of capacity utilisation affects positively (negatively) capital accumulation and the equilibrium rate of growth of the economy. Introducing PE financed by income taxation and a balanced budged constraint, this effect could be induced by increasing (lowering) the tax rate. Another important corollary is the so-called ‘paradox of costs' according to which an increase (reduction) in the mark up and the redistribution in favour of profits (wages) reducing (increasing) the level of demand and the degree of capacity utilisation could dampen capital accumulation. With PE this effect could be induced by changes in productivity. In the Classical or Harrodian approach (as elaborated, among others, by Duménil and Lévy, 1999), long-run expectations are linked to saving decisions. The equilibrium rate of growth corresponds to the Harrodian ‘warranted rate of growth'. 3) 	to reproduce a variety of complex phenomena (multiple equilibria, hysteresis, low growth traps, regular and irregular growth cycles), not uncommon in the real world, by introducing a simple nonlinearity in the investment function in the spirit of Kalecki's (1937) investment theory – based on the principle of increasing risk –, Kaldor's (1940) trade cycle model and Goodwin's (1951) non-linear accelerator. The specific shape of the investment function, often employed in the literature (see for example Chang and Smith, 1971; Varian, 1979; and more recently Gardini et al., 2006) is such that capital accumulation increases with the current degree of capacity along to a ‘S' shaped curve...|$|R
40|$|Contributions {{are made}} by this paper in three areas, methodological, data creation, and empirical. The methodological section finds that, while {{structural}} model building exercises {{may be useful in}} suggesting lists of variables that may play an explanatory role in investment equations, they generally achieve identification of structural parameters only by imposing arbitrary and unbelievable simplifying assumptions and exclusion restrictions. The paper advocates a hybrid methodology combining guidance from traditional structural models on the choice and form of explanatory variables to be included, with estimation in a reduced-form format that introduces all explanatory variables and the lagged dependent variable with the same number of unconstrained lag coefficients. The second contribution is the use of a new set of quarterly data for major expenditure categories of GNP extending back to 1919. The data file also contains quarterly data back to 1919 for other variables, including the capital stock, interest rates, the cost of capital including tax incentive effects, a proxy for Tobin's "Q", and the real money supply. The empirical results support the view that there are two basic impulses in the business cycle, real and financial. The real impulse appears in our statistical evidence as an <b>autonomous</b> innovation to <b>investment</b> in structures. We interpret these structures innovations as due in turn to changes in the rate of population growth, episodes of speculation and overbuilding, and Schumpeterian waves of innovation. The financial impulse works through the effect on investment of changes in the money supply, as well as the real interest rate (in the case of postwar investment in durable equipment). There is a strong role for the money supply as a determinant of investment behavior, relative to such other factors as the user cost of capital or Tobin's "Q". The role of the money supply is interpreted as primarily reflecting the banking contraction of 1929 - 33 and the episodes of credit crunches and disintermediation in the postwar years. Another feature of the empirical work is the attention paid to aggregation. Coefficient estimates are more stable when four types of investment expenditures are aggregated along the structures-equipment dimension than along the household-business dimension. Historical decompositions highlight the role of autonomous innovations in structures investment and in the money supply, and an inspection of residuals suggests that the main autonomous downward shift in spending in 1929 - 30 was in fixed investment, not nondurable consumption. ...|$|R
40|$|The Socialist People’s Libyan Arab Jamahiriya {{is a small}} oil-producing {{developing}} {{economy in}} North Africa. Its economy depends heavily on oil revenue. Oil exports accounted for 92 - 97 percent of annual total Libyan exports and contributed 40 - 60 percent of annual GDP during the period 1963 - 2006. The Libyan economy, like other Middle Eastern oil producers, has been subject to several strong external shocks resulting from fluctuations in oil prices since September 1973. Economic conditions of the Libyan economy worsened in the 1990 ’s {{as a result of}} international sanctions. Since the ending of the UN sanctions in 1999, Libya has been implementing measures to reform and open its economy. Libya needs strong and sustained economic growth {{to meet the demands of}} its rapidly growing labour force, which require high investment in physical and human capital and an efficient use of the country’s resources. However, the achievement of these objectives depends on oil prices. The aim of this thesis is to find out the impact of the fluctuations in oil prices on the performance of the Libyan economy during the period of 1963 - 2004. The thesis tries to contribute to literature by examining the effects of fluctuations in oil prices on Libyan economic growth; Libyan investment; the patterns of Libyan imports and trade relationship with its major trading partners. This thesis also attempts to assess the impact of fluctuation in oil prices on the performance of the Libyan balance of payments. Many researchers devoted their time and skill in tackling problems related to trade and growth. However, the impact of fluctuations in oil exports on the performance of oil-producing economies came to the interest of some researchers only recently and more precisely since the oil embargo in late 1973. Despite the growing literature on the impact of fluctuations in oil exports on the performance of oil-producing countries in the Middle East, it appears that many gaps still exist in the current literature. In particular no attempt has been made to examine the impact of fluctuations in oil prices on the performance of the Libyan economy and in particular on Libyan economic growth, Libyan gross fixed capital formation, Libyan imports, the feedback effects in Libyan trade with its major importers and effects of fluctuations in oil prices on the performance of the Libyan balances of payments. Sophisticated economic models and econometric techniques have been utilized in this thesis in order to achieve its objectives. These models and techniques include single equation models, simultaneous equations models, forecasting models and co-integration analysis. The fluctuations in oil prices had very important effects on the Libyan labor force, sectoral employment, Libyan social and development indicators, contribution of various economic activities, Libyan expenditure, Libyan composition of foreign trade and Libyan balance of payments. The impact of fluctuations in oil prices on Libyan economic growth using the “export as an engine of growth model” and applying a “Koyck distributed lag scheme” suggest that there are spread effects from oil exports to the rest of the economy. However, when both the component and inflationary effects are excluded (but not the real gain from the rise in export prices) the results suggest no evidence of spread effects. This conclusion is supported by sectoral output analysis. The use of co-integration analysis to examine the long-term trade relationship between Libyan GDP and its oil exports suggest that there is no long-term relationship between Libyan oil exports and non-oil GDP. In other words, the two variables do drift too far apart from each other over time. The impact of fluctuations in oil prices on investment in the Libyan economy was assessed using an accelerator model of investment to capture investment behavior in the Libyan economy. It was revealed that the Libyan capital formation is strongly influenced by spending on components of aggregate demand other than investment and the downturn in oil prices had a serious adverse effect on investment. There seems to be an existence of some bottlenecks Also, investment in the Libyan economy was mainly <b>autonomous</b> public <b>investment</b> in infrastructure. To find out if there is a long-term relationship between investment and other components of aggregate demand (private consumption + public consumption + net exports) in the Libyan economy, the co-integration technique was used. The long-run elasticity of investment expenditure in the Libyan economy, with respect to Libyan expenditure on other components of aggregate demand, was higher than the short-run elasticity during the period of boom of oil exports. However, there is no evidence of long-term relationships between investment and other components of aggregate demand in the Libyan economy. The analyses of the trade relationship between Libya and its major trading partners, using a simultaneous-equations model, suggest that an increase in Libyan’s exports to a major trading partner contributes to growth in Libyan GDP. The increase in Libyan income expands its imports from its major trading partners. This in turn contributed to growth in the income of the trade partners. The level of Libyan imports from its major trading partners does not seem to have any significant effect on the level of the GDP of its major trading partners except Greece, Turkey and Tunisia. The relationship between imports of various commodity groups and per capita income in the Libyan economy during variety periods of fluctuation in oil prices were evaluated using two-digit SIT classifications and five forms of import income function. It has been indicated that the reduction in oil revenue during the period of low oil prices has completely upset the import-income relationship, which was developed during the boom years, while the rise in oil revenue has recreated an improvement in the relationship. Single and simultaneous-equations models are developed and tested to examine the impact of the external and internal forces on Libyan balance of payments. The results are used in forecasting the future behavior of this balance under various scenarios. The analysis indicates that the ratio of trade balance to GDP has fluctuated sharply with changes in the world price of oil. The decline in oil exports combined with deficit in the services balance and net current transfers depleted the gains from trade surplus in the Libyan economy. This resulted in a continuous decline in the current account surplus...|$|R

Alongside domestic (or <b>autonomous)</b> <b>investment</b> regime liberalization, Latin American countries have engaged in a large number of international negotiations dealing with investment matters. Virtually all of them are today members of the World Trade Organization, are party to one or more regional integration agreements featuring comprehensive disciplines on the protection and liberalization of foreign investors and their investments, and are parties to numerous bilateral investment treaties. This paper depicts the changing international landscape of investment rule-making from a Latin American perspective. It does so by looking first at the recent evolution of investment rules at the bilateral, regional and multilateral levels, pointing out differences and synergies between these closely intertwinned processes and the role that Latin American countries have had in shaping them. Against the backdrop of repeated failures at developing a comprehensive set of investment disciplines at the multilateral level, the paper reviews the main arguments that have been recently advanced in favor and against global rules for investment. The paper dissects the main reasons why investment fell off the negotiating agenda of the Doha Development Agenda at the WTO. It concludes by drawing a number of policy lessons regarding the most optimal institutional settings in which to pursue various elements of investment rule-making and sketches a few forward-looking scenarios on investment rule-making at the multilateral level...|$|E
40|$|As being {{experienced}} {{in many developing}} countries, Nigeria has been experiencing confirmed capital flight {{which has been a}} problem believed to have adversely affected domestic investment. The existence of this problem is further accentuated by the financial globalisation process which has enabled capital to flow more freely than before between countries of the world. This study examined the relationship between capital flight in Nigeria and investment during the period of financial globalisation with data from 1970 to 2007. The main variables used were exchange rates, investment, Kaopen, financial savings, external reserves and interest rate differential among others. Ordinary Least Square (OLS) technique is used in determining the significant variables in investment and financial globalisation, while Vector Error Correction Mechanism (VECM) was adopted to determine the long-term relationship between investment and capital flight. The study finds that the rate of exchange is significant in investment and financial globalisation but not significant in World Bank’s and Dooley’s estimates of capital flight. The different estimates of capital flight do not significantly impact negatively against investment though it has a long-term negative impact on external reserves of the country. The Dooley’s definition of capital flight is found to more significant in the Nigeria case than the World Bank’s as its impact is negative on the investment, though not significant. This signifies the role of errors and omissions in distorting the estimates of capital flight in Nigeria. The other determinant of capital flight is the interest rate differential in the co-integrating equation. Unusually, the Kaopen measure is significant in the Nigeria’s financial globalisation scenario, which calls for careful foreign exchange rate management to determine the rate of the exchange. The study recommends a cleaner floating of the domestic currency to reduce capital flight, the improvement of the business environment and an increase in the <b>autonomous</b> <b>investment</b> by both public and private sectors in the economy to induce other domestic investments, which will facilitate inflow of capital...|$|E
