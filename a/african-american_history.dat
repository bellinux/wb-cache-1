25|$|Barron {{believes}} that United States {{history is not}} accurately taught in schools, and has expressed interest in promoting <b>African-American</b> <b>history</b> throughout the New York City public school system. He has drafted legislation mandating the teaching of <b>African-American</b> <b>history</b> in required school curriculum. He has used his position as Councilman to propose renaming buildings and schools as well as decorating them with mementos of black history. He wishes to publicize black history greater, including erecting portraits of Martin Luther King and Malcolm X, as important leaders in American history. Barron proposed bills to honor America's African American heritage and such individuals as Malcolm X, Marcus Garvey, Frederick Douglass, Paul Robeson, and W.E.B. Du Bois. He drafted a bill which would have asked President George W. Bush to cancel all debts African nations owe the U.S.|$|E

25|$|Although African-American neighborhoods {{may suffer}} from civic disinvestment, with lower-quality schools, less-effective {{policing}} and fire protection, there are {{institutions such as}} churches and museums and political organizations that help to improve the physical and social capital of African-American neighborhoods. In African-American neighborhoods the churches may be important sources of social cohesion. For some African Americans, the kind spirituality learned through these churches works as a protective factor against the corrosive forces of racism.

500|$|The track {{ran into}} {{difficulties}} when Hempstead Washburne was elected Mayor of Chicago in 1892.

[...] It remained open until 1905, when the state of Illinois banned gambling and stopped all horse racing. By that time, {{the prestige of the}} club had declined, independently of Washburne's reform movement, because more modern and spacious golf courses drew the members to other locations, and the residential dispersion of elite members from the community area made the club less important. However, the stables used by the track were not torn down and currently form a portion of the DuSable Museum of <b>African-American</b> <b>History.</b>|$|E
