500|$|After a {{short period}} of preparation, the 20th Brigade's landing took place on 22 September 1943. It was the first opposed amphibious landing that Australian forces had made since Gallipoli. Navigational errors {{resulted}} in the troops being landed on the wrong beaches, with some of them coming ashore at Siki Cove and taking heavy fire from the strong Japanese defences in pillboxes and behind obstacles. After re-organising on the beach, the Australians pushed inland. The Japanese put up stiff resistance around the high ground at Katika, but were eventually forced back. By the end of the day, [...] having suffered 94casualties, the Australians had secured a beachhead [...] "several kilometres" [...] deep. Late in the day, a force of around 30Japanese bombers, escorted by up to 40fighters, from the Wewak-based 4th Air Army based was sent to attack Allied shipping around Finschhafen. Forewarned by the destroyer , which was serving as an <b>air</b> <b>picket</b> and fighter controller in the Vitiaz Strait, the Allies were able to concentrate five squadrons of US fighter aircraft over the convoy and in the aerial battle that followed 39Japanese aircraft were shot down and the raid turned back.|$|E

50|$|Henry B. Wilson sailed on {{her third}} {{deployment}} to the Far East 4 June 1965. Arriving Subic Bay, Luzon, 21 June, she became flagship for Destroyer Squadron 21, then began rescue and <b>air</b> defense <b>picket</b> {{duty in the}} Gulf of Tonkin 31 July, along with shore bombardment support. As escort for , she departed Subic Bay 7 November and arrived San Diego the 24th.|$|R
5000|$|Taciturn {{served in}} the Far East for much of her wartime career, where she sank a Japanese <b>air</b> warning <b>picket</b> hulk (this was the hulk of the {{salvaged}} former Dutch submarine [...] ), the Japanese auxiliary submarine chaser Cha 105, and a Japanese sailing vessel. On 1 August 1945, Taciturn, in company with HMS Thorough, attacked Japanese shipping and shore targets off northern Bali. Taciturn sank two Japanese sailing vessels with gunfire.|$|R
50|$|In the war K XVIII sank several Japanese ships. On 24 January 1942 {{the boat}} was {{severely}} damaged by Japanese depth charges {{and was forced to}} return to Surabaya to be repaired. While still under repair at Surabaya she was scuttled on 2 March 1942 in order to prevent the Japanese from capturing the boat. K XVIII was raised by the Japanese in 1944 and converted into an <b>air</b> warning <b>picket</b> hulk and deployed in the Madura Strait. On 16 June 1945 the hulk was sunk by the British submarine Taciturn.|$|R
5000|$|After trials {{with the}} new equipment, in late 1956, Ceylon was {{deployed}} to the Mediterranean where she provided beyond visual range gunfire support to suppress emplaced Egyptian shore batteries at Port Said {{in support of the}} British Army and Royal Marine landings. A Communication Officer on the cruiser, describes Ceylons bombardment as relatively brief, as the Egyptian batteries did not return fire. Later in the operation Ceylon served as an <b>air</b> direction <b>picket,</b> [...] having been withdrawn and the cruiser Jamaica lacking modern AW AD. Between 1956 and 1959 she served in the Mediterranean, Home Fleet and East of Suez.|$|R
50|$|A {{radar picket}} is a radar-equipped station, ship, submarine, aircraft, or vehicle used to {{increase}} the radar detection range around a force {{to protect it from}} surprise attack, typically <b>air</b> attack. Radar <b>picket</b> vessels may also be equipped to direct friendly fighters to intercept the enemy. In British terminology the radar picket function is called aircraft direction. Often several detached radar units encircle a force to provide increased cover in all directions. Airborne radar pickets are generally referred to as airborne early warning.|$|R
50|$|John A. Bole {{arrived at}} Okinawa on 29 June for picket and patrol duty; and, {{although}} ground fighting had virtually ceased, weeks of intermittent <b>air</b> raids and <b>picket</b> duty {{were still in}} store for the fleet. The ship remained off Okinawa until the Japanese acceptance of surrender terms on 15 August, then departed for the East China and Yellow Seas to support the occupation and {{to take part in}} minesweeping operations. John A. Bole joined a cruiser-destroyer force on 8 September off Jinsen, Korea, to cover the landings of troops at that important port. She remained until 25 September, and arrived three days later at Saishu To, south of the Korean Peninsula, to accept the surrender of the island and demilitarize it.|$|R
50|$|The Airline Pilots Association (ALPA) pilots' union fought New York <b>Air</b> vigorously, running <b>picket</b> {{lines at}} LaGuardia and Washington National and taking out {{critical}} {{ads in the}} New York newspapers. Suspected acts of vandalism, interference, and prohibited aircrew operations were also reported by New York Air flight crews and managers. New York Air's representatives to the Airline Scheduling Committees (CAB-authorized committees of airline representatives that allocated takeoff and landing slots at capacity-controlled airports in New York, Washington, and Chicago) were stonewalled for months as they sought to get the necessary 'slots' for New York Air to operate their shuttle services between New York, Washington, and Boston. Eventually, however, the airline succeeded in overcoming all obstacles. New York Air service commenced on 19 December 1980 with shuttle operations between New York LaGuardia, Washington National, and Boston Logan airports.|$|R
60|$|About dusk, on the 3d of October, {{the army}} left its encampment at Matuchen Hills, by its {{different}} routes. Washington accompanied the right wing. It had fifteen miles of weary march {{to make over}} rough roads, {{so that it was}} after daybreak when the troops emerged from the woods on Chestnut Hill. The morning was dark with a heavy fog. A detachment advanced to attack the enemy's out-picket, stationed at Allen's House. The patrol was led by Captain Allen McLane. He fell in with double sentries, whom he killed with the loss of one man. The alarm, however, was given; the distant roll of a drum and the call to arms resounded through the murky <b>air.</b> The <b>picket</b> guard, after discharging their two six-pounders, were routed, and retreated down the south side of Mount Airy to the battalion of light-infantry who were forming in order of battle. As their pursuers descended into the valley, the sun rose, but was soon obscured. Wayne led the attack upon the light-infantry. They broke at first but soon formed again, when a heavy and well-directed fire took place on both sides. They again gave way, but being supported by the grenadiers, returned to the charge. Sullivan's division and Conway's brigade formed on the west of the road, and joined in the attack; the rest of the troops were too far to the north to render any assistance. The infantry, after fighting bravely for a time, broke and ran, leaving their artillery behind. They were hotly pursued by Wayne. His troops remembered the bloody 20th of September, and the ruthless slaughter of their comrades. It was a terrible mel√©e. The fog, together with the smoke of the cannonry and musketry, made it almost as dark as night; our people mistaking one another for the enemy, frequently exchanged shots before they discovered their error. The whole of the enemy's advance were driven from their camping ground, leaving their tents standing, with all their baggage. Colonel Musgrave, with six companies of the 40th regiment, threw himself into Chew's House, barricaded the doors and lower windows, and took post above stairs; the main torrent of the retreat passed by pursued by Wayne into the village.|$|R
5000|$|As a CBS affiliate, KSL-TV <b>aired</b> {{the drama}} <b>Picket</b> Fences at 11 p.m. on Saturdays instead of 9 p.m. on Fridays in the mid-1990s. The station {{has also been}} known to {{occasionally}} preempt some programs due to content that station management deems objectionable (many of these preempted programs are picked up for broadcast on CW affiliate KUCW, channel 30). The station {{has in the past}} declined to air the short-lived sitcom Coupling because of its sexual content, as well as much of NBC's poker programming such as Poker After Dark (which has since been canceled due to legal complications) due to ownership, Church and viewership objections against gambling. KSL-TV also preempted The Playboy Club upon its October 2011 debut (replacing it with the locally produced newsmagazine We Are Utah, which resembles WCVB-TV/Boston's Chronicle in format), on grounds that the series was [...] "completely inconsistent" [...] with the station's own mission and branding; KSL sponsors the [...] "Out in the Light Campaign," [...] which educates people on problems associated with viewing pornography, and the station {{did not want to be}} associated with the Playboy brand, even though the program did not specifically focus on the magazine nor include any nudity. The program aired on MyNetworkTV affiliate KMYU (channel 12)/KUTV-DT2 (channel 2.2) in its Monday 9 p.m. MT time slot until NBC canceled the show after three episodes. KSL continued to air already filmed episodes of We Are Utah in the 9 p.m. slot until the October 31, 2011 premiere of Rock Center with Brian Williams.|$|R
