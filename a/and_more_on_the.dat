5|$|Even {{though their}} most recent single was doing poorly, Deep Purple {{maintained}} {{a reputation as a}} fine live act in the US. The band had now begun to develop their stage presence into something grander, going in a louder and heavier direction and focusing more <b>and</b> <b>more</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> instrumental interplay between Blackmore and Lord. In particular the latter had found a way to short-circuit the original Leslie speakers of his Hammond organ C-3 and connect the instrument directly into the stacks of Marshall amps, obtaining a roaring sound and matching the guitar in loudness.|$|E
5|$|When {{the forms}} of {{traditional}} power come to an end, there {{tends to be a}} corresponding change in creeds. If the traditional creeds are doubted without any alternative, then the traditional authority relies more <b>and</b> <b>more</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> use of naked power. And where the traditional creeds are wholly replaced with alternative ones, traditional power gives rise to revolutionary power (Russell 1938:82).|$|E
5|$|By 1985, {{international}} {{isolation and}} economic hardships had forced Vietnam to rely more <b>and</b> <b>more</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Soviet Union for help. During the Chinese invasion in February 1979, the Soviet Union provided $1.4 {{billion worth of}} military aid to Vietnam, a figure that peaked at $1.7 billion in the period between 1981 and 1985. Then, to help Vietnam implement its third Five Year Plan (1981–1985), the Soviet Union provided a sum of $5.4 billion to the Vietnamese Government for its expenditures; economic aid ultimately reached $1.8 billion annually. The Soviet Union also provided 90 percent of Vietnam’s demand for raw materials and 70 percent of its grain imports. Even though the figures suggest the Soviet Union was a reliable ally, privately Soviet leaders were dissatisfied with Hanoi's handling of the stalemate in Kampuchea and resented the burden of their aid program to Vietnam as their own country was undergoing economic reforms. In 1986, the Soviet Government {{announced that it would}} reduce aid to friendly nations; for Vietnam, those reductions meant the loss of 20 percent of its economic aid and one-third of its military aid.|$|E

5|$|Despite reservations, Hitler {{remained}} {{committed to}} the offensive. He and the OKW, early in the preparatory phase, were hopeful that the offensive would revitalise German strategic fortunes in the east. As the challenges offered by Citadel increased, he focused more <b>and</b> <b>more</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> expected new weapons that he believed were the key to victory: principally the Panther tank, but also the Elefant tank destroyer and greater numbers of the Tiger heavy tank. He postponed the operation in order to await their arrival. Receiving reports of powerful Soviet concentrations behind the Kursk area, Hitler further delayed the offensive to allow for more equipment to reach the front.|$|E
5|$|Lady's Realm printed an {{assortment}} of Court and society news alongside articles on more daily tasks such as food, homemaking, and methods for female readers to earn money. It covered the London Season, displaying photographs of significant society figures and débutantes. It claimed to feature over 500 illustrations in each volume. Theatre was another regular topic of the magazine's, as was fiction, poetry, and reports on fashion. The Lady's Realms fashion editor Marian Pritchard regularly wrote articles on emerging fashions in London and Paris, and recommended locations where readers could buy them. While still featuring fashion and beauty, it also encouraged careers for women in music, art, business, and millinery. The magazine maintained this blend of topics relatively consistently, though it gradually made {{minor changes to the}} proportion it focused on different topics, for instance later focusing less on the nobility <b>and</b> <b>more</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> lives of clergymen and governors general.|$|E
5|$|Upon its release, Live from Paris {{received}} generally favourable {{reviews from}} critics, who praised it as a showcase of Shakira's versatility. One reviewer, however, criticised the singer for putting {{less emphasis on}} vocals <b>and</b> <b>more</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> dance routines. Commercially, the album performed well on the charts of France and Mexico, where it was later certified platinum by the Syndicat National de l'Édition Phonographique (SNEP) and Asociación Mexicana de Productores de Fonogramas y Videogramas (AMPROFON), respectively. In the United States, En Vivo Desde Paris peaked at number two on the Billboard Top Latin Albums chart, and at {{number one on the}} Latin Pop Albums chart.|$|E

25|$|The gloves {{can be used}} {{to block}} an opponent's blows. As a result of their introduction, bouts became longer and more {{strategic}} with greater importance attached to defensive maneuvers such as slipping, bobbing, countering and angling. Because less defensive emphasis was placed {{on the use of the}} forearms <b>and</b> <b>more</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> gloves, the classical forearms outwards, torso leaning back stance of the bare knuckle boxer was modified to a more modern stance in which the torso is tilted forward and the hands are held closer to the face.|$|E
25|$|The Enlightenment and {{the colonial}} era both {{changed the nature of}} European {{philosophy}} and exported it worldwide. Devotion and subservience to God were largely replaced by notions of inalienable natural rights and the potentialities of reason, and universal ideals of love and compassion gave way to civic notions of freedom, equality, and citizenship. The meaning of life changed as well, focusing less on humankind's relationship to God <b>and</b> <b>more</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> relationship between individuals and their society. This era is filled with theories that equate meaningful existence with the social order.|$|E
25|$|Anime is {{a diverse}} art form with {{distinctive}} production methods and techniques {{that have been}} adapted over time in response to emergent technologies. It consists of an ideal story-telling mechanism, combining graphic art, characterization, cinematography, {{and other forms of}} imaginative and individualistic techniques. The production of anime focuses less on the animation of movement <b>and</b> <b>more</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> realism of settings as well as the use of camera effects, including panning, zooming, and angle shots. Being hand-drawn, anime is separated from reality by a crucial gap of fiction that provides an ideal path for escapism that audiences can immerse themselves into with relative ease. Diverse art styles are used and character proportions and features can be quite varied, including characteristically large emotive or realistically sized eyes.|$|E

25|$|At {{the start}} of the 19th century a {{significant}} amount of rebuilding took place in what was by now a substantial Royal Navy Dockyard serving the fleet in the Caribbean. A sizeable storehouse with a clocktower formed the centrepiece, with a covered way leading from it to the careening wharves. The adjacent Port Admiral's (later Commodore's) House included a watch tower, to counter the threat of privateers. The Yard continued to expand to meet the new requirements of steam-powered vessels: the victualling wharf became a coaling depot in the 1840s, and twenty years later a small engineering complex was built. The Yard continued to expand through {{to the beginning of the}} 20th century, but then (with the Admiralty focusing more <b>and</b> <b>more</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> situation in Europe) the Navy withdrew from its station in Jamaica and the Dockyard closed in 1905.|$|E
25|$|In {{the late}} 1930s, John W. Campbell became editor of Astounding Science Fiction, and a {{critical}} mass of new writers emerged in New York City in a group called the Futurians, including Isaac Asimov, Damon Knight, Donald A. Wollheim, Frederik Pohl, James Blish, Judith Merril, and others. Other important writers during this period include E.E. (Doc) Smith, Robert A. Heinlein, Arthur C. Clarke, Olaf Stapledon, and A. E. van Vogt. Working outside the Campbell influence were Ray Bradbury and Stanisław Lem. Campbell's tenure at Astounding is considered to be the beginning of the Golden Age of science fiction, characterized by hard SF stories celebrating scientific achievement and progress. This lasted until post-war technological advances, new magazines such as Galaxy, edited by H. L. Gold, and a new generation of writers began writing stories with less emphasis on the hard sciences <b>and</b> <b>more</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> social sciences.|$|E
25|$|In the Arthurian Grail material, the Wasteland's {{condition}} is usually {{tied to the}} impotence of its leader. Often the infirmity is preceded by some form of the Dolorous Stroke, in which the king is injured tragically for his sins but kept alive by the Grail. In Chrétien de Troyes' Perceval, the Story of the Grail, the Fisher King has been wounded in a misfortune that is not revealed in the incomplete text, and his land suffers with him. He can be healed only if the hero Perceval asks the appropriate question about whom the Grail serves, but warned against talking too much, Perceval remains silent. In the First Continuation of Chrétien's work, the anonymous author recounts how Gawain partially heals the land, but is not destined to complete the restoration. Over {{the course of time}} romances place less emphasis on the Wasteland <b>and</b> <b>more</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> king's wound. In the Lancelot-Grail Cycle the link between the devastated land and the wounded king is not absolute, and in the Post-Vulgate Cycle much more emphasis is placed on King Pellehan's injury by Sir Balin than on the devastation this causes to his kingdom.|$|E

500|$|The State Anthem of the Russian Federation [...] (...) [...] is {{the name}} of the {{official}} national anthem of Russia. Its musical composition and some of its lyrics were adopted from the State Anthem of the Soviet Union, composed by Alexander Alexandrov, and lyricists Sergey Mikhalkov and Gabriel El-Registan. The Soviet anthem was used from 1944, replacing [...] "The Internationale" [...] with a more Sovietcentric and Russiacentric song. The anthem had no lyrics after 1956, due to the original lyrics having references to former leader Joseph Stalin. New lyrics were introduced in 1977 by Mikhalkov with lyrics placing less emphasis on World War II <b>and</b> <b>more</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> victory of communism.|$|E

He summed up this aspect by saying, [...] "A nation that continues year after year to spend more money on military defense than on programs of social uplift is approaching spiritual death." [...] He stated that North Vietnam [...] "did not begin to send in any large number of supplies or men until American forces had arrived in the tens of thousands", and accused the U.S. of having killed a million Vietnamese, [...] "mostly children." ...|$|E
