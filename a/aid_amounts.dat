To assess the impact of <b>aid</b> <b>amounts</b> received on college graduation while considering aid receipt status as an endogenous variable, I use the procedure of Instrumental Variable Probit.

It finds that the real value of ODA has declined during the 1990 s following two decades of relative stability. The share of foreign aid to Sub-Saharan Africa has fallen during the 1990 s and aid flows to low-income countries have also declined, {{partly as a result of}} the diversion of aid flows to transition economies and ¡®trouble spots¡¯. The paper also finds that donor aid programs are thinly spread over many recipients. However, reductions in <b>aid</b> <b>amounts</b> have been accompanied by improvements in the quality of aid. The financial terms of aid have improved and there has been a move towards the untying of aid. Official Development Assistance, Bilateral Aid, Multilateral Aid...|$|E

40|$|We {{review the}} aid {{effectiveness}} literature {{to assess whether}} foreign aid given to areas of limited statehood {{can be expected to}} promote economic and social outcomes in the recipient country. We distinguish different types of aid, motives for granting it, recipient country policies and characteristics, and modalities by which aid is delivered, as these factors have been argued to influence the effectiveness of aid. In short, aid is most likely to be successful if given for non-strategic motives, and if given to recipient countries with 2 ̆ 01 cgood 2 ̆ 01 d policies and democratic institutions. Fragmented aid and <b>aid</b> <b>amounts</b> that exceed the absorptive capacity of the recipient reduce the effectiveness of aid. We then compare these properties between recipients most affected by limited statehood and those least affected. This allows us to assess the relative effectiveness of aid in countries with areas of limited statehood.

40|$|The {{contributions}} of educational ind. cators tc {{the eighth grade}} passing rates on the Minimum Performance Test (MPT) for Arkansas ' 329 school districts for the 1987 - 88 school year were investigated. The variables/educational indicators reported in this study included: school district size in terms of average daily attendance, number of teachers with master's degrees, various fiscal characteristics, outside <b>aid</b> <b>amounts,</b> number of personnel, minimum foundation program aid, expense per student, eighth-grade MPT passing rates as percentages, and average personnel salaries. The correlation analysis addressed {{the question of whether}} any of the variables steadily increased or decreased as school district size increased. Analysis using multiple regression and Pearson correlation techniques indicated that none of the factors accounted for more than slight contributions to the variance in the percentage of s idents passing the MPT by district. These findings are consistent with numerous researchers, particularly those who investigated the relationship between school district size and achievement. It appears that calls for school district consolidation to effect enhanced academic achievement, {{solely on the basis of}} district size, are unfounded.

40|$|This paper {{estimates}} {{the percentage of}} students who do not take up their federal need-based student financial aid entitlements and sheds light on determinants of this behavior. Against the background that educational mobility in Germany is low although extensive student financial aid for needy students is available, it is crucial to know whether students assert their claims for student aid at all. To investigate non-take-up, we set up a microsimulation model for the German Socio-Economic Panel Study 2002 - 2013 and estimate the respective <b>aid</b> <b>amounts</b> students would have received, had they filed an application for need-based aid. The results indicate that about 40 % of the eligible low-income students do not take up their entitlements. We employ instrumental variable techniques and a sample selection model to consider several potential explanatory factors for this behavior. Our results suggest that non-take-up is inversely related to the level of benefits, though the elasticity is rather low. Apart from that, a shorter expected duration of benefit receipt is related to a higher non-take-up rate, whereas the possibility to draw upon older siblings' experience with completing the complex application for aid is associated with higher probabilities to claim. Moreover, we find robust evidence that significantly more students socialized in the former socialist East Germany choose to take up student aid than similar West German students. Finally, in line with behavioral economic theory, debt aversion of highly impulsive and impatient students is associated with higher rates of non-take-up...|$|E

40|$|In this study, I {{examine the}} {{influence}} of human rights considerations on the US foreign aid decisionmaking process during {{the war on terror}} and, for comparative purposes, prior to its onset. The findings indicate that respect for human rights has been negatively related to the yes/no decision to allocate economic aid and the amount allocated since 9 / 11. In other words, more economic aid has flowed [...] and more readily [...] to regimes with poor human rights records since the onset of the war on terror. The findings also indicate that human rights considerations failed to influence post- 9 / 11 military aid decisions. While these findings run counter to the Congressionally-mandated positive relationship between human rights and foreign aid, and my own expectations of American exceptionalism in the guise of human rights promotion, additional analysis indicates they were not a first. I also found that respect for human rights was negatively related to economic aid allocations under every administration since Reagan's and during the post-Cold War era. Only during the Cold War, and only for military aid, did better human rights practices increase the prospects of a regime receiving aid. In analyzing allocations to partners and non-partners in the war on terror, I found that human rights considerations negatively influenced decisions on economic <b>aid</b> <b>amounts</b> for both groups but only the yes/no decision for military aid allocations to partners. Looking across the models, and taking into account {{the influence of}} the control variables, one possible explanation for the lack of positive findings on the human rights variable becomes apparent: other, competing considerations [...] namely addressing recipient "need," promoting democracy, and confronting perceived threats to national security [...] regularly overshadow human rights concerns, leading US decisionmakers to extend aid to regimes with questionable human rights practices...|$|E
40|$|This study {{utilized}} an {{ex post facto}} {{design to}} examine the relationship between student persistence and receipt of financial aid in the non-traditional student population at a Southwestern Connecticut community-technical college. The sample population size was 739 and consisted of matriculated freshmen. Institutional databases were used to gather student demographic, academic achievement and financial aid information. ^ This study spanned a four-year period from the Fall 1994 through Spring 1998. A comparison of the persistence rates of non-aided students and that of aided students revealed that financial aid recipients persisted longer, but the differences in persistence rates were not statistically significant in the final study model. ^ An evaluation of aid types along with total <b>aid</b> <b>amounts</b> disclosed that loan recipients persisted at a much higher rate than grant recipients. Total aid amount was significant beyond the. 01 level. ^ Differences between persisters and non-persisters in relation to various demographic variables (age, gender, income group, and ethnic background); academic achievement variables (college grade point average, college program, placement test scores, and college enrollment status); and financial aid variables (type of aid, receipt of aid, and total amount of aid) were investigated using linear probability models with the maximum likelihood algorithms contained in the GLM Multivariate procedure in SPSS. Those models were further tested using logistic regression analysis. The number of semesters students persisted, along with the cumulative number of credits were also used to examine group differences to obtain a more complete and detailed description. ^ In the final model, the three variables, in order of importance, were cumulative grade point average, total amount of aid received, and enrollment status (full- or part-time). When cumulative number of credits earned was used as a criterion, the model accounted for 33 % of the total variability of persistence. ^ A logistic regression showed estimated income to also be a significant predictor. In this sample, the students in the lowest income group had the highest rate of persistence. ...|$|E
