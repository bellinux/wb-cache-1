50|$|The Lebanese are {{generally}} slim people, with increasingly <b>alarming</b> <b>weight</b> {{gain in the}} inner city areas. The current trend towards obesity is influenced due to the shift from traditional Mediterranean diets and lifestyles to fast food and an industrialized lifestyle, which is heavily focused in urban areas. Individuals who had a low level of education, non-working class, were non-smokers, and had a family history of obesity {{were more likely to have}} an unhealthy body weight. Although females at the Lebanese American University were more likely to snack between meals than their counterparts, they were subjected to the cultural notion that females need to be thin. Males did not have this societal pressure. Overall, however, the Lebanese in villages along the coastlines as well as the mountain settlements fare better with regards to body weight.|$|R

40|$|When {{studying}} {{the relationship of}} trace elements with human health, it becomes increasingly evident that keeping a balanced level of minerals in every cell {{of the human body}} may be crucial to optimising health and preventing disease. Dietary deficiencies of trace elements have been reported to alter various aspects of reproductive physiology, however, there is an <b>alarming</b> <b>weighting</b> towards studies focusing on their involvement in male reproductive function. Furthermore, those studies which are female focused have a tendency to investigate the role of trace elements in maintaining a healthy pregnancy, and the impact on offspring, as opposed to addressing preconception ovarian function. This research predominantly used a combination of two synchrotron-based X-ray techniques, X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) and X-ray fluorescence (XRF) imaging, to investigate the role that trace elements play in female reproductive function. More specifically, by probing the in situ bioaccumulation of trace elements in bovine ovaries, important findings were made regarding the distribution of iron (Fe), selenium (Se), and zinc (Zn) which were localised to specific structures. Additionally, widespread high levels of bromine (Br) were observed across all imaged tissues. By classifying the ovarian follicles according to their health status, as well as their size (follicular diameter), and extracting average elemental concentrations for these follicles from the XRF images, it was possible to quantitatively analyse the cohort of 97 imaged follicles. Statistically significant differences were found for the elements Fe and Br (health status), and for Se (size). Se appeared to be the element which most greatly distinguished large (> 10 mm) antral follicles from smaller counterparts and PCA scores plots supported this notion with the large follicles deviating {{from the rest of the}} cohort. Owing to the statistically significant and very precise localisation of Se to the granulosa cells of large healthy follicles, a suite of additional biologically-based experiments were performed (quantitative real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reactions (qRTPCR), immunohistochemical staining, and Western immunoblotting) in order to identify the Se species as glutathione peroxidase 1 (GPx 1). Taking into account what is already known about this selenoprotein, it was concluded that Se and selenoproteins may play a critical role as an antioxidant during late follicular development. There has been much debate about the essentiality of Br to human and animal life. Owing to its high levels across all ovarian tissues imaged, subsequent experimentation was carried out to probe the chemical form of this element. Analyses of the X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) spectra of a variety of mammalian tissues and fluids led to the conclusion that the form of Br in all samples, detected under normal physiological conditions, was bromide. The application of synchrotron radiation to measure trace elemental distributions in bovine ovaries at such high resolutions has provided new insights into this organ. While this research was intended to form a baseline study for healthy ovaries, if extended to disease states in the future, our understanding of the biochemical mechanisms occurring in this complex organ could be significantly enhanced.

40|$|Title from PDF {{of title}} page; {{abstract}} from research PDF (University of Missouri [...] Columbia, viewed on June 27, 2014). [ACCESS RESTRICTED TO THE UNIVERSITY OF MISSOURI AT AUTHOR'S REQUEST. ] In this thesis, a possibilistic K-nearest neighbor classifier {{is presented to}} distinguish between and classify mine and non-mine targets on data obtained from wideband electromagnetic induction sensors. The goal of this work is to develop methods for classifying wide-band electromagnetic induction data into one of several target classes or a non-target class. For some landmine detection systems, it could be necessary or helpful to discriminate between the several classes of targets, {{so that they can}} be analyzed and processed according to their specific properties. For example, it might be of importance to distinguish mines with high-metal content versus low-metal content or distinguish between anti-personnel versus anti-tank landmines. The proposed classifier achieves this goal using a method that is motivated by the observation that different buried object types often have consistent signatures depending on their metal content, size, shape, and depth. Given a sparse representation obtained using the joint orthogonal matching pursuits algorithm, particular target types consistently selected the same dictionary elements for their sparse representation. The proposed classifier distinguishes between particular target types using the frequency of dictionary elements selected by an <b>alarm.</b> Possibilistic <b>weights</b> are assigned for each alarm for sixteen landmine target classes as well as a false alarm class. The proposed classifier accuracy is compared to several state of the art methods and it shows improvement in discrimination results...|$|R

40|$|Podiatrists {{belonging}} to the Hospital of Vic need a rehabilitation device which measures the weight that a patient puts on his feet while undergoing rehabilitation. During rehabilitation, the podiatrist asks the patient to exert {{a certain percentage of}} his weight on his foot while he supports himself with a crutch. This percentage of weight will vary during the course of rehabilitation. The aim of this project is to develop a compact, cost effective, state of the art, dynamic weight measuring instrument for the Podiatrists to check if a patient puts the desired amount of weight on a broken leg during rehabilitation. The equipment currently available in the market is expensive, static and bulky. The approach followed to accomplish the target is by the use of sensors, microcontrollers, and display units for processing information and displaying the results. A buzzer is used as an <b>alarm</b> when <b>weight</b> is out of the safe range prescribed by the doctors. Possible outcomes besides dynamic weight measurement include posture correction, quantitative analysis of rehabilitation, ability to provide timeframe of recovery and ability to find the effectiveness of the treatment adopted by the podiatrist.

40|$|The {{number of}} successes 'n' and the {{normalized}} measure of space-time alarm 'tau' {{are commonly used}} to characterize the strength of an earthquake prediction method and the significance of prediction results. To evaluate better the forecaster's skill, it has been recently suggested to use a new characteristic, the gambling score R, which incorporates the difficulty of guessing each target event by using different <b>weights</b> for different <b>alarms.</b> We expand the class of R-characteristics and apply these {{to the analysis of}} results of the M 8 prediction algorithm. We show that the level of significance 'alfa' strongly depends (1) on the choice of <b>weighting</b> <b>alarm</b> parameters, (2) on the partitioning of the entire alarm volume into component parts, and (3) on the accuracy of the spatial rate of target events, m(dg). These tools are at the disposal of the researcher and can affect the significance estimate in either direction. All the R-statistics discussed here corroborate that the prediction of 8. 0 <=M< 8. 5 events by the M 8 method is nontrivial. However, conclusions based on traditional characteristics (n,tau) are more reliable owing to two circumstances: 'tau' is stable since it is based on relative values of m(.), and the 'n' statistic enables constructing an upper estimate of 'alfa' taking into account the uncertainty of m(.).

40|$|Objective. Although {{behavioural}} {{interventions are}} successful in achieving short-term weight loss, most individuals regain {{most or all of}} their weight within a few years. Our aim was to investigate factors that can help in long-term weight maintenance. Design. Qualitative interviews were conducted in order to elicit experiences, successes, and difficulties associated with weight control over the lifespan. Methods. Participants were 20 adult volunteers (aged 30 - 67) including lifelong weight maintainers, active weight maintainers who have maintained weight loss, and weight gainers. Thematic analysis was used to highlight differences between weight groups. Results. Successful weight maintainers adopt a staged approach to weight management, including monitoring weight fluctuations and having a clear <b>alarm</b> signal for <b>weight</b> gain that triggers immediate action. They have several behavioural strategies for weight control, comprising relatively small adjustments to diet and/or exercise behaviour and also have clear strategies for coping with lifestyle interruptions. In contrast, unsuccessful weight maintainers display negative cognitive factors, including erratic or inconsistent weight vigilance, failure to respond to warning signs of weight gain, and failure to restrict weight unless in a positive mindset. Further, their coping strategies for weight gain or failed actions are poor. Conclusions. The results suggest that successful weight maintainers, irrespective of current weight band, adopt a staged behavioural approach to weight management that allows them to maintain a fairly stable weight. Encouraging the use of such strategies in those who typically regain weight after dieting may aid them in maintaining weight loss...|$|R
40|$|Irritable bowel {{syndrome}} (IBS) is {{the most}} frequently diagnosed functional gastrointestinal disorder in primary and secondary care. It is characterised by abdominal discomfort, pain and changes in bowel habits that can have a serious impact on the patient's quality of life. The pathophysiology of IBS is not yet completely clear. Genetic, immune, environmental, inflammatory, neurological and psychological factors, in addition to visceral hypersensitivity, can all play an important role, one that most likely involves the complex interactions between the gut and the brain (gut-brain axis). The diagnosis of IBS can only {{be made on the}} basis of the symptoms of the Rome III criteria. Because the probability of organic disease in patients fulfilling the IBS criteria is very low, a careful medical history is critical and should pay particular attention to the possible comorbidities. Nevertheless, the severity of the patient's symptoms or concerns sometimes compels the physician to perform useless and/or expensive diagnostic tests, transforming IBS into a diagnosis of exclusion. The presence of <b>alarming</b> symptoms (fever, <b>weight</b> loss, rectal bleeding, significant changes in blood chemistry), the presence of palpable abdominal masses, any recent onset of symptoms in patient aged over 50 years, the presence of symptoms at night, and a familial history of celiac disease, colorectal cancer and/or inflammatory bowel diseases all warrant investigation. Treatment strategies are based on the nature and severity of the symptoms, the degree of functional impairment of the bowel habits, and the presence of psychosocial disorders. This review examines and discusses the pathophysiological aspects and the diagnostic and therapeutic approaches available for patients with symptoms possibly related to IBS, pointing out controversial issues and the strengths and weaknesses of the current knowledge...|$|R
40|$|Background: The {{prevalence}} of small intestinal bowel bacterial overgrowth (SIBO) {{in patients with}} irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) ranges from 43 % to 78 % {{as determined by the}} lactulose hydrogen breath (LHBT) test. Although rifaximine, a non-absorbable antibiotic, has been able to decrease global IBS symptoms as well as bloating in placebo-controlled randomized trials, these results were not repeated in phase IV studies in daily clinical practice. Aim: To assess the {{prevalence of}} SIBO in an IBS cohort and to evaluate the treatment response in the IBS cohort affected by SIBO. Methods: Enrolled patients were diagnosed with IBS using the following criteria: fulfillment of the Rome III criteria, absence of <b>alarm</b> symptoms (anemia, <b>weight</b> loss, nocturnal symptoms etc), normal fecal calproectin, normal endoscopic workup including histology. Celiac disease was excluded by serology and/or duodenal biopsy. All patients underwent lactulose hydrogen breath testing (LHBT) for SIBO diagnosis. Patients with SIBO were treated with rifaximine tablets (400 mg twice daily for 14 days). Both before and at week 6 after rifaximin treatment, patients completed a questionnaire, where the following criteria were assessed individually using 11 -point Likert scales: the bloating, flatulence, abdominal pain, diarrhea, and overall well-being. Results: Hundred-fifty IBS patients were enrolled (76 % female, mean age 44 ± 16 years), of whom 106 (71 %) were diagnosed with SIBO and consequently treated with rifaximine. Rifaximine treatment significantly reduced the following symptoms as assessed by the symptom questionnaire: bloating (5. 5 ± 2. 6 before vs. 3. 6 ± 2. 7 after treatment, p < 0. 001), flatulence (5 ± 2. 7 vs. 4 ± 2. 7, p = 0. 015), diarrhea (2. 9 ± 2. 4 vs. 2 ± 2. 4, p = 0. 005), abdominal pain (4. 8 ± 2. 7 vs. 3. 3 ± 2. 5, p < 0. 001) and resulted in improved overall well-being (3. 9 ± 2. 4 vs. 2. 7 ± 2. 3, p < 0. 001). Thirteen of the 106 treated patients were lost to follow-up (12 %). The LHBT was repeated 2 - 4 weeks after rifaximine treatment in 65 / 93 (70 %) patients. Eradication of SIBO was documented in 85 % of all patients (55 / 65), whereas 15 % of patients (10 / 65) tested positive for SIBO as determined by the LHBT testing. Conclusions: The results of our phase IV trial indicate that a high proportion of IBS patients tested positive for SIBO. IBS symptoms (bloating, flatulence, diarrhea, pain, overall well-being) were significantly diminished following a 2 -week treatment with rifaximine. These results support the previous findings of randomized controlled trials that the presence of SIBO is associated with symptom generation in IBS patients and that reduction and/or elimination of SIBO may help to alleviate IBSassociated symptoms...|$|R
