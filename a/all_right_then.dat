25|$|Agents arrested Loeser at 1127 South Harvey, Oak Park, Illinois, on Tuesday, July 24. O'Leary {{returned}} from a family fishing trip on July 24, the day of Loeser's arrest, and had read in the newspapers that the Department of Justice was looking for two doctors and another man in connection with some plastic work that was done on Dillinger. O'Leary left Chicago immediately, but returned two weeks later, learned that Loeser and others had been arrested, phoned Piquett, who assured him everything was <b>all</b> <b>right,</b> <b>then</b> left again. He {{returned from}} St. Louis on August 25 and was promptly taken into custody.|$|E
25|$|When I first {{played for}} South Australia, I did <b>all</b> <b>right.</b> <b>Then</b> I got injured {{right at the}} start of the second season â€“ I broke my nose and cheekbone in a fielding accident. I damaged my {{shoulder}} as well. I couldn't throw very well. Fielding has always been one of my main skills and I lost confidence in the fielding. I wasn't getting any runs, I wasn't bowling much in those days, and I wasn't fielding terribly well either. I ended up playing all of the first-class season and had a bad season. I still couldn't get runs in South Australia the following season but I'd go to England and get runs. I got dropped from the South Australian team.|$|E
25|$|Jimmy Lauderdale, on 139, {{was a bit}} {{puzzled by}} all this. But they were all new to the four-track, and he {{supposed}} it was <b>all</b> <b>right.</b> <b>Then</b> the signalman gave them a green flag from the box, so Lauderdale started pulling forward {{to see what he}} wanted. But the guard had spotted the down signals all off; thoroughly alarmed, he began running forward and shouting, and presently Lauderdale heard him and stopped. But it was too late then to do anything. The express was 200 yards away, coming 40 miles an hour. No. 139's crew cleared out and went over the wall, and the express went head on into 139. It was quite a bad smash. The guard and two passengers were killed. The fireman and another passenger died later. The driver escaped with severe bruising. There was very nearly another collision immediately after, for a Caley mineral from Lesmahagow was coming on the Down Goods line. Its driver saw the crash occur and managed to pull up just in time.|$|E
6000|$|McFarlane then said: [...] "I'll {{just take}} a little turn {{to see that the}} horses are <b>all</b> <b>right,</b> and <b>then</b> I think we'd better close in for the night." ...|$|R
60|$|He began <b>all</b> <b>right</b> and <b>then</b> {{something}} {{seemed to}} happen, {{and then he}} was finishing it. I cannot make out what he did with the middle of the story.|$|R
6000|$|Her {{good father}} {{surveyed}} her with complacency, remarking soon: [...] "She looks too hot--that's her walk. But she'll be <b>all</b> <b>right</b> presently. <b>Then</b> I'll make her {{come over and}} speak to you." ...|$|R
500|$|Bannings of Candide lasted {{into the}} twentieth century in the United States, where it has long been {{considered}} a seminal work of Western literature. At least once, Candide was temporarily barred from entering America: in February 1929, a US customs official in Boston prevented a number of copies of the book, deemed [...] "obscene", from reaching a Harvard University French class. Candide was admitted in August of the same year; however by that time the class was over. In an interview soon after Candides detention, the official who confiscated the book explained the office's decision to ban it, [...] "But about 'Candide,' I'll tell you. For years we've been letting that book get by. There were so many different editions, all sizes and kinds, some illustrated and some plain, that we figured the book must be <b>all</b> <b>right.</b> <b>Then</b> one of us happened to read it. It's a filthy book".|$|E
60|$|JENNY [supporting him] Come! pluck up. I'll get you {{something}} to eat. You'll be <b>all</b> <b>right</b> <b>then.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "All right! <b>All</b> <b>right</b> <b>then.</b> I won't. I won't {{give you}} {{anything}}. I can't give you {{anything you want}} from Natcha-Kee-Tawara." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Very kind of you, Japhet, but I {{wish that}} you had let me have my sleep out first. Now go down the line and see that <b>all</b> is <b>right,</b> <b>then</b> return and report." ...|$|R
6000|$|Mr. Letts started, {{and lost}} {{the thread of}} his discourse. [...] "I must {{have a look at}} him," [...] he concluded, lamely; [...] "he may be <b>all</b> <b>right,</b> but <b>then,</b> again, he mightn't." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "He said he'd marry me, {{he swore}} he was rich--and {{he was a}} spender <b>all</b> <b>right.</b> And <b>then</b> some guy {{came up to me}} one night at Gruber's and told me he was married already." ...|$|R
60|$|TANNER. [subsiding] It's <b>all</b> <b>right,</b> <b>then.</b> He's {{not going}} to act up to his principles. It's agreed that we all stand by Violet.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, that's <b>all</b> <b>right,</b> <b>then.</b> I reckon we're safe {{as long as}} we keep mum. But let's swear again, anyway. It's more surer." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That's <b>all</b> <b>right</b> <b>then,</b> {{my little}} Venus. And now if I had some dinner I'd {{sit down and}} make myself {{comfortable}} for the evening." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You go up--but you hadn't {{ought to}} hit em', if you're careful. The {{thing is to}} get hold of the first mine <b>all</b> <b>right,</b> and <b>then</b> you go on to the next, and so on, in a way o' speakin'." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Why," [...] {{acknowledged}} Richard, [...] "that {{may be true}} enough, my love. I rather feel it to be so. But I {{shall be}} able to give myself fair-play by and by. I shall come <b>all</b> <b>right</b> again, <b>then,</b> don't you be afraid." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, it {{was when}} I had {{a letter to the}} customs officer, and he said it would be <b>all</b> <b>right,</b> and <b>then</b> {{furnished}} me an inspector who opened every piece of my baggage just as if I {{had been one of the}} wicked." ...|$|R
6000|$|SOLDIER. That's <b>all</b> <b>right,</b> <b>then.</b> You keep 'er. I've got a {{laugh in}} me you can't put out, black as you look! Good-bye, little Daisy! ...|$|E
60|$|NORA. Yes, {{of course}} it was. Just take my arm, Mr Broadbent, while we're goin down {{the path to the}} road. You'll be <b>all</b> <b>right</b> <b>then.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... 'Oh, well, I {{suppose he}} will be <b>all</b> <b>right</b> <b>then.</b> Graham, just go across and report to the Headmaster, will you? You'll find him in his study.' ...|$|E
60|$|Once {{the rich}} are ruined, they are, {{as far as my}} {{observation}} goes, <b>all</b> <b>right.</b> They can <b>then</b> have anything they want.|$|R
6000|$|... --Hello. Yes, sir. No, sir. Yes, sir. I'll ring them {{up after}} five. Only those two, sir, for Belfast and Liverpool. <b>All</b> <b>right,</b> sir. <b>Then</b> I can go after six if you're not back. A quarter after. Yes, sir. Twentyseven and six. I'll tell him. Yes: one, seven, six.|$|R
6000|$|... "`Never mind, Jacob,' he said cheerily; `I {{shall be}} <b>all</b> <b>right</b> soon, and <b>then</b> {{we shall have}} the fight out--a little further from the black hole!' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, <b>all</b> <b>right</b> <b>then.</b> Take {{the forward}} car, {{next to the}} baggage-car. But I don't think you'll find any seats. We are swamped because of the land sale." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{can hold}} out {{until we get}} to the top, and I'll be <b>all</b> <b>right</b> <b>then.</b> It's {{gripping}} the brae with the side of my foot that bothers me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Not on your tintype it won't," [...] {{said the}} {{stranger}} decidedly. [...] "It won't be needed. Is Mr. Maude on your paper? That's <b>all</b> <b>right,</b> <b>then.</b> I can go ahead." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Let's {{go as far}} as Smuggler's Cove an' {{then turn}} 'round an' come back. If <b>all's</b> <b>right</b> an' shipshape, <b>then</b> we can start for the island." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I'm {{bound to}} leave that drawer open," [...] he said; [...] "I keep the things I use in that. They don't shut quite easily, these drawers; or rather, they shut <b>all</b> <b>right,</b> but <b>then</b> they won't open. It is the weather, I think. They will open and shut <b>all</b> <b>right</b> in the summer, I dare say." [...] He is of a hopeful disposition.|$|R
6000|$|... "Niver mind, boys, I'll have me supper now. Hi! who's bin an' {{stole it}} whin I {{was out on}} dooty? Oh! here it is <b>all</b> <b>right.</b> Now <b>then,</b> go to work, an' whin the pipes is lighted I'll maybe sing ye a song, or tell ye a story about ould Ireland." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] she said. [...] "I suppose it's only humane to {{give you}} a day or two to recover. <b>All</b> <b>right,</b> <b>then,</b> I shall expect you on the thirtieth at the latest." ...|$|E
6000|$|Stoller {{asserted}} {{himself to}} say: [...] "That's <b>all</b> <b>right,</b> <b>then.</b> I {{want you to}} be my guests, and I'll see about the carriages." [...] He turned to Burnamy: [...] "Will you order them?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, I did see him. I wish, Aby, you'd let me lie {{just for}} another hour or so. I'd be <b>all</b> <b>right</b> <b>then.</b> The jolting of that confounded car has nearly shaken my head to pieces." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Horrible, but not incurable," [...] remarked Fred. [...] "I'll {{give you}} some pills, boy, that'll soon put you <b>all</b> to <b>rights.</b> Now, <b>then,</b> who's next?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Ne'er mind, Ma; we'll be <b>all</b> <b>right</b> to you.' <b>Then</b> he {{bent and}} kissed her. 'Good night, Mother,' he said awkwardly, {{and he went}} out of the room.|$|R
6000|$|... "But he won't stay away," [...] {{returned}} Chet. [...] "He'll {{wait until}} he thinks everything is <b>all</b> <b>right</b> again, and <b>then</b> he'll sneak back, to live on you." ...|$|R
