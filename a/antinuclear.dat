5|$|Members of the Soviet military–industrial complex also opposed a test ban, {{though some}} scientists, {{including}} Igor Kurchatov, were supportive of <b>antinuclear</b> efforts. France, {{which was in}} the midst of developing its own nuclear weapon, also firmly opposed a test ban in the late 1950s.|$|E
5|$|There {{was also}} {{increased}} environmental {{concern in the}} Soviet Union. In the mid-1950s, Soviet scientists began taking regular radiation readings near Leningrad, Moscow, and Odessa and collected data on the prevalence of strontium-90, which indicated that strontium-90 levels in western Russia approximately matched those in the eastern US. Rising Soviet concern was punctuated in September 1957 by the Kyshtym disaster, which forced the evacuation of 10,000 people after an explosion at a nuclear plant. Around the same time, 219 Soviet scientists signed Pauling's <b>antinuclear</b> petition. Soviet political elites did not share the concerns of others in Soviet Union, however; Kurchatov unsuccessfully called on Khrushchev to halt testing in 1958.|$|E
5|$|Historically, many {{prospective}} Australian uranium mines {{have been}} constrained by active <b>antinuclear</b> opposition, but state governments have now approved mine development in Western Australia and Queensland. But {{it is unlikely}} that any new projects will enter active development until the market improves. As of 2013 uranium prices are very low. Cameco placed the Kintyre project on hold until market prices improve and Paladin has stated that its project proposals (Bigrlyi, Angela/Pamela, Manyingee, Oobagooma, and Valhalla/Skal) need higher uranium market prices before they can proceed. Toro wants to take the Wiluna proposal to the development phase, but has not been successful in attracting equity investors. When market prices go up again, so that mine development is justified, most projects would need at least five years to proceed to production.|$|E
25|$|<b>Antinuclear</b> {{antibodies}} (ANAs, {{also known}} as <b>antinuclear</b> factor or ANF) are autoantibodies that bind to contents of the cell nucleus. In normal individuals, the immune system produces antibodies to foreign proteins (antigens) but not to human proteins (autoantigens). In some individuals, antibodies to human antigens are produced.|$|E

25|$|<b>Antinuclear</b> {{antibodies}} {{are usually}} positive in drug induced Lupus. Anti-Neutrophil Cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCA) {{can also be}} positive in association with certain drugs. Furthermore, Anti-Histone antibodies can also be positive in drug induced lupus.|$|E
25|$|Animal tissue was {{the first}} {{substrate}} for immunofluorescent detection of <b>antinuclear</b> antibodies {{and has been in}} use since the late 1950s. Liver and kidney tissue sections from animals such as rats are used to identify anti-dsDNA antibodies. This substrate has largely been superseded by the use of HEp-2 cells.|$|E
25|$|Other {{conditions}} may mimic systemic sclerosis by causing hardening of the skin. Diagnostic hints that another disorder is responsible include {{the absence of}} Raynaud's phenomenon, a lack of abnormalities in the skin on the hands, a lack of internal organ involvement, and a normal <b>antinuclear</b> antibodies test result.|$|E
25|$|The first {{evidence}} for <b>antinuclear</b> antibodies arose in 1948 when Hargraves, Richmond and Morton discovered the LE cell. These abnormal cells, which {{are found in}} the bone marrow of persons who have SLE are categorised as polymorphonuclear leukocytes with phagocytosed whole nuclei. Subsequently, in 1957, antibodies to dsDNA were the first autoantibodies to be identified in patients with SLE.|$|E
25|$|On September 23, 2007, the <b>antinuclear</b> group Friends United for Sustainable Energy (FUSE) filed legal {{papers with}} the NRC {{opposing}} the relicensing of the Indian Point 2 reactor.

25|$|Other {{blood tests}} are usually done to {{differentiate}} from other causes of arthritis, like the erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), C-reactive protein, full blood count, kidney function, liver enzymes and other immunological tests (e.g., <b>antinuclear</b> antibody/ANA) are all performed at this stage. Elevated ferritin levels can reveal hemochromatosis, a mimic of RA, or {{be a sign of}} Still's disease, a seronegative, usually juvenile, variant of rheumatoid arthritis.|$|E
25|$|SLE is {{associated}} with defects in apoptotic clearance, and the damaging effects caused by apoptotic debris. Early apoptotic cells express “eat-me” signals, of cell-surface proteins such as phosphatidylserine, that prompt immune cells to engulf them. Apoptotic cells also express “find-me” signals, to attract macrophages and dendritic cells. When apoptotic material is not removed correctly by phagocytes, they are captured instead by antigen-presenting cells, which leads to development of <b>antinuclear</b> antibodies.|$|E
25|$|Blood {{tests can}} be done to {{determine}} if a patient has high levels of antibodies that are indicative of the condition, such as <b>antinuclear</b> antibody (ANA) and rheumatoid factor (because SS frequently occurs secondary to rheumatoid arthritis), which are associated with autoimmune diseases. Typical SS ANA patterns are SSA/Ro and SSB/La, of which SSB/La is far more specific; SSA/Ro is associated with numerous other autoimmune conditions, but are often present in SS. However, SSA and SSB tests are frequently not positive in SS.|$|E
25|$|<b>Antinuclear</b> {{antibody}} (ANA) {{testing and}} anti-extractable nuclear antigen (anti-ENA) form {{the mainstay of}} serologic testing for SLE. Several techniques are used to detect ANAs. Clinically {{the most widely used}} method is indirect immunofluorescence (IF). The pattern of fluorescence suggests the type of antibody present in the people's serum. Direct immunofluorescence can detect deposits of immunoglobulins and complement proteins in the people's skin. When skin not exposed to the sun is tested, a positive direct IF (the so-called lupus band test) is an evidence of systemic lupus erythematosus.|$|E
25|$|ANA {{screening}} yields {{positive results}} in many connective tissue disorders and other autoimmune diseases, and may occur in normal individuals. Subtypes of <b>antinuclear</b> antibodies include anti-Smith and anti-double stranded DNA (dsDNA) antibodies (which {{are linked to}} SLE) and anti-histone antibodies (which are linked to drug-induced lupus). Anti-dsDNA antibodies are highly specific for SLE; they are present in 70% of cases, whereas they appear in only 0.5% of people without SLE. The anti-dsDNA antibody titers also tend to reflect disease activity, although not in all cases. Other ANA that may occur in people with SLE are anti-U1 RNP (which also appears in systemic sclerosis and mixed connective tissue disease), SS-A (or anti-Ro) and SS-B (or anti-La; {{both of which are}} more common in Sjögren's syndrome). SS-A and SS-B confer a specific risk for heart conduction block in neonatal lupus.|$|E
25|$|A {{predisposing factor}} to {{developing}} DIL is N-acetylation speed, or {{the rate at}} which the body can metabolize the drug. This is greatly decreased in patients with a genetic deficiency of the enzyme N-acetyltransferase. A study showed that 29 of 30 patients with DIL were slow acetylators. In addition, these patients had more hydralazine metabolites in their urine than fast acetylators. These metabolites (byproducts of the interactions between the drug and constituents in the body) of hydralazine are said to have been created when white blood cells have been activated, meaning they are stimulated to produce a respiratory burst. Respiratory burst in white blood cells induces an increased production of free radicals and oxidants such as hydrogen peroxide. These oxidants have been found to react with hydralazine to produce a reactive species that is able to bond to protein. Monocytes, one type of white blood cell, detect the antigen and relay the recognition to T helper cells, creating <b>antinuclear</b> antibodies leading to an immune response. Further studies on the interactions between oxidants and hydralazine are necessary to understand the processes involved in DIL.|$|E

500|$|Progress {{was further}} {{complicated}} in early 1963, {{as a group}} in the US Congress called for the Soviet proposal to be discarded {{in favor of the}} Geneva System. On 27 May 1963, 34 US Senators, led by Humphrey and Thomas J. Dodd, introduced a resolution calling for Kennedy to propose another partial ban to the Soviet Union involving national monitoring and no on-site inspections. Absent Soviet agreement, the resolution called for Kennedy to continue to [...] "pursue it with vigor, seeking the widest possible international support" [...] while suspending all atmospheric and underwater tests. The effect of the resolution was to bolster the general push for a test ban, though Kennedy initially was concerned that it would damage attempts to secure a comprehensive ban, and had administration figures (including the Joint Chiefs of Staff) reiterate a call for a comprehensive ban. That same spring of 1963, however, Kennedy had sent <b>antinuclear</b> activist Norman Cousins to Moscow to meet with Khrushchev, where he explained that the political situation in the US made it very difficult for Kennedy agree to a comprehensive ban with Khrushchev's required terms. Cousins also assured Khrushchev that though Kennedy had rejected Khrushchev's offer of three yearly inspections, he still was set on achieving a test ban. In March 1963, Kennedy had also held a press conference in which he re-committed to negotiations with the Soviet Union as a means of preventing rapid nuclear proliferation, which he characterized as [...] "the greatest possible danger and hazard." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{proliferation}} of thermonuclear weapons {{coincided with a}} rise in public concern about nuclear fallout debris contaminating food sources, particularly the threat of high levels of strontium-90 in milk (see the Baby Tooth Survey). This survey was a [...] "campaign [...] effectively employed a variety of media advocacy strategies" [...] to alarm the public and [...] "galvanized" [...] support against atmospheric nuclear testing. Lewis Strauss and Edward Teller, dubbed the [...] "father of the hydrogen bomb," [...] both sought to tamp down on these fears, arguing that fallout [...] were fairly harmless and that a test ban would enable the Soviet Union to surpass the US in nuclear capabilities. Teller also suggested that testing was necessary {{to develop nuclear weapons}} that produced less fallout. While Teller would largely win the contemporary televised debates of 1958 with Linus Pauling, on technical grounds, The emotive [...] "media advocacy strategies", of which the tooth survey is a prominent example, were to cause support in the US public for a test ban to continue to grow from 20% in 1954 to 63% by 1957. Moreover, widespread <b>antinuclear</b> protests were organized and led by theologian and Nobel Peace Prize laureate Albert Schweitzer, whose appeals were endorsed by Pope Pius XII, and Linus Pauling, the latter of whom organized an anti-test petition signed by more than 9,000 scientists across 43 countries (including the infirm and elderly Albert Einstein). Although notably, many health scientists that were asked to sign were critical of Pauling's [...] "thoroughly unscientific" [...] fallout assumptions, despite most wishing for a test-ban for other reasons, they could not bring themselves to sign a document that promoted such exaggerations of the dangers, as it would result in eventual public distrust of scientists in the long term.|$|E

2500|$|In the 1970s, Nader {{turned his}} {{attention}} to environmental activism, becoming a key leader in the <b>antinuclear</b> power movement, described by one observer as the [...] "titular head of opposition to nuclear energy". The Critical Mass Energy Project was formed by Nader in 1974 as a national anti-nuclear umbrella group, growing to become the largest national anti-nuclear group in the United States, with several hundred local affiliates and an estimated 200,000 supporters. The organization's main efforts were directed at lobbying activities and providing local groups with scientific and other resources to campaign against nuclear power.|$|E
2500|$|In a defence {{debate in}} March 1970, {{he claimed that}} [...] "the whole theory of the {{tactical}} nuclear weapon, or the tactical use of nuclear weapons, is an unmitigated absurdity" [...] {{and that it was}} [...] "remotely improbable" [...] that any group of nations engaged in war would [...] "decide upon general and mutual suicide", and advocated enlargement of Britain's continental army. However, when fellow Conservative Julian Amery later in the debate criticised Powell for his <b>antinuclear</b> pronouncements, Powell responded: [...] "I have always regarded the possession of the nuclear capability as a protection against nuclear blackmail. It is a protection against being threatened with nuclear weapons. What it is not a protection against is war".|$|E
2500|$|The Soka Gakkai has {{attempted}} to take action on Toda's call through numerous initiatives. [...] In the 1980s, {{with the support of}} the cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, Soka Gakkai created the exhibition [...] "Nuclear Arms: Threat to Our World," [...] which attempted to raise public awareness of the grave consequences of nuclear weapons and toured different parts of the world. In 2007, [...] the Soka Gakkai International launched a grassroots <b>antinuclear</b> campaign called [...] "People’s Decade for Nuclear Abolition" [...] to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the <b>antinuclear</b> declaration made by Toda. The exhibition [...] "From a Culture of Violence to a Culture of Peace: Toward a World Free From Nuclear Weapons" [...] was created as its initial project. [...] The exhibition toured more than 230 cities in 31 countries and territories around the world and concluded [...] in Bahrain in March 2013. A new exhibition, [...] "Everything You Treasure – For a World Free From Nuclear Weapons," [...] developed {{with the support of the}} International Campaign to Abolish Nuclear Weapons (ICAN), aims to foster a deep awareness of the consequences of nuclear weapons by reexamining the challenges they pose from twelve different perspectives, including ecological integrity, human rights and gender. [...] The English-language version of the exhibition was first launched at the 20th World Congress of the International Physicians for the Prevention of Nuclear War (IPPNW) in Hiroshima in 2012. It has since been shown at ICAN’s Civil Society Forum in Oslo, Norway, in March 2013, and later at the UN Office at Geneva, during the Second Preparatory Committee (PrepCom) for the 2015 Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) Review Conference in April 2013.|$|E
