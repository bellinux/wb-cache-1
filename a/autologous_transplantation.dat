50|$|Treatment of {{plasma cell}} leukemia is by {{supportive}} care and systemic chemotherapy. Combination of cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone (or dexamethasone) can be used. A second combination {{is the use of}} cyclophosphamide, dexamethasone, and thalidomide as for myeloma. Another regimen termed VMCP/VBAP uses alternating vincristine, melphalan (M), cyclophosphamide, prednisone/vincristine, carmustine, doxorubicin, and prednisone polychemotherapy. In general, combination chemotherapy has resulted in median survivals of 18 to 20 months compared to 2 to 6 months when single agent therapy is used. There are anecdotal reports of excellent responses and 2- to 3-year disease-free survivals after autologous stem cell transplantation. <b>Autologous</b> <b>transplantation</b> may increase benefit from conventional therapy and high dose melphalan may prolong progression free and overall survival.|$|E
50|$|Gene therapy, as well as, {{bone marrow}} {{transplant}} are also possible treatments for the disorder, but each have their own risks {{at this point in}} time. Bone marrow transplantation is the more used method between the two, whereas researchers are still trying to definitively establish the results of gene therapy treatment. It generally requires a 10/10 HLA matched donor, however, who is usually a sibling. As most patients do not have this, they must rely on gene therapy research to potentially provide them with an alternative. CDA at both clinical and genetic aspects are part of a heterogeneous group of genetic conditions. Gene therapy is still experimental and has largely only been tested in animal models until now. This type of therapy has promise, however, as it allows for the <b>autologous</b> <b>transplantation</b> of the patient's own healthy stem cells rather than requiring an outside donor, thereby bypassing any potential for graft vs. host disease (GVHD).|$|E
50|$|Most {{stem cells}} {{intended}} for regenerative therapy are generally isolated {{either from the}} patient's bone marrow or from adipose tissue. Mesenchymal stem cells can differentiate into the cells that make up bone, cartilage, tendons, and ligaments, as well as muscle, neural and other progenitor tissues, they have been the main type of stem cells studied {{in the treatment of}} diseases affecting these tissues. The number of stem cells transplanted into damaged tissue may alter efficacy of treatment. Accordingly, stem cells derived from bone marrow aspirates, for instance, are cultured in specialized laboratories for expansion to millions of cells. Although adipose-derived tissue also requires processing prior to use, the culturing methodology for adipose-derived stem cells is not as extensive as that for bone marrow-derived cells. While it is thought that bone-marrow derived stem cells are preferred for bone, cartilage, ligament, and tendon repair, others believe that the less challenging collection techniques and the multi-cellular microenvironment already present in adipose-derived stem cell fractions make the latter the preferred source for <b>autologous</b> <b>transplantation.</b>|$|E

Here, using nonhuman primates, we found that the <b>autologous</b> <b>transplantation</b> of iPSC-derived neurons elicited only a minimal immune response in the brain. In contrast, the allografts caused an acquired immune response with the activation of microglia (IBA- 1 +/MHC class II+) and the infiltration of leukocytes (CD 45 +/CD 3 +).

40|$|Survival of myeloma {{patients}} {{has greatly}} improved {{with the use}} of autologous stem cell transplantation and novel agents, such as proteasome inhibitors, immunomodulatory drugs and monoclonal antibodies. Compared to bortezomib- and lenalidomide-based regimens alone, the addition of high-dose melphalan followed by <b>autologous</b> <b>transplantation</b> significantly improves progression-free survival; although an overall survival benefit was not observed in all trials. Moreover, follow-up of recent trials is still too short to show any difference in survival. In the light of these findings, novel agent-based induction followed by <b>autologous</b> <b>transplantation</b> is considered the standard upfront treatment for eligible patients (level of evidence: 1 A).
