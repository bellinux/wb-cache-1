5|$|As the {{war years}} went, the newspaper's {{finances}} gradually improved. The Norwegian state became more active in production and trade and contributed many advertisements.

From 1 July 1918, circulation once again increased to six days a week.|$|E
5|$|At {{the heyday}} of Reformation in the Commonwealth, {{at the end of}} the 16th century, there were about one {{thousand}} Protestant congregations, nearly half of them Calvinist. Half a century later, only 50% of them had survived, with the burgher Lutheranism suffering lesser losses, the szlachta dominated Calvinism and Nontrinitarianism (Polish Brethren) the greatest. The closing of the Brethren Racovian Academy and <b>a</b> <b>printing</b> facility in Raków on charges of blasphemy in 1638 forewarned of more trouble to come.|$|E

5|$|During {{the early}} and mid-20th century, print and media became a noted {{industry}} in Ashford.

The Letraset company set up an arts material factory in Ashford in the 1960s. It closed in 2013, following the decline of Letraset and the company's decision to relocate works abroad.|$|E

5|$|Perhaps {{the best}} known herbals were {{produced}} in Europe between 1470 and 1670. The invention in Germany of {{printing from movable type}} in <b>a</b> <b>printing</b> press c. 1440 was a great stimulus to herbalism. The new herbals were more detailed with greater general appeal and often with Gothic script and the addition of woodcut illustrations that more closely resembled the plants being described.|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} we propose a method that reverse {{engineers}} the aesthetic decisions made by <b>a</b> <b>print</b> maker to produce <b>a</b> <b>print</b> from <b>a</b> negative, namely cropping, contrast selection, and dodging-and-burning. It then re-applies this process to the electronic negative in order to achieve an electronic version of such print with better tonal range and detail than one produced by scanning the print. We then extend this method to restore <b>a</b> <b>print</b> by combining scans of different versions of the same image. 1...|$|R

5|$|Andrew Reed {{had five}} sons, {{the third of}} whom, Charles Reed (1819–81), was apprenticed in 1836 to a wool {{manufacturer}} in Leeds, Yorkshire, where he also became secretary of the local Sunday School union. Through this work he met Edward Baines, proprietor of the Leeds Mercury one of the town's two MPs. The Baines family had a strong tradition of public and political service; both of Edward Baines's sons followed him into Parliament, the elder, Matthew Talbot Baines, eventually reaching Cabinet rank. Charles Reed was attracted to the youngest Baines offspring, a daughter, Margaret, whom he married in 1844. By this time Charles had left the wool industry and returned to London, where he founded his first business, <b>a</b> <b>printing</b> firm.|$|E
5|$|As {{the rift}} between {{the players and}} Brown and between Modell and Brown grew, Modell fired Brown on January 7, 1963. A {{controversy}} developed over {{the timing of the}} decision amid a local newspaper strike, which limited discussion of the move. <b>A</b> <b>printing</b> company executive, however, got together a group of sportswriters and published a 32-page magazine fielding players' views on the firing. Opinions were mixed; Modell came in for his share of criticism, but tackle and team captain Mike McCormack said he did not think the team could win under Brown. Blanton Collier, Brown's longtime assistant, was named the team's new head coach, and Brown began to plan his next move as he continued to receive an $82,500 salary under his eight-year contract.|$|E

By 1958, Batista was under increasing pressure, a result of his military failures coupled with increasing domestic and foreign criticism surrounding his administration's press censorship, torture, and extrajudicial executions. Influenced by anti-Batista sentiment among their citizens, the U.S. government ceased supplying him with weaponry. The opposition called a general strike, accompanied by armed attacks from the MR-26-7. Beginning on April 9, it received strong support in central and eastern Cuba, but little elsewhere.|$|E

5|$|In the Middle Ages, Proba and {{her work}} were praised as {{examples}} of scholarship. Petrarch implicitly referenced De laudibus Christi in a letter discussing female geniuses, and in 1374 Giovanni Boccaccio included Proba in his biographical collection of historical and mythological women entitled De mulieribus claris. In 1474, the poem was published by the Swiss printer Michael Wenssler, which likely made Proba the first female author to have had her work reproduced by <b>a</b> <b>printing</b> press. During the Renaissance, Cento Vergilianus de laudibus Christi was printed many times (for instance, Italian scholar Filippo Ermini lists seven incunabula and fourteen 16th-century editions of the poem), and Proba's poem was openly admired by thinkers like John Colet and Maffeo Vegio.|$|E
5|$|Literature {{in early}} modern Scotland is {{literature}} written in Scotland or by Scottish writers between the Renaissance {{in the early}} sixteenth century and {{the beginnings of the}} Enlightenment and Industrial Revolution in mid-eighteenth century. By the beginning of this era Gaelic had been in geographical decline for three centuries and had begun to be a second class language, confined to the Highlands and Islands, but the tradition of Classic Gaelic Poetry survived. Middle Scots became the language of both the nobility and the majority population. The establishment of <b>a</b> <b>printing</b> press in 1507 made it easier to disseminate Scottish literature and was probably aimed at bolstering Scottish national identity.|$|E
