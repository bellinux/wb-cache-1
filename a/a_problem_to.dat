5|$|Because {{it is so}} {{far from}} the nearest major landmass, the {{ecosystem}} of Kohala has experienced the phenomenon of geographic isolation, resulting in an ecosystem radically different from that of other places. Invasive species introduced by man present <b>a</b> <b>problem</b> <b>to</b> Kohala's ecosystem, as they push native species out of their habitat. There are several initiatives to preserve Kohala's ecosystem. Crops, especially sweet potato (Ipomoea batatas), have been harvested on the Leeward side of the volcano for centuries as well. The northern part of the island is named after the mountain, with two districts named North and South Kohala. King Kamehameha I, the first King of the Kingdom of Hawaii, was born in North Kohala, near Hawi.|$|E
5|$|Britain, {{with its}} {{commitment}} to South Arabia and its base in Aden, considered the Egyptian invasion a real threat. Recognition of the republic posed <b>a</b> <b>problem</b> <b>to</b> several treaties Britain had signed with the sheiks and sultans of the South Arabian Federation. Saudi Arabia urged the British to identify themselves with the royalists. On the other hand, there were some in the British Foreign Office who believed Britain could buy security for Aden by recognizing the republic. However, Britain eventually decided not to recognize. Iran, Turkey and most of western Europe also withheld recognition. The republic did receive the recognition of West Germany, Italy, Canada and Australia, {{as well as the}} remaining Arab governments, Ethiopia and the entire communist bloc.|$|E
5|$|Generally {{grown as}} a hardy annual, lettuce is easily cultivated, {{although}} it requires relatively low temperatures {{to prevent it}} from flowering quickly. It can be plagued by numerous nutrient deficiencies, as well as insect and mammal pests, and fungal and bacterial diseases. L. sativa crosses easily within the species and with some other species within the Lactuca genus. Although this trait can be <b>a</b> <b>problem</b> <b>to</b> home gardeners who attempt to save seeds, biologists have used it to broaden the gene pool of cultivated lettuce varieties.|$|E
50|$|With {{ordinary}} polynomial-time many-one reductions, if we {{can describe}} a reduction from <b>a</b> <b>problem</b> <b>A</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>problem</b> B, then any polynomial-time solution for B can be composed with that reduction to obtain a polynomial-time solution for the <b>problem</b> <b>A.</b> Similarly, our goal in defining PTAS reductions is so that given a PTAS reduction from <b>an</b> optimization <b>problem</b> <b>A</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>problem</b> B, <b>a</b> PTAS for B can be composed with the reduction to obtain a PTAS for the <b>problem</b> <b>A.</b>|$|R

5|$|Opposition to the {{railroad}} line returning to service included {{that it would}} be as much of <b>a</b> <b>problem</b> <b>to</b> downtown traffic as the container trucks and that the noise would be a disturbance to nearby residents. As with before, however, trains are occasional and reserved for specialty loads, such as oversized loads and hazardous materials, which will be banned from the tunnel. It was also stated that the trains, which will be able to go up to 30mph on the newly renovated line versus the old limit of 5mph, will be able to cross Biscayne Boulevard in 90 seconds. The current plan is for the line to be strictly for intermodal services, with the project including a rail yard and station at the port, however, in the future a passenger station may be added.|$|E
5|$|The {{sycamore}} {{has been}} introduced to suitable locations outside Europe as an attractive tree for park, street or garden. These include the United States, Canada, Australia (Victoria and Tasmania), Chile and New Zealand, Patagonia and the laurel forests of Madeira and the Azores. At {{the time of its}} introduction it was probably not appreciated that its prolific production of seeds might one day cause <b>a</b> <b>problem</b> <b>to</b> the landscape as it spread and out-competed native species. The tree is now considered to be an environmental weed in some parts of Australia (Yarra Ranges, Victoria) and also Mount Macedon, near Daylesford, parts of the Dandenong Ranges, where it is naturalised in the eucalypt forests. The sycamore is also scattered in north-eastern Tasmania and also at Taroona, near the Derwent River, in southern Hobart. It is considered to be an invasive species in New Zealand, Norway, and environmentally sensitive locations in the United Kingdom.|$|E

The yield on capital might decline somewhat in percentage terms, while total net income from the increased capital holding increases.|$|E

Many hand held devices, such as tablet computers and smart phones, require complex shift sequences to enter special characters.|$|E
25|$|In December 1951, the North Hollywood Hospital and Sanitarium {{supervisor}} {{advised the}} Howard family that Curly was becoming <b>a</b> <b>problem</b> <b>to</b> the nursing {{staff at the}} facility because of his mental deterioration.

And Berthe Weil was right when she treated those who compared him/confused him with, a Steinlen or a Lautrec as idiots. He had already rejected them in their own century, a century we {{had no intention of}} prolonging. Whether or not the Universe was endowed with another dimension, art was going to move into a different field.|$|E
25|$|The Cathars' main heresy {{was their}} belief in dualism: the evil God created the materialistic world and the good God created the spiritual world. Therefore, Cathars preached poverty, chastity, modesty and all those values which in their view helped people to detach {{themselves}} from materialism. The Cathars presented <b>a</b> <b>problem</b> <b>to</b> feudal government by their attitude towards oaths, which they declared under no circumstances allowable. Therefore, considering the religious homogeneity of that age, heresy was an attack against social and political order, besides orthodoxy.|$|E
25|$|Kent Street Baths {{were the}} first baths opened by the committee. Construction began on 29 October 1849, with the laying of the first {{foundation}} stone. The baths were opened on 12 May 1851, however, the baths were not completed until 1852. The building was designed by D. R. Hill. The baths were close to the town centre and so received {{a good amount of}} water. However, this supply of water posed <b>a</b> <b>problem</b> <b>to</b> builders of the baths who found it difficult to prevent water from entering and flooding the construction site. The final cost of the baths was £23,000.|$|E

25|$|The 121 Africans {{presented}} <b>a</b> <b>problem</b> <b>to</b> Key West, {{which had}} only some 420 residents. In {{response to a}} rumor that a ship was being prepared in Cuba to attack Key West and take the Africans, Key West prepared to defend itself. There were also attempts by Americans to take by force or by bribery part {{or all of the}} Africans. After seven weeks, in March 1828, the Africans were transferred to St. Augustine, and delivered into the custody of the U.S. Marshal for the Eastern District of Florida, Waters Smith. Only 114 reached St. Augustine. Six had died in Key West, and one was kept by the captain of the revenue cutter that escorted the ship carrying the Africans to St. Augustine.|$|E
25|$|The Liverpool and Manchester Railway was the world's first {{passenger}} inter-city railway in 1830. Manchester Liverpool Road {{railway station}} is the world's oldest surviving railway station, having opened on 15 September 1830; the Stockton and Darlington Railway had opened in 1825. Chat Moss was <b>a</b> <b>problem</b> <b>to</b> constructing the railway, with Edge Hill Tunnel and Sankey Viaduct; {{the line was}} bitterly opposed by William Molyneux, 2nd Earl of Sefton. The Bridgewater Canal was the first recognised canal of the modern era. Francis Egerton, 3rd Duke of Bridgewater had visited France and noted their canals. John Gilbert had the innovative idea to use water pumped out of his coal mines to fill a canal from the Duke's Worsley mines to Manchester. It was designed by James Brindley and built in 1761.|$|E
25|$|Interactionism {{had become}} popular in America in the 1950s and 1960s as a {{politically}} radical alternative to structural-functionalism. Instead of viewing {{society as a}} system regulating and controlling the actions of individuals, interactionists argued that sociology should address what people were doing in particular situations, and how they understood their own actions. The sociology of deviance, which included topics such as crime, homosexuality, and mental illness, became the focus for these theoretical debates. Functionalists had portrayed crime as <b>a</b> <b>problem</b> <b>to</b> be managed by the legal system. Labeling theorists, by contrast, focused {{on the process of}} law-making and enforcement: how crime was constructed as a problem. A number of British sociologists, and some researchers in law schools, have drawn on these ideas in writing about law and crime.|$|E

25|$|Caterhams {{have very}} poor {{aerodynamics}} {{due to the}} blunt windscreen, open-wheel design, and open cockpit. At very high speeds, lift becomes <b>a</b> <b>problem.</b> <b>To</b> combat this, the CSR has several features that reduce lift by 50%. The front cycle wings are fitted closer to the tires to reduce turbulence. In addition, they have a small lip that angles air upward and creates {{a small amount of}} down force. Also, the new front suspension scheme reduces turbulence and drag formerly caused by the spring and damper units. The biggest enhancement is the vent added on top of the nose cone. On previous Caterhams, the air from the radiator caused turbulence by knocking against the engine and other parts on the underside. A plastic panel behind the radiator now directs air straight out through the vent, creating down force and reducing turbulence.|$|E
25|$|A {{divide and}} conquer {{algorithm}} repeatedly reduces an instance of <b>a</b> <b>problem</b> <b>to</b> one or more smaller instances of the same problem (usually recursively) until the instances are small enough to solve easily. One such example of {{divide and conquer}} is merge sorting. Sorting can be done on each segment of data after dividing data into segments and sorting of entire data can be obtained in the conquer phase by merging the segments. A simpler variant of divide and conquer is called a decrease and conquer algorithm, that solves an identical subproblem and uses the solution of this subproblem to solve the bigger problem. Divide and conquer divides the problem into multiple subproblems and so the conquer stage {{is more complex than}} decrease and conquer algorithms. An example of decrease and conquer algorithm is the binary search algorithm.|$|E
25|$|On December 12, 2005, the Supreme Court granted certiorari in Mohawk Industries, Inc. v. Williams, another {{civil suit}} brought under section 1964(c) of RICO. In this case, {{employees}} alleged that their employer, Mohawk Industries (Mohawk), violated RICO by knowingly employing illegal immigrants {{with the help}} of third party employment agencies. The larger job pool enabled Mohawk to lower the wages of its legal employees and thereby reduce its labor costs. The Supreme Court, on the same day as its decision in Ideal, issued a brief order stating that certiorari had been granted improvidently and remanded the case to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit for consideration in light of its decision in Anza v. Ideal Steel Supply Corp. Under the Ideal rationale, {{it would appear that the}} direct victim of Mohawk's RICO violations was the federal government, not Mohawk's employees. Therefore, Ideal may pose <b>a</b> <b>problem</b> <b>to</b> the plaintiffs' case in Mohawk.|$|E
