Microstructure and {{mechanical}} properties of X 70 pipeline steel with polygonal ferrite plus granular bainite were characterized using tensile tests, Charpy V-notch impact tests, drop weight tear tests, hardness tests and scanning electron microscopy. The results of experiment indicated that X 70 pipeline steel with polygonal ferrite plus granular bainite showed an excellent combination of high strength and toughness.

40|$|Corrosion {{problem which}} exists in {{every stage of}} oil and gas {{production}} has been a great challenge to the operators in the industry. The conventional carbon steel with all its inherent advantages has been adjudged susceptible to the aggressive corrosion environment of oilfield. This has aroused increased interest in the use of micro alloyed steels for oil and gas production and transportation. The corrosion behavior of three commercially supplied micro alloyed steels designated as A, B, and C have been investigated with API 5 L X 65 as reference samples. Electrochemical corrosion tests were conducted in an unbuffered 3. 5 wt% NaCl solution saturated with CO 2 at 30 0 C for 24 hours. Pre-corrosion analyses revealed that samples A, B and X 65 consist of ferrite-pearlite microstructures but with different grain sizes, shapes and distribution whereas sample C has bainitic microstructure with dispersed <b>acicular</b> <b>ferrites.</b> The results of the electrochemical corrosion tests showed that within the experimental conditions, the corrosion rate of the samples can be ranked as CR(A) < CR(X 65) < CR(B) < CR(C). These results are attributed to difference in microstructures of the samples as depicted by ASTM grain size number in accordance with ASTM E 112 - 12 Standard and ferrite-pearlite volume fractions determined by ImageJ Fiji grain size analysis software...|$|R

50|$|Composition {{control of}} weld metal is often {{performed}} to maximise the volume fraction of <b>acicular</b> <b>ferrite</b> {{due to the}} toughness it imparts. During continuous cooling, higher alloy contents or faster cooling generally delay transformation, which will then take place at lower temperatures, below the bainite start temperature, and lead to higher hardness. The efficacy of inclusions as nucleation sites in modern low alloy steel weld metals is such that fine-scale intragranular bainite can nucleate on them, both by continuous cooling and by isothermal transformation below the bainite start temperature. Some confusion has arisen in the literature, as this fine-scale intragranular bainite, which can resemble <b>acicular</b> <b>ferrite</b> in appearance in the optical microscope, has been called <b>acicular</b> <b>ferrite</b> by some researchers. See, for example.|$|E
50|$|<b>Acicular</b> <b>ferrite</b> is a {{microstructure}} of ferrite {{in steel}} that is characterised by needle-shaped crystallites or grains when viewed in two dimensions. The grains, actually three-dimensional in shape, have a thin lenticular shape.

50|$|Austempering is heat {{treatment}} that {{is applied to}} ferrous metals, most notably steel and ductile iron. In steel it produces a bainite microstructure whereas in cast irons it produces a structure of <b>acicular</b> <b>ferrite</b> and high carbon, stabilized austenite known as ausferrite. It is primarily used to improve mechanical properties or reduce / eliminate distortion. Austempering is defined by both {{the process and the}} resultant microstructure. Typical austempering process parameters applied to an unsuitable material will not result in the formation of bainite or ausferrite and thus the final product will not be called austempered. Both microstructures may also be produced via other methods. For example, they may be produced as-cast or air cooled with the proper alloy content. These materials are also not referred to as austempered.|$|E
40|$|In {{the present}} investigation, the {{influence}} of austempering temperature and time on the microstructure and dry sliding wear behavior of high silicon steel was studied. The test specimens were initially austenitised at 900 °C for 30 minutes, thereafter austempered at various temperatures 280 °C, 360 °C and 400 °C, for varying duration from 30 to 120 minutes. These samples after austempering heat treatment were subsequently air cooled to room temperature, to generate typical ausferritic microstructures and then correlated with the wear property. The test outcomes demonstrate the slight increase in specific wear rate with increase in both austempering temperature and time. Specific wear rate {{was found to be}} minimum at an austempering temperature of 280 °C, that exhibits lower bainite microstructure with high hardness, on the other hand specific wear rate was found to be slightly high at increased austempering temperatures at 360 °C and 400 °C, due to the upper bainite structure that offered lower hardness to the matrix. The sample austempered at 280 °C for 30 minutes offered superior wear resistance when compared to other austempering conditions, mainly due to the presence of fine <b>acicular</b> bainitic <b>ferrite</b> along with stabilized retained austenite and also some martensite in the microstructure...|$|R

The cast iron has been produced in one of Polish foundries. Copper addition {{in the amount of}} about 1 % has been introduced to the cast iron in order to obtain the pearlitic matrix. The mechanical properties (Rm, R 0, 2, A 5, HB) have been determined both for the as-cast state and after austenitizing at 960 °C combined with quenching at 290 °C for 90 minutes, and also after austenitizing at 960 °C followed by isothermal quenching at 290 °C for 150 minutes. It has been found that the thermal treatment, resulting in the cast iron matrix change from the ferritic-pearlitic one to the one composed of <b>acicular</b> precipitates of <b>ferrite</b> and residual austenite, causes a distinct increase in cast iron strength; after the thermal treatment it has reached about 900 ÷ 1000 MPa.

40|$|A bstract This study aims to {{investigate}} the effect of heat input of outside SAW weld on low temperature toughness(- 20 ℃) of inside SAW weld for API 5 L X 70 with sour gas resistance. As increasing heat input of the outside weld, low temperature toughness of the inside weld was decreased. Especially, {{in spite of the}} same heat input, the value of low temperature toughness was fluctuated.

These sections were divided with size and shape of dimple correlated with grain boundary ferrite and cleavage correlated <b>acicular</b> and polygonal <b>ferrite</b> in grain. Therefore, it was seen that these sections were two of final solidification area in the inside weld and the outside weld, no reheated zone and reheated zone in the inside weld.

Optical and electron microscopy were carried out to identify the precipitates, inclusions and constituents of the <b>acicular</b> <b>ferrite</b> microstructures.

The presence of vanadium in alloys suppressed the formation of a side plate ferrite and reduced the transformation of ferrite during an isothermal transformation.

40|$|A brief {{analysis}} of the methods of <b>acicular</b> <b>ferrite</b> formation as the most preferable structural component in the weld metal has been presented. The term «acicular ferrite» is meant as a structure that forms during pearlite and martensite transformation and austenite decomposition. <b>Acicular</b> <b>ferrite</b> is a packet structure consisting of battens of bainitic ferrite, there being no cementite particles inside these battens at all.
