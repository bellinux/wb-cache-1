In 2007, the African Union launched <b>a</b> <b>pan-African</b> <b>programme,</b> the Great Green Wall for the Sahara and the Sahel Initiative (GGWSSI) to reverse land {{degradation and}} desertification in the region, improve food security and support local people to adapt to climate change. Within the GGWSSI different kinds of projects have been implemented. In order to quickly evaluate the effectiveness of (a large number of) restoration and sustainable rangeland/agriculture projects, a methodology to remotely assess the biophysical impacts of diverse interventions is desirable. Within the Administrative Arrangement Technical and scientific Support to agriculture and Food and Nutrition Security we aim to develop a multi-scale remote sensing (RS) based approach to monitor the biophysical impact of sustainable agriculture and rangeland projects. Specifically, we propose to utilize a biophysical indicator obtained via satellite imagery and compare the difference between project sites and corresponding reference sites before and after the intervention. Besides this specific comparison between project and reference sites, the general state and development of vegetation and other parameters (like precipitation) on a larger scale are important information for project planning in general and the project impact assessment. This report focuses on this general analysis of vegetation and precipitation trends in north Senegal and provides some first basic approaches for RS-based impact assessment on biomass increase of selected GGWSSI projects. An upcoming paper will concentrate on a more advanced approach of impact assessment. Time series of satellite-derived precipitation estimates (P, the main driver of vegetation growth in the area) and Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI, indicating vegetation amount and health status) data were utilised to characterize general precipitation and vegetation characteristics in the region and to compute long- (for P) and short-term linear trends (for P and NDVI). This is important to distinguish between general climatic trends in the region and vegetation trends due to project intervention. The results indicate a significant long-term increase in annual precipitation sums over the period 1981 – 2014 in the study area, while there is no significant precipitation trend in the more recent (and shorter) time period (2001 – 2014). The NDVI-based analysis of vegetation revealed some local positive and negative trends. As there is no significant precipitation trend over this time, we assume that other/additional factors than precipitation changes need to be considered as drivers for the vegetation trends. For an in-depth analysis of local vegetation changes (also with respect to land degradation) future studies should also include other sources of information (e. g. field studies, interviews of local people). The basic assessment of possible biophysical impacts of selected restoration projects was done via visual inspection of very high resolution images before and after the intervention and by computing differences of maxNDVI between project sites and reference sites. For some projects, slight positive changes after the intervention could be observed, indicating an increase of biomass. Other projects did not show any visible positive effect of the interventions. Further research is currently in progress to develop a more automatized and statistically sound method for this type of comparison. Should this advanced approach confirm the failure of some projects, further studies should be undertaken to understand the reasons for the failure to guide future interventions and project planning/monitoring.

40|$|Draft version issued {{as working}} paper. Final {{published}} version {{available online at}} [URL] article provides an account of meanings and connotations of ‘African leadership’ emerging from research with a cohort of participants on <b>a</b> <b>Pan-African</b> leadership development <b>programme.</b> We begin by reviewing current approaches to leadership, and how they have been applied {{to the study of}} leadership and management across cultures, before introducing the notion of the ‘African renaissance’, which calls for a re-engagement with indigenous knowledge and practices. The findings from our study indicate a tension between accounts and representations of leadership and the potential for leadership development to act as a forum in which participants can work through these issues. In developing an Afro-centric perspective on leadership, we propose that development activities that promote relational, critical and constructionist perspectives on leadership, with an emphasis on dialogue and sharing experience, could be an important means for surfacing new insights and understandings. In particular, they offer a mechanism by which participants can enhance their sense of ‘self in community’, generate shared understandings, challenge repressive power relations, and develop culturally appropriate forms of leadership behaviour. We conclude by proposing that further research is required on leadership in Africa that steps outside dominant methodological and empirical paradigms, and argue that such work holds great potential for generating insights not just relevant to leadership in Africa but to leadership studies in general...|$|R

Interviews with participants from the financial markets from around Africa enabled 16 critical success factors to be identified. These were then categorised into three sub-categories: catalysts for growth, challenges, and absolute requirements {{for the establishment of}} such an exchange. Catalysts for growth are factors from which the growth of an exchange would benefit if these factors were in place. Challenges are factors that individually represent varying levels of dependence for the successful establishment of such an exchange but collectively form a key requirement for the successful establishment of <b>a</b> <b>pan-African</b> securities exchange. Absolute requirements represent those requirements without which the establishment of <b>a</b> <b>pan-African</b> exchange would not be successful.
