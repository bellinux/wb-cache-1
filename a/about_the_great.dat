5|$|Little {{is known}} <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>great</b> white shark's mating habits. It is {{possible}} that whale carcasses are an important location for sexually mature sharks to meet for mating. Birth has never been observed, but pregnant females have been examined. Great white sharks are ovoviviparous, which means eggs develop and hatch in the uterus and continue to develop until birth. The great white has an 11-month gestation period. The shark pup's powerful jaws begin to develop in the first month. The unborn sharks participate in oophagy, in which they feed on ova produced by the mother. Delivery is in spring and summer. The Northern Pacific population of great whites is suspected to breed off of the Sea of Cortez, as evidenced by local fisherman who have said to have caught them and evidenced by teeth found at dump sites for discarded parts from their catches.|$|E

This book {{contains}} several collected theories and myths about Khufu, especially <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>Great</b> Pyramid.

25|$|Lady Curzon learned <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>great</b> one-horned {{rhinoceroses}} of Kaziranga {{from her}} tea-plantation friends {{and wanted to}} see them. In the winter of 1904 she visited the Kaziranga area, and saw some of their hoof marks, but was disappointed by not having seen a single rhinoceros. It was reported that the noted Assamese animal tracker, Balaram Hazarika, showed Lady Curzon around Kaziranga and impressed upon her {{the urgent need for}} its conservation. Concerned about the dwindling numbers of rhinoceros, she asked her husband to take the necessary action to save the rhinoceros, which he did. The Kaziranga Proposed Reserve Forest thus was created.

25|$|The first {{systematic}} {{study was}} not conducted until the 1920s, when Carl Akeley of the American Museum of Natural History traveled to Africa to hunt for an animal to be shot and stuffed. On his first trip, he was accompanied by his friends Mary Bradley, a mystery writer, her husband, and their young daughter Alice, who would later write science fiction under the pseudonym James Tiptree Jr. After their trip, Mary Bradley wrote On the Gorilla Trail. She later became an advocate {{for the conservation of}} gorillas, and wrote several more books (mainly for children). In the late 1920s and early 1930s, Robert Yerkes and his wife Ava helped further the study of gorillas when they sent Harold Bigham to Africa. Yerkes also wrote a book in 1929 <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>great</b> apes.|$|E

Dick was the hands-down {{favorite}} to win {{rookie of the year}} in 1965, but was ruled ineligible for the award because he was a past champion in IMCA.

25|$|At {{the age of}} fourteen, while {{sick with}} typhoid fever, he raved in his {{delirium}} that he wanted, above all else, to see the paintings in the Palazzo Pitti and the Uffizi in Florence. As Livorno's local museum housed only a sparse few paintings by the Italian Renaissance masters, the tales he had heard <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>great</b> works held in Florence intrigued him, {{and it was a}} source of considerable despair to him, in his sickened state, that he might never get the chance to view them in person. His mother promised that she would take him to Florence herself, the moment he was recovered. Not only did she fulfil this promise, but she also undertook to enroll him with the best painting master in Livorno, Guglielmo Micheli.|$|E
25|$|Adding to his {{reputation}} {{was the fact}} that Liszt gave away much of his proceeds to charity and humanitarian causes. In fact, Liszt had made so much money by his mid-forties that virtually all his performing fees after 1857 went to charity. While his work for the Beethoven monument and the Hungarian National School of Music are well known, he also gave generously to the building fund of Cologne Cathedral, the establishment of a Gymnasium at Dortmund, and the construction of the Leopold Church in Pest. There were also private donations to hospitals, schools and charitable organizations such as the Leipzig Musicians Pension Fund. When he found out <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>Great</b> Fire of Hamburg, which raged for three days during May 1842 and destroyed much of the city, he gave concerts in aid of the thousands of homeless there.|$|E
25|$|Based on a mark in an {{interior}} chamber naming the work gang and {{a reference to}} fourth dynasty Egyptian Pharaoh Khufu, Egyptologists believe that the pyramid was built as a tomb over a 10 to 20-year period concluding around 2560 BC. Initially at , the Great Pyramid was the tallest man-made structure {{in the world for}} more than 3,800 years. Originally, the Great Pyramid was covered by casing stones that formed a smooth outer surface; what is seen today is the underlying core structure. Some of the casing stones that once covered the structure can still be seen around the base. There have been varying scientific and alternative theories <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>Great</b> Pyramid's construction techniques. Most accepted construction hypotheses are {{based on the idea that}} it was built by moving huge stones from a quarry and dragging and lifting them into place.|$|E

25|$|According to his successor, Dr Meek, Mr M’Culloch {{had been}} in the habit of preaching out of doors, in the nearby gorge, because of the poor repair of the church. It was here, after sermon, that he shared the letters and written sermons he {{received}} from New England. Towards the end of January 1742, two men, Ingram More, a shoemaker, and Robert Bowman, a weaver, went through the parish, and got about 90 heads of families to sign a petition to the minister, asking that he give them a weekly lecture. Thursday evening was set for this. The first two lectures passed off as expected, and only a few persons came back to the manse for further prayer and discussion. However, on Monday 15 February, all the Fellowships in the parish turned up at the manse and spent several days praying and discussing and wondering <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>great</b> events that were being reported from England and America.|$|E

In 1675, Marquette returned to found a Jesuit mission at the Grand Village of the Illinois. Over the next decades missions, trade posts, and forts were established in the region. By 1714, the principal European, non-native inhabitants were Canadien fur traders, missionaries and soldiers, dealing with Native Americans, particularly the group known as the Kaskaskia. The main French settlements were established at Kaskaskia, Cahokia, and Sainte Genevieve. By 1752, the population had risen to 2,573.|$|E
25|$|Garrison {{was born}} on November 19, 1897, in New York City to Lloyd McKim and Alice (Kirkham) Garrison. His {{great-grandfather}} was William Lloyd Garrison, the famous American abolitionist, and his grandfather was Wendell Phillips Garrison, who once was literary editor of The Nation (a left-wing magazine of politics and opinion). His father died of typhoid when Garrison was a child, and he was largely raised by his grandfather, Wendell. His grandfather, who knew many Civil War-era abolitionists (Frederick Douglass was a frequent guest in the Garrison home in Roxbury, Massachusetts, and Wendell Garrison knew him personally), regaled young Lloyd with many stories <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>great</b> struggles for civil rights and liberties of the 19th century. He graduated from St. Paul's School, a college-preparatory boarding school in New Hampshire.
