25|$|It {{is often}} {{necessary}} to align an optical fiber with another optical fiber, or with an optoelectronic device {{such as a}} light-emitting diode, <b>a</b> <b>laser</b> <b>diode,</b> or a modulator. This can involve either carefully aligning the fiber and placing it {{in contact with the}} device, or can use a lens to allow coupling over an air gap. Typically the size of the fiber mode is much larger than the size of the mode in <b>a</b> <b>laser</b> <b>diode</b> or a silicon optical chip. In this case a tapered or lensed fiber is used to match the fiber mode field distribution to that of the other element.

25|$|Many of the {{advances}} in reliability of diode lasers {{in the last}} 20 years remain proprietary to their developers. The reliability of <b>a</b> <b>laser</b> <b>diode</b> {{can make or break}} a product line. Moreover, reverse engineering is not always able to reveal the differences between more-reliable and less-reliable diode laser products.|$|E
25|$|<b>A</b> <b>laser</b> <b>diode</b> is {{electrically}} a PIN diode. The {{active region}} of the laser diode is in the intrinsic (I) region, and the carriers (electrons and holes) are pumped into that region from the N and P regions respectively. While initial diode laser research was conducted on simple P-N diodes, all modern lasers use the double-hetero-structure implementation, where the carriers and the photons are confined {{in order to maximize}} their chances for recombination and light generation. Unlike a regular diode, the goal for <b>a</b> <b>laser</b> <b>diode</b> is to recombine all carriers in the I region, and produce light. Thus, laser diodes are fabricated using direct band-gap semiconductors. The laser diode epitaxial structure is grown using one of the crystal growth techniques, usually starting from an N doped substrate, and growing the I doped active layer, followed by the P doped cladding, and a contact layer. The active layer most often consists of quantum wells, which provide lower threshold current and higher efficiency.|$|E
25|$|<b>A</b> <b>laser</b> <b>diode</b> is a laser {{where the}} active medium is a {{semiconductor}} {{similar to that}} found in a light-emitting diode. The most common and practical type of laser diode is formed from a p-n junction and powered by injected electric current. These devices are {{sometimes referred to as}} injection laser diodes to distinguish them from optically pumped laser diodes, which are more easily manufactured in the laboratory. The laser diode was invented in 1962 by Robert N. Hall.|$|E

Today, they are much smaller and generally cost very little. In the 21st century, diode-pumped solid-state (DPSS) red laser pointers emitting at 671 nm became available. Although this wavelength can be obtained directly with <b>an</b> inexpensive <b>laser</b> <b>diode,</b> higher beam quality and narrower spectral bandwidth are achieved through DPSS versions.|$|R

We show that white light generation is possible using blue or near-UV <b>laser</b> <b>diodes</b> in combination with yellow-emitting cerium-substituted yttrium aluminum garnet (YAG:Ce) or a mixture of red-, green-, and blue-emitting phosphors.
