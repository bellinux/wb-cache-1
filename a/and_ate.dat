5|$|Gaylussacia brachycera {{is easily}} {{distinguished}} from {{other members of}} its genus by its leaves: they resemble those of boxwood (hence its name) and lack the resin glands typical of huckleberries.

40|$|Sex <b>and</b> <b>eating</b> {{may have}} {{behavioral}} and psychological relationships and have cortical regions in common. This research investigated the general relationship between sex <b>and</b> <b>eating</b> from a reward perspective {{among the general}} population. Two-hundred and sixty-one Chinese participants were recruited via the internet (136 males, 125 females, mean age 30. 46 years) to fill in questionnaires about wanting and liking for sex <b>and</b> <b>eating.</b> The results revealed that first, there was {{a positive correlation between}} wanting for sex <b>and</b> wanting to <b>eat</b> only for males. Second, the relationship between liking for sex <b>and</b> <b>eating</b> was also positive for males and not significant in females. Third, the correlation between sociosexual orientation <b>and</b> wanting to <b>eat</b> was significant only in females, and there was no significant correlation between sociosexual orientation <b>and</b> liking for <b>eating.</b> Fourth, emotional sex cravings (or emotional sexual activity) was positively correlated with emotional food cravings (or emotional eating behavior), with a higher magnitude correlation in males than females. Finally, analysis of wanting (liking) models of sex <b>and</b> <b>eating</b> for males <b>and</b> females revealed three models for wanting among females: high wanting, low wanting for <b>eating,</b> <b>and</b> low wanting for sex; and two models for wanting among males: high wanting and low wanting. Liking for sex <b>and</b> <b>eating</b> among females consisted of two types of model: high liking and low liking; whereas three type models existed for males: high liking for sex, high liking for <b>eating,</b> <b>and</b> low liking. In general, our research revealed that, as with other natural rewards, sex <b>and</b> <b>eating</b> have considerable commonality and are related in numerous ways...|$|R

5|$|A {{motif of}} father-against-son {{conflict}} was repeated when Cronus {{was confronted by}} his son, Zeus. Because Cronus had betrayed his father, he feared that his offspring would do the same, and so each time Rhea gave birth, he snatched up the child <b>and</b> <b>ate</b> it. Rhea hated this and tricked him by hiding Zeus and wrapping a stone in a baby's blanket, which Cronus ate. When Zeus was full grown, he fed Cronus a drugged drink which caused him to vomit, throwing up Rhea's other children and the stone, which {{had been sitting in}} Cronus's stomach all along. Zeus then challenged Cronus to war for the kingship of the gods. At last, {{with the help of the}} Cyclopes (whom Zeus freed from Tartarus), Zeus and his siblings were victorious, while Cronus and the Titans were hurled down to imprisonment in Tartarus.|$|E

They began to take apart their snowshoes to eat the oxhide webbing and discussed killing Luis and Salvador for food, before Eddy warned the two men and they quietly left. Jay Fosdick died during the night, leaving only seven members of the party. Eddy and Mary Graves left to hunt, but when they returned with deer meat, Fosdick's body had already been cut apart for food. After several more days—25 since they had left Truckee Lake—they came across Salvador and Luis, who had not eaten for about nine days and were close to death. William Foster shot the pair, believing that their flesh was the group's last hope of avoiding imminent death from starvation.|$|E

5|$|As {{the team}} {{prepared}} {{for its first}} season in 1946, McBride stepped aside and let Brown run it. The Browns were an immediate success, both financially and on the field. A capacity crowd of 35,964 saw the Browns play their first preseason game at the Akron Rubber Bowl, and the team led all of football in attendance in 1946 and 1947. The Browns, meanwhile, won every AAFC championship between 1946 and 1949. McBride proposed for the Browns to play an inter-league championship game with the National Football League champion Philadelphia Eagles in 1948 and 1949, but the NFL shot down the idea. He {{also played a role}} in negotiating peace between the AAFC and NFL after competition for talent drove up player salaries <b>and</b> <b>ate</b> into owners' profits. After the 1949 season, the AAFC dissolved and three of its teams, including the Browns, merged into the more established NFL.|$|E
5|$|Early {{people began}} {{altering}} communities of {{flora and fauna}} for their own benefit through means such as fire-stick farming and forest gardening very early. Exact dates are hard to determine, as people collected <b>and</b> <b>ate</b> seeds before domesticating them, and plant characteristics may have changed during this period without human selection. An example is the semi-tough rachis and larger seeds of cereals from just after the Younger Dryas (about 9,500 BC) in the early Holocene in the Levant region of the Fertile Crescent. Monophyletic characteristics were attained without any human intervention, implying that apparent domestication of the cereal rachis could have occurred quite naturally.|$|E
5|$|The {{majority}} of middle-class and educated Khmers had grown {{weary of the}} prince and welcomed the change of government. They were joined by the military, for whom {{the prospect of the}} return of American military and financial aid was a cause for celebration. Within days of his deposition, Sihanouk, now in Beijing, broadcast an appeal to the people to resist the usurpers. Demonstrations and riots occurred (mainly in areas contiguous to PAVN/Viet Cong controlled areas), but no nationwide groundswell threatened the government. In one incident at Kampong Cham on 29 March, however, an enraged crowd killed Lon Nol's brother, Lon Nil, tore out his liver, and cooked <b>and</b> <b>ate</b> it. An estimated 40,000 peasants then began to march on the capital to demand Sihanouk's reinstatement. They were dispersed, with many casualties, by contingents of the armed forces.|$|E

40|$|Symptoms {{of muscle}} dysmorphia, body dysmorphic disorder, <b>and</b> <b>eating</b> {{disorders}} in a nonclinical population of adult male weightlifters in Australia. J Strength Cond Res 29 (5) : 1406 – 1414, 2015 —The current study aimed to (a) determine {{the rates of}} symptoms of muscle dysmorphia (MD), body dysmorphic disorder (BDD), <b>and</b> <b>eating</b> disorder; (b) determine the relationships among symptoms of MD, BDD, <b>and</b> <b>eating</b> disorders; <b>and</b> (c) provide a comprehensive comparison of symptoms of MD, BDD, <b>and</b> <b>eating</b> disorders in a nonclinical population of adult male weightlifters in Australia. The participants (N = 648, mean age = 29. 5 years, SD = 10. 1) participated in an online survey, consisting of Muscle Appearance Satisfaction Scale, the Body Dysmorphic Disorder Questionnaire, and the Eating Attitude Test- 26. Results indicated that 110 participants (17 %) were {{at risk of having}} MD, 69 participants (10. 6 %) were at risk of having BDD, and 219 participants (33. 8 %) were at risk of having an eating disorder. Furthermore, 36 participants (5. 6 %) were found at risk of having both MD and BDD, and 60 participants (9. 3 %) were at risk of having both MD <b>and</b> an <b>eating</b> disorder. Significant correlations and associations were found between symptoms of MD and BDD, and symptoms of MD <b>and</b> <b>eating</b> disorders. Support was provided for the comorbidity of, and symptomatic similarities between, symptoms of MD and BDD, and symptoms of MD <b>and</b> <b>eating</b> disorders. This may reflect a shared pathogenesis between symptoms of MD, BDD, <b>and</b> <b>eating</b> disorders. Strength <b>and</b> conditioning professionals, exercise scientists, athletic trainers, and personal trainers should be aware that adult males who are working out with weights (i. e., free weights or machines) may be at increased risk of having MD, BDD, <b>and</b> <b>eating</b> disorders...|$|R

5|$|The {{most common}} {{agricultural}} food staples during Han were wheat, barley, rice, foxtail millet, proso millet, and beans. People of the Han also consumed sorghum, Job's tears, taro, mallow, mustard green, melon, bottle gourd, bamboo shoot, {{the roots of}} lotus plants, and ginger. Some of the fruits the Han ate included the chestnut, jujube, pear, peach, plum (including the plum of Prunus salicina and Prunus mume), melon, apricot, red bayberry, and strawberry. The Han Chinese domesticated <b>and</b> <b>ate</b> chickens, Mandarin ducks, geese, camels, cows, sheep, pigs, and dogs. The type of game animals hunted during the Han included rabbit, sika deer, turtle dove, goose, owl, Chinese bamboo partridge, magpie, common pheasant, and cranes, while fish and turtles were taken from streams and lakes. Beer—which could be an unfermented malt drink with low alcohol content or a stronger brew fermented with yeast—was commonly consumed alongside meat, but virtually never consumed alongside grains such as rice. Wine was also regularly consumed.|$|E
5|$|Upon Sophia's birth, King George ensured {{his daughters}} and younger sons would have allowances; through a {{provision}} of Parliament, Sophia and her elder sisters were each {{to receive an}} annual income of £6,000 either upon their marriages or the king's death. The royal household was very rigid and formal, even when only the royal family were together in private. For instance, when the King entered a room, his daughters were expected to stand up, remain silent until addressed, and not leave until given permission. Queen Charlotte made attempts to be economical where possible; the younger princesses wore country-made dresses, which were less expensive, <b>and</b> <b>ate</b> plain food.|$|E
5|$|The Cleveland area showered {{support on}} the Browns from the outset. Meanwhile, the Browns {{unexpectedly}} had Cleveland to themselves; the NFL's Cleveland Rams, who had continually lost money despite winning the 1945 NFL championship, moved to Los Angeles after that season. The Browns' on-field feats only amplified their popularity, and the team saw average attendance of 57,000 per game in its first season. The Browns, however, became victims of their own success. Cleveland's dominance exposed a lack of balance among AAFC teams, which the league tried to correct by sending Browns players including quarterback Y. A. Tittle to the Baltimore Colts in 1948. Attendance at Browns games fell in later years as fans lost interest in lopsided victories, while attendance for less successful teams fell even more precipitously. The Browns led all of football during the undefeated season in 1948 with an average crowd of 45,517, but {{that was more than}} 10,000 less than the average per game the previous year. These factors – combined with a war for players between the two leagues that raised salaries <b>and</b> <b>ate</b> into owners' profits – ultimately led to the dissolution of the AAFC and the merger of three of its teams, including the Browns, into the NFL in 1949. The NFL does not acknowledge AAFC statistics and records because these achievements – including the Browns' perfect season – did not take place in the NFL or against NFL teams, and not in a league fully absorbed by the NFL.|$|E
