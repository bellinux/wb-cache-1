5|$|After Kilinochchi was captured, several {{foreign governments}} urged {{both parties to}} seek a {{political}} solution. The Colombo Stock Exchange recorded a rise and the rupee stabilized, while celebrators lit firecrackers on the streets soon after the capture was declared. Amidst the celebrations, a suicide bomb attack occurred in the evening {{in front of the}} air force headquarters in Colombo, killing 3 and wounding about 30 people. The SLA continued to advance into LTTE held territory, capturing some more strategically important locations, including Elephant Pass <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>entire</b> A9 Highway soon after the fall of Kilinochchi.|$|E
5|$|Amon's reign was in {{the midst}} of a {{transitional}} time for the Levant <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>entire</b> Mesopotamian region. To the east of Judah, the Assyrian Empire was beginning to disintegrate while the Babylonian Empire had not yet risen to replace it. To the west, Egypt was still recovering under Psamtik I from its Assyrian occupation, transforming from a vassal state to an autonomous ally. In this power vacuum, many smaller states such as Judah were able to govern themselves without foreign intervention from larger empires.|$|E
5|$|Beginning in 1958, I-75 in Michigan was {{constructed}} in several discontinuous segments. M-76 was {{to become one of}} the portions incorporated into the route of I-75. Although other portions of I-75 were completed and designated in noncontiguous segments, the portion from Standish to Roscommon was first signed as M-76 <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>entire</b> stretch rebuilt as freeway before it was redesignated as I-75. This was done while a temporary connecting ToI-75 designation between Bay City and Grayling followed a different path along US10 and US127.|$|E

5|$|Both Britain and France claimed {{victory in}} the battle: Britain by virtue of {{capturing}} or sinking seven French ships without losing any of her own and remaining {{in control of the}} battle site; France because the vital convoy had passed through the Atlantic unharmed and arrived in France without significant loss. The two fleets were showered by their respective nations with both praise and criticism – the latter particularly directed at those captains not felt to have contributed significantly to the fighting. The British fleet in Spithead was treated with a Royal visit by King George III <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>entire</b> royal household.|$|E
5|$|Built by the California Department of Water Resources (DWR), Oroville Dam {{is one of}} the key {{features}} of the California State Water Project (SWP), one of two major projects passed that set up California's statewide water system. Construction was initiated in 1961, and despite numerous difficulties encountered during its construction, including multiple floods and a major train wreck on the rail line used to transport materials to the dam site, the embankment was topped out in 1967 <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>entire</b> project was ready for use in 1968. The dam began to generate electricity shortly afterwards with completion of the Edward Hyatt Pump-Generating Plant, then the country's largest underground power station.|$|E

5|$|By the 4th century BC, the {{military}} formations the Romans had {{inherited from the}} Etruscans were still in use. Though their efficiency was doubtful, they proved effective against Rome's largely local adversaries. When Gauls invaded Etruria in 390 BC, the inhabitants requested help from Rome. The small contingent Rome sent to repel the Gallic invaders provoked a full-scale attack on Rome <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>entire</b> Roman army was destroyed at the Battle of the Allia.|$|E
5|$|By {{the end of}} the {{conflict}} both sides had exhausted their human and material resources. Consequently, they were vulnerable to the sudden emergence of the Islamic Rashidun Caliphate, whose forces invaded both empires only a few years after the war. The Muslim forces swiftly conquered the entire Sasanian Empire and deprived the Byzantine Empire of its territories in the Levant, the Caucasus, Egypt, and North Africa. Over the following centuries, half the Byzantine Empire <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>entire</b> Sasanian Empire came under Muslim rule.|$|E
5|$|Chamberlain <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>entire</b> {{subsequent}} government {{carries the}} blame {{not to have}} taken equivalent steps when they discovered Germany's preparations for war. A world power must always be prepared to successfully and energetically repulse any attack. Everyone is certain that England was not sufficiently prepared. Also the fleet did not appear capable of taking decisive action. It's possible that it was merely constraining itself, but that strategy is a mistake. It should have been put into action immediately. Neither in Africa nor in the Mediterranean has the English fleet rigorously counter-attacked.|$|E

5|$|Chiprovtsi {{is thought}} to have been founded in the Late Middle Ages as a mining and metalsmithing centre. Attracting German ore miners who {{introduced}} Roman Catholicism to the area, the town grew in importance as a cultural, economic and religious centre of the Bulgarian Catholics <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>entire</b> Bulgarian northwest during the first few centuries of Ottoman rule. The apogee of this upsurge was the anti-Ottoman Chiprovtsi Uprising of 1688. After the suppression of the uprising, some of the town's population fled to Habsburg-ruled lands; those unable to flee were killed or enslaved by the Ottomans.|$|E
5|$|Cyclone Kalunde brought US$3.15million {{in damage}} to Rodrigues Island. A total of 1,600homes and 40boats were damaged.

About 80percent of the drinking water was contaminated <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>entire</b> food crop was destroyed. However, no deaths were reported.|$|E

Lawyers appointed by the Company launched a formal investigation early in 1894.|$|E
