5|$|In 1920, Rabearivelo {{was hired}} as an <b>assistant</b> <b>librarian</b> at the Cercle de l'Union social club. That same year he drafted his first book, a short novel written in the Malagasy language. He began to {{correspond}} {{with a wide range}} of writers around the world, including André Gide, Paul Valéry, Jean Amrouche, Paul Claudel, and Valery Larbaud, and spent large sums to buy books and ship them to Madagascar. By these means he amassed a diverse collection that constituted the richest library on the island. In 1924 he took a job as a proofreader at the publishing house Imprimerie de l'Imerina, a position he would continue to occupy for the rest of his life. In 1921 he befriended high-level French colonial bureaucrats who shared his passion for French literature, including Robert Boudry, the colony's financial manager, and Pierre Camo, Madagascar's postal magistrate and founder of the literary magazine 18° Latitude Sud.|$|E
5|$|In 1943 Larkin was {{appointed}} librarian {{of the public}} library in Wellington, Shropshire.

In 1945, Ruth went to continue her studies at King's College London; {{during one of his}} visits their friendship developed into a sexual relationship. By June 1946, Larkin was halfway through qualifying for membership of the Library Association and {{was appointed}} <b>assistant</b> <b>librarian</b> at University College, Leicester. It was visiting Larkin in Leicester and witnessing the university's Senior Common Room that gave Kingsley Amis the inspiration to write Lucky Jim (1954), the novel that made Amis famous and to whose long gestation Larkin contributed considerably. Six weeks after his father's death from cancer in March 1948, Larkin proposed to Ruth, and that summer the couple spent their annual holiday touring Hardy country.|$|E

500|$|In 1933, H. R. Hutchinson, {{who was the}} Librarian at the Lindley Library, Royal Horticultural Society's (RHS) in London, was due to retire. John Gilmour, now {{assistant}} director at the Kew Gardens, put forward his name, together with Bowles, a Vice-president of the Society, who had discovered Stearn at the bookshop. Stearn was 22 when he began work at the library, initially as <b>Assistant</b> <b>Librarian,</b> before taking over Hutchinson's position after six months. He later explained the appointment {{at such a young}} age on World War I – [...] "All the people who should have had those jobs were dead." [...] There he collaborated with Bowles on a number of plant monographs, such as Bowles' Handbook of Crocus and their work on Anemone japonica (Anemone hupehensis var. japonica). Written in 1947, it is still considered one of the most comprehensive accounts of the origins and nomenclature of fall-blooming anemones. Stearn was one of the last people to see Bowles alive, and when Bowles died, Stearn wrote an appreciation of him, and later contributed the entry on Bowles to the Oxford Dictionary of National Biography. Much of his spare time was spent studying at the Kew Gardens.|$|E

[...] Evans did not have formal training of the scholars, bibliographers, and librarians who surrounded him. Because of this, library scholars were reluctant to aid him in his bibliography project. [...] It was here that Evans met William Frederick Poole, the librarian who would make the biggest impact on Evans’ life when it came to his knowledge and appreciation for the organization and classification in libraries. [...] Years later into his career, Evans would recommend Poole join the American Library Association.|$|E

2500|$|Beloved {{received}} the , which {{is named for}} an editor of Publishers Weekly. In accepting the award on October 12, 1988, Morrison said,"that 'there is no suitable memorial or plaque or wreath or wall or park or skyscraper lobby'" [...] honoring {{the memory of the}} human beings forced into slavery and brought to the United States. 'There’s no small bench by the road,' she continued. 'And because such a place doesn’t exist (that I know of), the book had to.' Inspired by her remarks, the Toni Morrison Society began to install benches at significant sites in the history of slavery in America. The New York Times reported that the first 'bench by the road' was dedicated on July 26, 2008, on Sullivan's Island, South Carolina, the place of entry for some 40 percent of the enslaved Africans brought to the United States. Morrison said she was extremely moved by the memorial. In 2017 the 21st bench was placed at the Library of Congress.

50|$|Many {{ensemble}} librarians work in {{the field}} of symphony and chamber orchestras, forming the most typical professional profile of a performance librarian. Performance librarianship in professional symphony and chamber orchestras is characterized by frequently changing programs and a large total number of works performed, reflecting in the large number of performance materials and sets of parts to be prepared. Many full-time, professional, North American symphony orchestras employ two or even three music librarians (typically, a principal librarian and one or more <b>assistant</b> <b>librarians).</b> In Europe, full-sized symphony orchestras operate with fewer resources. For example, The Helsinki Philharmonic Orchestra, Finnish Radio Symphony Orchestra, and the Tampere Philharmonic Orchestra all are single-librarian orchestras.|$|R
