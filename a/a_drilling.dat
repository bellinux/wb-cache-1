5|$|In 1859, Edwin Drake of Pennsylvania invented <b>a</b> <b>drilling</b> {{process to}} extract oil {{from deep within}} the earth. Drake's {{invention}} is credited with giving birth to the oil industry in the U.S. The first oil refiner in the United States opened in 1861 in Western Pennsylvania, during the Pennsylvanian oil rush. Standard Oil, which had been founded by John D. Rockefeller in Ohio, became a multi-state trust and came to dominate the young petroleum industry in the U.S.|$|E
5|$|In the episode, the Doctor—a time {{travelling}} alien {{played by}} Matt Smith—and his companions Amy Pond (Karen Gillan) and Rory Williams (Arthur Darvill) land in Wales in 2020, where <b>a</b> <b>drilling</b> operation headed by Nasreen Chaudhry (Meera Syal) is drilling {{deep into the}} earth and disrupting a civilisation of Silurians who dwell beneath the earth. The Silurians cause holes {{to open in the}} earth, one of which consumes Amy. The Doctor and Rory capture one Silurian, Alaya (Neve McIntosh), and the Doctor instructs Rory and a local family to not harm Alaya, as it could spark a war. He then takes Nasreen in the TARDIS to the Silurian civilisation to rescue Amy and a local boy.|$|E
25|$|While {{the term}} drill may refer to either <b>a</b> <b>drilling</b> machine or a drill bit {{for use in}} <b>a</b> <b>drilling</b> machine, in this article, for clarity, drill bit or bit is used {{throughout}} {{to refer to a}} bit for use in <b>a</b> <b>drilling</b> machine, and drill refers always to <b>a</b> <b>drilling</b> machine.|$|E

25|$|Drilling, {{longwall}} and rockbreaking {{machines are}} now also available as autonomous robots. The Atlas Copco Rig Control System can autonomously execute <b>a</b> <b>drilling</b> plan on <b>a</b> <b>drilling</b> rig, moving the rig into position using GPS, {{set up the}} drill rig and drill down to specified depths. Similarly, the Transmin Rocklogic system can automatically plan a path to position a rockbreaker at a selected destination. These systems greatly enhance the safety and efficiency of mining operations.|$|E
25|$|Drilling harms {{ecosystems}} because <b>a</b> <b>drilling</b> site {{is accompanied}} by construction, land disturbance, and land clearing. This causes erosion of not only dirt but also of other harmful pollutants. And drilling also fragments the wildlife’s habitat and migration needs.|$|E
25|$|In 1998 the {{consortium}} established <b>a</b> <b>drilling</b> site at Ryer, in Jagei Nuer territory, near {{the port of}} Thar Jath on the Nile. In 1998 they built an unpaved road from Bentiu to the north via Duar and Guk to Ryer and Thar Jath.|$|E

40|$|During the {{research}} <b>a</b> <b>drill</b> string was simulated by a flexible beam. The flexible beam has a 3 D deformation under external loadings. The system of vector differential equations of equilibrium {{is used for}} analysis of the stress-strain state. The mathematical model takes into consideration a body weight and stiffness of <b>a</b> <b>drill</b> string, axial force, torsional moment and reactions of a hole wall. The deformation of <b>a</b> <b>drill</b> string elastic line with external diameter of 127 mm in a well "dog-leg" was analyzed in real operational conditions using the developed method. The author obtained the function of <b>a</b> <b>drill</b> string elastic line in 3 D coordinate system. There were drawn the diagrams of normal stresses of bending around basic axes of inertia of <b>a</b> <b>drill</b> string cross-section. It is also noticed that the "dog-leg" increases these stresses twice...|$|R
25|$|<b>A</b> <b>drilling</b> team under George B. Reynolds {{was sent}} to Persia and began to search. In 1903 a company was formed and D'Arcy had to spend over £500,000 to cover the costs.

25|$|The Standby Reserve {{consists}} of personnel who maintain their affiliation without {{being in the}} Ready Reserve, who have been designated key civilian employees, or who have a temporary hardship or disability. They {{are not required to}} perform training and are not part of units but create a pool of trained individuals who could be mobilized if necessary as a last resort to fill manpower needs in specific skills. Membership in the Standby Reserve is limited to one year, afterwards the Soldier must determine if they are transferring to the IRR or <b>a</b> <b>drilling</b> unit.|$|E
25|$|A {{countersink}} is a conical hole {{cut into}} a manufactured object; a countersink bit (sometimes called simply countersink) is the cutter used to cut such a hole. A common use {{is to allow}} {{the head of a}} bolt or screw, with a shape exactly matching the countersunk hole, to sit flush with or {{below the surface of the}} surrounding material. (By comparison, a counterbore makes a flat-bottomed hole that might be used with a hex-headed capscrew.) A countersink may also be used to remove the burr left from <b>a</b> <b>drilling</b> or tapping operation.|$|E
50|$|<b>A</b> Persian <b>drill</b> is <b>a</b> <b>drill</b> {{which is}} turned by pushing a nut {{back and forth}} along <b>a</b> spirally grooved <b>drill</b> holder.

So Eddie painted <b>a</b> <b>drill</b> with the Frankenstrat stripes to use during concerts.|$|R
25|$|GEC {{was working}} on {{producing}} a fully sealed version of the magnetron, as opposed to one that used an external vacuum pump. After inventing a new sealing method using gold wire and adapting the chamber of a Colt revolver as <b>a</b> <b>drilling</b> template, they produced the E1188 in early July 1940. This produced {{the same amount of}} power as the original Randall-Boot model, about 1kW at around 10cm. Within a few weeks they had made two improvements, moving from six to eight resonators, and replacing the cathode with an oxide-coated version. The resulting E1189 was capable of generating 10kW of power at 9.1cm, an order of magnitude better than any existing microwave device. The second E1189 was sent to the AMRE lab, which received it on 19 July.|$|E
25|$|Rumsfeld {{served in}} the United States Navy from 1954 to 1957, as a naval aviator and flight instructor. His initial {{training}} was in the North American SNJ Texan basic trainer after which he transitioned to the T-28 advanced trainer. In 1957, he transferred to the Naval Reserve and continued his naval service in flying and administrative assignments as <b>a</b> <b>drilling</b> reservist. On July 1, 1958, {{he was assigned to}} Anti-submarine Squadron 662 at Naval Air Station Anacostia, District of Columbia, as a selective reservist. Rumsfeld was designated aircraft commander of Anti-submarine Squadron 731 on October 1, 1960, at Naval Air Station Grosse Ile, Michigan, where he flew the S2F Tracker. He transferred to the Individual Ready Reserve when he became Secretary of Defense in 1975 and retired with the rank of captain in 1989.|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} 1990s, the Israel National Oil Company (INOC) was granted shaft-sinking permits in the Golan Heights. It {{estimated}} a recovery potential of two {{million barrels of}} oil, equivalent {{at the time to}} $24 million. During the Yitzhak Rabin administration (1992–1995), the permits were suspended as efforts were undertaken to restart peace negotiations between Israel and Syria. In 1996, Benjamin Netanyahu granted preliminary approval to INOC to proceed with oil exploration drilling in the Golan. INOC began undergoing a process of privatization in 1997, overseen by then-Director of the Government Companies Authority (GCA), Tzipi Livni. During that time, it was decided that INOC's drilling permits would be returned to the state. In 2012, National Infrastructure Minister Uzi Landau approved exploratory drilling for oil and natural gas in the Golan. The following year, the Petroleum Council of Israel's Ministry of Energy and Water Resources secretly awarded <b>a</b> <b>drilling</b> license covering half the area of the Golan Heights to a local subsidiary of New Jersey-based Genie Energy Ltd. headed by Effi Eitam.|$|E

500|$|Barium sulfate (the mineral barite, BaSO4) is {{important}} to the petroleum industry as <b>a</b> <b>drilling</b> fluid in oil and gas wells. The precipitate of the compound (called [...] "blanc fixe", from the French for [...] "permanent white") is used in paints and varnishes; as a filler in ringing ink, plastics, and rubbers; as a paper coating pigment; and in nanoparticles, to improve physical properties of some polymers, such as epoxies.|$|E
500|$|During its {{lifetime}} the rig received 5 citations for non-compliance, 4 {{of which}} were in 2002 (safety, including the blowout preventer) {{and the other in}} 2003 (pollution). A sixth citation in 2007 related to non-grounded electrical equipment was later withdrawn when the equipment was determined to be compliant with regulations. Overall the Deepwater Horizon safety record was [...] "strong" [...] according to <b>a</b> <b>drilling</b> consultant reviewing the information. In 2009 the Minerals Management Service [...] "herald the Deepwater Horizon as an industry model for safety". According to AP's investigation [...] "its record was so exemplary, according to MMS officials, that the rig was never on inspectors' informal 'watch list' for problem rigs".|$|E
500|$|The cutting {{apparatus}} of a drill {{is on the}} bottom end of a drill barrel, the tube that surrounds the core as the drill cuts downward. [...] The cuttings (chips of ice cut away by the drill) must be drawn up the hole and disposed of or they will reduce the cutting efficiency of the drill. [...] They can be removed by compacting them into {{the walls of the}} hole or into the core, by air circulation (dry drilling), or by the use of <b>a</b> <b>drilling</b> fluid (wet drilling). [...] Dry drilling is limited to about 400m depth, since below that point a hole would close up as the ice deforms from the weight of the ice above.|$|E

[...] Over the course of <b>a</b> <b>drilling</b> season, scores of people work at the camp, and logistics support includes airlift capabilities provided by the US Air National Guard, using Hercules transport planes owned by the National Science Foundation. [...] In 2015 the EastGRIP team moved the camp facilities from NEEM, a previous Greenland ice core drilling site, to the EastGRIP site. [...] Drilling is expected to continue until at least 2020.|$|E
500|$|Dr. Beverly Crusher (Gates McFadden) and Data {{discover}} the crystal may be alive. When the crystal attempts {{to interact with}} the Enterprise's computers, it is placed into a containment force field. The crystal begins to grow and gains access to the computer's translation program and attempts to communicate with the crew, treating the humans as an enemy, derisively calling them [...] "ugly bags of mostly water". [...] Picard discovers that Mandl and his team previously encountered the crystals; at the time, they had considered the possibility that the crystals were alive, but Mandl insisted on continuing to terraform. [...] The terraformers used <b>a</b> <b>drilling</b> process responsible for removing the saline water layer from the water table of Velara III. This saline layer acted as a conductor, allowing many separate crystals to function as one life form. In a defensive response to the drilling, the crystal life form rewrote the laser's software and attacked the terraformers.|$|E
500|$|In February 2008, {{a team of}} {{researchers}} led by Sean Gulick at the University of Texas at Austin's Jackson School of Geosciences used seismic images of the crater to determine that the impactor landed in deeper water than was previously assumed. They argued that this would have resulted in increased sulfate aerosols in the atmosphere. According to the press release, that [...] "could have made the impact deadlier in two ways: by altering climate (sulfate aerosols in the upper atmosphere can have a cooling effect) and by generating acid rain (water vapor can help to flush the lower atmosphere of sulfate aerosols, causing acid rain)." [...] This was borne out by the results of <b>a</b> <b>drilling</b> project in 2016 which found that sulfate containing rocks found in the area were not found in the peak ring (the rocks found were from deep within the earths crust instead), the interpretation being that they had been vaporized by the impact and dispersed into the atmosphere.|$|E
