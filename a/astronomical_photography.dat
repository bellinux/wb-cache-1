2500|$|Annie Scott Dill Maunder was {{a pioneer}} in <b>astronomical</b> <b>photography,</b> {{especially}} of sunspots. A mathematics graduate of Girton College, Cambridge, she was first hired (in 1890) to be an assistant to Edward Walter Maunder, discoverer of the Maunder Minimum, {{the head of the}} solar department at Greenwich Observatory. They worked together to observe sunspots and to refine the techniques of solar photography. They married in 1895. Annie's mathematical skills made it possible to analyse the years of sunspot data that Maunder had been collecting at Greenwich. She also designed a small, portable wide-angle camera with a [...] lens. In 1898, the Maunders traveled to India, where Annie took the first photographs of the sun's corona during a solar eclipse. By analysing the Cambridge records for both sunspots and geomagnetic storm, they were able to show that specific regions of the sun's surface were the source of geomagnetic storms and that the sun did not radiate its energy uniformly into space, as William Thomson, 1st Baron Kelvin had declared.|$|E
40|$|Abstract — While {{digital imaging}} {{systems have been}} widely used for many {{applications}} including consumer photography, microscopy, aerial <b>photography,</b> <b>astronomical</b> imaging, etc., their output images/videos often suffer from spatially varying blur caused by lens, transmission medium, post processing algorithms, and camera/object motion. Measuring the amount of blur globally and locally is an important issue. It can help us in removing the spatially varying blur, and enhancing the visual quality of the imaging system outputs. In this paper, we study the blur measurement problem for different scenarios. We have applied the Geometric Transformation algorithm for restoration of the blurred image. First we apply it for that image where there is only spatial variation in terms of coordinate geometry by keeping the neighborhood pixels orientation constant. Then we apply the algorithm for the case where there is geometric variation spatial as well as local. In both cases we estimated the PSNR & MSE value. Geometric Transformation methods provide us an easiest way to restore the match because here only matched features points are involved in the process, Whereas in local probability estimation we have to concentrate over all pixels and then cause so the computation become complex and hence it enhances the cost of the system...|$|R
40|$|While {{digital imaging}} {{systems have been}} widely used for many {{applications}} including consumer photography, microscopy, aerial <b>photography,</b> <b>astronomical</b> imaging, etc., their output images/videos often suffer from spatially varying blur caused by lens, transmission medium, post processing algorithms, and camera/object motion. Measuring the amount of blur globally and locally is an important issue. It can help us in removing the spatially varying blur, and enhancing the visual quality of the imaging system outputs. It can also provide useful information about the scene, such as saliency and depth map. In this work, we study the blur measurement problem for different scenarios. We first analyze the behavior of a local gradient-based sharpness metric in the presence of spatially varying blur and spatially constant noise, and develop two multiframe restoration systems based on this metric. The first one is a focus-stacking method developed for multifocus image sequences. It selects sharp local patches from the input sequence through the metric, and fuses them together to generate a high quality image. Different from existing stacking methods, this one utilizes image color information to correct fusion errors caused by inaccurate sharpness measurement. The second system aims to restore videos distorted by air turbulence. Air turbulence produces random blur and geometric deformation. Our system first reduces the space and time varying deblurring problem to a shift invariant one through a registration and fusion procedure, and then removes the blur using a blind deconvolution step. Experiments illustrate that this approach can effectively alleviate turbulence distortions, and recover details of the scene. We then consider the situation where both blur and noise are spatially changing. A quality metric based on singular value decomposition of local image gradient matrix is proposed. Compared with existing sharpness metrics that cannot distinguish quality decay against noise, the proposed one is properly correlated with the noise level and blurriness of a given image. Ample simulated and real data experiments illustrate that this metric is capable of capturing the trend of quality change during the denoising process, and can be used to automatically select the denoising filter parameters that show excellent visual performance in balancing between noise suppression and detail preservation. Finally, we propose a method capable of estimating the accurate amount of local defocus blur from a single image. This method measures the probability of local defocus level. It also takes smoothness and color edge information into consideration to generate a coherent map indicating the amount of blur at each pixel. Real data experiments illustrate its good performance, and its successful applications in foreground/background segmentation...|$|R

50|$|The Scheinergrade (Sch.) {{system was}} devised by the German {{astronomer}} Julius Scheiner (1858-1913) in 1894 originally {{as a method}} of comparing the speeds of plates used for <b>astronomical</b> <b>photography.</b> Scheiner's system rated the speed of a plate by the least exposure to produce a visible darkening upon development. Speed was expressed in degrees Scheiner, originally ranging from 1° Sch. to 20° Sch., where an increment of 19° Sch. corresponded to a hundredfold increase in sensitivity, which meant that an increment of 3° Sch. came close to a doubling of sensitivity.|$|E

50|$|The focal lengths {{are made}} equal for the lines C and F. In the {{neighborhood}} of 550 nm the tangent to the curve {{is parallel to the}} axis of wavelengths; and the focal length varies least over a fairly large range of color, therefore in this neighborhood the color union is at its best. Moreover, this region of the spectrum is that which appears brightest to the human eye, and consequently this curve of the secondary on spectrum, obtained by making , is, according to the experiments of Sir G. G. Stokes (Proc. Roy. Soc., 1878), the most suitable for visual instruments (optical achromatism,). In a similar manner, for systems used in photography, the vertex of the color curve must be placed in the position of the maximum sensibility of the plates; this is generally supposed to be at G'; and to accomplish this the F and violet mercury lines are united. This artifice is specially adopted in objectives for <b>astronomical</b> <b>photography</b> (pure actinic achromatism). For ordinary photography, however, there is this disadvantage: the image on the focusing-screen and the correct adjustment of the photographic sensitive plate are not in register; in <b>astronomical</b> <b>photography</b> this difference is constant, but in other kinds it depends on the distance of the objects. On this account the lines D and G' are united for ordinary photographic objectives; the optical as well as the actinic image is chromatically inferior, but both lie in the same place; and consequently the best correction lies in F (this is known as the actinic correction or freedom from chemical focus).|$|E
50|$|<b>Astronomical</b> <b>photography</b> {{is one of}} the {{earliest}} types of scientific photography and almost from its inception it diversified into subdisciplines that each have a specific goal including star cartography, astrometry, stellar classification, photometry, spectroscopy, polarimetry, and the discovery of astronomical objects such as asteroids, meteors, comets, variable stars, novae, and even unknown planets. These all require specialized equipment such as telescopes designed for precise imaging, for wide field of view (such as Schmidt cameras), or for work at specific wavelengths of light. Astronomical CCD cameras may use cryogenic cooling to reduce thermal noise and to allow the detector to record images in other spectra such as in infrared astronomy. Specialized filters are also used to record images in specific wavelengths.|$|E
