5|$|In {{the first}} attempt to {{understand}} the many species, Lull found two groups, {{although he did not}} say how he distinguished them: one composed of T. horridus, T. prorsus, <b>and</b> <b>T.</b> brevicornus; the other of T. elatus <b>and</b> <b>T.</b> calicornis. Two species (T. serratus <b>and</b> <b>T.</b> flabellatus) stood apart from these groups. By 1933, and his revision of the landmark 1907 Hatcher-Marsh-Lull monograph of all known ceratopsians, he retained his two groups and two unaffiliated species, with a third lineage of T. obtusus <b>and</b> <b>T.</b> hatcheri that was characterized by a very small nasal horn. T. horridus-T. prorsus-T. brevicornus was now thought to be the most conservative lineage, with an increase in skull size and a decrease in nasal horn size, <b>and</b> <b>T.</b> elatus-T. calicornis was defined by large brow horns and small nasal horn. C. M. Sternberg made one modification, adding T. eurycephalus and suggesting that it linked the second and third lineages closer together than they were to the T. horridus lineage. This pattern was followed until the major studies of the 1980s and 1990s.|$|E

5|$|These {{findings}} were contested {{a few years}} later by Catherine Forster, who reanalyzed Triceratops material more comprehensively and concluded that the remains fell into two species, T. horridus <b>and</b> <b>T.</b> prorsus, although the distinctive skull of T. ("Nedoceratops") hatcheri differed enough to warrant a separate genus. She found that T. horridus and several other species belonged together, <b>and</b> <b>T.</b> prorsus <b>and</b> <b>T.</b> brevicornus stood alone, and since there were many more specimens in the first group, she suggested that this meant the two groups were two species. It is still possible to interpret the differences as representing a single species with sexual dimorphism.|$|E
