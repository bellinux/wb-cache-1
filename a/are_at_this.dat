25|$|England's group {{games in}} the World Cup 2011 were watched by up to four million viewers on German television, but less than a million on BBC, which means even with no German involvement, England games <b>are</b> <b>at</b> <b>this</b> point more popular in Germany than in the country the England team {{actually}} represents. Observers do not lead this gap in popularity back {{to a lack of}} gender equality in England, but to the simple fact, that the German women's team is far more successful, and therefore women's football is in the focus of media coverage in Germany.|$|E

The episode is structured similarly to the Breaking Bad episode [...] "4 Days Out". Alan Sepinwall of HitFix wrote: [...] "'18 Miles Out' has a title that's {{very similar to}} '4 Days Out', {{one of the most}} memorable episodes of Breaking Bad, and a structure that's relatively similar: our two leads go on a long drive together for what should be a routine bit of business, have a lot of conversations about where they <b>are</b> <b>at</b> <b>this</b> point, and then hit a major obstacle that might keep them from driving home alive." [...] While driving in his car, Rick tells Shane of an incident with a close relative, who was sitting in blizzard-like conditions while listening to a narrative of Lord of the Rings. A scene towards the end of the episode contains the song Driver's Seat by rock band Sniff 'n' the Tears. In the concluding scene of [...] "18 Miles Out", the song [...] "Civilian" [...] by indie folk band Wye Oak can be heard playing in the background.|$|E

500|$|In {{the early}} 1580s, with the {{development}} of English colonization schemes, initially in Ireland and later in North America, a new method to alleviate the condition of the poor would be suggested and utilized considerably over time. [...] Merchant and colonization proponent, George Peckham noted the then-current domestic conditions; [...] "there <b>are</b> <b>at</b> <b>this</b> day great numbers which Hue in such penurie & want, as they could be content to hazard their Hues, and to [...] one yeere for meat, drinke and apparell only, without wages, in hope thereby to amend their estates." [...] With this, he may have been the first to suggest what became the institution of [...] indentured service. [...] At the same time Richard Hakluyt, in his preface to Divers Voyages, likens English planters to [...] "Bees...led out by their Captaines to swarme abroad"; he recommends [...] "deducting" [...] the poor out of the realm. Hakluyt also broadens the scope and additionally recommends to empty the prisons and send them off to the New World. By 1619 Virginia's system of indentured service would be fully developed, and subsequent colonies would adopt the method with modifications suitable to their different conditions and times. English penal transportation would be implemented soon afterwards, and evolve into a subsidized government endeavor with the Transportation Act 1717.|$|E

2500|$|Once in the stratosphere, the {{physical}} removal mechanisms affecting the timescale of the soot particles' residence are {{how quickly the}} aerosol of soot collides and coagulates with other particles via Brownian motion, and falls out of the atmosphere via gravity-driven dry deposition, and {{the time it takes}} for the [...] "phoretic effect" [...] to move coagulated particles to a lower level in the atmosphere. Whether by coagulation or the phoretic effect, once the aerosol of smoke particles <b>are</b> <b>at</b> <b>this</b> lower atmospheric level, cloud seeding can begin, permitting precipitation to wash the smoke aerosol out of the atmosphere by the wet deposition mechanism.|$|E

[...] Her comments on grade separations were contradicted a month later by a government transport spokesman in a newspaper article on the traffic congestion at the level crossing on Murrumbeena Rd adjacent to Murrumbeena station. The spokesman, Bill Kyriakopoulos, said grade separation at Murrumbeena [...] "was not being considered as a long-term solution".|$|E
