40|$|Best of Both Worlds (BOBW) is {{a program}} at Otterbein University for Westerville City School District {{students}} who have identified disabilities. The BOBW program is a comprehensive transition program, providing instruction in work skills, community participation skills, independent living skills, and self-advocacy skills. Same-aged peers (Otterbein students) work with the BOBW students and assist them {{in the development of}} a healthy, <b>active</b> <b>adult</b> <b>life,</b> through a peer buddy workout program. Gait disorders are common in individuals with a neurological disorder. These gait disorders have then been linked to increased incidence for falls. Falls are one of the most common risks that individuals have due to leg weakness, sudden knee buckling, small slow steps, swaying gait, hyperkinetic gait, or a crouching gait. The purpose of this study was to determine the impact of using auditory versus visual feedback on the gait patterns of college-age individuals with disabilities. The focus for this study was to examine the gait of these young adults with disabilities and provide two different interventions to attempt to improve gait parameters that have been associated with increased fall risk. This study could enhance the BOBW mission by implementing an intervention with the intention of improving the gait in individuals with neurological disabilities to improve their overall motor function and decrease injury risk. This research was a case study with a pre/post-test design to examine the effect of auditory and visual feedback on the gait parameters of the two individuals in the study. Specifically the following three walking tests were implemented before and after the intervention: Timed “Up 2 ̆ 6 Go” Test (TUG), the Two-Minute Walk Test (2 MWT), and the Four Square Step Test (FSST). Participants took part in eight-weeks of augmented feedback intervention while walking on a treadmill. The participants were randomly assigned to participate in either metronome or visual retraining during the first four-weeks followed by the alternate intervention the following four-weeks. In this case study design, the subjects served as their own controls. Data was collected prior to any intervention, after the first type of feedback (4 weeks) and again at the end of the study (8 weeks). Descriptive statistics and graphs were implemented to compare the changes in the dependent variables over the eight-week study. After the eight-week study, both subjects improved in all dependent variables that were chosen for the study. Both subjects improved their gait and decreased fall risk factors as indicated by the improvement of the dependent variables across the course of the study. Although this study was a case study design, the improvements observed in both subjects lend support to further investigation of augmented feedback training as a way to improve gait parameters in young adults with disabilities. Further research with a larger sample size would need to be completed...|$|E
50|$|It was {{previously}} {{believed that the}} human thymus remained active {{as the site of}} T cell differentiation only until early adulthood and that later in <b>adult</b> <b>life</b> the thymus atrophies, perhaps even vanishing. Recent reports indicate that the human thymus is <b>active</b> throughout <b>adult</b> <b>life.</b> Thus several factors may contribute to the supply of T cells in adult life: generation in the thymus, extra-thymic differentiation, and the fact that memory T cells are long-lived and survive for decades.|$|R

40|$|AbstractSuppressor of Hairless [Su(H) ]/Lag- 1 /RBP-Jκ/CBF 1 is {{the only}} known transducing {{transcription}} factor for Notch receptor signaling. Here, we show that Su(H) has three distinct functions {{in the development of}} external mechanosensory organs in Drosophila: Notch-dependent transcriptional activation and a novel auto-repression function, both of which direct cell fate decisions, and a novel auto-activation function required for normal socket cell differentiation. This third phase of activity, the first known Notch-independent activation function for Su(H) in development, depends on a cell type-specific autoregulatory enhancer that is <b>active</b> throughout <b>adult</b> <b>life</b> and is required for proper mechanoreception. These results establish a direct link between a broadly deployed cell signaling pathway and an essential physiological function of the nervous system...|$|R

40|$|International audienceOur {{knowledge}} of heredity has recently undergone major upheaval. Heredity transmits {{considerably more than}} just genetic elements: 1) the oocyte is full of maternal cytoplasmic components subsequently present in each new cell 2) maternal cells are able to pass to the progeny, and they remain <b>active</b> into <b>adult</b> <b>life</b> (microchimerism). Here we examine {{the notion that the}} transmission of characters involves at least two processes besides that of Mendelian heredity, long considered to be the only hereditary mechanism. These processes, which all involve epigenetic processes, involve the transmission of macromolecules, subcellular organelles and living cells solely from the mother to her offspring, be they female or male, during pregnancy and lactation. We postulate that cytoplasmic heredity and maternal transmission of cells leading to a long-term state of microchimerism in progeny are two good examples of matrilineal non-Mendelian heredity. A mother's important contribution to the development and health of her progeny seems to possess many uncharted depths...|$|R

After being expelled, he worked with the organized Italian left, {{became one of the}} leaders of the Internationalist Communist Party, commonly known by their paper Battaglia Comunista. The Internationalist Communist Party formally founded in 1945, was numerically the largest left-communist organization in the post-World War II period. In 1952, Amadeo Bordiga, who had by then fully came out of retirement to found the International Communist Party, known by its paper Programma Comunista. Many elements of the original Internationalist Communist Party left to join the party Bordiga had formed. Onorato Damen lead the older party that did not follow Amadeo Bordiga into the new party but rather maintained the original name Internationalist Communist Party, maintained the original theoretical journal Prometeo, and their paper Battaglia Communista.

Cross to serve as Judge for Auburn Municipal Court for three successive appointments (1946-1958)5 and enjoyed a distinguished career as an attorney and jurist. He served as chairman of the Juvenile Delinquency Committee of the Municipal Judges Association, dedimus justice and disclosure commissioner and chairman of the Legislative Committee of the Androscoggin County Law Library. Conant was a Legislative Agent for the Maine Good Roads Association from 1955-1961. He was an authority on state highway matters. Throughout his career, he received special recognition numerous times for his work on behalf of individuals and groups. In 1955 he was elected Judge Advocate of the VFW Department of Maine.

Gatot's fame rests on his own statement that he presented to the Japanese occupation authorities an impassioned petition written in his own blood pleading them to allow the Indonesians to form their own defence force. He made this statement in his memoirs, which were published in the journal Indonesia under the title: 'The PETA and My Relations with the Japanese; A Correction of Sukarno's Autobiography'. Some people cast doubt about the reliability of his statement, which resulted in heated debate in Indonesia in 1975. This debate however failed to clarify the issue in part because people’s access to source materials was limited at that time. Gatot's memoirs merit re-examination because they concern some key issues in modern Indonesian history and also because his memoirs, often cited uncritically, are, as this article will show, riddled with inaccuracies, both large and small...|$|R

40|$|Insulin-like {{growth factor}} (IGF) -I has {{profound}} effects on tissue repair. IGF-II is felt to exert its influence predominately during fetal development. The {{purpose of this}} study was to localize and quantify the expression of IGF-I and IGF-II mRNA and protein during early wound healing in diabetic and nondiabetic mice. The hypothesis is that IGF-I and IGF-II are up-regulated in the healing wound, but their expression is inhibited in diabetics. Full-thickness cutaneous wounds were made on genetically diabetic (C 57 BL/ KsJ-db/db) mice and their nondiabetic littermates. At various times after wounding, one-half of each wound was fixed and paraffin embedded for immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridization. The other half was flash-frozen for quantification of IGF mRNA by competitive reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction and protein by radioimmunoassay. IGF-I mRNA rose sharply in nondiabetics at day 3. Expression in diabetic wounds was significantly delayed until 14 days after wounding. Even then, diabetic IGF-I mRNA levels were 50 % less than those in the nondiabetics at their peak. Although not usually considered <b>active</b> in <b>adult</b> <b>life,</b> IGF-II mRNA expression was augmented after wounding, peaking at 3 days in nondiabetics. As with IGF-I, diabetic wounds exhibited a delay in IGF-II mRNA expression, with maximal levels at 10 days after wounding. Interestingly, peak concentrations of IGF-II mRNA were four times greater in diabetics versus nondiabetics. Trends in IGF-I protein expression followed the patterns of mRNA expression. IGF-I levels in nondiabetics were initially double those in diabetics and peaked at 5 days. Diabetic wound concentrations of IGF-I did not peak until 21 days after wounding, at which time they rose to nondiabetic levels. IGF-I and IGF-II proteins were localized to the advancing epithelial edge, to the epithelial cells of adjacent hair follicles, and to the granulation tissue of the wounds. IGF-I and IGF-II mRNA expression was noted in the epithelial edge and in the hair follicles adjacent to the wound, paralleling protein expression. Both IGF-I and IGF-II are up-regulated in the healing wound. A delay in IGF-I and -II presence is noted in the diabetic wound. The impairment in tissue repair in diabetic animals is at least partially due to a deficiency in the production of the IGFs...|$|R
