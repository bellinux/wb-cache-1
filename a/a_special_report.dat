The Centennial Expo Pilipino project, intended to be the centerpiece for the celebrations for the 100th anniversary of the country's independence from Spain, also earned extensive criticisms for being an expensive white elephant project that disadvantaged the government at the cost of P9 billion, or 1.7 percent of the country's 1998 national budget. Six ranking Ramos cabinet members and officials, headed by Salvador Laurel (former Vice-President), chairman of the Centennial Commission, were cleared by the Ombudsman and Sandigan Bayan (People's Court).

Fontana said if the episode performed well, [...] "NBC's going to have to do some hard thinking." [...] In its original American broadcast on January 27, 1994, [...] "A Many Splendored Thing" [...] was watched by 11.2 million households, according to Nielsen Media Research, earning the episode an 11.9 rating. That constituted a slight increase from the previous week's episode, [...] "Black and Blue", which was seen by 10.83 million households.

According to one account, Bourke-White wanted to live in the building {{for the duration of the}} photo shoot, but the only person who could actually live in the building was the janitor, so she was relegated to co-leasing a studio instead with Time Inc. In 1930, several of her photographs were used in <b>a</b> <b>special</b> <b>report</b> on skyscrapers in the then-new Fortune magazine. In 1934, Bourke-White's partner Oscar Graubner took a famous photo called [...] "Margaret Bourke-White atop the Chrysler Building", which depicts her taking a photo of the city's skyline while sitting on the 61st-floor eagle ornaments. On October 5, 1998, Christie's auctioned the photograph for $96,000.

[...] During that four minutes of extended coverage, the studio camera broadcast the live panic and bewilderment in the ABC newsroom. The reporters who had been present to report on Kennedy's win in the primary ended up crowding into the kitchen where he had been shot and the immediate aftermath was captured only by audio recording and cameras that had no live transmission capability. ABC was able to show scant live footage from the kitchen after Kennedy had been transported but unlike CBS and NBC, all of ABC's coverage from the Ambassador was in black and white. CBS and NBC shot footage in the kitchen of the shooting's aftermath on color film, which could not be broadcast until it was developed two hours after the incident.|$|E
