5|$|Craig and Sophie {{thank the}} Doctor, Craig {{giving him a}} spare set of keys in case he ever needs it. Aboard the TARDIS, the Doctor directs Amy to write the note {{that led him to}} Craig's house, using a red pen in his jacket; she rummages around and finds the {{engagement}} ring from her husband-to-be, Rory, whom she had forgotten after he was consumed by the crack in space <b>and</b> <b>time</b> <b>and</b> erased from existence. A similar crack appears behind Craig's refrigerator, and widens.|$|E
5|$|The next story, Rikki disappeared, and {{the long}} series of adventures of Suske en Wiske began with the story Op het eiland Amoras, {{achieving}} success beyond the author's expectations. The first album appeared in 1946. This story introduced most of the recurring figures and means of transport through space <b>and</b> <b>time,</b> <b>and</b> set the framework for the complete series. Already in 1946, it was also published in the Dutch newspaper De Stem.|$|E

5|$|The {{results of}} special {{relativity}} {{can be summarized}} by treating space and time as a unified structure known as spacetime (withc relating the units of space <b>and</b> <b>time),</b> <b>and</b> requiring that physical theories satisfy a special symmetry called Lorentz invariance, whose mathematical formulation contains the parameterc. Lorentz invariance is an almost universal assumption for modern physical theories, such as quantum electrodynamics, quantum chromodynamics, the Standard Model of particle physics, and general relativity. As such, the parameterc is ubiquitous in modern physics, appearing in many contexts that are unrelated to light. For example, general relativity predicts thatc is also the speed of gravity and of gravitational waves. In non-inertial frames of reference (gravitationally curved spacetime or accelerated reference frames), the local speed of light is constant and equal toc, but {{the speed of light}} along a trajectory of finite length can differ fromc, depending on how distances and times are defined.|$|E
5|$|With Tropical Storm Cristobal {{bearing down}} on the {{recovery}} team, <b>and</b> <b>time</b> <b>and</b> money running out, the team {{made the decision to}} raise the turret on 5 August 2002, after 41 days of work, and the gun turret broke the surface at 5:30pm to the cheers of everyone aboard Wotan and other recovery ships nearby. As archaeologists examined the contents of the turret after it has been landed aboard Wotan, they discovered a second skeleton, but removing it did not begin until the turret arrived at the Mariners' Museum for conservation. The remains of these sailors were transferred to the Joint POW/MIA Accounting Command (JPAC) at Hickam Air Force Base, Hawaii, in the hope that they could be identified.|$|E

25|$|The largest scale {{application}} of hydrogenation {{is for the}} processing of vegetable oils.

25|$|It may {{be simple}} {{to write down}} the {{equations}} of motion in vector form using Newton's laws of motion, but the components may vary in complicated ways with spatial coordinates <b>and</b> <b>time,</b> <b>and</b> solving them is not easy. Often there is an excess of variables to solve for the problem completely, so Newton's laws are not always {{the most efficient way}} to determine the motion of a system. In simple cases of rectangular geometry, Newton's laws work fine in Cartesian coordinates, but in other coordinate systems can become dramatically complex.|$|E
25|$|CFD {{can give}} {{an insight into}} flow {{patterns}} that are difficult, expensive or impossible to study using experimental methods. Experiments can give a quantitative description of flow phenomena using measurements for one quantity at a time, at {{a limited number of}} points and time instances. If a full-scale model is not available or not practical, scale models or dummy models can be used. The experiments can have a limited range of problems and operating conditions. Simulations can give a prediction of flow phenomena using CFD software for all desired quantities, with high resolution in space <b>and</b> <b>time</b> <b>and</b> virtually any problem and realistic operating conditions. However, if critical, the results may need to be validated.|$|E
