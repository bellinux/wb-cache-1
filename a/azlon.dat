40|$|Text {{has been}} {{critical}} in establishing {{the identity of a}} group of largely forgotten mid- 20 th-century textiles, the <b>azlons.</b> These fibres were developed from proteins in milk, eggs, peanuts, soya beans and corn by researchers in America, Europe and Asia who were seeking substitutes for wool. This technological innovation was driven by concern that imminent war meant normal supplies of wool would become unavailable. This paper describes two of the main types of textual evidence used in developing an understanding of these fibres. The first derives from the very names of the fibres themselves and is evident in the text which is closest to the textile – the label giving the name of the fibre. Given that so few surviving examples of these fibres have been identified in museum collections, the second source of textual and contextual evidence is fashion and technical magazines, trade literature, business archives and patents as well as personal records and interviews. The huge potential of these sources will be discussed. It is hoped that this review of the benefits and limitations of textual sources will help curators and conservators identify such fibres in their collections...|$|R

40|$|As {{pressure}} {{mounted in}} mid-twentieth century Europe and America, planners were increasingly {{anxious about the}} availability of wool for military purposes. Research into substitutes focused on transforming milk, soya and maize protein into wool-like fibres; experiments were undertaken into the fibre-forming potential of egg white, feathers, fish and slaughterhouse waste. Manufacturers and politicians shared a common interest in developing these fibres, named azlons, for the war effort. Companies such as Atlantic Research Associates in America and Imperial Chemical Industries in England were directly promoting their new milk-based fibres to female consumers, making their purchase a patriotic act. Nowadays, regenerated protein fibres are being marketed as high quality ecological and biodegradable fibres. This paper presents a brief survey of development of <b>azlon</b> fibres together with a review of technical aspects of their production. Few examples of mid-twentieth century <b>azlon</b> textiles and garments have yet been identified in museum collections and accounts of their development no longer appear in standard textile histories. Issues relating to this ‘disappearance’ from cultural memory are discussed. Thompson’s rubbish theory is used to explore attitudes to the collecting of man-made materials. The implications of this for conservation practice in both identifying and treating these fibres is reviewed. <br/...|$|E
40|$|Summary {{of paper}} only {{published}} in conference post prints. In the mid-twentieth century, there was tremendous {{interest in making}} fibres from new sources. Some of this research developed the successful synthetic fibres which we know today. However, fibres were also made from various regenerated protein sources which seem unusual and surprising today. Classified as <b>Azlon</b> fibres, these had a short lived commercial life and most have now been forgotten. This paper will present research into these fibres which were made {{from a wide range}} of protein sources. The significance of these fibres lies not only in their history or technological development, but also in the motives behind the original research. Their development is often linked with the pressures for national sufficiency prior to the Second World War. Interestingly, these sources are again being explored for their fibre forming potential but this time the motivation is different and the result of surplus rather than lack. <br/...|$|E
40|$|Azlons are {{increasingly}} concerned for their excellent performance properties and biodegradation. A kind of novel <b>azlon,</b> zein/viscose textibe fibers, were fabricated by wet-spinning of zein and cellulose sulfonate blended solution. Some parameters that determine the fabrication process were optimized. The structure and properties of zein/viscose fibers were characterized, and {{compared with those}} of common viscose fibers. Dry breaking tenacity of zein/viscose fibers was 2. 02 CN/dtex, whereas dry breaking elongation was 16. 6 %. Mechanical properties of zein/viscose fibers were a little better than common viscose fibers. The moisture regain rate of zein/viscose fibers was 14. 1 %, similar to that of viscose fibers. From the microstructure of zein/viscose fiber, viscose acted as framework and zein was accreted to viscose. The content of protein was 14. 48 % in zein/viscose fibers. The basic chains of zein and viscose were not changed by blended spinning, so the fibers had advantages of both zein and viscose. (C) 2010 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
