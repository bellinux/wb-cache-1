5000|$|In time, disease {{resistant}} North <b>American</b> <b>vines</b> (including some used in Uhudler wines) were imported to Europe {{and used}} to produce wine. Many crossings between native North American and European varietals were created at this time. The wine produced did not correspond {{in any way to}} the established taste trends in Europe.

50|$|Shortly after Riley {{confirmed}} the theory proposed by Planchon, Laliman and Bazille, {{up until then}} two unknown winegrowers, proposed that the European vines, of the vinifera variety, may form a resistance to the destructive phylloxera if they were grafted with the <b>American</b> <b>vine</b> variety, which had formed a natural resistance.|$|E
50|$|A global {{phylloxera}} epidemic, {{caused by}} tiny, sap-sucking insects, {{spread through the}} Cape vineyards in the 1880s and 1890s, destroying the vines of the Boschendal area in 1890.

5000|$|Downy mildew: Also {{known as}} peronospora, thrives in high {{temperatures}} and humidity and produces stains on leaves. Peronospora {{can be treated}} by spraying plants with copper sulphate. Most <b>American</b> <b>vines</b> are resistant, excluding Vitis vinifera.|$|R
5|$|For a few centuries, Europeans had {{experimented with}} <b>American</b> <b>vines</b> and plants in their soil, and many {{varieties}} were imported from America without regulation, disregarding {{the possibility of}} pest transfer, and related problems. Jules-Emile Planchon, a French biologist, who identified the Phylloxera in the 1860s, maintained that this transfer of <b>American</b> <b>vines</b> and plants into Europe greatly increased between roughly 1858 and 1862, {{and this is how}} the Phylloxera was accidentally introduced to Europe around 1860, although the aphid did not enter France until around 1863. It is believed that the advent of steamships was a factor as well, as the ships were faster, and the Phylloxera were able to survive the quicker ocean voyage.|$|R
50|$|While {{better quality}} wines (vinho fino) are {{produced}} from the European grapevine Vitis vinifera, in 2003 only some 5000 ha out of Brazil's 68000 ha were planted with such vines.

50|$|Like {{many other}} <b>American</b> <b>vine</b> species, Vitis labrusca has some natural {{resistance}} to many grape diseases, including phylloxera. However, its resistance and grafting compatibility {{is not as}} high as other species, such as Vitis aestivalis, Vitis rupestris and Vitis berlandieri, and is not often used for commercial rootstock. It is a robust plant, and in many states can be considered weedy or invasive.|$|E

50|$|During {{the devastating}} {{phylloxera}} blight in late 19th-century Europe, {{it was found}} that Native <b>American</b> <b>vines</b> were immune to the pest. French-American hybrid grapes were developed and saw some use in Europe, but more important was the practice of grafting European grapevines to American rootstocks to protect vineyards from the insect. The practice continues to this day wherever phylloxera is present.|$|R
50|$|Roquemaure is {{believed}} to be the site where phylloxera, an insect that attacks the roots of grapevines, was first introduced into France from North America. In 1862 a local wine merchant, Mr. Borty, received a case containing rooted <b>American</b> <b>vines</b> from a New York vine-grower, Mr. Carle. This case contained native grapevines, including 'Clinton', 'Post-Oak', and 'Emily'. Mr. Borty, planted these <b>American</b> <b>vines</b> in ten rows within his walled garden at 21 rue Longue (renamed rue Placide Cappeau). The following summer in a vineyard at the nearby village of Pujaut, a number of vines began to die. By 1864 Borty's own Grenache and Alicante vines were showing symptoms of phylloxera infection. All the vines in the neighbouring village of Pujaut were either dead or dying by 1865 and the initial infection had spread to the towns of Orange and St-Rémy. By the end of 1868 the whole of the lower Rhône Valley was infected and by 1890 phylloxera had spread across most of France.|$|R
50|$|<b>American</b> <b>vine</b> species (such as Vitis labrusca) {{have evolved}} to have several natural {{defenses}} against phylloxera. The roots of the American vines exude a sticky sap that repels the nymph form when it tries to feed from the vine by clogging its mouth. If the nymph is successful in creating a feeding wound on the root, American vines respond by forming a protective layer of tissue to cover the wound and protect it from secondary bacterial or fungal infections.|$|E
5000|$|Harmine, {{also known}} as telepathine, is a {{fluorescent}} harmala alkaloid belonging to the beta-carboline family of compounds. It occurs {{in a number of}} different plants, most notably the Middle Eastern plant harmal or Syrian rue (Peganum harmala) and the South <b>American</b> <b>vine</b> Banisteriopsis caapi ({{also known as}} [...] "yage" [...] or [...] "ayahuasca"). Harmine reversibly inhibits monoamine oxidase A (MAO-A), an enzyme which breaks down monoamines, making it a RIMA. Harmine selectively binds to MAO-A but does not inhibit the variant MAO-B.|$|E
50|$|At the {{beginning}} of the 20th century, the appearance of Phylloxera led to the introduction of the resistant <b>American</b> <b>vine</b> but did not change the economy much. The Spanish Civil War broke this development, and the city's population decreased. From the 1940s to the 1970s the only economical activities were agriculture and the traditional family industry of wine, a common phenomenon of central Spain in these times. In the 1980s, Valdepeñas saw a modernization of the wine sector, including new kinds of grapes, and the introduction of techniques in wine production.|$|E

50|$|Dauricine is a plant metabolite, {{chemically}} {{classified as}} a phenol, an aromatic ether, and an isoquinoline alkaloid. It has been isolated from the Asian vine Menispermum dauricum, commonly known as Asian moonseed, and the North <b>American</b> <b>vine</b> Menispermum canadense, commonly known as Canadian moonseed. Scientists Tetsuji Kametani and Keiichiro Fukumoto of Japan are credited with being the first to synthesize dauricine in 1964, using both the Arndt-Eistert reaction and Bischler-Napieralski reaction to do so. Dauricine has been show to play a variety of biological roles in the human body, from inhibiting cancer cell growth to blocking cardiac transmembrane Na+, K+, and Ca2+ ion currents.|$|E
50|$|According to wine {{historian}} Edward Hyams {{and wine}} expert Jancis Robinson, Vitis labrusca {{was probably the}} species seen by Leif Ericsson growing wild {{along the coast of}} Vinland in the 11th century. There is ample evidence that the labrusca was growing wild in North America before Europeans arrived. However, the vine was not officially identified and recorded until Carl Linnaeus and his peers started cataloging <b>American</b> <b>vine</b> species in the mid-18th century. In the 19th century, Vitis labrusca was among the American vines transported to Europe that were carrying the phylloxera louse which would cause widespread devastation to the European vineyards planted with Vitis vinifera.|$|E
50|$|A hybrid {{is a new}} grape {{variety that}} was {{produced}} from a cross pollination of two different grape species. In {{the early history of}} American winemaking, grape growers would cross the European Vitis vinifera vines with <b>American</b> <b>vine</b> varieties such as Vitis labrusca to create French-American hybrids that were more resistant to American grape diseases such as downy and powdery mildew as well as phylloxera. When the phylloxera epidemic of the mid to late 19th century hit Europe, some growers in European wine regions experimented with using hybrids until a solution involving grafting American rootstocks to vinifera varieties was found. Eventually the use of hybrids in wine production declined with their use formally outlawed by European wine laws in the 1950s.|$|E
50|$|This blight {{was brought}} on by a species of aphid that {{originated}} in North America and was carried across the Atlantic Ocean sometime in the late 1850s/early 1860s. However, how the phyolloxera had survived the journey remained a point of much debate; Europeans had experimented with <b>American</b> <b>vines</b> for centuries without any pestilential problems. Eventually, it was decided that, following the invention of steamboats, the grape phylloxera were able to survive the shortened journey.|$|R

50|$|After Charles Valentine Riley, Missouri's state entomologist, {{confirmed}} Planchon's theory, Leo Laliman and Gaston Bazille, two French wine growers, both {{suggested the}} possibility that if vinifera vines could be combined, by means of grafting, with the aphid-resistant <b>American</b> <b>vines,</b> then the problem might be solved. Thomas Volney Munson was consulted and provided native Texan rootstocks for grafting. Because of Munson's role, the French government in 1888 sent a delegation to Denison to confer on him the French Legion of Honor Chevalier du Mérite Agricole.|$|R
5000|$|The {{condition}} of Mississippi’s climate and Terroir makes {{it nearly impossible}} to grow Vitis vinifera, or French hybrid grape varieties. Mississippi wineries cultivate the http://www.wine-searcher.com/grape-1106-muscadine muscadine grape and its varieties due to its abundance throughout the region and resistance to humid conditions. Muscadine is the title given {{to a group of}} vine varieties most common in the South-Eastern United States. The varieties of the muscadine grape can be either light or dark and have very thick skins which make them highly resistant to fungal and bacterial diseases that thrive in humid weather. As the health benefits of wine gain significance in the wine industry, so do muscadines, as it is known that their thick skins contain high levels of the compound Resveratrol, which is linked to heart health and cancer prevention. Also of great prevalence, is the muscadine’s opposition to Phylloxera, which plagued Europe’s vineyards in the late 19th century. This evolutionary trait has helped scientists in making noteworthy progress towards finding a solution for phylloxera. Consequently, almost all Vitis vinifera vines are joined with elements of phylloxera-resistant <b>American</b> <b>vine</b> species like the muscadine.|$|E
5000|$|Jewish vine {{cultivation}} {{on a large}} {{commercial scale}} began in 1882 {{with the opening of}} the Carmel Winery in Rishon LeZion (in Israel). It was the initiative of Baron Edmond James de Rothschild who invested millions of francs to develop Palestinian viticulture, the growing and the production of wines and cognacs. <b>American</b> <b>vine</b> stocks were imported upon which French shoot were grafted. French experts were brought over to assist in the project. A large wine cellar was built and modern machinery was installed. Rothschild was nevertheless forced to purchase Palestinian wine at above-market prices to keep the operation viable. [...] The kosher sweet red wine was generally unsophisticated and unappealing, and when British Prime Minister Benjamin Disraeli was offered some, he remarked that it tasted [...] "not so much like wine, but more like what I expect to receive from my doctor as a remedy for a bad winter cough." [...] Other wineries established in this period and still functioning today include the Cremisan Monastery, near Bethlehem, where Italian Salesian monks have been making wine since 1885 and at the Latrun Monastery where French Trappist monks began winemaking in 1899. Vineyard acreage in the Jewish sector totalled around 11,000 dunam in 1890 and around 26,000 dunam by 1900.|$|E

After the repeal of Prohibition, during a time in which shipping technology had improved, and the ships no longer needed to stop off in Madeira, the island which was directly in the trade winds between Europe and America.
