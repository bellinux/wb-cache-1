5|$|The Buckeye is {{the only}} purely American breed to sport a pea comb, and this, {{combined}} with its stocky build, makes it a supremely cold hardy chicken. Other breeds of fowl developed in the U.S. (such as the Ameraucana) may sport pea combs, but these chickens were primarily created from foreign birds. It also bears some traits of Game fowl in frame and disposition, being assertive in character <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>good</b> forager. Generally calm, the cock birds in rare cases may become aggressive. Despite its game heritage, it tolerates confinement well, although {{it will be much}} happier and produce better if allowed to range on grass. The Buckeye is said by breeders to be disinclined towards feather picking. A good meat producer and layer of between 150 and 200 eggs per year, the Buckeye is a dual purpose chicken wellsuited to small farmyard and backyard flocks.|$|E

500|$|Danger: Diabolik began filming on April 11, 1967. Roger Vadim {{suggested}} to De Laurentiis that he cast his ex-fiancée Catherine Deneuve as Eva Kant. Law noted that Bava was against this idea and felt personally that Deneuve was {{wrong for the}} role, noting that [...] "there was no chemistry between us. She was very sweet, <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>good</b> actress, but she was simply not right for the part." [...] After one week of shooting with Deneuve, both Bava and De Laurentiis felt {{that she should be}} replaced. Bava was given the opportunity to cast the role, and narrowed his choices to Marilù Tolo and Marisa Mell, with Mell eventually getting the role.|$|E

That is why stories of racism really disturb me. [...] Because in truth I believe ALL men are created equal, I was taught that and will always believe it. I just can’t conceive of how a person could hate another because of skin color. I love every race on the planet earth. Prejudice is the child of ignorance.

2500|$|Dell'Utri was the go-between on a {{range of}} {{legislative}} efforts to ease pressure on mafiosi in exchange for electoral support, according to Giuffrè. [...] "Dell'Utri was very close to Cosa Nostra <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>good</b> contact point for Berlusconi," [...] he said. Mafia boss Bernardo Provenzano told Giuffrè that they [...] "were in good hands" [...] with Dell'Utri, who was a [...] "serious and trustworthy person". Dell'Utri's lawyer, Enrico Trantino, dismissed Giuffrè's allegations as an [...] "anthology of hearsay". He said Giuffrè had perpetuated the trend that every new turncoat would attack Dell'Utri and the former Christian Democrat prime minister Giulio Andreotti in order to earn money and judicial privileges.|$|E
2500|$|Ada {{was born}} at St Germans, Norfolk, the second child of Thomasine and Henry Cambridge, a gentleman farmer. She was educated by governesses, an {{experience}} she abhorred.

2500|$|Given {{the failure}} of the mud brick {{buildings}} and lack of compliance with the 1989 Iranian seismic code, the reconstruction in Bam paid special attention to using earthquake durable materials. Dr. Hamid Eskander, in charge of the Bam reconstruction effort, said [...] "There will be no more mud brick in Bam. The new design will {{have to take into account}} proper seismic design techniques and parameters. When you go with the old-style buildings and old-style engineering you're looking for trouble so we're going to change it now." [...] Horst Indorf, a representative for permanent shelter issues from ASB, a German non-government organization, frowned on the use of iron structures in the city given its movement during an earthquake, saying [...] "The best architecture for this area is clay brick (with nets) but this means 80 to 90cm thick walls <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>good</b> insulated roof".|$|E
2500|$|In late 1842, Jardine's health had rapidly {{deteriorated}} possibly from pulmonary oedema. In {{the latter}} part of the year, Jardine was already bedridden and in great pain. He was assisted by his nephew, Andrew Johnstone and later on by James Matheson in his correspondence. Despite his illness, Jardine was still very active in keeping an eye on business, politics and current affairs. Despite his poor health, he still welcomed a steady stream of visitors from family members, business partners, political associates and his constituents. A constituent, James Stewart, once commented to a friend who wrote this letter, [...] "...he (Stewart) had come mainly to see one Jardine, an enormous Laird from Applegarth Parish and China, <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>good</b> man; who is understood to be dangerously ill at present." [...] It is interesting to note that Jardine had helped James Stewart's son William by giving him a place in the firm in Canton as a clerk in the 1830s and eventually became a partner in 1842.|$|E
2500|$|Kerr was {{promoted}} to commander on 30 June 1927, and in December 1928 he was given command of the destroyer HMS Windsor, followed by HMS Thruster in August 1929.

[...] He {{stepped down from the}} position on 22 May 1936. [...] His commander, Admiral Thomson, reported that he had found Kerr to be [...] "A very capable Captain (D) who has trained his Flotilla well. An officer probably much better suited to the practical side of naval life rather than to Staff duties. A strong personality with definite powers of command <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>good</b> seaman. Most loyal and is very thorough in the carrying out of his duties. Social qualities good.

2500|$|According to {{yet another}} Mafia turncoat, Antonino Giuffrè– arrested on 16 April 2002– the Mafia turned to Berlusconi's Forza Italia party {{to look after the}} Mafia's {{interests}}, after the decline in the early 1990s of the ruling Christian Democratic party, whose leaders in Sicily looked after the Mafia's interests in Rome. The Mafia's fall out with the Christian Democrats became clear when Salvo Lima was killed in March 1992. [...] "The Lima murder marked the end of an era," [...] Giuffrè told the court. [...] "A new era opened with a new political force on the horizon which provided the guarantees that the Christian Democrats were no longer able to deliver. To be clear, that party was Forza Italia." [...] Dell'Utri was the go-between on a range of legislative efforts to ease pressure on mafiosi in exchange for electoral support, according to Giuffrè. [...] "Dell'Utri was very close to Cosa Nostra <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>good</b> contact point for Berlusconi," [...] he said. Mafia boss Bernardo Provenzano told Giuffrè that they [...] "were in good hands" [...] with Dell'Utri, who was a [...] "serious and trustworthy person". Provenzano stated that the Mafia's judicial problems would be resolved within 10 years of 1992, thanks to the undertakings given by Forza Italia.|$|E
2500|$|Before I Self Destruct has {{received}} generally positive reviews from music critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album received an average score of 62, based on 15 reviews. Allmusic called it [...] "a fantastic juggernaut of a 50 album if you exit early, <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>good</b> one {{even if you}} don't". Entertainment Weekly wrote that [...] "Growling violent threats over hard beats, 50 sounds the hungriest he has in years. Of course, there’s nothing remotely original about the formula he’s returning to, but at least he’s {{going through the motions}} with gusto". The A.V. Club said that, [...] "If Destruct qualifies as a pleasant surprise, it’s only because 50 Cent’s last few releases set the bar so low. Still, {{for the first time since}} The Massacre, it’s once again intermittently fun to root for the bad guy" [...] Pitchfork Media wrote that, [...] "After initially promising a return to form, 50 doesn't have the ability or initiative to hold the listener's interest over the long run." [...] PopMatters said that, [...] "With surprisingly little filler, renewed energy, and the unique glimpse Before I Self Destruct offers into the psyche of a public figure as intriguing as Curtis Jackson, 50 Cent has crafted easily his best album since [...] "Get Rich or Die Trying." ...|$|E
2500|$|In November 1997, {{the press}} {{revealed}} that after 13 years playing Kathy, Gillian Taylforth had {{opted not to}} renew her contract when it expired in March 1998. Taylforth commented, [...] "I love EastEnders, it's in my blood. But after 12 years I want {{a bit of a}} change. I want {{to spend more time with}} my family and consider other offers. It was an extremely difficult decision to make but I felt this was the best time to go. I've had alternative job offers in the past, but I've always stuck with EastEnders. It's been brilliant for me and I will miss it hugely." [...] At the time, a BBC spokesperson would not confirm the departure saying, [...] "Gilly is in discussions about taking a possible break. It is the policy that long-serving, valued, senior cast members are eligible for such breaks." [...] However, her departure was later confirmed, with Taylforth saying that she made the decision to quit after she missed her daughter's sports day due to filming commitments on set. Barbara Windsor, who plays Kathy's mother-in-law Peggy Mitchell, said: [...] "This is really sad. Gill is a wonderful actress <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>good</b> friend."
