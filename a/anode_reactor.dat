40|$|Abstract Microbial {{fuel cells}} which are {{operated}} in continuous mode are {{more suitable for}} practical applications than fed batch ones. Three influent types containing carbohydrates were tested, i. e. a glucose medium, a plant extract and artificial wastewater. The <b>anode</b> <b>reactor</b> compartment yielding the best results was a packed bed reactor containing graphite granules. While in non-mediated batch systems power outputs up to 479 W m- 3 of anode compartment could be attained; in continuous mode the power outputs were limited to 49 W m- 3. Cyclic voltammetry was performed to determine the potential of the in-situ synthesized bacterial redox mediators. Addition of mediators with a potential similar to the bacterial potential did not significantly alter the MFC power output, indicating a limited influence of soluble mediators for continuous microbial fuel cells. Maximum coulombic and energy conversion efficiencies were, for the continuous microbial fuel cell operating on plant extract at a loading rate of 1 kg COD m- 3 of anode compartment per day, 50. 3 % and 26. 0 % respectively...|$|E
40|$|The overall process {{enhancement}} {{by different}} electrical current application on the biological phosphorus release and uptake have been investigated. Five reactors were constructed for three experiments and activated sludge {{was used as}} inoculums. In Exp. 1 by comparing the control and the bio-electrochemical reactors, {{it was found that}} the overall phosphorus removal efficiency could be enhanced at lower electrical current applications of 5. mA and 10. mA, but were restrained at higher than 20. mA, although 20. mA could be a sensitive turning point. Moreover, the electrochemical effects of the cathodic and the anodic reactions on the phosphorus release and uptake, respectively, have been further evaluated separately under an electrical current application of 10. mA in Exp. 2 and Exp. 3, respectively. As observed, both of the biological release and uptake were improved by the cathodic reactions in the cathode reactor, but not by the anodic reactions in the <b>anode</b> <b>reactor,</b> and thus indicated that the cathodic reactions play an important role in the improvement of the biological phosphorus release and uptake. © 2012 Elsevier B.

Correlations were not observed between the levels of most metabolites related to glycolysis and current density. The intracellular concentrations of acetyl-CoA were higher at pH 4.0 and pH 5.5 than at pH 7.0, implying that the accumulation of organic acids at pH 4.0 and pH 5.5 inhibited carbon flux via acetyl-CoA (Fig.  3).|$|R
40|$|Graphite fiber brush {{electrodes}} provide high surface {{areas for}} exoelectrogenic bacteria in microbial fuel cells (MFCs), but the cylindrical brush format limits more compact reactor designs. To enable MFC designs with closer electrode spacing, brush anodes were {{pressed up against}} a separator (placed between the electrodes) to reduce the volume occupied by the brush. Higher maximum voltages were produced using domestic wastewater (COD = 390 ± 89 mg L- 1) with brush anodes (360 ± 63 mV, 1000 Ω) than woven carbon mesh anodes (200 ± 81 mV) {{with one or two}} separators. Maximum power densities were similar for brush <b>anode</b> <b>reactors</b> with one or two separators after 30 days (220 ± 1. 2 and 240 ± 22 mW m- 2), but with one separator the brush anode MFC power decreased to 130 ± 55 mW m- 2 after 114 days. Power densities in MFCs with mesh anodes were very low (< 45 mW m- 2). Brush anodes MFCs had higher COD removals (80 ± 3 %) than carbon mesh MFCs (58 ± 7 %), but similar Coulombic efficiencies (8. 6 ± 2. 9 % brush; 7. 8 ± 7. 1 % mesh). These results show that compact (hemispherical) brush anodes can produce higher power and more effective domestic wastewater treatment than flat mesh anodes in MFCs. © 2011 Elsevier B. V.

40|$|The anode {{electrode}} {{is one of}} {{the most}} important components in all microbial electrochemical technologies (METs). Anode materials pretreatment and modification have been shown to be an effective method of improving anode performance. According to mass loss analysis during carbon fiber heating, five temperatures (300, 450, 500, 600, and 750 °C) were selected as the pre-heating temperatures of carbon fiber brush anodes. Microbial fuel cell (MFC) reactors built up with these pre-heated carbon brush anodes performed with different power densities and Coulombic efficiencies (CEs). Two kinds of measuring methods for power density were applied, and the numerical values of maximum power densities diverged greatly. Reactors with 450 °C anodes, using both methods, had the highest power densities, and the highest CEs were found using 500 °C <b>anode</b> <b>reactors.</b> The surface elements of heat-treated carbon fibers were analyzed using X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS), and C, O, and N were the main constituents of the carbon fiber. There were four forms of N 1 s at the surface of the polyacrylonitrile (PAN) -based carbon fiber, and their concentrations were different at different temperature samples. The microbial community of the anode surface was analyzed, and microbial species on anodes from every sample were similar. The differences in anode performance may be caused by mass loss and by the surface elements. For carbon brush anodes used in MFCs or other BESs, 450 – 500 °C preheating was the most suitable temperature range in terms of the power densities and CEs...|$|R

40|$|Conditions in {{microbial}} {{fuel cells}} (MFCs) {{differ from those}} in microbial electrolysis cells (MECs) due to the intrusion of oxygen through the cathode {{and the release of}} H 2 gas into solution. Based on 16 S rRNA gene clone libraries, <b>anode</b> communities in <b>reactors</b> fed acetic acid decreased in species richness and diversity, and increased in numbers of Geobacter sulfurreducens, when reactors were shifted from MFCs to MECs. With a complex source of organic matter (potato wastewater), the proportion of Geobacteraceae remained constant when MFCs were converted into MECs, but the percentage of clones belonging to G. sulfurreducens decreased and the percentage of G. metallireducens clones increased. A dairy manure wastewater-fed MFC produced little power, and had more diverse microbial communities, but did not generate current in an MEC. These results show changes in Geobacter species in response to the MEC environment and that higher species diversity is not correlated with current. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd...|$|R

40|$|Direct Internal Reforming (DIR) on Solid Oxide Fuel Cell (SOFC) anodes {{is often}} {{considered}} for fuel cells systems utilising carbon based fuels. Methane Steam Reforming (MSR) {{is one of}} the most extensively studied types of DIR. The hydrogen formed by the MSR reaction can be electrochemically oxidised in the fuel cell to produce electricity, while the exothermic electrochemical reaction supplies heat to the endothermic MSR reaction. The balance is delicate and unsuitable design choices will result in operational problems and poor fuel cell performance. These issues are known for over two decades now and remain unsolved despite several attempts to capture the rate limiting kinetics of the reforming process on fuel cell anodes and modelling studies of methane fuelled SOFCs. It is not yet clear whether MSR kinetics derived from substrate measurements can be used to model SOFC performance and the influence of electrochemistry on the MSR reaction kinetics is rarely reported. In this work a rate equation is selected based on experimental observations and kinetics proposed in literature, on both industrial catalysts and SOFC <b>anode</b> materials. Ideal <b>reactor</b> models are derived for two specific test setup geometries, considering the electrochemical reactions in the <b>anode.</b> The ideal <b>reactor</b> models are then used to fit the parameters of the selected rate equation to experimental data from earlier work. The selected rate equation is of the Langmuir-Hinshelwood-Hougen-Watson type. The rate determining kinetics are characterised by the slow reaction of surface adsorbed carbon hydroxide forming carbon monoxide and atomic hydrogen. In addition surface coverage of atomic oxygen on the catalyst is limiting the available number of reaction sites. Two constants and their respective energies, associated with the activation of the rate limiting kinetics and the surface adsorption of oxygen, are fitted to experimental data. To evaluate the selected rate equation Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) type models are developed for the two experimental setups, one with a Ni?GDC anode and the other utilising a Ni?YSZ anode. These model are used to solve fluid dynamics, heat transfer, species transport, and electrochemistry. To model methane steam reforming in the fuel cell anode the selected rate equation is implemented in the CFD models. The obtained models are used to simulate MSR on the fuel cell anode for the experimental conditions. The modelled methane conversions and I-V characteristics are compared to the experimental values. The spatial distributions in the anode predicted with the selected rate equation and a power law model, fitted to the same experimental data, are compared to evaluate the use of global reaction models. For the Ni?GDC anode setup the model predicts the experimental methane conversions with good accuracy: the R 2 value is with 0. 987 close to unity. The experimental and modelled I-V characteristics are in good agreement. The model adopting a power law reaction mechanism underestimates the gradients in the anode. However, the model shows poor agreement with the experimental results obtained on the Ni?YSZ test setup. Large deviations with the temperatures and concentrations assumed in the ideal reactor model are found which might explain the inaccuracy of the model. The good agreement on the Ni?GDC anode suggests that MSR kinetics in SOFCs can be modelled for both open and closed circuit conditions with an appropriate intrinsic rate equation. This was not confirmed for the Ni?YSZ anode. Therefore further investigation with a combined experimental and modelling ap- proach, preferably on similar setups, is required.

40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} the study of {{parameters}} of diaphragm discharge in liquids. NaCl solution of different conductivity {{was used as a}} conductive medium. Conductivities were adjusted in the range from 220 to 1000 µS cm- 1. Two diagnostic methods were used for the study of plasma parameters. The first one was employed in the laboratory of plasma chemistry at Faculty of Chemistry, Brno University of Technology, namely the optical emission spectroscopy. The second method used for plasma diagnostics was the time resolved ICCD camera at the Laboratoire de Physique des Plasmas at the École Polytechnique in Paris. The reactor for the diagnostics by optical emission spectroscopy had the volume of 4 l, and it was made of polycarbonate. PET diaphragm was placed in the barrier separating the cathode and the anode space. Electrodes were made of titanium coated with platinum. Electric power source supplied a constant DC voltage of maximum 5 kV and electric current up to 300 mA. Spectrometer Jobin Yvon TRIAX 550 with CCD detector was used during the experiments in order to measure overview spectra within the range from 200 to 900 nm as well as OH molecular spectra and Hß line spectra. All spectra were scanned in both discharge polarities, i. e. at the cathode and the <b>anode</b> part of <b>reactor.</b> The basic parameters of the discharge plasma were calculated from the spectra, that means rotational and electron temperature and electron density. Another part of experiment consisted of measurements by the ICCD camera iStar 734. Two types of reactors were used. The first one was the same as the reactor for the measurements by the optical emission spectroscopy. The second one was also made of polycarbonate, but the volume of conductive solution was 110 ml, only. HV electrodes made of stainless steel were placed in this reactor. Ceramic diaphragm (Shapal-MTM) was used in both reactors. Diaphragms had different thickness and diameter of holes. ICCD camera acquired photographs with details of processes of the bubbles generation and discharge operation (propagation of plasma channels), depending on solution conductivity, dimensions of the diaphragm, and with respect to the electrode part of the reactor...|$|R
