40|$|For {{integers}} k and l, each {{greater than}} 1, suppose that p {{is a prime}} with p ≡ 1 (mod k) and that the kth-power classes mod p induce <b>a</b> <b>coloring</b> of the integer segment [0, p − 1] that admits no monochromatic occurrence of l consecutive members of an arithmetic progression. Such <b>a</b> <b>coloring</b> can lead to <b>a</b> <b>coloring</b> of [0, (l − 1) p] that is similarly free of monochromatic l-progressions, and, hence, can give directly a lower bound for the van der Waerden number W (k, l). P. R. Herwig, M. J. H. Heule, P. M. van Lambalgen, and H. van Maaren have devised a technique for splitting and “zipping ” such <b>a</b> <b>coloring</b> of [0, p− 1] to yield <b>a</b> <b>coloring</b> of [0, 2 p− 1] which, for even values of k, is sometimes extendable to <b>a</b> <b>coloring</b> of [0, 2 (l − 1) p] where both new colorings still admit no monochromatic l-progressions. Here we derive a fast procedure for checking whether such <b>a</b> zipped <b>coloring</b> remains free of monochromatic l-progressions, effectively reducing a quadratic-time check to a linear-time check. Using this procedure we find some new lower bounds for van der Waerden numbers...|$|R

40|$|An L(2, 1) -coloring of a graph G is <b>a</b> <b>coloring</b> of G's {{vertices}} with integers in { 0, 1,..., k} so that adjacent vertices' colors di#er by {{at least}} two and colors of distance-two vertices di#er. We refer to an L(2, 1) -coloring as <b>a</b> <b>coloring.</b> The span #(G) of G is the smallest k for which G has <b>a</b> <b>coloring,</b> <b>a</b> span <b>coloring</b> is <b>a</b> <b>coloring</b> whose greatest color is #(G), and the hole index #(G) of G is the minimum number of colors in { 0, 1,..., #(G) } not used in <b>a</b> span <b>coloring.</b> We say that G is full-colorable if #(G) = 0. More generally, <b>a</b> <b>coloring</b> of G is <b>a</b> no-hole <b>coloring</b> if it uses all colors between 0 and its maximum color.

40|$|It {{is shown}} that, for any ɛ> 0, every graph of maximum degree ∆ permits <b>a</b> conflict-free <b>coloring</b> with at most log 2 +ɛ ∆ <b>colors,</b> that is, <b>a</b> <b>coloring</b> with the {{property}} that the neighborhood N(v) of any vertex v, contains <b>an</b> element whose <b>color</b> {{differs from the}} color of any other element of N(v). We give an efficient deterministic algorithm to find such <b>a</b> <b>coloring,</b> based on <b>an</b> algorithmic version of the Lovász Local Lemma suggested by Beck, Molloy and Reed. We need to correct a small error in the Molloy-Reed approach, restate it in a deterministic form, and re-prove it. The problem can be extended to arbitrary hypergraphs H: <b>a</b> <b>coloring</b> of the vertices of H is called conflict-free if each hyperedge E of H contains <b>a</b> vertex whose <b>color</b> does not get repeated in E. Every hypergraph with fewer than () s 2 edges permits <b>a</b> conflict-free <b>coloring</b> with fewer than s colors, and this bound cannot be improved. Moreover, there is a linear time deterministic algorithm for finding such <b>a</b> <b>coloring.</b> The concept of conflict-free colorings was first raised in a geometric setting in connection with frequency assignment problems for cellular networks...|$|R
