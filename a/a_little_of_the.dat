5|$|Little {{remains of}} the {{earliest}} churches on the site although <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> fabric has been dated to the 12th century. Much of the current building dates from the late 13th and 14th centuries when it was built and decorated by wealthy merchants of the city whose tomb and monuments decorate the church. The spire fell after being struck by lightning in 1446 and was not rebuilt until 1872. Little of the original stained glass remains following damage in the English Civil War with extensive new glass being added during the Victorian era. The tower contains 15 bells designed for full-circle English-Style change ringing. Other music in the church is provided by several choirs and the Harrison & Harrison organ.|$|E
5|$|Rigmor Mydtskov (1925–2010) was a Danish court {{photographer}} who is remembered both for her portraits of artists performing in Danish theatres {{but also for}} her many portraits of Queen Margrethe {{and other members of}} the Danish royal family. Realizing that people in such positions tend to act as if masked, she sought to portray the person behind the mask, although she often succeeded in maintaining <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> secrecy. As a portrait photographer, she was gentle, intuitive and confident. Her life's work is a result of a constant, concentrated effort.|$|E

25|$|Dr Oliver, I was told, … had a liking and a ′flair′ for the {{invention}} of simple appliances, with which observations and experiments could {{be made on the}} human subject. Dr Oliver had invented a small instrument with which he claimed to be able to measure, through the unbroken skin, the diameter of a living artery, such as the radial artery at the wrist. He appears to have used his family in his experiments, and a young son {{was the subject of a}} series, in which Dr Oliver measured the diameter of the radial artery, and observed the effect upon it of injecting extracts of various animal glands under the skin. … We may picture, then, Professor Schafer, in the old physiological laboratory at University College, … finishing an experiment of some kind, in which he was recording the arterial blood pressure of an anaesthetised dog. … To him enters Dr Oliver, with the story of the experiments on his boy, and, in particular, with the statement that injection under the skin of a glycerin extract from calf’s suprarenal gland was followed by a definite narrowing of the radial artery. Professor Schafer is said to have been entirely sceptical, and to have attributed the observation to self-delusion. … He can hardly be blamed, I think; knowing even what we now know about the action of this extract, which of us would be prepared to believe that injecting it under a boy’s skin would cause his radial artery to become measurably more slender? Dr Oliver, however, is persistent; he … suggests that, at least, it will do no harm to inject into the circulation, through a vein, <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> suprarenal extract, which he produces from his pocket. So Professor Schafer makes the injection, expecting a triumphant demonstration of nothing, and finds himself standing ′like some watcher of the skies, when a new planet swims into his ken,′ watching the mercury rise in the manometer with amazing rapidity and to an astounding height.|$|E

500|$|According to Hitchcock, {{a series}} of shots with Arbogast going up the stairs in the Bates house before he is stabbed were helmed by {{assistant}} director Hilton A.

However, upon viewing the dailies of the shots, Hitchcock was forced to scrap them. He claimed they were [...] "no good" [...] {{because they did not}} portray [...] "an innocent person but a sinister man who was going up those stairs". Hitchcock later re-shot the scene, though <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cut footage made its way into the film. Filming the murder of Arbogast proved problematic owing to the overhead camera angle necessary to hide the film's twist.
