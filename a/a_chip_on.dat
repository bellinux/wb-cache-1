500|$|The {{development}} team {{then set}} about recording the game's dialog, which {{proved to be}} challenging because of Vicious Cycle's location on the East Coast. [...] All of the recordings were done over the phone at a studio in Hollywood. [...] Despite this, {{and the fact that}} Fred alone had over 1000 lines of in-game dialog, the recording went smoothly, {{with the exception of one}} unidentified actor who walked out in the middle of a session. [...] The original script had only one instance of the word [...] "fuck", but several recording sessions with McGinley resulted in a great deal of colorful improvisation. [...] The design team liked the recordings and the script was modified to permit McGinley and other actors to curse more. [...] McGinley focused on portraying Fred as [...] "pissed off" [...] and [...] "having <b>a</b> <b>chip</b> <b>on</b> his shoulder" [...] because his head was missing.|$|E
500|$|Ian Hyland of News of the World {{disliked the}} episode, stating [...] "After this week's 'Cyberwoman' nonsense, 'Torch Script' {{would be a}} better idea." [...] Androzani.com said of the episode, [...] "It's awful. It's horrific. It seriously, seriously sucks," [...] adding [...] "the single nice thing we can find to say is that the concept had potential." [...] Seb Patrick of Noise to Signal thought, [...] "despite a strong - and {{somewhat}} morally ambiguous - ending [...] really should have delivered in more spectacular fashion than this." [...] Patrick also criticised Jack's personality throughout the episode, stating [...] "we wanted a spinoff series about him because he was cocky, cool and downright entertaining - Buzz Lightyear meets Ace Rimmer meets James Bond. We didn't want some grumpy immortal bastard with <b>a</b> <b>chip</b> <b>on</b> his shoulder." [...] Despite the mixed reviews however, the series producers and BBC controller of fiction Jane Tranter regard the episode as one of their favourites from the first series.|$|E
500|$|Meredith Blake, {{reviewer}} for the Los Angeles Times, {{said that}} the episode {{was a sort of}} masculine companion piece to the fourth season episode [...] "The Beautiful Girls", as [...] "Signal 30" [...] focuses on [...] "collective identity crisis of the agency's male population". Paste magazine writer Bonnie Stiernberg called Pete Campbell [...] "one of the most complex, underrated characters on TV today" [...] and called the dripping sink [...] "more like a fucking geyser in reality, and if he doesn’t do something to plug it up soon, he’s going to drown." [...] Jordan Bartel of the Chicago Tribune called the episode [...] "a classic" [...] and saw a possible Emmy nomination for Vincent Kartheiser, but felt the kitchen sink symbolism and ending voiceover was a little heavyhanded. Maureen Ryan of The Huffington Post praised Lane's character and Slattery's direction during the fight sequence, singling out Don, Bert, and Roger's reactions as [...] "absolute comedy gold". She also compared the Pete character to former U.S. President Richard Nixon because: [...] "there's a sense with Pete that there's always <b>a</b> <b>chip</b> <b>on</b> his shoulder and he'll eternally feel misunderstood and undervalued. He'll always inspire a mixture of pity and exasperation, because he's smart and insightful, but he can be a piece of work." ...|$|E

2500|$|In the {{successful}} London {{bid for the}} 2012 Olympic Games, Christie was absent from the team, {{even though he has}} stated that he attempted to get involved. Christie has cited an ongoing feud between himself and former teammate Sebastian Coe as a likely reason for the snub, although since 1999 British athletics chiefs had [...] "overlooked" [...] Christie because of his positive nandrolone test. Commenting on the argument, Christie's teammate, Derek Redmond, said he was [...] "a well-balanced athlete; he has <b>a</b> <b>chip</b> <b>on</b> both shoulders." ...|$|E

In June 2016, however, the network scrapped the pilot and set Wan to direct the new pilot episode with Till and Eads remaining in the cast. Justin Hires was cast as Wilt Bozer, MacGyver's roommate.

In September, Manson confirmed that the band were [...] "putting the finishing touches" [...] on the album, and said: [...] "It's not very much in any way like The Pale Emperor.

[...] On November 8 – the day of the 2016 US presidential election – Manson released a teaser clip of a new music video, which featured scenes of Manson brandishing a knife while standing over a decapitated corpse, which is dressed to resemble Donald Trump.

One of the convicts is a former Buffalo Soldier named Damien, who has <b>a</b> <b>chip</b> <b>on</b> his shoulder and would not admit to his former years in the service, even when Mrs. Barkley sees his tattoo.

Huckabee argued that Obama [...] "handled this {{about as well as}} anybody could" [...] and suggested that it was [...] "a very historic speech." [...] While he decried the remarks made by Wright, Huckabee, a former pastor himself, also noted that [...] "sermons...are rarely written word-for-word" [...] and that pastors often get [...] "caught up in the emotion of the moment." [...] Referencing his experience growing up in the segregated South and the legacy of Jim Crow, the former Arkansas governor noted that [...] "we've got to cut some slack to people who grew up being called names, being told, 'You have to sit in the balcony when you go to [...] movie'...Sometimes people do have <b>a</b> <b>chip</b> <b>on</b> their shoulder and resentment.

2500|$|On March 6 he was {{assigned}} as the Assistant Adjutant General and Assistant Inspector General of the Forces at Charleston, and on March 16 he was appointed a captain in the Regular Confederate States Artillery. Beginning on April 11 Lee was aide-de-camp to Brig. Gen. P.G.T. Beauregard. That same day he delivered an ultimatum from Beauregard to Union Maj. Robert Anderson, demanding the evacuation of Fort Sumter, which was refused and after bombardment the fort fell on April 14, precipitating {{the start of the}} Civil War. According to Carl Sandburg (Abraham Lincoln, vol. 3, pp.208–9), Captain Lee and 3 other men with full power from Beauregard to decide what to answer Anderson heard him say he would be starved out in a few days. Anderson offered to [...] "evacuate Fort Sumter in 3 days and avoid the useless effusion of blood." [...] They could have taken Anderson's reply back to Beauregard, have it telegraphed to Jefferson Davis to see if they would wait 3 days more to see if Anderson would surrender after his food was gone. [...] "It seemed almost as though the 4 men had decided before they came what they would say, which was: [...] "Beauregard will open fire on Fort Sumter in one hour from this time." [...] This probably was not, as it seems, the last opportunity to avoid war because [...] "Sumpter was a symbol, <b>a</b> <b>Chip</b> <b>on</b> the Shoulder." [...] It was [...] "framed" [...] by Lincoln and the South was eager to [...] meet the challenge. (ibid, p.206) Sandburg calls this war [...] "the Second American Revolution."
