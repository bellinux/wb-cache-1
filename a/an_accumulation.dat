40|$|Capsule’’: Compost {{amendment}} {{can reduce}} As exposure risk for humans by reducing <b>As</b> <b>accumulation</b> by vegetables {{and can be}} an important strategy for remediating CCA-contaminated soils. Leaching of arsenic (As) from chromated copper arsenate (CCA) -treated wood may elevate soil arsenic levels. Thus, an environmental concern arises regarding <b>accumulation</b> of <b>As</b> in vegetables grown in these soils. In this study, a greenhouse experiment was conducted to evaluate <b>As</b> <b>accumulation</b> by vegetables from the soils adjacent to the CCA-treated utility poles and fences and examine the effects of soil amendments on plant <b>As</b> <b>accumulation.</b> Carrot (Daucus carota L.) and lettuce (Lactuca sativa L.) were grown for ten weeks in the soil with or without compost and phosphate amendments. As expected, elevated As concentrations were observed in the pole soil (43 mg kg 1) and in the fence soil (27 mg kg 1), resulting in enhanced <b>As</b> <b>accumulation</b> of 44 mg kg 1 in carrot and 32 mg kg 1 in lettuce. Addition of phosphate to soils increased <b>As</b> <b>accumulation</b> by 4. 56 – 9. 3 times for carrot and 2. 45 – 10. 1 for lettuce due to increased soil water-soluble As via replacement of arsenate by phosphate in soil. However, biosolid compost application significantly reduced plant As uptake by 79 – 86 %, relative to the untreated soils. This suppression is possibly because of As adsorbed by biosolid organic mater, which reduced As phytoavailability. Fractionation analysis showed that biosolid decreased As in soil water-soluble, exchangeable, and carbonate fraction by 45 %, whereas phosphate increased it up to 2. 61 times, compared to the untreated soils. Our results indicate that growing vegetables in soils near CCA-treated wood may pose a risk of As exposure for humans. Compost amendment can reduce such a risk by reducing <b>As</b> <b>accumulation</b> by vegetables and {{can be an important}} strategy for remediating CCA-contaminated soils. Caution should be taken for phosphate application since it enhances <b>As</b> <b>accumulation...</b>|$|R

Long-term {{exposure}} to As affects nutritional status in rice grain and is associated with higher rates of skin, bladder, and lung cancers, and heart disease. Genotypic variations in rice for <b>As</b> <b>accumulation</b> or tolerance are prevalent and are regulated by genetic and environmental factors. To understand molecular networks involved in <b>As</b> <b>accumulation,</b> genome-wide expression analysis was performed in roots of low- and high-As accumulating rice genotypes (LARGs and HARGs). Six rice genotypes with contrasting <b>As</b> <b>accumulation</b> potential and tolerance were used in this study.

A comparison of gene expression profiles, principal component analysis, and -means clustering suggests that an independent pathway is operating during As stress tolerance or accumulation in contrasting genotypes. It was also observed that the differential behavior of genotype, Nayanmoni, from other LARGs might be due to its different genetic background. -motif profiling of As-induced coexpressed genes in diverse rice genotypes led to the identification of unique -motifs present in differentially expressed genes. This study suggests that the genetic mechanism regulating the differential <b>As</b> <b>accumulation</b> in different genotypes may not be dependent on gene expression at the transcriptional level.

To characterize apoE involvement in the intraneuronal <b>A?</b> <b>accumulation</b> and to investigate whether blocking the apoE/A? interaction could reduce intraneuronal A? buildup, we used a noncontact neuronal-astrocytic co-culture system, where synthetic A? peptides were added into the media without or with cotreatment with A? 12 - 28 P, which is a nontoxic peptide antagonist of apoE/A? binding. Compared with neurons cultured alone, intraneuronal A? content was significantly increased in neurons co-cultured with wild-type but not with apoE knockout (KO) astrocytes. Neurons co-cultured with astrocytes also showed impaired intraneuronal degradation of A?, increased level of intraneuronal A? oligomers, and marked down-regulation of several synaptic proteins.

40|$|Rice {{is a major}} dietary {{source of}} the toxic {{metalloid}} arsenic (<b>As).</b> Reducing its <b>accumulation</b> in rice (Oryza sativa) grain is of critical importance to food safety. Rice roots take up arsenate and arsenite depending on the prevailing soil conditions. The first step of arsenate detoxification is its reduction to arsenite, but the enzyme(s) catalyzing this reaction in rice remains unknown. Here, we identify OsHAC 1; 1 and OsHAC 1; 2 as arsenate reductases in rice. OsHAC 1; 1 and OsHAC 1; 2 are able to complement an Escherichia coli mutant lacking the endogenous arsenate reductase and to reduce arsenate to arsenite. OsHAC 1 : 1 and OsHAC 1; 2 are predominantly expressed in roots, with OsHAC 1; 1 being abundant in the epidermis, root hairs, and pericycle cells while OsHAC 1; 2 is abundant in the epidermis, outer layers of cortex, and endodermis cells. Expression of the two genes was induced by arsenate exposure. Knocking out OsHAC 1; 1 or OsHAC 1; 2 decreased the reduction of arsenate to arsenite in roots, reducing arsenite efflux to the external medium. Loss of arsenite efflux was also associated with increased <b>As</b> <b>accumulation</b> in shoots. Greater effects were observed in a double mutant of the two genes. In contrast, overexpression of either OsHAC 1; 1 or OsHAC 1; 2 increased arsenite efflux, reduced <b>As</b> <b>accumulation,</b> and enhanced arsenate tolerance. When grown under aerobic soil conditions, overexpression of either OsHAC 1; 1 or OsHAC 1; 2 also decreased <b>As</b> <b>accumulation</b> in rice grain, whereas grain As increased in the knockout mutants.

The extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1 and 2 (ERK 1 / 2) have emerged as key players in the DDR and are known to enhance ataxia telangiectasia-mutated protein (ATM) activity at DNA lesions, and in this study, we identified a novel relationship between prelamin <b>A</b> <b>accumulation</b> and ERK 1 / 2 nuclear compartmentalisation during VSMC ageing. We show both prelamin <b>A</b> <b>accumulation</b> and increased DNA damage occur concomitantly, before VSMC replicative senescence, and induce the localisation of ERK 1 / 2 to promyelocytic leukaemia protein nuclear bodies (PML NBs) at the sites of DNA damage via nesprin- 2 and lamin A interactions. Importantly, VSMCs treated with DNA damaging agents also displayed prelamin <b>A</b> <b>accumulation</b> and ERK compartmentalisation at PML NBs, suggesting that prelamin A and nesprin- 2 are novel components of the DDR. In support of this, disruption of ERK compartmentalisation at PML NBs, by either depletion of nesprin- 2 or lamins A/C, resulted in the loss of ATM from DNA lesions. However, ATM signalling and DNA repair remained intact after lamins A/C depletion, whereas nesprin- 2 disruptionablated downstream Chk 2 activation and induced genomic instability. We conclude that lamins A/C and PML act as scaffolds to organise DNA-repair foci and compartmentalise nesprin- 2 /ERK signalling. However, nesprin- 2 /ERK signalling fidelity, but not their compartmentalisation at PML NBs, is essential for efficient DDR in VSMCs...|$|R
40|$|Arsenic (As) {{appears in}} the {{environment}} as various As species, which may vary in plant uptake and toxicity. Moreover, As exposure may vary between habitat due to availability and speciation, {{both of which are}} influenced by redox potential. To decrease As uptake, addition of silicate may be a tool. The aim {{of the study was to}} investigate how the external factors As availability, plant habitats, silicon and oxygen level, influenced the accumulation and speciation of As in plants for food and phytoremediation in a temperate region. The external factors were chosen due to their previously showed influence on As in plants. The risks with dietary As was investigated by plant <b>As</b> <b>accumulation</b> and speciation in carrot, lettuce and spinach grown in alum shale and glassworks soils, and by the influence of silicon on <b>As</b> <b>accumulation</b> in lettuce in hydroponics. Suitable plants for As phytoremediation was investigated by analysing plants from various habitats, and by the O 2 influence on phytofiltration. The results showed that vegetables accumulated more As in soils with higher As extractability, and the As extractability in the rhizosphere was higher than in bulk soil. Also, the As concentration in lettuce was higher in hydroponics than in soil, but silicon reduced the <b>accumulation</b> of <b>As</b> in lettuce in hydroponics. Also, the more toxic inorganic As were the main As species detected in vegetables, compared with the less toxic organic As. For phytoremediation, the results showed <b>a</b> low <b>As</b> <b>accumulation</b> in emergent and terrestrial plants. Submerged plants had had a higher shoot As concentration. In general, the habitat had a major influence on the <b>As</b> <b>accumulation</b> in plants. The results also showed that the <b>As</b> <b>accumulation</b> properties in Elodea canadensis was reduced at higher O 2. In conclusion, consumption of vegetables cultivated in As polluted soils can result in an elevated intake of inorganic As, and E. canadensis is a promising candidate for As phytofiltration in a temperate region. At the time of the doctoral defence the following papers were unpublished and had a status as follows: Paper 2 : Manuscript; Paper 4 : Manuscript; Paper 5 : Manuscript. </p...|$|R
