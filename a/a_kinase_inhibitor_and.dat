Whereas these manoeuvres had marked effects on phorbol-ester-induced desensitization of muscarinic responses, they did not block agonist-induced down-regulation and desensitization of muscarinic receptors. In addition, when phosphoinositide hydrolysis was suppressed, the muscarinic agonist was still capable of mediating receptor sequestration and desensitization. These results suggest that the mechanisms for regulating muscarinic receptor sensitivity could be both PKC-dependent and PKC-independent, being mediated by phorbol esters and receptor agonists respectively...|$|E

Additionally, we studied activity of CDPK from MF in the absence and presence of staurosporine, <b>a</b> <b>kinase</b> <b>inhibitor</b> <b>and</b> okadaic acid, a phosphatase inhibitor. Stimulation of MF kinase activity by the addition of Ca 2 + supported the presence of CDPKs in MF. This was confirmed when a 70 kDa CDPK was detected in potato MF using western immunoblot analysis. HWC and suppressor stimulated kinase activity of MF within 5 - 10 min after application. In the presence of staurosporine, HWC stimulated MF kinase activity but suppressor did not. In the presence of okadaic acid, HWC inhibited and suppressor stimulated kinase activity of MF. These results suggest that HWC and suppressor may interact with potato kinase(s) in the MF, initiating a signal leading to the occurrence of HR, {{or in the case of}} suppressor, to the inhibition of HR.

An essential task in building such representations is to infer the affinities, rate constants, and other parameters {{of a model}} from actual measurement data. However, intuitive measurement protocols often fail to generate data that restrict the range of possible parameter values. Here we utilized a numerical method to iteratively design optimal live-cell fluorescence microscopy experiments in order to reveal pharmacological and kinetic parameters of a phosphatidylinositol 3, 4, 5 -trisphosphate (PIP 3) second messenger signaling process that is deregulated in many tumors.

We previously showed that hypoxia upregulates p 53 and enhances apoptosis in primary cultures of human cytotrophoblasts. Here we tested the hypothesis that hypoxia also induces apoptosis in syncytiotrophoblasts by upregulation of p 53. Primary cultures of human cytotrophoblasts that had differentiated into syncytiotrophoblasts by 52 h were exposed for ≤ 24 h to 20 % or < 1 % oxygen in {{the presence or absence of}} staurosporine or the p 53 modulators nutlin- 3, pifithrin-α, and pifithrin-μ. Proteins were detected by Western blot analysis or immunofluorescence. Compared with 20 % oxygen, exposure of syncytiotrophoblasts to < 1 % oxygen upregulated hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) - 1 α and rapidly downregulated p 53. Activity of p 53 in hypoxic syncytiotrophoblasts was reduced by the higher expression of the negative p 53 regulator MDMX and by the reduction of phosphorylation of p 53 at Ser 392, which reduces p 53 activity. Conversely, staurosporine, <b>a</b> <b>kinase</b> <b>inhibitor,</b> <b>and</b> nutlin- 3, a drug that enhances p 53 expression, both raised p 53 levels and increased the rate of apoptosis in syncytiotrophoblasts compared with vehicle controls. Immunofluorescence staining showed p 53 immunolocalized to both cytoplasm and nuclei of nutlin- 3 -exposed syncytiotrophoblasts. The hypoxia-induced apoptosis in syncytiotrophoblasts correlated with enhanced expression of the proapoptotic BAD and a reduced level of antiapoptotic BAD phosphorylated on Ser 112. We surmise that cell death induced by extreme hypoxia in syncytiotrophoblasts follows a non-p 53 -dependent pathway, unlike that of a nonhypoxic stimulus and unlike hypoxic cytotrophoblasts. We speculate that downregulation of p 53 activity in response to hypoxia reduces or eliminates the apoptosis transduced by the p 53 pathway in syncytiotrophoblasts, thereby limiting cell death and maintaining the integrity of this critical villous component...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this work was to {{determine}} whether the previously identified fatty acid activation of large conductance Ca 2 +-activated K+ (BK) channels from rabbit pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells was due to the direct interaction of the fatty acid with a site on the channel protein. If this was found to be the case, this study would also attempt to identify the site of fatty acid-protein interaction. Fatty acids released from membrane phospholipids by cellular phospholipases or available to the cell from the extracellular environment are important signaling molecules. Fatty acids can modulate the activity {{of a large number of}} molecules including protein kinases, phospholipases, adenylate and guanylate cyclases, G-proteins and ion channels. Fatty acids have also been shown to activate transcription of genes belonging to the steroid/thyroid superfamily of receptors. The actions of fatty acids on signal transduction pathways can be direct, whereby the fatty acid molecule itself is responsible for changes in the activity of enzymes, ion channels and other proteins. Alternatively, the effects of fatty acids may be indirect. In this case, biologically active lipids, produced from the metabolism of arachidonic acid are responsible for changes in cellular signaling. A previous study on the fatty acid modulation of rabbit pulmonary artery smooth muscle BK channel activity concluded that channel activation by fatty acids did not involve cycloxygenase, lip oxygenase and P 450 metabolites (122), eliminating this indirect action of fatty acids as a possible mechanism. When dealing with the effects of fatty acids on membrane bound ion channel proteins, other mechanisms of action are also possible. For example, fatty acids are capable of entering the cell membrane and can thus affect properties of the lipid bilayer, such as membrane fluidity or membrane surface charge, that may consequently alter the activity of ion channel proteins. In addition, fatty acid mediated alterations of ion channel activity could result from the effect of fatty acids on ion channel associated proteins. To determine the mechanism of action of fatty acids on the activity of BK channels from rabbit pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells, all of the above mentioned mechanisms were considered. Most of the experiments described here were carried out using the patch-clamp technique and current recordings were performed in cell free, excised inside-out or outside-out membrane patches, in the absence of any added nucleotides and calcium. As a first step towards understanding how fatty acids modulate BK channel activity, as well as the type of protein site with which fatty acids may be interacting, we determined the structural features of the fatty acid molecule that are required for channel modulation. To do this the effects of a range of fatty acids and other lipids on BK channel activity were examined. The features required for BK channel activation were found to be the negatively charged head group and a carbon chain of greater than eight carbons. We also found that positively charged lipids produced the opposite effect of negatively charged lipids, a decrease in BK channel activity. A similar chain length requirement was also necessary for channel inhibition by positively charged lipids; short chain compounds did not alter activity while those with fourteen carbons or greater decreased activity. The identification of these required structural features suggested that a specific interaction between the charge on the lipid head group is required for channel modulation by these lipids. The requirement for a chain length of greater than eight carbons also suggests that a hydrophobic interaction is necessary for these lipids to be effective modulators of this channel. In addition, the identification of these required structural features makes it unlikely that modulation of BK channel activity by these lipid compounds is a consequence of a perturbation of the lipid environment in which the channel resides. Experiments were then carried out to determine whether modulation of BK channel activity by fatty acids and other charged lipids involved any of the following indirect mechanisms of action: 1) alterations in the concentration of calcium in the vicinity of the channel due to changes in membrane surface charge, or due to calcium stores attached to excised membrane patches, 2) alterations in the membrane electric field that the channel perceives due to changes in membrane surface charge and 3) changes in the activity of membrane bound protein kinases or protein phosphatases. In experiments where high ionic strength solutions were used to shield membrane surface charge, fatty acids and other charged lipids were still able to modulate BK channel activity suggesting that fatty acids do not act through a mechanism involving surface charge. Experiments carried out in high concentrations of EGTA (20 mM) make it unlikely that calcium is involved in the modulation of BK channels by fatty acids and other lipids. The involvement of membrane bound kinases or phosphatases is also unlikely as fatty acids effectively modulated BK channel activity in the presence of staurosporin, <b>a</b> <b>kinase</b> <b>inhibitor,</b> <b>and</b> okadaic acid, a phosphatase inhibitor. The elimination of these indirect and non-specific suggests that fatty acids and charged lipids modulate BK channel activity by directly interacting with, either the channel protein itself, or some other channel associated protein. To obtain further evidence that this indeed is the mechanism by which these lipids modulate BK channel activity; experiments were carried out to identify the site of action (i. e. side of the membrane) of both negatively and positively charged lipids. The negatively charged palmitoyl coenzyme A (PCoA) and a myristoylated positively charged peptide (myr-KPRPK), two compounds that are incapable of flipping across the bilayer, were used to identify the site of action of negatively and positively charged lipids. PCoA and myr-KPRPK produced their predicted effects of BK channel activation and suppression, respectively, only when they were applied to outside-out membrane patches. These experiments, therefore, support the contention that fatty acids and other charged lipids modulate BK channel activity by interacting with a site on the channel protein or a channel associated protein and that this site is found on the external membrane surface. If the site responsible for channel modulation by fatty acids and other charged lipids is contained within the BK channel protein itself, other members of this family may also possess this site, and thus be modulated by fatty acids. Experiments were performed, therefore, to determine whether the BK cloned channels, mslo, hslo and bslo could also be modulated by fatty acids. These cloned channels were expressed in the Xenopus oocytes, and whole-cell currents were recorded using the two-electrode voltage clamp technique. The fatty acids myristic and arachidonic acid were able to increase whole-cell current of oocytes expressing all clone types. The modulation of these cloned channels by fatty acids did not appear to involve calcium, the BK β-subunit or a bioactive metabolite of arachidonic acid. Although all possible mechanisms of action were not addressed in this study, the results support the idea that the site of fatty acid interaction resides in the channel protein itself. Taken together, therefore, these studies suggest that it is very likely that fatty acids and charged lipids modulate the activity of BK channels from smooth muscle cells of the rabbit pulmonary artery by directly interacting with an externally located site on the channel protein itself. The BK clones, mslo, hslo and bslo, are also modulated by fatty acids and it is likely that they share the same mechanism of action seen for BK channels from rabbit pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells...|$|E

Provided it is tested further, the model may be used to support effective therapeutic strategies including the combined application of <b>a</b> tyrosine <b>kinase</b> <b>inhibitor</b> <b>and</b> miRNAs targeting BCR. ABL. It appears able to predict different effects of the two types of drug on cells with different expression levels and consequently different effects on the generation of resistance. © 2013 The Royal Society of Chemistry...|$|R
40|$|Conventional medical {{treatment}} for ulcerative colitis can have limited efficacy or severe adverse reactions requiring additional treatment or colectomy. Hence, different biological agents that target specific immunological pathways are be-ing investigated for treating ulcerative colitis. Anti-tumor ne-crosis factor (TNF) agents {{were the first}} biologics {{to be used for}} treating inflammatory bowel disease. For example, inflix-imab and adalimumab, which are anti-TNF agents, are be-ing used for treating ulcerative colitis. Recently, golimumab, another anti-TNF agent, and vedolizumab, an anti-adhesion therapy, have been approved for ulcerative colitis by the U. S. Food and Drug Administration. In addition, new medications such as tofacitinib, <b>a</b> Janus <b>kinase</b> <b>inhibitor,</b> <b>and</b> etrolizumab, another anti-adhesion therapy, are emerging as therapeu-tic agents. Therefore, {{there is a need for}} further studies to select appropriate patient groups for these biologics and to improve the outcomes of ulcerative colitis treatment through appropriate medical usage.

40|$|The torI gene {{has been}} {{identified}} by using a genetic multicopy approach as a negative regulator of the torCAD operon that encodes the trimethylamine N-oxide reductase respiratory system in Escherichia coli. The negative effect was due to a previously unidentified small ORF (66 aa) of phage origin that we called torI for Tor inhibition. Overexpression of torI led to an 8 -fold decrease of the torCAD operon transcription. This operon is positively regulated, {{in the presence of}} trimethylamine N-oxide, by a four-step phosphorelay involving the TorS sensor and the TorR response regulator. Epistatic experiments showed that TorI acts downstream of TorS and needs the presence of TorR. In vitro experiments showed that it is neither a TorR phosphatase nor <b>a</b> histidine <b>kinase</b> <b>inhibitor</b> <b>and</b> that it binds to the effector domain of TorR. Unexpectedly, TorI did not impede TorR DNA binding, and we propose that it may prevent RNA polymerase recruitment to the torC promoter. This study thus reveals a previously uncharacterized class of response regulator inhibitors...|$|R
40|$|SummaryHuman tissue {{transglutaminase}} (TGM 2) is a calcium-dependent crosslinking enzyme {{involved in}} the posttranslational modification of intra- and extracellular proteins and implicated in several neurodegenerative diseases. To find specific inhibitors to TGM 2, two structurally diverse chemical libraries (LOPAC and Prestwick) were screened. We found that ZM 39923, <b>a</b> Janus <b>kinase</b> <b>inhibitor,</b> <b>and</b> its metabolite ZM 449829 were the most potent inhibitors with IC 50 of 10 and 5 nM, respectively. In addition, two other inhibitors, including tyrphostin 47 and vitamin K 3, {{were found to have}} an IC 50 in the micromolar range. These agents used in part a thiol-dependent mechanism to inhibit TGM 2, consistent with the activation of TGM 2 by reduction of an intramolecular disulfide bond. These inhibitors were tested in a polyglutamine-expressing Drosophila model of neurodegeneration and found to improve survival. The TGM 2 inhibitors we discovered may serve as valuable lead compounds for the development of orally active TGM 2 inhibitors to treat human diseases...|$|R
40|$|The Aurora and Polo-like kinases {{are central}} {{components}} of mitotic signaling pathways, and recent {{evidence suggests that}} substantial cross-talk exists between Aurora A and Plk 1. In addition to their validation as novel anticancer agents, small molecule <b>kinase</b> <b>inhibitors</b> are increasingly important tools to help dissect clinically relevant protein phosphorylation networks. However, one major problem associated with <b>kinase</b> <b>inhibitors</b> is their promiscuity toward “off-target” members of the kinome, which makes interpretation of data obtained from complex cellular systems challenging. Additionally, the emergence of inhibitor resistance in patients {{makes it clear that}} an understanding of resistance mechanisms is essential to inform drug design. In this study, we exploited structural knowledge of the binding modes of VX- 680, <b>an</b> Aurora <b>kinase</b> <b>inhibitor,</b> <b>and</b> BI 2536, <b>a</b> Polo-like <b>kinase</b> <b>inhibitor,</b> to design <b>and</b> evaluate drug-resistant kinase mutants. Using inducible stable human cell lines, we authenticated mitotic targets for both compounds and demonstrated that Aurora A mutants exhibit differential cellular sensitivity toward the <b>inhibitors</b> VX- 680 <b>and</b> MLN 8054. In addition, we validated Aurora B as an important anti-proliferative target for VX- 680 in model human cancer cells. Finally, this chemical genetic approach allowed us to prove that Aurora A activation loop phosphorylation is controlled by a Plk 1 -mediated pathway in human cells...|$|R
40|$|Abstract We have {{recently}} shown that selenium compounds can induce a senescence response {{in a manner}} depending on ataxia-telangiectasia mutated (ATM), DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PK), p 53 and reactive oxygen species (ROS). To test {{the hypothesis that the}} selenium-induced senescence response involves epigenetic changes in senescence-associated heterochromatin foci (SAHF), we determined the expression of histone H 3 Lysine 9 trimethylation (H 3 K 9 me 3), a marker of SAHF, in human primary MRC- 5 cells treated with methylseleninic acid (MSeA, 2 &# 956;M) for 2 days, followed by a 7 -day recovery, in {{the presence or absence of}} KU 55933 (10 &# 956;M), <b>an</b> ATM <b>kinase</b> <b>inhibitor,</b> <b>and</b> NU 7026 (10 &# 956;M), <b>a</b> DNA-PK <b>kinase</b> <b>inhibitor.</b> Our results showed that MSeA treatment induced the formation of SAHF and H 3 K 9 me 3 foci. Pre-treatment of the cells with KU 55955 or NU 7026 resulted in numerous and smaller foci, and they did not co-localize with the MSeA-induced SAHF. These results suggest that the MSeA-induced senescence response involves epigenetic changes of H 3 K 9 me 3 in a manner depending on ATM and DNA-PK...|$|R
