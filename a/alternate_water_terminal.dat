40|$|AbstractThe {{purpose of}} {{developing}} <b>alternate</b> <b>water</b> sources is to secure water sources of sufficient quantity and high quality due to water quality and/or quantity problems {{of an existing}} water source and, thereby, {{raise the level of}} consumer satisfaction. Considering the enormous costs and the effects to the consumers and operation of water supply enterprises, a technique to support long term management of water supply systems is needed. In this paper a System Dynamics computer simulation model was developed to evaluate the effects of <b>alternate</b> <b>water</b> source development. The System Dynamics model was used for the simulation {{of the effects of the}} <b>alternate</b> <b>water</b> source development project in Busan, South Korea...|$|R

40|$|Aims Although water {{conservation}} in rice production {{has become increasingly}} important, the effects of water management on the allocation and dynamics of carbon (C) within the rice-soil system remain unknown. Methods We compared the allocation and dynamics of C assimilated by rice under continuously flooded, non-flooded and <b>alternate</b> <b>water</b> regimes. Rice (Oryza sative L. cv. Luliangyou 996) was labeled with 14 CO 2 and harvested 7 times within 45 days. Results More 14 C was released from roots into the soil in non-flooded and <b>alternate</b> <b>water</b> regimes treatments. Microbial 14 C decreased with time after the labeling and was lowest under flooded condition. Roots and rhizo-microbial respiration followed the order of non-flooded> <b>alternate</b> <b>water</b> regimes> flooded treatment. Water management affected 14 C distribution in aggregates with more 14 C in macroaggregates in the non-flooded treatment. Estimated amounts of C transferred remain-ing belowground by rice 45 days after labeling were 1, 986, 2, 827 and 2, 472 kg Cha− 1, of which rhizodepo-sition accounted for about 41 %, 16 % and 30 % of C transferred belowground under non-flooded, flooded and <b>alternate</b> <b>water</b> regimes, respectively. Conclusions Water management affected the alloca-tion and dynamics of recently assimilated C within the rice-soil system and also changed the relative contribution of rhizodeposition to C transferred be-lowground. This study suggests {{the differences in the}} driving mechanisms of C sequestration under flooded vs. non-flooded and <b>alternate</b> <b>water</b> regimes...|$|R
40|$|<b>Alternate</b> <b>water</b> {{sources are}} being {{implemented}} {{in urban areas}} to augment scheme water supplied by a water utility to homes. These sources include residential wells, rainwater tanks and greywater systems. Greater water efficiency can be achieved when these systems are designed to match a water source to a given demand based on both water quantity and quality parameters. In this way {{the use of an}} <b>alternate</b> <b>water</b> source can be maximised {{and the use of the}} high quality scheme water minimised. This paper examines the use of multiple <b>alternate</b> <b>water</b> sources sequentially to supply the same demand point potentially optimising the use of all available water sources. It also allows correct sizing of such water systems and their components to reduce scheme water demand. A decision support tool based on water balance modelling was developed that considers such water options at the household scale. Application of this tool to eight scenarios for both large and small house lots shows that using <b>alternate</b> <b>water</b> sources individually can result in significant scheme water savings. However by integrating these sources additional scheme water saving can be made...|$|R

40|$|Large {{amounts of}} oil {{left in the}} {{petroleum}} reservoir after primary and secondary enhanced oil recovery methods have brought about the implementation of several tertiary means of oil recovery. Increment of oil recovery can support the world’s oil supply. <b>Water</b> <b>alternating</b> gas injection {{has been a very}} popular method of gas injection to improving volumetric sweep efficiency. Although <b>water</b> <b>alternating</b> as injection has been shown to improve oil recovery, this process suffers inherent challenges such as water blocking, mobility control in high viscosity oil and gravity segregation. To combat these problems associated with <b>water</b> <b>alternating</b> gas flooding, the use of surfactant has been employed in <b>water</b> <b>alternating</b> gas injection. Due to the high operational cost arising from chemical cost in surfactant alternating gas injection, a new technique which involves the injection of low concentration surfactant before <b>water</b> <b>alternating</b> as flooding has been proposed. This work investigates experimental and numerical oil recovery potential of surfactant enhanced <b>water</b> <b>alternating</b> gas flooding. The distinctive feature of this technique is that instead of injecting surfactant slugs alternatively with gas, which will result to using a greater amount of surfactant, a low concentration surfactant is injected into the reservoir before <b>water</b> <b>alternating</b> gas flooding. The aim is to evaluate the performance of this technique as a low cost and effective means of chemically enhanced oil recovery by combining both mechanisms of surfactant reduction of water-oil interfacial tension and creation of foam with gas. This study begins with surfactant evaluation to characterise surfactants compatibility with reservoir brine and oil. Then followed by series core flooding experiments which include waterflooding, gas flooding, <b>water</b> <b>alternating</b> gas flooding and surfactant-enhanced <b>water</b> <b>alternating</b> gas flooding. Core flood data was history matched for <b>water</b> <b>alternating</b> as flooding and surfactant-enhanced <b>water</b> <b>alternating</b> as flooding via commercial simulator by inputting relative permeability curves, rock, fluid properties and interfacial tension. The results showed that experimentally, surfactant enhanced <b>water</b> <b>alternating</b> as flooding had the highest oil recovery when compared to conventional enhanced oil recovery methods. History matching of core flood experiment predicted similar increment in oil recovery during surfactant enhanced WAG. The effectiveness of this technique is based on the injection pattern after the initial surfactant injection and oil recovery potential {{is similar to that of}} surfactant alternating gas flooding...|$|R

5000|$|Each coil of {{the tube}} helps {{increase}} the available head pressure, effectively increasing how high the water can be pumped. Successive coils are wound such that their outer diameter is slightly less than the inner diameter of the previous coil as the tubing spirals in. The diameter of the coil is {{much larger than the}} diameter {{of the tube}}, so the diameter of each additional coil decreases only a small amount. Due to the <b>alternating</b> <b>water</b> and air that is taken into the tubing the pressure of the previous coil gets added to the pressure in each coil. If the coils are about the diameter of the wheel the apparatus will pump water to a height of approximately the coil diameter multiplied by the number of coils. As an example 3 coils that average 4 meters in diameter could pump water up to about 12 meters above the water surface. [...] At the outlet there will be <b>alternating</b> <b>water</b> then compressed air coming out of the water tubing.|$|R
