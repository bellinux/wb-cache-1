5|$|The long-tailed {{ground roller}} is a shy and elusive bird and, if {{seen by a}} human observer, it either freezes or runs away. As its short wings suggest, the species rarely flies, {{but it is a}} {{powerful}} runner. While largely terrestrial, it roosts in low trees and bushes, and sings from low perches. Long-tailed ground rollers are solitary outside the breeding season. Although diurnal, it does occasionally forage at night unlike most other ground rollers. When calling, this ground roller bobs its head <b>and</b> <b>raises</b> its tail. The long-tailed ground roller also raises its tail when it is excited.|$|E
5|$|A hunchback {{fisherman}} finds a {{young girl}} tied to a mast, the sole survivor of a shipwreck, <b>and</b> <b>raises</b> her into womanhood {{with the intention of}} making her his wife. Ten years pass and the woman, out of gratitude, promises to marry him. The hunchback hires a handsome stranger, the boy. The boy and the girl fall in love, but the girl refuses to marry him. The hunchback sees the two embrace and threatens the boy with a knife. The next day, the three go fishing in the boat and an argument breaks out. During the argument the boat tips over and the girl is washed away. The hunchback and the boy search for her, until the boy becomes exhausted and collapses on the shore. The hunchback finds the girl on a rock and brings her ashore. As the two reunite, he sees how happy they are together and takes his leave.|$|E

5|$|The phrase {{acid rain}} {{was first used}} by Scottish chemist Robert Augus Smith in 1852. The pH of rain varies, {{especially}} due to its origin. On America's East Coast, rain that {{is derived from the}} Atlantic Ocean typically has a pH of 5.0-5.6; rain that comes across the continental from the west has a pH of 3.8-4.8; and local thunderstorms can have a pH as low as 2.0. Rain becomes acidic primarily due to the presence of two strong acids, sulfuric acid (H2SO4) and nitric acid (HNO3). Sulfuric acid is derived from natural sources such as volcanoes, and wetlands (sulfate reducing bacteria); and anthropogenic sources such as the combustion of fossil fuels, and mining where H2S is present. Nitric acid is produced by natural sources such as lightning, soil bacteria, and natural fires; while also produced anthropogenically by the combustion of fossil fuels and from power plants. In the past 20 years the concentrations of nitric and sulfuric acid has decreased in presence of rainwater, which {{may be due to the}} significant increase in ammonium (most likely as ammonia from livestock production), which acts as a buffer in acid rain <b>and</b> <b>raises</b> the pH.|$|E
5|$|The {{principles}} of electrostatics are important when designing items of high-voltage equipment. There is a finite {{limit to the}} electric field strength that may be withstood by any medium. Beyond this point, electrical breakdown occurs and an electric arc causes flashover between the charged parts. Air, for example, tends to arc across small gaps at electric field strengths which exceed 30kV per centimetre. Over larger gaps, its breakdown strength is weaker, perhaps 1kV per centimetre. The most visible natural occurrence of this is lightning, caused when charge becomes separated in the clouds by rising columns of air, <b>and</b> <b>raises</b> the electric field {{in the air to}} greater than it can withstand. The voltage of a large lightning cloud may be as high as 100MV and have discharge energies as great as 250kWh.|$|E
5|$|The {{species is}} found in {{southeast}} Queensland, New South Wales, Victoria, South Australia and southwest Western Australia in open forest and woodland, and is a common visitor to urban gardens and parks. Loud and conspicuous, the red wattlebird is generally found in trees, where it gets most of its food; occasionally it forages on the ground. It {{is one of the}} largest nectarivorous birds in the world, feeding from a wide variety of flowering plants. Insects also comprise part of its diet. It is territorial and at times aggressive to birds of other species, often defending rich sources of nectar. Breeding throughout its range, the red wattlebird builds a cup-shaped nest in a tree <b>and</b> <b>raises</b> one to two broods a year. Although it has declined in places from land clearing, it is classified as Least Concern on the IUCN Red List.|$|E
50|$|Like {{other parts}} of the verb, participles can be either active (e.g. breaking) or passive (e.g. broken). Participles are also often {{associated}} with certain verbal aspects or tenses. The two types of participle in English are traditionally called the present participle (forms such as writing, singing <b>and</b> <b>raising)</b> <b>and</b> the past participle (forms such as written, sung <b>and</b> <b>raised).</b>|$|R

5|$|Enemy {{encounters}} {{trigger a}} combat mode. As in Chrono Trigger, enemies are openly visible on field maps or lie in wait to ambush {{the party and}} thus are not random. Similar to Final Fantasys Active Time Battle, each character has a meter that gradually fills with time. When the meter is full, characters can physically attack enemies, use MysTech magic, unleash BattleSkill attacks, use items, move to a different position, or use a nearby object to attack, if present. For playable characters and computer-controlled enemies, each attack has their number of hit points (a numerically based life bar) get reduced, which can be restored through healing items or MysTech slags. Use of MysTech and equippable shield cells require Neutron-Radiated Glodents (NRG), a separate energy reserve displayed beneath a character's life bar. NRG is replenished through certain items. Use of BattleSkills require Bouge, a third bar beneath NRG that automatically fills with time; players can use different BattleSkills depending on how full the Bouge bar is. Some characters must undergo certain plot developments to unlock their BattleSkills. When a playable character loses all hit points, he or she faints. If all the player's characters fall in battle, the game ends and must be restored from a previously saved game. Winning battles earns experience points <b>and</b> <b>raises</b> characters' levels, granting them improved statistics. These statistics can be viewed through the status screen, which displays important character information and current quests. Unlike many other RPGs, Anachronox displays a character's attributes with qualitative descriptors (such as Poor and Excellent) instead of integers.|$|E
5|$|Unlike {{wind and}} wave, tidal power is an {{inherently}} predictable source. However {{the technology is}} in its infancy and numerous devices are in the prototype stages. Today {{it is known that}} a tall tubular tower with three blades attached to it is the typical profile of a wind turbine, but twenty-five years ago there were a wide variety of different systems being tested. This is the current situation with regard to tidal power. Some systems capture energy from the tides in a vertical direction. The tide comes in <b>and</b> <b>raises</b> the water level in a basin. As the tide lowers the water in the basin is discharged through a turbine. Tidal stream power captures energy from the flow of tides, usually using underwater plant resembling a small wind turbine. An example is Marine Current Turbines SeaGen 1.2MW device at Strangford Lough in Northern Ireland, which is the largest tidal stream turbine in the world. To date the only two installed tidal power plants of notable size are the Sihwa Lake Tidal Power Station in Gyeonggi Province, South Korea and the Rance Tidal Power Station in Brittany, France, rated at 254 MW and 240 MW respectively. There are also many small scale projects throughout the world.|$|E
