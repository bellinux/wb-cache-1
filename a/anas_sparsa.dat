50|$|The African {{black duck}} (<b>Anas</b> <b>sparsa)</b> is {{a species of}} duck of the genus Anas. It is genetically closest to the mallard group, but shows some peculiarities in its {{behavior}} and (as far {{as they can be}} discerned) plumage; it is accordingly placed in the subgenus Melananas pending further research.|$|E

50|$|Verreaux's eagle-owl takes {{a diverse}} range of birds as prey. More than 50 avian prey species have been {{identified}} and they may locally exceed mammals in importance in the diet, somewhat unusually for eagle-owls. No one type of bird {{can be said to}} be predictably favored as prey and any avian species unfortunate enough to have a nighttime roost or nest that happens to be in an eagle-owl's foraging path may fall victim to this species. Many cases of predation involve nest robbery, with nestlings or fledglings being taken, although adult birds may be taken just as often, especially for species with less conspicuous nests. In South Africa's De Hoop Nature Reserve, it was found that birds were somewhat better represented by both number, 43.3% of remains, and biomass, 57.84% of remains, than mammals or any other prey group. The species best represented in biomass in the prior study was the black-headed heron (Ardea melanocephala) with several adults estimated to average 1260 g being found among the prey remains. Other fairly common, largish herons are also known to fall prey at night to Verreaux's eagle-owl including the 873 g great egret (Ardea alba), the 1443 g grey heron (Ardea cinerea) and the 975 g purple heron (Ardea purpurea). Other medium-sized water birds known to have been represented in this species diet include the 1008 g yellow-billed duck (Anas undulata), the 983 g African black duck (<b>Anas</b> <b>sparsa),</b> the 596 g African swamphen (Porphyrio madagascariensis) and the 825 g red-knobbed coot (Fulica cristata). Besides herons, another well-represented group of birds in the diet are galliforms. Perhaps the most widely prey species reported from this group is the 1229 g helmeted guineafowl (Numida meleagris), which may seasonally dominate the eagle-owl's food in Kenya. More modestly sized wild galliform species reported in the diet including the 96 g common quail (Coturnix coturnix) and the 390 g grey-winged francolin (Francolinus africanus). Domestic fowl, especially those allowed back to a semi-feral state and thus sleeping in the open as is prevalent in Africa, are taken when encountered, including chickens and peafowls.|$|E
