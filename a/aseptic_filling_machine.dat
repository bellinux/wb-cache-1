40|$|Xenos Ltd. is a {{technology}} driven food company, {{that specializes in}} aseptic processing and packaging beverage products in bottles. Their aseptic filling technology is based on packaging sterilization with combined treatments of oxidizing agents and Ultraviolet radiation. Recent research {{studies have suggested that}} there is a synergistic effect of hydrogen peroxide (0. 5 – 1 %) plus UV on inactivation of microorganisms including spores. Advantages of the combined treatment include rapid inactivation, minimum hydrogen peroxide residue in products, with the method being applicable {{to a wide range of}} packaging types. Based on this principle, a unique aseptic packaging technique has been developed by Xenos Ltd., which utilizes the combination of vaporized Perform (a commercial sterilizing agent manufactured by Orica Chemnet containing 25 % hydrogen peroxide and 5 % peracetic acid) and UV radiation at 7. 5 – 12. 5 W/m 2. The aim of the project was to improve and validate the effectiveness of the packaging sterilization process through challenge tests. Challenge tests were conducted using Bacillus subtilis spores as the test microorganism to determine the log reductions delivered by the packaging sterilization system. The tests were firstly carried out on a pilot plant scale <b>aseptic</b> <b>filling</b> <b>machine,</b> in order to test the sterility of the small scale system, and investigate processing parameters (operational conditions) which could affect and improve sterility. The established operational conditions for achieving target sterility were used for designing and modifying an upgrade aseptic packaging system. Finally validation of the upgrade packaging sterilization system was conducted through challenge tests to prove sterility. It is highly recommended that in order to ensure sterility, the packaging sterilization system with vaporized Perform plus UV treatment must meet the requirements listed below during the sterilization process: -	Hydrogen peroxide concentration of Perform condensate on bottles (after steaming) is best within 0. 5 – 1 %; -	Perform loading level should be minimum 300 mg/bottle after vaporized Perform treatment; -	UV treatment time applied is greater than 2 seconds during UV treatment; -	At least 20 seconds of penetration time (time between Perform treatment and UV treatment) should be allowed. The upgrade sterilization system used by Xenos Ltd. has been improved to meet the above operational conditions. With spore loading level of 106 per bottle and 105 per cap, the system is able to deliver at least a 6 log reduction of B. subtilis spores on PET or glass bottles and a 5 log reduction on bottle caps. Moruzzi et al. (2000) stated that at least a 4 log reduction is commercially required for an aseptic packaging process. Therefore, the system’s sterility would meet the commercial acceptable sterility...|$|E
40|$|One of the {{possible}} reasons for post-contamination of extended shelf life (ESL) milk could be attachment and formation of biofilms on stainless steel pipe surfaces. In South Africa, ESL milk processors are still facing challenges extending the shelf life beyond 14 days. It is hypothesized that post-contamination along the milk processing line is responsible of reducing the shelf life of ESL milk. This assumption was investigated by assessing the microorganisms associated with the nozzles of <b>aseptic</b> <b>filling</b> <b>machines</b> post CIP process and {{this study was designed}} and divided into two phases. Phase one involved isolation and characterisation of the bacteria associated with the nozzles of <b>aseptic</b> <b>filling</b> <b>machines</b> after CIP process with the aim of determining the diversity of microorganisms attached to the nozzles of <b>aseptic</b> <b>filling</b> <b>machines.</b> Swab samples were collected from a plant processing ESL milk. Twenty swabs were taken from ten different nozzles of <b>aseptic</b> <b>filling</b> <b>machines</b> during 4 visits (n= 80). The swab samples were plated on the day of sampling. A total bacterial count ranging from 1. 75 - 1. 95 log CFU/cm 3 with an average of 1. 81 log CFU/cm 3 (n= 80). MALDI-TOF revealed a high percentage of Gram-positive rods (69 %), followed by Gram-positive cocci (20 %) and then Gram-negative rods (7 %). The Gram-positive rods belonging to genus Bacillus were identified as Bacillus cereus, followed by B. pumilus, B. subtilis and Paenibacillus spp. The Gram-positive cocci included S. hominis, S. epidermidis, Micrococcus luteus and Anaerococcus spp. The Gram-negative rods were identified as Acinetobacter junii. The prevalence of Bacillus spp. noted in the nozzles of ESL <b>aseptic</b> <b>filling</b> <b>machines</b> is attributed to their ability to resist heat treatment during CIP process and their ability to attach to stainless steel surfaces. There was a degree of similarity in terms of MALDI-TOF MS profiles for the strains of B. cereus, Staphylococcus spp. and Paenibacillus spp. originating from the nozzles of <b>aseptic</b> <b>filling</b> <b>machines</b> and the packaged ESL milk product. Furthermore, these isolates show close relatedness. These bacteria are likely to originate from the nozzles, dispensed into the final ESL milk during filling process. Phase two aimed at determining cell surface hydrophobicity of the isolates originating from the nozzles of <b>aseptic</b> <b>filling</b> <b>machines.</b> Co-currently the study further determined the ability of B. cereus, S. epidermidis, M. luteus and Paenibacillus spp. to attach and form biofilms on stainless surfaces. The bacterial strains were isolated from the nozzles of <b>aseptic</b> <b>filling</b> <b>machines.</b> The degree of hydrophobicity of the spore formers ranged from 8 - 91 % while non-spore formers ranged from 6 - 67 %. Hydrophobicity of S. hominis, S. epidermidis, Acinetobacter junii and Arthrobacter castelli differed significantly (p? 0. 05). Hydrophobicity of B. pumilus, Paenibacillus spp. and B. cereus (p? 0. 05) differed significantly. Spore formers showed the highest hydrophobicity to solvents, this can be contributed to their hydrophobic nature and their ability to attach to stainless surfaces. A continuous flow reactor system was used to grow biofilm of the isolates in skim milk. The skim milk was inoculated with spore suspension of B. cereus, Paenibacillus spp. and bacterial suspension of M. luteus and S. epidermidis. The bacterial suspensions were run separately over a period of 20 h at 37 °C. Stainless steel strips were submitted to Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) after 22 h. The results suggested that spores of B. cereus and Paenibacillus spp. can only attach whilst M. luteus and S. epidermidis can attach and form biofilms on stainless steel. The ability of these isolates to form biofilms on stainless steel strips could be the main cause of contamination of ESL milk. Strains of Bacillus spp. can form biofilm on stainless steel and limit the shelf life of milk and milk products. However, toxins produced by some of these strains of B. cereus might be contagious to humans. The results confirmed {{that one of the reasons}} of contamination of ESL milk could be the ability of B. cereus to attach to stainless surfaces and M. luteus to form biofilms. Over and above the fact that the spores of B. cereus can lead to spoilage of milk and milk products, a concern is that the toxins produced by some of the strains of B. cereus are detrimental to human health.

40|$|Sterilisation {{processes}} are compulsory in medicine, pharmacy, and food industries to prevent infections of consumers and microbiological contaminations of products. Monitoring the sterilisation by conventional microbiological methods is time- and lab-consuming. To overcome this problem, {{in this work}} a novel biosensor has been proposed. The sensor enables a fast method to evaluate sterilisation processes. By means of thin-film technology the sensor's transducer structures in form of IDEs (interdigitated electrodes) have been fabricated on a silicon substrate. Physical characterisation of the developed sensor was done by AFM, SEM, and profilometry. Impedance analyses were conducted for the electrical characterisation. As microbiological layer spores of B. atrophaeus have been immobilised on the sensing structure; spores of this type are a well-known sterilisation test organism. Impedance measurements at a fixed frequency over time were performed to monitor the immobilisation process. A sterilisation process according to <b>aseptic</b> <b>filling</b> <b>machines</b> was applied to demonstrate the sensor functionality.

In this paper an extended multi-scale model of edge wicking in multi-ply paperboard is presented.

The absolute air permeabilities and pore size distributions are validated with experimental and tomographic values. On the macro-scale random porosity and sizing distributions, time and sizing dependent contact angles, and inter-ply dependence are modeled. Arbitrary shapes of the paperboard are handled through an unstructured 3 D surface mesh. Stationary and transient edge wicking simulations are validated against experiments with excellent agreement. The simulations show that the diffusive menisci between the liquid and air phases together with the two-ply model is necessary to achieve good agreement with the transient edge wicking experiments...|$|R

The results as functions of saturation and porosity are stored in a database. The database is used as input for two-phase flow simulations on the paper macro-scale. The resulting fluid penetration is validated against pressurized edge wick measurements on paper lab sheets with very good agreement.

During this process, the germicidal effectivity of the antimicrobial treatment depends {{especially on the}} H 2 O 2 concentration of the gas mixture. For the detection of H 2 O 2 in <b>aseptic</b> <b>filling</b> processes, a novel thin-film calorimetric gas sensor based on a differential set-up of a catalytically activated and a passivated temperature sensing element has been realised in the present work. The sensor device contains two meander-shaped platinum resistances as temperature sensing elements: both have been passivated with spin-coated perfluoralkoxy. As catalytically active materials for the calorimetric gas sensor, palladium, platinum black and manganese oxide particles have been studied in the developed experimental set-up, wherein MnO 2 has shown the highest sensitivity of 0. 57 degrees C/% (v/v) towards H 2 O 2. Afterwards, the characteristic of the sensor device with MnO 2 particles as catalyst has been examined at various H 2 O 2 concentrations and additionally, the influence of gas temperature and gas flow rate on the sensor signal has been validated in the experimental set-up.

Samples of raw and pasteurised milk from different sampling sites along the line were collected. After incubation at 7 °C until the total aerobic plate count reached 106 to 107 cfu/ml, {{or the number of}} GPS exceeded 104 cfu/ml isolates were picked randomly and identified. All GNP present in the raw milk were properly killed during pasteurisation. A recontamination by GNP was observed in 40 % of the consumer packages. This recontamination was focused to the filling procedure, and Pseudomonas was the dominating GNP in all packages. Environmental samples, as water from different water sources in the dairy plant, air collected by a RCS-sampler on water-agar strips, and empty, formed and sealed packages taken from the <b>filling</b> <b>machines,</b> were inoculated with sterile milk. GNP isolates were randomly picked and identified after incubation at 7 °C. Samples of water and air collected in the immediate surroundings of the <b>filling</b> <b>machine</b> contained large numbers of GNP causing growth in refrigerated milk. GNP isolates from the milk samples and from the environmental samples were genomically typed by the PCR-based method Randomly Amplified Polymorphic DNA (RAPD).
