40|$|Activity {{recognition}} {{is an important}} technology in pervasive computing {{because it can be}} applied to many real-life, human-centric problems such as eldercare and healthcare. Successful research has so far focused on recognizing simple human activities. Recognizing complex activities remains a challenging and active area of research. Specifically, the nature of human activities poses the following challenges: Recognizing concurrent activities People can do several activities at the same time [3]. For example, people can watch television while talking to their friends. These behaviors should be recognized using a different approach from that for sequential activity. Recognizing interleaved activities Certain real life activities may be interleaved [3]. For instance, while cooking, if there is a call from a friend, people pause cooking for a while and after talking to their friend, they come back to the kitchen <b>and</b> <b>continue</b> <b>to</b> <b>cook.</b> Ambiguity of interpretation Depending on the situation, the interpretation of similar activities may be different. For example, an activity “open refrigerator ” can belong to several activities, such as “cooking ” or “cleaning”. Multiple residents In many environments more than one resident is present. The activities that are being performed by the residents in parallel need to be recognized, even if the activity is performed together by the residents in a group. Human activity understanding encompasses activity recognition and activity pattern discovery. The first focuses on accurate detection of the human activities based on a predefined activity model. Therefore, an activity recognition researcher builds a highlevel conceptual model first, and then implements the model by building a suitable pervasive system. On the other hand, activity pattern discovery is more about finding some unknown patterns directly from low-level sensor data without any predefined models or assumptions. Hence, the researcher of activity pattern discovery builds a pervasive system first and then analyzes the sensor data to discover activity patterns. Even though the two techniques are different, they both aim at improving human activity technology. Additionally, they are complementary to each other- the discovered activity pattern can be used to define the activities that will be recognized and tracked...|$|E
50|$|Carryover cooking (sometimes {{referred}} to as resting) is the phenomenon that food retains heat <b>and</b> <b>continues</b> <b>to</b> <b>cook</b> even after being removed from the source of heat. Carryover cooking is often used as a finishing step in preparation of foods that are roasted or grilled, and must be accounted for in recipes as it can increase the internal temperature of foods by temperatures between 5 and 25 degrees Fahrenheit (3-14&deg;C). The larger and denser the object being heated, the greater the amount of temperature increase due to carryover cooking.|$|R

40|$|The {{price and}} {{availability}} of different fuel sources shaped the material lives of English people during the Industrial Revolution. Fuel prices affected the location of industries, population growth and whether poorer people could afford <b>to</b> <b>cook</b> their own food. Fuel supplies were highly regionalized in this period and few people had access to wood, peat and coal at comparable prices. Depending on the community, people consumed wood, peat, local coal or non-local coal, the prices of which always differed. National averages or price-wage series do not reflect these diverse experiences. This dissertation offers {{a new perspective on}} living standards of the labouring poor by examining the role of regional environments and emphasizing their impact. It does so with a comparative analysis of Hampshire and the West Riding of Yorkshire, two of the most geographically diverse English counties. Evidence is derived from fuel purchases of Overseers of the Poor and sales records of collieries, along with contemporary observations, the 1831 Census, court records of fuel theft prosecutions and the heights of prisoners in the West Riding House of Correction. These sources indicate that wood prices tripled in inland northern Hampshire between 1750 and 1830 and made cooking prohibitively expensive for most households. Purchased wheat bread increasingly became the staple food in that region. Meanwhile, coal was very cheap where it was mined and fuelled industrial expansion on the Yorkshire coalfield. Population growth was higher in this manufacturing region <b>and</b> residents <b>continued</b> <b>to</b> <b>cook</b> their own food but came to suffer from the smoke arising from such fires. The regional perspective of this dissertation indicates that living standards declined for most labouring poor English people during the Industrial Revolution, but for regionally different reasons...|$|R
