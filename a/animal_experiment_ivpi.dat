40|$|The main {{argument}} for justifying {{the use of}} animals in research for human purposes is because <b>animal</b> <b>experiments</b> benefit humans. This thesis is a literature study about the justification {{of the use of}} <b>animals</b> in research <b>experiments</b> with the focus on the benefits of the experiments. These benefits need to be considered before the <b>animal</b> <b>experiments</b> are performed; ethical committees need to approve the use of <b>animals</b> in the <b>experiments.</b> These committees will compare the discomfort of the <b>animals</b> in the <b>experiments</b> with the potential benefits of the experiments. When these potential benefits are overruling the costs of the experiments, i. e. the discomfort of the animals, the use of animals is justified and the experiments will be approved. To determine on forehand whether the benefits are substantial higher than the costs, the ethical committees have to analyse the scientific validity of the experiment by setting and following specific criteria. However, even when the experiment is found scientifically valid, it is uncertain whether the results will be the expected results. With an evaluation of the results, the immediate and the long term results of the <b>animal</b> <b>experiments</b> can be determined, in other words, the contribution of <b>animal</b> <b>experiments</b> to medical science. Systematic reviews may provide an overview of the published <b>animal</b> <b>experiments</b> and help to determine the contribution of <b>animal</b> <b>experiments</b> to medical science. However, unexpected or negative results are often not published. To determine the relative relevance of <b>animal</b> <b>experiments</b> for humans, the unexpected and unpublished results of <b>animal</b> <b>experiments</b> should also be taken into account. A proper comparison of the results of <b>animal</b> <b>experiments</b> and the corresponding clinical trials help to determine the contribution of animals in research to medical science as well. However, there are plenty of examples that show that systematic reviews of <b>animal</b> <b>experiments</b> are not conducted properly or that the systematic reviews are not evaluated before the clinical trials start. For those examples, it is unsure whether the use of animals was necessary or that animal lives were spilled. The real contribution of the benefits of <b>animal</b> <b>experiments</b> to medical science is therefore hard to determine. 	In conclusion, the benefits of <b>animal</b> <b>experiments</b> are important in justifying the use of animals in research for human purposes. Without the potential benefits, no <b>animal</b> <b>experiment</b> will be approved and no research will be performed. However, the benefits are hard to determine on forehand and can be hard to evaluate afterwards. Therefore, the contribution of the use of animals is difficult to determine. Using animals in research for human purposes is and probable always will be an unsolved dilemma, mostly because the benefits on one hand have contributed a lot to medical science {{but on the other hand}} can never be controlled and absolutely assured in future experiments...|$|R

40|$|This is {{an opinion}} survey about {{laboratory}} animals by the University of Utrecht, department of Animals, Science and Society. The survey describes the Dutch view relating {{the use of}} laboratory animals. A sample of 274 individuals, which samples the Dutch population was asked to fill in a written survey in the months September till November 2008. The survey method is called The Dillman method (3). 	The findings indicate that most people spontaneosly think of medical research or science research when <b>animal</b> <b>experiments</b> are mentioned. A smal minority still associates <b>animal</b> <b>experiments</b> with cosmetics. Strikingly women tend to think more negative when they think of <b>animal</b> <b>experiments</b> than men do. 	The public view in the Netherlands is very varied. The percentages in favour and against are close together. A possible reason for this can be subscribed {{to the lack of}} information and thus knowledge by the people. People with a low socio-economic status tend to be more against <b>animal</b> <b>experiments</b> than people with an higher socio-economic status. 	As we look at some ‘lifestyle’ factors that people have, we see that it makes a difference in opinion and knowledge in comparison with people who do not have that factor. People who tend to ‘relate’ more to animals are more against <b>animal</b> <b>experiments.</b> This category consists of vegetarians, people who buy cosmetics that aren’t tested on animals, people who would buy medicines that are not tested on animal if it was possible, people who are joined in an animal organisation, people who call themselves ‘animal lovers’ and people who have pets. The same group of people seems to have more knowledge about <b>animal</b> <b>experiments</b> than people without these ‘lifestyle’ factors. They tend to hear or read more about laboratory animals, know more organisations that revolve around <b>animal</b> <b>experiments</b> and know more often that every <b>animal</b> <b>experiment</b> has to be approved first by an animal experimental commission...|$|R

Recently, the criticism to <b>animal</b> <b>experiments</b> has Increased from a viewpoint of the animal welfare and protection. Especially, reduction in the <b>animal</b> <b>experiments</b> must be achieved worldwide in the cosmetics field. The marketing of cosmetics that developed by the <b>animal</b> <b>experiment</b> are prohibited by the 7 th amendment of EU Cosmetic Directive In the EU from March, 2009. Therefore, the alternatlve methods to <b>animal</b> <b>experiments</b> using cultured tissues have been paid attention to evaluate cosmetics and cosmetic ingredients. Currently the in vitro skin irritation tests using a three-dimensional cultured human skin model have been validated by ECVAM as an alternatlve to <b>animal</b> <b>experiment.</b> It is also useful to estimate skin irritation using a simple cultured cell from rnechanism of skin irritation. Moreover, developing the in vitro method will be connected to improved prediction of in vivo study, to reduction of animal research, and finally to proper use of pharmaceutical products. 特集 化粧品分野における動物実験代替法の現状と課...|$|R
