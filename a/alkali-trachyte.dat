40|$|The Averno 2 {{eruption}} (3, 700 ± 50 a B. P.) was {{an explosive}} low-magnitude event characterized by magmatic and phreatomagmatic explosions, generating mainly fall and surge beds, respectively. It {{occurred in the}} Western sector of the Campi Flegrei caldera (Campanian Region, South Italy) {{at the intersection of}} two active fault systems, oriented NE and NW. The morphologically complex crater area, largely filled by the Averno lake, resulted from vent activation and migration along the NE-trending fault system. The eruption generated a complex sequence of pyroclastic deposits, including pumice fall deposits in the lower portion, and prevailing surge beds in the intermediate-upper portion. The pyroclastic sequence has been studied through stratigraphical, morphostructural and petrological investigations, and sub- divided into three members named A through C. Member A was emplaced during {{the first phase of the}} eruption mainly by magmatic explosions which generated columns reaching a maximum height of 10 km. During this phase the eruption reached its climax with a mass discharge rate of 3. 2 106 kg/s. Intense fracturing and fault activation favored entry of a significant amount of water into the system, which produced explosions driven by variably efficient water-magma inter- action. These explosions generated wet to dry surge deposits that emplaced Member B and C, respectively. Isopachs and isopleths maps, as well as areal distribution of ballistic fragments and facies variation of surge deposits allow definition of four vents that opened along a NE oriented, 2 km long fissure. The total volume of magma extruded during the eruption has been estimated at about 0. 07 km 3 (DRE). The erupted products range in composition from initial, weakly peralkaline <b>alkali-trachyte,</b> to last-emplaced <b>alkali-trachyte.</b> Isotopic data and modeling suggest that mixing occurred during the Averno 2 eruption between a more evolved, less radiogenic stored magma, and a les...|$|E
40|$|The Neapolitan Yellow Tuff, {{the product}} of the largest known {{trachytic}} phreatoplinian eruption, gives a good opportunity to investigate the filling mechanisms and internal dynamics of a trachytic magma chamber. A detailed study of the geochemical, mineralogical and isotopical features of the deposit was carried out to investigate the behaviour of the magma chamber before the eruption. The collected data show three distinct compositional groups separated by gaps. Single depositional units contain glass shards formed contemporaneously. Although each of these shards is homogeneous they display the same compositional variations and gaps detected in pumice clasts. This feature is taken as an evidence for interpreting the detected compositional gaps as real gaps in the chamber. Therefore the chamber was filled by three distinct magma bodies separated by compositional gaps. The uppermost magma was <b>alkali-trachyte</b> and highly homogeneous, likely a consequence of vigorous convection. The intermediate magma was trachyte with a slight and continuous compositional variation, likely resulting from less intense convection. The lowermost magma was compositionally zoned from <b>alkali-trachyte</b> to latite downward. This compositional zonation was most likely acquired during uprise from a deeper reservoir. The three magmas entered the chamber sequentially from the uppermost to the lowermost. The latter entered the chamber short before the beginning of the eruption. Its input was interpreted as a possible triggering factor for the eruption. The results of this study strongly support a step-filling mechanism for the Neapolitan Yellow Tuff magma chamber and allow definition of the temporal succession of input of magma batches. Furthermore they also suggest that the magma bodies did not mix although, at least the uppermost two, coexisted inside the chamber for a time long enough to allow internal homogeneization by convection...|$|E
40|$|The {{state of}} water in {{volcanic}} glasses separated from pumices and shards of <b>alkali-trachyte</b> composition from the Agnano-Monte Spina eruption (4. 1 ka) in the Phlegrean Volcanic District (South Italy) has been investigated by 1 H Magic Angle Spinning Nuclear Magnetic Resonance spectroscopy. The surface analysis of pumice glasses indicates that they correspond to a highly vesiculated, disordered foam characterized by several generations of vesicles both of sub-spherical and strained shape, suggesting a sudden increase of the melt structural relaxation time while bubbles were still deforming. Shards, characterized by low vesicularity, are typically composed of angular or sub-rounded clasts of glass, the latter showing, in some cases, evidence of surface pitting. The 1 H resonance patterns of shards can be fitted in terms of isolated H 2 O molecules and OH groups. The shards with the highest water content and rounded shape, {{supposed to be the}} product of phreatomagmatic explosions, are characterized by the higher H 2 O/OH molar ratio (2. 6), attributed to the interaction of the melt with external water. In the angular shard, previously interpreted as due to magmatic fragmentation, the molar H 2 O/OH ratio is significantly lower (0. 7) ...|$|E
40|$|The {{physical}} properties of clay allow argillaceous formations {{to be considered}} geological barriers to radionuclide migration in high-level radioactive-waste isolation systems. As laboratory simulations are short term and numerical models always involve assumptions and simplifications of the natural system, natural analogues are extremely attractive surrogates {{for the study of}} long-term isolation. The clays of the Orciatico area (Tuscany, Central Italy), which were thermally altered via the intrusion of an <b>alkali-trachyte</b> laccolith, represent an interesting natural model of a heat source which acted on argillaceous materials. The study of this natural analogue was performed through detailed geoelectrical and soil–gas surveys to define both the geometry of the intrusive body and the gas permeability of a clay unit characterized by different degrees of thermal alteration. The results of this study show that gas permeability is increased in the clay sequences subjected to greater heat input from the emplacement of the Orciatico intrusion, despite the lack of apparent mineral and geotechnical variations. These results, which take into consideration long time periods in a natural, large-scale geological system, may have important implications for the long-term safety of underground storage of nuclear waste in clay formations...|$|E
40|$|The Averno 2 {{eruption}} (AV 2) occurred 3. 7 ka b. p in {{the northwest}} sector of the Campi Flegrei caldera (CFc), {{at the intersection of}} NE-SW and NW-SE fault systems bordering the resurgent block. The eruption, one of the youngest of the caldera, was followed only by the 1538 AD eruption of Monte Nuovo. The eruption of AV 2 was fed by alkaline magma tapped from a chemically zoned (weakly peralkaline <b>alkali-trachyte</b> to <b>alkali-trachyte)</b> chamber [Civetta et al., 1988, Rosi and Sbrana 1987]. Eruptive products of AV 2 eruption were subdivided into three members (A to C) by Di Vito et al., [2001]. 21 representative samples of AV 2 deposits were analyzed for grain-size and componentry whereas 16 depositional units (about 100 juvenile clasts each) were sampled to measure bulk density, bulk vesicularity and assess texture characteristics of individual clasts. According to bulk density, vesicularity and textural data three main pyroclasts types were identified: i) low-density, light coloured, microvesicular, microlite-free; ii) high-density, dark-brown, microlite-rich; iii) banded made up of mm-thick stripes of (i) and (ii) types. The three types record variations of magma properties resulting from various degassing histories and syn-eruptive crystallization of groundmass. Characteristics and relative abundance of juvenile clast types throughout the stratigraphic sequence were used to make inferences and place constrains on temporal variations in magma rise and eruptive mechanisms. Occurrence in the very early fallout bed of dense juvenile clasts suggests the initial disruption of a limited volume of degassed magma. Member A was dominated by type (i) clasts suggesting that plinian episodes were fed by the fast supply of volatile-rich highly evolved magma from below whereas subsequent eruptions were fed by volatile poor-magma less evolved (member C). Members B and C contain (i), (ii) and (iii) types; an increasing abundance through time of clasts (ii) and (iii) suggests increasing importance of intra-eruption degassing, mostly occurring during time breaks between two successive eruptive pulses. Additionally, these degassing pulses were likely responsible for the emplacement of the fine-ash fall out beds. The pulsating activity of AV 2 appears to be transitional in style between subplinian and vulcanian. We propose that transitions in eruptive style from plinian to surge activity were controlled by magmatic processes and not by water-magma interaction. This study also allows us to characterize the magma chamber of AV 2. Petrography and chemical analysis (SEM-EDS and electron microprobe) were performed on pumice samples, melt inclusions, and host minerals. The least evolved melt inclusions are found in zoned diopside clinopyroxene phenocrysts from the pumice fall of member C (Cmb layer), whereas the most evolved melt inclusions are found in hedenbergite clinopyroxene phenocrysts from the pumices fall of member A (A 0 layer), the first-erupted pumices. The observed compositional trend indicates that the erupted deposits were drained by a single magmatic reservoir. The compositional evolution of the AV 2 magmatic system seems to have resulted from different processes occurring at different stages, pre-eruptive magma mixing, due to an input of a small batche of mafic magma into the reservoir, and then crystal fractionation to produce the most evolved compositions. The pumice products are characterised by a heterogeneous mineral population represented in part by crystals formed at the margin of the reservoir and a syn-eruptive mixing is identified in intermediate samples during the magma extraction. The H 2 O concentration determined by FTIR measurements of the melt inclusions suggest that this magma body resided and crystallized at shallow level prior to eruption, possibly about 4 km depth...|$|E
40|$|The 3. 7 ka year-old Averno 2 {{eruption}} {{is one of}} {{the rare}} eruptions to have occurred in the northwest sector of the Phlegraean Fields caldera (PFc) over the past 5 ka. We focus here on the fallout deposits of the pyroclastic succession emplaced during this eruption. We present major and trace element data on the bulk pumices, along with major and volatile element data on clinopyroxene-hosted melt inclusions, in order to assess the conditions of storage, ascent, and eruption of the feeding trachytic magma. Crystal fractionation accounts for the evolution from trachyte to <b>alkali-trachyte</b> magmas; these were intimately mingled (at the micrometer scale) during the climactic phase of the eruption. The Averno 2 alkali trachyte represents one of the most evolved magmas erupted within the Phlegraean Fields area and belongs to the series of differentiated trachytic magmas erupted at different locations 5 ka ago. Melt inclusions record significant variations in H 2 O (from 0. 4 to 5 wt%), S (from 0. 01 to 0. 06 wt%), Cl (from 0. 75 up to 1 wt%), and F (from 0. 20 to > 0. 50 wt%) during both magma crystallization and degassing. Unlike the eruptions occurring in {{the central part of the}} PFc, deep-derived input(s) of gas and/or magma are not required to explain the composition of melt inclusions and the mineralogy of Averno 2 pumices. Compositional data on bulk pumices, glassy matrices, and melt inclusions suggest that the Averno 2 eruption mainly resulted from successive extrusions of independent magma batches probably emplaced at depths of 2 – 4 km along regional fractures bordering the Neapolitan Yellow Tuff caldera...|$|E
40|$|New geochronological, geochemical, and Sr-isotopic data on volcanics erupted {{before the}} Campanian Ignimbrite (CI, 37 ka) and the Neapolitan Yellow Tuff (NYT, 12 ka) caldera-forming eruptions at Campi Flegrei (CF) have {{allowed us to}} {{investigate}} the behavior and temporal evolution of the Phlegraean magmatic system. The most prominent feature of the CF magmatic system was {{the existence of a}} large, trachytic magma chamber, episodically recharged, which fed eruptions for tens of thousands years before the CI and NYT eruptions. During the pre-CI caldera activity, magmas were episodically erupted from vents located outside the present caldera structure. These magmas ranged in composition from trachyte to <b>alkali-trachyte,</b> with Sr-isotope ratios increasing through time, and becoming identical to that of the CI magma, at about 44 ka ago. This suggests that the Phlegraean magmatic system before the CI eruption was acting as an open system. It was being progressively replenished by new batches of magma that mixed with the resident less radiogenic, fractionating trachytic magmas and was periodically tapped. The magma chamber evolution culminated in the catastrophic eruption of the voluminous (150 km 3 DRE), chemically and isotopically zoned CI trachytic magmas, and in the resultant CI caldera formation. Subsequent to the CI eruption, during a period of moderate subaereal volcanic activity of about 20 ka duration, magmas predominantly trachytic to alkali-trachytic in composition and isotopically similar to the last emitted CI magma were erupted from vents located inside the CI caldera. The temporal trend shown by Sr-isotope ratios provides evidence for a new input of alkali-trachytic magma, at ca. 15 ka, with 87 Sr/ 86 Sr ratio identical to that of the alkali-trachytic magma feeding {{the first phase of the}} NYT eruption. These data testify to the arrival in a short time span of a new trachytic to alkali-trachytic magma in the system, isotopically distinct from the CI magma, that gave rise about 3 ka later to eruption of the NYT (40 km 3 DRE) ...|$|E
