40|$|BackgroundThe {{purpose of}} this study is to report a single center {{experience}} with its safety and feasibility of transradial arterial (TRA) approach in extra-cranial carotid artery (ECCA) stenting. Methods and results 74 patients were consecutively enrolled in this study. A retrograde-engagement technique, involving looping 6 -F Kimny guiding catheter, was utilized for ECCA angiographic study. For ECCA stenting, the 6 -F Kimny guiding catheter was replaced with a 7 -F Kimny guiding catheter and the procedure was performed as the follows. First, a 0. 035 -in. Teflon wire was carefully advanced into the common CA. Second, a PercuSurge GuardWire was inserted into the external CA, followed by distal balloon inflation for an <b>anchoring</b> <b>support.</b> Third, the 6 -F guiding catheter was removed, followed by exchanging a 7 -F kimny guiding catheter which was advanced along the 0. 035 -in. Teflon wire and the PercuSurge GuardWire to proximal part of common CA. Distal protection device was then utilized to protect from distal embolization during the procedure. One procedure failed due to external CA did not provide an <b>anchoring</b> <b>support.</b> Thus, the procedure was successful in 74 (98. 7 %) patients. No vascular or bleeding complication was observed. Minor stroke occurred in 3 (4. 0 %) patients during the procedure. All of them were completely recovery within 1 week. ConclusionsThe TRA approach for ECCA stenting is safe and feasible. This access may offer a last resort for patients with unsuited to femoral arterial access and endarterectomy...|$|E

In this paper, taking the right side slope of K 27 + 140 [*]m~ 380 [*]m typical section (K 27 slope for short) in Chongqing Fuling-Fengdu-Shizhu expresses highway as an example to calculate and analyze. The K 27 slope is under sinusoidal vehicle load and <b>supported</b> by <b>anchor</b> cable and antislide pile to resist downslide strength; at the same time, the combined effect of them is studied.

30|$|As {{mentioned}} previously, the prestress of rock bolts {{is one of}} the key {{parameters for}} bolting, and plays a decisive role on the effect of <b>anchor</b> <b>support.</b> The previous studies show that the anchor prestress should reach a level of 30  %– 50  % of anchor yield strength.

40|$|Yachts {{are built}} to provide guests {{with a unique}} experience. In order to provide this experience, yachts are often {{anchored}} at special locations. Captains prefer to use a single bow anchor when they moor the vessel. Problems are reported {{with respect to the}} availability while yachts are at anchor. These are caused by environmental forces. Availability is the yachting term for the operability of a yacht. The comfort on board and the availability of activities are the main aspects playing a role in the overall availability. Horizontal motions and accelerations of the vessel, respectively caused by wind and waves, are the main issues at anchor. These undesired accelerations can be reduced by controlling the yacht’s heading, ensuring optimal wave interaction. The objective of this research is to improve the availability while at anchor by suppressing the horizontal motions and controlling the heading of the vessel. Previous research suggests that using thrusters is a feasible solution for this. The research performed in this thesis provides a design proposition based on a quasi static analysis. For that reason, mathematical models are developed which are embedded in engineering tools. When these tools are defined, the first step is a parameter study. This has been performed to examine what, theoretically, is the preferred <b>anchor</b> <b>support</b> system. In this study, the required power and mooring force is calculated for a predefined capability. The capability is the environmental condition at which the system is able to be stationary. Based on the results can be concluded that the mooring line has to be located close to the pivot point of the vessel and that the thrusters have to be located with a large distance to the pivot point opposite to the mooring line location. Using multiple thrusters is often preferable because the same thrust can be delivered with less power. However, the thruster located the closest to the mooring line and pivot point delivers little thrust compared to the other thruster located further away. The usage of a tunnel thruster or an azimuth thruster is preferred. The difference between these two is limited because the azimuth thruster operates at an angle θ of 90 degrees. The theoretical solutions found neglect practical aspects which have {{to be taken into account}} for implementation; e. g. the layout of the vessel and the range of the required headings. To consider these aspects, multiple assessment criteria have been defined. The design study has been performed with various design cases. The capability of these cases has been calculated with the developed model in terms of wind speed. When the used power is reduced, the comfort with respect to noise is increased. However, this reduces the capability as well because less thrust can be delivered. The reduction of the capability is related to the power margin to the power 1 / 3, when the thrusters are operating at maximum allowable power. For each design case, the dynamic positioning capability has been calculated to investigate whether including a mooring line influences the capability. As a result of this research can be concluded that the capability of the <b>anchor</b> <b>support</b> systems is higher than the capability of the DP systems and that the <b>anchor</b> <b>support</b> system requires less power to do so. The DP system uses twice as much power for the required range of headings. The design proposition is determined based on the results of the quasi static calculations supported by a multi-criteria analysis. The preferred <b>anchor</b> <b>support</b> system for a yacht has an azimuth stern thruster in front of the platforms at the stern. Placing a thruster below these platforms causes safety issues and reduces the comfort. The yacht is equipped with an azimuth thruster in the bow because such a thruster can provide the same amount of thrust with less power and provides better controllability. The mooring line location is situated in the bow and is located on the centreline, thus an underwater anchor is required. The used approach and developed tools are provided to Feadship which allow them to consider the capability of <b>anchor</b> <b>support</b> system in the early design phase of the new yachts. This gives Feadship the opportunity to build yachts with a higher availability at anchor. As a result, the guests will be able to enjoy an even more unique experience due to the control of horizontal motions. Confidential thesis - Abstract only.

40|$|The {{emerging}} {{standards for}} the next-generation wireless communication system demand for multi-band RF front-ends. Reconfigurable RF devices based on MEMS technology have emerged {{with the potential to}} significantly reduce the system complexity and cost. Robust operation of RF MEMS tuners under the non-ideal effects due to fabrication uncertainties and environmental variations is critical in achieving reliable RF MEMS reconfigurable devices. Therefore, it is essential to model and characterize these non-ideal effects, and further to alleviate these non-ideal effects by design optimization. ^ In this dissertation, the effects of non-perfect <b>anchor</b> <b>support,</b> residual stress, and temperature sensibility of MEMS tuners have been studied. The <b>anchor</b> <b>supports</b> of MEMS beams, which are widely used as tunable components, are often far from the ideally assumed built-in or step-up conditions. An equation-based nonlinear model for inclined supports in non-flat fixed-fixed beams has been developed and validated by experimental results. Residual stress developed during the fabrication presents the major challenges in developing reliable MEMS tuners. An efficient extraction method for in-plane residual stress has been proposed using a single beam test structure. This method has been demonstrated by wafer-scale measurements of electrostatically actuated beams. The statistic and spatial distribution of extracted residual stresses on a quarter wafer is presented, and the accuracy of this method is evaluated by uncertainty analysis. With the awareness the residual stress effects, the design optimization has been conducted for designing stress-tolerant micro-corrugated diaphragm tuners used in tunable cavity resonators/filters. Furthermore, the temperature sensitivity issue results from the mismatch of material properties between the structure material and substrate has been discussed and a thermally-stable RF MEMS tuner based on a nonuniform micro corrugated diaphragm has been proposed and experimentally validated over a wide temperature variation. ...|$|R
