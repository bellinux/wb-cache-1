5|$|Due to {{the number}} of GPUs in the system, its initial boot was unsuccessful. This was because its {{motherboard}} uses a 32 bit BIOS, which only had approximately 3 GB of <b>address</b> <b>space</b> for the video cards. However, Asus managed to provide them a specialized BIOS that entirely skipped the <b>address</b> <b>space</b> allocation of the GTX 295 video cards. The BIOS-replacement coreboot was not tested.|$|E
5|$|Main {{memory in}} a {{parallel}} computer is either shared memory (shared between all processing elements in a single <b>address</b> <b>space),</b> or distributed memory (in which each processing element has its own local <b>address</b> <b>space).</b> Distributed memory refers {{to the fact that}} the memory is logically distributed, but often implies that it is physically distributed as well. Distributed shared memory and memory virtualization combine the two approaches, where the processing element has its own local memory and access to the memory on non-local processors. Accesses to local memory are typically faster than accesses to non-local memory.|$|E
5|$|The Z80 {{processor}} {{used in the}} Spectrum has a 16-bit address bus, {{which means}} only 64KB of memory can be directly addressed. To facilitate the extra 80KB of RAM the designers used bank switching so the new memory would be available as eight pages of 16KB {{at the top of}} the <b>address</b> <b>space.</b> The same technique was used to page between the new 16KB editor ROM and the original 16KB BASIC ROM at the bottom of the <b>address</b> <b>space.</b>|$|E

5|$|The +3 saw the {{addition}} of two more 16KB ROMs. One was home to {{the second part of}} the reorganised 128 ROM and the other hosted the +3's disk operating system. This was a modified version of Amstrad's PCWDOS (the disk access code used in LocoScript), called +3DOS. These two new 16KB ROMs and the original two 16KB ROMs were now physically implemented together as two 32KB chips. To be able to run CP/M, which requires RAM at the bottom of the <b>address</b> <b>space,</b> the bank-switching was further improved, allowing the ROM to be paged out for another 16KB of RAM.|$|E
25|$|The {{design of}} the IPv6 <b>address</b> <b>space</b> differs {{significantly}} from IPv4. The primary reason for subnetting in IPv4 is to improve efficiency in the utilization of the relatively small <b>address</b> <b>space</b> available, particularly to enterprises. No such limitations exist in IPv6, as the large <b>address</b> <b>space</b> available, even to end-users, is not a limiting factor.|$|E

25|$|An {{alternative}} view, {{from the}} world of the Semantic Web focuses instead on making all things (not just those electronic, smart, or RFID-enabled) addressable by the existing naming protocols, such as URI.
