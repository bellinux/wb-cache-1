50|$|Today’s {{windshields}} are {{a safety}} device just like seat belts and airbags. The {{installation of the}} auto glass is done with an automotive grade urethane designed specifically for automobiles. The adhesive creates a molecular bond between the glass and the vehicle.

The urethane sealant is protected from UV in sunlight by a band of dark dots {{around the edge of the}} windshield.

In {{the case of the}} failed breast implant catheter, the crack path was very simple, but the cause more subtle. Further scanning electron microscopy showed numerous microcracks between the bag and the catheter, indicating that the <b>adhesive</b> <b>bond</b> between the two components had failed prematurely, perhaps through faulty manufacture. The material of construction of both bag and catheter, silicone rubber is a physically weak elastomer, and product design must allow for the low tear or shear strength of the material.|$|E
50|$|After cleaning, an opaque {{base coat}} of powder {{is applied to}} the glass {{substrate}} as the initial, most important layer of UV protection. Once the powder attracts, the product is heated to activate the process of gelling, which secures the <b>adhesive</b> <b>bond.</b> It is crucial to control the amount of powder that goes on to the surface. With too little, the coating becomes transparent and the protection is diminished. Too much can create a dripping effect or disperse uneven amounts, leading {{to one side of the}} glass container being heavier than the other. In the case of powder coating nail polish and other cosmetics bottles, experienced powder coaters typically use a highly chemical-resistant form of powder, which makes it impervious to the aggressive chemicals inherent with polish and primer.|$|E

5000|$|Aggressive {{strumming}} with a pick {{can easily}} damage the polished {{surface of the}} guitar's soundboard. Pickguards fitted to acoustic guitars are usually made from thin (2 mm) sheets of plastic (such as PVC), attached with an adhesive just below the sound hole. The material should not be unduly thick or heavy since this might reduce vibration of the soundboard and alter the tone or volume of the instrument. Although not a job for the novice, a badly scratched pickguard could be removed and replaced by a guitar technician or luthier. On some older Martin guitars it is quite common to see the black pickguard curling up at the edges where the <b>adhesive</b> <b>bond</b> between the plastic and the wooden top has broken down.

50|$|In general, {{the lower}} the surface tension of a liquid coating, the easier {{it will be to}} form a {{satisfactory}} wet film from it. The difference between the surface tension of a coating and the surface energy of a solid substrate to which a coating is applied affects how the liquid coating flows out over the substrate. It also affects the strength of the <b>adhesive</b> <b>bond</b> between the substrate and the dry film. If for instance, the surface tension of the coating is higher than the surface tension of the substrate, then the coating will not spread out and form a film. As the surface tension of the substrate is increased, it will reach a point to where the coating will successfully wet the substrate but have poor adhesion. Continuous increase in the coating surface tension will result in better wetting in film formation and better dry film adhesion.|$|E

50|$|Careful {{tailoring}} of the shockwave {{shape and}} intensity has also enabled the inspection of bonded composite structures via laser shocking. The technology, termed Laser Bond Inspection initiates a shockwave that reflects off {{the backside of}} a bonded structure and returns as a tensile wave. As the tensile wave passes back through the <b>adhesive</b> <b>bond,</b> depending {{on the strength of}} the bond and the peak tensile stress of the stress wave, the tensile wave will either pass through the bond or rupture it. By controlling the pressure of the tensile wave this procedure is capable of reliably locally testing adhesion strength between bonded joints.

Fundamental issues are also studied to characterize and quantify the effect of shock wave produced by laser inside these complex materials.|$|E
50|$|Glass ionomer cement is {{primarily}} {{used in the}} prevention of dental caries. This dental material has good <b>adhesive</b> <b>bond</b> properties to tooth structure, allowing it to form a tight seal between the internal structures of the tooth and the surrounding environment. Dental caries is caused by bacterial production of acid during their metabolic actions. The acid produced from this metabolism results in the breakdown of tooth enamel and subsequent inner structures of the tooth, if the disease is not intervened by a dental professional, or if the carious lesion does not arrest and/or the enamel re-mineralises by itself. Glass ionomer cements act as sealants when pits and fissures in the tooth occur and release fluoride to prevent further enamel demineralisation and promote remineralisation. Fluoride can also hinder bacterial growth, by inhibiting their metabolism of ingested sugars in the diet. It does this by inhibiting various metabolic enzymes within the bacteria. This leads to a reduction in the acid produced during the bacteria’s digestion of food, preventing a further drop in pH and therefore preventing carious.|$|E
50|$|Borosilicate glass {{has become}} the {{material}} of choice for fused deposition modeling (FDM), or fused filament fabrication (FFF), build plates. Its low coefficient of expansion makes borosilicate glass, when used in combination with resistance-heating plates and pads, an ideal material for the heated build platform onto which plastic materials are extruded one layer at a time. The initial layer of build must be placed onto a substantially flat, heated surface to minimize shrinkage of some build materials (ABS, polycarbonate, polyamide, etc.) due to cooling after deposition. The build plate will cycle from room temperature to between 100 °C and 130 °C for each prototype that is built. The temperature, along with various coatings (Kapton tape, painter tape, hair spray, glue stick, ABS+acetone slurry, etc.), ensure that the first layer may be adhered to and remain adhered to the plate, without warping, as the first and subsequent layers cool following extrusion. Subsequently, following the build, the heating elements and plate are allowed to cool. The resulting residual stress formed when the plastic contracts as it cools, while the glass remains relatively dimensionally unchanged due to the low coefficient of thermal expansion, provides a convenient aid in removing the otherwise mechanically bonded plastic from the build plate. In some cases the parts self-separate as the developed stresses overcome the <b>adhesive</b> <b>bond</b> of the build material to the coating material and underlying plate.|$|E

A good knowledge of the mechanical properties of <b>adhesive</b> <b>bonds</b> in lap joints is a prerequisite to the design and reliable prediction {{of the performance of}} these bonded structures. Furthermore, the lap joint may be subject to high-temperature environments in service. Early detection of the degree of thermal degradation in <b>adhesive</b> <b>bonds</b> is required under these circumstances. A variety of ultrasonic nondestructive evaluation (NDE) techniques can be used to determine the thickness and the elastic moduli of adhesively bonded joints [1 – 4].

40|$|In this work, {{ultrasonic}} {{techniques to}} nondestructively evaluate <b>adhesive</b> <b>bond</b> degradation have been studied. The {{key to the}} present approach is the introduction of an external factor which pulls the <b>adhesive</b> <b>bond</b> in the nonlinear range, simultaneously with the application of an ultrasonic technique. With the aid of an external static tensile loading, a superimposed longitudinal wave has. been used to obtain {{the slopes of the}} stress-strain curve of an <b>adhesive</b> <b>bond</b> at a series of load levels. The critical load, at which a reduction of the slope is detected by the superimposed longitudinal wave, is an indication of the onset of nonlinear behavior of the <b>adhesive</b> <b>bond,</b> and therefore of bond degradation. This approach has been applied to the detection of <b>adhesive</b> <b>bond</b> degradation induced by cyclic fatigue loading. Analogously to the longitudinal wave case, a superimposed shear wave has been used to obtain the effective shear modulus of adhesive layers at different shear load levels. The onset of the nonlinear behavior of an <b>adhesive</b> <b>bond</b> under shear loading has been detected by the use of a superimposed shear wave. Experiments show that a longitudinal wave can also detect the nonlinear behavior when an <b>adhesive</b> <b>bond</b> is subjected to shear loading. An optimal combination of ultrasonic testing and mechanical loading methods for the detection of degradation related nonlinear behavior of adhesive bonds has been discussed. For the purpose of a practical application, an ultrasonic technique that uses a temperature increase as an alternative to static loading has also been investigated. A general strain-temperature correspondence principle that relates a mechanical strain to a temperature has been presented. Explicit strain-temperature correspondence relations for both the tension and shear cases have been derived. An important parameter which quantifies the relation between the wave velocity and temperature has been defined. This parameter, which is indicative of <b>adhesive</b> <b>bond</b> nonlinearity and which can be conveniently obtained by an ultrasonic measurement, has been used as an indication of <b>adhesive</b> <b>bond</b> degradation. Experimental results have shown that the temperature increase method is a convenient and productive alternative to static loading.
