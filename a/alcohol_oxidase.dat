50|$|Pichia pastoris has two <b>alcohol</b> <b>oxidase</b> genes, Aox1 and Aox2, {{which have}} a {{strongly}} inducible promoter. These genes allow Pichia to use methanol as a carbon and energy source. The AOX promoters are induced by methanol and are repressed by e.g. glucose. Usually the gene for the desired protein is introduced {{under the control of}} the AOX1 promoter, which means that protein production can be induced by the addition of methanol. In a popular expression vector, the desired protein is produced as a fusion product to the secretion signal of the α-mating factor from Saccharomyces cerevisiae (baker's yeast). This causes the protein to be secreted into the growth medium, which greatly facilitates subsequent protein purification. There are commercially available plasmids that have these features incorporated (such as the pPICZα vector).|$|E

The initial aim of this project was to identify hitherto unexploited alcohol oXidases; however the results obtained from the screening of potential source organisms were not consistent under the conditions applied and yield was found to be low in all cases studied. During these investigations a need for high throughput screening methods was identified and beeause of this a new aim was initiated, that of developing a biosensor designed for the high throughput screening of libraries of enzymes {{on the basis of the}} H 202 produced as a by-product of oxidase activity. A biosensor was designed and created in Saccharomyces cerevisiae that indicated the presence of H 202 by increased levels of GFP. Aryl-alcohol oxidase (AAO) from Pleurotus eryngii was expressed for the first time in S. cerevisiae in order to provide a positive control for these experiments and the biosensor was found capable of detecting the H 20 2 produced as a by-product of the action of this enzyme on the substrate veratryl alcohol. Mutant libraries of AAO were produced, transformed into the biosensor yeast and screened by FACS analysis, this approach proved unsuccessful in identifying any mutants of interest. Further optimisation is required before the biosensor can be a useful tool in screening libraries of oxidase enzymes on the basis of activity.

The O 2 -dependent oxidation of prim-alcohols by flavin-containing <b>alcohol</b> <b>oxidases</b> often yields mixtures of aldehyde and carboxylic acid, {{which is due to}} “over-oxidation” of the aldehyde hydrate intermediate. In order to directly convert alcohols into carboxylic acids, rational engineering of 5 -(hydroxymethyl) furfural oxidase was performed. In an attempt to improve the binding of the aldehyde hydrate in the active site to boost aldehyde-oxidase activity, two active-site residues were exchanged for hydrogen-bond-donating and -accepting amino acids.

Both proteins are homo-oligomers consisting of eight identical subunits, each containing one FAD as the prosthetic group. They were both rapidly inactivated upon incubation in 80 % glycerol, due to their dissociation into the constituting snbunits, which however still contained FAD. Dilution of dissociated AO in neutral buffer lead to reactivation of the protein due to AO re-assembly, as was demonstrated by non-denaturing PAGE. After use of mixtures of purified AO from H. polymorpha and P. pastoris active hybrid AO oligomers were formed. When prior to dissociation FAD was chemically removed from AO, reactiva-tion or re-assembly did not occur independent of externally added FAD...|$|R
50|$|An {{example of}} a {{moonlighting}} enzyme is pyruvate carboxylase. This enzyme catalyzes the carboxylation of pyruvate into oxaloacetate, thereby replenishing the tricarboxylic acid cycle. Surprisingly, in yeast species such as H. polymorpha and P. pastoris, pyruvate carboylase is also essential for proper targeting and assembly of the peroxisomal protein <b>alcohol</b> <b>oxidase</b> (AO). AO, the first enzyme of methanol metabolism, is a homo-octameric flavoenzyme. In wild type cells, this enzyme is present as enzymatically active AO octamers in the peroxisomal matrix. However, in cells lacking pyruvate carboxylase, AO monomers accumulate in the cytosol, indicating that pyruvate carboxylase has a second fully unrelated function in assembly and import. The function in AO import/assembly is fully independent of the enzyme activity of pyruvate carboxylase, because amino acid substitutions can be introduced that fully inactive the enzyme activity of pyruvate carboxylase, without affecting its function in AO assembly and import. Conversely, mutations are known that block the function of this enzyme in import and assembly of AO, but {{have no effect on}} the enzymatic activity of the protein.|$|E

The growth characteristics and also the induction and degradation of <b>alcohol</b> <b>oxidase</b> were compared with the parent strain and mutant strain ADU- 15. In the parent strain, initiation of <b>alcohol</b> <b>oxidase</b> synthesis was delayed by the addition of 0. 5 % glucose to the methanol medium, whereas it was not delayed in mutant strain ADU- 15.

All metabolites are produced simultaneously with the extracellular ligninolytic enzymes and have an important physiological function in the fungal ligninolytic system. Both mono- and dichlorinated anisyl alcohols are distinctly better substrates for the extracellular aryl <b>alcohol</b> <b>oxidases</b> than veratryl <b>alcohol.</b> The aldehydes formed are readily recycled by reduction by washed fungal mycelium, thus creating an extracellular H 2 O 2 production system regulated by intracellular enzymes.

It was therefore concluded that the chlorinated anisyl alcohols are well protected against the fungus's own aggressive ligninolytic enzymes. The relative amounts of veratryl alcohol and the chlorinated anisyl alcohols differ significantly according to the growth conditions, indicating that production of veratryl alcohol and the production of the (chlorinated) anisyl metabolites are independently regulated. We conclude that the chlorinated anisyl metabolites biosynthesized by the white rot fungus Bjerkandera sp. strain BOS 55 can be purposefully produced for ecologically significant processes such as lignin degradation...|$|R

The <b>alcohol</b> <b>oxidase</b> activity of the whole cell Pichia pastoris was evaluated in comparison with yeast biomass production. Materials and Methods: Methylotrophic yeast P. pastoris was obtained from Collection of Standard Microorganisms, Department of Bacterial Vaccines, Pasteur Institute of Iran (CSMPI). Stock culture was maintained on YPD agar plates. <b>Alcohol</b> <b>oxidase</b> was strongly induced by addition of 0. 5 % methanol as the carbon source.

The activity of <b>alcohol</b> <b>oxidase</b> was determined by method of Tane et al. Results: At the end of the logarithmic phase of cell culture, the <b>alcohol</b> <b>oxidase</b> activity of the whole cell P. Pastoris reached the highest level. In comparison, the <b>alcohol</b> <b>oxidase</b> activity was measured in an immobilized P. pastoris when entrapped in polyacrylamide gel beads. The <b>alcohol</b> <b>oxidase</b> activity of cells was induced by addition of 0. 5 % methanol as the carbon source. The cells were permeabilized by cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) and immobilized.

40|$|Cork, {{the outer}} bark of Quercus suber, shows a unique {{compositional}} structure, {{a set of}} remarkable properties, including high recalcitrance. Cork colonisation by Ascomycota remains largely overlooked. Herein, Aspergillus nidulans secretome on cork was analysed (2 DE). Proteomic data were further complemented by microscopic (SEM) and spectroscopic (ATRFTIR) evaluation of the colonised substrate and by targeted analysis of lignin degradation compounds (UPLC-HRMS). Data showed that the fungus formed an intricate network of hyphae around the cork cell walls, which enabled polysaccharides and lignin superficial degradation, but probably not of suberin. The degradation of polysaccharides was suggested by the identification of few polysaccharide degrading enzymes (β-glucosidases and endo- 1, 5 --L-arabinosidase). Lignin degradation, which likely evolved throughout a Fenton-like mechanism relying on the activity of <b>alcohol</b> <b>oxidases,</b> {{was supported by the}} identification of small aromatic compounds (e. g. cinnamic acid and veratrylaldehyde) and of several putative high molecular weight lignin degradation products.

40|$|The {{regulation}} of the synthesis of four dissimilatory enzymes involved in methanol metabolism, namely <b>alcohol</b> <b>oxidase,</b> formaldehyde dehydrogenase, formate dehydrogenase and catalase was investigated in the yeasts Hansenula polymorpha and Kloeckera sp. 2201.

40|$|The flavin {{prosthetic}} group (FAD) of p-hydroxybenzoate hydroxylase from Pseudomonas fluorescens {{was replaced by}} a stereochemical analog, which is spontaneously formed from natural FAD in <b>alcohol</b> <b>oxidases</b> from methylotrophic yeasts. Reconstitution of p-hydroxybenzoate hydroxylase from apoprotein and modified FAD is a rapid process complete within seconds. Crystals of the enzyme-substrate complex of modified FAD-containing p-hydroxybenzoate hydroxylase diffract to 2. 1 A resolution. The crystal structure provides direct evidence for the presence of an arabityl sugar chain in the modified form of FAD. The isoalloxazine ring of the arabinoflavin adenine dinucleotide (a-FAD) is located in a cleft outside the active site as recently observed in several other p-hydroxybenzoate hydroxylase complexes. Like the native enzyme, a-FAD-containing p-hydroxybenzoate hydroxylase preferentially binds the phenolate form of the substrate (pKo = 7. 2). The substrate acts as an effector highly stimulating the rate of enzyme reduction by NADPH (kred > 500 s- 1). The oxidative part of the catalytic cycle of a-FAD-containing p-hydroxybenzoate hydroxylase differs from native enzyme. Partial uncoupling of hydroxylation results in the formation of about 0. 3 mol of 3, 4 -dihydroxybenzoate and 0. 7 mol of hydrogen peroxide per mol NADPH oxidized.

NtnD bears no similarity to the analogous TOL plasmid XylB (benzyl alcohol dehydrogenase) protein either in its biochemistry, being NAD(P) + independent and requiring assay via dye-linked electron transfer, or in its deduced amino acid sequence.
