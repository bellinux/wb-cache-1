25|$|The {{energy crisis}} led to greater {{interest}} in renewable energy, nuclear power and domestic fossil fuels. According to Peter Grossman, American energy policies since the crisis have been dominated by crisis-mentality thinking, promoting expensive quick fixes and single-shot solutions that ignore market and technology realities. He wrote that instead of providing stable rules that support basic research while leaving plenty of scope for entrepreneurship and innovation, congresses and presidents have repeatedly backed policies which promise solutions that <b>are</b> <b>politically</b> expedient, but whose prospects are doubtful.|$|E
25|$|There is also {{criticism}} that federal energy policies since the 1973 oil crisis have {{been dominated by}} crisis-mentality thinking, promoting expensive quick fixes and single-shot solutions that ignore market and technology realities. Instead of providing stable rules that support basic research while leaving plenty of scope for American entrepreneurship and innovation, congresses and presidents have repeatedly backed policies which promise solutions that <b>are</b> <b>politically</b> expedient, but whose prospects are doubtful, without adequate consideration of the dollar costs, environmental costs, or national security costs of their actions.|$|E

25|$|Ethnically, the Havasupai and the Hualapai are one people, {{although}} today, they <b>are</b> <b>politically</b> separate {{groups as}} the result of U.S. government policy. The Hualapai (Pa'a or Pai) had three subtribes: the Plateau People, Middle Mountain People and Yavapai Fighter. The subtribes were divided into seven bands, which themselves were broken up into thirteen regional bands or local groups. The local groups were composed of several extended family groups, living in small villages: The Havasupai were just the Havasooa Pa'a regional band (or local group) of the Nyav-kapai (“Eastern People”) of the Plateau People subtribe.|$|E
25|$|The Reut Institute expands {{on these}} {{concerns}} of many Israeli Jews {{and says that}} a one-state scenario without any institutional safeguards would negate Israel's status as a homeland for the Jewish people. When proposed as a political solution by non-Israelis, {{the assumption is that}} the idea is probably being put forward by those who <b>are</b> <b>politically</b> motivated to harm Israel and, by extension, Israeli Jews. They argue that the absorption of millions of Palestinians, along with a right of return for Palestinian refugees, and the generally high birthrate among Palestinians would quickly render Jews an ethnic minority and eliminate their rights to self-determination.|$|E
25|$|The Middle Powers Initiative (MPI), {{a program}} of the Global Security Institute, {{highlights}} the importance of middle powers diplomacy. Through MPI, eight international non-governmental organizations are able to work primarily with middle power governments to encourage and educate the nuclear weapons states to take immediate practical steps that reduce nuclear dangers, and commence negotiations to eliminate nuclear weapons.

25|$|The {{causes of}} this {{violence}} against Muslims are varied. The roots {{are thought to}} lie in India's history– resentment toward the Islamic domination of India during the Middle Ages, policies established by the country's British colonizers, and the violent partition of India into a Muslim-majority Pakistan and a secular India with a Muslim minority. Many scholars believe that incidents of anti-Muslim violence <b>are</b> <b>politically</b> motivated {{and a part of}} the electoral strategy of mainstream political parties who are associated with Hindu nationalism like the Bharatiya Janata Party. Other scholars believe that the violence is not widespread but that it is restricted to certain urban areas because of local socio-political conditions.|$|E
25|$|Squamish {{territory}} also overlapped {{with the}} territories of neighboring indigenous peoples. The territory is shared between the territories of the Musqueam, Tseil-waututh to the south, and the Lil'wat to the north. These neighbouring peoples also have Squamish language names. The Tseil-waututh are Sel̓íl̓witulh, the Shishalh are the Shishá7lh, the Musqueam are Xwmétskwiyam, and the Lil'wat are Lúx̱wels. Roberts Creek, on the Sunshine Coast, {{is considered the}} border between the Squamish territory and Shishalh's. The Squamish are culturally and historically similar, but <b>are</b> <b>politically</b> different from their kin, the Tseil-waututh. Through family inter-marriage and the land rights that often came with it, many places for resource gathering were also shared.|$|E
25|$|Research {{has shown}} that 66% of social media users {{actively}} engage in political activity online, and like many other behaviors, online activities translate into offline ones. With research from the 'MacArthur Research Network on Youth and Participatory Politics' stating that young people who <b>are</b> <b>politically</b> active online are double as likely to vote {{than those who are}} not politically active online. Therefore, political applications of social networking sites are crucial, particularly to engage with the youth, who perhaps are the least educated in politics and the most in social networking sites. Social media is therefore a very effective way in which politicians can connect with a younger audience through their political campaigns.|$|E
