5|$|In January 1943, {{rates for}} roadwork were set at 80 {{cents an hour}} {{for a man with}} a four-horse team, a single man {{received}} 40 cents <b>an</b> <b>hour</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> man with a two-horse team could receive 65 cents per hour. The foreman collected wages of 50 cents an hour for roadwork.|$|E
5|$|Wind power {{forecasting}} {{methods are}} used, but predictability {{of any particular}} wind farm is low for short-term operation. For any particular generator there is an 80% chance that wind output will change less than 10% in <b>an</b> <b>hour</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> 40% chance that it will change 10% or more in 5 hours.|$|E
5|$|A {{particularly}} damning {{piece of}} evidence came from a bonnetmaker named Maria Durden who told the court that Webster had visited her {{a week before the}} murder and had said {{that she was going to}} Birmingham to sell some property, jewellery and a house that her aunt had left her. The jury interpreted this as a sign that Webster had premeditated the murder and convicted her after deliberating for about <b>an</b> <b>hour</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> quarter.|$|E

5|$|Accessibility to Odense {{was greatly}} {{increased}} when the ferry service {{between the two}} main Danish islands, Zealand and Funen, {{was replaced by the}} Great Belt Bridge – opened in 1997 for rail traffic, 1998 for road traffic. When the bridge opened, it was the second longest suspension bridge in the world. Aarhus can be reached by train in 1 hour and 33 minutes while, thanks to the Great Belt Bridge, trains to Copenhagen can take as little as <b>an</b> <b>hour</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> quarter.|$|E
5|$|<b>An</b> <b>hour</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> half later, the High Seas Fleet {{under the}} command of Admiral Scheer left the Jade; the force was {{composed}} of 16 dreadnoughts. The High Seas Fleet was accompanied by the IV Scouting Group, composed of the light cruisers , , , , and , and 31 torpedo boats of the I, III, V, and VII Flotillas, led by the light cruiser Rostock. The six pre-dreadnoughts of the II Battle Squadron had departed from the Elbe roads at 02:45, and rendezvoused with the battle fleet at 05:00.|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{seemingly}} {{close proximity to}} its neighbouring communities, a motorized pirogue trip to Carabane from Elinkine, the nearest village, takes about thirty minutes; the trip once took <b>an</b> <b>hour</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> half by canoe. Carabane may also be accessed by a two- or three-hour boat trip from Ziguinchor. Travelling from Cap Skirring via Cachouane is also possible, but as a detailed map of the region would make clear, the channels of salt water are not easily navigated.|$|E

5|$|Having {{failed to}} take Caen through {{successive}} flanking manoeuvres, Montgomery decided the next attack would be a frontal assault. Although Caen's strategic importance had vastly diminished since D-Day, he sought control of Bourguébus and the commanding high ground to the south. On 5 July the orders for Operation Charnwood were issued; {{it was to be}} launched at 04:20, <b>an</b> <b>hour</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> half before dawn on 8 July.|$|E
5|$|Johnson {{wanted to}} power the Q-12 with a ramjet engine built by the Marquardt Corporation for the Boeing CIM-10 Bomarc {{long-range}} surface-to-air missile. Marquardt and Lockheed had already collaborated on several programs and had a close working relationship. The engine, the RJ43-MA-11, required modification, since it was only designed to burn {{as long as the}} missile needed to hit a target, while the Q-12's engine needed to operate at high temperatures for at least <b>an</b> <b>hour</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> half at high altitudes. The modified engine was designated RJ43-MA20S-4.|$|E
5|$|Kaiser and {{the rest}} of the III Battle Squadron were the leading unit of the High Seas Fleet; the four s led the line. Kaiser, the {{flagship}} of Konteradmiral H. Nordmann, was directly astern of the four Königs. I Battle Squadron, composed of the eight - and s, followed III Squadron, with the six elderly pre-dreadnoughts of II Battle Squadron bringing up the rear. Hipper's five battlecruisers left the Jade estuary at 02:00 on 31 May; Scheer, with the High Seas Fleet, followed <b>an</b> <b>hour</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> half later.|$|E

5|$|On 7 October 1800, off Sand Heads, near Calcutta, Confiance met the 40-gun East Indiaman Kent, of 824tons burthen, under Captain Robert Rivington. Kent had rescued {{the crew}} of another ship, the Queen, {{destroyed}} by fire, and therefore had an exceptionally large complement of 437 men, including her passengers; 300 of them were soldiers and sailors; Surcouf managed to board his larger opponent and, after over <b>an</b> <b>hour</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> half of battle across the decks of the ship, seize control of the Kent.|$|E
5|$|After <b>an</b> <b>hour</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> half {{had gone}} (and twenty minutes {{had passed since}} the second attack) the Indonesians {{launched}} a third and final attack up the slope towards the base, which the British responded to with artillery and grenade fire. This defence was remarkably effective, and eventually the barrage of Indonesian rocket fire halted and the few remaining British soldiers rose from their hideouts and began to clear the perimeter. Soon afterwards, Gurkha soldiers and medical staff arrived at the base by helicopter, leaving the soldiers behind to secure the area and airlifting the wounded to a nearby hospital. By this point, however, Indonesian forces had withdrawn, effectively ending the battle.|$|E
5|$|After the {{announcement}} and {{release of the}} third generation iPad, the iPad 2, which continued to be available for purchase, received a hardware upgrade. The upgraded variant of the iPad 2 features a smaller version of the Apple A5 SoC, which is able to reduce battery consumption. Benchmark tests conducted by Anandtech concluded that the upgraded variant is able to last longer by at least <b>an</b> <b>hour</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> half, depending on the task that is conducted on the device. The maximum temperature that the device heated up to was also less than original iPad 2, tests conducted by the same organisation revealed that the upgraded variant was able to operate at 1 degree lower when performing intensive tasks. Performance {{difference between the two}} variants, according to Anandtech is negligible.|$|E

5|$|As Minerve {{turned back}} towards the British convoy with the {{intention}} of cutting off the rearmost ships, Astell passed her more damaged companions to become the first ship in line. This left Windham, now at the rear, to face Minerve alone. Fortunately for Stewart, Minerve lost two topmasts as she turned to face his ship and had to pull away from the British to effect repairs. <b>An</b> <b>hour</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> half later, at 18:30, Bellone joined the action, attacking Windham directly. Victor supported Bellone and accompanied the flagship as she moved ahead to attack Ceylon and Astell. By 19:00, with Ceylon damaged so severely that she could no longer effectively sail or fight, third officer Tristam Fleming hauled the ship out of the battle line and ordered his crew to cease firing: Meriton and his second officer Thomas Oldham had both been seriously wounded by grape shot.|$|E
5|$|At 07:15 Admiral Nagumo {{ordered the}} B5Ns on Kaga and Akagi rearmed with bombs for another attack on Midway itself. This process was {{limited by the}} number of {{ordnance}} carts (used to handle the bombs and torpedoes) and ordnance elevators, preventing torpedoes from being stowed belowdeck until after all the bombs were moved up from their magazine, assembled, and mounted on the aircraft. The process normally took about <b>an</b> <b>hour</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> half; more time would be required to bring the aircraft up to the flight deck, and to warm up and launch the strike group. Around 07:40 Nagumo reversed his order when he received a message from one of his scout aircraft that American warships had been spotted. Depleted of ammunition, the first six of Sōryūs CAP Zeros landed aboard the carrier at 07:30.|$|E
5|$|At 07:15 Admiral Nagumo {{ordered the}} B5Ns still on Kaga and Akagi rearmed with bombs for another attack on Midway itself. This process was {{limited by the}} number of {{ordnance}} carts used to handle the bombs and torpedoes and the limited number of ordnance elevators. Thus, the torpedoes could not be struck below until after all the bombs were moved up from their magazine, assembled and mounted on the aircraft. This process normally took about <b>an</b> <b>hour</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> half; more time would be required to bring the aircraft up to the flight deck and warm up and launch the strike group. Around 07:40 Nagumo reversed his order when he received a message that American carriers had been spotted. At 07:30 Kaga recovered three of her CAP.|$|E

5|$|At 09:00 Sefik {{and his two}} battalions were {{approaching}} Kavak Tepe, and made contact with his 2nd Battalion that had conducted a fighting withdrawal, and <b>an</b> <b>hour</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> half later the regiment was deployed to stop the ANZACs advancing any further. Around 10:00 Kemal arrived at Scrubby Knoll and steadied some retreating troops, pushing them back into a defensive position. As they arrived, the 57th Infantry Regiment were given their orders and prepared to counter-attack. Scrubby Knoll, known to the Turks as Kemalyeri (Kemal's Place), now became {{the site of the}} Turkish headquarters {{for the remainder of the}} campaign.|$|E
5|$|Enron's audit {{committee}} was later criticized for its brief meetings that would cover {{large amounts of}} material. In one meeting on February 12, 2001, the committee met for <b>an</b> <b>hour</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> half. Enron's {{audit committee}} {{did not have the}} technical knowledge to question the auditors properly on accounting issues related to the company's special purpose entities. The committee was also unable to question the company's management due to pressures on the committee. The United States Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations of the Committee on Governmental Affairs' report accused the board members of allowing conflicts of interest to impede their duties as monitoring the company's accounting practices. When Enron's scandal became public, the audit committee's conflicts of interest were regarded with suspicion.|$|E
