5|$|For much of Arsenal's history, {{their home}} colours have been bright red shirts with white sleeves and white shorts, though {{this has not}} always been the case. The choice of red is in {{recognition}} of a charitable donation from Nottingham Forest, soon after Arsenal's foundation in 1886. Two of Dial Square's founding members, Fred Beardsley and Morris Bates, were former Forest players who had moved to Woolwich for work. <b>As</b> <b>they</b> <b>put</b> together the first team in the area, no kit could be found, so Beardsley and Bates wrote home for help and received a set of kit and a ball. The shirt was redcurrant, a dark shade of red, and was worn with white shorts and socks with blue and white hoops.|$|E

The police and National Guard largely deployed {{toward the edge of the}} expanded patrol zone. Cleveland police made 72 arrests for public intoxication, which they said was about usual for a Friday night. There were far fewer fires set the night of July 22–23 (only 14), and only a few false alarms. Cleveland fire investigators determined that none of the fires had been caused by a firebomb, and no firefighters were harassed <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>put</b> out blazes.|$|E

25|$|Australia's innings began poorly with Shane Bond {{taking the}} wickets of Adam Gilchrist and Matthew Hayden within 4 deliveries. Brad Hodge was {{dismissed}} {{in the second}} over leaving Australia reeling at 3–15. A very strong partnership between Andrew Symonds and Michael Hussey rescued Australia, <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>put</b> on 113 for the fourth wicket. Despite their dismissals, this partnership was enough to see Australia cruise to victory with ten balls to spare. Hussey top scored for Australia scoring 72 off 44 balls, however Symonds was not far behind scoring 70 off 43 balls.|$|E

Captain Blue is restored to normal and reveals that Jet was his best friend and cinematographer, but had found the Black Film one day and became entranced by its power {{and that of the}} Rainbow Oscars. In the end, it is revealed that all Jet really wanted was to prove himself as a hero to his own son Joe.|$|E
25|$|The {{fifth day}} {{did not hold}} much enthusiasm as the {{scorecards}} might suggest, as India took off from where they started, from 362/6. India's tail wagged <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>put</b> on 47 runs {{for the loss of}} 4 wickets. Ajit Agarkar was the first man {{to be out in the}} morning to Andy Bichel, and then he was followed by Parthiv Patel, whose ill-fated, top-edged hook was caught by a diving Bichel off Gillespie. The two batsmen departed without India adding any run to their score. At 362/8, Zaheer Khan and Harbhajan Singh had a fine outing with the bat. Zaheer swatted a six and three boundaries in his 27 and Harbhajan hit 19 in his own inimitable fashion, as India pushed along to 409. They had obtained a lead of 86– a rarity in Australia against Australia itself. Moreover, this achievement was significant because India were written off before the match even began.|$|E

25|$|British {{historian}} Richard J. Evans {{wrote that}} although the expulsions of ethnic Germans from Eastern Europe was done in an extremely brutal manner {{that could not be}} defended, the basic aim of expelling the ethnic German population of Poland and Czechoslovakia was justified by the subversive role played by the German minorities before World War II. Evans wrote that under the Weimar Republic the vast majority of ethnic Germans in Poland and Czechoslovakia {{made it clear that they}} were not loyal to the states they happened to live under, and under the Third Reich the German minorities in Eastern Europe were willing tools of German foreign policy. Evans also wrote that many areas of eastern Europe featured a jumble of various ethnic groups aside from Germans, and that it was the destructive role played by ethnic Germans as instruments of Nazi Germany that led to their expulsion after the war. Evans concluded by positing that the expulsions were justified <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>put</b> an end to a major problem that plagued Europe before the war; that gains to the cause of peace were a further benefit of the expulsions; and that if the Germans had been allowed to remain in Eastern Europe after the war, West Germany would have used their presence to make territorial claims against Poland and Czechoslovakia, and that given the Cold War, this could have helped cause World War III.|$|E
25|$|Man Utd's {{game against}} Aston Villa was the late {{kick-off}} on 29 March, which allowed Arsenal {{to pull back}} United's lead in the league to just three points with a 3–2 win over Bolton. This meant that the Red Devils would have to win to restore their six-point lead over Arsenal; and win they did, <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>put</b> four goals past Martin O'Neill's side. Villa were first to threaten either goal, but it took just 16 minutes for Cristiano Ronaldo to get the opener, back-heeling the ball through Martin Laursen's legs and past Scott Carson in the Villa goal. Ronaldo then turned provider for the second goal on 33 minutes, Carlos Tevez heading home the Portuguese's cross at the back post. The loudest cheers of the game, though, did not come until after half-time, as Wayne Rooney, who had not scored at Old Trafford since October, bagged a brace. Ronaldo supplied the first, back-heeling {{the ball to the}} England striker, who rounded Carson before passing the ball into the net. Ronaldo then provided the assist for Rooney's second, nutmegging an Aston Villa defender to play Rooney in. Heartened by his first goal in six games, Rooney finished the move with a cool shot, beating Carson on his near post. Rooney almost made it a hat-trick a few minutes later, but he was deemed to be marginally offside at the time of Owen Hargreaves' cross.|$|E
25|$|Australia {{came and}} conquered in 1954–1955. After the Aussies made 515 {{in the first}} innings of the first Test, the Windies went down by 9 wickets. Then the Windies 382 was put in the shade by 600 for 9 {{declared}} by the visitors as the second Test was drawn. A low-scoring third Test saw Australia (257 and 133 for 2) beat the hosts (182 and 207) by 8 wickets. After Australia scored 668 in the fourth Test, the series was lost, although a double century from captain Denis Atkinson and a world-record stand for the seventh wicket allowed the Windies to reach 510 and draw the Test. The fifth Test saw the West Indies win the toss and bat. Walcott's 155 was the highest score of their 357. The Australians then batted and batted, in total for 245.4 overs in the 6-day Test, <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>put</b> on 758 for 8 declared, with five players making centuries. 319 in the West Indies' second innings left them defeated by an innings and 82 runs in the Test, and by three games to nil in the series. Walcott set records by scoring five hundreds, and hundreds in both innings of a match twice. A four-Test tour of New Zealand followed in February 1956. After two wins by an innings and one by 9 wickets, the Windies were surprised by the Kiwis in the fourth, dismissing them for 145 and 77 as they recorded their first ever Test win in their 45th Test.|$|E

Will is rescued by Brenner and Lin of Rubinelle's 12th Battalion (nicknamed [...] "Brenner's Wolves"), and takes on the group's cause of saving as many survivors of the meteor strikes as possible. During a search, Will discovers a mysterious amnesiac who does not remember her own name, but somehow knows detailed military information. Will later names her Isabella, and she becomes {{a vital part of the}} battalion <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>put</b> an end to the Beast's reign of terror.|$|E
500|$|In April 1953 Thomas {{returned}} {{alone for}} a third tour of America. He performed a [...] "work in progress" [...] version of Under Milk Wood, solo, {{for the first time}} at Harvard University on 3 May. A week later the work was performed with a full cast at the Poetry Centre in New York. He met the deadline only after being locked in a room by Brinnin's assistant, Liz Reitell, and was still editing the script on the afternoon of the performance; its last lines were handed to the actors <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>put</b> on their makeup. In the wake of the play's US success, the composer Stravinsky invited Thomas to write a libretto for an opera. Thomas spent the last nine or ten days of his third tour in New York mostly in the company of Reitell, with whom he had an affair. During this time Thomas fractured his arm falling down a flight of stairs when drunk. Reitell's doctor, Milton Feltenstein, put his arm in plaster and treated him for gout and gastritis.|$|E
