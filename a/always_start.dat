5|$|We <b>always</b> <b>start</b> {{out with}} a musical idea. Great effort goes into {{creating}} a solid melodic core. We both play the keyboards and program, but in general Mikkel plays the instruments and controls Pro Tools, while Tor has the executive overlook as well as lyrical input. However, we both are hands on and have no rules or limitations. When we have some killer beats and musical starting points, we hook {{up with one of}} our favorite topline writers, who gets cracking on the lyrics and melody. We make sure there's a lot of melody in the track, so it can inspire the writer. Together with the topline writer we work, often tweek and simplify the song, and never quit before we feel we've got a killer hook.|$|E
25|$|The {{menopause}} transition typically begins between 40 and 50 {{years of}} age (average 47.5). The duration of perimenopause may be for up to eight years.

25|$|At {{the one to}} go signal, {{the pace}} car will turn its lights off. At this point, any car that is ahead of {{the leader of the}} race will be waved around {{to the rear of the}} field. These cars are not {{permitted}} to pit until after the green flag comes back out and the race has resumed. The field will then line up double file for the restart. The leader of the race gets lane choice, but the third place car (and odd positions on back) will <b>always</b> <b>start</b> in the inside line, while the fourth place car (and even positions on back) will <b>always</b> <b>start</b> in the outside lane. The restart order is always this: Lead Lap Cars > Cars 1 or more laps down > Free Pass Car > Wave Arounds > Cars who have received a penalty.|$|E

25|$|For example, {{suppose we}} wish to sample people from a long street that starts in a poor area (house No. 1) and ends in an {{expensive}} district (house No. 1000). A simple random selection of addresses from this street could easily end up with too many from the high end and too few from the low end (or vice versa), leading to an unrepresentative sample. Selecting (e.g.) every 10th street number along the street ensures that the sample is spread evenly {{along the length of}} the street, representing all of these districts. (Note that if we <b>always</b> <b>start</b> at house #1 and end at #991, the sample is slightly biased towards the low end; by randomly selecting the start between #1 and #10, this bias is eliminated.|$|E
25|$|Secondary hemiepiphytes start life on {{the ground}} or on part of a tree trunk very close to the ground, where the seeds sprout. These philodendrons have their roots in the ground early in their lives. They then begin {{climbing}} up a tree and eventually may become completely epithytic, doing away with their subterranean roots. Secondary hemiepiphytes do not <b>always</b> <b>start</b> their lives close to a tree. For these philodendrons, the plant will grow with long internodes along the ground until a tree is found. They find a suitable tree by growing towards darker areas, such as the dark shadow of a tree. This trait is called scototropism. After a tree has been found, the scototropic behavior stops and the philodendron switches to a phototropic growth habit and the internodes shorten and thicken. Usually, however, philodendrons germinate on trees.|$|E

500|$|The British Film Institute's screenonline guide {{called the}} film [...] "one of the series' high points" [...] {{and said it}} [...] "had {{advantages}} not enjoyed by many later Bond films, notably an intelligent script that retained the substance of Ian Fleming's novel while toning down the overt Cold War politics (the Cuban Missile Crisis had only occurred the previous year)." [...] In 2008, Michael G. Wilson, the current co-producer of the series, stated [...] "We <b>always</b> <b>start</b> out trying to make another From Russia with Love and end up with another Thunderball." [...] Sean Connery, Michael G. Wilson, Barbara Broccoli, Timothy Dalton and Daniel Craig also consider this their favourite Bond film. Albert Broccoli listed it with Goldfinger and The Spy Who Loved Me {{as one of his}} top three favourites, explaining that he felt [...] "it was with this film that the Bond style and formula were perfected".|$|E
500|$|Almost a {{year later}} in October 1955, he declared: [...] "Am passed 650 pages in the book.

By {{the end of the}} book you are a master but if you {{commence}} as master in writing anyway, you end as a bloody bore." [...] Two months later, Hemingway was bedridden with kidney disease. By January 1956, he acknowledged, in a letter written on the second anniversary of the accidents, [...] he was having trouble remembering the trip. [...] In 1956, Hemingway agreed to work on the filming of The Old Man and the Sea and abandoned work on the Africa book. [...] He wrote to his editor, [...] "I found it impossible to resume writing on the Africa book." [...] Hemingway put the manuscript in a safe-deposit box in Havana, although after the 1959 [...] Cuban revolution he feared the manuscript lost.|$|E
500|$|While {{searching for}} investors, Nagy and Berwin {{learned that the}} {{homosexuality}} of the characters was not {{as much of an}} obstacle for securing financing as {{the fact that they were}} women. [...] "Having two women leads was the issue," [...] Nagy noted. In 2015, Berwin said that, in those days, it was a risky idea to play the role of Carol. [...] "As a project it came together with Cate Blanchett. You needed to <b>always</b> <b>start</b> with her role". Film4 Productions and Tessa Ross financed the development of the film and kept it alive throughout the years, as it [...] "underwent a decade-plus of revision under various directors and investors" [...] − including Hettie MacDonald, Kenneth Branagh, Kimberly Peirce, John Maybury, and Stephen Frears − until the project completely stalled. The long trek was a result of the struggles and roadblocks experienced with funding, rights, and trepidations about a film with a gay theme and two female leads. [...] "During its development, there was a very different kind of lesbian or gay movie that got financed", Nagy said. [...] "They were very agenda or issue driven, and this was not. In fact it insists on not being that in order to make the point. I would talk about that with financiers, and I could see them glaze over." ...|$|E

500|$|La Dispute {{wrote and}} {{recorded}} Wildlife in pieces to accommodate their intense tour schedule. The album was recorded at two different studios with recording engineers Andrew Everding and Joe Pedulla. They {{started with the}} instrumentation of six tracks at Drasik Studios in Chicago; this recording process took place over two weeks. The songwriting featured on the album is distinct from La Dispute's previous releases. Dreyer wrote the stories or the concepts behind each song, and then the band adapted these stories into lyrics and created music to revolve around them. In an interview, Dreyer was asked how the songwriting differs; {{he said that the}} lyrics were written before the music was composed. He was quoted as saying: [...] "This time around, we switched the process up entirely. Previous to Wildlife, we'd <b>always</b> <b>start</b> music first and add vocals later based on the way the song felt. This time around, because we had a more concrete concept going into it, and because we wanted to work even more as a single unit [...] " [...] Dreyer and the rest of La Dispute had expressed interest in writing a conceptual record, but with ambiguity so it would not limit the listener's experience. [...] "Oftentimes, I think records with a linear narrative narrow the ways in which a person can enjoy it, and not everyone wants to sit down and listen to something front to back." [...] When they returned from their touring in Australia in February 2011 they [...] "dropped {{off the face of the}} earth" [...] for two months, during which their writing sessions lasted twelve to fourteen hours a day.|$|E
500|$|During {{the first}} season, the writing staff used {{most of the}} story ideas that were in Hillenburg's series bible and they had {{problems}} on how to generate new ideas. At one point, the writing staff went to the beach for inspiration for a possible episode. However, the day [...] "was overcast and cold, so we [...] {{had to stay in}} the car." [...] Drymon said [...] "We didn't come up with too many ideas that day." [...] Story editor Peter Burns left, and the crew had Merriwether Williams to overtake. Hillenburg said to Williams that [...] "it was her responsibility to get us [...] to come up with new ideas." [...] Drymon said [...] " [...] is a tall order." [...] Williams gave Drymon a book called Zen in the Art of Writing, written by Ray Bradbury, that catalogs a collection of essays about writing processes. One of the ways in the book to inspire plots was [...] "to write nouns that interested him [...] on a note card and hang them in his office. He felt just having the word in his eyesight would get his mind working." [...] Williams took this scheme and made it into [...] "a writing exercise." [...] In writing meetings, the staff would all enumerate 10 nouns on strips of paper and place them in a hat. The hat would be passed throughout and a writer would have a limited time to spawn an idea based on the noun he wrote. Drymon said [...] "It would almost <b>always</b> <b>start</b> a discussion, and we wound up getting a lot of episodes out of it." [...] Furthermore, Drymon said that Williams [...] "really came up with a great addition to the process." ...|$|E
