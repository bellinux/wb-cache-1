5000|$|Aristotle {{analyzed}} {{qualities in}} his logical work, the Categories. To him, qualities are hylomorphically-formal attributes, such as [...] "white" [...] or [...] "grammatical". Categories of state, such as [...] "shod" [...] and [...] "armed" [...] are also non-essential qualities (katà symbebekós). Aristotle observed: [...] "one and the selfsame substance, while retaining its identity, is yet capable of admitting contrary qualities. The same individual person is {{at one time}} white, <b>at</b> <b>another</b> black, <b>at</b> one time warm, <b>at</b> <b>another</b> cold, <b>at</b> one time good, <b>at</b> <b>another</b> bad. This capacity is found nowhere else... it is the peculiar mark of substance {{that it should be}} capable of admitting contrary qualities; for it is by itself changing that it does so". Aristotle described four types of qualitative opposites: correlatives, contraries, privatives and positives.|$|R
