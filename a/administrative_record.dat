25|$|The {{ruling was}} {{appealed to the}} U.S. Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit in Denver, Colorado. On August 17, 2006, the Appeals Court upheld the FDA's ban of ephedra alkaloids, finding that the 133,000 page <b>administrative</b> <b>record</b> {{compiled}} by the FDA supported the agency's finding that ephedra alkaloids posed an unreasonable risk to consumers. Nutraceutical Corp. filed a petition for a writ of certiorari seeking a rehearing on the ban of ephedra alkaloids; however, on May 14, 2007 the United States Supreme Court declined to hear this petition. The sale of ephedra alkaloids containing dietary supplements remains illegal in the United States. Sales of products containing ephedra extract not containing ephedrine remain legal.|$|E
25|$|The next {{document}} issued was a proposed rule dated June 17, 1994, which states, “FDA is issuing a notice of proposed rulemaking {{in the form}} of an amended tentative final monograph that would establish conditions under which OTC topical health-care antiseptic drug products are generally recognized as safe and effective and not misbranded. FDA is issuing this notice of proposed rulemaking on topical antimicrobial drug products after considering the public comments on that notice and other information in the <b>administrative</b> <b>record</b> for this rulemaking. FDA is also requesting data and information concerning the safety and effectiveness of topical antimicrobials for use as hand sanitizers or dips.” In the 1994 update to the rule, TCS was effectively removed from the drug category which made it available for use in consumer products.|$|E
40|$|Japanese {{official}} {{bodies have}} been maintaining {{a number of}} different kinds of <b>administrative</b> <b>records,</b> from which a number of statistics are produced and disseminated. On the other hand, statistical surveys including censuses have served as major sources for producing various official statistics that are not obtained by <b>administrative</b> <b>records</b> directly. However, recent changes in the survey environment such as increased difficulty in gaining the cooperation of the public for statistical surveys has resulted in the deterioration of the quality of statistics that were produced by such means. In this context, it becomes more and more important and effective to utilize <b>administrative</b> <b>records</b> for official statistics produced by statistical surveys, especially in light of maintaining and improving their quality as well as reducing the burden on respondents, though statistical surveys cannot simply be replaced by <b>administrative</b> <b>records.</b> This presentation will describe recent movements with regard to the use of <b>administrative</b> <b>records</b> in official statistics in Japan.

I put it plainly to you to consider, whether one is not {{justified}} in saying that we occupy a position of unexampled strength at the present time. The Government is strong in its <b>administrative</b> <b>record,</b> which reveals no single serious or striking mistake in all the complicated conduct of affairs. There have been no regrettable incidents by land or sea and none of those personal conflicts between the high officials that used to occur so frequently under a late dispensation. We have had no waste of public treasure and no bloodshed. We are strong in the consciousness of a persistent effort to sweep away anomalies and inequalities, to redress injustice, to open more widely to the masses of the people the good chances in life, and to safeguard them against its evil chances. We also claim that we are strong in the support and enthusiasm of a majority of our fellow-countrymen. We are strong in the triumph of our policy in South Africa; most of all we are strong in the hopes and plans which we have formed for the future.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background To {{understand}} {{racial and}} ethnic disparities in health care utilization and their potential underlying causes, valid information on race and ethnicity is necessary. However, the validity of pediatric race and ethnicity information in <b>administrative</b> <b>records</b> from large integrated health care systems using electronic medical records is largely unknown. Methods Information on race and ethnicity of 325, 810 children born between 1998 - 2008 was extracted from health plan <b>administrative</b> <b>records</b> and compared to birth certificate records. Positive predictive values (PPV) were calculated for correct classification {{of race and ethnicity}} in <b>administrative</b> <b>records</b> compared to birth certificate records. Results Misclassification of ethnicity and race in <b>administrative</b> <b>records</b> occurred in 23. 1 % and 33. 6 % children, respectively; the majority due to missing ethnicity (48. 3 %) and race (40. 9 %) information. Misclassification was most common in children of minority groups. PPV for White, Black, Asian/Pacific Islander, American Indian/Alaskan Native, multiple and other was 89. 3 %, 86. 6 %, 73. 8 %, 18. 2 %, 51. 8 % and 1. 2 %, respectively. PPV for Hispanic ethnicity was 95. 6 %. Racial and ethnic information improved with increasing number of medical visits. Subgroup analyses comparing racial classification between non-Hispanics and Hispanics showed White, Black and Asian race was more accurate among non-Hispanics than Hispanics. Conclusions In children, race and ethnicity information from <b>administrative</b> <b>records</b> has significant limitations in accurately identifying small minority groups. These results suggest that the quality of racial information obtained from <b>administrative</b> <b>records</b> may benefit from additional supplementation by birth certificate data. </p...|$|R

He rejected the parent's claim that the discrepancy demonstrated a need to validate all information in the <b>administrative</b> <b>record.</b> However, the judge agreed that the notices required further review.

Previously, when a NRFU enumerator was unable to contact residents at an address, he/she found a knowledgeable person, such as a neighbor or apartment manager, who could provide the census information for the residents. This was called a proxy response. The Census Bureau’s recent advances in merging federal and third-party databases raise the question: Are proxy responses for NRFU addresses more accurate than the <b>administrative</b> <b>records</b> available for the housing unit?
