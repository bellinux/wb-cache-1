40|$|Many migratory herbivores seem {{to follow}} the flush of plant growth during {{migration}} in order to acquire the most nutrient-rich plants. This has also been hypothesized for arctic-breeding geese, but so far no test of this so-called green wave hypothesis has been performed at the individual level. During four years, a total of 30 greater white-fronted geese <b>Anser</b> <b>albifrons</b> <b>albifrons</b> was tracked using GPS transmitters, of which 13 yielded complete spring migration tracks. From those birds we defined stopover sites and related the date of arrival at each of these stopovers to temperature sum (growing degree days, GDD), snow cover, accumulated photoperiod and latitude. We found that geese arrived at spring stopovers close to the peak in GDD jerk; the ‘jerk’ is the third derivative, or {{the rate of change}} in acceleration, and GDD jerk maxima therefore represent the highest acceleration of daily temperature per site. Day of snow melt also correlated well with the observed arrival of the geese. Factors not closely related to onset of spring, i. e. accumulated photoperiod and latitude, yielded poorer fits. A comparison with published data revealed that the GDD jerk occurs 1 – 2 weeks earlier than the onset of spring derived from NDVI, and probably represents the very start of spring growth. Our data therefore suggest that white-fronted geese track the front of the green wave in sprin...|$|E
40|$|Recent {{outbreaks}} of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) in poultry have raised {{interest in the}} interplay between avian influenza (AI) viruses and their wild hosts. Studies linking virus ecology to host ecology are still scarce, particularly for non-duck species. Here, we link capture-resighting data of greater white-fronted geese <b>Anser</b> <b>albifrons</b> <b>albifrons</b> with the AI virus infection data collected during capture in The Netherlands in four consecutive winters. We ask what factors are related to AI virus prevalence and whether there are ecological consequences associated with AI virus infection in staging white-fronted geese. Mean seasonal (low pathogenic) AI virus prevalence ranged between 2. 5 and 10. 7 per cent, among the highest reported values for non-duck species, and occurred in distinct peaks with near-zero prevalence before and after. Throat samples had a 2. 4 times higher detection frequency than cloacal samples. AI virus infection {{was significantly related to}} age and body mass in some but not other winters. AI virus infection was not related to resighting probability, nor to maximum distance travelled, which was at least 191 km during the short infectious lifespan of an AI virus. Our results suggest that transmission via the respiratory route could be an important transmission route of AI virus in this species. Nearzero prevalence upon arrival on their wintering grounds, in combination with the epidemic nature of AI virus infections in white-fronted geese, suggests that white-fronted geese are not likely to disperse Asian AI viruses from their Siberian breeding grounds to their European wintering areas...|$|E

40|$|The {{historic}} holotypic {{description of}} Alexander von Humboldt for the primate Simia <b>albifrons</b> contains obvious errors which have created various taxonomic problems, {{since it has}} been impossible to compare descriptions of subspecies with an original holotype, which was never preserved. An historic taxonomic error was the recognition of Cebus <b>albifrons</b> unicolor as a different taxon from Cebus <b>albifrons</b> <b>albifrons,</b> which we correct in this paper by the recognition of Cebus <b>albifrons</b> unicolor as a synonym for Cebus <b>albifrons</b> <b>albifrons.</b> We describe Cebus <b>albifrons</b> <b>albifrons</b> for the first time, based on a neotype collected by us close to the type locality. Additionally, confusions about the type locality are discussed and clarified. Maypures is established as the correct type locality. General information on the geographic distribution and natural history of the species and subspecies is also provided...|$|R
25|$|Defler and Fernandez {{established}} a phenotype from {{the population that}} was called Cebu <b>albifrons</b> <b>albifrons</b> by Hernández C. and Cooper. Another problem {{has been that the}} taxon C. a. unicolor described by Spix (1823) and further defined by Hershkovitz was indistinguishable from C. a. albinos; the two are synonymous.|$|R
40|$|Uncertainty in the {{location}} of in situ wildlife observations may impair the performance of habitat models based on those observations. In this thesis, I explore the effects of location uncertainty on inference in species-habitat models using a simulation approach to propagate uncertainty in habitat models and quantify its effects. Using a point survey of overwintering migratory birds at Poyang Lake, China, I applied Monte Carlo methods to characterize the uncertainty that results when the observer locations and species abundances are known, but the specific directions and distances of the observations (i. e. the specific location of the observed landscape) are unknown. Habitat models of a tuber-feeding swan (tundra swan; Cygnus columbianus) indicated that the abundance of this species increased {{with the amount of}} shallow water, a land-cover class likely to contain submerged aquatic vegetation communities; and that of a grazing goose (white-fronted goose; <b>Anser</b> <b>albifrons</b> <b>albifrons)</b> increased with the amount of sparse live wetland vegetation, a land-cover class found in the transition space between mudflats and perennial wetland vegetation. The incorporation of location uncertainty into the habitat models of tundra swans produced uncertainties in the inferred relationship to shallow water, as indicated by changes from positive to negative parameter coefficient estimates, in 15 % of simulated models while the relationship between white-fronted goose abundance and sparse live wetland vegetation was positive for 98 % of model runs. The causes of these changes in inference were highly dependent on landscape configurations and therefore difficult to predict or generalize. I found that fixed-radius models (i. e., models constructed assuming that the observed area was a uniform-sized circular area around each sample point) were consistent in terms of direction of effects with the simulation results but should be used with caution when interpreting the strength of the species-habitat relationship from these models due to high variability resulting from observation uncertainty...|$|E
25|$|Cebus <b>albifrons</b> <b>albifrons</b> is {{very common}} in {{the eastern half of}} El Tuparro National Park, Colombia. It is less common in Amacayacu National Park.

25|$|Cebus <b>albifrons</b> <b>albifrons</b> {{is found}} in eastern Vichada, close to the type locality, and was defined by von Humboldt using a tame animal {{maintained}} by humans (and a pig) {{in the village of}} Maipures. The original description of von Humboldt described an ashy gray animal with a black tail tip, characteristics that are not typical of any known population of C. <b>albifrons.</b> The C. <b>albifrons</b> located three kilometers to the north of Maipures are very light colored animals with yellowish or reddish tones, very similar to the population of Arauca. Cebus a. unicolor is also very light colored with yellowish tones and it seems clear that it is a synonym of C. a. <b>albifrons.</b> One population of very pallid coloration {{is found in}} Arauca, the northern part of Boyacá and the eastern part of Norte de Santander and probably represents C. a. <b>albifrons.</b>|$|R
