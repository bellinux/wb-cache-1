With regards to the time limit, the race is being scored <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>is</b> also counting while the safety car is on the track, and the race resumes.|$|E
25|$|Arthāpatti (अर्थापत्ति), postulation, {{derivation}} from circumstances. In contemporary logic, this pramana {{is similar}} to circumstantial implication. As example, if a person left in a boat on river earlier, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>is</b> now past the expected time of arrival, then the circumstances support the truth postulate that the person has arrived. Many Indian scholars considered this Pramana as invalid or at best weak, because the boat may have gotten delayed or diverted. However, in cases such as deriving the time of a future sunrise or sunset, this method was asserted by the proponents to be reliable.|$|E
500|$|Widney {{supported}} {{dividing the}} state of California and establishing the commonwealth of Southern California. He was regarded as [...] "one of the ablest and most enthusiastic advocates of the new 'California of the South'". For many years Widney advocated the division of {{the state of}} California into at least two states, in order to maximize its representation in the U.S. Senate. He indicated in 1880 that [...] "the topography, geography, climatic and commercial laws all work for the separation of California into two distinct civil organizations". In 1888, Widney said that [...] "two distinct peoples are growing up in the state, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>is</b> rapidly drawing near when the separation which the working of natural laws is making in the people must become a separation of civil laws as well".|$|E

2500|$|The game {{begins in}} Little Italy in 1936. Johnny Trapani (voiced by Adam Harrington), a modest ranking {{member of the}} Corleone family, is meeting his wife, Sarafina (Sirenetta Leoni), when their bakery explodes. Trapani is then beaten up and killed {{by members of the}} Barzini family, with Emilio Barzini (Michael Kopsa) telling him [...] "sorry Johnny, it's just business." [...] Moments later, Trapani's son Aldo (Andrew Pifko) arrives, and is consoled by Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando/Doug Abrahams), who tells him that when he is old enough <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>is</b> right, he will have his revenge.|$|E
2500|$|On January 11, 1857 Heber C. Kimball, {{a member}} of the First Presidency, spoke about the adulterers within the church and warned that [...] "hey are worthy of death, and they will get it. That time is near by, and God has spoken from the heavens, and when certain things are about right, we shall make a public example of those characters, ...<b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>is</b> just at our doors." [...] In the meantime, rather than atoning for sins with blood, Kimball taught that it was {{possible}} to at least partially atone for sins by means other than blood, and encouraged covenant breakers to [...] "pay all you can, that there may not be much against you when the accounts are settled up." ...|$|E
2500|$|Another {{factor is}} also, that, for example {{decision-makers}} in government offices and upper echelons {{are not allowed}} to show weaknesses or signs of disease etc., because this would immediately lead to doubts of the ability for further responsibility. Only 20% of managers (e.g. in Germany) do sports regularly and also only 2% keep regularly preventive medical check-up. In such a position other priorities seem to be set <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>is</b> lacking for regular sports. Frightening is that the job has such a high priority, that people waive screening as a sign of weakness. In contrast to that, the burnout syndrome seems to be gaining popularity. There seems nothing to be ashamed to show weaknesses, but quite the opposite: The burnout is part of a successful career like a home for the role model family. Besides that the statement which describes the burnout as a [...] "socially recognized precious version of the depression and despair that lets also at the moment of failure the self-image intact" [...] fits and therefore concludes [...] "Only losers become depressed, burnout against it is a diagnosis for winners, more precisely, for former winners.".|$|E
