40|$|Methotrexate (MTX) is an <b>antifolic</b> drug {{used in the}} {{treatment}} of immune-mediated and neoplastic diseases. Initiation or dosage changes in MTX therapy can cause mucositis and bone marrow suppression. Skin lesions due to acute MTX toxicity are rare, but they serve as a herald for later-onset pancytopenia. Therefore, identification of those cutaneous lesions might help to initiate rescue strategies at an early stage. Here we describe a case with mucocutaneous ulcerations and pancytopenia due to overdosed MTX...|$|E
40|$|We {{report on}} an {{extension}} of our previous discovery of in vitro anticancer activity of trifluoromethylquinoxalines as analogues of classical and non-classical <b>antifolic</b> methotrexate and trimetrexate. In this case {{a small number of}} Schiff bases were obtained from the reaction of 2 -bromethyl- 3 - R - 6 (7) trifluoromethylquinoxaline and ethyl p-aminobenzoylglutamate, ethyl p-aminobenzoate, p -toluidine instead of the expected 4 -[2 -quinoxalyl]methyl-N-methylanilino derivatives, which in turn formed with N-methylanilino derivatives. The reaction mechanism has been put forward. Structure elucidation of both Schiff bases and N-methylanilino analogues was achieved by a combination of 1 H and 13 C NMR spectra and hetcor experiments. Compounds 3 a, 3 b, 3 c, 8, 11, 12, 13, Ie were tested in <b>antifolic</b> enzyme assay [Lactobacillus casei (LcTS), Leishmania major (LmTs), human Thymidylate synthase (hTs), human TS, human dihydrofolate reductase (hDHFR) ] while compounds 3 a, 3 b, 3 c were tested for anticancer activity. These results seem to indicate that the Schiff bases are somewhat active either as anticancer or as folate inhibitors, while compound Ie was selectively active against hDHFR with an inhibition constant (Ki) of 200 nM with a specificity of about 1000 -folds with respect to hTS...|$|E
40|$|Methods {{of testing}} {{competitive}} antagonism in bacterial systems are considered and evaluated with particular reference to <b>antifolic</b> acids. Four <b>antifolic</b> acids—pteridine O/ 129, methotrexate, CB 2295 and CB 2335 —were examined for competitiveness and potency in three test systems—Leuc. citrovorum and folinic acid, Str. faecalis and folinic acid, and Str. faecalis and pteroylglutamic acid. For comparison, phenol and formaldehyde were {{studied in the}} Leuc. citrovorum and folinic acid system. Interpretation of results was based on families of log. concentration/growth curves obtained in each system in the presence and absence of each antagonist. These curves were usually simple sigmoids. From these families of curves, pA values were derived and reciprocal growth/reciprocal concentration curves were drawn. Pteridine O/ 129 was fully competitive in all systems, while methotrexate was fully competitive in the Str. faecalis and folinic acid system, but did not give simple sigmoids {{in the other two}} systems. CB 2295 showed some competitive features in all and CB 2335 in the two systems in which it was active. It is concluded that the methods adopted, based on those used in vertebrate pharmacology, provide a stringent test of competitiveness in bacterial systems...|$|E

40|$|For the {{treatment}} of malaria, combinations of drugs with <b>antifolic</b> action have the great advantage, compared with other drug associations, of synergic action, which increases {{the effectiveness of the}} preparation, limits its toxicity, and reduces the risk of resistance. The associations of a sulfonamide (sulfalene, S) with a diaminopyrimidine derivative (pyrimethamine, P, or trimethoprim, T) have given good immediate clinical results. An analysis of the pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic characteristics of the three components explains the relative ease with which relapse is encountered with the association ST.

40|$|Twenty eight pyrrolo[1, 2 -a]quinoxalines bearing at {{position}} 4 various substituents {{related to the}} moieties present in classical and non classical <b>antifolic</b> agents were prepared and evaluated in vitro for antiproliferative activity.

40|$|A {{strain of}} Streptococcus faecium (ATCC 8043) which is highly {{resistant}} to the <b>antifolic</b> acid compound, amethopterin, was gently ruptured by exposing protoplasts of the organism to a hypotonic solution. The crude lysate resulting there-from was treated by various chemical and physical techniques designed to separate folic acid reductase from dihydrofolic acid reductase. In the process, the enzyme was purified approximately 160 -fold; however, throughout the process, the enzyme preparation maintained the ability to reduce folic acid to tetrahydrofolic acid. Attempts to isolate mutants showing a deficiency in either folic acid reductase or dihydrofolic acid reductase were unsuccessful. Based on these results, it is concluded that folic acid is reduced to tetrahydrofolic acid by one enzyme in S. faecium (ATCC 8043). The crude lysate was also subjected to ultracentrifugation.

40|$|Both {{sulfamethoxazole}} and trimethoprim exhibit physiologic-disposition charac-teristics which follow {{first order}} kinetics, whether {{the drugs are}} administered separately or in combination, in single or in multiple dosing regimens. Based on single-dose data, successful predictions of plateau levels in blood for each sub-ject were obtained for both drugs. This finding substantiates the constancy of absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion of the drugs with each admin-istration of the combination. Trimethoprim (TMP), an <b>antifolic</b> agent, poten-tiates the. activity of sulfamethoxazole (SMZ) against {{a wide variety of}} bacterial species [1, 2].

40|$|Eucaryotic and procaryotic organisms {{differ in}} {{two aspects of}} their {{translation}} machinery: polycistronic messengers are expressed as a sequence of individual proteins only in procaryotes, and the initiation of protein synthesis proceeds with an initiator tRNA which {{is found to be}} modified (formylated) in procaryotes and not in eucaryotes. In the present study, we show that formylation is required in vivo for the coordinate expression of the Escherichia coli lactose operon. Our experiments are consistent with a translation mechanism using dissociated ribosomes at the 5 ' end of the mRNA in a reaction that is only weakly dependent on formylation at this initiation step; the ribosomes then travel along the messenger and can reinitiate after the intracistronic barrier without dissociation. This latter initiation step is strongly dependent on the level of formylation: a low level of the formyl group, obtained by the <b>antifolic</b> agent trimethoprim, induces a strong polarity in the expression of the lactose operon. There exist mutant strains in which this polarity is much less apparent than in the wild type. We show here that such is the case of rpsL mutants. Ribosomes mutated in the S 12 protein (rpsL) are found to be much more easily dissociated than the wild type. This might explain why the expression of the lactose operon on rpsL strains remains coordinated when the intracellular level of formylation is decreased...|$|E
40|$|Sublethal {{effects of}} {{trimethoprim}} (TMP) were evaluated in four freshwater organisms: Pseudokirchneriella subcapitata and Lemna minor (growth inhibition), Daphnia magna (reproduction and growth inhibition) and Poecilia reticulata (swimming activity inhibition). Cytochrome P 4501 A induction was also evaluated in P. reticulata. TMP showed {{varying levels of}} toxicity in the four test performed, with NOEC for the various endpoints {{in the range of}} 3. 12 – 25 mg L− 1. The compound was active on P. reticulata at concentration ≥ 50 mg L− 1 causing inhibition of swimming activity. In the same organism an induction of CYP 1 A protein, mainly in kidney, gills and intestine, was also detected. L. minor was more sensitive than unicellular algae to TMP, with a NOEC of 12. 5 mg L− 1. The lowest NOEC (3. 12 mg L− 1) was obtained in D. magna reproduction test and then a Risk Quotient of < 0. 03 was calculated by comparing the PNEC (31. 2 μg L) and the TMP concentrations usually detected in freshwater (< 1 μg L− 1). However, based on recently reported data, it was concluded that while TMP concentrations normally detected in surface water are below those able to evoke appreciable biological effects in the various aquatic organisms, TMP concentrations in aquaculture and hospital effluents can be one to three orders of magnitude higher.

At 37 C incubation, the organism was found to have a lag time of 10. 5 hr and a mean generation time thereafter of 4. 85 hr for binary multiplication during the exponential phase of growth. At 34 C, the lag time was 12 hr and generation time was 5. 26 hr. When the organisms were incubated at 31 C, the lag time was 12. 5 hr and generation time was 11. 1 hr. Treatment of infected monkey kidney tissue cultures with 0. 05 mg per 100 ml of pyrimethamine at 37 C for 4 days killed all organisms and permitted survival of the mice which were injected with the cultures. When cultures were incubated at 34 C, a dose of 0. 6 mg per 100 ml was required to spare any mice, and with a 31 C incubation even this dose was only slightly effective when therapy was continued for 4 days. If the treatment was prolonged for 7 days before injection of the cultures into mice, however, no difference in therapy with different rates of multiplication was found. Since the rates of multiplication at 34 and 31 C are similar to the rates of multiplication of some naturally occurring strains, these data confirm the fact that prolonged therapy, as used by many, is rational...|$|E

As Forkner * notes in his monograph a hundred years later, "We know almost nothing about its cause or its specific treatment.,, Potassium arsenite, radiation and benzol were known by 1915 to produce marked clinical remissions in myelocytic leukemia. During the past four years, three additional agents—ethyl carbamate, the amine mustards, and perhaps the <b>antifolic</b> acid compounds—have been reported to effect distinct clinical improvement in the course of the disease. 2 Adequate analyses of the final results of such therapy, in terms of longevity of patients with myelocytic leukemia, are extremely limited and all deal with radiation therapy. 3 ' * • 5 » 6 > 7 » 8 ' 9 ' 10 'u The first and still the best of such presentations is the classic paper published in 1924 by Minot, Buck-man and Isaacs. 3 No satisfactory detailed data are available in the literature regarding final results with the older chemical agents, and insufficient time has elapsed to evaluate the results with the newer agents. The present report summarizes the pertinent statistical data available on the subject of incidence, distribution and fatality of individuals with myelocytic leukemia, in order to provide a foundation for comparisons be-tween previous results achieved in the disease and information that will eventually be available with newer agents.

The {{sensitivity of the}} spectrophotofluorometric detector used allows direct evaluation of basal concentrations of the compound in plasma. Because it is resolved from the other common folates and from methotrexate, the procedure is suitable for monitoring it in plasma of patients receiving high-dose therapy with methotrexate. AddItIonal Keyphrases: monitoring therapy. cancer folate Methotrexate in high doses, with 5 -ITHF “rescue, ” has been used clinically for several years in the treatment for various cancers (1 - 5). 3 Recently, a “rescue ” effect on {{the side effects of}} HDMT in tumor treatment has been also demonstrated with 5 -MTHF, the predominant circulating form of folate (6 - 8), in experimental animals (9 - 11) and man (12, 13). As compared with 5 -fTHF, 5 -MTHF was found to be more ef-fective, and less toxic, in Walker 256 carcinosarcoma-bearing rats and in CDF/ 1 mice with leukemia L 1210 (11). The life span in CDF/ 1 mice with MTX-treated lymphatic leukemia was also more prolonged after 5 -MTHF than after 5 -tTHF (11). In man, the protection against MTX toxic effects af-forded by 5 -MTHF was demonstrated in various malignant neoplasms (12, 13), and it exceeded that obtained by 5 -fTHF (12). An adequate concentration of 5 -MTHF in the blood is re-quired in the first phase of “rescue, ” to inhibit entry of the <b>antifolic</b> agent into the cell. For monitoring 5 -MTHF in plasma in the presence of MTX or other folates, we describe a simple HPLC method, which allows evaluation even of the basal concentrations normally present in plasma.

40|$|The {{problem of}} the {{presence}} of pharmaceuticals in the environment and of their possible effects on ecosystems has been evidenced only in the last two decades, thanks to the progresses in analytical chemistry, and also to the progressive refinement of toxicological bioassays, leading to the detection of more subtle effects of pharmaceuticals on model organisms. In the last decade, progresses have been made also from the legislative point of view, introducing the duty of accurate evaluation of environmental impact for all newly commercialized drugs. Nevertheless, there is still a lack of knowledge about the environmental effects of pharmaceuticals. In the veterinary field, there are particular concerns about the environmental impact of livestock mass treatments (prophylactic/metaphylactic) which are administered for some days, at full dose and to a wide number of animals. Consequently, large quantities of active substances are released into the environment. Aim of this thesis, presented as a collection paper, was the evaluation of some sublethal effects of antibacterials, employed in mass treatments, on freshwater organisms. This in order to obtain a more in depth picture of the risks they could pose to the aquatic environment. The sensitivity of Daphnia curvirostris and Daphnia magna toward 10 antibacterials [enrofloxacin (EFX), ciprofloxacin(CPX), sulfaguanidine (SGD), sulfadiazine (SDZ), sulfamethazine (SMZ), sulfaquinoxaline (SQO), sulfaclozine (SCZ), sulfamerazine (SMA), sulfadimethoxine (SDM) and trimethoprim (TMP) ] and some of their binary mixtures, was compared. Furthermore, a tentative prolonged-toxicity test (lasting 13 days) was settled up in order to evidence toxic responses with drug concentrations that were uneffective in the classic 48 h immobilization test. Results showed that D. curvirostris was more sensitive than D. magna to the majority of compounds (7 out of 10). Lowest 48 h EC 50 s were obtained with EFX (4. 3 mg L- 1 in D. curvirostris) and SGD (6. 2 mg L- 1 in D. magna). The toxicity of paired compounds was always additive or less than additive. In the prolonged-toxicity test mortality and/or reproduction inhibition were constantly observed. It was concluded that: (1) D. curvirostris could be a suitable model for the evaluation of acute toxicity of antibacterials; (2) the toxicity of EFX and SGD should be given special attention (3) the concentration addition is usually a reasonable worst case estimation of the environmental impact of antibacterial mixtures. Some veterinary antibacterials which may contaminate the aquatic environment due to their use in livestock and/or aquaculture mass treatments were evaluated for their effects on swimming activity in D. magna (primary consumer) and Poecilia reticulata (secondary consumer). Results showed that the chosen endpoint may call to the attention of ecotoxicology some compounds otherwise negligible, based on lethality test. Sublethal effects of TMP were then evaluated in four freshwater organisms: Pseudokirchneriella subcapitata and Lemna minor (growth inhibition), D. magna (reproduction and growth inhibition) and P. reticulata (swimming activity inhibition). TMP showed varying levels of toxicity in the four test performed, with NOEC for the various endpoints in the range of 3. 12 to 25 mg L- 1. The compound was active on P. reticulata at concentration ≥ 50 mg L- 1 causing inhibition of swimming activity. L. minor was more sensitive than unicellular algae to TMP, with a NOEC of 12. 5 mg L- 1. The lowest NOEC (3. 12 mg L- 1) was obtained in D. magna reproduction test and then a Risk Quotient of < 0. 03 was calculated by comparing the PNEC (31. 2 μg L- 1) and the TMP concentrations usually detected in freshwater (< 1 μg L- 1). It was concluded that while TMP concentrations normally detected in surface water are below those able to evoke appreciable biological effects in the various aquatic organisms, TMP concentrations in aquaculture and hospital effluents can be one to three orders of magnitude higher. Furthermore, the co-occurrence and additive effects of other <b>antifolic</b> agents should be taken into account for a cautious risk assessment of the drug. 2 Multigenerational tests on D. magna were performed exposing two subsequent generation of the crustacean to EFX, his metabolite CPX and TMP. In F 1 with respect to F 0, both for growth and reproduction, a worsening trend of the response with EFX, a similar response with CPX and an attenuating trend with TMP was observed. Furthermore, the lowest EC 20 for reproduction inhibition (1. 27 mg L- 1) was calculated for F 1 exposed to EFX. However, other experimentations, longer and more complex, are necessary in order to confirm that EFX is more hazardous to daphnids than CPX and TMP. EC 50 s measured for the three assayed antibacterials were in the 6. 49 - 36. 53 mg L- 1 range and therefore environmental unrealistic, except in case of exceptional contaminations that may occur in relation to poorly controlled wastewaters from pharmaceutical factories or excessive use of prophylactic treatments in aquacultur...|$|E
