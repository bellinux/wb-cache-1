Life in Nunavut, however, remains circumscribed by adversities: poverty, crowded houses, and long winters. Both government and industry are constrained by inexperienced administration and insufficient budgets. Perhaps no sector is as challenged as the construction industry, caught between the vast demand of a housing crisis and the extreme cost of importing labor. The territory must invest in building skills {{to reduce the cost}} of housing. Trades training in the Eastern Arctic will have political, cultural, and economic significance for a community long dependent on remote governments and migrant workers. Moreover, local tradesmen will be indispensable to an affordable construction strategy for community buildings serving a population expanding at twice the national rate. Over the course of fifty years of permanent settlement in Nunavut, no construction system has yet been devised for civic spaces that respond to its social, physical, and logistical conditions. by Sarah Katherine Roszler.

40|$|When Canada {{signed the}} Nunavut Land Claims Agreement in 1993, it {{committed}} {{to create a}} new territory, Nunavut, as an Inuit homeland in the Canadian Eastern Arctic. Parliament fulfilled this promise {{with the passage of the}} Nunavut Act, and the new territory came into existence on April 1, 1999. Still, the Government of Nunavut remains a creature of statute and has only such powers as Parliament has devolved to it. To date, these devolved powers do not include jurisdiction over lands and resources. Nunavut is the only place in Canada where Canadian citizens may not elect a sub-national legislature empowered to make fundamental decisions about the land beneath their feet. This Article explores the impact of this citizenship gap on indigenous rights in Nunavut and on Canada 2 ̆ 7 s security posture in the Arctic. As the sea ice melts and as much as a trillion dollars of oil and gas becomes profitably extractable, decisions about natural resources will become a focus not only of Canada’s domestic politics, but also of its international engagement. With a comparatively weak military presence in the <b>Arctic,</b> Canadian <b>sovereignty</b> has been borne out primarily in the form of permanent settlement, and the Inuit have played the part of “human flagpoles” in federal Northern policy. This Article argues that devolution, as a means to Inuit self-government, must occur in tandem with assertions of Canadian sovereignty in the Far North...|$|R
50|$|From initial {{colonization}} of Canada, {{a large portion}} of the Northern region has been left uninhabited. This is due to the cold climate making it impossible to grow crops or build infrastructure up to present day, as well as the relatively low population density in Southern Canada. As the Northern region continues to rapidly warm, there may be an increase in migration north, leading to infrastructure being put in place. A significant reason why CanNor has began to stake claims in the north is due to disputed claim to <b>sovereignty</b> in the <b>Arctic</b> Circle. In most cases, a country can assert claim to a landmass if there is a stable governance system within the area. Canada unquestionably holds sovereignty in all areas wherein Canadian citizens live, which includes Nunavut, the Yukon, and the Northwest Territories. A variable that has been contested towards claiming absolute sovereignty of the Northern area is that there needs to be a defined boundary. Although Canada has asserted a claim towards the majority of the Arctic, this claim has been debated by the international community and remains unclear. Due to the lack of infrastructure and citizens in the area, Canada does not have a definitive claim to the <b>Arctic</b> if Northern <b>sovereignty</b> were to be threatened by another country. Through the CanNor initiative, the Canadian Government is attempting to develop the region to combat this problem.|$|R

40|$|The Arctic used to mainly be of {{relevance}} to science. Now, increasingly, it {{is a matter}} of economic, political and legal interest. The Arctic is experiencing a profound transformation, driven largely by the interacting forces of climate change and globalization. The impact of climate change is difficult to predict with any precision, but it is certain that the demand for Arctic resources will continue to climb. Countries are preparing to defend their commercial and territorial interests in a region whose strategic significance will boom in the next decade. Natural and man-made change in the region will increasingly compel attention. Most significantly, climate change is challenging the notions of permanency and stability on which the ideal of the sovereign, territorial state has historically rested, gradually, literally uncovering an Arctic which stands at a crossroads of development and risk and of cooperation or discord. The question posed in this thesis was: To what degree are conflicting <b>Arctic</b> territorial <b>sovereignty</b> claims emerging as a potential security threat? The answer was attained via the following sub-questions: • Can territorial expansion be considered the prime source of disharmony in the Arctic? • What role does sovereignty play in the Arctic? • Does the combination of these two factors (territory and sovereignty) combine in such a way as to form a relevant security threat? An analysis method was designed and employed in order to discern whether disputes arising from territory and sovereignty issues were likely to develop into either security threats. Trends in the way of increased cooperation or conflict concerning border disputes among Arctic states hold substantial consequences for the balance of power in the region, affecting patterns of innovation in governance in the Arctic today and shedding light on the Arctic of tomorrow. The results attained through the analysis of case studies provide a solid basis from which to hypothesize on how governance of the Arctic could evolve. The Arctic is a source of inspiration for legal innovation, as testified by the legal status of the Arctic as a terra sui generis. The option given in this thesis is an example of a creative solution which states may employ in order to facilitate cooperation in the High North. At the top of the world, the Arctic Ocean is cold, remote, and covered in darkness for half the year. It is testing enough to reach the ice-covered ocean, even harder to get under it and down to the seabed. The region's geopolitical challenges are as relevant as its geological mysteries: they are the implications of the development of the planet’s last unspoilt wilderness...|$|R
