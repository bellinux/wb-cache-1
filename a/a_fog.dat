5|$|Artillery, supplies, {{and troops}} were all being {{evacuated}} {{across the river}} at this time {{but it was not}} going as fast as Washington had anticipated and daybreak soon came. <b>A</b> <b>fog</b> settled in and concealed the evacuation from the British. British patrols noticed that there {{did not seem to be}} any American pickets and thus began to search the area. While they were doing this, Washington, the last man left, stepped onto the last boat. At 07:00, the last American troops landed in Manhattan. All 9,000 troops had been evacuated with no loss of life.|$|E
5|$|Concussion, {{also known}} as minor head trauma or mild {{traumatic}} brain injury (mTBI) {{is the most common}} type of traumatic brain injury. It is typically defined as a head injury with a temporary loss of brain function. Symptoms include a variety of physical, cognitive, and emotional symptoms, which may not be recognized if subtle. A variety of signs accompany concussion including headache, feeling in <b>a</b> <b>fog,</b> and emotional changeability. In general, the signs can be categorized into physical signs (such as loss of consciousness or amnesia), behavioral changes (such as irritability), cognitive impairment (such as slowed reaction times), and sleep disturbances. Fewer than 10% of sports-related concussions among children are associated with loss of consciousness.|$|E
5|$|Ged flies back to Ogion on Gont, who crafts a new {{staff for}} him. Contrary to Gensher, Ogion insists that all {{creature}}s have a name, and advises Ged {{to confront the}} shadow creature. Ged pursues the creature in a small sailboat, until it lures him into <b>a</b> <b>fog</b> and wrecks the boat on a reef. Ged recovers {{with the help of}} an elderly couple marooned on the island, who give Ged part of a broken bracelet as a gift. Ged patches his boat and escapes the island, pursuing the creature into the East Reach. On the island of Iffish he meets his friend Vetch, who insists on joining him. They journey east far beyond the last known lands before they finally come upon the shadow. Here Ged realizes that the shadow has always been a part of his own spirit. Naming it with his own name, he merges with the shadow creature, understanding and accepting it as part of himself, and thus healing himself.|$|E

5|$|In 1867, it was {{determined}} a new tower needed to be built and the new structure was completed in 1868. The new lighthouse was a keeper's quarters with an attached lantern on the roof. The structure is of the same design as lighthouses at Sheffield Island in Norwalk; Morgan Point in Noank; Old Field Point Light and Plum Island in New York; and Block Island North in Rhode Island. The dwelling is made of granite and the lantern made of cast iron. The original Fresnel lens was installed in the new tower. In 1890, <b>a</b> <b>fog</b> whistle was installed {{and it would be}} replaced by a siren in 1905. The siren caused much distress to nearby residents and had to be modified.|$|E
5|$|The game {{is played}} from an {{isometric}} perspective, and the screen, which {{does not need to}} remain centered on the protagonist, can be scrolled with the mouse or the keyboard. Areas are revealed as they are explored by the player's characters. <b>A</b> <b>fog</b> of war effect hides explored areas when the player's characters move away from them. The player can also change the formation in which the party moves. Clicking an area exit, such as a doorway or staircase, causes another area to be loaded. Clicking on the edge of an outside area causes the party to travel there; the game then presents the player with the World Map, from which the player may select a destination.|$|E
5|$|Dispatched to France in February 1915, the Canadian Division {{was briefly}} {{initiated}} to trench warfare {{on the periphery}} of the Battle of Neuve Chapelle before being attached to the British 2nd Army under Sir Horace Smith-Dorrien in the Belgian town of Ypres. It was in front of Ypres on 22 April that the Canadians bore the brunt of the most furious German attack of the year. In the afternoon at 5.00 pm the Germans began heavy shelling of the French trenches and the Canadians and the French Algerian troops stationed next to them saw <b>a</b> <b>fog</b> traveling across no-mans land, covering the advance of German forces. The fog was chlorine gas, the first occasion in which this substance had been used in warfare. The Algerians broke and fled, suffering over 6,000 casualties in a matter of minutes and the Canadians were consequently forced to defend twice the length of their front line in the face of a new and deadly weapon. Although the Canadian Division held on for more than two days, much ground was lost and the division had themselves suffered over 50% casualties, nearly 6,000 men.|$|E

50|$|He {{established}} himself locally from 2006 onward through performances at smaller venues like the former Gravity Lounge and Nelson County's Rapunzel's. Meanwhile, he recorded tracks for Through <b>a</b> <b>Fogged</b> Glass at his home, {{at the time}} a small cabin in Nelson County. In 2008 he began recording at Greenwood Studios, allowing more polished results which quickly bore fruit when he won acclaim as the 2008 winner of the First Amendment Writes songwriting competition. He began collaborating with several other locally known artists, including Devon Sproule who provided backing vocals for several of Swing's tracks, and Brian Caputo on drums. In January 2011, Through <b>a</b> <b>Fogged</b> Glass was released; a tour in support of the album is forthcoming, with dates to be announced on the west coast of the US and in Germany.|$|R
5|$|The player {{generally}} has {{to explore the}} dungeon to reveal its contents similar to <b>a</b> <b>fog</b> of war. Many roguelikes include factors related to light sources such as a torch to provide illumination to see monsters in nearby squares, and line of sight can also limit what monsters are visible. Dungeons tend to be connected by stairs; lower dungeon levels generally are more difficult than higher ones, so that a character that is underdeveloped may have difficulty by progressing too fast. Dungeon levels and the population of monsters and treasure within them are generated randomly using procedural generation, so that no game is the same on subsequent playthroughs. Most roguelikes have an ultimate goal of either claiming an item located at the deepest level of the dungeon, or to defeat a specific monster that lives on that level. Typical roguelikes include a scoreboard, ranking the player's performance once their game is over (be it through permadeath or completing the objective) based {{on the amount of}} treasure, money, and experience earned, and how fast the player completed the game in such cases.|$|E

Their aircraft became lost in <b>a</b> <b>fog</b> and low-hanging clouds. This was especially unfortunate as the following day, hostilities ceased according to the terms of the armistice that had been signed with Germany.|$|E

25|$|Between 1848 and 1902, American whaleships hunted whales off Sakhalin. They cruised for bowhead {{and gray}} whales {{to the north}} and right whales to the east and south. On 7 June 1855, the ship Jefferson (396 tons), of New London, was wrecked on Cape Levenshtern, on the northeastern side of the island, during <b>a</b> <b>fog.</b> All hands were saved as well as 300 barrels of whale oil.|$|E
25|$|The Pacific Ocean has {{a strong}} {{influence}} {{on the coast of}} the region with the cooling Camanchaca, <b>a</b> <b>fog</b> that enters the valley from the west each morning and retreats as the sun rises over the Andes from the east. With less than 4 inches of rainfall per year, drip irrigation is used to water the vines that grow in the mineral-rich soil. The combination creates fresh wines with a distinct mineral edge.|$|E

25|$|In his book, Steuart Campbell {{suggested}} that two errors by the pilots; failure {{to climb to}} a safe altitude upon entering cloud, and a navigational error made in the poor visibility (mistaking <b>a</b> <b>fog</b> signal station for a lighthouse), together caused the crash. The Board of Inquiry had identified that several factors may have sufficiently distracted the crew from {{turning away from the}} Mull, and upon entering cloud, failed to carry out the correct procedure for an emergency climb in a timely manner.|$|E

Cymric opened fire, J6 tried to signal, but the signalman was killed. J6 fled into <b>a</b> <b>fog</b> bank, but Cymric located J6 again, and sank her, with the loss of 14 lives.
