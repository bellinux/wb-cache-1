5|$|All of {{the warring}} parties were {{responsible}} for widespread violations {{of the laws of}} war, as civilians were caught in the ensuing crossfire. Insurgents reportedly deployed militants and established strongholds in heavily populated neighborhoods, launched mortar rounds from residential areas, and targeted public and private individuals for assassination <b>and</b> <b>violence.</b> TFG forces alleged to have failed to efficaciously warn civilians in combat zones, impeded relief efforts, plundered property, in some instances engaged in murder <b>and</b> <b>violence,</b> and mistreated detainees during mass arrests. According to HRW, the implicated TFG forces included military, police and intelligence personnel, as well as the private guards of senior TFG officials. Victims were often unable to identify TFG personnel, and confused militiamen aligned with TFG officials with TFG police officers and other state security personnel.|$|E

5|$|A {{nationalist}} {{movement in the}} Belgian Congo demanding the end of colonial rule led to the country's independence on 30 June 1960. Minimal preparations had been made and many issues, such as the questions of federalism and ethnicity, remained unresolved. In {{the first week of}} July, a mutiny broke out in the army <b>and</b> <b>violence</b> erupted between black and white civilians. Belgium sent troops to protect fleeing whites and two areas of the country, Katanga and South Kasai, seceded with Belgian support. Amid continuing unrest <b>and</b> <b>violence,</b> the United Nations deployed peacekeepers, but the UN Secretary-General Dag Hammarskjöld refused to use these troops to help the central government in Léopoldville fight the secessionists. Prime Minister Patrice Lumumba, the charismatic leader of the largest nationalist faction, reacted by calling for assistance from the Soviet Union, which promptly sent military advisors and other support.|$|E

In addition to the damage caused at the moment of injury, a variety of events in the minutes to days following the injury may result in secondary injury.

The paper will also examine the literature on evidence-based responses to children exposed to domestic <b>and</b> family <b>violence.</b> Key messages 	Significant numbers of Australian children are exposed to domestic <b>and</b> family <b>violence.</b> 	Domestic <b>and</b> family <b>violence</b> affects children’s physical and mental wellbeing, development and schooling, and {{is the leading cause of}} children’s homelessness in Australia. 	Domestic <b>and</b> family <b>violence</b> often co-occurs with child abuse including child sexual abuse. This co-occurrence needs particular attention in policy and practice. 	Policy responses to children exposed to domestic <b>and</b> family <b>violence</b> are complicated by the intersecting policy jurisdictions of child protection, family law <b>and</b> domestic <b>violence</b> sectors. 	Exposure to domestic <b>and</b> family <b>violence</b> alone does not seem to be a factor in future perpetration. Recent multi-country studies suggest that gender roles, stereotypes and violence-supportive attitudes are important for understanding the correlation. 	Therapeutic responses to children exposed to domestic <b>and</b> family <b>violence</b> should include working with mothers (or the non-offending parent) and children to strengthen attachment and should be trauma-informed. 	Primary prevention of domestic <b>and</b> family <b>violence</b> with children <b>and</b> young people is crucial and there is a promising evidence base for the effectiveness of school-based programs. 	Prevention strategies with children should be universally delivered and work to help children be critical of gender norms and violence-supportive attitudes, and equip them with the skills to form healthy and respectful relationships in adulthood...|$|R
