The {{remainder}} of his cavalry and foot soldiers were {{to wait in the}} fields below. Some sources assert that the fuse was lit at around 1:00 pm, although the 19th-century local historian Heinrich Joseph Floß argued that these sources are mistaken, and that the explosion clearly occurred in the morning. All sources agree that the explosion, with <b>a</b> <b>dreadful</b> crack, propelled chunks of the towers and walls high into the air. Almost half the Godesburg collapsed instantly. According to a newspaper report dated 13 January 1584, debris raining on the valley below damaged several houses, and destroyed some of them completely.|$|E

25|$|After <b>a</b> <b>dreadful</b> {{showing in}} the 2006-07 Ashes series, {{including}} a pair in the third Test at Perth, where his second innings dismissal was an embarrassing run out by Ricky Ponting while waiting on an lbw call, Jones was omitted from the one-day squad to play Australia and New Zealand and never regained his England place in any form of the game.|$|E
25|$|The {{bodies of}} noxii, and {{possibly}} some damnati, were thrown into rivers or dumped unburied; Denial of funeral rites and memorial condemned the shade (manes) {{of the deceased}} to restless wandering upon the earth as <b>a</b> <b>dreadful</b> larva or lemur. Ordinary citizens, slaves and freedmen were usually buried beyond the town or city limits, to avoid the ritual and physical pollution of the living; professional gladiators had their own, separate cemeteries. The taint of infamia was perpetual.|$|E
25|$|Despite <b>a</b> <b>dreadful</b> 1905, Cuttell bowled {{with deadly}} effect in 1906, being ahead even of Haigh in the {{national}} bowling averages despite taking over 100 fewer wickets. However, aged 43, he had already decided on the post of coach at Rugby, which he held right through to 1926. At the age of 63, he then became an umpire in county matches, but could carry out this role for only two years before his health deteriorated too much.|$|E

Debtors could even arrange to have themselves arrested by a business partner {{to enter the}} jail when it suited them. Historian Margot Finn writes that discharge was therefore used as a punishment; one debtor was thrown out in May 1801 for [...] "making a Noise and disturbance in the prison".|$|R

In fact the entire Japanese contingent suffered <b>a</b> <b>dreadful</b> race, especially when both Katayama and rookie Taki Inoue then aquaplaned into the pit wall {{at the end of}} lap three in separate incidents. Within the first few minutes all the local heroes were out of the race.|$|E
25|$|In 1703, he {{was created}} Knight of the Garter and Queen Anne {{appointed}} him Commander-in-Chief of the British forces sent to Portugal for the War of the Spanish Succession. Once in Portugal Schomberg was ineffective, simply allowing the Spanish General Tserclaes de Tilly {{to pass by}} unchallenged. Moreover, Schomberg had <b>a</b> <b>dreadful</b> temper which attracted universal disgust: neither Peter II, King of Portugal, nor Charles, claimant to the throne of Spain, were prepared to accept his turbulent behaviour and he was sent home in disgrace.|$|E
25|$|Oz was {{not always}} a fairyland, I am told. Once it was much like other lands, except it was shut in by <b>a</b> <b>dreadful</b> desert of sandy wastes that lay all around it, thus {{preventing}} its people from all contact {{with the rest of}} the world. Seeing this isolation, the fairy band of Queen Lurline, passing over Oz while on a journey, enchanted the country and so made it a Fairyland. And Queen Lurline left one of her fairies to rule this enchanted Land of Oz, and then passed on and forgot all about it.|$|E

25|$|Despite the {{revenues}} generated by very large home attendances, Charlton wouldn't allow Seed {{to invest in}} new players (he 'discovered' Stanley Matthews but wasn't allowed to sign him) and so The Addicks were unable to repeat their pre-war success in the First Division, finishing no higher than ninth in the initial six seasons after the conflict. They narrowly missed relegation in 1949–50 with a 20th position finish, but they finished fifth in 1952–53. Following two bottom-half-of-the-table finishes, Seed endured <b>a</b> <b>dreadful</b> start to the 1956–57 season, losing their first five matches, before being asked for his resignation in September 1956.|$|E
25|$|After the 1892 season had ended, <b>a</b> <b>dreadful</b> shock {{came when}} it was {{announced}} that Lohmann had contracted tuberculosis. In an effort to improve his health, Lohmann sailed during the 1892/1893 winter to Cape Town. Although at first it was hoped that he might return even when the 1893 season began, for two years Lohmann's health did not at first improve and he could not play at all for Surrey in 1893 or 1894. In fact, Lohmann was not well enough to play any cricket until the 1894/1895 Currie Cup final where he turned out for Western Province.|$|E
25|$|After {{working as}} a {{part-time}} striker's coach for Liverpool under Gerard Houllier in 2003, he was appointed manager of his first professional club, Chester City (by this time in Football League Two), in August 2004. Chester had made <b>a</b> <b>dreadful</b> start to their first season back in the Football League and Rush {{had a hard time}} at the helm. After losing 3–1 at Boston United in their first game in charge, they strung together a two-month unbeaten run and he led the club to the FA Cup third round. Rush seemed to be answering his critics, including former Liverpool teammate Mark Lawrenson, who doubted whether his tactical and coaching abilities could match his striking history.|$|E

25|$|There {{are four}} other playable {{characters}} in the game. Gibari is a laid-back but proud fisherman. He is comfortable disobeying village rules when it suits him, though this is usually done to help others, and prefers living by his own rules. Lyude is an imperial ambassador to Diadem, son of a powerful family {{in the heart of}} the Alfard Empire. He bears <b>a</b> <b>dreadful</b> secret related to his transfer to Diadem. Savyna is an ex-mercenary whose past is largely unknown. Mizuti is a masked creature who is shrouded in mystery. Towards the end of the game Mizuti's mask shatters and Mizuti is revealed to be a little girl, who possesses greater power than anyone else in her tribe.|$|E
25|$|In 1948, A.H. Kirksey, {{owner of}} Katy Park, persuaded the Pittsburgh Pirates club {{to take over}} the Waco operation, and the {{nickname}} was changed to Pirates. The Pirates vaulted into third place in 1948. They dropped a notch to fourth in 1949, but prevailed in the playoffs to win the league championship. The Pirates then tumbled into the second division, bottoming out with <b>a</b> <b>dreadful</b> 29-118, 0.197 club in 1952. This mark ranks as one of the 10 worst marks of any 20th-century full-season team. When the tornado struck in 1953, it destroyed the park. The team relocated to Longview to finish the season and finished a respectable third with a 77-68 record.|$|E
25|$|Following the Reading {{game was}} the home FA Cup tie versus Cardiff, where the team were {{defeated}} 2–0, producing <b>a</b> <b>dreadful</b> performance. The performance drew huge criticism from fans and they and manager alike demanded a better performance away at Villa Park three days later. Changes saw Arca dropped from the squad after a run of poor performances and Rochemback moved to the bench as Shawky and Boateng formed the new centre midfield partnership. Pogatetz captained the side. Downing got his seventh goal of the season after 23 minutes. Referee Steve Bennett gave Villa a penalty for a handball by Luke Young while the defender was looking the other way, which Gareth Barry slotted home. The game finished 1–1.|$|E

25|$|On the 7 July, Soviet {{aviation}} {{did play}} an important role in slowing the German advance and forcing the Fourth Panzer Army's advance north east, to Leningrad, to stop. They succeeded in getting among German troop and vehicle concentrations and spreading havoc on the congested bridges at the Velikaya River. But they did so at <b>a</b> <b>dreadful</b> price, and lost 42 bombers to JG 54. Between the 1 and 10 July, the VVS flew 1,200 sorties and dropped 500 tons of bombs. Army Group North reported heavy losses in equipment. Specifically the 1st Panzer Division noted these losses were caused by air attack. Franz Landgraf, commanding the 6th Panzer Division, reported particularly high losses. However, while some units had nearly been wiped out (2 and 41 SAD had lost 60 bombers), the prevented the Fourth Panzer Army from reaching Leningrad, before the Red Army prepared suitable defences. It unlikely that the Red Army could have prevented them from doing so without the intervention of the VVS.|$|E
25|$|The {{following}} season {{proved to}} be a massive disappointment, and Torquay only narrowly avoided relegation to the Football Conference. Matters improved in the 1999–00 season, with a finish of 9th, just three points off the play-offs. However, 2000–01 {{proved to be}} <b>a</b> <b>dreadful</b> season, and Saunders was sacked with the club adrift {{at the bottom of the}} table. He was replaced by Colin Lee, who improved results and gave the club a chance of survival. On 5 May 2001, the final game of the 2000–01 season saw United away to Barnet. Before the start of the game Barnet were bottom of the Third Division, one point behind Torquay. The Gulls needed to avoid defeat to keep their League status, Barnet needed to win. Thousands of fans were locked outside the tiny Underhill ground as United stormed to a 3–0 lead, with goals from Kevin Hill, Jason Rees, and David Graham. Barnet fought back to 3–2, but United held on for the win to condemn Barnet to the Football Conference.|$|E
25|$|Annoyed at Sir Eglamour’s success, {{the next}} task that the earl gives his daughter’s suitor {{is to kill}} the Boar of Sidon, <b>a</b> <b>dreadful</b> beast that has laid waste to the area where it lives. Sir Eglamour spends a month {{travelling}} out to Sidon where he locates this boar by seeing all the bodies of dead men strewn about the ground; in a scene that is perhaps mimicked by one featuring a Rabbit of Caerbannog in the irreverent Monty Python movie Monty Python and the Holy Grail. After a struggle with this boar that lasts for three days, Sir Eglamour kills the ferocious creature. His feat of bravery and skill-at-arms is noticed by the King of Sidon, who is riding nearby {{on the day that}} Sir Eglamour at last overcomes this beast. The king takes Sir Eglamour back to his castle where his daughter (beautiful, of course) is being threatened by a giant. This giant is demanding her hand in marriage and when he appears, Sir Eglamour kills him singlehandedly. The King of Sidon at once offers to confer onto Sir Eglamour all his titles and lands, as well as the hand of his daughter in marriage.|$|E
