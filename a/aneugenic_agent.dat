40|$|The {{potential}} genotoxicity {{of lavender}} essential oil and its major components, linalool, and linalyl acetate, was evaluated in vitro by the micronucleus test on peripheral human lymphocytes. In {{the range of}} non-toxic concentrations (0. 5 - 100 mu g/ml), linalyl acetate increased the frequency of micronuclei significantly and in concentration-dependent manner; lavender oil did so only at the highest concentration tested, whereas linalool was devoid of genotoxicity. None of the tested substances led {{to an increase in}} nucleoplasmic bridges or nuclear buds frequency. These findings suggest that the mutagenic activity of lavender oil can be related to the presence of linalyl acetate, which seems to have a profile of an <b>aneugenic</b> <b>agent.</b> Environ. Mol.

40|$|The {{incidence}} of in vivo urethane-induced chromosomal aberrations, sister chromatid exchanges (SCEs) and aneuploidy was examined in male mice. Â Single oral administration by gavage with urethane (0. 5 and 1 g/kg) caused {{a significant increase}} in chromosomal aberrations in bone marrow and spermatocyte cells, and statistical significant in SCE induction. The clastogenic effect observed was dose- and time- dependent. Â Aneuploidy was observed clearly with the high dose recording a significant value. Administration of lupin water extract at 5000 ppm/mice/day (added with the drinking water) reduced the frequency of chromosomal aberrations, but still at the significant values (P, 0. 001) while that administration of lupin extract elevated the aneuploidy induced with urethane. It can be concluded that urethane is a strong clastogenic Â and weak <b>aneugenic</b> <b>agent</b> when administered Â orally Â and administration of lupin water extract can be elevateing the aneugenic property of urethane.

40|$|To {{investigate}} {{the relationship between}} oncogene activation and induction of micronuclei by a new non-peptidic mimetic farnesyltransferase inhibitor, RPR- 115135, two isogenic cell lines, human colon cancer line HCT- 116, which harbors a K-ras mutation, and spontaneously immortalized human breast epithelial cell line MCF- 10 A, were utilized. HCT- 116 cells were transfected with an empty control pCMV vector (clone CMV- 2) or with a dominant negative mutated p 53 transgene (clone Mu-p 53 - 2) to disrupt p 53 function. In both clones RPR- 115135 induced {{a significant increase in}} the frequency of micronucleation at concentrations that did not affect cell membrane integrity. RPR- 115135 produced {{a significant increase in the}} ratio of CREST+ to CREST- micronuclei. MCF- 10 A cells were stably transfected with either c-Ha-ras or c-erbB- 2 or both H-ras + c-erbB- 2. No induction of micronuclei was observed. No induction of micronuclei was reported in human lymphocytes and in primary spinal cells obtained from 7 -day chick embryos. In conclusion, RPR- 115135 acts as an <b>aneugenic</b> <b>agent</b> in a complex manner, dependent upon the complement of mutations in cell regulatory genes in tumour cells and this activity may be independent of ras genotype...|$|E
40|$|Jatropha curcas L. (Euphorbiaceae) is {{important}} for biofuel production and as a feed ingredient for animal. However, the presence of phorbol esters in the oil and cake renders the seeds toxic. The toxicity of J. curcas oil is currently assessed by testing in animals, leading to their death. The identification of toxic and nontoxic improved varieties {{is important}} for the safe use of J. curcas seeds and byproducts to avoid their environmental toxicity. Hence, the aim {{of this study was to}} propose a short-term bioassay using a plant as a model to screen the toxicity of J. curcas oil without the need to sacrifice any animals. The toxicity of J. curcas oil was evident in germination, root elongation and chromosomal aberration tests in Lactuca sativa. It was demonstrated that J. curcas seeds contain natural compounds that exert phyto-, cyto- and genotoxic effects on lettuce, and that phorbol esters act as <b>aneugenic</b> <b>agents,</b> leading to the formation of sticky chromosomes and c-metaphase cells. In conclusion, the tests applied have shown reproducibility, which is important to verify the extent of detoxification and to determine toxic doses, thus reducing the numbers of animals that would be used for toxicity tests...|$|R
40|$|A {{methodology}} for {{the characterization of}} kinetochore-containing (CREST+) micronuclei (MN), based {{on the use of}} antikinetochore antibodies (derived from CREST patients) and indirect immunofluorescence, was applied to mouse bone marrow erythrocytes. The proposed protocol allows us to obtain fluorescent signals of good quality and highly reproducible data. The clastogenic agent mitomycin C (MMC; 1 mg/kg body wt) and the two aneugenic compounds chloral hydrate (CH; 200 mg/kg body wt) and colchicine (COL; 1 mg/kg body wt) were used to verify the sensitivity of this approach to chemicals with different mechanisms of action. These compounds were tested at a 20 h time interval from treatment and all of them were able to significantly increase (P < 0. 001) the frequency of MN in polychromatic erythrocytes. Of the MN observed in preparations from control animals, 45 % were CREST+ and this percentage increased significantly (P < 0. 001) after treatment with CH or COL. On the contrary, only 22 % CREST+ MN were found after treatment with MMC (statistical comparison with the control value: P < 0. 001). The CREST characterization of MN induced in vivo in mouse bone marrow allows us to infer the origin of MN formation, thus contributing to the identification of <b>aneugenic</b> <b>agents...</b>|$|R
40|$|Introduction: Chromosomal damage {{measurement}} is one {{of important}} ways to evaluate the toxicity, carcinogenicity, and mutagenicity of drugs, chemicals, and rays. The observation that chromosome damage {{can be caused by}} exposure to ionizing radiation or carcinogenic chemicals was among the first reliable evidence that physical and chemical agents can cause major alterations to the genetic material of eukaryotic cells. The Cytokinesis-Blocked Micronucleus (CBMN) assay also allowed us to score the abnormal nuclear shapes (ANS). The CBMN assay in human lymphocytes {{is one of}} the most commonly used methods for measuring DNA damage. Material and methods: The study population included 20 healthy workers exposed to ionizing radiation (radiologist, technicians and nurses) and 20 individuals healthy people not exposed on radiation. Results: We found an high frequency of micronuclei in healthy workers exposed on ionization in comparison with the control group (healthy people not exposed on ionization). Also we evaluate other nuclear changes like nucleoplasmic bridges and binucleated cell with nuclear buds are biomarkers of chromosomal instability and major alterations in genetic material of the cells. Conclusion: These results suggest that chromosomal instability is in the correlation with micronucleus frequencies and genetic load in healthy workers. The formation of micronucleus and other changes indicates that healthy workers are exposed on clastogenic and <b>aneugenic</b> <b>agents</b> like ionizing radiation and have chromosomal instability and risk of cancer. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{ability of}} the sodium salt of 3, 4 -secoisopimar- 4 (18), 7, 15 -trien- 3 -oic acid (1), a diterpenoid {{obtained}} from Salvia cinnabarina, to inhibit the genotoxic effect of ethyl methanesulfonate (a clastogenic agent) and colcemid (an <b>aneugenic</b> <b>agent),</b> was studied using a micronucleus assay on cultured human lymphocytes. Cells were treated with 1 before (pretreatment), during (co-treatment), and after (post-treatment) treatment with the mutagens, in order to investigate the type of antimutagenic activity (desmutagenic or bioantimutagenic) manifested. In the range of concentrations tested (0. 3 - 330 μM) 1 reduced significantly the frequency of micronuclei induced by ethyl methanesulfonate, in both pre- and co-treatment protocols (up to 74 % and 70 % of reduction, respectively), showing an anticlastogenic activity. Conversely, 1 did not inhibit the effect of colcemid in all treatments. The nuclear division index value of lymphocytes was not affected by treatment with 1, thus demonstrating that the anticlastogenic effect of 1 was not due to a cytotoxic effect. On {{the basis of the}} results obtained, it can be hypothesized that 1 exerts its anticlastogenic activity against ethyl methanesulfonate by a desmutagenic mechanism, possibly by chemical inactivation of the mutagen. © 2012 The American Chemical Society and American Society of Pharmacognosy...|$|E
40|$|The {{synthesis}} {{of a series}} of 1, 2, 3 -triazoles using glycerol as starting material is described. The key step in the preparation of these triazolic derivatives is the copper(I) -catalyzed azide-alkyne cycloaddition (CuAAC), also known as click reaction, between 4 -(azidomethyl) - 2, 2 -dimethyl- 1, 3 -dioxolane (3) and different terminal alkynes. The eight prepared derivatives were evaluated with regard to their fungicide, phytotoxic and cytotoxic activities. The fungicidal activity was assessed in vitro against Colletotrichum gloeosporioides, the causative agent of papaya anthracnose. It was found that the compounds 1 -(1 -((2, 2 -dimethyl- 1, 3 -dioxolan- 4 -yl) methyl) - 1 H- 1, 2, 3 -triazol- 4 -yl) -cyclo-hexanol (4 g) and 2 -(1 -((2, 2 -dimethyl- 1, 3 -dioxolan- 4 -yl) methyl) - 1 H- 1, 2, 3 -triazol- 4 -yl) propan- 2 -ol (4 h) demonstrated high efficiency in controlling C. gloeosporioides when compared to the commercial fungicide tebuconazole. The triazoles did not present any phytotoxic effect when evaluated against Lactuca sativa. However, five derivatives were mitodepressive, inducing cell death detected by the presence of condensed nuclei and acted as <b>aneugenic</b> <b>agents</b> in the cell cycle of L. sativa. It is believed that glycerol derivatives bearing 1, 2, 3 -triazole functionalities may represent a promising scaffold to be explored for the development of new agents to control C. gloeosporioides...|$|R
40|$|This thesis was {{submitted}} for {{the degree of}} Master of Philosophy and awarded by Brunel University. An assay using muntjac fibroblasts {{in conjunction with a}} differential spindle and chromosome stain was developed and evaluated for its ability to detect aneuploidy inducing agents. The effects of the spindle poison colcemid and the human carcinogen diethylstilboestrol were compared with those obtained after treatment of the cells with a number of compounds each believed to impair mitotic spindle function via a different mechanism. Vinblastine and nocodazole were both shown to have colcemid like effects suggesting a common mode of action and potential aneugenic activity. p-Fluorophenylalanine affected the spindle morphology resulting in an accumulation of atypical metaphases but without significant chomosome loss. Hydroquinone induced metaphase arrest and significant spindle damage but at doses very close to the toxic limits for this compound. Lastly, acenaphthene appeared to have no significant effect on mitosis at doses up to toxic levels. The ability of the muntjac fibroblasts to express aneuploid elements in recovery cell populations following treatment with colcemid and p-fluorophenylalanine was also examined. The results were inconclusive although an induction of endoreduplication was - indicated. Although both the spindle staining assay and recovery protocol require further refinement and validation, it was concluded that the assay was able to detect <b>aneugenic</b> <b>agents</b> especially those which act via the spindle...|$|R
40|$|<b>Aneugenic</b> and clastogenic <b>agents</b> {{are good}} {{inducers}} of both micronuclei and apoptosis. In its turn, apoptosis may modify the threshold {{values for the}} induction of micro-nuclei. This is of major concern for accurate assessment of hazard related to exposure to mutagens. In the present work we studied the influence of caspases, the key regulat-ors of the apoptotic process, on the induction of micronuclei in the cytokinesis block micronucleus assay. For this, we applied a combined approach in which both human peripheral blood mononucleated cells (PBMC) and the paired human breast carcinoma cell lines MCF- 7, which is caspase- 3 deficient, and the caspase- 3 transfected MCF- 7 (MCF- 7 casp- 3) were used to study the influence of caspase activity on micronuclei. When nocodazole induced apop-tosis was inhibited {{by the use of}} inhibitors of the two main apical caspases- 8 and- 9 in PBMC, the frequencies of micronucleated binucleates (MNCB) increased with inhibi-tion of these caspases confirming that apoptosis can elimin-ate micronucleated cells. On the contrary when caspase- 3 was inhibited, the frequencies of MNCB was lower, suggest-ing a role of caspase- 3, also in micronuclei formation. To verify this hypothesis, we compared the induction of apoptosis and micronuclei by the aneugen nocodazole, the clastogen methyl methane sulfonate (MMS) and the non-mutagenic apoptogen staurosporin in MCF- 7 and MCF- 7 casp- 3 cells. The results showed that when caspase- 3 activity was impaired, in the parental MCF- 7 cell line or in the MCF- 7 casp- 3 cells {{in the presence of the}} caspase- 3 inhibitor, the frequencies of nocodazole or MMS induced micronuclei decreased. These results suggest that caspase- 3, besides its function as an effector caspase in the apoptotic pathway, is also involved in the formation of micronuclei...|$|R
