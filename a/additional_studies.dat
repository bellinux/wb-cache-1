5|$|<b>Additional</b> <b>studies</b> of {{different}} groups in Wilhelmine Germany have all {{contributed to a}} new view of the period. Although the Junkers did, indeed, continue to control the officer corps, they did not dominate social, political, and economic matters {{as much as the}} Sonderweg theorists had hypothesized. Eastern Junker power had a counterweight in the western provinces {{in the form of the}} Grand Bourgeoisie and in the growing professional class of bureaucrats, teachers, professors, doctors, lawyers, scientists, etc.|$|E
5|$|Research {{conducted}} in 2003 suggests that extracts from Polyozellus multiplex may have suppressive effects on stomach cancer. The {{study showed that}} feeding a low concentration (0.5% or 1%) of the mushroom extract enhanced {{the activities of the}} enzymes glutathione S-transferase and superoxide dismutase, and increased the abundance of the molecule glutathione. The extract also augmented the expression of the protein p53. All of these substances protect the human organism against cancer. <b>Additional</b> <b>studies</b> reported in 2004 and 2006 attribute anti-tumor properties to polyozellin.|$|E
5|$|<b>Additional</b> <b>studies</b> of the palustris–couesi {{contact zone}} in Texas {{published}} in 1979, using more specimens and characters, {{indicated that the}} two species are in fact easily distinguishable there; therefore, O.couesi has since been regarded as a species distinct from the marsh rice rat. Afterward, {{some of the other}} forms synonymized under O.couesi or O.palustris were resurrected as separate species—Oryzomys nelsoni from the Marías Islands, western Mexico, and Oryzomys antillarum from Jamaica. In 2009, Michael Carleton and Joaquin Arroyo-Cabrales reviewed western Mexican Oryzomys, reaffirmed the distinctness of O.nelsoni, and reinstated O.peninsulae from the tip of the Baja California Peninsula and O.albiventer from interior Mexico as species. Still, O.couesi included 22 synonyms, and Carleton and Arroyo-Cabrales wrote that further research on O.couesi and related species would certainly result in the recognition of additional species.|$|E

The preliminary mechanical design of other major elements was done by the companies EADS Space Transportation and MAN.|$|E
5|$|Within {{weeks of}} the storm, the Alligator Rivers Region Advisory Committee began {{planting}} seedlings in deforested areas. By August 2006, {{a review of the}} growth of the new plants found that 81% to 88% of the seeds had survived and begun growing. To fully restore the South Alligator valley, environmentalists requested A$7.4million (US$6.6million) in funds. In a study at Magela Creek a year after the storm, it was determined that between 8% and 19% of the tree canopy lost due to the storm had begun to recover. <b>Additional</b> <b>studies</b> at the Gulungul Creek and the Alligator Rivers region revealed that suspended sediment values in flowing water had temporarily increased in the wake of Monica. The above-average values persisted for roughly a year before the streams returned to pre-cyclone sediment levels. In a study of the Arnhem forests which were devastated by the cyclone, environmentalists reported that it would take over 100years for the forest to recover. The storm's winds snapped numerous trees, estimated to have been over 200 years old and more than 60cm (23.6in) in diameter. It is estimated that it would take several hundred years before trees of similar sizes would flourish in the region.|$|E

On December 17, 2013, the FDA issued a draft rule revoking the Generally recognized as safe status of triclosan as an ingredient in hand wash products, citing the need for <b>additional</b> <b>studies</b> of its potential endrocrine and developmental effects; impact on bacterial resistance; and carcinogenic potential.|$|E
25|$|The {{relationship}} between AAS use and depression is inconclusive. There have been anecdotal reports {{of depression and}} suicide in teenage steroid users, but little systematic evidence. A 1992 review found that AAS may both relieve and cause depression, and that cessation or diminished use of AAS may also result in depression, but called for <b>additional</b> <b>studies</b> due to disparate data.

He then studied under Albert Wolff at the Prussian Academy of Arts in Berlin from 1870 to 1872. His 1872 bronze Wounded Philoctetes won a gold medal, and was purchased by the King of Greece. He completed <b>additional</b> <b>studies</b> in Rome, Vienna, and Paris from 1877 to 1881. While in Rome, he executed another major work, Bellerophon, in 1872.

25|$|<b>Additional</b> <b>studies</b> of the {{building}} were made {{over the next several}} years. In 2005, a real estate consultant reported that the FBI's scattered workforce (then housed in the Hoover building and 16 other leased sites throughout the D.C. metropolitan area) and the Hoover building's inefficient interior layout were creating workforce inefficiencies for the FBI. Security upgrades, building systems replacements, and other renovations were suggested. At this time, GSA estimated that it would take three years to develop a replacement headquarters and identify a site, and another three years for design, construction, and move-in. The FBI began studying the costs and logistics of moving its headquarters later that year.|$|E
25|$|Genie's {{inability}} {{to engage in}} normal interactions with other people provided additional evidence that understanding the principles of language was a separate skill from the ability to engage in conversations. In addition, her rapid progress with nonverbal communication and her exceptional proficiency at it demonstrated that even nonverbal communication was fundamentally separate from language. Her arguments have become widely accepted {{in the field of}} linguistics and other linguists, including Steven Pinker and James Hurford, have cited Genie's case study as evidence for Chomsky's hypothesis of innate language and for a steadily progressing version of the critical period for language acquisition. Curtiss' findings were also the impetus for several <b>additional</b> <b>studies</b> on both delayed and abnormal language acquisition.|$|E

25|$|Joeckel {{resigned}} from the Library in 1927 {{and returned to the}} Midwest to become an Associate Professor in the Department of Library Science at the University of Michigan, which then only provided a bachelor's degree in Library Science; he was appointed professor in 1930 when Library Science offered a graduate program as well. His strengths were in teaching library administration and book selection. Joeckel simultaneously pursued <b>additional</b> <b>studies</b> at the University and received his Master’s of Arts in Political Science in 1928. While attending {{the annual meeting of the}} Michigan Library Association (MLA) in 1929, he proposed the concept of “larger units of library service,” an idea then considered “audacious.

25|$|The 2001 NPS {{study also}} {{collected}} and analyzed soil samples at the moss-collection sites: no {{elevated levels of}} lead or cadmium were detected. <b>Additional</b> <b>studies</b> conclude that the concentrations of heavy metals detected in water, soil, caribou, fish, and berry samples collected from the Red Dog mine area do not pose a public health hazard. It is generally agreed that years of operation of tarp-top haul trucks (one every 15 minutes) carrying lead-zinc concentrate resulted in lead and cadmium-bearing dust contamination {{along the edges of}} the haul road. Fortunately this poor practice has not resulted in a threat to human safety. The entire concentrate-haulage system has been improved, including tight-fitting seals on side-dump trucks and enclosure of conveyor belts at the port site.|$|E
25|$|The EPIC-PANACEA study, {{published}} in 2010 in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition closely tracked 373,803 people {{over a period}} of 8 years across 10 countries. It concluded that meat consumption is positively associated with weight gain in men and women. The National Cattlemen's Beef Association countered by stating that meat consumption may not be associated with fat gain. In response, the authors of the original study controlled for just abdominal fat across a sample of 91,214 people and found that even when controlling for calories and lifestyle factors, meat consumption is linked with obesity. <b>Additional</b> <b>studies</b> and reviews have confirmed the finding that greater meat consumption is positively linked with greater weight gain even when controlling for calories, and lifestyle factors.|$|E
