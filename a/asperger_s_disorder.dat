40|$|One of {{the most}} {{prominent}} theories of autism and Asperger 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>Disorder</b> suggests that their symptoms arise from a primary deficit in executive functions (EF). While many researchers have argued that the executive dysfunction profile may be used as diagnostic support, there have been studies to suggest that autism and Asperger 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>Disorder</b> may not be clearly differentiated from other clinical disorders {{on the basis of their}} executive functioning profiles (e. g., Booth, et al., 2003). Therefore, it is important to examine specific aspects of executive functioning (e. g., cognitive planning, etc.) among children diagnosed with autism and Asperger 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>Disorder</b> in order to determine whether a distinct executive dysfunction profile exists among these populations. In the current investigation, a meta-analysis of 33 studies that administered cognitive planning measures to groups diagnosed with autism and Asperger 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>Disorder</b> (total N = 1, 020) and without autism or Asperger 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>Disorder</b> (N = 1, 591) was conducted. While children diagnosed with autism and Asperger 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>Disorder</b> exhibited significant weaknesses in cognitive planning, there was a lack of universality of cognitive planning deficits among individuals with autism and Asperger 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>Disorder</b> relative to other clinical groups. Overall, these findings suggest that cognitive planning weaknesses are neither necessary nor sufficient to cause all cases of autism and Asperger 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>Disorder.</b> Rather, difficulties with cognitive planning appear to be one important component of the complex neuropsychology of ASDs...|$|R

40|$|Individuals {{with autism}} and Asperger 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>Disorder</b> {{experience}} pervasive social impairments as a core diagnostic feature that assert an overwhelming influence on daily adaptive functioning (DSM-IV-TR, 2000). The inability to navigate effectively through {{the social world}} is often the key obstacle preventing successful adjustment into society. Social stories are a highly popularized intervention that is recommended to treat this symptom. The literature reflects that social stories are beneficial at reducing many problem behaviors. Systematic and empirical evidence {{of the use of}} social stories to increase prosocial behaviors is limited. The present study replicated previous methods (Delano 2 ̆ 6 Snell, 2006) and utilized a multiple baseline design across participants to investigate the use of social stories to increase verbal initiations and contingent responses to peers. The present study added to the research base by further examining the usefulness of social stories to increase verbal initiations to peers in students with both autism and Asperger 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>Disorder.</b> Additionally, this investigation looked at possible treatment effects in an applied setting. Results imply that until further research is able to decipher more about the crucial elements of social stories, including the underlying mechanism at play, their use to increase verbal initiations and contingent responses to peers in an applied setting maybe unreliable. Ineffectiveness of social stories is hypothesized to be due to characteristics of the population used or to the absence of a behavior analytic perspective when applying the treatment. It is theorized that close examination of the contextual influences that surrounded the occurrences of the target behaviors and attention to individual characteristics of participants may increase success rate of social stories. Findings point to the need for practitioners to exercise caution when using social stories to increase social engagement skills in individuals with autism and Asperger 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>Disorder</b> in an applied setting. ...|$|R

40|$|Perseverative {{conversation}} {{is a problem}} vocal behavior that is unique to individuals with Asperger 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>disorder.</b> It is characterized by long-winded monologues revolving around circumscribed interests. The current research literature suggests that perseverative conversation may exacerbate already poor social relations, impede productivity at work and home, and lead to disruptive behavior when it is restricted. Despite the negative repercussions {{there is a lack}} of research related to the assessment and treatment of this behavior. In the field of applied behavior analysis, concurrent operants assessments have been used effectively to identify relative preference for concurrently available reinforcers. In the current study, choice assessments using concurrent operants arrangements were used to evaluate the reinforcing properties of perseverative conversation in children and adolescents with Asperger 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>disorder.</b> Five participants, all with Asperger 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>disorder</b> and reported difficulties with perseverative conversation, were assessed in three phases: A preference assessment for conversation topics; an assessment of preference for reinforcer dimensions; and an assessment of preference for competing dimensions. In the first phase a two-stage preference assessment separated high-preferred from less-preferred conversation topics and in the second and third phases participants were asked to make choices regarding their preference for conversation content, conversational style, and conversation duration. Phase II results suggested that participants preferred conversing about their respective circumscribed interests over neutral topics, actively conversing rather than listening, and conversing for longer duration rather than shorter duration. Phase III, which assessed relative preference for the three reinforcer dimensions, resulted in a hierarchy of preference for all but one participant. Two participants demonstrated the strongest preference for conversation content and two participants demonstrated the strongest preference for conversational style. Conversation duration was least preferred by four of the five participants. Perseverative conversation occurred at a relatively high rate across all assessment phases. The results are discussed in terms of current theoretical explanations for perseverative thinking and behavior, implications for treatment, and future research of this problem vocal behavior...|$|R
40|$|TOPIC: Autism as a {{diagnostic}} construct {{in the last}} decade has undergone a process of rapid evolution in the way that it is operationalized. A by-product of the important conceptual shift is that we have been left with two terms, autistic disorder and Asperger 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>disorder,</b> that point to the same thing. The existence of two terms that cannot be clearly delineated results in confusion and an added element in an already anxiety-laden mix for all those trying {{to come to terms with}} the concept of autism. PURPOSE: This paper moves beyond contemporary arguments of whether autistic disorder and Asperger 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>disorder</b> are different entities and uses a case study to consider the mechanism of the confusion caused, and highlight the importance of referent clarity. SOURCES: A review of sources in journals and texts related to the topic is included to complement the progressive review of the case study as the clients move through a 1 -hour initial consult. CONCLUSION: The current diagnostic criteria are ambiguous posing the risk of confusion to parents, clinicians, and researchers. Nurses have an important role in assisting parents 2 ̆ 7 construction of a unified concept of autism clinically, and through research.

Sixty boys between the ages of 11. 0 and 15. 7 years (30 diagnosed with AD [Group A], and 30 typically developing, same-age peers [Group T]) were assessed using the Working Memory Test Battery for Children (WMTB-C). The present study combined theories from cognitive, neurological, and clinical psychology, isolated specific working memory components, and identified a connection between working memory capacity and the social skill deficiencies of individuals with AD. Three working memory scores (i. e., verbal [PL], visual-spatial [VSSP], and complex [CE]) were compared between the two groups using ANOVA. All working memory differences examined between the two groups {{in the present study were}} statistically different. The effect sizes of differences between Groups A and T for PL, VSSP, and CE were. 397,. 279, and. 627, respectively. The results of the present study support the hypothesis that working memory is a specific IP deficit of individuals with AD. Findings suggest that by targeting remedial efforts to enhance working memory capacity, individuals with AD can more effectively engage in complex IP tasks, participate in reciprocal social interactions, and thereby create social change. Future research needs to expand upon the connection between working memory capacity and the social deficiencies of individuals with Asperger 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>disorder...</b>|$|R

40|$|Background Autism {{spectrum}} disorder (ASD) includes {{symptoms that}} vary in severity and frequency between children. Consequently, multiple psychometric assessment procedures are recommended to detect an ASD, including scales which asses {{the presence and}} nature of ASD-related behaviour. However, to date, {{few studies have examined}} the relative and specific contribution which such behaviourally oriented scales can make to the diagnosis of individual children with ASD. Method Cluster analysis was used to explore the common characteristics of a group of 53 preschool and elementary school children with an ASD, based upon scores on tests of cognitive ability, adaptive behaviour and behavioural checklists designed to measure the presence of typical ASD. Results Data confirmed the expected variability in intelligence test scores. In addition, measures of adaptive behaviour and data from a behaviourally based rating scale suggested that children with Asperger 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>Disorder</b> and autism might be reclassified into subgroups according to the presence of particular ASD-specific behaviours.
