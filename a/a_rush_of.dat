5|$|In 1972 the CIA's Project Azorian, through billionaire Howard Hughes, {{commissioned}} the ship Hughes Glomar Explorer with {{the cover story}} of harvesting manganese nodules from the sea floor. That triggered <b>a</b> <b>rush</b> <b>of</b> activity to collect manganese nodules, which was not actually practical. The real mission of Hughes Glomar Explorer was to raise a sunken Soviet submarine, the K-129, {{with the goal of}} retrieving Soviet code books.|$|E
5|$|In the United States, <b>A</b> <b>Rush</b> <b>of</b> Blood was Coldplay's first {{venture into}} the top 5 with 144,000copies sold initially, {{stronger}} than its predecessor, Parachutes, which debuted at number 189 in December 2000.

5|$|The first deep-level tube railway, the City & South London Railway (C), {{opened in}} 1890. Its early success {{resulted}} in <b>a</b> <b>rush</b> <b>of</b> proposals to Parliament for other deep-level routes under the capital, but by 1901 only two more lines had opened: the Waterloo & City Railway (W) in 1898 and the Central London Railway (CLR) in 1900. Construction had started on one other line {{and then stopped}} following a financial crisis. The rest of the companies were struggling to raise funding.|$|E
5|$|These acts were {{followed}} {{by a number of}} bands who shared aspects of their music, including Snow Patrol, from Northern Ireland and Elbow, Embrace, Starsailor, Doves and Keane from England. The most commercially successful band in the milieu were Coldplay, whose first two albums Parachutes (2000) and <b>A</b> <b>Rush</b> <b>of</b> Blood to the Head (2002) going multi-platinum, establishing them {{as one of the most}} popular acts in the world by the time of their third album X (2005).|$|E

5|$|Pressure from an {{increasing}} population {{led to the}} town being supplied with amenities such as sewers, which were built in 1875–1880; and Sale {{was connected to the}} telephone network in 1888. As in the late-19th century, the early-20th century saw a great deal of construction work in Sale. The town's first swimming baths were built in 1914, and its first cinema, the Palace, was opened during the First World War. The end of the war in 1918 resulted in <b>a</b> <b>rush</b> <b>of</b> marriages, which highlighted a shortage of housing. The local councils of Sale and Ashton upon Mersey took the initiative of building council housing, and rented it to the local population at below market rates. By the outbreak of the Second World War in 1939, Sale had 594council houses. The building programme was interrupted by the start of the war. additional private housing development brought the total of inter-war houses built in Sale to around 900, including large housing estates like Woodheys Hall estate in Ashton.|$|E
5|$|To {{communicate}} with his handlers, Lody {{was instructed to}} write to certain addresses in Christiania (now Oslo), Stockholm, New York City and Rome. He acquired an American emergency passport {{in the name of}} Charles A.Inglis, a genuine document obtained from the US Embassy in Berlin. When Germany declared war on Russia on 1 August, newly imposed restrictions prevented foreigners from leaving Germany without travel documents. Embassies and consulates throughout the country experienced <b>a</b> <b>rush</b> <b>of</b> visitors as foreigners sought emergency passports; these had to be submitted to the German Foreign Ministry to obtain exit permits for neutral Denmark or the Netherlands. One such applicant was the real Charles A. Inglis, whose passport went missing– lost, it was claimed, although in fact the Foreign Ministry had appropriated it for Lody's use. As the passport lacked security features such as the holder's photograph or fingerprints, being merely a single-sheet document, it was well-suited for use by a spy. Lody said later that he had received it in the post from his superiors atN. He was also given £250 in British banknotes, 1,000 Danish krone and 1,000 Norwegian krone to finance his mission to the UK, where he would travel via Denmark and Norway.|$|E
5|$|Tulsa was a {{small town}} near {{the banks of the}} Arkansas River in 1901 when its first oil well, named Sue Bland No. 1, was established. Much of the oil was {{discovered}} on land whose mineral rights were owned by members of the Osage Nation under a system of headrights. By 1905, the discovery of the large Glenn Pool (located approximately 15 miles south of downtown Tulsa and site of the present-day town of Glenpool) prompted <b>a</b> <b>rush</b> <b>of</b> entrepreneurs to the area's growing number of oil fields; Tulsa's population swelled to over 140,000 between 1901 and 1930. By 1909, seven years after the discovery of oil in the area, Tulsa's population had sprouted to 180,000. Unlike the early settlers of Northeastern Oklahoma, who most frequently migrated from the South and Texas, many of these new oil-driven settlers came to Tulsa from the commercial centers of the East Coast and lower Midwest. This migration distinguished the city's demographics from neighboring communities (Tulsa has larger and more prominent Catholic and Jewish populations than most Oklahoma cities) and is reflected in the designs of early Tulsa's upscale neighborhoods.|$|E

25|$|David Hookes {{made his}} {{first-class}} debut in 1975–76 for South Australia. <b>A</b> <b>rush</b> <b>of</b> form in February 1977, when he scored five centuries from six innings in 17 days, {{led to his}} selection for the Centenary Test in March, 1977, {{at the age of}} 21.|$|E
25|$|A further two {{articles}} {{were published in}} The Guardian and the News of the World later that year.

25|$|After hearing Coldplay's <b>A</b> <b>Rush</b> <b>of</b> Blood to the Head, {{they agreed}} that was how they wanted their album to sound. They sent demos to Ken Nelson, who was {{responsible}} for producing <b>A</b> <b>Rush</b> <b>of</b> Blood to the Head. Nelson soon responded, stating that he would be interested in working with them. With little financial security, they relocated to London and waited for Nelson to finish production on Coldplay's X. The start date of the recording of Howling Bells was repeatedly delayed because Coldplay was dissatisfied with its studio sessions. In the meantime, to support themselves, the members of Howling Bells took up temporary work. Eight to ten months after their arrival in England, Nelson contacted them with the news that he would soon be ready to record.|$|E

25|$|US385 travels {{south to}} north through the Nebraska Panhandle {{which has been}} part of the state since it was {{acquired}} in 1803 as part of the vast Louisiana Purchase. Much of inland Nebraska, including the Panhandle became important regions for overland travel via horse and wagon. This included the California, Mormon, and Oregon trails as well as the Pony Express route which passed through the region. Settlers to Nebraska were mostly farmers, but the discovery of gold in Wyoming in 1859 sent <b>a</b> <b>rush</b> <b>of</b> speculators westward across the state.|$|E
25|$|A {{stronger}} form of saudade may be felt towards {{people and}} things whose whereabouts are unknown, such as old ways and sayings; a lost lover who is sadly missed; a faraway place where one was raised; loved ones who have died; feelings and stimuli one used to have; and the faded, yet golden memories of youth. Although it relates to feelings of melancholy and fond memories of things/people/days gone by, it can be <b>a</b> <b>rush</b> <b>of</b> sadness coupled with a paradoxical joy derived from acceptance of fate and the hope of recovering or substituting what is lost by something that will either fill in the void or provide consolation.|$|E

25|$|After Obama won the North Carolina {{primary and}} {{narrowly}} lost the Indiana primary, superdelegates began to endorse Obama in greater numbers. Despite losing West Virginia and Kentucky by wide margins, Obama's win in Oregon {{gave him an}} absolute majority of the pledged delegates, and he maintained that majority after the full delegations of Florida and Michigan were seated at half voting strength by a May 31 Democratic National Committee ruling. After <b>a</b> <b>rush</b> <b>of</b> support for Obama from superdelegates on June 3, {{the day of the}} final primary contests of Montana and South Dakota, Obama was estimated to surpass the 2,118 delegates required for the Democratic nomination. On June 7, Clinton formally ended her candidacy and endorsed Obama, making him the party's presumptive nominee.|$|E
25|$|After {{overnight}} {{track work}} to fix {{problems with the}} track at turn 10, the race started with Hamilton holding his lead and all the cars making it through the first corner. Hamilton built up a lead of over 5 seconds over Robert Kubica before Adrian Sutil had a gearbox failure on the 16th lap and parked his car after turn 3. Sutil's car was off the track but after it caught fire the safety car was brought out, and there was <b>a</b> <b>rush</b> <b>of</b> drivers into the pits as all of the six lead drivers went in for their pit stops. Hamilton led Räikkönen and Kubica into the pitlane but Räikkönen took the lead as they left their garages, with Kubica alongside him and Hamilton behind.|$|E
25|$|Making {{matters worse}} from Penn's perspective, Philip Ford, his {{financial}} advisor, had cheated Penn out {{of thousands of}} pounds by concealing and diverting rents from Penn's Irish lands, claiming losses, then extracting loans from Penn to cover the shortfall. When Ford died in 1702, his widow Bridget threatened to sell Pennsylvania, to which she could prove title. Penn sent William to America to manage affairs, but he proved just as unreliable {{as he had been}} in England. There were considerable discussions about scrapping his constitution. In desperation, Penn tried to sell Pennsylvania to the Crown before Bridget Ford got wind of his plan, but by insisting that the Crown uphold the civil liberties that had been achieved, he could not strike a deal. Mrs. Ford took her case to court. At age 62, Penn landed in debtors' prison; however, <b>a</b> <b>rush</b> <b>of</b> sympathy reduced Penn's punishment to house arrest, and Bridget Ford was finally denied her claim to Pennsylvania. A group of Quakers arranged for Ford to receive a payment for back rents and Penn was released.|$|E
