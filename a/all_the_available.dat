5|$|A {{complete}} explanation of mercury's extreme volatility delves {{deep into the}} realm of quantum physics, but it can be summarized as follows: mercury has a unique electron configuration where electrons fill up <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>available</b> 1s, 2s, 2p, 3s, 3p, 3d, 4s, 4p, 4d, 4f, 5s, 5p, 5d, and 6s subshells. Because this configuration strongly resists removal of an electron, mercury behaves similarly to noble gases, which form weak bonds and hence melt at low temperatures.|$|E
5|$|To be able {{to choose}} the more {{appropriate}} algorithm for each specific problem, it is important to determine both the effectiveness and precision of <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>available</b> algorithms. The domain studying these matters is called numerical linear algebra. As with other numerical situations, two main aspects are the complexity of algorithms and their numerical stability.|$|E
5|$|In April, Turner {{wrote in}} a self-congratulatory tone to Himmler's {{personal}} staff officer, SS-Obergruppenführer Karl Wolff, stating that he had already had <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>available</b> Jewish men killed and all {{the women and children}} placed in the Sajmište concentration camp. He went on to claim that he had arranged, {{with the help of the}} SD, a gas van to clear the camp in a period of a fortnight to four weeks. Holocaust historian Christopher Browning considers this claim suspect, stating that Turner's reports about Jewish affairs were often inaccurate and self-serving in an attempt to ingratiate himself with Hitler and shore up his position. Browning's view is that a van was dispatched after regular requests from Belgrade for the remaining Jews to be deported directly, so that the local authorities could resolve the matter themselves. When the van arrived in Belgrade, Meyszner was kept informed, and Schäfer asked him for directions.|$|E

5|$|Matthew Allen Hughes (born October 13, 1973) is {{a retired}} American mixed martial artist with a {{background}} in wrestling. He is a two-time UFC Welterweight Champion, UFC Hall of Fame inductee, and NJCAA Hall of Fame inductee. During his tenures in the Ultimate Fighting Championship, Hughes put together two separate six-fight winning streaks, defeated <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>available</b> opposition in the welterweight division, and defended the belt a then-record seven times. Hughes {{was inducted into the}} UFC Hall of Fame in May 2010 during the UFC Fan Expo in conjunction with UFC 114.|$|E
5|$|Some of Hendrix's {{unfinished}} {{material was}} released as the 1971 title The Cry of Love. Although the album reached number {{three in the}} U.S. and number two in the UK, producers Mitchell and Kramer later complained that {{they were unable to}} make use of <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>available</b> songs because some tracks were used for 1971's Rainbow Bridge; still others were issued on 1972's War Heroes. Material from The Cry of Love was re-released in 1997 as First Rays of the New Rising Sun, along with the other tracks that Mitchell and Kramer had wanted to include.|$|E
5|$|The {{book was}} {{the first volume of}} three Darwin wrote about the geology he had {{investigated}} during the voyage, and was widely recognised as a major scientific work that presented his deductions from <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>available</b> observations on this large subject. In 1853, Darwin was awarded the Royal Society's Royal Medal for the monograph and for his work on barnacles. Darwin's theory that coral reefs formed as the islands and surrounding areas of crust subsided has been supported by modern investigations, and is no longer disputed, while the cause of the subsidence and uplift of areas of crust has continued to be a subject of discussion.|$|E

5|$|The game {{incorporates}} {{an inventory}} system for items that Sam picks {{up during the}} course of the game. Items can be used on other entities in the game world, or can often be combined with other inventory items to provide a new object necessary for solving a puzzle. Although Max's character will walk around the game's areas by his own will, Sam can also use Max at various points by using an inventory icon of Max's head on game objects—usually on characters where the solution to a problem involves violence. Sam and Max travel to different locations in the game using their black and white 1960 DeSoto Adventurer, which when clicked on in-game will present a map of the United States with <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>available</b> locations the pair can travel to shown. As the game progresses, the number of locations on the map increases.|$|E
5|$|Constantine IV {{used the}} peace to proceed against the {{mounting}} Bulgar menace in the Balkans, but his huge army, comprising <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>available</b> {{forces of the}} Empire, was decisively beaten, opening {{the way for the}} establishment of a Bulgar state in the northeastern Balkans. In the Muslim world, after the death of Mu'awiya in 680, the various forces of opposition within the Caliphate manifested themselves. The Caliphate's division during this Second Muslim Civil War allowed Byzantium to achieve not only peace, but also a position of predominance on its eastern frontier. Armenia and Iberia reverted for a time to Byzantine control, and Cyprus became a condominium between Byzantium and the Caliphate. The peace lasted until Justinian II (r. 685–695 and 705–711) broke it in 693, with devastating consequences: the Byzantines were defeated, Justinian was deposed and a twenty-year period of anarchy followed. Muslim incursions intensified, leading to a second Arab attempt at conquering Constantinople in 717–718, which also proved unsuccessful.|$|E
5|$|The {{assault was}} under the direct command of Major-General Essad Pasha. The plan was to gather the assault force {{secretly}} behind the Turkish lines on 18 May. Then at 03:30 19 May, {{while it was still}} dark, the Turkish forces would simultaneously attack all along the ANZAC perimeter. The aim was to force the defenders out of their trenches and back into the sea. To maintain surprise the attack would not be preceded by an artillery bombardment; but the previous day <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>available</b> Turkish artillery bombarded the ANZAC lines between 17:00 and midnight. This was something they had done twice before that month. The signal to start the attack {{was supposed to have been}} the detonation of a large mine at Quinn's Post, in the centre of the ANZAC lines, but by 19 May the tunnel for the mine had not been completed. The attacking force, from north to south, comprised the 19th Division (now made up of the 27th, 57th and 72nd Infantry Regiments), 5th Division (13th and 14th Infantry Regiments), 2nd Division (1st, 5th and 6th Infantry Regiments), 16th Division (33rd, 47th, 48th and 125th Infantry Regiments) and the now independent 77th Infantry Regiment. In total this was around 42,000 men. The 2nd and 16th Divisions were fresh, having just arrived on the peninsula, while the other two had taken part in some of the previous counter-attacks at Anzac Cove.|$|E
