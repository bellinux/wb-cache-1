The Facility uses the same arsenal of light-gas and powder guns as the HFFAF to accelerate particles that {{range in size from}} [...] diameter to velocities ranging from 0.5 to 8.5km/s (1,500 to 28,000ft/s). Most of the research effort to date has centered on Earth atmosphere entry configurations (Mercury, Gemini, Apollo, and Shuttle), planetary entry designs (Viking, Pioneer Venus, Galileo and MSL), and aerobraking (AFE) configurations. The facility has also been used for scramjet propulsion studies (National <b>Aerospace</b> <b>Plane</b> (NASP)) and meteoroid/orbital debris impact studies (Space Station and RLV). In 2004, the facility was utilized for foam-debris dynamics testing in support of the Return To Flight effort.

50|$|A {{difference}} between rocket based and air-breathing <b>aerospace</b> <b>plane</b> launch systems is that <b>aerospace</b> <b>plane</b> designs typically include minimal oxidizer storage for propulsion. Air-breathing <b>aerospace</b> <b>plane</b> designs include engine inlets {{so they can}} use atmospheric oxygen for combustion. Since {{the mass of the}} oxidizer is, at takeoff, the single largest mass of most rocket designs (the Space Shuttle's liquid oxygen tank weighs 629,340 kg, more than one of its solid rocket boosters), this provides a huge potential weight savings benefit. However, air breathing engines are usually very much heavier than rocket engines and the empty weight of the oxidizer tank, and since, unlike oxidizer, this extra weight (which is not expended to add kinetic energy to the vessel, as is propellant mass) must be carried into space it may offset the overall system performance.|$|E

40|$|High {{stagnation}} {{pressures and}} enthalpies {{are required for}} the testing of aerospace vehicles such as <b>aerospace</b> <b>planes,</b> aeroassist vehicles, and reentry vehicles. Among the most useful ground test facilities for performing such tests are shock tunnels. With a given driver gas condition, the enthalpy and pressure in the driven tube nozzle reservoir condition can be varied by changing the driven tube geometry and initial gas fill pressure. Reducing the driven tube diameter yields only very modest increases in reservoir pressure and enthalpy. Reducing the driven tube initial gas fill pressure can increase the reservoir enthalpy significantly, but {{at the cost of}} reduced reservoir pressure and useful test time. A new technique, the insertion of a converging section in the driven tube is found to produce substantial increases in both reservoir pressure and enthalpy. Using a one-dimensional inviscid full kinetics code, a number of different locations and shapes for the converging driven tube section were studied and the best cases found. For these best cases, for driven tube diameter reductions of factors of 2 and 3, the reservoir pressure can be increased by factors of 2. 1 and 3. 2, respectively and the enthalpy can be increased by factors of 1. 5 and 2. 1, respectively...|$|R
40|$|Various {{extrusion}} cross-sections {{designs are}} used to build advanced <b>aerospace</b> <b>planes.</b> Material for these designs vary, most use aluminum, titanium, steels and composites. Most metallics are formed in the elastic-plastic range of the material. Considerable spring-back occurs coupled with buckling and necking during forming operations. The analysis of a I-beam join section is modeled. The standard forming practice for extru sions currently utilize two forming steps: Pre-forming in the “O ” condition, heat-treated to the “W ” condition where the final forming operation is performed. Each part then requires costly hand forming which is typically integrated into the production process. Utilizing the finite element technique, several forming operations are eliminated thus reducing the cost and time for manufacturing. A single forming operation is used by developing the die configuration for the “ 7075 -W ” extrusion and by determining the optimum forming parameters. Reduction in process steps is accomplished while additional hand forming operations are eliminated. The FEA model results are compared against experimental forming data to determine accuracy.

40|$|This is a {{study of}} {{performance}} and control for transatmospheric (TAV) <b>aerospace</b> <b>planes,</b> that use air-breathing propulsion. The study is structured in two parts and considers the heat load near the stagnation point. TheJirst part is analytical and consists of two cases, it seeks closed form solutions for the non-linear feedback controls (aerodynamic and thrust), which are necessary to transfer the (T A V) from one specijied state to another specijied state, while satisfying pairs of equality constraints (that is, Case I: constant acceleration with constant dynamic pressure and Case I I: constant rate of climb with constant dynamic pressure). This leads to closed form solutions for the controls in feedback form and also for the heat rate and load. The analytical approach gives a reasonable approx-imation of the general ascent trajectory to orbit, where the two cases {{can be used in}} combination with different constant values of the constraints in diferent levels of the hypersonic trajectory. The analytical results were a useful guide in the numerical studies. The second part describes numerical simulation and optimization. The control laws, which minimize the heat load, are found in feedback form. A numerical example is worked out for illustration.
