Koalas' independent development of fingerprints is an example of convergent evolution.|$|E
25|$|Before their near-extirpation by {{trapping}} in North America, beavers {{were practically}} ubiquitous and lived from the arctic tundra to {{the deserts of}} northern Mexico, and from the Atlantic to the Pacific Oceans. Physician naturalist Edgar Alexander Mearns' 1907 report of beaver on the Sonora River may be the southernmost extent {{of the range of}} this North American <b>aquatic</b> <b>mammal.</b> However, beavers have also been reported both historically and contemporaneously in Mexico on the Colorado River, Bavispe River, and San Bernardino River.|$|E
50|$|<b>Aquatic</b> <b>mammals</b> {{were the}} target for {{commercial}} industry, {{leading to a}} sharp decline in all populations of exploited species, such as beavers. Their pelts, suited for conserving heat, were taken during the fur trade and made into coats and hats. Other <b>aquatic</b> <b>mammals,</b> such as the Indian rhinoceros, were targets for sport hunting and had a sharp population decline in the 1900s. After it was made illegal, many <b>aquatic</b> <b>mammals</b> became subject to poaching. Other than hunting, <b>aquatic</b> <b>mammals</b> can be killed as bycatch from fisheries, where they become entangled in fixed netting and drown or starve. Increased river traffic, most notably in the Yangtze river, causes collisions between fast ocean vessels and <b>aquatic</b> <b>mammals,</b> and damming of rivers may land migratory <b>aquatic</b> <b>mammals</b> in unsuitable areas or destroy habitat upstream. The industrialization of rivers led to the extinction of the Chinese river dolphin, with the last confirmed sighting in 2004.|$|R

25|$|Before 1850, {{most of the}} {{freshwater}} on {{the islands}} was held in beaver (Castor canadensis) ponds, although the <b>aquatic</b> <b>mammal</b> was extirpated by Hudson's Bay Company fur stations at Fort Langley and San Juan Island. Remnants of beaver dams number in the hundreds across the archipelago. Gnawed stumps and beaver sign are now seen on Orcas and other islands, and recolonization by this keystone species is {{likely to lead to}} increased abundance and diversity of birds, amphibians, reptiles and plants. In spring, 2011 a pair of beaver appeared at Killebrew Lake on Orcas Island, but were killed to avoid flooding a phone company switch box buried under Dolphin Bay Road. These beaver likely swam from the mainland and could have recolonized the islands.|$|E
2500|$|The {{consequences}} of {{falling into a}} deep sleep for marine mammalian species can be suffocation and drowning, or becoming easy prey for predators. Thus, dolphins, whales, and pinnipeds (seals) engage in unihemispheric sleep while swimming, which allows one brain hemisphere to remain fully functional, while the other goes to sleep. The hemisphere that is asleep, alternates so that both hemispheres can be fully rested. Just like terrestrial mammals, pinnipeds that sleep on land fall {{into a deep sleep}} and both hemispheres of their brain shut down and are in full sleep mode. [...] <b>Aquatic</b> <b>mammal</b> infants do not have REM sleep in infancy; REM sleep increases as they age.|$|E

40|$|A {{variety of}} {{mammalian}} lineages have secondarily invaded the water. To locomote and thermoregulate in the aqueous me-dium, mammals developed {{a range of}} morphological, physi-ological, and behavioral adaptations. A distinct difference in the suite of adaptations, which affects energetics, is apparent between semiaquatic and fully <b>aquatic</b> <b>mammals.</b> Semiaquatic mammals swim by paddling, which is inefficient {{compared to the use}} of oscillating hydrofoils of <b>aquatic</b> <b>mammals.</b> Semi-aquatic mammals swim at the water surface and experience a greater resistive force augmented by wave drag than submerged <b>aquatic</b> <b>mammals.</b> A dense, nonwettable fur insulates semi-aquatic <b>mammals,</b> whereas <b>aquatic</b> <b>mammals</b> use a layer of blubber. The fur, while providing insulation and positive buoy-ancy, incurs a high energy demand for maintenance and limits diving depth. Blubber contours the body to reduce drag, is an energy reserve, and suffers no loss in buoyancy with depth. Despite the high energetic costs of a semiaquatic existence, these animals represent modern analogs of evolutionary intermedi-ates between ancestral terrestrial mammals and their fully aquatic descendants. It is these intermediate animals that in-dicate which potential selection factors and mechanical con-straints may have directed the evolution of more derived aquatic forms...|$|R

25|$|<b>Aquatic</b> <b>mammals</b> seldom dive {{beyond their}} aerobic diving limit, which {{is related to}} the {{myoglobin}} oxygen stored.

Myoglobin-bound oxygen is only released in relatively hypoxic muscle tissue, so the peripheral vasoconstriction due to the diving reflex makes the muscles ischaemic and promotes early use of myoglobin bound oxygen.|$|R

40|$|Abstract: In {{the last}} few decades, various {{studies have shown that}} <b>aquatic</b> <b>mammals</b> are {{sensitive}} to the toxicological effects of certain xenobiotic compounds, including the large class of endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs). Since some EDCs, particularly organochlorines, tend to bioaccumulate and biomagnify in the aquatic food chain, various <b>aquatic</b> <b>mammals,</b> particularly those high in the food chain, such as pinnipeds, odontocete cetaceans, and polar bears, are potentially “at risk”. The main aim of this chapter is to define {{the state of the art}} on effects of endocrine disruptors in <b>aquatic</b> <b>mammals,</b> both freshwater and marine. Another aim is to formulate recommendations for future research in this field and finally to define what can be done internationally for hazard/risk assessment and communication of the findings...|$|R
50|$|Some <b>aquatic</b> <b>mammals</b> have {{retained}} four weight-bearing limbs (e.g. hippopotamuses, beavers, otters, muskrats) and can walk on land like fully terrestrial mammals. The long and thin {{legs of a}} moose limit exposure to and friction from water in contrast to hippopotamuses who keep most of their body submerged and have short and thick legs. The semiaquatic pygmy hippopotamus can walk quickly on a muddy underwater surface thanks to robust muscles and because all toes are weight-bearing. Some <b>aquatic</b> <b>mammals</b> with flippers (e.g. seals) are amphibious and regularly leave the water, sometimes for extended periods, and maneuver on land by undulating their bodies to move on land, similar to the up-and-down body motion used underwater by fully <b>aquatic</b> <b>mammals</b> (e.g. dolphins and manatees).|$|R
