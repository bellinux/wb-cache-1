2500|$|The ocean can {{be divided}} into three density zones: the <b>surface</b> <b>zone,</b> the pycnocline, and the deep <b>zone.</b> The <b>surface</b> <b>zone,</b> also called the mixed layer, refers to the {{uppermost}} density zone of the ocean. Temperature and salinity are relatively constant with depth in this zone due to currents and wave action. The <b>surface</b> <b>zone</b> contains ocean water that is in contact with the atmosphere and within the photic <b>zone.</b> The <b>surface</b> <b>zone</b> has the ocean's least dense water and represents approximately 2% of the total volume of ocean water. The <b>surface</b> <b>zone</b> usually ranges between depths of [...] to [...] below ocean surface, but this can vary a great deal. In some cases, the <b>surface</b> <b>zone</b> can be entirely non-existent. The <b>surface</b> <b>zone</b> is typically thicker in the tropics than in regions of higher latitude. The transition to colder, denser water is more abrupt in the tropics than in regions of higher latitudes. The pycnocline refers to a zone wherein density substantially increases with depth due primarily to decreases in temperature. The pycnocline effectively separates the lower-density <b>surface</b> <b>zone</b> above from the higher-density deep zone below. The pycnocline represents approximately 18% of the total volume of ocean water. The deep zone refers to the lowermost density zone of the ocean. The deep zone usually begins at depths below [...] in mid-latitudes. The deep zone undergoes negligible changes in water density with depth. The deep zone represents approximately 80% of the total volume of ocean water. The deep zone contains relatively colder and stable water.|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{concerns}} {{the formation of}} tough <b>surface</b> <b>zones,</b> depleted of cubic carbo-nitrides, in cemented carbides. Several materials with varied phase compositions, binder phase volume fraction, and carbon content have been investigated. The main experimental techniques {{that have been used}} are scanning electron microscopy (SEM), electron probe microanalysis (EPMA), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and atom probe field ion microscopy (APFIM). Some of the experimental results have been compared to computer simulations based on thermodynamics and diffusion. Good agreement between computer simulations and experimental results of the distribution of elements and phases was found. It was therefore concluded that the formation of <b>surface</b> <b>zones</b> is a process controlled by thermodynamics and diffusion. It was investigated how the gradient <b>surface</b> <b>zone</b> formation depends on cubic phase composition. Addition of Ta to the cubic phase was found to decrease the elemental variations in the gradient profile and to give a thinner <b>surface</b> <b>zone.</b> Addition of Nb gave the opposite effect, with larger elemental variations and a wider <b>surface</b> <b>zone.</b> The effect of the binder phase volume fraction on gradient zone formation was studied. It was found that the zone width is directly proportional to the binder content. It was also found that the diffusivity is reduced with a factor equal to the binder volume fraction due to the presence of dispersed phases, i. e. carbides and carbo-nitrides. Study of materials with varied carbon content showed that with a high C content the driving force for gradient formation becomes stronger, and wider <b>surface</b> <b>zones</b> are formed. The effect of high C content was found to be reduced if Ta or Nb was added to the cubic phase. Methods to prepare APFIM specimens of near surface regions were developed. The methods are based on dimple grinding, electropolishing, and focused ion beam milling (FIB). The methods allow for positioning of APFIM specimens with high accuracy in the material, and to re-sharpen analysed specimens. Analysis was performed of the cubic phase just inside the zone border and the results could be related to the sintering process...|$|R
40|$|Although {{fractures}} in rock are well-recognized as pathways for fast percolation of water, {{the possibility that}} fast flow could occur along unsaturated fracture pathways is commonly not considered in vadose zone hydrology. In this study, two mechanisms for fast flow along unsaturated fractures were investigated, film flow and <b>surface</b> <b>zone</b> flow. The importance of fracture surface roughness was demonstrated through experiments conducted on ceramic blocks having simple surface topographies. Those experiments showed that film flow on fracture surfaces {{is largely due to}} flow along continuous surface channels which become water-filled at near-zero matric (capillary) potentials. The second mechanism, <b>surface</b> <b>zone</b> flow, is important when the permeability of the rock along fractures (fracture skin) is significantly greater than that of the bulk rock matrix. <b>Surface</b> <b>zone</b> fast flow was demonstrated through water imbibition (sorptivity) experiments. These mechanisms help explain observations of rapid solute transport in unsaturated subsurface environments...|$|R

40|$|Several of OPC {{paste and}} {{concrete}} specimens, with different mix proportions, were cast against CPF and impermeable formwork (IF) and the profiles of pore structure, microhardness and scratch hardness {{of the cover}} zone were established. The chloride ingress {{and the depth of}} carbonation of the <b>surface</b> <b>zone</b> of concrete cast against CPF and IF were investigated. The main mechanisms controlling the ECR processes and the factors affecting such treatment were critically reviewed. Subsequently, as a means of restoring passivation of steel embedded in carbonated concrete, such HCP specimens were subjected to ECR. The influence of ECR on the chemistry of the pore solution and the microstructure of the surface and the steel/cement past interface zones were also studied. The main findings of this investigation were as follows: (a) The thickness of the microstructure gradient of cover concrete is significantly decreased with increasing period of water curing but is relatively unaffected by curing temperature, w/e ratio and the use of cement replacement materials. (b) The scratch hardness technique was shown to be potentially useful for characterising the microstructure and microhardness gradients of the <b>surface</b> <b>zone.</b> (c) A relationship between the microstructure gradient and mass transport properties of the <b>surface</b> <b>zone</b> was established. (d) The use of CPF resulted in a significant reduction in porosity of both the cement paste matrix and the aggregate/cement paste transition zone, and a marked improvement in the resistance of the <b>surface</b> <b>zone</b> to carbonation and the ingress of chloride ions. (e) The ECR treatment resulted in a marked densification of the pore structure and in changes to the pore solution chemistry and the cement phases of near-surface and steel/cement paste transition zones. This effect was more pronounced with current density, period of treatment and particularly with the use of sodium phosphate as an electrolyte...|$|R

40|$|Temperature plays a {{major role}} in {{detecting}} climate change brought about by urbanisation and industrialisation. Most climatic impact studies rely on changes in the average values of meteorological variables such as temperature. This paper attempts to study the temporal changes in the mean value of the <b>air</b> <b>surface</b> temperature over Jakarta city during the last century, specifically in the period 1901 – 2002. The data used in this study were taken from the Jakarta Climatology Station because they are of are good quality, there are extensive records and there is little missing or blank data.

40|$|Graduation date: 2017 This {{study was}} to develop and {{evaluate}} a shirt pattern for a wheelchair tennis player to improve comfort using reducing garment strain using a CAD program. For that, seven body movements related to garment strain during play were analyzed. In order to develop a pattern, a morphological matrix was used to generate a pattern design concept. In the morphological matrix, the tennis shirt patterns were deconstructed and each was named as function and each function had potential pattern making solutions, including the <b>surface</b> <b>zone</b> methods, structural lines development, and wearing eases development. The <b>surface</b> <b>zones</b> {{in the present study}} were calculated to explain the bodice subdivided zones to develop 2 D patterns that apply to each surface of the 3 D avatars. The structural lines utilized to adjust a tennis shirt block pattern in this study. Also, the wearing eases development was managed at the grade points of the pattern to provide ease by using the change of length. Based on the possible solutions, patterns were adjusted to meet the garment comfort aspect for each function of pattern on the 3 D avatars. In this study, 3 D body scanner was used to create 3 D avatars with postures based on the determined body movements. The drafted pattern was used to drape the virtual garments on the each movement of 3 D avatars in the CAD program, and then the stain areas of the pattern design were identified using the tension map. In all of the movements, the majority of garment strain appeared on the shoulder surface and around the neck as the bodice shoulder angle function. The majority of other strain found was on the shoulder blade as the bodice bust function during movements in the forehand swing, backhand swing, serve toss, and serve follow through postures. The first pattern was developed to release garment strain on the shoulder <b>surface</b> <b>zones</b> as the shoulder structural line was spread in a parallel way and the shoulder point was expanded. Since the strain was decreased significantly in both forehand movements on the shoulder <b>surface</b> <b>zone,</b> the first pattern can be effectively applied to the bodice shoulder angle function. The second pattern was constructed to release the other maximized strain on the back <b>surface</b> <b>zone</b> of the shoulder blade. The result of the second pattern was shown that the strain relatively decreased with forehand swing, backhand swing, serve toss, and serve follow through postures. Based on the results of this study, it should be noted that the shoulder and the shoulder blade areas are important during development of patterns, in terms of decreasing strain for comfort during movements. Also, for the wheelchair users during play, the movements affecting the shoulder blade, such as back swing posture and serve toss posture, are more effective for reducing strain...|$|R
