5|$|Government {{policies}} shifted dramatically after 1965, {{becoming more}} favorable to economic expansion. In {{an effort to}} rehabilitate the economy, the government turned to those who possessed the capability to invest and expand corporate activity. Ethnic Chinese capitalists, called the , were supported by the military, which emerged as the dominant political force after 1965. Indigenous businessmen once again demanded greater investment support from {{the government in the}} 1970s, but legislative efforts failed to reduce ethnic Chinese dominance. In a 1995 study published by the East Asia <b>Analytical</b> <b>Unit</b> of Australia's Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, approximately 73 percent of the market capitalization value of publicly listed companies (excluding foreign and state-owned companies) were owned by Chinese Indonesians. Additionally, they owned 68 percent of the top 300 conglomerates and nine of the top ten private sector groups at the end of 1993. This figure propagated the general belief that ethnic Chinese—then estimated at 3 percent of the population—controlled 70 percent of the economy. Although the accuracy of this figure was disputed, it was evident that a wealth disparity existed along ethnic boundaries. The image of an economically powerful ethnic Chinese community was further fostered by the government through its inability to dissociate itself from the patronage networks. The Hokchia group dominated the ethnic Chinese business scene during the Suharto government, although other groups emerged after 1998.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{the present}} study was to {{evaluate}} the use of different <b>analytical</b> <b>units</b> and the influence of storage under refrigeration on the detection of Salmonella sp. in naturally contaminated poultry carcasses. One hundred and thirty samples were collected during the production process soon after chilling (postchiller phase). Fifty-five samples were analyzed in up to 2 h after collection and 65 samples were analyzed after 72 h of storage. Pathogen screening was based on three different <b>analytical</b> <b>units</b> and a comparison was made between them. Carcasses were initially rinsed with 400 mL of diluent, and three different <b>analytical</b> <b>units</b> were incubated: total rinsing volume (TRV), a single 30 mL aliquot of the rinsing volume, and 25 g of skin from different areas of the carcass. Of all samples analyzed, 60 % were positive for Salmonella sp. From the samples collected at the post-chiller phase, 57 % were positive for the pathogen and 52. 31 % of these were detected by TRV; a better statistical performance (P 0. 05). There were no significant differences between the number of positive samples from the post-chiller phase and after 72 h of refrigeration. It was also seen that the use of different <b>analytical</b> <b>units</b> (one for the post-chiller phase and another for the refrigerated samples) in samples coming from the same production lot may give different results...|$|R

This approach is demonstrated by using the primary respondents in the Divorce in Flanders study, which is a typical example of a dyadic multi-actor design. Five sets of weighting coefficients are made available whereby different subsets of data, according to different <b>analytical</b> <b>units,</b> are selected: the subset of the dyads, the subset {{of men and women}} respectively, and two subsets of marriages. Post-stratification – with the year of marriage, status of the reference marriage at the sampling date and five-year divorce cohort as auxiliary variables – was chosen as the weighting adjustment technique...|$|R

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{examines the}} archeology of inland southeast Texas during the Ceramic and Historic periods (ca. A. D. 400 - A. D. 1850). Previous investigations, prehistory and ethnohistoric data regarding {{the region are}} reviewed. Archeological theory on hunter-gatherer groups in general and pertaining to the Study Area is synthesized. The Mossy Grove Model of long-term hunter-gatherer adaptation is generated to {{provide a framework for}} the analysis of archeological remains from the region. This model outlines the general nature of the operating settlement and subsistence system and the process of ethnic boundary formation in the region. The model specifies that sites of the region may productively be compared on the basis of geographical <b>analytical</b> <b>units</b> based on major and minor stream drainages in the region. It also establishes a trimodal classification of archeological sites and discusses the implications of archeological data for categorization of prehistoric groups on the forager-collector continuum. The balance of the dissertation is given to establishing justifications for the <b>analytical</b> <b>units</b> employed, tests of the implications of the Mossy Grove Model through comparative studies and through the detailed examination of three exemplary sites within the Study Area...|$|R
