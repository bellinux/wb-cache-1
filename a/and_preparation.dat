5|$|It {{was during}} this period that the Soviets started to assert {{themselves}} in several new theaters of action, in particular through Cuban proxies during the Angolan Civil War starting in 1975 and the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan in 1979.

The new Soviet actions revealed that the military lacked capability outside these narrow confines.|$|E

5|$|Access to {{the temple}} was located in the {{south-east}} corner of the enclosure wall. The entrance led to an open courtyard that stretched from east to west. The ritual cleaning <b>and</b> <b>preparation</b> of the offerings took place here. Because of the extensive degradation suffered by the temple, reconstruction attempts are somewhat speculative. From the ruins, archaeologists propose that the temple comprised an open colonnade, possibly made of granite, a sacrificial chapel adjoining the pyramid side, three statue niches and a few magazine chambers. No traces of a cult pyramid were found onsite. In {{the halls of the}} temple were depictions of animal processions and offerings carriers moving towards the Shrine of the Queen.|$|E

5|$|Brown's main {{contribution}} to the game, however, was not {{to the development of}} new plays but to the organization and administration of teams. Before Brown, football was seen as a chaotic affair where winning was a product mostly of physical prowess. Few coaches took strategy <b>and</b> <b>preparation</b> seriously. Brown, by contrast, hired a full-time staff of assistants, tested his players on their intelligence and their knowledge of plays, instituted strict organization of practices and analyzed game film to get an edge on opponents. Brown created a detailed system for scouting college talent as a means to improve the Browns' college draft.|$|E

5|$|In 1934 Marcinkus was {{transferred}} to the air reconnaissance department, there he started improving his expertise in independent flying, mapping, photography, and weapon systems. 1934 proved to be a challenging year for Marcinkus. Antanas Gustaitis, a prominent Lithuanian aircraft constructor and commander of Lithuanian Military Aviation, invited Marcinkus to participate in a trans-European flight, along with Jonas Liorentas, Juozas Namikas, Jonas Mikėnas, and Kazys Rimkevičius. After detailed planning <b>and</b> <b>preparation,</b> the trans-European flight was begun in the same year. During the 25 days of their flight, the pilots flew three of Gustaitis' designed aircraft, the ANBO IVs, over 10,000 kilometers and visited 12 European capitals. The Lithuanian pilots were warmly welcomed in the countries they visited. They were received by the British Royal Family and the Italian dictator Benito Mussolini.|$|E

In the cramped quarters of the boat, all the equipment had {{to be set up}} and stowed each time the boat moved to a new anchorage, which made the work of cataloguing and processing the specimens doubly arduous.|$|E

The film consists of Jackson rehearsing musical numbers, directing his team, and additional behind-the-scenes footage including dancer auditions and costume design. Ortega confirmed that none of the footage was originally intended for release, but after Jackson's death it was agreed that the film be made.

5|$|Numerous {{tropical}} cyclone warnings and watches were issued for areas along the East Coast of the United States. A {{state of emergency}} was declared for 26North Carolina counties, and both mandatory and voluntary evacuations were imposed along the state's coast. Several hundred government personnel were deployed to assist in evacuation <b>and</b> <b>preparation</b> efforts, along with heavy equipment capable of removing sand and debris. Due to the hurricane's timing, many Independence Day activities in the U.S. were cancelled or rescheduled. Damage was limited to strewn debris and inundated roads, and though 44,000power outages were reported and widespread flooding occurred along northern sections of the coast, no deaths or serious injuries were reported. In New England, Arthur brought flash flooding and caused additional power outages, resulting in widespread road closures and suspension of ferry service. Losses in the country amounted to US$3.25million.|$|E
