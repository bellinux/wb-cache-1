40|$|Northern Ghana {{is noted}} for {{perennial}} low and varying agricultural production {{and this is}} manifest by persistent vulnerability of inhabitants (mostly farmers) to food insecurity. The low agricultural production {{has been linked to}} effects of climate change. New technologies and cultivation practices aimed at enabling farmers to maximise their production to reduce risks associated with changes in climatic conditions in agriculture have been introduced in Northern Ghana. The nagging question is ‘“what influences the adaptive capacities of farmers to innovations introduced to them with the advent of climate variability’? This study has therefore been motivated by the interest in finding the determinants of adaptive capacity of farmers to various innovations targeted at adaptation to climate change and variability. The influence of education on the adaptive capacity of farmers to dugout construction and improvement suggest education will only make a difference for those with low adaptive capacity. This result, which also holds for the innovation on organic matter and composting, suggests that there is a threshold below which education or access to financial services exerts a positive influence on a farmer’s adaptive capacity. Technology appears to widen the gap between the different adaptive <b>capacity</b> <b>categories</b> of farm households. ...|$|R

Though not limited to high school students, we will discuss the curriculum that we use when teaching high school students and other relative newcomers to the con-cepts of cybersecurity and digital forensics. Digital forensics is a relatively low-cost entry point to teaching new students about the field of cybersecurity and this makes it a great place for interested students to start. We combine freely available tools and operating systems with hands-on collab-orative experience to reinforce discussions about various as-pects of digital forensics and cybersecurity in general.

40|$|The European Union has set {{targets and}} obliged its {{member states to}} {{generate}} {{twenty percent of the}} energy consumption in 2020 by renewable energy resources. The contribution of the Netherlands is limited to a share of fourteen percent in 2020, but the Dutch government aims to achieve twenty percent despite of its share in the Union’s obligation. The Dutch government relies heavily on wind energy to reach the renewable energy target. Aim for the onshore installed capacity is 4, 000 MW in 2020 and the offshore capacity target is 6, 000 MW in 2020. In order to reach these targets, the so-called SDE subsidy mechanism exists. The regulation subsidises the financial gap of wind projects. It is unsure whether this SDE regulation, offers enough support to achieve the above targets. The main research question of this study was formulated as follows: Is it possible for the Dutch government to meet the 2020 targets for wind energy, {{as a part of the}} renewable energy targets, with the current SDE regulation or should the regulation be altered to create an improved contribution of wind energy? To answer this question, several sub questions were formulated concerning cost developments, capacity developments, and possible supporting subsidy strategies and the implementation of other policy measures. The research questions were answered with help of a specific spreadsheet model. Cost and capacity developments are the main elements of the model. Cost developments depend on learning effects, material costs and economic aspects. Long term expectations of these aspects are combined to sketch cost developments. Together with the electricity price (APX day-ahead base load index), the costs determine the financial gap of wind energy, that needs to be subsidised. A distinction is made between different capacity categories: new onshore wind turbines, new offshore wind farms and repowering. Repowering is defined as a combination of renewal projects for older onshore turbines which are renovated or replaced at the end of their economic lifetime. The <b>capacity</b> <b>categories</b> differ on the cost aspect and required subsidy payments, but also the capacity potential that can be achieved. The results show that in the most favourable scenario, the targets can be reached with an annual budget equal to that of the 2008 budget (€ 800 million). A scenario following a more realistic view on developments learns that the government should reserve € 1. 5 billion per year until 2020 in order to reach an installed capacity of 10, 000 MW. The best way to limit expenditures is to invest in repowering, followed by investments in onshore projects and at last, building of offshore wind farms. The most important parameters are the investment costs and the electricity price. Higher investment costs cause an increase of the expected expenditures that is more than proportional. The electricity price directly influences the financial gap and thus the required subsidy payments. An increase of the electricity price (for instance due to sustainable developments) leads to a slightly more than proportional decrease of the required budget reservations, depending on the cost effectiveness of each <b>capacity</b> <b>category.</b> A recommendation is to start with investments when costs have become low. However, postponement of investment increases uncertainty and brings along the risk that the target capacity is not reached in time. It is recommended that the Dutch government should formulate its targets on the basis of produced electricity instead of installed capacity, especially since the European targets are also defined that way. Furthermore, the development of wind energy should not only depend on the subsidy mechanism and its functioning. The subsidy mechanism must be specific for each <b>capacity</b> <b>category</b> and barriers for each category must be taken away simultaneously. Municipalities have to improve the public acceptance, while the national government can contribute to wind energy development by the allocation of wind locations and the implementation of faster procedures for wind projects. Strategic grid development is an international point of interest to facilitate wind energy. Following these considerations, the choice for large clusters of wind farms seems to be a step forward, but anyway, the government must be willing to – and capable to – reserve a large amount of money. ...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT Civic {{intelligence}} is {{the capacity of}} collectivities – from small informal groups to humanity as a whole – to equitably and effectively address important shared problems such as poverty, bioterrorism, and natural disasters. It’s an abstract concept that can be expressed in policy, art, demonstrations, or conversation. In this article, civic intelligence has been divided into five main capacities: knowledge, attitude and aspiration, organizational capital, relational and social capital, and financial and material resources. The capacities framework is intended to convey a holistic phenomenon in a relatively simple way. While the framework as it currently exists {{can be useful in}} both research and practice, it’s undoubtedly not the last word. The capacities framework for civic {{intelligence is}} more of a springboard for collaboration and action than a strait jacket that imposes inflexible and unalterable discipline.

40|$|This {{paper is}} {{concerned}} with nonlinear symmetric stability problems. For the moist, adiabatic (saturated) system, the authors utilize the ECM (energy-Casimir method) to establish nonlinear stability criteria, which extends the previous work from the dry atmosphere to the moist case and demonstrates the complexity related to the moist symmetric instability problem. For the nonhydrostatic, Boussinesq equations on an f plane with the northward component of the earth rotation (f) over bar = 2 n cos phi which has been utilized to show the importance of (f) over bar term in the mesoscale linear symmetric instability problem, both ECM and the ELM (energy-Lagrange method) are employed to study the "zonal" and "meridional" nonlinear symmetric stability problems. In both cases, the nonlinear stability of the basic states are obtained if the potential vorticity and the vertical component of absolute vorticity of the basic state are positive (for f > 0). In the zonal case, the potential vorticity depends upon (f) over bar explicitly, and this shows {{the influence of the}} (f) over bar term to the nonlinear symmetric stability. In the meridional case the potential vorticity is independent of the (f) over bar term, which implies that the (f) over bar term plays no role in the nonlinear symmetric stability. The upper bounds on the disturbance field to the nonlinearly stable basic state are established, which consists of its initial value multiplied by an amplification factor independent of time. The ELM proposed by Xu is simplifed to be more concise and understandable. The <b>applicable</b> <b>capacity</b> of ECM and ELM is investigated.

40|$|The {{impacts of}} climate change are disproportionally felt across the planet, with small island {{developing}} states some of the countries most at risk. Furthermore, climate change may compound existing problems such as over harvested resources, leading to knock-on effects on national economies. Both direct and indirect stressors may impact communities differently based on their level of exposure to stressors, their intrinsic sensitivity to these stressors, {{and their ability to}} adapt to stressors. This study aims to answer the primary research question: Why are some communities more vulnerable than others? A vulnerability assessment is used to identify both vulnerable and non-vulnerable attributes of Solomon Islands’ communities. Surveys comprised a comprehensive questionnaire to draw inference on each vulnerability category; sensitivity, exposure and adaptive capacity, along with their various components and subcomponents. An analysis of household and community livelihood strategies was conducted to compliment vulnerability scores and provide a deeper understanding of livelihood practises. As is expected of small island states, exposure presents the biggest threat to coastal communities. Within this category, environmental changes and personal exposure from shoreline erosion and safety at sea provide evidence of high vulnerability. Within the sensitivity category, the cultural importance of fishing, as well as attachment to place and fishing, renders communities more vulnerable. Simultaneously, local ecological knowledge and economic dependence on resources other than fishing proved to be resilient attributes by decreasing vulnerability. Low vulnerability scores for the adaptive <b>capacity</b> <b>category</b> were achieved by communities where physical capital, such as community infrastructure, was evident. A lack of both institutional support and bridging of social capital were attributes which contributed to community vulnerability. This study has identified key attributes that have both positive and negative effects on the vulnerability of Solomon Islands communities. Having done this, I have also attempted to determine the drivers that render some attributes more vulnerable than others. It is acknowledged that the drivers of all key attributes of vulnerability is required to determine areas where adaptation plans will be most effective. Importantly, drivers of high vulnerability should not be considered as the primary focus of adaptation planning, but also the drivers of low vulnerability, such as community cohesion, which provide resilience within communities...|$|R
