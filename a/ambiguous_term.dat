It is also often called just upper endoscopy, upper GI, {{or even just}} endoscopy; because EGD is the most commonly performed type of endoscopy, the <b>ambiguous</b> <b>term</b> endoscopy is sometimes informally {{used to refer to}} EGD by default. The term gastroscopy literally focuses on the stomach alone, but in practice the usage overlaps.|$|E
25|$|Bus {{services}} use buses {{on conventional}} roads to carry numerous passengers on shorter journeys. Buses operate with low capacity (compared with trams or trains), and can operate on conventional roads, with relatively inexpensive bus stops to serve passengers. Therefore, buses {{are commonly used}} in smaller cities, towns, and rural areas, and for shuttle services supplementing other means of transit in large cities. Bus rapid transit is an <b>ambiguous</b> <b>term</b> used for buses operating on dedicated right-of-way, much like a light rail. Trolleybuses are electric buses that receive power from overhead wires for mobility. Online Electric Vehicles are buses that run on a conventional battery, but are recharged frequently at certain points via underground wires.|$|E

Wei refers to any intentional or deliberated action, while wu carries {{the meaning of}} [...] "there is no ..." [...] or [...] "lacking, without". Common translations are [...] "nonaction", [...] "effortless action" [...] or [...] "action without intent". The meaning is sometimes emphasized by using the paradoxical expression [...] "wei wu wei": [...] "action without action".|$|E

40|$|Motivation. The UMLS {{has been}} used in natural {{language}} processing applications such as information retrieval and information extraction systems. The mapping of free-text to UMLS concepts is important for these applications. To improve the mapping, we need a method to disambiguate terms that possess multiple UMLS concepts. In the general English domain, machine-learning techniques have been applied to sense-tagged corpora, in which senses (or concepts) of <b>ambiguous</b> <b>terms</b> have been annotated (mostly manually). Sense disambiguation classifiers are then derived to determine senses (or concepts) of those <b>ambiguous</b> <b>terms</b> automatically. However, manual annotation of a corpus is an expensive task. We propose an automatic method that constructs sense-tagged corpora for <b>ambiguous</b> <b>terms</b> in the UMLS using MEDLINE abstracts...|$|R

Another <b>ambiguous</b> <b>term</b> referring to the Second Northern War is the Little Northern War, which however might also refer to the 1741-43 war.

Although it is widely claimed that he took the title Advocatus Sancti Sepulchri ("advocate" [...] or [...] "defender" [...] of the Holy Sepulchre), this title is only used in a letter that was not written by Godfrey. Instead, Godfrey himself seems to have used the more <b>ambiguous</b> <b>term</b> princeps, or simply retained his title of dux from Lower Lorraine. According to William of Tyre, writing in the later 12th century when Godfrey was already a legendary hero in crusader Jerusalem, he refused to wear [...] "a crown of gold" [...] where Christ had worn [...] "a crown of thorns". Robert the Monk is the only contemporary chronicler of the crusade to report that Godfrey took the title [...] "king".|$|E
500|$|Despite the Mayo Foundation's {{arguments}} otherwise, the Court {{ruled that}} [...] "student" [...] was a sufficiently <b>ambiguous</b> <b>term</b> {{to state that}} Congress has specifically addressed the issue. The Court also noted that Congress in the past had specifically singled out medical residents when making exemptions available, which in the Court's eyes made the Mayo Foundation's arguments about unambiguity unreasonable. Therefore, according to Chevron, {{the role of the}} courts should solely be to determine whether the Treasury Department made a reasonable decision—and the Court concluded that the Treasury did just that. In writing for the Court, Roberts stated that [...] "The [...] department certainly did not act irrationally in concluding that these doctors – 'who work long hours, serve as high [...] skilled professionals, and typically share {{some or all of the}} terms of employment of career employees' – are the kind of workers that Congress intended to both contribute and benefit from the Social Security system".|$|E

40|$|AbstractWord Sense Disambiguation (WSD), the {{automatic}} {{identification of the}} meanings of <b>ambiguous</b> <b>terms</b> in a document, is an important stage in text processing. We describe a WSD system that has been developed specifically for the types of ambiguities found in biomedical documents. This system uses a range of knowledge sources. It employs both linguistic features, such as local collocations, and features derived from domain-specific knowledge sources, the Unified Medical Language System (UMLS) and Medical Subject Headings (MeSH). This system is applied to three types of ambiguities found in Medline abstracts: <b>ambiguous</b> <b>terms,</b> abbreviations with multiple expansions and names that are ambiguous between genes. The WSD system {{is applied to the}} standard NLM-WSD data set, which consists of <b>ambiguous</b> <b>terms</b> from Medline abstracts, and was found to perform well in comparison with previously reported results. The system’s performance and the contribution of each knowledge source depends upon the type of lexical ambiguity. 87. 9 % of the <b>ambiguous</b> <b>terms</b> are correctly disambiguated using a combination of linguistic features and MeSH terms, 99 % of abbreviations are disambiguated by combining all knowledge sources, while 97. 2 % of ambiguous gene names are disambiguated using the MeSH terms alone. Analysis reveals that these differences are caused by the nature of each ambiguity type. These results should be taken into account when deciding which information to use for WSD and the level of performance that can be expected...|$|R

TermRank achieves desirable ranking of discriminative terms higher than the <b>ambiguous</b> <b>terms,</b> and ranking <b>ambiguous</b> <b>terms</b> higher than common terms.

2500|$|Because of the {{widespread}} occurrence of gap junctions in cell types other than nerve cells the term gap junction became more generally used than {{terms such as}} electrical synapse or nexus.

By tracing nerve development in leeches with gap junction expression suppressed it was shown that the bidirectional gap junction (electrical nerve synapse) needs to form between two cells before they can grow to form a unidirectional [...] "chemical nerve synapse".

A product that has passed its shelf life might still be safe, but quality is no longer guaranteed. In most food stores, waste is minimized by using stock rotation, which involves moving products with the earliest sell by date from the warehouse to the sales area, and then to the front of the shelf, so that most shoppers will pick them up first and thus they are likely to be sold before the end of their shelf life. This is important, as consumers enjoy fresher goods, and furthermore some stores can be fined for selling out of date products; most if not all would have to mark such products down as wasted, resulting in a financial loss.|$|E
