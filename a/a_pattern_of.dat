5|$|When {{cephalopod}} molluscs like squid and cuttlefish {{find themselves}} against a light background, they contract {{many of their}} chromatophores, concentrating the pigment into a smaller area, resulting in <b>a</b> <b>pattern</b> <b>of</b> tiny, dense, but widely spaced dots, appearing light. When they enter a darker environment, they allow their chromatophores to expand, creating <b>a</b> <b>pattern</b> <b>of</b> larger dark spots, and making their bodies appear dark. Amphibians such as frogs have three kinds of star-shaped chromatophore cells in separate layers of their skin. The top layer contains 'xanthophores' with orange, red, or yellow pigments; the middle layer contains 'iridophores' with a silvery light-reflecting pigment; while the bottom layer contains 'melanophores' with dark melanin.|$|E

In 2005, {{it was estimated that}} the register contained a large number of irregularities and erroneous entries. Since then, public attention was directed to the issue by NGOs monitoring elections through roundtables and advertising campaigns; according to GONG—a NGO specializing in election monitoring—although the register was improved, there is room for further improvement. The 2011 census also indicated a large number of voters in the registry who should not be there, leading to claims that up to a half-million voters in the registry should not be included.|$|E
5|$|<b>A</b> <b>pattern</b> <b>of</b> lake cycles {{becoming}} {{longer than}} the preceding one has been noted. Water from the lake {{may have contributed to}} increased oxygen-18 at Sajama around 14,300 years ago, possibly triggered by evaporation. As the lake level dropped, Lake Poopó would have been disconnected first; the sill separating it from the rest of Lake Tauca is relatively shallow. Coipasa and Uyuni would have remained connected until later. Water levels in Lake Titicaca's Lake Huinaimarca were low by 14,200 BP.|$|E
5|$|After commissioning, Schlesien was {{assigned}} to the I Battle Squadron. Her first year of service, 1909, saw <b>a</b> <b>pattern</b> <b>of</b> fleet maneuvers in the North and Baltic Seas as well as the Atlantic Ocean. Her first cruise into the Atlantic was conducted from 7 July to 1 August. Another round of exercises followed in the autumn. The I Battle Squadron was transferred from Kiel to Wilhelmshaven in April 1910. The following month, in May 1910, the fleet conducted training maneuvers in the Kattegat, between Norway and Denmark. For the first time, the annual summer cruise went to Norway. Fleet training followed, and a training cruise into the Baltic took place {{at the end of the}} year.|$|E

5|$|After her {{commissioning}} on 1 May 1912, Oldenburg conducted {{sea trials}} in the Baltic. On 17 July, she {{was assigned to}} the I Battle Squadron of the High Seas Fleet, alongside her sisters. After individual ship training exercises, she joined I Squadron maneuvers and then fleet maneuvers in November. The annual summer cruise in July and August, which typically went to Norway, was interrupted by the Agadir Crisis. As a result, the cruise only went into the Baltic, {{in order to keep the}} fleet closer to Germany. Oldenburg and the rest of the fleet then fell into <b>a</b> <b>pattern</b> <b>of</b> individual ship, squadron, and full fleet exercises over the next two years of peace-time training.|$|E
5|$|As a {{pervasive}} developmental disorder, Asperger syndrome is distinguished by <b>a</b> <b>pattern</b> <b>of</b> symptoms {{rather than a}} single symptom. It is characterized by qualitative impairment in social interaction, by stereotyped and restricted patterns of behavior, activities and interests, and by no clinically significant delay in cognitive development or general delay in language. Intense preoccupation with a narrow subject, one-sided verbosity, restricted prosody, and physical clumsiness are typical of the condition, but are not required for diagnosis. Suicidal behavior appears to occur at rates similar to those without ASD.|$|E

United finished outside the play-offs for the third consecutive season, but manager Chris Wilder was given a further one-year contract in April 2013.

The theory proposes that most evolution is characterized by long periods of evolutionary stability, which is infrequently punctuated by swift periods of branching evolution. The theory was contrasted against phyletic gradualism, the popular idea that evolutionary change is marked by <b>a</b> <b>pattern</b> <b>of</b> smooth and continuous change in the fossil record.|$|E
5|$|In 2009 the Westray Wife, a lozenge-shaped figurine that is {{believed}} to be the earliest representation of a human face found in Scotland, was discovered at the site of a Neolithic village at Links of Noltland near Grobust Bay on the north coast of Westray. The figurine's face has two dots for eyes, heavy brows and an oblong nose and <b>a</b> <b>pattern</b> <b>of</b> hatches on the body could represent clothing. Two figurines were subsequently found at the site in 2010 and 2012.|$|E
5|$|In July 1969 he {{finished}} his last work, a large woodcut with threefold rotational symmetry called Snakes, in which snakes wind through <b>a</b> <b>pattern</b> <b>of</b> linked rings. These shrink to infinity toward both {{the center and the}} edge of a circle. It was exceptionally elaborate, being printed using three blocks, each rotated three times about the center of the image and precisely aligned to avoid gaps and overlaps, for a total of nine print operations for each finished print. The image encapsulates Escher's love of symmetry, of interlocking patterns, {{and at the end of}} his life, of his approach to infinity. The care Escher took in creating and printing this woodcut can be seen in a video recording.|$|E
