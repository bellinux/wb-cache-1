In 1972, the clustering of LEMS with other autoimmune diseases led to the hypothesis that it was caused by autoimmunity. Studies in the 1980s confirmed the autoimmune nature, and research in the 1990s demonstrated the link with antibodies against P/Q-type voltage-gated calcium channels.|$|E

Doctors <b>at</b> institutions including <b>the</b> <b>Mayo</b> <b>Clinic</b> have stated that use of hookah can be as detrimental to a person's health as smoking cigarettes, and a study by the World Health Organization also confirmed these findings.|$|R

5|$|Diefenbaker {{would often}} spend {{weekends}} {{with his parents}} in Saskatoon. While there, he began to woo Olive Freeman, daughter of the Baptist minister, but in 1921, she moved with her family to Brandon, Manitoba, and the two lost touch for more than 20 years. He then courted Beth Newell, a cashier in Saskatoon, and by 1922, the two were engaged. However, in 1923, Newell was diagnosed with tuberculosis, and Diefenbaker broke off contact with her. She died the following year. Diefenbaker was himself subject to internal bleeding, and may have feared that the disease would be transmitted to him. In late 1923, he had an operation <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>Mayo</b> <b>Clinic</b> for a gastric ulcer, but his health remained uncertain for several more years.|$|E
5|$|In 1921, Rollin Woodyatt {{reviewed}} {{the research on}} diet and diabetes. He reported that three water-soluble compounds, Î²-hydroxybutyrate, acetoacetate and acetone (known collectively as ketone bodies), were produced by the liver in otherwise healthy people when they were starved or if they consumed a very low-carbohydrate, high-fat diet. Russel Wilder, <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>Mayo</b> <b>Clinic,</b> built on this research and coined the term ketogenic diet to describe a diet that produced {{a high level of}} ketone bodies in the blood (ketonemia) through an excess of fat and lack of carbohydrate. Wilder hoped to obtain the benefits of fasting in a dietary therapy that could be maintained indefinitely. His trial on a few epilepsy patients in 1921 was the first use of the ketogenic diet as a treatment for epilepsy.|$|E
5|$|In 1990, Wilkinson's wife, Martha, {{announced}} that she would seek the Democratic gubernatorial nomination in 1991. The move was widely seen as a surrogate candidacy so that her husband could continue his administration for a second consecutive term. Her challengers included Lieutenant Governor Jones, Lexington mayor Scotty Baesler, and Dr. Floyd G. Poore, the former Kentucky highway director. With polls consistently showing little support for her candidacy, Mrs. Wilkinson {{dropped out of the}} race in May 1991. Earlier in the year, Wallace Wilkinson was diagnosed with limited-stage Non-Hodgkin lymphoma. This diagnosis was also a factor in Ms. Wilkinson's withdrawal from the race. Wallace underwent surgery <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>Mayo</b> <b>Clinic</b> in Rochester, Minnesota, then received radiation therapy at the University of Kentucky. These treatments eliminated all signs of the disease by 1993, and doctors gave Wilkinson an excellent chance of recovery.|$|E

Limited information exists about the adverse events (AEs) {{associated with these}} injections. The primary {{aim of this study}} is to describe the frequency and type of AEs associated with C 1 â 2 joint injections. The secondary aim is to identify clinical factors associated with the occurrence of AEs of C 1 â 2 joint injections. Design/methods: A retrospective chart review was conducted on all C 1 â 2 joint injections performed <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>Mayo</b> Pain Medicine <b>Clinic</b> in Rochester, MN, from January 1, 2005 through July 31, 2015. AE data were extracted from procedural and post-procedural clinical notes. Analysis was conducted to determine correlations between any AE and demographic and clinical characteristics. Using univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses, associations were determined. Results: From January 1, 2005 to July 31, 2015, 135 C 1 â 2 injections were performed on 72 patients. Overall, at least 1 AE was reported in 18. 5 % of the injections. The most common AEs were post-procedural increase in pain and procedural vascular contrast uptake. There was a significant association between AE occurrence and greater pre-procedural maximum pain score. Conclusions: AEs from C 1 â 2 joint injections occurred commonly, but there were no persistent or serious AEs associated with these injections. The data also demonstrate that patients with higher pre-procedural maximum pain scores are more likely to experience an AE. Keywords: C 1 â 2 joint, facet, injection, adverse even...|$|R

5000|$|Use of {{magnetic}} resonance neurography is increasing in neurology and neurosurgery as {{the implications of}} its value in diagnosing various causes of sciatica becomes more widespread. There are 1.5 million lumbar MRI scans performed in the US each year for sciatica, leading to surgery for a herniated disk in about 300,000 patients per year. Of these, about 100,000 surgeries fail. Therefore, there is successful treatment for sciatica in just 200,000 and failure of diagnosis or treatment in up to 1.3 million annually in the US alone. The success rate of the paradigm of lumbar MRI and disk resection for treatment of sciatica is therefore about 15%(Filler 2005). Neurography has been applied increasingly to evaluate the distal nerve roots, lumbo-sacral plexus and proximal sciatic nerve in the pelvis and thigh to find other causes of sciatica. It is increasingly important for brachial plexus imaging and for the diagnosis of thoracic outlet syndrome. [...] Research and development in the clinical use of diagnostic neurography has taken place <b>at</b> Johns Hopkins, <b>the</b> <b>Mayo</b> <b>Clinic,</b> UCLA, UCSF, Harvard, the University of Washington in Seattle, University of London, and Oxford University (see references below) {{as well as through}} the Neurography Institute. Recent patent litigation concerning MR Neurography has led some unlicensed centers to discontinue offering the technique. Courses have been offered for radiologists <b>at</b> <b>the</b> annual meetings of the Radiological Society of North America (RSNA), and <b>at</b> <b>the</b> International Society for Magnetic Resonance in Medicine and for surgeons <b>at</b> <b>the</b> annual meetings of the American Association of Neurological Surgeons and the Congress of Neurological Surgeons. The use of imaging for diagnosis of nerve disorders represents a change from the way most physicians were trained to practice over the past several decades, as older routine tests fail to identify the diagnosis for nerve related disorders. The New England Journal of Medicine in July 2009 published a report on whole body neurography using a diffusion based neurography technique. In 2010, RadioGraphics - a publication of the Radiological Society of North America that serves to provide continuing medical education to radiologists - published an article series taking the position that Neurography has {{an important role in the}} evaluation of entrapment neuropathies.|$|R
