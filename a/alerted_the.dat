5|$|At {{approximately}} 2:42a.m. on November 18, 1999, the 59-foot high stack, {{consisting of}} about 5000logs, collapsed during construction. Of the 58students and former students {{working on the}} stack, 12 were killed and 27 were injured. Immediately after the collapse, Emergency Medical Technicians and trained First Responders of the Texas A Emergency Care Team (TAMECT), a student-run, volunteer service, who staffed each stage of construction, administered first aid. TAMECT <b>alerted</b> <b>the</b> University Police and University EMS (also a student-run service), who dispatched all remaining university medics, and requested mutual aid from the surrounding agencies.|$|E
5|$|Following the attack, Sakonju judged {{that it was}} too {{dangerous}} to continue the raid as Behars distress message may have <b>alerted</b> <b>the</b> Allies to his force's presence. Accordingly, the Japanese turned back for the NEI that day. The heavy cruisers were again escorted through the Sunda Strait by Kinu, Ōi and five destroyers, and arrived back at the NEI on 15March. During this time, the Behar survivors were held in a small and extremely hot store room on board Tone, and were given little access to food and water, sanitary facilities and exercise.|$|E
50|$|Aircraft {{separation}} is divided {{up into the}} protected zone and <b>the</b> <b>alert</b> zone. In <b>the</b> larger zone, called <b>the</b> <b>alert</b> zone, <b>the</b> system informs the aircraft {{through one of the}} three approaches that an aircraft is in the vicinity. It acts as a flag and merely <b>alerts</b> <b>the</b> aircrew. In the protected zone, the area must remain sterile of all foreign objects. It is the minimum distance anything can approach. <b>The</b> system should <b>alert</b> <b>the</b> aircrew before anything comes close to it, but if it manages to enter the protected zone, aircrew will take evasive maneuver to avoid a collision.|$|R

5|$|The {{prosecution}} {{argued that}} Bamber {{had not received}} {{a telephone call from}} his father, that Nevill was too badly injured after the first shots to have spoken to anyone, that there was no blood on the kitchen phone that had been left off the hook, and that Nevill would have called the police before calling Bamber. They also argued that, had Bamber really received such a call, he would have dialled 999, <b>alerted</b> <b>the</b> farm workers, then made his way quickly there himself.|$|E
5|$|After the attack, the Indians torched {{the house}} and left without attacking other dwellings. The next day, Cooley came back to bury the dead; it is unclear who <b>alerted</b> <b>the</b> salvager's team to the attack. After staying at the {{settlement}} for three days, Cooley went to the Cape Florida Lighthouse. One of the missing slaves appeared, reporting that he recognized the assailants as having been acquaintances of the Cooley family. The slave had heard the Indians ascribing the massacre to an act of revenge for Cooley's having failed to obtain the conviction of Chief Alibama's murderers.|$|E
5|$|After {{undergoing}} trials {{following a}} refit, the Gnat {{met up with}} the Ladybird, who also had a ship's dog. However Judy had to be kept away as while he took a fancy to her, she did not care for him. In the early morning after the Ladybird departed, Judy <b>alerted</b> <b>the</b> ship {{to the presence of}} river pirates who were about to board the Gnat in the darkness. The attack was easily repelled as the pirates lost the surprise element. Several days later, Judy was taken ashore with a shooting party for the first time but she was unsuccessful as a gundog. Throughout her stay on the Gnat, the crew repeatedly tried to use her as a gundog, each time resulting in a failure.|$|E
50|$|The Beijing {{government}} revised their four-color <b>alert</b> {{system at}} <b>the</b> start of 2016, increasing {{the levels of}} pollution required to trigger orange and red <b>alerts.</b> <b>The</b> change was introduced to standardize <b>the</b> <b>alert</b> levels across four cities including Tianjin and four cities in Hebei, and perhaps in direct response to <b>the</b> red <b>alerts</b> issues <b>the</b> previous December.|$|R

5|$|All {{the other}} Channel Islands raids were less successful. In January 1943, Operation Huckabuck, {{a raid on}} Herm, was a failure. After three {{attempts}} to scale the islands cliffs the Commandos finally reached the top, {{but there were no}} signs of any German occupation troops or of the island's population. The next raids were Operations Hardtack 28 and Hardtack 7 in December 1943. The Hardtack 28 raid on Jersey ended in failure when two men were killed and one wounded after they walked into a minefield. The exploding mines <b>alerted</b> <b>the</b> German garrison and the Commandos had to abandon the operation. In Hardtack 7 the Commandos had returned to Sark, but had to abandon the operation and return to England when they were unable to scale the island's cliffs.|$|E
5|$|Both {{the sale}} of weapons to Iran, and the funding of the Contras, {{attempted}} to circumvent not only stated administration policy, but also the Boland Amendment. Administration officials argued that regardless of the Congress restricting the funds for the Contras, or any affair, the President (or {{in this case the}} administration) could carry on by seeking alternative means of funding such as private entities and foreign governments. Funding from one foreign country, Brunei, was botched when North's secretary, Fawn Hall, transposed the numbers of North's Swiss bank account number. A Swiss businessman, suddenly $10 million richer, <b>alerted</b> <b>the</b> authorities of the mistake. The money was eventually returned to the Sultan of Brunei, with interest.|$|E
5|$|In his office, Dumbledore {{explains}} that Snape had understood Harry's cryptic warning, and had subsequently contacted Sirius, learning {{that he was}} still at Grimmauld Place. After Harry failed to return from the Forbidden Forest, Snape deduced where he had gone and <b>alerted</b> <b>the</b> Order of the Phoenix, allowing them to save Harry and his friends. It is revealed that during the Christmas holidays, Kreacher had interpreted a command of Sirius's as an order to leave the house, and went to Narcissa Malfoy, the wife of Lucius, and told them about Harry and Sirius's close relationship; Voldemort subsequently realised that he could lure Harry to the Department of Mysteries by tricking him into thinking that Sirius was in danger there.|$|E

5|$|Nelson and {{the fleet}} {{remained}} in the Mediterranean throughout the summer of 1795. On 4 July Agamemnon sailed from St Fiorenzo with a small force of frigates and sloops, bound for Genoa. On 6 July Nelson ran into the French fleet and found himself pursued by several much larger ships-of-the-line. He retreated to St Fiorenzo, arriving {{just ahead of the}} pursuing French, who broke off as Nelson's signal guns <b>alerted</b> <b>the</b> British fleet in the harbour. Hotham pursued the French to the Hyères Islands, but failed to bring them to a decisive action. A number of small engagements were fought but to Nelson's dismay, he saw little action.|$|E
5|$|Norris {{began to}} plan for the rescue of Walker, still more than a {{kilometer}} behind front lines. Walker managed to evade capture for almost 11 days when on the night of April 18, without FAC coverage, he moved on his own accord and ran into a local villager who <b>alerted</b> <b>the</b> North Vietnamese. They began tracking him and the next morning the FAC saw NVA very near Walker's position. Walker radioed the FAC that rescue should not be attempted because NVA forces were closing in and he was under fire. Bilk 36, a OV-10A flown by FAC 1st Lt. Mickey Fain, reported that Walker was surrounded by more than 20 NVA soldiers and shortly afterward saw his body lying in the grass. Walker's body was never recovered.|$|E
5|$|On July 30, 1864, {{the group}} {{set out from}} Fairmount Springs. Initially they sought a deserter named Silas Karns, but {{they were unable to}} find him. They next sought for a deserter named Wolf instead, {{supposedly}} hiding in the home of a man named Joseph Hess, and then for a deserter named Gomer Smith in Sugarloaf Township, but neither could be located. Finally they attempted to find a man named Thomas Smith, living in Benton Township near Raven Creek. It was in this area that four more people joined the Lincoln Midnight Riders. Thomas Smith escaped into a cornfield while his wife <b>alerted</b> <b>the</b> neighborhood about the arrival of the group. A party of locals arrived, including at least three armed deserters.|$|E

After the Toronto Rowing and Athletic Club protested a questionable penalty call in a Hamilton <b>Alert's</b> victory, <b>the</b> ORFU ordered <b>the</b> <b>Alerts</b> to replay <b>the</b> game on November 23. <b>The</b> <b>Alerts</b> lost <b>the</b> rematch 39-7, mainly because they used backups while the main squad played the Hamilton Tigers in a regularly scheduled match - which <b>the</b> <b>Alerts</b> won 12-8. <b>The</b> <b>Alerts</b> proceeded to defeat the Toronto Argonauts in the Grey Cup the following week.|$|R

5|$|Otto Liman von Sanders, the {{commander}} of the Yildirim Army Group, was forced out of his headquarters at Nazareth during the Battle of Nazareth on the morning of 20 September by elements of the 5th Cavalry Division. He drove via Tiberias and Samakh where he <b>alerted</b> <b>the</b> garrisons, to arrive at Deraa on the morning of 21 September, on his way to Damascus. At Deraa, Liman von Sanders received a report from the Fourth Army, which he ordered to withdraw to the Deraa to Irbid line without waiting for the troops which garrisoned the southern Hejaz.|$|E
5|$|Preneuse {{separated}} in March 1798, carrying messages {{of support and}} 86 military volunteers for the Tipu Sultan of the Kingdom of Mysore, {{an enemy of the}} British in Southern India who sought to form an alliance with France. Lhermitte's instructions emphasised subtlety in the operation, but on 20 April he attacked the British port of Tellicherry and seized the East Indiaman merchant ships Woodcot and Raymond. This <b>alerted</b> <b>the</b> British to Preneuses mission and although the reinforcements were landed safely at Mangalore on 24 April, diplomatic relations between the British and Mysore collapsed, leading to the Fourth Anglo-Mysore War the following year in which Tipu Sultan was killed and his kingdom absorbed into British India.|$|E
5|$|The Second Boer War had <b>alerted</b> <b>the</b> army to {{the dangers}} posed by fire zones that were covered by long-range, magazine-fed rifles. In the place of volley firing and frontal attacks, there was a greater {{emphasis}} on advancing in extended order, the use of available cover, the use of artillery to support the attack, flank and converging attacks and fire and movement. The Army expected units to advance as far as possible in a firing line without opening fire, both to conceal their positions and conserve ammunition, then to attack in successive waves, closing with the enemy decisively.|$|E

5|$|The {{accuracy}} of the Egyptian artillery strikes <b>alerted</b> <b>the</b> Israelis, who attacked the strong point at the pumping station with armor and seized it. Instead of concentrating forces for a counter-attack, the battalion commander used only the forces originally assigned to the strong point in a counter-attack to regain it, which inevitably failed due to the paucity of forces. Meanwhile, the 81st Battalion reached Serabaeum where they established defenses, mainly at a position south of the railway station, at a hill called Orcha by the Israelis. At this point, only these two paratrooper battalions were positioned between Sharon's division and the Ismailia Canal.|$|E
5|$|The lobby guard {{returned}} {{a call to}} the alarm monitoring service, which had called when the alarm initially went off to confirm that there was a fire, but never called the Philadelphia Fire Department. The first call came from someone on the street who saw smoke coming from the building. During the first 911 call, at about 8:27 PM, the alarm company <b>alerted</b> <b>the</b> fire department to the fire. Engine 43 was the first firefighting unit to arrive at the scene and reported seeing heavy smoke and flames in one of the windows. As firefighters started fighting the fire it had grown with flames breaking through windows and lapping {{up the side of the}} building.|$|E
5|$|The {{remaining}} conspirators {{were arrested}} by month's endexcept for John Surratt, who fled to Quebec {{where he was}} hidden by Roman Catholic priests. In September, he boarded a ship to Liverpool, England, staying in the Catholic Church of the Holy Cross there. From there, he moved furtively through Europe until joining the Pontifical Zouaves in the Papal States. A friend from his school days recognized him in there in early 1866 and <b>alerted</b> <b>the</b> U.S. government. Surratt was arrested by the Papal authorities but managed to escape under suspicious circumstances. He was finally captured by {{an agent of the}} United States in Egypt in November 1866.|$|E
