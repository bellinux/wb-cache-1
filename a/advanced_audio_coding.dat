40|$|This paper {{presents}} recent <b>advances</b> in <b>Audio</b> <b>Coding</b> and 3 D Sound Rendering. The techniques described are {{in lines}} with MPEG- 4 requirements and {{have already been}} proposed to the MPEG community. This paper is divided in two parts. On the one hand, a scaleable audio decoder based on an ITU core coder is described. The scheme proposed is particularly attractive since it allows for fine granularity scalability with high coding quality. On the other hand, original and efficient 3 D sound rendering techniques are described. These algorithms combine high quality sound rendering with real time implementation capabilities. ...|$|R

This paper focuses on {{the reduction of the}} dynamic energy consumption in the memory subsystem, starting from the high-level algorithmic specification of the application.

40|$|Current <b>audio</b> <b>coding</b> {{standards}} {{employ the}} modified discrete cosine transform (MDCT) where overlapped frames of audio are windowed and transformed {{to the frequency}} domain. Encoding parameters are chosen so as to minimize a distortion measure subject to a rate constraint. At the decoder, inverse transformation involves additional windowing and overlap-add of frames. An analysis of the time domain error in the reconstructed frame reveals that distortion metrics {{based solely on the}} MDCT domain error are in fact unable to capture the effects of windowing and overlap-add at the decoder. The main contribution of this paper is a modified distortion metric that does capture these effects via modified discrete sine transform analysis. When incorporated into an <b>Advanced</b> <b>Audio</b> Coder the proposed distortion metric significantly improves subjective quality of reconstructed audio.

These included a standard 64kbit/s MP3, a low-bandwidth 16kbit/s MP3, <b>Advanced</b> <b>Audio</b> <b>Coding</b> (AAC), and open source Ogg Vorbis. However, the Ogg Vorbis version of the show ceased to be offered in August 2009 with the AAC and low bandwidth MP3 versions ending in early November 2009. In response, Leo Laporte stated that he was a believer that his content should be made available to the widest audience possible in the format of their choice, as well as philosophically agreeing with the open source nature of Ogg Vorbis. However the time and effort the TWiT Staff needed to encode, upload, and distribute alternate audio formats in the limited time between recording and release each Sunday evening was not justified by the number of people choosing to listen to them.|$|E
500|$|In digital {{television}} broadcasting, {{there are three}} competing standards {{that are likely to}} be adopted worldwide. These are the ATSC, DVB and ISDB standards; the adoption of these standards thus far is presented in the captioned map. All three standards use MPEG-2 for video compression. ATSC uses Dolby Digital AC-3 for audio compression, ISDB uses <b>Advanced</b> <b>Audio</b> <b>Coding</b> (MPEG-2 Part 7) and DVB has no standard for audio compression but typically uses MPEG-1 Part 3 Layer 2. The choice of modulation also varies between the schemes. In digital audio broadcasting, standards are much more unified with practically all countries choosing to adopt the Digital Audio Broadcasting standard (also known as the Eureka 147 standard). The exception is the United States which has chosen to adopt HD Radio. HD Radio, unlike Eureka 147, is based upon a transmission method known as in-band on-channel transmission that allows digital information to [...] "piggyback" [...] on normal AM or FM analog transmissions.|$|E
40|$|Abstract – The storage {{requirements}} in data-intensive signal processing systems (including applications in video and image processing, artificial vision, medical imaging, real-time 3 -D rendering, <b>advanced</b> <b>audio</b> and speech <b>coding)</b> {{have an important}} impact on both the system performance and the essential design parameters – the overall power consumption and chip area. This {{is due to the}} significant amount of data that must be stored during the execution of the algorithmic specification, as well as due to the amount of data transfers to/from large, energy-consuming, off-chip data memories. This paper addresses the problem of efficiently mapping the multidimensional signals from the algorithmic specification of the system into the physical memory. Different from all the previous mapping models that aim to optimize the memory sharing between the elements of a same array, creating separate windows in the physical memory for distinct arrays, this proposed mapping model is the first one to exploit the possibility of memory sharing between different arrays. As a consequence, this signalto-memory mapping approach yields significant savings in the amount of data storage resulted after mapping. ...|$|R
