The main tournament was a single round, all-play-all format, where the uneven colour split was decided in favour of the winners of the Elite Blitz contest (see 'Subsidiary events' below). Sofia Rules and football-style scoring (three points for a win and one for a draw) were used to discourage draws.

40|$|Methods for room {{acoustic}} analysis {{based on}} a single loudspeaker and a single microphone have been extensively studied, both the-oretically and experimentally. Although measurement techniques for acquiring and processing spatial information in a room using ar-rays of loudspeakers and microphones have been recently proposed, the current literature in room acoustics does not describe the use of multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems in a comprehensive manner. The aim of this paper is, therefore, to present an initial the-oretical framework for the spatial analysis of enclosed sound fields using an acoustic MIMO system, {{based on a}} spherical loudspeaker array and a spherical microphone array. The fundamental charac-teristics of the system transfer matrix are shown to be invariant to rotation of the arrays, with its rank dependant {{on the number of}} re-flections in the room.

The first weight gain (150 – 300 °C) was attributed to the oxidation into hematite of the α-Fe and Fe 3 C particles located at the surface and in the open porosity of the alumina grains. The 25 nm hematite particles are superparamagnetic at 250 °C or above. A weight loss (300 – 540 °C) corresponds to the oxidation of carbon nanotubes and graphene layers surrounding the nanoparticles. The graphene layers surrounding γ-Fe–C particles are progressively oxidized and a very thin hematite layer is formed at {{the surface of the}} particles, preventing their complete oxidation while helping to retain the face-centered cubic structure. Finally, two weight gains (670 and 1120 °C) correspond to the oxidation of the intragranular α-Fe particles and the γ-Fe–C particles...|$|E

The methodology project FESTA developed a handbook on how to plan and implement FOTs. This handbook has been extensively used as a guideline in the euroFOT project. However, “the devil is in the details” when implementing e. g. the platforms for data security and analysis in projects which deal with analysis of large amounts of sensitive naturalistic driving data, such as euroFOT. That is, although a guideline such as FESTA is used, how the details are implemented is what makes the implementation a success or not.
