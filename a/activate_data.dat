The purpose of the first project was to implement the Application Control Language (ACL) to <b>Activate</b> <b>Data</b> Acquisition (ADA) and to Inhibit Data Acquisition (IDA) the Kennedy Ground Control Sub-Systems (KGCS) Gateway, to update existing Pad-B End Item Control (EIC) Display to program the ADA and IDA buttons with new ACL, and to test and release the ACL Display. The second project consisted of unit testing all of the Application Services Framework (ASF) by March 21 st. The XmlFileReader was unit tested and reached 100 coverage. The XmlFileReader class is used to grab information from XML files {{and use them to}} initialize elements in the other framework elements by using the Xerces C++ XML Parser; which is open source commercial off the shelf software. The ScriptThread was also tested. ScriptThread manages the creation and activation of script threads.

40|$|Abstract—Fire {{behavior}} characteristics (such as temperature, radiant {{and total}} heat flux, 2 - and 3 -dimensional velocities, and air flow) are {{extremely difficult to}} measure insitu. Although insitu sensor packages are capable of such measurements in realtime, it is also essential to acquire video documentation {{as a means of}} better understanding the fire behavior data recorded by individual fire behavior sensor packages. Therefore, coupling each sensor pack with a digital video recorder for simultaneous recording of video and insitu measurements allows viewing of the fire behavior as flames approach, envelope, and disperse past individual sensor packs. The limiting factor in this process is the amount of recordable digital video tape, typically 60 to 90 minutes of record time. This raises both tactical and safety-related concerns, requiring researchers to remain in proximity to the advancing fire in order to activate the fire behavior sensor and video packages. A new remote trigger that eliminates the need for human interaction in order to <b>activate</b> <b>data</b> collection hardware and video equipment has been designed and tested. This trigger system allows the fire behavior and video packages to stay in “sleep ” mode until a measurable rise in heat flux is detected. The detection activate...|$|E
40|$|The paper {{examines}} the balancing between {{the right of}} access to information {{and the right to}} privacy in the context of online proactive disclosure of personal data. Proactive disclosure is understood as disclosure of information made by public authorities without a request having previously been made for such disclosure. Interestingly, the release upon request of official documents containing personal data normally does not <b>activate</b> <b>data</b> protection legis-lation in Sweden. In the case of proactive disclosure of official documents containing personal data, however, the data protection legislation must be followed. Jonason presents and analyses the legal framework, and shows how it has evolved over time. She illustrates the legal framework through the analysis of cases on proactive disclosure handled by the Swedish Data Protection Authority. In addition, guidelines concerning online proactive disclosure, drafted by the same authority for the benefit of local authorities, are taken into consideration. Jonason is especially interested in the balance-ing between the interest to protect privacy of the data subject and the interest of ensuring openness and transparency, and how this balancing is conveyed in the letter of the law, the preparatory works, {{as well as in the}} concrete implementation made by the Data Protection Authority. The conclusion reached by Jonason is that the current legal framework, constituted by different “layers”, is intricate. Changes on data processing made by public authorities should be expected, however, due to the General Regulation on Data Protection that will enter into force in 2018. This might constitute an opportunity for the legislator to rationalise the current legal framework.

40|$|In {{distributed}} multimedia applications time-dependent data streams are conveyed {{and processed}} under real-time conditions.

In this paper, we propose the activation set concept as a data access abstraction to consume sets of data units from a group of time-dependent data streams having synchronization relationships among each other. The concept supports the consumption of multiple periodic data streams of different rates as well as the integration of aperiodic streams.

Monitoring of the whole process, and in particular of the flow of activation directed by the consumption analysis, yields valuable feedback for the optimum allocation of attention and resources including the selective establishment of useful new memory entries.

40|$|One {{important}} parameter for modelling emitter recombination is {{the surface}} recombination velocity (SRV), which strongly depends on the surface doping concentration and the applied surface passivation. However, for highly phosphorus-doped surfaces with concentrations in excess of 21020 cm- 3, where {{not all of the}} dopant is electrically <b>activated,</b> <b>data</b> is hardly available in the literature. Moreover, the bulk carrier lifetime in such supersaturated near surface regions is unknown. We use an analytical model to describe silicon-nitride-passivated phosphorus-diffused emitters. The model shows excellent agreement with a recently presented numerical solver, deviating less than 1 %. In both cases we apply a Fermi-Dirac statistics correction and account for band gap narrowing to calculate the intrinsic carrier density. Our results from measurements of the emitter dark saturation current density indicate that either the SRV or the local carrier lifetime in the supersaturated regi on are strongly affected by the doping concentration, even if it exceeds the dopant activation limit by far. Assuming only Auger recombination in the supersaturated region, we derive an upper limit for the SRV that depends on the chemical phosphorus surface concentration...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVES AND BACKGROUND: Appropriate {{activation}} of multidisciplinary trauma teams improves outcome for severely injured patients but can disrupt normal {{service in the}} rest of the hospital. Derriford Hospital uses a two-tiered trauma team activation system. The emergency department trauma team (EDTT) is activated in response to a significant traumatic mechanism; the hospital trauma team (HTT) is activated when this mechanism coexists with physiological abnormality or specific anatomical injury. The aim of this study was to compare characteristics, process measures and outcomes between patients treated by EDTTs or HTTs to evaluate the approach in a UK setting. METHODS: A retrospective database review was performed using Trauma Audit Research Network (TARN) and the local source trauma database. Patients who activated a trauma team between 1 April and 30 September 2012 were included. Patients were categorised according to the type of trauma team <b>activated.</b> <b>Data</b> included time to X-rays, time to CT, time to intubation, numbers discharged from ED, intensive care unit admission, injury severity score and mortality. RESULTS: During the study period, 456 patients activated a trauma team with 358 EDTT and 98 HTT activations. Patients seen by the ED team were significantly less likely to have severe injury or require hospital admission, intubation, emergency operation or blood transfusion. Differences in time taken to key investigations were statistically but not clinically significant. CONCLUSIONS: A two-tiered trauma team activation system is an efficient and cost-effective way of dealing with trauma patients presenting to a major trauma centre in the UK...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Risk {{analysis}} {{has been used}} to manage the security of sys-tems for several decades. However, its use has been limited to offline risk computation and manual response. In contrast, we use risk computation to drive changes in an operating system’s security configuration. This allows risk management to occur in real time and reduces the window of exposure to attack. We posit {{that it is possible to}} protect a system by reducing its functionality temporarily when it is under siege. Our goal is to minimize the tension between security and usability by trading them dynamically. Instead of statically configuring a system, we aim to mon-itor the risk level, using it to drive the tradeoff between security and utility. The advantage of this approach is that it provides users with the maximum possible functionality for any predefined level of risk tolerance. Risk management can be framed as an exercise in managing the con-straints on edge and vertex weights of a tripartite graph, with the par-titions corresponding to the threats, vulnerabilities, and assets in the system. If a threat requires a specific permission and affects a particular asset, an edge is added between the threat and the permission that medi-ates access to the vulnerable resource. Another edge is added between the permission and the asset. The presence of a path from a threat, through a permission check, to an asset contributes an element of risk. Risk can be reduced by denying access to a resource that contains a vulnerability or <b>activating</b> <b>data</b> protection measures. We analyze some of the problems that form the algorithmic underpinnings of optimal risk management. ...|$|R
