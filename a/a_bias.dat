Although there are {{attempts}} {{to explain it}} partly with <b>a</b> <b>bias</b> in the radial-velocity detection method and partly with long interactions of a quite high number of planets, the exact causes remain undetermined.|$|E
5|$|Northern mockingbirds {{adjust the}} sex ratio of their {{offspring}} {{according to the}} food availability and population density. Male offspring usually require more parental investment. There is therefore <b>a</b> <b>bias</b> for bearing the costlier sex {{at the beginning of}} a breeding season when the food is abundant. Local resource competition predicts that the parents have to share the resources with offspring that remain at the natal site after maturation. In passerine birds, like the northern mockingbird, females are more likely to disperse than males. Hence, it is adaptive to produce more dispersive sex than philopatric sex when the population density is high and the competition for local resources is intense. Since northern mockingbirds are abundant in urban environments, it is possible that the pollution and contamination in cities might affect sexual hormones and therefore play a role in offspring sex ratio.|$|E
5|$|Lethal {{injection}} {{was also}} adopted {{as a method}} of execution by Guatemala in 1996, China in 1997, the Philippines in 1999, Thailand in 2003, Taiwan in 2005, and Vietnam in 2013. The Philippines abolished the method in 2006, though a bill to reinstate it passed through the House of Representatives and as of July 2017 is still awaiting debate in the Senate. While it is still legal, no executions have been carried out in Guatemala since 2000, and in Thailand since 2009. The United States and China are the two biggest users of this method of execution. The U.S. had executed 1,283 people via lethal injection as of April 2017. The number of people executed annually in China is thought to surpass all other countries combined, though the actual number is a state secret, and the percentage of people killed via lethal injection and the other method of execution used there, firing squad, is also unclear. This alphabetical list features notable cases up to September 2017, and only those where lethal injection can be reliably sourced to be the method of execution. The criterion for notability is an article on the individual in the English Wikipedia, which inevitably causes <b>a</b> <b>bias</b> towards U.S. executions, as notable individuals in other countries such as Thailand and Vietnam may only have articles in their own language. A complete list of all executions in the United States can be found here.|$|E
50|$|All else being equal, an {{unbiased}} estimator {{is preferable to}} <b>a</b> <b>biased</b> estimator, but in practice all else is not equal, and biased estimators are frequently used, generally with small <b>bias.</b> When <b>a</b> <b>biased</b> estimator is used, bounds of the <b>bias</b> are calculated. <b>A</b> <b>biased</b> estimator {{may be used for}} various reasons: because an {{unbiased estimator}} does not exist without further assumptions about a population or is difficult to compute (as in unbiased estimation of standard deviation); because an estimator is median-unbiased but not mean-unbiased (or the reverse); because <b>a</b> <b>biased</b> estimator reduces some loss function (particularly mean squared error) compared with unbiased estimators (notably in shrinkage estimators); or because in some cases being unbiased is too strong a condition, and the only unbiased estimators are not useful. Further, mean-unbiasedness is not preserved under non-linear transformations, though median-unbiasedness is (see effect of transformations); for example, the sample variance is an unbiased estimator for the population variance, but its square root, the sample standard deviation, is <b>a</b> <b>biased</b> estimator for the population standard deviation. These are all illustrated below.|$|R

While agreeing that IQ tests predict performance equally well for all racial groups, Nicholas Mackintosh also points out that there may still be <b>a</b> <b>bias</b> inherent in IQ testing if the education system is also systematically biased against African Americans, in which case educational performance may in fact also be an underestimation of African American children's cognitive abilities. Earl Hunt points out that while this may be the case that would not be <b>a</b> <b>bias</b> of the test, but of society.|$|E

The previous models only describethe high frequency range and accounts only for the quasi thermal noise (QTN) and shotnoise.

The results of the model show that in the low frequency range <b>a</b> <b>biased</b> antenna has lowernoise than unbiased antenna and is therefore to be recommend.
