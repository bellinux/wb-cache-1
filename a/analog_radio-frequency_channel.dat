40|$|Abstract. Providing {{scalable}} {{and efficient}} routing services in underwater sensor networks (UWSNs) is very challenging {{due to the}} unique characteristics of UWSNs. Firstly, UWSNs often employ acoustic channels for communications because radio signals do not work well in water. Compared with <b>radio-frequency</b> <b>channels,</b> acoustic channels feature much lower bandwidths and several orders of magnitudes longer propagation delays. Secondly, UWSNs usually have very dynamic topology as sensors move passively with water currents. Some routing protocols have been proposed to address the challenging problem in UWSNs. However, most of them assume that the full-dimensional location information of all sensor nodes in a network is known in prior through a localization process, which is yet another challenging issue to be solved in UWSNs. In this paper, we propose a depth-based routing (DBR) protocol. DBR does not require full-dimensional location information of sensor nodes. Instead, it needs only local depth information, which can be easily obtained with an inexpensive depth sensor that can be equipped in every underwater sensor node. A key advantage of our protocol {{is that it can}} handle network dynamics efficiently without the assistance of a localization service. Moreover, our routing protocol can take advantage of a multiple-sink underwater sensor network architecture without introducing extra cost. We conduct extensive simulations. The results show that DBR can achieve very high packet delivery ratios (at least 95 %) for dense networks with only small communication cost. ...|$|R
40|$|Despite many {{advances}} {{in the area of}} Underwater Wireless Sensor Networks (UWSN) during the last years, still many challenges need to be successfully tackled before large-scale deployment of underwater sensor networks becomes a reality. UWSNs usually employ acoustic channels for communications, which compared with <b>radio-frequency</b> <b>channels,</b> allow much lower bandwidths and have longer propagation delays. In the past, different methods have been proposed to define how a node must acquire the channel in order to start a transmission. Given the large propagation delays of underwater communication channels, a TDMA-based approach may need big time-guards. On the other hand, the very same large propagation delay increases the occurrence of the hidden terminal problem in a CSMA-based approach. In this paper, impacts of utilization of different scheduling and retransmission techniques on an underwater routing protocol will be analyzed. This analysis, in which energy consumption, packet delay, number of duplicate packets, and packet loss are considered, will be carried out by means of simulation using the Network Simulator 3 and a subset of EDETA (Energy-efficient aDaptive hiErarchical and robusT Architecture) routing protocol recently adapted to UWSN...|$|R

To be transmitdistortion output signal ted wirelessly, a signal can be achieved must be amplified with high fidelity so as to account for attenuation through the channel or propagation medium. The linearity of a PA response constitutes an important factor that ensures signal integrity and reliable performance of the communication system. Unfortunately, PAs are inherently non-linear due to their technology limitations. A significant manifestation of this non-linearity is the excessive distortion of the transmitted signal which can result in symbol recovery errors at the receiving end. Overcoming the PA’s nonlinearity therefore poses a major engineering challenge. A popular approach to PA linearization is to use predistortion [1 - 3]. This concept implies {{the creation of a}} function that represents the inverse of the PA transfer function in order to linearize the overall gain from the input to the output. There are a plethora of linearization techniques that have been reported in literature.

Underwater {{wireless}} communication is {{a rapidly growing}} field of research and engineering as its applications, which were once exclusively military, are extending into commercial fields. The need for underwater {{wireless communication}}s exists {{in a wide range}} of applications including offshore oil field exploration/monitoring, oceanographic data collection, maritime archaeology, seismic observation, environmental monitoring, disaster preventing, port and border security among many others. Although capacity calculations for terrestrial <b>radio-frequency</b> <b>channels</b> have been extensively studied, the literature on the capacity of underwater acoustic (UWA) channels is sporadic with many remaining open questions. Aiming to fill research gaps in this growing field, this thesis makes several contributions to the information theoretical performance analysis of point-to-point and relay-assisted UWA systems. A single-carrier communication architecture and sparse Rician frequency-selective UWA channel with intersymbol interference (ISI) is considered in our work. We assume non-white Gaussian distribution to model the ambient noise and consider Francois-Garrison path loss formula to take into account the effects of environmental parameters such as temperature, salinity, pressure as well as system parameters such as distance and frequency. We develop an equivalent channel model for UWA channel with ISI under consideration and show that the capacity of the equivalent channel converges to that of the operating channel in the limit of infinite block length. Using these results, we first obtain a capacity expression for the UWA channel and demonstrate the dependency on channel parameters such as the number and location of significant taps and power delay profile, and environmental parameters such as temperature, salinity, and pressure. Then, we use this expression to determine the optimal carrier frequency, input signaling, and bandwidth. A closed-form formula for the optimum carrier frequency is further obtained. In the second part of the thesis, we extend our results to cooperative UWA systems and obtain achievable rates of single-carrier cooperative UWA systems with orthogonal decode-and-forward (DF) relaying. We take into account the effect of relay geometry in the derivations of achievable rates, and use the derived expressions to optimize the location of the relay...|$|R

However, as {{the emergence of new}} millimeter-wave technology introduces multi-gigabit transmission over a wireless <b>radio-frequency</b> <b>channel,</b> the borderline between radio-frequency and optical systems becomes blurred. As a result, there come ample opportunities to design and develop next-generation broadband systems to combine the advantages of these two technologies to overcome inherent limitations of various broadband end-to-end interconnect systems in signal generation, recovery, synchronization, and so on. For the transmission distances of a few centimeters to thousands of kilometers, the convergence of radio-frequency electronics and optics to build radio-over-fiber systems ushers in a new era of research for the upcoming very-high-throughput broadband services. Radio-over-fiber systems are believed to be the most promising solution to the backhaul transmission of the millimeter-wave wireless access networks, especially for the license-free, very-high-throughput 60 -GHz band. Adopting radio-over-fiber systems in access or in-building networks can greatly extend the 60 -GHz signal reach by using ultra-low loss optical fibers. However, such high frequency is difficult to generate in a straightforward way. In this dissertation, the novel techniques of homodyne and heterodyne optical-carrier suppressions for radio-over-fiber systems are investigated and various system architectures are designed to overcome these limitations of 60 -GHz wireless access networks, bringing the popularization of multi-gigabit wireless networks to become closer to the reality. In addition to the advantages for the access networks, extremely high spectral efficiency, which is the most important parameter for long-haul networks, can be achieved by radio-over-fiber signal generation. As a result, the transmission performance of spectrally efficient radio-over-fiber signaling, including orthogonal frequency division multiplexing and orthogonal wavelength division multiplexing, is broadly and deeply investigated. On the other hand, radio-over-fiber is also used for the frequency synchronization that can resolve the performance limitation of wireless interconnect systems. A novel wireless interconnects assisted by radio-over-fiber subsystems is proposed in this dissertation. In conclusion, multiple advantageous facets of radio-over-fiber systems can be found in various levels of end-to-end interconnect systems.

However, for propagation through the atmosphere {{the characteristics of the}} optical signal are {{different from those of the}} signals from, e. g., fiber <b>channels</b> or <b>radio-frequency</b> wireless <b>channels,</b> and therefore the error characteristics on these links are also different. For evaluating fading mitigation techniques for optical wireless communications a channel model is needed that can be easily used by protocol designers. Existing channel models for optical wireless communications are based on atmospheric propagation theory and therefore require a deep physical understanding of the optical propagation through the atmosphere. The goal of this publication is to develop a simplified approach for modeling the received power dynamics of the atmospheric free-space optical channel. The proposed model consists of a random number generator and a low-pass filter and is therefore easy to implement and use. This approach is only valid for systems utilizing intensity modulation with direct detection, but this limitation is acceptable since most commercially available systems use this modulation format. The channel model is developed based on the statistics of received power measurements from a maritime-mobile link, a land-mobile link, and a satellite downlink...|$|R
40|$|The {{pursuit of}} dense {{monolithic}} integration and higher operating speed continues {{to push the}} integrated circuit (IC) fabrication technologies to their limits. The increasing process variation, associated with aggressive technology scaling, is having {{a negative impact on}} circuit yield in current IC technologies, and the problem is likely to become worse in the future. Circuit solutions that are more tolerant of the process variations are needed to fully utilize the benefits of technology scaling. The primary goal of this research is to develop high-frequency circuits that can deliver consistent performance even under the threat of increasing process variation. These circuits can be used to build ``self-healing" systems, which can detect process imperfections and compensate accordingly to optimize performance. In addition to improving yield, such adaptive circuits and systems can provide more robust and efficient solutions {{for a wide range of}} applications under varying operational and environmental conditions. Silicon-germanium (SiGe) BiCMOS technology is an ideal platform for highly integrated systems requiring both high-performance <b>analog</b> and <b>radio-frequency</b> (RF) circuits as well as large-scale digital functionality. This research is focused on designing circuit components for a high-frequency wideband self-healing receiver in SiGe BiCMOS technology. An adaptive image-reject mixer, low insertion-loss switches, a wideband low-noise amplifier (LNA), and a SiGe complementary LC oscillator were designed. Healing algorithms were developed, and automated self-healing of multiple parameters of the mixer was demonstrated in measurement. A monte-carlo simulation based methodology was developed to verify the effectiveness of the healing procedure. In summary, this research developed circuits, algorithms, simulation tools, and methods that are useful for building "self-healing" systems. Ph. D...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—We {{study the}} hybrid free-space optical (FSO) and <b>radio-frequency</b> (RF) <b>channel</b> from an {{information}} theoretic perspective. Since both links operate at vastly different carrier frequencies, we model the hybrid channel {{as a pair}} of parallel channels. Moreover, since the FSO channel signals at a higher rate than the RF channel, we incorporate this key feature in the parallel channel model. Both channels experience fading due to scintillation, which is slow compared to typical signalling rates. Under this framework, we study the fundamental limits of the hybrid channel. In particular, we analyse the outage probability in the large signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regime, and obtain the outage diversity or SNR exponent of the hybrid system. First we consider the case when only the receiver has perfect channel state information (CSIR case), and obtain the exponents for general scintillation distributions. These exponents relate key system design parameters to the asymptotic outage performance and illustrate the benets of using hybrid systems with respect to independent FSO or RF links. We next consider the case when perfect CSI is known at both the receiver and transmitter, and derive the optimal power allocation strategy that minimises the outage probability subject to peak and average power constraints. The optimal solution involves non-convex optimisation, which is intractable in practical systems. We therefore propose a suboptimal algorithm that achieves signicant power savings (on the order of tens of dBs) over uniform power allocation. We show that the suboptimal algorithm has the same diversity as the optimal power allocation strategy.
