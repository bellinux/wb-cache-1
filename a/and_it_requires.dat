5|$|Octopus blood {{contains}} the copper-rich protein haemocyanin to transport oxygen. This makes the blood very viscous <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>requires</b> considerable pressure to pump it round the body; octopuses' blood pressures can exceed 75 mmHg. In cold conditions with low oxygen levels, haemocyanin transports oxygen {{more efficiently than}} haemoglobin. The haemocyanin is dissolved in the plasma instead of being carried within blood cells, and gives the blood a bluish colour.|$|E

25|$|Most men, however, {{have only}} one wife, and it is rare {{for a man to}} have more than two wives. Formally, wives join their husband's {{household}} only after the birth of their first child. Women may leave their husbands early in their marriage, before the birth of their first child. After having children, divorce is a rare and serious matter, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>requires</b> the participation of the whole village.

25|$|Cognitive {{skills and}} emotion work skills are {{separate}} but related dimensions for successful job performance. The former includes {{the application of}} factual knowledge to the intellectual analysis for problems and rational decision making. The latter includes analysis and decision making {{in terms of the}} expression of emotion, whether actually felt or not, as well as its opposite: the suppression of emotions that are felt but not expressed. More specifically, emotional labor comes into play during communication between worker and citizens, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>requires</b> the rapid-fire execution of, emotive sensing, analyzing, judging, and behaving.|$|E

25|$|A {{theory that}} speaks to {{the origin of life}} on Earth and other rocky planets posits life as an {{information}} system in which information content grows because of selection. Life must start with minimum possible information, or minimum possible departure from thermodynamic equilibrium, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>requires</b> thermodynamically free energy accessible by means of its information content. The most benign circumstances, minimum entropy variations with abundant free energy, suggest the pore space in the first few kilometres of the surface. Free energy is derived from the condensed products of the chemical reactions taking place in the cooling nebula.|$|E
25|$|Through his {{research}} with the rats, he learned that forgetting was dependent {{on the amount of}} tissue removed and not where it was removed from. He called this mass action and he believed that it was a general rule that governed how brain tissue would respond, independent of the type of learning. But we know now that mass action was true for these rats, because learning to run a maze is known as complex learning <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>requires</b> multiple cortical areas, so cutting into individual parts alone will not erase the memory from the rats' brains, but taking large sections removes multiple cortical areas at one time and so they can forget.|$|E

25|$|In the pre Hispanic period, {{the bark}} was first soaked {{for a day}} or more to soften it before it was worked. An {{innovation}} documented from at least the 20th century is to boil the bark instead, which is faster. To shorten the boiling time, ashes or lime were introduced into the water, later replaced by industrial caustic soda. With the last ingredient, the actual boiling time is between three and six hours, although with set up the process takes anywhere from half to a full day. It can only be done during certain weather conditions (dry days) <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>requires</b> constant attention. The amount boiled at one time ranges from 60 to 90kg with 3.5kg of caustic soda. The bark needs to be stirred constantly. After boiling, the bark is then rinsed in clean water.|$|E
25|$|Most Rashaida camels in Sudan though are {{generally}} considered to be in good health and excellent condition, doubtless because of the ample availability of feed in the form of durra byproducts. Access to harvested durra fields, however, does not come cheaply. In 1989, to keep 100 camels on sorghum stalks from January to July, owners paid about LSd 50 000 (approximately US$4 000 at that time) and a household normally needs to sell three or four camels to pay for this privilege. Additional problems regularly occur just before the sorghum harvest when it becomes difficult for Sudanese herders to prevent their animals from damaging the crop. This is especially so in dry years when natural forage is quickly depleted, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>requires</b> considerable labor to keep the camels away from the fields. The situation is exacerbated by the frequently random spread of cultivation, which often results in grazing areas being encircled by cultivated fields. Punishments levied against crop damage are harsh.|$|E

500|$|Various {{diagnostic}} modalities {{exist to}} demonstrate blood flow or absence thereof in the vertebral arteries. The gold standard is cerebral angiography (with or without digital subtraction angiography). This involves puncture {{of a large}} artery (usually the femoral artery) and advancing an intravascular catheter through the aorta towards the vertebral arteries. At that point, radiocontrast is injected and its downstream flow captured on fluoroscopy (continuous X-ray imaging). The vessel may appear stenotic (narrowed, 41â75%), occluded (blocked, 18â49%), or as an aneurysm (area of dilation, 5â13%). The narrowing may be described as [...] "rat's tail" [...] or [...] "string sign". Cerebral angiography is an invasive procedure, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>requires</b> large volumes of radiocontrast that can cause complications such as kidney damage. Angiography also does not directly demonstrate the blood in the vessel wall, as opposed to more modern modalities. The only remaining use of angiography is when endovascular treatment is contemplated (see below).|$|E
500|$|Galerina marginata may {{be mistaken}} for a few edible {{mushroom}} species. Pholiota mutabilis produces fruit bodies roughly similar in appearance and also grows on wood, but may be distinguished from G.marginata by its stems bearing scales up {{to the level of the}} ring, and from growing in large clusters (which is not usual of G.marginata). However, the possibility of confusion is such that this good edible species is [...] "not recommended to those lacking considerable experience in the identification of higher fungi." [...] Furthermore, microscopic examination shows smooth spores in Pholiota. G.marginata may be easily confused with other edibles such as Armillaria mellea and Kuehneromyces mutabilis. Regarding the latter species, one source notes [...] "Often, G.marginata bears an astonishing resemblance to this fungus, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>requires</b> careful and acute powers of observation to distinguish the poisonous one from the edible one." [...] K.mutabilis may be distinguished by the presence of scales on the stem below the ring, the larger cap, which may reach a diameter of , and spicy or aromatic odor of the flesh. The related K.vernalis is a rare species and even more similar in appearance to G.marginata. Examination of microscopic characteristics is typically required to reliably distinguish between the two, revealing smooth spores with a germ pore.|$|E

2500|$|Choosing the {{smallest}} or simplest possible base cases is more elegant and usually leads to simpler programs, {{because there are}} fewer cases to consider and they are easier to solve. [...] For example, an FFT algorithm could stop the recursion when the input is a single sample, and the quicksort list-sorting algorithm could stop when the input is the empty list; in both examples {{there is only one}} base case to consider, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>requires</b> no processing.|$|E
2500|$|In Gram-negative bacteria, the {{secretary}} pathway {{is very different}} from that of eukaryotes or Gram-positive bacteria, mainly due to the difference in cell wall structure. Trimeric Autotransporter Adhesins use a particular secretion pathway, named type V secretion system (T5SS). Gram-negative bacteria must secrete adhesins, since they have an outer membrane that makes it hard for them to stick to and infect the host. The outer membrane is useful, as it allows the bacteria to colonize, and adds another layer of protection. However, the outer membrane is a barrier for the secretion of proteins, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>requires</b> energy to transport proteins across the outer membrane. [...] Hence, the T5SS pathway overcomes this problem.|$|E

The APA has also raised concerns that the dissemination of test materials might impose [...] "very concrete harm to the general public". It has not taken a position on publication of the Rorschach plates but noted [...] "there are {{a limited number of}} standardized psychological tests considered appropriate for a given purpose". A public statement by the British Psychological Society expresses similar concerns about psychological tests (without mentioning any test by name) and considers the [...] "release of [...] materials to unqualified individuals" [...] to be misuse if it is against the wishes of the test publisher.|$|E
