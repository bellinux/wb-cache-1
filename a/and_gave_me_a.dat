500|$|Gaga {{recruited}} artist Jeff Koons for {{the project}} in early 2013; the two had met previously at a Metropolitan Museum of Art fashion event three years earlier, where Gaga had a live performance. According to Koons, Gaga [...] "just kind of grabbed ahold of me <b>and</b> <b>gave</b> <b>me</b> <b>a</b> big hug around my waist and replied, 'You know, Jeff, I've been such a fan of yours, and when I was a kid just hanging out in Central Park I would talk to my friends about your work'." [...] In addition to Interscope Records notifying mainstream media outlets about upcoming releases for Artpop in July 2013, Gaga announced plans for a multimedia software application which [...] "combines music, art, fashion, and technology with a new interactive worldwide community." ...|$|E
500|$|Former KMFDM member Raymond Watts, {{last seen}} {{contributing}} vocals, programming, and production to 1988's Don't Blow Your Top before starting his own band, Pig, called Konietzko {{and asked if}} he would be interested in working on a small musical collaboration. [...] Konietzko agreed, and Watts flew to Seattle, where the pair, along with Schulz, worked on an EP entitled Sin Sex & Salvation. [...] Konietzko said of the trio's working together, [...] "It was the breath of fresh air I had been hoping and waiting for. [...] This short project took my mind off the problems with the KMFDM album <b>and</b> <b>gave</b> <b>me</b> <b>a</b> welcome change of perspective." [...] Watts then stayed on with the group to begin work on Nihil, which featured a core group of Konietzko, Schulz, Watts, and Esch, along with some input from steel guitar specialist Durante and drummer Bill Rieflin.|$|E
500|$|Before the fight, sports writers {{considered}} Gomez a tough opponent for Khan, {{with his}} [...] "knockout punch" [...] and his success against Alex Arthur in similar circumstances, despite having lost {{three of his}} last six fights. Gomez saw the fight {{as an opportunity to}} reignite his career; in an interview shortly before the fight he spoke of how [...] "his fight really is my last chance to set myself up for life and become known in every household in Britain". At the same time, he reflected on the positive effects of his career in the ring, saying [...] "Boxing kept my feet on the ground <b>and</b> <b>gave</b> <b>me</b> <b>a</b> focus. It's got me through the bad times and calmed me down. If it wasn't for boxing, I wouldn't have my beautiful wife and family". Gomez lives with his wife Alison and their three children in Manchester.|$|E

500|$|Tom Chambers was {{approached}} about assuming {{the role of}} Sam by BBC casting director Julie Harkin, who was also responsible for casting fellow Holby City newcomers Rakie Ayola as Kyla Tyson and Luke Roberts as Joseph Byrne. Chambers has revealed that he sent a video of himself performing a Fred Astaire tap dance routine to over 800 stage and television directors and producers in the [...] UK, explaining: [...] "Julie Harkin in casting at Holby saw it <b>and</b> <b>gave</b> <b>me</b> <b>a</b> call because {{they thought it was}} unusual. Originally I went up for a small role as an American doctor, but after the audition they said come back next week to audition for a bigger part and that was it!" [...] Upon assuming the role of Sam, Chambers revealed that he had once been an avid viewer of Holby City's sister show, Casualty, recalling watching it as far back as 1991.|$|E
500|$|Sutton was {{diagnosed}} with stage 3B colorectal cancer {{at the age of}} 15, and subsequently went through aggressive radiation and chemotherapy treatments. He was declared cancer-free, but a tumour returned behind his knee, which was treated by further chemotherapy. Doctors considered an amputation of Sutton's left leg, but the tumour had already spread to other parts of his lower body. In December 2012, two years after the initial diagnosis, the cancer was deemed incurable after spreading to the lungs and liver. Sutton did not ask how long he was expected to survive, choosing to measure his life in the difference he could make, rather than in time. On 24 January 2014, in a speech at London's O2 Arena, he called his first diagnosis [...] "a good thing. It was a huge kick up the backside, it taught me to take nothing for granted, <b>and</b> <b>gave</b> <b>me</b> <b>a</b> lot of motivation for life".|$|E
500|$|Fellini's {{creative}} process for La Strada started with vague feelings, [...] "a kind of tone", he said, [...] "that lurked, {{which made me}} melancholy <b>and</b> <b>gave</b> <b>me</b> <b>a</b> diffused sense of guilt, like a shadow hanging over me. This feeling suggested two people who stay together, although it will be fatal, and they don't know why". These feelings evolved into certain images: snow silently falling on the ocean, various compositions of clouds, and a singing nightingale. At that point, Fellini started to draw and sketch these images, a habitual tendency that he claimed he had learned {{early in his career}} when he had worked in various provincial music halls and had to sketch out the various characters and sets. Finally, he reported that the idea first [...] "became real" [...] to him when he drew a circle {{on a piece of paper}} to depict Gelsomina's head, and he decided to base the character on the actual character of Giulietta Masina, his wife of five years at the time: [...] "I utilized the real Giulietta, but as I saw her. I was influenced by her childhood photographs, so elements of Gelsomina reflect a ten-year-old Giulietta." ...|$|E

500|$|One of {{the songs}} Carey {{recorded}} specifically for #1's was a cover of Brenda K. Starr's [...] "I Still Believe" [...] (1988) co-produced by Stevie J and Mike Mason. During the late 1980s Starr helped Carey secure a record contract while she worked as Starr's backup singer. In the album's liner notes, Carey wrote {{that the purpose of}} the song was solely paying tribute to her. According to Carey, the song [...] "reminds me of the fact that not long ago I was a teenage girl with nothing to my name but a demo tape, my voice, and my ability to write songs. Brenda K. Starr treated me like a 'star' <b>and</b> <b>gave</b> <b>me</b> <b>a</b> shot." [...] Another song Carey and Stevie J co-produced was a cover of, [...] "Theme from Mahogany (Do You Know Where You're Going To)" [...] (1975) by Diana Ross. The latter song was the third non-original song on the album, and experienced a limited release throughout few countries in Europe. During a press release for the album, it was reported that an exclusive live version of [...] "Hero" [...] would be included. However, the idea fell through and was never released.|$|E

'A bottle of whiskey!' he almost shouted. I clapped my hand over his mouth. News that whiskey was in the camp was likely to cause a raid...

2500|$|At the time, {{there were}} rumors that Polanski and Kinski became romantically involved, but she says the rumors are untrue; they were never lovers or had an affair. She admits that [...] "there was a flirtation. There {{could have been a}} seduction, but there was not. He had respect for me." [...] She also recalls his {{influence}} on her while filming: [...] "He was really a gentleman, not at all like the things I had heard. He introduced me to beautiful books, plays, movies. He educated me." [...] On an emotional level, she said years later that [...] "he {{was one of the people}} in my life who cared, ... who took me seriously <b>and</b> <b>gave</b> <b>me</b> <b>a</b> lot of strength." [...] She told David Letterman more about her experience working with Polanski during an interview.|$|E

[...] Following her hip surgery in February 2013, the singer was forced into a six-month hiatus, during which she studied literature and music with the Haus of Gaga in addition to sharing [...] "creative gifts". This stage allowed her to review and enhance her creative direction, which she admitted to be a meticulous [...] "gazing process". [...] "I have to gaze into the work {{for long periods of}} time for it to be good," [...] adding that upon analyzing her ideas, she received [...] "that wonderful feeling" [...] which told her [...] "that's the one".|$|E
2500|$|In 1950, Goldsmith {{found work}} at CBS {{as a clerk}} typist in the network's music {{department}} under director Lud Gluskin. There he began writing scores for such radio shows as CBS Radio Workshop, Frontier Gentleman, and Romance. [...] In an interview with Andy Velez from BarnesandNoble.com, Goldsmith stated, [...] "It was about 1950. CBS had a workshop, and once a week the employees, whatever their talents, whether they were ushers or typists, would produce a radio show. But {{you had to be}} an employee. They needed someone to do music, and I knew someone there who said I'd be great for this. I'd just gotten married and needed a job, so they faked a typing test for me. Then I could do these shows. About six months later, the music department heard what I did, liked it, <b>and</b> <b>gave</b> <b>me</b> <b>a</b> job." [...] He later progressed into scoring such live CBS television shows as Climax! and Playhouse 90. [...] He also scored multiple episodes of the television series The Twilight Zone. He remained at CBS until 1960, after which he moved on to Revue Studios and then to MGM Studios for producer Norman Felton, whom he had worked for during live television and would later compose music for such television shows as Dr. Kildare and The Man from U.N.C.L.E..|$|E
