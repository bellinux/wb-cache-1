Two radically different current distributions on the antenna are considered and their influences on the antenna impedance are studied. These distributions include a one-dimensional (1 -D) triangular distribution and a three-dimensional (3 -D) exponential current distribution. Balmain analytically solved the first problem. Staras proposed the second one. In this paper, we offer an analytical solution for the second one as proposed by Staras. We compare both distributions and find that impedances resulting from them are remarkably close. We conclude that the impedance of a short antenna, as derived using the quasi-static approximation, is insensitive to the choice of current distribution.

40|$|This thesis reports high-fidelity {{near-field}} spatial microwave addressing of long-lived 43 Ca + "atomic clock" qubits {{performed in}} a two-zone single-layer surface-electrode ion trap. Addressing is implemented by using two of the trap's integrated microwave electrodes, one in each zone, to drive single-qubit rotations in the zone we choose to address whilst interferometrically cancelling the microwave field at the neighbour (non-addressed) zone. Using this field-nulling scheme, we measure a Rabi frequency ratio between addressed and non-addressed zones of up to 1400, from which we calculate an addressing error (or a spin-flip probability on the qubit transition) of 1 e- 6. Off-resonant excitation out of the qubit state is a more significant source of error in this experiment, but we also demonstrate polarisation control of the microwave field at an error level of 2 e- 5, which, if combined with individual-ion addressing, would be sufficient to suppress off-resonant excitation errors to the 1 e- 9 level.

40|$|Analysis and Design of Antenna Probes for Detection / Imaging Applications Ayman Elboushi, Ph. D. Concordia University. As {{a result}} of {{increasing}} international terrorist threats, {{the need for an}} efficient inspecting tool has become urgent. Not only for seeing through wall applications, but also to be employed as a safe human body scanner at public places such as airports and borders. The usage of microwave and millimeter wave antennas and systems for detection / imaging applications is currently of increasing research interest targeting the enhancement of different security systems. There are many challenges facing researchers in order to develop such systems. One of the challenges is the proper design of a low cost, reduced size and efficient <b>antenna</b> <b>probe</b> to work as a scanning sensor. In this thesis, two different technology choices of antenna probes for the feasibility of constructing detection / imaging systems are investigated. The first one covers the Ultra Wide Band (UWB) range (3. 1 GHz to 10. 6 GHz), while the second operates over the Millimeter-Wave (MMW) range. In addition to the development of several antenna probes, two detection / imaging systems are demonstrated and showed reasonably accurate detection results. Three different UWB monopole antenna prototypes, with different radiator shapes (circular, crescent and elliptical) have been introduced. These antennas are designed using a standard printed circuit board (PCB) process to work as probing sensors in a proposed UWB detection / imaging system. In order to enhance the resolution and the detection accuracy of the probe, 4 -element Balanced Antipodal Vivaldi Antenna (BAVA) array fed by 1 -to- 4 UWB modified Wilkinson power divider has been developed. Some successful experiments have been conducted using the proposed UWB detection / imaging system combined with the fabricated antenna probes to detect the presence of a gap between two walls made of different material types, to evaluate the gap width and to estimate the size and exact location of a hidden target between the walls. The second research theme of this thesis is to develop small-sized, light-weight and high gain MMW scanning antenna probes. For the realization of such probes, several gain enhancement techniques have been adopted, including hybridization and a multi-element array principle. Several high-gain hybrid antennas have been designed, fabricated and tested. For demonstration purposes, experiments have been carried out for detecting and imaging a small metallic coin under the jeans layer of a three-layer target emulating a human body’s covering layers. A performance comparison between a standard metallic MMW horn and hybrid microstrip patch/conical horn antenna has been made. The proposed reduced size antenna sensor shows increased efficiency compared with the bulky horn antenna. Resolution enhancement of the reconstructed image of the hidden target is implemented using a new triple-antenna MMW sensor. The triple-antenna sensor consists of three adjacent microstrip patch / conical horn antennas separated by 1. 5 wavelengths at the center frequency for coupling reduction between these elements. The middle element of the sensor is used for monitoring the time domain back-reflected signal from the target under inspection, while the side elements are used for monitoring the scattered signals. By the aid of a special signal processing algorithm, an enhanced image of the concealed object can be obtained by combining the three readings of each point in the area under study. The proposed system shows a great ability for detecting a hidden target and enhances the reconstructed image resolution. ...|$|E

Such systems use safe non-ionizing radiation and have great {{potential to be}} used in several applications such as security scanning and medical screening. <b>Antenna</b> <b>probes,</b> which enhance system performance and increase image resolution contrast, are primarily used in MMW imaging sensors. The unlicensed 60 GHz band is a promising band, due to its wide bandwidth, about 7 GHz (57 - 64 GHz), and lack of cost. However, at 60 GHz the propagation loss is relatively high, creating design challenges for operating this band in MMW screening. A high gain, low profile, affordable, and efficient probe is essential for such applications at 60 GHz.

The results for utilizing proposed 60 GHz probes show success in detecting and identifying concealed weapons and explosives in liquids or plastics. As part of the first research theme, a 60 GHz circular patch-fed high gain dielectric lens antenna is presented, where the prototype’s measured impedance bandwidth reaches 3 GHz and a gain of 20 dB. A low cost, 60 GHz printed Yagi antenna array was designed, optimized, fabricated and tested. New models of the antipodal Fermi tapered slot antenna (AFTSA) with a novel sine corrugated (SC) shape are designed, and their measured results are validated with simulated ones. The AFTSA-SC produces a broadband and high efficiency pattern with the capacity for high directivity for all ISM-band.

In this paper it is noticed that by the use of slotted patch <b>antenna</b> and using <b>probe</b> feed at proper location we are able to obtain better return loss, Voltage Standing Wave Ratio and bandwidth. General Term...|$|R
50|$|Although the {{diffraction}} limit severely constrains {{the range}} of the transmitting <b>antenna,</b> the <b>probe</b> is designed to have an extremely high acceleration of 24 m/s2, so that it can reach a significant fraction of the speed of light within a very short distance, before passing out of range. The antenna uses a microwave lens 560 km in diameter, would transmit 56 GW of power, and would accelerate the probe to 10% of the speed of light.|$|R
