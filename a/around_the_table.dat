It is customary to spread some salt over the bread or to dip the bread in a little salt when passing the bread <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>table</b> after the Kiddush. To preserve the covenant between their people and God, Jews dip the Sabbath bread in salt.|$|E
5|$|Metroid Prime Pinball {{uses the}} basic {{mechanics}} of pinball, complete {{with an assortment}} of typical pinball items including flippers, spinners, bumpers, and ramps. In addition, new mechanics are introduced, such as enemies that wander <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>table,</b> wall jumping, and the ability to fire weapons. The Nintendo DS's touchscreen can be used to nudge the pinball table and alter the ball's trajectory. The game consists of six pinball tables, each inspired by a different area of Metroid Prime. Each table is shown across both screens of the Nintendo DS. Only two tables are initially available for play: Pirate Frigate and Tallon Overworld. After playing either of the first two tables, the player unlocks two more tables: Phendrana Drifts and Phazon Mines. In either table, the player must battle a boss to complete it.|$|E
5|$|The {{first known}} game {{incorporating}} graphics that updated in real time, rather than {{only when the}} player made a move, was a pool game programmed by William Brown and Ted Lewis specifically for {{a demonstration of the}} University of Michigan-developed MIDSAC computer at the University of Michigan in 1954. The game, developed over six months by the pair, featured a pool stick controlled by a joystick and a knob, and a full rack of 15 balls on a table seen in an overhead view. The computer calculated the movements of the balls as they collided and moved <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>table,</b> disappearing when they reached a pocket, and updated the graphics continuously, forty times a second, so as to show real-time motion. Like previous video games, the pool game was intended primarily to showcase the computing power of the MIDSAC computer.|$|E

5|$|English Open: O'Sullivan {{competed in}} the first of the four Home Nations events, the English Open. In the First Round, O'Sullivan {{defeated}} Zhang Anda 4–1. He won despite injuring his ankle prior to the match, and was forced to play in trainers in violation of the player's dress code. World Snooker later gave O'Sullivan permission to wear trainers {{for the rest of the}} Open. In the Second Round, O'Sullivan beat Mark Davis 4–1, compiling back-to-back century breaks of 136 and 134 in the last two frames of the match. In the Third Round, he continued his good form, winning 4–1 against Zhang Yong. O'Sullivan compiled three centuries during the Third Round match. The match was interrupted at the end of the final frame by a female spectator running <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>table.</b> Despite the distraction, O'Sullivan continued playing and potted the pink ball for a break of 129 before he offered his cue to the spectator so she could take his last shot (where she missed twice) before being led away by security. In the Last Sixteen match, O'Sullivan trailed John Higgins 0–1, 1–2, and 2–3 before triumphing in the decider and winning 4–3. In the Quarterfinals O'Sullivan beat Jack Lisowski 5–2. In the Semifinals O'Sullivan scored a 6–4 victory over Anthony McGill to reach the Final. In the Final, O'Sullivan defeated Kyren Wilson 9–2 for his 29th ranking title. During the Final match he compiled four centuries and had a pot success of 98%, missing only a total of 6 balls during the 11 frames played. Altogether, O'Sullivan compiled 12 centuries during the tournament, more than any other competitor. This was O'Sullivan's first victory in a ranking event in more than 20 months.|$|E

I don't care who's who – Catholics, Protestants, whatever. You know people are dying every single day through bitterness and hate, and we're saying why? What's the point? And you can move that into places like El Salvador and other similar situations – people dying.

500|$|When {{production}} first started, Clement and {{his crew}} would spend six hours applying Haley's make-up; eventually, the crew was able to streamline their process. According to Haley, the make-up crew would apply individual prosthetics to him, from his head {{all the way down}} his back, which were glued to his body. The appliances were then blended together to create a seamless appearance. Haley spent approximately three hours and twenty minutes in the make-up chair to apply the prosthetics, each day; on occasion, it would take almost four and a half hours when the crew needed to apply the prosthetic skull cap, which Haley did not need to worry about most days as he was able to wear the fedora hat on top of his head. Haley also had to wear contact lenses, one that was bloody and another that was cloudy, with the latter one making it difficult for the actor to see out of. Haley also had to work on developing Freddy's [...] "voice" [...] for the film. According to Haley, the process of coming up with the perfect voice for Freddy is [...] "this organic process of embodying the character", and not about just [...] "sitting <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>table</b> and going, 'Let me try this voice and this voice'".
