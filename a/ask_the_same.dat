2500|$|Euclid's Elements gave what {{amount to}} ruler-and-compass constructions {{for the five}} Platonic solids. (See, for example, [...]) However, the merely {{practical}} question of how one might draw a straight line in space, even with a ruler, might lead one to question what exactly it means to [...] "construct" [...] a regular polyhedron. (One could <b>ask</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> question about the polygons, of course.) ...|$|E

[...] "Together we must stop the practices that feed corruption or undermine the legitimacy {{and effectiveness of}} national institutions." [...] The international aid is tied to a mechanism that will regularly review how it is being spent, and to guarantees from Kabul that it will seriously take on its deep-rooted corruption problems – what the conference called a roadmap of accountability. Kabul must also demonstrate efforts to improve governance and finance management, and safeguard the democratic process, {{rule of law and}} human rights – especially those of women. US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton stressed the need for reform to safeguard changes achieved in Afghanistan. [...] "That must include fighting corruption, improving governance, strengthening the rule of law, increasing access to economic opportunity for all Afghans, especially for women," [...] she said. A follow-up conference will be hold in Britain in 2014. The meeting in Britain in 2014 will check progress toward [...] "mutual accountability" [...] and a review and monitoring process to assure that development aid is not diverted by corrupt officials or mismanaged – both of which have been major hurdles in putting aid projects into practice thus far.|$|E
2500|$|In 1972, Trevor Nunn {{directed}} an RSC {{production at}} the Royal Shakespeare Theatre, {{as part of a}} presentation of the four Roman plays, starring Colin Blakely as Titus, Margaret Tyzack as Tamora, Calvin Lockhart as Aaron and Janet Suzman as Lavinia. Colin Blakely and John Wood as a vicious and maniacal Saturninus received particularly positive reviews. This production took the realistic approach and did not shirk from the more specific aspects of the violence; for example, Lavinia has trouble walking after the rape, which, it is implied, was anal rape. Nunn believed the play asked profound questions about the sustainability of Elizabethan society, and as such, he linked the play to the contemporary period to <b>ask</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> questions of late twentieth-century England; he was [...] "less concerned with the condition of ancient Rome than with the morality of contemporary life." [...] In his program notes, Nunn famously wrote [...] "Shakespeare's Elizabethan nightmare has become ours." [...] He was especially interested in the theory that decadence had led to the collapse of Rome. At the end of 4.2, for example, there was an on-stage orgy, and throughout the play, supporting actors appeared in the backgrounds dancing, eating, drinking and behaving outrageously. Also in this vein, the play opened with a group of people paying homage to a waxwork of an obese emperor reclining on a couch and clutching a bunch of grapes.|$|E

2500|$|Jemison {{graduated}} from Chicago's Morgan Park High School in 1973 and entered Stanford University {{at the age}} of 16. [...] "I was naive and stubborn enough that it didn’t faze me," [...] Jemison said. [...] "It’s not until recently that I realized that 16 was particularly young or that there were even any issues associated with my parents having enough confidence in me to [...] go that far away from home." [...] Jemison {{graduated from}} Stanford in 1977, receiving a B.S. in chemical engineering and fulfilling the requirements for a B.A. in African and Afro-American Studies. At Stanford, she choreographed a musical and dance production called Out of the Shadows. She took initiative to get even further involved in the black community by serving as head of the Black Students Union in college. Jemison said that majoring in engineering as a black woman was difficult because race was always an issue in the United States. [...] "Some professors would just pretend I wasn't there. I would ask a question and a professor would act as if it was just so dumb, the dumbest question he had ever heard. Then, when a white guy would <b>ask</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> question, the professor would say, 'That's a very astute observation.'" [...] In an interview with the Des Moines Register in 2008 Jemison said that it was difficult to go to Stanford at 16, but thinks her youthful arrogance may have helped her. [...] "I did have to say, 'I'm going to do this and I don't give a crap (damn).'" [...] She points out the unfairness of the necessity for women and minorities to have that attitude in some fields.|$|E
