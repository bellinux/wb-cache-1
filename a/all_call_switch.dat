40|$|AbstractWe study a graph {{transformation}} (defined by Seidel) <b>called</b> <b>switching</b> which, given a graph G = (V, E) and {{a subset}} W ⊆ V of its vertices, builds a new graph by exchanging the cocycle linking W to VβW with its complement. Switching is an equivalence relation {{and the associated}} equivalence classes are <b>called</b> <b>switching</b> classes. A switching class is perfect if it contains only perfect graphs. We show that a switching class is perfect {{if and only if}} some graph in the class is P 4 -free, and that whether a graph belongs to such a class can be determined in polynomial time. We also show that a graph belongs to a perfect switching class if and only if it contains no C 5, bull, gem or anti-gem as an induced subgraph...|$|R
50|$|TSAPI, {{short for}} Telephony Server Application Programming Interface, was a {{computer}} telephony integration standard developed and promoted by Novell and AT&T. It consisted {{of a number of}} call control commands for <b>switching</b> <b>calls,</b> voice mail and call logging using NetWare servers.

40|$|Power for {{portable}} {{electronic devices}} such as smartphones, GPS navigation systems, and tablets can come from low voltage solar panels, batteries, or ac-to-dc power supplies. Battery-powered systems often stack cells in series to achieve higher voltages, {{but this is not}} always possible {{due to a lack of}} space. Switching convert-ers use an inductor’s magnetic field to alternately store energy and release it to the load at a different voltage. With low losses, they are a good choice for high efficiency. Capacitors connected to the converter’s output reduce output voltage ripple. Boost, or step-up, converters provide higher output voltage; buck, or step-down, converters, described in the AN- 1125 Application Note, How to Apply DC-to-DC Step-Down (Buck) Regulators, provide lower output voltage. Switching converters that include internal FETs as <b>switches</b> are <b>called</b> <b>switching</b> regulators, whereas devices requiring external FETs are <b>called</b> <b>switching</b> controllers...|$|R
5|$|Class {{switching}} {{occurs in}} the heavy chain gene locus by a mechanism <b>called</b> class <b>switch</b> recombination (CSR). This mechanism relies on conserved nucleotide motifs, <b>called</b> <b>switch</b> (S) regions, found in DNA upstream of each constant region gene (except in the δ-chain). The DNA strand is broken by the activity {{of a series of}} enzymes at two selected S-regions. The variable domain exon is rejoined through a process called non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) to the desired constant region (γ, α or ε). This process results in an immunoglobulin gene that encodes an antibody of a different isotype.|$|R
