40|$|In 1958, the New York Convention was {{introduced}} by 24 signatories, superseding the previous international instruments and ushering {{in a new era}} of transnational commercial arbitration. The Convention on the Recognition and Enforcement of Foreign Arbitral Awards, also referred to as the New York Convention (NYC), was created to encourage the settlement of international disputes through arbitration. It has been characterised as “one of the boldest attempts to enhance … arbitration and to achieve unification in state practice …”. This is buttressed by the fact that courts are perceived as having a pre-bias against hearing arbitration appeals. Ultimately, this is rooted in the objectives of the NYC and the courts’ respect for the contractual autonomy of the parties; thus courts exercise their discretion when faced with arbitral appeal. Party autonomy represents the autonomous will of the parties to a contract. However, the mere fact that parties contracted to go to arbitration can then appeal their award in national courts, demonstrates the extent to which arbitration is undeveloped as an independent, alternative dispute resolution mechanism. It is not surprising, therefore, that scholars have voiced concern over continued judicial intervention in arbitration under the umbrella of delocalisation theory. Thus, delocalisation supports the premise that arbitration should be wholly independent. However, without an appeal arbitral body, {{it would be difficult to}} give practical significance to this theoretical view. This raises the question of whether a diluted version of delocalisation, where court intervention is limited by the presence of an arbitral <b>appeal</b> <b>body,</b> is possible, and, if so, which form should it take? As a solution, we consider the possibility of creating an international <b>appeal</b> <b>body</b> modelled upon the international Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID) Additional Facility, which provides for appeal in international investment disputes. Against that background, the aim of this article is twofold. First, it will explore the development of the delocalisation theory with particular emphasis on the theoretical debate for and against continued court intervention. The aim is to find justification for delocalisation by limiting court intervention in arbitration. Secondly, it will explore the scope for reform through the institution of an <b>appeal</b> <b>body.</b> The aim is to consider implementing an international commercial arbitral body to complement ICSID Additional Facility. Last but not least, a circumspect conclusion will be reached in regards to the direction of future legal development in this area...|$|E

40|$|Cassation {{and appeal}} in the {{criminal}} procedure code The subject of my thesis is a cassation and appeal principle used during a criminal proceedings.

The first chapter present the historical excursus of the Czech judicature evolution. It presents difference between civil and criminal law. The second chapter discuss a legal remedy system and is mainly focusing to define terms such as appeal, cassation and revision. The aim is to clarify the legal remedy principles and also to explain the purpose of reviewing procedure during a criminal proceedings with accent to a three main roles of the reviewing procedure: general, immediate and extended which all represent main criminal proceedings principles.

40|$|Understanding public {{perceptions}} of biodiversity {{is essential to}} ensure continued support for conservation efforts. Despite this, insights remain scarce at broader spatial scales, mostly {{due to a lack}} of adequate methods for their assessment. The emergence of new technologies with global reach and high levels of participation provide exciting new opportunities to study the public visibility of biodiversity and the factors that drive it. Here, we use a measure of internet saliency to assess the national and international visibility of species within four taxa of Brazilian birds (toucans, hummingbirds, parrots and woodpeckers), and evaluate how much of this visibility can be explained by factors associated with familiarity, aesthetic appeal and conservation interest. Our results strongly indicate that familiarity (human population within the range of a species) is the most important factor driving internet saliency within Brazil, while aesthetic <b>appeal</b> (<b>body</b> size) best explains variation in international saliency. Endemism and conservation status of a species had small, but often negative, effects on either metric of internet saliency. While further studies are needed to evaluate the relationship between internet content and the cultural visibility of different species, our results strongly indicate that internet saliency can be considered as a broad proxy of cultural interest. </p...|$|E
40|$|The Czech Environmental Inspectorate (CEI, Inspectorate), a body {{established}} by the Ministry of the Environment and led by a director, is divided into directorates, ten regional inspectorates and two branches. The objective of this thesis is to {{provide an overview of}} the activity carried out by the CEI according to Act No. 59 / 2006 Coll., about Prevention of Serious Incidents, as amended (hereafter Act). The CEI has been conducting this activity in cooperation with district offices and integrated inspectorates. Among the main activities of the CEI, according to the aforementioned Act, belong processing and discussing the proposal of a year?s inspection plan, organising inspections, creating the final inspection report, inspecting compliance with provisions of the Act by the operator and in case of identifying failures in fulfilling these obligations, prescribing corrective measures or a penalty. The selected methodology assessed the current status through available materials, in particular valid legislation, annual reports, internal regulations of the CEI and Ministry of the Environment. The practical part is based on the theoretic findings and a survey among the CEI experts engaged in this area. The survey was divided into two individual parts. The first part focuses on finding out expert opinions. The other part is made of a test of experts? knowledge. The area of valid legislation focused on its complexity, division of competencies between integrated inspectorates, the frequency of inspections and levels of penalties. Based on the available results there is satisfaction with complexity of legislation; however, it was pointed out that there is occasional duplicity of competencies of individual integrated inspectorates. The frequency of inspections and the levels of penalties stipulated by law were viewed very positively. Another examined area was cooperation with other integrated inspectorates and district offices during joined-up inspections. The area was assessed by all approached CEI experts as absolutely without any issues. Another assessed item was cooperation with the <b>appeal</b> <b>body,</b> i. e. Ministry of the Environment. In this area there is discontentment for the reason of the <b>appeal</b> <b>body</b> cancelling or reducing penalties. Cancelling penalties occurs for the reason of process errors when conduction inspections or disunity in interpreting the valid legislation. The area of personnel support was assessed as sufficient with a note that with respect to the drop in the number of employees as part of cost efficiencies, there would be a lack of employees. In case of inspectors working under the Department of Water Protection, there were two solutions defined: either leaving the existing status or including this area under the Department of Waste Management where integrated prevention also sits at the moment. The last reviewed area is training of new inspectors and developing the current ones. The area of training new inspectors was assessed as insufficient, in particular its practical part. Therefore, the only possible solution is to amend the methodical instruction to train new employees and include more practical preparation. Another point was developing the current insp ectors. Furthermore, it was suggested to introduce regular re-examining of inspectors, approximately once in two years and always when legislation changes. The last examined area was to assess the knowledge level of experts of prevention of serious incidents. The test contained 15 questions and only ten experts participated in it. The average score of errors was one error per one expert. This result can be perceived as very good and {{it can be said that}} knowledge is on a very good level. In conclusion, it is necessary to add that the CEI operates in the examined area as a body of prevention and therefore its activity in this area plays a vital role in the fight to prevent serious incidents from occurring...|$|E
40|$|Tese de doutoramento em Direiro, apresentada à Faculdade de Direito da Universidade de CoimbraNão sendo um Estado (nomeadamente, federal), a União Europeia apresenta-se antes como uma associação sui generis de Estados soberanos desprovida da competência das competências e de um poder constituinte, atributos que permanecem nos respetivos Estados membros. Nessa medida, a sua instituição jurisdicional - o Tribunal de Justiça da União Europeia - diferentemente do que ocorre com os supremos tribunais federais (v. g. o Suprem Court norte-americano ou o Bundesverfassungsgericht alemão), não funciona (nem poderia) como uma instância de apelo das decisões proferidas pelos órgãos jurisdicionais dos Estados membros; igualmente, não dispõe de poderes que lhe permitam invalidar ou reformular tais decisões, tal como não pode invalidar os atos nacionais que se afigurem contrários ao direito da União. Na verdade, a prossecução das atribuições da União Europeia rege-se pelo princípio da competência de atribuição, que, extensível ao exercício das competências das suas instituições, baliza a atuação dos órgãos integrados no Tribunal de Justiça da União Europeia, de forma a que eles atuem somente no quadro competencial que os Tratados (maxime o Tratado sobre o Funcionamento da União Europeia) preveem. Tal, porém, não obsta a que esses órgãos tenham a seu cargo um {{relevante}} papel na realização da tutela jurisdicional efetiva da ampla legalidade europeia, a qual, por sua vez, se subdivide entre objetiva (ou estrita) legalidade e pretensões de natureza subjetiva (direitos, principalmente fundamentais, e interesses) reconhecidas pela respetiva ordem, sobretudo aos particulares, e cujo respeito é condição da legalidade dos atos das instituições. As ações por incumprimento, por omissão e de indemnização, bem como o recurso de anulação, típicos instrumentos processuais do tradicional contencioso da União, são instaurados com vista a alcançar tal móbil. Não obstante, tendo em conta as limitações decorrentes do referido princípio, os órgãos jurisdicionais nacionais dos Estados membros também desempenham uma função essencial, por ventura preponderante, na prossecução da referida tutela jurisdicional efetiva, tendo sido erigidos em órgãos jurisdicionais comuns de aplicação do direito da União Europeia. Sobretudo através do reenvio prejudicial, mas também mediante o recurso de anulação, do principal órgão da instituição jurisdicional da União - o Tribunal de Justiça - têm emanado vários arestos que enunciaram e delimitaram essa competência, a qual implicou uma alteração no paradigma da atuação dos tribunais dos Estados membros, uma vez que estes passaram a desdobrar-se funcionalmente entre órgãos jurisdicionais nacionais que zelam pela salvaguarda da respetiva ordem interna, e órgãos jurisdicionais da União velando pela proteção do respetivo direito. O presente trabalho debruça-se sobre a temática da tutela jurisdicional efetiva na União Europeia. Sugere-se uma noção da mesma, analisam-se os seus pressupostos e decorrências, apontam-se propostas de melhoramento do sistema de garantia judicial da juridicidade da União, tendo por referência o quadro jurídico-institucional introduzido pelo Tratado de Lisboa, sem ignorar os tratados que o antecederam; comentam-se aspetos dogmáticos bem como questões práticas que, marcadas sobretudo pela chancela do Tribunal de Justiça, contribuíram para o {{status quo}} do tema. Palavras-Chave: Legalidade europeia; direitos fundamentais; Tribunal de Justiça da União Europeia; órgãos jurisdicionais nacionais. Not being a State (namely Federal), the European Union comes forward as a sui generis association of sovereign Nations without {{the competence of}} competences and a constituent power that are attributes belonging to the respective member States. In that regard, its jurisdictional institution - the European Union Court of Justice - unlike it occurs with federal supreme courts (e. g. the North American Supreme Court or the German Bundesverfassungsgericht), does not work (nor it should) as an <b>appeal</b> <b>body</b> for {{the decisions of the}} jurisdictional bodies of the Member States; likewise, it does not hold any powers that allow an invalidation or restructuring of those decisions, as it cannot invalidate national acts appearing in conflict to the Union law. Actually, the pursuit of the European Union assignments is ruled by the principle of power of action that, being extended to its institutions competences, limits the activity of the bodies that are integrated in the European Union Court of Justice in a way they act only within the competence framework that Treaties predict (particularly the Treaty on the functioning of the European Union). However, that does not prevent those to bodies have a relevant role in the fulfillment of the effective jurisdictional protection of the broad European legality, which, in turn, is subdivided between objective (or strict) legality and ambitions of a subjective nature (rights, mainly fundamental rights and interests) recognized by the respective order, mainly considering individuals, whose respect is a legality condition of institutional acts. Infringement actions, by omission or indemnity, as well as the action for annulment that are typical procedure instruments of the traditional Union litigation, are implemented in order to achieve such motive. In spite of that, considering the limitations arising from the above mentioned principle, domestic jurisdictional bodies of Member States also perform an important role, perhaps prominent, in the pursuit of the effective jurisdictional protection, appearing in common jurisdictional bodies of application of European Union law. Mainly through preliminary ruling, but also through action for annulment of {{the main body of the}} Union jurisdictional institution - the Court of Justice - several court decisions have come to the surface and have cited and delimited that competence, which implied a paradigm shift in the action of European Member courts as they started to functionally unfold into national jurisdictional bodies that ensure the protection of the respective internal order, and the union jurisdictional bodies protecting the respective law. The present study approaches the topic of effective jurisdictional protection in the European Union. We suggest a concept for it, analyzing its assumptions and effects, proposing improvements for the legal guarantee of the Union judiciality and having by reference the institutional-legal framework introduced by the Lisbon Treaty, without ignoring the previous treaties; we also comment dogmatic aspects as well as practical issues marked by the Court of Justice, that have contributed to the status quo of the subject.

40|$|Research in {{childhood}} and adolescence clinical population allows {{the analysis of the}} phenomenon in {{the very beginning of the}} disturbance in a population in which the effects of the disordered eating have not interfered in a stable manner the neuroendocrine circuits underlying the disease. The nature of eating disorders (EDs) is a controversial issue. A first approach considers EDs as the outcome of dysfunctions in the neuronal processes related to appetite and emotionality (Kaye et al., 2009, 2013). A second approach explains EDs as the outcome of the interaction between cognitive, socio-emotional, and interpersonal elements (Schmidt and Treasure, 2006; Cooper and Fairburn, 2011; Treasure and Schmidt, 2013). The transdiagnostic cognitive-behavioural model proposes that a dysfunctional system of self-evaluation is central to the maintenance of eating disorders (Fairburn, Cooper & Shafran, 2008). Moreover some authors proposed recently an ‘impulse control' spectrum model of eating behaviour. Notablely, despite its apparent <b>appeal,</b> <b>body</b> weight may not be the most accurate measure to indicate one's position on the spectrum (Brooks, Rask-Andersen, Benedict, Schiöth, 2012). Neuroimaging techniques have been useful tools for accurate investigation of brain structure and function in EDs. Specific findings have been a reduction in total gray and white matter volumes in anorexia nervosa (AN) patients compared with healthy controls or the persistence of the gray matter volume changes when weight is restored. A number of regions in the brain help regulate food and weight and previous studies have reported regional brain abnormalities in patients with EDs (Brooks et al., 2011; Joos et al., 2010; McCormick et al., 2008; Suchan et al., 2010). However, the results from these studies are inconsistent, and there is no agreement upon which regions of the brain are most affected. New studies point to the ways only higher human brain regions like the frontal cortex and insula are implicated in the ongoing starvation of AN. These higher brain regions play a crucial role in emotions, personality, and rewards, all of which are thought to be important in anorexia nervosa. It’s important to remember also that the temperament and personality traits that might create a vulnerability for developing AN should be taken into account (e. g. attention to detail, concern about consequences, and a drive to accomplish and succeed) (Kaye & Bailer, 2011; Lask, 2000). This thesis contains doctoral studies about Eating Disorders (EDs) {{in childhood}} and adolescence carried out in the past 3 years and has been organized in an introduction and in five different studies. The aim of the first study was to investigate the prevalence risk for developing AN in a very wide sample of adolescents 15 - 19 years (17 866 adolescents; 47. 8 % males; data extracted from ESPAD-Italia® 2005 database), obtaining a psychological profile of these at risk subjects, as assessed by the Italian Offer Self-Image Questionnaire (OSIQ). The study also evaluated gender, age, weight, height and eating attitude. The second, third and fourth Chapters described a multicenter national study carried out in 2012 - 2013 in Italy aimed to investigate a sample of patients 7 - 18 years old with an eating disorder to determine if the relationships between Eating Disorders (EDs) diagnosis in {{childhood and adolescence}} key factors and core eating disorder mechanisms are transdiagnostic. A comparison to distinguish overlapping and speciﬁc factors between the various EDs in children and adolescents was performed using principal component analysis. A mixture of transdiagnostic and disorder-specific processes was implicated in the phenomenology of eating disorders in childhood and adolescence; to evaluate more deeply the model, in Chapters three and four – the subtypes of the classical diagnosis of Eating Disorders were taken in account. These sections are aimed to underline the utility of sub typing analysis in the cognitive-behavioral maintaining factors model of Eating Disorders in childhood and adolescence with a focus on Anorexia Nervosa restricting subtype. The fifth and last chapter describes a study that stems from the collaboration with the the National Institute of Nuclear Physics (INFN) and concerns a MRI investigation of brain structure in anorexia nervosa. As findings support the utility of the examination on personality subtypes in EDs research, the section described the preliminary steps towards a study of structural magnetic resonance focusing on restricting-type Anorexia Nervosa adolescent patients. The purpose of this section was to undertake an investigation on whole brain volumes of a sample of 24 AN restrictive type (AN-R) adolescent patients using voxel - based morphometry and compare them with a same age and gender sample of 24 healthy control subjects. Moreover we aimed to relate the exploratory results of whole brain volumes and region of interest (ROI) analysis with measures of key features of AN-R adolescent patients...|$|E
40|$|NORSK SAMMENDRAG: Fylkesmannen er klageinstans for klager etter sosialtjenesteloven. I 2006 behandlet landets fylkesmenn 5351 slike klager. Rapporten omhandler hva slags saker dette er, utfallet av klagebehandlingen, begrunnelser for utfall og tiden det tar fra Fylkesmannen mottar klager til de er ferdig behandlet. I rapporten er det sammenligninger mellom fylkene/fylkesmennene, vurdert ut fra befolkningsgrunnlag, og i lys av tidligere års klagebehandling. Sosialtjenesteloven trådde i kraft i 1993. Klagesaksstatistikken gjelder fra 1995. Antallet innkomne og behandlede klagesaker har gått ned i 2006. Med unntak av år 2000 har fylkesmennene aldri behandlet så få klagesaker etter sosialtjenesteloven. Tre av fire klager gjelder økonomisk stønad. Eksempler på saker om økonomisk stønad kan være klage på størrelsen på stønaden eller mer spesifi kk klage knyttet til boligutgifter, klær, tannbehandling, medisiner, inventar, reise eller andre kostnader. Klage kan også gjelde vilkår stilt til utbetalingen, at hjelpen blir gitt som lån eller at kommunen tar refusjon i etterbetalt trygd. I over ¾ av klagesakene om økonomisk stønad blir det kommunale vedtaket stadfestet. Under 1 / 5 av klagesakene gjelder sosiale tjenester. Saker om sosiale tjenester er i hovedsak klage på omsorgslønn og praktisk bistand, for eksempel at omfanget hjemmehjelp er redusert eller at det ikke blir tildelt brukerstyrt personlig assistanse. Andre klagetema er utilstrekkelige støttekontakt- og avlastningstjenester, eller avslag på dekning av behandlingsutgifter for rusmiddelmisbrukere. I bortimot halvparten av sakene ble det kommunale vedtaket enten opphevet og saken sendt tilbake til ny behandling eller omgjort. Sannsynligheten for å få medhold er dermed langt større for klage på sosiale tjenester enn klage på økonomisk stønad. 85 prosent av klagesakene ble behandlet innen tre måneder. Ved utgangen av året var det 871 ubehandlede saker. Rapporten er primært utarbeidet for at fylkesmennene og overordnede instanser skal ha oversikt over saksomfang og utviklingen på klagesaksområdet etter sosialtjenesteloven. Den kan også være av interesse for andre som ønsker innsikt i dette saksområdet eller som er opptatt av Fylkesmannens rolle som rettssikkerhetsinstans. SUMMARY IN ENGLISH: The Office of the County Governor is the {{administrative}} <b>appeal</b> <b>body</b> for complaints {{according to the}} Social Services Act. In 2006, these offices dealt with 5 351 complaints. This report describes the types of cases dealt with, {{the results of the}} complaints, the reasons for the decisions, and the time taken from when the complaints were received at the Office of the County Governor until {{the administrative}} procedures were completed. The report presents comparisons of the counties/the Offices of the County Governors in relation to the population, and the trends over the last few years. The Social Services Act came into force in 1993. Statistics about cases of complaint are available from 1995. Fewer cases of complaint were received and dealt with in 2006 than in 2005. With the exception of 2000, in 2006 the Offices of the County Governors dealt with fewer cases of complaint according the Social Services act than in any other year. Three of four cases of complaint were about economic assistance. Examples of such cases are complaints about the amount of economic assistance and more specific complaints about economic assistance for accommodation, clothes, dental treatment, medicine, furniture, travelling expenses and other expenses. There were also complaints about the conditions for receiving payment, that economic assistance was given as a loan, and that the municipality demanded reimbursement of social security benefits. In over three quarters of cases regarding economic assistance, the decision of the municipality was affirmed. Less than one fifth of cases of complaint were about social services. Complaints about social services were mainly complaints about economic assistance for carers and practical assistance, for example reduction in home help services and lack of allocation of client-managed personal assistance. Other causes for complaint were inadequate support contact and respite care services, and rejection of application for reimbursement of expenses for treatment for alcohol and drug abusers. In about half of the cases, the decision of the municipality was either revoked and the case sent back to the municipality to be dealt with again, or the decision was reversed. The chance for the complaint being upheld is thus much greater for complaints regarding social services than for complaints about economic assistance. Eighty-five per cent of complaints were dealt with within three months. At {{the end of the year}} there were 871 cases pending. The report is primarily prepared to give the Offices of the County Governors and the higher authorities an overview of the amount of administrative work that is carried out and the trends in the area of complaints according to the Social Services Act. The report is also of interest for people who wish to obtain a greater insight in this area, or who are concerned about the role of the Offices of the County Governors as a body with responsibility for legal safeguards...|$|E

FC Sion also sued SFL and UEFA respectively in the Tribunal Cantonal de Valais and the Tribunal in Vaud, however both actions were dismissed.

25|$|The Professional Standards {{department}} of the force investigate the majority of complaints made against police. However, details of complaints received are notified to the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) which is a non-departmental public body responsible for overseeing the system for handling complaints made against police forces throughout England and Wales. The IPCC may chose to manage or supervise investigations conducted into complaints and may conduct the investigations themselves in the most serious cases. The Commission sets {{the standards of the}} investigation of complaints against police and also acts as the <b>appeals</b> <b>body</b> in cases where members of the public are dissatisfied with the way in which a police force has handled their complaint.|$|R
50|$|On 4 June 2008, a {{decision}} was taken to exclude Portuguese champions Porto from this year's competition, after the club {{was found guilty of}} bribing referees in the Primeira Liga during the 2003-04 season. As a result, Vitória de Guimarães were promoted from the third qualifying round to the group stage, and Benfica from the UEFA Cup into the third qualifying round. After Porto appealed the decision, however, it was referred by UEFA's <b>Appeals</b> <b>Body</b> back to the Control & Disciplinary Body for re-assessment. The meeting to re-assess the situation took place on 16 June 2008, with the decision being reversed and Porto being allowed back into the 2008-09 Champions League. The decision was taken due to Porto's disciplinary process in Portugal not yet being complete.|$|R
