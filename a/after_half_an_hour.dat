5|$|On 24 May 2015, Drogba {{announced}} that Chelsea's {{final game of}} the season against Sunderland would be his last as a Chelsea player. He started the game as captain and was substituted with injury <b>after</b> <b>half</b> <b>an</b> <b>hour,</b> being carried off by his teammates in an eventual 3–1 win.|$|E
5|$|Saien {{was pressed}} {{immediately}} into Japanese service. During the Japanese invasion of Taiwan later in 1895, she was assigned together with six other ships to bombard the coastal defences of Takow (Kaohsiung). The fleet arrived {{off the coast}} on 12 October, warning foreign vessels that the attack would begin at 7am the following morning. The Japanese ships attacked on schedule, firing on the defenses until they stopped returning fire <b>after</b> <b>half</b> <b>an</b> <b>hour.</b> At 2pm, the ships closed {{the distance to the}} beach and began launching boats into the water with troops. Their forces had successfully captured the coastal fort by 2:35pm.|$|E
5|$|On 26 April, Costa {{was chosen}} {{of one of}} two {{forwards}} for the season's PFA Team of the Year, alongside Tottenham's Harry Kane. Five of Costa's Chelsea teammates were also in the selection. Due to injury, he was due to miss {{the remainder of the}} season, in which Chelsea won the league title with a 1–0 home win over Crystal Palace on 3 May. However, he featured in their last match of the season on the 24th, replacing the injured Didier Drogba <b>after</b> <b>half</b> <b>an</b> <b>hour</b> against Sunderland. Seven minutes later, he scored his 20th goal of the league campaign, an equalising penalty in an eventual 3–1 home win.|$|E

5|$|Aerial {{dispersion}} {{is important}} in this species, despite its restricted distribution. Queens never forage outside or leave the nest, unless under severe deprivation. Before nuptial flight, fully developed females start to occur during summer. Between 9 and 10 pm in January, queens and males start to emerge from their host nest and begin to mate. Observations show that the alates will climb up onto objects such as lighted fluorescent lamps and begin to fly <b>after</b> <b>half</b> <b>an</b> <b>hour</b> of endless running. When queens {{are looking for a}} host nest or wandering openly, M. vindex foragers may identify a queen and seize her; such behaviour suggests that workers actively recruit fertilised queens for their nest. Host colonies tend to be smaller and depauperated when compared to other colonies without any inquiline queens, but host colonies can still produce alate offspring.|$|E
5|$|<b>After</b> <b>half</b> <b>an</b> <b>hour</b> the Russians finally {{stormed the}} ramparts of Fort 74 and {{defeated}} the Polish battalion defending it. This forced the Polish mobile artillery in Czyste, until then shelling the advancing Russian columns and their Grand Battery, to fall back. Meanwhile, the Russian right column was approaching Fort 72. Defended by only 200 men, the fort {{was approached by}} the Russian spearhead formed by the reinforced Nieśwież Regiment. Seeing this, the Polish commander ordered his cavalry reserve to charge the Russian infantry. Russian grenadiers stormed the ramparts of Fort 72, but were repelled and forced back behind the moat, where the Polish cavalry charged them. The Russians formed infantry squares, but were defeated and forced to retreat. To counter the threat to Russian infantry, General Nostitz charged his own cavalry reserve under General Georg von Sass, and a cavalry battle ensued.|$|E
5|$|The pair {{launched}} a counterattack, Miller taking the lead. He hoisted off spinner Laker's first ball over the square leg fence for six. Miller shielded Harvey from Laker, as his younger partner was struggling against the off breaks that were {{turning away from}} him, including one that spun and bounced sharply to beating the outside edge. Miller drilled one off-drive off Laker for four, and after mis-hitting the next, much to the amusement of the crowd, hit the off spinner flat over his head, almost for six into the sightscreen. This allowed Australia to seize the initiative, and Harvey joined the fightback in the next over, hitting consecutive boundaries against Laker, the second of which almost cleared the playing area. He struck another boundary to reach 44, while Miller's score stayed on 42. <b>After</b> <b>half</b> <b>an</b> <b>hour</b> of play, the early morning life in the pitch appeared to have died out.|$|E

5|$|Compton and Evans {{continued}} {{to resist the}} Australians on the final morning, the latter being the more aggressive, and proceedings were briefly interrupted by rain less than 30 minutes {{after the start of}} play. At the time, it appeared the downpour might cause the match to end in a draw. <b>After</b> <b>half</b> <b>an</b> <b>hour</b> of stoppages, play resumed and Evans attacked, hitting two fours in quick succession. England's wicket-keeper played Johnston and Johnson confidently, but Bradman nevertheless persisted in giving Compton easy singles in order to bring Evans on strike so he could be targeted. For his part, Compton thought his partner could be relied upon and accepted the runs gifted to him by the Australian captain, while Evans {{continued to}} attack the bowling. The batsmen appealed against the light after the first stoppage of the day, but were turned down. Australia took the new ball, but the home team's batsmen continued to proceed steadily, Evans being particularly aggressive. After a second interruption for poor light, this time for ten minutes, play resumed, and England had added a further 60 runs to their overnight total to reach 405/6.|$|E
5|$|As the new {{ball was}} due {{soon after the}} start of the play, Johnson and Toshack opened the attack as Bradman saved Johnston and Miller. In his first over, Johnson {{extracted}} sharp turn from one delivery that pitched outside off stump; not expecting much spin, Compton did not play a shot and was hit on the pads, but the umpire rejected the loud appeal for lbw. Otherwise, Hutton and Compton progressed steadily before the light deteriorated, although Johnson and Toshack were able to make the ball deviate regularly. Despite this, Bradman opted to have Miller take the new ball in the fifth over of the day {{as soon as it was}} available. Mindful of recent events, Miller refrained from bouncers during the morning. In the overcast conditions, Miller bowled a relatively full length and swung the ball; one of his deliveries beat Hutton and narrowly missed his stumps. At the other end, Johnston was also able to make the ball move sideways. Meanwhile, Compton appeared to be untroubled by the bowling. <b>After</b> <b>half</b> <b>an</b> <b>hour</b> of play, an unsuccessful appeal against the light was made as dark clouds hovered overhead. The rejection of the appeal made little difference, as a thunderstorm stopped proceedings for five minutes soon after. Shortly after the resumption, Miller bowled Hutton with an off cutter in the dark conditions, ending the 111-run partnership at 150/3. Hutton had made 74 runs in 168 minutes with 11 fours, and as in the first innings, he played forward to a ball without getting his front foot close to the bat, resulting in the delivery moving through the gap into the stumps. The wicket prompted the entrance of Hardstaff, and on the third ball he aimed a cut at a wide Miller delivery, and it again went low to second slip as in the first innings. However, this time Morris was in the position and the catch was dropped. It was part of an eventful over during which Hardstaff had many near-misses. He played and missed at one ball, inside edged another into his pads and edged another through the slips for two runs. Hardstaff had a reputation for being an uncertain starter, especially as he had a tendency to poke at deliveries outside his off stump, and the poor visibility further hindered him.|$|E

25|$|The FA Cup intervened {{again on}} 2 December, and Blackpool {{travelled}} to face MK Dons for their second-round tie. Keigan Parker put Blackpool ahead <b>after</b> <b>half</b> <b>an</b> <b>hour,</b> and Andy Morrell doubled their lead {{just after the}} break. Blackpool progressed to the third round.|$|E
25|$|<b>After</b> <b>half</b> <b>an</b> <b>hour,</b> Xavi {{played a}} pass {{in behind the}} Germany back line towards Torres, who outmuscled a {{hesitant}} Philipp Lahm and clipped the ball over the diving Jens Lehmann and just inside the far post. That goal {{proved to be the}} only goal of the game, which Spain dominated despite Germany having the majority of the possession, and Spain were crowned UEFA Euro 2008 champions.|$|E
25|$|Alan Smith {{served a}} lot of bench duty with Cheick Tioté {{cementing}} his place as the inform defensive midfielder. Smith saw a return to action in Newcastle's 3–1 cup defeat to Stevenage on 8 January 2011. With Tioté suspended for three games following his sending-off in the same game, Smith started in Newcastle's 1–1 derby draw with Sunderland, but came off <b>after</b> <b>half</b> <b>an</b> <b>hour</b> with an injured ankle. It was later confirmed it would rule Smith out {{for the rest of}} the season.|$|E

25|$|Meanwhile, the Parliamentarian {{right wing}} of horse under Cromwell and the Royalist Northern Horse faced each other, neither willing to charge {{to the aid of}} their {{infantry}} while the other could threaten their flank. Eventually <b>after</b> <b>half</b> <b>an</b> <b>hour,</b> the Royalist cavalry began to charge and Cromwell's troops moved to meet them. Langdale's men were not only outflanked and outnumbered two to one, but forced to charge up a slope broken up by bushes and a rabbit warren. After a brief contest they were routed.|$|E
25|$|On 14 August, {{the rebels}} {{attacked}} the capital, which was protected mainly by Romanian and Austrian volunteers. The first insurgent attack lasted {{half an hour}} and was repulsed with heavy losses for the attackers. The second attack began after an hour, and lasted also for an hour, before it was once again repulsed, mainly due to the brave actions of the Romanians, who were greatly praised by their Christian Albanian comrades. <b>After</b> <b>half</b> <b>an</b> <b>hour,</b> the insurgents launched their third and final attack, but they were repelled everywhere by stiff Romanian resistance.|$|E
25|$|Codeine is an opiate used {{to treat}} pain, as a cough medicine, and for diarrhea. It is {{typically}} {{used to treat}} mild to moderate degrees of pain. Greater benefit may occur when combined with paracetamol (acetaminophen) or a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) such as aspirin or ibuprofen. Evidence does not support its use for acute cough suppression in children or adults. In Europe it is not recommended as a cough medicine in those under twelve years of age. It is generally taken by mouth. It typically starts working <b>after</b> <b>half</b> <b>an</b> <b>hour</b> with maximum effect at two hours. The total duration of its effects last for about four to six hours.|$|E

25|$|The first {{practice}} session had begun at 10:00 am local time (UTC+2). FOCA teams {{did not take}} part, leaving only the manufacturer teams of Renault, Ferrari and Alfa Romeo contesting. Because of the statement made by RACE, this session was halted <b>after</b> <b>half</b> <b>an</b> <b>hour</b> by the organizers. The Guardia Civil then escorted FISA officials out of the circuit. Practice got underway again at 12:30 pm, this time consisting of all the teams {{with the exception of}} Renault, Ferrari, Alfa Romeo and Osella. Citing fear of further sanctions in other forms of motorsport should they take part in a race deemed illegal by FISA, these four teams withdrew from practice, although all remained at the circuit in case a compromise deal was brokered before the race.|$|E
25|$|Southampton's {{third round}} draw saw the club host Championship side Sheffield Wednesday on 25 September. <b>After</b> <b>half</b> <b>an</b> <b>hour</b> of {{pressure}} from both sides, Jay Rodriguez scored his first goal for the Saints with a shot {{from the edge of}} the penalty area to put the hosts ahead. Following a number of additional chances for Southampton to go two up, the sides went into half time at 1–0. Despite a number of clear cut chances in the second half, it took until the 78th minute for Rodriguez to double Southampton's lead when he converted a penalty following a foul on winger Steve De Ridder. Wednesday increased the pressure in the final part of the match, but were unable to reverse Southampton's win.|$|E
25|$|New Brompton (now Gillingham) {{were playing}} in the Southern League under the {{management}} of former England international Stephen Smith, who was also team captain. In McGibbon's season at the club, New Brompton finished bottom of the table, avoiding relegation only due {{to the expansion of}} the league, but did achieve an FA Cup victory over First Division Sunderland, in which McGibbon scored a hat-trick. McGibbon had previously scored a hat-trick in the 6–0 victory over Shepherds Bush in the fifth qualifying round. In the first round match, played at Priestfield Stadium on 11 January 1908, Sunderland took the lead <b>after</b> <b>half</b> <b>an</b> <b>hour</b> from England international George Holley. New Brompton equalized immediately with a header from McGibbon, who followed up with two second-half goals to claim a 3–1 victory.|$|E
