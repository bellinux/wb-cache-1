40|$|Black {{phosphorus}} (BP) {{has recently}} {{emerged as a}} promising narrow band gap layered semiconductor with optoelectronic properties that {{bridge the gap between}} semi-metallic graphene and wide band gap transition metal dichalcogenides such as MoS 2. To date, BP field-effect transistors have utilized a lateral geometry with in-plane transport dominating device characteristics. In contrast, we present here a vertical field-effect transistor geometry based on a graphene/BP van der Waals heterostructure. The resulting device characteristics include high on-state current densities (> 1600 A/cm 2) and current on/off ratios exceeding 800 at low temperature. Two distinct charge transport mechanisms are identified, which are dominant for different regimes of temperature and gate voltage. In particular, the Schottky barrier between graphene and BP determines charge transport at high temperatures <b>and</b> <b>positive</b> <b>gate</b> voltages, whereas tunneling dominates at low temperatures and negative gate voltages. These results elucidate out-of-plane electronic transport in BP, and thus have implications for the design and operation of BP-based van der Waals heterostructures.

The method used for treatment was the ecclectical — preferred by the A. since many years —, in which he associates electricity with minor surgery, chaulmestrol (pure or with 0. 5 p. c. iodine or 4 p. c. creosote) and other auxilliary curative agents. The chaulmoogra derivatives were used daily as nostrils tamponage (2 p. c. mentholated or thymolated ester), periodically by injections inside the enlarged lymph nodes and nerve abscesses, and twice weekly by subcutaneous infiltrations (MUIR method) 5 c. c. each, and chaulmoogra soap tablets per os. The galvanocauterisation session was once per week, on active leprotic lesions, followed by painting with 30 p. c. trichloracetic acid solution. All 20 patients were bacilliferous before treatment, <b>and</b> became stronger <b>positive</b> after some months treatment.

In 7 cases high Formol-gel were associated with a high sedimentation index. Many cases had very high S.

All patients with more than 12 months treatment became practically symptom free. Lepra reaction amongst them was rare and always started by embolic rash, being controlled by destruction of such skin lesions by galvanocauterisation.

This {{is largely due to}} IGZO’s high mobility at low processing temperatures. In this thesis, IGZO films were successfully grown on polyethylene naphthalate (PEN) substrates by RF magnetron sputtering at room temperature. These films were flexible, transparent and had a good Hall mobility (5 - 12 cm 2 /Vs). High quality metal oxide Schottky contacts were fabricated on these as-grown IGZO/PEN films with on-off rectification ratios of up to 108. These were then used as the gate contacts in transparent metal semiconductor field effect transistors (MESFETs). The performance and device stability of these IGZO/PEN MESFETs were investigated via a series of stress tests in both dark conditions and under illumination at different wavelengths in the visible spectrum. During constant voltage stress testing under illumination, the threshold voltage shifted by - 0. 54 V and 0. 38 V for negative <b>and</b> <b>positive</b> <b>gate</b> biasing, respectively. These shifts proved reversible when devices were left in dark conditions for extended periods of time. The effect of persistent photoconductivity after exposure to different illumination sources was examined, with three potential passivation coatings to reduce this unwanted effect explored. Transparent IGZO/PEN MESFETs with an absolute transmission of up to 75 % were achieved with the use of ITO ohmic contacts. These devices survived mechanical bending down to a radius of 7 mm with negligible variation in on-current and threshold voltage.

40|$|YBa 2 Cu 3 O 7 -x (YBCO) superconducting {{thin films}} and heterostructures {{were made by}} laser {{deposition}} and electrical and microstructural properties were studied. Electric field effect devices were manufactured and investigated. YBCO films were deposited on several different substrates, such as MgO, yttriastabilized ZrO 2 (YSZ), SrTiO 3, LaAlO 3, and NdGaO 3, and were optimized with respect to critical temperature (T c), critical current (j c), and microwave surface resistance (R S). T c :s in excess of 90 K were measured for films on all substrates, and a j c of 5 x 10 6 A/cm 2 at 77 K and an R S of 85 µ. OMEGA. at 4. 2 K and 10 GHz were obtained on YSZ. A detailed study was performed on films on YSZ substrates. It {{was found that the}} crystallographic orientation relations between the film and the substrate depended strongly on the deposition temperature and the substrate morphology. It was concluded that steps in the substrate surface induced a graphoepitaxial alignment of the film. The steps also eliminated disorder in the films. The integration of YBCO in different heterostructures is essential for many applications. Heterostructures in the form of YBCO/insulator/YBCO trilayers were deposited and characterized. Single films of NdGaO 3 and PrGaO 3, and multilayers of SrTiO 3 and PrGaO 3, were used as insulators. The trilayers with single-film insulators occasionally showed high insulation, ~ 10 9. OMEGA. cm at 300 K for NdGaO 3, but often suffered from pinholes causing short circuits. An interaction layer was also observed between YBCO and PrGaO 3. These problems were overcome by introducing thin and equally spaced SrTiO 3 films in the PrGaO 3 and at the YBCO/PrGaO 3 interfaces. It was found that voids developed in the PrGaO 3 above a critical thickness of ~ 40 nm. The voids were eliminated by limiting the PrGaO 3 thickness, by means of the intermediate SrTiO 3 films. These SrTiO 3 /PrGaO 3 -insulator trilayers showed an insulation resistivity of 2 x 10 9. OMEGA:cm at 77 K for interface areas up to 1500 µm 2. Outgrowths commonly observed on the YBCO bottom layers did not affect the insulation, but were continuously covered by the SrTiO 3 /PrGaO 3. A T c of 88 K and a j c of ~ 10 6 A/cm 2 at 77 K were measured for the top YBCO layer. The electric field effect was investigated in polycrystalline YBCO films (~ 200 nm) deposited on amorphous buffer layers, and in ultrathin (~ 4. 5 nm) YBCO films deposited on Pr 1 Ba 2 Cu 3 O 7 -x templates. Pb(Zr,Ti) O 3 (500 nm) was used as gate insulator on the polycrystalline films and a 7 % increase of the normal resistance close to T c (86. 5 K) was observed at a gate voltage of + 1. 8 V. The ultrathin films had a T c of 50 K and a j c of 10 6 A/cm 2 at 4. 2 K. The gate insulator consisted of crystalline SrTiO 3 (80 nm) and amorphous SrTiO 3 (300 nm), and the gate area was ~ 800 µm 2. A maximum j c modulation of 2. 4 % was observed when gate voltages of Â± 80 V were applied. j c was modulated at temperatures between 13. 5 - 40 K, and was enhanced and depressed by negative <b>and</b> <b>positive</b> <b>gate</b> voltages respectively...|$|E
40|$|For {{the past}} decades, down-scaling of metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect-transistors (MOSFET) devices {{was the main}} driving force of {{enhancing}} the computational performance of electronic devices. Also, the decreasing overall power consumption in computations has become a pressing challenge on a global scale. However, during the last years, conventional down-scaling of the silicon-based MOSFET has reached its limitations. As a consequence, new materials besides Si are studied and alternative device principles for the MOSFET are being researched. One {{of the most promising}} candidates for replacing the MOSFET is the band-to-band tunneling field-effect transistor (TFET). TFETs are gated p-i-n diodes, which have the potential for exhibiting a steeper inverse subthreshold-slope S than the MOSFET, meaning faster switching and reduced power consumption. In this thesis, TFET devices based on silicon-germanium (SiGe) are presented. After the theoretical introduction into the working principle of the TFET the grand challenges are addressed, which have to be faced in building a MOSFET-competitive tunneling device, with the goal of obtaining a steep slope S and high on-currents I_on. Si_ 1 -xGe_x, with different Ge concentrations x, as a channel material and high-k oxides for gate dielectrics are discussed for improving the TFET performance. Experimental TFETs on compressively biaxially strained Si_ 1 -xGe_x with x= 0. 35, 0. 5 and 0. 65 show a distinctive switching behavior depending on the Ge concentration. TFET devices on Si_ 0. 5 Ge_ 0. 5 exhibit the best electrical performance, where the best values of slope and current that are observed amount to S= 162 mV/dec and I_on= 4 uA/um, respectively. However, these TFETs show an ambipolar behavior, due to their bipolar p-i-n architecture, meaning that the devices are switched on for both, negative <b>and</b> <b>positive</b> <b>gate</b> voltages. This makes the devices less suitable for logical switching. To solve this problem, Si_ 0. 5 Ge_ 0. 5 TFETs with asymmetrically doped source and drain are fabricated and analyzed. Depending on the doping concentration of the n and p sides, these devices show a unipolar behavior, but at expenses of on-current reduction. To obtain tunnel devices with optimal properties, hetero-structure TFETs with p-Si_ 0. 5 Ge_ 0. 5 source, iSi channel and nSi drain are introduced. The devices which feature an in-situ doped source exhibit an improved slope of up to S= 65 mV/dec. These SiGe/Si hetero-structures also were studied with different gate oxides and oxide thickness. The capacitance effective thickness (CET) heavily impacts the device performance: those devices with the smallest CET, featuring a thin HfO_ 2 dielectric (k= 22) show a greatly improved performance to those with thicker Al_ 2 O_ 3 dielectric (k= 9). To address the scalability of the TFETs, Si/SiGe hetero-structures are fabricated with different gate lengths of L_g= 100 and 200 nm (short channel, SC) and L_g= 600, 1000 and 1500 nm long channel, LC. These devices were also used to study the role of line and point tunneling within the TFET. LC devices show an increasing I_on for increasing L_g, due to an increased amount of line tunneling, while the amount of point tunneling stays constant. This is confirmed by device simulations. These simulations also show that devices show an improved slope, if the device is built such that the sub-threshold regime is dominated by line tunneling...|$|E

The microcrystalline silicon TFTs were prepared by plasma-enhanced {{chemical vapor deposition}} at temperatures compatible with flexible substrates.

40|$|Constant current stress induced leakage {{currents}} are studied in very thin oxide devices, for both stress polarities. This current {{has been investigated}} for both <b>positive</b> <b>and</b> negative <b>gate</b> voltage measurements. Stress induced leakage current (SILC) physical nature has been studied and an interpretation has been proposed, considering local oxide weak spots with barrier height close to 1 eV. The increasing rate of the SILC versus the injection dose has been studied and compared with the degradation positive charge build-up rate, observed in the same oxide, indicating that hole trapping and stress induced leakage current could have the same physical origin...|$|R
40|$|Electrical {{manipulation}} of lattice, charge, and spin has been realized respectively by the piezoelectric effect, field-effect transistor, and electric field control of ferromagnetism, bringing about dramatic promotions both in fundamental research and industrial production. However, {{it is generally}} accepted that the orbital of materials are impossible to be altered once they have been made. Here we use electric-field to dynamically tune the electronic phase transition in (La,Sr) MnO 3 films with different Mn^ 4 +/(Mn^ 3 + + Mn^ 4 +) ratios. The orbital occupancy and corresponding magnetic anisotropy of these thin films are manipulated by gate voltage in a reversible <b>and</b> quantitative manner. <b>Positive</b> <b>gate</b> voltage increases the proportion of occupancy of the orbital and magnetic anisotropy that were initially favored by strain (irrespective of tensile and compressive), while negative gate voltage reduces the concomitant preferential orbital occupancy and magnetic anisotropy. Besides its fundamental significance in orbital physics, our findings might advance the process towards practical oxide-electronics based on orbital. Comment: 19 pages, 4 figures. Accepted by Adv.

40|$|Abstract—In the {{proposed}} model, trap generation {{is assumed to}} be triggered by the collision of injected electrons with oxide atoms. The model suggests that thinner oxides are less susceptible to charging stress due to both lower probability of electron collision and lower electron impact energy. The difference in <b>positive</b> <b>and</b> negative <b>gate</b> bias chargeto-breakdown data is attributed to the formation of the structural transition layer at the Si/SiO 2 interface. The model is used for analysis of the effects of process induced charging damage on transistor parameters. It is found that after heavy stress, leakage current is determined by the probability of trap assisted tunneling, while the density of generated traps controls leakage in lightly damaged oxides...|$|R
40|$|We report {{instability}} {{behavior of}} oxide-based top-gate thin-film transistors under electrical and optical stresses. For electrical stress, transfer curve shifts {{to the right}} <b>and</b> left for <b>positive</b> <b>and</b> negative <b>gate</b> stress voltages, respectively, while sub-threshold slope (SS) barely changed for both cases. Although this behavior {{is consistent with the}} previously reported oxide-based TFT instability behavior explained by charge trapping mechanism, threshold voltage shift seemed to have power-law-time dependency unlike the previous results. We also tested optical stress behavior of the oxide-based TFTs with a blue power-LED. Under prolonged exposure of 3. 5 mW/cm 2 blue light, both transfer curves under dark and illumination conditions shift to the left, but with significant change in sub-threshold slope for illumination condition. After the electrical and optical stress tests, stress effect was relaxed without any annealing process...|$|R
