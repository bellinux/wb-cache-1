5|$|Confessions on a Dance Floor is {{the tenth}} studio album by American singer and {{songwriter}} Madonna. It {{was released on}} November 9, 2005 by Warner Bros. Records. A complete departure from her previous studio album <b>American</b> <b>Life</b> (2003), the album includes influences of 1970s and 1980s disco, as well as modern-day club music. Initially, she began working with Mirwais Ahmadzaï for the album, but later felt that their collaboration was not going in the direction she desired. Madonna took her collaboration with Stuart Price who was overviewing her documentary I'm Going to Tell You a Secret. The album was mainly recorded at Price's home-studio where Madonna {{spent most of her}} time during the recordings.|$|E

Elvis has emerged as a great artist, a great rocker, a great purveyor of schlock, a great heart throb, a great bore, a great symbol of potency, a great ham, a great nice person, and, yes, a great American.|$|E
5|$|From 1916 {{through his}} John F. Kennedy {{memorial}} cover on December 16, 1963, Rockwell created 321 magazine covers for the Post, {{which was the}} most popular American magazine {{of the first half of}} the 20th century with a subscribership that reached a peak of 4 million. Rockwell illustrated <b>American</b> <b>life</b> during World War I and World War II in 34 of his cover illustrations, and he illustrated 33 Post covers in total during World War II. Some of the war art involved <b>American</b> <b>life.</b> During much of the first half of the 1940s, Rockwell's cover illustrations focused on the human side of the war. Rockwell encouraged support of the war efforts during World War II by means of his covers that endorsed war bonds, encouraged women to work, and encouraged men to enlist in the service. His World War II illustrations used themes of patriotism, longing, shifting gender roles, reunion, love, work, community and family during wartime to promote the war. In his role as a magazine illustrator during times of war, Rockwell draws comparisons to Winslow Homer, an American Civil War illustrator for Harper's Weekly. Rockwell's artistic expressions were said to have helped the adoption of the goal of the Four Freedoms as set forth by United States President Franklin Roosevelt's 1941 State of the Union Address. His painting series, the Four Freedoms, toured in a war bond effort that raised $132 million.|$|E

The book presented three main characters, each representing different aspects of <b>American</b> <b>life</b> and using authentic American dialects in their dialogue.
