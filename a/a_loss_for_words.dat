[...] Entering into the cave, Moses and Aaron see a bed, a set table, and candelabra and a ministering angel. [...] Aaron now inquires what message Moses has from God, and indicates that even if it be about his own death, that he will accept it gratefully. [...] Aaron having broached the subject, Moses now takes the opportunity to inform him that it is indeed the notice of Aaron's death which is the message God means for Moses to convey. [...] Not alarmed at the content of the message, Aaron is nevertheless perturbed that Moses did not tell him of his death in a more forthright manner. [...] However, Moses explains how Aaron's death will be more desirable than his own death, for Aaron is to be buried by his brother, and his honor was to be inherited by his children; dignities which will be denied to Moses himself.

40|$|This {{study of}} the works of Swiss poet Philippe Jaccottet (born in 1925) {{provides}} a broad overview of his writing, from his first published poems in the early 1940 s to his most recent volume of prose in 2015, and illustrates the various ways in which it emblematizes what could be called a poetics of dilation. My first chapter considers the influence on Jaccottet of the German poet Novalis, who {{at the turn of the}} 19 th century had envisioned what he called die erweiterte Poësie (“expanded poetry”); via Jean-Christophe Bailly’s recent reflections on la poësie élargie (an adjective that can mean both “expanded” and “liberated”), I in turn derive the notion of dilated poetry, the polysemy of which term is especially suggestive where Jaccottet is concerned. On a formal level, past and present English definitions of dilation account both for the expansion of Jaccottet’s early poème-discours and the dispersal of the later poè`mes-instants as well as of the fragments gathered in the notebooks of La semaison. The second and third chapters further probe poetic experience: the former reexamines Jaccottet’s relationship to images and visibility (the dilation of the poem’s eye), while the latter explores the multivalent motif of blood that runs throughout his writing (the dilation of the poem’s veins). I set out to show that the poet’s encounter with the world is lived first of all as an interdiction, <b>a</b> temporary <b>loss</b> <b>for</b> <b>words</b> before the seemingly inexpressible, and is then brought into language as an entrediction that traces a path between silence and eloquence, music and speech, poet and reader...|$|R
40|$|Acoustic word embeddings [...] - fixed-dimensional vector {{representations}} of variable-length spoken word segments [...] - {{have begun to}} be considered for tasks such as speech recognition and query-by-example search. Such embeddings can be learned discriminatively so that they are similar for speech segments corresponding to the same word, while being dissimilar for segments corresponding to different words. Recent work has found that acoustic word embeddings can outperform dynamic time warping on query-by-example search and related word discrimination tasks. However, the space of embedding models and training approaches is still relatively unexplored. In this paper we present new discriminative embedding models based on recurrent neural networks (RNNs). We consider training losses that have been successful in prior work, in particular <b>a</b> cross entropy <b>loss</b> <b>for</b> <b>word</b> classification and <b>a</b> contrastive <b>loss</b> that explicitly aims to separate same-word and different-word pairs in a "Siamese network" training setting. We find that both classifier-based and Siamese RNN embeddings improve over previously reported results on a word discrimination task, with Siamese RNNs outperforming classification models. In addition, we present analyses of the learned embeddings and the effects of variables such as dimensionality and network structure. Comment: To appear at SLT 201...|$|R
