40|$|Sets of {{adsorption}} isotherms of argon and krypton on the cleavage {{face of a}} number of lamellar halides have been determined. For each <b>adsorbate-adsorbent</b> <b>pair</b> a specific number of adlayers are formed during two-dimensional condensations, which are first order transitions. Particular {{attention has been paid to}} the entropy associated with these transitions. The number of adlayers that can form has been shown to depend essentially on the dimensional incompatibility between adsorbate and adsorbent...|$|E
40|$|Vapour {{adsorption}} refrigeration systems (VAdS) {{have the}} advantage of scalability over a wide range of capacities ranging from a few watts to several kilowatts. In the first instance, the design of a system requires the characteristics of the <b>adsorbate-adsorbent</b> <b>pair.</b> Invariably, the void volume in the adsorbent reduces the throughput of the thermal compressor {{in a manner similar to}} the clearance volume in a reciprocating compressor. This paper presents a study of the activated carbon +HFC- 134 a (1, 1, 1, 2 -tetrafluoroethane) system as a possible pair for a typical refrigeration application. The aim of this study is to unfold the nexus between the adsorption parameters, achievable packing densities of charcoal and throughput of a thermal compressor. It is shown that for a thermal compressor, the adsorbent should not only have a high surface area, but should also be able to provide a high packing density. Given the adsorption characteristics of an adsorbent-adsorbate pair and the operating conditions, this paper discloses a method for the calculation of the minimum packing density necessary for an effective throughput of a thermal compressor.

40|$|B. Malengier, E. Trojaková We {{consider}} a convection-diffusion-adsorption-reaction system in 1 D, which models contaminant transport in groundwater. Mathematical model is numeri-cally solved by {{the method of}} line (MOL) using the space discretization with the moving grid points. The method is suitable to capture the sharp fronts of the solution which can arize by an strong adsorption. The large scale of isotherms {{are included in the}} adsorption model for both equilibrium and nonequilibrium modes. Also the numerical approximation by operator splitting method is ap-plied when adsorption process is splitted with the convection-diffusion along the short time intervals and the fixed space grid points. The numerical efficiency of all methods is discussed and obtained numerical results are compared. The presented methods are suitable for the solution of inverse problems in scaling of the mathematical model for its practical implementations. The contaminant transport in porous media is modelled (see [5, 2],etc.) by system of PDE’s in the following form: θ∂tC + ρ∂tψe(C) + θv∇C −∇(θD∇C) + ρ∂tS = 0 ∂tS = κ(ψn(C) − S) (1) eq 1. 1 where C is the contaminant concentration, θ, ρ are porosity and specific density of the porous media, v is the water flow in which contaminant is soluted, and ψe, ψn are adsorption isotherms in the equilibrium and nonequilibrium mode, respectively. The matrix D represents the dispersion. System (1) can be com-pleted by an initial and boundary conditions which will be specified below. The adsorption phenomenon is characterized by adsorption isotherm- a function that relates the amount of adsorbed material to its amount in the water when the equilibrium state is reached. Different <b>adsorbate-adsorbent</b> <b>pairs</b> can have different isotherms. The most common isotherms (ψe, ψn) used in practice are: Linear isotherm- ψ(C) = aC Freundlich isotherm- ψ(C) = aCp Langmuir isotherm- ψ(C) = aC 1 +bC Mixed F-L isotherm- ψ(C) = a...|$|R
