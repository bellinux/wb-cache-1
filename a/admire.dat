5|$|At Rome {{indeed the}} works of art are legion; besides, one effaces another from the memory and, however {{beautiful}} they may be, we are distracted by the overpowering claims of duty and business; for to <b>admire</b> art we need leisure and profound stillness (XXXVI:26–72).|$|E

Receiving praise for doing well at these events led Goebbels to shape his political ideas to match Hitler's, and to <b>admire</b> and idolize him even more.|$|E
60|$|She <b>admired</b> the car, she <b>admired</b> {{the colour}} {{of the car}}, she <b>admired</b> the lamps {{of the car and}} the door of the car and the little {{fittings}} of the car. She <b>admired</b> the horn. She <b>admired</b> the twist of the horn. She <b>admired</b> Clarence and the uniform of Clarence and she <b>admired</b> and coveted the great fur coat that he held ready for his employer. (But if she had it, she said, she would wear the splendid fur outside to show every little bit of it.) And when the car at last moved forward and tooted--she <b>admired</b> the note--and vanished softly and swiftly through the gates, she was left in the porch with Mr. Brumley still by sheer inertia <b>admiring</b> and envying. She <b>admired</b> Sir Isaac's car number Z 900. (Such an easy one to remember!) Then she stopped abruptly, as one might discover that the water in the bathroom was running to waste and turn it off.|$|R

5|$|Custine {{began his}} career {{at the age of}} eight, in 1748, {{at the end of the}} War of Austrian Succession in Germany under Marshal Saxe, who {{continued}} his tutelage during peace time. During the Seven Years' War (175663), Custine served in the French army in the German states; in 1758, he was a captain of dragoons in the Schomberg regiment. While fighting the Prussians, Custine learned to <b>admire</b> their modern military organization, which later influenced his own military style.|$|E
5|$|George V disliked {{sitting for}} {{portrait}}s and despised modern art; {{he was so}} displeased by one portrait by Charles Sims that he ordered it to be burned.

5|$|Linnaeus' {{last years}} were troubled by illness. He had {{suffered}} from a disease called the Uppsala fever in 1764, but survived thanks {{to the care of}} Rosén. He developed sciatica in 1773, and the next year, he had a stroke which partially paralysed him. He suffered a second stroke in 1776, losing the use of his right side and leaving him bereft of his memory; while still able to <b>admire</b> his own writings, he could not recognise himself as their author.|$|E
5|$|Northeast of Emporia, the Emporia {{service area}} {{is located in}} the median at mile 132. The turnpike {{continues}} northeast through the northern reaches of the Flint Hills, coming to an interchange with US-56 near <b>Admire.</b> This interchange, Exit 147, is the only interchange along the I-335 section of the turnpike other than the two end junctions. It is a trumpet connection to US-56, which heads west to Council Grove and east to Osage City, {{and was one of the}} original 1956 interchanges.|$|E
5|$|Returning to Tennessee {{after his}} presidency, Johnson sought {{political}} vindication, and gained {{it in his}} eyes {{when he was elected}} to the Senate again in 1875, making Johnson the only former president to serve in the Senate. He died just months into his term. While some <b>admire</b> Johnson's strict constitutionalism, his strong opposition to federally guaranteed rights for African Americans is widely criticized. He is regarded by many historians as one of the worst presidents in American history.|$|E

5|$|Bach {{composed}} the cantata {{in his fourth}} year as Thomaskantor (musical director) in Leipzig. The text {{is based on the}} day's prescribed reading from the Gospel of Mark, the healing of a deaf mute man. The librettist is Georg Christian Lehms, whose poetry Bach had used already in Weimar as the basis for solo cantatas. The text quotes ideas from the gospel and derives from these the analogy that as the tongue of the deaf mute man was opened, the believer should be open to <b>admire</b> God's miraculous deeds. The cantatas for this Sunday have a positive character, which Bach stressed in earlier works for the occasion by including trumpets in the score. In this work, he uses instead an obbligato solo organ in several movements.|$|E

5|$|Critics who <b>admire</b> {{his middle}} work might {{characterize}} it as supple and muscular in its rhythms and sometimes harshly modernist, while others find these poems barren and weak in imaginative power. Yeats's later work found new imaginative inspiration in the mystical system {{he began to}} work out for himself {{under the influence of}} spiritualism. In many ways, this poetry is a return to the vision of his earlier work. The opposition between the worldly minded man of the sword and the spiritually minded man of God, the theme of The Wanderings of Oisin, is reproduced in A Dialogue Between Self and Soul.|$|E
5|$|Finally, {{there is}} no attempt by the artist to soften the subject's {{brutality}} through technical skill. Method and subject are indivisible. Goya's procedure is determined less by the mandates of traditional virtuosity than by his intrinsically morbid theme. The brushwork could not be described as pleasing, and the colors are restricted to earth tones and black, punctuated by bright flashes of white and the red blood of the victims. The quality of the pigment itself foreshadows Goya's later works: a granular solution producing a matte, sandy finish. Few would <b>admire</b> the work for painterly flourishes, such is its horrific force and its lack of theatricality.|$|E
5|$|From the <b>Admire</b> exit, the Kansas Turnpike {{continues}} northeast, {{passing through}} {{the southeast corner of}} Wabaunsee County and the northwestern part of Osage County. The turnpike enters Shawnee County and continues through rural land before it heads into the Topeka area. Here, the roadway has an interchange that serves I-470 and US-75. At this point, I-335 ends and I-470 joins the turnpike as it passes through suburban development in the southeastern part of Topeka. In the eastern portion of the city, the highway reaches an interchange with I-70, US-40, and K-4.|$|E

After his father's death, the nine-year-old Sherman was raised by a Lancaster neighbor and family friend, attorney Thomas Ewing, Sr., a prominent member of the Whig Party who served as senator from Ohio and as the first Secretary of the Interior. Sherman was distantly related to American founding father Roger Sherman and grew to <b>admire</b> him.|$|E
