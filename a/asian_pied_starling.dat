40|$|Aim: Salmonellosis {{is one of}} {{the most}} common {{zoonotic}} diseases, and the presence of antimicrobial resistant Salmonella in wild birds is global public health threat. Throughout the last decades, multidrug resistance of Salmonella spp. has increased, particularly in developing countries. Therefore, a cross-sectional study was conducted to investigate the prevalence of Salmonella spp. and antimicrobial resistance pattern against Salmonella spp. from two species of resident wild birds namely house crow (Corvus splendens) and <b>Asian</b> <b>pied</b> <b>starling</b> (Gracupica contra). Materials and Methods: Samples were collected from cloacal swabs of house crows and <b>Asian</b> <b>pied</b> <b>starling</b> for isolating Salmonella spp. (bacteriological culture methods) followed by antimicrobial susceptibility testing (disk diffusion method) against Salmonella spp. isolates during March to December 2014. Results: The prevalence of Salmonella in <b>Asian</b> <b>pied</b> <b>starling</b> and house crows were 67...|$|E
40|$|A {{serological}} and {{virological surveillance}} program {{to investigate the}} HPAI H 5 N 1 virus in wild bird populations was undertaken from February 2007 to October 2008. The purpose of the survey {{was to investigate the}} infection status in free ranging wild birds in Banglane district, Nakhon Pathom province, central Thailand. Samples from wild birds were collected every two months. Choanal and cloacal swabs, serum and tissue samples were collected from 421 birds comprising 44 species. Sero-prevalence of the virus tested by H 5 N 1 serum neutralization test (using a H 5 N 1 virus clade 1; A/chicken/Thailand/vsmu- 3 -BKK/ 2004) was 2. 1 % (8 out of 385 samples; 95 % CI 0. 7, 3. 5). Species that were antibody positive included rock pigeons (Columba livia), <b>Asian</b> <b>pied</b> <b>starling</b> (Gracupica contra), spotted dove (Streptopelia chinensis), oriental magpie robin (Copsychus saularis), blue-tailed bee-eater (Merops philippinus), myna (Acridotheres spp.), and pond heron (Ardeola spp.). Prevalence by H 5 N 1 virus isolation was 0. 5 % (2 out of 421 samples; 95 % CI 0. 0, 1. 1); the two H 5 N 1 virus-positive samples were from <b>Asian</b> <b>pied</b> <b>starling</b> (Gracupica contra) and white vented myna (Acridotheres grandis). Positive virological samples were collected in June 2007 while all positive serology samples were collected between May and August except for one sample collected in December 2007. No positive samples were collected in 2008. Molecular studies revealed that the wild bird H 5 N 1 viruses were closely related to poultry viruses isolated in other parts of Thailand. However, there was no poultry H 5 N 1 prevalence study performed in the study site during the time of this wild bird survey. Interpretation of source of virus isolates would include spill-over of H 5 N 1 viruses from contaminated sources due to movement of domestic poultry and/or fomites from other areas; or infection of wild birds within the outbreak locations and then translocation by wild bird movement and interaction with wild birds inhabiting distant locations. © 2010 Elsevier B.

50|$|The <b>pied</b> <b>starling</b> has {{sometimes}} {{been seen as a}} pest when it takes soft fruit such as grapes or figs, and was also itself considered good eating. However, it is little persecuted at present.|$|R
50|$|The <b>pied</b> <b>starling</b> is gregarious {{and when}} not {{breeding}} will form large flocks, sometimes numbering more than 1000 birds. Its roosts may {{be shared by}} lesser kestrels or wattled starlings. It will feed with European starlings, but they rarely roost together.|$|R
50|$|Like other <b>starlings,</b> the <b>pied</b> <b>starling</b> is an omnivore, {{taking a}} wide range of invertebrates, seeds and berries, but its diet is mainly insects, {{including}} many ants and termites. It will take figs from gardens and some human food discards. Foraging is frequently near livestock, with birds feeding on insects disturbed by the animals and also perching on cattle or sheep to remove ectoparasites.|$|R
40|$|The {{interaction}} between brood parasitic cuckoos and their hosts represents a traditional example of coevolution, whereby obligate interspecific brood parasitic cuckoos completely {{rely on their}} hosts to do their parental care for them by laying their eggs in the host’s nest. This thesis brings together {{a great deal of}} information documenting and clarifying the interactions between different species of hosts and their respective parasitic cuckoos in Bangladesh. I recorded parasitism rates to determine the extent of brood parasitism and to identify the host species that were parasitised by sympatric cuckoos. Four parasitic cuckoos were documented: the Asian koel (Eudynamys scolopacea), the common hawk cuckoo (Cuculus varius; previously known as Hierococcyx varius), the pied cuckoo (Clamator jacobinus) and the Indian cuckoo (Cuculus micropterus). These cuckoos were sympatric and parasitised different host species, including the house crow (Corvus splendens), the long-tailed shrike (Lanius schach), the common myna (Acridotheres tristis), the jungle babbler (Turdoides striatus) and the black drongo (Dicrurus macrocercus). All of these cuckoo species are obligate brood parasites. The Asian koel utilised the following three hosts: the house crow, the common myna and the long-tailed shrike. The latter was recorded for the first time as a host for the Asian koel in Bangladesh. We found that koel eggs were highly non-mimetic to those of common myna and long-tailed shrike, but showed good mimicry to house crow eggs. Indian cuckoos showed excellent egg mimicry with the eggs of their black drongo hosts, as did common hawk cuckoos and pied cuckoos with their jungle babbler host. The hosts accepted the eggs of all four cuckoo species. However, the common myna was more likely to abandon nests parasitised by the koel than unparasitised ones. All of the host species suffered the costs of koel parasitism, showing reduced breeding success. Proximity to fruit trees was an important predictor of the probability of parasitism in the three koel host species studied. There was a significant positive relationship between nest volume and probability of parasitism by Asian koels. Furthermore, the colonial breeding house crows suffered comparatively less parasitism than the other two koel host species. Long-tailed shrike nests close to conspecific neighbours were less likely to be parasitised, and the risk of parasitism was increased in nests lower to the ground. The risk of parasitism increased during the breeding season for house crows and common mynas. All three Asian koel hosts tolerated multiple parasitism. We investigated whether there was any interspecific competition among the sympatric cuckoos. In theory, sympatric parasites should show niche segregation through variation in host use. As predicted, each cuckoo species parasitised different host species; however, host use overlapped in common hawk cuckoos and pied cuckoos, but interspecific competition was reduced because these two cuckoo species have different breeding seasons. Furthermore, there was a significant difference in parasitism rate among the three main habitats: human habitations, mixed scrub forests and monoculture plantations. This indicated that different cuckoos favour specific habitats, even if their favourite host also occurs elsewhere. Finally, I tested responses against foreign eggs by the cuckoo hosts as well as by potential cuckoo hosts in the study area. For this purpose, I used differently sized and coloured model eggs. Common mynas and jungle babblers accepted all non-mimetic eggs, as did most of the house crows (91 %). Long-tailed shrikes rejected 75 % of the non-mimetic model eggs. Finally, black drongos turned out to be strong rejectors and could do so without damaging any of their own eggs, most likely because they grasped and ejected the non-mimetic model egg. This result indicates that the black drongo has been in a coevolutionary arms race with the Indian cuckoo since drongos accepted mimetic cuckoo eggs. Species such as the Oriental magpie robin (Copsychus saularis), red-vented bulbul (Pycnonotus cafer) and <b>Asian</b> <b>pied</b> <b>starling</b> (Gracupica contra), which likely have no history of interaction with cuckoos, accepted 100 % of the non-mimetic model eggs. In conclusion, our findings describe host nest use cues used by the Asian koel, which may provide background for further studies in other sympatric brood parasites. In spite of the high degree of acceptance of parasitic eggs, the breeding success of both cuckoos and hosts should be more closely studied to obtain a better understanding of the costs of parasitism. Future experimental studies are highly recommended to achieve a better understanding of host responses to Asian cuckoo species. PhD i biologiPhD in Biolog...|$|E
50|$|The Cape {{starling}} is a {{gregarious bird}} and forms large flocks in the non-breeding season. It usually feeds {{on the ground}} often foraging alongside other species of starlings such as the <b>pied</b> <b>starling,</b> the common starling, the greater blue-eared starling, the lesser blue-eared starling, the wattled starling and Burchell's starling. It is habituated to humans and its diet includes fruit, insects and nectar. It sometimes feeds on ectoparasites that it picks off the backs of animals and it sometimes visits bird tables for scraps.|$|R
50|$|The <b>pied</b> <b>starling</b> usually nests in tunnels in river banks, {{but will}} use holes in buildings, straw bales or natural tree holes. There {{is a record}} of a nest being {{constructed}} in a wrecked ship 200 m from the shore. The nest is lined {{with a wide variety}} of plant material and items of human waste such as paper and rope. The female typically lays four eggs, though clutches of two to six are known. The eggs are blue-green, immaculate or with some red spots.|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 1990 Patterns of {{resource}} partitioning among 4 sympatric sturnids: [black-collared <b>starling</b> (Sturnus nigricollis), <b>pied</b> <b>starling</b> (S. contra), common myna (Acridotheres tristis) and crested myna (A. javanicus) were determined {{based on their}} food habits, foraging and nesting microhabitat selection, morphology and behavior. The study was conducted from March 1986 to June 1988 at and around Bang Pra Game Sanctuary, Cholburi, Thailand. Diets of adults and nestlings of all species were significantly different. The 4 species exhibited significant differences in morphology, primarily in trophic (bill shape and length) and locomotive (wing shape and size) appendages that affect selection of foraging microhabitat and hence choice of diets. Selection of nest site characteristics was significantly different among the species and was associated with types of tree i. e., palm vs non-palm (trees with forks or branches), distance of nest tree from human habitation and distance of nest tree from seasonal or permanent waters. The <b>pied</b> <b>starling,</b> common myna and crested myna all selected different foraging habitats and used different techniques for foraging,-however the black-collared starling shared foraging habitat with the other 3 species. Breeding success, breeding chronology, and clutch sizes were similar for the 4 species. These 4 sympatric sturnids partitioned their resources through differences in morphology, which, in turn, affected their foraging habitat selection and modes of foraging, and hence, differences in diet. Behavioral differences also segregated their foraging techniques and nest site selection...|$|R
