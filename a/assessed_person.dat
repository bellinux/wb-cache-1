40|$|Mental {{capacity}} and autonomy are often {{understood to be}} normatively neutral - the only values or other norms they may presuppose are those the <b>assessed</b> <b>person</b> does or would accept. We show how mental disorder threatens normatively neutral accounts of autonomy. These accounts produce false positives, {{particularly in the case}} of disorders (such as depression, anorexia nervosa and schizophrenia) that affect evaluative abilities. Two normatively neutral strategies for handling autonomy-undermining disorder are explored and rejected: a blanket exclusion of mental disorder, and functional tests requiring consistency, expression of identity, reflective non-alienation or lack of compulsion. Finally, we suggest ways in which substantivist alternatives to neutrality can be made more promising through increased transparency, democratic contestability of conditions for {{capacity and}} autonomy, and a historically sensitive caution concerning restrictions of liberty.

40|$|The {{assessment}} of professional performance {{is a delicate}} problem in the organization management. When it comes to training, payment or promotion, all these operations only take place following an assessment. The purpose of the assessment is to assist in making decisions that affect individuals, which decisions should have an objective and fair basis. The need for this activity is dictated by: the expression and sizing of the objectives, setting deviations from the objectives and making the necessary corrections, determining the directions and methods for the refresher training of the staff, decreasing the risks r caused by retaining and promoting incompetent persons, a better assignment of the employees on positions, fair salaries, increasing the competitive capacity of the organization. All these are explicit functions of the performance assessment, {{but there are also}} implicit reasons. Assessment is an activity through which employees are motivated, personal contacts are maintained, high-quality work is recognised, and a certain image of the assessed employee is promoted. [2] Knowing then performance achieved involves an understanding of how tasks are fulfilled, the yield at the workplace. Knowing performance offers the <b>assessed</b> <b>person</b> self-confidence, and is also a mobilizing factor that generates a positive attitude towards work...|$|E
40|$|Modern {{conception}} of social care is adjusted by Act No. 108 / 2006 Col., on social services. It includes {{a description of}} conditions of providing assistance and support to individuals in adverse social situation through social services, particularly by a new benefit ? care benefit. This is used {{by people who are}} limited by their health condition in normal life. The new conception philosophy is {{based on the fact that}} people using the care benefit, dependent on assistance of other individuals are completely free to decide who and how will provide them with the assistance. Its subsequent use has to lead people to activity, support of development of their independence and motivation, to prevent worsening of their adverse social situation. The purpose of the care benefit is to keep the ill person alive as long as possible and to live with dignity in his/her natural environment. The care is provided either by close persons (family) or by social service providers from government or non-government organizations. The aim of the thesis was to map the criteria in the field of the method of dependence assessment for granting care benefit to seniors over 65 years of age in České Budějovice district, who were assessed in 2012 in so-called transitive period according to both the regulations. The theoretical part defines the terms senior, aging process and informs on social factors leading to human life extension. It describes development of social work in the Czech Republic and establishment of the Social Service Act effective from 1 January 2007, the main idea of which was modification of the role of the state as the social care provider, and active involvement of a citizen as the benefit receiver. The next part of the thesis describes criteria of care benefit granting according to the original regulations valid from 1 / 1 / 2007. It is granted in four levels corresponding to different amounts with regards to age and number of acts (36 evaluated). Ability to cope with individual acts of care about oneself and self-sufficiency are evaluated in assessment of dependence degree for the care benefit purposes. The Social Service Act has been amended several times; a substantial change of the criteria for granting the benefit came on 1 / 1 / 2012, when Act No. 366 / 2011 Col., modifying certain provisions of the Social Service Act, became effective. In the new assessment of dependence degree the ability of a person to cope with 10 basic life needs is evaluated. Two hypotheses were tested in the practical part of the thesis upon the set goals: 1. Higher dependence degree is recognized in assessment of dependence degree in seniors according to the new criteria. 2. Lower number of evaluated acts in assessment of dependence degree corresponds with objectivization of health condition of the <b>assessed</b> <b>person.</b> The research was performed by means of quantitative method, namely data content analysis and the obtained data were statistically processed by categorical data analysis, Pearson?s correlation coefficient and contingency tables. Data from the statistics of the Czech Social Security Administration, its local workplaces and accessible materials of the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs of the CR in 2007 and 2012 were used for the research. After analysis and evaluation of the necessary information we found that the first hypothesis was not confirmed; higher degree is not recognized in assessment of dependence degree in seniors. The second hypothesis was confirmed, the lower number of assessed acts correspond with objectivization of health condition. In the conclusion we observe that the new criteria for assessment of dependence degree for the purpose of granting the care benefit do not lead to recognition of higher dependence degree...|$|E

40|$|Este trabalho investigou as propriedades psicométricas e adaptação para o Brasil do “Negative acts Questionnaire Revised” (NAQ-R). O NAQ-R é um instrumento criado na Noruega por Einarsen, Raknes, Mattiesen e Hellesay para avaliar assédio moral no trabalho. Um questionário composto por 22 itens, cada um escrito em forma de comportamento, sem referência ao termo “assédio”. A escala mede quantas vezes o entrevistado, durante os últimos 6 meses foi submetido a uma série de atos negativos e comportamentos potencialmente ofensivos. Também apresenta uma definição de assédio moral e a partir disso a pessoa refere sua autopercepção de ter sido ou não vítima de assédio moral no trabalho. O assédio moral configura como uma forma de relação agressiva no trabalho, em que há a ação {{prejudicial}} do agressor sobre a vítima. Entender esse fenômeno, bem como as formas de avaliar o assédio moral foram o motivador deste trabalho. A presente pesquisa está estruturada em duas partes: a seção I apresenta a revisão sistemática sobre o instrumento NAQ e a seção II versa sobre o estudo de adaptação e evidência de validade e fidedignidade do NAQR para o Brasil. A revisão sistemática finalizou com 23 artigos. Vinte encontrados nas bases de dados eletrônicas (PsycInfo, Web of Science, Scielo, Google Acadêmico – “Negative Acts Questionnaire” + Scielo (PDF), Google Acadêmico – “Negative Acts Questionnaire” + Redalyc) e 3 enviados por meio eletrônico por um dos autores. O objetivo do estudo empírico foi apresentar algumas das principais etapas de adaptação para o português (Brasil) do Negative Acts Questionnaire Revised (NAQ-R). Para tanto, realizou-se as fases de tradução, retro tradução e avaliação “por painel de experts” e aplicação piloto do instrumento em um grupo para adequá-lo a língua e posteriormente proceder à aplicação em uma amostra da população. A amostra foi composta por 327 sujeitos de escolas com EJA e universitários da PUCRS, trabalhadores de vários setores, diferentes cargos e vínculos com as empresas. As idades são compreendidas entre 16 e 65 anos, sendo a média de 26 anos. Quanto ao sexo, 46, 6 % são do sexo feminino e 53, 4 % do sexo masculino. O NAQ-R mostrou alta fidedignidade (Alpha de Cronbach = 0, 93). A análise fatorial obteve 4 fatores: assédio relacionado ao trabalho, assédio pessoal, desqualificação pessoal e profissional, intimidação física. The {{purpose of}} the present study was to examine the factor structure and psychometric properties of the Revised Negative Acts Questionnaire" (NAQ-R) a tool developed in Norway by Einarsen, Raknes, Mattiesen Hellesay, and applied to a sample of Brazilian students and workers. The NAQ-R was built to assess workplace bullying. It consist of a questionnaire comprising 22 items, each one written in a form of behavior, without reference to the term "harassment". The scale measures how often the <b>assessed</b> <b>person</b> during the last 6 months underwent a series of negative actions and behaviors that are potentially offensive. It also presents a definition of bullying that the person feels as been or not the victim of bullying at work. Bullying configured as an aggressive form of relationship at work, where there is a harmful action of the aggressor on the victim. This work was motivated to better understand this phenomenon and find reliable ways to assess bullying at work. This research is structured in two parts: Section I presents a systematic review of the instrument and NAQ section II deals with the study of adaptation the NAQ-R to the Brazilian Portuguese. The systematic review found 23 articles. Twenty were found in the electronic databases (PsycInfo, Web of Science, SciELO, Google Scholar - "Negative Acts Questionnaire" + Scielo (PDF), Google Scholar - "Negative Acts Questionnaire" Redalyc +) and tree were sent by one of the authors. The aim of the empirical study was to present some of the main steps of adaptation into Portuguese (Brazil) of the Negative Acts Questionnaire Revised (NAQ-R). To this end, we carried out the phases of translation, back translation and evaluation "by the panel of experts" as well as the initial instrument application in a group to fit the language. and then proceed to the application in all sample. The final sample consisted of 327 subjects from high school and students of a University, workers from various sectors, various offices and links with business. The ages were between 16 and 65 years, the average being 26 years. Regarding gender 46. 6 % are female and 53. 4 % were male. The NAQ-R showed high reliability (Cronbach's alpha = 0. 93). The Factor analysis obtained four factors: work-related harassment, personal harassment, personal and professional disqualification, physical intimidation.

In this article, the lz statistic and the 2 statistic, both of which have been used for tests with only dichotomous items or with only polytomous items, were modified for use with mixed-format tests. In a detailed simulation, the lz and 2 statistics are found to be conservative under a (fre-quentist) asymptotic normal approximation.

Four person-fit measures were studied in order-restricted latent class models (OR-LCMs). To decide whether the OR-LCM fits an item score vector, a Bayesian framework was adopted and posterior predictive checks were used. First, simulated Type I error rates and detection rates were investigated for the four person-fit measures under varying test and item characteristics. Second, the suitability of the OR-LCM methodology in a nonparametric IRT context was investigated. The result was Type I error rates close to the nominal Type I error rates and detection rates close to the detection rates found in OR-LCMs. This means that the OR-LCM methodology is a suitable alternative for <b>assessing</b> <b>person</b> fit in nonparametric IRT models...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: The National Service Framework for {{coronary}} heart disease requires primary care teams to identify patients who {{are at high risk}} of cardiovascular events and treat those with high blood pressure. However, there are no data on how many must be assessed, how much cardiovascular disease can be prevented or which patients are most likely to benefit. AIM: To estimate the potential number of patients who are eligible for blood pressure assessment, the number of preventable cardiovascular disease events and the relative efficiency of the strategy in different age groups. DESIGN OF STUDY: Modelling exercise. SETTING: Hypothetical population of 100, 000. METHOD: The age-sex specific prevalence of cardiovascular risk factors and of current anti-hypertensive treatment were obtained from published sources and combined with published estimates of the effectiveness of anti-hypertensive treatment. From these data were calculated numbers of persons eligible for assessment and treatment, and numbers of preventable cardiovascular events. RESULTS: There were 79, 607 persons eligible for assessment and 5888 eligible for treatment. Treatment could prevent between 101 and 139 cardiovascular events annually. There were 11, 571 persons aged over 65 years and eligible for assessment and 4655 eligible for treatment. Treatment could prevent 85 to 117 cardiovascular events annually. No cardiovascular events are prevented in persons aged under 45 years. CONCLUSION: Confining assessment to the 16 % who are aged over 65 years prevents 85 % of the population's avoidable cardiovascular disease.
