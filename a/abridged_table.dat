40|$|AbstractThe atomistically-detailed {{molecular}} modelling of petroleum fluids is challenging, amongst other aspects, {{due to the}} very diverse multicomponent and asymmetric nature of the mixtures in question. Complicating matters further, the time scales for many important processes can be {{much larger than the}} current and foreseeable capacity of modern computers running fully-atomistic models. To overcome these limitations, a coarse grained (CG) model is proposed where some of the less-important degrees of freedom are safely integrated out, leaving as key parameters the average energy levels, the molecular conformations and the range of the Mie intermolecular potentials employed as the basis of the model. The parametrization is performed by using an analytical equation of state of the statistical associating fluid theory (SAFT) family to link the potential parameters to macroscopically observed thermophysical properties. The parameters found through this top-down approach are used directly in molecular dynamics simulations of multi-component multi-phase systems. The procedure is exemplified by calculating the phase envelope of the methane–decane binary and of two synthetic light condensate mixtures. A methodology based on the discrete expansion of a mixture is used to determine the bubble points of these latter mixtures, with an excellent agreement to experimental data. The model presented is entirely predictive and an <b>abridged</b> <b>table</b> of parameters for some fluids of interest is provided...|$|E

40|$|The {{life table}} is so {{valuable}} a descrip-tion {{of the age}} variation in danger of dying that it is desirable to have rapid methods of obtaining it from the recorded vital statistics. The principal value of the life table lies in the form in which age-specific risks of dying are stated. They are expressed as the probability of dying within a designated interval subsequent to an exact age, or as the probability of surviving from one exact age to another. Such probabilities are not only very de-scriptive, but they lend themselves readily {{to the treatment of}} mortality {{in a wide variety of}} problems. The fundamental element in the con-struction of a life table for a particular time is thus to convert the observed age-specific death rates for that time into the probabilities of dying within stated age intervals. There is nothing in the definition of the probability of dying which fixes the length of these intervals. They may be chosen to suit the needs of the problem. The term "complete life table " has by custom come to designate a table in which the interval is 1 year, and the probability is stated for every 'Paper no. 212 from the Department of Biostatistics, School of Hygiene and Public Health, The Johns Hopkins University, Balti-more, Md. year of age.

30|$|Daunting as well is the {{challenge}} of mortality forecasting for countries for which only <b>abridged</b> life <b>tables</b> by sex are available, such as Colombia. The contribution by Gisou Díaz and Ana Debón (University of Tolima, Colombia; University of Valencia, Spain) described these difficulties. Whereas the Human Mortality Database is {{an important source of}} very detailed and high-quality mortality information for low-mortality countries (Barbieri et al. 2015), mortality data for Latin America are collected in the Latin American Human Mortality Database (Urdinola and Queiroz 2017) and the most detailed life table information comes from <b>abridged</b> life <b>tables.</b> Applying current mortality modelling methods and mortality forecasting methods in a situation in which <b>abridged</b> life <b>tables</b> are the most important and the most detailed sources of information can be daunting. Díaz and Debón systematically evaluated the performance of seven variants of the Lee-Carter (LC) method using <b>abridged</b> life <b>tables</b> for the 1973 – 2005 period for Colombia, and the StMoMo package in R (Villegas et al. 2018). They demonstrated the difficulties involved in using different age-period-cohort (APC) models with the limited data, and in dealing with the high mortality among young adult men resulting from homicides, assaults or other violent acts. They found that the fit of the three models that in fact converged (the LC method, the LC method with two terms (LC 2) and a simple APC method) was, in general, higher among women than among men. The LC 2 outperformed the LC method, as it better captured the mortality hump among young adult men, while the simple APC method performed worst. In their discussion, the authors outline the implications of insurance companies failing {{to take into account the}} mortality hump among Colombian men.|$|R

As population data were only available for the last four censuses (1973, 1985, 1993, 2005), the information was completed using linear interpolation to calculate the population between censuses (1974 to 1984, 1986 to 1992, and 1994 to 2004). With these data, it was possible to calculate <b>abridged</b> <b>tables</b> for Colombia from 1973 to 2005. The method of obtaining the mortality tables is described in Díaz and Debón (2016).

30|$|As in {{many other}} {{countries}} all over the world, all the models predict better mortality for women as mortality experience for women has less fluctuations. In addition, {{it is important to}} highlight the use of these seven models in <b>abridged</b> life <b>tables</b> and the results found despite the non-convergence of some models. In this study, the models presented problems of convergence with the cohort effect with both R-packages for men, except the APC model. The convergence problem for mortality models with cohort effect has been pointed out by other authors such as Debón et al. (2010), Hunt and Villegas (2015), and Kennes (2017). In this study, we would like to remark that the cohort effect presents problems of estimation of the parameters on <b>abridged</b> life <b>tables</b> as cohorts represent subsets of five cohorts with different numbers of observations. On the other hand, the CBD model demonstrated very bad behavior for infants and advanced ages. Therefore, the comparison was carried out by fitting LC, LC 2, and APC.
