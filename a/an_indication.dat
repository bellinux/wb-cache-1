5|$|Early critics, such as Thomas Campbell in 1838, {{saw this}} {{constant}} {{allusion to the}} theatre as <b>an</b> <b>indication</b> that Prospero was meant to represent Shakespeare; the character's renunciation of magic thus signalling Shakespeare's farewell to the stage. This theory persists among later critics, and remains solidly within the critical canon.|$|E
5|$|Eva Longoria was {{announced}} {{as an executive}} producer on March 26. She had worked previously with Cherry on Desperate Housewives, and was hired to add perspective to the Latina roles. ABC Studios gave Cherry permission to start making senior staffing offers for the show on May 1, which was perceived as <b>an</b> <b>indication</b> that the show would be picked up.|$|E
50|$|As {{previously}} mentioned, the focusing technique {{can also}} be used to help discriminate between ‘real' and ‘false' <b>indications,</b> <b>a</b> ‘false' <b>indication</b> being <b>a</b> received signal that does not directly correspond to the position of a defect; such as those from reverberations or from incomplete cancellation of unwanted wave modes. If <b>a</b> ‘false' <b>indication</b> is present in the A-scan data, it will also be re-represented in any C-scan type results as this type of processing uses the same original data. As active focusing involves a separate data collection, focusing at the position of <b>a</b> ‘false' <b>indication</b> will give <b>a</b> negative result, whereas focusing on <b>a</b> ‘true' <b>indication</b> will give <b>a</b> positive result. Therefore, the active focusing technique can help overcome the propensity of ‘false calls' generated by guided wave testing systems.|$|R

5|$|Sources {{are silent}} {{regarding}} the events following the first Persian campaign but the silence {{in itself is}} <b>an</b> <b>indication</b> of the peace that prevailed and that the Persians stopped being {{a threat to the}} Roman East. The evidence for the second campaign is meager; Zosimus is the only one to mention it specifically. A passage in the Sibylline Oracles is interpreted by Hartmann as <b>an</b> <b>indication</b> of the second invasion. The campaign took place in 266 or 267 and was aimed directly at Ctesiphon; Odaenathus reached the walls of the Persian capital but had to cancel the siege and march north to face the influx of Germanic riders attacking Anatolia.|$|E
5|$|Subcutaneous {{emphysema}} of {{the chest}} wall is commonly among the first signs to appear that barotrauma, damage caused by excessive pressure, has occurred, and it is <b>an</b> <b>indication</b> that the lung was subjected to significant barotrauma.

50|$|Another safety {{consideration}} is how sensors are wired. If a device {{is capable of}} failing in a particular state, then the failure should be such that <b>a</b> false <b>indication</b> of pressure is given. This is far better than <b>a</b> false <b>indication</b> of no pressure.|$|R

5|$|<b>An</b> <b>indication</b> of the army's high esteem for barbarian-born troops is {{that they}} appear to have been {{preferentially}} recruited to the elite units of the late imperial era's armies. In the auxilia palatina infantry regiments, the proportion of barbarians in the ranks appears to have numbered anywhere between a third and a half of effectives (compared to a quarter in the army as a whole). From the late 3rd century onwards, barbarian recruitment became crucial to the army's continued existence, by providing a much-needed source of first-rate recruits.|$|E

5|$|An unusual {{element is}} that the tale draws its {{characters}} from essentially the same cast as Táin Bó Cuailnge, making mention of some thirty heroes from that narrative, yet never once mentions Cú Chulainn. Chadwick suggests this is probably <b>an</b> <b>indication</b> of the antiquity of {{the tradition of the}} story's tradition, predating the development of Cú Chulainn's story within the Ulster Cycle. Some of the rhetorical verse elements are old and obscure, but certain seemingly parodic elements of the genre at least suggest a later composition of the present form.|$|E
5|$|At an {{estimated}} , IK Pegasi B {{is considered to}} be a high-mass white dwarf. Although its radius has not been observed directly, it can be estimated from known theoretical relationships between the mass and radius of white dwarfs, giving a value of about 0.60% of the Sun's radius. (A different source gives a value of 0.72%, so there remains some uncertainty in this result.) Thus this star packs a mass greater than the Sun into a volume roughly the size of the Earth, giving <b>an</b> <b>indication</b> of this object's extreme density.|$|E
5|$|Because {{of their}} legal status as {{citizens}} {{and the degree to}} which they could become emancipated, women could own property, enter contracts, and engage in business, including shipping, manufacturing, and lending money. Inscriptions throughout the Empire honour women as benefactors in funding public works, <b>an</b> <b>indication</b> they could acquire and dispose of considerable fortunes; for instance, the Arch of the Sergii was funded by Salvia Postuma, a female member of the family honoured, and the largest building in the forum at Pompeii was funded by Eumachia, a priestess of Venus.|$|E

5|$|Bupropion {{is one of}} few {{antidepressants}} {{that does}} not cause sexual dysfunction. A range of studies demonstrate that bupropion not only produces fewer sexual side effects than other antidepressants, but can actually help to alleviate sexual dysfunction.

There have also been a few studies suggesting that bupropion can improve sexual function in women who are not depressed, if they have hypoactive sexual desire disorder (HSDD).|$|E
