The unit uses self recuperative FLOX ® burners arranged in a “nozzle field ” and is designed to preheat the strip up to 400 °C. The required heating length is reduced to one fourth of a comparable radiant tube furnace section.

50|$|Production of {{galvannealed}} {{sheet steel}} begins with {{hot dip galvanization}} of sheet steel. After passing through the galvanizing zinc bath the sheet steel passes through air knives to remove excess zinc, and is then heated in an annealing furnace for several seconds causing iron and zinc layers to diffuse into one another causing the formation of zinc-iron alloy layers at the surface. The annealing step is performed with the strip still hot after the galvanizing step, with the zinc still liquid. The galvanising bath contains slightly over 0.1% aluminium, added to form a layer bonding between the iron and coated zinc. Annealing temperatures are around 500 to 565 °C. Pre-1990 <b>annealing</b> <b>lines</b> used gas-fired heating; post-1990s the use of induction furnaces became common.|$|R

The final microstructure, which leads to mechanical properties of the product, {{is strongly dependent on}} the processing of the steel. Apart from hot-rolling and cold-rolling, the parameters during continuous annealing are of great importance to control the properties of the final product. This thesis is aimed to study the influence of heating rates on the microstructual evolution of a DP-steel during continuous <b>annealing</b> <b>lines.</b> The microstructual evolution evolves several phenomena, such as ferrite recrystallization, pearlite degradation, and austenite phase transformation. Experimental approaches as dilatometry and SEM are used to investigate the evolution, by applying different heating rates and stop-quenching at different temperature and soaking times.

40|$|NiTi {{shape memory}} thin films are {{potentially}} desirable for MEMS actuators. Traditionally, {{there are two}} approaches to obtain NiTi shape memory thin films. One is to anneal amorphous NiTi films in a vacuum chamber {{and the other is}} to deposit NiTi on a high temperature substrate (about 500 °C). Both approaches have difficulty in terms of compatibility with traditional IC techniques, and are not applicable for annealing a prescribed local area of a NiTi film at the micron scale. In this paper, a new approach, CO 2 laser annealing, which can overcome both problems mentioned above, is presented. Results of optical microscopy, x-ray diffraction (XRD) and atomic force microscopy (AFM) reveal the crystalline structures and phase transformation in annealed NiTi films. Furthermore, a CO 2 laser <b>annealed</b> <b>line,</b> about 100 µm in width, demonstrates the capability of a CO 2 laser for local annealing of NiTi thin film...|$|R

40|$|The {{computation}} of {{optimal control}} variables for a two-stage steel annealing process (SAP) which comprises {{of one or}} more furnaces is proposed in this paper.

The optimal solutions including optimal line speed, optimal cost, and job completion time obtained through these three methods are compared with each other and those obtained via conventional PSO (cPSO) with time varying inertia weight (TVIW) and time varying acceleration coefficient (TVAC).

40|$|Interstitial free (IF) {{steel is}} used {{extensively}} throughout {{applications in the}} automotive, packaging and furniture industries due to its excellent formability and ductility. The manufacturing process ensures excellent material properties for subsequent forming processes are developed through {{the formation of a}} fine equi-axed grain structure and crystallographic texture. The annealing process improves the formability of the cold rolled IF sheet, whilst also reducing strength through the recovery and recrystallisation process. After the cold rolling process the grain structure is heavily deformed. During the recovery process the dislocation density is reduced through annihilation and redistribution of dislocations to form sub grains. During the recrystallisation process new grains nucleate and grow into new, strain free, grains. Magnetic properties of ferromagnetic material are known to be affected by microstructural phenomena such as dislocation density, grain boundaries, grain size and texture. It is therefore possible to monitor the recovery and recrystallisation processes using sensors that are responsive to changes in magnetic properties. The purpose of the research completed was to establish whether {{it would be possible to}} use electromagnetic (EM) sensors to monitor recovery and recrystallisation processes in-situ during heat treatment, such that EM sensors could then be deployed in a continuous <b>annealing</b> <b>line...</b>|$|E

40|$|Ultra-high {{strength}} {{steel sheets}} {{have been subjected}} to heat treatments that simulate the thermal cycles in hot-dip galvanising and galvannealing processes and evaluated with respect to their resulting mechanical properties and microstructures. The steels contained suitable contents of carbon (∼ 0. 2 %), manganese (1. 2 %) and chromium (0. 4 %) to ensure that they could be fully transformed to martensite after austenitisation followed by rapid cooling in a continuous <b>annealing</b> <b>line,</b> prior to galvanising. Different contents of vanadium (0 – 0. 1 %) and nitrogen (0. 002 – 0. 012 %) were used to investigate the possible role of these microalloying elements on the strength of the tempered martensite. Vanadium, especially when in combination with a raised nitrogen content, helps to resist the effect of tempering so that a larger proportion of the initial strengthening is preserved after the galvanising cycle, giving tensile strength levels exceeding 1000  MPa. Different deoxidation practices using aluminium or silicon have also been included. These showed similar strength levels at corresponding carbon contents but the bendability of the Si-killed steel sheet was considerably superior. Microstructural examinations have been made on the annealed steels but the reason for the beneficial effect of vanadium is still not fully explained. It is concluded that microalloying with vanadium is a very promising approach in the development of corrosion-resistant ultra-high strength steel sheet products...|$|E
40|$|The {{key to the}} {{understanding}} of the mechanical behavior of dual phase (DP) steels is to a large extent to be found in the microstructure. The microstructure is in its turn a result of the chemical composition and the process parameters during its production. In this thesis the connection between microstructure and mechanical properties is studied, with focus on the microstructure development during annealing in a continuous <b>annealing</b> <b>line.</b> In-line trials as well as the lab simulations have been carried out in order to investigate the impact of alloying elements and process parameters on the microstructure. Further, a dislocation model has been developed in order to analyze the work hardening behavior of DP steels during plastic deformation. From the in-line trials it was concluded that there is an inheritance from the hot rolling process both on the microstructure and properties of the cold rolled and annealed product. Despite large cold rolling reductions, recrystallization and phase transformations, the final dual phase steel is still effected by process parameters far back in the production chain, such as the coiling temperature following the hot rolling. Lab simulations showed that the microstructure and consequently the mechanical properties are impacted not only by the chemical composition of the steel but also by a large number of process parameters such as soaking temperature, cooling rate prior to quenching, quench and temper annealing temperature.  QC 2010100...|$|E

The paper contains the results of the inquiry under the above mentioned point of view. The dynamics of the accident, the main causes and the consequences have been defined. This was an unusual accident from which important lessons can be learned. On December 6, a modest fire developed in the entry section of a pickling and <b>annealing</b> <b>line</b> in the TK plant in Turin. The eight workers on duty seized the firefighting equipment and started to try to extinguish the fire. The workers had portable fire extinguishers and a fire hydrant, so they had to get close to the fire to fight it. Suddenly, a violent jet fire, caused by the rupture of a hydraulic circuit, occurred. The flame instantaneously struck the eight workers while they were still fighting the fire. Seven workers suffered very serious burns, one died instantaneously while the other six had over the following month. One of the workers, who was partly protected by an operating machine, suffered only minor burns and survived. The paper contains some important lessons that have been learned from the present case, which demonstrate that the fire risk at pickling and annealing lines has generally been underestimated by the steel industry. The fire risk due to hydraulic actuators is also evident and new fire fighting strategies are suggested...|$|E

Complementary DNA probes containing the constant-region sequences of kappa and lambdaI light chain and alpha, gamma 2 b, and mu heavy chain mRNAs were annealed to a large excess of DNA {{from a series of}} eight mouse-human hybrid cell lines that are deficient for various mouse chromosomes.

40|$|The {{effect of}} oxygen {{fugacity}} on hydroxyl speciation and solubility in San Carlos olivine {{was investigated in}} a series of piston cylinder experiments at 2. 0  GPa and 1100 and 1300  °C. The presence of enstatite was intended to fix silica activity and experimental fO 2 in most runs was regulated by lining the inner walls of the sample-containing Pt capsules with either Fe, Ni or Re foil. Polarised infrared absorbance spectra show that olivine <b>annealed</b> in capsules <b>lined</b> with Fe foil only contain hydroxyl defects with vibrational energies between 3650 and 3400  cm- 1 (relatively high frequencies). Spectra of crystals <b>annealed</b> in capsules <b>lined</b> with Ni or Re foil show that these samples contain hydroxyl defects with vibrational energies between 3650 and 3400  cm- 1 (high frequency), and at 3355 and 3325  cm- 1 (low-frequency). The concentrations of hydroxyl defects responsible for absorptions at 3355 and 3325  cm- 1 change as a function of oxygen fugacity and are, therefore, interpreted as Fe 3 +-related OH centres. Hydroxyl solubility in our experiments is substantially less than current solubility laws might suggest. These differences may be attributed to variations in experimental procedure, but they also demonstrate that the incorporation of hydroxyl in olivine must be better understood before an accurate model to describe water solubility in the deep Earth can be constructed. Our data show that, when experiments conducted at identical P-T conditions are compared, olivine annealed at low fO 2 (below Fe-FeO) contains less than half as much water as crystals from relatively more oxidised experiments. Because natural mantle conditions approximate to those of our low fO 2 experiments, current solubility laws - which are based on data from relatively high fO 2 experiments - overestimate the amount of water that can be hosted in olivine in the upper mantle. From a consideration of defect equilibria we propose a mechanism for the incorporation of OH in olivine {{in a way that is}} appropriate for the actual range of conditions expected in the mantle. © 2007 Elsevier B.

The annealing properties of the films have been characterized by means of x-ray diffraction, Raman scattering, Rutherford backscattering (RBS), elastic recoil detection analysis (ERDA) and photoluminescence spectra. The results indicate that high crystal quality ZnO film has been obtained after annealing. The full width at half-maximum of ω rocking curves is only 369 arcsec. The Raman spectra show a strong high frequency E 2 mode peak comparable to that for bulk ZnO. The intensity ratio of the E 1 (LO) peak to E 2 high peak before annealing is 0. 81 and after annealing 0. 75.

The 59 Co NMR spectrum of the Heusler compound Co 2 FeAl 0. 5 Si 0. 5 consists of four main resonance lines with an underlying sub-structure. The splitting into the main resonance lines is explained by contributions of the B 2 type structure. The sub-lines are attributed to a random distribution of Al and Si.

The protein co-immunoprecipitates with RNA editing ribonucleoprotein complexes, which suggests that gBP 21 contributes its annealing activity to the RNA editing machinery. In support of this view, gBP 21 was found to accelerate the hybridization of cognate guide (g) RNA/pre-edited mRNA pairs. Here we analyze the mechanism of the gBP 21 -mediated RNA annealing reaction. Three possible modes of action are considered: chaperone function, matchmaker function and product stabilization. We conclude that gBP 21 works as a matchmaker by binding to gRNAs {{as one of the}} two RNA <b>annealing</b> reactants. Three <b>lines</b> of evidence substantiate this model. First, gBP 21 and gRNAs form a thermodynamically and kinetically stable complex in a 1 + 1 stoichiometry. Secondly, gRNA-bound gBP 21 stabilizes single-stranded RNA, which can be considered the transition state in the annealing reaction. Thirdly, gBP 21 has a low affinity for double-stranded RNAs, suggesting the release of the annealed reaction product after the hybridization step. In the process, up to six ionic bonds are formed between gBP 21 and a gRNA, which decreases the net negative charge of the RNA. As a consequence, the electrostatic repulsion between the two annealing reactants is reduced favoring the hybridization reaction...|$|R

It {{was found that}} these methods of annealing have dramatically different influence on the RS <b>lines.</b> <b>Annealing</b> in vacuum below 500 ^∘C leads to significant decrease of both D-line, associated with defects, and 2 D-line, associated with the intact lattice structure, which {{can be explained by}} annealing-induced enhanced doping. Further annealing in vacuum up to 1000 ^∘C leads to significant increase of 2 D-line together with continuous decrease of D-line, which gives evidence of partial removal of defects and recovery of the damaged lattice. Annealing in forming gas is less effective in this sense. The blue shift of all lines is observed after annealing. It is shown that below 500 ^∘C, the unintentional doping is the main mechanism of shift, while at higher annealing temperatures, the lattice strain dominates due to mismatch of the thermal expansion coefficient of graphene and the SiO_ 2 substrate. Inhomogeneous distribution of stress and doping across the samples leads to the correlated variation of the amplitude and the peak position of RS lines. Comment: LaTeX, 7 pages, 11 eps files.
