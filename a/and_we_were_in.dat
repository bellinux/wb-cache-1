Within two hours, we had this {{incredible}} seed for this song, 'Hero'. It was never meant for Mariah to sing. In her mind, we were writing a song for Gloria Estefan for this movie. And we went into an area that Mariah didn't really go into-in her words, {{it was a little bit}} too schmaltzy or too ballady or too old-fashioned as far as melody and lyrics.|$|E
500|$|The ANAK Society {{explained}} {{its name}} as originating from {{a passage in}} the Book of Numbers, one of the books of the Hebrew Bible. The passage, attributed to , reads, [...] "And there were the Nephilin, the sons of ANAK, who came of the giants: <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>in</b> our own sight as grasshoppers, {{and so we were}} in their sight." [...] Anak was a biblical figure said to be the forefather of the Nephilim, a race of giants. For unknown reasons, the society's name has sustained minor alterations over the years, from Anak in the 1908 Blue Print, the first edition of Georgia Tech's yearbook, to ANAK in recent editions of The Technique, Georgia Tech's student newspaper.|$|E
500|$|Despite {{remaining}} unenthusiastic {{with the}} script, Kanter agreed to commission it {{as a film}} {{on the condition that}} he reserve the right to select a [...] "" [...] director. Anderson would have selected David Lane, who had directed the two Thunderbirds film sequels, Thunderbirds Are Go (1966) and Thunderbird 6 (1968). After a ten-week delay to filming, Robert Parrish, an American director whose latest project had been shelved, accepted the post. Parrish's film career up to 1968 had included co-editing Body and Soul (for which he had shared the 1947 Academy Award for Best Film Editing) and co-directing the 1967 James Bond spoof, Casino Royale. Anderson remembered Parrish as being [...] "very ingratiating", stating that he [...] "told us he loved the script and said it would be an honour to work with us. Jay Kanter gave Bob the thumbs up <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>in</b> business." [...] Although the box office failure of Casino Royale had prompted Anderson to question Parrish's ability, he stated that Doppelgänger could not have been made without his recruitment: [...] "It wasn't a question of, 'Will we get on with him?' or, 'Is he the right man?' He was a name director, so we signed him up immediately." ...|$|E

500|$|As {{they began}} to play, bassist Adam Clayton {{developed}} a bassline. The part was originally based on the Grandmaster Melle Mel song [...] "White Lines (Don't Don't Do It)" [...] before Clayton changed to a more trance-like bassline. Vocalist Bono created some melodies and sang over the music. During the album's recording, Bono had become tired of writing in the first-person and he began writing lyrics and singing {{from the perspective of}} different characters. During the writing of [...] "Moment of Surrender", Bono assumed the character of a drug addict having a crisis of faith. The song title was borrowed from the Alcoholics Anonymous term for when an addict admits being [...] "powerless over alcohol" [...] and needs help. Bono had attempted to use the phrase [...] "vision over visibility" [...] in the lyrics of earlier songs; however, [...] "Moment of Surrender" [...] was the first song where he felt it was appropriate to be used. Eno called Bono's singing in this character as [...] "so heartbreaking agonized and vulnerable", creating a feeling like [...] "a knife to the heart". Lanois contributed by developing the gospel-like chorus. The uneven hi-hat from the drum part stems from Mullen's electronic drum kit malfunctioning during the song's recording. Eno was amazed by each performer's ability to develop and play their part without any instructions or cues. After the song's recording completed, everyone in the studio, including a gathering of production personnel and visitors, was completely silent, and Eno suggested {{it was as if they}} had gone on an [...] "emotional adventure of some kind". He called the song's recording [...] "the most amazing studio experience I've ever had", and he believes the [...] "emotional crescendo" [...] heard in the song properly captures how they felt as they improvised the piece. Bono stated [...] "it was a spell <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>in</b> it".|$|E

Moreover, the Russians were at last moving to meet them. [...] Scarlett was first into Ryzhov's cavalry, closely followed by his staff, and, initially, just three squadrons – two of the Scots Greys on the left, {{and one of the}} 6th (Inniskilling) Dragoons on the right, totalling 300 men. The first to feel the force of the British attack were the Ingermanland Hussars, under the command of Major General Khaletsky. Staff-captain Arbuzov later described how they [...] " [...] … had to fight with the regiment of Queen Victoria's Dragoon Guards in their red coats … Neither we nor the English wanted to yield." [...] A British Dragoon later described the action from his own perspective – [...] "They were so superior in numbers, they outflanked us, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>in</b> the middle of them … I hope God will forgive me, for I felt more like a devil than a man." ...|$|E

2500|$|In late April 1994, {{the band}} {{relocated}} to Criteria Studios in Miami, Florida, but recording was disrupted because Stipe {{suffered from a}} tooth abscess that required medical attention. Unlike previous album sessions, by the time production had moved to Ocean Way Recording in Los Angeles, California, the band was behind schedule. Litt attributed the delay to recording live at Crossover, which lengthened the mixing process; he told Rolling Stone, [...] "We're {{trying to figure out}} how raw to leave it and how much to studiofy it." [...] At the same time, Stipe was still writing when the band was supposed to be mixing the record. Tension arose between the band members, who were staying in different locations in Los Angeles and would rarely be in the studio at the same time. Tensions came to a head when the group was recording at Louie's Clubhouse, Litt's home studio in Los Angeles, where years later Stipe recalled, [...] "We broke up [...] [...] [...] We reached the point where none of us could speak to each other, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>in</b> a small room, and we just said 'Fuck off' and that was it." [...] The group had a meeting to resolve its issues; Mills told Rolling Stone, [...] "We have to begin working as a unit again, which we haven't been doing very well lately." ...|$|E
