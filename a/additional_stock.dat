KKR began to reduce its ownership in RJR in 1994, when its stock in RJR was used as part of the consideration for its leveraged buyout of Borden, Inc., a producer of food and beverage products, consumer products, and industrial products, in an unprecedented and complex transaction.|$|E
5|$|The Marshlink Action Group is a {{volunteer}} group {{set up in}} 2003 {{in the interests of}} passengers using the line. The group are concerned about its facilities, particularly the use of Class 171 DMUs when all connecting lines have been electrified. They have reported a high proportion of children and the elderly use the line compared to others in the south east, and that trains are now at capacity but there is no <b>additional</b> <b>stock</b> because of its state as an isolated non-electric line. In 2016, Rudd chaired a working group to look at short and long-term plans for upgrading the Marshlink line, including the potential accommodation of Class 395 rolling stock.|$|E
5|$|The {{suite of}} pre-loaded apps bundled with Windows 8 were changed in Windows 8.1; PC Settings was {{expanded}} to include options that were previously exclusive to the desktop Control Panel, Windows Store was updated with an improved interface for browsing apps and automatic updates, the Mail app includes an updated interface and additional features, the Camera app integrates Photosynth for creating panoramas, and additional editing tools {{were added to the}} Photos app (while integration with Flickr and Facebook was completely removed). A number of <b>additional</b> <b>stock</b> apps were also added, including Calculator, Food and Drink, Health and Fitness, Sound Recorder, Reading List (which can be used to collect and sync content from apps through OneDrive), Scan, and Help + Tips. For Windows RT users, Windows 8.1 also adds a version of Microsoft Outlook to the included Office 2013 RT suite. However, it does not support data loss protection, Group Policy, Lync integration, or creating emails with information rights management. Windows Store is enabled by default within Windows To Go environments.|$|E

This netted Ullico about $1.1 billion in profit.|$|E
25|$|In 1878, Smith {{used his}} mining profits {{to partner with}} Horace Tabor, Chaffee and Moffat in the buying and {{developing}} the Little Pittsburg Mine in Leadville. The Little Pittsburg produced vast quantities of silver and started the silver boom in Leadville. Smith was placed {{in charge of the}} mine. <b>Additional</b> <b>stock</b> in the mine was sold. But the ore suddenly petered out, and the stock price collapsed. Investors later learned that Chaffee, Moffat and the other initial owners had sold out early, reaping large profits. Accusations that the initial investors had received insider information about the mine's status were never proved.|$|E

The decision {{was based on the}} large existing stocks of smoothbore muskets in U.S. arsenals, which he argued could be re-rifled {{in the same manner as}} the Parrott guns (an assertion which proved incorrect). He also adamantly opposed the introduction of breech-loading repeating rifles, on the basis that they would encourage poor fire discipline and waste ammunition.|$|R

25|$|On October 28, 2008, Wells Fargo was the {{recipient}} of $25 billion of Emergency Economic Stabilization Act funds {{in the form of}} a preferred stock purchase by the US Treasury. Tests by the Federal government revealed that Wells Fargo needed an additional $13.7billion in order to remain well capitalized if the economy were to deteriorate further under stress test scenarios. On May 11, 2009 Wells Fargo announced an <b>additional</b> <b>stock</b> offering which was completed on May 13, 2009 raising $8.6billion in capital. The remaining $4.9billion in capital was planned to be raised through earnings. On Dec. 23, 2009, Wells Fargo redeemed the $25 billion of preferred stock issued to the US Treasury. As part of the redemption of the preferred stock, Wells Fargo also paid accrued dividends of $131.9million, bringing the total dividends paid to $1.441billion since the preferred stock was issued in October 2008.|$|E

[...] Descendant breeds of the English Water Spaniel are thought to include the American Water Spaniel, which was also developed using <b>additional</b> <b>stock</b> from the Irish Water Spaniel and the Flat Coated Retriever breeds. The Curly Coated Retriever is considered to have descended from the Poodle, the retrieving setter, the St. John's water dog and the English Water Spaniel. Records for {{the origin of the}} modern Field Spaniel are more precise and show that one of the four progenitor dogs used in creating the breed was an English Water Spaniel-Cocker Spaniel cross which was registered at the time as a Sussex Spaniel due to his liver colour.|$|E

500|$|The player-character, {{a robotic}} maid named Marina, {{journeys}} {{to save her}} kidnapped creator. The story takes place on Planet Clancer, a world {{on the cusp of}} civil war due to the actions of its Emperor and his Imperial forces. The Emperor brainwashes Clancers to kidnap the visiting robotics genius Professor Theo. Theo's creation, the player-character Ultra-InterGalactic-Cybot G Marina Liteyears, pursues the professor and grabs, throws, and shakes the obstacles in her way, such as enemies, floating [...] "Clanball" [...] platforms, warp stars, and missiles. Indeed, almost all game objects can be grabbed, which lends towards the shake-based combat system. Marina can shake [...] "grabbed" [...] objects to throw them as projectiles or to find loot. Objects sometimes change functions when shaken, such as items that become homing missiles and guns with multi-directional shots. Some drop red, blue, and green gems, which restore player health. The health gauge {{in the corner of the}} screen shows the amount of damage Marina can take. The player can store up to two <b>additional</b> <b>stock</b> lives. Yellow gems hidden in each level extend the final cutscene's length. Marina can run, jump, and boost (via jetpack) in the eight cardinal and ordinal directions. She can also slide, hover, and roll.|$|E

60|$|This was, indeed, a masterly stroke on {{the part}} of the boys. They knew that, even {{deducting}} those who had set forth, there would still be an amply sufficient force in the city to defeat and crush their band; but they thought that, by a quick stroke, they might succeed in inflicting a heavy blow upon them. Each of the bands therefore had instructions, after doing its allotted share of incendiarism, to make for the town, and to meet at a certain point outside it. Then, quietly and noiselessly, they had entered. One party fell upon the armory, and another attacked with fury the governor's house. The guards there were, as had happened with his residence in the country, cut down. Fire was applied in a dozen places and, before the astonished troops and inhabitants could rally, from the different parts of the town, the negroes were again in the country; having fulfilled their object, and carried off with them a large <b>additional</b> <b>stock</b> of arms.|$|E

His money--even the <b>additional</b> <b>stock</b> he had raised from the {{disposal}} of his spare clothes (and that was not much, for clothes, though dear to buy, are cheap to pawn)--was fast diminishing. Yet what could he do? At times an agony came over him in which he darted forth again, though he was but newly home, and, returning to some place {{where he had been}} already twenty times, made some new attempt to gain his end, but always unsuccessfully. He was years and years too old for a cabin-boy, and years upon years too inexperienced to be accepted as a common seaman. His dress and manner, too, militated fatally against any such proposal as the latter; and yet he was reduced to making it; for even if he could have contemplated the being set down in America totally without money, he had not enough left now for a steerage passage and the poorest provisions upon the voyage.|$|E

50|$|The flip-in is a {{provision}} in the target company's corporate charter or bylaws. The provision gives current shareholders of a targeted company, other than the hostile acquirer, rights to purchase <b>additional</b> <b>stocks</b> in the targeted company at a discount. These rights to purchase occur only before a potential takeover, and when the acquirer surpasses a certain threshold point of obtaining outstanding shares (usually 20 - 50%). If the potential acquirer triggers a poison pill by accumulating more than the threshold level of shares, it risks discriminatory dilution in the target company. The threshold level therefore effectively sets a ceiling on the amount of stock that any shareholder can accumulate before being required, for practical purposes, to launch a proxy contest.|$|R
