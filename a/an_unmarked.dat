5|$|Psychological {{studies found}} that {{individuals}} with little mathematics education tend to estimate quantities logarithmically, that is, they position a number on <b>an</b> <b>unmarked</b> line according to its logarithm, so that 10 is positioned as close to 100 as 100 is to 1000. Increasing education shifts this to a linear estimate (positioning 1000 10x as far away) in some circumstances, while logarithms are used when the numbers to be plotted are difficult to plot linearly.|$|E

5000|$|... "The use of {{a single}} marker... is {{sufficient}} to indicate the persons and grammatical functions... The GFM function morpheme system in TEX Popoluca always uses only a single prefix on a given verb."

Group Y marks the Past Absolutive but leaves the <b>A</b> <b>unmarked.</b> Group Z {{seems to be a}} separate and autonomous set. This pattern, where sometimes the P is marked and sometimes the A is marked, is called inverse alternation (Reilly 2004, 53-54)." ...|$|R
