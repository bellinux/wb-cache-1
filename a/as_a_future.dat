5|$|Hunt's skill on {{the field}} and {{positive}} influence on other team members led to his emergence, early in 2007, <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>future</b> candidate for the Broncos captaincy. Broncos chief executive Bruno Cullen stated that such a move would have his and the Broncos management's full support. Current captain Lockyer also gave his support to Hunt being the next captain, saying that he has the respect of fellow players and the necessary leadership qualities.|$|E
5|$|Identified <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>future</b> Test prospect, he was {{selected}} in a Western Australia Combined XI for a match against the touring England cricket team {{at the start of}} the 1958–59 season in Perth. Prior to the match, O'Neill was hounded by the media. The tourists decided to test him with short-pitched bowling, especially Fred Trueman. O'Neill decided to abstain from hooking, while attacking the spin of Jim Laker with a series of sweep shots. After four and a half hours of uncharacteristic restraint, he compiled 104 with an emphasis on off side play. He took a total of 2/67, removing Fred Trueman and Arthur Milton.|$|E

5|$|In 1988 Regalian Properties {{purchased}} the site, and appointed Terry Farrell as architect. Farrell designed a self-contained community of shops, housing, offices and public spaces for the site. Regalian disliked the proposals and requested Farrell design a single large office block. Despite containing 50% more office space than the rejected Green Giant proposal, the design was accepted. The government then bought {{the site and}} design <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>future</b> headquarters for the Secret Intelligence Service, and the design was accordingly modified to increase security. In 1995 the SIS Building was opened on the site, and today dominates other buildings {{in the vicinity of}} the bridge.|$|E

5|$|In {{the late}} 1980s, {{it was decided}} to upgrade the Røa and Sognsvann Lines to metro standard. This would allow them to use T1000 stock. Twelve T2000 were ordered in 1991, and would be {{sufficient}} to operate the services on the Holmenkollen and Kolsås Lines, that would retain an overhead wire. The development costs for the T2000 were in part subsidized by the government, as the high-tech product from Strømmens Verksted (by then part of the ABB Group) and AEG was seen <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>future</b> export product. The trains were delivered in 1994 and taken into use in 1995. The same year, the metro started operating all services through the city center, connecting the western and eastern networks.|$|E

5|$|The sports venues {{were taken}} over by the {{respective}} municipalities. The Lillehammer venues are owned by the municipal Lillehammer Olympiapark, while similar companies were created for Hamar and Gjøvik. The International Broadcasting Center was built <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>future</b> campus for Lillehammer University College. The Main Press Center was converted to a business park. Only part of the athlete accommodation was built for permanent use, and was sold as regular housing after the Games. The rest was built as mobile units and sold {{to other parts of the}} country. Similarly, the media accommodation was built as a mix of permanent and temporary housing, with the latter being sold as cottages after the Games were completed.|$|E
5|$|This crater {{has also}} been {{proposed}} <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>future</b> site for a large infrared telescope. The low temperature of the crater floor makes it ideal for infrared observations, and solar cells placed along the rim could provide near-continuous power to the observatory. About 120 kilometers from the crater lies the 5-km tall Malapert Mountain, a peak that is perpetually visible from the Earth, and which {{could serve as a}} radio relay station when suitably equipped.|$|E
5|$|Although France had not {{completely}} defeated Austria, the Treaty of Schönbrunn, signed on 14 October 1809, nevertheless imposed a heavy political {{toll on the}} Austrians. As {{a result of the}} treaty, France received Carinthia, Carniola, and the Adriatic ports, while Galicia was given to the Poles, the Salzburg area of the Tyrol went to the Bavarians, and Russia was ceded the district of Tarnopol. Austria lost over three million subjects, about 20% of her total population. Emperor Francis also agreed to pay an indemnity equivalent to almost 85 million francs, gave recognition to Napoleon's brother Joseph as the King of Spain, and reaffirmed the exclusion of British trade from his remaining dominions.. The Austrian defeat {{paved the way for the}} marriage of Napoleon to the daughter of Emperor Francis, Marie Louise. Dangerously, Napoleon assumed that his marriage to Marie Louise would eliminate Austria <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>future</b> threat, but the Habsburgs were not as driven by familial ties as Napoleon thought.|$|E

5|$|As a consequence, Austria {{withdrew from}} the Coalition. Although France had not {{completely}} defeated them, the Treaty of Schönbrunn, signed on 14 October 1809, imposed a heavy political, territorial, and economic price. France received Carinthia, Carniola, and the Adriatic ports, while Galicia was given to France's ally Poland. The Salzburg area went to the French ally, Bavaria. Austria lost over three million subjects, about 20 percent of her total population, which dramatically reduced the military force that Austria could field. Francis also agreed to pay an indemnity equivalent to almost 85 million francs, gave recognition to Joseph Bonaparte as the King of Spain, and affirmed Habsburg participation in Napoleon's Continental System. Francis reluctantly agreed to Napoleon's marriage with his daughter, Marie Louise, which Napoleon assumed, incorrectly, would eliminate Austria <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>future</b> threat.|$|E
5|$|At some time, {{possibly}} in late 1702 or early 1703, Handel visited Berlin, {{where his father}} had held an honorary post as physician to the elector who, in 1701, had become the Prussian king Frederick I. In Berlin Handel first experienced Italian opera, and may have met the Italian composers Giovanni Bononcini and Attilio Ariosti, who were writing operas for Frederick's court. The king heard of Handel's abilities, and wanted him to train <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>future</b> court composer, but Handel's horizons had been broadened by his sojourn in Berlin and he was developing his own ideas for his future. He declined the king's offer, and returned to Halle to fulfil his year's contract at the Domkirche. With few career prospects available in his home city, Handel {{would have liked to}} go to Italy, but this, he realised, was not yet practicable, since he lacked both cash and contacts. Instead in mid-1703 he left Halle for Hamburg, a thriving free city which housed the leading opera house in northern Germany.|$|E
5|$|Before the 1894 season, MacLaren {{resigned}} from the bank to play a whole season of cricket. Lancashire {{at the time were}} undergoing a period of transition, and the captaincy was unsettled: three men captained the county {{in the first part of}} the season. In the absence of other amateurs with county experience who could play regularly, MacLaren was appointed captain. Wisden Cricketers' Almanack observed that MacLaren was young for the position, and largely unproven in cricket, but it supported the decision. After losing his first match in charge, the team improved in the latter part of the season to finish fourth in the Championship. MacLaren finished sixth in the Lancashire averages, and in total scored 1,105 runs at 25.69, but his batting had made little progress since his debut. However, his successful leadership of Lancashire led some press critics to suggest him <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>future</b> England captain. At the end of the season, he was a last-minute selection to tour Australia with a team led by Andrew Stoddart.|$|E
