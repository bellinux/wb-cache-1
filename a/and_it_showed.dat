5|$|Laffoon's {{administration}} {{was confronted by}} the economic difficulties of the Great Depression. While he proposed a number of improvements, money was not available in the state budget to implement his plans. In his first full year in office, he cut $11.5 million from the state budget, but it remained out-of-balance. The state issued additional interest-bearing warrants to cover its debts. In 1931, these warrants accounted for 24.2 percent of the state's receipts; by 1932, that number had climbed to 40.2 percent. In order to raise more funds, Laffoon proposed a 2 percent state sales tax in 1932. The proposal was extremely unpopular with merchants and private citizens, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>showed</b> little promise of passing in the General Assembly. On March 2, 1932, a mob of 100 anti-tax protesters stormed the governor's mansion, damaging some items inside. In {{an attempt to get}} the tax passed, Laffoon agreed to seek only a 1 percent tax. The proposal passed the House, but a Senate committee refused to report it to the full chamber for a vote.|$|E

The visual quality of the gravures was so high that when a set of prints failed to arrive for a Photo-Secession exhibition in Brussels, a selection of gravures from the magazine was hung instead. Most viewers assumed they were looking at the original photographs.|$|E

25|$|While {{searching for}} a {{companion}} to the large-proper-motion star Lalande 1299, in 1917 Dutch–American astronomer Adriaan van Maanen discovered a star with an even larger proper motion located a few arcminutes to the northeast. He estimated the annual proper motion of the latter as 3arcseconds. This star had been previously recorded on a plate taken November 11, 1896 for the Carte du Ciel Catalog of Toulouse, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>showed</b> an apparent magnitude of 12.3. The initial spectral classification was type F0.|$|E

25|$|In January, General de Lattre {{fell ill}} from cancer {{and had to}} return to France for treatment. He died there shortly {{thereafter}} and was replaced by General Raoul Salan as the overall commander of French forces in Indochina. Viet Minh launched attacks on Hòa Bình, forcing the French to withdraw back to their main positions on the De Lattre line by February 22, 1952.

25|$|After the {{improvement}} of 2000, though, in 2001 Noda joined the DoCoMo Dandelion Racing team, piloting a Reynard 2KL Mugen. In an ambitious operation, the team also ran an older Reynard 99L for one-time Benetton test driver Hidetoshi Mitsusada and Polish racer Jaroslav Wierczuk.

25|$|In the mid-table {{battle in}} Division Two, Yorkshire Phoenix went down despite an unbeaten 116 from England captain Michael Vaughan. Yorkshire were missing Ian Harvey for this game, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>showed,</b> as no other batsman passed 30 and Vaughan was woefully alone {{in getting the}} target up. It was {{eventually}} set at 217 for Kent Spitfires, and as Matthew Walker found his rhythm to hit seven fours in an unbeaten 56, Kent got to that target with five wickets and four balls to spare, despite Vaughan's off-breaks yielding two wickets for 42 runs.|$|E

Assisted by two uncles, he scrutinized original source materials and official U.S. Navy records. Roosevelt's carefully researched book, published in 1882, {{remains one of the most}} important scholarly studies of the war, complete with drawings of individual and combined ship maneuvers, charts depicting the differences in iron throw weights of cannon shot between rival forces, and analyses of the differences between British and American leadership down to the ship-to-ship level. Published in 1882, The Naval War of 1812 was praised for its scholarship and style, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>showed</b> Roosevelt to be a scholar of history. It remains a standard study of the war.|$|E

500|$|On August 18, 2008, a {{tropical}} wave which {{had left the}} coast of Africa five days previously, developed into a significant low pressure area about [...] west-southwest of the Cape Verde islands. This wave moved westward across the Atlantic in conditions that were not favorable for development. As it began to approach the Windward Islands conditions improved <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>showed</b> some signs of organization, but no circulation. Upon reaching the windward islands on August 23, bringing showers, thunderstorms, and generally squally weather, wind shear over the system decreased and atmospheric conditions improved. Over the eastern Caribbean Sea, about [...] south of Santo Domingo, a low level circulation began to form. Hours later well-defined curved bands and an improving circulation at the surface warranted that the system be designated {{a tropical}} depression.|$|E
500|$|The winning entry was by Angel Gracia and Cliff Guest <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>showed</b> {{the female}} protagonist (played by the director's sister Anabel Garcia) being {{supported}} and guided by her girlfriends who introduce {{her with the}} male protagonist. The girl even goes to the boy's door to gift him flowers, thereby reversing the usual gender-directed pattern of gift-giving. The male protagonist is portrayed as a [...] "perfect boy" [...] (played by William Fitzgibbon) having the sensibilities like attentiveness, cuteness, playfulness like a friend (after the lyrics [...] "You're my best friend") and not sexual overtones. The video in-turn contrasts him with a self-centered boy who puts on sunglasses, throws his leather jacket {{over his shoulder and}} walks away from the girl.

500|$|The Mk 13 FC Radar {{supplied}} present target range, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>showed</b> {{the fall}} of shot around the target so the Gunnery Officer could correct the system's aim with range and deflection spots put into the Rangekeeper. It could also automatically track the target by controlling the director's bearing power drive. Because of radar, Fire Control systems are able to track and fire at targets at a greater range and with increased accuracy during the day, night, or inclement weather. This was demonstrated in November 1942 when the battleship [...] engaged the Imperial Japanese Navy battlecruiser Kirishima at a range of [...] at night. The engagement left Kirishima in flames, and she was ultimately scuttled by her crew. This capability gave the United States Navy a major advantage in World War II, as the Japanese did not develop radar or automated fire control {{to the level of}} the US Navy and were at a significant disadvantage.

[...] He also defended his decision to players such as Gerrard and Alonso on the bench: [...] "It was my idea to start with the players that had the most fitness and have played the most minutes. Then I wanted to bring the other players on towards the end. It worked <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>showed</b> that we have a great squad – better than last season." [...] Crouch, scorer of the winning goal, was also confident the result would boost the Liverpool squad: [...] "There is a bit of rivalry between the sides and it is great to get an early one over them.
