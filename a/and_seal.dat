5|$|Rochell's early Grapico {{efforts were}} not without problems. For example, in November 1921, Grapico Bottling Works {{acquired}} a US$648 Baltimore Semi-Automatic Machine, Model B-1485 from New Orleans based Crown Cork <b>and</b> <b>Seal</b> Co. to cork <b>and</b> <b>seal</b> soda water bottles. Within three months, the bottle capper began to fail. Frequently, {{the neck of}} the moving bottles became stuck in the machine, which additionally broke bottles whose contents drenched workers. In addition, the caps made by the machine did not seal properly so that carbonation gas escaped from the Grapico bottles. After Grapico refused to pay the US$358 balance, the Sheriff seized the bottling machine from Grapico. The matter was resolved 3½ years later by the Louisiana First Circuit Court of Appeal, who set aside the machine sales contract so that Grapico Bottling Works no longer owed the balance.|$|E

5|$|Auxois {{horses are}} usually bay or bay roan in color, {{although}} {{they can also}} be chestnut or red roan, similar to the Ardennais. gray <b>and</b> <b>seal</b> brown (the latter called black pangaré by the breed registry, although these horses are genetically brown, not black with pangaré markings) are also accepted for registration; all other colors are excluded. The Auxois is known for its power and docility, having a calm and gentle temperament. Like the Ardennais, it is an easy keeper, able to survive outdoors in all seasons, even in the harsh climatic conditions sometimes seen in Morvan and Nievre.|$|E
5|$|By {{making use}} of a new power {{obtained}} by Eren {{that allows him to}} create massive and permanent structures, the Survey Corps hold another expedition, this time managing to reach Shiganshina <b>and</b> <b>seal</b> the breach to reclaim Wall Maria. However, they are ambushed by Zeke, the man behind the Titan invasions and the spies, leading an army of Titans including the Colossal Titan against them. The battle ends with Zeke retreating, and the Colossal Titan defeated and killed by Armin, who became a Titan Shifter like Eren, but at the cost of the lives of almost {{all the members of the}} expedition, including the commander of the Survey Corps, Erwin Smith.|$|E
5|$|Colors {{accepted}} by the breed registry include chestnut, bay <b>and</b> <b>seal</b> brown (the latter called black pangaré by the breed registry, although these horses are genetically brown, not black with pangaré markings). Bays with white markings are the most popular. Norman Cobs are known as calm, willing horses with strong personalities. The breed's Thoroughbred ancestry gives them energy and athleticism, and makes them mature faster than other draft breeds. They show great endurance when ridden, and are relatively hardy, accepting outdoor living and changes in climate. Traditionally the Norman Cob had its tail docked, a practice that continued until January 1996, when the practice became illegal in France.|$|E

5|$|In {{the course}} of the few centuries up until the current version of 1957, the coat of arms has {{undergone}} some distinctly visible changes. While some 15th-century portrayals already show a child figure instead of the monk, the monk in representations onwards began to lose its serious disposition, with curly hair and a more youthful-looking face. By the 18th century and especially the 19th century, the monk had been minimised into the Münchner Kindl, Bavarian for Munich Child, a reference to the figure first documented in 1727, although it is not clear when it appeared on the coat of arms for the first time or who coined the term. The transformation was brought about by artists such as sculptors and painters as well as copper <b>and</b> <b>seal</b> engravers, as opposed to a legal order.|$|E
5|$|Members of the red-breasted {{nuthatch}} superspecies excavate their own tree holes, although most other nuthatches use natural holes or old woodpecker nests. Several species {{reduce the size}} of the entrance hole <b>and</b> <b>seal</b> up cracks with mud. The {{red-breasted nuthatch}} makes the nest secure by daubing sticky conifer resin globules around the entrance, the male applying the resin outside and the female inside. The resin may deter predators or competitors (the resident birds avoid the resin by diving straight through the entrance hole). The white-breasted nuthatch smears blister beetles around the entrance to its nest, and {{it has been suggested that}} the unpleasant smell from the crushed insects deters squirrels, its chief competitor for natural tree cavities.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the largest}} groups of {{surviving}} works of art are the seal matrices that appear to have entered Scottish usage with feudalism in the reign of David I, beginning at the royal court and among his Anglo-Norman vassals and then by about 1250 they began to spread to the Gaelicised areas of the country. They would be made compulsory for barons of the king in a statute of 1401 <b>and</b> <b>seal</b> matrices show very high standards of skill and artistry. Examples of items that were probably the work of continental artists include the delicate hanging lamp in St. John's Kirk in Perth, the vestments and hangings in Holyrood and the Medieval maces of the Universities of St Andrews and Glasgow.|$|E

5|$|Remains {{from this}} era {{used to cover}} most of the site, and it is {{believed}} the Norse inhabited the site continuously from the ninth to the 14th centuries. Excavations in the 1930s by Alex Curle found the first confirmed Norse longhouse in the British Isles and later digs in the 1950s found evidence of fishing and farming activities. Sheep, cattle, pigs and ponies were kept, Atlantic cod, saithe and ling were eaten, and whale <b>and</b> <b>seal</b> bones have also been found along with {{the remains of a}} single dog. Chicken bones are rare in the Norse levels.|$|E
5|$|The Norman Cob or Cob Normand is a {{breed of}} light draft horse that {{originated}} {{in the province of}} Normandy in northern France. It is a mid-sized horse, with a range of heights and weights, due to selective breeding {{for a wide range of}} uses. Its conformation is similar to a robust Thoroughbred, and it more closely resembles a Thoroughbred cross than other French draft breeds. The breed is known for its lively, long-striding trot. Colors accepted by the breed registry include chestnut, bay <b>and</b> <b>seal</b> brown. There are three general subsets within the breed: horses used under saddle, those used in harness, and those destined for meat production. They are popular for recreational and competitive driving, representing France internationally in the latter, and are also used for several riding disciplines.|$|E
5|$|This {{theory is}} debatable; Hermann Alexander Schlögl, Wolfgang Helck, Peter Kaplony and Jochem Kahl {{argue that the}} clay seals were only found at the {{entrance}} area of Peribsen's tomb {{and none of them}} depict Peribsen and Sekhemib's names together in one inscription. Furthermore, they remark that it was customary for a pharaoh to bury <b>and</b> <b>seal</b> his predecessor's tomb; the presence of Sekhemib's seals show the line of dynastic inheritance. Similar inferences can be drawn from the ivory tablets of king Hotepsekhemwy found at the entrance of king Qa'a's tomb and the clay seals of Djoser found at the entrance of Khasekhemwy's tomb. Schlögl, Helck, Kaplony and Kahl are convinced that the discovery of Sekhemib's seals support the view that Sekhemib immediately succeeded Peribsen and buried him.|$|E

5|$|A {{tall and}} lean swimmer {{known for her}} elegant technique, Leech started {{swimming}} as a child to build strength {{after a series of}} stomach disorders in her infancy. She quickly rose to prominence after breaking a string of age group records. In 1955, she became the youngest swimmer to win an Australian title, claiming victory in the 110-yard freestyle at the age of 13. She twice broke the Australian record in the 100-yard freestyle in late 1955, thereby positioning herself as a leading contender for Olympic selection in 1956. Leech's preparation was hindered by illness, which forced her out of the 1956 Australian Championships, but she recovered to gain Olympic selection in both the 100-metre freestyle and the corresponding relay. Leech produced a late surge to take bronze in the individual event <b>and</b> <b>seal</b> an Australian trifecta, before swimming the second leg in the relay to help secure an Australian victory in world record time. Leech retired after the Olympics at the age of 15; she cited anxiety caused by racing as one of the main factors in her decision.|$|E

5|$|Although he {{had only}} scored 41 runs in four innings between Tests, Harvey was {{retained}} for the Fifth and final Test at The Oval. England elected to bat on a rain-affected pitch. Precipitation in the week {{leading up to the}} match had delayed the start, and Yardley’s decision to bat was regarded as a surprise, as the weather suggested that bowlers would enjoy the conditions. This proved to be correct as Australia cut England down for 52 on the first day, with Lindwall (6/20) in particular managing to make the ball bounce at variable heights. Australia had already passed England by the close of play, reaching 2/153. The next day, Harvey came to the crease at 4/243 and quickly displayed the exuberance of youth. He hit Jack Young for a straight-driven four and then pulled him for another. Harvey then succumbed to Eric Hollies for 17, hitting a catch to Young, leaving Australia at 5/265. The Warwickshire spinner noticed this, and delivered a topspinner that dipped more than usual, and the batsman mistimed his off-drive, which went in the air towards mid-off. Australia finished at 389 and then bowled England out for 188 to complete victory by an innings and 149 runs <b>and</b> <b>seal</b> the series 4–0.|$|E
5|$|First {{appearing}} in The King of Fighters '95, Iori enters the annual tournament {{as the leader}} of the Rival Team along with Billy Kane and Eiji Kisaragi) as he learns that the heir of the Kusanagi clan, Kyo, is expected to be there. However, the team fails to defeat Kyo's team and Iori betrays his teammates. In the next video game, Iori teams up with two women, Vice and Mature, servants of the Orochi demon. The same team would be repeated in KOF '98, KOF 2002, and Neowave, games which do not feature a storyline. During the '96 competition, Iori meets Chizuru Kagura, heir of the Yata clan, who wants to gather Kyo and Iori on her team to seal Orochi. Together they defeat the Orochi follower Goenitz but neither Iori nor Kyo agree with the idea. When Iori leaves with his teammates, he is unable to control this surge of Orochi power, resulting in their deaths. Iori continued to suffer from multiple outbreaks and during The King of Fighters '97, attacks other team members. As such, Iori appears as a sub-boss character in the game depending on the characters that the player uses. He later joins Chizuru and Kyo to confront <b>and</b> <b>seal</b> Orochi.|$|E
5|$|From {{the end of}} {{the sixteenth}} century through the eighteenth century, a period known as Reformed orthodoxy, Reformed baptismal {{theology}} further developed the covenantal meaning of baptism. Theologians more carefully defined the sacramental union of baptism, or the relationship between the outward washing with that which it signifies. In the high orthodox period (middle to late seventeenth century), theologians such as Hermann Witsius expanded the covenantal meaning of baptism using analogies such as Noah's Ark and the crossing of the Red Sea, which carried the theological themes of the resurrection and eternal life. This period also saw the emergence of Reformed Baptists. Reformed Baptist theologians had much in common with the Reformed, but saw baptism {{as a sign of the}} baptized's fellowship with Christ rather than a sign <b>and</b> <b>seal</b> of the covenant of grace, and as a result did not baptize their children.|$|E
