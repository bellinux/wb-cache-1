5|$|A Roman Catholic, Dacey was {{influenced}} in his political opinions by protectionism and the rerum novarum, which supported people's {{right to join}} trade unions. He combined these beliefs with his experience with the Wool and Basil Workers Union <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Labor</b> platform. He was an anti-billite, meaning that he was against Federation, and spoke against it, for example at Coraki, New South Wales on 15 June 1899, based on his opposition to free trade.|$|E
5|$|At the May 1925 election, Bruxner {{retained}} {{his seat}} {{with an increased}} margin of 41%, while the Nationalist/Progressive Government lost office to Jack Lang <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Labor</b> Party. After the election, the Progressive party renamed themselves the Country Party, reflecting the electoral base of the party. Bruxner resigned the leadership {{at the end of}} 1925, citing the difficulty in balancing the needs of his family with the commitments of his political career, and was succeeded by Ernest Buttenshaw.|$|E
5|$|The Finnish labor movement, {{which emerged}} {{at the end}} of the 19th century from temperance, {{religious}} movements and Fennomania, had a Finnish nationalist, working-class character. From 1899–1906 the movement became conclusively independent, shedding the patronizing thinking of the Fennoman estates, and it was represented by the Finnish Social Democratic Party, established in 1899. Workers' activism directed both toward opposing Russification and in developing a domestic policy that tackled social problems and responded to the demand for democracy. This was a reaction to the domestic dispute, ongoing since the 1880s, between the Finnish nobility-burghers <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>labor</b> movement concerning voting rights for the common people.|$|E

5|$|The Underground State {{represented}} most, {{though not}} all, political factions of the Second Polish Republic. The Political Consultative Committee (PKP) represented four major Polish parties: the Socialist Party (PPS-WRN), the People's Party (SL), the SN, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Labor</b> Party (SP). The SP joined the PKP in June 1940, {{four months after}} the PKP was created; and the PPS-WRN withdrew from the PKP between October 1941 and March 1943. Those parties, known as the Big Four, were also represented in the Home Political Representation (KRP). Compared to PKP and KRP, the Council of National Unity was much more representative, and included representatives of several smaller political groupings. Several other groups lacked significant representation in PKP and KRP, but nonetheless had supported the Underground State. Non-Polish ethnic minorities, primarily the Ukrainians and the Belarusians, were not represented in the Underground State; however the Jews were.|$|E
5|$|Gradually, the low {{frequency}} active RC filter was supplanted by the switched-capacitor filter that operated in the discrete time domain {{rather than the}} continuous time domain. All of these filter technologies require precision components for high performance filtering, and that often requires that the filters be tuned. Adjustable components are expensive, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>labor</b> to do the tuning can be significant. Tuning the poles and zeros of a 7th-order elliptic filter {{is not a simple}} exercise. Integrated circuits have made digital computation inexpensive, so now {{low frequency}} filtering is done with digital signal processors. Such digital filters have no problem implementing ultra-precise (and stable) values, so no tuning or adjustment is required. Digital filters also don't have to worry about stray coupling paths and shielding the individual filter sections from one another. One downside is the digital signal processing may consume much more power than an equivalent LC filter. Inexpensive digital technology has largely supplanted analogue implementations of filters. However, there is still an occasional place for them in the simpler applications such as coupling where sophisticated functions of frequency are not needed.|$|E
5|$|Labor {{conducted}} an extensive campaign in marginal LCL {{seats at the}} 1965 election, resulting in 21 of 39 seats, with Frank Walsh <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Labor</b> Party taking power. As Deputy Premier and Attorney-General, the youthful and charismatic Dunstan made his older peers look lethargic as television became increasingly ubiquitous. The LCL opposition changed leaders and installed the young Steele Hall, worrying Labor as the elderly Walsh appeared bumbling in contrast. This resulted in Labor replacing Walsh with Dunstan. Despite maintaining a much larger vote over the LCL, Labor lost two seats at the 1968 election, with the LCL forming government with support of an independent. Dunstan responded by increasing his attacks on the Playmander {{and was able to}} convincingly sustain Playmander attacks with the effect of convincing the LCL into watering down the malapportionment. Again with little change in Labor's vote but with the Playmander removed, Labor won 27 of 47 seats at the 1970 election. With a fairer seat and boundary system in place, Dunstan won three more elections, in 1973, 1975 and 1977.|$|E

5|$|The Trans-Alaska Pipeline System {{was built}} entirely with unionized labor. Because {{construction}} was slumping in the United States at large, the pipeline drew workers {{from across the}} country. These workers had to follow a strict hiring process based on union seniority <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>labor</b> that was needed. Priority was given to hiring Alaska residents and Alaska Natives, and no strikes were permitted by a labor agreement between Alyeska and the unions. In exchange for abiding by these restrictions, workers were paid extremely well and received fringe benefits. According to the labor contract, every worker was guaranteed 40 hours' pay per week, even if weather made work impossible. In addition, subcontractors had cost-plus contracts with Alyeska for staffing, {{so there was no}} incentive to keep staffing levels low. These factors often led to more people being assigned to a job than there was work to do in an attempt to make up time lost to weather delays. At the peak of construction in fall 1975, more than 28,000 people were working on the pipeline. Fourteen to 19 percent of the workers were minorities, and 5 to 10 percent were women. Because of the high turnover on the project, more than 70,000 people worked on at least a part of the pipeline.|$|E
5|$|When Labor Council Secretary Robert King {{organised}} {{a conference}} of dissident left-wing unions on 1 August 1936, which was attended by Heffron and three other caucus members, Lang summoned a special party conference on 22 August which expelled Heffron, King {{and all the other}} leaders who attended the conference. As a result, Heffron, along with his colleague Carlo Lazzarini and others, formed the Industrial Labor Party (ILP), which was also known as the 'Heffron Labor Party'. Despite their expulsion, Heffron and the new ILP did increasingly well against Lang <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Labor</b> Party, winning two subsequent by-elections in the seats of Hurstville (won by Clive Evatt) and Waverley (won by Clarrie Martin). In June 1939, three other MPs, Frank Burke (Newtown), Mat Davidson (Cobar) and Ted Horsington (Sturt), unhappy with Lang's leadership joined the ILP. As a result of its success, John Curtin and the federal executive of the ALP pressured the NSW ALP to readmit Heffron and his party at a unity conference at the Majestic Theatre in Newtown on 26 August 1939. Heffron then combined forces with William McKell to depose Lang on 5 September 1939, with McKell becoming the new leader of the party, although he declined to stand for the position of deputy leader.|$|E
