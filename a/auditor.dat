40|$|We {{predict that}} the {{provision}} of non-audit services by <b>auditors</b> to their audit clients will impair independence more severely for smaller <b>auditors</b> than for large <b>auditors.</b> We report evidence that client earnings management activity to avoid losses and earnings decreases is positively associated with the ratio of non-audit fees to total fees for non-Big 5 <b>auditors</b> but not for Big 5 <b>auditors.</b> Earnings management to meet analysts' forecasts varies positively with the non-audit fee ratio for both Big 5 and non-Big 5 <b>auditors.</b> Further, {{the difference in the}} effectiveness of Big 5 and non-Big 5 <b>auditors</b> in constraining earnings management widens as the non-audit free ratio increases. These results suggest that, when the provision of non-audit services is relatively high, smaller <b>auditors</b> are less able to resist aggressive accounting by their clients...|$|R
40|$|Our {{focus in}} this study is to {{determine}} the expectation gap in <b>auditor’s</b> responsibility between <b>auditors</b> and bankers in Iran. In the view of fact, the key factor in enhanced credibility is the perception of stakeholders that the external <b>auditors</b> judge to financial statements providing through the management. In recent years corporate scandals were happened, so third parties demand <b>auditors</b> should be as an honest judge. Third parties expect the <b>auditors</b> should have more responsibility to detect fraud. The <b>auditors</b> although they view their role as bringing credibility to financial statements, know because of scope want limitation of their responsibility cannot detect all kinds of fraud. Therefore there is so called gap. Our findings indicate that there is significant gap between <b>auditors</b> and bankers in areas of <b>auditor’s</b> responsibilities to detection fraud and illegal acts. In this study, the authors came to conclusion that the bankers have reasonableness expectation gap from <b>auditors...</b>|$|R
5|$|A city {{councilor}} {{from each}} of the city's nine council districts is elected every two years, each serving a term of two years. Councilors are elected from their own respective districts based on a plurality voting system, and serve on the Tulsa City Council.

In accordance with the mayor-council form of government, the Tulsa City Council and the office of the Mayor coordinate in city government operations. A third body of the government, the city <b>auditor,</b> is elected independently of the city council and mayor to ensure that the <b>auditor</b> can act in an objective manner.

40|$|In the Netherlands <b>auditors</b> can {{be trained}} in a {{part-time}} educational track in which students combine working and studying or in a full-time educational track. The former training is relatively firm-specific whereas the latter training is relatively general.

40|$|In this paper, we {{investigate}} whether, and how, audit effectiveness differentiation between Big 6 and non-Big 6 <b>auditors</b> {{is influenced by}} a conflict or convergence of reporting incentives faced by corporate managers and external <b>auditors.</b> In so doing, we incorporate into our analysis the possibility that managers self-select both external <b>auditors</b> and discretionary accruals, using the two stage "treatment effects" model. Our results show that only when managers have incentives to prefer income-increasing accrual choices are Big 6 <b>auditors</b> more effective than non-Big 6 <b>auditors</b> in deterring/monitoring opportunistic earnings management. Contrary to conventional wisdom, we find Big 6 <b>auditors</b> are less effective than non-Big 6 <b>auditors</b> when both managers and <b>auditors</b> have incentives to prefer income-decreasing accrual choices and thus no conflict of reporting incentives exists between the two parties. The above findings are robust to different proxies for opportunistic earnings management and different proxies for the direction of earnings management incentives.

40|$|U. S. and {{international}} auditing standard setters continue {{to raise questions}} about standard auditors' reports and are exploring alternatives to those reports. Government agencies and professional organizations are also raising questions about the <b>auditor's</b> report. These questions point to a continued existence of an “audit expectation gap. ” To investigate perceptions and misperceptions regarding the <b>auditor's</b> report, we conducted focus groups with five different stakeholder groups—financial statement preparers (CFOs), users (bankers, analysts, and non-professional investors), and external <b>auditors.</b> This approach allows detailed comparisons between {{the perceptions of the}} different stakeholder groups affected by the <b>auditor's</b> report. Findings include that financial statement users value the audit, but do not read the entire <b>auditor's</b> report. It is not clear to users, preparers, and <b>auditors</b> what the <b>auditor's</b> report is intended to communicate or the level of assurance being provided by the report. Stakeholders offered numerous suggestions to improve the <b>auditor's</b> report, but they also recognize those suggestions could significantly change the <b>auditor's</b> risk profile and increase audit fees. We suggest future research to determine if potential changes to the <b>auditor's</b> report would change users' behavior and if any resulting benefits outweigh the additional risks and costs. Glen L.
