25|$|One {{reason for}} having a special {{constitutional}} <b>amendment</b> <b>procedure</b> is because constitutional supremacy requires the Constitution to endure {{in the long term}} with its main principles largely unchanged. However, in Singapore, this concept has been undermined by numerous major constitutional amendments made after 1979.

2500|$|O'Connor, {{writing for}} a four-justice plurality, held {{that due to}} the dispute the Connick test should have been applied to what the {{supervisor}} reasonably believed Churchill had said, rather than what a trier of fact might find.

2500|$|The Supreme Court of Canada was {{mentioned}} {{for the first}} time in a constitutional document by the Constitution Act, 1982. The Supreme Court is referred to twice. [...] First, s. 41 lists several amendments to the Constitution of Canada requiring unanimous consent. S. 41(d) includes the [...] "composition of the Supreme Court of Canada" [...] in this list. [...] Second, s. 42(1) lists several amendments to the Constitution of Canada requiring the general <b>amendment</b> <b>procedure.</b> S. 42(1)(d) includes [...] "subject to s. 41(d), the Supreme Court of Canada" [...] in this list. Sections 41 and 42 of the Constitution Act, 1982, thus appear to include the Supreme Court of Canada in the Constitution of Canada. [...] However, this conclusion is questionable because the [...] "Constitution of Canada" [...] is expressly defined in s. 52(2) as a set of thirty instruments that does not include the Supreme Court Act. Some scholars, including Peter Hogg, have suggested that the references to the Supreme Court of Canada in sections 41 and 42 are ineffective. [...] They argue that these references are [...] "anticipatory" [...] and will become effective only if Parliament adds the Supreme Court Act to the list in s. 52(2). Other scholars, including Professor Cheffins, have argued that the Supreme Court Act is implied as entrenched into s. 52(2) because of sections 41 and 42. [...] S. 52(2) uses the words [...] "includes ..." [...] to introduce the list of thirty instruments, suggesting that the provision does not contain an exhaustive list. The Supreme Court itself has confirmed in New Brunswick Broadcasting Co. v. Nova Scotia (Speaker of the House of Assembly), [...] 1 S.C.R. 319 that s. 52(2) is not exhaustive, but has not yet ruled on whether the Supreme Court Act is included in the Constitution of Canada.|$|E
