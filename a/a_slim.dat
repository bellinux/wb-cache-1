5|$|Draco Malfoy is <b>a</b> <b>slim,</b> pale boy {{who speaks}} in a bored drawl. He is arrogant about his skill in Quidditch, and despises anyone {{who is not a}} pure-blood wizard– and wizards who do not share his views. His parents had {{supported}} Voldemort, but changed sides after the dark wizard's disappearance, claiming they had been bewitched. Draco avoids direct confrontations, and tries to get Harry and his friends into trouble.|$|E

He {{was endorsed by}} former Senate President Jovito Salonga and supported by former Pasig mayor Vicente Eusebio but lost to Robert Jaworski Jr., who won by <b>a</b> <b>slim</b> margin. Romulo ran again for the House seat during 2007 election and won.|$|E

5|$|The basidia are 15–25×3.5–5.5µm {{and have}} <b>a</b> <b>slim,</b> club-like shape. Each {{basidium}} features four sterigmata, {{each of which}} bear one spore. The spores' shape is slimly ellipsoidal or cylindrical. Their surface is smooth and their walls are thin. Although they are colourless and hyaline, the spores are amyloid, meaning they will turn bluish or purple when stained with Melzer's reagent. This characteristic differs from other very similar species, and this gave the genus its name.|$|E
5|$|The soft coat is reddish to golden brown, {{in sharp}} {{contrast}} with the white ventral parts. A brown band runs across the chest, and a distinct rufous collar can be observed on the neck. The chin and the medial surfaces of the legs are also white. The face is characterised by large, round dark brown eyes, small translucent ears, <b>a</b> <b>slim</b> muzzle, and a large grayish pink rhinarium.|$|E
5|$|While {{critical}} of the strike, the public did not necessarily support the cause of equal employment opportunities for black workers. A public opinion poll conducted in Philadelphia during the strike showed that only <b>a</b> <b>slim</b> majority of the city's population felt that blacks should be hired as motormen and conductors, but that a significant majority opposed having a strike over this issue.|$|E

5|$|For several years, {{between the}} March 1841 arson and 1848, court convened in various private residences. Without a {{courthouse}} in Oregon, the county seat, proposals {{to move the}} county seat began to circulate. Ogle County communities, Byron, Mount Morris, Grand Detour and Daysville were all in contention for the designation, and, ultimately, the new courthouse. At the deciding meeting the representatives from Daysville removed their town from the running and sided with Oregon. The withdrawal of Daysville gave Oregon <b>a</b> <b>slim</b> majority of votes and it retained its status as county seat of Ogle County.|$|E
5|$|Groundbreaking on the {{dam site}} {{occurred}} in May 1957 with {{the relocation of}} the Western Pacific Railroad tracks that ran through the Feather River canyon. The Burns-Porter Act of the California Legislature, which authorized the SWP, was not passed until November 8, 1960 – and only by <b>a</b> <b>slim</b> margin. Engineer Donald Thayer of the DWR was commissioned to design and head construction of Oroville Dam, and the primary work contract was awarded to Oro Dam Constructors Inc., a joint venture led by Oman Construction Co.|$|E
5|$|Irish legislators {{began to}} comment {{publicly}} from 2003, some tentatively suggesting legislation, and some referring to Catholic teachings. Among the general public, reaction was favourable, with a 2005 online poll showing most respondents seeing some recognition as inevitable and acceptable. More rigorous public polls taken during 2006 showed an increasing {{majority of the}} population, up to 80%, supporting the introduction of some partnership rights for same-sex couples, with <b>a</b> <b>slim</b> majority favouring full marriage. The numbers in favour of adoption by same-sex couples were lower but less clear.|$|E

5|$|On July 1, Young was {{nominated}} {{as a candidate}} for the All-Star Final Vote, contending against Tom Gorzelanny, Roy Oswalt, Brandon Webb and Carlos Zambrano. In a bid for the final spot on July 4, Young posted seven scoreless innings in a 1–0 victory over the Florida Marlins to not only retake the National League ERA lead, but also assume the major league lead over Brad Penny by <b>a</b> <b>slim</b> margin (1.9968 to 1.9970). The voting ended on July 5, with Young defeating the four opposing pitchers to earn his first career All-Star Game selection. The selection made Young the sixth Ivy League athlete named to the All-Star team (joining Lou Gehrig, Red Rolfe, Ron Darling, Brad Ausmus and Mike Remlinger).|$|E
5|$|Somerset {{progressed to}} {{the second round of}} the {{competition}} after Trinidad and Tobago beat Deccan in the final group match, but lost Trescothick, who flew home after a recurrence of his illness. Wes Durston, who replaced Trescothick in the side, top-scored for Somerset in their next match, making 57. Only two other players reached double-figures for the county, and the Diamond Eagles chased down the total with eight balls to spare. Somerset went into their final match, against the New South Wales Blues with <b>a</b> <b>slim</b> mathematical chance of progressing, but a strong bowling display from Brett Lee and Stuart Clark restricted Somerset to 111, which the Australian side reached with ease.|$|E
5|$|In each {{of their}} {{following}} two matches, at home against Hampshire and away to Worcestershire, Somerset batted first and then enforced the follow-on after bowling their opponents out cheaply. In each their opponents managed to avoid defeat, and both matches resulted in draws. During the Worcestershire match, Langer's first innings 107 took him past Sir Donald Bradman's total of 28,067 first-class runs to become the highest-scoring Australian batsman. Successive draws against Nottinghamshire, Warwickshire, Sussex and Hampshire meant that Somerset travelled to Durham requiring a victory to maintain any realistic hopes of claiming the County Championship title. No play was possible on {{the third and fourth}} days, and the match resulted in another draw, leaving Somerset with only <b>a</b> <b>slim</b> mathematical chance of the title. Another draw, against Lancashire, while Durham beat Nottinghamshire, meant that Durham clinched the title. Somerset drew with Worcestershire (their ninth draw in a row in the competition), and finished third in the first division.|$|E

5|$|On September 22, Bonds tied Henry Aaron's National League career {{home run}} record of 733. The home run {{came in the}} top of the 6th inning of a high-scoring game against the Milwaukee Brewers, at Miller Park in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. The {{achievement}} was notable for its occurrence in the very city where Aaron began (with the Milwaukee Braves) and concluded (with the Brewers, then in the American League) his career. With the Giants trailing 10–8, Bonds hit a blast to deep center field on a 2–0 pitch off the Brewers' Chris Spurling with runners on first and second and one out. Though the Giants were at the time clinging to only <b>a</b> <b>slim</b> chance of making the playoffs, Bonds's home run provided the additional drama of giving the Giants an 11–10 lead late in a critical game in the final days of a pennant race. The Brewers eventually won the game, 13–12, though Bonds went 3 for 5, with 2 doubles, the record-tying home run, and 6 runs batted in.|$|E
5|$|Ralph Klein, {{the former}} mayor of Calgary, led the party into the 1993 election, {{promising}} a new era of debt reduction and fiscal accountability. He walked away with <b>a</b> <b>slim</b> majority. Ralph Klein's folksy appeal helped the Progressive Conservatives renew themselves. He led the party through two elections, gaining in popularity each time. The price of oil rebounded and the government, despite low rates of taxes on the wealthy and corporations, was showing a surplus of $3 billion every year. In early 2004, Klein announced that the Alberta debt had been paid in full. He was rewarded by voters in the 2004 election, despite running a campaign with no new policies. His party lost a number of seats, and during the campaign he stated this would be his last election. In 2006 at a Progressive Conservative convention delegates forced him to pick a retirement date by giving him relatively low numbers in a leadership review.|$|E
5|$|Sayers {{was educated}} {{at home and}} then at the University of Oxford. This was unusual for a woman at the time, as they were not {{admitted}} as full members of the university until 1920 – five years after Sayers had completed her first class degree in medieval French. In 1916, a year after her graduation, Sayer published her first book, a collection of poems entitled Op. I, which she followed two years later with a second, <b>a</b> <b>slim</b> volume titled Catholic Tales and Christian Songs. The same year she was invited to edit and contribute to the annual editions of Oxford Poetry, which she did for the next three years. In 1923 she published Whose Body?, a murder mystery novel featuring the fictional Lord Peter Wimsey, and went on to write eleven novels and five collections of short stories about the character. The Wimsey stories were popular, and successful enough for Sayers to leave the advertising agency where she was working.|$|E

5|$|South of Ardnamurchan, Gaelic {{place names}} are more common, {{and after the}} 13th century, Gaelic became the main {{language}} of the entire Hebridean archipelago. Due to Scots and English being favored in government and the educational system, the Hebrides {{have been in a}} state of diglossia since at least the seventeenth century. The Highland Clearances of the nineteenth century accelerated the language shift away from Scottish Gaelic, as did increased migration and the continuing lower status of Gaelic speakers. Nevertheless, as late {{as the end of the}} nineteenth century, there were significant populations of monolingual Gaelic speakers, and the Hebrides still contain the highest percentages of Gaelic speakers in Scotland. This is especially true of the Outer Hebrides, where <b>a</b> <b>slim</b> majority speak the language. The Scottish Gaelic college, Sabhal Mòr Ostaig, is based on Skye and Islay.|$|E
5|$|The act {{has also}} faced {{challenges}} and opposition. In 2009, Senator Ted Kennedy died, {{and the resultant}} special election cost the Democrats their 60-seat filibuster-proof Senate majority before the ACA had been fully passed by Congress. The Supreme Court ruled 5 to 4 in 2012 that states could choose {{not to participate in}} the ACA's Medicaid expansion, although it upheld the law as a whole. The federal health exchange, HealthCare.gov, initially faced major technical problems during its rollout in 2013. In 2017, a unified Republican government failed to pass several different partial repeals of the ACA. The law spent several years opposed by <b>a</b> <b>slim</b> plurality of Americans polled, although its provisions were generally more popular than the law as a whole, and the law gained plurality support by 2017.|$|E
5|$|For {{representation}} in Parliament Dorset {{is divided into}} eight Parliamentary constituencies—five county constituencies and three borough constituencies. At the 2017 general election, the Conservative Party was dominant, taking all eight seats. The borough constituencies of Bournemouth East, Bournemouth West and Poole are traditionally Conservative safe seats and are all represented by Conservative members of parliament. The county constituencies of North Dorset and Christchurch are also represented by Conservative MPs. West Dorset is represented by Conservative MP Oliver Letwin who was the Minister of State at the Cabinet Office in David Cameron's government. The marginal seat of South Dorset is represented by Richard Drax, who gained the seat from Labour representative, Jim Knight, in 2010. Drax retained the seat in 2015 and 2017. Mid Dorset and North Poole has been held by Liberal Democrat MP Annette Brooke who retained her seat in 2010 with <b>a</b> <b>slim</b> majority of 269 (0.6% of the vote) over the Conservative candidate. Since 2015 the constituency has been represented by the Conservative MP, Michael Tomlinson. For the European Parliament the county lies within the South West England constituency which elected two Conservative, two UKIP, one Labour and one Green Party Members of the European Parliament (MEPs) at the 2014 European Parliament election.|$|E
