5|$|Among {{the works}} created {{during the war}} was Yakov Knyazhnin's tragedy Olga (1772). The Russian playwright chose to {{introduce}} Sviatoslav as his protagonist, although his <b>active</b> <b>participation</b> <b>in</b> the events following Igor's death is {{out of sync with}} the traditional chronology. Knyazhnin's rival Nikolai Nikolev (1758–1815) also wrote a play on the subject of Sviatoslav's life. Ivan Akimov's painting Sviatoslav's Return from the Danube to Kiev (1773) explores the conflict between military honour and family attachment. It is a vivid example of Poussinesque rendering of early medieval subject matter.|$|E
5|$|French {{military}} planners had to balance competing demands for the 1781 campaign. After the unsuccessful American attempts of co-operation leading to failed assaults at Rhode Island and Savannah, they realised more <b>active</b> <b>participation</b> <b>in</b> North America was needed. However, they {{also needed to}} co-ordinate their actions with Spain, where there was potential interest in making {{an assault on the}} British stronghold of Jamaica. It turned out that the Spanish were not interested in operations agaynst Jamaica until after they had dealt with an expected British attempt to reinforce besieged Gibraltar, and merely wanted to be informed of the movements of the West Indies fleet.|$|E

In 2014, the federal government ceased to contribute funds to Indigenous health {{organizations such as the}} AHF and the National Aboriginal Health Organization. Since then, more pressure has been placed on churches to sustain their <b>active</b> <b>participation</b> <b>in</b> these healing efforts.|$|E

The {{purpose of this}} thesis {{is to determine the}} barriers to more <b>active</b> contractor <b>participation</b> <b>in</b> the DOD Value Engineering (VE) program. A review of professional literature such as DOD Inspector General, General Accounting Office, and other research reports provide the background information necessary to explain potential barriers to more <b>active</b> contractor <b>participation</b> <b>in</b> the DOD VEprogram. Thirty telephone surveys were conducted with Government and contractor personnel to solicit the opinions of these acquisition professionals concerning barriers to more <b>active</b> contractor <b>participation</b> <b>in</b> the DOD VE Program. The results and analysis of the interviews are reported. It was concluded that there are four significant barriers preventing more <b>active</b> contractor <b>participation</b> <b>in</b> the DOD VE program. The four significant barriers to more <b>active</b> contractor <b>participation</b> <b>in</b> the DOD VE program are insufficient funding, the VECP submission and approval process, a low level of VE awareness among acquisition professionals, and a lack of support for the VE program among top-level DOD management. Recommendations to improve contractor <b>participation</b> <b>in</b> VE are establishment of a centrally managed VE fund, streamlining the VECP process, increased VE awareness training, additional VE personnel resources, enforcement of VE savings goals, and greater top-level management support[URL] United States Nav...|$|R

Built in 1913, and owned by the Royal Zoological Society of Scotland, it receives over 600,000 visitors a year, which makes it Scotland's second most popular paid-for tourist attraction, after Edinburgh Castle.

5|$|In the Treaty of Labiau on 20 November, Charles X Gustav of Sweden granted Frederick William of Brandenburg full {{sovereignty}} in the Duchy of Prussia in turn {{for a more}} <b>active</b> <b>participation</b> <b>in</b> the war. In the Treaty of Radnot on 6 December, Charles X Gustav promised to accept George II Rákóczi of Transylvania as king of Poland and Grand Duke of Lithuania in return for his entrance into the war. Rákóczi entered the war in January 1657, crossing into the commonwealth with a force of 25,000 Transylvanian-Wallachian-Moldavian men and 20,000 Cossacks who broke the Polish siege of Kraków before they met with Charles X Gustav, who had led a Swedish-Brandenburgian army southwards. The following month saw the Swedish-Brandenburg-Transylvanian-Romanian-Cossack forces play cat and mouse with the Polish–Lithuanian forces, moving {{about all of the}} commonwealth without any major engagements, except the capture of Brest by Charles X Gustav in May, and the sack of Warsaw by Rákóczi and Gustaf Otto Stenbock on 17 June.|$|E

Between 20 and 23 October, Krasnyi Kavkaz, her half-sister , and three destroyers ferried 12,600 men of the 8th, 9th and 10th Guards Rifle Brigades from Poti to Tuapse to reinforce the defenses there. On the night of 4 February 1943 the Soviets {{made a series of}} amphibious landings to the west of Novorossiysk, behind German lines. Krasnyi Krym, Krasnyi Kavkaz, and three destroyers provided fire support for the main landing, but the Soviet troops there were wiped out by 6 February, although one secondary landing was successful. The loss of three destroyers attempting to interdict the German evacuation of the Taman Bridgehead on 6 October 1943 caused Stalin to forbid the deployment of large naval units without his express permission and this meant the end of Krasnyi Kavkazs <b>active</b> <b>participation</b> <b>in</b> the war.|$|E

5|$|Littorio was {{inactive}} for {{the first}} six months of 1943 due to severe fuel shortages in the Italian Navy. Only enough fuel was available for Littorio, Vittorio Veneto and their recently commissioned sister , but even then the fuel was only enough for emergencies. On 19 June 1943, an American bombing raid targeted the harbor at La Spezia and hit Littorio with three bombs. She was renamed Italia on 30 July after the government of Benito Mussolini fell from power. On 3 September, Italy signed an armistice with the Allies, ending her <b>active</b> <b>participation</b> <b>in</b> World War II. Six days later, Italia and the rest of the Italian fleet sailed for Malta, where they would be interned for the remainder of the war. While en route, the German Luftwaffe (Air Force) attacked the Italian fleet using Dornier Do 217s armed with Fritz X radio-controlled bombs. One Fritz X hit Italia just forward of turret no. 1; it passed through the ship and exited the hull, exploding in the water beneath and causing serious damage. Roma was meanwhile sunk in the attack.|$|E

5|$|Pound's {{editorial}} {{choices were}} {{based on what he}} saw as the degree of sympathy that these writers displayed with Imagist precepts, rather than <b>active</b> <b>participation</b> <b>in</b> a group as such. Williams, who was based in the United States, had not participated in any of the discussions of the Eiffel Tower group. However, he and Pound had long been corresponding {{on the question of the}} renewal of poetry along similar lines. Ford was included at least partly because of his strong influence on Pound, as the younger poet made the transition from his earlier, Pre-Raphaelite-influenced style towards a harder, more modern way of writing. The inclusion of a poem by Joyce, I Hear an Army, which was sent to Pound by W.B. Yeats, took on a wider importance in the history of literary modernism, as the subsequent correspondence between the two led to the serial publication, at Pound's behest, of A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man in The Egoist. Joyce's poem is not written in free verse, but in rhyming quatrains. However, it strongly reflects Pound's interest in poems written to be sung to music, such as those by the troubadours and Guido Cavalcanti. The book met with little popular or critical success, at least partly because it had no introduction or commentary to explain what the poets were attempting to do, and a number of copies were returned to the publisher.|$|E
