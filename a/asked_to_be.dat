5|$|After a {{long and}} zealously pious life, Cædmon died like a saint: {{receiving}} a premonition of death, he <b>asked</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> moved to the abbey's hospice for the terminally ill where, having gathered his friends around him, he died after receiving the Holy Eucharist, just before nocturns. Although he is often listed as a saint, this is not confirmed by Bede and it has recently been argued that such assertions are incorrect.|$|E

5|$|It is {{generally}} accepted by historians that, although Otto failed, he deeply loved Greece {{as his own}} new homeland.

5|$|The {{office of}} Prelate {{was held by}} the Lord Archbishop of Armagh, the most senior clergyman in the Church of Ireland.

An Austro-Hungarian Army officer before and during World War I, he {{specialised}} in mountain warfare and logistics, and had been promoted to Oberstleutnant (lieutenant colonel) {{by the end of}} the war. During the interwar period he joined the Romanian Army, reaching the rank of General-locotenent (major general), and also became an adviser to King Carol.

5|$|Baird and Jackie {{were asked}} to visit Lennon at Kenwood which was his home in Weybridge in 1964. Cynthia Lennon—Lennon's wife at the time—took them both out {{shopping}} in Knightsbridge, buying them expensive clothes. During the same visit, The Beatles played at the Finsbury Park Astoria, and the sisters <b>asked</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> allowed to stand near the front, but had to be {{pulled out of the}} audience by security guards because of the crush. In December 1965, Dykins was killed in a car crash at the bottom of Penny Lane. Lennon was not told about his death for months afterwards. Dykins had married again, but Baird acknowledges that she and Jackie had very little contact with his wife, and did not attend their father's funeral.|$|E
5|$|Breathitt enraged Chandler by {{charging}} that, when Chandler was a senator, he had {{voted in favor}} of declaring World War II, but soon after resigned his commission as a reserve army captain. According to Chandler's version of events, after he {{voted in favor of}} the war declaration, he called Secretary of War Henry Stimson and <b>asked</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> put on active duty. Chandler said Stimson told him he would rather have a senator than a captain, after which Chandler resigned his commission. Chandler's explanation did not stop Breathitt from repeating the charge often on the campaign trail.|$|E
5|$|By 1388, {{the devastation}} of Dalmatia by the Bosnian army had become so severe that the {{authorities}} of the cities pleaded with Sigismund to either help them or {{to allow them to}} save themselves by submitting without being labeled as traitors. Neither Sigismund's army nor an alliance of Dalmatian cities and noblemen were able to counter Tvrtko's advances. Split, Zadar, and Šibenik having lost all hope, Tvrtko called upon them to negotiate their surrender in March 1389. Each of the cities <b>asked</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> the last one to submit and even to be allowed to request Sigismund's assistance once more. Tvrtko granted their wish and decided that Split should be the last to submit, by 15 June 1389.|$|E

5|$|By December 1942 {{there were}} {{concerns}} that even Oak Ridge {{was too close}} to a major population center (Knoxville) in the unlikely event of a major nuclear accident. Groves recruited DuPont in November 1942 to be the prime contractor for the construction of the plutonium production complex. DuPont was offered a standard cost plus fixed-fee contract, but the President of the company, Walter S. Carpenter, Jr., wanted no profit of any kind, and asked for the proposed contract to be amended to explicitly exclude the company from acquiring any patent rights. This was accepted, but for legal reasons a nominal fee of one dollar was agreed upon. After the war, DuPont <b>asked</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> released from the contract early, and had to return 33 cents.|$|E
5|$|During this {{conflict}} and others during the 1880s, Carte and Helen Lenoir frequently worked to smooth over the partners' differences using {{a mixture of}} friendship and business acumen. Sullivan <b>asked</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> released from the partnership on several occasions. Nevertheless, Carte was able to coax eight comic operas out of his partners in the 1880s. When Princess Ida closed after a comparatively short run of nine months, {{for the first time}} in the partnership's history, the next opera was not ready. Gilbert first suggested a plot in which people fell in love against their wills after taking a magic lozenge – a scenario that Sullivan had previously rejected. Gilbert eventually came up with a new idea and began work in May 1884.|$|E
