My character does <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>talking!</b> I kind of thought of Frazier as Brutus goes to Brooklyn. For me, there is a certain rhythm and cadence of New Yorkers, and this gave me the opportunity to play a New York kind of guy who’s going through a lot while dealing with this smart and challenging adversary." ...|$|E
500|$|Rumble's hip hop group, Fast Crew, {{released}} {{their second}} studio album, Truth, Lies & Red Tape, in 2008. The band split soon afterwards, and Rumble {{decided to pursue}} a solo musical career, and taught himself to play the guitar. He began writing material for his album, but he found that {{he could no longer}} write hip hop. [...] "Hip hop was just wearing really thin for me because it's really quite macho. 'I'm wicked because of this. I'm the best because of that'. It's <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>talking</b> yourself up," [...] Rumble said. He began to write songs inspired by his own experiences and emotions, which allowed him to explore other musical genres. He explained that when he wrote songs for the album, he began by creating a chord progression using his guitar, which evolved into the tune's basic melody, after which he would determine its theme. Other songs were conceived by Rumble humming a tune during everyday activities, then recording it onto his iPhone so as to not forget it. The tune would later be refined to a full-fledged song. According to Rumble, writing music was the hardest component of the album's making. [...] "Always Be Here" [...] was the first song Rumble completed, which he sent to record label Warner Music NZ, thereby commencing his solo career.|$|E

The song opens with the lines [...] "Hit me" [...] and the first verses sung by Beyoncé follow: [...] "I put it right there made it easy for you to get to / Now you want to act like you don't know what to do". The chorus follows during which the group repeatedly sings the lines [...] "Can you keep up?". Rowland's second verses follow where she sings the lines [...] "Put it on me deep in the right direction". The chorus is repeated twice before the bridge by Williams. After the bridge, the group sings the lines [...] "Here's your papers, baby you are dismissed" [...] letting their man know that he is not good enough for them. Rowland sings a short ad lib, and then the trio ends with a repeated chorus. Nick Reynolds from BBC compared the song Missy Elliott's [...] "Pass That Dutch" [...] and to songs by The Supremes. He further found a name check of Public Enemy's [...] "Bring the Noise". Eric Henderson of Slant Magazine also compared [...] "Lose My Breath with [...] "Pass That Dutch".|$|E
