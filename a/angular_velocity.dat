5|$|Surface {{differential}} rotation is observed on {{stars such as}} the Sun when the <b>angular</b> <b>velocity</b> varies with latitude. Typically the <b>angular</b> <b>velocity</b> decreases with increasing latitude. However the reverse has also been observed, such as on the star designated HD31993.

5|$|After a {{star has}} {{finished}} generating energy through thermonuclear fusion, it evolves {{into a more}} compact, degenerate state. During this process {{the dimensions of the}} star are significantly reduced, which can result in a corresponding increase in <b>angular</b> <b>velocity.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{magnetic}} field {{of a star}} interacts with the stellar wind. As the wind {{moves away from the}} star its rate of <b>angular</b> <b>velocity</b> slows. The {{magnetic field}} of the star interacts with the wind, which applies a drag to the stellar rotation. As a result, angular momentum is transferred from the star to the wind, and over time this gradually slows the star's rate of rotation.|$|E

40|$|The {{invention}} is {{embodied in}} {{a method of}} integrating kinematics equations for updating a set of vehicle attitude angles of a vehicle using 3 -dimensional <b>angular</b> <b>velocities</b> of the vehicle, which includes computing an integrating factor matrix from quantities corresponding to the 3 -dimensional <b>angular</b> <b>velocities,</b> computing a total integrated angular rate from the quantities corresponding to a 3 -dimensional <b>angular</b> <b>velocities,</b> computing a state transition matrix as a sum of (a) a first complementary function of the total integrated angular rate and (b) the integrating factor matrix multiplied by a second complementary function of the total integrated angular rate, and updating the set of vehicle attitude angles using the state transition matrix. Preferably, the method further includes computing a quanternion vector from the quantities corresponding to the 3 -dimensional <b>angular</b> <b>velocities,</b> {{in which case the}} updating of the set of vehicle attitude angles using the state transition matrix is carried out by (a) updating the quanternion vector by multiplying the quanternion vector by the state transition matrix to produce an updated quanternion vector and (b) computing an updated set of vehicle attitude angles from the updated quanternion vector. The first and second trigonometric functions are complementary, such as a sine and a cosine. The quantities corresponding to the 3 -dimensional <b>angular</b> <b>velocities</b> include respective averages of the 3 -dimensional <b>angular</b> <b>velocities</b> over plural time frames.

5|$|The {{rotation}} {{of a star}} produces an equatorial bulge due to centrifugal force. As stars are not solid bodies, they can also undergo differential rotation. Thus the equator of the star can rotate at a different <b>angular</b> <b>velocity</b> than the higher latitudes. These differences {{in the rate of}} rotation within a star may have {{a significant role in the}} generation of a stellar magnetic field.|$|E
5|$|The {{underlying}} {{mechanism that}} causes differential rotation is turbulent convection inside a star. Convective motion carries energy {{toward the surface}} through the mass movement of plasma. This mass of plasma carries {{a portion of the}} <b>angular</b> <b>velocity</b> of the star. When turbulence occurs through shear and rotation, the angular momentum can become redistributed to different latitudes through meridional flow.|$|E
5|$|Jupiter's {{internal}} {{magnetic field}} {{is generated by}} electrical currents in the planet's outer core, which is composed of liquid metallic hydrogen. Volcanic eruptions on Jupiter's moon Io eject large amounts of sulfur dioxide gas into space, forming a large torus around the planet. Jupiter's magnetic field forces the torus to rotate with the same <b>angular</b> <b>velocity</b> and direction as the planet. The torus in turn loads the magnetic field with plasma, in the process stretching it into a pancake-like structure called a magnetodisk. In effect, Jupiter's magnetosphere is shaped by Io's plasma and its own rotation, {{rather than by the}} solar wind like Earth's magnetosphere. Strong currents in the magnetosphere generate permanent aurorae around the planet's poles and intense variable radio emissions, which means that Jupiter {{can be thought of as}} a very weak radio pulsar. Jupiter's aurorae have been observed in almost all parts of the electromagnetic spectrum, including infrared, visible, ultraviolet and soft X-rays.|$|E

25|$|Though {{it just a}} {{particular}} case of a moving particle, {{this is a very}} important one for its relationship with the rigid body study, and special tools have been developed for this case.

25|$|We have {{supposed}} that the rigid body rotates around an arbitrary point.

25|$|In two dimensions, the <b>angular</b> <b>velocity</b> is {{a single}} number with an {{orientation}} but no direction. The <b>angular</b> <b>velocity</b> in two dimensions is a pseudoscalar, a quantity that changes its sign under a parity inversion (for example {{if one of the}} axes is inverted or if axes are swapped). The positive direction of rotation is taken, by convention, to be in the direction towards the y axis from the x axis. If the parity is inverted, but the orientation of a rotation is not, then the sign of the <b>angular</b> <b>velocity</b> changes.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{addresses}} attitude synchronization {{problems for}} systems of multiple rigid-body agents with directed interconnection topologies.

By using rotation vectors and the high gain control, the authors provide torque control laws asymptotically synchronizing the rotations of the system almost globally for the first scenario and with initial rotations of the agents contained in a convex ball of SO(3) for the second scenario. An illustrative example is provided to show the synchronization results for both scenarios...|$|R

25|$|A radial motion {{produces}} {{no change}} {{in the direction of the}} particle relative to the origin, so, for the purpose of finding the <b>angular</b> <b>velocity,</b> the radial component can be ignored.

40|$|The micromechanical {{properties}} of spider air flow hair sensilla (trichobothria) were characterized with nanometre resolution using surface force spectroscopy (SFS) {{under conditions of}} different constant deflection <b>angular</b> <b>velocities</b> (rad s− 1) for hairs 900 – 950  μm long prior to shortening for measurement purposes. In the range of <b>angular</b> <b>velocities</b> examined (4 × 10 − 4 − 2. 6 × 10 − 1 rad s− 1), the torque T (Nm) resisting hair motion and its time rate of change (Nm s− 1) were found to vary with deflection velocity according to power functions. In this range of <b>angular</b> <b>velocities,</b> {{the motion of the}} hair is most accurately captured by a three-parameter solid model, which numerically describes the {{properties of}} the hair suspension. A fit of the three-parameter model (3 p) to the experimental data yielded the two torsional restoring parameters, S 3 p= 2. 91 × 10 − 11  Nm rad− 1 and = 2. 77 × 10 − 11 Nm rad− 1 and the damping parameter R 3 p= 1. 46 × 10 − 12 Nm s rad− 1. For <b>angular</b> <b>velocities</b> larger than 0. 05  rad s− 1, which are common under natural conditions, a more accurate angular momentum equation was found to be given by a two-parameter Kelvin solid model.

While the two-parameter model has been used extensively in earlier work primarily at high hair <b>angular</b> <b>velocities,</b> to correctly capture the motion of the hair at both low and high <b>angular</b> <b>velocities</b> it is necessary to employ the three-parameter model.

40|$|In a {{previous}} paper [2], the active torques {{needed for the}} minisatellite attitude guidance from one fixed attitude posture to another fixed attitude posture were determined using an inverse dynamics method. But when considering reaction/momentum wheels, instead of this active torques computation, {{the purpose is to}} compute the <b>angular</b> <b>velocities</b> of the three reaction wheels which ensure the minisatellite to rotate from the initial to the final attitude.

This mode becomes unstable at higher <b>angular</b> <b>velocities,</b> initially to a sloshing mode on the rising side of the coating film and then to an axial instability on the front. The undulations that appear on the front grow into large-amplitude stationary patterns with cusp-like features for some parameter values.

We present a phase diagram of the various transitions and characterize some of the more prominent instabilities and patterns in detail, along with some possible mechanisms for the observed behaviour. ...|$|R
