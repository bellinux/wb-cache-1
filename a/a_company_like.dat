Other 386 PCs followed suit, and the AT (later ISA) bus remained a part of most systems even into the late 1990s.|$|R

60|$|I had {{occasion}} to say the other night in Boston, as I have more than once {{had occasion}} to remark before, {{that it is not}} easy for an author to speak of his own books. If the task be a difficult one at any time, its difficulty, certainly, is not diminished when a frequent recurrence to the same theme has left one nothing new to say.

For all that, it must be remembered that he could not stand against the unanimous family vote, and I have no doubt he will agree that you are now called upon to act as a kind of informal jury. Whatever course you decide on the directors must adopt. Your position is accordingly a serious and important one.
