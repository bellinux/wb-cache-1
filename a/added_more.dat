5|$|Among the deleted {{scenes are}} some that <b>added</b> <b>more</b> {{background}} information to the story, with commentary available by the editor and director. Most were deleted by Livolsi in favor of keeping the plot focused on the conflict between Miranda and Andrea, often without consulting Frankel.|$|E
5|$|Between the 1873 and the 1874 camp meeting seasons, the Mountain Grove Camp Meeting Association <b>added</b> <b>more</b> tents to the campground, {{increasing}} their number to almost 200. They also built a boarding house above {{the dining hall}} and a tabernacle was constructed across from the auditorium.|$|E
5|$|Repairs and {{alterations}} of {{the power}} plant continued until 1904, when the continuing boiler failures compelled the Navy to dispense with oil fuel and convert Rostislav to coal in 1904 and 1905. Each round of repairs and alterations <b>added</b> <b>more</b> weight to the already overweight ship, and by 1907 the ship's belt armor was completely below the waterline.|$|E

5|$|Accommodations {{were even}} more cramped and poorly {{ventilated}} than earlier ships because the ammunition hoists passed through the crew spaces, a problem for ships intended for long-endurance sorties into the North Atlantic. The lack of room in the hull forced a number of workshops and offices into the superstructure which <b>added</b> <b>more</b> weight high in the ship. There were three deckhouses abaft the break in the forecastle with intervals between them to permit the beam torpedo tubes to rotate, but these were no larger than in earlier ships which meant that space was at a premium.|$|E
5|$|Admiral Chichagov, {{named for}} Admiral Vasily Chichagov, was ordered on 4 June 1865 from the Semiannikov & Poletika Shipyard, Saint Petersburg, {{although}} the formal keel-laying {{was not until}} 20 November 1866. Construction was delayed by changes to the design and late deliveries of components. She was launched on 28 August 1868 and then transferred to Kronstadt for fitting out as the shallow waters around Saint Petersburg prevented deep-draft ships from being completed. This <b>added</b> <b>more</b> delays as the dockyard there lacked the equipment to efficiently fit out the ships, and she officially entered service in 1869 {{at the cost of}} 1,177,500 rubles.|$|E
5|$|After the Rove sediments were deposited, the Penokean orogeny <b>added</b> <b>more</b> {{land mass}} by {{accretion}} that occurred from the south. A few {{hundred million years}} later the proto-North American continent nearly split in half along the Midcontinent Rift zone, which is a bow-shaped rift extending from northeast Kansas, arcing through the present-day Lake Superior Basin and then angling southeast through Michigan. Then came a period of advancing and retreating glaciers. The more resistant diabase sills and dikes remained, while the softer shales were bulldozed away by the glaciers. The north path of glaciation is transverse to the general trend on the valleys and ridges.|$|E

30|$|We will {{restrict}} {{our analysis}} to this case, since lower values of α {{can be easily}} allowed by <b>adding</b> <b>more</b> doors, and higher values {{can be obtained by}} <b>adding</b> <b>more</b> doors and then opening more than one with goats. This general case follows in almost the same way.|$|R
5|$|At about 7:30 PM Khartoum time (17:30 GMT), two American {{warships}} in the Red Sea fired thirteen {{missiles at}} Sudan's Al-Shifa pharmaceutical factory, which the U.S. claimed was helping bin Laden build chemical weapons. The entire factory was destroyed {{except for the}} administration, water-cooling, and plant laboratory sections, which were severely damaged. One night watchman was killed and ten other Sudanese were wounded by the strike. Worried about the possibility for hazardous chemical leakages, analysts ran computer simulations on wind patterns, climate, and chemical data, which indicated a low risk of collateral damage. Regardless, planners <b>added</b> <b>more</b> cruise missiles to the strike on Al-Shifa, aiming to completely destroy the plant and any dangerous substances.|$|E
5|$|Barcelona, also of La Liga, {{entered the}} tournament {{in the last}} 32 against a Segunda División B club, Huesca. The first leg was in Aragon at the Estadio El Alcoraz on 3 December 2014, and Barcelona won 40 with goals from Ivan Rakitić, Andrés Iniesta, Pedro and Rafinha. Due to the large advantage, Barcelona rested key players for the second leg but {{nonetheless}} won 81 for a 121 aggregate. Pedro scored a hat-trick among further goals from Sergi Roberto and Iniesta for a 50 half-time lead, while Adriano and substitutes Adama Traoré and Sandro Ramírez <b>added</b> <b>more</b> goals in the second half; Carlos David scored a late consolation for the visitors.|$|E
5|$|Because {{the cats}} were {{registered}} as Abyssinians in the import certificates, {{and because the}} Meadows had been breeders of Abyssinian, Burmese, and Siamese, some have speculated that the Singapura is a Burmese/Abyssinian cross and it has even been described as such by CFA Judges. The resemblance of some Burmese/Abyssinian cross to the Singapura, {{as well as the}} Singapura's small litter size, which is uncommon in natural breeds, <b>added</b> <b>more</b> doubts to the Meadows' story.|$|E

50|$|The time-saving bias is {{not limited}} to driving. The same faulty estimations emerge when people are asked to {{estimate}} savings in patients’ waiting time when <b>adding</b> <b>more</b> physicians to a health care center (Svenson, 2008, Experiment 2) or when estimating an increase in the productivity of a manufacturing line by <b>adding</b> <b>more</b> workers (Svenson, 2011).|$|R
5|$|Bibliographers do {{not always}} agree who should be listed as editor of any given issue of Amazing. For example, Gernsback was in control {{for the first three}} years, but Sloane {{performed}} all the editorial duties related to fiction, and he is sometimes described as the editor. Similarly, later editors were sometimes under the supervision of editorial directors. The table below, and the charts above, generally follow the mastheads in the magazines, with short notes <b>added.</b> <b>More</b> details are given in the publishing history section, above, which focuses on when the editors involved actually obtained control of the magazine contents, instead of when their names appeared on the masthead.|$|E
5|$|Finally {{the project}} moved to Columbia Point, near the University of Massachusetts Boston. The new site {{was less than}} ideal; it was located on an old landfill, and just over a large sewage pipe. Pei's {{architectural}} team <b>added</b> <b>more</b> fill to cover the pipe and developed an elaborate ventilation system to conquer the odor. A new design was unveiled, combining a large square glass-enclosed atrium with a triangular tower and a circular walkway.|$|E
5|$|For decades, Gulf {{operated}} filling stations on the Pennsylvania Turnpike toll {{highway system}} alongside the Howard Johnson's restaurants at the Turnpike's travel plazas (which correspond to European motorway service areas). This began in 1950 {{with the opening}} of the Philadelphia Extension, and Gulf <b>added</b> <b>more</b> filling stations as the system was extended. The Standard Oil Company of Pennsylvania (now part of Exxon) had exclusive rights to provide filling station services on the sections of the system that opened prior to 1950, principally the Irwin-to-Carlisle section.|$|E

5|$|Further work {{along these}} lines led to the Nike-X Deployment Study, or DEPEX. DEPEX {{outlined}} a deployment that started out very similar to Nth Country, with a few bases primarily using Nike EX to provide lightweight cover, but which also included design features that allowed more bases to be added as {{the nature of the}} threat changed. The study described a four-phase deployment sequence that <b>added</b> <b>more</b> and more terminal defenses as the sophistication of the Nth Country missiles increased over time.|$|E
5|$|His {{expenditures}} {{in trying to}} remold Hawaii's monarchy into the European model added to the public debt, helping to increase the kingdom's expenditures on the monarchy by 50%. Kalākaua decided to have the coronation he had previously been denied due to the political climate when he was elected. On the 1883 anniversary of his 9th year in office, an elaborate public coronation ceremony was held at expenses exceeding $50,000. Kalākaua crowned himself. In 1886, Kalākaua's two-week 50th birthday Jubilee <b>added</b> <b>more</b> expense, reported by Harper's Weekly to be $75,000.|$|E
5|$|Hoskins {{describes}} how England was settled with Anglo-Saxon people between c. 450 and 1066 AD, making {{the country a}} land of villages. Estate boundaries from this period survive in features such as sunken lanes and banks. The Scandinavian conquest of much of England from the late 9th century <b>added</b> <b>more</b> villages, though many with Scandinavian placename elements such as -by ('village') may simply have been renamed Saxon settlements.|$|E

30|$|Once {{the visual}} {{representation}} of the work flow is established, less apparent patterns are reveled to the planner, simplifying the task of plan optimization. This may involve <b>adding</b> <b>more</b> crews (including equipment) to certain activities, <b>adding</b> <b>more</b> crew members (and/or other types of resources such as equipment) to certain activities, and/or changing the direction of flow of work.|$|R
5000|$|The Force Unleashed II refines {{gameplay}} {{elements from}} the first Force Unleashed, and <b>adds</b> <b>more</b> variety with such features as puzzle solving. Combat was modified to include the ability to wield dual lightsabers, which can dismember or decapitate enemies. The game also <b>adds</b> <b>more</b> Force powers, such as [...] "Mind Trick" [...] and [...] "Force Rage".|$|R
5|$|Orange Bowl {{organizers}} {{predicted that}} Virginia Tech fans, who were located {{closer to the}} site of the game, would be attracted by its proximity and the warm weather offered by southern Florida. Delta Air Lines <b>added</b> <b>more</b> flights from Virginia to Florida in anticipation. To entice more fans to attend, tourism officials planned to step up their advertising in order to boost the economic impact of the event, estimated in 2009 at $200million. The advertising campaign was a difficult sell because the game was scheduled for the first Monday after New Year's Day, the date when most American workers return to their jobs after the New Year.|$|E
5|$|Pat Nixon had an {{interest}} in adding artifacts to the Executive Mansion, and built on Jacqueline Kennedy's more publicized efforts. She <b>added</b> <b>more</b> than 600 paintings and furnishings to the White House and its collections, the largest number of acquisitions by any administration. She created the Map Room and renovated the China room, and refurbished nine others. She worked with engineers to develop an exterior lighting system for the entire White House, literally making it glow a soft white. She ordered the flag flown, day and night, even when the president was not there.|$|E
5|$|Square Enix {{chose to}} update Final Fantasy X and Final Fantasy X-2s {{graphics}} for a remastered release in high-definition. With a production cycle longer than two years, the graphics were not merely upscaled to higher resolutions and feature updated models and textures. Kitase commented {{that he wanted}} to excite new and returning players and <b>added</b> <b>more</b> depth to do so and opened up the possibility of further remasters based on reception. Many views could not simply be reframed to 16:9 because that would reveal characters waiting for their cues off-screen, so the remastering team performed a lot of redrawing and additions to the visuals.|$|E
