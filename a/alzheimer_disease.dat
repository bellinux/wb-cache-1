40|$|A 'frontal {{variant of}} Alzheimer's disease' has been {{described}} in patients with predominant behavioural or dysexecutive deficits caused by <b>Alzheimer's</b> <b>disease</b> pathology. The description of this rare <b>Alzheimer's</b> <b>disease</b> phenotype has been limited to case reports and small series, and many clinical, neuroimaging and neuropathological characteristics are not well understood. In this retrospective study, we included 55 patients with <b>Alzheimer's</b> <b>disease</b> with a behavioural-predominant presentation (behavioural <b>Alzheimer's</b> <b>disease)</b> and a neuropathological diagnosis of high-likelihood <b>Alzheimer's</b> <b>disease</b> (n = 17) and/or biomarker evidence of <b>Alzheimer's</b> <b>disease</b> pathology (n = 44). In addition, we included 29 patients with autopsy/biomarker-defined <b>Alzheimer's</b> <b>disease</b> with a dysexecutive-predominant syndrome (dysexecutive <b>Alzheimer's</b> <b>disease).</b> We performed structured chart reviews to ascertain clinical features. First symptoms were more often cognitive (behavioural Alzheimer's disease: 53 %; dysexecutive Alzheimer's disease: 83 %) than behavioural (behavioural Alzheimer's disease: 25 %; dysexecutive Alzheimer's disease: 3 %). Apathy {{was the most common}} behavioural feature, while hyperorality and perseverative/compulsive behaviours were less prevalent. Fifty-two per cent of patients with behavioural <b>Alzheimer's</b> <b>disease</b> met diagnostic criteria for possible behavioural-variant frontotemporal dementia. Overlap between behavioural and dysexecutive <b>Alzheimer's</b> <b>disease</b> was modest (9 / 75 patients). Sixty per cent of patients with behavioural <b>Alzheimer's</b> <b>disease</b> and 40 % of those with the dysexecutive syndrome carried at least one APOE ε 4 allele. We also compared neuropsychological test performance and brain atrophy (applying voxel-based morphometry) with matched autopsy/biomarker-defined typical (amnestic-predominant) <b>Alzheimer's</b> <b>disease</b> (typical <b>Alzheimer's</b> <b>disease,</b> n = 58), autopsy-confirmed/Alzheimer's disease biomarker-negative behavioural variant frontotemporal dementia (n = 59), and controls (n = 61). Patients with behavioural <b>Alzheimer's</b> <b>disease</b> showed worse memory scores than behavioural variant frontotemporal dementia and did not differ from typical <b>Alzheimer's</b> <b>disease,</b> while executive function composite scores were lower compared to behavioural variant frontotemporal dementia and typical <b>Alzheimer's</b> <b>disease.</b> Voxel-wise contrasts between behavioural and dysexecutive <b>Alzheimer's</b> <b>disease</b> patients and controls revealed marked atrophy in bilateral temporoparietal regions and only limited atrophy in the frontal cortex. In direct comparison with behavioural and those with dysexecutive <b>Alzheimer's</b> <b>disease,</b> patients with behavioural variant frontotemporal dementia showed more frontal atrophy and less posterior involvement, whereas patients with typical <b>Alzheimer's</b> <b>disease</b> were slightly more affected posteriorly and showed less frontal atrophy (P < 0. 001 uncorrected). Among 24 autopsied behavioural <b>Alzheimer's</b> disease/dysexecutive <b>Alzheimer's</b> <b>disease</b> patients, only two had primary co-morbid FTD-spectrum pathology (progressive supranuclear palsy). In conclusion, behavioural <b>Alzheimer's</b> <b>disease</b> presentations are characterized by a milder and more restricted behavioural profile than in behavioural variant frontotemporal dementia, co-occurrence of memory dysfunction and high APOE ε 4 prevalence. Dysexecutive <b>Alzheimer's</b> <b>disease</b> presented as a primarily cognitive phenotype with minimal behavioural abnormalities and intermediate APOE ε 4 prevalence. Both behavioural <b>Alzheimer's</b> <b>disease</b> and dysexecutive <b>Alzheimer's</b> <b>disease</b> presentations are distinguished by temporoparietal-predominant atrophy. Based on the relative sparing of frontal grey matter, we propose to redefine these clinical syndromes as 'the behavioural/dysexecutive variant of Alzheimer's disease' rather than frontal variant <b>Alzheimer's</b> <b>disease.</b> Further work is needed to determine whether behavioural and dysexecutive-predominant presentations of <b>Alzheimer's</b> <b>disease</b> represent distinct phenotypes or a single continuum...|$|R

Strong associations of lower age at symptom onset with higher 18 F-AV- 1451 uptake were observed in several neocortical regions, while higher age did not yield positive associations in neither patient group. Comparing patients with early-onset <b>Alzheimer's</b> <b>disease</b> with controls resulted in significantly higher 18 F-AV- 1451 retention throughout the neocortex, while comparing healthy controls with late-onset <b>Alzheimer's</b> <b>disease</b> patients yielded a distinct pattern of higher 18 F-AV- 1451 retention, predominantly confined to temporal lobe regions.

2500|$|The PLAU gene encodes a serine {{protease}} (...) involved in {{degradation of the}} extracellular matrix and possibly tumor cell migration and proliferation. A specific polymorphism in this gene {{may be associated with}} late-onset <b>Alzheimer</b> <b>disease</b> and also with decreased affinity for fibrin-binding. The protein encoded by this gene converts plasminogen to plasmin by specific cleavage of an Arg-Val bond in plasminogen. This gene's proprotein is cleaved at a Lys-Ile bond by plasmin to form a two-chain derivative in which a single disulfide bond connects the amino-terminal A-chain to the catalytically active, carboxy-terminal B-chain. This two-chain derivative is also called HMW-uPA (high molecular weight uPA). HMW-uPA can be further processed into LMW-uPA (low molecular weight uPA) by cleavage of chain A into a short chain A (A1) and an amino-terminal fragment. LMW-uPA is proteolytically active but does not bind to the uPA receptor.|$|E

Globally, AD prevalence is expected to rise to 45 million by 2050, with three of every four patients with AD living in a developing nation.

Recent findings have suggested that the PS- 1 polymorphism is not associated with <b>Alzheimer's</b> <b>disease</b> or amyloid β-protein (Aβ) deposition in brains from patients with <b>Alzheimer's</b> <b>disease.</b>  OBJECTIVES—To elucidate the influence of the PS- 1 polymorphism on Alzheimer type neuropathological changes and the development of <b>Alzheimer's</b> <b>disease,</b> the relation between the PS- 1 polymorphism and quantitative severity of Alzheimer type neuropathological changes in the brains from patients with <b>Alzheimer's</b> <b>disease</b> and non-demented subjects was studied.  METHODS—The PS- 1 and apolipoprotein E (ApoE) genotypes, were examined, together with the densities of the senile plaques, senile plaques with dystrophic neurites, and neurofibrillary tangles in the brains from 36 postmortem confirmed patients with sporadic <b>Alzheimer's</b> <b>disease</b> and 86 non-demented subjects. Association of the PS- 1 polymorphism with sporadic <b>Alzheimer's</b> <b>disease</b> and ages at onset and duration of illness in <b>Alzheimer's</b> <b>disease</b> was also examined.  RESULTS—The PS- 1 polymorphism was not associated with the senile plaques, senile plaques with dystrophic neurites, or neurofibrillary tangles in <b>Alzheimer's</b> <b>disease</b> or non-demented subjects. There was no association of the PS- 1 intronic polymorphism with <b>Alzheimer's</b> <b>disease,</b> ages at onset, or durations of illness in <b>Alzheimer's</b> <b>disease.</b> The results remained non-significant even when the PS- 1 genotype groups were divided into the subgroups withdifferent ApoE ε 4 status.  CONCLUSIONS—The PS- 1 intronic polymorphism does not itself have a direct causal role in the formation of Alzheimer type neuropathological changes or in the development of sporadic <b>Alzheimer's</b> <b>disease.</b> ...|$|R
