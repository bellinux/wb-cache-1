50|$|Conventional SiC, or {{sometimes}} the less expensive SiSiC, {{have been used}} successfully for more than 25 years in slide or journal bearings of pumps. The pumped liquid itself provides the lubricant for the bearing. Very good corrosion resistance against practically all kinds of media, and very low wear and low friction coefficients are {{the basis of this}} success. These bearings consist of a static bearing, shrink-fitted in its metallic environment, and a rotating shaft sleeve, mounted on the shaft. Under compressive stress the ceramic static bearing has a low risk of failure, but a SiC shaft sleeve does not have this situation and must therefore have a large wall thickness and/or be specially designed. In large pumps with shafts 100-350 mm in diameter, the risk of failure is higher due to the changing requirements on the pump performance - for example, load changes during operation. The introduction of SiC/SiC as <b>a</b> <b>shaft</b> <b>sleeve</b> material has proven to be very successful. Test rig experiments showed an almost triple specific load capability of the bearing system with <b>a</b> <b>shaft</b> <b>sleeve</b> made of SiC/SiC, sintered SiC as static bearing, and water at 80 °C as lubricant.The specific load capacity of a bearing is usually given in W/mm2 and calculated as a product of the load (MPa), surface speed of the bearing (m/s) and friction coefficient; it is equal to the power loss of the bearing system due to friction.|$|E

The design is a runway system, consisting of a platform incorporating rails on which the carriages run as they bear the rotor being pulled with a pulling jack. We utilized statically indeterminate approach to design the platform to very high flexural rigidity to avoid deflection, a necessary condition, to prevent damage to the generator field winding. The design was successful; the system constructed and used to pull-out/pull-in six rotors of the gas turbine generators; and is still being stored for further use when the need arises...|$|E
50|$|Such {{gearboxes}} {{had been}} built before, but neither widely used nor successfully. Porsche had used one for his 1907 Maja, {{with a series of}} internal pawls inside the shaft which could be pushed out one-by-one to engage the gears. Goggomobil and Claude Hill of Ferguson, had both used an internal 'bung' sliding inside the shaft to push out a locking cam or balls through the hollow shaft and engage the gears. Archie Butterworth's AJB Special had used a <b>sleeve</b> over <b>a</b> solid <b>shaft,</b> the <b>sleeve</b> sliding lengthways to engage the gears and also to act as the other gear's bearing surface. The Butterworth design was the one chosen. The designs were so similar that Chapman initially negotiated with Butterworth for the rights to use it, but without any final agreement.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The {{bearing support}} {{breakage}} of screw coal powder conveyor in power plant boiler went through four stages: axial displacement of <b>shaft</b> <b>sleeve,</b> <b>shaft</b> <b>sleeve</b> wearing by shield ring and by bearing, and {{the wearing of}} skeleton seal rings and dustproof felts by <b>shaft</b> <b>sleeve.</b> By analyzing the wearing characters of each part, the renovation structure was designed. The bearing settled style was changed from using shield ring to using locknut by designing convex sidestep on the <b>shaft</b> <b>sleeve,</b> preventing the axial from drifting. Substituting for the welding assembly, the bolt connecting between the covers and the bearing support body was selected to replace the worn sealing materials easily in dismantling and installing. Good operating effects were achieved after the renovation of the coal powder conveyor bearing support, in the screw coal powder manufacturing line of 100 MW power plant boiler, there was no line vibrating, coal leaking, noising and line locking, having decreased the repairing cost greatly and insuring the safety and stable electric power producing...|$|R

40|$|Gland sealing {{has been}} {{researched}} since the 1950 ’s by the British Hydraulic Research Association and others to improve seal performance. The literature review showed the focus had been on uniform packing compression to more closely match the packing pressure distribution to the fluid pressure {{with the objective of}} reducing leakage over time. There was limited work on the tribology of gland sealing and the patents were dominated by seal designs in a liquor environment. The review identified the particle properties of hardness, shape, fracture toughness and size as relevant to the wear and useful life of a gland seal in a slurry environment. This research presents the design, development and testing of a novel laboratory test rig which deliberately injects slurry particles into a typical standard slurry pump gland seal to cause wear of the sacrificial <b>shaft</b> <b>sleeve.</b> Mineral processing relies on slurry pumping to transfer slurry between plant operations and to improve life cycle costs and reliability in the long term a tribology approach was employed for the research. A range of mineral and synthetic particles were selected over the widest possible hardness range, tested and correlated with the output variable (specific wear rate) of the <b>shaft</b> <b>sleeve.</b> The wear of the <b>shaft</b> <b>sleeve</b> was normalised by travel distance and gland follower load. The data was combined by a novel empirical regression wear model which unified the controlling variables of load, travel distance, particle size, hardness, fracture toughness and size. Recent published values of hardness and fracture toughness were included in the analysis. A linear regression model with interactive terms between the fracture toughness, particle size and hardness, including a log term for the size, provided a good fit with statistical significance to the experimental data. Some dependency was demonstrated between the controlling variables of fracture toughness and particle size. Particle shape was found not to be relevant to the model for particle sizes less than 500 microns. A novel particle shape descriptor weighted dihedral angle which described the average dihedral angle of particle vertices, was proposed and this did not provide any more accuracy than existing descriptors such as SPQ. It was discovered during the experiments that slurry particles may form quasi particles in the seal gap depending on the geometric parameters, gap dimension and material parameters of the opposing (packing) surface, in a semi continuous process. A new tribology qualitative model for the wear of the <b>shaft</b> <b>sleeve</b> and motion of the particles in the gap is described. The relevant particle properties have also been combined into a novel dimensionless number (PDN) which was found to provide a significant correlation with the <b>shaft</b> <b>sleeve</b> SWR, and therefore has the potential to {{serve as the basis for}} future research investigation in three body wear.

40|$|LecturePg. 57 - 62 The {{retrofit}} of a 35000 hp, two-case centrifugal, propylene refrigeration compressor with tandem dry {{gas seals}} in DuPont's ethylene plant at Orange, Texas, is described. The installation of these dry gas seals {{is one of}} the first applications to propylene refrigeration service in the United States. The new seal design eliminated seal oil contamination of the compressor and downstream heat exchangers which led to decreased efficiency, effectiveness, and subsequent loss of ethylene production. The seals also reduced the capital investment for a flare system upgrade project $ 1. 5 MM, by decreasing propylene losses during system shutdowns caused by existing seal system shortcomings. This retrofit was unique in several ways. The original compressor manufacturer had no experience with dry gas seals installed in their equipment. They were very willing to cooperate in this venture, but only to the point of providing dimensional data and engineering review. Due to the "sold-out" condition of the ethylene market, this installation had to be accomplished during a limited shutdown. In order to minimize downtime, an innovative installation method was developed which eliminated opening compressor casings even though the new design required removing-a <b>shaft</b> <b>sleeve.</b> To demonstrate the feasibility of this method, a mock up was built simulating working conditions to develop techniques and tooling to remove the <b>shaft</b> <b>sleeve...</b>|$|R
