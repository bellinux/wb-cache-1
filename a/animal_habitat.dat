With an overall theme around Egyptian mythology, the ride is named after the god of war Montu, a man depicted {{with the head of}} a hawk. When the ride was first launched, a Nile crocodile exhibit was located underneath the first section of the ride. These animals were later relocated to the park's main <b>animal</b> <b>habitat.</b>|$|E

2500|$|Action Zone {{opened in}} 1974 as Lion Country Safari, a [...] {{section of the}} park {{featuring}} a monorail ride that took guests on a safari-style tour through an animal preservation. This {{was part of a}} network of other safari-style zoos also called Lion Country Safari. It was later renamed Wild Animal Safari in 1977. In 1983, the area became known as Wild <b>Animal</b> <b>Habitat</b> and included Adventure Village, a new area within the rebranded section. Over the years, it featured rides such as Screamin' Demon (1977–87), the first steel looping roller coaster to run both forward and backward in the United States, and King Cobra (1984–2001), a stand-up looping roller coaster that was {{the first of its kind}} in the world.|$|E
2500|$|Early in its tenure after {{purchasing}} Kings Island, Paramount unveiled Top Gun, {{a suspended}} roller coaster from Arrow Dynamics, in 1993. Located {{next to the}} habitat attraction, it was titled after a film {{of the same name}} and was the first ride {{to be added to the}} park with a Paramount theme. The following year, the entire area was renamed Adventure Village coinciding with the removal of the <b>animal</b> <b>habitat</b> and monorail ride. In 1999, a two-year expansion initiative began with the area's renaming to Action Zone and the addition of two new attractions– [...] and Face/Off. When it debuted, Action Zone resembled a movie stunt set featuring a water tower as the centerpiece. The water tower was originally part of a skit with stunts and special effects that imitated a live movie set with a director and stunt performers.|$|E
2500|$|Most {{mathematical}} {{studies in}} ecology {{in the nineteenth}} century assumed a uniform distribution of living organisms in their habitat. In the past quarter century, ecologists have begun to recognize the degree to which organisms respond to spatial patterns in their environment. Due to the rapid advances in computer technology in the same time period, more advanced methods of statistical data analysis have come into use. Also, the repeated use of remotely sensed imagery and geographic information systems in a particular area has led to increased analysis and identification of spatial patterns over time. [...] These technologies have also increased the ability to determine how human activities have impacted <b>animal</b> <b>habitat</b> and climate change. The natural world has become increasingly fragmented due to human activities; anthropogenic landscape change has had a ripple-effect impacts on wildlife populations, which are now more likely to be small, restricted in distribution, and increasingly isolated from one another. In part as a reaction to this knowledge, and partially due to increasingly sophisticated theoretical developments, ecologists began stressing the importance of spatial context in research. Spatial ecology emerged from this movement toward spatial accountability; [...] "the progressive introduction of spatial variation and complexity into ecological analysis, including changes in spatial patterns over time".|$|E
