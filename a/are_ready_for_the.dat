25|$|Throughout February and March, {{the first}} to leave the lagoons are males and females without new calves. Pregnant females and nursing mothers with their newborns are the last to depart, leaving only when their calves <b>are</b> <b>ready</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> journey, which is usually from late March to mid-April. Often, a few mothers linger with their young calves well into May.|$|E
25|$|Salmon {{start the}} run in peak condition, the {{culmination}} of years of development in the ocean. They need high swimming and leaping abilities to battle the rapids and other obstacles the river may present, and they need a full sexual development {{to ensure a successful}} spawn {{at the end of the}} run. All their energy goes into the physical rigours of the journey and the dramatic morphological transformations they must still complete before they <b>are</b> <b>ready</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> spawning events ahead.|$|E

25|$|The use {{of black}} blow fly maggots in maggot therapy is common. After the maggots have hatched, they are {{carefully}} monitored {{until they reach}} roughly 2 to 3mm in length; at this point they <b>are</b> <b>ready</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> next step. Within 24 to 36 hours of hatching, the maggots are tested for their sterility; if they pass the rigorous tests, then they {{may be used in}} maggot therapy. These maggots are placed onto a sterile piece of gauze which is laid over the wound of the patient. The maggots will proceed through the gauze to the open wound, where they will then begin their work. When they are full-grown, they leave the wound and enter the gauze for the purpose of pupating. They are then removed with the waste gauze and disposed of properly.|$|E
25|$|The {{movement}} {{starts in}} the initial position with the body completely straight, body movement is coordinated such that the legs <b>are</b> <b>ready</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> thrust phase while the arms are halfway through the insweep, and the head {{is out of the}} water for breathing. In this position the body has also the largest angle to the horizontal. The arms are recovered during the thrust phase of the legs. After the stroke the body is kept in the initial position for some time to utilize the gliding phase. Depending on the distance and fitness the duration of this gliding phase varies. Usually the gliding phase is shorter during sprints than during long distance swimming. The gliding phase is also longer during the underwater stroke after the start and each turn. However, the gliding phase is usually the longest phase in one entire cycle of breaststroke.|$|E

500|$|In a June 2017 {{interview}} with Ultimate Guitar, Gary Holt {{said that he}} is ready to contribute with the songwriting for the next album. When speaking to Revolver, King was asked if there were any plans in place for the band to begin working on the album, he said, [...] "Funny thing is, Repentless isn't even two years old yet, though it seems like it is. But from that session, there are six or eight songs that are recorded — some with vocals, some with leads, but all with keeper guitar, drums and bass. So when those songs get finished lyrically, if the lyrics don't change the songs, they'll be ready to be on the next record. So we already have more than half a record complete, if those songs make it." [...] He also gave conceivable consideration that it could be released next year, [...] "I'm certainly not gonna promise it, because every time I do, I make a liar of myself! [...] " [...] When asked about any plans or the timeline the band would like to release the album, King said, [...] "It depends on touring — getting time to rehearse, getting time to make up new stuff. We haven't even done Australia on this run yet at all. We're hitting Japan finally later this year. But if things go well, I'd like to record next year. But timelines change all the time." [...] In an October 2017 interview, Holt once again expressed his desire to contribute to the songwriting for the next Slayer album, saying, [...] "When that time comes and we <b>are</b> <b>ready</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> next album, if Kerry wants me to contribute, I've got riffs. I've got stuff right now that I've written that I am not using for Exodus, because it was kind of maybe just unintentional subconscious thing, like, 'It sounds a little too Slayer.'" ...|$|E
