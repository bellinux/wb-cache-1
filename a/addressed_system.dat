Furthermore, the specific estimation of positive invariant and global exponential attractive sets of the <b>addressed</b> <b>system</b> is also derived.

Functional requirements define the operation of the system with respect to its stakeholders: media consumers, news desks, the business office, news sources and advertisers. Context awareness requirements allow a media consumer’s newspaper to be adapted to the consumer’s personal taste, reading behaviour and his current whereabouts. Extended services requirements extend newspapers with services from third party service providers (e. g. concert ticket offices, book stores, restaurants [...] .) which can target consumers that match a particular profile. These requirements are illustrated using a number of real life scenarios.
