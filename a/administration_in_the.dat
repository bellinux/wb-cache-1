40|$|Formation {{of local}} {{government}} system <b>in</b> <b>the</b> cities with district division <b>in</b> Ukraine is <b>the</b> reason of improvement of such local government as a city district administration. The process of formation and development of <b>the</b> district <b>administrations</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> cities has begun in Ukraine since 90 -s years of 20 th century. Moreover {{the development of a}} new mechanism of management of cities with district division involved the elimination of duplication of powers between the city and district councils <b>in</b> <b>the</b> city and involved better efficiency in decision making. For a long time the political scientist consider district <b>administrations</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> cities as intermediate form of government and form of realization of urban policy. That’s why the main aim of research is theoretical basis of institute of state <b>administrations</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> cities. The study analyzed concept of district <b>administrations</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> cities. Current legislation <b>in</b> <b>the</b> branch of local authority hasn’t definition of district <b>administrations</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> cities as the body of executive power. Legitimacy of district <b>administrations</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> cities is confirmed by article 11 of the Law «About local government in Ukraine», which says that executive bodies of village, town, city, district councils <b>in</b> <b>the</b> cities are their executive committees, units, departments and other executive bodies. In this way we can say that district <b>administrations</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> cities are «other executive bodies». According to this statement the governance <b>the</b> district <b>in</b> <b>the</b> cities through the district <b>administrations</b> is absent <b>in</b> scientific literature and <b>in</b> <b>the</b> laws about local government in Ukraine. As a result we can make conclusion that district <b>administrations</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> cities are executive regulatory body of the general power of city council. This body implements the main difficult tasks of district level and coordinates implementations of city council decisions and mayor orders at the territory of district within <b>the</b> powers and <b>in</b> <b>the</b> ways determined by the city council...|$|R

40|$|Parliamentary <b>Administrations</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> European Union {{offers a}} {{comprehensive}} overview {{over the role}} of parliamentary <b>administrations</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> control of European Union policy-making.

In this pursuit, it argues that the challenges of information-management faced by parliaments lead them to delegate an extensive set of tasks to their administrations. The book offers a broad empirical picture: It analyses the challenges faced by national parliaments and the role and response of their <b>administrations</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> case of the European Parliament, national parliaments and regional parliaments.

5|$|As {{a second}} level {{administrative}} division municipalities are the third tier of public <b>administration</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Netherlands after {{the central government}} and the provinces.

The different levels do, however, make work agreements, which give municipalities a certain degree of independence in their policy decisions. Municipalities are responsible {{for a wide variety of}} public services, which include land-use planning, public housing, management and maintenance of local roads, waste management and social security.

5|$|Concorde {{produced}} {{nitrogen oxides}} in its exhaust, which, despite complicated interactions with other ozone-depleting chemicals, are understood {{to result in}} degradation to the ozone layer at the stratospheric altitudes it cruised. It has been pointed out that other, lower-flying, airliners produce ozone during their flights in the troposphere, but vertical transit of gases between the layers is restricted. The small fleet meant overall ozone-layer degradation caused by Concorde was negligible. In 1995, David Fahey, of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric <b>Administration</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> United States, warned that a fleet of 500 supersonic aircraft with exhausts similar to Concorde might produce in a 2 per cent drop in global ozone levels, much higher than previously thought. Each 1 per cent drop in ozone is estimated to increase the incidence of non-melanoma skin cancer worldwide by 2 per cent. Dr Fahey said if these particles are produced by highly oxidised sulphur in the fuel, as he believed, then removing sulphur in the fuel will reduce the ozone-destroying impact of supersonic transport.|$|E
