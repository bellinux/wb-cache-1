40|$|Abstract. Prediction of mechanical, thermal, and {{chemical}} actions induced during man-made accidents (<b>accidental</b> <b>actions)</b> is of crucial importance to assessing potential damage to structures exposed to these actions. A logical {{result of such}} a prediction may be expressed {{in the form of}} probabilistic models describing likelihood of occurrence and characteristics of <b>accidental</b> <b>actions.</b> For many types of <b>accidental</b> <b>actions</b> the models are to be selected under the conditions of incomplete knowledge about and/or scarce statistical information on intensities and likelihood of imposition of the actions. This paper proposes a simulation-based procedure intended for a selection of the probabilistic models under these conditions. The proposed procedure is formulated {{in the context of the}} classical Bayesian approach to risk assessment. The main idea of it is that statistical samples necessary for fitting the probabilistic action models can be acquired from a stochastic simulation of accident sequences leading to an imposition of <b>accidental</b> <b>actions.</b> Formally, the stochastic simulation of accidents serves the purpose of propagating uncertainties related to the physical phenomena capable of inducing <b>accidental</b> <b>actions.</b> These uncertainties are quantified in line with the classical Bayesian approach. The simulation-based procedure can be used for damage assessment and risk studies within the methodological framework provided by the above-mentioned approach...|$|R

The final {{published}} version is available at: doi: 10. 4203 /ccp. 106. 42 In the study {{presented in this}} paper, static and dynamic nonlinear analyses were undertaken on representative planar frames {{with a range of}} different geometrical and mechanical parameters, with the aim of assessing whether analysis methods drawn from current seismic design principles can be successfully applied to the case of a typical robustness scenario, where a column is suddenly lost {{as a result of an}} <b>accidental</b> <b>action.</b> It was shown that static nonlinear methods of analysis can provide a good approximation of the structural response. Seismic detailing was found to significantly improve robustness, with higher benefits seen at low ductility levels, and similar trends to what is currently known within earthquake engineering were obtained. The geometric nonlinearity was found to be critical, allowing for a realistic representation of the structural performance. Increasing the number of storeys was shown to enhance progressive collapse resistance, while gravity loads tend to increase progressive collapse and ductility demands; on the contrary, equivalent viscous damping was shown to reduce the ductility demand. Removal time was found to be of primary importance on the structural response, with inertial effects significantly being reduced when the removal time is longer...|$|E

Once the direct and indirect consequences are identified and quantified these values could be used to assess a structure?s robustness, for example following the risk-based definition for this attribute suggested by Baker (2008). The {{consequences of}} failure vary significantly from structure to structure, and may depend {{on a wide range of}} factors, including: ? Nature of the hazard; ? Properties of the structure; ?

As a result, the `cost of failure? is a multi-dimensional and highly variable quantity, a fact that is reiterated throughout the literature on the topic (Soltani and Corotis, 1988; Kanda and Shah, 1997). These factors are discussed further in the following sections, and the various types of consequences arising from building failures are examined.

40|$|At {{every moment}} of our lives, there is {{something}} going on, some experience. We see, hear, smell, touch, think. —Varela, Thompson, and Rosch 1993, 59 Piaget (1952) described a pattern of infant activity that he called a sec-ondary circular reaction. A rattle would {{be placed in a}} four-month-old infant’s hands. As the infant moved the rattle, it would both come into sight and also make a noise, arousing and agitating the infant and causing more body motions, and thus causing the rattle to move into and out of sight and to make more noise. Infants at this age have very little organized control over hand and eye movement. They cannot yet reach for a rattle and if given one, they do not necessarily shake it. But if the infant accidentally moves it, and sees and hears the consequences, the infant will become captured by the activity—moving and shaking, looking and listening—and incrementally through this repeated action gaining intentional control over the shaking of the rattle. Piaget thought that this pattern of activity—an <b>accidental</b> <b>action</b> that leads to an interesting and arousing outcome and thus more activity and the re-experience of the outcome—to be foundational to development itself. Circular reactions are perception-action loops that create opportunities for learning. In the case of the rattle, the repeated activity teaches how to control one’s body, which actions bring held objects into view, and how sights, sounds and actions correspond. Edelman (1987) also pointed to the coupling of heterogeneous senso-rimotor systems in the creation of cognition. Edelman’s theory starts by recognizing the multimodal nature of the brain at birth; it is—from the start—a complex system made up of many heterogeneous, overlapping, interacting and densely connected subsystems. Like Piaget, Edelman pro-posed that development occurs through activity dependent processes. ...|$|E
40|$|Progressive {{collapse}} of civil engineering structures is originated by the localized failure {{of one or}} more structural member following an abnormal loading event (<b>accidental</b> <b>action,</b> natural hazard, attack). This local failure initiates load redistribution in the structure which, in turn leads to additional collapse and eventually results in a wide-spread catastrophic partial or total structural failure to an extent disproportionate to the initial triggering event. Codes of design in civil engineering (e. g. Eurocodes) require ensuring structural robustness to decrease the destructive impact of accidents or malevolent attacks to structures, without however precisely specifying how to define and quantify structural robustness. A fundamental question therefore arises with regards to the assessment of structural robustness. Considering the complex (dynamic) nature of structural damage and collapse and the nonlinear interplay of materials behaviour (rate-dependent elastic and plastic behavior for instance) and design parameters (e. g. reinforcements position and fraction in reinforced concrete beam sections, connection features in steel structures), this requires the use of advanced computational tools. The prime goal of this research axis of the BATir department of the Univesité Libre de Bruxelles (ULB) is to develop dedicated computational tools for the investigation of the notion of structural robustness via the numerical simulation of structural collapse. The current methodology (multilayered beam formulation and dynamic nonlinear structural framework) uses a direct transition from the nonlinear strain rate dependent behavior of concrete and steel at the constituent level to the response of the structural members at the global scale via a computational homogenization scheme. This allows deriving physically motivated relationships between generalized stresses and strains at the sectional level and conducting sensitivity analyses on the design and material parameters influence on the structural response of multi-storey planar frames subjected to a sudden column loss. The universal demand for developments in structural and civil engineering striving for increased structural safety safeguards the motivation of this research subject.

Parietal patients had particular difficulties {{in the identification of}} pretend actions, and both parietal and frontal patients were more impaired than controls in understanding the intentional nature of pretence. Analyses of individual patients' performance revealed that parietal lesions, and in particular lesions to the temporo-parietal junction, impaired the ability to discriminate pretend from real actions. However, this did not necessarily affect the discrimination of intentional from unintentional actions, which instead may be independently disrupted by damage to frontal areas. Moreover, spared ability to discriminate pretend actions from real actions, and intentional <b>actions</b> from <b>accidental</b> <b>actions,</b> did not grant a full conceptual understanding of the intentional nature of pretence.

50|$|Another social-cognitive {{revolution}} {{that has been}} explored by Tomasello {{is the idea of}} imitation.

This means that infants observe an action, identify the underlying goal, and mimic the means of achieving the goal that they observe. In their 1998 study, Tomasello and colleagues conducted an experiment which proved 16-month-old infants only copied the intentional actions of adults, ignoring the <b>accidental</b> <b>actions.</b> This shows that children reproduce actions only to achieve the intended end result, and they do not just mimic actions that have no meaning behind them.
