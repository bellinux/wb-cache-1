25|$|The {{addition}} of regional offices {{and resulted in}} the microwave radio relay being upgraded in the 1970s. The Telecommunications Administration insisted on continuing using <b>analog</b> <b>transmission,</b> while NRK instead wanted to implement a digital transmission. NRK got its way, and a transistor-based system with a capacity corresponding to 960 telephone lines was installed. The resulting system had two radio channels, one for transmitting radio from Oslo to the regional offices and one for transmission between the regional offices. The FM transmitters were fed their programs from the regional offices. The system had a two-way television channel, which could feed the television programs to the transmitters and allow for transfer of program content from the regional offices to Oslo. The sound transfer system had four 2-megabit channels; the one was used for 30 telephone lines {{and the other was}} used for 5 program channels. These had a sampling rate of 32kHz and a 14-bit bit rate, which was reduced to 11 through compression. No other available systems could produce this quality of audio.|$|E
500|$|The {{broadcast}} media industry is {{at a critical}} turning point in its development, with many countries moving from analog to digital broadcasts. This move is {{made possible by the}} production of cheaper, faster and more capable integrated circuits. The chief advantage of digital broadcasts is that they prevent a number of complaints common to traditional analog broadcasts. For television, this includes the elimination of problems such as snowy pictures, ghosting and other distortion. These occur {{because of the nature of}} <b>analog</b> <b>transmission,</b> which means that perturbations due to noise will be evident in the final output. Digital transmission overcomes this problem because digital signals are reduced to discrete values upon reception and hence small perturbations do not affect the final output. In a simplified example, if a binary message 1011 was transmitted with signal amplitudes [...] and received with signal amplitudes [...] it would still decode to the binary message 1011 — a perfect reproduction of what was sent. From this example, a problem with digital transmissions can also be seen in that if the noise is great enough it can significantly alter the decoded message. Using forward error correction a receiver can correct a handful of bit errors in the resulting message but too much noise will lead to incomprehensible output and hence a breakdown of the transmission.|$|E

2500|$|WTVR-TV {{shut down}} its analog signal, over VHF channel 6, {{in the late}} morning of June 12, 2009, after more than 60 years, the {{official}} date in which full-power television stations in the United States transitioned from analog to digital broadcasts under federal mandate. The station's digital signal remained on its pre-transition UHF channel 25. Through the use of PSIP, digital television receivers continues to display the station's virtual channel as its former VHF analog channel 6.1. [...] Prior to the transition, the audio component of WTVR's analog channel 6 signal at 87.75MHz had been heavily promoted as available to listeners tuning to 87.7 on a standard FM radio receiver.

40|$|Abstract—In this paper, a new <b>analog</b> signal <b>transmission</b> {{technique}} called <b>analog</b> single-carrier <b>transmission</b> with frequency-domain equalization (analog SC-FDE) is proposed. The proposed analog SC-FDE applies discrete Fourier transform (DFT), frequency-domain spectrum shaping and mapping, inverse DFT (IDFT), and cyclic prefix insertion before transmission. At the receiver, one-tap frequency-domain equalization (FDE) {{is applied to}} take advantage of the channel frequency-selectivity. As an example, in this paper, the <b>analog</b> voice <b>transmission</b> is considered. By computer simulation, we evaluate the normalized mean square error (NMSE) performance to show that analog SC-FDE achieves better NMSE performance than conventional <b>analog</b> signal <b>transmission</b> scheme.
