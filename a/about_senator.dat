[...] The novel was adapted in 1958 by X Minus One into a radio teleplay and broadcast on July 3, 1956. In a 1977 interview Sturgeon commented that it was his concerns about the ongoing McCarthy Hearings that prompted him to write the story.|$|E

Senator wants FCC to issue report card, name sponsors". Cuse responded by writing {{a letter to the}} editor. In the letter, entitled [...] "'Brisco County' Is a Family-Oriented Series", Cuse objected to the newspaper story title labeling Brisco as the [...] "bloodiest series". He said that Senator Dorgan's press release did not mention blood and that the show's violence should be viewed in context. Cuse added the show had been listed as family friendly in other publications, and that he read every viewer letter sent regarding the show. [...] "The overwhelming majority praise [...] "Brisco County" [...] for being a show that the entire family can watch together. After 15 original airings, I have not received one single letter criticizing the show on the grounds of violence or violent content." [...] When the US Senate discussed forcing broadcast and cable networks to regulate violent programming, Cuse said that self-regulation within the industry was a positive move. [...] As he operated on his [...] "own internal moral principles", the measures would not affect his week-to-week work.|$|E

500|$|Sestak {{insisted he}} would not make a final {{decision}} for several months. On May 4, he met with Andy Stern, president of the Service Employees International Union, which fueled speculation that he was seeking labor support for a campaign. Meanwhile, Joe Torsella, {{the former president of}} the National Constitution Center, had planned on running for the Democratic nomination and initially announced Specter's party change would not affect his decision to run. However, Torsella announced on May 14 he was dropping out of the race because Specter's decision changed the political landscape, and he wanted to avoid a campaign that [...] "would probably be negative, personal, and more <b>about</b> <b>Senator</b> Specter's past than our common future". It had been reported that Governor Rendell, for whom Torsella previously worked as an aide, pushed for Torsella to step aside so Specter could run unopposed, but Torsella's staff denied those claims. Despite Torsella's departure, Sestak continued to consider entering the race and began gaining support from the Democratic party's more liberal factions like the Progressive Change Campaign Committee, which began a [...] "Draft Sestak" [...] campaign fund. Sestak became further encouraged to run after taking a tour of all 67 Pennsylvania counties to meet with party leaders and discuss such issues as jobs, the economy and health care. Sestak said that the leaders voiced serious concerns to him about the direction of the country and, although his lack of name recognition was a problem, Sestak said many of the people he encountered voiced support for him.|$|E

2500|$|Yet despite Khrushchev's May 7 {{political}} trap, the Soviet premier still {{attempted to}} allow Eisenhower to save face, possibly {{to salvage the}} peace summit to some degree. Khrushchev specifically laid {{the blame for the}} U-2 not on Eisenhower himself, but on DCI Allen Dulles and the CIA. Khrushchev said that anyone wishing to understand the U-2's mission should [...] "seek a reply from Allen Dulles, at whose instructions the American aircraft flew over the Soviet Union." [...] On May 9, the Soviet premier told US ambassador Thompson that he [...] "could not help but suspect that someone had launched this operation with the deliberate intent of spoiling the summit meeting." [...] Thompson also wrote in his diplomatic cable that Khrushchev suspected it was Allen Dulles, and that Khrushchev had heard <b>about</b> <b>Senator</b> Mansfield's remarks that Eisenhower did not control his own administration.|$|E
2500|$|In {{addition}} to the three politicians arraigned on May 4, the new court filings mention illegal payments made to a former state senator, named as [...] "Senator B" [...] in court documents, who received over $200,000 from VECO Corp. over several years, income which Senator B reported as [...] "consulting fees." [...] In the May 7 guilty pleas by Allen and Smith, they admit that the only work done by Senator B {{in exchange for the}} funds was advancing VECO's agenda in the state legislature. The only former state senator who matches the information contained in court documents <b>about</b> <b>Senator</b> B is former Senator Ben Stevens (R-Anchorage), son of U.S. Senator Ted Stevens (R-Alaska). To date, Ben Stevens has not been indicted. Another state senator discussed in the court documents who later pleaded guilty, was identified as [...] "Senator A." [...] He was John Cowdery.
