5|$|The Deshastha Rigvedi Brahmins <b>are</b> <b>treated</b> <b>as</b> a {{separate}} and distinct caste from the Yajurvedi Madhyandina and Kannavas Brhamins by several authors, including Malhotra and Karve.|$|E
5|$|In practice, however, this {{restriction}} {{is often}} ignored {{and the two}} flags – with and without coat of arms – <b>are</b> <b>treated</b> <b>as</b> interchangeable. The variant with the coat of arms is particularly often used by the Polonia, or Polish diaspora outside Poland, especially in the United States.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, an {{independent}} trader, Cyrano Jones (Stanley Adams), arrives {{on the station}} with some tribbles. He gives one to Lt. Uhura (Nichelle Nichols), who brings it on board the Enterprise, where it and its quickly-produced offspring <b>are</b> <b>treated</b> <b>as</b> adorable pets. The animals purr a relaxing trill that the crew find soothing. Klingons, however, find tribbles annoying, and the feeling is mutual: tribbles hiss and shriek whenever they are near Klingons.|$|E

5|$|Mrs. Tittlemouse {{is a tale}} {{in which}} no humans play a part and one in which events <b>are</b> <b>treated</b> <b>as</b> though they have {{occurred}} since time immemorial and far from human observance. It is a simple story, and one likely to appeal to young children.|$|E
5|$|Other {{specific}} {{underlying causes}} <b>are</b> <b>treated</b> <b>as</b> normally. For example, hemochromatosis is treated by venesection, the regular {{removal of a}} fixed amount of blood. Eventually, this decreases the iron levels {{in the body and}} improves the function of the organs in which iron has accumulated.|$|E
5|$|Supporters of {{evolution}} have argued in response that no scientist's claims <b>are</b> <b>treated</b> <b>as</b> sacrosanct, {{as shown by}} the aspects of Darwin's theory that have been rejected or revised by scientists over the years to form first neo-Darwinism and later the modern evolutionary synthesis. The claim that evolution relies on faith is likewise rejected on the grounds that evolution has strong supporting evidence, and therefore does not require faith.|$|E
50|$|The {{relationships}} between Agriades franklinii and related species {{are not fully}} understood. Agriades franklinii <b>is</b> <b>treated</b> <b>as</b> a valid species or a subspecies of Agriades glandon.

5|$|Two other taxa that Czerkas and his co-authors named <b>were</b> later <b>treated</b> <b>as</b> junior {{synonyms}} {{by other}} authors. Czerkas' Cryptovolans <b>was</b> <b>treated</b> <b>as</b> Microraptor, and his Scansoriopteryx <b>was</b> <b>treated</b> <b>as</b> Epidendrosaurus. Czerkas described Omnivoropteryx, noting {{that it was}} similar to Sapeornis. Later specimens of Sapeornis with skulls demonstrated that the two were probably synonymous.|$|R

5|$|The main {{character}} is Pearl Penalosa, a Latina superhero in Spring City. The plot follows her and two superhero friends as {{they deal with}} celebrity and seek happy love lives after receiving predictions from a fortune teller. Traditional superhero themes such as fighting crime <b>are</b> <b>treated</b> <b>as</b> a background setting instead of a primary focus. Critics often drew comparisons to the television show Sex and the City.|$|E
5|$|Although {{ytterbium}} {{is fairly}} stable chemically, it {{is stored in}} airtight containers and in an inert atmosphere such as a nitrogen-filled dry box {{to protect it from}} air and moisture. All compounds of ytterbium <b>are</b> <b>treated</b> <b>as</b> highly toxic, although studies appear to indicate that the danger is minimal. However, ytterbium compounds cause irritation to human skin and eyes, and some might be teratogenic. Metallic ytterbium dust can spontaneously combust, and the resulting fumes are hazardous. Ytterbium fires cannot be extinguished using water, and only dry chemical class D fire extinguishers can extinguish the fires.|$|E
5|$|Capital {{within the}} EU may be {{transferred}} in any amount {{from one country}} to another. All intra-EU transfers in euro <b>are</b> <b>treated</b> <b>as</b> domestic transactions and bear the corresponding domestic transfer costs. This includes all member states of the EU, even those outside the eurozone providing the transactions are carried out in euro. Credit/debit card charging and ATM withdrawals within the eurozone are also treated as domestic transactions; however paper-based payment orders, like cheques, have not been standardised so these are still domestic-based. The ECB has also set up a clearing system, TARGET, for large euro transactions.|$|E

50|$|In the {{algebraic}} {{theory of}} linear signal processing, {{a set of}} filters <b>is</b> <b>treated</b> <b>as</b> an algebra {{and a set of}} signals <b>is</b> <b>treated</b> <b>as</b> a module and the z-transform is generalized to linear maps.|$|R
5|$|People {{displaced}} by the 2010 earthquake are at {{an increased risk of}} sex trafficking and forced labor. The international protections in place for the internally displaced, primarily the 1998 United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs Guiding Principles on Internal Displacement, do not apply to earthquake survivors who have crossed an international border. There is nothing protecting the externally displaced, which creates significant protection gaps for those most vulnerable to trafficking—girls and young women—who <b>are</b> <b>treated</b> <b>as</b> migration offenders rather than forced migrants in need of protection. No temporary protected status has been created or granted in the Dominican Republic.|$|E
5|$|Rival {{producers}} of Somali shillings emerged after 1991. These included the Na shilling, which failed to gain widespread acceptance, and the Balweyn I and II, which were forgeries of pre-1991 bank notes. A competition for seigniorage drove {{the value of}} the money down to about $0.04 per SoSh (1000) note, approximately the commodity cost. Consumers have refused to accept bills larger than the 1991 denominations, which has helped stop the devaluation from spiraling further. The pre-1991 notes and the subsequent forgeries <b>are</b> <b>treated</b> <b>as</b> the same currency. It takes large bundles to make cash purchases.|$|E
5|$|Swedish {{heraldry}} encompasses heraldic {{achievements in}} modern and historic Sweden. Swedish heraldic style {{is consistent with}} the German-Nordic heraldic tradition, noted for its multiple helmets and crests which <b>are</b> <b>treated</b> <b>as</b> inseparable from the shield, its repetition of colours and charges between the shield and the crest, and its scant use of heraldic furs. Because the medieval history of the Nordic countries was so closely related, their heraldic individuality developed rather late. Swedish and Finnish heraldry have a shared history prior to the Diet of Porvoo in 1809; these, together with Danish heraldry, were heavily influenced by German heraldry. Unlike the highly stylized and macaronic language of English blazon, Swedish heraldry is described in plain language, using (in most cases) only Swedish terminology.|$|E
50|$|Scopula sacraria <b>is</b> <b>treated</b> <b>as</b> a {{subspecies}} of Scopula confinaria by some authors. If sacraria <b>is</b> <b>treated</b> <b>as</b> a valid species, Scopula semitata {{is sometimes}} {{listed as a}} subspecies of it, rather than a separate species.|$|R
50|$|In {{the logic}} of prophetic {{self-declaration}}s, a genuine prophecy <b>is</b> <b>treated</b> <b>as</b> divine and infallible. A cessationist, thus, concludes that a prophetic self-declaration does not carry any weight if the spoken prophecy <b>is</b> <b>treated</b> <b>as</b> human and fallible.|$|R
50|$|The Sokoke bushy-tailed mongoose, Bdeogale omnivora, <b>is</b> {{sometimes}} <b>treated</b> <b>as</b> a subspecies of B. crassicauda, but <b>is</b> <b>treated</b> <b>as</b> {{a separate}} species by the IUCN.|$|R
5|$|Terns are seabirds in {{the family}} Laridae that have a {{worldwide}} distribution and are normally found near the sea, rivers, or wetlands. Terns <b>are</b> <b>treated</b> <b>as</b> a subgroup of the family Laridae which includes gulls and skimmers and consist of eleven genera. They are slender, lightly built birds with long, forked tails, narrow wings, long bills, and relatively short legs. Most species are pale grey above and white below, with a contrasting black cap to the head, but the marsh terns, the Inca tern, and some noddies have dark plumage for {{at least part of}} the year. The sexes are identical in appearance, but young birds are readily distinguishable from adults. Terns have a non-breeding plumage, which usually involves a white forehead and much-reduced black cap.|$|E
5|$|In {{the year}} ending March 31, 2014, the ACLU and the ACLU Foundation had a {{combined}} income from support and revenue of $100.4million, originating from grants (50.0%), membership donations (25.4%), donated legal services (7.6%), bequests (16.2%), and revenue (0.9%). Membership dues <b>are</b> <b>treated</b> <b>as</b> donations; members choose {{the amount they}} pay annually, averaging approximately $50 per member per year. In the year ending March 31, 2014, the combined expenses of the ACLU and ACLU Foundation were $133.4million, spent on programs (86.2%), management (7.4%), and fundraising (8.2%). (After factoring in other changes in net assets of +$30.9 million, from sources such as investment income, the organization had an overall decrease in net assets of $2.1 million.) Over the period from 2011 to 2014 the ACLU Foundation, on the average, has accounted for roughly 70% of the combined budget, and the ACLU roughly 30%.|$|E
5|$|Kant {{argued that}} {{rational}} beings {{can never be}} treated merely as means to ends; they must always also be treated as ends themselves, requiring that their own reasoned motives must be equally respected. This derives from Kant's claim that reason motivates morality: it demands that we respect reason as a motive in all beings, including other people. A rational being cannot rationally consent to being used merely {{as a means to}} an end, so they must always be treated as an end. Kant justified this by arguing that moral obligation is a rational necessity: that which is rationally willed is morally right. Because all rational agents rationally will themselves to be an end and never merely a means, it is morally obligatory that they <b>are</b> <b>treated</b> <b>as</b> such. This {{does not mean that we}} can never treat a human as a means to an end, but that when we do, we also treat him as an end in himself.|$|E
30|$|Note {{that when}} {{counting}} {{the number of}} sectors, if a_mn is a KC, it <b>is</b> <b>treated</b> <b>as</b> a KC in both sectors m and n. If m = n, a_mn <b>is</b> <b>treated</b> <b>as</b> 2 KCs in sector m (n).|$|R
