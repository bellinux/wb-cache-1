It produced advertisements, webpages, and podcasts in 2016 in support of California Proposition 67 for a statewide ban on single-use plastic grocery bags. The aquarium hosted a plastic pollution symposium through the Aquarium Conservation Partnership in December 2016, and, in July 2017, the aquarium <b>and</b> <b>other</b> <b>members</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> partnership began eliminating their own plastic products.|$|E
