5|$|Further {{methods of}} {{identification}} are chemical tests. With {{the application of}} FeSO4 to the cap cuticle (pileipellis), it will turn a dark grey, almost black color and with the application of potassium hydroxide or NH4OH it has a negative coloration. The context stains a bluish grey to an olive green when FeSO4 is applied to it, <b>a</b> <b>pale</b> orange to <b>a</b> <b>pale</b> yellow with the application of KOH, and negative with the application of NH4OH.|$|E
5|$|Cott {{describes}} simple experiments such as {{that fish}} that have changed colour to match <b>a</b> <b>pale</b> background survived better (64% to 42%) on such a background than fish which had not. He also quotes some anecdotal observations on wild animals with similar but not quantified results.|$|E
5|$|Females {{have the}} same plumage pattern as males, though with {{somewhat}} duller colouration. The female has a grey head; buff supercilium, chin, and throat; black and warm brown upperparts; and off-white underparts. The bill of the female is pale yellow with the tip and cutting edge of mandible dusky. Juveniles are dull grey with a brown back, <b>a</b> <b>pale</b> yellow supercilium, and <b>a</b> <b>pale</b> horn bill. Females and juveniles have hints of chestnut on their supercilium, shoulders, and throat, by which they may be distinguished from other sparrows, such as the Kenya sparrow and the other rufous sparrows, which are common {{in much of the}} chestnut sparrow's range; or the house sparrow, which also occurs in parts of its range.|$|E
5|$|Boletus edulis occurs {{later in}} the season during lower temperatures, mostly under Picea. It has <b>a</b> <b>paler</b> viscid cap, and <b>a</b> <b>paler</b> stipe with <b>an</b> acute white reticulation. Microscopically, it has gelatinised hyphal ends in the pileipellis.|$|R

5|$|Mycena mustea {{is another}} similar Mycena that was {{discovered}} and reported concurrently with M.fonticola; it differs in forming <b>a</b> <b>pale</b> grayish purple cap {{with a low}} and broad umbo.

5|$|The body is <b>a</b> <b>pale</b> {{brown or}} silvery brown colour, {{transitioning}} to white below, with green, mauve and rosy reflections {{when the fish}} is first removed from the water. An indistinct silver-yellow mid-lateral band extends across some specimens. The spinous dorsal fin is olive green with faint darker blotches, the second dorsal fin also <b>a</b> <b>pale</b> olive with rows of dark brown to blackish spots. The anal and ventral fins are pale yellow, the pectorals are pale yellow to pale brown with a well defined dark blue-black blotch at the base. The caudal fin is yellow to olive in colour with darker margins. Juveniles less than 90mm may have darker blotches along their sides and backs.|$|E
5|$|The {{only other}} Phallus species known with a pinkish-colored cap is P.rubicundus; its conical cap has a surface that is wrinkled, not reticulate. Other similar species include P.hadriani, {{which has a}} purple volva, P.macrosporus, which has a reddish volva, and P.formanosus, which has <b>a</b> <b>pale</b> pink stipe and volva.|$|E

5|$|Actinium is a soft, silvery-white, radioactive, {{metallic}} element. Its estimated {{shear modulus}} {{is similar to}} that of lead. Owing to its strong radioactivity, actinium glows in the dark with <b>a</b> <b>pale</b> blue light, which originates from the surrounding air ionized by the emitted energetic particles. Actinium has similar chemical properties to lanthanum and other lanthanides, and therefore these elements are difficult to separate when extracting from uranium ores. Solvent extraction and ion chromatography are commonly used for the separation.|$|E
5|$|Beer colour is {{determined}} by the malt. The most common colour is <b>a</b> <b>pale</b> amber produced from using pale malts. Pale lager and pale ale are terms used for beers made from malt dried with the fuel coke.

5|$|Boletus reticulatus is {{very similar}} to B.aereus, also {{occurring}} during the summer months under broad-leaved trees.

5|$|Dark beers {{are usually}} brewed from <b>a</b> <b>pale</b> malt or lager malt base {{with a small}} {{proportion}} of darker malt added to achieve the desired shade. Other colourants—such as caramel—are also widely used to darken beers. Very dark beers, such as stout, use dark or patent malts that have been roasted longer. Some have roasted unmalted barley.|$|E

Widgiemoolthalite is transparent in hand sample with a silky luster and <b>a</b> <b>pale</b> bluish-green streak. The mineral is brittle and breaks along its fiber contacts. Its observed specific gravity is 3.13 while its calculated specific gravity is 3.24, with a hardness of 3.5 on the Mohs scale.|$|E
5|$|Immature red wattlebirds are {{generally}} less flamboyant. Juveniles have much less prominent wattles, brown irises, <b>a</b> <b>pale</b> crown {{and much less}} yellow on the belly.

First immature birds are more similar to adults overall, having red irises with brown rings, wattles larger but still smaller than adults, and a greyish pink gape.|$|E
