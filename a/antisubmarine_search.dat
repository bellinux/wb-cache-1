5000|$|... 38-593 - Pima Air & Space Museum {{adjacent}} to Davis-Monthan Air Force Base in Tucson, Arizona. This Bolo spent {{the early part}} of WWII on anti-submarine patrol. In 1943 began use a light transport. She was retired and struck from the inventory in 1945. Was operated as a firebomber as N66267, 1954-1970. In storage at Phoenix Goodyear Airport, Litchfield Park, Arizona by September 1969, then delivered to Pima on 5 September 1976. The aircraft sat outside in the desert for many years before being restored and moved indoors for display. The aircraft is still equipped with an <b>antisubmarine</b> <b>search</b> radar dome.|$|E
5000|$|The {{destroyer}} escort arrived Subic Bay, Philippines on 22 May 1945 {{to join a}} hunter-killer group. In June and July she {{trained with}} American and British submarines and carried out <b>antisubmarine</b> <b>searches</b> {{in preparation for the}} eventual invasion of Japan.|$|R
50|$|On 30 May 1945, half Moon got {{underway}} for the Philippines again, {{arriving at}} Tawi Tawi in the Sulu Archipelago on 11 June 1945. She supported seaplane <b>antisubmarine</b> <b>searches</b> from Tawi Tawi Bay until early August 1945, and then {{carried out the}} same mission from Mangarin Bay on Mindoro.|$|R
50|$|From 1 through 21 March, Woodworth {{conducted}} training exercises, escort missions, <b>antisubmarine</b> <b>searches,</b> and barge-hunting operations {{throughout the}} Solomon Islands. She fired at enemy positions and encountered no opposition. Woodworth departed Port Purvis with Buchanan on 22 March, bound for Pearl Harbor. She joined TG 35.6 with a merchant convoy of five ships off Guadalcanal {{and proceeded to}} Hawaii with it. On 9 April, Woodworth cleared Pearl Harbor and steamed to San Francisco. She was drydocked at the Mare Island Navy Yard on 15 April 1944.|$|R

50|$|Five Avro Anson, one Dornier Do 22 {{and three}} Avro 626 escaped. Hellenic {{aviation}} was rebuilt under the Air Force Ministry based in Cairo. Three Hellenic squadrons were built, which were {{operating under the}} command of the British RAF. These squadrons were the 13th Light Bombing Squadron, with Avro Ansons, Bristol Blenheims and Martin Baltimores, and the 335 and 336 Fighting Squadrons, with Hawker Hurricane I and IIs and Spitfire V types. The Hellenic Squadrons in the Middle East took over a variety of missions, such as convoy patrols, <b>antisubmarine</b> <b>search,</b> offensive patrols, reconnaissance, attacks and interceptions of enemy aircraft. In summer 1943 the Greek Squadrons participated in the attack against the German Wehrmacht on the island of Crete. From May to November 1944 the Greek squadrons continued in Italy. Greek pilots operated with great success. Two of those pilots were Pilot Officer G. Tsotsos and Master Sergeant D. Soufrillas flying Spitfires credited with shooting down German Junkers 88 bombers. Seventy men were lost.|$|E
50|$|On 17 July, the {{minesweeper}} {{was attached}} to a convoy of LST's and preceded to a rendezvous point just south of Guam for the impending amphibious assault on that island. The minesweeper was then assigned patrol duties in the transport screen off Orote Point. On 28 July, Spear had to maneuver to avoid enemy shellfire from the beach. During {{the remainder of the}} campaign, she escorted oilers on their nightly retirement from the assault area and conducted <b>antisubmarine</b> <b>searches.</b> She then returned to Pearl Harbor and resumed escort trips to advance bases.|$|R
50|$|Tingey {{spent the}} first six months of 1952 in San Diego; then steamed on 11 July, via Midway and Pearl Harbor, toward Korea. On 13 August, Tingey was again off the east coast of Korea {{providing}} gunfire support for ROK forces ashore. She also engaged in <b>antisubmarine</b> <b>searches</b> and conducted night patrols between Nan Do and the Korean peninsula. During this six-month tour off Korea, Tingey completed successful fire missions on enemy troops, railroads, and gun and mortar positions. She departed Korea on 26 January 1953 and arrived at San Diego on 16 February.|$|R
50|$|Arriving {{back in the}} Ryūkyūs on 17 April, the {{destroyer}} escort {{spent the next two}} months performing a variety of services in support of the campaign to wrest Okinawa from the Japanese. During that period, anti-air defense proved to be the most pressing problem. Enemy air power in the form of both kamikaze and conventional raids tested the Navy's endurance nearly to the limit. Ships such as Abercrombie patrolling the radar picket stations surrounding Okinawa provided early warnings of incoming air raids and bore the brunt of those onslaughts. The destroyer escort tangled with Japanese planes on at least 16 separate occasions, claiming two definite kills and two assists. When not standing watch on a radar picket station, Abercrombie conducted <b>antisubmarine</b> <b>searches,</b> rescued downed American airmen, and provided escort services to a variety of ships.|$|R
40|$|We {{develop some}} two-person zero-sum game {{formulations}} of search and evasion problems. By employing a game theoretic approach, we allow the hider, {{as well as}} the searcher, to choose a strategy. This is in contrast to most search models which assume a stationary or passive hider.

The sequential games con-sist of a sequence of moves. When the players move, they not only de-termine a payoff but also the probability that the game terminates before the next move. When at most a finite number of moves is allowed, we prove that a solution may be found by solving a recursive sequence of matrix games.

50|$|The {{destroyer}} sailed 3 {{days later}} {{for the air}} raids on Rabaul of 11 November, in coordination with the Bougainville landings. After the first successful strike launched by the carriers, enemy planes came swarming out to seek vengeance, and a furious 46-minute action, during which Chaunceys guns blazed almost continuously, resulted in {{a large number of}} splashed Japanese aircraft. Chauncey, continuing to screen the same carrier force, now sailed north to begin the preassault air strikes on Tarawa, 18, 19, and 20 November. As the landings began on 20 November, the carriers launched combat air patrol, <b>antisubmarine</b> <b>searches,</b> and close support strikes, which continued until the island was secured after furious fighting ashore. During this operation, Chauncey again helped drive a Japanese counterattack from the air above the ships she guarded.|$|R
50|$|Farragut put to sea, from San Diego 19 October 1943, {{bound for}} {{training}} in the Hawaiian Islands and at Espiritu Santo. Again guarding carriers, she {{took part in the}} air operations covering the landings on Tarawa 20 November, and screened the carriers until the task force shaped course for Pearl Harbor 8 December. The destroyer continued on to the west coast for a brief repair period and training, sailing from San Diego 13 January 1944 for action in the Marshall Islands. During the assaults on Kwajalein and Eniwetok, she screened carriers, patrolled, and conducted <b>antisubmarine</b> <b>searches,</b> then sailed for air strikes on Woleai and Wakde. Late in April, she was off New Guinea as the carriers supported the landings in the Hollandia (currently known as Jayapura) area, and through May joined in training operations out of Majuro.|$|R
5000|$|... 1 Jan-1 Feb 1943: A {{detachment}} of 6 aircraft from the squadron {{were sent to}} Kanton Island, in the Phoenix Islands, for <b>antisubmarine</b> defense and <b>search</b> missions.|$|R
50|$|After the Pearl Harbor Attack and the United States {{entry into}} World War II, the Air Force's {{use of the}} airport changed to being a base for antisubmarine patrols, with the airport {{becoming}} the Headquarters, for the 26th Antisubmarine Wing of the Army Air Forces Antisubmarine Command (AAFAC) from 20 November 1942 - 15 October 1943. The AAFAC flew <b>antisubmarine</b> patrols, <b>searching</b> for and attacking German U-Boats from the airport using B-18 Bolo and B-24 Liberator bombers specially equipped with radar.|$|R
5000|$|Following {{her support}} of this {{scientific}} endeavor, Haverfield conducted <b>antisubmarine</b> and <b>search</b> and rescue patrols among the Bonins, the Marianas, and the Caroline Islands. For almost five years she served primarily in the Trust Territory of the Pacific, though twice she deployed to the Far East. Steaming to Japan in October 1960, {{she became the first}} radar picket escort ship to operate with the U.S. 7th Fleet in the Western Pacific. In mid-October 1961 she returned to the Far East; and, upon relieving [...] on patrol in the Formosa Strait, she became the first of her type to join in this important peace-keeping operation. She continued intermittent patrols off Taiwan until 10 January 1962 when she steamed via Japan to resume patrol duty out of Guam. In November 1961, Typhoon Karen left widespread destruction on Guam and Haverfield, the first ship to return to storm-wracked Apra Harbor, provided valuable supplies and services in the relief and recovery effort.|$|R
50|$|Hamlin sailed on 23 March from Saipan for Okinawa, {{the first}} step prior to the home islands in the long {{campaign}} across the Pacific. Her commander was designated Commander, Seaplane Base Group. The tenders arrived Kerama Retto, west of Okinawa, 28 March, the day after it had been secured and 4 days before the main landings on Okinawa. During the operation, Hamlin's planes provided long-range <b>search,</b> <b>antisubmarine</b> patrols, and air-sea rescue services, even providing aviation gasoline and luboil to battleships and cruisers. Her work was performed amid nearly constant air attack by Japanese suicide planes, and, though many ships in the anchorage were damaged by repeated attacks, Hamlin fought off all attacks without injury.|$|R
5000|$|Returning to {{the patrol}} area {{after a brief}} stay at Eniwetok, Hoggatt Bay's group {{provided}} air support and cover for the Marianas operation from 5 July-9 August, after which the ships returned to Manus Island. Next on the timetable of Pacific conquest was Peleliu, a valuable air base for further advances, and Hoggatt Bay sortied 1 September to furnish <b>antisubmarine</b> protection and <b>search</b> planes for the invasion. For nearly two months the escort carrier cruised these seas south and west of the Marianas in support of American operations. , a member of her group, sank [...] on 3 October, {{and later in the}} month planes from Hoggatt Bay helped provide air cover for [...] as she struggled toward Ulithi.|$|R
50|$|Casco {{returned}} to {{duty in the}} Aleutian Islands in March 1943, operating at Constantine Harbor, Amchitka, as tender to Fleet Air Wing Four (FAW-4). In May 1943 she moved to Attu, {{to care for the}} seaplanes conducting <b>antisubmarine</b> patrol and <b>search</b> missions in support of the United States Army's invasion of Attu, guarding against further Japanese reinforcement or penetration of the Aleutians. Cascos service in these waters where weather was often as formidable an enemy as the Japanese ended in November 1943, when she left for overhaul at Puget Sound Navy Yard. During one of her stays in the Aleutians, an OS2U Kingfisher from the Casco was borrowed by Colonel William O. Eareckson for use as a forward air control aircraft, which personally flew on numerous missions.|$|R
5000|$|On {{deployed}} {{aircraft carriers}} underway, in between routine flight operations in regions where flyovers by potentially hostile aircraft were possible, {{two to four}} Navy and/or embarked Marine Corps fighter aircraft would be placed on or {{in the vicinity of}} catapults, armed, manned and ready to launch within 5 minutes of notification. This was characterized during the 1960s to present day by F-8 Crusader aircraft, followed by the F-4 Phantom II, the F-14 Tomcat, and today by the F/A-18 Hornet and F/A-18 Super Hornet. This [...] "Ready Five" [...] alert was augmented by a Ready 15 alert of pre-flighted, armed, but unmanned aircraft near the catapults with the pilot or crew standing by in the squadron's ready room, ostensibly able to launch within 15 minutes. Alert flight crews for airborne early warning, fixed-wing and rotary-wing <b>antisubmarine</b> warfare, and <b>search</b> and rescue helicopters were similarly established as required, typically in a Ready 15 or Ready 30 mode. This model was employed during the Cold War and continues to be employed to this day, especially when aircraft carriers and their strike groups are operating in areas of increased international tension.|$|R
