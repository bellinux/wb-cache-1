2500|$|Fresh pastas do not {{expand in}} size after cooking; therefore, [...] of pasta {{are needed to}} serve four people generously. Fresh egg pasta is {{generally}} cut into strands of various widths and thicknesses depending on which pasta is to be made (e.g. fettuccine, pappardelle, and lasagne). It is best served with meat, cheese, or vegetables to create ravioli, tortellini, and cannelloni. Fresh egg pasta {{is well known in}} the Piedmont region and Emilia Romagna region in North Italy. In this area, dough is only made out of egg yolk and flour resulting in a very refined flavour and texture. This pasta is often served simply with butter sauce <b>and</b> <b>thinly</b> <b>sliced</b> truffles that are native to this region. In other areas, such as Apulia fresh pasta can be made without eggs. The only ingredients needed to make the pasta dough are semolina flour and water, which is often shaped into orecchiette or cavatelli. Fresh pasta for cavatelli is also popular in other places including Sicily. However, the dough is prepared differently: it is made of flour and ricotta cheese instead.|$|E

5000|$|During {{the time}} of the Qin (221-206 BC) and Han Dynasties (206 BC-220 AD) kuai made from the meat of land fauna became less popular with the term used to refer more <b>and</b> more to <b>thinly</b> <b>slice</b> raw fish. The dish was widely {{consumed}} by all classes and coincides with the appearance of the character [...] "鱠" [...] (kuai) with its fish radical (魚) during this period (alongside the character 膾 with the [...] "" [...] meat radical). In addition, characters such as [...] "燴" [...] (kuai) with the fire radical were introduced to indicate fish that has grilled to the rare stage <b>and</b> then <b>thinly</b> <b>sliced,</b> similar to Japanese Tataki. Indeed, kuai and raw fish were so commonly consumed that Ying Shao(應劭) in his Fengsu TongYi (風俗通義), a manuscript that described the odd and exotic practices of various cultures and peoples, stated that [...] "In Zhu-A, raw fish is not consumed" [...] (祝、阿不食生魚, chap. 釋忌), alluding to the perceived oddity of not eating fish raw. It is also during this period that the renowned dish jinji yukuai (金齏玉膾) along its accompanying baheji sauce (八和齏) was created (齊民要術 Qi Min Yao Shu, scroll 8).|$|R
50|$|Unique to Laos is the Lao use {{of fresh}} lettuce with raw, <b>thinly</b> <b>sliced</b> {{tomatoes}} as toppings in Lao noodle soups such as feu, which gives feu a Lao style jolt {{of color and}} freshness. The liberal use of fried garlic as a topping to the dish is also common in Laos. Mint leaves and Asian basil leaves may also be added {{on top of the}} sliced tomatoes or alongside them to give an additional contrast in shape, texture, and color as the Lao are known for their use of contrasting elements in their cuisine. Fresh cilantro <b>and</b> also <b>thinly</b> <b>sliced</b> green onions <b>and</b> white onions are also added as toppings. Fresh bean sprouts may also be added as a topping as is commonly done for another Lao noodle dish called khao poon.|$|R

5000|$|Chāhan (炒飯 or チャーハン) is {{sometimes}} called [...] "yakimeshi," [...] literally meaning Fried rice. It {{is very different from}} fried rice found in American Chinese or authentic Chinese restaurants, as it uses Japanese short-grain rice, which generally has a stickier consistency than that used in other countries. Additionally, though there are many different recipes using such diverse ingredients as Welsh onion, ground pork, crab, bamboo shoots, the classic Japanese fried rice does not use soy sauce, remaining white when served. It typically uses egg, green peas, <b>and</b> <b>thinly</b> <b>sliced</b> ham.|$|E
5000|$|Australian {{sausages}} {{have traditionally}} been made with beef, pork and chicken, while recently game meats such as kangaroo have been used that typically have much less fat. English style sausages, known colloquially as [...] "snags", come in two varieties: thin, that resemble an English 'breakfast' sausage, and thick, known as 'Merryland' in South Australia. These types of sausage are popular at barbecues, and can be purchased from any butcher or supermarket. Devon is a spiced pork sausage similar to Bologna sausage and Gelbwurst. It is usually made in a large diameter, <b>and</b> often <b>thinly</b> <b>sliced</b> <b>and</b> eaten cold in sandwiches.|$|R
5000|$|Food critic Mike Sula {{described}} the bún mắm in a restaurant, Nha Hang Viet Nam, in Chicago's West Argyle Street Historic District (also known as Little Vietnam): [...] "I recommend you fill your soup requirement with the bun mam, a.k.a. Vietnamese gumbo, a sour seafood soup not unlike Thai tom yam that {{originated in the}} Mekong Delta. It may not best the bowl you'd cool down with in the sweltering damp of Saigon's Ben Thanh market—that one incorporates pork too—but it's a solid one, brimming with eggplant, shrimp, squid, <b>and</b> silky, <b>thinly</b> <b>sliced</b> fish, accompanied by a heaping side of bean sprouts, cilantro, mint, and jalapeños." ...|$|R
5000|$|Duck rice (...) , braised duck {{served with}} rice cooked with yam and shrimp.

Teochew boneless duck rice is a similar, but a more refined dish. The duck is deboned <b>and</b> <b>sliced</b> <b>thinly,</b> allowing the sauces to seep into the meat.|$|R
5000|$|While {{there is}} some debate as to the {{contents}} of a [...] "true" [...] Cuban sandwich, most are generally agreed upon. The traditional Cuban sandwich starts with Cuban bread. The loaf is sliced into lengths of 8-12 inches (20-30 cm), lightly buttered or brushed with olive oil on the crust, and cut in half horizontally. A coat of yellow mustard is spread on the bread. Then sliced roast pork, glazed ham, Swiss cheese, <b>and</b> <b>thinly</b> <b>sliced</b> dill pickles are added in layers. Sometimes the pork is marinated in mojo and slow roasted.|$|E
50|$|Melba toast is a dry, crisp <b>and</b> <b>thinly</b> <b>sliced</b> toast, often {{served with}} soup and salad or topped with either melted cheese or pâté. It {{is named after}} Dame Nellie Melba, the stage name of Australian opera singer Helen Porter Mitchell. Its name is thought to date from 1897, when the singer was very ill {{and it became a}} staple of her diet. The toast was created for her by chef and fan Auguste Escoffier, who also created the Peach Melba dessert for her. The hotel {{proprietor}} César Ritz supposedly named it in a conversation with Escoffier.|$|E
50|$|Bacon {{is defined}} as any of certain cuts of meat taken from the sides, belly or back that have been cured or smoked. In {{continental}} Europe, it is used primarily in cubes (lardons) as a cooking ingredient valued both {{as a source of}} fat and for its flavour. In Italy, besides being used in cooking, bacon (pancetta) is also served uncooked <b>and</b> <b>thinly</b> <b>sliced</b> as part of an antipasto. Bacon is also used for barding roasts, especially game birds. Bacon is often smoked, using various types of wood, a process which can take up to ten hours. Bacon may be eaten fried, baked, or grilled.|$|E
500|$|Both {{schools of}} thought in New York agreed that eating with one's fingers and not being afraid to get messy were {{integral}} {{to the culture of}} the beefsteak. No matter which type of beefsteak a diner attended, the main course was beef loin dipped in butter-based sauce <b>and</b> served <b>thinly</b> <b>sliced</b> on rounds of bread (day-old bread, at East Side beefsteaks; fresh toast, at West Side). Napkins were considered unnecessary; diners generally wore aprons with which they could wipe the grease off their hands. Food was dispatched from the kitchen laid out on trays and waiters continued bringing out trays until diners could literally eat no more (In his New Yorker article, Joseph Mitchell quotes one man as saying, [...] "I'm so full I'm about to pop. Push those kidneys a little nearer, if you don't mind."). Beer flowed freely during banquets in pre-prohibition years.|$|R
50|$|Abalones {{are first}} {{prepared}} by cleaning {{with a brush}} in water, and the flesh is taken out from the flat and middle of the shells with a small kitchen knife. The internal organs are removed separately from the flesh (taking care not to damage them). The flesh is slightly parboiled in a {{pot of boiling water}} <b>and</b> then <b>thinly</b> <b>sliced.</b> Rice is soaked in a bowl of water 3 to 4 hours before cooking. The abalone flesh is stir-fried on a pot over a mid-flame with sesame oil, with the soaked rice then added. After stir frying for a while, water is poured into the pot and the dish is cooked at a higher temperature. Constant stirring prevents the ingredients from sticking {{to the bottom of the}} pot. After the dish has come to a boil, the heat is lowered and let to simmer. The dish is seasoned with salt or ganjang (Korean soy sauce).|$|R
5000|$|Rullepølse ( [...] , rolled sausage), also spelled Rullepoelse or Rullepolse, is a {{traditional}} Danish cold cut. A piece of pork belly—variants use beef flank or lamb—is flattened out and is spread with herbs and seasoning (salt, pepper, allspice), chopped onions and, in some variants, parsley. It is then rolled up {{and placed in a}} brine for a number of days, before being placed in a special press, cooled, <b>and</b> <b>sliced</b> <b>thinly.</b> [...] It is often use on rugbrød to make the traditional Danish open-faced sandwich, smørrebrød, usually garnished with a thick slice of sky and rings of raw onion.|$|R
