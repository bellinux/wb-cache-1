Her descendants followed her example and continued reforming the empire. The <b>acquisition</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Kingdom of Galicia and Lodomeria gave the empire an even more multinational character that would ultimately lead to its destruction. Her introduction of compulsory schooling, as a means of Germanisation, eventually triggered the revival of Czech culture.|$|E
