40|$|Radiation-induced lung injury (RILI) is a {{potentially}} fatal and dose-limiting complication of thoracic radiotherapy. This {{study was to}} investigate the protective effects of grape seed pro-anthocyanidins (GSPs), an efficient antioxidant and <b>anti-carcinogenic</b> <b>agent,</b> on RILI. In our study, it was demonstrated that acute and late RILI was ameliorated after GSPs treatment possibly through suppressing TGF-b 1 /Smad 3 /Snail signalling pathway and modulating the levels of cytokines (interferon-c, IL- 4 and IL- 13) derived from Th 1 /Th 2 cells. In addition, a sustained high level of PGE 2 was also maintained by GSPs treatment to limited fibroblast functions. As shown by electron spin resonance spectrometry, GSPs could scavenge hydroxyl radical (•OH) in a dose-dependent manner, which might account for the mitigation of lipid peroxidation and consequent apoptosis of lung cells. In vitro, GSPs radiosensitized lung cancer cell A 549 while mitigating radiation injury on normal alveolar epithelial cell RLE- 6 TN. In conclusion, the results showed that GSPs protects mice from RILI through scavenging free radicals and modulating RILI-associ-ated cytokines, suggesting GSPs as a novel protective agent in RILI...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. To {{investigate}} {{the effects of}} Hu Qisan (HQS) on apoptosis in diethylnitrosamine (DEN) -induced hepatocel-lular carcinoma (HCC), a Solt-Farber two-step test model of precancerous liver lesions was established in rats using a previously described method. HQS (4 and 8 g/kg body weight/day) was administered for 4 weeks, after {{the majority of the}} liver was removed. HepG 2 cells were used to detect the HtrA serine peptidase 2 (HtrA 2 /Omi) release from mitochon-dria and caspase- 3 activation promoted by HQS. Exposure of the rats to DEN for 6 weeks induced hepatic carcinogenesis. HQS (4 and 8 g/kg body weight/day) markedly induced cell apoptosis. The protective effects against hepatic carcinogen-esis were mediated by multiple mechanisms, including the reduction of DEN-induced γ-GT-positive cell proliferation, mitochondrial morphological changes, HtrA 2 /Omi release from mitochondria and the activation of caspase- 3. In conclusion, HQS is a potential <b>anti-carcinogenic</b> <b>agent</b> that may induce apoptosis by reducing the inhibitory effects of X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein (XIAP) on caspase- 3. Thus, HQS should be further explored as a potentially prom-ising new therapeutic agent against human hepatic cancer...|$|E
40|$|Phytochemicals are dietary phytoestrogens {{that may}} play a role in {{prostate}} cancer prevention. Forty percent of Americans use complementary and alternative medicines (CAM) for disease prevention and therapy. Ashwagandha (Withania somnifera) contains flavonoids and active ingredients like alkaloids and steroidal lactones which are called ‘Withanolides’. We hypothesize that the immunomodulatory and anti-inflammatory properties of Ashwagandha might contribute to its overall effectiveness as an <b>anti-carcinogenic</b> <b>agent.</b> The goal of our study was gain insight into the general biological and molecular functions and immunomodulatory processes that are altered as a result of Ashwagandha treatment in prostate cancer cells, and to identify the key signaling mechanisms that are involved in the regulation of these physiological effects using genomic microarray analysis in conjunction with quantitative real-time PCR and western blot analysis. Ashwagandha treatment significantly downregulated the gene and protein expression of proinflammatory cytokines IL- 6, IL- 1 b, chemokine IL- 8, Hsp 70 and STAT- 2, while a reciprocal upregulation was observed in gene and protein expression of p 38 MAPK, PI 3 K, caspase 6, Cyclin D and c-myc.

40|$|IN 1945, Lacassagne, Buu-Hoi and Rudali {{reported}} that several weakly carcinogenic substances when painted on mouse skin alternately with 20 -methylcholanthrene reduced {{the ability of}} the latter substance to produce tumours. This anti-carcinogenic effect was attributed to competition between the weak and strong carcinogens for some substrate within the cell because of their analogous structure. In the following year, Crabtree (1946) showed that the non-carcinogenic hydrocarbons, anthracene, naphthalene and especially phenanthrene possessed anti-carcinogenic activity when tested in multiple applications against 3, 4 -benzopyrene and 20 -methylcholanthrene on the skin of mice. Investigations reported by Riegel et al. (1951) using 20 -methyleholanthrene and by Hill et al. (1951) using 9, 10 -dimethyl- 1, 2 -benzanthracene showed that several hydrocarbons depressed carcinogenic potency but others enhanced it. In all of the above studies multiple applications of the hydrocarbons were used, thus making it difficult to decide at what stage in the process of tumour production the effect of the <b>anti-carcinogenic</b> <b>agent</b> was exerted. We tried to simplify the experiment by testing the effect of a single application of phenanthrene on the yield of tumours induced by a single application of 9, 10 -dimethyl- 1, 2 -benzanthracene (DMBA) and multiple applications of croton oil.

40|$|Objective. Curcuma longa (C. longa) {{was used}} in some {{countries}} such as China and India for various medicinal purposes. Curcumin, the active component of C. longa, is commonly used as a coloring agent in foods, drugs, and cosmetics. C. longa and curcumin {{have been known to}} act as antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, anti-mutagen, and <b>anti-carcinogenic</b> <b>agents.</b> Th e attempt of the present review was to give an effort on a detailed literature survey concentrated on the protective effects of C. longa and curcumin on the reproductive organs activity. Methods. The databases such as, PubMed, Web of Science, Google Scholar, Scopus, and Iran- Medex, were considered. The search terms were “testis” or “ovary” and “Curcuma longa”, “curcumin”, “antioxidant effect”, “anti-inflammatory effect” and “anti-cancer effect”. Results. C. longa and curcumin inhibited the production of the tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and prostaglandin E 2 (PGE 2) and increased the caspases (3, 8 and 9) activities in HL- 60 prostate cancer. Furthermore, C. longa and curcumin suppressed the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), phosphorylated signal transducers and activators of the transcription 3 (STAT) and matrix metalloproteinase- 9 (MMP- 9) in ovarian cancer cell line. Conclusion. C. longa and curcumin might decrease the risk of cancer and other malignant diseases in the reproductive system. C. longa and curcumin have a protective effect on the reproductive organs activity such as, anti-inflammatory, anti-apoptotic, and antioxidant effects in normal cells but showed pro-apoptotic effects in the malignant cells. Therefore, different effects of C. longa and curcumin are dependent on the doses and the type of cells used in various models studied...|$|R

Results of enzyme kinetics revealed that curcumin, compared to the polyphenols quercetin, myricetin, kaempferol, luteolin and rutin, elicited a stronger competitive inhibitory effect on Glo 1 (K(i) = 5. 1 +/- 1. 4 microM). Applying a whole blood assay, IC(50) values of pro-inflammatory cytokine release (TNF-alpha, IL- 6, IL- 8, IL- 1 beta) were found to be positively correlated with the K(i) -values of the aforementioned polyphenols. Moreover, whereas curcumin was found to hamper the growth of breast cancer (JIMT- 1, MDA-MB- 231), prostate cancer PC- 3 and brain astrocytoma 1321 N 1 cells, no effect on growth or vitality of human primary hepatocytes was elucidated. Curcumin decreased D-lactate release by tumor cells, another clue for inhibition of intracellular Glo 1. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: The results described herein provide new insights into curcumin's biological activities as they indicate that inhibition of Glo 1 by curcumin may result in non-tolerable levels of MGO and GSH, which, in turn, modulate various metabolic cellular pathways including depletion of cellular ATP and GSH content. This may account for curcumin's potency as an anti-inflammatory and anti-tumor agent. The findings support the use of curcumin as a potential therapeutic agent...|$|R

The natural dietary sources for CLA are dairy products and meats. CLA has received {{a great deal of attention}} as a potential anti-obesity, <b>anti-carcinogenic,</b> and anti-atherosclerotic <b>agent.</b> The purpose of this study was to examine various adiposity effects of CLA supplementation in combination with two types of high-fat diets, using weanling pigs as a model. Sorghum-based diets were supplemented with either 15 % beef tallow or corn oil, or 12 % tallow or corn oil plus 3 % CLA. Six pigs were assigned to each diet group, with the feeding trial lasting 35 days. Weights of tissue components from dissected rib sections displayed no differences between diets. Adipose tissue cellularity measures from two sites in the rib sections showed significant differences, but there were no dietary effects except in cell density and estimated total adipocytes per rib section, where tallow + CLA-fed pigs had significantly more cells than both corn-oil-fed groups. CLA intake caused significant accumulation of CLA in membrane, microsome, and storage subcellular compartments in both adipose and muscle tissue, with the microsomes containing the least CLA. There were significant modifications to percentages of total fatty acids. Reductions in total monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA) with CLA intake were similar to actual dietary intake due to dilution of MUFA by CLA. Total saturated fatty acids (SFA) were increased by CLA. The resulting MUFA/SFA ratio dropped 23 % in tallow-fed and 34 % in corn-oil-fed pigs when CLA was present (tallow: 0. 83; tallow + CLA: 0. 64; corn oil: 0. 91; corn oil + CLA: 0. 60). In conclusion, these results disagree with body composition changes reported in numerous studies in many animal species. Our data are substantially similar to changes in fatty acid distributions found in many of these studies. Additionally, we did not find enrichment of CLA in adipose and muscle microsomes relative to the membrane or storage subfractions...|$|R

When C 6 rat glioma cells were exposed to arsenite (100 μM for 1 h), CdCl 2 (100 μM for 1 h) or heat (42 °C for 30 min) in the presence of 3 – 10 μM curcumin, induction of the synthesis of all three proteins was markedly stimulated, as detected by specific immunoassays, Western blot analysis and Northern blot analysis. A gel mobility shift assay revealed that curcuminprolonged the stress-induced activation of the heat shock element-binding (HSE-binding) activity of heat shock transcription factor (Hsf) in the cultured cells. The stimulatory effect of curcumin on the responses to stress was also observed in BRL- 3 A rat liver cells and Swiss 3 T 3 mouse fibroblasts. Induction of Hsp 27, αB crystallin and Hsp 70 in the liver and adrenal glands of heat-stressed (42 °C for 20 min) rats was also enhanced by prior injection of curcumin (20 mg/kg body weight).

In Hungary, horseradish has been cultivated and used extensively in food industry, as well as in traditional medicine. Characteristic smell, taste and possible pharmacological effects comes from the plant' s essential oil. Developing essential oil extracting technology is not only proved to be useful for economical purpose, but also for scientific research due to the high content of isothiocyanate, a potential <b>anti-carcinogenic</b> <b>agent</b> present in the essential oil. Therefore, this study starts with the development of oil extracting technology, first in laboratory-scaled and then medium-scaled distillation. The efficiency of the new technology is taken under investigation by examining the yield of extracted oil, the completion of extraction process and the quality (content) of essential oil. Although there have been studies on horseradish’s isothiocyanates content, at the moment of this study, there has been no analytical investigation on neither isothiocyanate, glucosinolate profile nor the enzymatic activities in horseradish cultivated in Hungary. The analytical study starts with gas chromatography and mass spectrometry analysis on horseradish essential oil in order to reveal the full profile of horseradish isothiocyanates, which was compared to data collected from literature after for checking the quality of the extracted oil. The second part of the analytical study concentrates on development of the novel capillary electrophoresis method for instantly separation and detection of isothiocyanates and their parent molecules (glucosinolates) as well as revealing activity of myrosinase enzyme on the conversion of glucosinolates into isothiocyanate.
