5|$|At {{the start}} of the 20th century the District and Metropolitan {{railways}} faced increased competition in central London from new, electric, deep-level tube lines. The City & South London Railway had been a great success when it opened in 1890. After the opening of the Central London Railway in 1900 from Shepherd's Bush to the City with a flat rate fare of 2d, the District and Metropolitan together lost four million passengers between the second half of 1899 and the second half of 1900. The use of steam propulsion led to smoke-filled stations and carriages that were unpopular with passengers and electrification was seen as the way forward. However, electric traction was still in its infancy and agreement would be needed with the Metropolitan because of the shared ownership of the inner circle. A jointly owned train of six coaches successfully ran an experimental passenger service on the Earl's Court to High Street Kensington section for six months in 1900. Tenders were then requested and in 1901 a Metropolitan and District joint committee recommended the Ganz three-phase <b>AC</b> <b>system</b> with overhead wires. Initially this was accepted by both parties.|$|E
5|$|In 1893, Edward Dean Adams, {{who headed}} up the Niagara Falls Cataract Construction Company, sought Tesla's opinion on what system {{would be best to}} {{transmit}} power generated at the falls. Over several years, there had been a series of proposals and open competitions on how best to use power generated by the falls. Among the systems proposed by several US and European companies were two-phase and three-phase AC, high-voltage DC, and compressed air. Adams pumped Tesla for information about the current state of all the competing systems. Tesla advised Adams that a two-phased system would be the most reliable, and that there was a Westinghouse system to light incandescent bulbs using two-phase alternating current. The company awarded a contract to Westinghouse Electric for building a two-phase AC generating system at the Niagara Falls, based on Tesla's advice and Westinghouse's demonstration at the Columbian Exposition that they could build a complete <b>AC</b> <b>system.</b> At the same time, a further contract was awarded to General Electric to build the AC distribution system.|$|E

Electrification had been considered by the Met as early as the 1880s, but such a method of traction was still in its infancy, and agreement would be needed with the District because of the shared ownership of the Inner Circle.

The UERL was led by the American Charles Yerkes, whose experience in the United States led him to favour DC with a third rail similar to that on the City & South London Railway and Central London Railway. After arbitration by the Board of Trade a DC system with four rails was taken up and the railways began electrifying using multiple-unit stock and electric locomotives hauling carriages.|$|E

40|$|International audienceThe formal {{verification}} of Artifact-centric (<b>AC)</b> <b>systems</b> {{is a subject}} of growing interest in the Service Oriented Computing (SOC) community, which can benefit from techniques developed for Multi-agent systems and knowledge reasoning and representation. In the present contribution we consider the verification of <b>AC</b> <b>systems</b> that do not necessarily satisfy boundedness and uniformity, the typical assumptions used to prove decidability of the model checking problem in this setting. We provide a partial model checking procedure for agent-based <b>AC</b> <b>systems</b> against a first-order temporal logic that includes modal operators for agent knowledge. Interestingly, we obtain this result by introducing a counterpart semantics for first-order modal logic, and by defining notions of simulation and abstraction for this setting.

40|$|Abstract This article {{investigates the}} effect of air {{conditioning}} (<b>AC)</b> <b>systems</b> on air temperature and examines their electricity consumption for a semiarid urban environment. We simulate a 10 day extreme heat period over the Phoenix metropolitan area (U. S.) with the Weather Research and Forecasting model coupled to a multilayer building energy scheme. The performance of the modeling system is evaluated against 10 Arizona Meteorological Network weather stations and one weather station maintained by the National Weather Service for air temperature, wind speed, and wind direction. We show that explicit representation of waste heat from air conditioning systems improved the 2 m air temperature correspondence to observations. Waste heat release from <b>AC</b> <b>systems</b> was maximumduring the day, but themean effect was negligible near the surface. However, during the night, heat emitted from <b>AC</b> <b>systems</b> increased the mean 2 m air temperature by more than 1 °C for some urban locations. The <b>AC</b> <b>systems</b> modified the thermal stratification of the urban boundary layer, promoting vertical mixing during nighttime hours. The anthropogenic processes examined here (i. e., explicit representation of urban energy consumption processes due to <b>AC</b> <b>systems)</b> require incorporation in future meteorological and climate investigations to improve weather and climate predictability. Our results demonstrate that releasing waste heat into the ambient environment exacerbates the nocturnal urban heat island and increases cooling demands. 1...|$|R

25|$|The re-organisation of {{railways}} in India into regional zones {{began in}} 1951. On 14 April 1951, Southern Railway was created.

On 14 April 1952, Northern Railway, Eastern Railway and North-Eastern Railway were created. In the same year, fans and lights were mandated for all compartments in all classes of passenger accommodation and sleeping accommodation was introduced in coaches. On 1 August 1955, Eastern Railway was split to form new South-Eastern Railway. In 1956, divisional system of administration was set up for the various regional zones. Also in 1956, the first fully air-conditioned train was introduced between Howrah and Delhi. In 1957, after successful trials in France, SNCF proposed 25kV AC electrification for railways. Railways took a decision to adopt 25kV AC electrification and chose SNCF as technical consultant. An organisation, Main Line Electrification Project (which later became the Railway Electrification Project and still later the Central Organization for Railway Electrification) was established in the same year. In 1958, the North-Eastern Railway split to form a new Northeast Frontier Railway. In 1959, the Raj Kharswan - Dongoposi section became the first section to be electrified with 25kV AC traction. The first scheduled train using 25kV AC traction ran on Raj Kharswan - Dongoposi section on 11 August 1960. In 1966, first containerized freight services were started, between Bombay and Ahmedabad.
