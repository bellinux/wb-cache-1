50|$|The SR is {{tasked with}} {{investigating}} violations of all Icelandic tax laws levied or {{enforced by the}} Directorate of Internal Revenue, and violations of the Accounting Act and Financial Statements Act. Any other activities fall outside the SR’ scope of authority. Once a tax investigation case has concluded, the SR decides whether or not criminal proceedings are initiated. If criminal proceedings are initiated, they may proceed in three manners. The taxpayer is fined an <b>amount</b> <b>deemed</b> <b>necessary</b> by the SR, the SR presents a payment claim before the State Internal Revenue Board, or the case is referred to the Icelandic Police.Each year, the SR investigates ~100 tax fraud cases. Tax fraud in Iceland tends to be concentrated in the restaurant and food industries.|$|E
60|$|At {{the end of}} a month's hard work, Rupert {{began to}} {{understand}} his duties, for in those days the <b>amount</b> of drill <b>deemed</b> <b>necessary</b> for a trooper was small indeed in proportion to that which he has now to master. Rupert was already a good rider, and soon learnt where was his proper place as cornet in each evolution, and the orders that it behoved him to give. The foot drill was longer and more difficult, for in those days dragoons fought far more on foot than is now the case, although at this epoch they had already ceased to be considered as mounted infantry, and had taken their true place as cavalry. Rupert's broadsword drill lasted but a very short time; upon the drill sergeant asking him if he knew anything of that weapon, he said that he could play at singlestick, but had never practised with the broadsword. His instructor, however, found that a very few lessons were sufficient to enable him to perform the required cuts and guard with sufficient proficiency, and very speedily claimed the crown which Rupert promised him on his dismissal from the class.|$|R
5000|$|There {{are also}} {{concerns}} or issues {{with use of}} GIS tools for public health efforts. Chief among those is a concern for privacy and confidentiality of individuals. [...] Public health {{is concerned about the}} health of the population as a whole, but must use data on the health of individuals to make many of those assessments, and protecting the privacy and confidentiality of those individuals is of paramount importance. Use of GIS displays and related databases raises the potential of compromising those privacy standards, so some precautions are necessary to avoid pinpointing individuals based on spatial data. For example, data may need to be aggregated to cover larger areas such as a zip code or county, helping to mask individual identities. Maps can also be constructed at smaller scales so that less detail is revealed. Alternately, key identifying features (such as the road and street network) can be left off the maps to mask exact location, or it may even be advisable to intentionally offset the location markers by some random <b>amount</b> if <b>deemed</b> <b>necessary.</b> [...] It is well established in the literature that statistical inference based on aggregated data can lead researchers to erroneous conclusions, suggesting relationships that in fact do not exist or obscuring relationships that do in fact exist. This issue is known as the modifiable areal unit problem. For example, New York public health officials worried that cancer clusters and causes would be misidentified after they were forced to post maps showing cancer cases by ZIP code on the internet. Their assertion was that ZIP codes were designed for a purpose unrelated to public health issues, and so use of these arbitrary boundaries might lead to inappropriate groupings and then to incorrect conclusions.|$|R
