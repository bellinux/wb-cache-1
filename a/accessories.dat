40|$|AbstractINTRODUCTIONAccessory spleen {{is a rare}} condition. Torsion of <b>accessory</b> spleen {{can lead}} to acute abdomen. PRESENTATION OF CASEWe {{describe}} {{a young woman with}} an acute abdomen caused by torsion of <b>accessory</b> spleen. Abdominal computed tomography angiography (CTA) demonstrated an ischemic giant <b>accessory</b> spleen with a twisted vascular pedicle. An emergency laparotomy was performed with resection of the infarcted <b>accessory</b> spleen. DISCUSSIONAccessory spleen is a rare and asymptomatic condition. Torsion of <b>accessory</b> spleen is also uncommon. Abdominal pain is the main symptom. CTA is effective in reaching a diagnosis. Definitive treatment of an acute abdomen due to <b>accessory</b> splenic torsion is emergency <b>accessory</b> splenectomy. CONCLUSIONElective <b>accessory</b> splenectomy should be recommended for known giant <b>accessory</b> spleen to prevent complications in future...|$|R

40|$|When an {{imperative}} {{visual stimulus}} is paired with an auditory (<b>accessory)</b> stimulus, RT is generally faster {{than with the}} imperative stimulus alone. Three experiments using additive-factors logic tested an energy-summation view of the <b>accessory,</b> where effects are due to increased rate of information build-up in sensory stages, and a preparation-enhancement view which holds that the <b>accessory</b> serves an alerting function. Experiment 1 found no interaction between the <b>accessory</b> presence and (visual) stimulus brightness, suggesting no role of the <b>accessory</b> in stimulus identification. Experiment 2 found no interaction between <b>accessory</b> presence and spatial S-R compatibility, arguing that the <b>accessory</b> operated in stage(s) other than response selection. Experiment 3 produced an interaction between the <b>accessory</b> and movement complexity, arguing for <b>accessory</b> effects in a response-programming stage. The data generally favored preparation-enhancement, and offered no support for an energy-summation view...|$|R

40|$|To {{clarify the}} anatomy of the {{pancreatic}} duct system and to investigate its embryology, we reviewed 256 pancreatograms with normal pancreatic head, 81 with pancreas divisum and 74 with pancreaticobiliary maljunction. <b>Accessory</b> pancreatograms {{were divided into two}} patterns. The long-type <b>accessory</b> pancreatic duct forms a straight line and joins the main pancreatic duct at the neck portion of the pancreas. The short-type <b>accessory</b> pancreatic duct joins the main pancreatic duct near its first inferior branch. The short-type <b>accessory</b> pancreatic duct is less likely to have a long inferior branch arising from the <b>accessory</b> pancreatic duct. The length of the <b>accessory</b> pancreatic duct from the orifice to the first long inferior branch was similar in the short- and long-type <b>accessory</b> pancreatic ducts. The first long inferior branch from the long-type <b>accessory</b> pancreatic duct passes though the main pancreatic duct near the origin of the inferior branch from the main pancreatic duct. Immunohistochemically, in the short-type <b>accessory</b> pancreatic duct, the main pancreatic duct between the junction with the short-type <b>accessory</b> pancreatic duct and the neck portion was located in the ventral pancreas. The long-type <b>accessory</b> pancreatic duct represents a continuation of the main duct of the dorsal pancreatic bud. The short-type <b>accessory</b> pancreatic duct is probably formed by the proximal main duct of the dorsal pancreatic bud and its long inferior branch...|$|R
40|$|The {{number of}} cells {{and the size of}} the cells in the male <b>accessory</b> gland, the {{quantity}} of <b>accessory</b> gland proteins, and their effects on fitness in males of different ages were studied in Drosophila bipectinata Duda (Diptera: Drosophilidae). Male age was significantly positively correlated with the size of <b>accessory</b> gland, the number of main cells of the <b>accessory</b> gland, the quantity of protein in unmated males, the duration of copulation, the transferred quantity of protein and sperm to the mated female, fecundity, and fertility, while male age was significantly negatively correlated with the size of main cell in the <b>accessory</b> gland and the quantity of protein in mated males. The size of the main cells was significantly positively correlated with the quantity of protein in unmated males but significantly negatively correlated with the size of the <b>accessory</b> gland and the number of main cells in the <b>accessory</b> gland. These results suggest that D. bipectinata young males, with their smaller size of their <b>accessory</b> glands and having fewer and larger main cells in their <b>accessory</b> glands, produced the least quantity of protein and transferred significantly less protein and sperm to the mated female than did middle and old age males. Thus, this study suggests that in D. bipectinata, male age affects the number of <b>accessory</b> gland cells and the quantity of protein in the <b>accessory</b> gland. The size and number of main cells in the <b>accessory</b> gland {{and the size of the}} <b>accessory</b> gland were related to the production of protein.

40|$|Introduction: An <b>accessory</b> liver lobe {{is a rare}} {{developmental}} abnormality, {{which is}} often not diagnosed preoperatively, and is usually detected incidentally during abdominal surgery. This condition is often asymptomatic; here, we report on {{a case where the}} <b>accessory</b> liver lobe was diagnosed preoperatively using ultrasonography. Case presentation: A 59 -year-old woman presented to our hospital with right upper abdominal pain. An abdominal ultrasonography indicated the presence of gallbladder debris and an <b>accessory</b> liver lobe. She underwent laparoscopic cholecystectomy and resection of the <b>accessory</b> liver lobe without any complications. Discussion: An <b>accessory</b> liver lobe is a rare anomaly of the liver. It is typically asymptomatic and is detected incidentally during surgery or autopsy in most cases. However, we diagnosed the <b>accessory</b> liver lobe using ultrasonography. An <b>accessory</b> liver lobe can occasionally result in complications, such as bleeding, portal vein obstruction, or malignant transformation to hepatocellular carcinoma. Conclusion: An <b>accessory</b> liver lobe should be resected to prevent complications and malignant transformation.

40|$|Anatomic, histologic and {{ultrasound}} studies demonstrate {{two distinct}} types of longitudinal veins {{in the lower}} extremities. The great saphenous vein is deep to the saphenous fascia. <b>Accessory</b> saphenous veins are superficial to this layer, have thin walls with diminished muscle cells and elastic fibers. Vein characteristics may affect long-term graft patency. This study assesses the incidence of <b>accessory</b> saphenous veins in various patient groups and evaluates issues related to their use as coronary conduits. Ultrasound imaging assessed great and <b>accessory</b> saphenous veins in 476 normal limbs, in 42 patients post-saphenous vein harvesting and in 75 patients undergoing coronary revascularization. <b>Accessory</b> saphenous veins are found in 67 % of normal subjects.

40|$|The aim of {{the study}} was to review the {{clinical}} and electrophysiological characteristics and results of radiofrequency catheter ablation in patients with multiple <b>accessory</b> pathways to compare them with those of patients with single <b>accessory</b> pathways. Electrophysiological study and radiofrequency catheter ablation were performed in 1010 consecutive cases with Wolff Parkinson White Syndrome. Presence of multiple <b>accessory</b> pathways was documented in 31 patients (3. 1 %); 30 had two, and 1 had three <b>accessory</b> pathways. Of the 63 <b>accessory</b> pathways, 42 were manifest and 21 concealed. Nine patients had Ebstein's anomaly associated with atrioventricular bypass tracts. The most common combination was right posteroseptal with right free wall bypass tracts (15 patients with 30 <b>accessory</b> pathways). Fifty-one of the sixty-three <b>accessory</b> pathways (81 %) were ablated successfully without complications. The duration of the procedure was 100 +/- 58 min and the fluoroscopic time 40 +/- 17 min.
