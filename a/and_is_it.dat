Each DVD also includes two episodes from the series, from seasons 4 and 5 respectively, with licensed music removed.

It does, however, include a short clip of a Daria appearance on Beavis and Butt-Head, accessed as a hidden Easter egg on the opening menu (by cycling among menu choices until the highlighting disappears).|$|E

Fellow series writer John Shiban said that the scene was not [...] "subtle" [...] enough to convey the right level of suspicion. Spotnitz has described [...] "Per Manum" [...] as being [...] "a real paranoia episode", concerning [...] "the way you perceive connections between people, what are they saying, <b>and</b> <b>is</b> <b>it</b> suspicious or not".|$|E
500|$|The stipe {{is white}} to pale yellow, dry, solid, not bruising, and [...] (having {{a very fine}} whitish powder on the surface). A {{characteristic}} feature of many Suillus species are the glandular dots found on the stipe—clumps of hyphal cell ends through which the fungus secretes various metabolic wastes, leaving a sticky or resinous [...] "dot". In S.brevipes, {{the form of the}} glandular dots is variable: they may be absent, slightly underdeveloped or obscurely formed with age. The stipe is usually short in comparison to the diameter of the cap, typically [...] long and [...] thick. It is either of equal width throughout, or may taper downwards; its surface bears minute puncture holes at maturity, <b>and</b> <b>is</b> <b>it</b> slightly fibrous at the base. Collections made in New Zealand tend to have a reddish coloration at the very base of the stipe. The flesh of the mushroom is initially white, but turns pale yellow in age. The odor and taste are mild. [...] The spore print is cinnamon-brown.|$|E

500|$|A fourth 1928 novel, Ladies Almanack by the American writer Djuna Barnes, {{not only}} {{contains}} a character based on Radclyffe Hall but includes passages {{that may be}} a response to The Well. Ladies Almanack is a roman à clef of a lesbian literary and artistic circle in Paris, written in an archaic, Rabelaisian style and starring Natalie Barney as Dame Evangeline Musset. Much as Sir Phillip paces his study worrying about Stephen, Dame Musset's father [...] "pac his library in the most normal of Night-Shirts". When, unlike Sir Phillip, he confronts his daughter, she replies confidently: [...] "Thou, good Governor, wast expecting a Son when you lay atop of your Choosing... Am I not doing after your very Desire, <b>and</b> <b>is</b> <b>it</b> not the more commendable, seeing that I do it without the Tools for the Trade, and yet nothing complain?" [...] Ladies Almanack is far more overtly sexual than The Well; its cryptic style, full of in-jokes and ornate language, may have been intended to disguise its content from censors. It could not in any case be prosecuted by the Home Office, since it was published only in France, in a small, privately printed edition. It did not become widely available until 1972.|$|E

2500|$|Because moa are a {{group of}} flightless birds with no vestiges of wing bones, {{questions}} have been raised about how they arrived in New Zealand, and from where. There are many theories about the moa's arrival and radiation on New Zealand, but the most recent theory suggests that the moa arrived on New Zealand about 60million years ago (Mya) and split from the [...] "basal" [...] (see below) moa species, Megalapteryx about 5.8Mya instead of the 18.5Mya split suggested by Baker et al. (2005). [...] This does not necessarily mean there was no speciation between the arrival 60Mya and the basal split 5.8Mya, but the fossil record is lacking <b>and</b> <b>is</b> <b>it</b> most likely that early moa lineages existed but became extinct before the basal split 5.8Mya. The presence of Miocene aged species certainly suggests that moa diversification began before the split between Megalapteryx" [...] and the other taxa.|$|E
2500|$|Love of God and Love of Neighbor. Two main {{questions}} arise from {{reflecting on the}} nature of love and its meaning in biblical faith: is it possible to love God without seeing him, <b>and</b> <b>is</b> <b>it</b> possible for love to be commanded? Before answering the question, it is quickly grounded that one must love their neighbor before they can love God, otherwise they are hypocritical. 1 Jn 4:20 says [...] "If anyone says, 'I love God,' and hates his brother, he is a liar; for he who does not love his brother whom he has seen, cannot love God whom he has not seen". We can, therefore, love God whom we cannot see by loving our neighbor whom we can see. Loving our neighbor is loving God. In the same manner it shows that love can be and is demanded of us. God demands that we love others before we love God so that our love is blameless and pure and not hypocritical.|$|E
