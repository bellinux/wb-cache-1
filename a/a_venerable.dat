5|$|Godwin's book follows <b>a</b> <b>venerable</b> {{tradition}} of travel literature that blends {{the excitement of}} journeys to foreign places with utopian reflection; More's Utopia is cited as a forerunner, as is the account of Amerigo Vespucci. Godwin could fall back on an extensive body of work describing the voyages undertaken by his protagonist, including books by Hakluyt and Jan Huyghen van Linschoten, and the narratives deriving from the Jesuit mission in Beijing.|$|E
5|$|In {{his early}} years, Bonds batted as the leadoff hitter. With Van Slyke {{also in the}} outfield, the Pirates had <b>a</b> <b>venerable</b> {{defensive}} tandem that worked together to cover {{a lot of ground}} on the field although they were not close off the field. The Pirates experienced a surge in fan enthusiasm with Bonds on the team and set the club attendance record of 52,119 in the 1987 home opener. That year, he hit 25home runs in his second season, along with 32stolen bases and 59RBIs.|$|E
5|$|The ZX81's {{distribution}} {{arrangements were}} {{an essential part}} of its success and marked a watershed in the way that computers were sold in the UK. Sinclair had previously made its name as a mail-order retailer – the ZX81 was initially available only through mail-order – but the only truly effective way to reach the mass market was via high street stores. Fortunately for Sinclair, an opportunity to do just that was provided by W.H. Smith, <b>a</b> <b>venerable</b> book- and magazine-seller and stationery chain. The company had stagnated in the 1970s and was looking for ways to revitalise its image and expand its product range.|$|E

25|$|By the {{beginning}} of the 20th century, there was not so much a national system as <b>a</b> <b>venerable</b> patchwork of production, distribution, and taxation. The salt trade in one province, Hunan, was estimated to involve some 1,000 traders, six to nine thousand junkmen, and about 1,000 state employees and officials, including police. In the broader Lianghuai region altogether some 369,000 people were employed, including 230,000 laborers in the salt fields.|$|E

25|$|Most {{works were}} {{revealed}} {{in response to}} specific questions by Bábís. This is not unusual; the genre of the letter has been <b>a</b> <b>venerable</b> medium for composing authoritative texts {{as far back as}} the Paul the Apostle. Three quarters of the chapters of the New Testament are letters, were composed to imitate letters, or contain letters within them. Sometimes the Báb revealed works very rapidly by chanting them in the presence of a secretary and eyewitnesses.|$|E
25|$|As {{indicated}} above, however, {{only two}} of the megillot are traditionally read in all Jewish communities, Esther on Purim and Lamentations on the Ninth of Av. The practice of reading the other three books on the Three Pilgrimage Festivals is widespread but by no means universal. To read them is <b>a</b> <b>venerable</b> custom among Ashkenazim, but many Sephardic Jews do not associate the three books with the three festivals. The association is thus weaker also among Hasidic Jews who were influenced by Sephardic customs.|$|E

25|$|Pimen, <b>a</b> <b>venerable</b> monk, {{writes a}} chronicle ("Yet one last tale") of Russian history. The young novice Grigoriy awakes from a horrible (and prophetic) dream, which he relates to Pimen, {{in which he}} climbed a high tower, was mocked {{by the people of}} Moscow, and fell. Pimen advises him to fast and pray. Grigoriy regrets that he retired so soon from worldly affairs to become a monk. He envies Pimen's early life of adventure. Pimen speaks approvingly of Ivan the Terrible and his son Fyodor, who both {{exhibited}} great spiritual devotion, and draws a contrast with Boris, a regicide.|$|E
25|$|He {{presented}} {{himself as a}} patrician, as the last Edwardian, as a Whig (in the tradition of his wife's family), as a romantic Tory, as intellectual, as a man shaped by the comradeship of the trenches and by the slump of the 1930s, as a shrewd man of business of bourgeois Scottish stock, and as <b>a</b> <b>venerable</b> elder statesman at home with modern youth. There was something in all these views, which he did little to discourage, and which commanded public respect into the early 1960s. Whether he was ever a mainstream Conservative, rather than a skillful exponent of the postwar consensus, is more doubtful.|$|E
25|$|Far {{from the}} {{destructive}} {{practices of the}} 1960s diminishing as time went on, if anything they got steadily worse, with the concrete office blocks of earlier times being replaced {{with the idea of}} Georgian pastiche or replica offices in place of original 18th century stock. Whole swathes of Harcourt Street and St. Stephen's Green were demolished and rebuilt in such a fashion in the 1970s and 1980s, as were parts of Parnell Square, Kildare Street, North Great George's Street and many other areas around the city. Many saw this practice as an 'easy way out' for planners; <b>a</b> <b>venerable</b> Georgian front was maintained, whilst 'progress' was allowed to continue unhindered.|$|E

25|$|Marathi {{literature}} {{began and}} grew {{owing to the}} rise of the Seuna dynasty of Devgiri, who adopted Marathi as the court language and patronised Marathi scholars. Further growth and usage of the language was because of two religious sects – the Mahanubhava and Varkari panthans – who adopted Marathi as the medium for preaching their doctrines of devotion. Marathi had attained <b>a</b> <b>venerable</b> place in court life {{by the time of the}} Seuna kings. During the reign of the last three Seuna kings, a great deal of literature in verse and prose, on astrology, medicine, Puranas, Vedanta, kings and courtiers were created. Nalopakhyan, Rukmini swayamvar and Shripati's Jyotishratnamala (1039) are a few examples.|$|E
25|$|Vinul de viață lungă is {{considered}} {{by some to be}} Cocea's main work as a novelist. The main character, Manole Arcaș, is, like Cocea himself, a Moldavian boyar. Successive episodes in the book reveal his complex worldview: Arcaș is an atheist with modernist sensibilities, a lover of nature, and a utopian socialist who has been turning his estate into a commune. Having reached <b>a</b> <b>venerable</b> age, he slowly reveals the secret of his longevity in conversations with the much younger judge: after decades of experimentation, the Arcaș estate produces a special sort of Moldavian wine; the grapes were pressed by Manole and a Romani (Gypsy) girl, {{in the course of their}} love-making. The object of Arcaș' olfactory fetish, the girl has died a tragic death, inspiring Manole to take up the winery project as a sort of symbolic rebirth.|$|E
25|$|Bacon {{has been}} called the father of empiricism. His works argued for the {{possibility}} of scientific knowledge based only upon inductive reasoning and careful observation of events in nature. Most importantly, he argued this could be achieved by use of a sceptical and methodical approach whereby scientists aim to avoid misleading themselves. While his own practical ideas about such a method, the Baconian method, did not have a long lasting influence, the general idea of the importance and possibility of a sceptical methodology makes Bacon the father of scientific method. This marked a new turn in the rhetorical and theoretical framework for science, the practical details of which are still central in debates about science and methodology today. In addition to his work in the sciences, Bacon was also <b>a</b> <b>venerable</b> patron of libraries and developed a functional system for the cataloging of books by dividing them into three categories- history, poesy, and philosophy- which could further be divided into more specific subjects and subheadings.|$|E

2500|$|The {{growth in}} the number of novices during 16th and 17th century, {{resulted}} in the expansion of the primitive installations, which today represents the location of the church. Remnants of this church, oriented towards the east, can still be seen in the vestiges integrated into the walls of the southern cloister. After is expansion, the new church was consecrated at the end of the 17th century, although its interior decorations were not completed until the following century. [...] In 1793, a new organ was commissioned and installed by António Xavier Machado e Cerveira. The Church of Gonçalo de Amarante was inaugurated in 1776, sheltering the ancient Irmandade de Nossa Senhora da Boa Morte e Assunção (Sisterhood of Our Lady of Good Death and Assumption), <b>an</b> <b>venerable</b> order.|$|R
25|$|Following his uncle's wish, John burns the Melmoth portrait. He is {{visited by}} Melmoth in a dream, and later sees Melmoth {{laughing}} at a shipwreck. John tries to approach him, but slips and {{falls into the}} sea. He is saved from drowning by the sole survivor of the wreck, a Spaniard Alonzo Monçada. Alonzo Monçada tells his story, in which his family confines him to a monastery. He is mistreated by the monks, and his brother Juan arranges for him to escape {{with the help of}} a fellow monk, a parricide. The escape plan is a trap and Juan is killed. Monçada is taken to the prison of the Inquisition. There he is visited in his cell by Melmoth, who says he will help him escape. A fire breaks out, and in the confusion Monçada escapes. He meets <b>a</b> <b>venerable</b> Jewish scholar, Adonijah, who lives in a secret chamber decorated with the skeletons of his own family. In exchange for food and shelter, Adonijah compels Monçada to transcribe a manuscript for him: 'the Tale of the Indians'.|$|E
25|$|This {{uprooting}} {{raises the}} question of why Calvinus was permitted to displace such <b>a</b> <b>venerable</b> shrine. The Church Fathers associate Mutunus with groupings of other deities that are assumed {{to be based on the}} lost theological works of Varro. Through examining these connections, Robert Palmer concluded that the old cult of Mutunus was merged with that of Father Liber, who was variously identified with or shared attributes with Jupiter, Bacchus, and Lampsacene Priapus. Palmer further conjectured that it was Mutunus, in the form of Liber, to whom Julius Caesar made sacrifice on the day of his assassination, receiving the ill omens that the conspirator Decimus Brutus urged him to ignore. Caesar had previously celebrated his victory at the Battle of Munda on the Liberalia, or festival of Liber held March 17, and he visited the house of the pontifex Calvinus on the Ides of March, near the archaic shrine of Mutunus-Liber. In Palmer's view, the evident ill favor of the god gave Augustus license to reform the cult during his program of religious revivalism that often disguised radical innovations. The god was then Hellenized as Bacchus Lyaeus.|$|E
