25|$|According to Liu Xiang’s book Lienü zhuan written much later, around 18 BCE, Jie was {{corrupted}} by his infatuation with his concubine Mo Xi (妺喜 or 末喜), who was beautiful, but completely lacking in virtue. Among other things, {{she liked to}} drink, enjoyed music, and also had a penchant for jugglers and sing-song girls. <b>Apparently,</b> <b>she</b> had Jie order a lake of wine made. They both sailed about in the alcohol lake in an orgy of drunken naked men and women bathing and drinking. She then commanded 3,000 men to drink the lake dry, only to laugh when they all drowned. This event was also recorded in the Han Ying’s book Han shi waizhuan.|$|E

25|$|On 28 January 1705 Gordon {{captured}} a Dutch ship Catherine. This arrest caused great consternation in Holland and an appeal was written to Queen Anne {{pointing out that}} the owners of the vessel were blameless since they had passports to land their cargo of wine from the Canaries in Rotterdam. Trade with Spain and the Canaries was allowed by agreement between the two countries. The case went on for years but the vessel was sold at Leith in two weeks. <b>Apparently</b> <b>she</b> also had an illegal French passport and the ship's cook took revenge on the captain, who had had him beaten the previous day, by revealing this to Gordon. He also {{captured a}} small four-gun privateer, St. Esprit, from Ostend. After obtaining permission from the Admiralty to purchase the vessel he renamed her Little Gordon and sent her trading.|$|E
500|$|In their 1998 book, Star Trek 101, Terry J. Erdmann and Paula M. Block called [...] "Unnatural Selection" [...] the key Pulaski episode.

500|$|Betances met {{his lifelong}} companion, Simplicia Isolina Jiménez Carlo, in 1864. Jiménez {{apparently}} {{was born in}} what would later become the Dominican Republic, on July 28, 1842. Her mother's last name, Carlo, rather common in Cabo Rojo, implies that her family had ties to the town. She worked for one of Betances' sisters between 1863 and 1864, and he met her once at his sister's house. <b>Apparently</b> <b>she</b> was infatuated with him strongly enough to appear at his door {{with a pair of}} suitcases, asking him to give her shelter, since [...] "no gentleman would leave a woman alone on the street at night." [...] Jiménez then became Betances' common-law wife for thirty-five years, and survived his death in 1898. They would not have any children. Their godchild, Magdalena Caraguel, was eventually adopted by the couple as their daughter. Little else is documented about Jiménez in history books, and Betances rarely mentions her in his works and correspondence.|$|E

500|$|Ria Brown, the biographer of {{competitive}} swimmer Anita Lhoest, claims Lhoest terminated a pregnancy by Eastwood without consulting him {{at one point}} during their late 1950s to early 1960s affair. Restaurant critic Gael Greene admitted to an affair with Eastwood that began when she was assigned to interview him on the set of 1970's Two Mules for Sister Sara. A fling with French model Cathy Reghin around the same time was one of his few extramarital involvements to receive press coverage of any kind during the fact. According to McGilligan, Eastwood had many other affairs, including with co-stars Inger Stevens (Hang 'Em High), Jean Seberg (Paint Your Wagon) and Jo Ann Harris (The Beguiled), as well as actresses Jill Banner, Catherine Deneuve, and Susan St. James, columnist Bridget Byrne and singer Keely Smith while married to Johnson, who, after a trial separation and lingering bout of hepatitis during the mid-1960s, expressed desire to reconcile and start a family. They had two children together: Kyle Eastwood (born May 19, 1968) and Alison Eastwood (born May 22, 1972). In 1972, Eastwood met married actress (later director) Sondra Locke. The two began living together while filming The Outlaw Josey Wales in the autumn of 1975, by which time, according to Locke, [...] "He had told me that there was no real relationship left between him and Maggie." [...] Locke wrote in her autobiography, [...] "Clint seemed astonished at his need for me, even admitting that he'd never been faithful to one woman — because he'd [...] "never been in love before," [...] he confided. He even made up a song about it: [...] "She made me monogamous." [...] That flattered and delighted me. I would never doubt his faithfulness and his love for me." [...] Locke moved into the Sherman Oaks house Eastwood had once shared with Johnson (who by then lived full-time in Pebble Beach), but felt uncomfortable there because [...] "psychologically, it would always be Maggie's." [...] "Finally I told Clint that I couldn't live there any longer," [...] writes Locke. The couple moved to Bel-Air in a fixer-upper Locke spent three years renovating. She underwent two abortions and a tubal ligation in the late 1970s and was most reluctant about the second abortion, noting [...] "I couldn't help but think that that baby, with both Clint's and my best qualities, would be extraordinary." [...] Johnson made no secret of her dislike for Locke, even though the two women never met. [...] "Maggie placed severe rules on my relationship with the kids. <b>Apparently,</b> <b>she</b> never forgave me ... After she learned that Clint had taken me onto her property to show me a baby deer that had just been born there, she laid down a rule that I was never to be allowed there again. I was not even allowed to phone the Pebble Beach house." [...] In 1978 Johnson filed for legal separation from Eastwood, but did not file for divorce until May 1984, a divorce which was finalized that November with Johnson receiving a straight cash payment reported to be between $25 and $30million.|$|E

Brigadier Lethbridge-Stewart (Nicholas Courtney) assigns her to the Doctor, who is initially dismayed when he finds out that she is not a scientist, but accepts her because he does not have the heart to tell her otherwise. An enthusiastic, bubbly and sometimes scatter-brained blonde, Jo soon endears herself to the other members of UNIT, especially Captain Mike Yates (Richard Franklin) and Sergeant Benton (John Levene). The Third Doctor is also particularly attached to her, and she is devoted to him, refusing to leave his side even where mortal danger is involved.|$|E

The Messerschmitts dropped three bombs on six shops in Burgate, close to Canterbury Cathedral. At least six {{people were killed}} and more were injured; it took two days to dig out the dead from the debris. A furrier's received a direct hit, and Cissie was killed instantly while shopping for a fur rug as a wedding or birthday gift. She was identified by her jewellery, said to be a gift from the Sultan. <b>Apparently</b> <b>she</b> and her friend Peggy Clark had left Herne Bay at 10.15 am to motor into Canterbury.

2500|$|Martí came to Guatemala at age 24 from Mexico, {{where he}} had {{professional}} success as a journalist and writer and had reunited with his family after his deportation from Spanish Cuba (1871-1875). In Guatemala he met the dramatic actress Eloisa Agüero and eventually got engaged to his future wife, Carmen. Actually, Martí arrived to Central America after becoming disappointed with the authoritarian Mexican rule of Porfirio Diaz. Upon arriving to Guatemala he wrote a critical view of the inferiority that women had been subject to in that country: in an article entitled 'The new codes [...] ", published in Progreso, on April 22, 1877 he made the following reflection upon request of Joaquin Macal -Secretary of Foreign Affairs of Guatemala at the time-: [...] "What {{is the first of}} the colonial ballasts from the deposed legislation? The absolute power that bestial husbands had over the venerable wife; it practically gives husbands parental rights over women. The law of heaven, is not capable of knowing the law of land?" [...] So he focused on the Guatemalan ladies' walking indolent, glances caste, dressed as women of the village, with braids lying on the mantle, they call shawl; hand counting idle floating mantle tips infant joys or sorrows of his first mistress'; [...] and when found Maria -more cosmopolitan and illustrated- he was immediately infatuated with her. It should be noted that it appears that María was not the standard shy and vulnerable Guatemalan girl: Guatemalan publications of the time talk about her relatively active participation as a musician and singer outside her home, in public artistic activities organized by societies and institutions where she coincided with Martí. <b>Apparently</b> <b>she</b> was a very popular youth within the city's high society of the time; María was then the footsteps of her aunt and grandmother Maria Josefa, who had died in 1848 and had been a superb poet and journalist, very influential in the Conservative governments of Guatemala.|$|E
