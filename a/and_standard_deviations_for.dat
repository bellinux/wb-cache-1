50|$|Stevens (1946) argued that, {{because the}} {{assumption}} of equal distance between categories does not hold for ordinal data, the use of means <b>and</b> <b>standard</b> <b>deviations</b> <b>for</b> description of ordinal distributions and of inferential statistics based on {{means and standard deviations}} was not appropriate. Instead, positional measures like the median and percentiles, in addition to descriptive statistics appropriate for nominal data (number of cases, mode, contingency correlation), should be used. Nonparametric methods have been proposed as the most appropriate procedures for inferential statistics involving ordinal data, especially those developed for the analysis of ranked measurements. However, use of parametric statistics for ordinal data may be permissible with certain caveats {{to take advantage of the}} greater range of available statistical procedures.|$|E
50|$|The {{test was}} {{developed}} using {{a sample of}} responses from the comparison of 504 sets of results from a trial by students, taken from a larger sample of 950 first year university student responses.The test was then normed on a sample of 1044 males and 1870 females aged between 17 and 69 years, across participants of varying backgrounds, including university students, nurses in training and blue and white collared employees of a major airline, bank, railway workshop and naval dockyard. The scores were subsequently checked for validity against outpatient groups including patients suffering from anxiety and depressive disorders, insomniacs, myocardial infarction patients, as well as patients undergoing treatment for sexual, menopausal and depressive disorders. While the test was not normed against samples younger than 17, due to the simplicity of language, {{there has been no}} compelling evidence against the use of the scales for comparison against children as young as 12.The reliability scores of the scales in terms of Cronbach's alpha scores rate the Depression scale at 0.91, the Anxiety scale at 0.84 and the Stress scale at 0.90 in the normative sample. The means <b>and</b> <b>standard</b> <b>deviations</b> <b>for</b> each scale are 6.34 and 6.97 for depression, 4.7 and 4.91 for anxiety and 10.11 and 7.91 for stress, respectively. The mean scores in the normative sample did vary slightly between genders as well as varying by age, though the threshold scores for classifications do not change by these variations. The Depression and Stress scales meet the standard threshold requirement of 0.9 for research, however, the Anxiety scale still meets the 0.7 threshold for clinical applications, and is still close to the 0.9 required for research.|$|E

40|$|Objective This study {{provides}} normative data, divided {{by age and}} gender, for the Diabetes Self-Management Profile (DSMP), an empirically supported structured interview that assesses adherence with the type 1 diabetes treatment regimen. Despite wide use, normative data on the DSMP {{have yet to be}} reported.  Methods The sample included 444 parents and 275 youth with type 1 diabetes. The DSMP was administered by a trained clinician.  Results For both child and parent ratings of adherence, means <b>and</b> <b>standard</b> <b>deviations</b> <b>for</b> the overall sample and subdivision by gender and three age groups are presented for normative comparisons. Subscale data (e. g., glucose monitoring, diet, exercise) are similarly presented. Lower adherence scores were reported among older adolescents relative to preadolescents.  Conclusions The literature has lacked normative data on pediatric diabetes adherence. These data present means <b>and</b> <b>standard</b> <b>deviations</b> <b>for</b> parent and child ratings of regimen adherence from a relatively large sample of youth with diabetes that can be utilized for normative comparisons for clinical and research purposes...|$|E
