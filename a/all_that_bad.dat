500|$|Roadrunner Records showed {{interest}} in Bullet for My Valentine and offered the band a deal. The offer was ultimately turned down, {{and the band}} signed a five-album record deal with Sony BMG and a UK licensing deal with Visible Noise. According to Tuck, they chose Sony because, [...] "We thought that a lot more doors {{would be open to}} us." [...] A self-titled EP was released on 15 November 2004 in the UK. Produced by Colin Richardson, it featured five tracks and marked the band's first official release. A second EP, Hand of Blood, was released on 22 August 2005 through Trustkill Records and was only available in the U.S.; the release contained one extra track than the self-titled EP, [...] "4 Words (To Choke Upon)." [...] Daniel Lukes of Decibel Magazine reviewed the EP by stating, [...] "The worst part is that the music itself isnâ€™t <b>all</b> <b>that</b> <b>bad,</b> for the genre." [...] He went on to comment that the band should be [...] "embarrassed" [...] about the release. Zeromag's Josh Joyce complimented the band on [...] "how technical they can get without confusing the kids." ...|$|E
500|$|After {{the release}} of the video, critics commented on the {{resemblance}} between Rihanna's ex-boyfriend Chris Brown and her fictional love interest in the video, Dudley O'Shaughnessy, and how the video's content appeared to be somewhat of a reenactment of the assault upon Rihanna by Brown on the evening of the 2009 Grammy Awards. Chris Doplan of Consequence of Sound said that O'Shaughnessy strongly resembled Brown in his appearance. Amanda Dobbins of New York magazine concurred with Doplan, and wrote that O'Shaughnessy has short blond hair like Brown once had. Erika Ramirez of Billboard magazine also thought that O'Shaughnessy's character is a depiction of Brown, especially in relation to the scene which features the couple in a car, with O'Shaughnessy driving recklessly and Rihanna begging him to stop. William Goodman of Spin provided an analysis of the video with regard to the Brown comparisons. Like many reviewers, he noted the resemblance between Brown and O'Shaughnessy, writing [...] "The clip stars a dead ringer for Brown, complete with dyed hair and bulging biceps". Goodman commented upon the video's opening narration, which was actually voiced by Agyness Deyn, [...] "The video opens with a Rihanna voice-over that warns, 'You almost feel ashamed that someone could be that important. No one will ever understand how much it hurts... you almost wish that you could have <b>all</b> <b>that</b> <b>bad</b> stuff back, so that you have the good." [...] In conclusion, Goodman commented that [...] the scene showing an altercation in a car is reminiscent of Brown's assault on Rihanna, which occurred inside a car. Goodman wrote: [...] "during a heated argument between the couple in a muscle car, the Brown look-alike gives the Barbadian beauty a slap on the face. Convinced yet?" ...|$|E

2500|$|Shortly {{after the}} game's {{competitive}} play mode was released, Kotakus Nathan Grayson stated that [...] "Overwatchs competitive mode [...] <b>all</b> <b>that</b> <b>bad,</b> for how new and unpolished it is," [...] but opined that [...] "high-stakes competition and toxicity {{tend to go}} hand-in-hand, and Overwatchs competitive mode already has an ugly toxic stain." [...] Grayson concluded his piece with [...] "Overwatch is, most of the time, a feel-good team game. Introducing high-stakes competition with a muddled message {{about the importance of}} individual skill drags the game into confused, oftentimes negative territory. If Blizzard wants this thing to work, they're gonna have to figure out a competitive framework that's true to Overwatchs spirit, rather than just the spirit of competition." [...] Kaplan acknowledged that with the introduction of competitive mode that the whole of the Overwatch community has become more toxic, and they are constantly adapting elements behind the scenes to help deal with aggressive players in a more responsive manner, while trying to promote more enjoyable matches.|$|E

The hands that embrace Blomkvist's face and shatter it, represent wealth and power. Themes of domestic violence become apparent as a woman's face shatters after a merciless beating; this also ties in the brutal beating of Salander's mother by her father, an event revealed in the sequel, The Girl Who Played with Fire (2006).|$|R

'If not (I asked him), what did he say in defence of the officers condemned by the Coroner's jury, who, by signing the General Inspection report relative to the ship Great Tasmania, chartered for these troops, had deliberately asserted <b>all</b> <b>that</b> <b>bad</b> and poisonous dunghill refuse, to be good and wholesome food?'

6000|$|Mr. Britling {{had been}} a little {{surprised}} by the speech he had made. He hadn't realised before he began to talk how angry and scornful he was at this final coming into action of the Teutonic militarism that had so long menaced his world. He had always said it would never really fight--and here it was fighting! He was furious with the indignation of an apologist betrayed. He had only realised the strength and passion of his own belligerent opinions as he had heard them, and as he walked back with his wife through the village to the Dower House, he was still in the swirl of this self-discovery; he was darkly silent, devising fiercely denunciatory phrases against Krupp and Kaiser. [...] "Krupp and Kaiser," [...] he grasped that obvious, convenient alliteration. [...] "It is <b>all</b> <b>that</b> is <b>bad</b> in mediÃ¦valism allied to <b>all</b> <b>that</b> is <b>bad</b> in modernity," [...] he told himself.|$|R
60|$|And why did Christ choose you? As I {{have told}} you, {{that you may}} fight with Him against <b>all</b> <b>that</b> is <b>bad.</b> Jesus Christ's work at which He works for ever in heaven and in earth, is to root out <b>all</b> <b>that</b> is <b>bad,</b> <b>all</b> sin, all misery; and He will reign, and He will fight till all His enemies, even Death itself, are put under His feet and destroyed. And Christ expects you and me to help Him. He has chosen you and me, and all Christian people, to fight against what is bad, and to put it down and root it {{out as far as}} we can {{wherever}} we find it; and therefore, first, to root it out of our own hearts and lives; for while we are bad ourselves we cannot make others good. But if we go on doing bad and wrong things, are we fighting on Christ's side? No, we are fighting on the devil's side, and helping the devil against God.|$|R
5000|$|In {{his review}} for The New York Times, Walter Goodman {{described}} {{the film as}} a [...] "young folks' story, a sweet-natured boy-and-his-chimp tale (even the bad guys aren't <b>all</b> <b>that</b> <b>bad</b> - that's very arguable), with a dose of Animal Liberation {{to give the impression}} that something of current significance is going on." ...|$|E

50|$|American {{historian}} Martin Jay in The Virtues of Mendacity: On Lying in Politics (2012) explores how writers {{over the}} centuries have treated hypocrisy, deception, flattery, lying and cheating, slander, false pretenses, living on borrowed glory, masquerading, conventions of concealment, playacting before others and the arts of dissimulation. He assumes that politics is worthwhile, but since it is unavoidably linked to lying and hypocrisy, Jay concludes that lying must not be <b>all</b> <b>that</b> <b>bad.</b>|$|E

5000|$|Christopher Armstead of Film Critics United {{describes}} {{the film as}} [...] "tolerable" [...] as far as films released by The Asylum.
