5|$|Immediately {{following}} the catastrophic flooding in Monterrey, an appeal {{was made to}} the United States and other nations for aid. Many residents and visitors in the city did all they could to help rescue those trapped in the flood waters <b>and</b> <b>take</b> <b>care</b> of the homeless. According to the New York Times, one person rescued 30 people stranded in flood waters. Numerous rescue operations were undertaken during the flood, saving many lives. However, survivors faced another issue after losing their homes: lack of food. Food was unavailable to most residents {{in the wake of}} the storm until August31 when the first relief supplies arrived. Even then, most only received a small amount of bread and beans. Once the flood along the Santa Catarina River receded, searches were conducted to attempt to locate the bodies of victims.

25|$|Although Christian {{values were}} {{supposed}} to be spread through the population, missionaries and priests soon realized that they'd be better off adapting their doctrine as much as possible to the local customs, rather than trying to impose it. As it happened all over Asia, women in the Philippines were expected to become caring and nurturing mothers for their own children <b>and</b> <b>take</b> <b>care</b> of most household chores. Also a trait found all over Asia was the preference of most families to have male children instead of females.|$|E
25|$|To this remark, the Buddha {{tells them}} that the Brahmins have indeed {{forgotten}} about their past if they said such things. The {{fact is that the}} women in the Brahmin caste can get pregnant, give birth, <b>and</b> <b>take</b> <b>care</b> of their children. But the Brahmins still say that they are born from the Mouth of the God Brahma and other (castes) are born from Brahma's feet. Thus, the Brahmin's words are untrue. The Buddha said that the Brahmins are not speaking truthfully and they will reap a bad result from their own deeds.|$|E

25|$|Article II of the Code Noir of 1724 {{required}} {{owners to}} provide their slaves with religious education in the state religion, Roman Catholicism. Sunday {{was to be a}} day of rest for slaves. On days off, slaves were expected to feed <b>and</b> <b>take</b> <b>care</b> of themselves. During the 1740s economic crisis in the colony, owners had trouble feeding their slaves and themselves. Giving them time off also effectively gave more power to slaves, who started cultivating their own gardens and crafting items for sale as their own property. They began to participate in the economic development of the colony {{while at the same time}} increasing independence and self-subsistence.|$|E
25|$|In 1868 another child, Charles, {{was born}} into the Taylor family, and in 1870, Taylor and his wife made the {{difficult}} decision to send their older three surviving children (Bertie, Freddie, and Maria—Samuel died earlier that year) home to England with Miss Emily Blatchley. In July, Noel was born, though he died of malnutrition and deprivation two weeks later due to Maria's inability to nurse him. Maria herself died several days later, with the official cause of death being cholera. Her death shook Taylor deeply, and in 1871, his own health began deteriorating further, leading to his return to England later that year to recuperate <b>and</b> <b>take</b> <b>care</b> of business items.|$|E
