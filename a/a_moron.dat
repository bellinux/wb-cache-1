The superintendent was now Major General William Durward Connor, an officer renowned for his sharp tongue. Devers later recalled that [...] "A {{lot of people were}} afraid of General Connor.

Then there were only six varsity team sports; by 1936 there were eighteen. Despite the Great Depression, the Athletic Boards, which Devers ran, had accumulated considerable funds. His major task was the construction of new playing fields where there {{did not appear to be}} any available land. He came up with a plan to move the right of way of the West Shore Railroad. He found the railroad welcoming of the plan, as a shorter, straighter route saved them money. The new fields were completed in December 1936. He was promoted to full colonel on 1 July 1938.|$|E

Rohmer later called Out 1 [...] "a capitol monument {{in the history of}} modern cinema, {{an essential part of the}} cinematic heritage."

[...] Several Cahiers writers during the Rohmer-era disliked him, such as Douchet, Jean Domarchi, Fereydoun Hoveyda, Phillippe Demonsablon, Claude Beylie and Phillippe d’Hugues, who said that Rivette [...] "had a Saint-Just side, he was an intransigent Jacobin who considered you <b>a</b> <b>moron</b> if you didn’t agree with him.

Both Chrétien and his close associate man Eddie Goldenberg saw the charges against MacAulay as absurd, with Chrétien telling Wilson [...] "Do you want us to be eunuchs in our jobs?" [...] On November 21, 2002, Chrétien's communications director Françoise Ducros was overheard by Robert Fife saying about President Bush [...] "What a moron!", who reported the remark in the next day's edition of The National Post. The next day, Chrétien told the press that Bush was a friend and [...] "He's not <b>a</b> <b>moron</b> at all", leading to headlines in the press such as [...] "Chrétien denies Bush is a moron". Chrétien was highly reluctant to fire Ducros, who was one of his most loyal supporters. That Ducros was especially hated by the Martin fraction of the Liberals was another reason why Chrétien did not wish to fire Ducros, despite the media storm she had provoked. Finally, under strong pressure from the American government, which had quietly {{made it clear that the}} continued presence of Ducros would not help Canadian-American relations, Chrétien dismissed Ducros on November 26, 2002. Ducros's successor as communications director, Jim Munson, was a former journalist and a better-liked personality, which led to a marked improvement in the Chrétien government's relations with the media in its last year.|$|E

2500|$|In Portal 2, GLaDOS {{initially}} resumes {{her role}} as test monitor in a now-ruined facility after Wheatley inadvertently reactivates her. This time, she makes no attempt to hide her contempt and hatred for Chell; this is partly because Chell outwitted her, and partly because a backup system has forced her to relive her death over and over since her deactivation. Soon after she repairs the facility, a plot twist occurs when Wheatley convinces Chell to perform a core transfer, putting him {{in charge of the}} facility in place of GLaDOS. At this point he immediately becomes power-mad and puts GLaDOS into a potato battery after she tells him what he was originally designed to be <b>a</b> <b>moron.</b> He then turns on Chell and slams the elevator they are in, sending both into the bowels of the facility. GLaDOS is kidnapped by a bird and later saved by Chell, who teams up with GLaDOS to escape from the facility. While they are escaping from the old testing facility, GLaDOS discovers that her personality originally came from an assistant to former Aperture CEO Cave Johnson named Caroline, who was later uploaded into the GLaDOS program (it is suggested that this might have been done against her will at Cave Johnson's urging). The two of them find their way back to the testing facility, where Wheatley tasks them with completing tests until he springs a trap upon them and fails to kill them. Once they find Wheatley's lair, they cause him to become corrupted and switch GLaDOS back in charge of the facility. Anticipating the outcome, Wheatley boobytraps the trigger system with explosives. The deteriorating facility's ceiling starts to collapse, which Chell uses to shoot a portal at the moon and suck Wheatley and herself into space. GLaDOS rescues Chell, and shows relief for her safety. However, GLaDOS is able to discover where Caroline is in her brain, and immediately deletes her, reverting to her old self. Nevertheless, she decides that it is in her best interest to let Chell go, as GLaDOS learned the easiest solution is usually the best one, and felt that killing Chell was [...] "too hard".|$|E
