2500|$|A Democrat-turned-Republican, Caldwell first won {{the general}} {{election}} for state senator for Benton and Carroll counties in 1968, when he unseated the veteran Democratic incumbent, Russell Elrod (1904-1985) of Siloam Springs, who in the 1953-1954 session had been the Senate President Pro Tempore. Although he was considered a [...] "progressive" [...] or a Moderate Republican within the legislature, Caldwell recalled years later that he really had [...] "no ideology, no issue when I first ran. I just thought a two-party system was a good idea. I don't recall any of us [...] having an agenda. ... Usually when the candidates get to town, they see the big picture, <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>understand</b> {{they have to deal}} with issues that don't just apply to their home district." ...|$|E
2500|$|Anna Walton as Princess Nuala: King Balor's {{daughter}} and Nuada's twin sister. She {{is described as}} [...] "very light" [...] while Nuada is [...] "very dark", creating a yin and yang dynamic. She elaborated on the incestuous tones between her character and Prince Nuada, [...] "He's the dark side and she's the light side and they're pulled apart and pulled back together again, and she's {{trying to get away}} because she knows there is something she has to do. He can't let that go and they can't really do anything without each other so it's a really interesting thing." [...] Her character also forms a relationship with Abe Sapien, and Walton noted their similarities, [...] "They are both slightly lost souls <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>understand</b> each other." [...] Walton spoke of her character's sense of purpose, [...] "She feels very strongly about what she has to do in the film, and then her absolute connection and love for the Earth and what we are given. That's what she's here to protect... Her relationship with her brother, and how he is almost a part of her but she has to break away and will {{do whatever it takes to}} stop him from achieving what he wants to achieve, which is the mass destruction of mankind." ...|$|E
2500|$|The Meles {{government}} {{created an}} ethnic-based federalism, which {{came under attack}} by some Ethiopians. [...] Meles' TPLF party believed {{that there was no}} choice—this was the only solution to the centuries-old oppression by centralist governments, and to domination of culture, language, politics and economy by one ethnic group, namely the Amhara. On the other hand, some parties like the OLF (Oromo Liberation Front), which was a partner in drafting the constitution, see Amhara and Tigrayan domination of the country. The aim of the government policy was to empower all ethnicities and develop their cultures and languages. Also it was widely seen as a solution to the demand of governance preferred by the ethnic-based liberation fronts and parties participating in the July Convention of Nationalities in 1991. In response to critics who say ethnic federalism can bring divisions, Meles said that this policy served many interests, including equitable distribution of wealth and empowerment of ethnicities. He said the [...] "ethnic basis of Ethiopia's democracy stemmed from the government's fight against poverty and the need for an equitable distribution of the nation's wealth: peasants must be enabled {{to make their own decisions}} in terms of their own culture. Power must be devolved to them in ways that they understand, <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>understand</b> ethnicity.... Other approaches to development had been hegemonic and exploitative and had led to internecine strife and civil war." ...|$|E

50|$|He {{had great}} {{academic}} vision. He {{knew how to}} drive areas of excellence. And that {{takes a lot of}} fortitude. There's a lot of campus politics that goes on. He had to convince that faculty, <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>understood</b> <b>and</b> went along with his program that achieving areas of excellence would bring the university out of being a little country school with limited vision and limited education for its students and into the modern world. <b>And</b> <b>they</b> <b>understood</b> that <b>and</b> supported it. That's very hard to do. There are many campuses that {{have never been able to}} get that far down the road.|$|R
60|$|The {{children}} all listened very attentively, <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>understood</b> very well what Rollo's father was saying. Rollo was considering whether {{there had been}} a tacit agreement that the society should have the cabinet; but he did not speak.|$|R

6000|$|... "Oh, thank you, Hans," [...] replied Dora, and {{she placed}} the flower in her hair. Then she gave Dick a look that meant a good deal, <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>understood</b> each other perfectly, and both went in to breakfast feeling very happy.|$|R

6000|$|... “Yes, {{but they}} do not {{continually}} change from one thing to another in hopes to make it amusing.

60|$|If the Tartars {{had their}} Cham-Chi-Thaungu {{for a whole}} village, or country, these had idols in every hut and every cave; besides, they worship the stars, the sun, the water, the snow; and, in a word, every thing {{that they do not}} understand, <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>understand</b> but very little; so that almost every element, every {{uncommon}} thing, sets them a-sacrificing.|$|E
500|$|The composer's {{response}} to his denunciation was the Fifth Symphony of 1937, which was musically more conservative than his earlier works. Premiered on 21 November 1937 in Leningrad, it was a phenomenal success. The Fifth drove many to tears and welling emotions. Later, Shostakovich's purported memoir, Testimony, stated: [...] "I'll never believe {{that a man who}} understood nothing could feel the Fifth Symphony. Of course <b>they</b> <b>understood,</b> <b>they</b> <b>understood</b> what was happening around them <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>understood</b> what the Fifth was about." ...|$|R

5000|$|Although the {{district}} he {{represented in the}} state legislature included a large number of voters who were union members or on food stamps, Schock said, [...] "I could vote against things like the raising minimum wage … and go back and explain to them why it didn't make sense to raise the cost of labor ... <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>understood</b> it.|$|R

[...] The brother and sister were talking in French, and she spoke now almost as rapidly as she had written. [...] "They are beasts and fools, and as awkward as bulls--yes, as bulls. I hate them--I hate them all. Men, women, children, they are all alike. Look at the street out there. Though it is Summer, I shiver when I look out at its blackness.

5000|$|It {{was hoped}} that regular social contact would improve Mustafa's mental health, but his {{behavior}} remained eccentric.

6000|$|The Consul inquired {{whether he}} had met any compatriots at that famous place. The {{military}} travellers answered that they had not; but that Lord Bohun's yacht was there; <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>understood</b> his lordship was about to proceed to this island. The conversation for some time then dwelt upon Lord Bohun, and his adventures, eccentricities, and wealth. But Captain Ormsby finally pronounced 'Bohun a devilish good fellow.' ...|$|R

6000|$|Lemuel did {{not mind}} all this; he talked through his nose too; and he {{accepted}} Mrs. Harmon's smooth characterisation of her guests, as she called them, which she delivered in a slow, unimpassioned voice. [...] "I never have any but the highest class people in my house--the very nicest; and I never have any jangling going on. In the first place I never allow anybody {{to have anything to}} complain of, and then if they do complain, I'm right up and down with them; I tell them their rooms are wanted, <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>understand</b> what I mean. And I never allow any trouble among the servants; I tell them, if they are not suited, that I don't want them to stay; and if they get to quarrelling among themselves, I send them all away, and get a new lot; I pay the highest wages, and I can always do it. If you want {{to keep up with the}} times at all, you have got to set a good table, and I mean to set just as good a table as any in Boston; I don't intend to let any one complain of my house on that score. Well, it's as broad as it's long: if you set a good table, you can ask a good price; and if you don't, you can't, that's all. Pay as you go, is my motto." ...|$|E
