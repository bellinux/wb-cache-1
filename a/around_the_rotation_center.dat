We show that this problem is NP-hard, even if the order of orbits <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>rotation</b> <b>center</b> or along the re ection axis is xed.

From this result, we can derive an O(m logm) crossing minimization algorithm for symmetries with an orbit graph that is a path. ...|$|E

30|$|In this paper, {{we present}} a {{detailed}} analysis on the performance degradation of inverse synthetic aperture radar (ISAR) imagery with the polar format algorithm (PFA) due to <b>the</b> inaccurate <b>rotation</b> <b>center.</b> And a novel algorithm is developed to estimate <b>the</b> <b>rotation</b> <b>center</b> for ISAR targets to overcome the degradation. In real ISAR scenarios, <b>the</b> real <b>rotation</b> <b>center</b> shift is usually not coincided with the gravity center of the high-resolution range profile (HRRP), due to the data-driven translational motion compensation. Because of the imprecise information of <b>rotation</b> <b>center,</b> PFA image yields model errors and severe blurring in the cross-range direction. To tackle this problem, an improved PFA based on integrated cubic phase function (ICPF) is proposed.

40|$|Abstract Background Aseptic {{loosening}} {{is one of}} {{the greatest}} problems in hip replacement surgery. <b>The</b> <b>rotation</b> <b>center</b> of <b>the</b> hip is believed to influence the longevity of fixation. The aim of this study was to compare the influence of cemented and cementless cup fixation techniques on the position of <b>the</b> <b>center</b> of <b>rotation</b> because cemented cup fixation requires the removal of more bone for solid fixation than the cementless technique. Methods We retrospectively compared pre- and post-operative positions of <b>the</b> hip <b>rotation</b> <b>center</b> in 25 and 68 patients who underwent artificial hip replacements in our department in 2007 using cemented or cementless cup fixation, respectively, with digital radiographic image analysis. Results The mean horizontal and vertical distances between <b>the</b> <b>rotation</b> <b>center</b> and <b>the</b> acetabular teardrop were compared in radiographic images taken pre- and post-operatively. The mean horizontal difference was − 2. 63 mm (range: - 11. 00 mm to 10. 46 mm, standard deviation 4. 23 mm) for patients who underwent cementless fixation, and − 2. 84 mm (range: - 10. 87 to 5. 30 mm, standard deviation 4. 59 mm) for patients who underwent cemented fixation. The mean vertical difference was 0. 60 mm (range: - 20. 15 mm to 10. 00 mm, standard deviation 3. 93 mm) and 0. 41 mm (range: - 9. 26 mm to 6. 54 mm, standard deviation 3. 58 mm) for the cementless and cemented fixation groups, respectively. The two fixation techniques had no significant difference on the position of <b>the</b> hip <b>rotation</b> <b>center</b> in <b>the</b> 93 patients in this study. Conclusions <b>The</b> hip <b>rotation</b> <b>center</b> was similarly restored using either the cemented or cementless fixation techniques in this patient cohort, indicating that the fixation technique itself does not interfere with the position of <b>the</b> <b>center</b> of <b>rotation.</b> To completely answer this question further studies with more patients are needed. </p...|$|R

Ventricular tachycardia (VT) induced in the presence of bepridil (1 µM) terminated earlier than in the control. Bepridil increased action potential duration (APD) by 5 % - 8 % under constant pacing and significantly increased the space constant. There was a linear relationship between the wavefront curvature (κ) and local conduction velocity: LCV = LCV₀ - D·κ (D, diffusion coefficient; LCV₀, LCV at κ = 0).

40|$|Introduction: Total hip {{replacement}} {{is one of}} the most-often performed surgeries in Germany, accounting for 214, 000 interventions annually. The information about the leg length and the position of <b>the</b> hip <b>rotation</b> <b>center</b> is an important quality criterion to reconstruct healthy hip joint biomechanics. Leg length differences caused by the surgery can lead to functional restrictions and to the necessity for revision surgeries. The distance between the center of the femoral head and the foot standing surface (hip joint centered leg length) can only be estimated with a low accuracy (inaccuracy > 20, 0 mm) without using computed tomography, until now. Objectives: The aim {{of the study was to}} develop a measurement system to calculate objectively leg length as well as the position of <b>the</b> <b>rotation</b> <b>center</b> of <b>the</b> hip joint with an accuracy of less than 5 mm, allowing to position the hip implant with at a high accuracy. Methods: The measurement system included two LEDs being located in a plastic box as well as an inertial sensor for the measurement of angles. An external camera detects the light spots of the LED. The system is connected to the computer via a USB port. Furthermore, a Labview –based software was created to calculate the leg length and <b>the</b> hip <b>rotation</b> <b>center.</b> For future measurements in the OR, the system will be positioned with a nonslip seating on the upper side of the patient’s tibia. During the surgery the leg is lifted hyper extended by the surgeon at the heel. On basis of the sensor movement the hip joint centered leg length and <b>the</b> hip <b>rotation</b> <b>center</b> is calculated. <b>The</b> first measurement hast to be performed before surgery, the second one intraoperatively after hip joint test implantation. If differences are recognized between the measured values, the hip implant can be readjusted with the help of a modular implant until the reconstruction of the original biomechanics. In order to evaluate the technical accuracy a technical system was developed to simulate the movement of the human leg in all directions. For that, an artificial leg was mounted with a ball joint on a metal plate (leg length= 395, 0 mm). The technical accuracy was evaluated repeatedly with a sample number of 30. Results: A measurement system was developed to demonstrate the feasibility of measuring leg length and the position of <b>the</b> hip <b>rotation</b> <b>center</b> objectively. <b>The</b> result of the technical accuracy of the leg length measurements in the test setup was 393. 6 ± 2. 0 mm (setpoint value= 395. 0 mm), with minimum and maximum values of = 396. 9 mm and = 389. 9 mm, respectively. Conclusions: The technical accuracy of the system allows precise measurements of leg length and can therefore be a support in total hip arthroplasty, providing an objective tool for quality assurance. Until now the distance between the center of the femoral head and the center of the sensor case could already be calculated within a technical test setup. A follow-up evaluation of the clinical accuracy will be performed in clinical trials. The next step will be the development of a device for positioning the sensor case at a defined location at the patient’s tibia in relation to the foot standing surface. Doing so would allow obtaining information about the total distance between the hip joint head center and the foot standing surface. Additionally, a second camera will have to be included to calculate the three-dimensional coordinates of <b>the</b> hip <b>rotation</b> <b>center...</b>|$|R

METODOS: Realizamos um estudo não randomizado comparativo prospectivo, com 64 pacientes submetidos a artroplastia total do quadril com o acesso minimamente invasivo posterior, realizado por um único cirurgião. Todos os pacientes incluídos no estudo apresentavam migração superior e lateral do centro de rotação do quadril em comparação com o quadril contralateral. Os critérios de exclusão foram: fratura do colo femoral, quadris displásicos tipos 2, 3 e 4 segundo a classificação de Crowe e osteoartrose do quadril contralateral. Entre os 64 pacientes, 39 apresentaram um planejamento acetabular radiográfico igual ou menor que 50 mm e 25 pacientes igual ou maior que 52 mm. Consideramos bom resultado os seguintes quesitos: inclinação acetabular entre 35 e 50 graus, componente acetabular coincidente com a estimativa pré-operatória com contato nas três zonas de DeLee e Charnley, abaixamento e medialização do centro de rotação em relação as medidas pré-operatórias e uma discrepância final do membro menor que 10 mm. RESULTADOS: Uma melhor restauração do centro de rotação foi observada nos pacientes com componentes acetabulares iguais ou menores que 50, p= 0. 04. Devemos destacar duas situações de risco ao usarmos o acesso minimamente invasivo posterior: colocação do componente acetabular em posição vertical ou lateral devido a preparo e fresagem insuficientes do osso hospedeiro, com piora do contato do implante na zona 1 acetabular.
