40|$|Perceptual {{resolution}} and crosstalk of active and passive stereoscopic 3 D displays are evaluated by subjective tests. Test patterns of gratings with various contrast and spatial frequencies {{are used to}} determine the contrast thresholds, from which the contrast sensitivity of human visual systems is obtained. Perceptual resolution tests show that viewers can perceive the highest vertical frequency on <b>active</b> <b>displays,</b> but not on passive displays. However, the contrast sensitivity is higher for passive <b>displays</b> than <b>active</b> <b>displays</b> for all other frequencies. Viewers can perceive frequency components with lower contrast, except for the highest frequency, more easily on passive <b>displays</b> than on <b>active</b> <b>displays.</b> Perceptual crosstalk tests show that interocular crosstalk is a function of spatial frequency.

40|$|Spatially aware {{tangible}} displays are {{a promising}} approach for extending the interaction space of conventional tabletops from the 2 D surface to the 3 D physical space above it. This {{is achieved by}} utilizing the position and orientation of lightweight tracked displays, which allows for a natural and intuitive way to interact with complex information spaces. Technical solutions for such systems already exist in research labs. However, they usually are expensive, complex, and difficult to maintain and thus are inappropriate for a broad audience. With our work, we want to address this issue. In a long term, we envision a low-cost tangible display system that supports both <b>active</b> <b>displays</b> (e. g., the iPad) and passive displays (e. g., paper screens and everyday objects such as a mug). In this paper, we take the initial step into this direction by presenting a proof of concept system that supports <b>active</b> <b>displays.</b> Along with {{the application of a}} consumer depth camera (Kinect), this reduces the costs by more than an order of magnitude...|$|R

50|$|The {{characteristic}} {{three white}} stripes on the abdomen of male P. mellyi {{plays an important}} role in determining wasp behavior in both intra- and intersexual contexts of the species; the armament-ornament model proposes that the presence of ornaments (in this case, the <b>active</b> <b>display</b> of three white stripes) to be seen as a status badge that is used for both male-to-male competition and courtships for future mates.During patrol activity over its hover sites, male P. mellyi openly displays its three white stripes on its tergites by fully distending its abdomen. A positive correlation has been found between elicited stripe display and mating success: male individuals who displayed their stripes the most, not simply the most active ones, were the individuals who had the highest chance of mating with females. This kind of mating success via the stripes display, however, comes with a cost: According to a stripe manipulation study, when an extra stripe was added, the frequency of the attacks received by the male rival had doubled. In fact, winner males of aerial duels frequently displayed their stripes. Therefore, while stripes were indicators of strength in aerial duels, this sort of status badge was also attractive to females, as predicted by the Armament-Ornament Model.|$|E

5000|$|In the Champions League, Inter limped {{into the}} second round after losing its final two group stage matches against Panathinaikos and Werder Bremen. In the first {{elimination}} round (round of 18), they lost to Manchester United in a hard-fought tie. Stanković played the full 90 minutes in the first leg at San Siro, putting in a very lively and <b>active</b> <b>display.</b> In the return at Old Trafford, Stanković started the match and had a great first half 37th minute effort after playing a one-two with Ibrahimović, and striking the ball with the outside of his boot from some 25 metres out, only to see it go centimeters wide of Edwin van der Sar's right post. Two minutes later, Stanković had another glorious opportunity when he got in behind Patrice Evra on the right, as Ibrahimović picked him out with a cross from the left, but the Serb did not make good enough contact with {{the ball in the}} one-on-one situation with Van der Sar, and the shot therefore went over the bar. In the 57th minute, with United leading 2-0, and Inter forced to chase the result, Mourinho took Stanković off and inserted striker Adriano.

5000|$|The {{designers}} of the C128 succeeded in addressing {{most of these}} concerns. A new chip, the VDC, provides the C128 with an 80-column color CGA-compatible display (also called RGBI for red-green-blue plus intensity). The then-new 8502 microprocessor is completely backward-compatible with the C64's 6510, but can run at double the speed if desired. The C64's BASIC 2.0 was replaced with BASIC 7.0, which includes structured programming commands from the Plus/4's BASIC 3.5, as well as keywords designed specifically {{to take advantage of}} the machine's capabilities. A sprite editor and machine language monitor were added. The screen-editor part of the Kernal was further improved to support an insert mode and other features accessed through ESC-key combinations, as well as a rudimentary windowing feature, and was relocated to a separate ROM. The VIC-II chip which controls the 40-column display can only operate at 1 MHz, so the 40-column display appears jumbled in FAST mode. In 80-column mode the editor takes advantage of VDC features to provide blinking and underlined text, activated through escape codes, in addition to the standard Commodore reverse text. The C128's 80-column mode can display lowercase characters along with PETSCII graphics characters; 40-column mode is subject to the same [...] "upper- and lowercase" [...] or [...] "uppercase-plus-graphics" [...] restriction as earlier Commodores. The 40- and 80-column modes are independent and both can be active at the same time. A programmer with both a composite and RGB display can use one of the screens as a [...] "scratchpad" [...] or for rudimentary multiple buffer support. The <b>active</b> <b>display</b> can be switched with ESC-X. A hardware reset button was added to the system. The keyboard, however, was not switched to the Selectric layout as had become standard, instead retaining the same ADM-3A-derived design as on Commodore's prior models.|$|E

40|$|Vibro-tactile {{displays}} convey messages {{by presenting}} vibration to the user's skin. In recent years, {{the interest in}} and application of vibro-tactile displays is growing. Vibratory displays are introduced in mobile devices, desktop applications and even in aircraft [1]. Despite the growing interest, guidelines {{on the design of}} vibro-tactile displays are still lacking.

40|$|The {{active matrix}} {{liquid crystal display}} (AMLCD) has become the {{preferred}} flight instrument technology in avionics multifunction display applications.
