40|$|It is {{generally}} agreed that constructions of the form “if P, Q ” are capable of conveying {{a number of different}} relations between antecedent and consequent, with pragmatics playing a central role in determining these relations. Controversy concerns what the conventional contribution of the if-clause is, how it constrains the pragmatic processes, and what those processes are. In this essay, I begin to argue that the conventional contribution of if-clauses to semantics is exhausted by the fact that these clauses introduce a proposition without presenting it as true so that the consequent can be understood in relation to it. Given our cognitive interests in such non-truth-presentational introductions, conditionals will make salient the wide but nevertheless disciplined variety of contents that we naturally attribute to them; no further substantial constraints of the sorts proposed by standard theories of conditionals are needed to explain the phenomena. If this is correct, it provides prima facie evidence for a radically contextualist account of conditionals according to which conditionals have no truth-evaluable or intuitively complete content absent some contextually provided, sufficiently salient relation between antecedent and consequent. 2. The challenge: Making sense of great but restricted variation As illustrated by the following list, if-conditionals are capable of conveying a wide variety of relations between the antecedent (the content represented by the if-clause), and the consequent (the content represented by the main clause) : (1) If <b>you</b> <b>are</b> really <b>hungry,</b> <b>you</b> will have a hard time concentrating. (2) If <b>you</b> <b>are</b> really <b>hungry,</b> <b>you</b> didn’t eat enough. (3) If <b>you</b> <b>are</b> really <b>hungry,</b> <b>you</b> should order something else...|$|R

50|$|In {{interrogative}} main clauses, {{unless the}} subject is or contains the interrogative word, the verb precedes the subject: <b>Are</b> <b>you</b> <b>hungry?</b> Where am I? (but Who did this?, without inversion, since the interrogative who is itself the subject). However such inversion is only possible with an auxiliary or copular verb; if no such verb would otherwise be present, do-support is used.|$|E

Youth in Oregon were introduced to the issue through the role playing simulation, <b>Are</b> <b>You</b> <b>Hungry</b> Tonight? The simulation was utilized with youth, adult volunteers, and youth development staff. Participants indicated increased understanding of people with limited resources, including: Financial pressures, emotional stresses and frustrations they face; Difficulty of improving one’s situation; Difficult choices people make; Positive and negative impacts of community organizations. Simulation participants developed an understanding of hunger issues and empathy for people experiencing food insecurity. Participants were subsequently challenged to complete service learning projects that would help provide additional food resources for their communities. Providing education through the simulation set the stage for youth to participate fully in service learning projects to help alleviate hunger...|$|E
40|$|All {{plant and}} animal life {{is made up of}} cells, which form tissues that compose the organs and organ systems of a living organism. The food we eat is digested in the {{gastrointestinal}} tract and its nutrients are absorbed into the body. Hormones released into the blood and enzymes released into the gastrointestinal tract facilitate the digestion of food and the absorption of nutrients. Digestion begins in the mouth. Food is then swallowed and moves down the esophagus to the stomach for storage and further digestion. The small intestine is the primary site of digestion and absorption. Water-soluble materials are absorbed into the blood. Most fat-soluble materials are absorbed into the lymph. Changes in the gastrointestinal tract can alter digestion and absorption and affect nutritional status. Nutrients delivered to the cells can be used to produce energy in the form of ATP and to synthesize molecules for immediate use or for storage. Materials that are not absorbed pass into the large intestine and are excreted in feces. The waste products generated inside the body by metabolism are eliminated via the lungs, skin, and kidneys. Why does your mouth water at the sight or smell of food? Why <b>are</b> <b>you</b> <b>hungry</b> very soon after eating some meals while others stick with you longer?
