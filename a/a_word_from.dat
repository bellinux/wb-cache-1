25|$|Psycholinguistics views TOT {{states as}} a failure of {{retrieval}} from lexical memory (see Cohort Model) being cued by semantic memory (facts). Since there is an observed increase {{in the frequency of}} TOT states with age, there are two mechanisms within psycholinguistics that could account for the TOT phenomenon. The first is the degradation of lexical networks with age, where degrading connections between the priming of knowledge and vocabulary increases difficulty of successfully retrieving <b>a</b> <b>word</b> <b>from</b> memory. The second suggests that the culmination of knowledge, experience, and vocabulary with age results in a similar situation where many connections between a diverse vocabulary and diverse knowledge also increases the difficulty of successful retrieval of <b>a</b> <b>word</b> <b>from</b> memory.|$|E

25|$|It once {{happened}} in that country (and this seems indeed strange) that a living creature {{was caught in the}} forest as to which no one could say definitely whether it was a man or some other animal; for no one could get <b>a</b> <b>word</b> <b>from</b> it or be sure that it understood human speech. It had the human shape, however, in every detail, both as to hands and face and feet; but the entire body was covered with hair as the beasts are, and down the back it had a long coarse mane like that of a horse, which fell to both sides and trailed along the ground when the creature stooped in walking.|$|E
25|$|To {{determine}} if infants were {{picking up on}} the statistical information, each infant was presented with multiple presentations of either <b>a</b> <b>word</b> <b>from</b> the artificial grammar or a nonword {{made up of the}} same syllables but presented in a random order. Infants who were presented with nonwords during the test phase listened significantly longer to these words than infants who were presented with words from the artificial grammar, showing a novelty preference for these new nonwords. However, the implementation of the test could also be due to infants learning serial-order information and not to actually learning transitional probabilities between words. That is, at test, infants heard strings such as dapiku and tilado that were never presented during learning; they could simply have learned that the syllable ku never followed the syllable pi.|$|E
25|$|Variations in {{vocabulary}} also occur: {{for example}} the dialect word for ant in East Cornwall is emmet which is of Old English etymology, whereas in West Cornwall the word muryan is used. This is <b>a</b> <b>word</b> <b>from</b> the Cornish language spelt in the revived language (in Kernewek Kemmyn dictionaries) as muryon. There is also this pair, meaning the weakest pig of a litter: nestle-bird (sometimes nestle-drish) in East Cornwall, and (piggy-)whidden in West Cornwall. Whidden may derive from Cornish byghan (small), or gwynn (white, Late Cornish gwydn). Further, there is pajerpaw vs a four-legged emmet in West and mid-Cornwall respectively. It may {{be noted that the}} Cornish word for the number four is peswar (Late Cornish pajar). For both of these Cornish language etymologies, sound changes within the Cornish language itself between the Middle Cornish, and Late Cornish periods are in evidence.|$|E

500|$|Squash was domesticated first, {{followed}} by maize and then beans, {{becoming part of}} the Three Sisters agricultural system of companion planting. The English word [...] "squash" [...] derives from askutasquash (a green thing eaten raw), <b>a</b> <b>word</b> <b>from</b> the Narragansett language, which was documented by Roger Williams, the founder of Rhode Island, in his 1643 publication A Key Into the Language of America. Similar words for squash exist in related languages of the Algonquian family.|$|E
500|$|Gumbo is a stew {{popular in}} the U.S. state of Louisiana, and that state's {{official}} state cuisine. [...] It may have originated in southern Louisiana during the 18th century, possibly as a stew of the Choctaws served over corn grits. Gumbo consists primarily of a strongly-flavored stock, meat or shellfish, a thickener, and what Louisianians call the [...] "Holy Trinity" [...] of vegetables, namely celery, bell peppers, and onions. Gumbo is often categorized {{by the type of}} thickener used, the okra, the filé powder (dried and ground sassafras leaves), or roux, the French base made of flour and fat. The dish likely derived its name from either <b>a</b> <b>word</b> <b>from</b> a Bantu language for okra (ki ngombo) or the Choctaw word for filé (kombo).|$|E

500|$|Andrade's final {{project was}} a long poem called [...] "Meditação Sôbre o Tietê." [...] The work is dense and difficult, and was {{dismissed}} by its early critics as [...] "without meaning", although recent work on {{it has been more}} enthusiastic. [...] One critic, David T Haberly, has compared it favorably to William Carlos Williams's Paterson, a dense but influential unfinished epic using composite construction. [...] Like Paterson, it is a poem about a city; the [...] "Meditação" [...] is centered on the Tietê River, which flows through São Paulo. [...] The poem is simultaneously a summation of Andrade's career, commenting on poems written long before, and a love poem addressed to the river and to the city itself. [...] In both cases, the poem hints at a larger context: it compares the river to the Tagus in Lisbon and the Seine in Paris, as if claiming an international position for Andrade as well. [...] At the same time, the poem associates both Andrade's voice and the river with [...] "banzeiro," [...] <b>a</b> <b>word</b> <b>from</b> the Afro-Brazilian musical tradition: music that can unite man and river. [...] The poem is the definitive and final statement of Andrade's ambition and his nationalism.|$|E
500|$|Mark Robson was {{strongly}} considered {{and was in}} talks to direct, but after seeing The Omen, the producers hired Richard Donner. Donner had previously been planning [...] when he was hired in January 1977 for $1million to direct Superman and Superman II. Donner felt {{it was best to}} start from scratch. [...] "They had prepared the picture for a year and not one bit was useful to me." [...] Donner was dissatisfied with the campy script and brought in Tom Mankiewicz to perform a rewrite. According to Mankiewicz [...] "not <b>a</b> <b>word</b> <b>from</b> the Puzo script was used." [...] "It was a well-written, but still a ridiculous script. It was 550 pages. I said, 'You can't shoot this screenplay because you'll be shooting for five years'," [...] Donner continued. [...] "That was literally a shooting script and they planned to shoot all 550 pages. You know, 110 pages is plenty for a script, so even for two features, that was way too much." [...] Mankiewicz conceived having each Kryptonian family wear a crest resembling a different letter, justifying the 'S' on Superman's costume. The Writers Guild of America refused to credit Mankiewicz for his rewrites, so Donner gave him a creative consultant credit, much to the annoyance of the Guild.|$|E
500|$|Under the {{doctrine}} of [...] "foreign equivalents," [...] a foreign language term used in a foreign country, that is considered generic in that country, cannot be imported into the United States and used as a trademark. In applying {{the doctrine}}, the courts consistently refer to two policy rationales. The first rationale, [...] "the doctrine serves the interests of domestic competition":"Because {{of the diversity of}} the population of the United States, coupled with temporary visitors, all of whom are part of the United States marketplace, commerce in the United States utilizes innumerable foreign languages. No merchant may obtain the exclusive right over a trademark registration if that exclusivity would prevent competitors from designating a product as what it is in the language their customers know best." [...] Otokoyama Co. Ltd. Vs Wine of Japan Import Inc.The second rationale, [...] "the doctrine serves the interests of international comity":"Because United States companies would be hamstrung in international trade if foreign countries granted trademark protection to generic English words, the United States reciprocates and refuses trademark protection to generic foreign words." [...] Enrique Bernat F., S.A. v. Guadalajara, Inc.However, the Trademark Manual of Examining Procedure ("TMEP") states that the test for applying {{the doctrine of}} foreign equivalents is [...] "whether, to those American buyers familiar with the foreign language, the word would denote its English equivalent".The Trademark Trial and Appeal Board has, for the purposes of the guide, ruled that an [...] "ordinary American purchaser" [...] refers to the [...] "significant portion of consumers" [...] who speak both English and the relevant foreign language. In the case In re Joint Stock Co. [...] "Baik ," [...] 80 USPQ2d 1305, 1310, 0.22% was accepted as a significant portion of consumers in the United States. Thus the doctrine is generally interpreted by courts as not applying if the generic word is not <b>a</b> <b>word</b> <b>from</b> a foreign language, but one from an English-speaking foreign country.|$|E

2500|$|Each {{episode of}} Arthur runs {{for half an}} hour. Episodes usually consist of two {{completely}} self-contained 11-minute stories. The episodes start off {{with one of the}} characters (usually Arthur) speaking towards the audience about a situation within the story followed by the title card. The episodes are separated by a one- to two-minute live-action interstitial called [...] "And Now <b>a</b> <b>Word</b> <b>from</b> Us Kids" [...] (or, in some cases, a permutation of that title more specific to its contents). The live-action segments almost always feature children from elementary schools (generally in the Boston area) presenting subjects they are currently learning about or projects they have been working on in their classes (the subjects covered here relate to the first cartoon segment in the half-hour). This segment is seen exclusively on PBS telecasts of the show, filling space otherwise used for commercials, which are generally forbidden on PBS. There is also a segment that sometimes appears {{at the end of the}} second 11-minute episode called [...] "And Now <b>a</b> <b>Word</b> <b>from</b> Marc Brown" [...] where he shows the viewers how to draw various main characters from the show. In 2007, the show began encouraging viewers to send in [...] "video postcards" [...] (similar to those used in the spin-off show Postcards from Buster), which were shown in the interstitials of episodes until the middle of Season 12.
