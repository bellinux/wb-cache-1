The construction bureau turned {{over control of the}} railroad, and the coal mine, to the Hokkaidō Government Office in January 1886. The following year, the two were split into separate offices, and the railroad began to be administered from Temiya instead of Sapporo, but {{before the end of the}} year, the Horonai Railway came to be contracted by the head of the Rails & Coal Mine Office, Murata Tsutsumi, to aid in the completion of the Ikunshunbetsu Line. This operation would not be profitable for the Horonai Railway, but Murata took these risks on himself, and explained to the Hokkaidō Government Office that this work was necessary in order to get the Ikushunbetsu coal mine operational, and that initial expenditures were necessary in such a venture. He hoped the expenses could be compensated for somewhat by the rents and taxes paid by the citizenry. Murata's scheme was approved in 1888, and he formed the Hokuyūsha (Northern Property Company) to manage the railroad contracts. For the next fifteen years, the Hokuyūsha paid the Horonai Railroad 5000 yen every year in return for using their trains and rails, and took on the responsibility of maintenance and all other fees; this revived the railroad's revenues.|$|E

In turn, the London Civic Centre Corporation is in a 50-year participatory occupancy lease with the City of London Arena Trust. The London Civic Centre Corporation maintains the sports-entertainment centre {{and is on the}} hook for improvements, but they also have a facility fee on tickets to accumulate money for those improvements and they have a confidential agreement with Global Spectrum to manage the facility. While the City of London may take slight annual profits, which are dashed by the annual debt payments, those don't include further costs such as maintaining parking and Jubilee Square in front of the sports-entertainment centre. From years one to five, the city's share of net profit was 20% and increased to 45% in years six to 10 then 70% for years 11 to 50. The private aspect <b>anticipated</b> <b>profit</b> returns of about 12% with City of London staff estimating the city's return on investment would be between 1 and 2%. Though it sounds financially beneficial to the City of London long-term, especially given the increase in profits after the 11th year, events filling the sports-entertainment centre nearly every other day during the year and City of London revenue averaging about $650,000 annually between 2011 and 2014, the risk far outweighs the rewards. Though sports-entertainment centres have a serviceable life of 40 to 60 years, in recent years that has shrunk to 20 to 30 years before teams or municipalities begin demanding new arenas. The City of London also has the option of exercising an early and zero termination fee during {{the first six months of}} the 21st fiscal period (year). The existence of that clause and the possibility of others among several of the mostly secret agreements in accordance with the sports-entertainment centre would leave the City of London in complete control of all financial and operational costs. It is unlikely the City of London would enact the clause due to the nature of maintaining an aging sports-entertainment centre that would need capital repairs.

40|$|While {{estimating}} parametric {{production models}} with risk, one faces two main problems. The first problem {{is associated with}} the choice of functional forms on the mean production function and the risk (variance) function. The second problem {{is associated with the}} specification of the risk preference function. In a parametric model the researcher chooses some ad hoc functional form on all these. It is obvious that the estimated (i) technology (mean production function), (ii) risk and (iii) risk preference functions are affected by the choice of functional form. In this paper we consider an estimation framework that avoids assuming parametric functions on all three. In particular, this paper deals with nonparametric estimation of the technology, risk and risk preferences of producers when they face uncertainty in production. Uncertainty is modeled in the context of production theory where producers’ maximize expected utility of <b>anticipated</b> <b>profit.</b> A multi-stage nonparametric estimation procedure is used to estimate the production function, the output risk function and the risk preference function. No distributional assumption is made on the random term representing production uncertainty. No functional form is assumed on the underlying utility function.

Rice farmers are, in general, found to be risk averse; labor is risk decreasing while fertilizer, land and materials are risk increasing. The mean risk premium is about 3 % of mean profit...|$|E

40|$|The main {{objective}} of "CedABio" was {{to estimate the}} environmental and socioeconomic benefits anticipated in the bovine farming systems adopting an organic production mode. Beyond some obvious advantages, {{the goal was to}} measure and ascertain the real contributions of a change to organic farming for the dairy and beef farms. To lead this assessment, strong and technically accessible indicators were selected, tested, and then looked for in 144 livestock farms, located in varied contexts to take into account territorial diversity. Half of the farms were in organic mode. Their results are compared with the other half producing in conventional mode, situated in the same zones, with similar structures. The results and the observations performed in this network of commercial farms are completed by additional measures on two experimental farms in organic production in the INRA station of Mirecourt in J. Pavie et al. 28 Innovations Agronomiques 30 (2013), 27 - 40 dairy production and in Thorigné d’Anjou in beef production.

40|$|This {{research}} critically {{analyses and}} compares how the United Arab Emirates (UAE) 1 Law and English and Welsh (EW) Law regulates obligations in a contract, for {{a thing that}} is to come into existence in the future, namely a construction contract. Uncertainty/speculation as to how an obligation is to be performed in UAE Law is termed gharar. The word that is synonymous with this terminology in EW Law is “risk”. The extent of gharar or ‘risk’ (these terms are used on an interchangeable basis in this thesis) in an obligation plays {{a fundamental role in}} the profitability of a construction contract. Where losses become unacceptable, particularly for the Contractor, a dispute will arise. These circumstances may be in conflict with UAE Law, which obligates parties to a contract to ensure circulation of wealth by maintaining the <b>anticipated</b> <b>profit</b> to be made from a contract. This analysis also reviews how the level of gharar or ‘risk’ can be increased by operation of two types of provision that are included in standard forms of construction contract such as the International Federation of Consulting Engineers, Geneva, Switzerland (FIDIC) Conditions of Contract for Construction for Building and Engineering Works Designed by the Employer 1 st Ed. 1999 (FIDIC 99). The first is a provision that releases the Employer from liability where the Contractor does not give timely notice of an Employer’s act of prevention. The second is a provision giving the Employer a discretion to act in an opportunistic manner, and exempt or limit his liability. It considers how FIDIC 99 should be applied to control gharar or ‘risk’ in a positive way. It also identifies similarities between how UAE Law controls gharar and that of the notion of parties’ reasonable expectations in contract Law (herein referred to as parties’ expectations), and how relational contracts operate to ensure parties achieve their expectations...|$|E
40|$|The {{conversion}} {{of natural and}} agriculturally dominated watersheds to industrial, commercial and residential developments leads to a cascade of adjustments in runoff quantity and stream quality at locations further downstream. The use of sophisticated hydrologic simulation models and Geographic Information Systems (GIS) has become the standard for evaluating these impacts of urban sprawl on water resources systems. Simulation and GIS models alone, however, are incapable of directly revealing optimal land development patterns that meet specified objectives. This paper describes {{the development of a}} multi-objective Spatial Decision Support System (SDSS) designed to overcome this limitation. The SDSS is created by integrating the U. S. Department of Agriculture’s Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) for comprehensive hydrologic simulation, a GIS for generating input and visualizing output, and a genetic algorithm (GA) for identifying weighted, optimal land use patterns. In addition to the GA, future research will involve the integration of a second search mechanism, the artificial life algorithm, to verify optimal results. The optimal landscape is that which minimizes sediment yield in subsequent streams, while simultaneously maximizing approximate <b>anticipated</b> <b>profit</b> from urban development. The SDSS could be a useful visualization tool for land use managers and watershed management institutions in planning new developments. The SDSS has been tested on the Lower Kaskaskia watershed, located in the Metro East area of southwestern Illinois.
