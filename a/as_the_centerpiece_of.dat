5|$|For years {{leading up}} to the {{creation}} of the park, the leading citizens and newspapers in Albany had pushed for a grand public park. Frederick Law Olmsted's Olmsted, Vaux and Company was hired in 1869 to plan such a park. In their plan they envisioned Washington Park <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>centerpiece</b> <b>of</b> a string of parks and boulevards similar to those they had designed in Buffalo, Boston, and Brooklyn. Though Olmsted and his company was not involved in the actual design of the park, their broad vision was followed for the detailed designs, including the idea of damming the Beaver Kill (Beaver Creek) to form a grand lake.|$|E

In 443 BC, {{the office}} of Censor was created, and in 367 BC, Plebeians were allowed to stand for the Consulship. The opening of the Consulship to the Plebeian class implicitly opened both the Censorship {{as well as the}} Dictatorship to Plebeians. In 366 BC, in an effort by the Patricians to reassert their {{influence}} over the magisterial offices, two new offices were created. While these two offices, the Praetorship and the Curule Aedileship, were at first open only to Patricians, within a generation, they were open to Plebeians as well.|$|E

5|$|Prior to the 2005–06 season, Bosh {{was named}} {{as one of}} Toronto's team captains. Bosh {{continued}} {{to work on his}} game as he consistently chalked up double doubles, leading the team in scoring, rebounding, and field goal percentage {{for the first half of}} the season. On February 9, 2006, for the first time in his career, Bosh was selected to play in the 2006 NBA All-Star Game in Houston, Texas as a reserve forward for the Eastern Conference. He was only the third Raptor to make an All-Star game, after Carter and Antonio Davis. Bosh's selection was just three days after he was named NBA Eastern Conference Player of the Week for the second time in his career. In March 2006, following a season-ending injury to Bosh, the Raptors hit a 1–10 skid. This highlighted Bosh's importance <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>centerpiece</b> <b>of</b> the offense, as well as the leader of the team. The Raptors finished the season 27–55 and Bosh averaged 22.5 points, 9.2 rebounds, and 2.6 assists per game.|$|E

25|$|The {{proposed}} relocation was controversial, {{and although}} some welcomed the proposal, {{most people were}} against moving the landmark fountain. Opponents stated that since the fountain has an underground system of passages, {{it is impossible to}} move it without destroying and rebuilding it, and the fountain might not work at all if moved. Concerns were also raised that the Triton figures would be damaged if they were to be moved. In December 2011, Minister Austin Gatt announced that the fountain will not be moved, and after restoration it will serve <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>centerpiece</b> <b>of</b> Piano's redesigned entrance to Valletta.|$|E

5000|$|In {{the late}} 1800s to the 1910s {{a period of}} {{nationalism}} and interest in Nordic symbols resulted in the Art Nouveau variant National romanticism which is well represented in Aarhus.

Aarhus Custom House from 1898, the former State Library from 1902 and Aarhus Theatre from 1900 stand <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>centerpieces</b> <b>of</b> National Romantic architecture in Aarhus. The Marselisborg Palace from 1902 is also a prominent example of the National Romantic style although the overall layout of the facade bears some resemblance to classicism.

Robbins moved the #12 locomotive back to its native Blue Ridge Mountains <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>centerpiece</b> <b>of</b> a new “Tweetsie Railroad“ tourist attraction. One mile of track was constructed near Blowing Rock, North Carolina for the train to run on, and on July 4, 1957, the locomotive made its first public trip over the line. In 1958, the track was extended to a 3-mile loop around the mountain, and the trains at Tweetsie have traveled that loop ever since. Grover Robbins' brothers, Harry and Spencer, were also involved with the operation of Tweetsie Railroad, and the park is still operated by the Robbins family.|$|E
25|$|Lake Nockamixon is an {{artificial}} reservoir formed by a dam on Tohickon Creek and serves <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>centerpiece</b> <b>of</b> Nockamixon State Park.

Fishing is also popular, and common species include walleye, pickerel, carp, and various kinds of bass and catfish. The water is clean and blue and has a very faint current, since the lake {{is part of the}} course of Tohickon Creek, which feeds in midway along the northwestern edge of the lake and discharges at the dam at the southeast corner. Lake Nockamixon is also fed by two other creeks known as Haycock Run, which feeds in at the northernmost point, and Three Mile Run, which feeds in at the southernmost point.|$|E

40|$|In {{the early}} problem-solution era of {{software}} programming, functional decompositions were mainly used {{to design and}} implement software solutions. In functional decompositions, functions and data are introduced as two separate entities during the design phase, and are followed <b>as</b> such in <b>the</b> implementation phase. Functional decompositions make use of refactoring through optimizing the algorithms, grouping similar functionalities into common reusable functions, and using abstract representations of data where possible; all these are done during the implementation phase. This paper advocates the usage of object-oriented methodologies and design patterns <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>centerpieces</b> <b>of</b> refactoring software solutions. Refactoring software is a method of changing software design while explicitly preserving its external functionalities. The combined usage of object-oriented methodologies and design patterns to refactor should also benefit the overall software life cycle cost with improved software...|$|R
25|$|The Lab-i Hauz (or Lab-e hauz, Persian: لب حوض, meaning by the pond) Ensemble (1568–1622) is {{the name}} of the area {{surrounding}} one of the few remaining hauz, or pond, in the city of Bukhara. Several such ponds existed in Bukhara prior to Soviet rule. The ponds acted as the city's principal source of water, but were also notorious for spreading disease, and thus were mostly filled in during the 1920s and 1930s by the Soviets. The Lab-i Hauz survived owing to its role <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>centerpiece</b> <b>of</b> an architectural ensemble dating 16th-17th centuries. The Lab-i Hauz ensemble consists of the 16th century Kukeldash Madrasah, the largest in the city, along the north side of the pond. On the eastern and western sides of the pond are a 17th century lodging-house for itinerant Sufis, and a 17th century madrasah.|$|E
25|$|President Aquino envisioned agrarian {{and land}} reform <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>centerpiece</b> <b>of</b> her administration's social {{legislative}} agenda. However, her family background and social {{class as a}} privileged daughter of a wealthy and landed clan became a lightning rod of criticisms against her land reform agenda. On February 22, 1987, {{three weeks after the}} resounding ratification of the 1987 Constitution, agrarian workers and farmers marched to the historic Mendiola Street near the Malacañan Palace to demand genuine land reform from Aquino's administration. However, the march turned violent when Marine forces fired at farmers who tried to go beyond the designated demarcation line set by the police. As a result, at least 12 were killed and 51 protesters were injured in this incident now known as the Mendiola Massacre. This incident led some prominent members of the Aquino Cabinet to resign their government posts.|$|E
25|$|On September 11, 2002, Unitas died {{suddenly}} {{of a heart}} attack while working out at the Kernan Physical Therapy Center (now The University of Maryland Rehabilitation & Orthopaedic Institute) in Baltimore. After his death, many fans of the Baltimore Ravens petitioned the renaming of the Ravens' home stadium (owned by the State of Maryland) after Unitas. These requests were unsuccessful since the lucrative naming rights had already been leased by the Ravens to Buffalo-based M Bank. However, a statue of Unitas was erected <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>centerpiece</b> <b>of</b> the plaza in front of the stadium named in Unitas' honor. Large banners depicting the NFL Hall of Famer in his Baltimore Colts heyday flank the entrance to the stadium. Towson University, where Unitas was a major fund-raiser and which his children attended, named its football and lacrosse complex Johnny Unitas Stadium in recognition of both his football career and service to the university.|$|E
