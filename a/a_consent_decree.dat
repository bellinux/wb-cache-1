5|$|Judge Green {{presided over}} a number of notable cases during his 35-year tenure on the Eastern District. In Bolden v. Pennsylvania State Police Judge Green ordered the Pennsylvania State Police to {{reinstate}} William Bolden, a minority trooper who had been dismissed. The case, which began in 1973, resulted in <b>a</b> <b>consent</b> <b>decree</b> that required the State Police to hire one minority for every non-minority hired, and set additional goals for promotion and retention of minority troopers. Judge Green presided over the consent decree for 25 years, dissolving it in 1999. The case was credited with helping to abolish racism in the hiring of troopers, and integrate the State Police.|$|E

25|$|Borden {{became a}} holding company in 1929, but its {{operations}} were re-unified in 1936 and its subsidiaries became divisions. Borden and other dairy companies were investigated in 1938 {{for violations of}} the Sherman Antitrust Act, but the charges were dropped after Borden signed <b>a</b> <b>consent</b> <b>decree</b> in 1940.|$|E
25|$|In 1935, James Rand Jr. {{was accused}} by the Securities and Exchange Commission of stock manipulation. Rand signed <b>a</b> <b>consent</b> <b>decree</b> in late May 1935 {{in which he}} did not admit guilt but did agree to stop stock {{purchases}} which would manipulate the share price of Remington Rand. In 1937, Rand founded the electric shaver division of Remington Rand.|$|E
25|$|The year 1999 was a {{milestone}} for Pittsfield, when negotiations between EPA, the state, General Electric and the City {{resulted in a}} settlement agreement – valued at over $250 million – to clean up Pittsfield and the Housatonic River. The settlement was memorialized in <b>a</b> <b>consent</b> <b>decree</b> that was entered in federal court the following year, making it a binding legal agreement.|$|E

25|$|Hiring {{issues have}} been {{contentious}} in recent decades, with the county coming under fire from African-Americans, Hispanics and other minorities claiming the hiring process discriminates against them. The U.S. Justice Department sued Suffolk for discriminating against women and minorities in police hiring in 1983. While denying any intentional discrimination, the county signed <b>a</b> <b>consent</b> <b>decree</b> three years later committing itself to increased minority hiring.|$|E
25|$|Reaction {{to police}} {{brutality}} {{resulted in the}} Watts riots of 1965 and again, after the Rodney King beating, in the Los Angeles riots of 1992. Charges of police brutality dogged the Department {{through the end of}} the 20th century. In the late 1990s, as a result of the Rampart scandal involving misconduct of 70 officers, the federal government was forced to intervene and assumed jurisdiction of the Department with <b>a</b> <b>consent</b> <b>decree.</b> Police reform has since been a major issue confronted by L.A.'s recent mayors.|$|E
25|$|Two years later, the FTC and Karnani {{settled the}} case with <b>a</b> <b>consent</b> <b>decree.</b> The {{defendants}} agreed to make the prohibitions of the 2009 order permanent. They were further barred from processing any transaction until the goods were ready to ship and not disputing any customer chargebacks made prior to {{a year before the}} decree. A $500,000 judgement against the defendants was entered, but suspended due to their inability to pay unless business records submitted in response to the FTC's requests were found to be falsified. Karnani and the other defendants admitted no wrongdoing.|$|E
25|$|On April 3, 2017, Sessions {{announced}} {{that he was going to}} review <b>consent</b> <b>decrees</b> in which local law enforcement agencies had agreed to Department oversight.

50|$|In 1989, New York State filed {{a lawsuit}} against Allied-Signal, Inc. for its part in {{contamination}} of Onondaga Lake.

25|$|Starting in the 1950s Cornell {{coordinated with}} other Ivy League schools {{to provide a}} {{consistent}} set of financial aid. However, in 1989, <b>a</b> <b>consent</b> <b>decree</b> to end a Justice Department antitrust investigation ended such coordination. Even after the decree, all Ivy League schools continue to award aid on financial need without offering any athletic scholarships. In December 2010, Cornell announced a policy of matching any grant component of financial aid offers from other Ivy League schools, MIT, Duke University or Stanford, if an accepted applicant is trying to decide between Cornell and those other schools.|$|E
25|$|Under its new {{permitting}} process Tent City 4 {{was limited}} by the City of Bellevue to 40 residents and 60 days duration. These limits were {{a result of the}} resources the Temple had available, and resulted in the Church and SHARE filing a lawsuit against the City of Bellevue to challenge the rules. The parties negotiated <b>a</b> <b>consent</b> <b>decree</b> where TC4 and its supporters acknowledged that Bellevue was within its rights to adopt these code changes in exchange for allowing TC4 to stay 90 days at the Temple and St Luke's sites in Bellevue and agreeing not to return to the city for one year.|$|E
25|$|In 2004, city {{authorities}} {{started an}} investigation against Agriprocessors due to complaints from local residents {{that the firm}} routinely deposited untreated effluent into local rivers in breach of regulations. On August 31, 2006, Agriprocessors signed <b>a</b> <b>consent</b> <b>decree</b> where they essentially admitted discharging untreated slaughtering wastewater into the Postville sewer system, in violation of Federal and Iowa State law and paid a $600,000 fine for violating waste-water regulations. Untreated wastewater from abattoirs is a heavy burden on wastewater treatment plants because of its high biochemical oxygen demand and high concentration of FOG (Fats, oils, and grease) which can form insoluble plaques in sewage pipes.|$|E

5000|$|The <b>consent</b> <b>decree,</b> entered on November 1, 1982, {{prevents}} the Republican Party [...] "from engaging {{in activities that}} suppress the vote, {{particularly when it comes}} to minority voters."

50|$|In 1996, {{under the}} {{direction}} of then-L.A. mayor Richard Riordan, the LACMTA signed <b>a</b> ten-year <b>consent</b> <b>decree</b> with the BRU to avoid litigation. Riordan would later state that the signing of this <b>consent</b> <b>decree</b> was <b>a</b> mistake. At the time, the LACMTA board was led to believe from information provided by MTA staff that load factors could be maintained with existing levels of bus service and without impacting the rail construction timetable; this proved false.|$|R
25|$|The United States Department of Labor (DOL) and United States Department of Justice (DOJ) had prosecuted the Laborers' Union in 1995 for racketeering, {{corruption}} and ties to organized crime. <b>A</b> <b>consent</b> <b>decree</b> permitted Coia (elected in 1992) to remain president {{so long as}} he made significant progress toward internal reforms. DOJ retained the authority to take over the union (appointing its own officers, setting its own budget, and making its own reforms) if Coia did not make what DOJ considered to be adequate progress toward reform. The agreement was modified and extended for one year in January 1998, and again in January 1999. By 1999, 226 individuals were expelled from the union, and 40 trusteeships of local unions established. A major reform was the first secret-ballot election for president and secretary-treasurer at the union's 1996 convention, which was also the first contested election for a LIUNA presidency.|$|E
25|$|In response, some Cabrini–Green tenant activists {{organized}} to prevent themselves from becoming homeless {{and to protect}} what they and their supporters see as a right to public housing for the city's poorest residents. The activists succeeded in obtaining <b>a</b> <b>consent</b> <b>decree</b> guaranteeing that some buildings will remain standing while the new structures are built, so that tenants can remain in their homes until new ones are available. The document also guarantees displaced Cabrini residents {{a home in the}} new neighborhood. In 2001, a tenants group sued the CHA over relocation plans for displaced residents of Cabrini–Green under the city's Plan for Transformation, a $1.4 billion blueprint for public housing renewal. Richard Wheelock, an attorney representing the tenants, said the authority's demolition program had outpaced its reconstruction program, thus leaving families with their own responsibilities to find options beyond equally dangerous and segregated areas elsewhere in the city, or simply becoming homeless.|$|E
25|$|On November 30, 1938, Siegel {{pitched the}} idea for the {{character}} of Superboy to Detective Comics (the corporate forerunner to DC Comics), but the company declined the offer. Siegel pitched the idea again in December 1940, but again the company declined to use the material. Siegel enlisted in the U.S. Army in July 1943. While he was stationed overseas, Detective Comics directed Joe Shuster to draw a Superboy comic strip for publication in More Fun Comics. No notice was given to Siegel, and no consent from him was granted. Siegel sued for copyright infringement, and won. A court-appointed special referee declared the character of Superboy unique, and not derivative from the character of Superman. But appeals by both Siegel and National Comics Publication (the new name of Detective Comics) led to <b>a</b> <b>consent</b> <b>decree</b> in which the parties agreed that Superboy was the sole property of National Comics.|$|E
50|$|The factory at Fells Point {{operated}} until 1985, when it {{was closed}} down. The company had contaminated the 20 acre site with hazardous waste, and Honeywell, the successor to Allied Chemical, was ordered by the Environmental Protection Agency to perform a cleanup in the 1986. The order was confirmed by <b>a</b> judicial <b>consent</b> <b>decree</b> in 1989. Honeywell completed the remediation in 1999.|$|R
50|$|On May 17, the American Civil Liberties Union filed {{a request}} with U.S. District Judge Gary A.

If the judge finds the LAPD {{in violation of the}} decree, federal oversight of the LAPD could be extended beyond the current deadline of 2009.|$|R
25|$|Jefferson County Environmental Services {{serves the}} Birmingham metro area with {{sanitary}} sewer service. Sewer rates {{have increased in}} recent years after citizens concerned with pollution in area waterways filed a lawsuit that resulted in <b>a</b> federal <b>consent</b> <b>decree</b> to repair <b>an</b> aging sewer system. Because the estimated cost of the <b>consent</b> <b>decree</b> was approximately three {{times more than the}} original estimate, many blame the increased rates on corruption of several Jefferson County officials. The sewer construction and bond-swap agreements continue to be a controversial topic in the area.|$|R
500|$|In July 1956, Julian and {{executives}} {{of two other}} American companies trying to enter the Mexican steroid intermediates market appeared before a U.S. Senate subcommittee. [...] They testified that Syntex was using undue influence to monopolize access to the Mexican yam. The hearings resulted in Syntex signing <b>a</b> <b>consent</b> <b>decree</b> with the U.S. Justice Department. While it did not admit to restraining trade, it promised {{not to do so}} in the future. Within five years, large American multinational pharmaceutical companies had acquired all six producers of steroid intermediates in Mexico, four of which had been Mexican-owned.|$|E
500|$|In 2012, Cleveland's {{crime rate}} were 84 murders, 3,252 robberies, and 9,740 burglaries. In 2014, the United States Department of Justice (DOJ) {{published}} {{a report that}} investigated {{the use of force}} by the Cleveland Police Department from 2010–2013. [...] The Justice Department found a pattern of excessive force including the use of firearms, tasers, fists, and chemical spray that unnecessarily escalated nonviolent situations, including against the mentally ill and people who were already restrained. [...] As a result of the Justice Department report, the city of Cleveland has agreed to <b>a</b> <b>consent</b> <b>decree</b> to revise its policies and implement new independent oversight over the police force.|$|E
500|$|The Kennecott South Zone/Bingham site {{contains}} contamination from Kennecott Copper Mine's {{operation in}} Copperton, {{at the base}} of the Oquirrh Mountains to Bingham Creek and Butterfield Creek. [...] A [...] plume of lead, arsenic and sulfates (covering 9 percent of the watershed) currently contaminates the ground water from the mine site all the way to the Jordan River. The largest inland reverse osmosis plant in the country was built in 2006 to clean up the ground water and a second plant has been scheduled for construction; completion of the ground water cleanup, however, is not projected until 2040. In 1998, the site was removed from the Superfund list due to Kennecott's progress in the cleanup and <b>a</b> <b>consent</b> <b>decree</b> legally obligating Kennecott to continue the rest of the cleanup.|$|E
