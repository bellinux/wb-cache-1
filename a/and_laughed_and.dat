500|$|I enjoyed {{working with}} her very much. Mariah and I got along very great. We had never talked and never sang {{together}} before. We just had a chance for camaraderie, singer-to-singer, artist-to-artist, that kind of thing. We just laughed and talked <b>and</b> <b>laughed</b> <b>and</b> talked and sang in between that ... It's {{good to know that}} two ladies of soul can still be friends. We talked about doing other things together, enterprise-wise, which is cool, because she's got a good, vivid mind, that girl. She's a smart lady. I really like Mariah.|$|E

2500|$|In mid-1957, Garcia began smoking {{cigarettes}} and {{was introduced to}} marijuana. Garcia would later reminisce about {{the first time he}} smoked marijuana: [...] "Me and a friend of mine went up into the hills with two joints, the San Francisco foothills, and smoked these joints and just got so high <b>and</b> <b>laughed</b> <b>and</b> roared and went skipping down the streets doing funny things and just having a helluva time". During this time, Garcia also studied at what is now the San Francisco Art Institute. The teacher there was Wally Hedrick, an artist who came to prominence during the 1960s. During the classes, he often encouraged Garcia in his drawing and painting skills. Hedrick also introduced Garcia to the fiction of Jack Kerouac, whom Garcia later cited as a major influence.|$|E
2500|$|On 19 November, Dyer {{was called}} {{to appear before the}} Commission. Although his {{military}} superiors had suggested he be represented by legal counsel at the inquiry, Dyer refused this suggestion and appeared alone. Initially questioned by Lord Hunter, Dyer stated he had come to know about the meeting at the Jallianwala Bagh at 12:40 hours that day but did not attempt to prevent it. He stated that he had gone to the Bagh with the deliberate intention of opening fire if he found a crowd assembled there. Patterson says Dyer explained his sense of honour to the Hunter Commission by saying, [...] "I think it quite possible that I could have dispersed the crowd without firing but they would have come back again <b>and</b> <b>laughed,</b> <b>and</b> I would have made, what I consider, a fool of myself." [...] Dyer further reiterated his belief that the crowd in the Bagh was one of [...] "rebels who were trying to isolate my forces and cut me off from other supplies. Therefore, I considered it my duty to fire on them and to fire well".|$|E

2500|$|Soon {{after his}} return to England, Dickens began work {{on the first of}} his Christmas stories, A Christmas Carol, written in 1843, which was {{followed}} by The Chimes in 1844 and The Cricket on the Hearth in 1845. Of these, A Christmas Carol was most popular and, tapping into an old tradition, did much to promote a renewed enthusiasm for the joys of Christmas in Britain and America. The seeds for the story became planted in Dickens's mind during a trip to Manchester to witness the conditions of the manufacturing workers there. This, along with scenes he had recently witnessed at the Field Lane Ragged School, caused Dickens to resolve to [...] "strike a sledge hammer blow" [...] for the poor. As the idea for the story took shape and the writing began in earnest, Dickens became engrossed in the book. He later wrote that as the tale unfolded he [...] "wept <b>and</b> <b>laughed,</b> <b>and</b> wept again" [...] as he [...] "walked about the black streets of London fifteen or twenty miles many a night when all sober folks had gone to bed." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1971, Cameron took a {{leave of}} absence from UNB and moved to D'Escousse, a village on Isle Madame, a small island off the southeastern coast of Cape Breton. He wanted to write, he missed the sea and his first {{marriage}} had ended. He arrived in Cape Breton, a divorced father of three sons and a daughter. As he told a journalist 20 years later, [...] "Dr. Donald Cameron left his university office, drove to the village of D'Escousse, stepped into a phone booth and emerged as the award-winning author and playwright Silver Donald Cameron." [...] (He added the name [...] "Silver" [...] to set himself apart from the multitudes of other Camerons. Folk-singer Tom Gallant suggested the name because Cameron's head of prematurely grey hair was his most striking feature.) Cameron settled in D'Escousse after buying a house he describes as [...] "composed of two tiny ancient buildings pushed together to make one comfortable home." [...] He adds that the house was [...] "spang on the roadside, the floor plan was awkward, and it was half-renovated in a style not much to my taste. But it felt right: a serene and happy little house where generations had loved <b>and</b> <b>laughed</b> <b>and</b> wept and died." ...|$|E
