5|$|In 1839, Melbourne {{resigned}} after Radicals and Tories (both of whom Victoria detested) {{voted against}} {{a bill to}} suspend the constitution of Jamaica. The bill removed political power from plantation owners who were resisting measures associated with the abolition of slavery. The Queen commissioned a Tory, Sir Robert Peel, {{to form a new}} ministry. At the time, it was customary for the prime minister to appoint members of the Royal Household, who were usually his political allies <b>and</b> <b>their</b> <b>spouses.</b> Many of the Queen's ladies of the bedchamber were wives of Whigs, and Peel expected to replace them with wives of Tories. In {{what became known as the}} bedchamber crisis, Victoria, advised by Melbourne, objected to their removal. Peel refused to govern under the restrictions imposed by the Queen, and consequently resigned his commission, allowing Melbourne to return to office.|$|E

40|$|Objectives: To improve {{understanding}} about the barriers and facilitators to physical activity for people with Alzheimer's disease <b>and</b> <b>their</b> <b>spouse</b> carers, <b>and</b> to consider the development of activity interventions that would be acceptable, sustainable and feasible for both groups. Design: A qualitative approach, using semi-structured interviews, facilitated exploration of physical activity in {{a small group of}} people with Alzheimer's disease <b>and</b> <b>their</b> <b>spouse</b> carers. Setting: Participants were recruited from one memory clinic in South West England. Participants: Potential participants were identified by clinical psychologists at the memory clinic and were given information about participating in the research. Five people with Alzheimer's disease <b>and</b> <b>their</b> <b>spouse</b> carers were subsequently recruited for semi-structured interviews, which took place at the memory clinic. Interviews were audio-recorded and transcribed verbatim. Main outcome measures: Qualitative data were analysed using thematic analysis. Three major themes have been presented. Results: The findings illustrate the complex interplay between the overarching themes 'self', 'others' and 'couple' that affect physical activity for both people with Alzheimer's disease <b>and</b> <b>their</b> <b>spouse</b> carers, <b>and</b> which are linked to the progression of dementia. Conclusions: An individually tailored approach for couples, which values the role of the carer and accounts for the progressive and changing nature of dementia, should be a guiding principle for intervention design...|$|R
