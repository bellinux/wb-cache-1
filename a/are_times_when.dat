5|$|Most {{pituitary}} hormones can {{be replaced}} indirectly by administering {{the products of the}} effector glands: hydrocortisone (cortisol) for adrenal insufficiency, levothyroxine for hypothyroidism, testosterone for male hypogonadism, and estradiol for female hypogonadism (usually with a progestogen to inhibit unwanted effects on the uterus). Growth hormone is available in synthetic form, but needs to be administered parenterally (by injection). Antidiuretic hormone {{can be replaced}} by desmopressin (DDAVP) tablets or nose spray. Generally, the lowest dose of the replacement medication is used to restore wellbeing and correct the deranged results, as excessive doses would cause side-effects or complications. Those requiring hydrocortisone are usually instructed to increase their dose in physically stressful events such as injury, hospitalization and dental work as these <b>are</b> <b>times</b> <b>when</b> the normal supplementary dose may be inadequate, putting the patient at risk of adrenal crisis.|$|E

25|$|There <b>are</b> <b>times</b> <b>when</b> an uninitiated dog {{owner or}} a new enthusiast {{mistakes}} the Koolie as a shy, reserved or even a timid animal. The Koolie's temperament needs to be understood in proper context when one seeks an optimal match of skills and demeanour. Koolies are intelligent animals, and the most experienced handlers know well that they need guidance in training. A steady and supportive approach will be productive, proving the Koolie's adaptability in diverse situations when given time.|$|E

Undergraduate students mostly interact with the collection through their classes; aside from that most of their experiences with this collection come from the public sculptures around campus.|$|E
25|$|Vector {{graphics}} formats are complementary to raster graphics. Raster graphics is {{the representation}} of images as an array of pixels and is typically used for {{the representation of}} photographic images. Vector graphics consists in encoding information about shapes and colors that comprise the image, which can allow for more flexibility in rendering. There are instances when working with vector tools and formats is best practice, and instances when working with raster tools and formats is best practice. There <b>are</b> <b>times</b> <b>when</b> both formats come together. An understanding of the advantages and limitations of each technology {{and the relationship between}} them is most likely to result in efficient and effective use of tools.|$|E

Depending on which CO is chosen by the player to advise, there <b>are</b> <b>times</b> <b>when</b> a mission is split into a choice of two or three, where the maps and dialog could be different. After completing that mission, the story paths could split up, depending on which CO was chosen in that previous mission, with the story differing from the other path, eventually leading back to the main path.|$|E
25|$|Unger has {{presented}} {{a number of}} general institutional proposals that aim to restructure the world trade regime and introduce new alternatives in the market economy. For international and global trade, Unger calls for the need to experiment with different property rights regimes, where multiple forms will coexist in the same market system and not be tied to individual property rights and contractual labor. Generally, rather than maximizing the free trade as the goal, Unger sees the need to build and open the world economy in way that reconciles global openness with national and regional diversification, deviation, heresy, and experiment, where {{the idea is to}} support alternatives by making the world safer for them. For national economies, he rejects the need to require the free flow of capital, for there <b>are</b> <b>times</b> <b>when</b> {{it may be necessary to}} restrict capital flows. Rather, he puts the emphasis on the free flow of people. Labor should be allowed to move freely throughout the world.|$|E
25|$|If all looting is wrong, as {{in theory}} it is, {{then they have}} been to blame: but there <b>are</b> <b>times</b> <b>when</b> {{the laws of nature}} assert {{themselves}} over the laws of civilization, and this was a case in point. You must remember that these men had just endured a long siege, that they had been bereft of everything they possessed and that they had hundreds of men, similarly destitute, who were dependent upon them. What was their position? Had they come to me and said, 'Give us money and food,' I could only have replied in the negative, or, at all events, to the effect that I could not feed their converts, and so they took the law into their own hands. It has been a case of poetical or primitive justice. But, granted that this sort of justice was admissible, I do not admit that the missionaries abused it. I have not heard of a single instance of a missionary looting for any purpose other than that of feeding themselves and their converts who were dependent on them.|$|E

In the following decades there <b>were</b> <b>times</b> <b>when</b> the Ottomans succeeded to storm Tabriz, and there <b>were</b> <b>times</b> <b>when</b> the Persians successfully captured Baghdad.

25|$|Understanding and {{accepting}} the psychological state {{an individual is}} in is paramount. There are many mis-conceptions {{of what it means}} for a traumatized individual to be in crisis or 'psychosis'. These <b>are</b> <b>times</b> <b>when</b> an individual is in inordinate amounts of pain and cannot comfort themselves, if treated humanely and respectfully they will not get to a state in which they are a danger. In these situations it is best to provide a supportive, caring environment and communicate to the individual that no matter the circumstance they will be taken seriously and not just as a sick, delusional individual. It is vital for the assessor to understand that {{what is going on in}} the traumatized persons head is valid and real. If deemed appropriate, the assessing clinician may proceed by inquiring about both the traumatic event and the outcomes experienced (e.g., posttraumatic symptoms, dissociation, substance abuse, somatic symptoms, psychotic reactions). Such inquiry occurs within the context of established rapport and is completed in an empathic, sensitive, and supportive manner. The clinician may also inquire about possible relational disturbance, such as alertness to interpersonal danger, abandonment issues, and the need for self-protection via interpersonal control. Through discussion of interpersonal relationships, the clinician is better able to assess the individual's ability to enter and sustain a clinical relationship.|$|E

He became anxious on stage and had difficulty establishing eye contact with the audience. He once said in an interview about performing on stage, [...] "I dig singing the songs but there <b>are</b> <b>times</b> <b>when</b> it's pretty agonising for me to be out there." [...] After a brief break from music, he started appearing in clubs, regaining his ability to perform live, albeit with smaller audiences.|$|E

He lives in the underwater city of Bikini Bottom in a moai situated between SpongeBob SquarePants' pineapple house and Patrick Star's rock.

Albini later observed the use of studio banter on Surfer Rosa: [...] "It's on their record forever so I think now they are obliged to say that they're ok with it, but I honestly don't know that that idea would've ever come up if I hadn't done it.

[...] At certain points, crowd scenes spread across {{the pages of the}} book, filled with [...] "Lat's broadly humorous and humane" [...] characters. [...] Comics journalist Tom Spurgeon said after readings such scenes: [...] "There <b>are</b> <b>times</b> <b>when</b> reading Town Boy feels like watching through a street fair after it rains, everyday existence altered by an event just enough to make everything stand out.

[...] Dufek added: [...] "Hockey is a more relaxed thing. [...] It's a smaller atmosphere and {{you have to deal with}} only one or two coaches. [...] You can be more individual and flashy. [...] Football has certain assignments and you can't really express yourself." [...] In the end, however, Dufek chose the NFL over the NHL.
