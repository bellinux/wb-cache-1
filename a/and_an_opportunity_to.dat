Organizers intended to denounce the federal government for its failure to safeguard the civil rights and physical safety of civil rights workers and blacks. However, the group acquiesced to presidential pressure and influence, and the event ultimately took on a far less strident tone.|$|E

5|$|The IIF {{was able}} to invest in {{development}} projects due to Disston's purchase, <b>and</b> <b>an</b> <b>opportunity</b> <b>to</b> improve transportation arose when oil tycoon Henry Flagler began purchasing land and building rail lines along {{the east coast of}} Florida, as far south as Palm Beach in 1893. Along the way he built resort hotels, transforming territorial outposts into tourist destinations. The land bordering the rail lines was developed as citrus farms. By 1896 the rail line had been extended to Biscayne Bay. Three months after the first train had arrived, the residents of Miami voted to incorporate the town. Miami became a prime destination for extremely wealthy people after the Royal Palm Hotel was opened.|$|E

5|$|The New York Giants are a National Football League (NFL) {{franchise}} {{founded in}} the 1925 season, the NFL's sixth. Eleven years later, the league introduced the NFL draft after team owners voted on it in 1935. The intention of the draft {{was to make the}} NFL more competitive, as a few stronger teams, including the Giants, had an advantage in signing young players because they were able to offer higher salaries <b>and</b> <b>an</b> <b>opportunity</b> <b>to</b> compete for championships. Since that first draft, the Giants have selected 74 players in the first round. The team's first-round pick in the inaugural NFL draft was Art Lewis, a tackle from Ohio University; he was the 9th overall selection. In the most recent draft, held in 2017, the Giants chose Mississippi tight end Evan Engram.|$|E
5|$|Anspach's {{backing of}} Suys' {{proposal}} was a calculated decision, {{as he had}} radical plans to transform the city. Anspach saw the proposal as an unexpected boon, as it allowed him to accomplish several of his goals at once. It had long been his ambition to transform the impoverished lower city into a centre of business and commerce, suitable for a modern capital (Belgium had declared its independence in 1830, with Brussels its capital). He wanted to attract the middle class, most of whom had left the dingy downtown for the cleaner suburbs, including the Leopold Quarter (now often called the European quarter) and Avenue Louise, causing a large loss in tax revenue for the city. The elimination of the numerous alleys and dead-ends in the lower town in favour of a large, straight, wide, open-air boulevard, linking the two rapidly growing train stations, seemed both a necessity <b>and</b> <b>an</b> <b>opportunity</b> <b>to</b> beautify the city and improve both traffic circulation and hygiene.|$|E

25|$|As hurling {{entered the}} new millennium, it has {{remained}} Ireland's second most popular sport.

25|$|Patrick Henry {{was sworn}} into a sleepy {{session of the}} {{legislature}} on May 20; many of the members had left town. On about May 28, a ship arrived with an urgent letter from Montague: the Stamp Act had passed. On May 29, Henry introduced the Virginia Stamp Act Resolves. The first two resolutions affirmed that the colonists had the same rights and privileges as Britons; the next two stated that taxation should be exacted only by one's representatives. The fifth was the most provocative, as it named the Virginia legislature, the General Assembly, as the representatives of Virginia empowered to tax. Two other resolutions were offered, though their authorship is uncertain. Edmund and Helen Morgan, in their account of the Stamp Act crisis, suggested that Henry acted as he saw the Stamp Act as both a threat to Virginians' rights, <b>and</b> <b>an</b> <b>opportunity</b> <b>to</b> advance himself politically.|$|E

Worldwide in 1979 there were 129 officially recognized Bahá'í socio–economic development projects. By 1987, the number of officially recognized development projects had increased to 1482.

25|$|Taken from New York Times Sunday Book Review, January 2, 2015, Richard Dunn's 'A Tale of Two Plantations' a {{comparison}} and contrasting of Mesopotamia Plantation on Jamaica and Mount Airy Plantation in Virginia: In Virginia, John Tayloe III, master of Mount Airy from 1792 to 1828, bred horses and slaves. The horses he raced, earning him the reputation “as the leading Virginia turfman of his generation.” The slaves he worked and sold. “There were,” Author Richard Dunn counts, “252 recorded slave births and 142 slave deaths at Mount Airy between 1809 and 1828, providing John III with 110 extra slaves.” These slaves treatment Dunn notes, comparatively to Mas Tayloe, a fourth-generation enslaver, moved {{some of these}} surplus people around his other Virginia holdings and transferred others to his sons. The rest he sold, providing Tayloe with both needed capital <b>and</b> <b>an</b> <b>opportunity</b> <b>to</b> cull unproductive workers, keeping his labor force fit and young.|$|E
25|$|Gonzales helped {{draft the}} January, 2002 Presidential Order which {{authorized}} {{the use of}} military tribunals to try terrorist suspects. The order arrogated to the President the power to hold any non-citizen who he deemed a terrorist, or accessory to a terrorist, in military detention and subject to trial before a military commission. Subsequently the United States Department of Defense (DOD) organized military tribunals to judge charges against enemy combatant detainees being held at Guantanamo Bay detention camp. In the early years, the camp authorities did not allow foreign detainees access to attorneys, or materials supporting their charges, and the executive branch declared them outside the reach of due process under habeas corpus. In Rasul v. Bush (2004), the US Supreme Court ruled that they did have rights to habeas corpus and had to be provided access to legal counsel <b>and</b> <b>an</b> <b>opportunity</b> <b>to</b> challenge their detention before an impartial tribunal. Further, in 2006, the Supreme Court ruled in Hamdan v. Rumsfeld that trying Guantanamo Bay detainees under the existing Guantanamo military commission (known also as Military Tribunal) was illegal under US law, including the Geneva Conventions.|$|E
25|$|Britain's Got Talent (often {{shortened}} to BGT) is a British television {{talent show}} competition, and {{is part of}} the Got Talent franchise. Produced by both Thames (formerly Talkback Thames) and Syco Entertainment production, and distributed by FremantleMedia, it has been broadcast on ITV since June 2007, and is hosted by Ant & Dec, with each series accompanied by a sister show on ITV2 entitled Britain's Got More Talent presented by Stephen Mulhern. Contestants of any age, who possess some sort of talent, can audition for the show, with their performance judged by a panel of judges; the current lineup consists of the show's creator Simon Cowell, Amanda Holden, Alesha Dixon, and David Walliams. Those that make it through the auditions, compete against other acts in a series of live semi-finals, with the winning two acts of each semi-final proceeding into the show's live final.
