5|$|Like much of {{the rest}} of French West Africa, {{authorities}} enforced explicit rules in an attempt to end slavery in the region. In 1903, the government instructed French <b>administrators</b> <b>to</b> not use slave as an administrative category anymore. This was followed in 1905 by a formal French decree that ended slavery throughout French West Africa.|$|E

5|$|Askin then named Morton as the Minister for Local Government and Minister for Highways, being {{sworn in}} by the Governor of New South Wales, Sir Eric Woodward at Government House, Sydney on 13 May 1965. As Minister, Morton was {{involved}} in the first dismissal of Warringah Shire Council in April 1967 which was triggered by the gaoling of two councillors for bribery. The Councillors involved, Dennis Thomas and George Knight, were prosecuted under the Secret Commissions Prohibition Act 1919 (NSW) for receiving bribes from a development company to influence planning and development decisions, and both received gaol sentences. From 1967 to 1968 he appointed several public servants as <b>Administrators</b> <b>to</b> serve until a new council could be elected.|$|E
5|$|Booth {{was less}} {{successful}} in his penultimate season in 196768, with only 426 runs at 23.66, including two half-centuries, both against Victoria. A decision by <b>administrators</b> <b>to</b> introduce Sunday {{play into the}} Sheffield Shield ended his career, as he refused to make himself available for games that involved Sunday play. He played in only one match in his final season in 196869, scoring a duck and 15 as New South Wales lost to South Australia by three wickets. Booth continued to play grade cricket for the St. George club until 197677, leading the batting averages and aggregates in 197475. With 10,674 runs at 45.42, he was fifth on the all-time run-scoring aggregates in Sydney grade competition {{at the time of}} his retirement, but has now dropped to ninth.|$|E

5|$|Johnson's team {{arrived in}} Australia {{towards the end}} of 1945, but the armed {{services}} and Australian Board of Control ordered them to play another series against the various Australian states. Johnson had sought fixtures for his team in Australia, but this was before the Evatt had added the matches in the subcontinent. He implored the <b>administrators</b> <b>to</b> recognise that the players were already overworked, but was ignored. The Services performed poorly; after playing out consecutive draws against Western Australia and South Australia, they were crushed by an innings by both Victoria and New South Wales, before drawing against Queensland and Tasmania, the smallest state in the country.|$|E
5|$|Madgwick officially {{took office}} on 1 July 1967. As chairman, Madgwick took a {{somewhat}} hands-off approach to directing the organisation, preferring to provide his opinion {{as to how}} things should operate, then deferring to his <b>administrators</b> <b>to</b> decide what to do. Madgwick considered his position as similar to a university president, with managers and producers equivalent to professors and researchers. He bought a home in Mosman {{to be closer to}} the ABC's main Broadcast House in Sydney. Madgwick tried to make himself available by walking around the offices and facilities and amiably conversing with all ABC employees. He was subsequently described as the most popular chairman {{in the history of the}} organisation. Madgwick was given a second term as chairman in 1970.|$|E
5|$|Although Woodfull was {{a devout}} Methodist, {{he would show}} a deep concern in the {{personal}} welfare of all players, which extended to finding {{the location of the}} nearest Catholic Church for those teammates who followed the religion. At the time, Australian society at large was divided along Catholic-Protestant lines, and while O'Reilly and McCabe were full of praise for Woodfull, they were later accused of leading a Catholic revolt against the leadership of the Protestant Bradman during a divisive period in the late-1930s. While Woodfull himself never touched alcohol due to his strict adherence to his religious principles, he did not impose his beliefs on his team. He would buy drinks for his players, and ask <b>administrators</b> <b>to</b> provide more alcohol for his teammates when they were exhausted. At the time, cricketers widely regarded beer as a highly effective means of rehydration, and on one occasion Woodfull threatened to halt play when administrators refused his players more ale {{on the grounds that they}} had already consumed their quota.|$|E

5|$|Early historians, {{including}} the 6th century cleric Gildas, have noted 383 {{as a significant}} point in Welsh history, as it is stated in literature as the foundation point of several medieval royal dynasties. In that year the Roman general Magnus Maximus, or Macsen Wledig, stripped all of western and northern Britain of troops and senior <b>administrators,</b> <b>to</b> launch a successful bid for imperial power; continuing to rule Britain from Gaul as emperor. Gildas, writing in about 540, says that Maximus departed Britain, taking with him all of its Roman troops, armed bands, governors and the flower of its youth, never to return. Having left with the troops and Roman administrators, and planning to continue as the ruler of Britain in the future, his practical course was to transfer local authority to local rulers. The earliest Welsh genealogies give Maximus the role of founding father for several royal dynasties, including those of Powys and Gwent. It was this transfer of power that {{has given rise to}} the belief that he was the father of the Welsh Nation. He is given as the ancestor of a Welsh king on the Pillar of Eliseg, erected nearly 500 years after he left Britain, and he figures in lists of the Fifteen Tribes of Wales.|$|E
5|$|Henry's reign saw {{significant}} legal changes, {{particularly in}} England and Normandy. By {{the middle of}} the 12th century, England had many different ecclesiastical and civil law courts, with overlapping jurisdictions resulting from the interaction of diverse legal traditions. Henry greatly expanded the role of royal justice in England, producing a more coherent legal system, summarised {{at the end of his}} reign in the treatise of Glanvill, an early legal handbook. Despite these reforms it is uncertain if Henry had a grand vision for his new legal system and the reforms seem to have proceeded in a steady, pragmatic fashion. Indeed, in most cases he was probably not personally responsible for creating the new processes, but he was greatly interested in the law, seeing the delivery of justice as one of the key tasks for a king and carefully appointing good <b>administrators</b> <b>to</b> conduct the reforms.|$|E
5|$|Rainfall {{and storm}} surge flooded 20 homes in Terrebonne Parish. In addition, several homes in Lafouche Parish {{experienced}} flooding, including two with over {{two feet of}} water. Numerous homes in Golden Meadow experienced flooding, as well. The flooding also forced the temporary closing of numerous roads across the state, including portions of U.S. Route 11 and Interstate 10. Flood waters from the storm cracked a water line in LaPlace, leaving nearly 30,000 residents and many businesses without tap water. The problem was expected to take little time to fix, though residents were advised to boil the water before drinking it. Matthew also left 2,500people without power {{for a short period}} of time. The storm's impact also closed several schools, forcing school <b>administrators</b> <b>to</b> reschedule plans for making up school closings caused by Hurricane Ivan one month earlier. In all, Matthew caused no deaths and $255,000 in damage (2004USD).|$|E

5|$|The {{government}} began purchasing church run boarding {{schools in the}} 1920s. During this period capital {{costs associated with the}} schools were assumed by the government, leaving administrative and instructional duties to church officials. The hope was that minimizing facility expenditures would allow church <b>administrators</b> <b>to</b> provide higher quality instruction and support to the students in their care. Although the government was willing to, and did, purchase schools from the churches, many were acquired for free given that the rampant disrepair present in the buildings resulted in their having no economic value. Schools continued to be maintained by churches in instances where they failed to reach an agreement with government officials with the understanding that the government would provide support for capital costs. The understanding ultimately proved complicated {{due to the lack of}} written agreements outlining the extent and nature of that support or the approvals required to undertake expensive renovations and repairs.|$|E
5|$|From its founding, the Antankarana Kingdom {{was ruled}} by an {{unbroken}} series of nobles of Andriantsirotso's line. He was succeeded by Lamboeny (1710–1790), then Tehimbola (1790–1802), Boanahajy (1802–1809) and Tsialana I (1809–1822). The Kingdom of Imerina rapidly expanded {{over the first}} several decades of the 19th century, launching regular military campaigns to bring coastal communities under Merina control. As the Merina neared the Antankarana homeland they established posts along major trade routes where taxes were charged to Antankarana and other merchants, establishing economic control over the territory; this was soon followed by the installation of Merina <b>administrators</b> <b>to</b> govern the territory. Tsialana I was forced to become a vassal of the Merina sovereign. From 1835 to 1837, his son and successor, King Tsimiaro I (1822–1882), made repeated attempts to expel the Merina from his territory, but was unsuccessful. The Merina backlash forced Tsimiaro to lead his people to refuge among the rocks of Ankarana in 1838 or 1837, where they lived for over a year. During this time the king was betrayed {{by one of his}} own people and the group was surrounded by Merina soldiers. According to oral history, the king prayed for God's help and swore that if they survived, the Antankarana would convert to Islam. Although many of his party were gunned down, the king and most of his subjects escaped to the island of Nosy Mitsio, where they converted; many others were drowned in the attempt to cross. The site of the crossing is most commonly believed to be the village of Ambavan'ankarana, which retains a sacred character and has become a site of pilgrimage and ritual commemoration of the exodus.|$|E
