40|$|This study {{examines}} recent regulatory and practitioner concerns that managers provide more (less) information to <b>analysts</b> <b>with</b> more (less) favorable stock recommendations. We examine the relative forecast accuracy of analysts {{before and after}} a recommendation issuance {{under the assumption that}} increases (decreases) in management-provided information will increase (decrease) analysts' relative forecast accuracy. We find that analysts issuing more favorable recommendations experience a greater increase in their relative forecast accuracy compared <b>with</b> <b>analysts</b> <b>with</b> less favorable recommendations. Additional tests on the change in frequency <b>with</b> which <b>analysts</b> issue forecasts independent of or in conjunction <b>with</b> other <b>analysts</b> after their recommendation change yield corroborating results. In addition, we find that the greater increase in relative accuracy for <b>analysts</b> <b>with</b> more favorable recommendations exists prior to the passage of Regulation FD but not after. The combined results are consistent <b>with</b> <b>analysts</b> receiving relatively more management-provided information following the issuance of more favorable recommendations.

40|$|We first {{examine whether}} <b>analysts</b> <b>with</b> certain {{characteristics}} that prior research has identified {{are related to}} superior forecasting ability systematically time their forecast revisions later in the fiscal quarter. We then examine whether this superior ability persists after controlling for the timing advantage by using relative forecast error, a measure that largely eliminates the timing advantage of recent forecasts. Using a sample of quarterly earnings forecast revisions over the 20 -year period from 1990 to 2009, we find that <b>analysts</b> <b>with</b> more firm-specific and general experience and more accurate prior-period forecasts, analysts employed by larger brokerage firms, and analysts who follow fewer industries and companies tend to revise forecasts later in the quarter. We also find that analyst characteristics that are positively correlated with revision timing are negatively related to relative forecast errors. These results are consistent <b>with</b> <b>analyst</b> characteristics being useful proxies for analyst forecasting ability and <b>analysts</b> <b>with</b> greater ability revising forecasts later in the quarter.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{studies the}} effects of compensation incentives on individual behavior. Specifically, I look at changes in effort and risk-taking behavior among financial analysts, investment managers, and teenagers. The main chapter focuses on sell-side analysts. Evidence shows that investors heed to the predictions of sell-side analysts, who influence stock market prices. The informational content of their predictions depends on their incentives to reveal unbiased information. I hypothesize that relative performance evaluations provide <b>analysts</b> <b>with</b> incentives to distort their private information. The incentive cycle of analysts starts and ends mid-year, while their predictions are validated {{in the middle of}} this cycle. Hence, <b>analysts</b> <b>with</b> good early performance benefit later from sticking to the consensus (herding), while <b>analysts</b> <b>with</b> poor early performance can only escape their low standing by taking risk and deviating from the consensus (anti-herding). I confirm the hypotheses using data from 1990 through 2010 that include analyst recommendations and stock performance. The results suggest that asset price variation that is not due to fundamental are better understood in the context of the incentives that drive analyst behavior...|$|R

Sam Adams, a junior CIA <b>analyst</b> <b>with</b> responsibilities for estimating the actual damage to the enemy, eventually resigned from the CIA, after expressing concern to Director of Central Intelligence Richard Helms with estimates that were changed for inter-agency and White House political reasons.

After Russia recognised Abkhazia and South Ossetia on 26 August 2008, Stephen Smith summoned the Russian ambassador, Alexander Blokhin, to inform him that Russia's recognition was not helpful for the situation in the region, while Blokhin informed the Australian Foreign Minister that Russia was left with no choice but to recognise the independence of the two regions. Blaming Georgian President Mikheil Saakashvili for the conflict, Blokhin told The Age that the Russians were not the aggressors, but rather the peacekeepers. Rory Medcalf, a strategic <b>analyst</b> <b>with</b> the Lowy Institute, stated that Australia could use the uranium deal to apply pressure on Moscow, but in doing so it risked sending messages to countries such as China that it is an unreliable supplier, which would in turn hurt Australian interests.|$|E

40|$|We {{hypothesize that}} <b>analysts</b> <b>with</b> a bullish stock {{recommendation}} {{have an interest}} in not being subsequently contradicted by negative firm-specific news.

Consistent with this notion, we find that stock recommendations significantly and positively predict subsequent earnings surprises, as well as narrow beats versus narrow misses. This predictability is concentrated in situations where the motivation for such behavior is particularly strong. Stock recommendations also predict earnings-announcement-day returns.
