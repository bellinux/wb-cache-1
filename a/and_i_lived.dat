500|$|Rado and Ragni {{brought their}} drafts {{of the show}} to {{producer}} Eric Blau who, through common friend Nat Shapiro, connected the two with Canadian composer Galt MacDermot. MacDermot had won a Grammy Award in 1961 for his composition [...] "African Waltz" [...] (recorded by Cannonball Adderley). [...] The composer's lifestyle was {{in marked contrast to}} his co-creators: [...] "I had short hair, a wife, and, at that point, four children, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>lived</b> on Staten Island." [...] "I never even heard of a hippie when I met Rado and Ragni." [...] But he shared their enthusiasm to do a rock and roll show. [...] "We work independently," [...] explained MacDermot in May 1968. [...] "I prefer it that way. [...] They hand me the material. [...] I set it to music." [...] MacDermot wrote the first score in three weeks, starting with the songs [...] "I Got Life", [...] "Ain't Got No", [...] "Where Do I Go" [...] and the title song. [...] He first wrote [...] "Aquarius" [...] as an unconventional art piece, but later rewrote it into an uplifting anthem.|$|E
2500|$|That Mitchell and Webb Look took a jab at Leatherhead {{in series}} two, episode four. In it, a {{librarian}} comments {{to a customer}} that she is [...] "possibly one of the stupidest people I've ever met. <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>lived</b> in Leatherhead for six miserable years." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1985 James Baldwin {{described}} {{the impact of}} Delaney on his life, saying he was [...] "the first living proof, for me, that a black man could be an artist. In a warmer time, a less blasphemous place, {{he would have been}} recognised as my Master and I as his Pupil. He became, for me, an example of courage and integrity, humility and passion. An absolute integrity: I saw him shaken many times <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>lived</b> to see him broken but I never saw him bow." [...] He further wrote, [...] "Perhaps I should not say, flatly, what I believe – that he is a great painter – among the very greatest; but I do know that great art can only be created out of love, and that no greater lover has ever held a brush." ...|$|E

60|$|I MIGHT as well {{give some}} idea of the place in which the doctor <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>lived</b> {{together}} so sociably.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes. Out in Wisconsin. My {{people were}} emigrants, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>lived</b> in the woods, there, till I began to paint my way out. I began pretty early, but I {{was in the}} woods till I was sixteen." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I'm an old woman, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>lived</b> with my son, but {{my son has}} quit me to starve, for all he cares, because I {{believe in}} the God of Jacob and he {{believes}} in this snorting, two-legged horse." ...|$|E
5000|$|Vic Nees {{considered}} himself a composer, first and foremost: [...] "I conduct {{to make a}} living, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>live</b> to compose," [...] he said.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Quite right, squire!' {{answered}} a laughing voice {{from behind the}} curtain. 'Smith has a clear two thousand a year, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>live</b> by my wits!' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'No; {{he has his}} {{teaching}} studio in Vitry-sur-Marne. I work {{with him in the}} summer, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>live</b> in London in the winter. I'm a householder.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I guess that's right. I {{was raised}} in the plains, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>lived</b> in Kentucky a while. There's more doing there in a day than there is here in a month. Say, how did you fix it with the old man?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes'm. My name is Chester Benson Stephens, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>lived</b> at Upton with Aunt Harriet Elwell. But she ain't any {{relation}} to me, really. She's only father's stepsister. She--she--wasn't {{kind to me}} and she wouldn't {{let me go to}} school--so I ran away." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{was very}} {{pleasant}} before hoops--in every way," [...] said Mrs. March. [...] "I was young, then; <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>lived</b> in Boston, where I {{suppose it was}} always simpler than in New York. I used to sit on our steps. It was delightful for girls--the freedom." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "What's your name, my beauty, tell me;" [...] And she faintly hansers, [...] "Lore, [...] Sir, my name's Eliza Davis, [...] <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>live</b> at tventy-four." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No; {{he has his}} {{teaching}} studio in Vitry-sur-Marne. I work {{with him in the}} summer, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>live</b> in London in the winter. I'm a householder." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "The coffin {{immediately}} sank, being builded by the ship's carpenter like a boat," [...] Kumuhana confirmed. [...] "And I, {{who was a}} moepuu, {{became a}} man once more. <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>lived,</b> though I died a thousand deaths from thirst before we gained back to the beach at Waikiki.|$|E
60|$|Sylvia {{lived in}} the city, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>lived</b> in the country, and {{although}} I went to her whenever I could, {{and she and her}} mother dined several times with my grandmother, there were often long stretches, sometimes extending over the greater part of the day, when I did not see her at all.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, Mara," [...] said Moses, [...] "I {{would give}} my life, if I could {{take back the}} past. I have never been worthy of you; never knew your worth; never made you happy. You always lived for me, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>lived</b> for myself. I deserve to lose you, but it is none the less bitter." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I am Elisabeth Landon," [...] {{she told}} him. [...] "Mr. Foley is my uncle. My mother <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>live</b> with him <b>and</b> always {{help him to}} entertain." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Oh, I {{speak the}} English, Signore," [...] replied the man, doffing his hat. [...] "I am Silvio Allegheri, you must know, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>live</b> in America some time." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I was a {{young man}} when the Plague came--twenty-seven years old; <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>lived</b> {{on the other side of}} San Francisco Bay, in Berkeley. You {{remember}} those great stone houses, Edwin, when we came down the hills from Contra Costa? That was where I lived, in those stone houses. I was a professor of English literature." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "A strange mountain, Macumazahn," [...] he said, [...] "compared {{to it that}} of the Witch, beneath {{which my}} kraal lies, is but a little baby. I wonder what we shall find within it. I have always loved mountains, Macumazahn, ever since a dead brother of mine <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>lived</b> with the wolves in the Witch's lap, for on them I have had {{the best of my}} fighting." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Taste!" [...] Mr. Bullsom replied, contemptuously. [...] "Taste! What sort {{of taste}} {{do you call}} that beastly rug on your shoulders, eh? Or your hair rolled round and just a pin stuck through it? Looks as though it hadn't been brushed for a week. Faugh! When your mother <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>lived</b> on two pounds a week she never insulted me by coming down to breakfast in such a thing." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Lizzie," [...] she replied, {{softening}} toward him, {{her hand}} pressing his arm, while her body leaned against his. [...] "Lizzie Connolly. <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>live</b> at Fifth an' Market." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Why should death part us?" [...] she answered, looking him bravely in the eyes. [...] "I mean to live beyond death, <b>and</b> while <b>I</b> <b>live</b> <b>and</b> {{wherever}} <b>I</b> <b>live</b> death {{shall not}} part us, if you'll {{be true to}} me." ...|$|R

60|$|And {{that the}} {{strength}} in me had quieted her and given her confidence, {{filled me with}} an exultant joy. The youth of the race seemed burgeoning in me, over-civilized man that I was, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>lived</b> for myself the old hunting days and forest nights of my remote and forgotten ancestry. I had much for which to thank Wolf Larsen, was my thought as we went along the path between the jostling harems.|$|E
6000|$|Mary broke in, [...] "That's what I say. I {{lived on}} a farm <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>lived</b> in Castle Rock. When I lived on the farm I {{wanted to get to}} Castle Rock. When I got to Castle Rock I wanted to get to Madison. Madison made me hone for Chicago, and when I had a chance to come, I just dropped my work at the University and put for the city, and here I am and glad of it." ...|$|E
60|$|I {{think it}} was 'Pendennis' I began with, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>lived</b> in the book to the very last line of it, and made its alien {{circumstance}} mine to the smallest detail. I am still not sure {{but it is the}} author's greatest book, and I speak from a thorough acquaintance with every line he has written, except the Virginians, which I {{have never been able to}} read quite through; most of his work I have read twice, and some of it twenty times.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes; but {{my little}} {{daughter}} <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>live</b> {{with my father}} again." [...] What [...] "came over" [...] her--as they say--to be so frank, {{she could not have}} told.|$|R
6000|$|... "If you knew," [...] said he, at last, [...] "the {{terms on}} which my mother <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>live</b> together, you would {{perceive}} {{that such a}} promise is not needed." ...|$|R
6000|$|I {{suppose she}} thought my {{confidence}} required {{a little more}} confidence in return, for after a slight pause she repeated once more, [...] "My name's Lucretia, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>live</b> at Richmond." ...|$|R
