A deal was made and they optioned the rights to Zodiac and Zodiac Unmasked when they became {{available}} after languishing at another studio for nearly a decade. David Fincher was their first choice to direct based on his work on Seven. Originally, he was going to direct an adaptation of James Ellroy's novel, The Black Dahlia (later filmed by Brian De Palma), and envisioned a five-hour, $80 million mini-series with film stars. When that fell through, Fincher left that project and moved on to Zodiac.|$|E

The surface roughness of the organic membrane is measured around 15 nm, less than λ/ 20 of the visible light. With curve fitting, we found that the actuated membrane is almost parabolic in shape, which leads to less aberration than spherical surfaces. It is suitable for reflective-optics systems.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a novel auto-focusing {{system based on}} a CMOS sensor containing pixels with different phases. Robust extraction of features in a severely defocused image is the fundamental problem of a phase-difference auto-focusing system. In order to solve this problem, a multi-resolution feature extraction algorithm is proposed. Given the extracted features, the proposed auto-focusing system can provide the ideal focusing position using phase correlation matching. The proposed auto-focusing (AF) algorithm consists of four steps: (i) acquisition of left and right images using AF points in the region-of-interest; (ii) feature extraction in the left image under low illumination and out-of-focus blur; (iii) the generation of two feature images using the phase difference between {{the left and right}} images; and (iv) estimation of the phase shifting vector using phase correlation matching. Since the proposed system accurately estimates the phase difference in the out-of-focus blurred image under low illumination, it can provide faster, more robust <b>auto</b> <b>focusing</b> than existing systems...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. In this paper, {{the design}} and {{characteristics}} of a novel ultrasonic motor which is applicable to optical zoom or <b>auto</b> <b>focusing</b> operation of lens system for mobile phone are investigated. Its design and simulation of performances are carried out by FEM (Finite Element Method) commercial software. The shape of the motor is like square without one side, which is able to insert optical lens. Two sheets of piezoelectric ceramic are fixed to {{both sides of the}} two legs of an elastic body, respectively. To drive the ultrasonic motor, the voltage is applied to the two sheets of piezoelectric ceramic bonded to one leg. The rotation direction can be easily changed by switching the applied voltage to the piezoelectric sheets bonded to the other legs. The proto type of motor is fabricated and its outer size is 10 * 10 * 2 mm 3 including the camera lens of which the diameter is 7. 5 mm. Its power consumption is about 0. 3 W and the rotation speed is adjustable from 10 to 200 rpm according to the applied voltage...|$|R
40|$|Line {{detection}} is {{very important}} task in image processing field. It is mainly used in <b>auto</b> <b>focusing</b> camera input sensors. Many techniques used for line detection but gives improper result if noise is present in an input image. Hough transform is famous technique present for line detection which gives proper results in presence of noise and discontinuous shapes in an image. This paper gives comparative study of two techniques of hough transform, both the methods are simulated in Xilinx 13. 2 design suite which is popularly used for FPGA hardware implementation and compared there simulation results. First method is general hough transform, this is very basic method of hough transform in which binary feature image is given as input and vote procedure of hough transform is performed over it. Second method is given by Zhong-Ho Chen, Alvin W. Y. Su, and Ming-Ting Sun in august 2012, this method use incrementing property of hough transform and process all pixels in parallel.

50|$|The a550 {{stands out}} from other DSLR's in its price range with {{its use of}} 2 {{separate}} Live View modes. The first mode operates {{in the same way}} other DSLR's do, by switching from using the main sensor to using a secondary, smaller sensor. This allows the a550 to autofocus in its first Live View mode. However this only provides a 90% view of the final image the main sensor will take.The second Live View mode is named Manual Focus Check Live View. This mode uses the main 14.2 megapixel APS-C Type CMOS Exmor Sensor to provide a 100% view on the rear LCD. This mode does not allow <b>auto</b> <b>focusing,</b> hence the name Manual Focus Check Live View.When in Live View mode the a550 uses its 3.0 TFT Xtra Fine LCD, with 921,600 dots which can be adjusted to point downwards, for overhead shooting or upwards for below eye level shooting. When Live View mode is not in use the optical viewfinder(OVF) is used and only provides 95% coverage of the actual image taken by the sensor.|$|R
