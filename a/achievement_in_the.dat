5|$|The expedition's {{success was}} widely applauded, though {{the story of}} Scott's heroic failure overshadowed its <b>achievement</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> United Kingdom. Amundsen's {{decision}} to keep his true plans secret until the last moment was criticised by some. Recent polar historians have more fully recognised the skill and courage of Amundsen's party; the permanent scientific base at the pole bears his name, together with that of Scott.|$|E
5|$|The {{project was}} never carried out, being {{cancelled}} primarily {{out of a}} fear of a negative public reaction, with the potential militarization of space that it would also have signified, and because a moon landing would undoubtedly be a more popular <b>achievement</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> eyes of the American and international public alike.

5|$|After {{finishing}} as runners-up in Allsvenskan for {{the final}} {{two years of the}} 1960s, Malmö FF started the most successful decade of their history with a Swedish Championship in 1970. The club won Allsvenskan in 1970, 1971, 1974, 1975 and 1977 as well as Svenska Cupen in 1976 and 1978. The 1977 Allsvenskan victory qualified the club for the 1978–79 European Cup, and after victories against AS Monaco, Dynamo Kyiv, Wisła Kraków and Austria Wien, they reached the final of the competition, which they played at Olympiastadion in Munich against Nottingham Forest. Trevor Francis, who scored the only goal of the match, won it 1–0 for Forest. Nevertheless, the 1979 European Cup run is the biggest success in the history of Malmö FF.

5|$|As Messi {{maintained}} his goalscoring form {{into the second}} half of the season, the year 2012 saw him break several longstanding records. On 7 March, two weeks after scoring four goals in a league fixture against Valencia, he scored five times in a Champions League last 16-round match against Bayer Leverkusen, an unprecedented <b>achievement</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> history of the competition. In addition to being the joint top assist provider with five assists, this feat made him top scorer with 14 goals, tying José Altafini's record from the 1962–63 season, as well as becoming only the second player after Gerd Müller to be top scorer in four campaigns. Two weeks later, on 20 March, Messi became the top goalscorer in Barcelona's history at 24 years old, overtaking the 57-year record of César Rodríguez's 232 goals with a hat-trick against Granada.|$|E
5|$|Brighton & Hove Albion Football Club is an English {{association}} {{football club}} {{based in the}} city of Brighton and Hove, East Sussex. The club was founded in 1901 and played in the Southern League from the 1901–02 season until 1920, when that league's first division was absorbed into the Football League.

As a Football League team, Albion have won three divisional titles at the third level of the English football league system and two at the fourth.

5|$|Great Britain's cycling team {{consisted}} of ten riders, including returning Paralympic gold medalists Aileen McGlynn, her tandem partner Ellen Hunter, and Darren Kenny.

The Paralympic cycling team, coached by Chris Furber and managed Helen Mortimer, trained alongside the British Olympic cycling team. Darren Kenny won five medals, four gold and one silver, more golds than any other British competitor at these Games. Cundy set a new world record and won two gold medals on the track to add to his five swimming medals from previous Games; this meant he matched Rebecca Romero's <b>achievement</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Olympics of becoming a medal winner in two different sports. In all British cyclists won twenty medals, seventeen of them gold, to top the cycling medal tables for both road and track events.|$|E
