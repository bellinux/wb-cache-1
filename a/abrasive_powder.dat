To obtain the smooth surface of STAVAX ESR, the material removal mechanism in the paper is discussed. The experiment is processed on the ultra-precision plane polishing machine (Nanopoli- 100). The experiment processes are as follows. Rough lapping and Ultra-precision lapping: the material of lapping pads is cast iron. # 1000 Al 203 (10 wt%) <b>abrasive</b> <b>powders</b> are used in rough lapping.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: The {{abrasion}} of dentifrices is well recognized {{to eliminate}} the dental plaque. The aims {{of this study were}} to characterize the <b>abrasive</b> <b>powders</b> of 6 dentifrices (3 toothpastes and 3 toothpowders) and to measure the abrasion on a test surface by Vertical Scanning Interference microscopy (VSI). MATERIAL AND METHODS: Bright field and polarization microscopy were used to identify the abrasive particles on the crude dentifrices and after prolonged washes. Scanning electron microscopy and microanalysis characterized the shape and nature of the particles. Standardized and polished blocks of poly(methylmethacrylate) were brushed with a commercial electric toothbrush with the dentifrices. VSI quantified the mean roughness (Ra) and illustrated in 3 D the abraded areas. RESULTS: Toothpastes induced a limited abrasion. Toothpowders induced a significantly higher roughness linked {{to the size of the}} <b>abrasive</b> particles.

40|$|Three-body {{abrasion}} is {{an important}} abrasive process in the surface finishing of ceramics and glasses. Generally {{it is assumed that}} material removal is achieved by rolling (indenting) particles. In this study, the removal rate of glass has been determined using SiC slurry as the abrasive and Cu as counter material. For large abrasive particle sizes the removal rate remains constant with time, while for small abrasive grain sizes it decreases. This is attributed to fracture and blunting of the abrasive particles. Displacement measurements revealed a decreasing ratio of bed thickness and mean abrasive particle size with particle size. The results are related to the particle size distributions of the <b>abrasive</b> <b>powders</b> used. On the basis of the particle size distributions, it can be concluded that the actual particle size distribution between workpiece and backing plate is different from the distribution of the slurry not lodged between both plates...|$|R

At the same, a long epithelial lining at the peri-implant pocket with minimal bone-gingival attachment can be a factor in the development of emphysema after the use of air-abrasive powder in peri-implantitis treatment [16]. Inadvertent angulation of the nozzle tip into a gingival pocket can also lead to this condition [17]. Therefore, careful attention should be devoted to angulation and distance between the nozzle of the air-abrasive device and the implant surface, and continuous application of the devices should be discouraged.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: Current {{frictional}} materials, {{for example}} automotive brakes, consist of ingredients (<b>abrasive</b> <b>powders,</b> steel or copper chips, binders etc.) with very diverse physical, engineering and thermal properties. The authors believe {{that several of}} the problems associated with such frictional materials (low contact area, noise, vibration, temperature development and dissipation) can be overcome if ingredients have smaller diversity in their properties. Furthermore, the production cost of such materials can also be reduced through large volume use of industrial wastes readily available in most countries in the world. Working in cooperation with industrial partners, the authors have made considerable progress toward development and characterization of such materials over the last 4 -months. Additional studies are continuing to optimize composition of such frictional materials and develop commercially viable brake pads. Industrial partners will test these materials and modify them, in cooperation with authors, to implement their production and marketing.

In the present investigation, basic studies were conducted using 'Inclined Scratch Test' to understand the mechanism of transfer layer formation during sliding of pins made of an Al-Mg alloy on EN 8 steel flats of different surface roughness under dry and lubricated conditions. The surfaces produced can be categorized into three different types: (a) uni-directional (b) 8 -ground and (c) random.
