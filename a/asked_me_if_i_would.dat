I loved doing the morning show for 2½ years but I am also {{looking forward to}} not getting up at 4 am any more. If you've ever had a morning job like this, you {{probably}} know the relief I feel, but I will still miss seeing Liz and Jose every day, having David Lynch as my weatherman, and talking to Timothy Olyphant about sports each morning. These will always rank with the coolest things I’ve ever been fortunate enough to do in my entire life.|$|E

This organization {{has been at the}} very center of my musical life for 17 years. I am very proud and honored that they would even consider me for such a prestigious title and it gives me great pleasure to accept. The Los Angeles Philharmonic will always play an important role in my life and this is a symbol of our continuing relationship." ...|$|E

[...] Arnell said:The record was a hit over in Asia and they <b>asked</b> <b>me</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> be nice enough to record the song in Japanese for them. [...] I thought [...] "What?!" [...] But MGM was very good about sending a tutor [...] {{taught me how to}} sing it phonetically. [...] It was very exciting and it came out OK. [...] I don't know if it's word-for-word as the American version, but it sure is nice to listen to...|$|E

2500|$|Charles Grean of Dot Records had {{arranged}} with {{the studio to}} do an album of space music based on music from Star Trek, {{and he has a}} teenage daughter who's a fan of the show and a fan of Mr. Spock. She said, 'Well, if you're going to do an album of music from Star Trek, then Mr. Spock should be on the album.' So Dot contacted me and <b>asked</b> <b>me</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> be interested in either speaking or singing on the record. I said I was very interested in doing both. ...That was the first album we did, which was called Mr. Spock's Music from Outer Space. It was very well received and successful enough that Dot then approached me and asked me to sign a long-term contract.|$|E
2500|$|Apart {{from the}} {{betrayal}} of the POUMists, the terror and the murder of Nin and Smillie, Orwell had been depressed by {{the attitude of the}} British press. [...] "In Spain ... I saw newspaper reports which did not bear any relation to the facts ... I saw, in fact, history being written not in terms of what happened but of what ought to have happened according to various party lines." [...] Carr writes, [...] "He was appalled at the treatment of the May days as a 'Trotskyist Revolt' in papers like the News Chronicle which simply swallowed uncritically the Communist line; or Ralph Bates' report in The New Republic that POUM militiamen were playing football with Fascist troops ... Given this supresio vero by interested parties, how could true history be written? Propaganda would pass as truth; 'facts' could be manipulated. Those who monopolized communication could create their own history after the event—the nightmare of Nineteen Eighty-Four." [...] Orwell attacked sections of the left wing press for suppressing the truth about Spain, indicting the Communists for instigating a [...] "reign of terror"; and he never forgave Kingsley Martin, the editor of the New Statesman who turned down his articles on the Spanish Civil War {{on the grounds that they}} [...] "could cause trouble." [...] Malcolm Muggeridge remembered: [...] "Once when we were lunching at a Greek restaurant in Percy Street he <b>asked</b> <b>me</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> mind changing places. I readily agreed but asked him why. He said that he just couldn't bear to look at Kingsley Martin's corrupt face, which, as Kingsley was lunching at an adjoining table, was unavoidable from where he had been sitting before." [...] "Ten years ago it was almost impossible to get anything printed in favour of Communism; today it is almost impossible to get anything printed in favour of Anarchism or 'Trotskyism'," [...] Orwell wrote bitterly in 1938.|$|E
2500|$|Tendulkar's {{allegations}} {{were supported by}} former teammates such as Zaheer Khan, Harbhajan Singh and V. V. S. Laxman. Zaheer called Chappell a [...] "control freak" [...] and said, [...] "After he was appointed {{the coach of the}} Indian team, he once came upto me and told [...] "Zaheer, you will not be playing for India till I remain the coach". He also added that the two-year term under Chappell was [...] "easily the worst and darkest phase" [...] that he could remember. Harbhajan said, [...] "Chappell destroyed Indian cricket {{to such an extent that}} it required at least 3 years to again get back on track. The worst part was some players in that team, who sucked upto the coach and would supply selective misinformation creating bigger rifts". He also talked about the email leak, [...] "Sourav was batting out there in the middle and this man was typing a critical e-mail against Sourav, sitting right there in that dressing room. He had no interest in the proceedings of the match. There were seven guys that he wanted to get rid of. Sourav was his primary target followed by myself, Virender Sehwag, Ashish Nehra, Zaheer Khan and Yuvraj Singh". Laxman was also critical of Chappell in saying that Chappell took Indian cricket [...] "backwards" [...] during his coaching tenure. Laxman also recalled an incident from 2006, [...] "This happened in 2006 at the Wankhede Stadium when India played versus England. Yuvraj Singh was picked ahead of me. We were going to the West Indies for a four-Test series after that and he <b>asked</b> <b>me</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> open. I mentioned in 2000 I had decided I would not open anymore after it didn't work for me in the first four years. I was consistent in the middle order since 2000. Chappell asked me my age and said - Don't you think 31 is too young an age to sit at home? I was astonished to hear this. I had a very good run under him. I was the second highest run scorer under him." ...|$|E
