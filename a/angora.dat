Hunter-gatherers have used animal sinews as lashings and bindings. Leather from cattle, pigs and other species is widely used to make shoes, handbags, belts and many other items. Animals have been hunted and farmed for their fur, to make items such as coats and hats, again ranging from simply warm and practical to the most elegant and expensive.|$|E

She loaded Clough's ship with her most prized possessions, including six of her favorite Turkish <b>Angora</b> cats. Although she did not make it to the United States, her pets safely reached the shores of Wiscasset, Maine, where they bred with other short-haired breeds and developed into the modern breed of the Maine Coon.|$|E

In this study, sarcoplasmic proteins of Orthrias tigris, Orthrias <b>angorae</b> bureschi, Orthrias panthera and Cobitis taenia {{were analyzed}} by Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). In the electrophoregram, 13 sarcoplasmic protein bands were obtained from Orthrias <b>angorae</b> bureschi and Orthrias panthera. Nevertheless, 5 protein bands of these fishes were mutually calculated and similarity coefficient (SC) was found as 0. 384. Sarcoplasmic protein bands of Orthrias tigris and Cobitis taenia were 8 and 12, respectively. 2 sarcoplasmic protein bands of Orthrias tigris and Cobitis taenia {{were found to be}} similar and similarity coefficient (SC) was 0. 166. However, 2 sarcoplasmic protein bands of Cobitis taenia and Orthrias <b>angorae</b> bureschi were similar and similarity coefficient (SC) was found as 0. 153. All the sarcoplasmic protein bands of Cobitis taenia and Orthrias panthera were observed to be different. On the other hand, 1 sarcoplasmic protein band of Orthrias <b>angorae</b> bureschi and Orthrias tigris was found to be similar and similarity coefficient (SC) was found as 0. 076. 3 sarcoplasmic protein bands of Orthrias tigris and Orthrias panthera were found to be similar and similarity coefficient (SC) was found as 0. 230. Similarities and differences of Orthrias tigris, Orthrias <b>angorae</b> bureschi, Orthrias panthera and Cobitis taenia which highly resemble each other morphologically in term of sarcoplasmic protein bands were electrophoretically found out.

N. <b>angorae</b> is a teleports fish exhibiting a spontaneous sex reversal (male to female) pattern. The gonads of adult individuals were dissected and used for histological investigation and protein analysis. Proteins were next analyzed using two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and the distinguished spots have been compared in two experimental samples. Among them, 23 differentially expressed proteins spots were identified by MALDI-TOF/TOF analysis. Two spots in sex reversed testis with high score showed significant similarity to Vasa (assembling of the pole plasm and the pronuclear region of the oocyte) and Proline 4 -hydroxylase proteins. Vasa are involved in germ cell development both in invertebrates and vertebrates.

25|$|To make various yarns, besides adding novelty elements, spinners {{can vary}} {{all the same}} things as in a {{machined}} yarn, i.e., the fibre, the preparation, the colour, the spinning technique, {{the direction of the}} twist, etc. A common misconception is yarn spun from rolags may not be as strong, but the strength of a yarn is actually based on the length of hair fibre and the degree of twist. When working with shorter hairs, such as llama or <b>angora</b> rabbit, the spinner may choose to integrate longer fibres, such as mohair, to prevent yarn breakage.
