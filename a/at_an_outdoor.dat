5|$|The {{crowd is}} {{notoriously}} loud during Seahawks games.

The current record was set by fans at Arrowhead on September 29, 2014, in a Monday Night Football game against the New England Patriots, hitting 142.2 decibels. The noise {{has contributed to the}} team's home field advantage with an increase in false start (movement by an offensive player prior to the play) and delay of game (failure of the offense to snap the ball prior to the play clock expiring) penalties against visiting teams. The stadium was the first in the NFL to implement a FieldTurf artificial field. Numerous college and high school American football games have also been played at the stadium.|$|E

In another house, a woman (played by Fabián) wakes up recalling the events of her abusive husband (played by Zamora). She enters a church and says a prayer. Later, Vives is seen hanging out with two men <b>at</b> <b>an</b> <b>outdoor</b> bar when he spots the woman whom he immediately becomes smitten with. Afterwards, he {{and the two men}} are fishing on a boat when Vives sees the woman again. He begins having illusions of him and the woman having a happy life together which drives him insane in his room. That night, the woman finds her husband making love to another woman in a car.

25|$|At outdoor pow wows, this {{circle is}} often covered by either a committee-built arbor or tent, or each group, {{particularly}} the MC and the drums, will provide their own. While {{most of the}} time, a tent provides shelter from the sun, rain can also plague outdoor events.

Most vendors provide their own tents or shelters <b>at</b> <b>an</b> <b>outdoor</b> pow wow.|$|E

25|$|When {{there is}} a high {{temperature}} differential (e.g., when an air-source heat pump is used to heat a house with an outside temperature of, say, 0°C (32°F)), it takes more work to move the same amount of heat to indoors than on a milder day. Ultimately, due to Carnot efficiency limits, the heat pump's performance will decrease as the outdoor-to-indoor temperature difference increases (outside temperature gets colder), reaching a theoretical limit of 1.0 at −273°C. In practice, a COP of 1.0 will typically be reached <b>at</b> <b>an</b> <b>outdoor</b> temperature around −18°C (0°F) for air source heat pumps.|$|E
25|$|Before he {{directed}} the episode, director Chris Hardwell spent five {{weeks on the}} Numb3rs set watching {{the cast and crew}} film the series.

He also directed guest star Robin Weigert to act like the perfect housewife in order to disguise the plot twist. Several scenes were shot at Caltech, including one near the Beckham Auditorium and one <b>at</b> <b>an</b> <b>outdoor</b> restaurant. For the final scene, Hardwell used a crane shot on the Numb3rs sound stage.|$|E
