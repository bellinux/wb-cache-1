5|$|I {{should not}} be {{surprised}} if this were to terminate in my death. I did not expect to encounter what has beset me since my elevation to the Presidency. God knows I have endeavored to fulfill what I conceived to be <b>an</b> <b>honest</b> duty. But I have been mistaken. My motives have been misconstrued, and my feelings most grossly outraged.|$|E
5|$|Jayakumar {{said that}} while the Government {{recognized}} that the subjective test enhanced the potential for abuse of executive discretion under the ISA, the best safeguard against such abuse of power was not to give the courts powers of judicial review because an unscrupulous government could still tamper with the composition of the courts to impair this judicial check. Instead, the crucial safeguard was for the electorate to make wise voting choices to put <b>an</b> <b>honest</b> and incorruptible government into power.|$|E

5|$|Some {{animals such as}} many moths, mantises and grasshoppers, have a {{repertory}} {{of threatening}} or startling behaviour, such as suddenly displaying conspicuous eyespots or patches of bright and contrasting colours, so as to scare off or momentarily distract a predator. This gives the prey animal an opportunity to escape. The behaviour is deimatic (startling) rather than aposematic as these insects are palatable to predators, so the warning colours are a bluff, not <b>an</b> <b>honest</b> signal.|$|E
5|$|There {{have been}} {{suggestions}} that leaf shedding {{may be a}} response that provides protection against diseases and certain kinds of pests such as leaf miners and gall forming insects. Other responses such as the change of leaf colors prior to fall have also been suggested as adaptations that may help undermine the camouflage of herbivores. Autumn leaf color has also been suggested to act as <b>an</b> <b>honest</b> warning signal of defensive commitment towards insect pests that migrate to the trees in autumn.|$|E
5|$|Warren {{convened a}} meeting of the justices, and {{presented}} to them the simple argument that the only reason to sustain segregation was <b>an</b> <b>honest</b> belief in the inferiority of Negroes. Warren further submitted that the Court must overrule Plessy to maintain its legitimacy as an institution of liberty, and it must do so unanimously to avoid massive Southern resistance. He began to build a unanimous opinion.|$|E

5|$|Although fantasy {{comes from}} an imaginative realm, Martin sees <b>an</b> <b>honest</b> {{necessity}} to reflect the real world where people die sometimes ugly deaths, even beloved people. Main characters are killed off so that the reader will not expect the supposed hero to survive, and instead will feel the same tension and fear that the characters might. The novels also reflect the substantial death rates in war. The deaths of supernumerary extras or orcs have no major effect on readers, whereas a friend's death has much more emotional impact. Martin prefers a hero's sacrifice to say something profound about human nature.|$|E
5|$|And {{what say}} {{you to the}} game at chestes? It is truely <b>an</b> <b>honest</b> kynde of enterteynmente and wittie, quoth Syr Friderick.

Therfore in this I beleave there happeneth a very rare thing, namely, that the meane is more commendable, then the excellency.|$|E
5|$|Carry {{leaves the}} home that Fenwick has found her and wanders distraught.

Her father reluctantly allows her {{to remain in the}} family home; eventually he too forgives her, although he can never forget the shame she has brought on the family. Carry remains with her family {{for the rest of her}} life, but although she has returned to decency, her past ensures that she will never find <b>an</b> <b>honest</b> husband.|$|E

5|$|In 1953 Tange and the {{architectural}} journalist and critic Noboru Kawazoe {{were invited to}} attend {{the reconstruction of the}} Ise Shrine. The shrine has been reconstructed every 20years and in 1953 it was the 59th iteration. Normally the reconstruction process was a very closed affair but this time the ceremony was opened to architects and journalists to document the event. The ceremony coincided {{with the end of the}} American Occupation and it seemed to symbolise a new start in Japanese architecture. In 1965 when Tange and Kawazoe published the book Ise: Prototype of Japanese Architecture, he likened the building to a modernist structure: <b>an</b> <b>honest</b> expression of materials, a functional design and prefabricated elements.|$|E
5|$|In the Rhineland, Custine {{continued}} the revolution by proclamation, and levied heavy {{taxes on the}} nobility and clergy. During the winter a Prussian army forced him to evacuate Frankfurt, re-cross the Rhine and fall back upon Landau. This occurred during Charles François Dumouriez's treasonous collaboration with the Austrians. Summoned to Paris to account for himself, Custine was accused of treason, but was ably defended by Robespierre, the French revolutionary and lawyer, who declared Custine <b>an</b> <b>honest</b> man who gave his country good service. With Robespierre's defense, he was cleared of all charges, and later given command of the Army of the North.|$|E
5|$|The Hadza {{people of}} Tanzania also share food, {{possibly}} to gain in reputation. Hunters cannot be sharing meat mainly to provision their families or to gain reciprocal benefits, as teenage boys often give away their meat {{even though they}} do not yet have wives or children, so costly signalling of their qualities is the likely explanation. These qualities include good eyesight, coordination, strength, knowledge, endurance, or bravery. Hadza hunters more often pair with highly fertile, hard-working wives than non-hunters. A woman benefits from mating with a man who possesses such qualities as her children will most likely inherit qualities that increase fitness and survivorship. She may also benefit from her husband’s high social status. Thus, hunting is <b>an</b> <b>honest</b> and costly signal of phenotypic quality.|$|E

5|$|A {{lingering}} controversy {{exists in}} ichthyology over {{the validity of}} the four species Beebe described on the basis of visual descriptions only, which he had observed during his Bathysphere dives. The naming of a new species ordinarily requires obtaining and analyzing a type specimen, something which was obviously impossible from inside the Bathysphere. Some of Beebe's critics claimed that these fish were illusions resulting from condensation on the Bathysphere's window, or even that Beebe willfully made them up, although the latter would have been strongly at odds with Beebe's reputation as <b>an</b> <b>honest</b> and rigorous scientist. While many of Beebe's observations from the Bathysphere have since been confirmed by advances in undersea photography, it is unclear whether others fit the description of any known sea animal. One possibility is that although these animals indeed exist, so much remains to be discovered about life in the deep ocean that these animals have yet to be seen by anyone other than him.|$|E
5|$|Eventually, an {{accounting}} teacher arrives, believing demonstrations {{are being held}} to determine which class will be cut, much to the anger of Ron. He gives a very boring accounting lecture, which puts Justin to sleep. The next day, Leslie is before the Pawnee Disciplinary Committee on charges of abuse of power. Leslie calls Justin as a witness and questions him {{as to whether he}} enjoyed the party, to which he answers an emphatic yes. Afterward, the committee rules no further action will be taken, mainly because Leslie turned herself in and paid $1,000 restitution to the recreation center so no classes would be cut. When Ann asks why she did it, Leslie said it was to get <b>an</b> <b>honest</b> answer from Justin about the date, under penalty of perjury. The episode ends with Justin encouraging Tom to ask Wendy out.|$|E
5|$|Fenton and Licht {{note that}} the effect of a rattlesnake's {{rattling}} could be deimatic (startle) in inexperienced animals, whether predators or large animals that might injure the snake by stepping on it, but aposematic (a warning signal) in animals that are aware of the rattle's meaning. They refer to the work of Fenton and his colleague David Bates on the responses of the big brown bat, Eptesicus fuscus, to the defensive clicks made by moths in the family Arctiidae, which includes the garden tiger moth, Arctia caja. This family includes large, furry, bitter-tasting or poisonous moths. They found that while sounds can startle inexperienced bats, after a few trials the bats ignored the sounds if the prey was edible; but the same sounds can warn experienced bats of bitter-tasting prey (<b>an</b> <b>honest</b> signal).|$|E

5|$|Gierek, like Gomułka in 1956, came {{to power}} on a raft of {{promises}} that everything would be different from now on: wages would rise, prices would remain stable, there would be freedom of speech, and {{those responsible for the}} violence at Gdynia and elsewhere would be punished. Although Poles were much more skeptical than they had been in 1956, Gierek was believed to be <b>an</b> <b>honest</b> and well-intentioned man, and his promises bought him some time. He used this time to create a new economic program, one based on large-scale borrowing from banks in the West — mainly from the United States and West Germany — to buy technology that would upgrade Poland's production of export goods. This massive borrowing, estimated to have totaled over 24 billion US (1970s) dollars during Gierek's years, was used to re-equip and modernize Polish industry, and to import consumer goods to give the workers more incentive to work.|$|E
5|$|Mahesh {{played the}} role of Shankar, an {{encounter}} specialist similar to the one he played in Dookudu. This was the third time Mahesh {{played the role}} of a police officer in his career. Tamannaah was signed as the female lead and she {{played the role of}} a local sweet shop owner. She sported a traditional attire for her look in the film. Rajendra Prasad was chosen to play Mahesh's father in the film. Prakash Raj was selected to play a negative role in the film. He was later replaced with Sonu Sood due to his creative differences with Vaitla. Brahmaji played the role of <b>an</b> <b>honest</b> police constable. Shruti Haasan performed an item number in the film which was the first of her other similar special appearances. Brahmanandam was signed to play a supporting role. He performed a spoof of Racha (2011), Legend (2014) and Race Gurram (2014). Mahesh performed a spoof on the game show Meelo Evaru Koteeswarudu.|$|E
5|$|Section 1(3) of the 1971 Act {{specifies}} that offences {{under section}} 1, where the destruction or damage {{is caused by}} fire, shall be charged as arson. It would seem that courts adopt a purposive view {{in relation to the}} lawful excuse defence in relation to arson, as in R v. Hunt (1977). The defendant, wishing to highlight the lack of fire defences in an old people's home, set fire to it to demonstrate the risks. He claimed <b>an</b> <b>honest</b> belief in that by doing this, he had a lawful excuse within section 5(2). It was held, however, that he had not actually been acting so as to protect property. Although the court assumed that his belief was honest, it ruled that his intention was to draw attention to faulty fire defences rather than to defend the property itself.|$|E
