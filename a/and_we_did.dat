25|$|Interscope gave us, like, {{a million}} bucks last year, and we built a {{recording}} studio, and then they basically didn't do too well with Pummel, so we bailed out and took our recording studio with us. I think the thing they didn't realize, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>did</b> realize, is that it's easier to market some of those mall punk bands because you've got the fashion that's there with it; you know, the nice hairdos and the fake British accents. But with All or Descendents, it's basically these ugly dork people playing music. They thought they could market {{it because it was}} the right music, but the fact of it is that the music doesn't {{have anything to do with}} anything, really. We knew that.|$|E

They give you a schedule like, 'You have lunch with Heidi [...] at 3 to talk about the party coming up' or whatever the situation may be".

A steadicam attached to a cameraman was used to show a slight unsteadiness, {{and each of the}} Stargazer crew members were filmed individually on the bridge against a smoke background before being superimposed together. He explained, [...] "we went dark in a lot of scenes <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>did</b> different angles and things the show hadn't done yet. For me, it was a real creative stretch and it felt great for the show." [...] The bridge itself was a re-dress of the film-era Klingon Bird of Prey bridge. The term [...] "Picard Maneuver" [...] was later used offscreen to refer informally to Patrick Stewart's habit of tugging his uniform shirt down, and the Battle of Maxia itself was described in the first chapter of the pre-TNG era novel The Buried Age.|$|E
500|$|... "Medusa" [...] {{was written}} by {{executive}} producer Frank Spotnitz and directed by Richard Compton. Reportedly, because {{of the scope of}} the episode, a [...] "huge budget" [...] was allotted for the entry. Because the episode was written to take place in a subway system, a set meeting the requirements of the script had to be created. The eventual set was designed to mirror the actual Boston subway, a system that serves more than 700,000 people a day. According to star Robert Patrick, [...] "They got us in there, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>did</b> it, and they built a huge subway tunnel set on a soundstage." [...] Patrick later described the set as [...] "the biggest damned thing I'd ever seen in my life." [...] In real life, the Boston subway system is [...] "fondly" [...] called the T, short for the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority.

500|$|In an {{interview}} with Entertainment Weekly, Clarkson explains that [...] "Behind These Hazel Eyes" [...] is [...] "about the dipstick who completely screwed up and now is unhappy and you're happy." [...] She also considered the song {{as one of her}} favorites that she once intended to name Breakaway after the song. Critics speculated that the song reflects Clarkson's break-up with David Hodges, an ex-member of Evanescence. According to MTV, the song was originally written prior to the break-up. Nonetheless, Clarkson decided to tweak the song lyrics after breaking up with Hodges to express her emotional pain. Clarkson also said that the song almost did not make it into the album. She explained, [...] "It had different lyrics in the beginning [...] I ended up calling Luke , the writer, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>did</b> a totally different song to it. It's now my favorite song on the record. Crappy relationships [...] a good song." ...|$|E
500|$|Record {{producer}} Greg Fidelman {{said that}} [...] "the {{fact that the}} songs were still new and fresh to them, and they hadn't been playing them for six months in rehearsal, kept the vibe and excitement in the studio very high."

In making this album, we seemed to share the same vision from song ideas to titles; when we get together as Slayer, it just happens, nothing is contrived, it's not thought out, we just do it, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>did</b> that with this new album." [...] Lombardo said that Hanneman's writing and performance had [...] "gone back to this great punk energy, especially with 'Psychopathy Red'." ...|$|E

We're {{just going to have to}} go there and do it the old-fashioned way next week and try to beat them on the race track." [...] Afterward, Newman, who finished second, commented, [...] "We were saving fuel the whole time. Made more sense to save fuel. We were two laps short. We just did what I thought we needed to do. If Carl made it, Carl made it." [...] Fifth place finisher Johnson described his happiness by saying: [...] "We're going to go home and we're going to make sure we have the best engines, go through our simulation stuff, make sure our car is as fast as it can be and then race. We were in a good situation and could take the risk, take the chance. It worked out for us.|$|E

The singer asked her fans to send a thought inspired by the song or a personal story derived from their identification with [...] "Hasta la Raíz". [...] "I thought that we would get few answers, but received almost 800 responses immediately, and later {{it turned into a}} riot <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>did</b> not know if they would get out of control, but nothing happened, my fans are super cool," [...] Lafourcade told Variety Latino. In the video, shot in black and white, Lafourcade is surrounded by several people who lead her to a stage to perform {{the last part of the}} song, in the meantime, Lafourcade throws flowers in the air, kisses a guy and plays a guitar. According to Milly Contreras of Latin Post the video [...] "shows off the singer's individuality and simplicity" [...] and included it at number 7 in the list for the [...] "10 Best Latin Music Videos of 2015".|$|E
500|$|Tim Ferguson met Richard Fidler busking on {{the streets}} of Canberra in 1984, while they were both {{attending}} university. Ferguson recalls: [...] "Richard was playing the guitar—something from Cat Stevens—one day and I walked up to him <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>did</b> 'Wild Thing'. I sang a few lyrics and jumped about like a mad thing. Lo and behold we made a stack of money in ten minutes." [...] The two began performing together and joined with another friend, Robert Piper, to form the Doug Anthony All Stars. They derived their name from Doug Anthony, a former Country Party leader and Deputy Prime Minister of Australia. According to Fidler, during their earlier gigs in clubs and as street performers, Ferguson was [...] "a bit of an explosive hippie" [...] while Fidler and Piper were more reserved. Robert Piper left the group in 1985 due to other commitments. Piper has gone on to a successful career with the United Nations and in March 2013 was named Deputy Special Coordinator for the Middle East Peace Process and the humanitarian coordinator for the Occupied Palestinian Territory.|$|E

An MPD spokesperson explained [...] "The Metropolitan Police Department is not the lead agency on presidential motorcades <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>did</b> not want to portray ourselves as such". As a result, the production crews did a last minute filming of the desired scenes back in Baltimore. The next day, Mayor of the District of Columbia Vincent Gray stated that there was confusion on what role the MPD would play in the filming. A spokesperson from his office stated that [...] ""MPD {{is not going to}} rent itself out as extras for film ... That's what MPD's decision was focused on. We're not going to be actors." [...] On October 2, all issues were resolved and the motorcade was filmed as originally planned without any MPD personnel [...] "actively participate in the filming".|$|E

[...] Scott said, [...] "I got the crew together and said, 'Okay guys, here we go. This {{is going to be}} a lot more vampy and fun,' and cranked up the ghetto blaster with rock music and away we went." [...] Because of the subject, Scott was able to increase the episode's level of sexual content. [...] Scott said, [...] "we did two takes that were on the edge of tasteful vampire sexuality, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>did</b> a third take where Lucy really let loose.

It’s not anything too over the top; it’s just right where it needs to be." [...] During a chat with fans on Ustream.tv on September 27, 2010, Brown said that {{the song was}} written in 15minutes; [...] "We actually got the beat <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>did</b> it in no time.

500|$|In January 1980, the {{producers}} and writers began plotting the culminating episodes for season 3. Executive producer Philip Capice says {{they decided to}} attempt {{to work in a}} ploy to hold interest over the summer. CBS ordered two extra episodes, which gave them a chance to weave many storylines into the scripts. He noted that [...] "J.R. had developed into a character we felt everyone out there wanted to see get his comeuppance. <b>And</b> <b>we</b> <b>did</b> need that sort of a cliffhanger to carry us over to the new season." [...] He said that there was consensus that a mystery with several suspects was optimal and that it should be a sudden event. Capice denied rumors that the shooting was a ploy to make it easy to write Hagman out of the script if his contract negotiations became too difficult. Producer Leonard Katzman, executive story consultant Art Lewis and story editor Camille Marchetta decided the actual culprit in mid-March by process of logical elimination with the belief that the audience should not be surprised by someone who was not important to the show as the shooter.|$|E
