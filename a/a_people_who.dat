5|$|Accusations of Żydokomuna {{accompanied}} the incidents of anti-Jewish violence in Poland during Polish–Soviet War of 1920, legitimized as self-defense against <b>a</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> were oppressors of the Polish nation. Some soldiers and {{officers in the}} Polish eastern territories shared the conviction that Jews were enemies of the Polish nation-state and were collaborators with Poland's enemies. Some of these troops treated all Jews as Bolsheviks. According to some sources, anticommunist sentiment was implicated in anti-Jewish violence and killings {{in a number of}} towns, including the Pinsk massacre, in which 35 Jews, taken as hostages, were murdered, and the Lwów pogrom during the Polish-Ukrainian War, in which 72 Jews were killed. Occasional instances of Jewish support for Bolshevism during the Polish-Soviet War served to heighten anti-Jewish sentiment.|$|E
5|$|The Gesta Hungarorum {{describes}} pre-conquest Transylvania as {{a country}} rich in salt and gold, which was raided by Turkic peoples"Cumans and Pechenegs"before {{the arrival of the}} Magyars. Archaeological research indicates that <b>a</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> cremated their dead inhabited the regions of the Transylvanian salt mines from the seventh to the ninth centuries. Although excavated weapons suggest a military elite, none of the early-medieval Transylvanian fortresses uncovered can be reliably dated before the 10th century. The Gesta Hungarorum states that Gelou's duchy was inhabited by Vlachs and Slavs; most toponyms recorded by the chronicler in connection with Gelou's duchy are of Magyar origin. According to the Gesta Hungarorum, Tétény (or Tuhutum), who was one of seven Magyar chieftains, defeated Gelou's army at the Meseş Gates and Gelou was killed at the Căpuș River as he fled towards his unnamed fortress. Gelou's subjects then yielded to Tuhutum without further resistance.|$|E
5|$|Ancestors of Vedar {{migrated}} to Sri Lanka via the Indian sub continent during the pre-historic period. A number of Mesolithic sites have been excavated containing human remains dated to 35,000 BCE. Anthropologists consider these skeletal remains {{to belong to}} a group ancestral to some of the surviving Vedar groups. Sri Lanka has also yielded Megalithic burial sites, one of which was excavated close to a present Vedar settlement, Kathiraveli. The precise time in which some of the Vedar lineage founders {{migrated to}} the east coast of Sri Lanka is unknown. The earliest written reference to Vedar is a Tamil chronicle, Nadukadu paraveni kalvettu, which is maintained amongst the custodians of a prominent Hindu temple in the town of Tirukovil in the Ampara District. It is a Tamil 14th to 16th-century original text. The chronicle documents the presence of <b>a</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> practiced hunting and gathering for survival, exercising jurisdiction over vast jungle tracts close to the Akkaraipattu township. It names a number of Vedar chiefs, such as Kadariyan and Puliyan. These Vedars were not just hunter-gatherers, but were also accepted as the rightful owners of the forest lands.|$|E

25|$|The Hurrians were <b>a</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> {{settled in}} north western Mesopotamia and South-East Anatolia in 1600 BC. By 1450 BC they {{established}} a medium-sized empire under a Mitanni ruling class, and temporarily made tributary vassals out of kings in the west, making them {{a major threat}} for the Pharaoh in Egypt until their overthrow by Assyria.

25|$|The Hurrian {{language}} was spoken by the Hurrians (Khurrites), <b>a</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> entered northern Mesopotamia around 2300 BC and had mostly vanished by 1000 BC. Hurrian was {{the language of}} the Mitanni kingdom in northern Mesopotamia, and was likely spoken at least initially in Hurrian settlements in Syria.

25|$|The {{earliest}} Tibetan historical texts {{identify the}} Zhang Zhung culture as <b>a</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> migrated from the Amdo region {{into what is}} now the region of Guge in western Tibet. Zhang Zhung is considered to be the original home of the Bön religion. By the 1st century BCE, a neighboring kingdom arose in the Yarlung valley, and the Yarlung king, Drigum Tsenpo, attempted to remove the influence of the Zhang Zhung by expelling the Zhang's Bön priests from Yarlung. He was assassinated and Zhang Zhung continued its dominance of the region until it was annexed by Songtsen Gampo in the 7th century. Prior to Songtsen Gampo, the kings of Tibet were more mythological than factual, and there is insufficient evidence of their existence.|$|E
25|$|Isleño {{traditional}} folklore in Louisiana is varied.

The Isleños are known as <b>a</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> love to sing and will adopt almost any song regardless of origin, making it their own over time, (e.g., the Mexican songs Cielito Lindo and La Paloma), and especially Texan and Mexican songs, even in Saint Bernard Parish. The Isleños of Saint Bernard Parish have narrative songs in their repertoire that, according to the student of Isleño culture Samuel G. Armistead, were not described and recognized as a specific subtype of Hispanic ballad until their discovery in this Isleño community.|$|E

25|$|The Antaifasy {{remained}} {{resistant to}} Merina domination and were never fully subjugated. In {{an effort to}} weaken them, the Merina provided support to the Zafisoro, <b>a</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> the Antaifasy had previously ruled. Despite French colonization in 1896 {{and the collapse of}} the Merina monarchy in 1897, animosity between the two groups has remained and occasionally flared up into violent conflict, as occurred in 1922, 1936 and 1990, resulting in dozens of deaths. During the Malagasy Uprising of 1947, the Malagasy leaders of the resistance movement against French rule (some of whom were aligned with Merina interests) took advantage of the unstable political context to act on old grudges by instigating the Zafisoro to attack the Antaifasy. Since 1990, this has manifested in competition for control of disputed territory, the most significant being in Vangaindrano prefecture.|$|E
25|$|Chad was consecrated {{bishop of}} the Mercians (literally, {{frontier}} people) and of the Lindsey people (Lindisfaras). Bede tells us that Chad was actually the third bishop sent to Wulfhere, making him the fifth {{bishop of the}} Mercians. The Kingdom of Lindsey, covering the north-eastern area of modern Lincolnshire, was under Mercian control, although {{it had in the}} past sometimes fallen under Northumbrian control. Later Anglo-Saxon episcopal lists sometimes add the Middle Angles to his responsibilities. They were a distinct part of the Mercian kingdom, centred on the middle Trent and lower Tame– the area around Tamworth, Lichfield and Repton that formed the core of the wider Mercian polity. It was their sub-king, Peada, who had secured the services of Chad's brother Cedd in 653, and they were frequently considered separately from the Mercians proper, <b>a</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> lived further to the west and north.|$|E
25|$|The {{marriage}} {{resulted in}} nine children. The first born was a son Mihdí Effendi who died aged about 3. He {{was followed by}} Ḍiyá'iyyih Khánum, Fu’ádíyyih Khánum (d. few years old), Rúhangíz Khánum (d. 1893), Túbá Khánum, Husayn Effendi (d.1887 aged 5), Túbá Khánum, Rúhá Khánum and Munnavar Khánum. The death of his children caused `Abdu’l-Bahá immense grief – in particular {{the death of his}} son Husayn Effendi came at a difficult time following the death of his mother and uncle. The surviving children (all daughters) were; Ḍiyá'iyyih Khánum (mother of Shoghi Effendi) (d. 1951) Túbá Khánum (1880–1959) Rúḥá Khánum and Munavvar Khánum (d. 1971). Bahá'u'lláh wished that the Bahá'ís follow the example of `Abdu'l-Bahá and gradually move away from polygamy. The marriage of `Abdu’l-Bahá to one woman and his choice to remain monogamous, from advice of his father and his own wish, legitimised the practice of monogamy to <b>a</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> hitherto had regarded polygamy as a righteous way of life.|$|E
