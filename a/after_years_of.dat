40|$|ABSTRACT: Successive {{applications}} of pig slurry and poultry manure {{can improve the}} soil structure, according to the land use conditions and amounts applied. This study evaluated the effect of manure fertilization on the physical properties and organic carbon of a Rhodic Kandiudox. Treatments included land use and management and time of pig slurry and poultry litter application, namely: native forest (NF); yerba mate <b>after</b> 20 <b>years</b> <b>of</b> animal waste application (YM 20); pasture <b>after</b> 15 <b>years</b> <b>of</b> application (P 15); grassland <b>after</b> 20 <b>years</b> <b>of</b> manuring (PP 20); grassland <b>after</b> 3 <b>years</b> <b>of</b> manuring (P 3); pasture without application (P 0), maize <b>after</b> 20 <b>years</b> <b>of</b> application (M 20); and maize <b>after</b> 7 <b>years</b> <b>of</b> application (M 7). Soil samples were collected in the 0 - 5, 5 - 10 and 10 - 20 cm layers, in which density, porosity, aggregate stability, flocculation, penetration resistance, available water, and total clay content, total and particulate organic carbon, and C:N ratio were analyzed. The total organic carbon is sensitive to management and {{was not related to}} waste application, except in the 10 - 20 cm layer of ryegrass pasture <b>after</b> three <b>years</b> <b>of</b> manuring.
