5|$|In January 2009 the Chancellor {{announced}} an <b>Asset</b> <b>Purchase</b> Facility (APF), {{to be administered}} by the MPC, aimed at ensuring greater liquidity in financial markets. The committee had already started to cut rates the previous autumn, but the effect of such changes {{can take up to}} two years and rates cannot go below zero. By March 2009, faced with very low levels on inflation and interest rates already at 0.5%, the MPC voted to start the process of quantitative easing (QE) – the injection of money directly into the economy – via the APF. It had the Bank buy government bonds (gilts), along with a smaller amount of high-quality debt issued by private companies. Although non-gilts initially made up a non-negligible part of the APF portfolio, as of May 2015 the entirety of the APF was held as gilts. On 7 August 2013, Governor Mark Carney issued the committee's first forward guidance as a third tool for controlling future inflation.|$|E

40|$|We use MPC voting {{records to}} predict {{changes in the}} volume of <b>asset</b> <b>purchases.</b> We find, first, that {{minority}} voting favoring {{an increase in the}} volume of <b>asset</b> <b>purchases</b> raises the probability of an actual increase at the next meeting.

40|$|The MPC sets {{monetary}} {{policy for the}} economy as a whole in order to achieve the Government’s inflation target. Changes in interest rates and <b>asset</b> <b>purchases</b> financed by issuing reserves (QE) unavoidably have distributional implications. Without the Bank’s <b>asset</b> <b>purchases,</b> most people in the United Kingdom would have been worse off. Economic growth would have been lower. Unemployment would have been higher. Many more companies would have gone out of business. This would have had a significant detrimental impact on savers and pensioners along with every other group in our society. All assessments of the effect of <b>asset</b> <b>purchases</b> must be seen in that light. The Bank’s <b>asset</b> <b>purchases</b> have been almost entirely of gilts, causing the price of gilts to rise and yields to fall. But this in turn has led to an increase in demand for other assets, including corporate bonds and equities. As a result, the Bank’s <b>asset</b> <b>purchases</b> have increased the prices of a wide range of assets, not just gilts. In fact, the Bank’s assessment is that <b>asset</b> <b>purchases</b> have pushed up the price of equities by at least as much as they have pushed up the price of gilts. The implications of QE for savers Changes in Bank Rate – not <b>asset</b> <b>purchases</b> – have been the dominant influence on the interes...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{extends the}} {{canonical}} New Keynesian model to incorporate imperfect substitutability between short-term and long-term bonds. This stylised modification provides a channel through which <b>asset</b> <b>purchases</b> by the policymaker can affect aggregate demand. Because assets are imperfect substitutes, central bank <b>asset</b> <b>purchases</b> that alter the relative supplies of assets influence asset prices. In the model, aggregate demand {{depends on the}} prices (or interest rates) of both long-term and short-term bonds. To the extent that central bank <b>asset</b> <b>purchases</b> reduce long-term interest rates (over and above the effect of expected future short rates), aggregate demand can be stimulated, leading to higher inflation through a conventional New Keynesian Phillips curve. An optimal commitment policy in which the policymaker uses <b>asset</b> <b>purchases</b> as an additional policy instrument can improve economic outcomes {{in the face of}} a negative demand shock that drives the short-term policy rate to its lower bound. This is true even if <b>asset</b> <b>purchases</b> policies are also subject to (both upper and lower) bounds. However, the imperfect substitutability between bonds that gives <b>asset</b> <b>purchases</b> their traction also makes it more difficult for conventional monetary policy to stabilise the economy in the event of a large negative demand shock. If <b>asset</b> <b>purchases</b> are also subject to bounds, then it may not be possible for the policymaker to stabilise the output gap and inflation as well as is possible using only interest rate policy in the canonical New Keynesian model...|$|R
25|$|On April 4, 2013, the Bank of Japan {{announced}} that they would expand their <b>Asset</b> <b>Purchase</b> Program by $1.4 trillion in two years. The Bank of Japan hopes to bring Japan from deflation to inflation, aiming for 2% inflation. The amount of purchases is so large that {{it is expected to}} double the money supply. But this move has sparked concerns that the authorities in Japan are deliberately devaluing the yen in order to boost exports. However, the commercial sector in Japan worried that the devaluation would trigger an increase in import prices, especially for energy and raw materials.|$|E
25|$|SCO {{filed an}} amended complaint. In late July, 2005, Novell filed {{an answer to}} SCO's complaint, denying all of its accusations. Novell also filed its own Slander of Title counter-lawsuit against SCO. Novell has also filed claims for {{numerous}} breaches of the APA (<b>Asset</b> <b>Purchase</b> Agreement) between Novell and the Santa Cruz Operation. Under the APA, Santa Cruz (and later SCO after SCO purchased Santa Cruz Operation's Unix Business) was given the right to market and sell Unixware as a product, retaining 100% of all revenues. Santa Cruz Operation (and later SCO) also was given the responsibility of administering Unix SVR4 license agreements on behalf of Novell. When money was paid for licensing, SCO was to turn over 100% of the revenue to Novell, and then Novell would return 5% as an Administration Fee. Novell claims that SCO signed Unix SVR4 licensing agreements with Microsoft and Sun Microsystems, {{as well as with}} numerous Linux End Users for Unix IP allegedly in the Linux Kernel, and then refused to turn the money over to Novell. Novell is suing for 100% of the revenue, claiming SCO is not entitled to the 5% administration fee since they breached their contract with Novell. Novell's counterclaims proposed asking the court to put appropriate funds from SCO into escrow until the case is resolved, since SCO's cash is diminishing quickly.|$|E

40|$|In {{response}} to the intensification {{of the financial crisis}} in Autumn 2008, the Bank of England, in common with other central banks, loosened monetary policy using both conventional and unconventional policy measures. In the United Kingdom, the principal element of these unconventional measures was the policy of <b>asset</b> <b>purchases</b> financed by central bank money, so-called quantitative easing (QE). Over the period March 2009 to January 2010, £ 200 billion of <b>assets</b> were <b>purchased,</b> overwhelmingly made up of government securities, representing around 14 % of annual GDP. This article reviews the motivation for these central bank <b>asset</b> <b>purchases</b> and describes how they were implemented. It goes on to review a range of evidence for the impact of the <b>asset</b> <b>purchases</b> made to date, both on financial markets and more widely on the economy. While there is considerable uncertainty about the magnitudes, the evidence suggests that QE <b>asset</b> <b>purchases</b> have had economically significant effects. ...|$|R

2500|$|In {{response}} to these challenges from Novell, SCO filed a [...] "slander of title" [...] suit against Novell, SCO v. Novell.

The {{suspension}} of {{operations of the}} college led to a collaboration between the university and certain college alumni to explore a means to separate the college from the university in a manner which preserved the viability of both.
