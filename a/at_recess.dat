He rides the bus to school with his little sister May Belle (Bailee Madison), where he avoids the school bully Janice Avery (Lauren Clinton). In class, Jess is teased by classmates Scott Hoager (Cameron Wakefield) and Gary Fulcher (Elliot Lawless), and meets new student Leslie Burke (AnnaSophia Robb). <b>At</b> <b>recess,</b> Jess enters a running event, {{for which he had}} been training at home. Leslie also enters and manages to beat all the boys, much to Jess' irritation. On the way home, Jess and Leslie learn that they are next-door neighbors.|$|E
2500|$|Rhett and Link met in 1984 on September 4th (this is {{the exact}} date they started school in Harnett County) at Buies Creek Elementary School in Buies Creek, North Carolina, where they {{attended}} first grade, a meeting about which they have subsequently written a song and made a movie (Looking For Ms. Locklear - 2008). [...] They met through having to stay in <b>at</b> <b>recess,</b> as they were both doodling on their desks. In an interview on The Tonight Show, they state that they stayed in during recess because {{both of them had}} written swear words on their desks. They stayed in and colored in mythical creatures such as a unicorn (hence their YouTube channel name, GMM/Good Mythical Morning) In their freshman year of high school at Harnett Central High School in Angier, North Carolina, both Rhett and Link signed a blood oath {{on a piece of paper}} which said, [...] "We will do something together some day". Link kept it through his adulthood in a wallet. Unfortunately, the wallet was lost, along with the original copy of the paper.|$|E

60|$|Her {{legs were}} so tired {{with the long}} skips that {{she was glad to}} sit still; and that pleased the teacher, for {{generally}} she was fussing about all lesson time.

60|$|It was a {{month before}} their secret was fully disclosed. It was slowly evolved from corroborating circumstances, but always with a shy {{reluctance}} from the boys themselves, and a surprise that any one should think it of importance. It was gathered partly from details picked up <b>at</b> <b>recess</b> or on the playground, from the voluntary testimony of teamsters and packers, from a record in the county newspaper, but always shaping itself into a consecutive and harmonious narrative.|$|E
60|$|Snatching my cap {{from beneath}} the desk where I had {{concealed}} it <b>at</b> <b>recess,</b> I hurried out and away over the sand-lot on the shortest way home.

The hot sand burned my feet, my side ached, my mouth was dry, and yet I ran {{on and on and}} on, looking back from moment to moment, seeing pursuers in every moving object.|$|E

The children must have remained loyal to some command of hers, for the incident and this custom were never told out of school, and the master did not consider it his duty to inform Mr. or Mrs. Hoover. If the child could recognize some check--even if it were deemed by some a superstitious one--over her capricious and precocious nature, why should he interfere? ...|$|E

6000|$|Outside {{the house}} the two boys were {{together}} all through their boyhood. Chambers was strong beyond his years, and a good fighter; strong because he was coarsely fed and hard worked about the house, and a good fighter because Tom furnished him plenty of practice--on white boys whom he hated and was afraid of. Chambers was his constant bodyguard, to and from school; he was present on the playground <b>at</b> <b>recess</b> to protect his charge. He fought himself into such a formidable reputation, by and by, that Tom could have changed clothes with him, and [...] "ridden in peace," [...] like Sir Kay in Launcelot's armor.|$|E

If she's mad with her, she eats one before her face, and doesn't offer even a suck.

6000|$|Anne {{went upstairs}} with Dora and sat by {{her until she}} fell asleep. The next day Mirabel Cotton was kept in <b>at</b> <b>recess</b> and [...] "gently but firmly" [...] given to {{understand}} {{that when you were}} so unfortunate as to possess an uncle who persisted in walking about houses after he had been decently interred it was not in good taste to talk about that eccentric gentleman to your deskmate of tender years. Mirabel thought this very harsh. The Cottons had not much to boast of. How was she to keep up her prestige among her schoolmates if she were forbidden to make capital out of the family ghost? ...|$|E

40|$|A novel {{recessed}} electrode {{is reported}} for amperometric detection of hydrogen peroxide and via glucose oxidase {{for the detection}} of glucose. The electrode utilised electrodeposited platinum over a gold wire surface, which proved to be an effective peroxide-detecting surface. Compared with a traditional exposed electrode surface, the recessed tip facilitated an extended linear range for glucose from 4 to over 14 mM. Bio-fouling, as assessed by exposure to bovine serum albumin, was also significantly reduced. Though response time <b>at</b> the <b>recess</b> was increased, it was within an acceptable range for physiological monitoring. Moreover, the recess enabled precise measurement of the hydrogen peroxide diffusion coefficient; this was based on a bipartite expression for the transient amperometric current <b>at</b> the <b>recessed</b> structure following a step change in ambient hydrogen peroxide concentration. An important aspect of the diffusion measurement was the curve fitting routine used to map on to the theoretical response curve...|$|R
