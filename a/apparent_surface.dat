Results from isothermal physisorption of N 2 (BET), X-ray Diffraction (XRD), Temperature Programmed Reduction (TPR), N 2 O Reactive Frontal Chromatography (N 2 O-RFC), X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS) and Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) have been correlated with the catalytic activity for the reverse water-gas shift (rWGS) reaction {{in order to provide}} insight into the controversial nature of active species in carbon dioxide activation, respectively the role of Cu and ZnO. Average crystalline domain size of CuO and ZnO show a relationship with the amount of each phase in the calcined sample. This is in agreement with the TPR profiles, which indicate a better dispersion of Cu for the ZnO-rich samples and a shift for the first reduction step to higher temperatures (T onset for Cu II to Cu I). XPS measurements point out the surface enrichment of ZnO is less pronounced with higher ZnO/(ZnO + Cu) ratios. Activity results show that catalysts derived from high surface area ex-aurichalcite (Zn content, 50 – 70 % atom) catalysts are more active in rWGS with lower apparent activation energies than ex-ZM catalysts (Zn content, 15 – 30 % atom) with comparable <b>apparent</b> Cu <b>surface</b> area/N 2 O capacity.
