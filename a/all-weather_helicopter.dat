25|$|The SA 330 Puma was {{originally}} developed by Sud Aviation {{to meet a}} requirement of the French Army for a medium-sized <b>all-weather</b> <b>helicopter</b> capable of carrying up to 20 soldiers as well as various cargo-carrying duties. The choice was made to develop a completely new design for the helicopter, work began in 1963 with backing from the French government. The first of two Puma prototypes flew on 15 April 1965; six further pre-production models were also built, the last of which flew on 30 July 1968. The first production SA 330 Puma flew in September 1968, with deliveries to the French Army starting in early 1969.|$|E
40|$|NASA {{is again}} {{actively}} involved in aircraft icing research. This paper briefly describes the new research activity in ice protection systems, icing instrumentation, experimental methods, analytical modeling for the above, and in-flight research. The renewed interest in aircraft icing has come about {{mainly because of the}} new need for <b>all-weather</b> <b>helicopters</b> and general aviation aircraft. Because of increased fuel costs, tomorrow's commercial transports also will require new types of ice protection systems compatible with the more efficient high by-pass and turboprop engines. And all types of aircraft require better estimates of the aeropenalties caused by ice on unprotected surfaces...|$|R
40|$|Research {{activity}} is described for: ice protection systems, icing instrumentation, experimental methods, analytical modeling for the above, and in flight research. The {{renewed interest in}} aircraft icing has come about {{because of the new}} need for <b>All-Weather</b> <b>Helicopters</b> and General Aviation aircraft. Because of increased fuel costs, tomorrow's Commercial Transport aircraft will also require new types of ice protection systems and better estimates of the aeropenalties caused by ice on unprotected surfaces. The physics of aircraft icing is very similar to the icing that occurs on ground structures and structures at sea; all involve droplets that freeze on the surfaces because of the cold air. Therefore all icing research groups will benefit greatly by sharing their research information...|$|R
50|$|The TAI/AgustaWestland T129 is a twin-engine, tandem seat, multi-role, <b>all-weather</b> attack <b>helicopter</b> {{based on}} the Agusta A129 Mangusta platform. The T129 was {{developed}} by Turkish Aerospace Industries (TAI), with partner AgustaWestland. The helicopter is designed for advanced attack and reconnaissance in hot and high environments and rough geography in both day and night conditions.|$|R
50|$|In 1956, the U.S. Navy {{launched}} a competition {{to meet its}} requirement for a compact, <b>all-weather</b> multipurpose naval <b>helicopter.</b> Kaman's K-20 model {{was selected as the}} winner. Kaman was awarded a contract for four prototype and 12 production HU2K-1 helicopters in late 1957. Kaman's design was for a conventional helicopter powered by a single General Electric T58-8F turboshaft engine, driving a 44-foot four-bladed main rotor and a four-bladed tail rotor.|$|R
50|$|In 1957, Sikorsky {{was awarded}} a {{contract}} to produce an <b>all-weather</b> amphibious <b>helicopter</b> for the U.S. Navy. As per the earlier specification, this new helicopter was to excel at ASW; in particular, it would combine the roles of hunter and killer, as these duties had previously been carried out by two separate helicopters. It {{was also the first}} helicopter to be procured under the US Navy's new weapon system concept, under which Sikorsky was responsible not only for the design and production of the airframe itself but all of the major onboard systems, such as the sonar, navigational equipment, electronic devices, and support equipment. As such, the navigation suite for the rotorcraft was developed jointly by Sikorsky and the US Navy.|$|R
50|$|By 1960, the {{squadron}} had transitioned into the autopilot equipped HSS-1N {{version of the}} Seabat giving it the ability to operate at night and in marginal weather. In addition to being the first HS squadron on the West Coast, by 1962 HS-2 was the first ASW helicopter squadron to make a deployment with the Navy's first turbine powered <b>all-weather</b> ASW <b>helicopter,</b> the HSS-2 Sea King which in September 1962 {{in compliance with the}} 1962 United States Tri-Service aircraft designation system was re-designated the SH-3A Sea King. HS-2 was also the first H-3 squadron to operationally employ Helicopter In-flight Refueling (HIFR) at night. In November 1965, an HS-2 SH-3A performed the longest operational flight at the time. The aircraft remained airborne for eleven hours and eighteen minutes on a search and rescue mission in North Vietnam with the help of four HIFRs three of which were at night. This flight was also the first night rescue in North Vietnam.|$|R
