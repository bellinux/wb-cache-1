5|$|Allan Paul Bakke (born 1940), a 35-year-old white male, {{applied to}} twelve medical schools in 1973. He {{had been a}} National Merit Scholar at Coral Gables Senior High School, in Florida. He was {{accepted}} as an undergraduate at the University of Minnesota, deferring tuition costs by joining Naval ROTC. He graduated with a grade-point average (GPA) of 3.51. In order to fulfill his ROTC requirements, he joined the Marine Corps and served four years, including a seven-month {{tour of duty in}} Vietnam as a commanding officer of an anti-aircraft battery. In 1967, having achieved the rank of captain, he was granted an honorable discharge. Bakke then worked as an engineer at NASA. He stated that his interest in medicine started in Vietnam, and increased at NASA, as he had to consider the problems of space flight and the human body there.

The Convention was reconvened on February 12, 1863, and the demand was met. The revised constitution was adopted on March 26, 1863, and on April 20, 1863, President Lincoln issued a proclamation admitting the state at the end of 60 days on June 20, 1863. Meanwhile, officers for the new state were chosen, and Governor Pierpont moved his capital to Alexandria from which he asserted jurisdiction over the counties of Virginia within the Federal lines.|$|E
25|$|As {{had been}} feared, the President of France, Charles de Gaulle, vetoed Britain's <b>application</b> <b>for</b> <b>admission</b> to the EEC on 14 January 1963, citing the Nassau Agreement {{as one of}} the main reasons. He argued that Britain's {{dependence}} on United States through the purchase of Polaris rendered it unfit {{to be a member of}} the EEC. The US policy of attempting to force Britain into their Multilateral Force proved to be a failure in light of this decision, and there was a lack of enthusiasm for it from the NATO allies, particularly Britain. By 1965, the Multilateral Force began fading away. The NATO Nuclear Planning Group gave NATO members a voice in the planning process without full access to nuclear weapons. The Standing Naval Force Atlantic was established as a joint naval task force, but which various nations contributing ships rather than ships having mixed crews.|$|E

500|$|Generally, {{admission}} into {{a graduate}} degree program at Harvard Extension School requires a minimum of an accredited bachelor's degree (or foreign equivalent), as well as completion of three pre-admission courses with grades of B or higher and a minimum of 3.0 overall GPA.

2500|$|By 2011 several councils had {{realized}} {{that they did not}} have to permit BASW access, and those that were challenged by skilled professional representation of their staff were withdrawing permission. For this reason BASW once again took up trade union status by forming its arms length trade union section, SWU (Social Workers Union).

[...] At 2015 the TUC was still resisting SWU <b>application</b> <b>for</b> <b>admission</b> to congress membership and while most employers are not making formal statements of recognition until such a time as the TUC may change its policy, they are all legally required to permit SWU (BASW) representation at internal discipline hearings etc.|$|E
2500|$|On May 13, 1862 {{the state}} {{legislature}} of the reorganized government approved {{the formation of the}} new state.

Carlile sought to sabotage the bill, first trying to expand the new state's boundaries to include the Shenandoah Valley, and then to defeat the Willey amendment at home. On December 31, 1862, an enabling act was approved by President Abraham Lincoln admitting West Virginia, on the condition that a provision for the gradual abolition of slavery be inserted in its constitution (as Rev. Battelle had urged in the Wheeling Intelligencer and also written to Lincoln). While many felt that West Virginia's admission as a state was both illegal and unconstitutional, Lincoln issued his Opinion on the Admission of West Virginia finding that [...] "the body which consents to the admission of West Virginia is the Legislature of Virginia", and that its admission was therefore both constitutional and expedient.|$|E

2500|$|The Football League {{decided to}} expand its {{membership}} for the 1892–93 season by forming a Second Division. Although Small Heath's <b>application</b> <b>for</b> <b>admission</b> to the enlarged First Division failed, they were one of eight Football Alliance teams accepted into the Second. The directors appointed Alfred Jones as the club's first paid secretary, and William Starling {{was elected to the}} Football League Management Committee as one of two representatives of the Second Division. During the season, the team scored 90 goals at an average of 4 goals per game, beat Walsall Town Swifts 12–0 to set a club record League victory which, , still stands, remained undefeated on their own ground, and won the last nine matches of the season to take the inaugural Second Division title. Goalkeeper Chris Charsley, a policeman who played as an amateur and went on to serve as chief constable of Coventry, became the first Small Heath player to be capped by England. Promotion to the First Division was not automatic, even for the champions, but depended on the results of test matches between the top three Second Division and bottom three First Division teams. Small Heath lost to 16th-placed First Division team Newton Heath (the future Manchester United) after a replay, so were not promoted, although the teams placed second and third were. Their success at the second attempt, as 1893–94 runners-up and victors over Darwen in the test match, was met with relief as well as celebration. The club had been in serious financial difficulty during the season, during which it added a loss of £222 to an existing deficit of some £350; the Birmingham Daily Post believed that [...] "defeat would in all probability have meant the disbanding of the club", ambitions of promotion having sustained the committee's efforts throughout the season to raise enough funds to keep going.|$|E
