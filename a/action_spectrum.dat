25|$|The first {{measurements}} of photoinhibition {{were published in}} 1956 by Bessel Kok. Even {{in the very first}} studies, it was obvious that plants have a repair mechanism that continuously repairs photoinhibitory damage. In 1966, Jones and Kok measured the <b>action</b> <b>spectrum</b> of photoinhibition and found that ultraviolet light is highly photoinhibitory. The visible-light part of the <b>action</b> <b>spectrum</b> was found to have a peak in the red-light region, suggesting that chlorophylls act as photoreceptors of photoinhibition. In the 1980s, photoinhibition became a popular topic in photosynthesis research, and the concept of a damaging reaction counteracted by a repair process was re-invented. Research was stimulated by a paper by Kyle, Ohad and Arntzen in 1984, showing that photoinhibition is accompanied by selective loss of a 32-kDa protein, later identified as the PSII reaction center protein D1. The photosensitivity of PSII from which the oxygen evolving complex had been inactivated with chemical treatment was studied in the 1980s and early 1990s. A paper by Imre Vass and coworkers in 1992 described the acceptor-side mechanism of photoinhibition. species promote chlorophyll triplet formation|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the USA|volume=89| year=1992|pages=14081412 |doi = 10.1073/pnas.89.4.1408|issue = 4}} Measurements of production of singlet oxygen by photoinhibited PSII provided further evidence for an acceptor-side-type mechanism. The concept of a repair cycle that continuously repairs photoinhibitory damage, evolved and was reviewed by Aro et al. in 1993. Many details of the repair cycle, including the finding that the FtsH protease {{plays an important role in}} the degradation of the D1 protein, have been discovered since. In 1996, a paper by Tyystjärvi and Aro showed that the rate constant of photoinhibition is directly proportional to light intensity, a result that opposed the former assumption that photoinhibition is caused by the fraction of light energy that exceeds the maximum capability of photosynthesis. The following year, laser pulse photoinhibition experiments done by Itzhak Ohad's group led to the suggestion that charge recombination reactions may be damaging because they can lead to production of singlet oxygen. The molecular mechanism(s) of photoinhibition are constantly under discussion. The newest candidate is the manganese mechanism suggested 2005 by the group of Esa Tyystjärvi. A similar mechanism was suggested by the group of Norio Murata, also in 2005.|$|E

25|$|The UV Index is {{a number}} linearly related to the {{intensity}} of sunburn-producing UV radiation at a given point on the earth's surface. It cannot be simply related to the irradiance (measured in W/m2) because the UV of greatest concern occupies a spectrum of wavelength from 295 to 325nm, and shorter wavelengths have already been absorbed a great deal when they arrive at the earth's surface. Skin damage from sunburn, however, is related to wavelength, the shorter wavelengths being much more damaging. The UV power spectrum (expressed as Watts per square metre per nanometre of wavelength) is therefore multiplied by a weighting curve known as the erythemal <b>action</b> <b>spectrum,</b> and the result integrated over the whole spectrum. This gave Canadian scientists a weighted figure (sometimes called Diffey-weighted UV irradiance, or DUV, or erythemal dose rate) typically around 250mW/m2 in midday summer sunlight. So, they arbitrarily divided by 25mW/m2 to generate a convenient index value, essentially a scale of 0 to 11+ (though ozone depletion is now resulting in higher values, as mentioned above).|$|E

40|$|Summary. Analysis of {{the results}} {{obtained}} during {{the investigation of the}} photosynthetic oxygen evolution upon irradiation with short saturating flashes and of the widely accepted Kok’s model for the reactions leading to the oxygen production showed that the photosynthetic irradiance should be non-linear (quadratic or higher degree of dependence) under low irradiance. This non-linearity of the irradiance curves leads to several consequences on the <b>action</b> <b>spectra</b> of photosynthesis and particularly on the decrease of the quantum efficiency in the spectrum regions where pigment absorption is lower, as we demonstrated in our earlier investigations (Zeinalov, 1982; Maslenkova et al., 1994). An attempt for estimating the <b>action</b> <b>spectra</b> and spectral dependence of the quantum efficiency of photosynthesis in Scenedesmus acutus is presented using a polarographic oxygen rate electrode and irradiation with two light beams, one of them being continuous and the other one modulated.
