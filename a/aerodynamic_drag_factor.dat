30|$|With the {{increase}} in the train speed, the interaction between the train and the air becomes more severe, and it leads to a series of aerodynamic problems, such as <b>aerodynamic</b> <b>drag</b> force, lift force, aerodynamic noise [1]. The <b>aerodynamic</b> <b>drag</b> force is proportional to the square of the train speed. When the train speed reaches 200 – 300  km/h, the <b>aerodynamic</b> <b>drag</b> accounts for 70 % to 85 % of the total drag of the train [1, 2]. The <b>aerodynamic</b> <b>drag</b> of pantographs accounts for 8 % to 14 % of the total <b>aerodynamic</b> <b>drag,</b> and the <b>aerodynamic</b> lift of pantographs is proportional to the square of the train speed [3]. Thus, {{the increase}} in the train speed would lead to a stronger interaction of pantograph–catenary [4, 5].|$|R

One was to {{eliminate}} any extra <b>aerodynamic</b> <b>drag</b> that a protruding oil cooler would produce, in this case eliminating the extra <b>drag</b> <b>factor</b> by enclosing it within the engine's forward cowling. The second was to warm the air before it flowed to the oil cooler's circular-shaped core to aid warming the oil during starting. Finally, by placing the oil cooler behind the fan, cooling was provided even while the aircraft was parked. The downside to this design was that the oil cooler was in an extremely vulnerable location, and the metal ring was increasingly armoured as the war progressed.|$|R

40|$|PURPOSE: <b>Aerodynamic</b> <b>drag</b> {{plays an}} {{important}} role in performance for athletes practicing sports that involve high-velocity motions. In giant slalom, the skier is continuously changing his/her body posture, and this affects the energy dissipated in <b>aerodynamic</b> <b>drag.</b> It is therefore important to quantify this energy to understand the dynamic behavior of the skier. The aims of this study were to model the <b>aerodynamic</b> <b>drag</b> of alpine skiers in giant slalom simulated conditions and to apply these models in a field experiment to estimate energy dissipated through <b>aerodynamic</b> <b>drag.</b> METHODS: The <b>aerodynamic</b> characteristics of 15 recreational male and female skiers were measured in a wind tunnel while holding nine different skiing-specific postures. The drag and the frontal area were recorded simultaneously for each posture. Four generalized and two individualized models of the drag coefficient were built, using different sets of parameters. These models were subsequently applied in a field study designed to compare the aerodynamic energy losses between a dynamic and a compact skiing technique. RESULTS: The generalized models estimated <b>aerodynamic</b> <b>drag</b> with an accuracy of between 11. 00 % and 14. 28 %, and the individualized models estimated <b>aerodynamic</b> <b>drag</b> with an accuracy between 4. 52 % and 5. 30 %. The individualized model used for the field study showed that using a dynamic technique led to 10 % more <b>aerodynamic</b> <b>drag</b> energy loss than using a compact technique. DISCUSSION: The individualized models were capable of discriminating different techniques performed by advanced skiers and seemed more accurate than the generalized models. The models presented here offer a simple yet accurate method to estimate the <b>aerodynamic</b> <b>drag</b> acting upon alpine skiers while rapidly moving through the range of positions typical to turning technique...|$|R

Due {{to the fact that}} literature on this specific subject is non-existent, a theoretical framework on hydrodynamic and <b>aerodynamic</b> <b>drag</b> of the sailing boat and sailor had to be set-up to provide us with ball park figures on the effect of changes in sailing apparel.

Next, the actual <b>aerodynamic</b> <b>drag</b> of eight different combinations of state-of-the art sailing apparel was measured in the wind-tunnel (TUDelft Open Jet Facility) at various wind angles and wind speeds (up to 17 ms- 1). The experimental results were then compared to the results of the theoretical framework. The results of the experiment show a maximum difference of 11 % in <b>aerodynamic</b> <b>drag</b> between the best and worst case scenario (at 8. 2 ms- 1 wind speed).

30|$|The {{speed of}} {{traditional}} trains is limited {{because of the}} dynamic friction between {{the wheels of the}} train and the fixed rail on the ground. When the trains are running at a low speed, most of the energy is consumed by friction. The trains can be levitated above the rail to avoid such friction with the technology of magnetic levitation [1]. There are three types of levitation technologies: electromagnetic suspension (EMS), electrodynamic suspension (EDS), hybrid electromagnetic suspension (HEMS) [2]. Even with these three methods, the velocity of trains could not be improved remarkably because of the <b>aerodynamic</b> <b>drag.</b> When the trains run at low speeds, this drag is not evident. At high speeds, however, the <b>aerodynamic</b> <b>drag</b> is too large to be neglected. Whatever the trains are levitated or not, the <b>aerodynamic</b> <b>drag</b> is the dominate part of drag when it runs at a high speed in the atmosphere near the earth’s surface. At a speed range between 400 and 500  km/h, the <b>aerodynamic</b> <b>drag</b> accounts for 80  %– 90  % of the total <b>drag</b> including the <b>aerodynamic</b> <b>drag,</b> the eddy resistance force, and the braking force [3]. The train speed is much lower than the airplane speed because airplanes flight in a circumstance of rarefied gas in the high altitude. In view of this fact, the evacuated tube transportation (ETT) was proposed to reduce the <b>aerodynamic</b> <b>drag</b> and improve the speed of the maglev train.
