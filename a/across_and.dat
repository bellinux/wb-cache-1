They may be further classified as ice-pick scars, boxcar scars, and rolling scars. Ice-pick scars are narrow (less than 2mm across), deep scars that extend into the dermis. Boxcar scars are round or ovoid indented scars with sharp borders and vary in size from 1.5–4mm across. Rolling scars are wider than icepick and boxcar scars (4–5mm <b>across)</b> <b>and</b> have a wave-like pattern of depth in the skin.|$|E

They are funnelform (funnel shaped) and declinate (curving {{downwards}} and then upwards at the tip) in shape. The perianth has six brightly colored tepals (three outer sepals and three inner petals) that may be similar in appearance or very different. The perianth segments are subequal or unequal. The tepals are united at the base to form a short tube, usually with a rudimentary scaly paraperigonium with fimbriae or a callose ridge present at the throat.|$|E

5|$|François Coli, age 45, a World War I {{veteran and}} {{recipient}} of the French Legion of Honor, had been making record-breaking flights <b>across</b> <b>and</b> around the Mediterranean Sea, and had been planning a transatlantic flight since 1923. His original plans were to fly with his wartime comrade Paul Tarascon, a flying ace with 12 victories from the war. They {{became interested in the}} Orteig Prize in 1925, but in late 1926 an accident destroyed their Potez 25 biplane. Tarascon was badly burned, and relinquished his place as pilot to 35-year-old Charles Nungesser, a highly experienced flying ace with over 40 victories, third highest among the French.|$|E
5|$|In 1997 a {{paper was}} {{published}} that hypothesised {{the existence of}} a binary nucleus to fully explain the observed pattern of comet Hale–Bopp's dust emission observed in October 1995. The paper was based on theoretical analysis, and did not claim an observational detection of the proposed satellite nucleus, but estimated that it would have a diameter of about 30km, with the main nucleus being about 70km <b>across,</b> <b>and</b> would orbit in about three days at a distance of about 180km. This analysis was confirmed by observations in 1996 using Wide-Field Planetary Camera 2 of the Hubble Space Telescope which had taken images of the comet that revealed the satellite.|$|E
40|$|Purpose - This paper aims {{to examine}} how metaphors mediate {{organizational}} change <b>across</b> space <b>and</b> time. Design/methodology/approach - The data consist of 113 speeches by vice-chancellors of a distance teaming university, recorded in texts. Texts are apposite for this research as they transmit meaning <b>across</b> time <b>and</b> space. Hermeneutics is an appropriate methodology because it enables interpretation <b>across</b> temporal <b>and</b> spatial distance. Findings - The paper finds that textual metaphors mediate organizational change <b>across</b> space <b>and</b> time in five ways: transferring from familiarity to strangeness, providing coherence, "breaking distance" changing reality through changing language, and recontextualising. Research limitations/implications - The study focuses on formal organizational texts and excludes informal texts and conversation. Change outcomes are not studied; there should be further research on how metaphors affect change over time and space. Practical implications - Metaphors enable managers to communicate change <b>across</b> time <b>and</b> space. Textual metaphors are continuously available and interactive, enabling dialogue between managers <b>and</b> staff <b>across</b> space <b>and</b> time. Originality/value - The paper furthers our knowledge of how metaphors mediate change <b>across</b> both space <b>and</b> time. Metaphors translate the organization across distance, fusing spatial and temporal horizons, effecting organizational change by changing language. The organization becomes a metaphor of itself, recontextualising <b>across</b> time <b>and</b> space...|$|R

The arrival of the 5th Guards Tank Army just days earlier was detrimental to it in two major ways: the tank unit commanders did not have an opportunity to reconnoitre the terrain they would be travelling <b>across,</b> <b>and</b> the supporting artillery was unable to site and spot their fire.|$|E

To {{the north of}} the abandoned village, the Japanese were positioned in strength and they launched a strong counterattack, which retook the vital high ground for them but was checked from progressing further by a heavy Australian artillery bombardment. At this stage, the 2/24th Infantry Battalion was released from its portage task and it was sent west to conduct a flanking movement around the Japanese position, cutting the Kuanko–Wareo track and capturing Kwatingkoo and Peak Hill early on 7 December, following a Japanese withdrawal. From there, it was a short march on to Wareo, which the Australians secured early the next day.|$|E
5|$|On {{flowering}} plants, {{the leaves}} are alternately arranged up the stem. They are thick and decurrent, with much variation in leaf shape between {{the upper and lower}} leaves on the stem, ranging from oblong to oblanceolate, and reaching sizes up to 50cm long and 14cm across (19inches long and 5inches wide). They become smaller higher up the stem, and less strongly decurrent down the stem. The flowering stem is solid and 2–2.5cm (nearly an inch) <b>across,</b> <b>and</b> occasionally branched just below the inflorescence, usually following damage. After flowering and seed release, the stem and fruits usually persist in winter, drying into dark brown, stiff structures of densely packed, ovoid-shaped, and dry seed capsules. The dried stems may persist into the following spring or even the next summer. The plant produces a shallow taproot.|$|E
