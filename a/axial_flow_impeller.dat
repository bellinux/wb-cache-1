The focus of the current work is the effect on hydrodynamics of changing the impeller and reactor configurations in a 75 l stirred vessel with draft tube and baffles. The aim was to determine which configuration resulted in maximum particle suspension and local gas hold-up while using the minimum impeller speed and power consumption.

The impeller configurations tested were a single Rushton turbine, a single <b>axial</b> <b>flow</b> <b>impeller,</b> and a double impeller system consisting of a combination of the two. The reactor configurations, tested at different gas flow rates, were varied to test the effects with and without baffles.

All experiments were based on classic radial and <b>axial</b> <b>flow</b> <b>impellers,</b> i. e., Rushton Turbine (RT) and Pitched Blade Turbine in down pumping mode (PBT-D). Three different liquids (water, water+CMC, and water+PAA) were employed in several concentrations. The CMC solution introduced as a pseudo plastic fluid and PAA solution was applied as a Herschel Bulkley fluid. The rheological properties of these fluids were characterized separately. According to the findings, the critical impeller speeds for solid suspension for non-Newtonian fluids were more eminent than those for water.

Water and glycerol were used as the liquid phases and spherical glass particles were used as the solid phase. Solid concentration was varied from 5 to 45 % v/v. The power measurements {{in this study is}} expressed on the basis of total mass of solids suspended due to the consideration that the rate of dissolution and reaction depend to a large extent on the total surface area or amount of solids once complete suspension is achieved. When defined in this form, specific power input is found to decrease with increase in solids concentration, reach a minimum value and increase thereafter. This result is observed in water as well as in glycerol solutions used in this study. Experimental results show that an increase in viscosity leads to an increase in specific power irrespective of the impeller type and solids concentration used. It also appears that the effect of viscosity was found to be significant for the radial <b>flow</b> <b>impeller.</b> In addition, it was observed that the optimum solids concentration at which the specific power is a minimum is not affected by the viscosity but the specific power at this concentration for a given impeller increases with an increase in viscosity...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: The low lying {{parts of}} Holland are {{vulnerable}} to flooding and are therefore heavily protected by dykes and several pumping stations. These however cause serious obstacles to migratory fish. Pumping stations can be lethal barriers for fish migration. Currently a lot of pump manufacturers are developing new fish friendly pumps. To fit these new pumps in existing pumping stations, usually civil adjustments are required at considerable costs. A more cost effective alternative would be to perform a fish friendly upgrade of the existing pumps. During the last 3 years Flowserve conducted excessive research to increase their knowledge on fish friendly pump design. This research project led to a comprehensive calculation method to predict survivability rates of fish passing pumps. With this knowledge Flowserve has developed a very cost effective retrofit program to upgrade existing pumping stations equiped with fish unfriendly concrete volute pumps that have open <b>axial</b> <b>flow</b> screw <b>impellers,</b> also known as BVOP pumps. Currently Flowserve has executed several retrofit projects proving fish friendly upgrade possibilities at relatively low costs, lowering the investment threshold to solve fish migration barriers.

In this study we used electrical impedance tomography (EIT) to estimate the solids distribution in a lab-scale stirred vessel with a diameter of 362 mm. Also visual measurements were performed to determine the cloud height and just suspended impeller speed. Quartz sand with a density of 2650 kg/m 3 was employed as the solid phase with different particle size fractions from 50 to 180 µm and solids volume fractions of 7. 5 % and 15 %. The effect of impeller type was studied by using two <b>axial</b> <b>flow</b> <b>impellers,</b> a pitched blade turbine and a hydrofoil impeller. Two different states—partial and homogeneous suspensions—were defined from the EIT data in addition to visual measurement of complete off-bottom suspension and cloud height. Partial suspension was determined from the EIT data, and it was reached at relatively low agitation rates. Visual measurements and data from the literature also support this observation, and EIT was {{proved to be a}} suitable method to quantify a repeatable partial suspension criterion. Complete off-bottom suspension was measured visually by determining the agitation rate at which there were no stationary solid particles at the vessel bottom for longer than 2 s. However, the applicability of this widely used criterion was questioned in the case of dense suspensions of small particles. Homogeneous suspension was estimated from the EIT data, and it was reached by approximately doubling the impeller revolution rate from the partial suspension criterion. The hydrofoil impeller reached all states of suspension with lower power consumption compared to the pitched blade turbine...|$|R
40|$|A novel {{perfectly}} mixed {{laboratory reactor}} for determining kinetics of heterogeneously catalyzed gas-phase reactions has been developed. Perfect mixing {{is achieved by}} circulating the gas in the reactor using an <b>axial</b> <b>flow</b> <b>impeller</b> in a well streamlined enclosure. Pellets are fixed in a rectangular opening in the blades of the impeller. They rotate with the impeller, thus realizing high particle velocities in the reactor. Interparticle mass transfer was studied experimentally by vaporization of naphthalene pellets. The mass-transfer coefficient in the novel reactor was found {{to depend on the}} velocity of a particle in the reactor. Mass-transfer coefficients in an internal recycle reactor at equal impeller tip speeds are 4 - 6 times lower than those in the novel reactor, and conditions can be chosen easily where at higher rotational speeds the mass- and heat-transfer rates are 8 - 10 times higher than in classical recycle reactors.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{an analysis of}} the blending characteristics of axial flow high-speed impellers under a turbulent regime of flow of an agitated low viscosity liquid. The conductivity method is used to determine the time course of blending (homogenisation) of miscible liquids in a pilot plant fully baffled mixing vessel, and a torquemeter is used for measuring the impeller power input in the same system. Four-blade and six-blade pitched blade impellers and three high efficiency axial flow impellers are tested for the given degree of homogeneity (98 %). The experimental results and also the results of the authors ´ previous study, in accordance with the theoretical approach described in the literature, show that there is a universal relationship between the impeller power number and the dimensionless blending time, taking into consideration the impeller-to-vessel diameter ratio, independent of the geometry of the <b>axial</b> <b>flow</b> <b>impeller</b> but dependent on the degree of homogeneity.

40|$|The {{effect of}} the pumping {{direction}} of an <b>axial</b> <b>flow</b> <b>impeller,</b> the feeding rate {{and the number of}} feed inlets on the operation of a continuously-fed stirred tank has been studied using CFD. The flow patterns generated by the up-pumping and down-pumping impeller, under both ‘typical’ and ‘intensified’ operating conditions, are compared. The effect of various tank configurations on the performance of the vessel is assessed by analysing the flow and power numbers, as well as the concentration field of a non-reactive tracer. Furthermore, the inlet feed jets are reduced using traditional jet similarity analysis and are compared with that of a typical round jet. The results show that up-pumping impellers improve circulation in {{the upper part of the}} tank and reduce shortcircuiting of the feed stream with only a small increase in power consumption. Furthermore, by using multiple feed inlets to increase the total throughput capacity, the amplitude of torque fluctuations is decreased and impeller bypassing is also decreased. The ensemble of conclusions suggest that the throughput capacity and mixing quality of a CSTR can be improved, without problems of short-circuiting, by employing up-pumping impellers coupled with multiple surface feed points...|$|E
40|$|The present thesis {{deals with}} the fluid {{dynamics}} of stirred vessels and particularly those {{that are to be}} used in conjunction with solids suspensions. Stirred vessels are very common in the process industry and large amounts of energy can be saved by optimising their operation. Several types of unit operations such as chemical reaction, leaching, dissolution and crystallisation involve solids suspensions. <b>Axial</b> <b>flow</b> <b>impellers</b> are best suited for suspension of solids and therefore, pitched blade turbines were used in the present work. A standard type of stirred vessel with a single impeller and an industrial type of tank with two parallel impellers, were studied. The single-phase flow and the simultaneous flow of particles and liquid were investigated. Measurements were made on the single-phase flow using Laser-Doppler anemometry and on the two-phase flow using Phase-Doppler anemometry. Numerical computations were performed using the commercially available CFD-code CFX 4. The two-phase calculations were done using the multi-fluid approach. Good agreement between the experiments and calculations was obtained for the fluid phase but the particle phase predictions were less satisfactory. The axial component of the slip velocity was generally slightly overestimated and the radial and tangential components severely underestimated by the computational model. The single-phase flow in a completely filled vessel equipped with a lid was investigated in detail and compared with results for a vessel lacking a lid. It was found that the influence of the lid was small and changes in the <b>impeller</b> discharge <b>flow</b> were observed only after lowering the lid to half of the vessel height. The simultaneous measurement of fluid and particle velocities revealed that generally, particles lag when the fluid is moving upwards and vice versa but also, that exceptions to this are common. The largest differences between the velocities of the two phases where found in regions with large mean velocity gradients such as the impeller discharge. For the industrial type of tank, it was found that horizontal displacement of the two impellers in opposite directions could break-up the segregated mixing zones that tended to form in the tank...|$|R
40|$|The {{agitator}} speed {{required to}} suspend solids under gassed conditions, N JSg, {{has been studied}} in water and in corn syrup of 0. 01 and 0. 1 Pas giving Reynolds numbers from the full turbulent region down to ~ 10 3. Of the impellers tested, the downpumping, three-blade, <b>axial</b> <b>flow</b> hydrofoil <b>impellers</b> are generally unsuitable for this duty, and although six-blade, mixed <b>flow</b> down-pumping <b>impellers</b> require the lowest mean specific energy dissipation rates to suspend the solids, (T) JSg, at low gas flow rates, they are still prone to flow instabilities and torque fluctuations. The latter poor characteristics are made worse by reducing {{the size of the}} impeller relative to the vessel and by increasing viscosity and gas flow rate, QGV. Thus, they are of limited use for such systems. The Ekato InterMIG impeller has the highest (T) JSg and tends to cause vessel vibrations when dispersing the gas, and this weakness is also enhanced by increasing viscosity and gas flow rate. Again, they are generally not appropriate for three-phase systems. The radial flow Rushton turbine is quite stable and able to suspend the solids in all the fluids. However, it requires the second highest (T) JSg, and both (T) JSg and NJSg increase substantially with increasing QGV. The up-pumping six-blade, mixed <b>flow</b> <b>impeller</b> of approximately half the vessel diameter is able to suspend the solids and is very stable in all the fluids. In addition, both (T) JSg and NJSg are very insensitive toQGV, with (T) JSg generally being the lowest at the highest QGV. It is thus the preferred agitator among those tested. As in ungassed systems, modifying the base of the vessel can significantly lower (T) JSg and NJSg for a given impeller type in water compared to a flat base. The concept of keeping constant torque as a means of maintaining suspension has been tested and found not to be valid in this work. Another approach to generalizing the results is also suggested.

40|$|Filamentous micro-organisms, {{grown in}} {{submerged}} culture, {{are used in}} {{a large number of}} fermentation processes, such as the production of penicillin and citric acid. Generally, production takes place in baffled sparged vessels agitated by either single or multiple impellers, traditionally Rushton turbines mounted on a common shaft. This configuration is satisfactory for low viscosity systems, e. g. yeast and some bacterial fermentations. However, in cultures of filamentous fungi, as the fermentation time progresses, the broth may become increasingly viscous, and possibly shear thinning, with the consequent onset of dead zones or stagnant regions. The resulting concentration gradients may cause a reduction in the productivity. It may be possible to overcome these problems by using a fermenter which has two independently driven impellers and a cylindrical draft tube (IDDIDT i. e. an acronym for "Independently Driven Dual Impeller with Draft Tube") Studies have been undertaken in a 0. 75 m Perspex proto-fermenter employing a Rushton turbine (6 RT) and a Scaba 3 SHP 1 <b>axial</b> <b>flow</b> <b>impeller,</b> with test fluids such as water and CMC, under unaerated and aerated conditions. In order to fully characterise the system, important mixing aspects such as mass transfer (hold-up, k_La) and bulk blending (mixing times, circulation time distributions) were investigated and related to the power input from each impeller. At low gas rates, moderately increased hold-up and k_La values were observed with the IDDIDT compared to single or dual Rushton turbine systems. At higher gassing rates the performance was similar for all configurations. For the IDDIDT, regardless of the proportion of the total energy dissipation rate contributed by each impeller, the k_La was the same. In addition, very rapid mixing times approximately 3 times faster than predicted by correlations for single impeller, single shaft systems and experimentally determined values for the dual Rushton system, were observed. Mixing times could be directly controlled by the 3 SHP 1 <b>axial</b> <b>flow</b> <b>impeller,</b> and confirmation of the increased exchange flow rate throughout the vessel was achieved via circulation time distribution (CTD) experiments. Since very little data has been published regarding the use of fermentation broths in these systems, hygienic Aspergillus niger fermentations were carried out in the fermenter to clarify any improvements when using the novel reactor and also to highlight any discrepancies in the use of test fluids, such as CMC, as model broths. Although unaerated and aerated power characteristics were similar for both the test fluids and fermentation broths the hold-up values varied considerably, probably due to differing coalescence characteristics. Productivity (g/l/kWh) of batch phase Aspergillus niger fermentations was unaffected by system geometry, at least up to concentrations of circa 15 g/ 1...|$|E

We sought to validate the use of a new intracardiac <b>axial</b> <b>flow</b> <b>impeller</b> pump for this purpose. Methods and Results—The Jarvik 2000 Heart was implanted into 30 sheep to ascertain mechanical reliability, biocompatibility, and hemodynamic function. We attempted but failed to anticoagulate with warfarin. Elective explants with survival were performed in 3 animals to simulate bridge to recovery. Extensive autopsy studies were performed in all other animals. At speeds between 8000 and 12 000 rpm the device pumped up to 8 L/min, captured all mitral flow, and augmented cardiac output with elevation of mean arterial pressure. The pump was silent and hemolysis negligible. Nonpulsatile flow did not adversely affect neurological or renal function. Device removal proved straightforward and safe. A fractured inflow bearing occurred in 1 early model. There were no other pump failures, but power interruption occurred when the sheep chewed the cables or head-butted the percutaneous pedestal. At autopsy, there was no thromboembolism or primary thrombus formation in any device. Pump occlusion occurred in 2 sheep with bacterial endocarditis. One electively explanted pump, previously switched off for 5 months, had no thrombus in the device or vascular graft. Conclusions—The Jarvik 2000 Heart is a major advance in blood-pump technology and increases the scope of mechanical circulatory support.

40|$|Frothers {{are used}} in {{flotation}} to aid generation of small bubbles, but {{little is known about}} the mechanisms that take place in the flotation machine to produce such an effect. Coalescence prevention is the common explanation, although the exact mechanism is obscure and almost no attention has been paid to a frother effect on bubble break-up, the other possible mechanism. This thesis presents a technique to study the effect of frothers on bubble coalescence at the generation stage (at a capillary tube) and a technique to study the effect of frothers on bubble coalescence and break-up in a turbulent field. The first technique is based on the sound bubbles emit when they form and coalesce. The sound signal was linked to bubble formation and coalescence events using high-speed cinematography. The technique has a resolution capable of detecting coalescence events that occur within 1 - 2 ms. The second technique allows discriminating between coalescence and break-up and is based on the exposure of a mono-size distribution of bubbles to a turbulent field generated by a three-bladed <b>axial</b> <b>flow</b> <b>impeller.</b> Analysis of bubble size distributions after contact with the turbulent field gives the coalescence and break-up fraction. The results show frothers reduce coalescence and alter the bubble size distribution of bubbles generated by break-up.
