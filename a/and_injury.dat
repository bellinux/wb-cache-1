40|$|Violence <b>and</b> <b>injuries</b> are {{the leading}} cause of death for the first four decades of life. In fact, in the first half of life, more Americans die from {{violence}} <b>and</b> <b>injuries</b> than from any other cause, including cancer, HIV, or the flu. And deaths are only part of the problem. Each year, millions of people are injured <b>and</b> survive. <b>Injuries</b> can cause life-long mental, physical, and financial problems. Deaths <b>and</b> <b>injuries</b> from motor vehicle crashes, prescription drug overdoses, traumatic brain injuries, falls, child maltreatment, <b>and</b> other <b>injuries</b> are preventable. One of the best ways to prevent violence <b>and</b> <b>injuries</b> is to empower states to take action to protect their residents by implementing, <b>and</b> evaluating evidence-based <b>injury</b> <b>and</b> violence prevention (IVP) programs and policies.

5|$|At {{the age of}} 38, Lindwall {{made his}} final {{appearances}} for Australia during the 1959–60 tour of the Indian subcontinent, which saw three and five Tests against Pakistan and India respectively. The tour was marred by illness <b>and</b> <b>injury,</b> allowing him to play in {{only half of the}} Tests. Lindwall played in two Tests against either nation with only moderate results: he took nine wickets at 38.22 and scored 38 runs at 12.66. Lindwall finished with 228 Test wickets, eight wickets behind Alec Bedser's then world record of 236 wickets. In his last Test innings, Lindwall scored ten, which took his tally to 1502 runs, making him the first player to score 1500 runs and take 200 wickets in Test cricket.|$|E
5|$|Brian Charles Booth (born 19 October 1933) is {{a former}} Australian cricketer who played in 29 Tests from 1961 to 1966, and 93 {{first-class}} matches for New South Wales. He captained Australia for two Tests during the 196566 Ashes series while regular captain Bob Simpson was absent due to illness <b>and</b> <b>injury.</b> Booth was a graceful right-handed middle order batsman at No. 4 or 5, and occasionally bowled right arm medium pace or off spin. He had an inclination to use his feet to charge spin bowlers. Booth {{was known for his}} sportsmanship on the field and often invoked Christianity while discussing ethics and sport.|$|E
5|$|In April 1878, L'Estrange reappeared on the Australian {{scene with}} a new {{performance}} – gas ballooning. The first balloon ascent in Australia {{had been made in}} Melbourne in 1853, with Sydney following five years later in December 1858. The idea that people could be lifted from the ground to fly and return safely fired the imagination of the public, and the novelty of balloon ascents continued to draw large crowds through the 1860s and 1870s. No doubt the very real chance of disaster <b>and</b> <b>injury</b> added to the crowd's keen interest, as mishaps were not uncommon.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Traffic {{safety is}} an {{important}} topic because of serious economic burden which {{is linked to the}} problem (damage costs, health care costs, administration costs and costs resulting from loss of future output). In this paper, we model damage to property and accidents involving deaths <b>and</b> <b>injuries</b> in the Slovak Republic. Using secondary data, it was found out that accidents involving deaths <b>and</b> <b>injuries,</b> accidents caused by animals and accidents caused by speeding have a strong impact on damage to property. Interesting finding is that number of registered drivers has a negative impact on damage to property. On the other hand, accidents caused by animals and accidents caused by speeding {{have a negative impact on}} accidents involving deaths <b>and</b> <b>injuries.</b> Moreover, expressways seriously diminish number of accidents involving deaths <b>and</b> <b>injuries...</b>|$|R
5|$|Looking {{to build}} on the success of his 2014 season, Hughes went into the 2015 season as the Twins ace. Hughes had lost {{velocity}} in his fastball, dropping from 93MPH to 92MPH. His 2015 season was marred with inconsistency <b>and</b> <b>injury</b> as he only started 25 times while appearing 2 times out of the bullpen. Despite going 11-9, his ERA was 4.40 and he served up 29 home runs in only 155.1 innings.|$|E
5|$|Macartney resumed Test cricket when Australia hosted England in 1920–21, {{and was one}} of {{only four}} players {{remaining}} from before the war. However, he only played in two of the Tests due to illness <b>and</b> <b>injury.</b> His early season form was ominous for the tourists. Macartney scored 161 in guiding New South Wales to a successful run-chase of 4/335 over the Englishmen. He then scored 96 and 30 for an Australian XI against the tourists in a dress rehearsal for the Tests.|$|E
5|$|Neutrophils {{also play}} a key role in the {{development}} of most forms of acute lung injury. Here, activated neutrophils release the contents of their toxic granules into the lung environment. Experiments have shown that a reduction in the number of neutrophils lessens the effects of acute lung injury, but treatment by inhibiting neutrophils is not clinically realistic, as it would leave the host vulnerable to infection. In the liver, damage by neutrophils can contribute to dysfunction <b>and</b> <b>injury</b> in response to the release of endotoxins produced by bacteria, sepsis, trauma, alcoholic hepatitis, ischemia, and hypovolemic shock resulting from acute hemorrhage.|$|E

5|$|With Warnock {{replacing}} Ternent as Bury {{manager and}} Ternent {{moving on to}} manage Burnley, this signalled a return to Turf Moor for Swan. Ternent moved Swan back into defence, but could only give him eleven starts and six substitute appearances following a combination of suspensions, illness <b>and</b> <b>injury.</b> A collision with Wycombe Wanderers' Jason Cousins on 20 February 1999 spelt {{the beginning of the}} end for Swan's career, as the result of a scan showed he had snapped the cruciate ligament in his right knee.|$|E
5|$|Allen {{played as}} an inside linebacker {{throughout}} the preseason in 1993, {{but he was}} again cut to the practice squad {{before the start of}} the regular season. He was quickly brought back to the active roster and recorded five tackles in the Lions' season-opening win against the Toronto Argonauts. Allen saw regular playing time for the first time in his career, playing in fifteen regular season games for the Lions. He played mostly as a middle linebacker, but he briefly replaced Tyrone Jones twice at the outside linebacker position while he was recovering illness <b>and</b> <b>injury.</b> Allen finished the regular season with 67 tackles, two interceptions, and a fumble recovery. He also recovered a fumble in the Western Semi-Final, but the Lions went on to lose 9–17 to the Stampeders.|$|E
5|$|At Survivor Series, Triple H was {{scheduled}} to defend the championship against Vladimir Kozlov and Jeff Hardy, but Hardy was {{kept out of the}} match after a scripted attack <b>and</b> <b>injury.</b> During the match, SmackDown general manager Vickie Guerrero announced that Edge had returned and introduced him into the contest. Hardy interfered and hit Triple H with a steel chair meant for Edge, thus costing him the title after a 210 days reign and resulting in Edge winning his sixth world title. After failing to regain the title at Armageddon, Triple H entered seventh in the 2009 Royal Rumble, but was last eliminated by Randy Orton. In February at Elimination Chamber, Triple H won the WWE Championship in the SmackDown Elimination Chamber match, setting the record for most reigns at eight.

5|$|Hobbs {{missed a}} large part of the 1927 season with a {{combination}} of illness <b>and</b> <b>injury.</b> In between his absences, he performed well, although he was left out of the Gentlemen v Players match. He scored 1,641 runs at 52.93, including seven centuries. He began the 1928 season with four centuries in the first month, but another leg injury kept him out of cricket for six weeks. When he recovered, he was selected in the last two of the three Tests against the West Indies, playing their first Test series. In his first game, he and Sutcliffe shared a century partnership; in the third, Hobbs scored 159, having opened with a 155-run partnership with Sutcliffe. England won the series 3–0. Hobbs maintained his batting form until the end of the season; he finished second in the batting averages, scoring 2,542 runs at an average of 82.00 and hitting 12 centuries. Critics believed he remained unsurpassed among English batsmen.|$|E
5|$|In {{the last}} 16 of the competition, Luton faced Ipswich Town of the Second Division. Without several senior players because of ineligibility <b>and</b> <b>injury,</b> Luton scored early through Brian Stein's strike, and then {{produced}} a solid defensive performance, reliant on goalkeeper Les Sealey {{to earn a}} place in the quarter-finals. The result marked Ipswich's first defeat of the season, having earlier recorded 10 wins and two draws at Portman Road. Luton hosted Bradford City in the fifth round of the competition on 19 January 1988. A mistake by Bradford goalkeeper Paul Tomlinson handed Luton the lead four minutes before the hour, when he gave away a free kick for handling the ball in his area. A shot from Danny Wilson in the 65th minute resulted in Luton's second goal; though his effort was saved by Tomlinson, the goalkeeper could not fend off the advancing Harford's header.|$|E

The United States and other Western countries blamed the Syrian government for the attacks, while Syria blamed civil war opposition forces. In response to Ghouta, a coalition of countries led by the United States and France, which support the rebels, threatened air strikes on Syria. Russia, a key ally of Syria, along with China had earlier blocked efforts by the United States, France, and the UK to secure United Nations Security Council approval for military intervention. The United States and France headed a coalition of countries on the verge of carrying out air strikes on Syria.|$|E
