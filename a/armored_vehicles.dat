5|$|At {{approximately}} 5:00p.m., a heavy {{gun battle}} erupted {{on the outskirts}} of Jilib town between Islamic fighters and the Ethiopian-backed interim government troops. Tanks and <b>armored</b> <b>vehicles</b> were reported committed by Ethiopian forces.|$|E
5|$|Beginning in October, Libyan troops, led by Khalifa Haftar and Ahmed Oun, airlifted to the Aouzou Strip {{operated}} {{in conjunction with}} Goukouni's forces to reoccupy Faya. The city was then used as an assembly point for tanks, artillery and <b>armored</b> <b>vehicles</b> that moved south against the capital of N'Djamena.|$|E
5|$|The M5 and M6 tank mounted {{variants}} {{were used}} in several models of <b>armored</b> <b>vehicles</b> most notably in the Stuart Light Tank M3/M5, the Lee Medium Tank M3, and Greyhound Light Armored Car M8. In addition, the M3 in its original version was mated {{to a number of}} other self-propelled carriages.|$|E

5|$|As {{the units}} {{moved to the}} Saudi border, many were {{attacked}} by Coalition aircraft. Around the Al-Wafrah forest, about 1,000 Iraqi armored fighting vehicles were attacked by Harrier aircraft with Rockeye cluster bombs. Another Iraqi convoy of <b>armored</b> <b>vehicles</b> was hit by A-10s, which destroyed {{the first and last}} vehicles, before systematically attacking the stranded remainders. Such air raids prevented the majority of the Iraqi troops deployed for the offensive from taking part in it.|$|E
5|$|At 9:30p.m., the Sa'iqa company {{reported}} an Israeli armored column advancing towards the fort. Two Egyptian tanks {{on the west}} bank opened fire, forcing the Israeli tanks and <b>armored</b> <b>vehicles</b> to withdraw. The company continued eastwards, eventually reaching the crossroads, facing no resistance along the way. With the reinforcing anti-tank teams, the company established defensive positions, and el-'Abassi dispatched patrols to secure the roads leading to the fort.|$|E
5|$|Efforts {{to capture}} weapons from the Germans also proved highly successful. Raids were {{conducted}} on trains carrying equipment to the front, {{as well as on}} guardhouses and gendarmerie posts. Sometimes weapons were taken from individual German soldiers accosted in the street. During the Warsaw Uprising, the Home Army even managed to capture several German <b>armored</b> <b>vehicles.</b>|$|E
50|$|The 3d Light <b>Armored</b> <b>Vehicle</b> Battalion {{originally}} {{began as}} Company A (Reinforced), 1st Light <b>Armored</b> <b>Vehicle</b> Battalion in May 1983, and began receiving LAVs in April 1984. Company A, 1st Light <b>Armored</b> <b>Vehicle</b> Battalion became Company A, 3d Light <b>Armored</b> <b>Vehicle</b> Battalion in late 1985. The 3d Light <b>Armored</b> <b>Vehicle</b> Battalion, 27th Marines, 7th Marine Amphibious Brigade was activated on 11 September 1986. The Battalion was re-designated as the 3d Light Armored Infantry Battalion on 1 October 1988 and subsequently relocated to Okinawa, Japan in February 1989. The Battalion returned to Twentynine Palms on 18 July 1991 {{as part of}} Regimental Combat Team 7 (RCT-7).|$|R
40|$|This {{manuscript}} {{presents the}} development of an <b>armored</b> <b>vehicle</b> model in lateral and longitudinal directions. A Nine Degree of Freedom (9 -DOF) <b>armored</b> <b>vehicle</b> model was derived mathematically and integrated with an analytical tire dynamics known as Pacejka Magic Tire model. The <b>armored</b> <b>vehicle</b> model is developed using three main inputs of a vehicle system which are Pitman arm steering system, Powertrain system and also hydraulic assisted brake system. Several testings in lateral and longitudinal direction are performed such as double lane change, slalom, step steer and sudden acceleration and sudden braking to verify the <b>vehicle</b> model. The <b>armored</b> <b>vehicle</b> model is verified using validated software, CarSim, using HMMWV vehicle model as a benchmark. The verification responses show that the developed <b>armored</b> <b>vehicle</b> model can be used for both lateral and longitudinal direction analysis...|$|R
50|$|The regiment's <b>armored</b> <b>vehicle</b> core {{consists}} of 48 AMX, 90 VAB and 110 trucks. The regiment trains new recruits at headquarters; including <b>armored</b> <b>vehicle</b> crewmen and various mechanical trades {{as well as}} musicians and non-commissioned officers.|$|R
5|$|The Red Army {{employed}} D-1 howitzers from 1944 onwards, {{during the}} final stages of World War II. The D-1 was used primarily used against personnel, fortifications and key structures in the enemy rear. The anti-concrete G-530 shell was also sometimes used against <b>armored</b> <b>vehicles</b> with good results. During its service the gun earned a reputation for being reliable and accurate. The D-1 was finally withdrawn from service in the mid-seventies.|$|E
5|$|At dawn on August 11, one 300-man {{battalion}} of the 766th Regiment entered {{the village of}} P'ohang, creating a state of alarm among its populace. The village was only protected by a small force of South Korean Navy, Air Force and Army personnel comprising the rear guard of the ROK 3rd Division. The South Korean forces engaged the 766th forces around the village's middle school with small-arms fire until noon. At that point, North Korean <b>armored</b> <b>vehicles</b> moved in to reinforce the 766th troops and drove the South Koreans out of the village.|$|E
5|$|Before the First World War, the Spanish Army {{bought a}} Schneider-Brillié in 1909 {{to be used}} in Melilla, where armed {{conflict}} with local tribes was going on. This was a French bus platform that was fitted with an armoured body, to be used as troop transport. Although it was big, slow and its performance was not good, the Spanish Army learned the value of <b>armored</b> <b>vehicles</b> and bought a second one. Spanish Army officers appreciated the advantages of using advanced weapons technology in the Colonial War in Spanish Morocco and followed First World War advances.|$|E

5|$|Both sides {{suffered}} heavy casualties. The Polish {{casualties were}} particularly severe. In {{a relatively short}} time the Polish Second Army lost more than 22 percent of its personnel and 57 percent of its tanks and <b>armored</b> <b>vehicles</b> (about 200 total). Official estimates claimed about 18,000 casualties (including almost 5,000 dead). Some other estimates give the Polish casualties as up to 25,000. According to Polish historian Zbigniew Wawer, this was the most bloody battle that the Polish Army had been involved in since the battle of Bzura in 1939.|$|E
5|$|Defense systems play {{a smaller}} {{role in the}} industry. Ohio {{corporations}} were awarded around $5.5 billion of United States Department of Defense procurements. Notable defense contractors include Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company in Akron, Lockheed Martin in Akron, which won a contract to develop a space-ship in 2003 and produces the vertical launch ASROC missile, and Armor Holdings Aerospace and Defense Group in Fairfield. United Kingdom-based BAE Systems has a large facility in West Chester producing <b>armored</b> <b>vehicles,</b> armor kits, and ballistic glass.|$|E
5|$|However, {{despite the}} general superiority of its <b>armored</b> <b>vehicles,</b> by 29 August 1944, {{as the last}} {{surviving}} German troops of Fifth Panzer Army and Seventh Army began retreating towards Germany, the twin cataclysms of the Falaise Pocket and the Seine crossing had cost the Wehrmacht dearly. Of the 2,300 tanks and assault guns it had committed to Normandy (including around 750 Panzer IVs), over 2,200 had been lost. Field Marshal Walter Model reported to Hitler that his panzer divisions had remaining, on average, five or six tanks each.|$|E

5|$|In {{the months}} that followed, the 24th Division played an {{important}} part of Operation Desert Shield by providing heavy firepower with its large number of <b>armored</b> <b>vehicles,</b> including 216 M1A1 Abrams tanks. Elements of the division were still arriving in September, and in the logistical chaos that followed the rapid arrival of U.S. forces in the region, the soldiers of the 24th Division were housed in warehouses, airport hangars, and on the desert sand. The 24th remained in relatively stationary positions in defense of Saudi Arabia until additional American forces arrived for Operation Desert Storm.|$|E
5|$|The Polish {{government}} {{agreed to}} Beck's proposal, and the ultimatum was toned down. However, {{at the same}} time, Beck ordered military preparations. Poland assembled four divisions along the demarcation line; about 50,000 Polish troops were present, and just over 20,000 Lithuanian troops. The Polish troops were reinforced by <b>armored</b> <b>vehicles,</b> by two air force regiments, consisting of about one hundred aircraft, and by the Polish fleet {{in the waters of}} the Baltic Sea along the Lithuanian shore.|$|E
5|$|The Saudi and Kuwaiti units renewed {{operations}} {{the following}} day. Two Iraqi companies, with about 20 <b>armored</b> <b>vehicles,</b> {{remained in the}} city and had not attempted to break out during the night. While the Saudi 8th Battalion continued operations in the southern portion of the city, the 7th Battalion began to clear the northern sector of the city. Iraqi resistance was sporadic and most Iraqi soldiers surrendered on sight; as a result, the city was recaptured on 1 February 1991.|$|E

5|$|The Soviet Army {{captured}} {{large numbers}} of German <b>armored</b> <b>vehicles,</b> including Panzer IVs (Russian designation T-4). Some of them were pressed into temporary service and some others were used for training. Sometimes, captured tanks were used in different temporary units or as single tanks. While captured Tigers and Panthers were only permitted to be used until they broke down, {{the simplicity of the}} Panzer IV and the large number of captured parts allowed for repair and continued use.|$|E
5|$|The first {{power-assisted}} steering on {{any type of}} vehicle dates to 1876, but little is recorded of the system. Other {{attempts were made to}} add {{power-assisted steering}} to motorized vehicles such as in the 1903 Columbia 5-ton truck and other heavy vehicles, {{but it was not until}} 1928 that a practical hydraulic power system was invented by Francis W. Davis. It was used on some <b>armored</b> <b>vehicles</b> and heavy trucks during World War II, but it took more than decades before the system was commercialized in passenger automobiles.|$|E
5|$|After a {{succession}} of counterattacks, {{toward the end of}} August the Libyans finally drove the 400 Chadian soldiers out of the town. This victory–the first by Libyan ground forces {{since the start of the}} Toyota War–was apparently achieved through close-range air strikes, which were followed by ground troops advancing cross-country in jeeps, Toyota all-terrain trucks, and light <b>armored</b> <b>vehicles.</b> For the Libyans, who had previously relied on ponderous tracked armour, the assault represented a conversion to the desert warfare tactics developed by FANT. To highlight the victory, Gaddafi flew foreign journalists to the region, so the news of his victory could reach the headlines.|$|E
