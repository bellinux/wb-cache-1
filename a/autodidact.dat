5|$|From a {{very young}} age, Rosado {{identified}} with the cause of Puerto Rico's independence. He joined the socialist league with which he participated in several activities. Rosado was an <b>autodidact</b> and an avid reader of various kinds of literature, especially those related to the political processes of Puerto Rico and Latin America. He also wrote poems, essays, and had several pen-pals throughout Latin America.|$|E
5|$|Eugenio Espejo was an <b>autodidact,</b> and {{he claimed}} with pride {{that he never}} left any book in his hands unread, and if he did, he would {{make up for it}} by observing nature. However, his desire to read {{everything}} indiscriminately sometimes led him to hasty judgments, which appear in his manuscripts. Through his own written work, it can be inferred that Espejo considered education as the main means for popular development. He understood that reading was basic {{in the formation of the}} self, and his conscience drove him to critiques of the establishment, based on observation and in the application of the law of his time.|$|E

5|$|Expected by {{his family}} {{to work as a}} stockbroker, Kertész pursued {{photography}} independently as an <b>autodidact,</b> and his early work was published primarily in magazines, a major market in those years. This continued until much later in his life, when Kertész stopped accepting commissions. He served briefly in World War I and moved to Paris in 1925, then the artistic capital of the world, against the wishes of his family. In Paris he worked for France's first illustrated magazine called VU. Involved with many young immigrant artists and the Dada movement, he achieved critical and commercial success.|$|E
5|$|Henry Moore {{was born}} in Castleford, West Riding of Yorkshire, England, to Mary Baker and Raymond Spencer Moore. His father was of Irish origin and became pit deputy and then under-manager of the Wheldale {{colliery}} in Castleford. He was an <b>autodidact</b> {{with an interest in}} music and literature. Determined that his sons would not work in the mines, he saw formal education as the route to their advancement. Henry was the seventh of eight children in a family that often struggled with poverty. He attended infant and elementary schools in Castleford, where he began modelling in clay and carving in wood. He professed to have decided to become a sculptor when he was eleven after hearing of Michelangelo's achievements at a Sunday School reading.|$|E
5|$|Luang Pu Sodh {{was born}} as Sodh Mikaewnoi on 10 October 1884 to a {{relatively}} well-off family of rice merchants in Amphoe Song Phi Nong, Suphan Buri, a province 102km west of Bangkok in central Thailand. His father was called Ngen and his mother Soodjai. He received part of his schooling in the temple of his uncle, a Buddhist monk, when he was nine years old. He therefore became familiar with Buddhism from an early age. He also showed qualities of being an intelligent <b>autodidact.</b> When Sodh's uncle moved to Wat Hua Bho, he took Sodh with him to teach him further. After a while his uncle left the monkhood, but Ngen managed to send Sodh to study with Luang Por Sub, the abbot of Wat Bangpla. This is where Sodh learnt the Khmer language. When he was thirteen years old, he finished his Khmer studies there and returned home to help his father. Father Ngen ran a rice-trading business, shipping rice from Suphanburi to sell to rice mills in Bangkok and Nakhon Chai Si District. At the age of fourteen, Ngen died, {{and he had to}} take responsibility for the family business, being the first son. This had an impact on him: thieves and other threats brought home to him the futility of the household life, and at the age of eighteen, he desired to be ordained as a monk. He had to take care of his family first though, and saved up money for them to be able to leave behind after he would become a monk. The biography of Wat Phra Dhammakaya says that he had to calculate the rate of inflation for this, and work harder than before, but finally managed to gather enough funds after four years.|$|E

50|$|The {{secular and}} modern {{societies}} gave foundations {{for a new}} system of education and a new kind of <b>autodidacts.</b> While the number of schools and students raised from one century to the other, so did the number of <b>autodidacts.</b> The industrial revolution produced new educational tools used in schools, universities and outside academic circles to create a post-modern era that gave birth to the World Wide Web and encyclopaedic data banks such as Wikipedia. As this concept becomes more widespread and popular, web locations like Udacity and Khan Academy are developed as learning centers for many people to actively and freely learn together. The Alliance for Self-Directed Education (ASDE) is also formed to publicize and provide guidance or support for Self-Directed Education.|$|R

25|$|One of {{the more}} {{colorful}} figures in 20th-century mathematics was Srinivasa Aiyangar Ramanujan (1887–1920), an Indian <b>autodidact</b> who conjectured or proved over 3000 theorems, including properties of highly composite numbers, the partition function and its asymptotics, and mock theta functions. He also made major investigations {{in the areas of}} gamma functions, modular forms, divergent series, hypergeometric series and prime number theory.|$|E
25|$|According to {{the later}} hagiographical literature, Theodore {{received}} an education befitting his family's station, {{and from the}} age of seven was instructed by a private tutor, eventually concentrating in particular on theology.

50|$|Because in the 18th Century good {{penmanship}} {{was primarily}} considered an important business skill, the copybooks frequently were oriented towards <b>autodidacts</b> wishing to learn business skills, and therefore included chapters on general business management {{as well as}} lessons in accounting. Other copybooks, however, focused chiefly on writing literacy and used maxims and sometimes Bible verses as their material. It was intended that students memorize not only correct penmanship, but correct morals as well, through exposure to traditional sayings.|$|R

He was 27 and a married man. Urlus stayed in Amsterdam for the next few years, gaining further musical training on the job.

25|$|During the John F. Kennedy administration, the Entrance Hall (like {{most of the}} White House) {{underwent}} {{an extensive}} historic redecoration. The redecoration of the State Floor rooms, including the Entrance Hall, was overseen by American antiques <b>autodidact</b> Henry Francis du Pont and French interior designer Stéphane Boudin. Du Pont wanted a more historic approach to the White House, while Boudin preferred a French design aesthetic. Du Pont originally redecorated the Entrance Hall with two French pier tables, a settee, a card table, and two tables by Charles-Honoré Lannuier. Boudin had all but the pier tables removed, and his style is the one which remained {{over the next several}} decades.|$|E
50|$|Abraham Lincoln and Charles Darwin {{were born}} on the same day, February 12, 1809.

Darwin closely followed the events of the American Civil War and wanted Lincoln and the Union to prevail, but it is unlikely that Lincoln read Darwin's work.|$|R

25|$|Spencer {{was educated}} in {{empirical}} science by his father, while {{the members of}} the Derby Philosophical Society introduced him to pre-Darwinian concepts of biological evolution, particularly those of Erasmus Darwin and Jean-Baptiste Lamarck.

Thomas Spencer also imprinted on his nephew his own firm free-trade and anti-statist political views. Otherwise, Spencer was an <b>autodidact</b> who acquired most of his knowledge from narrowly focused readings and conversations with his friends and acquaintances.|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{explores the}} autodidactic {{tradition}} in Scottish poetry {{during the nineteenth}} century. From {{the late eighteenth century}} onwards self-taught Scottish poets offered a vigorous alternative to the literary mainstream. <b>Autodidacts</b> explored both oral and literary styles and genres, utilising a wide frame of reference to express their unique experiences and ideas. Diversity of poetic voice characterises autodidactic poets, including Robert Burns, Janet Little, Allan Cunningham, Alexander Anderson and James Young Geddes. However, Scottish <b>autodidacts</b> shared poetic concerns and techniques, and were highly influenced by their compeers. It is suggested that James Hogg, 'the Ettrick Shepherd' is the central and most significant figure in forming a Scottish autodidactic identity. There are three major sections to the thesis. Part One looks at the origins of the 'peasant poet' image in the national context, exploring prototypes such as Ramsay's The Gentle Shepherd (1725), Macpherson's Ossian and Burns as 'Heaven-taught ploughman'. The middle section concentrates on Hogg, illustrating the precise ways in which he explored and, at times, resented his peasant poet typecasting. Works considered include Scottish Pastorals (1801), The Mountain Bard (1807 and 1821), The Queen's Wake (1813), The Poetic Mirror (1816), The Royal Jubilee (1822), Queen Hynde (1825), Pilgrims of the Sun (1815 and 1822) and A Queer Book (1832). Part Three discusses Scottish autodidacticism as it developed after Hogg, discerning subgroups within the peasant poet category...|$|R
