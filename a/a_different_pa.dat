40|$|Designing student peer {{assessment}} in higher education: analysis of written and oral peer feedback Relating it to design features, {{the present article}} describes the nature of written and oral peer feedback as it occurred in seven writing courses, each with <b>a</b> <b>different</b> <b>PA</b> design. Results indicate that generally, peer feedback in all courses was focused on evaluation, which {{is only one of}} the four feedback functions. Feedback on structure was hardly provided. As it turned out, the differences between the outcomes per course were related to three design features. For PA to yield more adequate feedback we recommend that (1) the assessment is performed in small feedback groups; (2) the written feedback is orally explained and discussed with the receiver; (3) PA takes place at the end as well as at the start of the writing process...|$|E
40|$|The three {{proteins}} that comprise anthrax toxin, edema factor (EF), lethal factor (LF), and protective antigen (PA), assemble at the mammalian cell surface into toxic complexes. After binding to its receptor, PA is proteolytically activated, yielding a carboxyl-terminal 63 -kDa fragment (PA 63) that coordinates {{assembly of the}} complexes, promotes their endocytosis, and translocates EF and LF to the cytosol. PA 63 spontaneously oligomerizes to form symmetric ring-shaped heptamers {{that are capable of}} binding three molecules of EF and/or LF as competing ligands. To determine whether binding of these ligands depends on oligomerization of PA 63, we prepared two oligomerization-deficient forms of this protein, each mutated on <b>a</b> <b>different</b> <b>PA</b> 63 –PA 63 contact face. In solution or when bound to receptors on Chinese hamster ovary K 1 cells, neither mutant alone bound ligand, but a mixture of them did. After the two mutants were proteolytically activated and mixed with ligand in solution, a ternary complex was isolated containing one molecule of each protein. Thus EF and LF bind stably only to PA 63 dimers or higher order oligomers. These findings are relevant to the kinetics and pathways of assembly of anthrax toxin complexes...|$|E
40|$|Vasoconstrictor {{effects of}} Bay K 8644 (an agonist known to {{increase}} Ca 2 + influx through the voltage-dependent Ca 2 + channels) on femoral arteries of 6 week old spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) were investigated, and data compared with findings in age-matched normotensive Wistar-Kyoto rats (WKY). The addition of Bay K 8644 (1 X 10 (- 10) - 3 X 10 (- 7) M) elicited a dose-dependent contraction in SHR femoral artery {{in the absence}} of any contractile agent. Maximum contraction induced by this agonist was the same as the maximum induced by either K+-depolarization or alpha-adrenoceptor stimulation. Bay K 8644 was less effective in eliciting a contraction in the WKY femoral artery. Increased sensitivity to K+ was also observed in the SHR femoral artery. In contrast, contractions in response to alpha-adrenoceptor stimulation were the same in the SHR as those in the WKY. The addition of nifedipine, a Ca 2 + channel antagonist, to an unstimulated preparation produced a dose-dependent relaxation in femoral arteries from SHR, but not from WKY. When the arteries were contracted with 60 mM K+, nifedipine produced similar relaxations in the SHR as those in the WKY, suggesting that the Ca 2 + channels in the SHR femoral arteries are more activated than those in the WKY femoral arteries. Contractile responses to SHR femoral arteries to Bay K 8644 were antagonized competitively by nifedipine. Contractile responses to Ca 2 + determined in K+-depolarized strips were also antagonized competitively by nifedipine. However, Schild plot analysis demonstrated <b>a</b> <b>different</b> <b>pA</b> 2 value for nifedipine, suggesting that there may be a difference in the state of voltage-dependent Ca 2 + channels in SHR femoral artery between the stimulation with Bay K 8644 and K+-depolarization...|$|E

The combined data taken at two different wavelength ranges substantiated the broadband characteristics of 1 -Cn. We proposed that the observed broadband absorptions may be attributed by a partial π-conjugation between the C 60 > cage and CPAF-Cn moieties, via endinitrile tautomeric resonance, giving a resonance state with enhanced molecular conjugation. This transient state could increase its 2 PA and excited-state absorption at 800 nm. In addition, a trend of concentration-dependent 2 PA cross-section (σ 2) and excited-state absorption magnitude was detected showing a higher σ value at a lower concentration that was correlated to increasing molecular separation with less aggregation for dyads C 60 (>CPAF-C 18) and C 60 (>CPAF-C 9), as better 2 PA and excited-state absorbers...|$|R

Methods: Three monolingual German-speaking pre-school children aged 5; 04 – 6; 01 with bilateral CIs were tested. Their cognitive, speech and language skills were assessed. Six subtests of a standardized PA test battery were administered (i. e. rhyme identification, rhyme production; phoneme identification-input and -output; phoneme blending-input and -output). Results: All three children showed distinctive PA profiles. One boy, who had no spoken language deficits, struggled to complete the rhyme tasks but performed well on three phoneme tasks. However, he showed a discrepancy between expressive and receptive phoneme blending skills, scoring poorly on the expressive subtest. The second boy, who displayed grammar comprehension and expressive vocabulary difficulties, showed a mixed profile, with a below average performance on rhyme production. The girl who had significant speech and language deficits scored below average on all six PA subtests.

Moderate- to vigorous- intensity PA (MVPA) {{was measured by the}} Physical Activity Questionnaire for Older Children (PAQ-C) and with an ActiGraph GT 3 X accelerometer. Correlations and hierarchical regressions were performed to explore their associations. The study psychological variables were all positively related to PAQ-C and objective MVPA (r: 0. 22 – 0. 63). The associations with PAQ-C were all substantially stronger than those with accelerometry. Beyond the explained variance accounted for by demographics and social desirability, the addition of the psychological correlates accounted for 45 % of the variance of the PAQ-C score, while only 13 % for accelerometry-based MVPA. The associations of specific variables with the PAQ-C score (age, PA self-efficacy, autonomous motivation and preference) were somewhat different from those associated with objective MVPA (PA self-efficacy, autonomous motivation, and negatively associated with female gender).

40|$|Abstract Background In {{the past}} decade, various reviews {{described}} {{the relationship between}} the physical environment and <b>different</b> physical activity (<b>PA)</b> domains. Yet, the majority of the current review evidence relies on North American/Australian studies, while only a small proportion of findings refer to European studies. Given some clear environmental differences across continents, this raises questions about the applicability of those results in European settings. This systematic review aimed at summarizing Europe-specific evidence on {{the relationship between the}} physical environment and <b>different</b> <b>PA</b> domains in adults. Methods Seventy eligible papers were identified through systematic searches across six electronic databases. Included papers were observational studies assessing the relationship between several aspects of the physical environment and PA in European adults (18 - 65 y). Summary scores were calculated to express the strength of the relationship between each environmental factor and <b>different</b> <b>PA</b> domains. Results Convincing evidence on positive relationships with several PA domains was found for following environmental factors: walkability, access to shops/services/work and the composite factor environmental quality. Convincing evidence considering urbanization degree showed contradictory results, dependent on the observed PA domain. Transportation PA was more frequently related to the physical environment than recreational PA. Possible evidence for a positive relationship with transportation PA emerged for walking/cycling facilities, while a negative relationship was found for hilliness. Some environmental factors, such as access to recreational facilities, aesthetics, traffic- and crime-related safety were unrelated to <b>different</b> <b>PA</b> domains in Europe. Conclusions Generally, findings from this review of European studies are in accordance with results from North American/Australian reviews and may contribute to a generalization {{of the relationship between the}} physical environment and PA. Nevertheless, the lack of associations found regarding access to recreational facilities, aesthetics and different forms of safety are likely to be Europe-specific findings and need to be considered when appropriate interventions are developed. More research assessing domain-specific relationships with several understudied environmental attributes (e. g., residential density) is needed. </p...|$|R

40|$|Background Predictors of {{physical}} activity (PA) change are rarely investigated separately for <b>different</b> <b>PA</b> intensities and for weekdays/weekends. We investigated whether individual-level predictors of one-year change in objectively-measured physical activity differ for moderate PA (MPA) and vigorous PA (VPA) and for weekends and weekdays. Methods Accelerometer-assessed PA (mins) was obtained at baseline and + 1 year (n[*]=[*] 875, 41. 5 % male, Mean[*]±[*]SD baseline age: 9. 8 [*]±[*] 0. 4 years-old). Potential predictors (n[*]=[*] 38) were assessed at baseline from psychological (e. g. self-efficacy), socio-cultural (e. g. parent support) and environmental domains (e. g. land use). Associations between predictors and change in MPA (2000 – 3999 counts/minute (cpm)) and VPA (≥ 4000 cpm) separately for weekdays and weekends were studied using multi-level linear regression. Analyses were adjusted for school clustering, sex and baseline PA. Results Weekend PA declined (MPA decline 4. 6 [*]±[*] 21. 8 mins/day; VPA decline: 2. 1 [*]±[*] 20. 1 mins/day; both p[*]<[*] 0. 001) whereas weekday PA did not significantly change. Higher baseline PA and being a girl were associated with greater PA declines in all four outcomes; remaining predictors differed for MPA and VPA and/or weekdays and weekends. Family logistic support was associated with less of a decline in weekend MPA (CI 95 %) 0. 15 (0. 05, 0. 25) and VPA 0. 19 (0. 09, 0. 29), and peer support with less of a decline in weekday MPA 0. 18 (0. 02, 0. 34) and VPA 0. 22 (0. 06, 0. 38).

40|$|This thesis work {{studied the}} {{behavioral}} modeling, estimation of parameters, model performance and linearization of power amplifier (PA) using Digital Pre Distortion (DPD) technique. PAs {{are one of}} the fundamental block in communication systems and also one of the main sources of nonlinearities in the system, as these devices are frequently subjected to signals characterized by considerable bandwidths and non-constant envelopes due to use of modern modulation technique. Moreover, PAs have high efficiency level at its nonlinear region. So, to operate the PA at its high efficiency region, linearization operation needs to be done. This has been investigated in this thesis work with the help of behavioral modeling and DPD. An essential initial step in designing a linearizer for a PA is to model the PA nonlinearity accurately. Behavioral modeling has been used for PA model for its computational efficiency, which means by relating input and output signals without addressing to the physical analysis of the device. DPD technique has been chosen for linearizing the performance of PA based on their low requirement of resources for implementation. In this thesis, five <b>different</b> <b>PA</b> models with memory effect, based on Volterra series, are studied and compared for three <b>different</b> <b>PAs</b> selected by Ericsson.

The results also describe that; two of the given PA’s can be linearized by using the DPD technique within the 3 GPP standard regulations for ACPR. ...|$|R

40|$|Objectives: The European Physical Activity Surveillance System (EUPASS) {{research}} project compared several physical activity (PA) measures (including the International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ)) {{in a time}} series survey in eight countries of the European Union. The present paper describes first results provided by the <b>different</b> instruments regarding <b>PA</b> participation, frequency and duration, both at the European and national levels. The {{purpose of the present}} study is to explore and compare the specific quality and usefulness of different indicators rather than to provide valid and reliable prevalence data. Thus, the main focus is on discussion of the methodological implications of the results presented. Methods: A time series survey based on computer-aided telephone interviewing (CATI) was carried out in eight European countries over a six-month period. The study provided for about 100 realised interviews per month in each country (i. e. ~ 600 per country). Descriptive statistical analysis was used to: (1) report IPAQ results on vigorous, moderate and light PA and sitting, as well as on the overall measure of calories expenditure (MET min− 1), in the different countries; (2) compare these results with national PA indicators tested in EUPASS; and (3) compare IPAQ results with other European studies. Results: First, the scores for the <b>different</b> <b>PA</b> categories as well as for the overall measure of calories expenditure provided by the IPAQ appeared rather high compared with previous studies and public health recommendations. Second, the <b>different</b> <b>PA</b> measurements used in EUPASS provided completely different results. For example, national indicators used in Germany and The Netherlands to date neither corresponded in absolute values (e. g. means of PA or sitting) nor correlated with the IPAQ in any significant way. Third, comparing EU countries, the ranking for vigorous, moderate and light activities by use of the IPAQ differed from that of other European studies. For example, in the present analysis, German respondents generally showed higher scores for PA than the Finns and the Dutch, while, in contrast, findings from other studies ranked Finland before The Netherlands and Germany. Conclusions: The present analysis highlights some methodological implications of the IPAQ instrument. Among other things, differences in overall scores for PA as well as in the ranking of nations between the present results using IPAQ and other measures and studies may partly be due to the concepts of PA behind the measurements. Further analysis should investigate if the range of PA-related categories provided by the IPAQ is fully appropriate to measure all relevant daily activities; it may also consider the public health implications of mixing up <b>different</b> contexts of <b>PA</b> (e. g. work, leisure-time, transportation) in the IPAQ short version...|$|R

A survey was conducted with PA instructors from 44 institutions from across the U. S. participating. Each institution was assessed to determine amount of time they spent teaching on 59 <b>different</b> <b>PA</b> topics in their PA-related courses. Results were obtained from 56 PA courses. Scope of PA, Global Positioning System (GPS), Differential GPS, Yield Monitoring, and Yield Map were all topics that were frequently discussed in PA courses, whether they were entryor advanced-level or two-year or four-year institutions. Review of the content showed {{a need for a}} more standardized curriculum...|$|R
40|$|Two studies {{explored}} {{the nature of}} phonological awareness (PA) in Chinese. In Study 1, involving 146 children, awareness of phoneme onset {{did not differ from}} chance levels at ages 3 – 5 years in preschool but increased to 70 % correct in first grade, when children first received phonological coding (Pinyin) instruction. Similarly, tone awareness was at better than chance levels from second year kindergarten (age 4), but increased strongly and significantly in first grade to 74 % accuracy. In contrast, syllable and rime awareness increased gradually and steadily across ages 3 – 6 years. Patterns suggest different influences of age and literacy instruction for <b>different</b> <b>PA</b> levels. In Study 2, involving 202 preschoolers, variance in Chinese character recognition was best explained by tasks of syllable awareness, tone awareness, and speeded naming. Findings underscore the unique impor-tance of both tone and syllable for early character acquisition in Chinese children...|$|R
25|$|The PA clan (Proteases {{of mixed}} nucleophile, {{superfamily}} A) {{is the largest}} group of proteases with common ancestry as identified by structural homology. Members have a chymotrypsin-like fold and similar proteolysis mechanisms but sequence identity of <10%. The clan contains both cysteine and serine proteases (<b>different</b> nucleophiles). <b>PA</b> clan proteases can be found in plants, animals, fungi, eubacteria, archaea and viruses.|$|R
40|$|Purpose: The primary {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to determine the physical activity (PA) preferences in a sample of individuals with prediabetes. Methods: Individuals with prediabetes (N = 232) residing in Northern Alberta, Canada completed a mailed questionnaire that assessed demographic and health variables, self-reported PA (Godin Leisure-Time Exercise Questionnaire), and PA preferences. Results: Respondents indicated they would like to be counseled about PA (75 %), were physically able to participate (96 %), were interested in a PA program for individuals with prediabetes (86 %), and were most interested in walking (71 %). Activity status, number of comorbidities, level of employment, marital status, body mass index, and time since diagnosis with prediabetes all demonstrated significant influence on <b>different</b> <b>PA</b> preference variables. Conclusions: There is a demand for PA-related programs for individuals with prediabetes. Incorporating identified PA preferences of those with prediabetes might aid in the development of relevant intervention tools, programs, and strategies to support PA...|$|R
