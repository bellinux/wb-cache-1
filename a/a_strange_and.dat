Fumi Nakashima, the sub-character chief designer, concentrated on giving characters from different regions and cultures distinct styles of clothing. Nakashima wanted the machine-oriented society of the Al Bhed to stand out and had them wear masks and goggles to give them <b>a</b> <b>strange</b> <b>and</b> eccentric appearance.|$|E

The comic's style and themes include elements from science, fantasy creatures, mythology from a variety of traditions, and alchemical symbols and theories; the literary style is heavily influenced by mystery fiction and manga.|$|E

5|$|Gauguin {{made three}} casts in 1894, each in {{partially}} glazed stoneware. Several other copies exist in plaster or bronze. His {{sale of the}} casts were not successful, and at a low financial and personal ebb he asked that {{for one of the}} reproductions to act as a marker for his grave. A cast was not placed there until 1973. There are only three other surviving comments of his on the figure: on an 1895 presentation mount of two impressions of a woodcut of the Oviri figure he made to Stéphane Mallarmé where he called the figure <b>a</b> <b>strange</b> <b>and</b> cruel enigma; in an 1897 letter to Ambroise Vollard where he referred to it as La Tueuse ("The Murderess"); and in a c. 1899 drawing where he appends an inscription referencing Honoré de Balzac's novel Séraphîta. Oviri was exhibited at the 1906 Salon d'Automne (no.57) where it influenced Pablo Picasso, who based one of the figures in Les Demoiselles d'Avignon on it.|$|E

Many years later, after Gandalf confirms his guess, he tells Frodo the history of the Ring and counsels him to take it away from the Shire. Frodo sets out, accompanied by his gardener and friend, Samwise ("Sam") Gamgee, and two cousins, Meriadoc Brandybuck, called Merry, and Peregrin Took, called Pippin.

As the Stanton {{children}} walk home, Miss Greythorne (Frances Conroy), the local mistress of the Manor, and her Butler Merriman Lyon (Ian McShane) invite the siblings to a Christmas party. Later, two farmers, Dawson (James Cosmo) and Old George (Jim Piddock), whom Will does not know, arrive at his house with a large Christmas tree ordered by the family. The farmers know Will’s name, wish him a happy birthday, and predict a storm despite the relatively clear sky. Will’s birthday {{is so close to}} Christmas that everyone in his large family ignores it except for his little sister Gwen (Emma Lockhart), who gives him his only birthday present (a Casio G-Shock Mudman wristwatch). The family has moved from the United States to a small English village and one of his brothers has arrived home for the holidays and displaces Will to the attic. For a Christmas present, Will buys Gwen an enigmatic stone pendant at the local mall. Two suspicious security guards accuse him of shoplifting and take him to their office. Alarmingly, as they question Will under the room's flickering lights, the guards metamorphose into rooks. They attack Will, but he manages to escape, accidentally using his powers for the first time. Will begins to experience more odd incidents and receives <b>a</b> <b>strange</b> <b>and</b> Celtic-looking belt from his oldest brother, Stephen (Jordan J. Dale).|$|E

500|$|Within {{two months}} of its {{successful}} premiere at the Odd Fellows Concert Hall in Copenhagen on 28 February 1912, the Third Symphony (Espansiva) was in the repertoire of the Amsterdam Concertgebouw, and by 1913 it had seen performances in Stuttgart, Stockholm and Helsinki.

Leslie begins to have doubts about bringing {{him to her}} mother and tries to call it off, but Justin insists that they should [...] "let this unfold". At the dance, where Andy's (Chris Pratt) band Mouse Rat is playing, Frank meets up with Marlene, who is repulsed by Frank's past, current unemployment and overall failure at life. She turns down his offer at a second chance at love, prompting him to storm onto the stage and denounce her over the microphone. Leslie apologizes to her mother for bringing Frank. She is later upset with Justin, but has trouble pinpointing the reasons for her dissatisfaction. Ron (Nick Offerman) explains that Justin is a [...] "tourist," [...] meaning that he takes [...] "vacations in people's lives" [...] and only cares about telling interesting stories to impress other people, which makes him selfish. Two older women then recognize Ron as jazz saxophonist Duke Silver, but he denies it. Leslie later breaks up with Justin, which Tom (Aziz Ansari) takes especially hard, reacting as if his parents were getting divorced.|$|E

The site chosen at Lord Airey's Battery {{on the southern}} tip of the Rock already had an existing tunnelling scheme for a shelter.

Much thought was also given to the type of men needed for such <b>a</b> <b>strange</b> <b>and</b> demanding task.

The full team was in place by the end of summer 1942 and their cavern fully equipped and ready for occupation. A comprehensive manual was prepared on all aspects of the operation and it was considered that similar secret lookout posts should be prepared throughout the world in the event of future wars. However, Operation Tracer was never needed, as Adolf Hitler turned his attention away from Gibraltar and towards the Eastern Front.|$|E
