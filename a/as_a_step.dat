5|$|Abu Bakar promuglated the Johor State Establishment Constitution (Malay: Undang-undang Tubuh Negeri Johor), {{drafted by}} Abdul Rahman Andak, on 14 April 1895. The state's {{constitution}} {{was seen as}} a turning point by many <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>step</b> in laying the groundwork for the administration of Johor. It was suggested that Abu Bakar, who was fearful of his possible imminet death in light of his failing health, promogulated the state constitution with the intent of preserving the state's independence in the light of growing British political influence in the Malay states.|$|E
5|$|From the 1994–95 to 2013–14 seasons the Regional League, {{along with}} the Midland Football Combination, served {{as one of the}} two {{official}} feeders to the Midland Football Alliance. The highest-placed team which met the Alliance's entry requirements was promoted to the Alliance, and one or more teams were relegated into the Regional League from the Alliance depending on the number of clubs remaining in each league. (These requirements were inherited by the second Midland League; see last paragraph.) Prior to the 2006–07 season, the league was defined <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>step</b> 7 league within the National League System, even though it fed into the Alliance, which was graded as step 5. In 2006 the Regional League was re-graded by the Football Association <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>step</b> 6 league. Teams in the top two divisions are eligible {{to take part in the}} FA Cup and FA Vase as long as their grounds meet the required standards.|$|E
5|$|James VI's {{inheritance}} of the English crown in 1603 led to rule via the Privy Council from London. He also increasingly controlled the {{meetings of the}} Scottish General Assembly and increased the number and powers of the Scottish bishops. In 1618, he held a General Assembly and pushed through Five Articles, which included practices that had been retained in England but largely abolished in Scotland, most controversially kneeling for the reception of communion. Although ratified, they created widespread opposition and resentment and were seen by many <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>step</b> back to Catholic practice.|$|E

5|$|Public {{opinion in}} Texas was divided. Editorials in the United States began advocating {{complete}} independence for Texas. After several men staged a minor revolt against customs duties in Anahuac in June, local leaders began {{calling for a}} public meeting {{to determine whether a}} majority of settlers favored independence, a return to federalism, or the status quo. Although some leaders worried that Mexican officials would see this type of gathering <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>step</b> towards revolution, by the end of August most communities had agreed to send delegates to the Consultation, scheduled for October 15.|$|E
5|$|However, the {{two nations}} were still working at cross-purposes. The British saw the IRBMs <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>step</b> {{on the path to}} an {{independent}} nuclear deterrent, while the Americans saw it as an augmentation of the Strategic Air Command (SAC). The Americans originally envisaged the employment of 120 Thor missiles in four USAF squadrons, the 672nd, 673rd, 674th and 675th Strategic Missile Squadrons, and four RAF squadrons, the first two of which would at first be manned by USAF personnel. The October 1957 Sputnik crisis caused this plan to be modified. It placed the Eisenhower administration under great public pressure to act on the deployment of missiles by a shocked and distraught nation. Sputnik demonstrated the Soviet Union's capability to deploy ICBMs. The United States now needed the IRBMs—and British cooperation—more than ever. The proposal to base USAF Thor squadrons in Britain was dropped on 12 October 1957.|$|E
5|$|In {{the later}} 1950s, Constantine {{supported}} the campaign, led by James, to appoint West Indies cricket's first black captain; {{the success of}} black people like Constantine in attaining government positions while not permitted to captain the cricket team was {{a key factor in}} an ultimately successful campaign. While in government, Constantine assisted {{in the development of the}} West Indies Federation, <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>step</b> towards the independence of the islands, and his fame and familiarity with Britain played some part in the negotiations which led to Trinidad's independence in 1962. After he decided not to stand for re-election in 1961, Williams appointed him as Trinidad and Tobago's first High Commissioner in London.|$|E

5|$|Livingstone {{sought to}} remove the pigeons from Trafalgar Square; he tried to evict seed sellers and {{introduced}} hawks to scare the pigeons off. He pedestrianised {{the north side of}} the Square, transforming it into a public space with a cafe, public toilets, and a lift for the disabled. He introduced an annual Saint Patrick's Day festival to celebrate the contributions of the Irish to London, and revived London's free anti-racism music festival, now called , later attributing London's 35% decrease in racist attacks to this and other anti-racist policies. Continuing his support for LGBT rights, in 2001 he set up Britain's first register for same-sex couples; while falling short of legal marriage rights, the register was seen <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>step</b> towards the Civil Partnership Act 2004.|$|E
5|$|Public {{opinion was}} sharply divided. Some {{communities}} supported the rebellion {{for a variety}} of reasons. Others, including Gonzales, declared their loyalty to Mexican President Antonio López de Santa Anna's centralist government. Local leaders began calling for a Consultation to determine whether a majority of settlers favored independence, a return to federalism, or the status quo. Although some leaders worried that Mexican officials would see this type of gathering <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>step</b> toward revolution, by the end of August most communities had agreed to send delegates to the Consultation, scheduled for October 15. In the interim, many communities formed militias to protect themselves from a potential attack by military forces.|$|E
5|$|With the {{creation}} of the National League System by the Football Association the league was officially defined <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>Step</b> 5 league. The champions of the Midland Combination, West Midlands (Regional) League and Leicestershire Senior League continued to gain promotion to the Alliance, although in 2008 the new East Midlands Counties Football League was formed at the Step 6 level and it was anticipated that successful teams from the Leicestershire Senior League, which is officially a Step 7 league, would now move up to the new league and that the champions of the new league would in turn move up to the Alliance if they fell within its coverage area.|$|E

5|$|In {{the early}} part of his term, Crittenden was {{concerned}} with quelling the violence in Kansas Territory. An opponent of the Kansas–Nebraska Act of 1854, Crittenden also opposed repealing the Missouri Compromise unless the North agreed to substitute popular sovereignty for the exclusion of slavery north of the 36°30' line. In early 1856, he proposed sending General Winfield Scott to the Kansas Territory to ensure that fair elections were held there, but the proposal was blocked by the Pierce administration. He did not agree with all of the act proposed by Robert Toombs to allow for a constitutional convention in Kansas Territory, but he supported it <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>step</b> to bring peace there. He regarded the ratifications of both the Topeka Constitution and the Lecompton Constitution as invalid, and made one of the most highly regarded speeches of his career in opposition to the latter. His substitute bill that would have resubmitted the Lecompton Constitution to Kansas for another ratification vote was supported by Republicans, but it was ultimately defeated. So great was Crittenden's influence after his actions on the Kansas question that Abraham Lincoln felt that Crittenden's endorsement of Stephen Douglas cost Lincoln the Illinois senatorial election in 1858.|$|E
