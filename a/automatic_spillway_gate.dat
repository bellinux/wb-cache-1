The gates must go down for the design flood which currently is the PMF. The <b>spillway</b> has 13 <b>automatic</b> <b>gates,</b> each 64 feet, wide in the configuration shown in Fig. 1. NSP conducted field tests on Gate 1 at the south end of the spillway on April 15, 1988, in which the gate was pulled down to 7. 2 ft. It was not possible to test the prototype gates from 7. 2 ft down to the fully lowered position of 10. 8 ft. During the tests, pulldown forces, piezometric pressures, and water surface profiles were measured. The results of the field tests down to 7. 2 ft were correlated with a physical hydraulic model at the St. Anthony Falls Hydraulic Laboratory. These studies are summarized in a previous project report* by the Laboratory. As reported in these studies, good correlation was observed between the field tests and the model tests. The model studies were expanded to include gate positions down to 10. 8 ft (the full-down position of the gate), and the results were extrapolated to the prototype. It was concluded from the calculated gate hinge moments that the gates would probably not remain in the full-down position at the higher discharges without additional force being applied.

The gates are called "stauwerke" gates. The main {{purpose of the study}} is to assure that the <b>automatic</b> <b>spillway</b> <b>gates</b> operate properly during a probable-maximum-flood (PMF) as required by the Federal Energy Re&ulatory Commission (FERC) and the Department of Natural Resources (DNR). The position of the gates must be controllable {{so that they can be}} fully lowered or raised with Lake Wissota at its normal elevation of 898. 0 ft. The gates must also be fully open during a PMF. The <b>spillway</b> has 13 <b>automatic</b> <b>gates</b> each 64 feet wide in the configuration shown in Fig. 1. Figure 2 shows a photo of the prototype <b>spillway</b> with <b>gate</b> 1 starting at the south abutment on the right. Each gate is connected to a 144. 5 ton counterweight through linkages and arms as shown in Fig. 3. Records of openings and closings from 1982 to 1985 show that the gates have operated automatically. Gates 2 through 13 open when the lake elevation is about 0. 6 ft above the normal elevation of 898 ft and close when the elevation drops about 0. 5 ft below normal. Gate 1 is controlled by a chain hoist and can be pulled down to about 6 ft and used to somewhat control the lake elevation. When the gates open automatically, they open a distance of 3. 1 to 3. 6 feet. The maximum opening of the gates was 6 feet in the 1941 flood. The 13 gates were expected to be capable of passing 263, 000 cfs. With the PMF of 363, 000 cfs, other means have to be provided to pass the extra 100, 000 cfs. Therefore, the questions are whether or not the gates will operate properly, and if the anticipated flow can be passed. Presently, in the fully lowered position the gates will be 10 feet below pool El. 898 ft. By removing curbs around the gate arm openings, the gates would be horizontal and thus down 10. 83 feet. It is not possible to test the prototype gates in the fully lowered position. Therefore, NSP proposed to run field tests on Gate 1 of the Wissota Dam spillway, correlate the results with a physical hydraulic model at the St. Anthony Falls Hydraulic Laboratory, and expand the model studies to test conditions not possible in the prototype.

40|$|Safety {{inspection}} of large dams in Taiwan is conducted every 5 years. The practice {{does not take}} into consideration uncertainty of dam conditions. The goal {{of this study is to}} determine the optimal dam inspection interval under the consideration of overtopping risk incorporating uncertainty gate availability. In earlier studies, assessment of overtopping risk only considered the uncertainties in reservoir properties and natural randomness of hydrologic events without giving much thought to the availability of <b>spillway</b> <b>gates.</b> As a result, the overtopping risk could be underestimated. In this study, an innovative concept is proposed to evaluate dam overtopping by taking into account <b>spillway</b> <b>gate</b> availability. The framework consists of three parts: (1) evaluation of conditional overtopping risk for different numbers of malfunctioning spillway gates; (2) evaluation of <b>spillway</b> <b>gate</b> availability; and (3) dam inspection scheduling. Furthermore, considerations are given to overtopping risk, inspection cost, and dam break cost for determining the optimal inspection schedule. The methodology is applied to the Shihmen Reservoir in Taiwan and to evaluate its time-dependent overtopping risk. Results show that overtopping risk considering the availability of the <b>spillway</b> <b>gates</b> is higher than the one without considering the availability of the <b>spillway</b> <b>gates...</b>|$|R

A considerable need exists for reliable emergency dewatering systems to prevent these consequences. Stop logs are {{the most commonly used}} dewatering system for <b>spillway</b> <b>gates</b> but are typically designed for maintenance purposes only. They have been found in most cases to be unreliable for emergency closure under flowing conditions. Considering the economic advantages a dewatering system would provide were it functional for the dual purposes of maintenance as well as emergency closure, a new stop log design was developed. This study assesses the design that enables deployment under no-flow conditions as well as flowing, or emergency conditions. The information found in this study provides dam owners, operators, and engineers with options to reduce damages resulting from uncontrolled releases owing to partial or complete failure of <b>spillway</b> <b>gates,</b> including the failure of gates to close after having been raised.

40|$|<b>Gated</b> <b>spillways</b> {{are often}} {{necessary}} to provide both operational flexibility and discharge capacity to pass large flood events. However, <b>gated</b> <b>spillways</b> present operational challenges to dam owners and operators, often necessitating development of a flood operations plan (FOP) that is used {{in tandem with the}} dam’s emergency action plan (EAP). Even a well-intentioned and robust FOP/EAP can require personnel to predict flooding, use judgment particular to the requirements of the plan, and react quickly. In addition, all of the equipment required to operate the gates need to function as designed and be operated in accordance with the FOP. This paper presents a framework for evaluating the risks related to gate operations during floods, considering operations in accordance with the FOP, as well as operations that deviate from the FOP/EAP due to operator (human) error or system (mechanical/electrical/structural) malfunction. Case studies are presented to evaluate the downstream impacts of gate operations (or misoperation) for a range of flood events. A basis for quantitative evaluation of risks is included. Considerations for improving operation plans and replacement of <b>spillway</b> <b>gates</b> with more reliable passive systems are presented in the context of risk framework.

In this paper we provide some examples of <b>spillway</b> <b>gate</b> failures worldwide. These examples illustrate that the root causes are quite widely spread throughout the technical and organizational aspects of gate systems; thus indicating the need for assessing the reliability of all aspects of the gate system to fully identify potential problems. To understand the relative importance of <b>spillway</b> <b>gate</b> reliability for flood operation at an individual reservoir, this assessment should be done {{in the context of an}} overall dam safety risk assessment, which considers the relevant site specific characteristics of the project. The results from preliminary gate reliability assessments and risk assessments of five U. S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) Huntington District dams are summarized. The USACE approach to ensuring gate reliability at these flood control projects is contrasted with the approach used at some European projects. In the former case large flood storage capacity and USACE resources are counted on to provide sufficient time and capability for effective intervention if gate system failure occurs. In contrast, the European projects operate without large flood storage capacity and therefore with little time for intervention. Thus redundancy is used in critical design areas to achieve reliability and operational measures, such as testing and diagnostic procedures, spares holdings, and emergency exercises, are used to improve reliability...|$|R
