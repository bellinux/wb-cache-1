2500|$|Angular [...] Correlation of Electron Positron Annihilation Radiation (ACAR or ACPAR) is a {{technique}} of solid state physics to investigate the electronic structure of metals. It uses positrons which are implanted into a sample and annihilate with the electrons. In the majority of annihilation events, two gamma quanta are created that are, in the reference frame of the electron-positron pair, emitted in exactly opposite directions. In the laboratory frame, {{there is a small}} angular deviation from collinearity, which is caused by the momentum of the electron. Hence, measuring the <b>angular</b> <b>correlation</b> of the annihilation radiation yields information about the momentum distribution of the electrons in the solid.|$|E
