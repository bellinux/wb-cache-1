5|$|The scrimmages were {{something}} awful to witnessliving, kicking, scrambling masses of humanity surging to and fro, each individual after the leather oval.

5|$|I {{remained}} on the wreck until she went down; the suction took me down some way, and a man got hold of my leg, but I managed to kick him off and came up and struck out for some pieces of wood {{that were on the}} water <b>and</b> <b>started</b> <b>for</b> land, about two miles off. I was in the water about five hours, as the shore was so rocky and the surf ran so high that a great many were lost trying to land. Nearly all those that took to the water without their clothes on were taken by sharks; hundreds of them were all round us, and I saw men taken by them close to me, but as I was dressed (having on a flannel shirt and trousers) they preferred the others. I was not in the least hurt, and am happy to say, kept my head clear; most of the officers lost their lives from losing their presence of mind and trying to take money with them, and from not throwing off their coats. - Letter from Lieutenant J.F. Girardot, 43rd Light Infantry, to his father, 1 March 1852.|$|E
5|$|In 2012, Ishikawa {{signed with}} the Milwaukee Brewers, who used him mainly as a pinch-hitter and {{defensive}} replacement. Ishikawa spent most of 2013 in the minor leagues, though he played six games for the Baltimore Orioles and one game for the New York Yankees. In 2014, he made the Pittsburgh Pirates Opening Day roster. However his bat wasn't as hot as it was during Spring Training so the Pirates traded for 1B Ike Davis from the New York Mets and Ishikawa was designated for assignment. He was re-signed by his former team the San Francisco Giants in April <b>and</b> <b>started</b> <b>for</b> them in left field during the 2014 playoffs. On October 16, 2014, Ishikawa hit a walk-off three-run home run to give the Giants their third National League pennant in five years by defeating the St. Louis Cardinals.|$|E

Wintering in Campania, he withdrew to Apulia in 279BC, where, pursued by the Romans, he won a second costly victory at the Battle of Asculum.
