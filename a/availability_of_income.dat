50|$|Income {{and level}} of {{education}} influence food choice via {{the availability of the}} resources to purchase a higher quality food and awareness of nutritious alternatives. Diet may vary depending on the <b>availability</b> <b>of</b> <b>income</b> to purchase more healthier, nutrient-rich foods. For a low-income family, pricing plays a larger role than taste and quality in whether the food will be purchased. This may partly explain the lower life expectancy of lower-income groups. Similarly, higher levels of education equate to higher expectations from functional foods and avoidance of food additives. Compared to conventional foods, organic foods have a higher cost and people may have limited access if generating a low income. The variety of foods carried in neighborhood stores may also influence diet ("food deserts").|$|E

Influencing factors of attitude and strategies of households were analyzed using a logit model technique. The analysis indicated that household&# 39;s income level, environmental knowledge of the program, and program implementation were significant influencing factors in a household&# 39;s attitude toward the CCFG, while major influencing factors of household strategies were their regional background and <b>availability</b> <b>of</b> <b>income</b> generation sources.

They hold partially after controlling for educational attainment (though the estimate for the PM 10 × female × children interaction is non-significant, it is negative and at the border of statistical significance with an estimated p-value of 0.062). Results do not hold for income (Additional file  1 : Table S 3). The fact {{that they do not}} hold for income or educational attainment may signal an important interaction with paid caregivers. If higher educational attainment and higher income make a household more {{likely to be able to}} pay for a caregiver (as is the case with the employment of domestic workers in Chile), the constraining factor of children’s illness in a woman’s ability to work may disappear in households able to pay for this work.

40|$|AIDS mortality, its {{linkages}} as a determinant and {{consequence of}} food security {{and its impact}} on natural resource utilisation by mainly rural populations, has not been well researched, especially their effects on rural livelihoods. With the high epidemic prevalence and persistent food insecurity, natural resources are and will continue to play a key role as a buffer against stresses and shocks in rural livelihoods. Determining linkages between household food security, adult AIDS mortality, and how these affect natural resource utilisation at the village level was the objective of this research. The overarching goal of sustainable natural resource utilisation in Agincourt Demographic Surveillance Site (DSS) was determined through three research questions outlined as follows; What is the status of food security, AIDS mortality and Natural resource utilisation in Agincourt?; What is the relationship between dependence on natural resources as a source of food and or livelihood to resource degradation?; and What are the household and community drivers of household food security? Statistical analysis was used to evaluate the prevalence of food insecurity and the reliance on natural resources while remote sensing was used to assess resource availability and identification of possible natural resource degradation hotspots. More than half of the population in the DSS is food-secure, in 2004, with an even smaller hungry population in 2007. HIV/AIDS and non-HIV/AIDS adult mortality, analysed at village level are underlying drivers and determinants, affecting <b>availability</b> <b>of</b> <b>income</b> which is a direct driver of food insecurity. <b>Availability</b> <b>of</b> <b>income,</b> through social grants, remittances or wages, and delay or non-receipt of this income results in food insecurity in some households. Food production, affected and constrained by climate variability, is a less stable and less popular means of attaining food. More than half of the Agincourt population utilises natural resources to supplement dietary diversity and household income, although there is a significant reduction in households using natural resources in 2007 compared to 2004. Resource degradation is noted in the village commons especially between the highly food-insecure villages and are identified as environmental degradation hot spots. The identification of synergies among these factors in policy design and for interventions is essential for poverty alleviation, improved health and sustainable utilisation of natural resources and rural livelihoods. Glory be to GOD for making this work possible “Commit your work to the Lord and then your plans will succeed” (Proverbs 16 : 3) “Material poverty doesn‟t necessarily lead to a lack of capacity for creativeness and Inventiveness.

This paper uses a panel data set from Russia, an economy in which household debt has grown at an astounding rate, to examine the importance of financial literacy {{and its effects on}} behavior. The paper studies both the financial and real consequences of financial illiteracy. Even though consumer borrowing increased very rapidly in Russia, only 41 % of respondents demonstrate an understanding of interest compounding and only 46 % can answer a simple question about inflation. Financial literacy is positively related to participation in financial markets and negatively related to the use of informal sources of borrowing. Moreover, individuals with higher financial literacy are significantly less likely to report experiencing a negative income shock during 2009 and have greater <b>availability</b> <b>of</b> unspent <b>income</b> and higher spending capacity.

40|$|The {{agricultural}} risk {{environment in}} Europe is changing, for example because of WTO agreements and governments increasingly withdrawing from disaster assistance {{in case of}} catastrophic events. In this context, some form of income insurance may be a useful risk management tool for farmers. Insuring farmers' incomes, however, is rather problematical for reasons of asymmetric information and high correlation of the risks amongst the would-be insured, for example risks due to price fluctuations, floods, droughts and livestock epidemics. It is concluded that the most aggregated forms of income insurance {{that are likely to}} be feasible include revenue insurance for field crops, especially if there are relevant futures markets and area yield data, and business interruption insurance for livestock commodities. In Europe, only a few such schemes currendy exist; some are purely private, others are subsidised. A somewhat larger involvement of the public sector, for example through public-private partnerships for reinsurance, could extend the <b>availability</b> <b>of</b> <b>income</b> insurance schemes throughout Europe.

30|$|The second {{feature of}} {{unemployment}} {{which is important}} for the design of the UI program in developing countries is the fact that in these countries, members of poor households may be less than proportionally represented in the ranks of the unemployed (Cox Edwards and Manning 2001). For example, in Peru and Brazil, the poor show disproportionately less unemployment than the rich; while the pattern is reversed in Mexico and Uruguay, unemployment is still heavily represented among richer quintiles (de Ferranti et al. 2000). Moreover, in the Philippines in 1997, only 12.1 percent of households whose heads were unemployed were poor, in comparison to a 25 percent poverty incidence in general (Esguerra et al. 2001). Although the same group of households whose heads were unemployed represented 12.7 percent of the total population, its contribution to the total number of poor persons was only 6.1 percent. Similarly, in Sri Lanka unemployment has been closely related to the status in the household and the <b>availability</b> <b>of</b> <b>income</b> support from relatives, both critical factors for allowing extended periods of job search (Word Bank 1999). Therefore, it seems that in low income countries, members of poorer households cannot afford to stay unemployed for a prolonged period of time. They try to cushion the loss of earnings by opting for low productivity jobs (mostly in the informal sector) instead of not working at all while they continue to search for more adequate, better paid jobs.|$|E
40|$|The {{distribution}} of economic wellbeing is {{generally regarded as}} one of the key performance indicators of a society and economic wellbeing is strongly influenced by income, wealth and consumption. Despite this, almost all studies of inequality in Australia have relied upon income as the sole measure of economic wellbeing, due in large part to the ready <b>availability</b> <b>of</b> <b>income</b> data. This thesis attempts to redress that deficiency. This thesis provides an insight into an under-researched but vitally important topic - the {{distribution of}} wealth. Specifically the research has three goals. The first is to provide estimates of the level and distribution of wealth in Australia at the current time and the trends over the past decade or two. The second aim is to provide projections of the future wealth distribution. The final goal is to see if there are significant differences between the distribution of lifetime wealth and the annual cross-sectional distribution of wealth. The research uses a technique not previously used in Australia to estimate wealth in the future - dynamic microsimulation. The microsimulation model used is based on a starting sample of 150, 000 individuals and this large number allows a large range of experiences to be modelled, while not having the high costs, years of commitment and other problems associated with undertaking panel studies. This thesis estimates that the average levels of wealth will increase significantly over the 40 -year period from 2000 to 2040 but that wealth inequality will increase over the same period. The reasons for the increases in wealth inequality appear to be due to changes in asset ownership, particularly lower levels of home ownership; the ageing population; and increases in inequality within age cohorts. The research found that lifetime wealth inequality for a sub-group of Generation X differed from the distribution based on annual data.

40|$|This {{study was}} carried out to {{investigate}} {{the influence of the}} new national land policy on the customary tenure system and assess changes in the socio-cultural and economic conditions of matrilineal social system in the Community Based Rural Land Development Project (CBRLDP) in southern Malawi. Specifically it assessed what the new Malawi's land policy stipulates and what is actually practised on the ground regarding inheritance and intra-household resource allocation; identified whether land ownership security influenced household head's incentives to undertake long- term investment on land in support of livelihoods; and assessed changes in the socio-economic situation of beneficiary groups after resettlement and how they were affected by the changes. Mixed methods approach was employed in which both qualitative and quantative data were collected through focus group discussions and a household survey. A checklist and semi-structured interviews were used in focus groups and household survey respectively to collect data. Interviews in focus groups were digitally recorded and transcribed into Word files. Content analysis was employed to analyse qualitative data. Logit regression analysis was used to determine factors that influenced household head's incentive to invest in long-term agricultural enterprise. The study found that in the transitional period (the period between land acquisition and when the land will be transferred to the first generation of daughters) perceptions determine land rights in favour of men. This is because the acquired land is treated as a personal property. However, after the land is passed on to the first generation of female heirs, the acquired land will feed into matrilineal wealth and hence matrilineal rules of inheritance will take over. The study also revealed that land ownership security after resettlement influenced men in this matrilineal social system to invest on land, and that the <b>availability</b> <b>of</b> <b>income</b> from other economic activities enabled them to do so. Women, on the other hand, were not affected by land ownership security because of labour and financial constraints. The study found that when a network of kin from which resettlers receive support is not available, re settlers adapt by seeking help from the next close social grouping that they can identify with. However, this leads to modification ~f traditions. Lastly, the study identified that even though maize production improved after resettlement, lack of alternative income earning activities in the new home led to the overselling of maize to generate income, thereby reducing household food security.

40|$|The {{necessity}} to improve dairy {{production in the}} less developed countries (LDCs) exists, and the Government of Kenya has recognised this as evidenced by its efforts in restructuring the dairy sector. The sector contributes substantially to the country’s gross domestic product (GDP). Studies have shown that with the restructure, smallholder farmers stand to benefit from dairy more than from other farming enterprises. However spatial differences in the rates of adoption of dairy technologies, {{in the face of}} the available opportunities, in part reflect the existence of impediments to dairy development in some parts of the country. Western Kenya, one of the country’s poorest areas, has shown low milk production levels, yet it has a high potential for dairy, hence the need to analyse factors contributing to the low production levels in the area. The study area consisted of seven districts: Bungoma, Kakamega, Vihiga, Nandi, Kisii, Rachuonyo, and Nyamira. Descriptive statistics and discrete choice were the methods used for analysis. The latter involved the binary choice probit model and conjoint (CJ) analysis. Two cross-sectional data sets were used. The first set of 1575 households across all the seven districts, was used to describe the area, and analyse the cause-effect relationships in the adoption of dairy technologies. The second data set of 630 households from four of the seven districts was used for valuation of cow attributes during the CJ valuation method. The Consumer theory was used in the theoretical framework of the study. Results of the descriptive analysis showed spatial variations in the following variables; proximity to urban areas, ethnicity, resource endowments among the male and female-headed households, priorities of the household head, disease prevalence, and adoption rates of dairy technologies. Results from the cause-effect analysis in the adoption of dairy technologies show various factors that influence adoption of dairy technologies. Apart from the land economic potential which is a main determinant in adoption, other factors were availability of extension, <b>availability</b> <b>of</b> <b>income,</b> land size, ethnicity, population density, experience of the household head with dairy technologies, cultural factors and gender. Milk yield was the most important attribute, followed by feed requirement and disease resistance. That household characteristics condition valuation of cow attributes was quite evident. Education, extension, off-farm income, ethnic factor, and households that preferred the Zebu for cultural purposes were critical determinants during the valuation. This causes variations in adoption rates and inefficiencies in the use of local resources. Policy interventions should be based on the fact that local resources should be mobilised to exploit the opportunities available to develop the dairy sector. More information is needed to reverse people’s attitude towards dairy, and extension services should give more information on feed resources and address the cultural practices that inhibit adoption of improved dairy technologies. Women should be supported because they showed a high potential to develop dairy. Department for International Development, United Kingdo...|$|E
40|$|Diversifying crops {{for food}} and trade Suggested introduction: Across the Caribbean {{it is clear that}} {{agriculture}} needs to diversify. The loss of preferences in EU markets, for example, threatens the economic viability of traditional export crops such as sugar and bananas, and if farmers are to survive they will need to change what they grow, and how they grow it. So what are the options? One basic question is whether countries that traditionally import most of their food should be looking to increase the amount and variety of food crops grown on their own soil. Or should they simply grow other cash crops with strong export potential and sell these to fund continuing food imports? It?s a question that came under discussion at a recent conference focussing on food and nutrition security held in Belize. Susanna Thorp spoke to several participants about their vision of the future of agricultural diversity and trade, and how these link to the nutrition and food security of Caribbean people. In this report she begins by asking extension agent and agronomist, Richard Allport, about the situation regarding food, nutrition and trade, in his home country of Dominica. IN:		?Generally Dominica has always been considered [...] ? OUT:		? themselves as well as trade internationally. ? DUR?N		 8 ? 58 ? Back announcement: Sandra Plummer of the FAO ending that report on the links between crop diversification, income generation and supply of food in the Caribbean. Transcript Allport	Generally Dominica has always been considered as a food secure nation in terms of its food balance. Generally we have exported more food than we have imported in terms of value. However {{over the last few years}} we have seen some deterioration in the food and nutrition situation because we have seen some declines in the economy. Thorp	So why in particular has there been an impact on the economy, why has that been declining in the last couple of years? Allport	I think the major reason has been the decline of the banana industry and the whole question of the WTO negotiations and the impact on our economy. We now have a very open economy and many times we have been flooded with cheaper imports. That has caused a decline in incomes to farmers and as a result it has caused us to have less disposable income. Thorp	So what are you trying to do as an extension department to try and support farmers in this serious situation? Allport	The most effect that we can have is to try to raise productivity among farmers so that they can increase incomes. But we also would like our production to be consumed locally and many times we bring up issues of protection. Under our WTO obligations we cannot protect but there still is a reason why we need to protect our farmers. Furthermore I think that if our farmers are not protected it means that our country?s ability to even purchase from outside in the long run is affected. So if the economy is totally destroyed our ability to import is also destroyed or compromised. Thorp	And what about trying to diversify? If farmers have relied heavily on growing bananas in the past but this is not going to be a viable option in the future, what other options for growing other crops, perhaps more nutritional crops are there? Allport	Well the options are always there in terms of diversifying to feed our population. That is why I consider us still food secure. But then our ability to export agricultural produce is always compromised. So I think that is where the resources have to be put. Do we really have a comparative advantage in terms of exporting to other countries out there? So I think those are the real issues, it is not just the ability to feed ourselves but can we diversify into other crops that we can export like we did bananas for so many years. Thorp	And what about the issues of raising productivity, I mean how feasible is it to raise productivity beyond what you are doing already? Allport	I think it is feasible. We really have to embrace science and technology. But sometimes - even under our WTO obligations - raising productivity requires infrastructure and sometimes people see the required infrastructure as subsidies and they ask us not to subsidise. When the developed world?s agriculture is highly subsidised both in the EU and in the US. So those are other concerns of ours. Thorp	What about with policymakers, do you feel that they are doing enough to resolve the situation? Allport	I think our policymakers see it, but I think many times our hands are tied in terms of the kind of resources that we can generate to make those changes. I mean we are a poor underdeveloped country striving to compete in the developed world. NARR	In St Kitts and Nevis the government is already in the process of planning which crops it should prioritise, as it reduces its dependence on sugar exports. Jeffrey Berry, an extension officer with the Department of Agriculture, is concerned that this process is ignoring the capacity that the country?s own farmers have, to contribute to the national food supplies. Berry	Yes we have to feed a nation, but are the people, the population, the farmers benefiting from feeding ourselves? Thorp		Presumably they are not? Berry	They are not because what is really happening is that when we set out to look what crops should we produce we are looking from a marketing point of view as to what crops can we produce competitively, not necessarily to feed our nation. So I think somewhere along the line we have to draw the line and to break a kind of equilibrium as to production first of all in feeding yourself, feeding up to at least certain basic commodities. Thorp	Is there a possibility of being able to diversify so that farmers can grow some competitive crops but they can also be encouraged to grow nutritionally valuable crops too? Berry	That is the approach we are trying to do because St Kitts is moving out of sugar right now. I think this year is the last year that we are producing sugar for export. So we are looking at a diversification programme. And I think this is the downfall of the whole thing: we are going about it kind of one sided in the sense that we are just looking at it from a marketing point of view as to what kinds of crops we can produce competitively. I think we have to look at producing other crops that are nutritionally beneficial for the nation, on a smaller scale, but I think that is an integral part that we have to look at apart from the crops that we are producing to be competitive. NARR	While Jeffrey Berry stresses the importance of farmers growing at least some of their crops for domestic consumption, the UN Food and Agriculture Organisation is currently running a pilot project to support farmers in production of some alternative cash crops. Sandra Plummer, a food security specialist with the project, which is operating in the 15 member states of CARICOM plus the Dominican Republic, explained how it is working. Plummer	You know that we have a lot of problems in terms of especially sugar and banana because of the erosion of the preferences with the European Union. I think countries are now in transition, in terms of where they should go where they would not be so dependent upon those preferences. Thorp	So what is the FAO pilot project doing to support farmers in this transition phase? Plummer	The project actually is attempting to improve the productivity of these selected crops and it is basically cash crops with the potential for trade in what we call the non-traditional commodities which find markets in places like Canada, the United States. Especially in those areas where you have the West Indian diaspora who are accustomed to eating a particular type of food and they are willing to buy it. So there is a kind of niche market there. Thorp	So what sort of interventions or technologies are you putting into place in order to support the growing of those crops? Plummer	The technology that is being used is drip irrigation because in many countries they have a problem of water and the management of the water. Thorp	So with having irrigation does this allow farmers to grow crops outside the traditional seasons? Plummer	That is exactly the whole point because what happens is that I can give you an example of one village in a country where everybody grew the same kind of crop. So you had a glut during the actual reaping season and then between seasons you had a deficit in terms of availability of food as well as <b>availability</b> <b>of</b> <b>income.</b> So the drip irrigation actually helps to stagger the production throughout the year so that the troughs and the heights of the cycle will actually be reduced. So you get little blips instead of huge hills and valleys. Thorp	So are there countries where there are particular lessons that would be valuable do you think that are already coming out of the project? Plummer	The country which has gone the furthest and has actually started to reap the first crop cycle is Belize. And I think Belize has the advantage and it is probably the reason why they were one of the first countries to actually start the production, in that they already have an intersectoral Animal Health and Food Safety Agency which co-ordinates all the requirements from the Ministries of Health and Agriculture and Trade. And hence it makes it easier for persons who are wishing to export crops. They do not need to go to eight different departments. They can go to one agency and get all the paperwork and documentation done. Thorp		So how do you see the way forward for the future? Plummer	I think in terms of regional development, as in Caribbean region, we hope to get a framework of food and nutrition security strategy for the region, which would then be able to advise programmes and plans of action of the different CARICOM and CARIFORUM member states. I think part of the process is the establishment of, for example, regional databases, regional marketing intelligence, so countries can all access it and be able to trade amongst themselves as well as trade internationally.

The paper finds that a greater targeting of superannuation tax concessions towards middle and lower income earners would make the system more equitable and achieve other desirable goals such as increasing voluntary savings. Furthermore, the available evidence suggests that the current mandatory contributions rate of 9...|$|R
40|$|This is {{the first}} {{regional}} study of artisanal fisheries in Pacific Island countries and territories that demonstrated {{that the future of}} the region's artisanal fishery sector and the livelihood of coastal communities will be highly dependent on alternative subsistence and income sources, which are necessary to reduce fishing pressure to a sustainable level to maintain ecosystem services and food security. The overall objective {{of this study was to}} identify socio-economic indicators and drivers to improve the understanding of the dynamics between socio-economic conditions and current exploitation levels of finfish and invertebrates of coastal communities in 17 Pacific Island countries and territories. We showed that exploitation rates and thus possible overexploitation are not solely the consequence of a simple demographic growth process but are in fact a result of the choices people have. Our results confirmed a close relationship between resource exploitation rates and economic development at the national level and the <b>availability</b> <b>of</b> alternative <b>income</b> opportunities at the community level. Multivariate analysis results suggest that communities in countries with somewhat unfavourable conditions and limited access to alternatives and fishing households in communities with overall favourable economic conditions are at highest vulnerability as they have the highest dependence on coastal fisheries resources. Alternative economic opportunities at the national scale and <b>availability</b> <b>of</b> alternative <b>income</b> at the community level vary significantly between cultural groups. Based on our results, the development of management strategies with realistic expectations of ensuring livelihood of coastal communities and sustainable resource use in Pacific Island countries and territories requires a hierarchical and integral approach. Major drivers identified at the regional, cultural and local levels should be used to identify priorities, to assess overall advantages and limitations at the different levels as well as the vulnerability of communities targeted, and to develop strategies accordingly.

40|$|Smallholder farming {{households}} {{in most of}} the developing countries, live in environments that are characterized by substantial risk. They consequently develop a range of risk management strategies. However, analyzing household consumption smoothing behaviour requires the <b>availability</b> <b>of</b> both <b>income</b> and consumption data. Since household income data are usually unavailable in many developing countries, including Malawi, this paper develops an asset-based framework to analyze consumption smoothing behaviour at household and community levels using a two-period panel dataset on 259 rural {{households in}} Malawi. The results show that while consumption smoothing takes place at the household level, it is not perfect. Food consumption is protected more than non-food consumption. Risk sharing also takes place at the community level. The major policy implication is that social protection programmes should promote household asset accumulation to enable rural households manage livelihood risks better. ...|$|R
40|$|Social {{policy in}} the United States is {{inconsistent}} in its treatment of cohabiting-parent households. For example, although welfare policy generally assumes that marital status should not affect {{the extent to which}} children benefit from each adult's income, tax policy and the poverty classification assume income pooling among married but not cohabiting parents. Neither assumption has been adequately tested against actual household economic behavior. I use data on couples' money management and expense division from the Fragile Families and Child Wellbeing Study to examine household <b>availability</b> <b>of</b> cohabiting fathers' <b>income.</b> Although their mechanisms for combining income differ, the results suggest that cohabiting parents do generally pool resources, so the <b>income</b> <b>of</b> both parents should be considered in setting family policy...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{examines}} money {{attitudes and}} associated retirement issues of academics {{in higher education}} in Malaysia. Systematic random sampling was used in selecting the target respondents. A questionnaire was personally administered on 458 academics in 16 universities in Malaysia. The survey found that academics exhibited positive attitudes toward money, and income {{appears to be the}} prime motivator. Consistent with the findings of prior studies, position, age and educational levels were strong indicators of an academic's annual income. The survey found that female academics and those from public universities had more positive attitudes towards retirement. In retirement planning, the respondents considered the <b>availability</b> <b>of</b> other <b>income</b> after retirement the most important factor, while payment for children's education was the key potential conflict area. The findings provide important insights for the top management of higher education of the necessity of pre-retirement counseling and assistance to ease the passage to retirement for academics...|$|R
40|$|The {{economic}} and social importance of administrative borders can be examined {{from the point of}} view of internal homogeneity and external heterogeneity of the delimited spatial units and {{from the point of view}} of the effect on the intensity of spatial interactions. This paper deals with the first question. Hungarian county borders can be treated as sharp limits from the administrative point of view. However, choropleth maps with county borders can suggest that county borders are sharp limits for the social and economic indicators also. It is a conceptually interesting question whether presenting data at county level is justified by the sharp differences of various indicators along the county borders or it is determined only by the <b>availability</b> <b>of</b> data. The aim of this study is to examine empirically the existence or non-existence of the county border effect by the example of spatial distribution <b>of</b> personal <b>incomes</b> in Hungary. The analysis is possible due to the <b>availability</b> <b>of</b> personal <b>income</b> data at the level of more than 3000 Hungarian settlements. The analysis is conducted by the comparison <b>of</b> average personal <b>incomes</b> <b>of</b> settlements ollowing areas: average of own county, average of neighbouring county, average of neighbouring settlements, average of neighbouring settlements in own county, average of neighbouring settlements in neighbouring county. The results show that county borders have effect only in those cases, where the border is determined by a sharp geographical barrier, namely Danube River and Lake Balaton. The settlements are more similar to the close settlements of a neighbouring county than to the average of own county...|$|R

The use of online social networking sites and how this may influence the experience and prevalence of loneliness is also explored. Loneliness is the disconnect felt between desired interpersonal relationships and those that one perceives they currently have. While the subjective nature of this experience makes measuring loneliness difficult, understanding loneliness is important {{for the development of a}} range of social policies. The <b>availability</b> <b>of</b> longitudinal Household <b>Income</b> and Labour Dynamics in Australia (HILDA) Survey data now makes it possible to track loneliness in Australia over the past decade.

40|$|This paper takes income {{distribution}} {{as a case}} study of the role of data in economics. After describing the transformation which has taken place with regard to the <b>availability</b> <b>of</b> data on <b>income</b> inequality, it discusses how the comparability of these estimates is brought into question by differences in methodology that cannot be eliminated by simple adjustments. Recent analyses of the relationships between income inequality and growth or globalisation are shown to be based on time series plagued by discontinuities which can seriously affect regression results. The paper concludes by calling for greater attention to data quality in applied economics. Copyright The Author 2006.

40|$|The {{importance}} <b>of</b> <b>availability</b> <b>of</b> comparable real <b>income</b> aggregates {{and their}} components to applied economic research is {{highlighted by the}} popularity of the Penn World Tables. Any methodology designed to achieve such a task requires the combination of data from several sources. The first is purchasing power parities (PPP) data available from the International Comparisons Project roughly every five years since the 1970 s. The second is national level data on a range of variables that explain the behaviour of the ratio of PPP to market exchange rates. The final source of data is the national accounts publications of different countries which include estimates of gross domestic product and various price deflators. In this paper we present a method to construct a consistent panel <b>of</b> comparable real <b>incomes</b> by specifying the problem in state-space form.

40|$|Given the {{increased}} <b>availability</b> <b>of</b> survey <b>income</b> data, {{in this paper}} we analyse {{the pros and cons of}} alternative data sets for static tax-benefit microsimulation in Italy. We focus on all possible alternatives, namely using (a) SHIW or (b) IT-SILC data using a consistent net-togross microsimulation model, or (c) IT-SILC data using the gross incomes provided since 2007. Our results suggest that IT-SILC improves in the regional representativeness of the Italian population and does not perform worse than SHIW as for most demographic characteristics, SHIW provides more information regarding building and real estate incomes. Gross income variables simulated by using the net-to-gross module included in the TABEITA microsimulation model and calibrating for tax evasion provide a very precise fit with external statistics. Simulated IT-SILC gross income data fit external aggregate data even better than gross income data provided in IT-SILC, which tend to largely overestimate self-employment income. Finally, we suggest to match IT-SILC with SHIW to include in the former the information on building and real estate incomes that are contained only in the latter. This allows us to reach a very satisfactory validation of the final data set...|$|R
40|$|Abstract only. Small-scale {{aquaculture}} {{is fundamental}} to the livelihoods {{of many of the}} rural poor in Asia and Africa. There is growing evidence that in many cases the poorer people have the greater dependence on aquatic resources, particularly low-value fish and non-fish aquatic resources. However, in spite of the benefits, the potential of aquaculture for rural development and food security is often overlooked by national authorities and international development agencies. The reasons include its often informal, small-scale nature and part-time activity. Limited <b>availability</b> <b>of</b> production, <b>income</b> and employment data exacerbate this underestimation. Taking examples from Bangladesh and Malawi, this paper examines the impact of aquaculture development on food security from the standpoint of its impact on employment, income and household consumption and nutrition. The analysis shows a positive impact of aquaculture development on employment, income and consumption. The paper concludes that it will pay-off if national policies in their medium to long-term plans are geared toward increasing the production of fish from aquaculture. Such policies will, however, need to concurrently address the food security and poverty issues more sharply than that has been done at present by increasing institutional and infrastructure support for diversification of production targeted to resource poor households...|$|R
40|$|The {{present study}} investigates the factors {{explaining}} {{the number of}} hours invested in new ventures of female and male entrepreneurs. For new ventures in particular time investment is an important issue, in particular as series of (usually) new and non-recurrent activities is undertaken, laying the foundation of the firm and securing its viability. A distinction is made between factors that influence the number of working hours through preferences or productivity. To test for influences on allocation and the productivity of work time a nonlinear model is proposed that is tested using data of 1256 Dutch business owners (919 male and 337 female) who started a business in 1994. Findings indicate that time invested in the business is determined by various aspects of human, financial and social capital, <b>availability</b> <b>of</b> other <b>income,</b> outsourcing activities and gender. It is shown that some of the identified factors relate to preferences and others to productivity. Women appear to invest less time in the business than men, which is due to an on average lower productivity of work time. This lower productivity can - in turn - be attributed to lower amounts of human, socialm and financial capital of female entrepreneurs, as well as specific ambitions or goals, not directly related to economic performance. ...|$|R
