50|$|To {{the east}} {{is the city}} of Ain al-Touta and the peak at 2176 meters called: Rifaa. The city celebrates the apricot festival on 19 June each year. It is famous for making <b>apricot</b> <b>juice.</b>|$|E
5|$|The area is {{also home}} to many desserts, ranging from those made {{regularly}} and those that are commonly reserved for the holidays. Most Palestinian sweets are pastries filled with either sweetened cheeses, dates or various nuts such as almonds, walnuts or pistachios. Beverages could also depend on holidays such as during Ramadan, where carob, tamarind and <b>apricot</b> <b>juices</b> are consumed at sunset. Coffee is consumed throughout the day and liquor is not very prevalent among the population, however, some alcoholic beverages such as arak or beer are consumed by Christians and less conservative Muslims.|$|R
40|$|Liquid {{samples of}} {{clarified}} apple and <b>apricot</b> <b>juices</b> at different productionstages were investigated using visible light micro-Raman spectroscopy {{in order to}} assessits potential in monitoring fruit juice production. As is well-known, pectin plays a strategicrole {{in the production of}} clarified juice and the possibility of using Raman for its detectionduring production was therefore evaluated. The data analysis has enabled the clearidentification of pectin. In particular, Raman spectra of apple juice samples from washedand crushed fruits revealed a peak at 845 cm- 1 (typical of pectin) which disappears in theRaman spectra of depectinised samples. The fructose content was also revealed by thepresence of four peaks at 823 cm- 1, 872 cm- 1, 918 cm- 1 and 975 cm- 1. In the case of apricotjuice, several Raman fingerprints of ÃŽÂ²-carotene at 1008, 1159 and 1520 cm- 1 were alsohighlighted. Present results resulted interesting for the exclusive use of optical methods forthe quantitative determination of the above-mentioned substances in place of thebiochemical assays generally used for this purpose, which are time consuming and requiredifferent chemical reagents for each of them...|$|R

40|$|Background:To achieve optimal colonoscopic examination, the bowel must be {{sufficiently}} cleansed. However, {{none of the}} currently available colonoscopy preparation regimens is safe, efficient, and comfortable. The {{aim of this study}} was to determine whether adding stewed <b>apricot</b> <b>juice</b> to senna increased patient comfort and improved bowel cleansing during colonoscopy preparation. Methods: Outpatients of both genders who were over 18 years old and were referred for elective colonoscopy were randomly allocated to drink stewed <b>apricot</b> <b>juice</b> with senna or senna by itself. The quality of the colon cleansing was evaluated using the Ottawa scale. Patient tolerance and adverse events were evaluated through the completion of a questionnaire. Results: The study included a total of 128 patients in the randomization procedure. A significantly greater cleansing effect was observed using stewed <b>apricot</b> <b>juice</b> plus senna in the right and transverse colon (p = 0. 038, p = 0. 037 respectively). It was also determined that in the stewed <b>apricot</b> <b>juice</b> plus senna group, overall cleansing was superior (p < 0. 001), total colonoscopy (17. 6 min vs. 22. 8 min, p = 0. 048) and cecal intubation (7. 4 min vs. 11. 2 min, p = 0. 042) times were shorter, and the colonoscopy procedure was easier (79. 4 % vs. 49. 2 %, p < 0. 001). No differences were observed between the groups with respect to patient acceptance, compliance, and events. In the stewed <b>apricot</b> <b>juice</b> plus senna group, 91. 2 % of patients stated their willingness to receive the same regimen in the future compared to 80 % of the patients in the senna alone group (p = 0. 037). Conclusion:The addition of natural, stewed <b>apricot</b> <b>juice</b> to senna significantly improves cleansing outcomes without additional adverse effects. Clinical trial registration number isNCT 02665624, and the validity date is 24. 01. 2016...|$|E

40|$|Cyanocuprol is {{markedly}} {{effective in}} tuberculosis, {{and we believe}} that it will play an important part in clinical medicine. It may be used more generally than tuberculin. The amount of the dose is closely related to the reaction and the final results. It should be determined for each patient after a careful examination of his symptoms. The maximum dose of 8. 5 cc. should in no case be exceeded. The shortest interval between injections should be 2 weeks. If the drug is given after a shorter interval, no improvement is observed and the effects are sometimes dangerous. In order to obtain the best results the patient should be placed under conditions of complete physical and mental rest after the injection; this applies even to light cases. Care should also be taken to secure rest for the lesion. During the period of the treatment irritants to the lesion, such as potassium iodide or tuberculin, should be avoided; <b>apricot</b> <b>juice,</b> guaiacol and its derivatives, and iodol are contraindicated. No marked idiosyncrasy has been noted and no accumulative effects have been observed...|$|E
5|$|The main food staples in {{the diet}} of the lower classes {{remained}} rice, pork, and salted fish. Song restaurant and tavern menus are recorded which list entrées for feasts, banquets, festivals, and carnivals. They reveal a diverse and lavish diet for those of the upper class. They could choose {{from a wide variety}} of meats and seafood, including shrimp, geese, duck, mussel, shellfish, fallow deer, hare, partridge, pheasant, francolin, quail, fox, badger, clam, crab, and many others. Dairy products were rare in Chinese cuisine at this time. Beef was rarely consumed since the bull was a valuable draft animal, and dog meat was absent from the diet of the wealthy, although the poor could choose to eat dog meat if necessary (yet it was not part of their regular diet). People also consumed dates, raisins, jujubes, pears, plums, <b>apricots,</b> pear <b>juice,</b> lychee-fruit juice, honey and ginger drinks, pawpaw juice, spices and seasonings of Sichuan pepper, ginger, soy sauce, oil, sesame oil, salt, and vinegar.|$|R
50|$|Goombay Smash is a rum based {{beverage}} in the Bahamas. It {{is traditionally}} {{served in a}} sling or collins glass. The Goombay Smash was created by Emily Cooper, aka Miss Emily, at the Blue Bee Bar in New Plymouth. The original recipe is a secret, but it {{is believed to have}} contained coconut rum, dirty rum, apricot brandy, and pineapple juice. Imitators and variations commonly use rum, coconut and pineapple <b>juice.</b> <b>Apricot</b> liqueur is sometimes used and dark, amber or spiced rums (dirty rums) are preferred. In place of coconut rum, coconut cream can be used. Other variations include Creme de Banana, orange juice and grenadine.|$|R
40|$|The {{objectives}} {{of this study}} were to evaluate the possibility of extracting juice from selected fruits (plum, apricot, grape) using microwaves and gravity, and to characterize this process. The process uses microwaves for hydrodiffusion of juice from the inside to the exterior of fruit material and earth gravity to collect the fruit juice outside the microwave cavity. The extraction kinetics were fitted by a descriptive model and the corresponding parameters were correlated to the operating conditions. Best yields were obtained at optimized microwave power and from frozen fruits respectively 480 ml kg− 1 for plums, 620 ml kg− 1 for grapes, and 550 ml kg− 1 for <b>apricots.</b> The obtained <b>juices</b> were brightly colored, as this method allows inactivation of endogenous enzymes such as polyphenol oxidase prior to fruit grinding. They were perceived as fairly acidic and for plum and grape presented detectable astringency. The present apparatus permitted fast and efficient extraction even from "hard to press" fruits such as plums and apricots, yielding an original, brightly coloured produc...|$|R

40|$|The {{research}} was undertaken {{to determine the}} bacteriostatic effects of the concentrate of Japanese <b>apricot</b> <b>juice</b> (bainiku-ekisu), which is a popular health food in Taiwan and Japan, on Enterococcus faecalis ATCC 29212, Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25923, and Escherichia coli ATCC 25922. The results show that E. faecalis, S. aureus, and E. coli could be killed or inhibited by bainiku-ekisu at concentrations between 1. 0 and 10. 0 [*]mg/mL. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) was 1 [*]mg/mL for all strains, and the minimum bactericidal concentrations (MBCs) were 5, 2. 5, and 2. 5 [*]mg/mL for E. faecalis, S. aureus, and E. coli, respectively. Using the growth rate to calculate the MICs and MBCs, the MICs were 1. 55, 1. 43, and 0. 97 [*]mg/mL, and the MBCs were 2. 59, 2. 63, and 2. 25 [*]mg/mL for E. faecalis, S. aureus, and E. coli, respectively. According to the D values, E. faecalis and S. aureus exhibited lower resistance than E. coli at lower bainiku-ekisu concentrations (1. 0 and 2. 5 [*]mg/mL), and the resistance of these two pathogens was better than that of E. coli at higher bainiku-ekisu concentrations (5. 0 and 10. 0 [*]mg/mL). The Z values of the E. faecalis, S. aureus, and E. coli strains were 3. 47, 4. 93, and 11. 62 [*]mg/mL, respectively...|$|E

This study was developed to investigate the anti-inflammatory effects of a commercial product (Nopalea™) containing Prickly Pear Cactus Fruit Juice in 286 healthy adults. The research method employed was a double blind, placebo controlled, and time-series design with C-Reactive Protein (CRP) serving as a marker for inflammation. CRP levels were measured at baseline as well as at eight weeks and 12 weeks post-treatment. Levels of uric acid were also recorded since it is known that fructose sweetened beverages elevated levels of uric acid. Blood concentrations of CRP in participants ingesting Nopalea were reduced by an average of 20. 9 % over a period of eight weeks. This effect diminished with time in that CRP levels were reduced by only 10. 5 % compared to baseline at 12 weeks (see Table 1). At both eight and 12 week assessments, these reductions were statistically significant (p 0. 05). Blood concentrations of CRP in participants ingesting <b>apricot</b> <b>juice</b> were reduced by an average of 7. 9 % over a period of eight weeks (see Table 2). By 12 weeks, this effect diminished and CRP levels were only 3. 1 % less than those at baseline. At both eight and 12 week assessments, these reductions were not statistically significant (p > 0. 05). Blood concentration of uric acid in this group increased by 5. 4 % over baseline by eight weeks and remained elevated by 2. 9 % over baseline by the end of 12 weeks. At both eight and 12 week assessments, these elevations were statistically significant. CONCLUSION: Ingestion of Nopalea results in a statistically significant decrease in the inflammatory marker, CRP, in healthy adults who maintain CRP levels under 3 mg/L, a level commonly associated with “average risk” for CVD...|$|E
