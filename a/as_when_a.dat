5|$|The book {{introduced}} {{the concepts of}} disruptive coloration to break up an object's outlines, of masquerade, <b>as</b> <b>when</b> <b>a</b> butterfly mimics a leaf, and especially of countershading, where an animal's tones make it appear flat by concealing its self-shadowing.|$|E
5|$|A same-document {{reference}} is a URI {{reference to a}} document containing the URI reference itself. A URI {{reference is}} defined as a same-document reference if, when resolved to absolute form, it equates exactly to the base URI in effect for the reference. When encountering a same-document reference, document processing software, for example a web browser, to efficiently use its current representation of a document to satisfy the resolution of a reference to that document without fetching a new representation. URI equivalence is defined <b>as</b> <b>when</b> <b>a</b> URI reference, while not identical to the base URI, still represents the same resource.|$|E
5|$|Aristotle's pupil and {{successor}} at the Lyceum, Theophrastus, {{wrote the}} History of Plants, the first classical book of botany. It has an Aristotelian structure, {{but rather than}} focus on formal causes, as Aristotle did, Theophrastus suggested a mechanistic scheme, comparing natural and artificial processes. Where Aristotle expanded on grand theories, Theophrastus was quietly empirical. Where Aristotle insisted that species have a fixed place on the scala naturae, Theophrastus suggests that one kind of plant can transform into another, <b>as</b> <b>when</b> <b>a</b> field sown to wheat turns to the weed darnel.|$|E
50|$|Victims of gassing are {{encouraged}} to undertake medical testing for possible infectious diseases. Gassing may occur spontaneously - such <b>as</b> <b>when</b> <b>an</b> inmate spits {{in the face of}} a correctional officer - or in a planned encounter - such <b>as</b> <b>when</b> <b>an</b> inmate mixes urine or feces with another liquid substance and throws it at <b>a</b> staff member <b>when</b> given the chance. In the state of California, for example, since 1998 a conviction for gassing has carried a sentence of up to five years segregation in prison.|$|R
50|$|Guilford, Dunham, & Hoepfner (1967): Presents the {{importance}} of Intelligence factors (a) visual-figural (line-drawings); (b) symbolic (letters); and (c) semantic (meaningful words). Also discusses <b>when</b> <b>a</b> process is viewed as “problem solving”, <b>as</b> <b>when</b> <b>an</b> individual uses whatever resources may address the problem.|$|R
50|$|In {{extremely}} rare situations (such <b>as</b> <b>when</b> <b>an</b> express trip has extremely low ridership, <b>when</b> <b>an</b> express bus trip is overcrowded, or if a bus breaks down {{and there is}} no replacement nearby), First Transit-RPTA will use former paratransit vehicles in regular service.|$|R
5|$|Barotrauma, {{an example}} of dysbarism, is {{physical}} damage to body tissues caused by a difference in pressure between a gas space inside, or {{in contact with the}} body, and the surrounding gas or fluid. It typically occurs when the organism is exposed to a large change in ambient pressure, such <b>as</b> <b>when</b> <b>a</b> diver ascends or descends. When diving, the pressure differences which cause the barotrauma are changes in hydrostatic pressure.|$|E
5|$|Note: Although {{the basic}} plot of Show Boat has always {{remained}} the same, {{over the years}} revisions and alterations {{were made by the}} creators, and over time by subsequent producers and directors. Some of these revisions were for length and some for convenience, <b>as</b> <b>when</b> <b>a</b> different actor played a certain role and was unable to perform a specialty piece written for the role's creator. Some have been made to reflect contemporary sensitivities toward race, gender and other social issues.|$|E
5|$|The robin also sings when storms {{approach}} and again when storms have passed. In {{addition to its}} song, the American robin {{has a number of}} calls used for communicating specific information such <b>as</b> <b>when</b> <b>a</b> ground predator approaches, and when a nest or robin is being directly threatened. Even during nesting season, when robins exhibit mostly competitive and territorial behavior, they may still band together to drive away a predator.|$|E
50|$|In addition, an {{oscillating}} {{system may}} be subject to some external force, <b>as</b> <b>when</b> <b>an</b> AC circuit is connected to an outside power source. In this case the oscillation is said to be driven.|$|R
5000|$|When used {{to grasp}} the cervix to {{stabilize}} the uterus, such <b>as</b> <b>when</b> <b>an</b> intrauterine device is being inserted, an allis clamp {{has the advantage of}} causing less bleeding than the more commonly used tenaculum.|$|R
50|$|A land-use {{conflict}} {{occurs when}} there are conflicting views on land-use policies, such <b>as</b> <b>when</b> <b>an</b> increasing population creates competitive demands {{for the use of}} the land, causing a negative impact on other land uses nearby.|$|R
5|$|Traumatic {{pneumothorax}} {{most commonly}} {{occurs when the}} chest wall is pierced, such <b>as</b> <b>when</b> <b>a</b> stab wound or gunshot wound allows air to enter the pleural space, or because some other mechanical injury to the lung compromises {{the integrity of the}} involved structures. Traumatic pneumothoraces have been found to occur in up to half of all cases of chest trauma, with only rib fractures being more common in this group. The pneumothorax can be occult (not readily apparent) in half of these cases, but may enlarge - particularly if mechanical ventilation is required. They are also encountered in patients already receiving mechanical ventilation for some other reason.|$|E
5|$|A five-man crew, {{the first}} pilot, co-pilot, {{navigator}} radar, navigator plotter and air electronics officer (AEO) was accommodated within the pressure cabin on two levels; the pilots sitting on Martin-Baker 3K (3KS on the B.2) ejection seats whilst {{on the lower}} level, the other crew sat facing rearwards and would abandon the aircraft via the entrance door. The original B35/46 specification sought a jettisonable crew compartment, this requirement was removed in a subsequent amendment, the rear crew's escape system was often an issue of controversy, such <b>as</b> <b>when</b> <b>a</b> practical refit scheme was rejected. A rudimentary sixth seat forward of the navigator radar was provided for an additional crew member; the B.2 had an additional seventh seat opposite the sixth seat and forward of the AEO. These seats {{were no more than}} cushions, a full harness and an oxygen and intercom facility. The visual bomb-aimer's compartment could be fitted with a T4 (Blue Devil) bombsight, in many B.2s this space housed a vertically mounted Vinten F95 Mk.10 camera for assessing simulated low-level bombing runs.|$|E
5|$|During the game, players {{describe}} their PC's intended actions, such as punching an opponent or picking a lock, and converse with the DM, who then describes the result or response. Trivial actions, such as {{picking up a}} letter or opening an unlocked door, are usually automatically successful. The outcomes of more complex or risky actions are determined by rolling dice. Factors contributing to the outcome include the character's ability scores, skills {{and the difficulty of}} the task. In circumstances where a character does not have control of an event, such <b>as</b> <b>when</b> <b>a</b> trap or magical effect is triggered or a spell is cast, a saving throw can be used to determine whether the resulting damage is reduced or avoided. In this case the odds of success are influenced by the character's class, levels and ability scores.|$|E

5|$|In {{gridiron}} football, {{the safety}} (American football) or safety touch (Canadian football) is a scoring play {{that results in}} two points (or, in rare cases, one point) being awarded to the scoring team. Safeties can be scored {{in a number of}} ways, such <b>as</b> <b>when</b> <b>a</b> ball carrier is tackled in his own end zone or when a foul is committed by the offense in their own end zone. After a safety is scored in American football, the ball is kicked off to the team that scored the safety from the 20-yard line; in Canadian football, the scoring team also has the options of taking control of the ball at their own 35-yard line or kicking off the ball, also at their own 35-yard line. The ability of the scoring team to receive the ball through a kickoff differs from the touchdown and field goal, which require the scoring team to kick the ball off to the scored upon team. Despite being of relatively low point value, safeties can {{have a significant impact on}} the result of games, and Brian Burke of Advanced NFL Stats estimated that safeties have a greater abstract value than field goals, despite being worth a point less, due to the field position and reclaimed possession gained off the safety kick.|$|E
5|$|Wild tigers {{that have}} had no prior contact with humans {{actively}} avoid interactions with humans. However, tigers cause more human deaths through direct attack than any other wild mammal. Attacks are occasionally provoked, as tigers lash out after being injured while they themselves are hunted. Attacks can be provoked accidentally, <b>as</b> <b>when</b> <b>a</b> human surprises a tiger or inadvertently comes between {{a mother and her}} young, or as in a case in rural India when a postman startled a tiger, used to seeing him on foot, by riding a bicycle. Occasionally tigers come to view people as prey. Such attacks are most common in areas where population growth, logging, and farming have put pressure on tiger habitats and reduced their wild prey. Most man-eating tigers are old, missing teeth, and unable to capture their preferred prey. For example, the Champawat Tiger, a tigress found in Nepal and then India, had two broken canines. She was responsible for an estimated 430 human deaths, the most attacks known to be perpetrated by a single wild animal, {{by the time she was}} shot in 1907 by Jim Corbett. According to Corbett, tiger attacks on humans are normally in daytime, when people are working outdoors and are not keeping watch. Early writings tend to describe man-eating tigers as cowardly because of their ambush tactics.|$|E
25|$|In Aristotlean physics {{bodies are}} subject to either natural motion, such <b>as</b> <b>when</b> <b>a</b> heavy body falls, or violent motion such <b>as</b> <b>when</b> <b>a</b> heavy body is thrown up. Although this essay was written {{following}} his reading of Descartes and Galileo, by its title it shows that Newton did not reject pre-Galilean mechanics tout court.|$|E
50|$|Contraction scoring lets {{composers and}} arrangers reduce the {{original}} work {{from a larger}} score to a smaller score, such <b>as</b> <b>when</b> <b>an</b> orchestral work is reduced to piano part. The resulting piano score is more commonly known as a piano reduction.|$|R
50|$|Legal {{malpractice}} is {{a separate}} concept such <b>as</b> <b>when</b> <b>an</b> attorney fails to adequately, professionally, competently, or zealously represent a client. While malpractice and misconduct may often {{be found in the}} same matter, they are separate concepts and need not both exist.|$|R

25|$|Failure is {{not simply}} defined <b>as</b> <b>when</b> <b>a</b> part breaks, however; it is defined <b>as</b> <b>when</b> <b>a</b> part does not operate as intended. Some systems, such as the {{perforated}} top sections of some plastic bags, are designed to break. If these systems do not break, failure analysis might be employed to determine the cause.|$|E

60|$|It was a {{gigantic}} task, and it cannot {{be said that}} it was totally successful, for the opposition in some quarters was strong. More than once Mr. Roosevelt was threatened with violence, but, <b>as</b> <b>when</b> <b>an</b> assemblyman, he paid but scant attention to these mutterings.|$|R
25|$|Approach {{motivation}} can {{be defined}} <b>as</b> <b>when</b> <b>a</b> certain behavior or reaction to a situation/environment is rewarded or results in a positive/desirable outcome. In contrast, avoidance motivation {{can be defined}} <b>as</b> <b>when</b> <b>a</b> certain behavior or reaction to a situation/environment is punished or results in a negative/undesirable outcome. Research suggests that, all else being equal, avoidance motivations {{tend to be more}} powerful than approach motivations. Because people expect losses to have more powerful emotional consequences than equal-size gains, they will take more risks to avoid a loss than to achieve a gain.|$|E
25|$|The CAB {{dismissed}} West's {{statement as}} unreliable, <b>as</b> <b>when</b> <b>a</b> plane's nose dips, the tail does not rise {{by such a}} significant amount as witnessed by West. However, the court-martial trial board acquitted Lt. Wilson of blame in the accident.|$|E
25|$|A fire {{sprinkler}} {{is the part}} of a {{fire sprinkler}} system that discharges water when the effects of a fire have been detected, such <b>as</b> <b>when</b> <b>a</b> pre-determined temperature has been reached.
