5|$|David's {{activities}} and whereabouts after 1114 are not <b>always</b> <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> trace. He {{spent much of}} his time outside his principality, in England and in Normandy. Despite the death of his sister on 1 May 1118, David still possessed the favour of King Henry when his brother Alexander died in 1124, leaving Scotland without a king.|$|E
5|$|It is not <b>always</b> <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> {{predict a}} grown Appaloosa's color at birth. Foals of any breed {{tend to be}} born with coats that darken when they shed their baby hair. In addition, Appaloosa foals do not always show classic leopard complex characteristics. Patterns {{sometimes}} change {{over the course of}} the horse's life although some, such as the blanket and leopard patterns, tend to be stable. Horses with the varnish roan and snowflake patterns are especially prone to show very little color pattern at birth, developing more visible spotting as they get older.|$|E
25|$|This technique, {{known as}} radio {{direction}} finding (RDF), is useful but only moderately accurate. Measurements better than a few degrees are difficult with a small antenna, {{and because of the}} electrical characteristics, it is not <b>always</b> <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> make a larger version that might provide more accuracy. Moreover, the addition of a loop antenna may be difficult on smaller vehicles, or difficult to operate for those without a dedicated navigator.|$|E

50|$|It's a small {{library with}} lots of functionality, {{accurately}} documented and thoroughly tested. Good library naming conventions are not rigorously observed {{on the principle that}} common operations should <b>always</b> be <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> write and code should <b>always</b> be <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> read.|$|R
25|$|Milton embraced many heterodox Christian {{theological}} views. He {{rejected the}} Trinity, {{in the belief}} that the Son was subordinate to the Father, a position known as Arianism; and his sympathy or curiosity was probably engaged by Socinianism: in August 1650 he licensed for publication by William Dugard the Racovian Catechism, based on a non-trinitarian creed. A source has interpreted him as broadly Protestant, if not <b>always</b> <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> locate in a more precise religious category.|$|E
25|$|During {{the seventeenth}} and eighteenth centuries, or the Age of Enlightenment, neo-classical culture was pervasive. English {{literature}} {{in the middle of that}} period has been dubbed Augustan. It is not <b>always</b> <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> distinguish Horace's influence during those centuries (the mixing of influences is shown for example in one poet's pseudonym, Horace Juvenal). However a measure of his influence can be found in the diversity of the people interested in his works, both among readers and authors.|$|E
25|$|It is not <b>always</b> <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> {{determine}} whether B12 deficiency is present, especially within older adults. Patients may present with violent behaviour or more subtle personality changes. They may also present with vague complaints, such as fatigue or memory loss, {{that may be}} attributed to normative aging processes. Cognitive symptoms may mimic behaviour in Alzheimer's and other dementias as well. Tests must be run on individuals presenting with such signs to confirm or negate cobalamin deficiency within the blood.|$|E
5000|$|Gröbner basis {{theory was}} {{initially}} introduced for the lexicographical ordering. It was soon realised that the Gröbner basis for degrevlex is almost <b>always</b> much <b>easier</b> <b>to</b> compute, {{and that it}} is almost <b>always</b> <b>easier</b> <b>to</b> compute a lex Gröbner basis by first computing the degrevlex basis and then using a [...] "change of ordering algorithm". When elimination is needed, degrevlex is not convenient; both lex and lexdeg may be used but, again, many computations are relatively easy with lexdeg and almost impossible with lex.|$|R
60|$|This suited me. It is <b>always</b> <b>easier</b> <b>to</b> talk intimately in the dark, and I did {{not wish}} to be {{interrupted}} by the sudden entrance of the Hired Man or Mrs. Beale, of which there was always a danger indoors. We walked down to the paddock. Ukridge lit a cigar.|$|R
60|$|Father labored with her, {{and cooked}} beans for her. She made him agree {{to get as}} far from New York as their nine dollars would take them before they should begin to be vagrants. It's <b>always</b> <b>easier</b> <b>to</b> be a bold adventurer in some town {{other than the one}} in which you are.|$|R
25|$|The {{t-distribution}} {{is often}} used {{as an alternative to}} the normal distribution as a model for data, which often has heavier tails than the normal distribution allows for; see e.g. Lange et al. The classical approach was to identify outliers and exclude or downweight them in some way. However, it is not <b>always</b> <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> identify outliers (especially in high dimensions), and the t-distribution is a natural choice of model for such data and provides a parametric approach to robust statistics.|$|E
25|$|Behavioral and {{ecological}} separation of tinamou species is evident where their ranges overlap through {{the utilization of}} different food sources and occupation of limited micro-habitats. These micro-habitats are not <b>always</b> <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> identify, and are highly vulnerable to environmental changes. Some species, such as the red-winged tinamou, utilize multiple habitats such as the open savannas of Amazonia and the dry valleys of the Andes. Similarly, brown tinamous occur in both the Amazon basin and the humid montane forests on the Andean slope.|$|E
25|$|In {{an effort}} to end the shame and secrecy of infertility, Redbook in October 2011 {{launched}} a video campaign, The Truth About Trying, to start an open conversation about infertility, which strikes one in eight women in the United States. In a survey of couples having difficulty conceiving, conducted by the pharmaceutical company Merck, 61 percent of respondents hid their infertility from family and friends. Nearly half didn't even tell their mothers. The message of those speaking out: It's not <b>always</b> <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> get pregnant, and there's no shame in that.|$|E
40|$|Oscillator lattices with random {{frequency}} distribution are numerically studied. We measured the local synchronization rate R in various oscillator lattices {{and found that}} on the lattices with more connections the oscillators are not <b>always</b> <b>easier</b> <b>to</b> synchronize. We also found strange behavior in which R is decreased as the coupling strength K is increased...|$|R
50|$|One-time pads solve few current {{practical}} problems in cryptography. High quality ciphers {{are widely available}} and their security is not considered a major worry at present. Such ciphers are almost <b>always</b> <b>easier</b> <b>to</b> employ than one-time pads; the amount of key material which must be properly generated and securely distributed is far smaller, and public key cryptography overcomes this problem.|$|R
60|$|It is <b>always</b> <b>easier</b> <b>to</b> work {{upon the}} {{sensitiveness}} of a spirited and generous-minded man, than to influence him by force or apprehensions. Roswell had never {{liked the idea}} of leaving Daggett behind him, at that season, and in that latitude; and he relished it still less, now that he saw a false reason might be attributed to his conduct.|$|R
25|$|During the 17th and 18th centuries, {{literary}} theorists in Europe {{distinguished between}} {{two types of}} lyric poetry, loosely associated with Horace and Pindar. Regular verses in four line stanzas were associated with Horace's Odes, which did in fact inspire and influence poets of the period. Irregular verses in longer stanzas were termed Pindarics though the association with Pindar was largely fanciful. Abraham Cowley was considered the main exponent of English Pindarics. In fact, the two styles were not <b>always</b> <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> distinguish and many 'Pindaric' odes were quite Horatian in content, as in some poems by Thomas Gray.|$|E
25|$|Given {{the very}} similar {{processes}} of place name formation in Sinhala and Tamil explicated above, {{it is not}} <b>always</b> <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> establish the original language of a place name, because loan translations are common in both directions. For such an alleged example of loan translation, see the case of Trincomalee above. Additionally, some place names draw on Sanskrit or Pali roots, which are then adapted to Sinhala and Tamil phonology in different ways. These intricacies {{must be taken into}} account when evaluating claims that a certain area was predominantly inhabited by one group or the other at a certain point in time.|$|E
25|$|The {{driving force}} of {{moisture}} movement is chemical potential. However, it is not <b>always</b> <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> relate chemical potential in wood to commonly observable variables, such as temperature and moisture content (Keey et al., 2000). Moisture in wood moves within the wood as liquid or vapour through several types of passageways, based {{on the nature of}} the driving force, (e.g. pressure or moisture gradient), and variations in wood structure (Langrish and Walker, 1993), as explained in the next section on driving forces for moisture movement. These pathways consist of cavities of the vessels, fibres, ray cells, pit chambers and their pit membrane openings, intercellular spaces and transitory cell wall passageways.|$|E

40|$|The {{analysis}} of collusion in infinitely repeated duopoly games has generally assumed that marginal cost is constant, but this note uses quadratic costs (linear marginal costs) {{to compare the}} sustainability of collusion under Bertrand and Cournot duopoly with differentiated products. It is shown that when marginal costs are sufficiently increasing in output, then it is <b>always</b> <b>easier</b> <b>to</b> sustain collusion under Cournot duopoly than under Bertrand duopoly for any degree of product substitutability...|$|R
40|$|The {{important}} facts {{relevant to}} {{the historical development of}} a scientific discovery are <b>always</b> <b>easier</b> <b>to</b> discern when it is possible to examine them {{in the light of the}} knowledge to which time and the work of many investigators have contributed. Such is the case with aldosterone, which is in all probability, the most important active principle of the amorphous fraction, after extraction of "all" the crystallizable substances from adrenal cortical extracts...|$|R
25|$|The {{electrodes}} are {{immersed in}} the solution to be titrated and the potential difference between the electrodes is measured. Measured volumes of titrant are added, with thorough (magnetic) stirring, and the corresponding values of emf (electromotive force) or pH recorded. Small increments in volume should be added near the equivalence point which is found graphically by noting the burette reading corresponding to the maximum change of emf or pH per unit change of volume. When {{the slope of the}} curve is more gradual it is not <b>always</b> <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> locate the equivalent point by this method. However, if small increments (0.1nbsp&cm³ or less) of titrant are added near the end point of the titration and a curve of change of emf or pH per unit volume against volume of titrant is plotted, a differential curve is obtained in which the equivalence point is indicated by a peak.|$|E
25|$|Like his {{activities}} before 1113, David's activities and personal whereabouts after 1114 are not <b>always</b> <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> trace. He {{spent much of}} his time outside his principality. He was, for instance, at St Albans on December 28, 1115, and was still in England in 1116 when he witnessed a charter of his sister Queen Matilda (Edith, or Maud) at Westminster Abbey. Despite the death of his sister on May 1, 1118, David remained a favoured vassal of King Henry. He was at Henry's court in the years 1121 and 1122. He was in the south of England in the summer of 1123, and it is possible that David accompanied Henry to Normandy in the same year to suppress William Clito's claim for the Duchy of Normandy. If David did go to France, then by the time he returned to Britain in 1124 his brother Alexander had died.|$|E
25|$|Black-figure vase {{painting}} in Euboea was {{also influenced by}} Corinth and especially by Attica. It is not <b>always</b> <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> distinguish these works from Attic vases. Scholars assume {{that most of the}} pottery was produced in Eretria. Primarily amphoras, lekythos, hydria and plates were painted. Large-format amphoras were usually decorated with mythological scenes, such as the adventures of Herakles or the Judgment of Paris. The large amphoras, derived from 7th century shapes, have tapering lips and usually scenes relating to weddings. They are apparently funerary vases produced for children who died before they could marry. Restrained employment of incising and regular use of opaque white for the floral ornaments were typical features of black-figure pottery from Eretria. In addition to scenes reflecting Attic models, there were also wilder scenes like the rape of a deer by a satyr or Heracles with centaurs and demons. The vases of the Dolphin Class were previously regarded as being Attic, but are now considered to be Euboic. However, their clay does not match any known Eretrian sources. Perhaps the pieces were produced in Chalcis.|$|E

50|$|Domestic {{sources are}} usually {{closer to the}} {{distributor}} or retailer than 'imported sources'. Sources like raw materials, services or products can be delivered in shorter periods of time compared to foreign sources. After sales, exchange or refunds of faulty products will benefit as well; as it is <b>always</b> <b>easier</b> <b>to</b> communicate with local business rather than international cooperations. Further, there is also quicker reaction to emergency situations or faster decision making to uncertainties in the market.|$|R

500|$|Because {{the method}} of {{radicals}} is applied only to the written character, one need {{not know how to}} pronounce a character before looking it up; the entry, once located, usually gives the pronunciation. [...] However, it is not <b>always</b> <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> identify which of the various roots of a character is the proper radical. [...] Accordingly, dictionaries often include a list of hard to locate characters, indexed by total stroke count, near the beginning of the dictionary. [...] Some dictionaries include almost one-seventh of all characters in this list.|$|E
500|$|Some surnames, like Bird, {{dating from}} 1193 onwards, with {{variants}} like Byrd and Bride, {{are most likely}} nicknames for a birdlike person, though {{they may also be}} metonyms for a birdcatcher; but Birdwood is toponymic, for a person who lived by a wood full of birds. Eagle from 1230 is a nickname from the bird, while Weasel, Wessel from 1193 and Stagg from 1198 are certainly nicknames from those animals. It is not <b>always</b> <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> tell whether a nickname was friendly, humorous or negative, but the surname Stallion, with variants Stallan, Stallen and Stallon, (1202 onwards) is certainly pejorative, meaning [...] "a begetter, a man of lascivious life".|$|E
500|$|Justin Haywald of 1UP.com {{stated that}} [...] "even when I felt I had to guess which {{direction}} I {{was supposed to}} go, the levels are set up well enough that the way forward is <b>always</b> <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> figure out". Haywald praised the visuals as well, but stated that [...] "as the scenery grows more cluttered, it also sometimes becomes {{difficult to find a}} safe place to land after sending the world spinning". Haywald rated And Yet It Moves a B+. NintendoLife rated the WiiWare version 9 out of 10, stating that the new additions and updated controls made it the [...] "definitive version of the game" [...] despite the omission of online features seen in the PC version.|$|E
40|$|Papers on “future directions” {{are usually}} written by list makers and {{appear in a}} form similar to those small {{magazines}} found in motels which tell you “what to do” this week. It is <b>always</b> <b>easier</b> <b>to</b> tell others {{what to do and}} even <b>easier</b> <b>to</b> tell others where to go. Too, since we are discussing “future” research, there is a standard litany that future research should always be driven by theory, while ignoring the question of what drives theorists. Such a litany underscores the importance of ritual in social life. Such litanies are important in the rituals of the research community...|$|R
