5|$|While {{much of the}} Loop's 19th-century {{architecture}} {{has been}} lost to demolition and redevelopment, the Rookery has been spared this fate {{through a series of}} well executed renovations.

5|$|The Royal Crescent is {{a row of}} 30 terraced houses {{laid out}} in a {{sweeping}} crescent in the city of Bath, England. Designed by the architect John Wood, the Younger and built between 1767 and 1774, it is among the greatest examples of Georgian architecture {{to be found in the}} United Kingdom and is a Grade I listed building. Although some changes have been made to the various interiors over the years, the Georgian stone façade remains much <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>when</b> it was first built.|$|E

50|$|On {{the soundtrack}} {{album of the}} opera, {{released}} by EMI, the music is presented with no cuts or additions, <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>when</b> Otello <b>is</b> performed on the stage.

30|$|Note that in {{the case}} of the Euclidean {{distance}} between orientation vectors, it does not represent the physical distance between the orientations <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>when</b> using Cartesian points.

Electronic forms of communication grow rapidly in every field of life but many of their effects on culture remain obscure and in need of new kinds of critical scrutiny.

25|$|Slaves at Poplar Forest {{participated in}} an {{informal}} economy by trading and selling objects as well as hiring themselves out or being hired out for paid work. Archaeological excavations have revealed objects that offer scholars a more complete idea {{of the types of}} objects and work that were valued in this economy. Future excavations will be geared towards determining the landscape <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>when</b> Jefferson designed and spent time at Poplar Forest so that the present-day museum can re-create Jefferson's vision for visitors.|$|E

A Lincoln room was established in his honor within the hotel during its later years, the room was furnished much <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>when</b> Lincoln stayed at the hotel.

25|$|At first, some of {{the younger}} Livingstons' estates {{followed}} the British colonial patterns of Clermont. Rhinebeck House, today known as Grasmere, is the best-preserved example. Later on the houses began to show the influence of contemporary French tastes, abandoning the large central hall in favor of smaller rooms and passageways inside and focusing more attention on the garden side of the house, which usually faced the river and mountains as well. Montgomery Place, built by Janet Livingston Montgomery after the death of her husband Richard, is the only example from this period that remains largely <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>when</b> first built.|$|E
25|$|On {{the island}} of Manhattan <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>when</b> Europeans first saw it, the Great Kill formed from three small streams that united near present-day Tenth Avenue and 40th Street, and then wound through the low-lying Reed Valley, renowned for fish and waterfowl, to empty into the Hudson River at a deep bay on the river at the present 42nd Street. The name was {{retained}} in a tiny hamlet called Great Kill, which became a center for carriage-making, while the upland {{to the south and}} east became known as Longacre, the predecessor of Longacre Square (now Times Square).|$|E
25|$|The Taming of the Shrew in {{performance}} {{has had an}} uneven history. Popular in Shakespeare's day, the play fell out of favour during the seventeenth century, when it was replaced on the stage by John Lacy's Sauny the Scott. The original Shakespearean text was {{not performed at all}} during the eighteenth century, with David Garrick's adaptation Catharine and Petruchio dominating the stage. After over two hundred years without a performance, the play returned to the British stage in 1844, the last Shakespeare play restored to the repertory. However, {{it was only in the}} 1890s that the dominance of Catharine and Petruchio began to wain, and productions of The Shrew become more regular. Moving into the twentieth century, the play's popularity increased considerably, and it became one of Shakespeare's most frequently staged plays, with productions taking place all over the world. This trend has continued into the twenty-first century, with the play as popular now <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>when</b> first written.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} the way PMCs shape {{security}} policies and more generally political priorities. Linking up with classical thinking about "civil-military relations", it suggests that preoccupation with security professionals’ role in shaping politics <b>is</b> as important <b>when</b> these professionals <b>are</b> privately organised in PMCs <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>when</b> they <b>are</b> enrolled in public armed forces. The paper shows that existing regulation has not been adjusted to account for this fact and that the significance of regulating PMCs’ role in shaping politics <b>is</b> profoundly underestimated. <b>It</b> therefore argues that putting the issue of regulating "civil-PMCs relations" on the agenda is essential...|$|R

25|$|The {{club was}} formed {{by a group of}} friends from the Heart of Midlothian Quadrille Assembly Club. The group of friends bought a ball before playing local rules {{football}} at the Tron from where they were directed by a local policeman to The Meadows to play. Local rules football was a mix of rugby and football as we know it. In December 1873 a match was held between XIs selected by Mr Thomson from Queens Park and Mr Gardner from Clydesdale at Raimes Park in Bonnington. This {{was the first time that}} Association rules had been seen in Edinburgh. Members from the dance club viewed the match and in 1874 decided to adopt the association rules. The new side was Heart of Mid-Lothian Football Club. The exact date of the club's formation was never recorded; however, 1874 is regarded as the year of formation <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>when</b> association rules were taken on, although Tom Purdie claimed the club was formed in 1873. The earliest mention of Heart of Midlothian in a sporting context is a report in The Scotsman newspaper from 20 July 1864 of The Scotsman vs Heart of Mid-Lothian at cricket. It is not known if this was the same club who went on to form the football club, but it was common for football clubs in those days to play other sports as well.|$|E
