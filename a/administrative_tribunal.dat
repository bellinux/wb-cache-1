40|$|This Article {{examines}} the law applied by the <b>administrative</b> <b>tribunals</b> of international organizations when resolving disputes between international organizations and international civil servants. The analysis suggests that international <b>administrative</b> <b>tribunals</b> primarily rely on employment contracts and internal law of international organisations while only rarely referencing international law. This Article argues that international <b>administrative</b> <b>tribunals</b> should specifically define in their relevant statutes {{the sources of}} law applicable to international administrative disputes {{and that they should}} distinguish such sources from non-legal norms. The Article further notes the modern trend of international <b>administrative</b> <b>tribunals</b> of giving more weight to general principles of law. It ultimately argues that these tribunals should establish the supremacy of international law, particularly fundamental principles of international labor law, over the internal law of international organizations. The establishment of such a hierarchy will make international administrative law more legitimate, coherent, and predictable...|$|R
40|$|Australian {{courts and}} <b>administrative</b> <b>tribunals</b> are {{dependent}} upon government for funding. Additionally, in most circumstances, courts and <b>administrative</b> <b>tribunals</b> are dependent upon government for administrative assistance. The {{rule of law}} requires the three branches of government, the executive, the legislative and the judicial be separate. Given the dependence on funding and administrative support, can Australia’s courts and <b>administrative</b> <b>tribunals</b> be “independent”? This article examines whether there is difference between administrative independence and adjudicative independence and then presents the views of participants gained from two separate surveys {{on the issue of}} whether {{there is a difference between}} administrative and adjudicative independence...|$|R

The man is prosecutable and can be sentenced for up to five years (even if he himself was unmarried) whereas the married woman cannot be jailed. Men have called the law gender discrimination in that women cannot be prosecuted for adultery and the National Commission of Women has criticized the British era law of being anti-feminist as it treats women as the property of their husbands and has consequently recommended deletion of the law or reducing it to a civil offense. The Government is yet to act. Extramarital sex without the consent of one's partner can be a valid grounds for monetary penalty on government employees, as ruled by the Central <b>Administrative</b> <b>Tribunal.</b>|$|E
25|$|In 2008, the {{handling}} of some Voyager survivors' cases was investigated by the Law Institute of Victoria, after they made complaints about the discrepancies between what they were awarded and what was received: for example, one sailor only received $72,000 from a $412,000 settlement. All of the complaints were from cases handled by David Forster of Hollows Lawyers, who handled 89 of the 214 total cases; these resulted in a total settlement of $23 million. Investigations found major accounting issues, including apparent double-charging for work done, and charging full fees after they were discounted or completely written off. In 2010, receivers were called in, {{this was followed by}} the cancellation of Forster's law practising certificate in December 2011, and proceedings against Forster in the Victorian Civil and <b>Administrative</b> <b>Tribunal</b> were due to commence on 10 February 2014; the 50th anniversary of the collision.|$|E

25|$|The {{permanent}} council {{established at the}} instance of the Russian government (1773–1788) served as the highest <b>administrative</b> <b>tribunal,</b> and occupied itself with the elaboration of {{a plan that would}} make practicable the reorganization of Poland on a more rational basis. The progressive elements in Polish society recognized the urgency of popular education as the very first step toward reform. The famous Komisja Edukacji Narodowej ("Commission of National Education"), the first ministry of education in the world, was established in 1773 and founded numerous new schools and remodeled the old ones. One {{of the members of the}} commission, kanclerz Andrzej Zamoyski, along with others, demanded that the inviolability of their persons and property should be guaranteed and that religious toleration should be to a certain extent granted them; but he insisted that Jews living in the cities should be separated from the Christians, that those of them having no definite occupation should be banished from the kingdom, and that even those engaged in agriculture should not be allowed to possess land. On the other hand, some szlachta and intellectuals proposed a national system of government, of the civil and political equality of the Jews. This was the only example in modern Europe before the French Revolution of tolerance and broadmindedness in dealing with the Jewish question. But all these reforms were too late: a Russian army soon invaded Poland, and soon after a Prussian one followed.|$|E
25|$|In December 2005, the {{bankrupt}} Volare Group (Volareweb, Air Europe) {{was put up}} for sale. Alitalia bid to buy the group (other bidders were Air One and Meridiana/Eurofly). Air One went to court claiming that Alitalia could not buy Volare Group as it had received state aid in the past. The TAR (Regional <b>Administrative</b> <b>Tribunal)</b> of Lazio tried to block Alitalia's acquisition of Volare Group but abandoned the attempt, claiming that Alitalia had repaid its €400 million loan and {{so there would be}} nothing stopping it from buying Volare Group. Air One also went to court, unsuccessfully. Alitalia created Volare SpA to buy the Volare Group. The airlines were becoming closer and Volare Group had started providing soft maintenance services for some Alitalia aircraft in Milan Malpensa airport. However, the Italian Consiglio di Stato (State Council) on 23 May 2006 has once again blocked the acquisition of the airline. It is not clear {{what is going to happen}} as Volare is in serious financial difficulties. On 2 November 2006 TAR court decided that the administrative procedure used by the Italian government to sell Volare to Alitalia was invalid but the selling contract is still valid because the administrative court was declared incompetent about this topic. If Air One wants to obtain Volare it will have to go to the local civil court and ask it to declare that the selling contract is invalid. Alitalia's offer for 38 million euros was the winning bid. On 15 May 2006 the former Volare Group employees were transferred to Volare SpA (the Alitalia subsidiary).|$|E
