5|$|In Britain and elsewhere, {{commercial}} forestry has created new habitat which has increased numbers, but these gains {{are likely to}} be temporary as the woodland develops and becomes unsuitable for nightjars. In the United Kingdom, it is red-listed as <b>a</b> <b>cause</b> <b>for</b> <b>concern,</b> and in Ireland it is close to extinction.|$|E
5|$|In March 2007, Silverstein {{appeared}} {{at a rally}} of construction workers and public officials outside an insurance industry conference. He highlighted {{what he describes as}} the failures of insurers Allianz and Royal & Sun Alliance to pay $800 million in claims related to the attacks. Insurers state that an agreement to split payments between Silverstein and the Port Authority is <b>a</b> <b>cause</b> <b>for</b> <b>concern.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{numerous}} ship wrecks {{that occurred}} along the southeast coast of Florida from Key Biscayne to the Dry Tortugas was <b>a</b> <b>cause</b> <b>for</b> <b>concern.</b> Between the late 1840s {{and the late}} 1850s, more than 500 ships were wrecked on the Florida Reef. The Assistant United States Coast Surveyor reported that in the period from 1845 through 1849, almost one million (United States) dollars worth of vessels and cargoes were lost on the reef.|$|E

25|$|Since the 19th century, {{the village}} water supply {{has come from}} the estate of the Duke of Somerset rather than from a {{commercial}} water company. The estate's decision to terminate the supply is <b>a</b> <b>cause</b> <b>for</b> local <b>concern.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The {{influence}} of the pharmaceutical industry on medical research has been <b>a</b> major <b>cause</b> <b>for</b> <b>concern.</b> In 2009 <b>a</b> study found that [...] "a number of academic institutions" [...] do not have clear guidelines for relationships between Institutional Review Boards and industry.|$|R
5|$|After {{receiving}} end-of-life care, Brady died of restrictive {{pulmonary disease}} in Ashworth Hospital on 15 May 2017. On 21 September 2017, the inquest {{found that he}} {{died of natural causes}} and his hunger strike had not been a contributory factor. Brady had refused food and fluids for more than 48 hours on various occasions, causing him to be fitted with a nasogastric tube, although his inquest noted that his body mass index was not <b>a</b> <b>cause</b> <b>for</b> <b>concern.</b> Brady was cremated on 25 October 2017 and his ashes were disposed of at sea.|$|E
5|$|American {{broadcaster}} NBC Sports, {{who also}} owns the broadcast {{rights to the}} Olympics, has been criticised by athletes and IPC officials for airing too little coverage of the Paralympics; the lack of coverage from NBC in Athens was <b>a</b> <b>cause</b> <b>for</b> <b>concern</b> from senior IPC officials, especially given that the United States was bidding for the 2012 Games. In 2012 NBC only produced around 5 hours of tape delayed highlights from the Games, airing on the pay TV channel NBC Sports Network, and did not cover the ceremonies at all.|$|E
5|$|There {{are several}} breed traits which may cause concern as health issues. They include skull {{issues such as}} an open fontanelle, where in young dogs there is a soft spot in the skull; it is common in dogs under a year old. A {{complication}} from that condition is hydrocephalus, also known as water on the brain. This condition may cause neurological symptoms that require the dog to be euthanised. Fused toes, where {{two or more of}} the dog's toes are fused together, may seem to be a health issue but this breed trait is not <b>a</b> <b>cause</b> <b>for</b> <b>concern.</b>|$|E
25|$|A 2015 RAND Corporation report {{noted the}} J-20’s {{combination}} of forward stealth and long range could hold U.S. Navy surface assets at risk, {{and that a}} long-range maritime strike capability may be <b>a</b> <b>cause</b> <b>for</b> greater <b>concern</b> than <b>a</b> short-range air-superiority fighter like the F-22.|$|R
50|$|Overall, {{while the}} Turkish legal {{framework}} includes a comprehensive set of safeguards against torture and ill-treatment, efforts {{to implement it}} and fully apply the government's zero tolerance policy have been limited. Allegations of torture and ill-treatment, and impunity for perpetrators are still <b>a</b> <b>cause</b> <b>for</b> great <b>concern.</b>|$|R
50|$|North Common is {{adjacent}} to the villages of Warmley, Oldland Common and Bridgeyate and the nearby Cadbury Heath housing estate.

5|$|Like their {{relatives}} the honeybees, bumblebees feed on nectar, using their long hairy tongues to lap up the liquid; the proboscis is folded under the head during flight. Bumblebees gather nectar {{to add to}} the stores in the nest, and pollen to feed their young. They forage using colour and spatial relationships to identify flowers to feed from. Some bumblebees rob nectar, making a hole near the base of a flower to access the nectar while avoiding pollen transfer. Bumblebees are important agricultural pollinators, so their decline in Europe, North America, and Asia is <b>a</b> <b>cause</b> <b>for</b> <b>concern.</b> The decline has been caused by habitat loss, the mechanisation of agriculture, and pesticides.|$|E
5|$|The {{frequency}} of defamation suits brought by Government ministers and PAP MPs against critics, in particular political opponents, has been <b>a</b> <b>cause</b> <b>for</b> <b>concern</b> for {{organizations such as}} the International Bar Association and the United States Department of State. Amnesty International has referred to the use of civil defamation suits as a strategy by the government to inhibit the public activities of opposition politicians. This is due to how high awards of damages often cripple opposition politicians financially, causing them to become bankrupt and thus lose their parliamentary seats or become ineligible to run for elections. The resulting perception is that Singapore's leadership has a long-standing reputation for using defamation actions as a mechanism for removing opposition members from the Singapore Parliament or for inhibiting opposing political views.|$|E
5|$|Internally, the {{concessions}} made by General Khánh {{had the effect}} of unsettling Catholic officers such as Nguyễn Văn Thiệu and Trần Thiện Khiêm, because they were concerned by what they perceived to be the handing of power to Buddhist leaders. Subsequently, General Khiêm fell out with General Khánh over policy issues along religious lines, even though an alliance between both men had enabled Khánh to remove General Minh from power. As military support for his regime diminished, Khánh had to rely upon civilian Buddhist activists to maintain power. For the Americans, Khánh's increased reliance on the Buddhists was <b>a</b> <b>cause</b> <b>for</b> <b>concern,</b> because the Buddhists favoured a political resolution to the conflict with the Communists. Thus, by the end of 1964 the Americans looked for someone to overthrow Khánh, in order to continue the military effort against the Communists. On February 20, 1965, Khánh was finally removed from power, and he was forced to leave South Vietnam.|$|E
50|$|Myriad {{animals can}} also be found along the hike {{including}} bumblebees, white-tailed hawks, hummingbirds, rattlesnakes, green snakes, red salamanders, crayfish. The snakes are not <b>a</b> special <b>cause</b> <b>for</b> <b>concern</b> as they are not particularly aggressive. One might even find oneself swimming with a mink at one of the many swimming holes.|$|R
30|$|Abnormal uterine {{bleeding}} {{during the}} perimenopausal and postmenopausal periods is common and <b>a</b> frequent <b>cause</b> <b>for</b> <b>concern.</b> There is <b>a</b> need for accurate diagnosis of endometrial pathology and a thorough {{evaluation of the}} uterine cavity in order to exclude endometrial neoplasia, a condition occurring with increasing incidence and possessing potentially serious consequences.|$|R
50|$|Season 2004 was {{the worst}} in some time for the Parramatta Eels. After only {{managing}} 9 wins in 24 games, the Eels finished 12th and missed out on the Finals {{for the second year}} running. This was <b>a</b> grave <b>cause</b> <b>for</b> <b>concern</b> at the club who had not seen a Premiership victory since 1986.|$|R
5|$|Philipp {{participated in}} various {{sporting}} events {{organized by the}} Christlicher Verein Junger Männer (CVJM—the German equivalent of YMCA) such as hiking, bicycling, skiing, paddling and rowing. He also {{was a member of}} the Hitlerjugend (HJ—Hitler Youth) and received the HJ-Ehrenzeichen (Honor Badge). Philipp learned to fly glider aircraft in the Hitler Youth and received his A and B glider license, leading the local HJ-Fliegerschar (Flying Squad) in Meissen. Adolf Hitler officially re-established the Luftwaffe in March 1935. Following this event, Philipp then changed his mind and decided he did not want to become a journalist. He passed his physical examination to become a pilot, observer, aircraft mechanic and or radio operator on 6 September 1935 in Dresden. The financial situation of the Philipp family was always <b>a</b> <b>cause</b> <b>for</b> <b>concern.</b> When Alma's mother was paralyzed and required nursing care, the financial situation became severe. Alma's monthly income was 225 RM and the annual school fee of 180 RM was a big burden. She wrote to the city council multiple times asking for the fees to be waived. By early 1935, the family was behind on their payments which had accumulated to a debt of 390 RM by 31 March 1935. Philipp's graduation from school was at risk as he was threatened with expulsion on financial grounds. Philipp's decision to opt for military service in the Wehrmacht eased the financial tension. He was permitted to graduate, provided that his mother paid back the debt in instalments of 10 RM per month.|$|E
25|$|The fading {{paint on}} the rosettes has been <b>a</b> <b>cause</b> <b>for</b> <b>concern</b> in the past. In 1996, in {{preparation}} for Mega-Gems acquisition into the Indianapolis Museum of Art collection, the rosettes were returned to the artist for repainting.|$|E
25|$|Morocco's {{unemployment}} rate, long <b>a</b> <b>cause</b> <b>for</b> <b>concern,</b> {{has been}} dropping steadily in 2008, {{on the back}} of job growth in services and construction.

As such, all the Junimea founders except Negruzzi were absent from the club's meeting on February 25, 1872.|$|E
50|$|The Klang Consumer Association {{had been}} protesting against the {{relocation}} of the terminal to Klang Sentral since 2005. In addition to that, there are numerous industrial factories nearby, which is <b>a</b> <b>cause</b> <b>for</b> environmental <b>concerns.</b> Also, Klang Sentral {{is expected to increase}} the already bad major traffic congestion along Jalan Meru and Jalan Kapar, the two main artery roads in Klang.|$|R

50|$|As World War II {{drew to a}} close, {{most economists}} {{predicted}} that with an end to government spending on the war, the economy would collapse again. Slichter correctly predicted that with soldiers coming home seeking a normal life and material pleasures, the economy would grow strongly {{after the end of}} the war and that inflation would be <b>a</b> greater <b>cause</b> <b>for</b> <b>concern</b> than depression.|$|R
25|$|Diminishing harvests of E. delegorguei {{has been}} <b>a</b> <b>cause</b> <b>for</b> <b>concern</b> in recent years. It {{may be due}} to the decline in the number of {{available}} food plants which are being harvested locally for firewood. Studies are being done in South Africa for ways to ensure sustainable harvests of E. delegorguei, as well as for the possibilities of rearing them in captivity for human consumption.|$|E
25|$|The Battle of the Black Gate {{was filmed}} in April at the Rangipo Desert, a former minefield. New Zealand {{soldiers}} were hired as extras while guides {{were on the}} lookout for unexploded mines.
