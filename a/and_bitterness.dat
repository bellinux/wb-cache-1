5|$|Although Evans {{had always}} {{suffered}} from bouts of depression, <b>and</b> <b>bitterness</b> towards those he felt did not appreciate his inventions, such sentiments seemed to peak {{in his later}} years. During {{one of his many}} legal battles in 1809, comments from the presiding judge sent Evans into a particular fury in which he dramatically incinerated many schematics and papers regarding his inventions, both prior and future. Evans declared at the time that inventing had led only to heartache, disappointment and under-appreciation; and committed himself to business and material acquisition {{for the sake of his}} family. Ultimately what was burned represents only a small proportion of what survives from Evans, and he did continue his interest in inventing, but the tone of Evans's later life was undoubtedly one of hostility and disappointment.|$|E
5|$|By 27 April, Berlin was cut {{off from}} the rest of Germany. Secure radio {{communications}} with defending units had been lost; the command staff in the bunker had to depend on telephone lines for passing instructions and orders and on public radio for news and information. On 28 April, a BBC report originating from Reuters was picked up; a copy of the message was given to Hitler. The report stated that Reichsführer-SS Heinrich Himmler had offered to surrender to the western Allies; the offer had been declined. Himmler had implied to the Allies that he had the authority to negotiate a surrender; Hitler considered this treason. During the afternoon his anger <b>and</b> <b>bitterness</b> escalated into a rage against Himmler. Hitler ordered Himmler's arrest and had Hermann Fegelein (Himmler's SS representative at Hitler's headquarters in Berlin) shot.|$|E
5|$|Duchesne {{now called}} on Basil Orchard and Wilfred Boothroyd {{to counter the}} defence's evidence. Orchard, another doctor from Penetanguishene, testified that Lamb had {{suddenly}} abandoned any show of amnesia during an interview in August 1966. He saw no evidence that Lamb was insane {{and said that he}} was simply a young man with strong impulses who sometimes could not control them. Boothroyd, of Sunnybrook Hospital in Toronto, then spoke, arguing that Lamb had been acting out strong feelings of anger <b>and</b> <b>bitterness</b> and fully intended to kill the people he confronted, knowing and understanding what that meant. Lamb, he said, was capable of all kinds of emotion and was perfectly able {{to understand the nature of}} what he had done. Justice Stark intervened during Boothroyd's testimony, asking how he could give a reliable opinion on Lamb when he had never examined him. He also remarked that his opinion was contrary to every doctor who had testified so far.|$|E
50|$|Not {{all people}} truly {{satisfied}} with their lives <b>and</b> live without <b>bitterness</b> <b>and</b> grief.

She is surprised and thrilled when he returns home with his prison sentence lifted, but Homer feels guilt for Fat Tony's death <b>and</b> <b>bitterness</b> toward the government over being used to bring him down. Homer visits Fat Tony's grave to apologize, but is kidnapped by his cousin Fit Tony, who plans to kill him for revenge. However, Fit Tony spares his life after Homer tells {{of the time he}} and Fat Tony spent together, seeing that Fat Tony lives on in Homer's memories. Fit Tony takes charge of the syndicate, but the stress of the position causes him to overeat and gain weight, becoming known first as Fit Fat Tony and then simply Fat Tony - now physically indistinguishable from the original.|$|E

25|$|The Sunday Telegraph {{reported}} on 11 September that {{almost the entire}} population of Tawergha, a town of about 10,000 people, had been forced to flee their homes by anti-Gaddafi fighters after their takeover of the settlement. The report suggested that Tawergha, which was dominated by black Libyans, may {{have been the subject of}} ethnic cleansing provoked by a combination of racism <b>and</b> <b>bitterness</b> on the part of Misratan fighters over the town's support for Gaddafi during the siege of Misrata.|$|E

The Waikato–Tainui tribe accepted a compensation of cash and some government-controlled lands totalling about $171 million—approximately 1 percent {{of the value of}} the lands confiscated in 1863 — and later that year Queen Elizabeth II personally signed the bill.

25|$|The main {{difference}} between free-run and pressed juice is that pressed juice often has lower acidity levels, higher potassium and pH level, more phenolic compounds such as tannins and more suspended solids such as natural gum and proteins. Some of these attributes can be positive {{influences on the}} wine with the increased phenolics offering more body, aroma characteristics (such as the varietal aromas from terpenes) and aging potential. Other attributes may have more negative influence such as increased astringency <b>and</b> <b>bitterness,</b> precursor for browning pigments in white wine, mouthfeel and balance issues (as well as potential microbial instability) from the increased pH and the enhance need for fining agents {{to assist in the}} clarification and stabilization of the wine with the increase in suspended solids.|$|E
25|$|Delaware {{experienced}} all {{the contention}} <b>and</b> <b>bitterness</b> of a border {{state in the}} Civil War and the {{events leading up to}} it, but because of its location and certain decisive military action, was spared much of the bloodshed of Kentucky and Missouri. Nevertheless, the divisions in communities and families, and their corresponding strong feelings were the same. A slave state with very few slaves or slaveholders, many in Delaware had an attitude they called “states rights,” which really meant, “Outsiders are not going to tell us what to do.” Given the close economic ties to Philadelphia, and the geographical separation from the Confederacy, there was little sentiment for actual secession. However, the opposition to the abolitionist and voting rights agenda of the Republican federal government were strong enough to create considerable contentiousness. These feeling were strongest in the two lower counties, which still had a majority of the population in 1860, and completely dominated the General Assembly, the real decision maker in the state.|$|E
40|$|<b>Bitterness</b> <b>and</b> {{astringency}} are attributes generally {{cited as}} the cause of tannin sorghums being unpalatable. The objective here was to determine the effect of sorghums with varying tannin content on <b>bitterness</b> <b>and</b> astringency simultaneously using dual attribute time-intensity (DATI). A trained panel assessed <b>bitterness</b> <b>and</b> astringency of bran infusions of tannin and tannin-free sorghums. In both sorghum types, <b>bitterness</b> developed <b>and</b> reached maximum intensity faster (Tmax 22. 5 s; P < 0. 001) than astringency (27. 9 s). The duration of the astringent sensation (Dtot 69. 9 s) lasted longer than bitterness (66. 3 s). Overall, the temporal parameters for bitterness distinguished infusions from tannin and tannin-free sorghums slightly more clearly than those for astringency. The research established that, for sorghum, <b>bitterness</b> <b>and</b> astringency are related. The DATI method also revealed that panellists’ perceptions of the time course of <b>bitterness</b> <b>and</b> astringency differ. The South African National Research Foundation[URL]...|$|R

25|$|The city of Basel and {{the city}} of Zürich have a long-standing rivalry. Therefore, FCB's most {{traditional}} and fiercest rivals are Grasshopper Club Zürich and FC Zürich. In the past few seasons, the rivalry between FC Zürich and Basel has been fueled by Zürich's narrow league championship wins over Basel. Supporters from both sides have caused trouble in the past years, with the worst incident happening in May 2006. Basel had won the league in 2003–04 and 2004–05 and were set to make it three in a row if they won or drew against Zürich at home {{on the last day of}} the 2005–06 season. Zürich took the lead after a late goal from Iulian Filipescu and consequently won the match and the league. After the final whistle, players and fans from both teams started fighting on the pitch and in the stands. This incident has fueled hatred <b>and</b> <b>bitterness</b> between fans from FC Zürich and FC Basel. There is controversy about which rivalry is bigger, the one with Grasshopper or FC Zürich, but it usually depends on the success of these teams.|$|E
25|$|Militarily, Australians {{have served}} in {{numerous}} overseas wars, ranging from World War I through to recent regional security missions, such as East Timor, Iraq and Afghanistan. Australian war culture generally consists of sombre reflection and commemoration, focussing on noble sacrifice rather than glory. An annual national holiday, Anzac Day, exists for this purpose. The Australian experience of defeat in the Gallipoli Campaign, the first iconic moment in modern Australia's involvement in war, is viewed by Australians with both pride for the fighting of the soldiers, <b>and</b> <b>bitterness</b> for the perceived negligence {{on the part of}} British commanders. The incidences of bravery and determination displayed during the campaign for Gallipoli, as well as the mutual respect for their Turkish adversaries led by Kemal Atatürk, are seen as part of the ANZAC spirit. During the First World War, Australian soldiers were considered to be remarkably determined, united and hard-working. Many Australians knew how to ride and shoot prior to enlistment, making them talented recruits, but they were also infamous for their lax attitude towards formal parade ground discipline, a notoriety that the Australian soldiers revelled in. From this the notion of the larrikin Digger emerged, an important part of contemporary Australian identity.|$|E
