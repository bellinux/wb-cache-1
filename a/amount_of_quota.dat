40|$|The {{research}} for this paper was triggered by a stunning judgement of the Icelandic Supreme Court in December 1998, which declared as unconstitutional existing fisheries laws on individual transferable quotas (ITQs), because they privileged those who derived their fishing rights from ownership of vessels during a specific period over which their "fishing history" was established (Pálsson 1999, Copes 1999 a, Gudmundsdóttir 1999). In Iceland, as elsewhere, {{it has been the}} practice to start up ITQ systems by giving away quotas for free to individuals or companies owning licensed fishing vessels at the time an ITQ regime is introduced. The <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>quota</b> allocated to recipients is usually calculated in relation to their recent catch history. The Court decided that this privileged allocation violates both the constitutional provision against discrimination and the provision concerning the "right to work". This set the stage for intensified legal and political discussions in Iceland about ITQs. There are potential implications for the constitutionality or legality of similar systems elsewhere. The ruling is interesting, in its own right, to legal scholars, anthropologists, political scientists, and investigators concerned with common property regimes and public-trust doctrines. In our paper we explore emerging constitutional and political challenges to ITQ systems in Iceland, Canada and South America...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 1974 As {{the capital}} {{requirements}} for the modern dairy enterprise increase, the Oregon milk producer and his lender need more information concerning the profitability, solvency and liquidity of the enterprise {{on which to base}} their financial decisions. This research examines three areas where more information could be used to evaluate financial feasibility and credit use for Oregon dairy enterprises. The areas of investigation are (1) an analysis of factors important in determining the profitability of the enterprise, (2) an analysis of the alternatives for acquiring Oregon milk market quota and (3) an analysis of the risk that the dairy enterprise will not generate sufficient cash flows to meet various loan repayment requirements. For the first area of investigation the statistical technique of discriminant analysis was used to estimate a linear function using variables common to 63 sample dairy enterprises. The resulting discriminant function is the one that best separates the 63 observations into two groups, those with a net profit per cow greater than the mean average and those with a net profit per cow less than the mean. Fifty-seven of the 63 sample enterprises were correctly classified by the function. Standardizing the coefficients of the function revealed that production per cow, labor requirement (in minutes) per cow-day and the amount of concentrates per cow-day were the most important variables in correctly classifying the observations. The scaled discriminant function provides dairymen and their lenders with a method to assess the profit potential of an enterprise and to predict the effect of possible management changes on profit potential. Oregon milk market quota cannot only be bought and sold, subject to certain regulations, but can also be earned by producing and selling milk in excess of the produce rs quota allotment. Acquisition of additional quota increases the amount of milk sold at the higher quota blend price increasing the producer's revenue. Due to differences in the timing of cash flows, a present value analysis was used to determine which alternative for acquisition, purchase or earn, is most profitable for given sets of circumstances. The present value {{of the differences between the}} cash flows for the alternatives is the maximum amount a producer could profitably pay for some <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>quota</b> rather than earning it.

40|$|Abstract OnlyIn the Pacific Ocean, {{the total}} catch of {{skipjack}} tuna {{has been increasing}} rapidly. Then, eight of Polynesian, Melanesian, and Micronesian countries (PNA countries) have concluded a cooperative management of tuna fisheries. Although those countries do not catch a large amount by themselves, the main migrating area {{is included in the}} EEZ of those countries. Therefore, they can behave as a monopolist who sells fisheries rights to fishing countries. Different from other fishing countries, Japan has a specific feature: it catches skipjack tuna both in the EEZ of PNA countries and its own EEZ by using different fishing gears. Moreover, the stock in the EEZ of Japan depends on that of PNA countries, because small groups of one-year-old skipjacks leave the EEZ of PNA countries and go to the North. We apply the Non-cooperative Game Theory to this fisheries management. If there were no ‚“small groups”, the <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>quotas</b> sold to fishing countries would be insufficient in terms of total welfare of fishing and resource countries. However, the <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> catch may be excessive in the presence of the‚ “small groups. ” Therefore, we examine the strategies for Japan to improve both Japan‚ welfare and total welfare, such as unilateral vessel reduction, compensation schemes to other fishing countries, and contribution to the establishment of the surveillance system.

40|$|The {{abolition}} <b>of</b> dairy <b>quotas</b> in Europe in 2015 {{has been}} accompanied by uncertainty on expansion of the European dairy sector. Whereas the total <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>quotas</b> was limited and the value <b>of</b> <b>quotas</b> was falling before 2015, a significant part of active Dutch dairy farmers followed an expansion strategy in the recent past. Therefore, it was expected that the overall milk production in the Netherlands will substantially increase after abolishment <b>of</b> the <b>quota.</b> The objective <b>of</b> this study is to analyse which factors determine milk production expansion by Dutch dairy farmers. A conceptual model is developed that shows how policies, market conditions, and farmers’ values and goals affect their expansion decisions. This conceptual model shows that not only economic, but also social and environmental variables are important factors in expansion decisions of Dutch dairy farmers. Zooming in on the dynamic decision making process itself, we combine three investment theories to explain investment decisions. This framework is the basis for a dynamic random effects probit model that is used to estimate the effects of various economic, environmental and farm structural factors on farmers’ expansion behaviour. Data is obtained from the Dutch Farm Accountancy Data Network (FADN) covering the period 2001 through 2010, with 1390 observations on 354 dairy farms included in the sample. The results show that production intensity matters when analysing production expansion behaviour of Dutch dairy farms. Compared to extensive farms, intensive farms have a higher probability for milk production expansion. The availability of land however is an important precondition. Production diversification, which is usually found at extensive farms, decreases the probability for milk production expansion. Although the findings do not directly show an increase in milk production during the sample period (farmers still respected their quota limits), the results indicate that Dutch dairy farms can potentially increase milk production in the future. In 2010 farms underutilized their stable space, as the occupancy of stable space was 71 %. After milk quota abolishment farms can therefore increase livestock herd and milk production with limited investments...|$|R

More importantly, as the autonomous recruitment reform stresses on all-rounded students and inner qualities, it requires students to have various kinds of knowledge that rural students have difficulties in accumulating (Zheng 2008).
