40|$|Abstract. Members of {{the public}} are exposed to {{radiation}} because of where they live and their habits bring them into contact with sources of radiation.

40|$|Abstract. Should an {{important}} release of radionuclides {{occur in the}} environment, one would quickly have to assess radionuclide concentration in media and foodstuff, deduce the potential exposition of concerned populations to the radiations, predict {{the evolution of the}} situation and propose different scenarios of managing the contaminated zones. To achieve this, the ASTRAL code was created, which can be used by a relatively large group of people composing crisis centres or making predictive impact studies. The starting point of the assessments is the ground deposit of radionuclides: the atmospheric dispersion phase and the cloud exposure are not taken into account here. The calculations achieved concern time evolution of radionuclide concentration in compartments of the agricultural and forest food chain as well as <b>assessment</b> <b>of</b> <b>doses</b> due to external and internal exposure. These values are compared to regulation limits and/or intervention levels. Different simulations of contaminated zones management can be led by applying counter-measures, dispositions meant to reduce the accident’s impact on environment and populations.

40|$|AbstractEquipment {{being used}} in medical or {{industrial}} institutions is often a source of ionizing radiation with different energies and types, which complicates the detection and <b>assessment</b> <b>of</b> <b>doses.</b> Up until now, for dosimetric measurements of ionizing radiation, Gamma- 31 dosimeters {{have been used in}} the Central Mining Institute for many years. Now, this system will be expanded by a Panasonic system, for which measurement procedures were developed and comparisons with other dosimeters were held. The method is based on a four-element dosimeters UD- 802 Panasonic equipped with CaSO and LiBO detectors additionally sheltered by filters of different surface mass. The use of UD- 802 dosimeters, in contrast to Gamma- 31 dosimeters, permits measuring radiation doses in a different range of photon energy. Consequently, it is possible to obtain a more accurate analysis of the hazards caused by gamma radiation in underground mines. The publication includes a description of the dosimetry system and presents the results of measurements conducted by means of both types of dosimeters. In order to verify the correctness of the indications of the new dosimetry system a series of measurements were carried out, which allowed examining the behaviour of the dosimeters under different environmental conditions. As a place of exposure, the selected laboratories in the Silesian Centre for Environmental Radiometry were chosen, where the work is connected with (TE) NORM and equipment producing ionizing radiation or containing sources of this type of radiation. Moreover, to observe the dosimeters behaviour in difficult environmental conditions, they were exposed in water treatment plants and an underground potassium salt mine...|$|E
40|$|PURPOSE: The aim of {{this study}} is to achieve dose {{uniformity}} for intraluminal implants by <b>assessment</b> <b>of</b> <b>dose</b> distributions for single catheter generated by using various combinations of source stopping spacing and optimization mode. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A dose distribution was generated using HDR 192 Ir stepping source on single straight catheter of fixed length used for Intraluminal brachytherapy. The various combinations of source position spacing and optimization mode were used and these dose distributions were evaluated by using three different parameters. The source position spacings were 0. 2, 0. 5, 1. 0, 1. 4, 2. 0, 2. 5, 3. 0 and 3. 3 cm. Three different optimization modes that compute the source stopping times along the catheter were used. The parameters used for <b>assessment</b> <b>of</b> <b>dose</b> distributions were statistical analysis <b>of</b> <b>doses</b> to dose reference points, area under natural dose-volume histogram and the dose non-uniformity ratio. RESULTS: None of the combinations of source position spacing and optimization mode was able to generate the desired optimum uniform dose distribution. However in a discrete manner, comparatively higher uniform dose distribution was found with short (0. 2 cm) and longer (1. 5 to 2. 0 cm) source spacing. Optimization mode of Iterative correction was found to be suitable for the single catheter used in intraluminal brachytherapy. Conclusion: The applicator dimension and irradiation target volume should be taken in to consideration while selecting either higher or smaller source position spacing for the single catheter intraluminal brachytherapy.

40|$|This paper {{sets out}} {{guidelines}} for managing radiation exposure incidents involving patients in diagnostic and interventional radiology. The work {{is based on}} collation of experiences from representatives of international and national organizations for radiologists, medical physicists, radiographers, regulators, and equipment manufacturers, derived from an International Atomic Energy Agency Technical Meeting. More serious overexposures can result in skin doses high enough to produce tissue reactions, in interventional procedures and computed tomography, most notably from perfusion studies. A major factor involved has been deficiencies in training of staff in operation of equipment and optimization techniques. The use of checklists and time outs before procedures commence, and dose alerts when critical levels are reached during procedures can provide safeguards to reduce risks of these effects occurring. However, unintended and accidental overexposures resulting in relatively small additional doses can take place in any diagnostic or interventional X-ray procedure {{and it is important}} to learn from errors that occur, as these may lead to increased risks of stochastic effects. Such events may involve the wrong examinations, procedural errors, or equipment faults. Guidance is given on prevention, investigation and dose calculation for radiology exposure incidents within healthcare facilities. Responsibilities should be clearly set out in formal policies, and procedures should be in place to ensure that root causes are identified and deficiencies addressed. When an overexposure of a patient or an unintended exposure of a foetus occurs, the foetal, organ, skin and/or effective dose may be estimated from exposure data. When doses are very low, generic values for the examination may be sufficient, but a full <b>assessment</b> <b>of</b> <b>doses</b> to all exposed organs and tissues may sometimes be required. The use of general terminology to describe risks from stochastic effects is recommended rather than calculation of numerical values, as these are misleading when applied to individuals...|$|E
40|$|The present thesis investigates a {{range of}} dietary, {{physiological}} and environmental factors influencing transfer and long-term behaviour of radionuclides in reindeer and lynx. Feeding experiments were designed to provide details on factors related to absorption, retention and secretion of radionuclides in reindeer, while concentrations and time trends of radionuclides in the environment were studied in two reindeer herding districts during the period 2000 – 2003. Data on 137 Cs in reindeer from 1986 onwards and samples of lynx were obtained from national archives. In the first feeding experiment, reindeer calves were offered either combined diets of fallout contaminated lichens and pelleted concentrates applicable for clean feeding, or a pure lichen diet. Constant daily radiocaesium (134 Cs and 137 Cs) administration rates were used throughout the experiments. Due to lower dietary potassium and crude fibre intake, reindeer on the pure lichen diet had significantly lower excretion of radiocaesium and a 40 % longer biological half-time for radiocaesium in red blood cells than reindeer fed a diet with a higher mineral element content. The study showed that the bioavailability of Chernobyl radiocaesium in lichen was 35 % of that of 134 Cs as chloride in aqueous solution. The results were in agreement with previous studies demonstrating the effect of seasonal variations in potassium intake on radiocaesium retention in reindeer. A literature review of the many factors influencing transfer of radiocaesium to ruminants suggested that additional seasonally affected factors {{need to be taken}} into account in studies of reindeer, particularly the effects of digestibility and metabolic rates on absorption and endogenous faecal excretion of radiocaesium. In the second feeding experiment, four pregnant reindeer on a concentrate diet were given daily constant quantities of 134 Cs and 85 Sr as chlorides in aqueous solution during the last part of gestation. The experiment showed that similar fractions of the administered activities of 134 Cs and 85 Sr were transferred to the foetus, and 1. 4 – 2. 5 % of the total administered activities were deposited in the calves at birth. The distribution of the nuclides in different tissues of newborn calves was comparable to that reported in older calves. The transfer coefficients (F m) for 134 Cs and 85 Sr from diet to reindeer milk were as expected from extrapolated F m values observed in other ruminants, with F m for 134 Cs 8. 5 times higher that of 85 Sr. The influence of the mineral element intake, particularly K and Ca, on absorption of Cs and Sr in reindeer, suggests that transfer of the nuclides to foetus and milk of free-ranging reindeer may be considerable higher than observed in this experiment. Furthermore, secretion of Sr accumulated prior to the lactation period will probably cause higher Sr concentration in milk of free-ranging reindeer than indicated by the F m estimated in this experiment. No differences in halftimes for 134 Cs and 85 Sr secretion in milk were observed, with both nuclides secreted with short- and long-term half-times of 1 – 2 and 12 – 19 days, respectively. The study of 137 Cs, 90 Sr, 210 Po and 210 Pb in the environment included sampling of soil, vegetation and reindeer tissues in two climatically different reindeer herding districts, Østre Namdal and Vågå. These districts were among the areas in Norway most affected by fallout from the Chernobyl accident. The study showed that 137 Cs concentrations in reindeer from both areas declined by effective ecological half-times (T ecol) of 3 – 5 years in autumn and winter up to the mid and late 1990 s, when the rates of decline decreased possibly due to a reduced role of lichens as sources of absorbed 137 Cs in reindeer. Future time-trends may well be governed simply by physical decay, although incidences of high abundances of fungi may potentially cause elevated 137 Cs concentrations in reindeer in autumn for many years to come. Higher 137 Cs concentrations in vascular plants, lichens and reindeer in Østre Namdal compared to Vågå (relative to the 137 Cs deposition density), suggested that climatic influences on soil properties that influence the availability of 137 Cs for plant uptake and on lichen growth and abundance may have a larger impact on long-term transfer of radiocaesium in the soil-plant/lichen-reindeer food chain than has been previously observed. Furthermore, the results of this thesis suggest that various proportions of lichens and vascular plants in the diet may cause appreciable differences in transfer of radiocaesium to reindeer across Norway due to differences in radiocaesium, potassium and crude fibre intake. The samples of bone and antlers of reindeer of different ages showed that 90 Sr concentrations in bone of older females were 40 % higher than in calves due to higher dietary 90 Sr intake during their periods of growth (< 2 year) and continuous 90 Sr intake thereafter. Combined with previously reported data, a T ecol of 9. 03 ± 0. 06 years was estimated for 90 Sr concentrations in antlers of reindeer calves in Vågå for the period 1988 – 2002. The study supports the use of antlers as monitors of 90 Sr concentrations instead of bone, since concentrations in bone appear to be significantly influenced by age and constant bone renewal. Concentrations of 90 Sr were 50 – 80 % higher in reindeer from Vågå compared to those from Østre Namdal. Age did not appear to have a major effect on muscle and liver tissue 210 Po and 210 Pb concentrations in reindeer from Østre Namdal and Vågå. Concentrations of 210 Po and 210 Pb were similar in the two districts and to previously reported values from other Nordic areas. Thus, climatic differences did not have noticeable effects on 210 Po and 210 Pb concentrations in reindeer in this study. The study of 137 Cs in muscle samples of 747 lynxes killed in Norway from the 1986 Chernobyl accident up to the year 2001 showed that a model with 137 Cs deposition density, the year lynxes were killed, age, and extent of reindeer grazing area in the lynxes’ home ranges could account for 50 % of the variability in observed 137 Cs concentrations. The analyses were equivocal regarding the lynxes’ specialization in prey species. Further work on the possible use of radiocaesium as a tracer of reindeer predation by lynxes require experimental data on Cs retention in lynx and better estimates of deposition density in the lynxes’ home ranges. The calculated absorbed doses to reindeer from both anthropogenic and natural nuclides suggested that some of the most exposed individuals received dose rates approaching 1 mGy d - 1 after the Chernobyl fallout. No effects on morbidity, mortality or reproductive capacity of reindeer would be expected from these doses. Only the lynxes with the highest radiocaesium concentrations received doses comparable to those received by reindeer. The <b>assessment</b> <b>of</b> <b>doses</b> to humans from the studied radionuclides showed that 137 Cs continues to be the most important contributor to ingestion doses by South Saamis. The time trend in 137 Cs concentrations in the studied reindeer herding districts suggests that ingestion doses by persons with average Saami consumption rates of reindeer meat will continue to exceed the 1990 recommendation by the International Commission on Radiological Protection for many years to come, if countermeasures are not applied.

Environment assessment is one very important issues related to protection of environment from radionuclide’s. The amount to be released which may have typical concentrations of radionuclide’s of natural origin, or artificial origin may generate products or wastes that have higher concentrations of radionuclide’s or give rise to exposures that should not be excluded from regulatory control. Uranium (U) and thorium (Th) and their decay chain daughter radionuclide are the radionuclide of primary interest released from nuclear installations as well as several other radionuclide’s as Cs for different radioisotopes. For an appropriate <b>assessment</b> <b>of</b> <b>dose</b> to public and workers (occupational staff) it is necessary that following elements shall be taken into account for release of the bulk amount of contaminated water into the sea.

Activity concentrations, Total activity and types of radionuclide released Type of radionuclides, Types of radiations, Radio toxicity, Salt extracting, Swimming, Natural evaporations and raining etc...|$|R
40|$|Both {{industry}} and regulators {{are interested in}} standardized methods, which can rapidly assess any MO or their subcomponents (or product formulation) for in vivo-relevant toxicological effects. In previous research, we focussed on developing in vitro approaches, which parallel <b>assessment</b> <b>of</b> <b>dose</b> effects <b>of</b> chemical contaminants (9, 14, 16), and allow quantification of cell/tissue specific multi-gene/protein indicators to inform on mode of toxification or immunologic effects. Here, we covered research approaches that {{make use of the}} latest advances in genomics of Bc group organisms and comparative murine and human immuno- and toxico- genomics/proteomics knowledge, and tools, which allows us to harmonize again with chemical testing, and earlier Bc group clinical tests and infection studies involving mouse models (6, 7). The genotyping by microarray analysis validates the relatedness of Bt strains to Bc 14579 (type strain), and also sharing of a number of factors that could be possibly engineered out of future biotech strains, if needed. This approach may be very important in addressing quorum-sensing factors (e. g., germination, chemotaxic signal factors, and pleiotropic regulator...|$|R
40|$|The <b>assessment</b> <b>of</b> patient <b>dose</b> {{has gained}} {{increased}} attention, still being {{an issue of}} concern that arises {{from the use of}} digital systems. The development of digital technology offers the possibility for a reduction <b>of</b> radiation <b>dose</b> around 50 % without loss in image quality when compared to a conventional screen–film system. Digital systems give an equivalent or superior diagnostic performance and also several other advantages, but the risk of overexposure with no adverse effect on image quality could be present. This chapter refers to the management <b>of</b> patient <b>dose</b> and provides an explanation of dose-related concepts. In this chapter, exposure influence in dose and image representation and the effects of radiation exposure are also discussed...|$|R
