Meanwhile, Karen returns to work after her fall, but has changed drastically. She has become more confident and has developed better dress sense. Boyce ends up missing Alan, after his replacement {{turns out to be}} even more horrible. With Joanna gone, the office girls start to run riot, as in The Lord of the Flies. They form their own tribe and become hostile to anyone who enters the department.|$|E

25|$|However, a massive-star {{system could}} be a {{progenitor}} of life in another way – the supernova explosion of the massive star in {{the central part of}} the system. This supernova will disperse heavier elements throughout its vicinity, created during the phase when the massive star has moved off of the main sequence, and the systems of the potential low-mass stars (which <b>are</b> <b>still</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> main sequence) within the former massive-star system may be enriched with the relatively large supply of the heavy elements so close to a supernova explosion. However, this states nothing about what types of planets would form as a result of the supernova material, or what their habitability potential would be.|$|E
25|$|Major {{improvements}} {{continue to}} regenerate the city centre.

Further major developments are potentially afoot, particularly the Swanswell Project, which is intended to deepen Swanswell Pool and link it to Coventry Canal Basin, coupled with the creation of an urban marina and a wide Parisian-style boulevard. A possible second phase of the Phoenix Initiative is also in the offing, although both of these plans <b>are</b> <b>still</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> drawing-board.

25|$|At {{the time}} of the 1984 {{addition}} to the Round Barn MPS Stephenson County, Illinois had more round barns than any other county in the United States. Of the 31 round barns constructed in the four county area that makes up the Stephenson County area for the purpose of the MPS, 21 are found within the borders of Stephenson County. The other ten are spread out over Winnebago County, Illinois, Green County, Wisconsin and Rock County, Wisconsin. The 21 barns in the county exceeds the 18 round barns in Vernon County, Wisconsin and the 12 round barns in Fulton County, Indiana. On the original January 1984 nomination seven round barns were included in the Stephenson County area, of those six were added to the MPS and, thus, the National Register of Historic Places. As of 2007 five of the six round barns listed in 1984 <b>are</b> <b>still</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Register. They are: the Dennis Otte Round Barn, the Gerald Harbach Round Barn, James Bruce Round Barn, Chris Jensen Round Barn and the Charles Fehr Round Barn. The Robert Weber Round Barn is in nearby Winnebago County.|$|E
500|$|The episode {{received}} mixed critical reviews, with [...] "Tweenlight" [...] generally being {{regarded as}} the best segment. John Griffiths of Us Weekly gave the episode three stars, writing that [...] "the three oddball tales run from mildly amusing to flat-out inspired. In one goofy vignette, Homer and a bikini-wearing Marge pluck a scary mystery man from the sea. However, watching Lisa crush on a brooding vampire in a dead-on poke at Twilight is the hilarious treat here." [...] Fred Topel of Screen Junkies wrote, [...] "The best jokes in all the segments are actually not the spoofs. They’re the cartoon physical comedy, the references to mundane frustrations like having to be the thimble when playing Monopoly. It’s also super gory. [...] I think “The Simpsons” <b>are</b> <b>still</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> creative upswing since The Simpsons Movie and this “Treehouse of Horrors” would hold up with classics like [...] "The Shinning" [...] and [...] "The Homega Man." [...] Brad Trechak of TV Squad {{felt that it was}} one of the best Treehouse of Horrors in years. He wrote, [...] "Of the three vignettes, the first segment 'War and Pieces,' while not the best, was the most original despite being a variation of the plot of 'Jumanji.' Unlike that book/movie, instead of the game coming into the real world, the game brings other board games into the real world. The satire on this show remains sharp as none of the games had the same name as their real world counterparts to prevent toy company litigation against Fox. [...] The final segment 'Tweenlight'... was the best of the three. It felt a little less dated than the first two." ...|$|E
