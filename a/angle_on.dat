5|$|Because the Earth's axis is tilted {{relative}} to its orbital plane, sunlight is incident at different angles {{at different times}} of the year. In June the Northern Hemisphere is tilted towards the sun, so at any given Northern Hemisphere latitude sunlight falls more directly on that spot than in December (see Effect of sun <b>angle</b> <b>on</b> climate). This effect causes seasons. Over thousands to hundreds of thousands of years, changes in Earth's orbital parameters affect the amount and distribution of solar energy received by the Earth and influence long-term climate.

Angle {{then went on to}} defeat Bernard in a singles match at New Japan's ISM tour on February 15. After Hiroshi Tanahashi retained the IWGP Heavyweight Championship against Nakamura in the main event, Angle challenged him for the title, which Tanahashi accepted.

5|$|Following Armageddon, Orton {{entered the}} 2006 Royal Rumble match as the thirtieth and final wrestler, {{but he was}} {{eliminated}} by Rey Mysterio. Mysterio won the match and a title shot, and Orton urged him to put the title shot at stake in a match at No Way Out. In the weeks preceding No Way Out, Orton made controversial remarks about Eddie Guerrero, Mysterio's friend who had died a few months previously, {{in an attempt to}} gain villain heat. Many fans felt the comments were highly distasteful so soon after Guerrero's death in November 2005. Orton won at No Way Out, earning Mysterio's title shot for the World Heavyweight Championship at WrestleMania 22. General Manager Theodore Long re-added Mysterio to the WrestleMania 22 title match, however, making it a triple threat match between Orton, Mysterio, and then-champion, Kurt <b>Angle.</b> <b>On</b> April 2, at WrestleMania 22, Orton was pinned by Mysterio, making Mysterio the World Heavyweight Champion and ending their on-screen rivalry.|$|E
5|$|Later in the night, Styles and Tomko helped Angle {{retain the}} TNA title during {{the main event}} as Cage looked on from the ramp. Styles and Tomko were later {{announced}} as members of Angle's new group, The Angle Alliance, {{which led to a}} title match between the two on January 6, 2008 at TNA's Final Resolution PPV event, and also turning into a fan favorite in the process. On the January 3, 2008 episode of Impact!, Tomko left both Christian's Coalition and The Angle Alliance. Cage failed to win the title at Final Resolution, as a result of Styles' betraying and attacking him during the bout, thus ending Christian's Coalition. Cage got a rematch against <b>Angle</b> <b>on</b> February 10, 2008 at TNA's Against All Odds PPV event with Samoa Joe as the special outside enforcer. He once again was defeated by Angle as this time Tomko interfered and cost Cage the match.|$|E
5|$|On 24 November 1939, Hanbury Brown wrote a memo on Suggestions for Fighter Control by RDF {{calling for}} {{a new type of}} radar that would {{directly}} display both the target aircraft and the intercepting fighter, allowing ground controllers to directly control the fighter without need for interpretation. The solution was to mount a radar on a motorized platform so it rotated continually, sweeping the entire sky. A motor in the CRT display would rotate the beam deflection plates in synchronicity, so blips seen when the antenna was at a particular angle would be displayed at the same <b>angle</b> <b>on</b> the scope display. Using a phosphor that lasted at least one rotation, blips for all targets within range would be drawn on the display at their correct relative angles, producing a map-like image known as a PPI. With both the bombers and fighters now appearing on the same display, the radar operator could now direct an intercept directly, eliminating all of the delays.|$|E

On June 24, 2014, a mere five days after regaining the X Division Championship for his fifth reign, Austin Aries invoked Option C once again, but failed to defeat then champion Lashley. On May 10, 2015, one day after regaining the title for his second reign, Rockstar Spud invoked Option C, and was defeated by then champion Kurt <b>Angle.</b> <b>On</b> the July 5, 2016 episode of Impact Wrestling, World Heavyweight Champion Lashley offered a winner take all match to X Division Champion Eddie Edwards in lieu of Edwards invoking Option C.

The lead-up to this decision began at TNA's previous PPV event Bound for Glory on October 12. There, Sting defeated Angle to win the TNA World Heavyweight Championship. On the October 25 episode of Impact!, with help from Nash, Angle defeated Sting to win back the title. Due to the controversial circumstances, Cornette announced that Angle would defend the title in a tag team match, in which the person that got the pinfall or submission would win the title.|$|E

5|$|The second {{main event}} {{resulted}} from events on SmackDown!, WWE's other main television program. In the match, Kurt Angle defended his WWE Championship against Brock Lesnar. The build-up to the match began on July 31, 2003 on {{an episode of}} SmackDown!. During an interview promotion in the ring, Lesnar challenged Angle to a rematch of their bout at Vengeance, WWE's previous pay-per-view event. The WWE Chairman, Vince McMahon, decided that Lesnar would have to earn his rematch by competing in a steel cage match against McMahon himself, and would take place on SmackDown! the following week, with Angle officiating as a special guest referee. The Steel Cage match resulted in neither wrestler winning the match, after McMahon and Lesnar attacked <b>Angle.</b> <b>On</b> August 14, 2003 during an episode of SmackDown!, McMahon announced that Angle would defend the championship against Lesnar at SummerSlam.|$|E
5|$|The sparsely-spotted {{stingray}} {{has a more}} or less diamond-shaped {{pectoral fin}} disc wider than long, with rounded outer corners. The anterior margins of the disc are nearly straight and converge at an obtuse <b>angle</b> <b>on</b> the fleshy snout, the tip of which barely protrudes from the disc. The small eyes are immediately followed by comma-shaped spiracles with angular or rounded posterior rims. The outer rim of each nostril is enlarged into a knob towards the back. Between the nostrils is a bell-shaped curtain of skin with a finely fringed trailing margin; only the Kapala stingaree (U.kapalensis) has a similarly shaped nasal curtain. The small mouth contains five or six papillae (nipple-like structures) on the floor, most of which have forked tips. Additional small papillae are present {{on the outside of the}} lower jaw. The teeth in both jaws are small with roughly oval bases, and are arranged in a quincunx pattern. The five pairs of gill slits are short. The pelvic fins are small and rounded.|$|E

5|$|A Six Man Tag Team Full Metal Mayhem match {{followed}} pitting {{the team}} of Kurt Angle and Team 3D against A.J. Styles, Christian Cage, and Rhino. The duration of the contest was 15 minutes and 55 seconds. In this bout, {{the only way to}} win was by pinfall or submission, all weapons were legal and encouraged, and there were no disqualifications. Cage ascended the steel supports left behind from the Ultimate X match during the bout to jump off in an aerial splash onto both members of Team 3D and Angle. Each participant of the match was forced through a table during the bout except Angle. Rhino was the first by Team 3D, followed by Cage also by Team 3D. Each member of Team 3D were then forced through a table by Styles. After this, Johnny Devine interfered in the encounter on Team 3D's behalf by attempting to hit Styles with a kendo stick, only to be kicked in the head by Styles. Later, Styles laid <b>Angle</b> <b>on</b> a table and ascended a ladder. At this time, Frank Trigg interfered by hitting Styles over the head with the kendo stick, allowing Angle to force Styles through the set-up table with his signature Olympic Slam maneuver for the pinfall victory.|$|E
5|$|Another {{featured}} bout on the undercard pitted Kurt Angle against John Cena. On the September 18 {{episode of}} SmackDown, Angle lost an Iron Man match to Brock Lesnar for the WWE Championship. The match marked {{the third time}} that Angle defended the title against Lesnar with the first being WrestleMania XIX where Lesnar won the title and the second being SummerSlam which Angle retained. The next week on SmackDown, Angle tried to call Lesnar out to the ring, demanding a rematch, but instead Cena came to the ring and attacked <b>Angle.</b> <b>On</b> the October 2 episode of SmackDown, two of the primary rivalries on SmackDown intertwined in a tag team match, where Lesnar and Cena faced the team of Angle and the Undertaker, which Cena and Lesnar won after Cena struck Angle with a chain. The next week on SmackDown, a rap battle took place between Cena and Angle, in which both men performed raps insulting each other.

Styles defeated Angle to win the medal on the telecast. Styles and Angle fought a week later on the August 21 episode of Impact! in a ladder match for the medal, with Styles retaining the medal. Styles {{then went on to}} feud with Angle's on-screen bestfriend Frank Trigg, who attacked Styles with a kendo stick during Styles' Four Ways to Glory qualification match with Cage, costing Styles to bout in the process. This led to Styles challenging Trigg to a bout at No Surrender, which Trigg agreed to but only if it was contested under Mixed Martial Arts rules on the September11 episode of Impact!. Styles and Trigg fought to a no contest at No Surrender due to Styles accidentally hitting Trigg in the groin. Afterwards, Styles beat Trigg with a kendo stick to end their feud. On the September25 episode of Impact!, Styles was ordered to return Angle's gold medal by Jeff Jarrett, who had taken a role as a TNA management authority figure.
