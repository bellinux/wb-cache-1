25|$|The EMS {{system in}} New Zealand {{is served by}} three <b>dispatch</b> <b>centres,</b> located in Auckland, Wellington, and Christchurch. The <b>dispatch</b> <b>centre</b> in Christchurch {{provides}} coverage to the entire South Island, and is operated by St. John Ambulance. The <b>dispatch</b> <b>centre</b> in Auckland provides coverage for the north half of North Island, and is also operated by St. John Ambulance. The <b>dispatch</b> <b>centre</b> in Wellington provides coverage for the southern half of the North Island, is jointly operated by Wellington Free Ambulance and St John Ambulance but is staffed by Wellington Free Ambulance personnel. All three <b>dispatch</b> <b>centres</b> collaborate, and are capable of handling overflow of call volume for one another. The call centre technology is fully integrated and seamless, providing a single, 'virtual' national <b>dispatch</b> <b>centre.</b> To illustrate, if an emergency has occurred in Christchurch but those 111 lines are all busy, the call will be forwarded to the <b>dispatch</b> <b>centres</b> in either Auckland or Wellington. The call will be answered, information gathered, and placed into the computer network. It will then appear as a pending call on the desk of the appropriate dispatcher in Christchurch, all seamlessly.|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{investigate}} whether Helicopter-Mobile Medical Teams (H-MMTs or HEMS) are optimally deployed in all emergency <b>dispatch</b> <b>centres.</b> DESIGN: Descriptive, retrospective. METHOD: Initially, we assessed whether data from different ambulance regions {{could be compared}} effectively if they {{were related to the}} number of inhabitants per region. Data concerning the number of inhabitants, number of deaths caused by trauma, number of traffic accidents with injury, number ofemergency call-outs by ambulance services and H-MMT deployment were collected from several governmental databases for the period 2002 - 2005. The correlation coefficients between these data and the number of inhabitants were calculated. Subsequently, we determined the number of H-MMT deployments per 100, 000 inhabitants per year per emergency <b>dispatch</b> <b>centre.</b> The number of H-MMT dispatches from the 4 H-MMT coordinating <b>dispatch</b> <b>centres</b> was compared to the number of dispatches from the 17 other emergency <b>dispatch</b> <b>centres.</b> RESULTS: There was a strong correlation between the number of deaths caused by trauma, the number of traffic accidents with injury, emergency call-outs from ambulance services, and the number of inhabitants per region (correlation coefficients: 0. 90 - 0. 98). On average there were 2664 H-MMT calls per year. The average number of H-MMT calls per emergency <b>dispatch</b> <b>centre</b> per year was 110 (range: 2 - 403). The number of H-MMT deployments per 100, 000 inhabitants per year was 10. 5 (0. 9 - 27. 8). Emergency <b>dispatch</b> <b>centres</b> coordinating H-MMTs conducted significantly more H-MMT calls with a lower cancellation rate. CONCLUSION: By relating the deployment of H-MMTs with the number of inhabitants per region, a comparison can be made of the deployment frequencies in different emergency dispatch regions. The deployment of H-MMTs proved to differ significantly between emergency <b>dispatch</b> <b>centres...</b>|$|R

50|$|All {{emergency}} calls, {{regardless of}} the emergency number on which they originate, are routed to Dispatch Centres; in German Leitstelle. Until the year 2000 it was very common that every district had its own <b>dispatch</b> <b>centre</b> which, in a way, was quite ineffective. At present more and more trans-regional <b>dispatch</b> <b>centres</b> are being built. That means that all 144 calls in Styria, for example, are routed to the same <b>dispatch</b> <b>centre</b> in Graz no matter where in Styria the caller is located. The same trend {{can be seen in}} other federal states. A system similar to the U.S.-based 9-1-1 Public Safety Answering Point concept is not being used due to the significantly different nature of the calls for EMS, the fire brigade or the police.|$|R

40|$|International audienceBACKGROUND: Acute {{allergic}} reactions often occur in out-of-hospital settings, {{and some of}} these reactions may cause death in the short term. However, initial diagnosis, management and processing of acute {{allergic reactions}} by Medical Emergency <b>Dispatch</b> <b>Centres</b> are not documented. The aim {{of the present study was}} to describe acute allergic reactions and their management by a Medical Emergency <b>Dispatch</b> <b>Centre.</b> METHODS: A prospective study was conducted from 20 August 2006 to 5 November 2006 on incoming calls for acute allergic reactions to the Medical Emergency <b>Dispatch</b> <b>Centre</b> for the Hauts de Seine (Paris West suburb, France). The agreement between initial diagnosis (made by dispatching physician) and final diagnosis (made by the physician who later examined the patient), and between initial and final severity, were evaluated using Cohen's weighted κ coefficient. RESULTS: 210 calls were included. The diagnoses made by the dispatching physician were: in 58. 1 % of cases urticaria, in 23. 8 % angioedema, in 13. 3 % laryngeal oedema, and in 1. 9 % anaphylactic shock. The agreement between initial and final diagnoses was evaluated by a κ coefficient at 0. 44 (95 % CI 0. 26 to 0. 61) and the agreement between initial and final severity was evaluated using a κ coefficient at 0. 37 (95 % CI 0. 24 to 0. 50). CONCLUSIONS: Only moderate agreement is highlighted between the initial severity assessed by the dispatching physician and the final severity assessed by the physician later examining the patient. This demonstrates the need to develop a tool for assessing severity of acute allergic reactions for dispatching physicians in Medical Emergency <b>Dispatch</b> <b>Centres...</b>|$|R
