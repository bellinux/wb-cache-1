At the northern edge of the town, the route has employee-only access to the Goddard Space Flight Center, the first NASA space flight center opened in 1958 that contributed majorly to many space missions; from here, the route then enters the Beltsville Agricultural Research Center, the largest agricultural research center in the world owned by the United States Department of Agriculture.

25|$|Radioteletype (RTTY) is a {{telecommunications}} system consisting originally {{of two or}} more electromechanical teleprinters in different locations connected by radio rather than a wired link. These machines were superseded by personal computers (PCs) running software to emulate teleprinters. Radioteletype evolved from earlier landline teleprinter operations that began in the mid-1800s. The US Navy Department successfully tested printing telegraphy between <b>an</b> <b>airplane</b> <b>and</b> ground radio station in 1922. Later that year, the Radio Corporation of America successfully tested printing telegraphy via their Chatham, Massachusetts, radio station to the R.M.S. Majestic. Commercial RTTY systems were in active service between San Francisco and Honolulu as early as April 1932 and between San Francisco and New York City by 1934. The US military used radioteletype in the 1930s and expanded this usage during World War II. From the 1980s, teleprinters were replaced by computers running teleprinter emulation software.|$|E

The US Department of the Navy successfully tested printing telegraphy between <b>an</b> <b>airplane</b> <b>and</b> ground {{radio station in}} August 1922. Later that year, the Radio Corporation of America successfully tested printing telegraphy via their Chatham, MA radio station to the R.M.S. Majestic. An early implementation of the Radioteletype was the Watsongraph, named after Detroit inventor Glenn Watson in March 1931. Commercial RTTY systems were in active service between San Francisco and Honolulu as early as April 1932 and between San Francisco and New York City by 1934. The US Military used radioteletype in the 1930s and expanded this usage during World War II. The Navy called radioteletype RATT (Radio Automatic Teletype) and the Army Signal Corps called radioteletype SCRT, an abbreviation of Single-Channel Radio Teletype. The military used frequency shift keying technology and this technology proved very reliable even over long distances.|$|E
25|$|The Army {{detailed}} Lahm to {{the fledgling}} Aeronautical Division, a {{section in the}} Office of the Chief Signal Officer (OCSO), on September 17, 1907, {{while he was still}} in Europe. His departure from France was delayed after a relapse of the typhoid he contracted in the spring of 1907 and he took convalescent leave at a rest home in St. Germain. It was in the home's garden on August 1, 1907, the very day that the Aeronautical Division came into being, that Lahm's father introduced him to Wilbur and Orville Wright. The elder Lahm had personally investigated the claims of the brothers and had been quietly promoting them among his colleagues in France since 1905. The meeting {{was the beginning of a}} friendship that lasted until the two brothers died. Lahm learned that the Army, through the reluctance and disinterest of the Board of Ordnance and Fortification, had obstructed the attempts of the Wright Brothers to provide the Army with <b>an</b> <b>airplane,</b> <b>and</b> immediately wrote his new superior, Chief Signal Officer (CSO) Brig. Gen. James Allen (who sat on the board), urging that favorable consideration be given their most recent proposal.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to summer camps, the camp has also hosted diverse Scouting events.

On May 3, 2008 the camp hosted more than 4,000 at the council-wide spring camporee, which included a visit from McGruff the Crime Dog. On May 28-29, 2016 the camp hosted the joint Jewish and Islamic Committee on Scouting Annual Camporee. On October 29, 2016 the camp hosted simulations of both <b>an</b> <b>airplane</b> <b>and</b> a school bus crash where volunteer victims acted out fictional injuries for Scouts to practice emergency aid skills. More than 1,000 Scouts and leaders from the Bull Run, Occoquan, Patriot and Sully Districts participated along with representatives from the Amangamek Wipit Lodge, American Red Cross, Asymmetric Warfare Group, Aviation Institute of Maintenance, Cookies and Cream, Fairfax County Sheriff's Office, George Mason Reserve Officers' Training Corps Cadets, Halloween Spirit Store, Lowe's, Outback Steakhouse, Prince William County Department of Fire and Rescue, Prince William County Police Department, Shawn Landry & Quality Business Engineering, and the Virginia Airborne Search and Rescue Squad.

500|$|During this period, University of Texas {{students}} attempted several stunts, {{trying to}} light the stack early, but to no avail. In both 1933 and 1948, students from UT rented <b>an</b> <b>airplane</b> <b>and</b> tried to drop fire bombs onto the stack. In one of these instances, the plane ran low on fuel, {{and was forced to}} land at Easterwood Airport in College Station—the wooden portions of the plane found themselves part of Bonfire that year. In 1956, there was an unsuccessful attempt to plant explosives at the Bonfire site, and, in the late 1970s, a College Station police officer was fired after trying to ignite the bonfire several days ahead of schedule. Students spotted the officer before he could succeed and chased him across campus. In 1999, a Longhorn fan hired someone to build a six-foot model airplane designed to carry a bomb into the wood stack to ignite it prematurely. [...] "He was actually in the process of building that plane when they had the tragedy at bonfire", Mel Stekoll said. [...] "At that point, we scrapped the plan.
