In March 1916, UB-13 was responsible for sinking the Dutch ocean liner , raising the ire of the Dutch public. Tubantia was the largest neutral vessel sunk {{during the war and}} among the 30 largest ships sunk by U-boats. On 24 April 1916, UB-13 was sunk with all hands.|$|E
5|$|The South Pacific Ocean basin runs between 160°E and 120°W, with {{tropical}} cyclones {{developing in}} it officially {{monitored by the}} Fiji Meteorological Service and New Zealand's MetService. Tropical Cyclones that develop within this basin generally affect countries {{to the west of}} the dateline, though during El Niños cyclones have been known to develop to the east of the dateline near French Polynesia. On average the basin sees nine tropical cyclones annually with <b>about</b> <b>half</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> becoming severe tropical cyclones.|$|E
5|$|The final {{source of}} supply was Allied air drops. This {{was the only way}} to obtain more exotic, highly useful {{equipment}} such as plastic explosives and antitank weapons such as the British PIAT. During the war, 485 air-drop missions from the West (<b>about</b> <b>half</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> flown by Polish airmen) delivered some 600 tons of supplies for the Polish resistance. Besides equipment, the planes also parachuted in highly qualified instructors (Silent Unseen), 316 of whom were inserted into Poland during the war.|$|E

5|$|From 1848 {{to the end}} of the 19th century, local Polish and Czech people co-operated, united {{against the}} Germanizing tendencies of the Austrian Empire and later of Austria-Hungary. At the end of the century, ethnic {{tensions}} arose as the area's economic significance grew. This growth caused a wave of immigration from Galicia. About 60,000 people arrived between 1880 and 1910. The new immigrants were Polish and poor, <b>about</b> <b>half</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> being illiterate. They worked in coal mining and metallurgy. For these people the most important factor was material well-being; they cared little about the homeland from which they had fled. Almost all of them assimilated into the Czech population. Many of them settled in Ostrava (west of the ethnic border), as heavy industry was spread through the whole western part of Cieszyn Silesia. Even today, ethnographers find that about 25,000 people in Ostrava (about 8% of the population) have Polish surnames.|$|E
5|$|Palau's {{interaction}} with Japan was {{kept to a}} minimal level during the post-war years, although Okinawan fishermen occasionally visited Palau for catches from the 1960s onwards. A few Japanese nationals resettled in Palau in the 1970s, and married local Palauans. In the 1980s, Japanese businessmen set up businesses in Palau, and by 1995 there were 218 Japanese nationals residing in Palau. Of these, <b>about</b> <b>half</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> expressed a desire for permanent residency in Palau and a few married Palauan or Filipino women. However, the majority brought their families from Japan along, and maintained frequent contacts with Japan. Some settlers from the 1980s also consisted of former Japanese settlers who were repatriated back to Japan after World War II. Former settlers who returned to Palau usually consisted of individuals over 60 years of age, and often worked as tour guides or restaurateurs in Palau.|$|E
5|$|From 1848, the {{national}} {{consciousness of the}} local people grew and from 1848 {{to the end of}} the 19th century local Poles and Czechs co-operated, uniting against the Germanizing tendencies of the Austrian Empire, and later of Austria-Hungary. Various Polish clubs were founded. Most schools were Polish, followed by German and Czech. At the end of the century, ethnic tensions appeared as the area's economic significance grew. This growth caused a wave of immigration from Galicia, when about 60,000 people arrived and settled between 1880 and 1910. They settled mainly in the Ostrau region, but also in Zaolzie. The new immigrants were Polish and poor, <b>about</b> <b>half</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> being illiterate, and worked mostly in coal mining and metallurgy. For these people, the most important factor was material well-being; they cared little about the homeland from which they had fled, more readily assimilating into the Czech population which was demographically dominant in the Ostrava region in the heart of Czech Silesia. The social structure of the territory was generally divided along ethnic lines. Germans were economically strongest, mostly owners, Czechs were mostly clerks and other officials, and Poles were mostly manual workers, miners, and metallurgists. This structure had changed over time but in 1921 it was still very similar, with 61.5% of Poles working as labourers.|$|E

25|$|Sir John French’s {{orders from}} Kitchener were to {{cooperate}} with the French but not to take orders from them. Given that the tiny BEF (<b>about</b> 100,000 men, <b>half</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> serving regulars and half reservists) was Britain’s only field army, Lord Kitchener also instructed French to avoid undue losses and exposure to “forward movements where large numbers of French troops are not engaged” until Kitchener himself had had a chance to discuss the matter with the Cabinet.|$|R

25|$|With {{the coming}} of the spring of 1577, the {{fighting}} began anew. The Danzig army, led by the German mercenary commander Johann Winkelbruch (Hans Winckelburg von Kölln), was about 7,000-12,000 strong (including mercenaries, among them a Scottish regiment), but with less than 1,000 cavalry. Winckelburg decided to crush the small army of Zborowski (who had <b>about</b> 2,000 men, <b>half</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> cavalry), but the Danzig army was utterly defeated by Zborowski in the battle of Lubiszewo on April 17, 1577.|$|R
50|$|Following the {{outbreak}} of war as Georgian troops entered Abkhazia in August 1992, the Confederation held its 11th parliamentary session in Grozny.

25|$|The Soviet {{annexation}} {{was accompanied}} by the widespread arrests of government officials, police, military personnel, border guards, teachers, priests, judges etc., followed by the NKVD prisoner massacres and massive deportation of 320,000 Polish nationals to the Soviet interior and the Gulag slave labor camps where, {{as a result of}} the inhuman conditions, <b>about</b> <b>half</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> died before the end of war.|$|E
40|$|In January 2015, Germany {{introduced}} a federal, {{statutory minimum wage}} of 8. 50 2 ̆ 0 ac per hour. This study evaluates {{the effects of this}} policy on regular and marginal employment and on welfare dependency. Based on county-level administrative data, this study uses the difference-in-differences technique, exploiting regional variation in the bite of the minimum wage, i. e. the county-specific share of employees paid less than 8. 50 2 ̆ 0 ac before the introduction of the minimum wage. The minimum wage had a considerable negative effect on marginal employment. There is also some indication that regular employment was slightly reduced. Concerning welfare dependency, the minimum wage reduced the number of working welfare recipients, with some indication that <b>about</b> one <b>half</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> left welfare receipt due to the minimum wage...|$|R
50|$|Ellison was 18 {{years old}} when the United States decided to enter World War I in Europe in 1917 and {{immigration}} from Europe to the United States virtually stopped.
