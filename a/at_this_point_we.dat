When Tada discovered this {{the next day}} he ordered Yanagawa to stop immediately, but was ignored. Matsui made some effort to restrain Yanagawa, but also told him that he could send some advance units beyond the line. In fact, Matsui was highly sympathetic with Yanagawa's actions and a few days later on November 22 Matsui issued an urgent telegram to the Army General Staff insisting that [...] "To resolve this crisis in a prompt manner we need {{to take advantage of the}} enemy's present declining fortunes and conquer Nanking ...

Since the physical situation has not changed, only the frame in which things are observed, the test particle should not be attracted towards either stream. But {{it is not at all}} clear that the forces exerted on the test particle are equal. (1) Since the bottom stream is moving faster than the top, each particle in the bottom stream has a larger mass energy than a particle in the top. (2) Because of Lorentz contraction, there are more particles per unit length in the bottom stream than in the top stream. (3) Another contribution to the active gravitational mass of the bottom stream comes from an additional pressure term which, <b>at</b> <b>this</b> <b>point,</b> <b>we</b> do not have sufficient background to discuss.
