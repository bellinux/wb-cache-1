40|$|Farmers are {{increasingly}} interested in high-value alternatives to commodity production. Direct marketing is a potentially <b>attractive</b> <b>marketing</b> alternative, having {{been shown to}} offer increased net incomes to farmers. Nevertheless, there is a dearth of literature on the determinants {{of the decision to}} direct market. This paper uses an ordered logit regression to analyze how farm size, the importance of high-value crops, organic production, experience, and demographic factors affect a producer’s reliance on direct markets. The results show that farm size, high-value crop production, non-certi-fied organic production methods, and household size are determinants of the share of total farm output sold though direct marketing outlets. Farmers in Virginia, as in many areas, are interested in high-value alternatives to commodity production. Agriculture in Virginia is highly diversified, but there is broad recognition that few farmers in the state are able to compete effectively with large-scale producers of major field-crop commodities, such as corn and soybeans grown in the Midwest and other low-cost production regions.

40|$|Using {{survey data}} from the community, {{producer}} marketing groups (PMGs) and farm households in Kenya, this paper investigates the potential of rural institutions (farmer organizations, their rules and enforcement mechanisms) for remedying pervasive market imperfections and facilitate access to new technology in rural areas. Qualitative and quantitative analyses show that while the functioning of markets is constrained by high transaction costs and coordination failures, PMGs present new opportunities for small producers through vertical and horizontal coordination of production and grain marketing. They pay 20 to 25 % higher prices than other buyers and facilitate the adoption of improved varieties that help increase marketable surplus. Their accumulated assets and traded volumes are influenced by participatory decision making, member contributions and initial start-up capital. While participation declines with farm size, the associated benefits depend on marketed amounts. Moreover, the time lag to payment for deliveries makes PMGs less <b>attractive</b> <b>marketing</b> channels for the poor. The success of such groups requires policy support, increased capital access, rural finance and market information.

40|$|Pay What You Want (PWYW) {{can be an}} <b>attractive</b> <b>marketing</b> {{strategy}} to price discriminate between fair-minded and selfish customers, to fully penetrate a market without giving away the product for free, and to undercut competitors that use posted prices. We report on laboratory experiments that identify causal factors determining the willingness of buyers to pay voluntarily under PWYW. Furthermore, to see how competition affects the viability of PWYW, we implement markets in which a PWYW seller competes with a traditional seller. Finally, we endogenize the market structure and let sellers choose their pricing strategy. The experimental results show that outcome-based social preferences and strategic considerations to keep the seller in the market can explain why and how much buyers pay voluntarily to a PWYW seller. We find that PWYW can be viable in isolation, but it is less successful as a competitive strategy {{because it does not}} drive traditional posted-price sellers out of the market. Instead, the existence of a posted-price competitor reduces buyers 2 ̆ 019 payments and prevents the PWYW seller from fully penetrating the market. If given the choice, the majority of sellers opt for setting a posted price rather than a PWYW pricing. We discuss the implications of these results for the use of PWYW as a marketing strategy...|$|E
40|$|In {{a related}} piece**, {{we argue that}} the savings bond program can be revitalized to help families—especially low to {{moderate}} income households—save. Savings bonds are attractive savings vehicles with widespread consumer awareness. One specific suggestion is to allow recipients of federal tax refunds to easily direct some of their refunds to the purchase of savings bonds; in effect to ask the Treasury to “just keep some of my money. ” In March and April 2006, in conjunction with H&R Block, we conducted a “dry run” {{of this type of}} refund-based savings program. First, while the results are very preliminary, untapped demand for bonds might be strong. Given that capturing 1 % of tax refunds would increase gross bond sales by over 25 %, even a small level of refunds can materially boost bond sales, and more importantly, support family savings. Second, without a change in practices of either the IRS and/or the BPD that create impediments for bond-buyers, a refund-based bond program will likely fail. However, a few changes in government practices could simplify this process considerably. While policymakers must be mindful of the costs of administering any program, a refund-based savings bond program might enjoy certain <b>attractive</b> <b>marketing</b> and administrative economies...|$|E
40|$|Trade {{credit is}} {{a major source of}} finance in value chains in {{developed}} and emerging economies. Despite its ubiquitous use, {{this is one of the}} first empirical studies that analyzes why the use of trade credit varies along the value chain. We argue that competition faced by firms at different stages in the value chain and enforcement mechanisms that stimulate repayment jointly determine the use of trade credit. We distinguish two dimensions of competition, that is, rivalry and customer bargaining power. Competition may stimulate firms to provide trade credit to keep customers from switching to other suppliers. Yet, high contract enforcement costs relative to the value of the transactions, reduce the willingness to offer trade credit. We find empirical evidence showing that competition does not (strongly) influence the use of trade credit in the retail market, whereas it does in the markets for wholesalers and millers. We interpret these results as suggestive evidence that the retail, wholesale and milling market segments differ in terms of the enforcement costs involved in the provision of trade credit. Rivalry at the retail market segment makes switching easy for customers, even in case of default. As enforcement of repayment in this market segment is difficult and costly, trade credit appears to be a risky and less <b>attractive</b> <b>marketing</b> instrument for retailers. In contrast, in the wholesale and milling market segment, trade credit is widespread as stakeholders know each other, making informal mechanisms effective in supporting the enforcement of trade credit repayment. <br/...|$|E

40|$|Background: Due to {{the rapid}} growth of social media usage, {{marketing}} has significantly moved from traditional ways towards digital marketing. In today’s society, people are exposed to an overload of information through various media channels. Due to the overexposing of marketing, traditional marketing has become less effective since the majority of the information through traditional media channels pass people by. Considering this, companies are seeking new ways to market their brand and products. A new <b>attractive</b> <b>marketing</b> tool is blogs {{and with the help of}} bloggers as influencers, companies see the potential of effectively reaching out to their desired target group.   Purpose: The purpose of the thesis is to examine how advertising of brands, products and services are presented in the blog of Michaela Forni as well as the readers’ interpretation of the sponsored content.   Method: This thesis adopted an abductive philosophy, with an interpretive, qualitative methodological approach. The main techniques include content analysis, narrative analysis and semi-structured interviews.   Conclusion: A major finding and conclusion obtained from this study is the importance of what product or service that is promoted in the sponsored blog posts. This factor plays a crucial role whether the readers are susceptible to the sponsored message or not. Thus, sponsored posts are more appreciated than native advertising and ad-banners appearing on the blog as the latter two forms feature content not written by the blogger herself. Michaela Forni is using several presentations styles of her sponsored posts which leads to a bigger interest of the readers due to the variety. One of the most significant conclusion from this study is that branded storytelling is the most effective presentational style of sponsored content. The loyal relationship between the blogger and reader results in less ad skepticism and the reader having a positive association towards the sponsored content on the blog. The authors also identified correlations between the presentation styles of the sponsored content and readers’ interpretations. ...|$|E
40|$|The primary {{aim of the}} School Fruit Scheme (SFS) is {{to produce}} {{sustained}} increases in children’s consumption of fruit and vegetables. The literature, however, shows that bringing about long-lasting improvements in children’s eating habits is not easy or straightforward. The challenge is all the greater because children are continually bombarded with very <b>attractive</b> <b>marketing</b> and ready availability of sweet, salty, and fatty foods, which compete to displace fruit and vegetables. However, as is outlined in this document, the literature also shows that there are interventions that can help children make healthy choices and greatly increase their consumption of fruit and vegetables. The recommendations for MSs that have emerged from consideration of this evidence are as follows: Based on the available scientific evidence, the Group of Experts (GREX) suggests that all measures and activities should be eligible for EU aid as accompanying measures (AMs) which are directly linked to {{the objectives of the}} SFS in increasing fruit and vegetables consumption, short and long term, and shaping healthy eating habits. The measures should be founded on evidence-based principles, such as repeated tasting, role-modelling, rewards, branding, and appearance. All measures shall be subject to evaluation for effectiveness. RECOMMENDATION 1 : Presented in isolation, printed education materials or other traditional forms of nutritional education addressed to children, are not in themselves sufficient to bring about sustained changes in children’s eating habits. These activities alone are not therefore recommended; if they are offered, it should be in combination with other evidence-based interventions RECOMMENDATION 2 : It is important to use interventions with constituent components that have sound evidence to show they bring about sustained changes in children’s consumption of fruit and vegetables. Evaluation that assesses the effectiveness of each AM is essential. RECOMMENDATION 3 : The main focus of evaluations must be firmly upon children’s eating habits and their actual consumption of fruit and vegetables (see the Grex recommendations on evaluation). ...|$|E
40|$|In an {{environment}} where many charities offer a similar cause in a similar tone and manner, children’s charities face challenges in obtaining sufficient financial support. Most of the existing literature addresses charitable giving to many different causes but does not study giving {{in the form of}} child sponsorship. Additionally, the current literature does not take gender differences into consideration, such as Chang and Lee (2011) who suggested that women and men have different perspectives and motives for charitable giving. In the field of charitable fundraising, segmentation based on motivation has proven to be effective in identifying the target market and designing successful fundraising strategies that lead to gaining financial support. This dissertation reports a qualitative research on women’s motivation for sponsoring children with World Vision. The research aims to find out what motivates women to sponsor children (objective 1) and what leads women to choose to sponsor with World Vision (objective 2). Based on these research objectives, nine semi-structured interviews with female sponsors were conducted. This study reveals several intrinsic and extrinsic sources in women’s motivation for child sponsorship. The results of this study show that intrinsic motivation is the most cited code (80 %), thus it is the key trigger evoking women’s motivation in sponsoring children. Hence women are an important market for child sponsorship because most of their motivation is derived from an intrinsic source, i. e. the desire to pursue child sponsorship for its own sake. This study suggests women’s intrinsic motivation is governed by four factors: (1) altruistic motives, (2) reciprocity motivation, (3) the need to give back to enhance personal development; and (4) as a program of child sponsorship requires an on-going monthly contribution, “feeling good” motivates and/or retains female sponsors in continuing their sponsorship, as opposed to the initial motivation. On the other hand, this research reveals that extrinsic motivation has much less influence on women’s decision to sponsor children; these motivations include (1) the affordability of spending on a meaningful cause, and (2) social affiliation. The second part of the research findings focuses on identifying factors that lead women to choose to sponsor with World Vision (research objective 2). Although female participants stated that most children’s charities are the same, they perceived World Vision is a good charity to donate to because of four factors: (1) it is a well-known, meaningful and Christian brand; (2) demonstration good organisational performance which derives from goals achievement, being long established and having celebrities’ endorsement; (3) it offers a personalised sponsorship program, which includes personal efforts and personal communication with sponsored children; (4) it has differentiated and/or <b>attractive</b> <b>marketing</b> communication, including positive appeal and demonstration of its good intention which shows integrity (i. e. helping children regardless of ethnicity and religion). This study finds these four factors motivate women to choose to sponsor with World Vision. It is also important to note that World Vision’s personalised sponsorship programme and marketing communication set World Vision apart for other charities. The results of this study lead to some suggestions for facilitating women’s motivation for funding underprivileged children. The fundamental success factors for children’s charities are to target the right people, build meaningful brands and design the causes that meet donors’ preferences...|$|E
