5000|$|Set on a {{directing}} career, {{but also}} {{fascinated with the}} world of advertising and marketing, Stahl formed an integrated communication consultancy and production company in 1980 straight out of film school where he eventually directed numerous award winning national television spots, including the first digital stereo commercial, [...] "It's a Chevy 1986" [...] (Clio Award Winner), for GM's Chevy Cavalier. When one of his company's early clients, <b>audio</b> <b>facility</b> Glen Glenn Sound, tasked a then only 23-year-old Stahl with directing and producing the world's first all digital sound film, Stahl seized the opportunity to meld his two passions (filmmaking and marketing). What followed was Digital Dream - presented in 70mm six track stereo and costing $7.5 million, the project was co-sponsored by the top industry players including Panavision, Sony and Eastman Kodak, with visual effects supervision by Academy Award winner John Dykstra.|$|E

5000|$|After vinyl {{started to}} decline, Richardson turned his passion towards Digital Audio. Inspired by his {{experience}} in cutting the master acetate discs for vinyl record manufacturing, he became interested in developing mastering for the Compact Disc. One observation he made was that many people were transferring analogue tapes raw to digital, not realising the cutting engineer in the past would have added EQ compression and even reverb to the final disc cut. He found that using his skills as a producer and recording engineer he could add the final audio touch to the digital masters. His work rapidly became a big success and SRT's <b>audio</b> <b>facility</b> grew to contain six studios. He {{was one of the}} first people in the world in the mid 1990s, to use 32-Bit Digital EQ. Richardson created the audio for a wide range of back catalogue giving older recording new success, some of which included the chart topping album One Step Beyond and the biggest selling Jazz CD of the 1990s, Jazz on a Summer's Day, making new hits of [...] "Take Five" [...] and [...] "The Girl from Ipanema". Being an engineer at the start of the digital audio revolution, his work, plus the training of many technicians, made a contribution towards establishing the present importance of audio mastering, now a standard embellishment process for most commercial audio products and in particular CD audio.|$|E

He also worked with popular Spanish artist Ana Torroja {{as well as the}} highly talented girl group [...] "Les Go" [...] from the Ivory Coast of Africa, as well as on songs for the Indo-Italian Film, 'Senso-Unico'. He has done session work with Jim Peterik from the band 'Survivor' (Eye of the Tiger) and has also {{recorded}} with Rex Rideout. Ashish has worked for Effanel Music in Manhattan, New York where he has not only did studio work with the likes of big named talent but effectively mastered the diverse music styles of such artists as Garth Brooks, Wynton Marsalis, Boz Scaggs, James Taylor, and Verve Records. He has been associated with Big-Band performances at Avery Fisher Hall and Alice Tully Hall at Lincoln Center in New York. During this time he also worked on the immensely popular TV shows MTV Unplugged & VH-1 Storytellers.

40|$|A psychophysical {{experiment}} {{was conducted to}} evaluate the interior design alternatives of a highspeed train. Preference of each design alternative was quantitatively measured by using the magnitude estimation technique. Subsequent analyses showed that (1) passenger seats {{should be able to}} be arranged in the moving direction of a train, (2) a variety of interior convenience facilities, especially, an <b>audio</b> <b>facility,</b> should be provided to enhance passenger comfort and (3) the design requirements suggested by young passengers could improve the overall preference level. In addition, guidelines for collecting, standardizing, and analyzing the data are suggested when the magnitude estimation technique is used. The use of psychophysical data is expected to be very useful when it is necessary to make engineering decisions based on quantitative preference data. close 81...|$|E

40|$|Background: Good {{communication}} around {{cancer treatment}} {{is essential in}} helping patients cope with their disease and related care, especially when this information is tailored to one’s needs. Despite its importance, communication is often complex, in particular in older patients (aged 65 years or older). In addition to the age-related deterioration in information and memory processing older patients experience, communication is also complicated by their required yet often unmet role of being an active, participatory patient. Older patients rarely express their informational needs and their contributions to consultations are often limited. Therefore, older patients with cancer {{need to be prepared}} to participate more actively in their care and treatment. Objective: The objective of this paper was to report the development of PatientVOICE, an online, preparatory tool with <b>audio</b> <b>facility</b> aimed to enhance the participation of older patients during educational nursing encounters preceding chemotherapy and to improve their information recall. Methods: PatientVOICE was developed by applying the following 6 steps of the intervention mapping framework that involved both patients and nurses: (1) needs assessment, (2) specifying determinants and change objectives, (3) reviewing and selecting theoretical methods and practical strategies, (4) developing intervention components, (5) designing adoption and implementation, and (6) making an evaluation plan. Results: A careful execution of these consecutive steps resulted in the ready-to-use preparatory website. PatientVOICE provides pre-visit information about chemotherapy (ie, medical information, side effects, and recommendations of dealing with side effects), information about the educational nursing visit preceding chemotherapy (ie, aim, structure, and recommendations for preparation), techniques to improve patients’ communication skills using a question prompt sheet (QPS) and video-modeling examples showing “best practices”, and the opportunity to upload and listen back to an audio recording of a patient’s own nursing visit. Conclusions: The development process resulted in PatientVOICE, a multi-component online intervention targeted to older patients with cancer. PatientVOICE contains information about the treatment as well as information {{about the role of the}} patient during treatment. Using different methods (QPS and <b>audio</b> <b>facility),</b> we hope to support these patients during their treatment. In the future, the utility and usability of this complex intervention will be evaluated in a group of older patients who receive or have received chemotherapy...|$|E

The input of the system will be a scene (set of objects) and output as <b>audio.</b> <b>Facility</b> of alert is provided based on potential obstacles that gives by its shape like pointed tip, sharp edge, fragile, danger symbol etc. Different techniques are use to provide detection of objects based on shapes and alert users about the severity of the objects. The features of the object are extracted, and clusters of features are formed based on shape similarity. This avoids the exhaustive searching during testing and thus gives less computation timing. Alert service is provided to the user before the actual object is detected by considering the shape of the object. In case the object does not have a likely matching shape in any of the clusters, then it will not performed the remaining several operation that required for object detection. It declared as a new object. In such way, the overburden to the system is minimized...|$|E
