5|$|A nearly {{vertical}} {{region of}} the HR diagram, known as the instability strip, is occupied by pulsating variable stars known as Cepheid variables. These stars vary in magnitude at regular intervals, giving them a pulsating appearance. The strip intersects {{the upper part of}} the main sequence in the region of class A and F stars, which are between one and two solar masses. Pulsating stars in this part of the instability strip that intersects {{the upper part of the}} main sequence are called Delta Scuti variables. Main-sequence stars in this region experience only small changes in magnitude <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>this</b> variation is difficult to detect. Other classes of unstable main-sequence stars, like Beta Cephei variables, are unrelated to this instability strip.|$|E
5|$|The theatre was {{established}} by architect and playwright John Vanbrugh, in 1705, as the Queen's Theatre. Legitimate drama unaccompanied by music was prohibited by law {{in all but the}} two London patent theatres, <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>this</b> theatre quickly became an opera house. Between 1711 and 1739, more than 25 operas by George Frideric Handel premiered here. In the early 19th century, the theatre hosted the opera company that was to move to the Theatre Royal, Covent Garden, in 1847, and presented the first London performances of Mozart's La clemenza di Tito, Così fan tutte and Don Giovanni. It also hosted the Ballet of her Majesty's Theatre in the mid-19th century, before returning to hosting the London premieres of such operas as Bizet's Carmen and Wagner's Ring Cycle.|$|E

25|$|Herbivores such as {{cows and}} sheep consume {{terrestrial}} plant matter (grass) which contains β-sitosterol {{as the principal}} sterol. β-sitosterol is the 24-ethyl derivative of cholesterol {{and can be used}} as a biomarker for terrestrial plant matter (see section). In the gut of these animals, bacteria biohydrogenate the double bond in the 5 position to create 24-ethyl coprostanol <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>this</b> compound {{can be used as a}} biomarker for faecal matter from herbivores. Typical values in different source materials can be seen in the table after Gilpin.|$|E
25|$|The WCML was not {{originally}} {{conceived as}} a single trunk route, but was a number of separate lines built by different companies between the 1830s and the 1880s. After {{the completion of the}} successful Liverpool and Manchester Railway in 1830, schemes were mooted to build more inter-city lines. The business practice of the early railway era was for companies to promote individual lines between two destinations, rather than to plan grand networks of lines, as it was easier to obtain backing from investors. <b>And</b> <b>so</b> <b>this</b> is how {{the early stages of the}} WCML evolved.|$|E
25|$|The {{earliest}} {{mention of}} Billy Beldham {{seems to be}} in a reference to two players called Beldum (sic) who represented Farnham Cricket Club in its earliest known match at Odiham on Tuesday, 13 August 1782. The source provides a scorecard. Farnham, who won, included J. Wells (probably James Wells), G. Beldum (almost certainly Beldham's elder brother George) and Beldum (no initial), who scored 1 and 16. If the latter was Billy Beldham, as is possible, he would have been 16 at the time <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>this</b> was his first known match.|$|E
