5|$|By 1910 Russian émigrés met {{regularly}} at the Anarchist Club in Jubilee Street, Stepney. Many {{of its members}} were not anarchists, and the club became <b>a</b> <b>meeting</b> <b>and</b> social venue for the Russian émigré diaspora, {{most of whom were}} Jewish. The small group of Latvians who became involved in the events at Houndsditch and Sidney Street were not all anarchists—although anarchist literature was later found among their possessions. Members of the group were probably revolutionaries who had been radicalised by their experiences in Russia. All had extreme left-wing political views and believed the expropriation of private property was a valid practice.|$|E
5|$|Although Joachim von Ribbentrop {{had been}} named Foreign Minister in February 1938, Göring {{continued}} to involve himself in foreign affairs. That July, he contacted the British government {{with the idea that}} he should make an official visit to discuss Germany's intentions for Czechoslovakia. Neville Chamberlain was in favour of <b>a</b> <b>meeting,</b> <b>and</b> there was talk of a pact being signed between Britain and Germany. In February 1938, Göring visited Warsaw to quell rumours about the upcoming invasion of Poland. He had conversations with the Hungarian government that summer as well, discussing their potential role in an invasion of Czechoslovakia. At the Nuremberg Rally that September, Göring and other speakers denounced the Czechs as an inferior race that must be conquered. Chamberlain met with Hitler in a series of meetings that led to the signing of the Munich Agreement (29 September 1938), which turned over control of the Sudetenland to Germany. In March 1939, Göring threatened Czechoslovak president Emil Hácha with the bombing of Prague. Hácha then agreed to sign a communique accepting the German occupation of the remainder of Bohemia and Moravia.|$|E

5|$|Leading up to Turning Point 2007, TNA {{officials}} {{began to}} suspect Scott Hall would not {{show up at the}} event, as the last contact with him prior to the event was earlier that morning. TNA officials soon received word from Hall that he was suffering from food poisoning and {{would not be able to}} attend. As a result of the no-show, officials approached Samoa Joe and asked him to help take blame off the company for Hall's no-show and to help promote talent in TNA by giving an announcement before introducing Eric Young as Hall's replacement. Joe's announcement went five minutes longer than originally planned, which upset several individuals in TNA. At one point during his announcement, he asked a person off-screen if they were angry and to go ahead and fire him, as he did not care; this individual was the legitimate president of TNA, Dixie Carter. After the event went off the air, a heated exchange between Kevin Nash and Joe took place backstage. The next night, TNA held <b>a</b> <b>meeting</b> <b>and</b> announced that anyone unhappy with their job could void their contract with the company. Senshi was the only one who wished to void his contract. During the meeting, Joe apologized for his actions at the event.|$|E
5|$|One day {{a man by}} {{the name}} of Victor Kennedy (Peter Kay) {{interrupts}} <b>a</b> <b>meeting</b> <b>and</b> points out that LINDA has lost focus. He reinvigorates the group's efforts to locate the Doctor by teaching them spying techniques. Elton is given the task of getting close to Rose Tyler's mother Jackie (Camille Coduri). He manages to meet Jackie at a laundrette and is invited to her apartment. She tries and fails to seduce him, but when she finds a picture of Rose in Elton's jacket she demands that he leave her alone. Meanwhile, Bridget and Bliss disappear from the group unexpectedly. Victor explains their absence by saying that they quit to move on with their lives. After a meeting Elton, Ursula and Mr Skinner stage a walkout. Victor persuades Mr Skinner to remain behind, but Elton and Ursula leave. Ursula realises she forgot her phone, and she returns with Elton only to discover that Victor is an alien, whom Elton dubs an Abzorbaloff. As Ursula and Elton see the faces of the former LINDA members on the Abzorbaloff's body, the alien reveals that he has absorbed them and wishes to also absorb the Doctor to gain his accumulated experience and knowledge. The Abzorbaloff manages to trick Ursula and absorb her as well, before pursuing Elton who attempts to escape.|$|E
5|$|Silver Reef's {{residents}} {{rebuilt the}} businesses {{that had been}} destroyed, but the town soon began to decline. In 1881, the Stormont Mining Company and the Barbee & Walker Mining Company had to decrease wages from $4 per day to $3.50 per day in all of their mines except the Savage mine (a Stormont property). In response to the decrease in wages, the Silver Reef Miners Union was formed. In February 1881, union members began talking about striking the mines, and as word of this potential strike spread, the Stormont Mining Company discharged those of its miners {{who were part of}} the Miners Union. In response, the discharged union members escorted the company's superintendent, Washington Allen, out of Silver Reef. Allen immediately went to the Second District Court in Beaver and filed a lawsuit against the union members. Before they went to court, the union members held <b>a</b> <b>meeting</b> <b>and</b> decided to shut down the Savage mine. Led by Matthew O'Loughlin, the president of the Silver Reef Miners Union, they walked through Silver Reef in rows of two, and, upon arriving at the Savage mine, O'Loughlin and nine other men went into the hoisting works and ordered the engineer on duty to shut down the pumps that kept water from the water table out of the mine. After the pumps were shut down, the group of ten went into the Savage mine and ordered everyone out.|$|E

Nate later helps Chris and Lucy see that they need to think the idea through more thoroughly, and they draw up a contract detailing how their child will be raised. When they learn that they are both carriers of spinal muscular atrophy, Chris tells Lucy that she should find another donor. But when Chris sees how down Lucy is, he changes his mind and they go ahead with the insemination. A couple of weeks later, Lucy calls Chris to tell him that she is pregnant. Chris plans to visit New York for the scan, but Nate confesses he is banned from the States for overstaying his visa there previously. Toadfish Rebecchi (Ryan Moloney) agrees to help lift the ban, but Nate misses <b>a</b> <b>meeting</b> <b>and</b> Chris accuses him of not taking it seriously. Lucy returns for a visit and Chris decides he wants to split his time between Erinsborough and New York when the baby comes, although Nate is against this idea. Nate realises that they want different things, and they break-up. Chris then decides to move to New York with Lucy and leaves after a farewell party at The Waterhole. A few months later, Amber contacts Chris and Lucy via video call after learning that they have had a daughter. Chris and Lucy introduce her to Anne, and Chris asks Amber to say hello to Nate for him.|$|E

Meanwhile, he had constructed his own fortress, Barbitsa in the mountains of Mani and from there he launched his raids on the Turks. It was widely thought that Zacharias' aim was for the Turks to meet his demands, however, in reality what he wanted was the liberation of the Peloponnese from the Turks.|$|E
