5|$|The Waleses made Sandringham House their {{preferred}} residence, with Marlborough House their London base. Biographers agree that their marriage {{was in many}} ways a happy one; however, some have asserted that Albert Edward did not give his wife as much attention as she would have liked and that they gradually became estranged, until his attack of typhoid fever (the disease which was believed to have killed his father) in late 1871 brought about a reconciliation. This is disputed by others, who point out Alexandra's frequent pregnancies throughout this period and use family letters to deny the existence of any serious rift. Nevertheless, the prince was severely criticised from many quarters of society for his apparent lack of interest in her very serious illness with rheumatic fever. Throughout their marriage Albert Edward continued to keep company with other women, including the actress Lillie Langtry; Daisy Greville, Countess of Warwick; humanitarian Agnes Keyser; and society matron Alice Keppel. Alexandra knew <b>about</b> <b>most</b> of these relationships, and later permitted Alice Keppel to visit the king as he lay dying. Alexandra herself remained faithful throughout her marriage.|$|E
5|$|Elsa, {{princess of}} Arendelle and heiress to the throne, is {{born with the}} ability to create and control ice and snow. As a child, she uses her {{abilities}} to create a winter wonderland to play in with her younger sister and best friend, Princess Anna. One night, Elsa accidentally harms Anna with her powers. The king and queen of Arendelle hurriedly take Anna to a tribe of mountain trolls to be healed. While healing Anna, the trolls inform the royals present that Elsa's abilities will grow, becoming both beautiful and very dangerous so she must learn to control them. While the trolls erase Anna's memory of the incident and of her elder sister's powers in general, Elsa is traumatized by the event. The king and queen take steps to control and hide Elsa's ice powers: the castle gates are locked, Elsa is shut away in her bedroom for most of the time, she is given gloves to help suppress her powers and is told to hold in her emotions as well. Nonetheless her powers continue to grow even stronger and so she becomes fearful of harming those she cares <b>about</b> <b>most.</b> Meanwhile, her sister Anna is less happy and confused by the loss of contact with her elder sister and tries, without success, to coax her out of her room. When the sisters grow into teenagers, the ship in which the king and queen are sailing is capsized in a storm and they drown, leaving Anna and Elsa feeling even more lonely.|$|E

25|$|Since most people, {{and most}} cultures, {{substantially}} agree <b>about</b> <b>most</b> pure ethical situations, casuistry often creates ethical arguments that can persuade {{people of different}} ethnic, religious and philosophical beliefs to treat particular cases in the same ways.

The parting of ways started in the early 1870s, and one of the issues on which they differed was women’s education.|$|E

25|$|Giddens, {{the author}} of over 34 books and 200 articles, essays and reviews, has contributed and written <b>about</b> <b>most</b> notable {{developments}} {{in the area of}} social sciences, with the exception of research design and methods. He has written commentaries on most leading schools and figures and has used most sociological paradigms in both micro and macrosociology. His writings range from abstract, metatheoretical problems to very direct and 'down-to-earth' textbooks for students. His textbook, Sociology, first published in 1988, is currently in its eighth edition. Finally, he is also known for his interdisciplinary approach: he has commented not only on the developments in sociology, but also in anthropology, archaeology, psychology, philosophy, history, linguistics, economics, social work and most recently, political science. In view of his knowledge and works, one may view much of his life's work as a form of 'grand ' of sociological theory.|$|E
25|$|Doctors and {{scientists}} {{who worked with}} Genie were uncertain <b>about</b> <b>most</b> of her life from birth to 20 months. By the age of 11 months she was falling behind in her physical development, which researchers believed was due to both malnutrition and some degree of neglect, although the few medical records from {{the first year of}} her life noted no physical or mental abnormalities. In conversations with members of the research team that studied Genie, her mother said that as a baby Genie was not very cuddly and did not babble very much. At times she claimed that at an undetermined point Genie said some unspecified individual words, but on other occasions said that Genie never produced speech of any kind, preventing linguists from making any definitive determinations. When Genie was 20 months old, after a pickup truck struck and killed her paternal grandmother, Genie's father decided to increase the family's isolation as much as possible, and because he believed Genie was severely retarded he believed she required a higher degree of isolation {{than the rest of the}} family.|$|E
25|$|Lanrezac's harsh {{criticism}} of his superiors in the Staff Corps overshadowed his impressive ability to avoid envelopment by the Germans, and he was replaced by Louis Franchet d'Espérey just before {{the opening of the}} First Battle of the Marne. Joffre later recorded that ever since the Battle of Guise, Lanrezac’s normal tendency to criticise and argue about his orders had been exacerbated by fatigue, to the detriment of Fifth Army staff’s morale. Lanrezac’s staff were bickering among themselves. As he could not be counted upon for the planned counterstroke, it was necessary to relieve him on the afternoon of 3 September. The eyewitness accounts of Lanrezac (who claimed that he protested that events had proved him right <b>about</b> <b>most</b> of the issues under dispute, but that Joffre refused to meet his gaze, so that {{it was clear that he}} had exhausted Joffre’s confidence), Joffre (who claimed that Lanrezac immediately agreed and cheered up when relieved of command, in his own office) and Spears (who recalled seeing them having a lengthy and strained conversation in the playground of the school where Fifth Army HQ was currently based) differ somewhat.|$|E

In addition, the Smoking Man's allegiances are in that he must decide whether or not to heal himself of cancer using the power of Jeremiah Smith. Ultimately, Mulder's loyalties prove altruistic, whereas the Smoking Man chooses self-interest over The Syndicate's cause.|$|E

[...] Spacey has also been evasive about his character's true identity. In {{an interview}} with Total Film, he said, [...] "That's for the audience to decide.

500|$|Steinbock's {{relevance}} also lies in {{his background}} and profession, illustrating Balzac's {{conception of the}} Polish people, as well as himself. Having {{spent more than a}} decade befriending Mme. Hanska and visiting her family in Poland, Balzac believed he had insight into the national character (as he felt <b>about</b> <b>most</b> groups he observed). Thus, descriptions of Steinbock are often laced with commentary about the Polish people: [...] "Soyez mon amie, dit-il avec une de ces démonstrations caressantes si familières aux Polonais, et qui les font accuser assez injustement de servilité." [...] ("'Be my sweetheart,' he added, with one of the caressing gestures familiar to the Poles, for which they are unjustly accused of servility.") ...|$|E
500|$|GamePro {{noted that}} the game was enjoyable despite it {{appearing}} [...] "convoluted at first, even for RPG [...] ". Kasavin appreciated the lack of random encounters and enjoyed the strategic flow of battle, while Nutt appreciated both the game's challenge and its deep mechanics. Dunham praised both the ease of gameplay following its introductory stages and the customization options available. He was less positive <b>about</b> <b>most</b> of the mini-games available. Fahay felt that the game had [...] "excellent" [...] gameplay, and like Sasavin praised the removal of random encounters. The A.G.W.S. mechs were seen by several reviewers as a lackluster addition to the gameplay. The mechanic used to enable the player to revisit dungeons was also frequently seen as contrived.|$|E

500|$|The affinities of the Mascarene parrot are unclear, and two {{hypotheses}} have competed {{since the}} mid-19th century. Some authors grouped {{it with the}} Coracopsinae (of African origin) due to its dark plumage, and others with the Psittaculinae parrots (of Asian origin) based on the large red beak, a feature which is diagnostic for that group. Its plumage pattern was mostly atypical for a psittaculine, though other members have black facial patterns. Although little is known <b>about</b> <b>most</b> extinct parrot species of the Mascarenes, subfossil remains show that they shared common features, such as enlarged heads and jaws, reduced [...] bones, and robust leg bones. Hume supported their common origin in the radiation of the Psittaculini tribe based on morphological features {{and the fact that}} Psittacula parrots have managed to colonise many isolated islands in the Indian Ocean.|$|E
500|$|Interviewed at {{the time}} of the album's release, Nicky Wire said that the track [...] "Ifwhiteamericatoldthetruthforonedayit'sworldwouldfallapart" [...] was [...] "not a {{completely}} anti-American song", but instead was about [...] "how the most empty culture in the world can dominate in such a total sense". [...] "Of Walking Abortion" [...] is about right-wing totalitarianism, of which Wire commented: [...] "there's a worm in human nature that makes us want to be dominated". [...] "Archives of Pain", dealing with the glorification of serial killers and seemingly advocating capital punishment, he said [...] "was the song that me and Richey worried <b>about</b> <b>most</b> [...] the song isn't a right wing statement, it's just against this fascination with people who kill". Later in 1994, Bradfield described the song as [...] "one of the most important things we've done" [...] but said it was also [...] "very right-wing" [...] and [...] "miscalculated".|$|E
500|$|Famitsu {{called the}} {{original}} version's gameplay a [...] "stressless experience", praising the game's size and saying the action-oriented battle system made it [...] "a very different Final Fantasy". Dengeki PlayStation similarly praised {{its size and}} the tense combat, though the review found aspects of the navigation less appealing. Hindman was generally positive <b>about</b> <b>most</b> aspects of gameplay and the high replay value, but found faults with the scripted opening of the overworld and the real-time strategy segments. Van Duine said the gameplay encouraged immersion and was harsh on novices; she praised several aspects of gameplay, but described the leveling system as [...] "tricky". The multiplayer functions were universally praised in Japan. Opinions were divided on the original camera, with Famitsu praising its movement, while Van Duine and Dengeki PlayStation found issues with it getting stuck in the environment or impeding visibility. The character AI also received criticism for being unresponsive or wayward.|$|E
