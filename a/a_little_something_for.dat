She played Irene Adler, an {{antagonist}} and love interest of Downey's title character Sherlock Holmes, and welcomed {{the opportunity to play}} a character who is [...] "her own boss and a real free spirit". Todd McCarthy of Variety felt her character was [...] "not very well integrated into the rest of the story, a shortcoming the normally resourceful McAdams is unable to do much about". A. O. Scott of The New York Times stated, [...] "Ms.McAdams is a perfectly charming actress and performs gamely as the third wheel of this action-bromance tricycle. But Irene feels in this movie more like a somewhat cynical commercial contrivance. She offers <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>something</b> <b>for</b> the ladies and also something for the lads, who, much as they may dig fights and explosions and guns and chases, also like girls." [...] The film was a major commercial success, earning over $524 million at the worldwide box office.|$|E

[...] Josh Love of The Village Voice thought [...] "preternatural wisdom and inclusiveness" [...] shined through the lyrics and theme of [...] "You Belong with Me"; Love also mentioned {{that it was one}} of Fearless [...] "great songs". The same magazine later ranked the song at number 10 on its annual Pazz & Jop critics' poll. Leah Greenblatt of Entertainment Weekly said Swift's vocals fit the song's melody and instrumentation, which, according to her, is [...] "slick" [...] and [...] "radio-friendly". Rob Sheffield of Blender magazine recommended for readers to download [...] "You Belong with Me", and Jeniffer Webb, also from About.com, predicted that the song would reach different age groups.

500|$|The WiiWare {{version has}} {{received}} mostly positive reviews, {{with the central}} criticism being the 1200 Wii Point price tag (US$12, £10), after years of free play. Jeremy Parish of 1UP.com commended the graphical update, which [...] "sacrifices none of [...] classic-influenced charm". He also remarked that the Classic Controller and Wii Remote are superior to the keyboard input of the PC original. On the issue of price, he explained that [...] "the prospect of Amaya finally earning <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>something</b> <b>for</b> the hard work he invested in this masterpiece strikes me as satisfyingly poetic" [...] and [...] "absolutely worth your money". John Teti of Eurogamer had similar sentiments, but also noted the technical issues with the remixed music, recommending the original soundtrack. Edge compared the remake to , satisfying both modern tastes with its graphical overhaul and old school fans with the option to switch to the original graphics. Daemon Hatfield of IGN felt that Cave Story [...] "belongs on a Nintendo system" [...] and noted gameplay similarities to Blaster Master, in which damage reduces the power of weapons as well. Cave Story was nominated for Game of the Year at the 2010 Nintendo Power Awards, as well as WiiWare Game of the Year.|$|E

As {{mentioned}} are songs {{in all areas of}} the spectrum here - the more mellow “Turn It On,” the hook driven “Ghost,” and the most flamboyant pop song with “Weekend.” Even the three part vocal melody on “Punchline” is something I haven’t really heard before. The album feels similar to My Blood Is Full of Airplane but also throws some unexpected segments - the guitar part near the end of “Talking In Your Sleep” - that break from the norm. The experimentation does have some missteps, but there’s still <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>something</b> here <b>for</b> everyone - fans of The Cinema’s previous record, Lydia’s Devil, synth-heavy music, and pop music." ...|$|R

500|$|Come What(ever) May was {{met with}} {{generally}} positive critical reviews. Several reviewers noted how it helped to further establish Stone Sour. Chad Bower of About.com stated that the band had [...] "progressed a lot since their debut", noting that the album was [...] "very diverse and [...] the band to show many different sides of their musical personality". Megan Frye of Allmusic opened her review of the album by distinguishing what sets Stone Sour apart musically, writing [...] " [...] ability to create smooth, radio-friendly alternative metal songs while simultaneously not boring {{the people who have}} heard way too much from post-grunge groups." [...] On a similar note, Michael Melchor of 411mania said, [...] "The band is much better at the craft of songwriting than many of their peers." [...] In contrast, reviewer William Fry of IGN criticized the album, writing, [...] "Stone Sour doesn't do anything inspired, original, or fresh here," [...] even calling the album [...] "completely misdirected, and stonewalled". A particular point of interest for reviewers was how Come What(ever) May is more melodic than the band's previous album Stone Sour. Melchor of 411mania said the album is [...] "much more liberal with the balladry and acoustic sounds than its predecessor"; of the track [...] "Sillyworld" [...] he said, [...] "It sounds like what Nickelback could be if Chad Kroeger could write a good melody." [...] In his review, Chad Bower labeled Come What(ever) May as a [...] "very melodic and accessible album" [...] writing that [...] "it has <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>something</b> <b>for</b> everyone".

Although there may be women who read books like the Ice and Fire series, Bellafante said to never have [...] "met a single woman who has stood up in indignation at her book club and refused to read the latest from Lorrie Moore unless everyone agreed to The Hobbit first". The article received so many responses that the New York Times had to close down the comments section.|$|E
2500|$|Gameplay was {{compared}} by several critics to , while the weapon system was likened to Vagrant Story. GameSpot's Shane Satterfield and IGN's David Zdyrko both felt the Georama mode borrowed elements from ActRaiser. GameSpot, IGN and Game Informers Andrew Reiner all praised {{the game for}} blending different types of gameplay together successfully. Satterfield argued [...] "no game has blended all these compelling and unrelated ideas together into one highly addictive and surprisingly cohesive experience until now." [...] Zdyrko called the game [...] "a highly-enjoyable and insanely addictive role-playing experience that wouldn't {{have been able to}} stand alone with just its story, just its battle system, or any single one of its gameplay elements. The game works because each element aids in the enjoyment of the other parts." [...] Reiner wrote [...] "The overall design may not be the best, yet you'll be completely engrossed with Dark Clouds play. Completists [...] will want to obtain every item and weapon. Action fans will drool over the combat. Sim junkies will admire the town building. A rarity for RPGs, Dark Cloud truly does have <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>something</b> <b>for</b> everyone." ...|$|E

Others were inspired by movies or from a friend of mine that may have told me their story. People can listen to it and pick out certain songs that mean something to them - women especially. It's about women's empowerment and overcoming certain things. It's fun too though. It's got <b>a</b> <b>little</b> bit of <b>something</b> <b>for</b> everybody".|$|R

5000|$|When Telltale Games {{acquired}} {{the right to}} make video games based on The Walking Dead comics, they signed a contract for a [...] "multi-year, multi-platform, multi-title" [...] license. This license went into effect after the success of the first season of The Walking Dead, when Telltale commissioned a second series of games based on the franchise. The first season was considered highly successful, helping to revitalize the adventure game genre which had been in decline since the mid-1990s, with Telltale being {{recognized as one of the}} top development studios in 2012. During an interview on IGN's Up at Noon, writer Gary Whitta teased more The Walking Dead from Telltale sooner than later. [...] "You won't have to wait for season two to play more Walking Dead", he claimed. [...] "I can tell you what you already know, which is season two is coming. There's not much to say because it really is very early... it's a way off", said Whitta. [...] "But, knowing that it's a way off, and knowing that people are hungry for more Walking Dead there may very well be more Walking Dead from Telltale before season two. We may have <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>something</b> extra <b>for</b> you between season one and two". Whitta continued to tease that something is in the works right now [...] "that will make the wait for season two slightly less agonizing". This was revealed at the 2013 Electronic Entertainment Expo in June 2013 to be an additional episode called The Walking Dead: 400 Days that is available as downloadable content for the first season. It introduces five new characters that journalists expect to carry into Season Two. 400 Days will use data about the player's decisions in season one, and decisions made in 400 Days will carry into Season Two.|$|R

At the very moment when Joel and the miller were lounging about a Dutch inn, some fifteen or twenty miles above Schenectady, in waiting for the travellers to descend the valley of the Mohawk, Robert Willoughby and his guide were actually crossing the Hudson, in momentary security at least. After remaining at his post until satisfied his intended prey had escaped him, Joel, with his friend, returned to the settlement. Still, the opportunity had been improved, to make himself better acquainted with the real state of the country; to open communications with certain patriots of a moral calibre about equal to his own, but of greater influence; to throw out divers injurious hints, and secret insinuations concerning the captain; and to speculate on the propriety of leaving so important a person to work his will, at a time so critical.

The drama premiered with a solid 1.1 million viewers and managed to maintain its audience share {{over the course of}} its four night run. Tom Sutcliffe, writing in The Independent, said: [...] "The drama involved virtually no preaching at all, but a sense of morality was everywhere, as bad conscience flickered {{in the face of the}} toughest characters and grief hit the culpable and the blameless alike. Best of all, it always found <b>a</b> <b>little</b> time <b>for</b> <b>something</b> other than plot, whether it was banter on stairwells or the melancholy beauty of the city at night. Seriously good television." [...] Ed Cumming of The Daily Telegraph wrote of [...] "minor quibbles", before adding that [...] "on the whole this was a well-made, convincing drama, with an excellent ensemble cast. Ashley Walters, once of rap group So Solid Crew and with real-life arrests for firearms crimes, knows the world he is portraying. The two boys, Ra'Nell and Gem, did a good job of balancing adolescent aggression with naïve vulnerability. When Ra'Nell left a message on his mentally ill mother's phone, you knew it was half from a sense of responsibility towards her and half because he just wanted his mum. I wonder if he’ll still need her by the end of Thursday night." [...] He also noted similarities between Top Boy and the American television drama series The Wire.In January 2014, Audience Network began broadcasting the first season on DirecTV in the United States.|$|R
