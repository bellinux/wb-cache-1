40|$|Cooperative {{learning}} is a modern teaching strategy in which team work and cooperation {{become the most important}} activities of the entire teaching process. The quality of interaction between students and teacher, as main participants in teaching process, is important for successful application of cooperative learning. Beside faster and longer lasting knowledge <b>acquiring,</b> <b>cooperative</b> learning develops critical and creative thinking, communication and social skills and it strengthens self-confidence. Modern methods of teaching mathematics focus on didactical principle of conscious activity above other principles. This means students are major, active factors of mathematics teaching, and not only they participate in the process of teaching, but they also participate in the selection of methods of teaching. This enhances their motivation for work during classes. This means, what is learned through cooperative {{learning is}} better used in new situations, knowledge transfer is greater and new knowledge is acquired easier and lasts longer. Specific and abstract contents of mathematics lead to different ways of applying cooperative learning in this subject. That is why we chose this subject, i. e. to explore and point out the possibilities and ways of applying cooperative learning in mathematics...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 1971 A {{major problem}} confronting farmer cooperatives merging {{for the first}} time is the lack of {{valuable}} experience that a prior merger would have provided. This lack of experience results in a decision making environment of imperfect knowledge, both of the necessary postmerger activities to be performed and the timing of their performance. Thus, it was {{the purpose of this study}} to provide inexperienced cooperatives with a guide for scheduling uncertain postmerger decisions and activities. Such a guide will enable more rational postmerger decision making and more effective reorganization of merging businesses. The additional information was provided primarily from the historical records of an actual dairy cooperative case merger to which a technique known as PERT (Program Evaluation and Review Technique) was applied to develop a prescriptive model of the postmerger activities and their scheduling for possible use in similar subsequent mergers. The major benefits from using a case study approach was pedagogical in the hope that the results would be more readily adopted in practical use than if a purely theoretical design were used. Furthermore, the results of the study are based on the supposition that the synergistic benefits are greatest when the length of the postmerger decision period is minimized. Uncertainty is alleviated through planning and PERT is a planning tool that can be used to minimize project completion time. However, by applying PERT to historical data much can be learned from the experience of a previous merger. The results of applying PERT to a posteriori case study data provided a prescriptive guide for scheduling postmerger decisions and activities. More specifically, PERT determined the key performance areas of marketing and personnel to be of critical significance following the decision to merge. These areas were determined to be critical with respect to their constituent activity completion times; that is, the sequential activity path determined to be the longest occurred within the marketing and personnel areas. Thus, the expected completion times of the activities within these areas must not be prolonged in order that the merger may be completed on schedule. As determined by PERT, all other key performance areas in the case merger were not likely to become bottleneck areas during the postmerger decision period; basically their integration responsibility was one of converting the premerger procedures of the "acquired" cooperatives to that of the <b>acquiring</b> <b>cooperative.</b> Merging cooperatives can realize substantial savings from adapting the methods and findings of this study to their particular situation. Such a course of action will enable a more rapid completion of the postmerger decisions and activities and hasten the realization of the potential synergistic benefits...|$|E

40|$|Other-regarding {{preferences}} {{are important for}} establishing and maintaining cooperative outcomes. In this paper, we study how formation of other-regarding preferences during childhood is affected by parental background. Our subjects, aged 4 - 12 years, are classified into other-regarding types based on simple binary choice dictator games. The main finding is that children of parents with low education are more spiteful, more selfish and less altruistic. This link is robust to controlling for a rich set of child characteristics and class fixed effects. The parental effects stand out against the overall development of preferences, as we find children to become less spiteful and more altruistic with increasing age. Our findings, complemented by {{an analysis of the}} World Values Survey data, suggest that low socio-economic status affects parental effort invested in instilling other-regarding preferences into children, making them less likely to <b>acquire</b> <b>cooperative</b> types of preferences...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The {{existing}} {{reinforcement learning}} approaches have {{been suffering from}} the curse of dimension problem when they are applied to multiagent dynamic environments. One of the typical examples {{is a case of}} RoboCup competitions since other agents and their behaviors easily cause state and action space explosion. This paper presents a method of modular learning in a multiagent environment by which the learning agent can <b>acquire</b> <b>cooperative</b> behaviors with its team mates and com-petitive ones against its opponents. The key ideas to resolve the issue are as follows. First, a two-layer hierarchical system with multi learning modules is adopted {{to reduce the size of}} the sensor and action spaces. The state space of the top layer consists of the state values from the lower level, and the macro actions are used to reduce the size of the physical action space. Second, the state of the other to what extent it is close to its own goal is estimated by observation and used as a state value in the top layer state space to realize the cooperative/competitive behaviors. The method is applied to 4 (defence team) on 5 (offence team) game task, and the learning agent successfully acquired the teamwork plays (pass and shoot) within much shorter learning time (30 times quicker than the earlier work). ...|$|R

The characteristics of contemporary societies have led to a change in the role of teachers and students, being the former the guides on the side and the latter the ones who have the lead. The teacher is not the only source of knowledge. This Final Master Project, framed within the Educational Innovation modality, contemplates the introduction of the flipped classroom and cooperative learning for learning English as a Foreign Language in a post-compulsory secondary level. Its goals are to discover whether this new approach to learning leads to meaningful learning and to find out whether students acquire values and attitudes related to cooperation such as solidarity, responsibility and helping other people. In the analysis, it can be observed that the flipped classroom leads to meaningful learning, higher in comparison to traditional methodologies, which opens the door for its frequent use in our educational system. On the other hand, a high number of students <b>acquire</b> <b>cooperative</b> values and abilities, although some students do not, as they are used to working in an individual way. In this way, it can be concluded that, by following the flipped classroom and working in a cooperative way, students learn not only contents, but also values which facilitate their personal and social growth...|$|R
