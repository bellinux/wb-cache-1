5|$|Although the {{majority}} of his works were in Polish, he tried his hand at several works in French language (Le roi de Landawa, Beatrice Cenci). Many of his works were published only posthumously, often under arbitrary titles, as Słowacki never named them himself. He <b>also</b> <b>left</b> notes on works that he never began or never completed. Słowacki is also considered the father of modern Polish drama.|$|E

A number of other editors <b>also</b> <b>left</b> to assume the top jobs at other publications. While some of their replacements didn't last, a new group of core editors formed.|$|E

After his brother's death, his estate was to pass to St John's College to assist undergraduates and to support the work of the choir.|$|E
5|$|John von Neumann's work on {{functional}} analysis and topology in broke new ground {{in mathematics and}} economic theory. It <b>also</b> <b>left</b> advanced mathematical economics with fewer applications of differential calculus. In particular, general equilibrium theorists used general topology, convex geometry, and optimization theory more than differential calculus, because the approach of differential calculus had failed to establish {{the existence of an}} equilibrium.|$|E

5|$|Significantly, {{the treaty}} {{did not mention}} or {{institute}} any social reforms that Madero had vaguely promised on previous occasions. It <b>also</b> <b>left</b> the Porfirian state essentially intact. Additionally, Madero supported the unpopular idea that all land disputes were to be settled through the courts, staffed by the old judges, a decision that led to outbreaks of sporadic violence, particularly in rural areas.|$|E

Soon afterwards he traveled to France, then at war with Germany.|$|E
5|$|A WoodSearch Films short-subject {{documentary}} entitled How {{does it feel}} to work on One World Trade Center? was uploaded to YouTube on August 31, 2010. It depicted {{construction workers}} who were satisfied with the working conditions at the construction site. However, further analysis of the work site showed that dozens of construction-related injuries had occurred at the site during the construction of One World Trade Center, including 34 not reported to the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration. Workers <b>also</b> <b>left</b> post-9/11-related graffiti at the site, which are supposed to symbolize rebirth and resilience.|$|E

He then broke down after five overs in the second innings. Davidson <b>also</b> <b>left</b> the field with injury and the tourists took advantage; they attacked the remaining bowlers, levelling the series 1–1.

5|$|Although the willie wagtail is an {{aggressive}} defender of its nest, predators do account for many eggs and young. About {{two thirds of}} eggs hatch successfully, and a third leave the nest as fledglings. Nestlings may be preyed upon by both pied butcherbirds, (Cracticus nigrogularis) black butcherbirds (C. quoyi), the spangled drongo (Dicrurus bracteatus), and the pied currawong (Strepera graculina), {{as well as the}} feral cat (Felis catus), and rat species. The proximity of nesting to human habitation has <b>also</b> <b>left</b> nests open to destruction by children.|$|E
5|$|Andrea Bowen, {{who starred}} as Susan's daughter, Julie, {{departed}} from the cast, as her character left for college {{at the end of}} the fourth season. Teri Hatcher expressed disappointment in the producers' decision, but Cherry stated that Bowen would return in the future. Joy Lauren, who portrayed Bree's daughter, Danielle, and Lyndsy Fonseca, who played Katherine's daughter, Dylan, <b>also</b> <b>left</b> the main cast, although the former appeared in the season premiere as a guest star. Because the fourth season ended leaving Mike's whereabouts unknown, James Denton's return to the series was questioned during hiatus. Denton stated in May2008 that producers would not make a decision on his character until mid-June and that he was preparing to find work in case his contract was terminated. It was later confirmed that he would return to the series.|$|E
