5|$|After he graduated, Motley {{enrolled}} in 1939 at South Carolina State College, <b>a</b> <b>historically</b> black school in Orangeburg, South Carolina.

As a punishing fullback for the Wolf Pack, Motley played against powerful West Coast teams including USF, Santa Clara, and St. Mary's. He suffered a knee injury in 1943 and returned to Canton to work after dropping out of school.|$|E
5|$|Ditton is {{situated}} between the Lower Weald and the Chalk (North) Downs. The parish encompasses the Lower Greensand strata, where a formation of hard sandy limestone {{known as the}} Hythe Beds is abundant. From this formation ragstone is obtained. Kentish ragstone was <b>a</b> <b>historically</b> important building material in south east England. The Romans used ragstone {{in the construction of}} London and villas in the south-east. Medieval builders used ragstone to build churches, civic buildings, houses and bridges over local rivers. The predominance of ragstone beds in the locality gave Ditton a legacy of quarrying which continues today.|$|E
5|$|In March 1994, the {{manufacturing}} buildings were damaged by arson and were subsequently demolished. The site became a town {{park and the}} bridge was anticipated to be rehabilitated {{and serve as a}} pedestrian bridge in the park. The bridge was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in April 1999 for being <b>a</b> <b>historically</b> significant example of late 19th-century bridge fabrication and as a surviving example of a bridge built by the Berlin Iron Bridge Company without significant modification or deterioration. It was also locally significant as a remaining artefact of the Ashland Cotton Company, formerly a major employer in the city.|$|E

Pattie Shepard was also involved in charitable work and served {{as the head of}} the Women's Baptist Home Convention of North Carolina. Marshall Shepard followed his parents in joining the First Baptist Church of Oxford. He attended Slater State Normal School in Winston-Salem, North Carolina, then received his Doctor of Divinity in 1921 from Virginia Union University, <b>a</b> <b>historically</b> black university in Richmond, Virginia.|$|E

5|$|The Wellington bypass was {{constructed}} by contractor M. J. Gleeson Ltd, from 1973 to 1975. Many problems {{followed in the}} two years after completion; the rigid concrete carriageway broke up, due to the road being built on a poor subbase with rigid concrete along <b>a</b> <b>historically</b> heavily mined route. The aesthetic and constructional design of the bridges was also heavily criticised. Over the next 15 years, almost all of the original carriageway had to be replaced with asphalt.|$|E

The northern end of the bridge covers part of the Jean Baptiste Point Du Sable Homesite, which is commemorated by a National Historic plaque in Pioneer Court. The southern half of the bridge passes over the site of Fort Dearborn, which was constructed in 1803. The Fort is commemorated by a large relief above {{the entrance of the}} London Guarantee Building, and brass markers positioned in the sidewalks {{on the south side of}} the bridge delineate the posited outline of the original blockhouse.|$|E
5|$|Construction of I-496 {{started in}} 1963, and the freeway opened on December 18, 1970. Segments of the freeway south of {{downtown}} Lansing {{were built in}} the location of <b>a</b> <b>historically</b> black neighborhood. This neighborhood was formed based on the segregationist practices of the early 20th century. Community leaders worked for different housing opportunities for the black residents displaced by I-496 rather than fight the freeway. As the trunkline neared completion, competing proposals to name it resulted in two similar, but separate designations applied to I-496. The city originally approved one name in honor of a former mayor. The local historical society proposed that the state name it as a memorial to Olds after the demolition of the Olds Mansion. The city renamed it the Oldsmobile Expressway, the name under which it opened in December 1970. Two years later, the Michigan Legislature restored its preferred name and it has been the Olds Freeway since.|$|E
5|$|Nucleosidic solid supports. In <b>a</b> <b>historically</b> {{first and}} still popular approach, the 3'-hydroxy {{group of the}} 3'-terminal {{nucleoside}} residue {{is attached to the}} solid support via, most often, 3’-O-succinyl arm as in compound 3. The oligonucleotide chain assembly starts with the coupling of a phosphoramidite building block respective to the nucleotide residue second from the 3’-terminus. The 3’-terminal hydroxy group in oligonucleotides synthesized on nucleosidic solid supports is deprotected under the conditions somewhat milder than those applicable for universal solid supports. However, the fact that a nucleosidic solid support has to be selected in a sequence-specific manner reduces the throughput of the entire synthetic process and increases the likelihood of human error.|$|E

5|$|Relying {{on money}} donated by neighbors, Du Bois {{attended}} Fisk University, <b>a</b> <b>historically</b> black college in Nashville, Tennessee, from 1885 to 1888. His travel to and residency in the South was Du Bois's {{first experience with}} Southern racism, {{which at the time}} encompassed Jim Crow laws, bigotry, suppression of black voting, and lynchings; the lattermost reached a peak in the next decade. After receiving a bachelor's degree from Fisk, he attended Harvard College (which did not accept course credits from Fisk) from 1888 to 1890, where he was strongly influenced by his professor William James, prominent in American philosophy. Du Bois paid his way through three years at Harvard with money from summer jobs, an inheritance, scholarships, and loans from friends. In 1890, Harvard awarded Du Bois his second bachelor's degree, cum laude, in history. In 1891, Du Bois received a scholarship to attend the sociology graduate school at Harvard.|$|E
5|$|Silver {{is usually}} {{found in nature}} {{combined}} with other metals, or in minerals that contain silver compounds, generally {{in the form of}} sulfides such as galena (lead sulfide) or cerussite (lead carbonate). So the primary production of silver requires the smelting and then cupellation of argentiferous lead ores, <b>a</b> <b>historically</b> important process. Lead melts at 327°C, lead oxide at 888°C and silver melts at 960°C. To separate the silver, the alloy is melted again at the high temperature of 960°C to 1000°C in an oxidizing environment. The lead oxidises to lead monoxide, then known as litharge, which captures the oxygen from the other metals present. The liquid lead oxide is removed or absorbed by capillary action into the hearth linings.|$|E
