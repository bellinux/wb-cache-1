In 1977, Borsuk-Białynicka cited several {{skeletal}} features that might have been related to rearing, including the opisthocoelous vertebrae of the anterior part of the tail, which, according to this <b>author,</b> <b>would</b> have made the tail more flexible than in other sauropods. Features of the pelvis, such as the thickened shelf of the acetabulum, the flaring ilia, and the fused pubic symphysis, may have allowed the pelvis to withstand the stress of rearing.|$|E

25|$|This is a {{book that}} clatters around in a dark closet of irrelevancies for 450 pages before it bumps accidentally into its index and stops; {{but that is not}} a criticism, either, because its author finds it gratifying and {{refreshing}} to bang unrelated facts together as a rebuke to stuffy minds. This book infuriated me; but that is not a defect in it, because it is supposed to infuriate people like me, and the <b>author</b> <b>would</b> have been happier still if I had blown out an artery. In short, this book is flawless, because all its deficiencies are deliberate products of art. Given its assumptions, there is nothing here to criticize. The only course open to a reviewer who dislikes this book as much as I do is to question its author’s fundamental assumptions—which are big-ticket items involving the nature and relationships of language, knowledge, and science.|$|E

Further, not only does the author copy from Herodian without citation (either direct lifts, abbreviations or supplementations), he often distorts Herodian, to suit his literary objective.|$|E
500|$|Dr. No {{is set in}} London, England, Kingston, Jamaica and Crab Key, {{a fictional}} island off Jamaica. Filming began on {{location}} in Jamaica on 16 January 1962. The primary scenes there were the exterior shots of Crab Key and Kingston, where an uncredited Syd Cain acted as art director and also designed the Dragon Tank. They shot {{a few yards from}} Fleming's Goldeneye estate, and the <b>author</b> <b>would</b> regularly visit the filming with friends. Location filming was largely in Oracabessa, with additional scenes on the Palisadoes strip and Port Royal in St Andrew. On 21 February, production left Jamaica with footage still unfilmed due to a change of weather. Five days later, filming began at Pinewood Studios, Buckinghamshire, England with sets designed by Ken Adam, which included Dr. No's base, the ventilation duct and the interior of the British Secret Service headquarters. The studio would later be used on the majority of later Bond films. Adam's initial budget for the entire film was just £14,500 (£ in [...] ), but the producers were convinced to give him an extra £6,000 out of their own finances. After 58 days of filming, principal photography completed on 30 March 1962.|$|E

500|$|Vandersteen was now at {{the height}} of his {{productivity}} as a solo artist. Apart from his work for De Standaard and Het Nieuwsblad, he contributed to Ons Volk and Ons Volkske, he made a special Suske en Wiske story for het Parochieblad (a weekly Christian newspaper), and he started to contribute to Kuifje journal (Tintin magazine) that published Hergé. The magazine was very popular in Wallonia, but struggled in Flanders, where The Adventures of Tintin was not yet as well known. A popular Flemish <b>author</b> <b>would</b> give the sales a boost, while it could mean the breakthrough on the French language market for Vandersteen. However, Hergé, as editor-in-chief, set a very high quality standard for his magazine, and Vandersteen had to improve and stylize his drawings, and had to remove the more Flemish, popular aspects of his comics. Vandersteen obliged, and the stories of Suske en Wiske he created for Kuifje are now considered the best of his career, with the first one, Het Spaanse Spook (The Spanish Ghost), which started on 16 September 1948, as his masterpiece. It was because of his work for Kuifje that Hergé nicknamed Vandersteen [...] "The Brueghel of the Comic Strip".|$|E

2500|$|A {{collection}} of various criticisms {{can be found}} in the book Hundert Autoren gegen Einstein (A Hundred Authors Against Einstein), published in 1931. It contains very short texts from 28 authors, and excerpts from the publications of another 19 authors. The rest consists of a list that also includes people who only for some time were opposed to relativity. Besides philosophic objections (mostly based on Kantianism), also some alleged elementary failures of the theory were included; however, as some commented, those failures were due to the authors' misunderstanding of relativity. For example, Hans Reichenbach described the book as an [...] "accumulation of naive errors", and as [...] "unintentionally funny". Albert von Brunn interpreted the book as a backward step to the 16th and 17th century, and Einstein said, in response to the book, that if he were wrong, then one <b>author</b> <b>would</b> have been enough.|$|E
2500|$|The {{writing of}} the Gospel has been dated to c. 90-100. John the Apostle, if the {{principal}} <b>author,</b> <b>would</b> have been in his 70s or 80s which was higher than normal but not uncommon. On the other hand, if the apostle had actually lived to such an age, it would explain the tradition reported in John 21, that many believed that Jesus had said the apostle would not die (which {{may have led to}} the legend of Prester John). A date later than the early 2nd century is excluded because P52, our earliest manuscript evidence of the Gospel, dates from before the middle of the 2nd century. Even in the early church there was a doubt over its authenticity, and both Marcion (heretical founder of Marcionism) and Celsus (a pagan critical of Christianity in general) heavily criticized it as a clear forgery. The debate focused around not only its differences from the other Gospels, but also its teaching about the Paraclete, which was important in the early [...] "charismatic" [...] movement known as Montanism.|$|E
2500|$|In 1926, {{while still}} in Charleston, Edson {{published}} his autobiography.

The book was published as The Great American Ass by Anonymous, {{with the idea that}} curiosity about the identity of the <b>author</b> <b>would</b> stimulate sales. In a 1928 letter to Robert Marks, a Charleston friend, Edson vented his frustration at how the book had been handled. [...] "It needs revision damn badly. For instance, Sam Ornitz edited the opening paragraph to say that “Wilber, Nebraska, is not to be found on any map, it is exotically discovered for you in the works of Willa Cather…” The facts are, Wilber is the county seat of Saline County, and I was actually born there, and Willa Cather actually lived there at the same time. Sam supposed, of course, that I was just romancing. And without investigating, he announced there was no such town as Wilber, Saline County, Nebraska. All the critics knew better...therefore they concluded I was a liar in denying the existence of the town, a fool in not knowing the town existed, and finally, a coward in writing anonymously—all of which was not my fault at all." ...|$|E

2500|$|The period {{leading up}} to the premiere was not without problems. As had {{happened}} before, once word got out of a new Sardou play, another <b>author</b> <b>would</b> accuse him of plagiarism. In the 1882 caricature of Sardou (left), one of the signs on the wall states, [...] ("Ideas of others") and another, [...] ("Author's rights"). This time Ernest Daudet (a brother of Alphonse Daudet) made the accusation, claiming that four years earlier, he and Gilbert-Augustin Thierry had written a play, Saint Aubin, which takes place in Paris on the day after the Battle of Marengo (roughly the same time-setting as La Tosca) and whose heroine (like Tosca) is a celebrated opera singer. He also claimed that he had read the play to Sarah Bernhardt and Félix Duquesnel, the director of the Théâtre de la Porte Saint-Martin. Nevertheless, he said he would [...] "graciously permit" [...] Sardou's play to go ahead, and had brought up the issue solely to avoid being accused of plagiarism should Saint-Auban ever be produced. Sardou, in turn, issued a robust denial in the French papers. As the play neared its premiere, Bernhardt discovered to her fury that Sardou had sold the rights for the first American production of the play to the actress Fanny Davenport and threatened to walk out. Bernhardt was eventually pacified and rehearsals continued.|$|E
2500|$|Finally, authors {{with strong}} {{political}} or philosophical points to make {{would no longer}} turn to the stage as their first hope of making a living. Prior to 1737, plays were de rigueur for authors who were not journalists. This {{had to do with}} the economics of booksellers. A bookseller would purchase a book from an author, whether that book was Gulliver's Travels or Collected Sermons, and would calculate his chances of making money off of sales. He would pay the author according to the money he expected to make. [...] (For example, Goldsmith's The Vicar of Wakefield was famously sold to pay a single rent installment, whereas John Gay had been paid 1,000 pounds for his Poems on Various Occasions, which was more than seven years of salary for his government job). That would be the only money an <b>author</b> <b>would</b> see from the book, and therefore he or she would need to produce a new version, new book, or a serial publication of the next work to have hopes of more income. Prior to 1737, novelists had come from the ranks of satirists (Jonathan Swift) and journalists (Daniel Defoe), but these novels had in common wide changes of scenery, long plots, and often impossible things (such as talking horses)—all features that made the works unsuitable for the stage. The exception was Aphra Behn, who was a dramatist first and a novelist second. Her Oroonoko seems to have been written as a novel simply because there was no time for staging, as it was a political commentary on ongoing events, and she could not have another play on the boards at the time. Her Love-Letters Between a Nobleman and His Sister, like Gulliver's Travels and Moll Flanders, was inappropriate for the stage. [...] However, after 1737, novels began to have dramatic structures involving only normal human beings, as the stage was closed off for serious authors.|$|E
