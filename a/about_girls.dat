25|$|The first track, «Babilla» (Puerto Rican jargon for Courage), {{serves as}} the album's intro, and its concept {{is similar to the}} one in his {{previous}} studio album, Desahogo, being a relief to all that annoys him, mentioning Donald Trump's xenophobia, sexual video games, religion and people who want to take advantage with his music. «Sentimiento» (Spanish for Feeling) talks about a beautiful and attractive woman who wants a sincere romantic relationship and getting married instead of money and luxury. «Se Escapa» (Spanish for She Escapes) is about respecting and taking care of one's girlfriend in order to not lose her. «Moriré» (Spanish for I Will Die) is a romantic ballad about dying for a woman if she is no longer interesed in one's feelings after a long relationship, using a lot of analogies centered in animals and nature. «El Silencio Mata» (Spanish for Silence Kills) talks about a woman who suffers of domestic violence but needs to talk to someone about that, although she's too scared to denounce his own spouse. «El Corazón Se Pone Bruto» (Spanish for The Heart Gets Stupid) is a moralizing reggaeton about thinking before acting and encouraging the use of preservative, telling two stories <b>about</b> <b>girls</b> that are attracted to men they recently know, both with terrible endings (one girl ends pregnant and the other contracting AIDS). «La Prueba de Farmacia» (Spanish for Pharmacy Test) tells the story about a pregnant teenager who tries to convince her mother that her boyfriend will take care of her whatever happens. «Angelina» tells the story about a low class single mother who have to work as a stripper in order to earn enough money to feed her baby after being abandoned by her boyfriend. «Agua» is about Vico's detention in late 2002 because of porting heroin in his car, complaining about the police and Puerto Rican justice.

500|$|The remix {{has also}} {{garnered}} positive reviews; Lowe noted that [...] "Kanye West, Lupe Fiasco, and Pusha T {{make an appearance}} on a somewhat more enjoyable remixed version of [...] ", which added a [...] "nice outside perspective to the otherwise tiresome track". Tom Breihan of The Village Voice called the remix [...] "pretty great" [...] compared to the [...] "horrible hammering" [...] of the original song. He criticized West's lyrics, saying he was [...] "back to talking <b>about</b> <b>girls</b> on his verse again [...] {{without any of the}} humane warmth he used to sometimes bring." [...] The song was number 32 on Rolling Stones list of the 100 Best Songs of 2008.|$|E
500|$|Allmusic {{considered}} the song [...] "By the Way" [...] to combine [...] "fiery Hollywood funk, gentle harmonies, {{a little bit}} of singing <b>about</b> <b>girls,</b> [...] {{a little bit of}} hanging out in the streets in the summertime."

500|$|Calling {{the song}} [...] "a decidedly {{lubricious}} duet", Alex Needham of New Musical Express said that [...] "She sings about boys, he sings <b>about</b> <b>girls.</b> A simple concept, but an effective one, resulting in Britney’s best single [...] ages."

[...] Nicki Tranter of PopMatters said that {{the remainder of the}} album was [...] "tried and tested" [...] dance-pop, noting [...] "Boys" [...] and [...] "Cinderella" [...] revisiting [...] "old Britney territory exploring predictable issues including her love being irreplaceable, her use of the dance floor as an appropriate courting place, and her much-loved girl-ness." [...] Leah Greenblatt of Entertainment Weekly called it a [...] "popping, Janet-esque groove." [...] Yale Daily News writer Catherine Halaby considered the song [...] "an envelope-pushing (when you consider her claims of wholesomeness) smutfest." ...|$|E
500|$|According to Field, the {{transition}} from writing music for an adult rock band to writing children's music was not a big one for The Wiggles. [...] "The Wiggles music isn't all that far removed from {{what we did in}} The Cockroaches, just a different subject matter", Field stated. [...] "The Cockroaches sing <b>about</b> <b>girls</b> and love and stuff like that; The Wiggles sing about hot potatoes and cold spaghetti." [...] Moran stated that The Wiggles wrote songs they liked and would listen to, and then made them appropriate for children. [...] They approached simple and relocatable topics, such as food and nutrition, as teachers would in a pre-school setting, with simple melodies that were easy for children to sing and remember. [...] The group sang the same 60s-style pop as The Cockroaches, but with different lyrics, although they were not confined to songs about love and could write about anything that interested and excited young children, which was limitless. [...] The music they chose to write and perform was influenced by nursery rhymes, folk music, and rock songs of the 1950s and 1960s. [...] Page reported, [...] "First and foremost, we're entertainers". [...] The Wiggles captured the interest of children by first entertaining them, and then by presenting them with educational messages.|$|E
500|$|In early 1991, Anthony Field founded The Wiggles, a children's music group, {{with fellow}} {{university}} students Murray Cook and Greg Page, Phillip Wilcher (from Macquarie University's music department) and The Cockroaches' band mate, Jeff Fatt. In July, they issued their debut album, The Wiggles, which {{was dedicated to}} Paul Field's daughter and sold 70,000 copies. The Wiggles {{went on to become}} [...] "a global powerhouse in children's entertainment". They used former The Cockroaches' members for musical and performing support: Paul, John, and Henry (The Wiggles' character Henry the Octopus was named after him) performed with them on their CDs, DVDs, and stage shows. John helped them write many of their songs. Many early The Wiggles' songs were The Cockroaches' tunes reworked to fit the genre of children's music. According to Anthony, [...] "The Wiggles music isn't all that far removed from what we did in The Cockroaches, just a different subject matter... The Cockroaches sing <b>about</b> <b>girls</b> and love and stuff like that; The Wiggles sing about hot potatoes and cold spaghetti". Paul worked for James Roland Wood, Chief Judge at Common Law, for three years after the band stopped regularly performing and during The Wiggles' formation, which he said gave Anthony time to develop his new band alone, without much input from his brothers. In the mid-1990s, Paul became The Wiggles' talent manager.|$|E

500|$|... "Dumpweed" [...] {{kicks off}} the record, and explores sexual frustration. The song is based around the hook [...] "I need a girl that I can train," [...] as in dog training. DeLonge, the song's {{primarily}} lyricist, explains {{the song in}} a 2000 tour booklet: [...] "Girls are so much smarter than guys and can see the future as well as never forget the past. So that leaves the dog as the only thing men are smarter than." [...] The song is a [...] "callow complaint <b>about</b> <b>girls</b> not always doing exactly what you wish they would," [...] and is followed by Hoppus' [...] "Don't Leave Me," [...] a song about a breakup, in irony. Hoppus wrote the song in ten minutes. The guitar swell preceding the second chorus is actually a digital reversal of the delaying guitar preceding it. [...] "Aliens Exist" [...] originates from DeLonge's interest in UFOs and conspiracy theories. [...] "Going Away to College" [...] was written in ten minutes by Hoppus while at home sick on Valentine's Day 1999. While watching the movie Can't Hardly Wait, Hoppus {{began to think about}} [...] "how much it sucks when people are in love in high school" [...] and are forced to be separated after graduation by different colleges in different cities. Since it was recorded late in production, the band {{had to go back to}} Los Angeles to record Barker's drum track.|$|E
500|$|With {{their love}} of the Beach Boys and late 1960s bubblegum pop, the Ramones paved the way to {{what became known as}} pop punk. In the late 1970s, UK bands such as Buzzcocks and the Undertones {{combined}} pop-style tunes and lyrical themes with punk's speed and chaotic edge. In the early 1980s, some of the leading bands in Southern California's hardcore punk rock scene emphasized a more melodic approach than was typical of their peers. According to music journalist Ben Myers, Bad Religion [...] "layered their pissed off, politicized sound with the smoothest of harmonies"; Descendents [...] "wrote almost surfy, Beach Boys–inspired songs <b>about</b> <b>girls</b> and food and being young(ish)". Epitaph Records, founded by Brett Gurewitz of Bad Religion, was the base for many future pop punk bands. Bands that fused punk with light-hearted pop melodies, such as the Queers and Screeching Weasel, began appearing around the country, in turn influencing bands like Green Day and the Offspring, who brought pop punk wide popularity and major record sales. Bands such as the Vandals and Guttermouth developed a style blending pop melodies with humorous and offensive lyrics. Eventually, the geographically large Midwest U.S. punk scene, anchored largely in places like Chicago and Minneapolis, would spawn bands like Dillinger Four who would take a catchy, hooky pop-punk approach and reinfuse it with some of punk's earlier grit and fury, creating a distinctive punk rock sound with a regional tag. This particular substrate still maintains an identity today. The mainstream pop punk of latter-day bands such as Blink-182 is criticized by many punk rock devotees; in critic Christine Di Bella's words, [...] "It's punk taken to its most accessible point, a point where it barely reflects its lineage at all, except in the three-chord song structures." ...|$|E
500|$|Kiedis focused lyrically {{on sexual}} {{references}} and innuendos {{as they were}} frequently on his mind. Songs such as [...] "Suck My Kiss", [...] "If You Have to Ask", [...] "Sir Psycho Sexy", [...] "Give It Away" [...] and [...] "Blood Sugar Sex Magik" [...] all contained various sexual links, with lyrics like [...] "A state of sexual light / Kissing her virginity / My affinity" [...] and [...] "Glorious euphoria / Is my must / Erotic shock / Is a function of lust." [...] The concept behind [...] "The Greeting Song" [...] was a request by Rubin, who asked Kiedis to write a song solely <b>about</b> <b>girls</b> and cars. Although Kiedis disliked the concept, he wrote the song as Rubin requested and ended up hating nearly {{every aspect of the}} lyrics. Kiedis also began to write about anguish, and the self mutilating thoughts he would experience {{as a result of his}} heroin and cocaine addiction; he believed his life had come to its lowest point under a bridge in downtown Los Angeles. Over a month later, Rubin stumbled upon a poem that would become the lyrics to [...] "Under the Bridge", and suggested Kiedis show it to the rest of the band. Kiedis was, however, apprehensive because he believed the lyrics to be [...] "too soft" [...] and unlike the band's style. After singing the verse to Frusciante, they began structuring the song the next day. The two worked for several hours arranging chords and melodies until they both agreed it was complete. Frusciante ultimately chose the chords he played in the intro to balance out the depressing atmosphere of the song: [...] "my brain interpreted it as being a really sad song so I thought if the lyrics are really sad like that I should write some chords that are happier." [...] "Naked in the Rain" [...] was one of the first songs written for the album and even played once at the end of the Mother's Milk Tour in 1990 while the intros for [...] "The Greeting Song" [...] and [...] "Sir Psycho Sexy" [...] were also teased during the end of that tour but neither song was completed or had lyrics.|$|E

2500|$|Girls' {{basketball}} {{had already}} begun to pervade high schools by the time the IHSA was founded in 1900.

They were worried about injuries and putting girls on public display, calling basketball [...] "not altogether ladylike".
