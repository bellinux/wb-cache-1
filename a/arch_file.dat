5000|$|On 18 July 2014, the High Court {{ordered a}} second inquest into {{the death of}} soldier Pte Cheryl James {{following}} a judicial review brought by her family. The judge found “an insufficiency of inquiry” into her death. The original inquest, held in 1995 soon after her death, lasted barely an hour and recorded an open verdict. Surrey Police was criticised for its handling {{of the case and}} Mr Justice Thornton said that Surrey Police had at first refused full disclosure of the reinvestigation report to Pte James's family. The force eventually handed over 44 lever <b>arch</b> <b>files</b> of documents after being threatened with applying for an order for disclosure. The force said it had now voluntarily provided all relevant material to the family - since being asked to early in 2012 - and what had been disclosed [...] "affords fresh grounds for an inquest". The documents handed over included [...] "important material relating to ballistics, the noise of the gunshot, bullet fragments, the finding of the body, the credibility of some witnesses, and further witnesses". [...] The ruling meant that new inquests were also likely to follow into the deaths of the other three trainee soldiers.|$|R
5000|$|The {{church is}} built in blue lias, parts {{of which are}} covered in pebbledash, and the {{dressings}} are of ashlar. The roof is tiled. The plan consists of a four-bay nave, a two-bay chancel, a west tower and a south porch. [...] The tower is short and has no string courses. At the top four corners are gargoyles, three of which depict winged monsters, the other a human being playing a recorder. [...] The west window has four lights with Perpendicular tracery. The bell-openings have two lights and louvres. At the corners are diagonal buttresses and at the northeast of the tower is a stair turret. At its top is a cornice and crenellations. [...] The north wall of the nave has a six-light straight-headed window in each bay. Two lights {{of one of these}} windows contains stained glass depicting a large number of little ships. Between the windows is a blocked north doorway. The window in the western bay of the south wall has a six-light window similar to those in the north wall. The porch is in the next bay and the windows in the other two bays contain <b>arches</b> <b>filed</b> with glass which used to be the arches between the chapel and the nave. At the east end of the nave wall is a squint with two trefoil-headed openings. [...] Around the top of the nave is a cornice. The north and east sides are fully crenellated but the crenellations on the south wall are only above the two western bays. The chancel is lower and narrower than the nave and is gabled. The east window is arched with three lights and Perpendicular tracery. In the north wall of the chancel is a three-light straight-headed window and in the south wall there is a similar window with a priest's door to its west.|$|R
5000|$|Many {{cultures}} have practiced {{this form of}} body modification. In Bali, teeth were filed down because {{it was thought that}} the teeth represented anger, jealousy, and other similar negative emotions. The teeth were also sharpened as a rite of passage for adolescents. Teeth filing was also used by Aborigines for spiritual reasons, as well as assorted Vietnamese and Sudanese tribes. In Mayan culture, the teeth were sharpened, and sometimes had designs carved into them, to distinguish those in the upper-classes. Many cultures would sharpen their teeth to imitate animals, such as the Wapare of intertropical Africa, who sharpened their teeth to imitate sharks, as well as kicking out some mandibular teeth during puberty. In Ancient China, a group called Ta-ya Kih-lau (打牙仡佬, literally 仡佬 (Gelao people) who beat out their teeth") had every woman about to wed knock out two of her anterior teeth to [...] "prevent damage to the husband's family." [...] Some {{cultures have}} distinctions between which sex does what to their teeth. In the central Congo region, the Upoto tribe has men file only teeth in the maxillary <b>arch,</b> whereas women <b>file</b> both maxillary and mandibular arches. The Mentawai people have also traditionally engaged in this practice.|$|R
