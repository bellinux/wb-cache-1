5|$|An ouster {{clause in}} <b>a</b> <b>statute</b> {{is an attempt}} by the {{legislature}} to prevent an act or decision by a public authority from being challenged before the courts. Such clauses thus serve as a signal to decision-makers that they may operate without fear of intervention by the courts at a later stage. One common kind of ouster clause is the total ouster or finality clause, which is inserted into <b>a</b> <b>statute</b> to indicate that the decision of a particular judge or tribunal is final and cannot be challenged by any court.|$|E

50|$|<b>A</b> race <b>statute</b> will divest {{common law}} title {{from a person}} with {{superior}} title if the subsequent purchaser recorded their deed prior to the person with superior title. <b>A</b> notice <b>statute</b> will divest common law title from a person with superior title if the subsequent purchaser had no notice (either actual or constructive - otherwise known as bona fide) of the true owner's title. <b>A</b> race-notice <b>statute</b> requires <b>a</b> subsequent purchaser to be bona fide and record first.|$|R
5|$|Although Burge {{had been}} {{presumed to be}} {{protected}} by <b>a</b> <b>statute</b> of limitations, the US Attorney for the Northern District of Illinois, Patrick Fitzgerald, in October 2008 charged Burge with two counts {{of obstruction of justice}} and one count of perjury. Burge was arrested on October 21, 2008 at his home in Apollo Beach by FBI agents.|$|E

5|$|I {{am willing}} to hold that, {{as a matter of}} law, <b>a</b> <b>statute</b> like § 93(b), which prohibits a union from {{collecting}} dues from its members, impairs the union's ability to represent those members {{to such an extent that}} it infringes on their § 7 right to bargain through the representative of their choice.|$|E
5000|$|In Altria Group v. Good, the Court reiterates that [...] "Congress may {{indicate}} pre-emptive intent" [...] in two ways: [...] "through <b>a</b> <b>statute's</b> express language or through its structure and purpose. See Jones v. Rath Packing Co., 430 U. S. 519, 525 (1977)".|$|R
50|$|In {{determining}} whether <b>a</b> <b>statute's</b> overbreadth is substantial, the courts consider <b>a</b> <b>statute's</b> application to real-world conduct, not fanciful hypotheticals. See, for example, id., at 301-302. Accordingly, {{the courts have}} repeatedly emphasized that an overbreadth claimant bears the burden of demonstrating, “from the text of law and from actual fact” that substantial overbreadth exists. Virginia v. Hicks, 539 U.S. 113 (2003). Similarly, “there must be a realistic danger that the statute itself will significantly compromise recognized First Amendment protections of parties not before the Court {{for it to be}} facially challenged on overbreadth grounds”. Members of City Council of Los Angeles v. Taxpayers for Vincent, 466 U.S. 789, 801 (1984). In Hoffman Estates v. The Flipside, Hoffman Estates, Inc., the Court held that the doctrine does not apply to commercial speech.|$|R
50|$|In United States v. Howell (1870), the Court {{held that}} <b>a</b> {{counterfeiting}} <b>statute</b> was not void for repugnancy, distinguishing United States v. Cantril (1807), a {{decision of the}} Marshall Court interpreting <b>a</b> nearly identical <b>statute.</b>|$|R
5|$|In 1927, the California {{legislature}} passed <b>a</b> <b>statute</b> {{authorizing the}} California Attorney General to bring claims {{on behalf of}} the tribes in the Court of Claims. The next year, Congress passed <b>a</b> <b>statute</b> granting that court jurisdiction for such claims. California Attorney General Earl Warren (future Chief Justice) finally argued the case in 1941. The court found liability but indicated it would not award pre-judgment interest, and the Supreme Court declined to grant certiorari. Warren negotiated a $5M settlement. After the passage of the Indian Claims Commission Act, the same group of tribes struggled to bring a single action for recovery under the broader claims allowed under the ICCA, which settled for $29M.|$|E
5|$|Once Congress approves {{a salary}} {{reduction}} and the nominee is confirmed, legal experts conclude that in practice {{it is unlikely}} that an appointment would be successfully challenged in the courts. The most likely claimant would be an individual who has been adversely affected by a discretionary decision under the nominee's authority—for example someone denied a passport. It is unlikely that anyone would be found to have standing to contest the appointment. The Supreme Court has become less solicitous of standing since retreating from the most expansive level of United States v. SCRAP. In particular, it has been unwilling to grant standing for a generalized constitutional injury other than to a plaintiff who is protected by <b>a</b> <b>statute</b> or when <b>a</b> <b>statute</b> grants standing.|$|E
5|$|The flag of Indiana was {{designed}} by Paul Hadley and officially adopted {{by the state of}} Indiana on May 31, 1917. It was the state's first official flag and has remained unchanged since then except for the creation of <b>a</b> <b>statute</b> to standardize the production of the flag.|$|E

5|$|The {{privilege}} of trial by peers was still ill-defined, and the statute did not cover peeresses. In 1442, after an ecclesiastical court (which included King Henry VI of England, Henry Beaufort and John Kemp) found Eleanor, Duchess of Gloucester, guilty of witchcraft and banished {{her to the}} Isle of Man, <b>a</b> <b>statute</b> was enacted granting peeresses the right of trial by peers.|$|E
5|$|Trust {{funds are}} {{earmarked}} for specific programs and purposes {{in accordance with}} <b>a</b> <b>statute</b> that designates the fund as a trust. Its statutory designation distinguishes the fund as a trust rather than a special fund. The Highway Trust Fund {{is an example of}} trust funds.|$|E
5|$|William Kempe, the parson of Ditton, was {{sued for}} £80 in 1534 for being absent from his parish and {{for taking a}} stipend for saying prayers for {{the souls of the}} dead (which was {{prohibited}} by <b>a</b> <b>statute</b> of 1529). Although Kempe admitted being absent, he claimed that he was chaplain to baron John Zouche and thus entitled to receive two benefices.|$|E

5|$|Amnesty International organises {{campaigns to}} protect those arrested and or incarcerated as a {{prisoner}} of conscience because of their conscientious beliefs, particularly concerning intellectual, political and artistic freedom of expression and association. Aung San Suu Kyi of Burma, was {{the winner of the}} 2009 Amnesty International Ambassador of Conscience Award. In legislation, a conscience clause is a provision in <b>a</b> <b>statute</b> that excuses a health professional from complying with the law (for example legalising surgical or pharmaceutical abortion) if it is incompatible with religious or conscientious beliefs.|$|E
5|$|Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Baxter Healthcare Pty Ltd, (Baxter) was a {{decision}} of the High Court of Australia, which ruled on 29 August 2007 that Baxter Healthcare Proprietary Limited, a tenderer for various government contracts, was bound by the Trade Practices Act 1974 (TPA, Australian legislation governing anti-competitive behaviour) in its trade and commerce in tendering for government contracts. More generally, the case concerned the principles of derivative governmental immunity: whether the immunity of a government from <b>a</b> <b>statute</b> extends to third parties that conduct business with the government.|$|E
5|$|In Didden v. Village of Port Chester (2006), an {{unrelated}} case {{brought about by}} the same town's actions, Sotomayor joined a unanimous panel's summary order to uphold a trial court's dismissal – due to <b>a</b> <b>statute</b> of limitations lapse – of a property owner's objection to his land being condemned for a redevelopment project. The ruling further said that even without the lapse, the owner's petition would be denied due to application of the Supreme Court's recent Kelo v. City of New London ruling. The Second Circuit's reasoning drew criticism from libertarian commentators.|$|E
50|$|In {{states that}} require strict {{adherence}} by municipal government to statutory grants of authority, <b>an</b> enabling <b>statute</b> {{must be in}} place expressly allowing the creation of historic overlay districts by towns, cities and counties.

5|$|Maine's new {{attorney}} general, Richard S. Cohen (no {{relation to}} the senator) took over negotiations for the state; soon, each side made new concessions. In March 1980, draft legislation {{was approved by the}} tribes' joint negotiating committee and ratified by an advisory referendum of the tribes' membership. This vote also permitted the inclusion of the Houlton Band of Maliseet Indians in the settlement. The Maine state legislature passed the Maine Implementing Act (MIA), <b>a</b> <b>statute</b> enabling the settlement, on April 3, 1980.|$|E
5|$|Officials in Texas, Florida, Alabama, Wyoming, Arizona, Oklahoma and Missouri opposed those {{elements}} of ACA over {{which they had}} discretion. For example, Missouri declined to expand Medicaid or establish a health insurance marketplace engaging in active non-cooperation, enacting <b>a</b> <b>statute</b> forbidding any state or local official to render any aid not specifically required by federal law. Other Republican politicians discouraged efforts to advertise {{the benefits of the}} law. Some conservative political groups launched ad campaigns to discourage enrollment.|$|E
