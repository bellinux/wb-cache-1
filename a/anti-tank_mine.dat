5|$|On 27 May 1942, Heydrich {{planned to}} meet Hitler in Berlin. German {{documents}} suggest that Hitler intended to transfer Heydrich to German-occupied France, where the French resistance was gaining ground. Heydrich {{would have to}} pass a section where the Dresden-Prague road merges with a road to the Troja Bridge. The junction, in the Prague suburb of Libeň, was well suited for the attack because motorists have to slow for a hairpin bend. As Heydrich's car slowed, Gabčík took aim with a Sten submachine gun, but it jammed and failed to fire. Instead of ordering his driver to speed away, Heydrich called his car to halt and attempted to confront the attackers. Kubiš then threw a bomb (a converted <b>anti-tank</b> <b>mine)</b> {{at the rear of}} the car as it stopped. The explosion wounded both Heydrich and Kubiš.|$|E

The mine laying system used on the Fahd is the Nather-2. The mine laying system is equipped with a control unit that computes the tube firing sequence delay time to set mine densities, and adjusts the required dispensing direction. The mines can be dispensed on right, left and backwards of the vehicle.|$|E
25|$|A {{platoon of}} five Cuban T-34-85s saw combat in Angola against South African troops during the Battle of Cassinga. The tanks were based {{along with a}} company of Cuban {{mechanized}} infantry equipped with BTR-152 armoured personnel carriers. In May 1978, South Africa launched a major airborne raid on Cassinga {{with the objective of}} destroying a South West African People's Organisation (SWAPO) base there. The Cuban forces were mobilised to stop them. As they approached Cassinga they were strafed by South African aircraft, which destroyed most of the BTR-152s and three of the T-34-85s; a fourth T-34-85 was disabled by an <b>anti-tank</b> <b>mine</b> buried in the road. The remaining tank continued to engage the withdrawing South African paratroops from a hull down position until the battle was over.|$|E
25|$|Introduced in 1942, {{the grenade}} saw service with the British Army until 1955. The United States Army {{also used the}} grenade, as well as {{developing}} their own variant known as the M7 light <b>anti-tank</b> <b>mine.</b> When used in an anti-tank role, {{a number of the}} grenades could be strung together in a 'daisy chain' at intervals of around two feet, and then placed across a road to damage an armoured vehicle. It was particularly effective at damaging the tracks of a tank. When sufficient grenades were grouped together, they were capable of disabling a medium tank. The Hawkins was also used in other roles, such as breaching walls, and its small size also meant that it could easily be placed into the 'web' of a railway line and, when detonated, destroy a section of track.|$|E

In late May, Russia announced that it was closing the Russian-Chechnya border in an attempt to combat attacks and criminal activity; border guards were ordered to shoot suspects on sight. On 18 June 1999, seven servicemen were killed when Russian border guard posts were attacked in Dagestan. On 29 July 1999, the Russian Interior Ministry troops destroyed a Chechen border post and captured an 800 meter-section of strategic road. On 22 August 1999, 10 Russian policemen were killed by an <b>anti-tank</b> <b>mine</b> blast in North Ossetia, and, on 9 August 1999, six servicemen were kidnapped in the Ossetian capital Vladikavkaz.|$|E
500|$|The German {{defensive}} preparations and {{the lack}} of any defense in depth indicated that their plan was to stop the invasion at the beaches. Four lines of obstacles were constructed in the intertidal zone. The first, a non-contiguous line with a small gap in the middle of Dog White and a larger gap across the whole of Easy Red, was [...] out from the highwater line and consisted of 200 Belgian Gates with mines lashed to the uprights. [...] behind these was a continuous line of logs driven into the sand pointing seaward, every third one capped with an <b>anti-tank</b> <b>mine.</b> Another [...] shoreward of this line was a continuous line of 450 ramps sloping towards the shore, also with mines attached and designed to force flat-bottomed landing craft to ride up and either flip or detonate the mine. The final line of obstacles was a continuous line of hedgehogs [...] from the shoreline. The area between the shingle bank and the bluffs was both wired and mined, and mines were also scattered on the bluff slopes.|$|E

2500|$|Wintringham {{advised that}} a tank that was {{isolated}} from supporting infantry was potentially vulnerable {{to men who}} had the required determination and cunning to get close. Rifles or even a shotgun would be sufficient to persuade the crew to close all the hatches, and then {{the view from the}} tank is very limited; a turret-mounted machine gun has a very slow traverse and cannot hope to fend off attackers coming from all directions. Once sufficiently close, it is possible to hide where the tank's gunner cannot see: [...] "The most dangerous distance away from a tank is 200 yards; the safest distance is six inches." [...] Petrol bombs will soon produce a pall of blinding smoke, and a well-placed explosive package or even a stout iron bar in the tracks can immobilise the vehicle, leaving it at the mercy of further petrol bombs– which will suffocate the engine and possibly the crew– or an explosive charge or <b>anti-tank</b> <b>mine.</b>|$|E
2500|$|The grenade was {{rectangular}} {{in shape}} and approximately [...] in length and [...] in width, and weighed about [...] Its explosive content consisted of around [...] of blasting explosive, which was usually either ammonal or TNT. On {{the top of the}} grenade was a plate, under which the user would insert a chemical igniter, which would act as the weapon's fuse. When a vehicle drove over the grenade, its weight crushed the plate, which in turn cracked the igniter; this then leaked acid onto a sensitive chemical which detonated the charge. The grenade was designed so that it could either be thrown at a vehicle like an ordinary anti-tank grenade, or placed at a location when used as an <b>anti-tank</b> <b>mine.</b> It was also fitted with areas where blasting caps or cordtex could be placed, so that it {{could be used as a}} demolition charge. When the grenade was used, it was recommended that the user be within a short distance of their target, ideally concealed within a trench; if the target were an armoured vehicle, then the best areas to target were the sides and rear, where the engine compartment was located and armour was generally thinner.|$|E
2500|$|Since the {{invasion}} of Europe, the American army had suffered greater than expected losses, and found slashing German armored counter-attacks particularly difficult. Learning from this, overall American tactics began to include a defense in depth, using mobile armored cavalry squadrons with light tanks and anti-tank guns to screen defensive positions behind them. When attacked, these cavalry units would delay the Germans for a short time, then retreat through stronger positions to their rear. These positions consisted of fortifications set around terrain choke points like villages, passes, and bridges. In the area of Elsenborn Ridge, the twin villages and the area of Domäne Bütgenbach {{proved to be the}} best areas for defense. Machine gun and infantry positions would be protected by barbed wire and mine fields. <b>Anti-tank</b> <b>mine</b> [...] "daisy chains" [...] were also prepared. These were composed of a line of mines lashed in a row. This chain of mines would be dragged across a road with a rope when a column of German tanks threatened to advance down the road. This defensive line would be backed by bazooka positions in buildings, dug-in anti-tank guns, and tank destroyers firing from covered positions further in the rear.|$|E
