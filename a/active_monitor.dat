This article describes the results of using cost-effective passive diffusion tubes for measuring NO₂ in outdoor environments. Samplers are compared against a collocated chemiluminescence (<b>active)</b> <b>monitor</b> in a gas exposure chamber for concentration of NO₂ between 10 and 200 ppb/v (parts per billion per volume). In these calibration experiments diffusion samplers had strong correlation to the <b>active</b> <b>monitor,</b> R 2 = 0. 94 for a one week sample interval, and a R 2 = 0. 91 for a two week sample interval. A four week study was conducted with a collocated <b>active</b> <b>monitor</b> and a total of 42 samplers. The samplers were divided into 6 groups and exposed in one week and two week intervals under environmental conditions: temperature 18 - 31 °C, relative humidity 27 - 57 %, wind speed 0. 4 - 3 m/s, and NO₂ concentration 2 - 22 ppb/v. The precision, calculated as the relative standard deviation, for the one week sample interval was found to be 8. 2 %, and for the two week sample interval 20. 2 %. Three cleaning methods of exposed samplers are compared in order to identify bias in reusing components.

In our study, we provide new insights on how to perform efficiently <b>active</b> <b>monitoring</b> in these networks, suggesting the use of light and multipurpose probing streams able to capture simultaneously the behavior of multiple QoS metrics of each class. Considering oneway -delay, jitter and loss metrics, we explore different spatial-temporal characteristics of probing, focusing on finding patterns adjusted to each class measurement requirements.

40|$|Abstract Today cloud {{computing}} {{has become a}} key technology for online allotment of computing resources and online storage of user data in a lower cost where computing resources are available all the time over the Internet with pay per use concept. Recently {{there is a growing}} need for resource management strategies in a {{cloud computing}} environment that encompass both end-users satisfaction and a high job submission throughput with appropriate scheduling. One of the major and essential issues in resource management is related to allocate incoming tasks to suitable virtual machine matchmaking. The main objective {{of this paper is to}} propose a matchmaking strategy between the incoming requests and various resources in the cloud environment to satisfy the requirements of users and to load balance the workload on resources. Load Balancing is an important aspect of resource management in a cloud computing environment. So this paper proposes a dynamic weight <b>active</b> <b>monitor</b> DWAM load balance algorithm which allocates on the fly the incoming requests to the all available virtual machines in an efficient manner in order to achieve better performance parameters such as response time processing time and resource utilization. The feasibility of the proposed algorithm is analyzed using Cloudsim simulator which proves the superiority of the proposed DWAM algorithm over its counterparts in literature. Simulation results demonstrate that proposed algorithm dramatically improves response time data processing time and more utilized of resource compared <b>Active</b> <b>monitor</b> and VM-assign algorithms...|$|E

Consistent with predictions of a recent theoretical paper by Bond, Goldstein, and Prescott (2009, “BGP”), we find that a possible value-increasing intervention weakens the informational efficiency of markets and that the monitor commits numerous intervention errors. Not anticipated by BGP, we find that a possible value-decreasing action also affects market performance. Further, in both cases the <b>active</b> <b>monitor</b> undermines allocative efficiency, particularly for market fundamentals close to the efficient intervention cutoff...|$|E

A rear facet (RF) regenerating light has an inclination angle that {{is larger than}} 0 degree and smaller than 90 degrees based on an active laser layer (LS) at an angle that is equal to 0 degree. The <b>active</b> <b>monitor</b> diode layer is arranged {{in an area of}} the rear facet below the active laser layer between two n-p- or p-n-semiconductor layers, where the laser diode is switched in a conducting direction and a monitor diode (MD) is switched in a blocking direction for the current. USE - Used as a transmitter for laser light in diplexer-chip for a passive optical network, in a laser structure e. g. buried hetero-structure-distributed feed back (BH-DFB) -laser structure and p-n-p laser structure, and in an optical transmitting module. ADVANTAGE - The laser diode is switched in the conducting direction and the monitor diode is switched in the blocking direction for the current, thus switching the laser and monitor diodes over a common branch, without mutually influencing the laser and monitor diodes. The diode facilitates marginal additional costs during manufacture of the laser diode by the parallel monolithic integration of the monitor diode and large module compactness to achieve space saving opposite to an optical series connection of the laser and monitor diodes. The laser diode is designed in such a manner that the monitor diode works temperature-independently in each laser design, thus generating reliable measuring signal in the area of optimal absorption. The diode can be implemented in different design types in a cost-effective manner. The inclination angle of the rear facet is larger than 0 degree and smaller than 90 degrees based on the active laser layer in the angle that is equal to 0 degree, thus directing the laser light occurring in the rear facet and reflecting the light {{in the direction of the}} substrate layer, and hence avoiding regenerations in the active laser layer...|$|E

Therefore, multiple processes can be used for successful prospective memory.

40|$|Recently most {{maritime}} {{countries in}} the world have fitted automatic identification system (AIS) in vessel traffic services (VTS) in compliance with regulations of International Convention in order to identify ship name and collect ship information. Traditionally VTS operators use automatic radar plotting aids (ARPA) to get ship maneuvering information for preventing ships from navigational faults. Although the two equipments can provide similar functions for VTS, the operational theory of them is quite different. In this study an experimental observation was carried out by means of ARPA radar and AIS fitted in the building of Merchant Marine Department, NTOU. The detected information was analyzed for comparison of their difference on characteristics. Results reveal that AIS can detect target ships with wider area coverage, larger quantity and more voyage information than ARPA radar. The latter can provide an <b>active</b> <b>monitor</b> to detect small ships that can not be done by AIS. Consequently for navigation safety VTS operators must concentrate on ARPA radar in priority and use AIS as supplementary installation for identification of ships. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E

40|$|Controller area {{networks}} (CAN) {{are widely}} used {{in the development of}} embedded real-time systems. As embedded systems are becoming more complex, the development of dependable software for such systems has become a challenging problem. In this paper, we propose a technique to develop dependable synchronization code for CAN-based embedded systems. Our approach is to factor out synchronization as a separate aspect, synthesize synchronization code and then compose it with the functional code. Specifically, we allow the designer of a CAN-based application to first design core functional code. The designer can then annotate the functional code with control points and specify high-level "global invariants " specifying the synchronization policies. Our methodology generates synchronization code based on message passing in a CAN system and then automatically integrates the synchronization code into the functional code at appropriate control points. We propose and evaluate two solutions: one of which is based on a centralized <b>active</b> <b>monitor</b> and the other is a decentralized solution based on replication. The synchronization code developed is derived from high-level formal specifications via formal methods and is correct-by-construction, and will guarantee high assurance in safety-critical applications. ...|$|E

In fact, the network parameter seen from the point where the generator will be installed is a relevant parameter for the voltage source inverter (VSI) control. For example, in [11, 12], current harmonic is injected from the VSI with the goal of grid impedance information.|$|R
