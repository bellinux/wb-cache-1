40|$|Malaria caused {{mostly by}} P. falciparum and P. vivax, {{remains one of}} the most {{important}} infectious diseases in the world. The numbers of antimalarial drugs in use are very small. Drug toxicity must be acceptable to patients and should cause less harm than the disease itself. Assessment of hazard and risk varies throughout drug development as more persons are exposed for longer periods of time and more nonclinical information on the hazard is collected and evaluated. Cancer risk for human pharmaceuticals is important because drugs are taken at pharmacologically active doses and often on a chronic basis. Epidemiologic studies on patient populations have limited value because of the long latency period for most cancers and because these studies lack sensitivity. Besides the mutagenicity and genotoxicity testing of antimalarial drugs as a part of pre-clinical trials, there are several literatures confirming the mutagenicity and genotoxicity of marketed antimalarial drugs. Genetic abnormalities may also play a part in the incidence and severity of adverse reactions to drugs. In this paper, <b>a</b> <b>comprehensive</b> <b>review</b> <b>o...</b>|$|E
40|$|The use {{of ozone}} (O 3) gas as a therapy in {{alternative}} medicine has attracted skepticism {{due to its}} unstable molecular structure. However, copious volumes of research have provided evidence that O 3 's dynamic resonance structures facilitate physiological interactions useful in treating a myriad of pathologies. Specifically, O 3 therapy induces moderate oxidative stress when interacting with lipids. This interaction increases endogenous production of antioxidants, local perfusion, and oxygen delivery, as well as enhances immune responses. We have conducted <b>a</b> <b>comprehensive</b> <b>review</b> of <b>O</b> 3 therapy, investigating its contraindications, routes and concentrations of administration, mechanisms of action, disinfectant properties in various microorganisms, and its medicinal use in different pathologies. We explore the therapeutic value of O 3 in pathologies of the cardiovascular system, gastrointestinal tract, genitourinary system, central nervous system, head and neck, musculoskeletal, subcutaneous tissue, and peripheral vascular disease. Despite compelling evidence, further studies are essential to mark it as a viable and quintessential treatment option in medicine...|$|R
