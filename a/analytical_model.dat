40|$|Recently, a {{large number}} of human-computer {{interface}} (HCI) researchers have investigated building <b>analytical</b> <b>models</b> of the user, which are often implemented as computer models. These models simulate the cognitive processes and task knowledge of the user in ways that allow a researcher or designer to estimate various aspects of an interface's usability, such as when user errors are likely to occur. This information can lead to design improvements. <b>Analytical</b> <b>models</b> can supplement design guidelines by providing designers rigorous ways of analyzing the information-processing requirements of specific tasks (i. e., task analysis). These models offer the potential of improving early designs and replacing some of the early phases of usability testing, thus reducing the cost of interface design. This paper describes some of the many <b>analytical</b> <b>models</b> that are currently being developed and evaluates the usefulness of <b>analytical</b> <b>models</b> for human-computer interface design. This paper will focus on computational, <b>analytical</b> <b>models,</b> such as the GOMS model, rather than less formal, verbal models, because the more exact predictions and task descriptions of computational models may be useful to designers.

40|$|There is a {{need for}} energy-aware models of {{manufacturing}} systems that link the physics of energy consumption at the individual machine-level to the energy consumption at the factory-level.
