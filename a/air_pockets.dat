5|$|Pelicans {{are very}} large birds with very long bills characterised by a downcurved hook {{at the end}} of the upper mandible, and the {{attachment}} of a huge gular pouch to the lower. The slender rami of the lower bill and the flexible tongue muscles form the pouch into a basket for catching fish and, sometimes, rainwater, though in order not to hinder the swallowing of large fish, the tongue itself is tiny. They have a long neck and short stout legs with large, fully webbed feet. Although they are among the heaviest of flying birds, they are relatively light for their apparent bulk because of <b>air</b> <b>pockets</b> in the skeleton and beneath the skin enabling them to float high in the water. The tail is short and square. The wings are long and broad, suitably shaped for soaring and gliding flight, and have the unusually large number of 30 to 35 secondary flight feathers.|$|E

5|$|Beacon Hill Station {{opened to}} the public on July 18, 2009 during a weekend of free service celebrating the inaugural day of Central Link service. The line's opening was delayed from its {{projected}} July 3 date due in part to slowdowns in Beacon Hill construction. The year after the line opened, nine <b>air</b> <b>pockets</b> above the tunnel, caused by soil slides above the tunnel boring machine, were discovered and filled with cement to prevent sinkholes. Service to the southbound platforms at Beacon Hill and Mount Baker were suspended for a daylong emergency drill in November 2010, briefly restricting service to the northbound platform while maintaining a 10-minute headway. During a winter storm in January 2012, an overnight train running to keep the overhead catenary free of ice stalled inside the Beacon Hill Tunnel, allowing for ice build up that canceled Link service for several hours. In late 2013, Beacon Hill Station was closed for two hours after the discovery of smoke in the tunnel, station, and nearby Mount Baker Station, coming from a homeless encampment {{on the west side of}} Beacon Hill. The incident prompted Sound Transit to hold meetings with the Seattle Fire Department on preventing a total system shut-down in the event of an electrical fire.|$|E
25|$|Aerogel is a {{material}} that is 98.2% air. Aerogel has a porous solid network that contains <b>air</b> <b>pockets,</b> with the <b>air</b> <b>pockets</b> taking {{up the majority of}} space within the material. The lack of solid material allows aerogel to be almost weightless.|$|E

25|$|Forus {{had several}} factors which contributed to {{difficult}} aviation conditions and accidents. The runways were not well-leveled, {{in part because}} of poor workmanship and {{in part because of}} soft soil.

25|$|One {{reason for}} {{the large amount of}} {{casualties}} was that when the walls began to fall down, the heavy roofs would collapse, leaving few <b>air</b> <b>pockets</b> in them. The dust and lack of oxygen contributed to the suffocation of survivors. The Iranian government promised to prosecute anyone who violated building regulations, even setting up a special unit to deal with the issue.|$|E
25|$|The {{preliminary}} {{examination of the}} bodies revealed that they were naturally mummified. The grotto {{in which they had}} been interred acted as a perfect cast for the buried bodies, eliminating the formation of <b>air</b> <b>pockets</b> that normally facilitate the process of decomposition. Moreover, the low humidity of the grotto's air and the lack of organisms in its soil slowed the total decay of the bodies.|$|E

40|$|A {{pressurized}} water {{system may be}} subjected to high pressure surges because of the expulsion of a trapped <b>air</b> <b>pocket</b> through an orifice at the downstream end of the pipe. Results are presented of laboratory experiments, in which pressure histories were recorded for different upstream heads, <b>air</b> <b>pocket</b> volumes and orifice sizes. The resulting pressure oscillation pattern was divided into two distinct stages: a first phase of low-frequency pressure oscillation during the air release, followed by a sudden pressure increase with water hammer characteristics when the water column reaches the orifice. The experimental results show out that {{the duration of the}} first phase decreases substantially with increasing upstream head and orifice size, and increases with <b>air</b> <b>pocket</b> volume. A simple relationship was deduced, which agrees well with experimental data. The maximum pressure peaks, always observed in the water hammer phase, increased with upstream head and orifice size, while the volume of the <b>air</b> <b>pocket</b> appeared to be a less significant factor in the range investigated. A simple predictive equation was deduced based on Allievi-Joukowski results...|$|R
40|$|The roof {{inside a}} ship tank {{is exposed to}} {{different}} impact load scenarios during sloshing at high fillings. This work is a detailed study of the load exerted near the tank corner when the incoming wave entraps an <b>air</b> <b>pocket.</b> This <b>air</b> <b>pocket</b> is compressed by the wave. After this initial compression the pressure inside the <b>air</b> <b>pocket</b> starts to oscillate qualitatively as a damped mass-spring system. A similar type of impact occurs when a breaking shallow water wave entraps an <b>air</b> <b>pocket</b> on a sea wall. Different sources for the decay mechanism has been proposed such as air leakage. In this work experiments and numerical work using the boundary element method (BEM) is carried out to investigate this decay mechanism in detail. The tank {{is shown in figure}} 1 and is con-sidered in both the experiments and the numeri-cal work. The dimensions of the tank is height H= 0. 98 [m] and breadth L= 1. 0 [m].

The divers' entrance was later labeled a 'failure' by the Central Disaster Countermeasure Headquarters. On 19 April, a Navy petty officer who was injured during rescue operations died. On 21 April, remotely operated underwater vehicles began {{to be used for}} operations. On 24 April, the CR2000 'Crabster' robot was sent to the rescue site. On 6 May, a diver working for Undine Marine Industries died during the search. This was followed by another diver's death on 30 May.

25|$|Belugas use {{sounds and}} {{echolocation}} for movement, communication, to find breathing {{holes in the}} ice, and to hunt in dark or turbid waters. They produce a rapid sequence of clicks that pass through the melon, which acts as an acoustic lens to focus the sounds into a beam that is projected forward through the surrounding water. These sounds spread through the water at a speed of nearly 1.6km per second, some four {{times faster than the}} speed of sound in the air. The sound waves rebound from objects in the water and return as echoes that are heard and interpreted by the animal. This enables them to determine the distance, speed, size, shape, and even the internal structure of the objects within the beam of sound. They also use this ability when moving around the thick ice sheets of the Arctic, to find areas of unfrozen water for breathing, or <b>air</b> <b>pockets</b> trapped under the frozen sheet ice.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Metal {{stamping}} {{is widely}} used in the mass-production process of the automobile industry. During the stamping process, air may be trapped between the draw die and the panel. The high pressure of trapped air induces imperfections on the panel surface and creates a situation where an extremely high tonnage of punch is required. To prevent these problems, many air ventilation holes are drilled through the draw die and the punch. The present work has developed a simplified mathematical formulation for computing {{the pressure of the}} <b>air</b> <b>pocket</b> based on the ideal gas law and isentropic relation. The pressure of the <b>air</b> <b>pocket</b> was compared to the results by the commercial CFD code, Fluent, and experiments. The present work also used the Bisection method to calculate the optimum cross-sectional area of the air ventilation holes, which did not make the pressure of the <b>air</b> <b>pocket</b> exceed the prescribed maximum value...|$|R

Why do air bubbles ascend and not descend? Why does an air bubble’s diameter increase during ascent? How fast does an air bubble move? How {{long does it take}} till an air bubble reaches the surface? Now, we will occupy ourselves with the motion of an <b>air</b> <b>pocket</b> in a liquid. We introduce the following quantities: r = radius of the gas pocket o = surface tension of the liquid p = pressure g = acceleration of gravity (earth’s acceleration) ϕF = density of the liquid ϕG = density of the gas T 0 = depth of the <b>air</b> <b>pocket</b> at the beginning in the liquid h = heigt that the <b>air</b> <b>pocket</b> has ascended see the figure...|$|R
25|$|Some select {{species of}} ant in the Australian {{mangroves}} because {{the advantage of}} living in a mangrove is less competition from other ants. Unfortunately, this is because the mangrove is considered to be highly undesirable by most ant species due to the two daily inundations. However, all mangrove ants have a remarkable ability that allows them to survive these floods which would otherwise exterminate all ant colonies in a single wave. All of these ants use some method to create a sealed pocket of air to protect from any water gathering inside the nest. To avoid drowning during high tide, some ants escape to higher parts of the trees, whereas others hide in air-filled cavities in the mangrove trees or in <b>air</b> <b>pockets</b> in the mangrove mud. These retreats have limited air volumes, and they are therefore subject to extreme changes in the oxygen and carbon dioxide concentrations. This creates a problem when there are limited oxygen levels for large colonies.|$|E
