40|$|Purpose: The aim of {{the work}} was the {{comparison}} of corrosion resistance in an aqueous sulfuric acid solution of two high-manganese <b>austenitic</b> <b>steels</b> of the 0. 05 C- 25 Mn-Al-Si-Nb-Ti type in a plastically deformed state. Design/methodology/approach: Investigations were carried out on specimens obtained from a thermo-mechanically rolled sheet and then plastically deformed through bending and immersed in corrosive solutions (1 N H 2 SO 4) for 100 hours. The mass decrement was calculated by the gravimetric method, whereas the character of corrosion damages was observed in metallographic investigations using light and scanning electron microscopes both in the polished and etched states. Findings: It was found that after the thermo-mechanical processing one steel is characterized by an austenitic structure with numerous annealing twins, whereas in the second steel lamellar martensitic phases in an austenitic matrix occur. The investigations showed that the examined high-manganese steels have very low corrosion resistance in normal H 2 SO 4. Higher impact on the corrosion resistance than the phase composition has the chemical composition. The mass decrement of the steel with martensite plates is a bit higher than that witha single-phase austenitic matrix. The specimens were intensively dissolved due to general corrosion accompanying by pitting and hydrogen cracking. Research limitations/implications: To investigate in more detail the corrosion behaviour of high-manganese <b>austenitic</b> <b>steels,</b> the polarization tests and the analysis of corrosion products should be carried out. Practical implications: The obtained results {{can be used for}} searching the appropriate way of improving the corrosion resistance of high-strength high-manganese <b>austenitic</b> <b>steels.</b> Originality/value: The corrosion resistance of two types of advanced high-manganese <b>austenitic</b> <b>steels</b> with different initial structures was compared.

The specimens of the investigated steels were subjected to tests after heat treatment, i. e. solution heat treatment (1200 °C/ 0. 5 h/water) and aged at a temperature of 700 °C for 12 h, with cooling in air. The heat treated specimens were then subjected to low-cycle fatigue tests (LCF), carried out at room temperature and at an increased temperature of 600 °C.

May, 2013 Hojjat Gholizadeh The mechanical properties of steels are influenced by their plastic deformations.

50|$|The {{advanced}} {{nature of}} the aircraft meant that new construction methods had to be developed. Several materials were considered for construction and two specialist grades of steel were selected: a titanium-stabilized 18-8 <b>austenitic</b> <b>steel</b> and a 12%-Cr steel used in gas turbines (Firth-Vickers Rex 448). These had to be manufactured to better tolerances in sufficient quantities for construction to start. The 12% chromium stainless steel with a honeycomb centre {{was used for the}} construction of the outer skin, to which no paint was applied. Riveting was a potential method for construction but the new arc welding technique using an Argon gas shield known as puddle welding was used. There were long delays with the method, which was less than satisfactory. The W. G.

5000|$|... 316 {{stainless}} steel, {{also referred}} to as marine grade stainless steel, is a chromium, nickel, molybdenum alloy of steel that exhibits relatively good strength and corrosion resistance. Along with the titanium alloy Ti6Al4V, 316 stainless is a common choice of material for biomedical implants. Although Ti6Al4V provides greater strength per weight and corrosion resistance, 316 stainless components can be more economical to produce. However, immune system reaction to nickel is a potential complication of 316.

50|$|Given {{that the}} turbine blades {{in a water}} turbine are {{constantly}} exposed to water and dynamic forces, {{they need to have}} high corrosion resistance and strength. The most common material used in overlays on carbon steel runners in water turbines are <b>austenitic</b> <b>steel</b> alloys that have 17% to 20% chromium to increase stability of the film which improves aqueous corrosion resistance. The chromium content in these steel alloys exceed the minimum of 12% chromium required to exhibit some atmospheric corrosion resistance. Having a higher chromium concentration in the steel alloys allows for a much longer lifespan of the turbine blades. Currently, the blades are made of martensitic stainless steels which have high strength compared to austenitic stainless steels by a factor of 2. Besides corrosion resistance and strength as the criteria for material selection, weld-ability and density of the turbine blade. Greater weld-ability allows for easier repair of the turbine blades. This also allows for higher weld quality which results in a better repair. Selecting a material with low density is important to achieve higher efficiency because the lighter blades rotate more easily. The most common material used in Kaplan Turbine blades are stainless steel alloys (SS). The different alloys used are SS(16Cr-5Ni), SS(13Cr-4Ni), SS(13Cr-1Ni). The martensitic stainless steel alloys have high strength, thinner sections than standard carbon steel, and reduced mass that enhances the hydrodynamic flow conditions and efficiency of the water turbine. The SS(13Cr-4Ni) has been shown to have improved erosion resistance at all angles of attack through the process of laser hardening. It is important to minimize erosion in order to maintain high efficiencies because erosion negatively impacts the hydraulic profile of the blades which reduces the relative ease to rotate.|$|E
