50|$|After {{the initial}} batch of airfields was {{completed}} using SMT, the Army aviation engineers switched {{almost exclusively to}} another surfacing material known as prefabricated hessian (burlap) surfacing (PBS). Light and easily transportable, PBS did not create the dust problem encountered with SMT fields. Made of an <b>asphalt-impregnated</b> jute delivered in rolls 300 feet in length and 36 inches or 43 inches in width, PBS was laid in overlapping layers to produce a dust-free fair weather surface. It was also common to build airstrips using both SMT and PBS, laying SMT on top.|$|E
50|$|The Japanese {{generally}} were poorly {{prepared for}} the proper packaging of ammunition {{at the start of}} the war. Ammunition of all kinds was packed in wooden boxes with fillers to hold it in position, and only the most rudimentary protection against moisture was provided by tarring joints and knot holes and occasionally wrapping rounds in wax paper for additional waterproofing. In view of the faulty packaging, it was common for 50 per cent to 90 per cent of hand grenades and mortar shells to fail to function. Now, however, the Japanese are utilizing metal and <b>asphalt-impregnated</b> paper linings for their ammunition containers, and consequently deterioration has been materially lessened.|$|E
50|$|It was an {{all-weather}} temporary field {{built by}} the XII Engineer Command using a graded earth compacted surface, with prefabricated hessian (burlap) surfacing (PHS). PHS was made of an <b>asphalt-impregnated</b> jute rolled out over the compacted surface over a square mesh track (SMT) grid of wire joined in 3-inch squares. Pierced Steel Planking was also used for parking areas, {{as well as for}} dispersal sites, when it was available. In addition, tents were used for billeting and support facilities; an access road was built to the existing road infrastructure; a dump for supplies, ammunition, and gasoline drums; drinkable water and a minimal electrical grid for communications and station lighting.|$|E

50|$|Wall sheathing, {{usually a}} plywood or other laminate, is usually {{applied to the}} framing prior to erection, thus {{eliminating}} the need to scaffold, and again increasing speed and cutting manpower needs and expenses. Some types of exterior sheathing, such as <b>asphalt-impregnated</b> fiberboard, plywood, oriented strand board and waferboard, will provide adequate bracing to resist lateral loads and keep the wall square. (Construction codes in most jurisdictions require a stiff plywood sheathing.) Others, such as rigid glass-fiber, asphalt-coated fiberboard, polystyrene or polyurethane board, will not. In this latter case, the wall should be reinforced with a diagonal wood or metal bracing inset into the studs. In jurisdictions subject to strong wind storms (hurricane countries, tornado alleys) local codes or state law will generally require both the diagonal wind braces and the stiff exterior sheathing regardless of the type and kind of outer weather resistant coverings.|$|E
5000|$|Tar {{paper has}} been in use for centuries. Originally felt was made from {{recycled}} rags but today felts are made of recycled paper products (typically cardboard) and sawdust. The most common product is #15 felt. Before the oil crisis, felt weighed about 15 pounds per square (one square = 100 square feet) and hence the <b>asphalt-impregnated</b> felt was called [...] "15#" [...] and [...] "15-pound felt". Modern, inorganic mats no longer weigh 0.73 kg/m2, and to reflect this fact the new felts are called [...] "#15". In fact, #15 mats can weigh from 7.5 to 12.5 pounds/sq depending on the manufacturer and the standard to which felt is made (i.e., CGSB, ASTM D227 Standard Specification for Coal-tar saturated Organic Felt Used in Roofing and Waterproofing, ASTM D4990, Standard Specification for Coal Tar Glass Felt Used in Roofing and Waterproofing, or none). Thirty-pound (30#) felt is now #30 felt, and usually weighs 16 to 27 pounds per square.|$|E
40|$|The {{manufacture}} of molded pulp products 2 involves the forming, drying, and finishing of articles as individual pieces, {{in contrast to}} the making up of sheets of paper or paperboard on a paper machine and then converting these sheets into shaped articles. It represents {{only a small part of}} the paper and pulp industry, particularly so far as ton-nage is concerned, but its products are almost unlimited in their variety of uses. They range from molded pie plates, of which several million are used each day by bakeries throughout the country, to wood-pulp sewer pipe (<b>asphalt-impregnated)</b> and heavy-walled containers for grease and other fluids. Many types of containers, toys, and novelty products are molded from pulp. Raw Materials Waste paper is often used as a source of pulp in the pulp-molding industry. Florist vases, toys, egg cartons, and similar-class products are generally made with repulped waste paper to which has been added about 1 percent of papermaker ' s rosin or wax size. Ground-wood or bleached sulfite pulp is employed in making pie plates and other food containers. -The information in this report is based on trade literature unverifie...|$|E
40|$|The Buckhorn asphalt quarry in the {{northern}} part of the Arbuckle Mountains, Oklahoma, contains chemically well preserved marine invertebrate fossils of Middle Pennsylvanian age. The main purpose of this investigation was to study the chemistry of these fossils, and at the same time analyze the geologic setting of the deposits containing the fossils. Due to early sealing by oil, many of the shells still have the original aragonite and nacreous luster. The oil prevented the grainstones from becoming well cemented and allowed them to become compacted during the Arbuckle orogeny. Deformation related to this orogeny probably caused the devolatization of the oil and, hence, conversion into asphalt. Most of the fossils occur as fragments in several skeletal debris grainstones which are shallow, turbulent water inferred channel deposits. The ancient shoreline was only six miles to the northeast. Underlying calcareous sponge spicule-echinoderm-brachiopod-fusulinid mudstones and wackestones were deposited in less turbulent water environments. Mineralogical data were obtained by means of x-ray diffraction, infrared spectroscopy, and chemical staining. Quantitative analyses of the elemental constituents for various shell layers were obtained with an electron microprobe. The original mineralogy of skeletal carbonates was established for the first time in the following. Aragonite occurs in the inner layers of the gastropods Naticopsis wortheni and Trachydomia whitei, whereas their outer layers consist of calcite. Aragonite also occurs in the shell walls of the scaphopod Plagioglypta ? sp., the coiled nautiloids Metacoceras cornutum, and Domatoceras sp., and the ammonoids Pseudoparalegoceras sp. and Wellerites mohri ?. The orthocone nautiloid "Orthoceras" unicamera has aragonitic shell walls, septa, and cameral deposits. Skeletons of the foraminifera Globivalulina sp. and Wedekinellina ? sp., the presumed tabulate Chaetetes cf. favosus, the cryptostome bryozoans Penniretepora ? sp. and Streblotrypa ? sp., the brachiopod Anthracospirifer opimus, four ostracodes, and the spines of the echinoid Archaeocidaris megastyla ? consist of calcite. As reported by others, calcitic outer layers and inner aragonitic layers were also found in Bellerophon (Bellerophon) sp., Straparollus (Euomphalus) sp., and Chaenocardia ovata. The shell walls and cameral deposits of Pseudorthoceras knoxense also are aragonitic. Previously unreported moderately high Mg contents occur in the calcite of Chaetetes cf. favosus. The spines of Archaeocidaris megastyla ? are inferred to have been originally Mg-calcite. Diagenetic effects were detected in the skeletal carbonates. The amount of replacement calcite and degree of obliteration of shell microarchitecture in the skeletal aragonites increase with decreasing asphalt content. <b>Asphalt-impregnated</b> skeletal calcites contain more Mg and usually less Sr than corresponding nonasphalt-impregnated specimens. Data obtained on the Mg and Sr concentrations of the best preserved specimens indicate the following. The Sr/Ca ratio for the coiled nautiloid Metacoceras cornutum is similar to that for the modern-day Nautilus sp. The Mg contents in the calcites of the foraminifera, bivalve, and ostracodes are similar to those in related Recent forms. The shell walls of the extinct orthocone nautiloids have lower Sr contents relative to the cameral deposits. These large differences are apparently due to the "vital effect" of the organism. ...|$|E
