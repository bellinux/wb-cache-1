The limit process just described can be performed for any point in the domain of the squaring function. This defines the derivative function of the squaring function, or just the derivative of the squaring function for short. A computation similar to the one above shows that the derivative of the squaring function is the doubling function.|$|E

25|$|Removal of copyrighted {{content from}} the entire Usenet network is a nearly {{impossible}} task, due to the rapid propagation between servers and the retention done by each server.

25|$|One might further {{hypothesize that}} the {{experimental}} treatment regulates cholesterol, because the treatment seems to selectively regulate genes associated with cholesterol. While {{this may be}} true, {{there are a number}} of reasons why making this a firm conclusion based on enrichment alone represents an unwarranted leap of faith. One previously mentioned issue has to do with the observation that gene regulation may have no direct impact on protein regulation: even if the proteins coded for by these genes do nothing other than make cholesterol, showing that their mRNA is altered does not directly tell us what is happening at the protein level. It is quite possible that the amount of these cholesterol-related proteins remains constant under the experimental conditions. Second, even if protein levels do change, perhaps there is always enough of them around to make cholesterol <b>as</b> <b>fast</b> <b>as</b> <b>it</b> can be possibly made, that is, another protein, not on our list, is the rate determining step in the process of making cholesterol. Finally, proteins typically play many roles, so these genes may be regulated not because of their shared association with making cholesterol but because of a shared role in a completely independent process.|$|E

2500|$|Most {{types of}} {{reactors}} {{are sensitive to}} a process variously known as xenon poisoning, or the iodine pit. The common fission product Xenon-135 produced in the fission process acts as a neutron poison that absorbs neutrons and therefore tends to shut the reactor down. Xenon-135 accumulation can be controlled by keeping power levels high enough to destroy it by neutron absorption <b>as</b> <b>fast</b> <b>as</b> <b>it</b> is produced. Fission also produces iodine-135, which in turn decays (with a half-life of 6.57 hours) to new xenon-135. When the reactor is shut down, iodine-135 continues to decay to xenon-135, making restarting the reactor more difficult {{for a day or}} two, as the xenon-135 decays into cesium-135, which is not nearly as poisonous as xenon-135, with a half-life of 9.2 hours. This temporary state is the [...] "iodine pit." [...] If the reactor has sufficient extra reactivity capacity, it can be restarted. As the extra xenon-135 is transmuted to xenon-136, which is much less a neutron poison, within a few hours the reactor experiences a [...] "xenon burnoff (power) transient". Control rods must be further inserted to replace the neutron absorption of the lost xenon-135. Failure to properly follow such a procedure was a key step in the Chernobyl disaster.|$|E
2500|$|Mortaza {{continued}} to struggle for {{form in the}} 2010 Asia Cup, held in June, taking just two wickets in three matches {{at an average of}} 77.00. The coach, Jamie Siddons, commented that [...] "He's going to have to improve a lot on his current form. Unfortunately there's no ready replacement for Mashrafe at the moment, we're hoping his experience will pull him through. We'll keep looking for others and if Mash can't stand up we'll have to replace him." [...] Siddons also noted that since his comeback in 2010, Mortaza's bowling has not been <b>as</b> <b>fast</b> <b>as</b> <b>it</b> used to be. In the one-day leg of the return tour in England in July 2010, Mortaza regain the captaincy of the ODI side. He took over from Shakib Al Hasan who had stepped down after a dip in form. In the second ODI Bangladesh ended their 24-match losing streak; Mortaza led his country to their first victory over England in any form of cricket. However, Bangladesh were unable to seal a series victory and lost 2–1. Mortaza finished as joint-lead wicket-taker for the series with five wickets, equal with England's Ajmal Shahzad. Later the same month, Bangladesh played two ODIs against Ireland, and one against the Netherlands; the team managed only one victory against Ireland. Analysing Bangladesh's performance on the tour, Mortaza noted his concern about the effectiveness of the team's bowling.|$|E
