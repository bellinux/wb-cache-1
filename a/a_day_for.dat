5|$|Ganymede is the Solar System's largest {{moon and}} the Solar System's only known moon with a magnetosphere, {{but this does not}} shield it from cosmic {{radiation}} to a noteworthy degree, because it is overshadowed by Jupiter's magnetic field. Ganymede receives about 0.08Sv (8rem) of radiation per day. Callisto is farther from Jupiter's strong radiation belt and subject to only 0.0001Sv (0.01rem) <b>a</b> <b>day.</b> <b>For</b> comparison, the average amount of radiation taken on Earth by a living organism is about 0.0024Sv per year; the highest natural radiation levels on Earth are recorded around Ramsar hot springs at about 0.26Sv per year.|$|E
5|$|In 1996, the FDA {{approved}} a sustained-release formulation of bupropion called Wellbutrin SR, {{intended to be}} taken twice a day (as compared with three times <b>a</b> <b>day</b> <b>for</b> immediate-release Wellbutrin). In 2003, the FDA {{approved a}}nother sustained-release formulation called Wellbutrin XL, intended for once-daily dosing. Wellbutrin SR and XL are available in generic form in the United States and Canada. In Canada, generic XR bupropion is distributed by Mylan. In 1997, bupropion {{was approved by the}} FDA for use as a smoking cessation aid under the name Zyban. In 2006, Wellbutrin XL was similarly approved as a treatment for seasonal affective disorder.|$|E
5|$|In general, for adults, doses {{are taken}} four times <b>a</b> <b>day</b> <b>for</b> fever or arthritis, with doses near the maximal daily dose used {{historically}} {{for the treatment}} of rheumatic fever.

5|$|Poohsticks {{was invented}} by English author A. A. Milne for his son Christopher Robin Milne. The sport first came to {{prominence}} when it was described in the author's book The House at Pooh Corner {{as well as in}} the Disney animated featurette Winnie the Pooh and <b>a</b> <b>Day</b> <b>for</b> Eeyore. Winnie-the-Pooh, the protagonist of the book, accidentally drops a pine cone into a river from a bridge and, after observing how it appeared on the other side of the bridge, devises the rules for Poohsticks. Pooh continues to play the sport with the other characters, Christopher Robin, Tigger and Eeyore.|$|E
5|$|Puccini saw Sardou's {{play when}} it was touring Italy in 1889 and, after some vacillation, {{obtained}} the rights to turn the work into an opera in 1895. Turning the wordy French play into a succinct Italian opera took four years, during which the composer repeatedly argued with his librettists and publisher. Tosca premiered {{at a time of}} unrest in Rome, and its first performance was delayed for <b>a</b> <b>day</b> <b>for</b> fear of disturbances. Despite indifferent reviews from the critics, the opera was an immediate success with the public.|$|E

5|$|Ross was {{the first}} {{governor}} to set aside <b>a</b> <b>day</b> <b>for</b> civic improvements, declaring the third Friday in January to be Arbor Day, when schoolchildren should endeavor to plant trees. He also supported the legislature's efforts to purchase the Huddle portrait gallery, a collection of paintings of each governor of Texas. These paintings continue to hang in the rotunda of the Texas State Capitol.|$|E
5|$|The {{governor}} received {{money from}} the Crown to support the prisoners, with the amount varying on rank: the governor received 19 livres <b>a</b> <b>day</b> <b>for</b> each political prisoner – with conseiller-grade nobles receiving 15 livres – and, {{at the other end}} of the scale, three livres <b>a</b> <b>day</b> <b>for</b> each commoner. Even for the commoners, this sum was around twice the daily wage of a labourer and provided for an adequate diet, while the upper classes ate very well: even critics of the Bastille recounted many excellent meals, often taken with the governor himself. Prisoners who were being punished for misbehaviour, however, could have their diet restricted as a punishment. The medical treatment provided by the Bastille for prisoners was excellent by the standards of the 18th century; the prison also contained a number of inmates suffering from mental illnesses and took, by the standards of the day, a very progressive attitude to their care.|$|E

The text recommends boiling the water before use and using the water so in <b>a</b> <b>day.</b> <b>For</b> drinking, if boiling is not possible, the text recommends alternate purification method based on Triphala, and then adding a piece of mango, patala or champaka flower or powder of camphor for flavor and delight.

At the same time, the group was developing a varied and eclectic repertoire of calypso, folk, and foreign language songs, suggested by {{all three of the}} musicians though usually arranged by Guard with some harmonies created by Reynolds.|$|E
5|$|A free buffet for {{servicemen}} {{was provided}} {{at the station}} during both World Wars. The Preston Station Free Buffet Association served free hot drinks, biscuits and buns and sold sandwiches at cost price to anyone in uniform 24 hours <b>a</b> <b>day</b> <b>for</b> {{the duration of the}} First World War. Four hundred women working 12-hour shifts served over 3million men between 1915 and 1919. 12million cups of tea were served between 1939 and 1945. It was funded by subscription and had its own marked crockery. The station was on a major north-south route for troops. There are three commemorative plaques related to the First World War buffet in the waiting room on platforms 3 and 4, the former site of WWI buffet. One of the drama segments of the televised Preston Passion of 2012 was set in the First World War servicemen's buffet. The Second World War buffet was located in the southern building further down platforms 5&6 (now platforms 3&4).|$|E
5|$|After the {{manifesto}} was published, the FBI received over {{a thousand}} calls <b>a</b> <b>day</b> <b>for</b> months {{in response to the}} offer of a $1million reward for information leading to the identity of the Unabomber. Many letters claiming to be from the Unabomber were also sent to the UNABOM Task Force, and thousands of suspect leads were reviewed. While the FBI was occupied with new leads, David Kaczynski hired private investigator Susan Swanson in Chicago to investigate Ted's activities discreetly. The Kaczynski brothers had become estranged in 1990, and David had not seen Ted for ten years. David later hired Washington, D.C., attorney Tony Bisceglie to organize evidence acquired by Swanson, and make contact with the FBI, given the likely difficulty in attracting the FBI's attention. He wanted to protect his brother from the danger of an FBI raid, such as the Ruby Ridge or the Waco Siege, since he assumed Ted would not take kindly to being contacted by the FBI and would be likely to react violently.|$|E

5|$|As {{proposed}} in their election manifesto, in February 2003 Livingstone's administration introduced a congestion charge covering 8 square miles in central London, charging motorists £5 <b>a</b> <b>day</b> <b>for</b> {{driving through the}} area. It was introduced {{in an attempt to}} deter traffic and reduce congestion; Livingstone himself took the London Underground to work, and tried to inspire more Londoners to use public transport rather than cars. The policy was highly controversial, and strongly opposed by businesses, resident groups, the roads lobby, and the Labour government; many commentators recognised that if opposition resulted in the policy being abandoned then it could lead to the end of Livingstone's political career. That year, the Political Studies Association named Livingstone 'Politician of the Year' due to his implementation of the 'bold and imaginative' scheme. The scheme resulted in a marked reduction on traffic in central London, resulting in improved bus services, and by 2007, TfL could claim that the charge had reduced congestion by 20%. To further encourage the use of public transport, in June 2003, the Oyster card system was introduced, while bus and Underground journeys were made free for people aged 11 to 18.|$|E
5|$|Drinking {{more than}} one drink <b>a</b> <b>day</b> <b>for</b> women or two drinks for men {{increases}} the risk of heart disease, high blood pressure, atrial fibrillation, and stroke. Risk is greater in younger people due to binge drinking which may result in violence or accidents. About 3.3 million deaths (5.9% of all deaths) are believed to be due to alcohol each year. Alcoholism reduces a person's life expectancy by around ten years and alcohol use is the third leading cause of early death in the United States. No professional medical association recommends that people who are nondrinkers should start drinking wine. Long-term alcohol abuse can cause a number of physical symptoms, including cirrhosis of the liver, pancreatitis, epilepsy, polyneuropathy, alcoholic dementia, heart disease, nutritional deficiencies, peptic ulcers and sexual dysfunction, and can eventually be fatal. Other physical effects include an increased risk of developing cardiovascular disease, malabsorption, alcoholic liver disease, and cancer. Damage to the central nervous system and peripheral nervous system can occur from sustained alcohol consumption. A wide range of immunologic defects can result and there may be a generalized skeletal fragility, in addition to a recognized tendency to accidental injury, resulting a propensity to bone fractures.|$|E
5|$|Fred Phillips, the {{original}} designer of Spock's Vulcan ears, served as The Motion Pictures makeup artist. He {{and his staff}} were responsible for fifty masks and makeup for the aliens seen in the film. The designs were developed by Phillips himself or else off Fletcher's sketches. In his long association with Star Trek Phillips produced his 2000th Spock ear during production of The Motion Picture. Each ear was made of latex and other ingredients blended together in a kitchen mixer, then baked for six hours. Though Phillips had saved {{the original}} television series casts used for making the appliances, Nimoy's ears had grown in the decade since and new molds had to be fabricated. While {{on the small screen}} the ears could be used up to four times, since nicks and tears did not show up on television, Phillips had to create around three pairs <b>a</b> <b>day</b> <b>for</b> Nimoy during filming. The upswept Vulcan eyebrows needed to be applied hair by hair for proper detail, and it took Nimoy more than two hours to prepare for filming—twice as long as it had for television.|$|E
