50|$|Captured airfields {{could be}} {{restored}} {{for use as}} <b>advanced</b> <b>landing</b> <b>field</b> in one to three days depending upon the amount of drainage {{and the number of}} mines and booby traps encountered.|$|E
50|$|ALGs were {{equipped}} with an access road that {{was connected to the}} existing road infrastructure; a dump for supplies, ammunition, and gasoline drums, along with a drinkable water and a minimal electrical grid for communications and station lighting. Tents were used for billeting and also for support facilities. Time was the all-important factor and ALGs serve its purpose if available for only a few days. As the forward area became the rear area, an <b>advanced</b> <b>landing</b> <b>field</b> could be improved for medium bomber use, but initially they primarily served fighter and transport groups.|$|E
5000|$|On 5 July {{the group}} {{switched}} from Nieuports to SPAD XIIIs. The 94th switched over first, {{then by the}} middle of August the other three squadrons were also converted. Unfortunately, the American mechanics were unused to the V-8 engines of the Spads and so availability of the Spads suffered for the first few weeks after the changeover. On 9 July the group moved closer to the line at Saints Aerodrome. It is while stationed at Saints Aerodrome that Theodore Roosevelt's youngest son Quentin Roosevelt, flying with the 95th Aero Squadron, was shot down and killed on 14 July 1918. [...] With the front moving north and east, the Group was now between 50 and 70 km from the lines. An <b>advanced</b> <b>landing</b> <b>field</b> at Coincy Aerodrome was established on 5 August for refueling and a detachment was established there from which alerts were dispatched.|$|E
50|$|Opened in 1943, Headcorn was a {{prototype}} for the temporary <b>Advanced</b> <b>Landing</b> Ground airfields {{to be built}} in France after D-Day, when the need for <b>advanced</b> <b>landing</b> <b>fields</b> became urgent as the Allied forces moved east across France and Germany. It was used by the Royal Air Force and the United States Army Air Forces. It was closed in September 1944.|$|R
50|$|Dry-weather <b>advanced</b> <b>landing</b> <b>fields</b> were {{constructed}} {{by a single}} battalion at a favorable site in flat terrain in from one to three days, including time for reconnaissance. At less favorable sites, where more clearing and grading were required, or all-weather fields which also needed additional infrastructure, the time varied from three to ten days.|$|R
50|$|Opened in 1943 {{during the}} Second World War, RAF Lashenden became a {{prototype}} for the temporary <b>Advanced</b> <b>Landing</b> Ground airfields that {{were built in}} France after D-Day, when the need for <b>advanced</b> <b>landing</b> <b>fields</b> became urgent as the Allied forces moved east across France and Germany.

50|$|Opened in March 1944, Bisterne was a {{prototype}} {{for the type}} of temporary <b>Advanced</b> <b>Landing</b> Ground type airfield that would be built in France after D-Day, when the need <b>advanced</b> <b>landing</b> <b>fields</b> would become urgent as the Allied forces moved east across France and Germany. It was used by the United States Army Air Force as a fighter airfield. It was closed late in the summer of 1944.|$|R
50|$|Opened in 1944, Lymington was a {{prototype}} {{for the type}} of temporary <b>Advanced</b> <b>Landing</b> Ground type airfield which would be built in France after D-Day, when the need for <b>advanced</b> <b>landing</b> <b>fields</b> would become urgent as the Allied forces moved east across France and Germany. It was used by the Royal Air Force, Canadian and the United States Army Air Forces. It was closed in 1946 after two years of being utilized as a storage area for the Royal Navy.|$|R
2500|$|The group {{departed}} for the European {{theater in the}} middle of March 1944, leaving its Mustangs behind and arriving at its first overseas station, RAF Lymington, in early April 1944 with only Thunderbolts. [...] At Lymington the group became part of IX Air Support Command and its squadrons were assigned fuselage codes T5 (10th), 2N (81st) and W3 (313th). [...] Lymington was a temporary airfield and a prototype for the type of temporary <b>advanced</b> <b>landing</b> grounds which would be built in France after D-Day, when the need for <b>advanced</b> <b>landing</b> <b>fields</b> would become urgent as the Allied forces moved east across France and Germany. [...] Tents were used for billeting and also for support facilities; an access road was built to the existing road infrastructure; a dump for supplies, ammunition, and gasoline drums, along with a drinkable water and minimal electrical grid for communications and station lighting.|$|R
