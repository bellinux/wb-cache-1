5|$|On August 19, Alberto Matxain Beraza {{was arrested}} in the French town of Le Corbier in Savoy, next to the French Alps. He was held along with fellow ETA members Aitzol Etxaburu and Andoni Sarasola. They were {{responsible}} for ETA’s logistics operation, and had the job of supplying weapons and explosives to the ETA cells operating in Spanish soil. The arrest led {{to the discovery of}} almost <b>a</b> <b>tone</b> <b>of</b> explosives, hidden by ETA in 12 small caches around France. On October 11, Joanes Larretxea {{was arrested in}} Rivières, Gard along with top ETA member Iurgi Mendinueta Mintegi.|$|E

5|$|The Sermons of Swift {{have none}} of that thunder which appals, or that resistless and winning {{softness}} which melts, the hearts of an audience. He can never have enjoyed the triumph of uniting hundreds in one ardent sentiment of love, of terror, or of devotion. His reasoning, however powerful, and indeed unanswerable, convinces the understanding, but is never addressed to the heart; and, indeed, from his instructions to a young clergyman, he seems hardly to have considered pathos as a legitimate ingredient in an English sermon. Occasionally, too, Swift's misanthropic habits break out even from the pulpit; nor is he altogether able to suppress his disdain of those fellow mortals, on whose behalf was accomplished the great work of redemption. With such unamiable feelings towards his hearers, the preacher might indeed command their respect, but could never excite their sympathy. It may be feared that his Sermons were less popular from another cause, imputable more to the congregation than to the pastor. Swift spared not the vice of rich or poor; and, disdaining to amuse the imaginations of his audience with discussion of dark points of divinity, or warm them by a flow of sentimental devotion, he rushes at once {{to the point of}} moral depravity, and upbraids them with their favourite and predominant vices in <b>a</b> <b>tone</b> <b>of</b> stern reproof, bordering upon reproach. In short, he tears the bandages from their wounds, like the hasty surgeon of a crowded hospital, and applies the incision knife and caustic with salutary, but rough and untamed severity. But, alas! the mind must be already victorious over the worst of its evil propensities, that can profit by this harsh medicine. There is a principle of opposition in our nature, which mans itself with obstinacy even against avowed truth, when it approaches our feelings in a harsh and insulting manner. And Swift was probably sensible, that his discourses, owing to these various causes, did not produce the powerful effects most grateful to the feelings of the preacher, because they reflect back to him those of the audience.|$|E
25|$|At this stage, {{his work}} was {{considered}} {{to be part of the}} Ibero-American's post-vanguardists Second World War authors according to several scholars. Being under the vanguardist influence, his poetry developed <b>a</b> <b>tone</b> <b>of</b> despair with a very obvious revolutionary intent.|$|E
25|$|Anna Maria Lenngren debuted as {{a writer}} of poems for {{funerals}} and weddings, and her earliest work has <b>a</b> <b>tone</b> <b>of</b> the ecstatic passion common in the religious circles of her father.

25|$|The above {{descriptions}} are {{by necessity}} simplified. Many Congolese are multilingual, {{and the language}} used depends on the context. For instance, a government official might use French to set <b>a</b> <b>tone</b> <b>of</b> formality and authority with another official, use Lingala when buying goods at a market, and the local language when in his home village. English is also spoken, especially in the east where eastern and southern African influences have spread in the post-Mobutu era. Among the slangs spoken in Congo, Indubil has been noted since around the 1960s, and continues to evolve nowadays.|$|E
25|$|To {{the public}} {{ordinances}} {{of the church}} he scrupulously conformed. But, unfortunately, there were many things both in the teaching {{and the practice of}} the ecclesiastics of that day, which were calculated to repel men of sober judgment and high principle. These evil tendencies in the popular presentation of Christianity undoubtedly begot in Shaftesbury's mind a certain amount of repugnance and contempt to some of the doctrines of Christianity itself; and, cultivating, almost of set purpose, his sense of the ridiculous, he was too apt to assume towards such doctrines and their teachers <b>a</b> <b>tone</b> <b>of</b> raillery.|$|E

This building unifies the formerly separate lab spaces of the physics, chemistry, and biology departments. In addition, it houses Schow Science Library, notable for its unified science materials holdings and architecture. It features vaulted ceilings and an atrium with windows into laboratories on the second through fourth floors of the science center.|$|E

25|$|On several {{occasions}} the poet assumes <b>a</b> <b>tone</b> <b>of</b> lamentation, {{as at the}} end of Canto I, in parts of the speech of the Old Man of the Restelo, the end of Canto V, {{the beginning and end of}} Canto VII, and the final strophes of the poem. Many times, da Gama bursts into oration at challenging moments: in Mombasa (Canto II), on the appearance of Adamastor, and in the middle of the terror of the storm. The poet's invocations to the Tágides and nymphs of Mondego (Cantos I and VII) and to Calliope (beginning of Cantos III and X), in typological terms, are also orations. Each one of these types of speech shows stylistic peculiarities.|$|E
25|$|The second Klan {{embraced the}} burning Latin cross as a {{dramatic}} display of symbolism, with <b>a</b> <b>tone</b> <b>of</b> intimidation. No crosses {{had been used}} as a symbol by the first Klan, but it became a symbol of the Klan's quasi-Christian message. Its lighting during meetings was often accompanied by prayer, the singing of hymns, and other overtly religious symbolism. In his novel The Clansman, Thomas Dixon Jr. borrows the idea that the first Klan had used fiery crosses from 'the call to arms' of the Scottish Clans, and film director D.W. Griffith used this image in The Birth of a Nation; Simmons adopted the symbol wholesale from the movie, and the symbol and action have been associated with the Klan ever since.|$|E
500|$|The type {{of letters}} written with <b>a</b> <b>tone</b> <b>of</b> incensed moral outrage have become {{commonly}} described as [...] "Disgusted of Tunbridge Wells" [...] letters, {{even though the}} writer may not be from Royal Tunbridge Wells. For example, actor Michael Caine once said: [...] "I don't want to sound like Disgusted of Tunbridge Wells, but I do {{think there should be}} some sort of national service for young men". People writing them have been claimed by commentators to be readers of the Daily Mail, despite the original letters not originating in that publication.|$|E

500|$|The phrase [...] "Disgusted of Tunbridge Wells" [...] is {{a generic}} name {{used in the}} United Kingdom for a person, usually with {{strongly}} conservative political views, who writes letters to newspapers or the BBC in <b>a</b> <b>tone</b> <b>of</b> moral outrage. [...] "Disgusted" [...] is the pseudonym of the supposed letter writer, who is {{a resident of the}} stereotypically middle-class town of Royal Tunbridge Wells, Kent, in the south-east of England. The term may have originated either with the 1944 BBC radio programme Much-Binding-in-the-Marsh, a regular writer to The Times or with an editor of the letters page of a local newspaper, the Tunbridge Wells Advertiser.|$|E
500|$|There is {{a famous}} legend {{inspired}} by Euler's arguments with secular philosophers over religion, {{which is set}} during Euler's second stint at the St. Petersburg Academy. The French philosopher Denis Diderot was visiting Russia on Catherine the Great's invitation. However, the Empress was alarmed that the philosopher's arguments for atheism were influencing members of her court, and so Euler was asked to confront the Frenchman. Diderot was informed that a learned mathematician had produced a proof {{of the existence of}} God: he agreed to view the proof as it was presented in court. Euler appeared, advanced toward Diderot, and in <b>a</b> <b>tone</b> <b>of</b> perfect conviction announced this non-sequitur: [...] "Sir, =x, hence God exists—reply!" ...|$|E
500|$|The major {{breakthrough}} in the band's career came in their collaboration with producer [...] "Mutt" [...] Lange on the album [...] Highway to Hell, released in 1979. Eddie Van Halen notes this to be his favourite AC/DC record, along with Powerage. It became the first AC/DC LP {{to break into the}} US top 100, eventually reaching No.17, and it propelled AC/DC into the top ranks of hard rock acts. Highway to Hell had lyrics that shifted away from flippant and comical toward more central rock themes, putting increased emphasis on backing vocals but still featured AC/DC's signature sound: loud, simple, pounding riffs and grooving backbeats. The final track, [...] "Night Prowler", has two breaths in quick succession {{at the start of the}} song, intended to create <b>a</b> <b>tone</b> <b>of</b> fear and loathing.|$|E

500|$|A side {{benefit of}} Tchaikovsky's {{friendship}} with Glazunov, Lyadov and Rimsky-Korsakov was an increased {{confidence in his}} own abilities as a composer, along with a willingness to let his musical works stand alongside those of his contemporaries. Tchaikovsky wrote to von Meck in January 1889, after being once again well represented in Belyayev's concerts, that he had [...] "always tried to place myself outside all parties and to show in every way possible that I love and respect every honorable and gifted public figure in music, whatever his tendency", and that he considered himself [...] "flattered {{to appear on the}} concert platform" [...] beside composers in the Belyayev circle. This was an acknowledgment of wholehearted readiness for his music to be heard with that of these composers, delivered in <b>a</b> <b>tone</b> <b>of</b> implicit confidence that there were no comparisons from which to fear.|$|E
500|$|Although {{strongly}} {{urged by}} Moderates {{to sign the}} Civil Rights Bill, Johnson broke decisively with them by vetoing it on March 27. In his veto message, he objected to the measure because it conferred citizenship on the freedmen {{at a time when}} 11 out of 36 states were unrepresented in the Congress, and that it discriminated in favor of African Americans and against whites. Within three weeks, Congress had overridden his veto, the first time that had been done on a major bill in American history. The veto of the Civil Rights Act of 1866, often seen as a key mistake of Johnson's presidency, convinced Moderates there was no hope of working with him. Historian Eric Foner in his volume on Reconstruction views it as [...] "the most disastrous miscalculation of his political career". According to Stewart, the veto was [...] "for many his defining blunder, setting <b>a</b> <b>tone</b> <b>of</b> perpetual confrontation with Congress that prevailed {{for the rest of his}} presidency".|$|E
500|$|In the 2017 History of Digital Games, author Andrew Williams {{claims that}} Vorticons [...] "signaled a new {{direction}} for computer games in general", as well as setting <b>a</b> <b>tone</b> <b>of</b> gameplay mechanics for future id games, by introducing a sense of [...] "effortless movement" [...] as players explored through large open spaces instead of disconnected screens like prior platforming computer games. In the summer of 1991, id hosted a seminar for game developers {{with the intention of}} licensing the Commander Keen engine; they did so, forming the spiritual predecessor to both QuakeCon and id's standard of licensing their game engines. Id Software also produced several more games in the Commander Keen series; the first of these, Commander Keen in Keen Dreams, was published in 1991 through their agreement with Softdisk. Commander Keen in Goodbye, Galaxy, composed of the episodes [...] "Secret of the Oracle" [...] and [...] "The Armageddon Machine", was published through Apogee in December 1991, and the final id-developed Keen game, Commander Keen in Aliens Ate My Babysitter, was published through FormGen around the same time. Another trilogy of episodes, titled The Universe Is Toast!, was planned for December 1992, but was cancelled after the success of id's Wolfenstein 3D and development focus on Doom. A final Keen game, Commander Keen, was developed for the Game Boy Color in 2001 by David A. Palmer Productions in association with id Software, and published by Activision.|$|E
