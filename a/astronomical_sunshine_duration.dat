The long-term tendencies of <b>sunshine</b> <b>duration</b> were analyzed by means of linear regression method and sequential version of the non-parametric Mann-Kendall test. All months excluding March, June and September are distinguished by a growing tendency of actual and relative <b>sunshine</b> <b>duration.</b> The number of sunny hours increases in spring, summer and winter, and decreases in autumn. An increase of annual <b>sunshine</b> <b>duration</b> totals (3. 5 h/year) within the 50 -year period was stated. Transformation of the annual course of <b>sunshine</b> <b>duration</b> within 50 -year period was detected. The annual maximum of <b>sunshine</b> <b>duration</b> during the first 25 -year period occurred in June and September. The second 25 -year period was characterized by increase of the number of sunny hour in May and August and by decrease of <b>sunshine</b> <b>duration</b> in June and September. The time of registration of <b>sunshine</b> <b>duration</b> extended in the morning hours and before the Sun set as a consequences of low cloudiness negative trend.

Only very sunny days were distinguished by a positive annual totals trend, on average 4 days per 10 years. The tendencies of <b>sunshine</b> <b>duration</b> recorded in Łódź within fifty last years are representative for Poland and result from the macroscale factor (atmospheric circulation) not only from the influences of local (anthropogenic) conditions.

We investigated this issue using long-term <b>sunshine</b> <b>duration</b> records from China, which experienced a rapid increase in urbanization during the past decades. Over the period 1960 – 2013, 172 pairs of urban and nearby rural stations were analyzed. Urban and rural <b>sunshine</b> <b>duration</b> trends show similar spatial patterns during a dimming phase (1960 – 1989) and a subsequent period during which trends were leveling off (1990 – 2013).

The areas with the lowest <b>sunshine</b> <b>duration</b> annually lie mostly over the polar oceans, as well as parts of northern Europe, southern Alaska, northern Russia, and areas near the Sea of Okhotsk. The cloudiest place in the United States is Cold Bay, Alaska, {{with an average of}} 304 days of heavy overcast (covering over 3/4 of the sky). In addition to these polar oceanic climates, certain low-latitude basins enclosed by mountains, like the Sichuan and Taipei Basins, can have <b>sunshine</b> <b>duration</b> as low as 1,000 hours per year, as cool air consistently sinks to form fogs that winds cannot dissipate. Tórshavn in the Faroe Islands is among the cloudiest places in the world with yearly only 840 sunshine hours.|$|R
