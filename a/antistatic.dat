5|$|Polonium was {{discovered}} in 1898 by Marie and Pierre Curie, when it was extracted from uranium ore and identified solely by its strong radioactivity: {{it was the first}} element to be so discovered. Polonium was named after Marie Curie's homeland of Poland. Polonium has few applications, and those are related to its radioactivity: heaters in space probes, <b>antistatic</b> devices, and sources of neutrons and alpha particles. Polonium's intense radioactivity makes it dangerously toxic.|$|E

Here, we discuss investigations on thermal electric performances of the polypyrrole coated PET {{in a wide range}} of temperatures above room temperature. The Seebeck coefficient turns out to be comparable with that of metal thermocouple materials. Since polypyrrole shows extremely low thermal diffusivities regardless of the electrical conductivity, the low thermal conductivity gives significant advantage to the thermoelectric figure-of-merit ZT, comparable with that of some traditional inorganic thermoelectric materials. The heat generation is also investigated for possible heating textile devices. Comment: 12 pages and 9 figure...|$|R

The five antiseptics applied were methylnaphthoquinon, dehydroacetic acid sodium salt, nitrofrazon, oxymethylisopropylbenzen and sorbic acid. The results obtained were as follows:- 1. The period of preservation in the sausage treated by antiseptics varied according to circumstances of temperature and moisture, {{and according to}} the type and quantity of the antiseptics used. In the thermostat of 28 °C. temperature and 85 % humidity, the period of preservation was prolonged by 4 or 6 days. 2. Dehydroacetic acid sodium salt and nitrofrazon were thought to be suitable antiseptics for sausage, sorbic acid being the next. 3.

40|$|A {{family of}} {{hydrophilic}} and flexible epoxy polymers was prepared from {{the reaction of}} poly(oxyalkylene) amines and diglycidyl ether of bisphenol-A (DGEBA) at 1 : 1 molar ratio of N-H to epoxide. The use of a high molecular weight (M-W = 1000 - 6000) poly(oxyethylene-oxypropylene) amine and a low M-W amine as curing agents provided epoxy materials with good properties in toughness and hydrophilicity. The hydrophilicity, probed by surface resistivity of these cured materials, {{was found to be}} affected by the nature and weight content of poly(oxyethylene) segment in the polymer backbone, and also by the degree of crystallinity. Specifically, {{in the presence of a}} water-soluble poly(oxyethylene-oxypropylene) diamine of M-W 2000 the cured epoxies can reach surface resistivity as low as 10 (8. 6 - 9. 6) Omega/square. In comparison, the water-insoluble poly(oxypropylene) diamine of M-W 2000 afforded a higher surface resistivity of 10 (10. 5) Omega/square because of the difference in hydrophilicity between oxyethylene and oxypropylene functionalities. Poly(oxypropylene) diamine of M-W 230 as the sole curing agent generated an epoxy with even higher surface resistivity of 10 (13) Omega/square due to a highly crosslinking structure. With proper selection of mixed poly(oxyethylene-oxypropylene) diamine (25 wt%) and 2 -aminoethanol (9 wt%), the DGEBA cured polymer had an appropriate surface resistivity of 10 (9. 8) Omega/square for <b>antistatics.</b> Moreover, this material was extremely ductile in appearance and showed over 500 % elongation at break during mechanical tests. The high flexibility is rationalized by the balanced chemical structure of poly(oxyalkylene) segments and bisphenol-A distributed in a slightly crosslinked system.

2500|$|Many {{assembled}} PCBs are static sensitive, {{and therefore}} {{must be placed}} in <b>antistatic</b> bags during transport. When handling these boards, the user must be grounded (earthed). [...] Improper handling techniques might transmit an accumulated static charge through the board, damaging or destroying components. Even bare boards are sometimes static sensitive. Traces have become so fine that it's quite possible to blow an etch off the board (or change its characteristics) with a static charge. This is especially true on non-traditional PCBs such as MCMs and microwave PCBs.|$|E

2500|$|Many {{prominent}} {{innovations in}} the packaging industry were developed first for military use.

As a prominent concept in the military, mil spec packaging officially came into being around 1941, due to operations in Iceland experiencing critical losses, ultimately attributed to bad packaging. In most cases, mil spec packaging solutions (such as barrier materials, field rations, <b>antistatic</b> bags, and various shipping crates) are similar to commercial grade packaging materials, but subject to more stringent performance and quality requirements.|$|E
2500|$|Polyaniline and {{the other}} {{conducting}} polymers such as polythiophene, polypyrrole, and [...] have potential for applications due to their lightweight, conductivity, mechanical flexibility and low cost. [...] Polyaniline is especially attractive because it is relatively inexpensive, has three distinct oxidation states with different colors and has an acid/base doping response. This latter property makes polyaniline an attractive for acid/base chemical vapor sensors, supercapacitors and biosensors. [...] The different colors, charges and conformations of the multiple oxidation states also make the material promising for applications such as actuators, supercapacitors and electrochromics. [...] Although polyaniline has been historically considered as a battery material, its intrinsic pseudocapacitive behavior has shifted the energy storage potential to supercapacitors. Polyaniline is, in fact, the most common conductive polymer for the fabrication of supercapacitors. An interesting feature of polyaniline, {{as well as other}} conducting polymers, is the versatility in manufacturing electrically conducting yarns, <b>antistatic</b> coatings, electromagnetic shielding, and flexible electrodes.|$|E
