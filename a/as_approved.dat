5|$|As of December 2007, the TTB lists both Zinfandel and Primitivo <b>as</b> <b>approved</b> grape {{varieties}} for American wines, {{but they}} are not listed as synonyms. U.S. producers, therefore, must label a wine according to whether it is Zinfandel or Primitivo. The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) proposed in 2002 that they be recognised as synonyms, but no decision on this proposal (RIN 1513–AA32, formerly RIN 1512-AC65) has been made.|$|E

5|$|In the {{original}} plan for the U.S. Highway System, <b>as</b> <b>approved</b> by the Bureau of Public Roads in November 1926, US7 was defined as beginning in New York City and designated on the alignment of NY22 to Amenia, where it shifted northeast into Sharon, Connecticut to use old New England Route4 through Massachusetts and Vermont {{all the way to}} the Canadian border. Apparently New York State did not approve this plan, and by mid-1927 the official route log published by AASHO (now known as AASHTO) had been amended so that the southern end of US7 began in Norwalk, Connecticut instead.|$|E
5|$|A {{group of}} area {{residents}} initiated {{an effort to}} have the former West Michigan Pike designated {{what is now called}} a Pure Michigan Byway. The designation would prioritize the area for historic preservation grants. A Preserve America grant funded a survey from June 2007 through September 2010, the results of which were a set of reports through the Michigan State Historic Preservation Office on the historical nature of the West Michigan Pike. In 2011, the group {{was in the process of}} securing resolutions from municipalities along the highway in support of the designation. According to officials working on the byway, it can take up to seven years to complete the process. The initial proposals had the byway continuing to Mackinaw City, but <b>as</b> <b>approved</b> in 2016, it runs from New Buffalo on I-94 to Ludington, following US31 except between business loops at South Haven, Muskegon, Whitehall–Montague and Pentwater.|$|E
