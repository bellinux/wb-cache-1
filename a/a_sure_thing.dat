25|$|The {{movement}} {{took off}} when wealthy U.S. Representative Darrell Issa, a Republican representing San Diego, California, announced on May 6 {{that he would}} use his personal money to push the effort. All told, he contributed $1.7 {{million of his own}} money to finance advertisements and professional signature-gatherers. With the movement accelerated, the recall effort began to make national news and soon appeared to be almost <b>a</b> <b>sure</b> <b>thing.</b> The only question was whether signatures would be collected quickly enough to force the special election to take place in late 2003 rather than in March 2004.|$|E

500|$|After {{the end of}} the war, Tipton {{returned}} to baseball. He spent the 1946 season with the Harrisburg Senators, and had a [...]327 batting average in 104 games. In 1947, he was promoted to the Wilkes-Barre Barons of the Eastern League. That season, he had a [...]375 batting average, which led the league. The following season, Tipton joined the Cleveland Indians for spring training. By the end of March, he was considered <b>a</b> <b>sure</b> <b>thing</b> to make the major league roster.|$|E

500|$|By {{crossing}} the lush Wyoming and Salt River Ranges instead of circling via the deserts to the south, the route provided ample wood, grass and {{water for the}} travelers, and cut nearly 7 days off the total travel time for wagon trains going to Fort Hall. Despite the better conditions for livestock, the mountainous terrain and unpredictable weather made passage sometimes difficult and required continuing federally funded maintenance on the mountainous road—not <b>a</b> <b>sure</b> <b>thing</b> just before, {{during and after the}} American Civil War. Funds were appropriated in 1858 and 115 men (hired in Utah) completed the road in Wyoming and Idaho in 90 days, clearing timber and moving about [...] of earth. The Lander's road or cutoff opened in 1859 when it was extensively used. Records after 1859 are lacking and its use after that period are assumed to sharply decrease since the Sublette Cutoff, the Central Overland Route and other cutoffs were just about as fast or faster and were much less strenuous. Today the Lander cutoff road(s) are roughly followed by a series of county and Forest Service roads.|$|E
500|$|Critical {{reception}} towards [...] "God Help the Outcasts" [...] {{has been}} generally positive, with some critics dubbing the song the film's [...] "most memorable" [...] and [...] "best number." [...] Janet Maslin of The New York Times wrote very positively of [...] "God Help the Outcasts", saying, [...] "The score ... soars to sanctimonious heights with the lilting, catchy power ballad 'God Help the Outcasts'." [...] Maslin continued, [...] " [...] <b>a</b> <b>sure</b> <b>thing</b> for next year's Oscar show." [...] Deeming [...] "God Help the Outcasts" [...] "the primary song" [...] of The Hunchback of Notre Dame, Filmtracks.com hailed it as [...] "A truly lovely and inspirational piece."

[...] Similarly praising Mollenhauer's delivery, Animation World Network wrote that the singer's [...] "voice timbre blends seamlessly with Demi Moore's speaking voice."

500|$|The {{following}} {{season was}} a low point for the Rockets during Olajuwon's tenure. They finished 42–40, and missed {{the playoffs for the}} first time in Olajuwon's career. He missed two weeks early in the season due to an accelerated heart beat. Despite his usual strong numbers, he could not lift his team out of mediocrity. Since making the Finals in 1986, the Rockets had made the playoffs five times, but their record in those playoff series was 1–5 and they were eliminated in the first round four times. Following the season, Olajuwon requested a trade in part because of his bad contract; his salary was considerably low for a top center, and his contract specifically forbade re-negotiation. He also expressed displeasure with the organization's efforts to surround him with quality players. He felt the Rockets had cut corners at every turn, and were more concerned with the bottom line than winning. Management had also infuriated Olajuwon during the season when they accused of him of faking a hamstring injury because of his unhappiness over his contract situation. His agent cited his differences with the organization as being [...] "irreconcilable", and Olajuwon publicly insulted owner Charlie Thomas and the team's front office. With the 1992–93 season approaching, a reporter for the Houston Chronicle said that Olajuwon being dealt was [...] "as close to <b>a</b> <b>sure</b> <b>thing</b> as there is." ...|$|E

2500|$|The recall {{movement}} began slowly, largely {{relying on}} talk radio, a website, cooperative e-mail, word-of-mouth, and grassroots campaigning {{to drive the}} signature gathering. Davis derided the effort as [...] "partisan mischief" [...] by [...] "a handful of right-wing politicians" [...] and called the proponents losers. Nevertheless, by mid-May recall proponents said they had gathered 300,000 signatures. They sought to gather the necessary signatures by July {{in order to get}} the special election in the fall of 2003 instead of March 2004 during the Democratic presidential primary election, when Democratic Party turnout would presumably be higher. The effort continued to gather signatures, but the recall was far from <b>a</b> <b>sure</b> <b>thing</b> and the proponents were short on cash to promote their cause.|$|E
2500|$|Sam Kellerman was 29 years old. In {{speaking}} about his brother, Max Kellerman recalls that [...] " [...] was a creative genius... He {{was the best}} writer for his age I've ever read. I used to tell him, 'I'll {{always be able to}} get someone to pay me for talking, and you'll always be able to get someone to pay you for writing.' When it came to writing, I felt like Salieri to Sam's Mozart. Sam wanted to direct film, but I think he was fated to write and be in front of the camera. He was starting to get work as an actor. He was in several national commercials. And acting wasn't even what he did best. Sam was <b>a</b> <b>sure</b> <b>thing.</b> It {{was just a matter of}} time before he made it big." ...|$|E
2500|$|Originally, {{martingale}} {{referred to}} a class of betting strategies that was popular in 18th-century France. [...] The simplest of these strategies was designed for {{a game in which}} the gambler wins his stake if a coin comes up heads and loses it if the coin comes up tails. [...] The strategy had the gambler double his bet after every loss so that the first win would recover all previous losses plus win a profit equal to the original stake. [...] As the gambler's wealth and available time jointly approach infinity, his probability of eventually flipping heads approaches 1, which makes the martingale betting strategy seem like <b>a</b> <b>sure</b> <b>thing.</b> [...] However, the exponential growth of the bets eventually bankrupts its users, assuming the obvious and realistic finite bankrolls (one of the reasons casinos, though normatively enjoying a mathematical edge in the games offered to their patrons, impose betting limits). Stopped Brownian motion, which is a martingale process, can be used to model the trajectory of such games.|$|E

I was a good deal surprised a few days later to receive the following letter from the company: ...|$|R

Answer, Friend, to the law, and to the testimony (sayeth the scriptures) for they testify of Christ. And if thou or any else, shall leave the scriptures, to follow the convictions of their own conscience; ye are not like to know Christ Jesus the Lord, for they may be defiled. And again, it is through the promises laid down in the scriptures, [...] "that we might be partakers of the divine nature" [...] (2Peter 1:4), and not by our following of the law, or conscience (Gal 3:1-4).|$|R
2500|$|George McClellan gave {{a series}} of private anatomy lectures before {{deciding}} to found a new medical school. Many unsuccessful requests had already been made for a new medical school in Philadelphia so he and others had the idea to couple it with Jefferson College in Canonsburg, Pennsylvania. With this in mind, he and others made a request to the Legislature of Pennsylvaniain 1824, and in 1825, received a charter for {{what was to become}} Jefferson Medical College. With the [...] "highly regarded" [...] University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine already being in Philadelphia, it was considered [...] "professional heresy" [...] to open a second school, but McClellan thought that opening a second medical school would just lead to more students going to Philadelphia to study medicine. Because of this, physicians at that time noted that he had to choose instructors [...] "greatly inferior in talent to himself" [...] and it was not <b>a</b> <b>sure</b> <b>thing</b> that the school would survive. The Jefferson Medical College opened in 1826, in Philadelphia, and in 1836 had an entering class of 360 medical students nonetheless and McClellan lectured in surgery. In 1838, Jefferson College separated from Jefferson Medical College, and all instructors, including McClellan, were vacated and the trustees hired all new individuals to teach. This change, unrelated to McClellan's leaving, led the school came to be considered a [...] "legitimate" [...] medical school.|$|E

[...] Here Mr. Wiles sighed. If the accident had happened on a mountain road, and the stage had been precipitated over the abyss, what valuable time would have been saved, and success become a surety. But Mr. Wiles's functions as an advocate did not include murder; at least, he was doubtful if {{it could be}} taxed as costs.|$|R

5000|$|Perfect Melancholy {{personality}} types are described by Littauer {{to be the}} mental types, with their personality displaying {{a strong emphasis on}} thinking, evaluation, and assessment. Their typical behaviour involves thinking, assessing, making lists, evaluating the positives and negatives, and general analysis of facts. They love maps, charts and graphs. They are usually the most intelligent of the four types, however they tend to dwell on details. A Melancholy is <b>a</b> planner, making <b>sure</b> <b>things</b> happen, although sometimes they can paralyze themselves with over-analysis. Lists and [...] "doing things the right way" [...] are characteristics of this personality type. Melancholies are also known as the [...] "Perfect" [...] type.

This made it the fourth most watched show on Animation Domination that night, beating The Cleveland Show, but losing to a second episode of The Cleveland Show, The Simpsons and Family Guy with 5.63 million. Rowan Kaiser of The A.V.

Giving the two younger, louder children a story of escalating dares is as close to <b>a</b> comedic <b>sure</b> <b>thing</b> as you can get, and “Dr. Yap” doesn’t disappoint. Each of the challenges is fun, from the initial “most disgusting drink” competition, to the kids stuffing snow down their pants {{for as long as they}} can. Having the kids be so reliably funny, both in how they’re written and acted, ensures that Bob’s Burgers can rely on having something good each episode while the producers tinker with other aspects of the show." ...|$|R
