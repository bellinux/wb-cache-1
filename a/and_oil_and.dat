5|$|Cockatoos {{maintain}} their plumage with frequent preening throughout the day. They remove dirt <b>and</b> <b>oil</b> <b>and</b> realign feather barbs by nibbling their feathers. They also preen other birds' feathers that are otherwise {{hard to get}} at. Cockatoos produce preen-oil from a gland on their lower back and apply it by wiping their plumage with their heads or already oiled feathers. Powder-down is produced by specialised feathers in the lumbar region and distributed by the preening cockatoo all over the plumage.|$|E
5|$|Emus are farmed {{primarily}} for their meat, leather, feathers <b>and</b> <b>oil,</b> <b>and</b> 95% of the carcass can be used. Emu meat is a low-fat product (less than 1.5% fat), and {{is comparable to}} other lean meats. Most of the usable portions (the best cuts come from the thigh and the larger muscles of the drum or lower leg) are, like other poultry, dark meat; emu meat is considered for cooking purposes by the US Food and Drug Administration to be a red meat because its red colour and pH value approximate that of beef, but for inspection purposes it {{is considered to be}} poultry.|$|E

The raid, codenamed Operation Claymore, proved to be a considerable success, resulting in the capture of a number of wheels of the German Enigma encoding machine which helped the Allies to decode German radio traffic later in the war, as well as the destruction of a considerable amount of petrol <b>and</b> <b>oil</b> <b>and</b> the capture of several hundred Germans.|$|E
5|$|Sawtooth National Forest {{balances}} {{interests of}} different groups, {{such as those}} interested in recreation, preservation, or resource extraction. The forest practices conservation of resources, in some areas allowing for production of raw materials, such as lumber for construction purposes and wood pulp for paper products, alongside recreational uses, while in other areas only recreation is permitted. Additionally, mineral extraction through mining <b>and</b> <b>oil</b> <b>and</b> natural gas exploration and recovery are also conducted, though in Sawtooth National Forest this has become less common due to a consensus to protect the natural surroundings. Leases offered to ranchers {{to allow them to}} graze cattle and sheep on the forest are common. The forest provides guidelines and enforces environmental regulations to ensure that resources are not overexploited and that necessary commodities are available for future generations.|$|E
5|$|At {{midnight on}} 20 July 1947, the Dutch {{launched}} a major military offensive called Operatie Product, {{with the intent}} of conquering the Republic. Claiming violations of the Linggajati Agreement, the Dutch described the campaign as politionele acties ("police actions") to restore law and order. This used to be the task of the KNIL. However, at the time the majority of the Dutch troops in Indonesia belonged to the Royal Netherlands Army. Soon after the end of World War II, 25,000 volunteers (among them 5,000 marines) had been sent overseas. They were later followed by larger numbers of conscripts from the Netherlands. In the offensive, Dutch forces drove Republican troops out of parts of Sumatra, and East and West Java. The Republicans were confined to the Yogyakarta region of Java. To maintain their force in Java, now numbering 100,000 troops, the Dutch gained control of lucrative Sumatran plantations, <b>and</b> <b>oil</b> <b>and</b> coal installations, and in Java, control of all deep water ports.|$|E

5|$|Houston is {{recognized}} worldwide for its energy industry—particularly {{for oil and}} natural gas—as well as for biomedical research and aeronautics. Renewable energy sources—wind and solar—are also growing economic bases in the city. The Houston Ship Channel is also {{a large part of}} Houston's economic base. Because of these strengths, Houston is designated as a global city by the Globalization and World Cities Study Group and Network and global management consulting firm A.T. Kearney. The Houston area is the top U.S. market for exports, surpassing New York City in 2013, according to data released by the U.S. Department of Commerce's International Trade Administration. In 2012, the Houston–The Woodlands–Sugar Land area recorded $110.3billion in merchandise exports. Petroleum products, chemicals, <b>and</b> <b>oil</b> <b>and</b> gas extraction equipment accounted for roughly two-thirds of the metropolitan area's exports last year. The top three destinations for exports were Mexico, Canada, and Brazil.|$|E
5|$|The {{economy of}} Dawson Creek {{is based on}} four major industries: agriculture, retail, tourism, <b>and</b> <b>oil</b> <b>and</b> gas. Agriculture has {{historically}} been the most important industry to Dawson Creek, as the city is the regional transshipment point for agricultural commodities. The city is surrounded by the Agricultural Land Reserve, where the soil can support livestock and produces consistently good yields of quality grain and grass crops, such as canola, hay, oats, alfalfa, wheat, and sweet clover. The service and retail sector caters to the city's inhabitants, smaller nearby towns, and rural communities. However, there is significant retail leakage to Grande Prairie, the closest major Alberta city, {{where there is no}} provincial tax on retail purchases, while British Columbia charges 7%. In 2006, the BC government rejected a proposal to lower the sales tax in the province's border communities to 4%. The problem of leakage has been exacerbated in recent years by the introduction of large-format retail stores into the small city. Residents still cross the border for high-priced items but now also purchase medium- and low-priced items from foreign-owned large-format chain stores.|$|E

These workers also had high prevalence of exposure to physical/chemical hazards. In 2010, 39% had frequent skin contact with chemicals.
