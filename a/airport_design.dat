Many also serve as hubs, or places where non-direct flights may land and passengers may switch planes, while others serve primarily direct point-to-point flights. This affects <b>airport</b> <b>design</b> factors, including the number and placement of terminals {{as well as the}} flow of passengers and baggage between different areas of the airport. An airport specializing in point-to-point transit can have international and domestic terminals, each in their separate building equipped with separate baggage handling facilities. In a hub airport, however, spaces and services are shared.|$|E
25|$|Under the {{original}} 1967 <b>airport</b> <b>design,</b> DFW {{was to have}} pier-shaped terminals perpendicular to a central highway. In 1968, the design was revised to provide for semicircular terminals, which served to isolate loading and unloading areas from the central highway, and to provide additional room for parking {{in the middle of}} each semicircle. The plan proposed thirteen such terminals, but only four were built initially.|$|E
25|$|In 2017, Mayor Sly James re-initiated the {{conversation}} for Kansas City's potential new terminal. Local design form Burns & McDonnell proactively proposed a privately funded option {{that would not}} require new public taxes. (Even if not privately funded, airport reconstruction would {{be paid for by}} takeoff and landing fees generated by the airport, not a separate tax initiative). Initially Burns & McDonnell were the only firm to present a privately funded option. In June 2017, <b>Airport</b> <b>design</b> firm AECOM also approached Kansas City to advise they would also submit a privately funded proposal. On July 18th 2017, two new teams emerged to submit proposals to the city for a new terminal.|$|E

His acting and accordion talents at Princeton led him to be invited to the University Players, an intercollegiate summer stock company in West Falmouth, Massachusetts, on Cape Cod. The company had been organized in 1928 and would run until 1932, with Joshua Logan, Bretaigne Windust and Charles Leatherbee as directors. Stewart performed in bit parts in the Players' productions in Cape Cod during the summer of 1932, after he graduated.|$|E
