40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the validity of}} the Purchasing Power Parity (PPP) theory, using 12 different single-product baskets of Apple devices. Given the presented advantages of Apple indices as PPP measurement in comparison to the most prominent informal index- the Big Mac index (BMI), they are therefore pointed out to be more adequate modern measures of PPP. Presented study investigates if the theory holds for different products within the same niche across 37 countries. Furthermore, this paper presents results of cross country ordinary least squares (OLS) regression analysis of the data for 6 different Apple products. Results point out that most-favoured nation (MFN) <b>duty</b> <b>rates</b> and sales taxes together with <b>additional</b> <b>duties</b> and taxes are main factors that affect currency valuation against the U. S. dollar. In contrary to BMI, Apple indices indicate real undervaluation of most of the national currencies against the U. S. dollar and have also shown to be more supportive to the PPP validity than the BMI...|$|R

50|$|Inverted tariff {{benefits}} exist {{when the}} <b>duty</b> <b>rate</b> {{for the overall}} finished good {{is lower than the}} <b>duty</b> <b>rate</b> of the component parts. Therefore, by manufacturing finished goods within an FTZ, US importers {{can take advantage of the}} inverted tariff <b>duty</b> <b>rate,</b> all while keeping manufacturing operations within the US. Inverted tariff works when an importer with manufacturing authority within an FTZ is allowed to admit their components into the zone duty-free, manufacture the finished good, and pay CBP duties on the foreign content in the finished good at the lower <b>duty</b> <b>rate</b> of the finished goods at the time of entry. The importer avoids paying the higher <b>duty</b> <b>rate</b> on the component parts and defers the lower duty payment on the value of the foreign content until the time of consumption in the commerce of the US. Inverted tariff is seen predominantly in the manufacturing industry, benefiting automotive, petroleum, pharmaceutical, aerospace, electronics, textile companies and many more.|$|R

40|$|Different motives in {{determining}} the level and structure of alcohol taxes lead to greatly varying alcohol excise duty levels. The aim {{of this paper is}} to look at alcohol excise <b>duty</b> <b>rates</b> in European Union (EU) and the mechanisms affecting them. Also the trends in alcohol prices and alcohol consumption will be discussed. Material. Material concerning alcohol taxes and consumption comes from available statistics and published literature. Results. This paper shows that despite many attempts the EU has not been able to harmonise alcohol excise <b>duty</b> <b>rates</b> in its member states. The importance of alcohol taxes as an alcohol control measure has decreased as the real value of alcohol excise <b>duty</b> <b>rates</b> has decreased in most EU countries during the last decades. Discussion. In most European countries the share of alcohol taxes of the price of alcoholic beverages is quite low. Therefore, increasing alcohol excise <b>duty</b> <b>rates</b> would in most countries lead to increased alcohol tax revenues to the public sector. Consequently, increasing alcohol excise <b>duty</b> <b>rates</b> would serve both the fiscal and the health and social policy interests of the state...|$|R
