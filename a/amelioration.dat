5|$|Shahîd further {{argues that}} the facts of Philip's alleged Christianity would also {{discourage}} Eusebius from celebrating that emperor. Firstly, Philip lacks an exciting conversion narrative; secondly, his religion was private, unlike Constantine's very public patronage of the faith; and, thirdly, his reign only lasted five years, not long enough to enact much <b>amelioration</b> of the Christians' condition. In Shahîd's view, the insignificance of his reign to the progress of Christianity, Eusebius' subject, combined with Eusebius' role as Constantine's panegyrist, explain the tone and content of his account.|$|E

In accidents, damage can be reduced by use of seat belts, child safety seats and motorcycle helmets, and presence of roll bars and airbags. Education programs exist to lower the number of crashes. In addition, changes to public policy and safety laws can be made; these include speed limits, seat belt and helmet laws, and road engineering practices.|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{shows that}} Late Weichselian {{vegetation}} on Andøya {{may have been}} more diverse than previous studies have revealed. The thorough investigation of macrofossils in four parallel cores provides more reliable evidence for interpreting changes in vegetation cover than reconstructions based on a single core. The botanical macrofossils retrieved in this study largely support previous studies at the northern tip of Andøya. Arctic plant communities, probably dominated by Papaver and several species of Poaceae and Brassicaceae characterized the area. Climatic <b>ameliorations</b> occurred at c. 22 000 – 20 100, 20 100 – 19 500, 19 500 – 19 200, 18 800 – 18 100, 17 500 – 16 800 and 15 100 – 14 500 cal. yr BP, and during these <b>ameliorations,</b> the vegetation {{may have been more}} diverse than recorded both in the pollen- and macrofossil material. Macrofossils (bones) of little auk (Alle alle), coupled with other evidence, suggest a longlasting presence of sea birds in the area. Manuring by birds made a considerable impact on the local terrestrial environment, and during the <b>ameliorations</b> in particular, these favorable local habitats may have supported species not found in the present-day Arctic, e. g. Urtica dioica. Sedimentary ancient DNA (sedaDNA) provides evidence that during the <b>ameliorations,</b> Andøya may have hosted small enclaves of boreal conifer trees. Their presence on Andøya has yet to be detected by macrofossil- or pollen analyses, but the DNA evidence provides an important contribution to the debate concerning glacial survival of boreal trees within Scandinavia...|$|R

Similarly, a wide variety of nuts have served as food for Indigenous Australians for many centuries. Other culinary nuts, though known from ancient times, have seen dramatic increases in use in modern times. The most striking such example is the peanut. Its usage was popularized by the work of George Washington Carver, who discovered and popularized many applications of the peanut after employing peanut plants for soil <b>amelioration</b> in fields used to grow cotton.|$|E

5|$|Asche {{began the}} 2015 season among the team's hottest hitters, and a {{mainstay}} {{in the lineup}} as the team's starting third baseman. However, in late April, he began working on skills as an outfielder, ostensibly {{in preparation for the}} arrival of minor league prospect Maikel Franco, regarded as a stronger defensive third baseman. In fact, the Phillies optioned Asche back to Triple-A on May 12 to accelerate his development as a left fielder, as Franco was hitting very well in the minor leagues, and could be ready for a promotion. Although surprised and disappointed by the move, Asche sought to trust the organization and play wherever it needed him. Ultimately, Asche struggled to find playing time during the remainder of the season, although MLB.com writer Todd Zolecki said that Asche would be given an opportunity in 2016 as the Phillies like his makeup, but the burden will be on him to produce results to justify the playing time, given the <b>amelioration</b> of other options at his positions.|$|E

25|$|The {{main feature}} of {{parametric}} methods {{is that they}} only rely on the genome under study to infer HGT events that may have occurred on its lineage. It has been a considerable advantage at the early times of the sequencing era, when few closely related genomes were available for comparative methods. However, because they rely on the uniformity of the host's signature to infer HGT events, not accounting for the host's intra-genomic variability will result in overpredictionsflagging native segments as possible HGT events. Similarly, the transferred segments need to exhibit the donor's signature and to be {{significantly different from the}} recipient's. Furthermore, genomic segments of foreign origin are subject to the same mutational processes {{as the rest of the}} host genome, and so the difference between the two tends to vanish over time, a process referred to as <b>amelioration.</b> This limits the ability of parametric methods to detect ancient HGTs.|$|E
25|$|In the {{conclusion}} to the essay, he wrote of the Jews that 'only one thing can redeem you from the burden of your curse: the redemption of Ahasuerus — going under!' Although this has been taken by some commentators to mean actual physical annihilation, {{in the context of}} the essay it seems to refer only to the eradication of Jewish separateness and traditions. Wagner advises Jews to follow the example of Ludwig Börne by abandoning Judaism. In this way Jews will take part in 'this regenerative work of deliverance through self-annulment; then are we one and un-dissevered!' Wagner was therefore calling for the assimilation of Jews into mainstream German culture and society - although there can be little doubt, from the words he uses in the essay, that this call was prompted at least as much by anti-semitism as by a desire for social <b>amelioration.</b> (In the very first publication, the word here translated as 'self-annulment' was represented by the phrase 'self-annihilating, bloody struggle').|$|E

Despite the heavy pressure from the King, the army and conservative circles in Rome, Giolitti neither treated strikes – which were not illegal – as a crime, nor dissolved the Fasci, nor authorised the use of firearms against popular demonstrations. His policy was “to allow these economic struggles to resolve themselves through <b>amelioration</b> of the condition of the workers” and not to interfere in the process.|$|E

25|$|Forestry has an {{important}} part {{to play in the}} <b>amelioration</b> of the conditions in semi-arid and arid lands. If properly planned, forestry can make {{an important}} contribution to the general welfare of the people living in desert areas. The living standard {{of the people in the}} desert is low. They can not afford other fuels like gas, kerosene etc. Fire wood is their main fuel, of the total consumption of wood about 75 percent is firewood. The forest cover in desert is low. Rajasthan has a forest area of 31150km2. which is about 9% of the geographical area. The forest area is mainly in southern districts of Rajasthan like Udaipur and Chittorgarh. The minimum forest area is in Churu district only 80km2. Thus the forest is insufficient to fulfill the needs of firewood and grazing in desert districts. This diverts the much needed cattledung from the field to the hearth. This in turn results into the decrease in agricultural production. Agroforestry model is best suited to the people of desert. Some Institutes have done good work in Agroforestry.|$|E
25|$|At {{about the}} same time as the role of the Panchayat was declining, a number of other {{institutions}} arose that would replace the Panchayat's role in contributing to the sense of social cohesiveness that the community desperately sought. By the mid-19th century, the Parsis were keenly aware that their numbers were declining and saw education as a possible solution to the problem. In 1842 Jamsetjee Jejeebhoy established the Parsi Benevolent Fund with the aim of improving, through education, the condition of the impoverished Parsis still living in Surat and its environs. In 1849 the Parsis established their first school (co-educational, which was a novelty at the time, but would soon be split into separate schools for boys and girls) and the education movement quickened. The number of Parsi schools multiplied, but other schools and colleges were also freely attended. Accompanied by better education and social cohesiveness, the community's sense of distinctiveness grew, and in 1854 Dinshaw Maneckji Petit founded the Persian Zoroastrian <b>Amelioration</b> Fund with the aim of improving conditions for his less fortunate co-religionists in Iran. The fund succeeded in convincing a number of Iranian Zoroastrians to emigrate to India (where they are known today as Iranis) and the efforts of its emissary Maneckji Limji Hataria may have been instrumental in obtaining a remission of the jizya for their co-religionists in 1882.|$|E
