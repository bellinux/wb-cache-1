Unlike Horner, he decided to perform a cladistic <b>analysis</b> <b>to</b> establish a phylogeny. This showed an evolutionary tree wherein Achelousaurus split off between Einiosaurus and Pachyrhinosaurus, as Horner had predicted. Contrary to Horner's claim, Styracosaurus albertensis could not have been a direct ancestor, as it was a sister species of Centrosaurus in Sampson's analysis.|$|E

The other contained Edmontosaurus, Saurolophus, Prosaurolophus, Lophorhothon, and Shantungosaurus.|$|E

5|$|They used a {{cladistic}} <b>analysis</b> <b>to</b> examine its {{relationships within}} Oryzomyini, also including {{two species of}} Holochilus, Lundomys, and five other oryzomyines.

Another form described as a species of Holochilus, Holochilus primigenus, may also be related, but is likely to fall outside the Holochilus–Noronhomys clade.|$|E
