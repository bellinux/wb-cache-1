25|$|Egerszeg, {{even though}} it was on the {{periphery}} of the comitatus, became its capital in the 18th century, mostly because the councils were always held there, because of its importance in the Ottoman times and because it wasn't the estate of a local lord, unlike the other towns in Zala. The county hall was built between 1730 and 1732 in Baroque style, <b>and</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> time it was the only significant building of the town. In the 1760s a large church and a barracks was built. Most of the citizens still not owned stone-built houses, and fires often destroyed the town, until 1826, when stone buildings were built.|$|E

He distributed the remaining rings of the Seven and the Nine to lords of Dwarves and Men. Dwarves proved too resilient to bend to his will, but the Men were enslaved by Sauron as the Nazgûl, his most feared servants. Well aware of the strength of the Númenóreans after his earlier defeat, Sauron withdrew from the coasts <b>and</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> time avoided directly challenging them, although he managed to use some of the Nine rings to snare three of their great lords.|$|E

25|$|The {{ruler of}} Cochin {{continued}} to rule {{with the help}} of the Portuguese. Meanwhile, the Portuguese secretly tried to enter into an alliance with the Zamorin. A few later attempts by the Zamorin to conquer the Cochin port were thwarted by the ruler of Cochin {{with the help of}} the Portuguese. Slowly, the Portuguese armory at Cochin was increased, presumably to help the king protect Cochin. However, the measured led to a reduction of the power of the king and an increase in Portuguese influence. From 1503 to 1663, Cochin was virtually ruled by Portugal through the namesake Cochin raja. Cochin remained the capital of Portuguese India until 1530. <b>And</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> a time, right after Goa, Cochin situated in the center of East Indies, was the best place Portugal had in India.

25|$|In 1553, this Neill {{sold the}} island to James MacDonald of Islay. Neill died without issue, and the next in line to the chiefship was another Neil, who {{obtained}} the lands of Taynish. His descendant Hector Macneill of Taynish purchased Gigha in 1590. With {{the power of the}} Campbells growing and spreading out into the Inner Hebrides, the influence of the McNeills of Gigha decreased. At about this time the MacNeils on more remote island of Barra, far removed of Campbell power, began to grow in prominence <b>and</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> time since have been regarded as Chief of the Clan and Name. Descending from this branch were the MacNeils of Colonsay who obtained Colonsay in 1700 and owned it until 1904 when it was sold by John Carstairs McNeill. According to Moncreiffe, {{there is reason to believe}} that historically this branch were superior to the current chiefs of the Clan Macneil. There is even a school of thought that there is no relation at all between this branch of McNeills to that of Barra. However, according to a 1962 decree by the Lord Lyon, the chiefs of MacNeil of Barra are chiefs of the whole name of MacNeil by Scots law.|$|E
25|$|However, chromatographic {{methods for}} {{separation}} started being {{adopted in the}} early 1980s. Developments were ongoing in the time period between when Cohn fractionation started being used, in 1946, and when chromatography started being used, in 1983. In 1962, the Kistler & Nistchmann process was created which was a spin-off of the Cohn process. Chromatographic processes {{began to take shape}} in 1983. In the 1990s, the Zenalb and the CSL Albumex processes were created which incorporated chromatography with a few variations. The general approach to using chromatography for plasma fractionation for albumin is: recovery of supernatant I, delipidation, anion exchange chromatography, cation exchange chromatography, and gel filtration chromatography. The recovered purified material is formulated with combinations of sodium octanoate and sodium N-acetyl tryptophanate and then subjected to viral inactivation procedures, including pasteurisation at 60°C. This is a more efficient alternative than the Cohn process for four main reasons: 1) smooth automation and a relatively inexpensive plant was needed, 2) easier to sterilize equipment and maintain a good manufacturing environment, 3) chromatographic processes are less damaging to the albumin protein, and 4) a more successful albumin end result can be achieved. Compared with the Cohn process, the albumin purity went up from about 95% to 98% using chromatography, and the yield increased from about 65% to 85%. Small percentage increases make a difference in regard to sensitive measurements like purity. There is one big drawback in using chromatography, which {{has to do with the}} economics of the process. Although the method was efficient from the processing aspect, acquiring the necessary equipment is a big task. Large machinery is necessary, <b>and</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> time the lack of equipment availability was not conducive to its widespread use. The components are more readily available now but it is still a work in progress.|$|E
