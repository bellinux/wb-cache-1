5|$|On the Taaienberg, Tiesj Benoot (Lotto–Soudal) led the peloton, with Boonen {{right behind}} him. A ten-rider group {{broke away from}} the peloton over the climb, with Benoot and Boonen joined by Roelandts, Cancellara, Boom, Vanmarcke, Daniel Oss (BMC) and three other Etixx–Quick-Step riders (Terpstra, Štybar and Trentin). On the next climb, the Boigneberg, Cancellara's rear {{derailleur}} failed and it took more than <b>a</b> <b>minute</b> <b>for</b> his team to bring him a replacement bike, putting him a long way behind the other favourites. Shortly afterwards, the breakaway was caught by the chasing group; the combined group was then caught by another group that contained Sagan and Kwiatkowski to create a 20-man lead group, although Štybar soon suffered a puncture and fell out of the group. Cancellara, meanwhile, was in a group led by his teammates Yaroslav Popovych and Markel Irizar around two minutes behind.|$|E
5|$|The 1978 season saw a {{succession}} of retirements for Villeneuve, often after problems with the new Michelin radial tyres. Early in the season, he started on the front row at the United States Grand Prix West, but crashed out of the lead on lap39. Despite calls in the Italian press {{for him to be}} replaced, Ferrari persisted with him. Towards the end of the season, Villeneuve's results improved. He finished second on the road at the Italian Grand Prix, although he was penalised <b>a</b> <b>minute</b> <b>for</b> jumping the start, and ran second at the United States Grand Prix before his engine failed. Finally at the season-ending Canadian Grand Prix, this time at the Circuit Notre Dame Island in Montreal (a circuit that was eventually named after him) Villeneuve scored his first Grand Prix win after Jean-Pierre Jarier's Lotus stopped with engine trouble. To date, he remains the only Canadian to win his home race.|$|E

25|$|The {{spinning}} mule spins {{textile fibres}} into yarn by an intermittent process. In the draw stroke, the roving is pulled through rollers and twisted; {{on the return}} it is wrapped onto the spindle. Its rival, the throstle frame or ring frame uses a continuous process, where the roving is drawn, twisted and wrapped in one action. The mule {{was the most common}} spinning machine from 1790 until about 1900 and was still used for fine yarns until the early 1980s. In 1890, a typical cotton mill would have over 60 mules, each with 1,320 spindles, which would operate four times <b>a</b> <b>minute</b> <b>for</b> 56 hours a week.|$|E
25|$|According to Forbes magazine, Jerry Seinfeld's {{earnings}} {{from the show}} in 1998 came to US$267 million, including syndication earnings. He refused NBC's offer of $5 million per episode, or over $100 million total, to continue the show into a tenth season. The offer NBC made to Seinfeld was over three times higher per episode than anyone on TV had ever been offered before. Seinfeld told the network {{that he was not}} married and had no children, and wished to focus on his personal life. As reported in July 2007, he was the second-highest earner in the TV industry, earning at the time $60 million a year. The show became the first TV series to command over $1 million <b>a</b> <b>minute</b> <b>for</b> advertising–a mark previously attained only by the Super Bowl.|$|E
25|$|The new {{division}} {{was still being}} formed when the Luftwaffe launched a series of devastating raids, beginning with the notorious Coventry Blitz on 14/15 November. The Coventry raid was preceded by a dozen pathfinder aircraft of Kampfgeschwader 100 riding an X-Gerät beam to drop flares and incendiary bombs on the target. The huge fires that {{broke out in the}} congested city centre then attracted successive 40-strong waves of bombers flying at heights between 12,000 and 20,000 feet to saturate the defences. The AA Defence Commander (AADC) of 95th HAA Rgt had prepared a series of concentrations to be fired using sound-locators and GL Mk. I gun-laying radar, and 128 concentrations were fired before the bombing severed all lines of communication and the noise drowned out sound-location. Some gun positions were able to fire at searchlight beam intersections, glimpsed through the smoke and guessing the range. Although the Coventry guns fired 10 rounds <b>a</b> <b>minute</b> <b>for</b> the whole 10-hour raid, only three aircraft were shot down over the UK that night, and the city centre was gutted. The Coventry raid was followed by three consecutive nights (19–22 November) of attacks on Birmingham and other Black Country industrial towns including West Bromwich, Dudley and Tipton.|$|E

500|$|The Illawarra Steam Navigation Company was a {{shipping}} company that serviced the south coast of New South Wales, Australia from 1858 {{to the early}} 1950s. [...] It was formed through the amalgamation of the General Steam Navigation Company, the Kiama Steam Navigation Company and the Shoalhaven Steam Navigation Company, each of whom serviced parts of the south coast with their respective vessels. After merging, the new company held a near monopoly in regard to shipping on the south coast, and their fleet visited every significant port between Sydney and the border of Victoria. The company transported both passengers {{and a range of}} produce, including livestock, and hence it became known as the 'Pig and Whistle Line': it was said that ships would wait an hour for a pig but not <b>a</b> <b>minute</b> <b>for</b> a passenger.|$|E
500|$|After {{the turn}} in Bastogne, the {{breakaway}} continued. It was, however, reduced in numbers, as Quaade, Chevrier and Vergaerde all fell {{back before the}} peloton reached the Côte de Wanne, four hours into the race. Katusha led the peloton as it approached the climb. On the climb itself, Astana came {{to the front of}} the peloton and led the chase, with the breakaway's lead reduced to under a minute. On the Côte de Stockeu, Andriy Hrivko (Astana), Gorka Izagirre (Movistar) and Simon Yates (...) attacked and joined the lead group; more riders then bridged across to form a 21-man group. This included five Astana riders, though not Nibali. On the Côte de la Haute-Levée, several riders attacked again to form a smaller breakaway; these were Tanel Kangert and Michele Scarponi (both Astana), Manuele Boaro (...) , Esteban Chaves (Orica-GreenEDGE) and Julián Arredondo (...) [...] They had a 25-second lead at the summit and, although Boaro and Arredondo were dropped on the Col du Rosier, this increased to more than <b>a</b> <b>minute</b> <b>for</b> a short while. It was reduced to 45 seconds on the Col du Maquisard, however, as Movistar worked hard in the peloton to bring them back.|$|E

2500|$|For {{the second}} stage of the race, the peloton was ferried over to the {{volcanic}} island of Ischia, which was hosting the Giro d'Italia {{for the first time in}} 54 years.

2500|$|Another common injury faced {{was those}} caused by blades. [...] If the wound was too advance for simple stitch and bandage, it would often result in {{amputation}} of the limb. [...] Surgeons of the Medieval battlefield had {{the practice of}} amputation down to an art. [...] Typically {{it would have taken}} less than <b>a</b> <b>minute</b> <b>for</b> a surgeon to remove the damaged limb, and another three to four minutes to stop the bleeding. [...] The surgeon would first place the limb on a block of wood and tie ligatures above and below the site of surgery. [...] Then the soft tissue would be cut through, thus exposing the bone, which was then sawed through. [...] The stump was then bandaged and left to heal. [...] The rates of mortality among amputation patients was around 39%, that number grew to roughly 62% for those patients with a high leg amputation. [...] Ideas of medieval surgery are often construed in our modern mind as barbaric, as our view is diluted with our own medical knowledge. [...] Surgery and medical practice in general was at its height of advancement for its time. [...] All procedures were done with the intent to save lives, not to cause extra pain and suffering. [...] The speed of the procedure by the surgeon was an important factor, as the limit of pain and blood loss lead to higher survival rates among these procedures. [...] Injuries to major arteries that caused mass blood loss were not usually treatable as shown in the evidence of archeological remains. [...] We know this as wounds severe enough to sever major arteries left incisions on the bone which is excavated by archaeologists. [...] Wounds were also taught to be covered to improve healing. [...] Forms of antiseptics were also used in order to stave off infection. [...] To dress wounds all sorts of dressing were used such as grease, absorbent dressings, spider webs, honey, ground shellfish, clay and turpentine. [...] Some of these methods date back to Roman battlefield medicine.|$|E

2500|$|Mike Phillips {{attempted}} to enter an A410 at the 24 Hours of Daytona in 2001, {{but did not}} attend the race. The Sports Racing World Cup had been renamed to the FIA Sportscar Championship, but the A410, now driven by Lupberger and Ben Collins, started the season as it had finished 2000; with a retirement, although it did last for 74 laps before blowing its engine with half an hour to go at Barcelona. Next up was the Donington Park of the European Le Mans Series, which saw both A410s entered; although the A410 of Patrick Lemarié did not make the start of the race, due to engine problems, Lupberger and Collins were classified 23rd, having retired after 54 minutes [...] and 35 laps [...] due to another gearbox problem. The 1000 km of Monza, part of the FIA Sportscar Championship, saw the first success for the A410; Collins and Lupberger brought their car home in second, 7 seconds behind the Ferrari 333SP-Judd of Giovanni Lavaggi and Christian Vann. The upturn in form continued at Spa-Francorchamps, where Collins and Lupberger brought the A410 home in fourth, a lap down, but having set the second fastest lap of the race. Lupberger and Collins were partnered by Harri Toivonen for the 24 Hours of Le Mans in the A410-001 chassis, whilst Zwart partnered Xavier Pompidou and Scott Maxwell in the other; neither finished, as the A410-001 retired due to fuel pump issue after 11 hours and 134 laps, and the other car crashed out after 15 hours and 66 laps. Having returned to the FIA Sportscar Championship, Collins and Lupberger took a pair of fourth-place finishes, at Brno and Magny-Cours. The team went even better at Donington Park; Collins and Lupberger won by almost <b>a</b> <b>minute,</b> <b>for</b> the car's maiden victory. The penultimate round of the season, held at Mondello Park, was a little less successful, as the team finished ninth overall, and sixth in the SR1 class. In the final race of the season, held at the Nürburgring, the car was disqualified from third place due to issues with its dimensions. Team Ascari finished the season in fourth, with 71 points; nine behind Racing for Holland in third, but 30 ahead of R in fifth. The team's one European Le Mans Series race resulted in them being classified in eighth, with 11 points.|$|E
