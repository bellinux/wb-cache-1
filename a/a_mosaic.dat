5|$|In 2012, it was {{reported}} that Robert Hamilton, an archaeologist who worked on the Temple Mount after the 1927 Jericho earthquake, had discovered remains under al-Aqsa mosque that he did not publish in his book on the excavations.

40|$|In the {{teaching}} of geometry regular <b>mosaics</b> represent <b>a</b> suitable environment for developing of geometrical imagination and constructing procedures based {{on the use of}} isometries in plane. Mosaics are plane tesselations, i. e. coverages of plane by (in most case identical) shapes without gaps and overlaps. The construction of <b>a</b> geometrical <b>mosaic</b> follows from <b>a</b> shape of tiles and their assembling. Analyse of <b>a</b> <b>mosaics</b> is based on identification of its grid and a construction of tiles...|$|R
5|$|Invader {{has made}} mosaics in New York City five times, and Hong Kong on three {{separate}} occasions. He has tagged historic buildings and other locations. On 31 December 1999 he placed <b>a</b> <b>mosaic</b> on the letter D of the Hollywood Sign {{to mark the}} Y2K bug. During subsequent trips to Los Angeles he placed mosaics on the eight other letters of the sign.|$|E
5|$|Later vestiges {{date from}} the Roman epoch and include a colonnaded road lined with shops. Of the large marble columns {{bordering}} the Roman street only fragments and bases remain. The Romans also built a monumental staircase adorned with mosaic patterns {{that leads to the}} top of the podium. To the right of the Roman road, near the entrance of the site stands a nymphaeum with niches where statues of the nymphs once stood. The floor of the nymphaeum is covered by <b>a</b> <b>mosaic</b> depicting the Maenads. Across the colonnaded road, facing the nymphaeum, are the ruins of a Roman villa; only the villa's courtyard has survived along with the remains of <b>a</b> <b>mosaic</b> depicting the four seasons. To the right of the processional Roman staircase stands a cubic altar, also of Roman construction. Other Roman period structures include two columns of a great portico leading to pools and other cultic installations.|$|E
5|$|On this site, 171 {{plant species}} are surveyed. Given {{its size and}} poor soil, this {{diversity}} is notable. Management undertaken {{in recent years has}} been essential to maintaining open areas, the most threatened by primary succession. Thus, the various vegetation layers (pioneer and mature woodland, bushy areas, open areas) provide <b>a</b> <b>mosaic</b> of habitats, and thus remarkable species.|$|E
40|$|The {{problem to}} control transformations of <b>an</b> {{ecological}} <b>mosaic</b> {{is becoming more}} and more important. These transformations occur according to processes linked with thresholds of metastability, which correspond to a passage from a metastable equilibrium to another. Trying to evaluate the metastability of <b>a</b> certain ecological <b>mosaic,</b> it is necessary to identify the levels of replacement and to measure the metastability of each element, in order to consider their complementarity. It is possible to measure the capacity of <b>an</b> ecological <b>mosaic,</b> formed by <b>a</b> vegetational <b>mosaic,</b> defining <b>a</b> synthetic quantity, named biological territorial capacity, or Btc. It ranks landscape&rsquo;s elements, giving high values to high-resistance ecosystems. Therefore, it is possible to use the Btc as a synthetic indicator of the metastability of <b>an</b> ecological <b>mosaic.</b> Some examples of application regard Gallarate heath-land (local scale) and Lathium, Lombardy and Sicily (regional scales) ...|$|R

5|$|The site {{consists}} of an old quarry of sandstone dated to the Famennian stage in the Late Devonian epoch. It was backfilled in the 1970s with marl. The new soil was re-colonized by pioneer species, which coexist alongside an established afforestation, forming <b>a</b> <b>mosaic</b> of habitats.|$|E
5|$|A bronze-covered door, {{with relief}} panels {{depicting}} figures, opens onto the entrance hall. In Burges's time {{the door had}} a letterbox, {{in the form of}} Mercury, the messenger of the gods. The letterbox is now lost, but a contemporary copy is in the collection of The Higgins Art Gallery & Museum. The porch contains a white marble seat and column, and on the floor is <b>a</b> <b>mosaic</b> of Pinkie, a favourite poodle of Burges. Cartooned by H.W. Lonsdale, it resembles the cave canem floor at Pompei.|$|E

Though this is not always the case, genetic mutations can occur spontaneously in one sex cell of a parent during gametogenesis. In these cases, called germline mutations, the mutation will be present in the single-celled zygote conceived from the affected sperm or egg cell, and the condition can be inherited by the next generation.|$|E
5|$|During the Samaritan {{revolt of}} 529, Bethlehem was sacked and its {{walls and the}} Church of the Nativity destroyed; they were rebuilt on the orders of the Emperor Justinian I. In 614, the Persian Sassanid Empire, {{supported}} by Jewish rebels, invaded Palestina Prima and captured Bethlehem. A story recounted in later sources holds that they refrained from destroying the church on seeing the magi depicted in Persian clothing in <b>a</b> <b>mosaic.</b>|$|E
5|$|Mosaics {{are among}} the most {{enduring}} of Roman decorative arts, and are found on the surfaces of floors and other architectural features such as walls, vaulted ceilings, and columns. The most common form is the tessellated mosaic, formed from uniform pieces (tesserae) of materials such as stone and glass. Mosaics were usually crafted on site, but sometimes assembled and shipped as ready-made panels. <b>A</b> <b>mosaic</b> workshop was led by the master artist (pictor) who worked with two grades of assistants.|$|E

5|$|Shin used archival {{photographs}} of the 2nd and 3rd Avenue Elevated train (El) to create compositions in ceramic tile, glass mosaic, and laminated glass. The imagery is manipulated and re-configured with each level having a different design. On the south east-corner entrance at Third Avenue, there are ceramic tiles depicting construction beams and the cranes that dismantled the El in the 1940s. At the mezzanine, <b>a</b> <b>mosaic</b> reveals the sky where the train had previously been present. The platform level features semi-transparent and reflective glass depicting vintage scenes of the neighborhood.|$|E
5|$|The House of the Knight {{next door}} also has <b>a</b> <b>mosaic</b> of Bacchus, this time showing {{coming across the}} {{sleeping}} Ariadne, who later bore him six children. The house {{takes its name from}} a bronze statue of a rider found here in 1918 that is now on display in the archaeological museum in Rabat. It was a large building, with an area of about , and incorporated a substantial area dedicated to commercial activities including eight or nine shops opening onto the road and a large olive-pressing complex.|$|E
5|$|The {{exterior}} of the Royal Albert Hall (built in 1867–1871 to the designs of Francis Fowke and Henry Young Darracott Scott) is embellished with <b>a</b> <b>mosaic</b> frieze composed of sixteen separate designs by multiple artists.

5|$|The ruined Temple of Baal-hamon {{was located}} {{on the top of}} Jabal al-Muntar hill which oversees the spring of Efqa. Constructed in AD 89, it {{consisted}} of a cella and a vestibule with two columns.

5|$|In 2010, {{a genetic}} study was made basing on the {{evolutionary}} history of common elands. Located in the sub-Saharan savanna biome of east and southern Africa, the study used methods like analysis of mitochondrial DNA control-region fragments from 122 individuals {{to learn more}} about various topics, such as the phylogeography, genetic diversity, demographic history of the species. The conclusions strongly supported the presence of a longer-standing population in the south and <b>a</b> <b>mosaic</b> of Pleistocene refugia in the east. It is believed that today their extinction from these parts could be due to colonization. The similarity of dates obtained from more studies indicates a significant event c. 200 ka, which had brought a great change in the genetic history of the species.|$|E
