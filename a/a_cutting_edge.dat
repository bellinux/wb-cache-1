5|$|The talonid, {{another group}} of cusps, makes {{up the back of}} the tooth. It is wider than long and {{contains}} a well-developed cusp, the hypoconid, on the outer side and a depression, the talonid basin, in the middle. The cristid obliqua connects to the hypoconid. The smaller hypoconulid cusp is present towards the inner side of the tooth, and the hypoconid and hypoconulid are connected by <b>a</b> <b>cutting</b> <b>edge</b> which is suggestive of the presence of a metacone cusp on the upper molars. Further towards the inner side, a crest, the entocristid, rims the talonid basin; on m1, it is swollen and on m2, it contains two small cuspules, but a distinct entoconid cusp is absent. This entocristid is continuous with the lingual cingulum.|$|E
5|$|The win set {{up another}} rematch for the Giants, {{this time in}} the Super Bowl against the Buffalo Bills. Throughout the 1990 season, the Bills' {{emergence}} as a championship caliber team {{had been one of the}} largest storylines. The Bills had <b>a</b> <b>cutting</b> <b>edge,</b> no-huddle offense, led by head coach Marv Levy, quarterback Jim Kelly, running back Thurman Thomas, wide receiver Andre Reed and an offensive line led by Kent Hull. They had also recorded a 13–3 record during the 1990 season, culminating with a 51–3 victory over the Los Angeles Raiders in the AFC Championship game. Heading into the game the Bills were installed as seven point favorites.|$|E
5|$|Production of {{components}} would be split between Breguet and BAC, and the aircraft themselves would be assembled on two production lines; {{one in the}} UK and one in France, To avoid any duplication of work, each aircraft component had only one source. The British light strike/tactical support versions were the most demanding design, requiring supersonic performance, superior avionics, <b>a</b> <b>cutting</b> <b>edge</b> nav/attack system of more accuracy and complexity than the French version, moving map display, laser range-finder and marked-target seeker (LRMTS). As a result, the initial Br.121 design needed a thinner wing, redesigned fuselage, a higher rear cockpit, and after-burning engines. While putting on smiling faces for the public, maintaining {{the illusion of a}} shared design, the British design de facto departed from the French sub-sonic Breguet 121 {{to such a degree that}} it was for all intents and purposes a new design.|$|E

25|$|The navy of Carthage {{was one of}} {{the largest}} in the Mediterranean, using serial {{production}} to maintain high numbers at moderate cost. The sailors and marines of the Carthaginian navy were predominantly recruited from the Phoenician citizenry, unlike the multiethnic allied and mercenary troops of the Carthaginian armies. The navy offered a stable profession and financial security for its sailors. This helped to contribute to the city's political stability, since the unemployed, debt-ridden poor in other cities were frequently inclined to support revolutionary leaders in the hope of improving their own lot. The reputation of her skilled sailors implies that training of oarsmen and coxswains occurred in peacetime, giving their navy <b>a</b> <b>cutting</b> <b>edge</b> in naval matters.|$|E
25|$|Soft hammer {{finished}} {{pieces are}} usually balanced, symmetrical {{and can be}} relatively smooth. Soft hammer works {{first appeared in the}} Acheulean period, allowing tools with these markings {{to be used as a}} post quem estimation, but with no greater precision. The main advantage of a soft hammer is that a flintknapper is able to remove broader, thinner flakes with barely developed heels, which allows <b>a</b> <b>cutting</b> <b>edge</b> to be maintained or even improved with minimal raw material wastage. However, a high-quality raw material is required to make their use effective. No studies compare the two methods in terms of yield per unit weight of raw material, or the difference in energy use. The use of a soft hammer requires greater use of force by the flintknapper and a steeper learning curve, although it offers more flakes for less raw material.|$|E
25|$|Obsidian {{can be used}} to make {{extremely}} sharp knives, and obsidian blades are a type {{of glass}} knife made using naturally occurring obsidian instead of manufactured glass. Obsidian is used by some surgeons for scalpel blades, although this is not approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for use on humans. Well-crafted obsidian blades, as with any glass knife, can have <b>a</b> <b>cutting</b> <b>edge</b> many times sharper than high-quality steel surgical scalpels, the cutting edge of the blade being only about 3 nanometers thick. Even the sharpest metal knife has a jagged, irregular blade when viewed under a strong enough microscope; when examined even under an electron microscope an obsidian blade is still smooth and even. One study found that obsidian incisions produced fewer inflammatory cells and less granulation tissue at seven days, in a group of rats, although no differences were found after 21 days. Don Crabtree produced obsidian blades for surgery and other purposes, and has written articles on the subject. Obsidian scalpels may currently be purchased for surgical use on research animals.|$|E

40|$|In this paper, contact {{conditions}} {{between a}} tool and a workpiece material for wear-simulating turning by a cutter with a sharp-cornered edge and with <b>a</b> rounded <b>cutting</b> <b>edge</b> are analysed. The {{results of the}} experimental study of specific contact load distribution over the artificial flank wear-land of the cutter in free orthogonal turning of the disk from titanium alloy (Ti[6]Al[2]Mo[2]Cr), ductile (63 Cu) and brittle (57 Cu 1 Al[3]Mn) brasses are described. Investigations were {{carried out by the}} method of 'split cutter' and by the method of the artificial flank-land of variable width. The experiments with a variable feed rate and <b>a</b> <b>cutting</b> speed show that in titanium alloy machining with <b>a</b> sharp-cornered <b>cutting</b> <b>edge</b> the highest normal contact load ([sigma][h max]= 3400 [...] . 2200 MPa) is observed immediately at the <b>cutting</b> <b>edge,</b> and the curve has a horizontal region with the length of 0. 2 [...] . 0. 6 mm. At a distance from the <b>cutting</b> <b>edge,</b> the value of specific normal contact load is dramatically reduced to 1100 [...] . 500 MPa. The character of normal contact load for <b>a</b> rounded <b>cutting</b> <b>edge</b> is different -it is uniform, and its value is approximately 2 times smaller compared to machining with <b>a</b> sharp-cornered <b>cutting</b> <b>edge.</b> In author's opinion it is connected with generation of a seizure zone in a chip formation region and explains the capacity of highly worn-out cutting tools for titanium alloys machining.

500|$|Early sauropodomorphs such as Massospondylus {{may have}} been herbivorous or omnivorous. As {{recently}} as the 1980s, paleontologists debated the possibility of carnivory in the [...] "prosauropods". However, the hypothesis of carnivorous [...] "prosauropods" [...] has been discredited, and all recent studies favor a herbivorous or omnivorous lifestyle for these animals. Galton and Upchurch (2004) found that cranial characteristics (such as jaw articulation) of most basal sauropodomorphs are closer to those of herbivorous reptiles than those of carnivorous ones, and {{the shape of the}} tooth crown is similar to those of modern herbivorous or omnivorous iguanas.

Barrett (2000) proposed that basal sauropodomorphs supplemented their herbivorous diets with small prey or carrion. Gastroliths (gizzard stones) have been found in association with three Massospondylus fossils from the Forest-Sandstone in Zimbabwe, and with a Massospondylus-like animal from the Late Triassic of Virginia. Until recently, scientists believed that these stones functioned as a gastric mill to aid ingestion of plant material, compensating for its inability to chew, as it is the case in many modern birds. However, Wings and Sander (2007) showed that the polished nature and the abundance of those stones precluded a use as an effective gastric mill in most non-theropod dinosaurs, including Massospondylus.|$|E
