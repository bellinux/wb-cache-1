50|$|In England {{during the}} latter part of the 17th century several postmarks were devised for use with the London Penny Post, a postal system that {{delivered}} <b>mailed</b> <b>items</b> within the city of London. The postmarks bore the initial of the particular post office or handling house it was sent from along with a separate time stamp. Postage was prepaid and the postmark was applied to the <b>mailed</b> <b>item</b> by means of an inked hand-stamp. Some historians also consider these postmarks to be the world's first postage 'stamps'.|$|R
25|$|In 1680 William Dockwra, an English {{merchant}} in London, and {{his partner}} Robert Murray established the London Penny Post, a mail system that delivered letters and small parcels inside the city of London for the sum of one penny. The postage for the <b>mailed</b> <b>item</b> was prepaid {{by the use of}} a hand-stamp to frank the <b>mailed</b> <b>item,</b> confirming payment of postage. Though this 'stamp' was applied to a letter instead of a separate piece of paper it is considered by many historians as the world's first postage stamp.|$|R
50|$|The 'M' in EPPML {{stands for}} Model. EPPML {{was defined by}} its authors {{as a model for}} the {{interaction}} between parties that create, publish, consume or deliver postal products. The interactions defined by the model include actions on physical items, information exchanges and financial transactions. The typical action on a physical item is a change of location (e.g. delivery). The information exchanges may use either electronic channels (e.g. web services, email) or physical channels (e.g. bar codes printed on <b>mail</b> <b>items</b> by mailers and read posts). An example of a financial transaction is a refund for late delivery of a <b>mail</b> <b>item.</b>|$|R

5000|$|With {{the start}} of {{development}} programs in Bhutan {{and the end of}} its self-imposed isolation in the late 1950s and early 1960s, there was a sizeable increase of correspondence in English and the number of <b>mail</b> <b>items,</b> now also including Indian newspapers and periodicals for the staff managing schools and development projects. The Dzong mail service was not able to cope with the significant increase of <b>mail</b> <b>items</b> and its staff could in general not read English. In the first Five Year Plan launched in 1961 the set-up of a postal service was among the proposed development activities. A Posts & Telegraphs Department was established under the Ministry of Communications and the first regular post office was opened in the border town of Phuentsholing on 10 October 1962, when also the first postage stamps were issued.
