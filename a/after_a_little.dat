5|$|A Fresh Start is a 1910 American silent short drama {{produced}} by the Thanhouser Company. The film {{is the story of}} Jim, a chauffeur, who is fired from his job for drunkenness. Jim becomes a tramp, but decides to reform <b>after</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> girl orders her butler to give him food. He encounters her again at the zoo and notices that two men are following the girl and her parents. Jim uncovers a plot to kidnap her and takes the place of their chauffeur. Jim then drives the kidnappers to the police station and secures a new position as the family's chauffeur. According to a trade review, the actual kidnapping scene and where Jim overpowers the villain's chauffeur is not actually depicted. The reviewer also stated the strength of the production is not in the plot, but in the staging and photography. The film was released on September 2, 1910, and it likely had a wide national release. The film is presumed lost.|$|E

5|$|Qualifying was {{scheduled}} to consist of three parts, 18, 15 and 12 minutes in length respectively, with five drivers eliminated from competing after {{each of the first}} two sessions. The first part of qualifying (Q1) was disrupted <b>after</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> more than five minutes, when Sainz crashed at turn four, bringing out red flags. Due to the prospect of worsening rain and the chance that qualifying could be brought to an end by the weather at any point, the teams fought for grid positions early on, with Lewis Hamilton, Nico Rosberg and Daniel Ricciardo setting the fastest times. Apart from Sainz, both Manor Marussia drivers were eliminated, along with the two Sauber cars of Marcus Ericsson and Felipe Nasr. Sebastian Vettel, after making contact with a barrier, finished Q1 in fifteenth place, barely making it into Q2.|$|E
5|$|The {{towns of}} Gonzales and San Felipe de Austin were burned {{to keep them}} out of the hands of the Mexican army. Santa Anna was intent on {{executing}} members of the Republic's interim government, who fled from Washington-on-the-Brazos to Groce's Landing to Harrisburg and New Washington. The government officials eventually escaped to Galveston Island, and Santa Anna burned the towns of Harrisburg and New Washington when he failed to find them. Approximately 5,000 terrified residents of New Washington fled from the Mexican army. <b>After</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> over a month of training the troops, Houston reached a crossroads where he ordered some of them to escort the fleeing refugees farther east while he took the main army southeast to engage the Mexican army.

25|$|During {{the last}} quarter of the eighteenth century, it became fashionable to view art {{galleries}} at night by torchlight. Canova was an artist that leapt on the fad and displayed his works of art in his studio by candlelight. As such, Canova would begin to finalize the statue with special tools by candlelight, to soften the transitions between the various parts of the nude. <b>After</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> recarving, he began to rub the statue down with pumice stone, sometimes for period longer that weeks or months. If that was not enough, he would use tripoli (rottenstone) and lead.|$|E

25|$|With Dylan, the Hawks {{played a}} series of concerts from September 1965 through May 1966, billed as Bob Dylan and the Band. The tours were marked by Dylan's {{reportedly}} copious use of amphetamines. Some, though not all, of the Hawks joined in the excesses. Most of the concerts were met with heckling and disapproval from folk music purists. Helm was so affected by the negative reception that he left the tour <b>after</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> more than one month and sat {{out the rest of}} that year's concerts, as well as the world tour in 1966.

25|$|The Augustus was {{retired from}} service in January 1976. On January 15, 1976, she was laid up in Naples. She {{was sold to}} Hong Kong and was renamed Great Sea. <b>After</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> use, she was renamed Ocean King in 1980. And in 1983, she was renamed Philippines. At that time, she served as an {{accommodation}} ship in Manila. She was renamed President in 1985. However, she was laid up in Kaohsiung, and in 1987, she was renamed Asian Princess and in 1997, she was moved to Subic Bay, where she was converted into cruising. However, the ship has failed in making money in this venture. Then she was moved and place at anchorage off Manila. She was dry-docked at Subic Bay in mid-1998, and in February 1999, she returned to Manila, where she was refitted {{for use as a}} floating hotel and restaurant venue as originally planned.|$|E
25|$|The {{export of}} etrogs {{cultivated}} in Eretz Yisrael {{was also a}} {{source of income for}} the Old Yishuv. This predated the Hovevei Zion idea of the return to the land and Jewish farming, prior to which citrons for use on the Sukkot holiday were cultivated exclusively by Arab peasants and then merchandized by the Jews. According to Jacob Saphir, the etrog business was monopolized by the Sephardic kollel even before 1835. They had contracted with the Arabic growers of Umm al-Fahm for their entire progeny of Balady citron. In the 1840s they were also the instrumental in the introduction of the Greek citron which was already cultivated in Jewish owned farms. In the 1870s the Sephardim switched to the Greek variety, and the Ashkenazi Salant partners took over the Balady business. <b>After</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> while, controversy erupted regarding its Kashrut status. Rabbi Chaim Elozor Wax, president of Kupat Rabbi Meir Baal HaNes Kollel Polen of Warsaw, was instrumental in making the Israeli-grown etrogim saleable in Ashkenazi Jewish communities in Europe. He planted thousands of trees in a donated orchard near Tiberias, and turned the proceeds over to the Warsaw Kollel.|$|E

25|$|Early on {{the morning}} of June 29, 1659, Vyhovsky {{at the head of a}} small {{detachment}} attacked Prince Pozharsky's army. <b>After</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> skirmish, he started to retreat, feigning a disorganized flight in the direction of his main forces. The unsuspecting Pozharsky ordered his army to pursue the enemy. Once the enemy's army entered Sosnivka, the Cossacks fired three cannon shots to give the signal to the Tatars and counterattacked with all the forces stationed at Sosnivka. Having discovered the trap, Prince Semen Pozharsky ordered retreat; but his heavy cavalry got bogged down in the soggy ground created from the flooding the night before. At this moment the Tatars also advanced from the eastern flank, and the outright slaughter ensued. Almost all troops perished, with few of them captured alive. Among the captured were Prince Semen Romanovich Pozharsky himself, Prince Semen Petrovich Lvov, both Princes Buturlins, Prince Lyapunov, Prince Skuratov, Prince Kurakin and others. A relative of the Great Liberator of Moscow from the Poles, Dmitry Pozharsky, Prince Semen Romanovich Pozharsky was brought before the Khan of Crimea Mehmed IV Giray. Being forced to carry out acts of submissiveness Pozharsky insulted the Khan and spat in his face. For that he was promptly beheaded by the Tatars, and his severed head was dispatched with one of the captives to Prince Trubetskoy's camp.|$|E
25|$|Despite {{the poor}} {{economic}} times, the railroad's management remained confident. On May 10, 1894, the directors approved {{the extension of}} the main line from Struble to Pine Grove Mills. Such an extension had been contemplated as long ago as 1884, during the BRB era. While Pine Grove Mills would originate some traffic through farming and logging, the extension was primarily contemplated {{as part of a larger}} route. By extending south from Pine Grove Mills to Huntingdon, the line could connect with the Huntingdon and Broad Top Mountain Railroad, an independent railroad serving the Broad Top coal region. By linking to the Central Railroad of Pennsylvania at Bellefonte (built in 1893 over the contemplated Nittany Valley & Southern route), the Bellefonte Central could form part of a coal route tapping the Broad Top field on behalf of the New York Central. However, the route faced a formidable obstacle in the crossing of Tussey Mountain. Such a line would require switchbacks or a long summit tunnel. The Pennsylvania Railroad already occupied the only usable gap at Spruce Creek and would not look favorably on its new competitor for the Broad Top traffic. However, the economy remained slow, and the railroad found it difficult to obtain land at favorable prices. <b>After</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> grading, the project stalled until 1896, when the railroad lifted the rail from the derelict Red Bank Branch west of Graysdale and used it to lay track on the extension. Service on the extension opened to Bloomsdorf in September 1896 and to Pine Grove Mills in December. Despite a $75,000 subscription offered by the town of Stone Valley (now submerged under Lake Perez) to complete the extension to Huntingdon, the expense of further extension would clearly have outstripped the railroad's finances. The Bellefonte Central undertook no further construction towards Huntingdon.|$|E
25|$|The first close combat {{commenced}} in the 74th Battalion's northernmost sector, {{against the}} Moroccan Brigade of thirty tanks. One Israeli Centurion was hit, and an Israeli platoon {{that was sent}} northward to guard the Dan Road was caught between the Moroccans moving against Tel Shaeta and a Syrian battalion closing in from the west. Avner Landau's company, now with seven Centurions, was also threatened and could not help. Nafshi delegated the area north of Hermonit to his deputy, Major Yosef Nissim, and reinforced the sector with Captain Eyal Shaham's company, leaving a company from the Armor School Tank Battalion as a tactical reserve. In forty minutes, every Barak Brigade Centurion in the northern Golan was committed. Nissim ordered Shaham to reinforce the trapped platoon around Tel Shaeta, and ordered his deputy, Lieutenant Asaf Sela, to cover the area south of Tel Shaeta, which could provide easy access to Hermonit, with one platoon. The Moroccans continued to fire at Tel Shaeta, but did not advance, and the Syrian battalion was stopped when its leading vehicles were destroyed on the roadway. The Syrian battalion commander decided to move southward and try to penetrate between the Dan Road and Hermonit. He was unaware that he was moving between the forces of Shaham and Sela, who prepared a trap. They opened fire just before 15:00, using superior positions. <b>After</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> more than two hours, the Syrians withdrew, leaving behind their bridging tanks, a bulldozer tank, two BRDMs and six main battle tanks. Shaham's company lost two Centurions. Just before nightfall, Shaham noticed three SU-100 gun carriers and a truck close to Nissim's position, from which Nissim could not engage them. Shaham directed Sela, who {{could not see the}} Syrians, to intercept them. Sela, accompanied by one other Centurion, opened fire {{at the rear of the}} Syrian force and destroyed them at a range of 200 to 300 meters. Two Syrian tanks to cross the open ground to the anti-tank ditch in the unguarded area south of Nissim's sector. The Syrian companies began moving toward that area, hoping to cross just before nightfall. As darkness fell, Nafshi ordered one company to move forward towards the Syrian bridges across the ditch to destroy the tanks that had crossed. The Syrian company that crossed was hit by Landau's tanks and destroyed after half an hour. The bridgehead was sealed.|$|E
