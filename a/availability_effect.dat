40|$|Contemporary {{research}} documents various psychological {{aspects of}} economic decision-making. The main goal {{of our study}} is to analyze {{the role of the}} availability heuristic (Tversky and Kahneman, 1973, 1974) in financial markets. The availability heuristic refers to people's tendency to determine the likelihood of an event according to the easiness of recalling similar instances, and, thus, to overweight current information, as opposed to processing all relevant information. We define and test two aspects of the availability heuristic which we dub outcome- and risk-availability. The former deals with the availability of positive and negative investment outcomes, and the latter-with the availability of financial risk. We test the <b>availability</b> <b>effect</b> on investors ’ reactions to analyst recommendation revisions. Employing daily market returns as a proxy for outcome availability, we find that positive stock price reactions to recommendation upgrades are stronger when accompanied by positive stock market index returns, and negative stock price reactions to recommendation downgrades are stronger when accompanied by negative stock market index returns. The magnitude of the outcome <b>availability</b> <b>effect</b> is negatively correlated with the firms' market capitalization, and positively correlated with stock beta, as well as with historical retur...|$|E

Regardless of the level of aggregation, a positive effect is found of bed supply on length of hospital stay but not on admission rates.

Both the {{quantitative and qualitative}} analysis show how the low levels of agricultural productivity in this area {{may be linked to}} material and climatic factors. The quantitative analysis is mainly focused on physical factors. The qualitative analysis, however, emphasises that relative inefficiency of agricultural activity in Cholistan reflects the influence of physical, economic, social and, most importantly, climatic factors. The quantitative findings provide valuable insight into various ‘sources of productivity’ in terms of acreage effect, capital input effect and irrigation water <b>availability</b> <b>effect.</b> The size of the positive and significant coefficients on these variables suggest the extent to which one or the other variable effect is prominent in improving the crop yield.

40|$|Background: General Practitioners {{have limited}} means to compete. As quality {{is hard to}} observe by patients, GPs have {{incentives}} to signal quality by using instruments patients perceive as quality. Objectives: We investigate whether GPs exhibit different prescribing behavior (volume and value of prescriptions) when confronted with more competition. As there is no monetary benefit in doing so, this type of (perceived) quality competition originates from GPs satisfying patients’ expectations. Method: We look at market level data on per capita and per contact number of items prescribed by GPs {{and the value of}} prescriptions for the Belgian market of General Practitioners. We test to which extent different types of variables explain the observed variation. We consider patient characteristics, GP characteristics, number and type of GP contacts and the level of competition. The level of competition is measured by GP density, after controlling for the number of GPs and a HHI. Results: We find that a higher number of GPs per capita results in a higher number of units prescribed by GPs, both per capita and per contact. We argue that this is consistent with quality competition in the GP market.

40|$|Three studies {{explored}} how {{the influence}} of the 'availability heuristic' on frequency judgement is mediated and moderated by the perceived meaning of the task, the perceived relevance of information for the task, and the salience of differential memorability of information. All studies adapted the famous names' paradigm (Tversky and Kahneman, 1973) in which subjects are required to listen to a list of names of known personalities of both sexes and then judge the frequency of men and women. The availability heuristic (Tversky and Kahneman, 1973) posits that classes whose instances are easy to imagine or recall will be perceived as relatively frequent, so that when names of one sex are more famous and thus memorable this category will be rated as more numerous even when it occurs less frequently. Consistent with the notion that the use of availability is sensitive to task interpretation, we showed that the <b>availability</b> <b>effect</b> is eliminated over successive trials (Study 1) and moderated when task instructions render different categories salient (Study 2). In the third study if is shown that conditions which facilitate awareness of the biasing relationship between gender and frame (memorability), decrease the use of the availability heuristic by moderating frequency estimates of the more famous category.

A laboratory experiment to study the effect of amelioration and K fertilization on K Q-I parameters was carried out on three soil families of acid upland mineral soil from Cigudeg, Kentrong, and Papanrejo. The experiment was arranged using completely randomized design with 2 factors. The first factor was three kinds of ameliorant and the second factor was three levels of K fertilization. The result suggested that amelioration with dolomite and steel slag increased K buffering capacity (PBCK) due {{to the increase in}} cation exchange capacity (CEC) and Ca and Mg concentration of the soil solution. Conversely, amelioration decreased equilibrium activity ratio of K (ARKe) due to alteration of K-Ca–Mg equilibrium. Amelioration, however, did not affect labile-K, except for Cigudeg soil.

40|$|Economic and {{financial}} developments on the Mainland {{have important implications}} for Hong Kong. This paper presents an empirical framework for assessing monetary {{and financial}} conditions on the Mainland by estimating a monetary conditions index (MCI). An MCI is usually defined as a weighted sum of some measures of real interest rate and the real effective exchange rate (REER). Because bank credit is an important channel of monetary policy transmission mechanism in Mainland China, this study extends the conventional MCI by including a quantity variable to capture the credit <b>availability</b> <b>effect.</b> Estimates suggest that, in terms of the effect on real GDP growth, a rise in real interest rates by 1 percentage point is equivalent to an increase in REER appreciation by about 4 percentage points or a fall in real credit growth by 2. 5 percentage points. The estimated MCI suggests a sharp easing in monetary conditions in 2002 - 2003, reflecting a weaker US dollar, relaxed credit stance of banks, and easing of deflation which reduced real interest rates. The fall in the MCI is equivalent to a decline of about 10 percentage points in real interest rates during the period. Easy monetary conditions have contributed to an acceleration in economic growth since 2002. Fears of overheating pressures prompted the authorities to implement administrative measures in early 2004 to curb credit supply to selected sectors and raise interest rates in late October 2004. The estimated MCI suggests that the tightening of monetary conditions is equivalent to a rise in real interest rates by about 4. 6 percentage points. ...|$|E

The study presented here shows, for the first time, the performance, under field conditions of the new tritordeum species, compared to wheat and triticale {{in a wide range}} of Mediterranean countries (Spain, Lebanon and Tunisia). The results obtained revealed that despite the diversity of environmental conditions, the main differences in yield were due to genotypes, especially to differences between species. The multi-local study with different growth conditions revealed important information about the water <b>availability</b> <b>effect</b> on yield. In the lowest yielding environments (Tunisia rainfed), Tritordeum and triticale yields were equivalent. However under better growth conditions (Spain), tritordeum yield was shown to be lower than wheat and triticale. Interestingly, when water limitation was extended during the pre-anthesis period, differences in tritordeum versus wheat-triticale yield rate were larger than when water stress occurred during anthesis. These variations were explained by the fact that kernel weight has been found as the limiting factor for yield determination in tritordeum, and a delay in the anthesis date may have been the cause for the low kernel weight and low yield under Mediterranean drought conditions. Such differences in yield between tritordeum and wheat or triticale could be explained by the fact that tritordeum is a relatively new species and far fewer resources have been devoted to its improvement when compared to wheat and triticale. Our results suggest that breeding efforts should be directed to an earlier anthesis date and a longer grain filling period. Tritordeum proved to have possibilities to be grown under drought environments as a new crop, since its performance was quite close to wheat and triticale. Besides, it has qualitative added values that may improve farmers’ income per unit land. This work was funded by CICYT project AGL 2005 - 07257 -C 04.

40|$|Ceramide- 1 -phosphate (C 1 P) is a {{bioactive}} lipid {{that has}} been implicated in many biological processes. Our laboratory has conclusively demonstrated its role in inflammation via activation of cPLA 2 α. The only known enzyme to date responsible for direct synthesis of C 1 P is ceramide kinase. Very little was known about this enzyme {{in terms of its}} enzyme kinetics and substrate specificity. As CERK is an enzyme that acts on membrane lipids, its kinetics cannot be studied using standard bulk dilutions methods. Thus we developed a surface dilution approach using Triton X 100 mixed micelles for studying the kinetics of CERK. We discovered that ceramide kinase has an affinity for naturally occurring long chain ceramides while ceramides containing shorter than 8 carbons are very poor substrates for the enzyme. Also of note is the discovery that there is no discrimination between the naturally occurring long chain ceramides leading {{to the conclusion that the}} preponderance of D-e-C 16 C 1 P in cells are due to an <b>availability</b> <b>effect.</b> We also investigated the chain length specificity of interaction between C 1 P and cPLA 2 α. Our data indicate that cPLA 2 α is activated by C 1 P’s containing acyl chains longer than two carbons. The study showed C 2 C 1 P as being unable to activate cPLA 2 α thus establishing a tool for the investigation of cPLA 2 α dependent and independent effects of C 1 P. In the course of the study we investigated the ethanol/dodecane delivery system as a means of safely delivering lipids to cells. Our data conclusively demonstrate that this delivery system successfully delivers lipids to the internal membranes where their biological action takes place and that at low lipid concentration (3 ̆c 1 µM), is non toxic to cells. A significant technical hurdle in the study of C 1 P was the lack of accurate and reproducible method of quantitatively and qualitatively analyzing the lipid. Using a mass spectrometric approach we developed an accurate technique that now allows us to quantify the lipids in cells. Using this and radiolabeling studies we discovered evidence for production of C 1 P from S 1 P via an acyl transferase pathway. Further studies are currently being carried out to identify the enzyme/s responsible for this pathway...|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} of this thesis {{is to examine the}} relationship between interest rates, saving through the banking sector, credit from banks, and private investment using the financial deregulation hypothesis and the determinants of the probability of banking fragility for the Indonesian case. Some of the financial deregulation hypothesis related to those variables and the determinants of the likelihood of banking fragility has been tested using cross country data, but only a few studies have been performed using country specific data and there is no study for the particulars of the Indonesian case. Therefore, this study is intended to fill those gaps and add to the literature on the links between financial deregulation, banking intermediation, and banking fragility in the Indonesian economy. Moreover, this study will add the additional credit fiinctions associated with state banks and national private banks and add additional variables to the credit fiinction to consider specific issues associated with the Indonesian financial sector such as borrowing from Bank Indonesia. In addition, this study covers the 1997 financial and banking crises period, therefore this study will use a unit root test to consider the possibility of the presence of a structural break associated with the 1997 financial and banking crises for variables most relevant to the monetary and banking sectors in Indonesia. To investigate the relationship between interest rates, saving through the banking sector, credit from banks and private investinent using the financial deregulation hypothesis, it is hypothesised that real interest rates will encourage saving through the banking sector. Furthermore, it is hypothesised that credit from banks plays important role as a channel between saving through the banking sector and private investinent. It implies that financial deregulation contributed to increasing private investment through the availability of credit from banks and in turn it contributed to increasing economic growth. This hypothesis is in line with Shaw 2 ̆ 7 s views on debt intermediation. However, private investment is also hypothesised to be related to net capital flows of the private sector which essentially were foreign borrowings. Therefore, it suggests that private investment is not only financed by domestic banks but also by foreign borrowing. If most of the foreign borrowing is unhedged, a sudden large depreciation of the domestic currency will reduce the net worth of the borrower, which in tiim, will contribute to increasing banking problems. The problem in the banking sector, however, is often associated with other factors. Therefore, it is hypothesised that the probability of banking fragility is influenced by three groups of variables namely financial deregulation variables, macroeconomic variables, and group bank specific variables. This thesis found that positive real interest rates significantly affect real saving through the banking sector and that real saving after being reduced by the minimum reserve requirement is positive and significantly affects real credit from the banking sector in the long run. Real credit from the banking sector is also positively affected by borrowing from Bank Indonesia. Moreover, real credit from the banking sector positively and significantly affects real private investment and real private investment is also positive and significantly related to net capital flows of the private sector in the long run. This finding supports the evidence that real private investment was associated with credit from the banking sector and net capital flows of the private sector. By examining the impact of real interest rates on real saving through the banking sector, real saving through the banking sector adjusted for minimum reserves on real credit from the banking sector, and real credit from the banking sector on real private investment, there is evidence that an increase in real interest rates accompanied by a credible financial policy is associated with an increase in real private investment through the credit <b>availability</b> <b>effect</b> at least up to the second quarter of 1997. This finding is consistent with Shaw 2 ̆ 7 s views on debt intermediation, which are that an increase in banking intermediation contributes to increased private investment. An increase in banking intermediation which is indicated by increased credit to the private sector, however, is also often associated with an increased probability of banking fragility. This thesis found that the probability of banking fragility in Indonesia is significanfly related to financial deregulation variables and group bank specific variables for both the sample periods 1986 : 3 - 1997 : 2 and 1986 : 3 1999 : 2. On the other hand, macroeconomic variables are not significant in influencing the probability of banking fragility for the sample period 1986 : 3 - 1997 : 2, but are significanfly related to the probability of banking fragility for the sample period 1986 : 3 - 1999 : 2...|$|E
40|$|Kinleith Forest is a P. radiata {{dominated}} plantation forest {{situated on}} the edge of the Taupo Volcanic Zone in the central North Island, New Zealand. Approximately 35 000 ha of the forest is {{situated on the}} southern Mamaku Plateau. The aim of this study was to determine the spatial structure of soil variability and integrate an analysis of the growth, productivity and nutrient variables for P. radiata to ascertain the detail of soil information appropriate for plantation forestry. A land systems approach, using generic and specific soil-landscape models and hierarchical landscape analysis, provides the framework for soil mapping. The approach is scale-flexible and lends itself to implementation of site specific forest soil, nutrient and health management practices. The southern Mamaku Plateau consists of five superimposed Late Quaternary welded ignimbrites with the Mamaku Ignimbrite (c. 220 ± 10 ka) being the uppermost. Aeolian coverbeds consisting of predominantly loess and rhyolitic tephras mantle erosional surfaces formed in ignimbrite bedrock. Four episodes of strath cutting and valley incision into ignimbrite are recognised from the sequence of overlying loess and tephra coverbeds. The basal loess and/or tephra on the erosion surfaces denoting the cessation of each episode of strath cutting and valley incision are: (a) pre-Rotoehu loess, (b) pre-Kawakawa loess, (c) Rotorua Tephra, and (d) Taupo Ignimbrite. The four episodes of strath cutting and valley incision can be synthesised into five topographically recognised stages of landform evolution. Landform evolution stage (I) is represented on the upper Mamaku terrain and stage (V) on the lower Mamaku terrain. In a revised coverbed distribution model the oldest coverbed sequence is recognised on hill and terrace land components on the upper and lower Mamaku terrain. The coverbed stratigraphy together with its soil stratigraphic interpretation and soil-landform relationships has been used to map nine land systems. Soil-landscape relationships and forest variability are described and analysed within the U 3 complex land system. The U 3 complex land system comprises Oruanui and Mamaku simple land systems, each with a common recurring pattern of hillock, ridge, flat and ravine land components, situated on the upper Mamaku terrain. Soil and regolith variables were partitioned at progressively finer levels of hierarchical landscape subdivision to ascertain spatial variability structure. Taupo Ignimbrite thickness, topographically controlled over short range (10 s of metres), and a rainfall (leaching) gradient over a longer range (1000 s of metres) were identified as the main factors controlling soil variability. Land components within simple land systems effectively represented the variability. Simple and composite soils formed in Taupo Ignimbrite veneer deposits over yellowish-brown beds (collectively < 2. 5 m thick) dominate the U 3 complex land system, with soils showing varying expression of podzolisation. The structure of spatial variability of foliar nutrient concentration differs between foliar nutrients N, P, Mg, K and B. Complex land system for foliar N, P, Mg and K, and simple land system for foliar B were appropriate grainsize for amelioration purposes. Within U 3, foliar P was deficient and foliar Mg was marginal with a high probability of deficiency. Forest productivity was measured using site index, basal area index and volume index. Basal area index was the most effective indicator of forest productivity variability. Spatial variability was best partitioned by land components. Spatial variability of foliar nutrients and forest productivity indices were not structured in the same way, indicating a weak correlation between foliar nutrient variables and forest productivity. The relationships between P. radiata and soil chemical properties were established by a pot trial for soils on the flats within U 3. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) identified the main effects on P. radiata shoot growth and nutrient uptake as nutrient availability, P sorption and Mg inhibition. Podzolisation, although evident in the soil morphology, was not shown to significantly influence shoot variables. Shoot dry weight and height were significantly greater for seedlings grown in A horizons compared to seedlings grown in the Bw and BC horizons in Taupo Ignimbrite and buried Bw horizons in yellowish-brown beds. The nutrient <b>availability</b> <b>effect</b> was most apparent in A horizons, while the Mg inhibiting effect and P sorption effect were responsible for limiting shoot growth in the Taupo Ignimbrite and yellowish-brown beds respectively. A nutrient availability index (NAI), developed from the pot trial and soil horizon stratigraphy, was calculated for hillock and flat land components in the Oruanui and Mamaku land systems. Poor correlation between NAI and site productivity (basal area index) reaffirmed the influence of non-soil related factors on forest productivity variability. The land systems approach effectively partitioned soil and forest spatial variability at different levels of resolution. However, soil and soil-induced forest variability are not strong because of the homogenising effects of widespread aeolian (including pyroclastic) coverbeds. Implementing a scale-flexible mapping approach, such as land systems, would provide a basis for improved inventory data collection, and management of forest soils, nutrients and health in Kinleith Forest...|$|E

The study reveals that trade liberalization and facilitation generates substantial economic benefits and enhances economic growth and welfare in the Nile basin. The effect of instituting a free trade policy on water savings is found to be limited, while climate change improves water supply and hence irrigation water use, enhancing economic growth and welfare in the basin...|$|R

40|$|Mestrado Vinifera EuroMaster - Instituto Superior de AgronomiaThe main {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to determine how water <b>availability</b> <b>effected</b> the composition of both the grape berry and the skin cell wall of two Portuguese grape varieties, Touriga Nacional and Trincadeira. Different vines situated in the Centro Experimental de Pegões, 70 Km East from Lisbon, Portugal, were subjected to Nonirrigated (NI, no water applied) and Fully-irrigated (FI, 100 % of evapotranspiration rate) treatments throughout the growing season for each variety. Berries were harvested and sampled on 20 th September 2010 from the four plots and the yield and quality parameters were tested. Differences between the treatments were noted with grapes from irrigated plants showing significantly higher berry weight, and volume. Whereas the non-irrigated berries showed higher levels of anthocyanin content, colour intensity, total phenolics and total acidity, than the fully irrigated. There were also differences noted between varieties in several parameters, mainly with Touriga Nacional showing a higher content in the phenolic compound...|$|R
40|$|There {{is little}} {{consensus}} {{as to why}} {{there is so much}} variation in the rates at which different species’ geographic ranges expand in response to climate warming. Here we show that the relative importance of species’ abundance trends and habitat availability for British butterfly species vary over time. Species with high habitat availability expanded more rapidly from the 1970 s to mid- 1990 s, when abundances were generally stable, whereas habitat <b>availability</b> <b>effects</b> were confined to the subset of species with stable abundances from the mid- 1990 s to 2009, when abundance trends were generally declining. This suggests that stable (or positive) abundance trends are a prerequisite for range expansion. Given that species’ abundance trends vary over time for non-climatic as well as climatic reasons, assessment of abundance trends will help improve predictions of species’ responses to climate change, and help us to understand the likely success of different conservation strategies for facilitating their expansions...|$|R
40|$|Mutator strains are {{expected}} to evolve when the <b>availability</b> and <b>effect</b> of beneficial mutations are high enough to counteract the disadvantage from deleterious mutations that will inevitably accumulate. As the population becomes more adapted to its environment, both <b>availability</b> and <b>effect</b> of beneficial mutations necessarily decrease and mutation rates are predicted to decrease. It {{has been shown that}} certain molecular mechanisms can lead to increased mutation rates when the organism finds itself in a stressful environment. While this may be a correlated response to other functions, it could also be an adaptive mechanism, raising mutation rates only when it is most advantageous. Here, we use a mathematical model to investigate the plausibility of the adaptive hypothesis. We show that such a mechanism can be mantained if the population is subjected to diverse stresses. By simulating various antibiotic treatment schemes, we find that combination treatments can reduce the effectiveness of second-order selection on stress-induced mutagenesis. We discuss the implications of our results to strategies of antibiotic therapy...|$|R
