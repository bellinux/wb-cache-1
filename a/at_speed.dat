5|$|A few {{deductions}} {{can also}} be made from the satellite communications. The first deduction {{that can be made}} from the satellite communications is that the aircraft remained operational until at least 08:19—seven hours after final contact was made with air traffic control over the South China Sea. The varying BFO values indicate the aircraft was moving <b>at</b> <b>speed.</b> The aircraft's SDU needs location and track information to keep its antenna pointed towards the satellite, so it {{can also be}} deduced that the aircraft's navigation system was operational.|$|E

5|$|Historically, Salukis {{were used}} for hunting by nomadic tribes. Typical quarry {{included}} the gazelle, hare, fox and jackal. While hunting hares, Bedouin hunters would sometimes ride close to their quarry on a camel holding a Saluki, which would be thrown towards the prey while <b>at</b> <b>speed</b> to give the dog a running start. Gazelle hunters also used hawks to gouge out {{the eyes of the}} prey so that a Saluki could then bring down the blinded animal.|$|E
50|$|Megalon is 55 meters (180 feet) {{tall and}} weighs 40,000 metric tons (44,092 short tons). Megalon can fly <b>at</b> <b>speeds</b> {{of up to}} Mach 3, burrow {{underground}} <b>at</b> <b>speeds</b> of up to Mach 2, and swim <b>at</b> <b>speeds</b> of up to Mach 4.|$|R
50|$|In China, {{high-speed}} lines <b>at</b> <b>speeds</b> between 200 and 250 km/h {{may carry}} freight or passengers. While lines operating <b>at</b> <b>speeds</b> over 300 km/h are used only by passenger CRH trains.|$|R
50|$|It {{has been}} tested <b>at</b> <b>speeds</b> of up to 193 km/h, its rubber tires prevent it from {{performing}} reliably <b>at</b> these <b>speeds,</b> so engineers capped the <b>speed</b> <b>at</b> 172 km/h.|$|R
5|$|Muirhead-Gould {{gave the}} general alarm, along with orders for ships to take anti-submarine measures, at 22:27; the alarm was {{repeated}} at 22:36 with advice for ships to take precautions against attack, {{as an enemy}} submarine {{might be in the}} harbour. At {{the time of the first}} alarm, Sydney Harbour was closed to external traffic, but Muirhead-Gould ordered ferries and other internal traffic to continue, as he believed that having multiple ships travelling around <b>at</b> <b>speed</b> would help force any submarines to remain submerged.|$|E
5|$|Official {{interest}} in Hurst Castle increased {{again in the}} 1840s, as the introduction of shell guns and steam ships created a new risk that the French might successfully attack along the south coast. Previously, sailing ships had been only able to pass the castle slowly when moving against the tide, making them vulnerable to its guns; steam ships threatened to cruise past <b>at</b> <b>speed.</b> Military estimates and surveys in 1850 and 1851 suggested that the armament should therefore be significantly increased, to include more and much heavier guns.|$|E
5|$|The England manager {{may also}} involve himself in wider issues beyond the on-the-field team issues. The England manager is {{expected}} to advise the FA on how to approach the complex bidding system that surrounds the arrangement of fixtures for a qualifying campaign. On a more tactical level, {{a host of other}} details can be influenced; Capello is even believed to have instructed the Wembley ball boys to return balls <b>at</b> <b>speed</b> when they go out of play.|$|E
50|$|A {{small amount}} of {{over-speed}} allowance is made before the train's emergency brakes are applied. <b>At</b> <b>speeds</b> below 80 km/h, the allowance is five kilometres per hour. <b>At</b> nominal <b>speeds</b> of 80-160 km/h, the tolerance is ten kilometres per hour and <b>at</b> <b>speeds</b> in excess of 160 km/h, it is fifteen kilometres per hour.|$|R
25|$|Humans {{are capable}} of walking <b>at</b> <b>speeds</b> faster than 2.0m/s, and capable of running <b>at</b> <b>speeds</b> slower than 2.0m/s. As humans can walk or run at the same pace, {{researchers}} have attempted to explain why humans choose the transition speed that they do.|$|R
50|$|As of 2010, {{gasoline}} radio-controlled model boating {{has grown}} worldwide. The industry has spawned many manufacturers {{and thousands of}} model boaters. Today the average gasoline-powered boat can easily run <b>at</b> <b>speeds</b> over 45 mph, with the more exotic gas boats running <b>at</b> <b>speeds</b> exceeding 90 mph.|$|R
5|$|With unarticulated wheels, {{climbing}} obstacles {{will cause}} {{the body of a}} vehicle to tilt. If the vehicle's center of mass moves outside of the wheelbase or axle track, the vehicle will become statically unstable, and will tend to tip over. <b>At</b> <b>speed,</b> a vehicle can become dynamically unstable, meaning that it can be tipped over by an obstacle smaller than its static stability limit, or by excessive acceleration or tight turning. Without articulation, this can be an impossible position from which to recover.|$|E
5|$|As the TR-1 engines {{originally}} {{intended for the}} Su-9 were not yet ready for flight testing in late 1945, Pavel Sukhoi suggested substituting a pair of Jumo 004 engines and this was approved on 15 December. The full-scale mockup {{was found to be}} acceptable on 16 February 1946 and the Council of People's Commissars issued an order on 26 February that the manufacturer's flight testing was to begin on 1 November. This goal was not met because the OKB was heavily committed to other projects like the trainer version of the Tupolev Tu-2 bomber, inexperience with JATO units, and late delivery of RD-10 engines. The first prototype was completed in mid-October and made its first flight on 13 November. The test pilots found the aircraft easy to fly, but the control forces were very high <b>at</b> <b>speed</b> and it lacked enough directional stability. Enlarging the vertical stabilizer cured this last problem and hydraulic boosters were fitted for the control system.|$|E
5|$|Before he {{left for}} Cranfield Braham was {{involved}} in another car accident which removed him from duty. He was injured when the Austin 7 {{in which he was}} travelling left the road <b>at</b> <b>speed.</b> He had been on a night out celebrating his success. The five passengers (three officers and two girls) were all wounded, but one of the women later died in hospital. Once recovered Bob survived two scares on duty at Cranfield. On 13 March a Beaufighter's engines cut out forcing him to make an emergency landing, and on the same day, his second flight ended with the aircraft's engines catching fire. Braham managed to conduct a safe landing.|$|E
50|$|The 7701 communicated {{using the}} Synchronous transmit-receive (STR) {{communications}} protocol over either private or switched (message service) telephone lines. It operated <b>at</b> <b>speeds</b> of either 75 or 150 {{characters per second}} (cps). The 7702 operated <b>at</b> <b>speeds</b> of either 150, 250, or 300 characters per second.|$|R
5000|$|Fuzhou is {{a railway}} hub in {{northern}} Fujian. The Wenzhou-Fuzhou and Fuzhou-Xiamen Railways {{form part of}} the Southeast Coast High-Speed Rail Corridor and can accommodate high-speed trains <b>at</b> <b>speeds</b> of up to 250 km/h. The Hefei-Fuzhou High-Speed Railway links the city to Beijing through its nearby inner land province Jiangxi <b>at</b> <b>speeds</b> up to 350km/h.The Nanping-Fuzhou Railway and Xiangtang-Putian Railway provide rail access inland. The latter line can carry trains <b>at</b> <b>speeds</b> of 200 km/h. The regional Fuzhou-Mawei Cargo Railway runs from the Fuzhou Railway Station eastward to the port in Mawei District.|$|R
50|$|The orbiter's maximum glide ratio/lift-to-drag ratio varied {{considerably}} with speed, {{ranging from}} 1:1 <b>at</b> hypersonic <b>speeds,</b> 2:1 <b>at</b> supersonic <b>speeds,</b> and reaching 4.5:1 <b>at</b> subsonic <b>speeds</b> during approach and landing.|$|R
5|$|Commander Alfred Godsal led {{the assault}} in HMS Brilliant {{and it was}} he who {{stumbled}} into the most effective German counter-measure first. As Brilliant staggered through the murk, the lookout spotted the buoy ahead and Godsal headed directly for it, coming under even heavier fire as he did so. Passing the navigation marker <b>at</b> <b>speed,</b> the cruiser was suddenly brought to a halt with a juddering lurch, throwing men to the decks and sticking fast in deep mud well outside the harbour mouth. Before warnings could be relayed to the Sirius following up close behind, she too passed the buoy and her captain Lieutenant-Commander Henry Hardy was shocked to see Brilliant dead ahead. With no time to manoeuvree, Sirius ploughed into the port quarter of Brilliant, the blockships settling into the mud in a tangle of wreckage.|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{perceived}} conservatism, in 1963 Brabham {{was the first}} Formula One team to use a wind tunnel to hone their designs to reduce drag and stop the cars lifting off the ground <b>at</b> <b>speed.</b> The practice only became the norm in the early 1980s, and is possibly {{the most important factor}} in the design of modern cars. Towards the end of the 1960s, teams began to exploit aerodynamic downforce to push the cars' tyres down harder on the track and enable them to maintain faster speeds through high-speed corners. At the 1968 Belgian Grand Prix, Brabham were the first, alongside Ferrari, to introduce full width rear wings to this effect.|$|E
5|$|Hurst was {{equipped}} with new heavy, RML guns in heavily protected casemated positions. These weapons were slow to reload, so {{to ensure that the}} castle would {{have a good chance of}} hitting enemy ships passing <b>at</b> <b>speed,</b> two long batteries of weapons were built onto either side of the old castle, a west wing with 37 gun positions and an east wing with 24 positions. These were built on top of the two gun batteries constructed there a few years before and also required the castle's moat to be filled in. As work progressed, the decision was taken to reinforce the batteries with additional iron shields.|$|E
5000|$|A {{car crash}} {{can result from}} hitting rocks, drains, {{barriers}} and bridge supports <b>at</b> any <b>speed,</b> or from passing through roadworks on the Mulholland Drive track <b>at</b> <b>speeds</b> greater than 50 mph. Travelling too far up a sloped wall on the aqueduct track <b>at</b> high <b>speed</b> results in the car flipping over.|$|R
50|$|Two {{generation}}s of this chip were produced. The first generation (TM8600) was manufactured using a TSMC 0.13 micrometre process and produced <b>at</b> <b>speeds</b> up to 1.2 GHz. The second generation (TM8800 and TM8820) was manufactured using a Fujitsu 90 nm process and produced <b>at</b> <b>speeds</b> ranging from 1 GHz to 1.7 GHz.|$|R
5000|$|The EZ-232 RS232 Serial Interface {{provides}} a low-speed serial port for Commodore 8-bit computers. It can operate <b>at</b> <b>speeds</b> {{of up to}} 2400 bit/s, when configured as a standard interface, and <b>at</b> <b>speeds</b> of up to 9600 bit/s, when configured as a UP9600 interface. The EZ-232 RS232 Serial Interface was designed by Jim Brain.|$|R
5|$|It is {{not known}} who {{designed}} Deal Castle, but Sir Edward Ryngeley and Thomas Wingfield served as the commissioners for the project, with Robert Loyrde and David Marten as the paymaster and comptroller, and Christopher Dickenson and William Clement as the master mason and carpenters. Work began at Deal in April and progressed <b>at</b> <b>speed,</b> with 1,400 men {{at work on the}} site by the following month. A strike for higher pay was broken up over the summer by Ryngeley and by December, when Anne of Cleves dined there, the castle was mostly completed. Deal and the other fortifications along the Downs cost the Crown a total of £27,092 to build, much of which came from proceeds of the dissolution of the monasteries a few years before. Lead, timber and stone from local monasteries were also recycled for use in Deal Castle.|$|E
5|$|Scottie cramp is an {{autosomal}} recessive hereditary disorder which inhibits the dog's ability to walk. It {{is caused by}} a defect in the pathways in the brain that control muscle contraction due to a low level of serotonin in the body. Typically symptoms only show when the particular dog is under some degree of stress. The front legs are pushed out to the side, the back arches and the rear legs overflex, causing the dog to fall should they be moving <b>at</b> <b>speed.</b> The condition is not seizure related, and the dog remains conscious throughout the event, with symptoms abating once the cause of the stress has been removed.|$|E
5|$|Set in 2090, {{the game}} is centred on a fictional extreme racing sport known as Ballistics, a {{descendant}} of Formula One. The player takes {{the role of a}} Ballistic's pilot, racing hoverbikes called speeders through the inside of tubes which form the courses. The speeders are magnetically attached to the race surface, allowing the player 360 degrees of movement along the left/right axis. The player can detach the speeder from the track and navigate down the center in order to avoid track obstacles and to acquire the power-ups exclusively located there. Players must try to follow the outside of each curve, as hitting the inside of a curve <b>at</b> <b>speed</b> could lead to an involuntary detachment, leading to a loss of control and seconds dropped in securing reattachment.|$|E
50|$|Sea Eagle {{is powered}} by a licence-built, paraffin-fuelled Microturbo TRI 60 {{turbojet}} and cruises <b>at</b> <b>speeds</b> of Mach 0.85 (1,040 km/h, 645 mph) throughout its 110 kilometre (68 mile) plus range. It is capable of being carried <b>at</b> supersonic <b>speeds</b> by its parent aircraft, with launch <b>at</b> <b>speeds</b> of up to Mach 0.9 and a wide range of altitudes. Ejector launch, typically from a Type 119 Mk 5 ERU, with a pylon adapter where needed, is used.|$|R
50|$|German {{cars had}} a solenoid {{operated}} variable pressure windscreen wiper. It increases wiper blade pressure <b>at</b> <b>speeds</b> over 75 mph. This was {{to prevent the}} blades lifting off the screen <b>at</b> high <b>speed.</b>|$|R
50|$|In Norway, grade {{crossings}} are {{not permitted}} <b>at</b> <b>speeds</b> above 160 km/h.|$|R
5|$|The 2-6-4 wheel {{arrangement}} {{was not in}} common use in Great Britain at this time, as many railway companies operated routes that required locomotives with greater fuel capacity, or short branch lines that necessitated smaller locomotives. The 2-6-4 tank engine design had only been used once before for standard gauge locomotives in Britain, on the Great Central Railway's 1Bclass freight locomotives of 1914. However, the configuration was ideal for the SECR, because of its shorter mainlines, and allowed for a long wheelbase with a leading axle to permit greater stability <b>at</b> <b>speed</b> on track curves. The tightness of the curves on the former LCDR mainlines had constrained the size of locomotives operating on the SECR, {{as they had been}} hastily erected during the nineteenth century to compete with those of the South Eastern Railway (SER). The longer locomotive could also accommodate a larger boiler than a 4-4-0, giving sufficient power to avoid double-heading of locomotives on heavier trains.|$|E
5|$|The Nclass was {{designed}} by Maunsell in 1914 to provide a sturdy mixed-traffic locomotive with high route availability. Intended to replace several obsolete 0-6-0 types, the Nclass {{was the first step}} in the SECR's fleet standardisation programme, which also included the Kclass 2-6-4T passenger tank locomotive. Maunsell enlisted the help of former GWR engineer Harold Holcroft, who suggested that a 2-6-0 wheel arrangement would allow the class to run on the poor-quality track in north Kent. This arrangement allowed for a longer wheelbase with leading axle to permit greater stability <b>at</b> <b>speed</b> on tight track curves, which had constrained the size of locomotives operating on the SECR. A longer locomotive could also accommodate a larger boiler than an 0-6-0, giving the Nclass sufficient power to avoid double-heading of locomotives on heavier trains.|$|E
5|$|The average horse {{can carry}} up to {{approximately}} 30% {{of its body}} weight. While all horses can pull more than they can carry, the weight horses can pull varies widely, depending on the build of the horse, the type of vehicle, road conditions, and other factors. Horses harnessed to a wheeled vehicle on a paved road can pull as much as eight times their weight, but far less if pulling wheelless loads over unpaved terrain. Thus, horses that were driven varied in size and {{had to make a}} trade-off between speed and weight, just as did riding animals. Light horses could pull a small war chariot <b>at</b> <b>speed.</b> Heavy supply wagons, artillery, and support vehicles were pulled by heavier horses or a larger number of horses. The method by which a horse was hitched to a vehicle also mattered: horses could pull greater weight with a horse collar than they could with a breast collar, and even less with an ox yoke.|$|E
50|$|It is {{estimated}} that Titanis could run <b>at</b> <b>speeds</b> of 65 km/h.|$|R

50|$|Positive-displacement pumps {{deliver a}} nearly fixed volume of air per {{revolution}} <b>at</b> all <b>speeds</b> (minus leakage, {{which is almost}} constant <b>at</b> all <b>speeds</b> for a given pressure, thus its importance decreases <b>at</b> higher <b>speeds).</b>|$|R
