5|$|Christiaan Persoon first {{described}} Boletus calopus in 1801. Modern molecular phylogenetics {{showed that it}} was only distantly related to the type species of Boletus and required placement in a new genus; Caloboletus was erected in 2014, with C.calopus designated as the type species. Although Caloboletus calopus is not typically considered edible due to <b>an</b> <b>intensely</b> bitter taste that does not disappear with cooking, there are reports of it being consumed in eastern Europe. Its red stipe distinguishes it from edible species, such as Boletus edulis.|$|E
5|$|In 1876, Hayes {{was elected}} {{president}} {{in one of the}} most contentious elections in national history. He lost the popular vote to Democrat Samuel J. Tilden but he won <b>an</b> <b>intensely</b> disputed electoral college vote after a Congressional commission awarded him twenty contested electoral votes. The result was the Compromise of 1877, in which the Democrats acquiesced to Hayes's election and Hayes withdrew remaining U.S. troops protecting Republican office holders in the South.|$|E
5|$|In 1904 {{she wrote}} Je Me Souviens (I Remember), <b>an</b> <b>intensely</b> {{personal}} prose poem {{about their relationship}} which was presented as a single handwritten copy to Vivien {{in an attempt to}} win her back. They reconciled and traveled together to Lesbos, where they lived happily together for a short time and talked about starting a school of poetry for women like the one which Sappho, according to tradition, had founded on Lesbos some 2,500 years before. However, Vivien soon got a letter from her lover Baroness Hélène van Zuylen and went to Constantinople thinking she would break up with her in person. Vivien planned to meet Barney in Paris afterward but instead stayed with the Baroness and this time, the breakup was permanent.|$|E

5|$|The {{choice of}} date proved unfortunate for several reasons. It clashed {{with a public}} holiday, and many people had left {{the city for the}} country. It was <b>an</b> <b>intensely</b> hot day, which further reduced the number of people {{prepared}} to suffer the discomfort of a stuffy theatre. Worse, the threat of an imminent war between Prussia and Austria caused unrest and anxiety in Prague, which dampened public enthusiasm for light romantic comedy. Thus on its opening night the opera, in its two-act version with spoken dialogue, was poorly attended and indifferently received. Receipts failed to cover costs, and the theatre director was forced to pay Smetana's fee from his own pocket.|$|E
5|$|With Canadian {{industry}} reorganized {{to supply}} the British war effort, Howe decided he needed to journey to Britain to discuss matters with the customers. He embarked on the S.S. Western Prince in December 1940. This was <b>an</b> <b>intensely</b> dangerous trip; Germany was attempting to blockade Britain {{and there were many}} German submarines in the North Atlantic. One of those submarines sank the Western Prince on 14 December. Howe survived the sinking and eight hours in a lifeboat. Gordon Scott, his aide, was killed trying to climb from the lifeboat to the rescuing ship. Howe professed coolness in the incident, but later told the Manchester Guardian that he considered every hour that he lived from that day onwards to be borrowed time.|$|E
5|$|It {{has also}} been {{suggested}} that the atrocities that Las Casas described were exaggerated or even invented, {{but this is not}} generally considered likely as Las Casas was far from the only person to be deeply worried about abuse and mistreatment of the Indians. The Dominican friars Antonio de Montesinos and Pedro de Córdoba had reported extensive violence already {{in the first decade of}} the conquest of the Indies, and throughout the conquest of the Americas there were reports of abuse of the natives by friars and priests and ordinary citizens, and many massacres of indigenous people were reported in full by those who perpetrated them. Even some of Las Casas's enemies, such as Toribio de Benavente Motolinia, reported many gruesome atrocities committed against the Indians by the colonizers. All in all, modern historians tend to disregard the numerical figures given by Las Casas, but maintain that the general picture he presented of <b>an</b> <b>intensely</b> violent and abusive conquest did represent reality.|$|E

In three field experiments in Colombia we compare characteristics of job-seekers who are told of the affirmative action selection criterion before they apply with those who are only told after applying. We find that the gains in attracting female applicants far outweigh the losses in male applicants. Affirmative action is more effective in areas with larger female discrimination and deters male job-seekers from areas with low discrimination...|$|R
5|$|Thus Mu'tazilism became closely {{identified}} with the new regime of al-Mu'tasim, and adherence to Mu'tazilism was transformed into <b>an</b> <b>intensely</b> political issue, since to question it was to oppose {{the authority of the}} Caliph as the God-sanctioned imām. While Mu'tazilism found broad support, it was also passionately opposed by traditionalists, who held that the Quran's authority was absolute and unalterable as the literal word of God, as well as providing a vehicle for criticism by those who disliked the new regime and its elites. In the event, the active repression of the traditionalists was without success, and even proved counterproductive: the beating and imprisonment {{of one of the most}} resolute opponents of Mu'tazilism, Ahmad ibn Hanbal, in 834, only helped to spread his fame. By the time al-Mutawakkil abandoned Mu'tazilism and returned to traditional orthodoxy in 848, the strict and conservative Hanbali school had emerged as the leading school of jurisprudence (fiqh) in Sunni Islam.|$|E

40|$|Background: Interleukin (IL) - 17 is an {{important}} factor in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) pathogenesis. MicroRNA (miRNA) s are a family of non coding RNAs and associated with human diseases including RA. The purpose of this study is to identify the miRNAs in the differentiation of IL- 17 producing cells, and analyze their expression pattern in the peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) and synovium from RA patients. Methods: IL- 17 producing cells were expanded from CD 4 +T cell. MiRNA microarray was performed to identify the miRNAs in the differentiation of IL- 17 producing cells. Quantitative polymerase chain reaction was performed to examine the expression patterns of the identified miRNAs in the PBMC and synovium from RA and osteoarthritis (OA) patients. Double staining combining in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry of IL- 17 was performed to analyze the expression pattern of identified miRNA in the synovium. Results: Six miRNAs, let- 7 a, miR- 26, miR- 146 a/b, miR- 150, and miR- 155 were significantly up regulated in the IL- 17 producing T cells. The expression of miR- 146 a and IL- 17 was higher than in PBMC in the patients with low score of Larsen grade and short disease duration. MiR- 146 <b>a</b> <b>intensely</b> expressed in RA synovium in comparison to OA.
