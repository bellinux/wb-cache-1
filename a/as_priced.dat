50|$|The Thrifty Food Plan (TFP) {{is one of}} four USDA-designed food plans specifying {{foods and}} amounts of foods to provide {{adequate}} nutrition. It is used as the basis for designing Food Stamp Program benefits. It is the cheapest food plan and is calculated monthly using data collected for the consumer price index (CPI). However, it {{is not the same as}} the food components of the CPI. The monthly cost of the TFP used for the Food Stamp Program represents a national average of expenditures (four-person household consisting of an adult couple and two school-age children) adjusted for other household sizes through the use of a formula reflecting economies of scale. For food stamp purposes, the TFP <b>as</b> <b>priced</b> each June sets maximum benefit levels for the fiscal year beginning the following October.|$|E

40|$|We {{study the}} XVII century market for figurative {{paintings}} in Italy, analyzing original contracts between patrons and artists: {{this is one}} of the first manufacturing markets for which econometric evidence of the basic laws of economics can be found. Size of paintings, expected quality, type of commissions and aggregate shocks affect prices as expected. We find evidence of contractual solutions to moral hazard problems in the patron-artist relation: since quality was not negotiable, prices were made conditional on correlated variables such as the number of figures depicted. We find evidence of price equalization between high and low demand destinations due to endogenous mobility of the painters (or the paintings). We also provide support for the Galenson hypothesis of a positive relation between age of experimental artists and quality <b>as</b> <b>priced</b> by the market.

40|$|We {{study the}} art market in the XVI-XVIII centuries with an econometric {{analysis}} of a new dataset on original contracts between patrons and artists for commissions of oil paintings of historical subject in the Venetian Republic. Size of paintings, reputation of the painters as perceived at the time, type of commissions and aggregate demand shocks (the plague) a¤ect prices as expected. We ?nd evidence of contractual solutions to moral hazard problems: since quality was not contractable, prices were made conditional on measurable features correlated with quality {{as the number of}} human ?gures. We also ?nd strong evidence of price equalization between high-demand and low-demand towns due to painters?mobility. Finally, we provide support for the Galenson hypothesis of a positive relation between age of experimental artists and quality <b>as</b> <b>priced</b> by the market. The results are con?rmed for other Italian art centres. ...|$|E

40|$|Although the {{consumption}} based asset pricing theory {{appears to be}} theoretically superior and more elegant than the beta pricing model, in practice the beta pricing model is more widely applied. Indeed, beta pricing models {{are one of the}} most widely adopted tools in financial analysis. They readily allow handling systematic risk <b>as</b> <b>priced</b> in financial assets. However, accurately estimating beta-coefficients is not as straightforward as implicitly suggested by Sharpe's standard market model, i. e. simply using the ordinary least-squares (OLS) regression. This is primarily because beta-coefficients cannot generally be assumed to be stable over time. In order to overcome this deficiency, we present and apply a non-parametric estimation technique that allows capturing this time effect and promises both more reliable estimates than obtained with an OLS regression as well as better manageability compared with the existing time-series approaches dealing with time-varying beta-coefficients. Estimation results for constant and time-varying betas are presented for portfolios of German industries. Systematic risk, time-varying beta-coefficients, non-parametric estimation, spline smoothing, varying-coefficient model,...|$|E
40|$|We analyze art pricing in {{a unique}} dataset on Madrid {{inventories}} between 1600 and 1750. Hedonic regressions reveal a number of interesting facts about the taste of Baroque Spanish collectors and the imports of foreign paintings. The hedonic price index shows an impressive increase {{in the price of}} paintings (relative to the cost of living) during the XVII century, in line with the Lopez hypothesis for which investment in art increases in wealthy societies without new productive investment opportunities. We examine price differentials between domestic and imported paintings: {{at the beginning of the}} century local works were priced substantially below imported paintings, but the price gap is gradually reduced during the century, with an increasing contribution of the younger painters. This is in line with a Schumpeterian hypothesis for which increasing demand induced increasing domestic quality, <b>as</b> <b>priced</b> by the market, and created the conditions for what is known as the Siglo de Oro of Spanish art. “I judge that Spain is a pious mother to foreigners and a very cruel stepmother to her own nativ...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (MEng (Civil Engineering)) [...] University of Stellenbosch, 2006. Most {{construction}} projects do not complete exactly as scheduled or exactly <b>as</b> <b>priced.</b> During {{the implementation of}} a project there is almost certainly some deviation from the original estimate. The implementation of a majority of projects has actually been shown to cost more and take longer than originally estimated. However, the duration and cost performance of a project’s implementation is measured against the initial estimate produced. Thus if a project is considered to have completed late or over budget then essentially the duration or cost estimated was insufficient. Due to the fact that estimates are produced in a present day environment for inherently unique projects that occur in uncertain future environments, the estimates produced will need to incorporate uncertainty to increase their likelihood of achievability. This study aims to derive methods to incorporate future uncertainty into project estimates. This uncertainty is incorporated, analysed and manipulated through the use of Probabilistic models and First Order Second Moment Reliability methods. The derived methods provide project management professionals with tools that enable them to design estimates that incorporate future uncertainty and are reliable to a specified degree. Further methods are then derived to probabilistically assess the commercial feasibility of a project in an uncertain future environment. These derived methods then provide project managers and decision makers with more reliable procedures and information which in turn should assist them in making correct, project orientated decisions and ultimately increase profit reliability and client satisfaction...|$|E

40|$|Service-oriented systems (SOS) have {{recently}} emerged as context-independent component-based systems. In contrast to components, services can be created, invoked, composed and destroyed at run-time. Services {{are assumed to}} be platform independent and available for use within heterogeneous applications. One of the main assets in SOS is service composability. It allows the development of composite services with the main goal of reusable functionality provided by existing services in a low cost and rapid development process at run-time. However, in such distributed systems it becomes difficult to guarantee the quality of services (QoS), both in isolation, {{as well as of the}} newly created service compositions. Means of checking correctness of service composition can enable optimization w. r. t. the function and resource-usage of composed services, as well as provide a higher degree of QoS assurance of a service composition. To accomplish such goals, we employ model-checking technique for both single and composed services. The verification eventually provides necessaryinformation about QoS, already at early development stage. This thesis presents the research that we have been carrying out, on developing of methods and tools for specification, modeling, and formal analysis of services and service compositions in SOS. In this work, we first show how to formally check QoS in terms of performance and reliability for formallyspecified component-based systems (CBS). Next, we outline the commonalities and differences between SOS and CBS. Third, we develop constructs for the formal description of services using the resource-aware timed behavioral language called REMES, including development of language to support service compositions. At last, we show how to check service and service composition(functional, timing and resource-wise) correctness by employing the strongest post condition semantics. For less complex services and service compositions we choose to prove correctness using Hoare triples and the guarded command language. In case of complex services described <b>as</b> <b>priced</b> timed automata(PTA), we prove correctness via algorithmic computation of strongest post-condition of PTA. Q-ImPreS...|$|E
