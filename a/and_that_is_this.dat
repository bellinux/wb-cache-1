I say, that every one {{that in a way}} of profession and religion, 'nameth the name of Christ, should depart from iniquity.' This truth needs more practice than proof. For I think there are none that have either scripture or reason by them, but will freely consent to this.|$|E

And that the tempering or softning of it arises from the proportionate or smaller parcels of it left within those pores. This will seem the more probable, if we consider these Particulars.|$|E

It began, in fact, {{when we were little}} more than children. It finished--to-day. There is only one thing I want to say to you about it, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>this.</b> Our friendship was of that sort which is fairly well recognized and even approved of by {{the world in which we}} live. It contained, of course, certain elements of flirtation--I am not denying that. There was never at any time, however, anything in that friendship which made it an error even of taste on my part to ask you to become my wife." ...|$|E

"Your honour may {{say your}} pleasure," [...] answered' Ludovic Lesly; [...] "but, by my faith, second sighted Saunders Souplesaw, the town souter of Glen Houlakin, was worth Galeotti, or Gallipotty, or {{whatever}} ye call him, twice told, for a prophet.

And Saunders foretold to myself one day, that I should be made by marriage, which doubtless will also happen in due time, though it hath not yet come to pass--though how or when, I can hardly guess, as I care not myself for the wedded state, and Quentin is but a lad.

60|$|In {{any given}} {{instance}} {{this or that}} reason {{for the failure of}} a child may be given. In one case it may be the father or mother drinks, in another that the child is an orphan, neglected by aunt or stepmother, in another that the mother is an invalid or a sweated worker too overwrought to do much for him, or, though a good-hearted soul, she is careless and dirty or ignorant, or that she is immoral and reckless, {{and so on and so}} on. Our haphazard sample of ten Scotch cases gives instances of nearly all these alternatives. And from these proximate causes one might work back to more general ones, to the necessity of controlling the drink traffic, of abolishing sweating, of shortening women's hours of labour, of suppressing vice. But for the present argument it is not necessary to follow up these special causes. We can make a wider generalization. For our present analysis it is sufficient to say that one more general maladjustment covers every case of neglected or ill-brought-up children in the world, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>this,</b> that with or without a decent excuse, the parent has not been equal to the task of rearing a civilized citizen. We have demanded too much from the parent, materially and morally, and the ten cases we have quoted are just ten out of ten millions of the replies to that demand. Of fifty-two children born, fourteen are dead; and of the remainder we can hardly regard more than thirteen as being tolerably reared.|$|E

60|$|That was a {{great many}} years ago. And to-day {{is the first time}} that I have told that dream since Dr. Burton scared me into fatal doubts about it. No, I don't believe I can say that. I don't believe that I ever really had any doubts {{whatever}} concerning the salient points of the dream, for those points are of such a nature that they are pictures, and pictures can be remembered, when they are vivid, much better than one can remember remarks and unconcreted facts. Although it has been so many years since I have told that dream, I can see those pictures now just as clearly defined as if they were before me in this room. I have not told the entire dream. There was a good deal more of it. I mean I have not told all that happened in the dream's fulfilment. After the incident in the death-room I may mention one detail, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>this.</b> When I arrived in St. Louis with the casket it was about eight o'clock in the morning, and I ran to my brother-in-law's place of business, hoping to find him there, but I missed him, for while I was on the way to his office he was on his way from the house to the boat. When I got back to the boat the casket was gone. He had conveyed it out to his house. I hastened thither, and when I arrived the men were just removing the casket from the vehicle to carry it up-stairs. I stopped that procedure, for I did not want my mother to see the dead face, because one side of it was drawn and distorted by the effects of the opium. When I went up-stairs, there stood the two chairs--placed to receive the coffin--just as I had seen them in my dream; and if I had arrived two or three minutes later, the casket would have been resting upon them, precisely as in my dream of several weeks before.|$|E

5000|$|In August 2012, Prime Minister Tuilaepa Sailele Malielegaoi {{reportedly}} [...] "scoffed" [...] at {{the idea}} that Samoa would follow the lead of New Zealand in legalising same-sex marriage. When asked if he would support legalisation, he said, [...] "You are dreaming." [...] He reiterated this position, on explicitly religious grounds, in March 2013.My view as the leader of Samoa on this gay marriage issue is simple: There is no way, none whatsoever, that this issue will ever be considered in Samoa. The Samoan parliament would never consider a bill such as this, at least not in my time. It is the strong and combined view of the government of Samoa and the country's religious denominations. We stand united against this because Samoa is founded on Christian beliefs. And Christian beliefs are against this type of behavior which the Bible states, was the reason for the curse that brought destruction on Gomorrah and Sodom. It is very clear that the sacrament of marriage is {{between a man and a}} woman. Same sex marriage is a sin. And no matter how people present this issue, no matter how they wrap it up, there is only one truth, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>is,</b> <b>this</b> type of behavior is a sin.|$|E

He added that there were partisan differences over [...] "the way we get there to help everybody. ... Hopefully, we can bridge those differences." [...] Cantor however warned, that, if Obama follows what Cantor called a liberal agenda, then that agenda it’s not designed to bring Republicans and the president together. Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell stated in a written statement that every four years on Inaugural Day America shows the world that its major political parties can disagree with civility and mutual respect. McConnell wrote that Obamas speech was a [...] "fresh start" [...] {{to address the issue of}} federal spending and debt: [...] "Republicans are eager to work with the president on achieving this common goal and we firmly believe that divided government provides the perfect opportunity to do so. Together, there is much we can achieve." [...] He also praised Obamas speech as [...] "a really good speech. People can criticize President Obama about a lot of things. But not his ability to communicate. I think he communicated to the American people a message of hope, a message of action and I liked it very much.” ...|$|E
