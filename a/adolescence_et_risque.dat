40|$|Workplace {{exposures}} and hazards have {{detrimental effects}} on many organ {{systems in the}} body including the reproductive system. The evidence of the reproductive effects of occupational hazards is obtained through a synthesis of the available literature. These effects vary and overlap due to the multiple nature of exposures in the workplace. Hazardous agents include pesticides, solvents and heavy metals. The reproductive effects include reduced fecundity, abnormal sperm quality, increased risk of low birth weight, miscarriages and permanent sterility. These problems are not readily identified as having occupational causes in developing countries such as Nigeria where infertility has a high family and social consequence. Epidemiological studies in Nigeria are needed to evaluate the reproductive effects of workplace exposures. Protective measures such as proper house keeping, education {{and the use of}} personal protectives at the workplace are advocated (Afr J Reprod Health 2009; 13 [1]: 159 - 165).

40|$|The [french] {{ecologist}} electorate {{and industrial}} risks. Philippe Bonnetain, Daniel Boy. Political ecology has been present in France {{in the electoral}} field, with varying success, for about twenty years. A statistical and geographical analysis of its electoral results shows {{that there has been}} for a long time a relatively stable ecologist electoral structure. What is the significance of this structuring of a political phenomenon outside traditional politics ? While it is true that voters vote for ecology to promote policies of environmental defense, one could expect the frequency of such votes to be higher in areas where the environment is objectively threatened more than elsewhere. To verify this hypothesis, the ecologist vote is related statistically to objective indicators {{of the state of the}} environment in the various departments (pollution rate, intensity of industrial risks, etc.). The statistical analysis shows that in fact the expected relation is absent, and that votes for ecology are linked only to political factors (tapping a fraction of the Socialist Party's electorate) and to economic factors (a low unemployment rate).

This work has been realized in the Northern Vietnam, in the Dong Cao experimental watershed (average slope ~ 40 %). Our work shows that endogeic earthworms are associated to agrosystems with low vegetation cover (or low litter content) while agrosystems with high vegetation cover are characterized by anecic earthworms that create casts on the soil surface. The quantity of soil accumulated on the soil surface by earthworms can be very important (10 - 20 kg m-?). A simulation of water runoff associated to the annual measurement of soil erosion from 1 m? plots shows that casts deposited on the soil surface lead to a better infiltration of water but do not increase soil erosion. This study highlights that other biological factors than the vegetation must be considered for a sustainable management of steep slope agro-ecosystems in the Northern Vietnam...|$|R

Without pretending to a systematic comparison, {{this study examines}} the risks involved {{in the management of}} food in several African countries. The articles expose the gap between the initial intentions of food policies, their implementation and local situations. They stress the weakening of the State, the growing strength of trading networks and individual citizen initiatives, which constitute the most of the relations between the actors of the food system, while indicating the plurality of their perceptions, usages and normative frameworks. Such are the stages of a reflection which examines the relationships between theoretical frameworks, development models and the game of actors. Janin Pierre, De Suremain Charles-Édouard.

The scientific purpose is to determine if these two components of soil losses from erosion process on topsoil {{could be used as}} tracers for the organic matter to point out the surface water pathway during one peak flow. The fluctuations in POC content, in C/N rate and in ? 13 C isotopic rate are no linked with the vegetation species on the sloping land during the process of surface runoff until the runoff collect in the small stream. However their absolute values are characteristic of each kind of vegetation cover. Then our results allow assuming that the mix of chemical tracers such as pH, water conductivity, organic carbon and nitrogen content in sediment with the associate measurements of ? 13 C isotopic component can be used to analyze the surface water pathway within a small sloping watershed during one peak flow. The next step will be the calculation of hydrological components of the hydrogram in relationship with the water pathway by the mixed equation use applied to the ? 13 C isotopic component of the organic matter form the sediments and from their corresponding soils...|$|R
