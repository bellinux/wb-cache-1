40|$|Various {{approaches}} {{for evaluating the}} bioequivalence (BE) of highly variable drugs (CV[*]≥[*] 30 %) have been debated for many years. More recently, the FDA conducted research to evaluate one such approach: scaled <b>average</b> <b>BE.</b> A main objective {{of this study was}} to determine the impact of scaled <b>average</b> <b>BE</b> on study power, and compare it to the method commonly applied currently (<b>average</b> <b>BE).</b> Three-sequence, three period, two treatment partially replicated cross-over BE studies were simulated in S-Plus. <b>Average</b> <b>BE</b> criteria, using 80 – 125 % limits on the 90 % confidence intervals for Cmax and AUC geometric mean ratios, as well as scaled <b>average</b> <b>BE</b> were applied to the results. The percent of studies passing BE was determined under different conditions. Variables tested included within subject variability, point estimate constraint, and different values for σw 0, which is a constant set by the regulatory agency. The simulation results demonstrated higher study power with scaled <b>average</b> <b>BE,</b> compared to <b>average</b> <b>BE,</b> as within subject variability increased. At 60 % CV, study power was more than 90 % for scaled <b>average</b> <b>BE,</b> compared with about 22 % for <b>average</b> <b>BE.</b> A σw 0 value of 0. 25 appears to work best. The results of this research project suggest that scaled <b>average</b> <b>BE,</b> using a partial replicate design, is a good approach for the evaluation of BE of highly variable drugs...|$|R
