30|$|Feelings of <b>awe.</b> According to Haidt and Keltner (2003), <b>awe</b> is {{an emotion}} arising from {{positive}} stimuli that {{are perceived as}} {{much larger than the}} self and difficult to fully comprehend. While affective gratefulness often results from reflecting on a situation, <b>awe</b> tends to involve experiential absorption (Bryant and Veroff 2007). Adler and Fagley (2005) showed that feelings of <b>awe</b> correlate with appreciative functioning and suggested that <b>awe</b> can be a direct affective manifestation of appreciation. <b>Awe</b> shares many of the attentional and comprehension processes of appreciative functioning and can be experienced for particularly potent benefit appraisals.|$|R

Research on <b>awe</b> is in its infancy and has primarily focused on describing <b>awe</b> (e.g., physical displays of <b>awe</b> and who is likely to experience <b>awe)</b> and the social consequences of <b>awe</b> (e.g., helping behavior and susceptibility to persuasion by weak messages).|$|R

40|$|America s utopian and {{communal}} societies {{have a long}} history of using transcendence as a commitment mechanism for followers and converts. The most prevalent commitment mechanism is institutionalized <b>awe</b> through ideology. This principle is extremely important to utopian communities and societies in terms of longevity. Sometimes the ideologies need to be changed in order to help a community sustain <b>awe,</b> and, through the <b>awe,</b> membership. Some of the most successful utopian communities in American history utilized the flexibility of their ideologies to maintain <b>awe</b> and sustain the needs of their members, especially in tragic and difficult circumstances. The American communal societies that were failures in terms of longevity did not use the flexibility of ideological <b>awe</b> to sustain their societies. Part of this could result from the differences between economic and religious ideologies that inspire <b>awe.</b> This paper will explore <b>awe</b> inspiring ideologies in some successful and unsuccessful utopian communities to show how communal groups and their leadership adapted or changed the <b>awe</b> to bring failure or success. When one has a firm grasp of institutionalized <b>awe</b> through ideology it can be seen that ideological <b>awe</b> is extremely important and pervasive in religious traditions and satisfies different human desires...|$|R

6000|$|Perhaps in all Italy {{there was}} at that time no city which, for its size, {{contained}} so large a number of priests; probably its hush and quiet suited them; but nearly every other person in the streets was an ecclesiastic, and the clang of the bells calling to prayer from their picturesque round campaniles never ceased. It was past mid-day, and mass was over in most of the churches, when two aged women, in black dresses and thick veils, which entirely concealed their faces, rang at the bell of the Bishop's palace. The door was opened by a man in a sort of semi-clerical attire. On giving their names, he bowed respectfully, and saying [...] "His lordship is expecting you," [...] led the way up some wide stairs, through a long corridor, and then signing to them to wait a moment, he entered the room; returning in a few seconds, he requested them to enter, and closed the door behind them. It was a very large room, although its length was comparatively greater than its width. A range of bookshelves, extending from the floor to a height of about five feet, ran completely round it, and upon the dark-panelled walls were hung a long series of portraits, probably those of the bishop's predecessors in office. Above, the ceiling was divided by a richly-gilt framework into a number of irregular partitions, in which were inserted a fine series of paintings by ancient masters, the subjects of which were not all so strictly Scriptural as might have been expected in the palace of a Church dignitary. The light entered by a very large window {{at the end of the}} apartment, the panes of which were of the small diamond pattern. With his back to this window, by the side of a large chair, in which he had apparently been sitting reading when his visitors were announced, stood the Bishop of Ravenna. Although he had returned from mass some quarter of an hour, he still wore a part of the robes in which he had officiated. It is probable that as he expected the ladies who had just entered, and as he was particularly anxious upon this occasion to impress their minds strongly, he had purposely retained these insignia of his office to add to the power which he had for many years been accustomed to exercise over them. Not, indeed, that the bishop needed any adventitious aids to his personal appearance. He was a tall, stately figure, but little bent with the weight of the seventy years which had passed over him. His hair was silver white, but the lines of the face were still strong and marked. His manner was very variable,--at times commanding, even harsh; at other moments mild and persuasive. As an orator he had few equals in his Church,--the varying modulations of his voice alternately <b>awing</b> and melting his audience. He advanced to meet the two women, who, their veils raised now, hurried towards him, and knelt at his feet to receive the blessing which he impressively bestowed upon them. That done, he raised them, and placed them in chairs facing the one he himself occupied.|$|E
6000|$|The hermits set {{themselves}} {{to answer that}} question, not by arguing or writing about it, but by the only way in which any question can be settled--by experiment. They resolved to try whether their immortal souls could not grow better and better, while their mortal bodies were utterly neglected; to make their flesh serve their spirit; to make virtue their only end and aim; and utterly to relinquish {{the very notion of}} pleasure. To do this one thing, and nothing else, they devoted their lives; and they succeeded. From their time it has been a received opinion, not merely among a few philosophers or a few Pharisees, but among the lowest, the poorest, the most ignorant, who have known aught of Christianity, that man is an immortal soul; that the spirit, and not the flesh, ought to be master and guide; that virtue is the highest good; and that purity is a virtue, impurity a sin. These men were, it has been well said, the very fathers of purity. And if, in that and in other matters, they pushed their purpose to an extreme--if, by devoting themselves utterly to it alone, they suffered, not merely in wideness of mind or in power of judging evidence, but even in brain, till they became some of them at times insane from over-wrought nerves--it is not for us to blame the soldier for the wounds which have crippled him, or the physician for the disease which he has caught himself while trying to heal others. Let us not speak ill of the bridge which carries us over, nor mock at those who did the work for us as seemed to them best, and perhaps in the only way in which it could be done in those evil days. As a matter of fact, through these men's teaching and example we have learnt what morality, purity, and Christianity we possess; and if any answer that we have learnt them from the Scriptures, who but these men preserved the Scriptures to us? Who taught us to look on them as sacred and inspired? Who taught us to apply them to our own daily lives, and find comfort and teaching in every age, in words written ages ago by another race in a foreign land? The Scriptures were the book, generally the only book, which they read and meditated, not merely from morn till night, but, as far as fainting nature would allow, from night to morn again: and their method of interpreting them (as far as I can discover) differed in nothing from that common to all Christians now, save that they interpreted literally certain precepts of our Lord and of St. Paul which we consider to have applied only to the [...] "temporary necessity" [...] of a decayed, dying, and hopeless age such as that in which they lived. And therefore, because they knew the Scripture well, and learned in it lessons of true virtue and true philosophy, though unable to save civilization in the East, they were able at least to save it in the West. The European hermits, and the monastic communities which they originated, were indeed a seed of life, not merely to the conquered Roman population of Gaul or Spain or Britain, but to the heathen and Arian barbarians who conquered them. Among those fierce and armed savages, the unarmed hermits stood, strong only by justice, purity, and faith in God, defying the oppressor, succouring the oppressed, and <b>awing</b> and softening the new aristocracy of the middle age, which was founded on mere brute force and pride of race; because the monk took his stand upon mere humanity; because he told the wild conqueror, Goth or Sueve, Frank or Burgund, Saxon or Norseman, that all men were equal in the sight of God; because he told them (to quote Athanasius's own words concerning Antony) that [...] "virtue is not beyond human nature;" [...] that the highest moral excellence was possible to the most low-born and unlettered peasant whom they trampled under their horses' hoofs, if he were only renewed and sanctified by the Spirit of God. They accepted the lowest and commonest facts of that peasant's wretched life; they outdid him in helplessness, loneliness, hunger, dirt, and slavery; and then said, [...] "Among all these I can yet be a man of God, wise, virtuous, pure, free, and noble in the sight of God, though not in the sight of Caesars, counts, and knights." [...] They went on, it is true, to glorify the means above the end; to consecrate childlessness, self-torture, dirt, ignorance, as if they were things pleasing to God and holy in themselves. But in spite of those errors they wrought throughout Europe a work which, {{as far as we can}} judge, could have been done in no other way; done only by men who gave up all that makes life worth having for the sake of being good themselves and making others good.|$|E
