5|$|The game {{begins with}} a cold open in which Wes infiltrates and destroys the Team Snagem hideout before leaving the organization. Wes starts at the Outskirt Stand, a {{dilapidated}} train engine {{in the middle of}} the desert that has been converted into a shop. With Espeon and Umbreon, Wes's first opponent is a Trainer named Willie. Wes then leaves the Stand and heads to the oasis-esque Phenac City in time to see two men dragging a sack. After defeating them in battle, Wes unties the sack to find Rui, a girl with the ability to discern Shadow Pokémon. They meet the mayor, Es Cade, who seems very bothered about the Cipher problem, but seems to do nothing <b>about</b> <b>it.</b> <b>Later,</b> upon leaving Phenac Colosseum, three Snagem grunts find Wes and Rui. The grunts then reveal to Rui that he was a member of Snagem, and an excellent Snagger. Wes then confronts one of the grunts, which results in the latter's defeat. Finding out that he is an expert at snagging Pokémon, Rui asks him to join forces with her in finding and snagging Shadow Pokémon.|$|E
25|$|Lincoln's {{service had}} a lasting {{impression}} on him and he related tales <b>about</b> <b>it</b> <b>later</b> in life with modesty {{and a bit of}} humor. Through his service he was able to forge lasting political connections. In addition, he received a land grant from the U.S. government for his military service during the war. Though Lincoln had no military experience when he assumed command of his company, he is generally characterized as an able and competent leader.|$|E
25|$|At the end {{of season}} one, the demon Tony tells Sam that he {{believes}} Sam's parents were paid by the Devil to carry his (the Devil's) baby, though Sam's mother denied this, and the Devil admits that he would probably not answer Sam honestly if asked <b>about</b> <b>it.</b> <b>Later,</b> the Devil indicates that Sam is his son, although the father who raised Sam, Mr. Oliver, tells Sam that the deal with the Devil will not allow him to tell Sam {{the truth of the}} matter. All other characters who know about the claim assume that Sam, though kindhearted, is indeed the Devil's son.|$|E

50|$|The song {{received}} airplay in the United States on the album-oriented rock radio, and John Entwistle had a 1987 radio {{interview with}} Howard Stern <b>about</b> <b>it.</b> <b>It</b> <b>later</b> proved to become Entwistle's highest charting single release, peaking at number 41 on the Billboard Mainstream Rock chart.|$|R
25|$|Schorr {{attracted}} {{the anger of}} Richard Nixon's White House. In 1971, after a dispute with White House aides, Schorr's friends, neighbors, and co-workers were questioned by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) about his habits. They were told that Schorr was under consideration for a high-level position in the environmental area. Schorr knew nothing <b>about</b> <b>it.</b> <b>Later,</b> during the Watergate hearings, {{it was revealed that}} Nixon aides had drawn up what became known as Nixon's Enemies List, and Daniel Schorr was on that list. Famously, Schorr read the list aloud on live TV, surprised to be reading his own name in that context. Schorr won Emmys for news reporting in 1972, 1973, and 1974.|$|E
25|$|When Yu Fan {{was living}} in exile, he was still very {{concerned}} about state affairs. For example, he strongly opposed Sun Quan's idea of sending an army across the sea to attack the warlord Gongsun Yuan in Liaodong (in northeastern China). However, he did not dare to voice his opinion directly to Sun Quan, so he asked Lü Dai to help him pass his message to Sun Quan, but Lü did not. Sun Quan heard <b>about</b> <b>it</b> <b>later</b> and was so angry with Yu Fan for opposing his decision that he banished Yu further south to Mengling County (猛陵縣), Cangwu Commandery (蒼梧郡), which is located in present-day Guangxi. Sun Quan sent a fleet to attack Gongsun Yuan, but he regretted his decision later when storms caused the fleet to sustain heavy damage and losses. He remembered Yu Fan and quickly sent messengers to Jiao Province to fetch Yu Fan back to Jianye, but Yu had already died.|$|E
25|$|Meanwhile, Henry's son Hal is joking, drinking, and thieving with Falstaff and his associates. He likes Falstaff {{but makes}} no pretense at being like him. He enjoys {{insulting}} his dissolute friend and makes sport of him by joining in Poins’ plot to disguise themselves and rob and terrify Falstaff and three friends of loot they have stolen in a highway robbery, purely {{for the fun of}} watching Falstaff lie <b>about</b> <b>it</b> <b>later,</b> after which Hal returns the stolen money. Rather early in the play, in fact, Hal informs us that his riotous time will soon come to a close, and he will re-assume his rightful high place in affairs by showing himself worthy to his father and others through some (unspecified) noble exploits. Hal believes that this sudden change of manner will amount to a greater reward and acknowledgment of prince-ship, and in turn earn him respect from the members of the court.|$|E

50|$|The {{book was}} {{received}} with some surprise by Mencken's readers, since, unlike his commentaries on current events, {{it is written}} with great warmth and affection. Mencken's childhood was apparently happy and secure, and he enjoyed both living through <b>it</b> and reminiscing <b>about</b> <b>it</b> in <b>later</b> years.|$|R
25|$|For the {{remainder}} of the millennium, and much of the next, Little Petra remained unknown to all but the Bedouin nomads who sometimes camped in it or its vicinity. Europeans, who could not visit the Arab world under Islamic rule, heard about Petra but were unsure of its existence. When Swiss traveler Jacob Burckhardt became the first Western visitor to Petra since Roman times in 1812, he did not venture to its north, or did not write <b>about</b> <b>it.</b> <b>Later</b> Western visitors to the region likewise seem to have concentrated on the main Petra site. Only in the late 1950s did British archaeologist Diana Kirkbride supplement her excavations at Petra itself with digs in the Beidha area, which included Little Petra, not described as a separate site at the time. Those digs continued until 1983, two years before UNESCO inscribed the Petra area, including Beidha and Little Petra, as a World Heritage Site.|$|E
25|$|Beckham {{returned}} to Old Trafford {{for the second}} leg of the tie on 10 March 2010; he did not start the match, but was brought on for Ignazio Abate in the 64th minute to a positive reception from the Manchester United fans. The score was 3–0 for United at that point and the tie was all but decided. The match {{was the first time}} Beckham had played against Manchester United at Old Trafford and saw him create several scoring opportunities via crosses and corner kicks, but Manchester United dominated Milan and beat them 4–0, winning the tie 7–2. Following the final whistle, he aroused a bit of controversy by draping the green-and-gold scarf around his neck that was given to him by the Manchester United supporters protesting against club owner Malcolm Glazer. As the fan protests against Glazer by the people gathered around Manchester United Supporters' Trust gained steam in 2010, the green-and-gold scarf had come to be seen as an anti-Glazer symbol, and by extension many saw Beckham's decision to publicly put it on as gesture of support. When asked <b>about</b> <b>it</b> <b>later,</b> however, Beckham responded that protests are not his business.|$|E
500|$|The {{incident}} was widely reported and condemned by the Soviet press. Kharlamov himself believed that [...] "Bobby Clarke {{was given the}} job of taking {{me out of the}} game." [...] The slash was apparently done at the instigation of assistant coach John Ferguson. [...] "I remember that Kharlamov's ankle was hurting pretty bad. I called Clarke over to the bench, looked over at Kharlamov and said, 'I think he needs a tap on the ankle.' I didn't think twice about it. It was Us versus Them. And Kharlamov was killing us. I mean, somebody had to do it." [...] Canadian journalist Dick Beddoes asked Clarke <b>about</b> <b>it</b> <b>later</b> at a team reunion, calling it a [...] "wicked two-hander", to which Clarke replied [...] "Dick, if I hadn't learned how to lay on a two-hander once in a while, I'd never have left Flin Flon." ...|$|E

500|$|Nevertheless, the British press {{remained}} {{quiet on}} the subject until Alfred Blunt, Bishop of Bradford, gave a speech to his diocesan conference on 1 December, which alluded to the King's need of divine grace: [...] "We hope that he is aware of his need. Some of us wish that he gave more positive signs of his awareness." [...] The press took this for the first public comment by a notable person on the crisis and it became front page news the following day. When asked <b>about</b> <b>it</b> <b>later,</b> however, the bishop claimed he had not heard of Simpson {{at the time he}} wrote the speech. Acting on the advice of Edward's staff, Simpson left Britain for the south of France two days later in an attempt to escape intense press attention. Both she and the King were devastated by the separation. At a tearful departure, the King told her, [...] "I shall never give you up." ...|$|E
500|$|One of {{the first}} actions of Hitler's {{administration}} was the Law for the Restoration of the Professional Civil Service which removed Jews and politically suspect government employees (including university professors) from their jobs unless they had [...] "demonstrated their loyalty to Germany" [...] by serving in World War I. In April 1933 Noether received a notice from the Prussian Ministry for Sciences, Art, and Public Education which read: [...] "On the basis of paragraph 3 of the Civil Service Code of 7 April 1933, I hereby withdraw from {{you the right to}} teach at the University of Göttingen." [...] Several of Noether's colleagues, including Max Born and Richard Courant, also had their positions revoked. Noether accepted the decision calmly, providing support for others during this difficult time. Hermann Weyl later wrote that [...] "Emmy Noether—her courage, her frankness, her unconcern about her own fate, her conciliatory spirit—was {{in the midst of all}} the hatred and meanness, despair and sorrow surrounding us, a moral solace." [...] Typically, Noether remained focused on mathematics, gathering students in her apartment to discuss class field theory. When one of her students appeared in the uniform of the Nazi paramilitary organization Sturmabteilung (SA), she showed no sign of agitation and, reportedly, even laughed <b>about</b> <b>it</b> <b>later.</b> This, however, was before the bloody events of Kristallnacht in 1938, and their praise from Propaganda Minister Joseph Goebels.|$|E
500|$|The {{episode was}} {{critically}} acclaimed by television critics. Alessandra Stanley of The New York Times opined, [...] "Those cues also hold out {{the promise that}} the coming season will once again pivot {{the story on the}} workplace. It’s where Mad Men started and where it was best. A fresh start at the rat race is just what the series needs." [...] Eric Goldman of IGN gave the episode a nine out of ten, signifying an [...] "amazing" [...] rating. Goldman felt that it start of the season on a strong note, writing, [...] "It's a clever beat to start out with, leading into a strong premiere that quickly drops us into what can be described as Mad Men 2.0." [...] Praise was also directed to the musical selection of the episode, which Goldman described as excellent. In concurrence, Keith Phipps of The A.V. Club gave the episode an 'A' grade, praising the character development of Don Draper and Peggy Olson. Expressing that she had more confidence, Phipps said of Peggy: [...] " [...] the person who's changed most notably over the last year. She drinks at work like the boys and [...] goes into a Don-like trance as she searches for inspiration. She bosses Joey around and tells him when he’s gone too far. And she’s not afraid to get creative to sell ham and wants credit for her idea, even if it encounters a minor disaster along the way. Most significantly, she’s standing up to Don at every turn now. He bullies her in front of her fiancé but hears <b>about</b> <b>it</b> <b>later.</b> And she provides a devastating mixture of admiration and chiding when she reminds Don that everyone at SCDP is there because of him and out of a desire to make him happy." [...] Similarly, James Poniewozik of Time praised the performance of Elisabeth Moss, exclaiming that [...] "she has come a long way." ...|$|E

2500|$|For {{those who}} {{attended}} the Vancouver Conference or learned <b>about</b> <b>it</b> <b>later</b> on, {{it was apparent that}} the poetics of Charles Olson, proprioceptive or Projectivist in its reach, was exerting a significant and lasting influence on the emerging generation of artists and poets who came to prominence in the 1950s and 1960s. Subsequent to this emerging generation of artists who felt Olson's impact, poets such as Robert Creeley and Robert Duncan would in turn exert their own huge impact on our national poetries (see also: Black Mountain poets and San Francisco Renaissance). Of this particular company of poets encountered in Vancouver, Palmer says: ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{the years}} {{following}} Taylor's 2005 return, her storylines changed significantly. After Ridge leaves Taylor, she becomes depressed and struggles with alcoholism. Tylo explained how this affected the character: [...] "The {{love of her life}} throws her away after she struggled so hard to come back to him. It was painful and humiliating. That made her more real and now, after everything she's been through, Taylor gets to be a little manipulative spiteful and even resentful." [...] Taylor, who is usually resilient, falls into a tailspin: accidentally killing Darla Forrester (Schae Harrison) in a hit and run accident and lying <b>about</b> <b>it,</b> <b>later</b> being arrested for driving under the influence. Tylo confessed, [...] "These were the kinds of stories I was begging for", as she thought [...] "it was very believable". The actress also wanted to portray Taylor as less [...] "serious".|$|E

This is about one of those situations where the strange place that I ran into him was an awards show. I was seated a couple of seats {{away from him and}} there was so much that needed to be said, and neither one of us was willing to say it. We were both acting like we were engaged in conversations with people that we don't even know. It was just miserable. I was telling my Mom <b>about</b> <b>it</b> <b>later,</b> and I said I felt like I was standing alone in a crowded room. And then I was like, [...] "Gotta go. Bye!"

2500|$|In response, Depp's {{lawyers said}} that Heard was [...] "attempting {{to secure a}} {{premature}} financial resolution by alleging abuse". On May 31, Heard gave {{a statement to the}} LAPD on the incident on May 21; her lawyers said that she had initially been reluctant to involve law enforcement in the case [...] "stemmed from a wish to protect her own privacy and Depp's career", but [...] "Johnny's team has forced Amber to give a statement to the LAPD {{to set the record straight}} as to the true facts, as she cannot continue to leave herself open to the vicious false and malicious allegations that have infected the media." [...] The following day, People published images of Heard's injuries from an alleged earlier incident of domestic violence, and on June 4, Wright published an essay on Refinery29, in which she wrote about witnessing evidence of abuse throughout the marriage and criticized the media for victim-blaming Heard when she decided to go public <b>about</b> <b>it.</b> <b>Later</b> that month, Heard sued Depp's friend, comedian Doug Stanhope, for defamation after he wrote in a column for TheWrap that she was blackmailing Depp and withdrew her initial request for spousal support.|$|E
