The main types of chemical <b>admixtures</b> can be summarized as plasticizers, accelerating/retarding agents, air entraining agents, waterproofing additives and others such as corrosion inhibitors and colouring agents etc. The benefits derived {{from the use of}} chemical <b>admixtures</b> include improved durability, strength, chemical resistance, colouring, reduction in water and cement requirement and enhanced working properties of concrete. Turkey {{is one of the major}} consumers in developing countries regarding chemical <b>admixtures.</b> Therefore, this study set out to determine general utilization and consciousness about <b>admixtures</b> through a survey in Eskisehir, Turkey. The survey was performed by 153 construction professionals. The questions about reasons for preference of <b>admixtures,</b> types of preferred <b>admixtures</b> and dosage, beneficial and adverse effects of <b>admixtures,</b> impacts on cost and judicious use of <b>admixtures</b> are included in the survey. A number of statistical analyses are carried out using SPSS on data obtained. According to results, chemical <b>admixtures</b> are used over 70 % of the total annual concrete production. The initial expectation of the participants in the use of the <b>admixtures</b> is to improve the properties of the fresh concrete. Additionally, the most preferred <b>admixtures</b> are plasticizers. The ensuing types of <b>admixtures</b> are agents affecting the setting time of concrete. Although the participants’ interest to using chemical <b>admixtures</b> is very remarkable, the awareness on this subject is very deficient. The similar studies can be suggested to apply more comprehensively.

The Mughals were descended from Persianised Central Asian Turks (with significant Mongol <b>admixture).</b> In the Mughal era, Uttar Pradesh became the heartland of the empire. Mughal emperors Babur and Humayun ruled from Delhi. In 1540 an Afghan, Sher Shah Suri, took over the reins of Uttar Pradesh after defeating the Mughal king Humanyun. Sher Shah and his son Islam Shah ruled Uttar Pradesh from their capital at Gwalior. After the death of Islam Shah Suri, his prime minister Hemu became the de facto ruler of Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Madhya Pradesh, and the western parts of Bengal. He was bestowed the title of Hemchandra Vikramaditya (title of Vikramāditya adopted from Vedic Period) at his formal coronation took place at Purana Quila in Delhi on 7 October 1556. Hemu died in the Second Battle of Panipat, and Uttar Pradesh came under Emperor Akbar's rule. Akbar ruled from Agra and Fatehpur Sikri. In the 18th century, {{after the fall of}} Mughal authority, the power vacuum was filled by the Maratha Empire, in the mid-18th century, the Maratha army invaded the Uttar Pradesh region, which resulted in Rohillas losing control of Rohillkhand to the Maratha rulers Raghunath Rao and Malharao Holkar. The conflict between Rohillas and Marathas came to an end on 18 December 1788 with the arrest of Ghulam Qadir, the grandson of Najeeb-ud-Daula, who was defeated by the Maratha general Mahadaji Scindia. In 1803, following the Second Anglo-Maratha War, when the British East India Company defeated the Maratha Empire, much of the region came under British suzerainty.|$|E

30|$|Chemical <b>admixtures</b> {{are used}} in the {{production}} of concrete in order to achieve various durability properties. Khayat (1998) reviewed the use of viscosity-enhancing <b>admixtures</b> such as water soluble synthetic and natural organic polymers. Polymers used as <b>admixtures</b> are said to enhance the joining of the mixing constituents as a result of intertwining polymer film which, according to Chung (2004), produces concrete of better mechanical and durability characteristics. Chemical <b>admixtures</b> are used as high range water reducer <b>admixtures</b> (HRWRA) and have impacted on the rheological and mechanical behaviour of cement-based systems. This allows for a latent time that permits casting of concrete in excellent condition. These chemical <b>admixtures</b> are oil based, non-renewable products such as polynaphthalene sulphonate (PNS), polycarboxylate (PC) and polyacrylate (PA). They contain formaldehyde which when accidentally or intentionally released into the environment may result in undesirable environmental toxic effects (Crépy et al. 2011; Akindahunsi et al. 2013). Recently, interest has been developing in the use of organic <b>admixtures</b> to modify various properties in concrete because they are available in abundance; their preparation is not so sophisticated. They are renewable materials, therefore contributing to sustainable green construction. The use of organic <b>admixtures</b> including starch and its derivatives to modify different properties of cement and concrete has been reported by various authors such as: Luke and Luke (2000); Peschard et al.
