Director Wilhelm Jahn had not consulted Richter about Mahler's appointment; Mahler, sensitive to the situation, wrote Richter a complimentary letter expressing unswerving admiration for the older conductor. Subsequently, the two were rarely in agreement, but kept their divisions private.|$|E

Voigt saw Ullrich ride past <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>waited</b> for his captain, before he single-handedly closed the gap to Ullrich. Next day was a time trial up the Alpe d'Huez with 900,000 spectators at the roadside. Voigt was heckled by German fans calling him Judas for his effort to ruin fellow German Ullrich's chances. Voigt criticised German TV-channel ARD for starting a witch-hunt against him and pleaded that he was paid by Team CSC, not Germany and that (as he stated in the documentary Overcoming) thanks to his help, Ullrich won his olympic gold medal in 2000.|$|E

Fred was insistent his wife had no knowledge of her daughter's murder, claiming he had committed this murder as Rose was preoccupied with one of her clients, adding the fact the search team had not yet unearthed Heather's remains was because they had been excavating the wrong section of his garden. He then volunteered to accompany police to the house to pinpoint the precise location of Heather's body. Upon receipt of this confession, Fred's solicitor, Howard Ogden, and his appointed appropriate adult, Janet Leach, informed Mae and Stephen their father had confessed to their sister's murder.

He began a sequel to Trouble at Willow Gables, set in a women's college at Oxford and entitled Michaelmas Term at St Bride's, but did not finish it: [...] "All literary inspiration has deserted me", he informed Amis on 13 August.

With this letter Larkin sent a Coleman poem, [...] "Bliss", the first of seven written in the girls' school idiom.

Campbell of TouchArcade appreciated the [...] variety of puzzles from [...] "twitch" [...] to [...] "slow and thoughtful" [...] to, her favorite, the [...] "cerebral" [...] puzzles that required specific tricks as well as the ability to skip puzzles. She also found the last level nigh impossible. Multiple reviewers felt that the cipher puzzles were out of place, and TouchArcade said it was easy to ignore them as what felt like an [...] "utterly distinct" [...] game. The Atlantic Bogost thought that the hidden ciphers were the [...] "surest clue" [...] of its status as [...] "a design object and not a consumable media experience". Slater of Pocket Gamer wrote that the ciphers felt forced and unexciting, and was disappointed overall in consideration of [...] "the incredible talent involved". Whitehead of Eurogamer called the puzzles [...] "deftly constructed" [...] and said the game [...] "delights more than it frustrates".
