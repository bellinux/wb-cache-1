5|$|Mulder and Scully {{travel to}} NASA and meet Belt, a {{childhood}} hero of Mulder's. Belt, who now manages the shuttle program, dismisses the agents' concerns and states {{that nothing can}} possibly go wrong with the mission. He allows the agents to watch the launch from Mission Control. The launch is successful. As the agents are leaving however, Generoo informs them that contact is lost with the shuttle in orbit. While driving back to Mission Control, Generoo sees the face come <b>at</b> <b>her</b> <b>through</b> her windshield, causing her to crash her car.|$|E
5|$|The bear follows {{and climbs}} {{on top of}} the Jeep, smashing up the car and {{eventually}} overturning it before leaving as the sun sets. Sean wakes up and tells them about the hunting paraphernalia, crying about wanting to go home before he dies. Wes and Lauren turn the Jeep right side up, load him back in the car, then push the Jeep down the hilly road as a thunderstorm hits. Using the downward momentum and occasionally pushing, they arrive near the buildings. While Lauren is exploring the building with the trap, the bear swings <b>at</b> <b>her</b> <b>through</b> a window sending her back against the trap, which impales her back. She returns to the vehicle where the bear rips off the tailgate and drags away Sean's body.|$|E
25|$|During the finale, Hunt shoots Martin Summers dead {{in order}} to save Drake's life and accidentally shoots her afterward. With no witnesses, Hunt is accused of {{attempted}} murder. After being shot, Drake awakes in the present day to be greeted by her surgeon and her daughter Molly, but observes Hunt screaming <b>at</b> <b>her</b> <b>through</b> hospital screens to wake up. She realises that she is now in a comatose state in 1982, and that the 2008 world she has woken into is illusory.|$|E
60|$|She looked <b>at</b> <b>her</b> husband <b>through</b> <b>her</b> {{glasses in}} a calm surprise, as he {{introduced}} Bradley, and stated he had invited him to dinner.|$|R
60|$|Philippa glanced <b>at</b> <b>her</b> friend <b>through</b> the looking-glass before {{which she}} was {{brushing}} her hair, and made a little grimace. She felt a forewarning of what was coming.|$|R
6000|$|... "I have NOT. I {{have not}} seen it, mademoiselle," [...] he said, gazing <b>at</b> <b>her</b> mildly <b>through</b> his glasses, [...] "because it does not exist, and never existed." ...|$|R
60|$|The Prince smiled <b>at</b> <b>her</b> <b>through</b> the gloom--a white, set smile.|$|E
60|$|The boy, peering <b>at</b> <b>her</b> <b>through</b> his spectacles, made no reply.|$|E
60|$|He puffed at his pipe, {{and looked}} dreamily <b>at</b> <b>her</b> <b>through</b> the smoke.|$|E
6000|$|... "You won't {{be angry}} with me?" [...] said Mrs. Wragge, looking timidly <b>at</b> <b>her</b> husband <b>through</b> <b>her</b> tears. [...] "I want a word of comfort, captain. Oh, do tell me, when shall I see her again?" ...|$|R
60|$|Egbert looked <b>at</b> <b>her</b> nervously <b>through</b> his glasses. To get {{the worst}} of an {{argument}} with her was no new experience. To get {{the worst of}} a monologue was a humiliating novelty.|$|R
6000|$|... "Then {{the moral}} is," [...] said Mrs. Pasmer, <b>at</b> <b>her</b> lightest <b>through</b> the {{surrounding}} gravity, [...] "that as all Americans marry for love, only Americans {{who have been}} very good ought to get married." ...|$|R
60|$|Soames {{went to the}} drawing-room presently, {{and peered}} <b>at</b> <b>her</b> <b>through</b> the window.|$|E
60|$|And Charmion, rising, {{stood before}} her, looking <b>at</b> <b>her</b> <b>through</b> the long lashes of her downcast eyes.|$|E
6000|$|... "I suppose," [...] {{the captain}} asked, looking <b>at</b> <b>her</b> <b>through</b> his glass, [...] "you {{satisfied}} yourself that her shaft was really broken?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Mamma!" [...] she said, {{holding her}} head high, and looking <b>at</b> <b>her</b> mother boldly <b>through</b> <b>her</b> tears, [...] "I have never deceived you yet." ...|$|R
60|$|His manner was {{ironically}} courteous, his harsh {{voice was}} pitched in one sardonic monotony of tone. Mercy took an instantaneous dislike to this hobbling, ugly old man, staring <b>at</b> <b>her</b> rudely <b>through</b> his great tortoiseshell spectacles.|$|R
6000|$|Ailie gazed wildly <b>at</b> <b>her</b> {{deliverer}} <b>through</b> <b>her</b> wet {{and tangled}} tresses, {{and with great}} difficulty gasped the word [...] "Yes," [...] while she clenched the garments on her labouring bosom with her little hands, as if to show her determination to do as she was bid.|$|R
6000|$|... "Hullo! Still here?" [...] He blinked approvingly <b>at</b> <b>her</b> <b>through</b> the smoke. [...] "You're {{a little}} soldier! Well, Augustus, what's on your mind?" ...|$|E
60|$|Stephens {{meanwhile}} {{had pushed}} his way to Sadie's beast. She saw his worn earnest face looking up <b>at</b> <b>her</b> <b>through</b> the dim light.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, sir, I am almost sure of it; but I {{should like}} to have another look <b>at</b> <b>her,</b> <b>through</b> your glass, before I speak with certainty." ...|$|E
60|$|All {{this time}} the Guard was looking <b>at</b> <b>her,</b> first <b>through</b> a telescope, then through a microscope, and then through an opera-glass. At last he said, 'You're {{travelling}} the wrong way,' and shut up the window and went away.|$|R
50|$|Lucy would bluff <b>her</b> way <b>through</b> {{anything}} if she wasn't so bad <b>at</b> bluffing <b>her</b> way <b>through</b> everything. She thinks she's independent but needs everyone {{to tell her}} so...|$|R
50|$|Stevenson {{returns to}} Leeds, and {{approaches}} Mollie <b>at</b> <b>her</b> employment. <b>Through</b> artful questioning, he confirms {{she would be}} able to identify her brother's lorry. Torn between the desire to help the police, and his own growing affection for Mollie, he invites her down to his home in Devon for a platonic vacation. She agrees.|$|R
60|$|The man stared <b>at</b> <b>her</b> <b>through</b> his fishy {{eyes for}} a moment in silence, then there broke from his lips a peal of mirthless, uncanny laughter.|$|E
60|$|Anna sat silent a moment, {{wondering}} what he meant; {{and when she}} looked up, she found him pensively staring <b>at</b> <b>her,</b> <b>through</b> a fragrant cloud of smoke.|$|E
6000|$|Absorbed in this reconnoitring, {{she failed}} to observe that darling Derek was looking <b>at</b> <b>her</b> <b>through</b> eyelashes that were always so nice and black. He said suddenly, in that faint and cheerful voice: ...|$|E
60|$|She {{tried to}} smile <b>at</b> me <b>through</b> <b>her</b> tears. We were in the old sitting-room, {{surrounded}} by the books.|$|R
6000|$|... "Mercy is accomplished. And accomplishments {{have their}} charm," [...] {{returned}} his mother, looking <b>at</b> him <b>through</b> <b>her</b> silver spectacles.|$|R
5000|$|The {{power of}} mothers of Persian kings looms large when they shahs {{are at a}} young age. Abbas II's mother had much influence, which was absolute. She queen mother was {{in close contact with}} the prime {{minister}} and they would help each other. Saru Taqi was the agent and confidant of the queen mother; he would gather immense fortunes for her. She governed Persia <b>at</b> <b>her</b> will <b>through</b> <b>her</b> minister.|$|R
60|$|Mr. Craggs {{put on his}} {{spectacles}} to see the better; looked <b>at</b> <b>her</b> <b>through</b> them, {{for some}} time; coughed; and put them, {{with an air of}} satisfaction, in their sheath again, and in his pocket.|$|E
6000|$|He looked <b>at</b> <b>her</b> <b>through</b> his tears, {{and looked}} away again with an abrupt change to distrust. [...] "She doesn't mean it," [...] he muttered, still {{speaking}} to himself; [...] "she only says it to pacify me." ...|$|E
60|$|Her {{composed}} manner, and her low distinct voice, {{always had}} an influence over him. His head was soon in a basin of water, and out of it again, and staring <b>at</b> <b>her</b> <b>through</b> a storm of towelling.|$|E
50|$|Variant H by Cat Staggs {{features}} Rachel and Sarah, with Rachel turned around, staring <b>at</b> highrises <b>through</b> <b>her</b> office windows.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, yes, run along," [...] said Marilla indulgently. [...] "Anne Shirley--are you crazy? Come {{back this}} instant and put {{something}} on you. I {{might as well}} call to the wind. She's gone without a cap or wrap. Look <b>at</b> <b>her</b> tearing <b>through</b> the orchard with her hair streaming. It'll be a mercy if she doesn't catch her death of cold." ...|$|R
60|$|With this earnest caution {{ringing in}} her ears, Hester went forth with Sally to thread the mazes of the town. At first she was terribly frightened, and fancied {{that every one}} who looked <b>at</b> <b>her</b> saw <b>through</b> <b>her</b> disguise, but as time passed and no one took the least notice of her, her natural courage returned, and {{gradually}} she began to observe and {{take an interest in}} the strange persons and things she saw everywhere around her.|$|R
