2500|$|A {{vertical}} bandsaw, {{also called}} a contour saw, keeps the blade's path stationary while the workpiece is moved across it. [...] This type of saw {{can be used}} to cut out complex shapes and angles. [...] The part may be fed into the blade manually or with a power assist mechanism. [...] This type of metal-cutting bandsaw is often equipped with a built-in blade welder. [...] This not only allows the operator to repair broken blades or fabricate new blades quickly, but also allows for the blade to be purposely cut, routed through the center of a part, and re-welded in order to make interior cuts. [...] These saws are often fitted with a built-in <b>air</b> <b>blower</b> to cool the blade and to blow chips away from the cut area giving the operator {{a clear view of the}} work. [...] This type of saw is also built in a woodworking version. [...] The woodworking type is generally of much lighter construction and does not incorporate a power feed mechanism, coolant, or welder.|$|E

5000|$|The {{projection}} {{frame is}} made from PVC coated fabric layers joined by high frequency welding or mechanical sewing. The projection surface can be made of PVC or spandex, which later providing for rear projection capabilities. The projection surface can be detachable for ease of care. The frame is inflated with a high pressure <b>air</b> <b>blower.</b> Larger frames may require a three phase blower. For bigger screens, the blower typically continues to operate, ensuring the screen remains fully inflated. For consumer market and smaller screen sizes, the screen is sealed and does not require constantly operating <b>air</b> <b>blower.</b>|$|E

Many plants, however, use primary clarifiers with mechanical surface skimmers for fat and grease removal.|$|R
5000|$|The concert {{organizers}} deployed colored {{corn starch}} powder in the festivities. The method of powder application at the concert created [...] "an extremely dense dust cloud over {{the stage and}} its immediate vicinity", people near the stage were standing [...] "almost ankle-deep" [...] in colored corn starch powder, and the powder was repeatedly suspended into the <b>air</b> using <b>air</b> <b>blowers</b> as well as compressed gas canisters.|$|R
40|$|As {{the demand}} for {{advanced}} microelectronic devices of small form factor and high power density has increased, the capability of the miniaturized mechanical solutions for effective cooling has become critical. Electrohydrodynamic (EHD) <b>air</b> <b>blowers</b> have great potential as alternative cooling solutions over the traditional mechanical systems to meet the thermal management requirements with flexible design and considerable flow production for effective heat removal. In the present work, a numerical analysis and optimization of wire-to-plane EHD <b>air</b> <b>blowers</b> are performed based on 2 D developed models validated against previous data. For a range of blower heights from 2 to 10 mm, the location and length of the collecting plane located at the blower walls apart from the emitter wire electrode are investigated and optimized based on pumping efficiency using ranges of fixed operating powers and voltages. Simple relations for each optimization method are presented to determine the optimal blower configuration. Results of flow rate and static pressure obtained by each optimized blower show good agreement with those predicted by EHD scaling laws previously presented...|$|R

Further extras were: a laminated wood steering wheel to maintain firm grip (by soaking up sweat), automatic red caution lights on open doors, a reading light, cigar lighter, twin-speaker radio and an <b>air</b> <b>blower</b> to demist the rear window.|$|E
50|$|The third {{category}} of furnace is the forced draft, mid-efficiency furnace with a steel heat exchanger and multi-speed blower. These furnaces were physically much more compact {{than the previous}} styles. They were equipped with combustion <b>air</b> <b>blowers</b> that would pull air through the heat exchanger which greatly increased fuel efficiency while allowing the heat exchangers to become smaller. These furnaces may have multi-speed blowers and were designed to work with central air-conditioning systems.|$|R
50|$|Baseband {{signals to}} be uplinked to a {{spacecraft}} {{must first be}} extracted from ground network packets, encoded, and modulated, typically onto an intermediate frequency (IF) carrier, before being up-converted to the assigned radio frequency (RF) band. The RF signal is then amplified to high power and carried via waveguide to an antenna for transmission. In colder climates, electric heaters or hot <b>air</b> <b>blowers</b> {{may be necessary to}} prevent ice or snow buildup on the parabolic dish.|$|R
30|$|Some farmers used <b>air</b> <b>blowers</b> {{and water}} {{sprayers}} to remove tephra from plants; with particular {{attention paid to}} spinach and tea crops (Table 11). This was time consuming and often not considered cost effective. However, established tea farms successfully used a modified self-propelled sprayer (four purchased with government aid) to wash plants. This method had been developed for use in Kagoshima to mitigate frequent tephra falls from Sakura-jima volcano. The mitigation efforts were credited with a minimal reduction in production during the following season.|$|R

50|$|As {{the film}} is drawn upwards, it is cooled by a ring of <b>air</b> <b>blowers</b> so that the melt first becomes an {{amorphous}} viscoelastic solid, and then a semicrystalline solid, at {{what is known as}} the frost line. After solidification, the blown film tube continues to be cooled as it is pulled up by several sets of rollers, deflating the film to form lay-flat tubing. The flat film is then wound on a spool before further processing or shipping. The height of the film line is often 10 times the diameter of the blown tube or more; film lines in excess of 30 meters are possible.|$|R
50|$|One of {{his early}} {{installations}} was a six-story-high microtonal xylophone (that is, one with smaller intervals between achievable tones than in conventional Western musical scales) running through a spiral staircase in an Amsterdam theater, with computer-driven melodies ripping up and down it. Another piece was a water fountain installation in which drops of water, timed in complex rhythmic fugues, dripped into glass receptacles. Several of his pieces since that time have made similar use of falling water. A dance piece used the dancers' bodies to make music, with small bellows in the dancers' shoes that played duck calls, <b>air</b> <b>blowers</b> triggered by sacs under their armpits, etc.|$|R
5000|$|The Roots type blower {{is named}} after the American inventors and {{brothers}} Philander and Francis Marion Roots, founders of the Roots Blower Company of Connersville, Indiana USA, who patented the basic design in 1860 as an air pump for use in blast furnaces and other industrial applications. In 1900, Gottlieb Daimler included a Roots-style blower in a patented engine design, making the Roots-type blower {{the oldest of the}} various designs now available. Roots blowers are commonly referred to as <b>air</b> <b>blowers</b> or PD (positive displacement) blowers, and can be commonly called [...] "huffers" [...] when used with the gasoline-burning engines in hot rod customized cars.|$|R

Both of these larger and more {{powerful}} designs are less commonly described as blowtorches, while the term blowtorch is usually reserved for the smaller and less powerful self-contained torches.

50|$|Small irons heated by a battery, or by {{combustion}} {{of a gas}} such as butane in a small self-contained tank, can be {{used when}} electricity is unavailable or cordless operation is required. The operating temperature of these irons is not regulated directly; gas irons may change power by adjusting gas flow. Gas-powered irons may have interchangeable tips including different size soldering tips, hot knife for cutting plastics, miniature blow-torch with a hot flame, and small hot <b>air</b> <b>blower</b> for such applications as shrinking heat shrink tubing.|$|E
5000|$|The {{music video}} for [...] "Synchronicity II" [...] was {{directed}} by Godley & Creme, filmed at a sound stage {{on the outskirts of}} London. In it the band are seen performing on top of giant piles of guitars, drums, junk, car parts, wires, with debris and papers flying about, punctuated by footage of Loch Ness for each chorus. The band members stood apart from each other on separate towers made of scaffolding, wearing dystopian outfits. A misty and stormy appearance was created with <b>air</b> <b>blowers</b> and dry ice. During the filming, Copeland's tower caught fire and the crew started to leave the building. Creme told the director of photography to keep the cameras rolling despite the danger.|$|R
