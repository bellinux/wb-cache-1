500|$|The {{members of}} DecembeRadio all began playing music in their teens. [...] Josh Reedy and Brian Bunn {{attended}} the same schools, and the former's rendition of [...] "Johnny B. Goode" [...] on guitar at {{a middle school}} talent show convinced Bunn to take up guitar, as well. [...] "Our first year of high school, we started a Top 40 band. We played Hootie & the Blowfish covers <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> <b>thing.</b> Then shortly thereafter, we realized that God had given us these gifts, {{and we wanted to}} utilize them for him," [...] recalled Bunn. [...] The pair decided to pursue music full-time upon graduation from Auburn High School in Riner, Virginia.|$|E
2500|$|People {{talk about}} [...] "chav behaviour" [...] or [...] "chav insults" [...] <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> <b>thing.</b> Oh, don't believe the popular etymologies {{that you read}} {{sometimes}} {{in the press and}} on websites. I saw one the other day, people said, [...] "It's an acronym, 'chav', from 'council house and violent'"—well, no, it isn't, that was made up in recent times.|$|E
2500|$|Kelley {{said that}} his {{greatest}} thrill at Star Trek conventions {{was the number of}} people who told him they entered the medical profession because of the McCoy character. He received two or three letters a month from others reporting similar experiences. A friend observed that despite not becoming a doctor as he had hoped, Kelley's portrayal of McCoy had helped create many doctors. According to Kelley, [...] "You can win awards <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> <b>thing,</b> but to influence the youth of the country ... is an award that is not handed out by the industry".|$|E
6000|$|... 'Well, she's only thirteen. You can't {{blame the}} kid. Seemed to me a jolly healthy symptom. Laudable {{ambition}} <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> thing.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Perhaps," [...] Jeff suggested, [...] "they'd rather {{make their}} own dinner by a campfire. Must be very jolly, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> thing." ...|$|R

2500|$|Thompson {{was raised}} in the Church of Christ. According to Thompson, his values come from [...] "sitting around the kitchen table" [...] with his parents, and from the Church of Christ. While talking to reporters in South Carolina, Thompson said, [...] "I attend church when I'm in Tennessee. I'm [...] in McLean right now. I don't attend {{regularly}} when I'm up there." [...] On occasion, Thompson attended Vienna Presbyterian Church in Vienna, Virginia. He did not speak much about his religion during his campaign, saying, [...] "Me getting up and talking about what a wonderful person I am <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> <b>thing,</b> I'm not comfortable with that, and I don't think it does me any good." ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{addition}} to Josephine's concealing Wyatt's past relationship with Blaylock, modern researchers think she {{may also have}} been trying to conceal her own past as a [...] "sporting lady" [...] or prostitute. While prostitutes were ostracized by [...] "respectable" [...] women, many madams and prostitutes had more control of their lives and greater independence than other women. Josephine always sought excitement in her life. In the book I Married Wyatt Earp (1967), based on a manuscript which she purportedly wrote, author Glenn Boyer quotes her as saying, [...] "I liked the traveling sort of man... better than the kind that sat back in one town all his life and wrote down little rows of figures all day or hustled dry goods or groceries <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> <b>thing...</b> My blood demanded excitement, variety and change." [...] The type of work available to most women in that era was as laundresses, seamstresses, or other dull work which Josephine avoided.|$|E

6000|$|... "Silver paper {{seems to}} be rather more for cake <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> thing," [...] {{suggested}} Boardman. [...] "Kind of mourning too, isn't it--silver?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Think he'd play if I put him down? Because, you know, I'm dashed if I'm {{going to}} do any grovelling <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> thing.' ...|$|R
60|$|THE YOUNG LADY. Of course not: {{anybody can}} see that. I meant sisters and mother <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> <b>thing.</b>|$|E

6000|$|... "No, {{there is}} no {{personal}} likeness; but I meant in age <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> <b>thing.</b> I think, altogether, {{we have a very}} homelike look." ...|$|E
5000|$|... "At {{the time}} I loved Lou Reed, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> rock, <b>and</b> 'Marlena' sounded good with Marlene Dietrich. We had 'Berlin', so let's have Marlena." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Do {{you really}} think so?" [...] she asked. [...] "The Germans seem such civilised people, so {{peaceful}} and domestic in their home life, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> thing." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{is better}} than {{grinding}} away at Latin and Greek <b>and</b> mathematics, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> thing," [...] the younger of the two sergeants said with a smile.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, but {{generally}} {{do you find}} very much--oh, courtesy <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> <b>thing</b> among mechanics, as much as among what calls itself 'the better class'?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] said Mr. Brooke, [...] "this {{would be}} a pretty room with some new hangings, sofas, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> <b>thing.</b> A little bare now." ...|$|E
6000|$|... “I {{should think}} you’d {{have a few}} little benches—rustic seats <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> <b>thing.</b> It might really be so jolly to ‘develop’ the place,” he suggested.|$|E
6000|$|... "No," [...] George said, [...] "not <b>that</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> thing; but she {{was talking}} of things in general. Of doing things that were wrong, such as telling lies <b>and</b> deceiving, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> thing." ...|$|R

60|$|GERALD. Dear mother, {{how can you}} say so? Of course Lord Illingworth is awfully clever <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> <b>thing.</b> There {{is nothing}} Lord Illingworth doesn't know.|$|E
6000|$|... "Indeed, I {{am glad to}} hear it. You must {{be easily}} satisfied, have an Arcadian mind, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> <b>thing.</b> Take some whisky, and light your pipe." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Not in {{a regular}} battle. You see England is not at war now with anyone, but I have been {{in two or three}} fights with pirates <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> thing." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Gad, I don't know, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> thing," [...] {{said the}} Baronet. [...] "It ain't so bad neither. Whenever {{he wants a}} thing, Frank always cwies, and {{whenever}} he cwies he gets it." ...|$|R
