5|$|During {{the year}} after Khánh's rise to power, Thi helped Khánh stage or put down several coup attempts, making him <b>a</b> <b>key</b> <b>player</b> <b>in</b> South Vietnamese {{military}} politics. In September 1964, he and Kỳ helped rescue Khánh from a coup attempt by two disgruntled Catholic Diệmist generals, Lâm Văn Phát and Dương Văn Đức. This gave Kỳ and Thi increased leverage in the junta. Two months later, he was prominent in shutting down a junta-appointed civilian advisory body after they disapproved of a plan by younger officers to compulsorily retire old generals. In January 1965, he helped Khánh depose the junta-appointed civilian Prime Minister Trần Văn Hương, but by this time he had turned against Khánh. In February 1965, he helped defeat a coup attempt by Phát and Phạm Ngọc Thảo, and helped to force Khánh's resignation at the same time. Over the next year, Kỳ and Thi were the foremost officers in the junta, and in June 1965, Thi declined an opportunity to serve as prime minister after being nominated by his fellow officers following the resignation of civilian Phan Huy Quát. Thi wanted to let a rival take the job and then step in after he had failed, but he never received a second opportunity.|$|E

5|$|Raphel {{entered her}} State Department {{assignment}} {{at a time}} when U.S.-Pakistan relations were strained. Sanctions imposed by George H. W.

Bhutto sought rapprochement with the Clinton White House, and Raphel became <b>a</b> <b>key</b> <b>player</b> <b>in</b> orchestrating the renewal of ties, visiting the United States in April 1995. Raphel, working with Pakistan's envoy to Washington at the time, Dr. Maleeha Lodhi, helped craft administration policy changes and build Congressional support that would ultimately become law through repeal of the Pressler Amendment. The Brown Amendment was put into effect in November 1995. It restored U.S.-Pakistan relations and allowed Raphel to proceed apace in executing U.S. energy objectives in the region, now with new-found support from the Pakistani military for restoring military-to-military ties and its civilian government for insuring return of funds paid by Pakistan to the United States for undelivered F-16 fighter jets.|$|E

40|$|Intake {{of fruits}} and {{vegetables}} has been negatively correlated with bladder cancer (BC), while its underlined mechanism remains unknown. Here, the numbers of Clostridium cluster XI and Prevotella were diminished in BC patients whose fruits intake were largely lower than that in healthy subjects. Quantities of butyric acid in feces and iso-butyric acid in cecal contents, were reduced in BC patients and BC mice, respectively. Furthermore, the loss of goblet cells and visible breakage of the mucosal epithelium in the colon and cecum as well as the downregulations of zo- 1 /occludin /claudin- 1 were obviously observed. The concentrations of lipopolysaccharide and D-lactic acid, two sensitive markers of gut permeability, were also increased.
