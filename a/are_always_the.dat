5|$|Prosperity {{theology}} (sometimes {{referred to}} as the prosperity gospel, the health and wealth gospel, or the gospel of success) is a religious belief among some Christians, who hold that financial blessing and physical well-being <b>are</b> <b>always</b> <b>the</b> will of God for them, and that faith, positive speech, and donations to religious causes will increase one's material wealth. Prosperity theology views the Bible as a contract between God and humans: if humans have faith in God, he will deliver security and prosperity.|$|E
5|$|There {{are several}} other {{different}} types of historic preservation associated with {{the properties of the}} National Register of Historic Places that cannot be classified as either simple buildings and historic districts. Through the National Park Service, the National Register of Historic Places publishes a series of bulletins designed to aid in evaluating and applying the criteria for evaluation of {{different types of}} properties. Although the criteria <b>are</b> <b>always</b> <b>the</b> same, the manner they are applied may differ slightly, depending upon the type of property involved. The National Register bulletins describe application of the criteria for aids to navigation, historic battlefields, archaeological sites, aviation properties, cemeteries, and burial places, historic designed landscapes, mining sites, post offices, properties associated with significant persons, properties achieving significance within the last fifty years, rural historic landscapes, traditional cultural properties, and vessels and shipwrecks.|$|E

25|$|When {{they get}} back to the classroom, they wordlessly return to their cages, and their hats and capes come off. The Flyboat also disassembles by itself. Ming-Ming <b>is</b> <b>always</b> <b>the</b> first one to get back in her cage, Tuck <b>is</b> <b>always</b> <b>the</b> second, and Linny <b>is</b> <b>always</b> <b>the</b> last. A music style having to do with that day's rescue is played, as Linny takes a bite out of the celery in her cage and winks towards the camera as the closing credits begin.|$|R

25|$|A Bézier {{curve is}} defined {{by a set of}} control points P0 through Pn, where n is called its order (n = 1 for linear, 2 for quadratic, etc.). The first and last control points <b>are</b> <b>always</b> <b>the</b> end points of the curve; however, the {{intermediate}} control points (if any) generally do not lie on the curve. The sums in the following sections are to be understood as affine combinations, the coefficients sum to 1.|$|E
25|$|The ides {{occur on}} the thirteenth day in eight of the months, but in March, May, July, and October, they {{occur on the}} fifteenth. The nones always occur 8 days (one Roman week) before the ides, i.e., on the fifth or the seventh. The calends <b>are</b> <b>always</b> <b>the</b> {{first day of the}} month, and before Julius Caesar's reform fell sixteen days (two Roman weeks) after the ides (except the ides of February and the {{intercalary}} month).|$|E

25|$|A {{synchronization}} packet (commonly {{known as}} the timing reference signal or TRS) occurs immediately before the first active sample on every line, and immediately after the last active sample (and {{before the start of}} the horizontal blanking region). The synchronization packet consists of four 10-bit words, the first three words <b>are</b> <b>always</b> <b>the</b> same—0x3FF, 0, 0; the fourth consists of 3 flag bits, along with an error correcting code. As a result, there are 8 different synchronization packets possible.|$|E

As David Frankel noted in Artforum, ”she seems both a familiar presence {{and at the same}} time unknowable, one multifaceted figure- she is all of them-but at the same time non-of them at all… Starr proposes a model of art-making and combines the baroque with the spontaneous….the frame is fiction".|$|E
25|$|Monozygotic {{twins are}} genetically nearly {{identical}} and they <b>are</b> <b>always</b> <b>the</b> same sex unless {{there has been}} a mutation during development. The children of monozygotic twins test genetically as half-siblings (or full siblings, if a pair of monozygotic twins reproduces with another pair or with the same person), rather than first cousins. Identical twins {{do not have the same}} fingerprints, because even in the confines of the womb, the fetuses touch different parts of this environment, which gives small variations in the same fingerprint, making them unique.|$|E

25|$|There {{are several}} {{other types of}} {{properties}} that do not fall neatly into the categories listed above. The National Park Service publishes a series of bulletins designed to aid in evaluating properties for NRHP eligibility using the criteria for evaluation. Though the criteria for eligibility <b>are</b> <b>always</b> <b>the</b> same, {{the way they are}} applied can differ slightly, depending upon the type of property involved. Special Register bulletins cover application of the criteria for evaluation of: aids to navigation, historic battlefields, archaeological sites, aviation properties, cemeteries and burial places, historic designed landscapes, mining sites, post offices, properties associated with significant persons, properties achieving significance within the last 50 years, rural historic landscapes, traditional cultural properties, and vessels and shipwrecks.|$|E
25|$|The Governor-General {{provides}} {{leadership in}} the community. Governors-General <b>are</b> <b>always</b> <b>the</b> patrons of many charitable, service, sporting and cultural organisations. The sponsorship or patronage of the Governor-General signals that an organisation is worthy of wide support. Many of the Governor-General's community functions also have a ceremonial dimension, such as attendance at the official openings of buildings, addresses to open conferences, or launching special events and appeals. The Governor-General spends {{a large share of}} his or her working time attending state banquets and functions, making and hosting state visits, meeting ceremonial groups, and awarding medals, decorations, and prizes. As well as attending public events, the Governor-General hosts many community functions at Government House. In a typical year, over 15,000 people will attend such events.|$|E
25|$|Even {{though the}} {{principles}} of focal ratio <b>are</b> <b>always</b> <b>the</b> same, the application to which the principle is put can differ. In photography the focal ratio varies the focal-plane illuminance (or optical power per unit area in the image) and is used to control variables such as depth of field. When using an optical telescope in astronomy, there is no depth of field issue, and the brightness of stellar point sources in terms of total optical power (not divided by area) {{is a function of}} absolute aperture area only, independent of focal length. The focal length controls the field of view of the instrument and the scale of the image that is presented at the focal plane to an eyepiece, film plate, or CCD.|$|E

25|$|In the Vulgate Cycle, he is {{depicted}} as a proud and worldly knight who demonstrates through his failures the danger of neglecting the spirit for the futile gifts of the material world. On the Grail quest, his intentions <b>are</b> <b>always</b> <b>the</b> purest, but {{he is unable to}} use God's grace to see the error in his ways. Later, when his brothers Agravain and Mordred plot to destroy Lancelot and Guinevere by exposing their love affair, Gawain tries to stop them. When Guinevere is sentenced to burn at the stake and Arthur deploys his best knights to guard the execution, Gawain nobly refuses {{to take part in the}} deed even though his brothers will be there. But when Lancelot returns to rescue Guinevere, a battle between Lancelot's and Arthur's knights ensues and Gawain's brothers, except for Mordred, are killed. This turns his friendship with Lancelot into hatred, and his desire for vengeance causes him to draw Arthur into a war with Lancelot in France. In the king's absence, Mordred usurps the throne, and the Britons must return to save Britain. Gawain is mortally wounded in battle against Mordred's armies, and writes to Lancelot apologizing for his actions and asking for him to come to Britain to help defeat Mordred.|$|E
25|$|The Curia Urbis or the Vicariate of the City of Rome {{was divided}} into four {{departments}} (officia), of which the second is again divided into four sections. The first department (officium) has under its care all the church services and the Apostolic visitation of the diocese. The second department watches over the behaviour of the clergy and the Christian people. Judicial matters are settled in the third department, and the fourth department {{is devoted to the}} economic administration of the entire vicariate. The head of all these bureaus is the cardinal who is the vicar-general of the pope in Rome. His office and the extent of his power <b>are</b> <b>always</b> <b>the</b> same and are permanent, so that they do not cease even when the Papal See is vacant. This fact distinguishes the cardinal vicar as he is called, for the designation is not an official title, from all other vicars-general in the world, and gives him his peculiar legal position. In the same way it is a noticeable exception that the four departments can carry on their customary business, even when the vicar is not able to supervise what is done on account of the conclave or of some other impediment. Even should the vicar die the work of the departments goes quietly on. Formerly {{this was not the case}} to so large a degree, as is shown by the deputation of 17 December 1876, on the death of Cardinal Vicar Patrizi.|$|E
500|$|A Swiss newspaper, {{who called}} Raëlians [...] "rat heads", was sued for defamation. Another suit was brought against {{journalist}} Stephane Baillargeon for {{writing in the}} Montreal daily Le Devoir that the Raëlians defended pedophiles and that certain ex-Raëlians claimed the [...] "gourou" [...] liked very young girls. After some negotiation, Le Devoir published a letter from Raël condemning the charge as [...] "ignominious defamation" [...] and asserting that the Raëlian Movement had [...] "always condemned pedophilia and promoted respect for laws that justly forbid the practices that <b>are</b> <b>always</b> <b>the</b> fault of unbalanced individuals".|$|E

500|$|Edmondson's casting in {{the role}} {{followed}} a trend remarked upon by television critic Jim Shelley, who noted a tendency of Holby City producers toward hiring already well established actors, including Jesus of Nazareth star Robert Powell and actress Patsy Kensit. [...] When asked in November 2007 whether she actively sought out well-known names to fill new roles in the show, series producer Diana Kyle responded: [...] "It's lovely {{when we have a}} new member of the cast come in and bring an audience with them. But we want the best actors, and the star names we cast <b>are</b> <b>always</b> <b>the</b> best - which is why we go for them!" ...|$|E
500|$|Although {{scandium}} and yttrium <b>are</b> <b>always</b> <b>the</b> {{first two}} elements in group 3, {{the identity of}} the next two elements is not completely settled. They are commonly lanthanum and actinium, and less often lutetium and lawrencium. The two variants originate from historical difficulties in placing the lanthanides in the periodic table, and arguments as to where the f block elements start and end. It has been claimed that such arguments are proof that, [...] "it is a mistake to break the [...] system into sharply delimited blocks". A third variant shows the two positions below yttrium as being occupied by the lanthanides and the actinides.|$|E
500|$|Critics reacted {{positively}} towards Lucas' {{development in}} the ninth series.

[...] Vicky Frost of The Guardian stated that Spooks was [...] "looking a bit lacklustre," [...] but now [...] "seems to have raised its game" [...] because of several developments for series nine, including the closing scenes involving Lucas and Vaughn, and his relationship with Dimitri Levendis. The Daily Mail Weekend Magazine stated [...] "will he really {{turn out to be a}} bad guy?
