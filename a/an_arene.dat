2500|$|<b>A</b> <b>Bene</b> Gesserit who survives {{the ritual}} spice agony gains access to Other Memory, the {{combined}} ego and memories {{of all her}} female ancestors. An adult Reverend Mother can manage {{the presence of these}} subordinate inner voices because she has a full personality of her own and a solid sense of self. However, if <b>a</b> <b>Bene</b> Gesserit undergoes the agony while pregnant, the fetus will also experience it, acquiring full consciousness and access to Other Memory. Since the child has not yet developed a sufficiently strong ego before being exposed to her tide of ancestors, she is more susceptible to their influence, and there is a danger that she will ultimately be overcome and possessed by a strong ancestral ego. The Bene Gesserit call this [...] "Abomination," [...] and such children are killed immediately. They are also referred to as [...] "pre-born" [...] in Children of Dune.|$|R
50|$|As {{established}} in the appendix of Dune (1965), Wensicia is the third daughter of the 81st Padishah Emperor Shaddam IV and Anirul, <b>a</b> <b>Bene</b> Gesserit of Hidden Rank. Her oldest sister is the Princess Irulan; her three other siblings are sisters Chalice, Josifa and Rugi. Wensicia accompanies her father into exile on Salusa Secundus after he is deposed by Paul Atreides in Dune.|$|R
2500|$|Bene Gesserit {{are trained}} in [...] "the {{minutiae}} of observation", noticing details that the common person would miss in the people and environment around them. When combined with their analytical abilities, this [...] "hyperawareness" [...] makes the Bene Gesserit capable of divining secrets and arriving at conclusions that are invisible to everyone else. Slight differences in air currents or {{the design of a}} room might allow <b>a</b> <b>Bene</b> Gesserit to detect hidden portals and spyholes; minute variations in a person's vocal inflection and body language allow <b>a</b> <b>Bene</b> Gesserit to deeply understand a person's emotional state, and manipulate it. Knowing that any schooling impresses a particular pattern in its students, they are able to use these clues to predict and anticipate actions. Despite efforts of concealment, the Bene Gesserit can easily determine a subject's origins and root language by analyzing their speech patterns, cadence, and pacing, as Jessica does when she realizes that a visiting Spacing Guild banker is a Harkonnen agent.|$|R
50|$|Nucleophilic {{abstraction}} {{can occur}} on a ligand of a metal if {{the conditions are}} right. For instance the following example shows the nucleophilic abstraction of H+ from <b>an</b> <b>arene</b> ligand attached to chromium. The electron withdrawing nature of the chromium allows for the reaction to occur as a facile reaction.|$|E
50|$|An Aryl radical {{in organic}} {{chemistry}} is a reactive intermediate and <b>an</b> <b>arene</b> compound incorporating one free radical carbon atom {{as part of}} the ring structure. As such it is the radical counterpart of the Arenium ion. The parent compound is the phenyl radical C6H5.. Aryl radicals are intermediates in certain organic reactions.|$|E
5000|$|An alkyne trimerisation {{reaction}} is a 2+2+2 cyclization reaction in which three molecules of alkyne {{react to form}} <b>an</b> <b>arene.</b> The reaction requires metal catalysts. The process is of historic interest {{as well as being}} applicable to organic synthesis. [...] Many variations have been developed including cyclization of mixtures of alkynes and alkenes as well as alkynes and nitriles.|$|E
50|$|A rearrangeably nonblocking {{network of}} this type with m = n = 2 is {{generally}} called <b>a</b> <b>Beneš</b> network, {{even though it was}} discussed and analyzed by others before Václav E. Beneš. The number of inputs and outputs is N = r&times;n = 2r. Such networks have 2&thinsp;log2N &minus; 1 stages, each containing N/2 2&times;2 crossbar switches, and use a total of N&thinsp;log2N &minus; N/2 2&times;2 crossbar switches. For example, <b>an</b> 8&times;8 <b>Benes</b> network (i.e. with N = 8) is shown below; it has 2&thinsp;log28 &minus; 1 = 5 stages, each containing N/2 = 4 2&times;2 crossbar switches, and it uses a total of N&thinsp;log2N &minus; N/2 = 20 2&times;2 crossbar switches. The central three stages consist of two smaller 4&times;4 Benes networks, while in the center stage, each 2&times;2 crossbar switch may itself be regarded as <b>a</b> 2&times;2 <b>Benes</b> network. This example therefore highlights the recursive construction of this type of network.|$|R
50|$|In Heretics of Dune (1984), one {{descendant}} of Siona Atreides is Miles Teg, renowned {{commander of the}} military forces of the Bene Gesserit, who bears a remarkable resemblance to his ancestor, Duke Leto I. Teg's secret daughter is Darwi Odrade (a variant on Atreides), <b>a</b> <b>Bene</b> Gesserit sister who eventually becomes Mother Superior of the Sisterhood during their ongoing struggle with the fierce Honored Matres.|$|R
2500|$|The term [...] "Yehudi" [...] and its {{variants}} {{remains a}} word of serious derision when directed at <b>a</b> <b>Bene</b> Israel or anyone else as noted by Reverend John Wilson, {{one of the founders}} of University of Bombay (now University of Mumbai). The Bene Israel's prayers include intercessions on behalf of Her Majesty as in several Commonwealth countries. The Jewish Chronicle of London reported on Karachi’s Jews as recently as 2007.|$|R
