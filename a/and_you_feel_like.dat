They did praise that the hard drive of the Super Slim model is [...] "the easiest yet. Simply sliding off the side panel reveals the drive bay, which can quickly be unscrewed."They also stated that whilst the Super Slim model is not in any way an upgrade, it could be an indicator as to what's to come. [...] "It may not be revolutionary, but the Super Slim PS3 is the same impressive machine in a much smaller package. There doesn't seem to be any reason for existing PS3 owners to upgrade, but for the prospective PS3 buyer, the Super Slim is probably the way to go if you can deal with not having a slot-loading disc drive." ...|$|E

Youth Voice and Planning With a little help from adults, there’s nothing you as 4 -H youth can’t do. You can plan projects, do the service, evaluate the program, celebrate your efforts – everything! As a leader, you can learn more <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>feel</b> <b>like</b> you have more to say in the project. So, gather your ideas, find some friends, an adult volunteer leader, and your 4 -H agent and start planning! 2. Community Need and Voice The first step in your planning is to take a good look at your community. Is there a nursing home or day care nearby? Does the park have a lot of litter? Do the neighborhood children have a play-ground? By looking at the world around you, you can learn more about your community than yo...|$|E
40|$|The {{first time}} I {{started to get}} {{interested}} in doing something with BCI was because of a small message on the HMI web site that there was room for such research. The first impression always sparks a lot of ideas and wild speculations {{on what to do}} with it. Of course this enthusiasm always gets crushed and you learn what BCI actually is. It means that a lot of work needs to be done often for seemingly small results. But when you start to gain knowledge, you actually start to appreciate the accomplishments even more. You realize that what you’re doing is only very small. Nonetheless, I hope that you as a reader enjoy reading this thesis and more important, actually learn something from it. I hope this document can function as a starting guide into BCI for other students that want to learn about BCI or work with it themselves. The BCI research at the HMI department is just starting to form, so {{there is a lot of}} work to be done. If this document can spark the interest of students to continue with the work presented in this or other documents, I am very happy with that. This document would not be here, if it weren’t for several other people besides me. I would of course like to thank my tutors for their help. Because BCI is new within HMI, this has been a learning experience for both me and them. I would also like to thank Niels Bloom and Marijn van Vliet, with whom I started off in our quest for BCI knowledge. Especially Marijn has been very helpful in assisting with the experiments and verifying my results. I hope you as a reader enjoy reading this document <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>feel</b> <b>like</b> you’ve learned something in the process too!...|$|E
