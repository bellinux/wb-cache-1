40|$|The {{reduction}} of ambient concentrations of fine particulate matter (PM 2. 5) {{is a key}} objective for air pollution control policies in the UK and elsewhere. Long-term exposure to PM 2. 5 {{has been identified as}} a major contributor to adverse human health effects in epidemiological studies and underpins ambient PM 2. 5 legislation. As a range of emission sources and atmospheric chemistry transport processes contribute to PM 2. 5 concentrations, atmospheric chemistry transport models are an essential tool to assess emissions control effectiveness. The EMEP 4 UK atmospheric chemistry transport model was used to investigate the impact of reductions in UK anthropogenic emissions of primary PM 2. 5, NH 3, NO x, SO x or non-methane VOC on surface concentrations of PM 2. 5 in the UK for a recent year (2010) and for a future current legislation emission (CLE) scenario (2030). In general, the sensitivity to UK mitigation is rather small. A 30  % reduction in UK emissions of any one of the above components yields (for the 2010 simulation) a maximum reduction in PM 2. 5 in any given location of [*]∼[*]  0. 6  µg m − 3 (equivalent to [*]∼[*]  6  % of the modelled PM 2. 5). On average across the UK, the sensitivity of PM 2. 5 concentrations to a 30  % reduction in UK emissions of individual contributing components, for both the 2010 and 2030 CLE baselines, increases in the order NMVOC, NO x, SO x, NH 3 and primary PM 2. 5; however there are strong spatial differences in the PM 2. 5 sensitivities across the UK. Consequently, the sensitivity of PM 2. 5 to individual component emissions reductions varies between area and population weighting. Reductions in NH 3 have the greatest effect on area-weighted PM 2. 5. A full UK population weighting places greater emphasis on reductions of primary PM 2. 5 emissions, which is simulated to be the most effective single-component control on PM 2. 5 for the 2030 scenario. An important conclusion is that weighting corresponding to the <b>average</b> <b>exposure</b> <b>indicator</b> metric (using data from the 45 model grids containing a monitor whose measurements are used to calculate the UK AEI) further increases the emphasis on the effectiveness of primary PM 2. 5 emissions reductions (and of NO x emissions reductions) relative to the effectiveness of NH 3 emissions reductions. Reductions in primary PM 2. 5 have the largest impact on the AEI in both 2010 and the 2030 CLE scenario. The summation of the modelled reductions to the UK PM 2. 5 AEI from 30  % reductions in UK emissions of primary PM 2. 5, NH 3, SO x, NO x and VOC totals 1. 17 and 0. 82  µg m − 3 for the 2010 and 2030 CLE simulations, respectively (not accounting for non-linearity) ...|$|E

The cohort involved 35, 443 workers employed during 1945 - 1991 in the reinforced plastics industry, where high exposures to styrene occur. <b>Indicators</b> of <b>exposure</b> were reconstructed through job histories and environmental and biologic monitoring data Poisson regression was used for internal comparisons.

40|$|International audience: Environmental {{epidemiological}} studies {{rely on the}} quantification of the exposure level in a surface defined as the subject's exposure area. For residential exposure, this area is often the subject's neighborhood. However, the variability of the size {{and nature of the}} neighborhoods makes comparison of the findings across studies difficult. This article examines the impact of the neighborhood's definition on environmental noise exposure levels obtained from four commonly used sampling techniques: address point, façade, buffers, and official zoning. A high-definition noise model, built on a middle-sized French city, has been used to estimate LAeq, 24 [*]h exposure in the vicinity of 10, 825 residential buildings. Twelve noise <b>exposure</b> <b>indicators</b> have been used to assess inhabitants' exposure. Influence of urban environmental factors was analyzed using multilevel modeling. When the sampled area increases, the <b>average</b> <b>exposure</b> increases (+ 3. 9 [*]dB), whereas the SD decreases (- 1. 6 [*]dB) (P< 0. 01). Most of the indicators differ statistically. When comparing indicators from the 50 -m and 400 -m radius buffers, the assigned LAeq, 24 [*]h level varies across buildings from - 9. 4 to + 22. 3 [*]dB. This variation is influenced by urban environmental characteristics (P< 0. 01). On the basis of this study's findings, sampling technique, neighborhood size, and environmental composition should be carefully considered in further exposure studies.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we disentangle, {{analytically}} and empirically, {{the roles of}} the unit-exposure restriction in Heston and Rouwenhorst (1994). We show that if the purpose is to construct factors, the unit-exposure variance-analysis model can be viewed as just an algorithm that does not really assume a return-generating process; and in practice the effect of relaxing the restriction is immaterial. The restriction is more important if one wants to estimate whether, for a typical stock, the country factor generates more variance than the sector factor: exposure estimation becomes more important (i) the further the <b>average</b> <b>exposures</b> are from unity; or (ii) the higher the dispersion of the exposures. With respect to (i), the more important the corrections for sector (or geographical) structure in country (or sector) factors are, the more the <b>average</b> <b>exposure</b> falls below unity. Thus, the <b>average</b> <b>exposure</b> provides an alternative indicator of the importance of country versus sector effects. We empirically find that the <b>average</b> sector <b>exposure</b> is low (0. 3) compared to the <b>average</b> country <b>exposure</b> (0. 9). With respect to (ii) we correct the dispersion of exposures for estimation error in the exposures. We find that in our sample these estimation error corrections are more important for sector factors than for country factors, and that country factors are generating far more variance, in a typical stock's return, than do sector factors. © 2010 Elsevier B.

40|$|Studies {{indicate}} that computed radiography (CR) {{can lead to}} increased radiation dose to patients. It is therefore important to relate the <b>exposure</b> <b>indicators</b> provided by CR manufacturers to the radiation dose delivered so as to assess the radiation dose delivered to patients directly from the <b>exposure</b> <b>indicators.</b> The {{aim of this study}} was to investigate the performance of an Agfa CR system in order to characterize the dose indicators provided by the system. The imaging plate response was characterized in terms of entrance exposure to the plate and the digital signal indicators generated by the system (SAL - Scanning Average Level and lgM - Logarithmic median) for different beam qualities. Several exposures were performed on a mammography unit and the digital signal, expressed as SAL and lgM for each image was correlated with the entrance exposure on a standard ACR phantom. From this, the relationship between the Agfa dose indices (SAL and lgM) and the average glandular dose (AGD) in mammography was established. An equation was derived to calculate the AGD delivered to the patient as a function of the <b>exposure</b> <b>indicator,</b> lgM, and the kV. The results indicated that the measured AGD at 28 kV for a standard breast thickness during routine calibration with the ACR phantom was 1. 58 mGy (lgM = 1. 99), which is within 1. 5 % of the value calculated using the derived equation for a standard Perspex thickness of 4. 2 cm using the AEC (1. 56 mGy).

Reject analysis program (RAP) and <b>exposure</b> <b>indicator</b> data were collected and analyzed during a 1 -year period. RAP data were sorted both by reason for repetition and body part examined.

METHODS: This was an ecological study using an environmental <b>exposure</b> <b>indicator</b> presented {{as the percentage of}} annual hours (AH%) of PM 2. 5 above 80 &# 956;g/m 3. The outcome variables were the rates of hospitalization due to respiratory disease among children, the elderly and the intermediate age group, and due to childbirth. Data were obtained from the National Space Research Institute and the Ministry of Health for all of the microregions of the Brazilian Amazon region, for the years 2004 and 2005. Multiple regression models for the outcome variables in relation to the predictive variable AH% of PM 2. 5 above 80 &# 956;g/m 3 were analyzed. The Human Development Index (HDI) and mean number of complete blood counts per 100 inhabitants in the Brazilian Amazon region were the control variables in the regression analyses. RESULTS: The association of the <b>exposure</b> <b>indicator</b> (AH%) was higher for the elderly than for other age groups (&# 946; = 0. 10).
