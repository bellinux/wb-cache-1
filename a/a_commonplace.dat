5|$|From 1357 onwards parliaments {{began to}} be {{referred}} to as the Three Estates, adopting the language of social organisation that had developed in France in the eleventh century. It was composed of the clergy, nobles and burgesses, (those that pray, those that fight and those that work). This marked the adoption of <b>a</b> <b>commonplace</b> view of Medieval society as composed of distinct orders. Within these estates there were ranks for which the terminology was increasingly dominated by the Scots language and as a result began to parallel that used in England. This consciousness over status was reflected in military and (from 1430) sumptuary legislation, which set out the types of weapons and armour that should be maintained, and clothes that could be worn, by various ranks.|$|E

25|$|As <b>a</b> <b>commonplace</b> {{construction}} and home decorating material, plaster is widely available.

25|$|<b>A</b> <b>commonplace</b> saying {{during the}} long rule of the Social Democratic/Radical {{coalition}} was that Prime Minister Thorvald Stauning handled domestic policy, while P.

25|$|In practice, the {{principle}} of duality allows us {{to set up a}} dual correspondence between two geometric constructions. The most famous of these is the polarity or reciprocity of two figures in a conic curve (in 2 dimensions) or a quadric surface (in 3 dimensions). <b>A</b> <b>commonplace</b> example is found in the reciprocation of a symmetrical polyhedron in a concentric sphere to obtain the dual polyhedron.|$|E
25|$|At {{the scale}} of the {{wavelength}} of light even wavy water is always smooth so the light is reflected in a locally specular manner (not diffusely). The glint of light off water is <b>a</b> <b>commonplace</b> effect of this. At small angles of incident light, waviness results in reduced reflectivity because of the steepness of the reflectivity-vs.-incident-angle curve and a locally increased average incident angle.|$|E

25|$|Bands {{formed in}} Manchester during the Madchester era {{included}} the Chemical Brothers, The Verve, Sub Sub (who {{would later become}} the Doves) and Oasis (Noel Gallagher had been a roadie for the Inspiral Carpets). More generally, the Madchester scene brought together electronic dance music and alternative rock, in particular {{the combination of the}} types of drumming found in funk and disco music (and sampled in '80s hip-hop music) with jingle-jangle guitar. In the 1990s, this became <b>a</b> <b>commonplace</b> formula, found frequently in even the most commercial music.|$|E
25|$|Apart {{from the}} lost Handboc or Encheiridio, {{which seems to}} have been <b>a</b> <b>commonplace</b> book kept by the king, the {{earliest}} work to be translated was the Dialogues of Gregory the Great, a book greatly popular in the Middle Ages. The translation was undertaken at Alfred's command by Werferth, Bishop of Worcester, with the king merely furnishing a preface. Remarkably Alfred, undoubtedly with the advice and aid of his court scholars, translated four works himself: Gregory the Great's Pastoral Care, Boethius's Consolation of Philosophy", St. Augustine's Soliloquies and the first fifty psalms of the Psalter.|$|E
25|$|In the 20th century, however, composers such as Arnold Schoenberg, Béla Bartók, and Igor Stravinsky sought {{alternatives}} or {{extensions of}} tonal harmony, and found other {{uses for the}} semitone. Often the semitone was exploited harmonically as a caustic dissonance, having no resolution. Some composers would even use large collections of harmonic semitones (tone clusters) {{as a source of}} cacophony in their music (e.g. the early piano works of Henry Cowell). By now, enharmonic equivalence was <b>a</b> <b>commonplace</b> property of equal temperament, and instrumental use of the semitone was not at all problematic for the performer. The composer was free to write semitones wherever he wished.|$|E

25|$|In 1825, the Mowatts {{decided to}} try using the boat to tow barges. Since no {{steamboat}} had previously been utilized in such a role, the proposal was widely greeted with scepticism, but in the first attempt, Henry Eckford pulled two barges from New York to Albany in 24 hours, a commercially viable time. The principle having been established, other steamboat owners quickly followed suit, and steam towboats soon became <b>a</b> <b>commonplace.</b> Henry Eckford herself would thereafter spend much of {{her career as a}} towboat. However, she also continued to carry passengers, and in 1826 the steamer's cabin was converted to passenger accommodation. By this time, the fare from New York to Albany had dropped to a dollar.|$|E
25|$|Babbage's {{motivation}} to overcome errors in tables by mechanisation has been <b>a</b> <b>commonplace</b> since Dionysius Lardner {{wrote about it}} in 1834 in the Edinburgh Review (under Babbage's guidance). The context of these developments is still debated. Babbage's own account {{of the origin of}} the difference engine begins with the Astronomical Society's wish to improve The Nautical Almanac. Babbage and Herschel were asked to oversee a trial project, to recalculate some part of those tables. With the results to hand, discrepancies were found. This was in 1821 or 1822, and was the occasion on which Babbage formulated his idea for mechanical computation. The issue of the Nautical Almanac is now described as a legacy of a polarisation in British science caused by attitudes to Sir Joseph Banks, who had died in 1820.|$|E
25|$|From the {{descriptions}} {{that have come}} down to us through the writings of those such as Plato, Aristoxenus and, later, Boethius, we can say with some caution that the ancient Greeks, at least before Plato, heard music that was primarily monophonic; that is, music built on single melodies based on a system of modes/scales, themselves built on the concept that notes should be placed between consonant intervals. It is <b>a</b> <b>commonplace</b> of musicology to say that harmony, {{in the sense of}} a developed system of composition, in which many tones at once contribute to the listener's expectation of resolution, was invented in the European Middle Ages and that ancient cultures had no developed system of harmony—that is, for example, playing the third and seventh above the dominant, in order to create the expectation for the listener that the tritone will resolve to the third.|$|E
