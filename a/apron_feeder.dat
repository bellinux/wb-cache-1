A feeder device such as an <b>apron</b> <b>feeder,</b> conveyor or vibrating grid controls {{the rate at which}} this material enters the crusher, and often contains a preliminary screening device which allows smaller material to bypass the crusher itself, thus improving efficiency.

40|$|For {{research}} purposes, it {{is often}} necessary to gin small cotton samples on laboratory-scale gin stands (lab gins) to evaluate fiber properties, but because lab gins differ from commercial gin plants, {{the validity of the}} results obtained has been questioned. The objective of this research was to compare fiber properties between cotton processed with lab gins and commercial gin stands. Seed cotton was collected at the gin stand <b>feeder</b> <b>apron</b> and lint was collected before and after lint cleaning at seven commercial cotton gin facilities. Each seed-cotton sample was sub-divided for processing with four lab gins includ-ing two from Dennis Manufacturing, one fro...|$|R
40|$|Damage to {{cotton fibers}} during ginning {{can be reduced}} by {{minimizing}} dryer temperatures and restoring moisture to over-dried fibers. This paper reports the effects of seed cotton moisture conditioning on fiber quality and gin stand energy consumption. Dryer temperatures were varied, and humidified air was added to seed cotton above the extractor-feeder. Each test lot concluded with a 227 -kg (500 -lb) bale. The addition of moisture with humidified air raised the final lint moisture content from 4. 55 % to 5. 08 % (5. 3 g/kg or 2. 7 lb/ bale). This increase {{was estimated to be}} 10 g/kg (5 lb/bale) lint or more at the gin stand <b>feeder</b> <b>apron,</b> so some of the added moisture was lost befor...|$|R
40|$|Material {{handling}} {{is undoubtedly}} {{the most important}} and in fact an indispensable job in industries for it is encountered at every stage right from the time raw materials enter the factory gate to the point when it leaves in form of finished products. The engineering of material handling falls under two categories depending on form of material: bulk solid handling and unit handling. In case of handling lumpy materials like coals etc., feeder plays a vital role as an uninterrupted source of uniform feed provider to the conveyor system. Although several <b>feeders</b> like belt, <b>apron,</b> screw, <b>feeders</b> etc are available, reciprocating feeders are still in use because it ensures a continuous and controlled feed rate, is low in cost, its drive mechanism is simple, it can handle wide range of miscellaneous materials including lumps, easy in assembly and disassembly and maintenance requirement is quite low. The challenge which we have taken via the project, is to design a drive mechanism for a reciprocating coal feeder. We call it a challenge because we have to design various intricate components like couplings, worm reducers, gearbox etc. We call it complicated since all the components are interdependent on each other to a great extent. So we cannot design anything randomly. We have to take into considerations the smallest of small things like the various forces acting, how each component can fail under various stress conditions. We have to optimize everything right from the motor selection, to speed reduction ratio selection, to the capacity of coal which we can handle. We are going to follow the above-mentioned strategies so that our project does not remain just a theory but can become a reality for industries...|$|R

According to the differences on test requirements and effects, the traditional sensor development test weighing system presently is adopted widely. In the design, resistance strain gauge is installed on the feeder chain plate; and the whole-armed bridge compensates temperature to test the voltage value outputted by bridge resistance gauge; based on labview software, the virtual online dynamic weighing system is developed, realizing online monitoring at full time, warning, alarming and shutdown protective operation. 1...|$|E
40|$|The {{reliable}} {{design and}} operation of surge bins and feeders can be challenging when dealing with difficult-to-handle materials. Accurately predicting the feeder loads to minimise drive system over design on large systems while ensuring a feeder can start under full load is tough. With ever increasing pressure from mine operators to reduce the capital and operating costs of feeders, {{there is a need}} to improve design techniques to predict feeder loads to avoid unnecessary conservatism. This paper investigates the application of the Discrete Element Method (DEM) to simulate the discharge of primary crushed iron ore from a wedged-shaped bin onto an <b>apron</b> <b>feeder</b> to evaluate the feeder loads and drive resistances. Results from the calibrated DEM modelling are compared to theoretical methods. Non-cohesive and cohesive DEM contact models are also examined to assess the variation of the predicted feeder loads and draw-down patterns...|$|E
40|$|The coal {{handling}} process involves {{a number of}} activities from loading and unloading to stockpile. This procedure {{can be carried out}} by coal conveying system which includes a large number of mechanical equipment. The important activities under {{coal handling}} include loading/unloading, dumping, transporting etc. which are done with the help of various mechanical equipment. Every organization wants to profit as much as possible and increases their production rate by using maximum effort for care and maintain. And it is possible if the equipment is running in good condition with zero breakdowns, zero accident, and zero wastage. This research work presents a practical analysis for monitoring the operational performance of equipment, which shows the two additional objectives: the first one is the identification of major causes of production losses which are born from malfunctions, breakdowns, and bad operating programme. And the second one is the implementation of a suitable and appropriate methodology for improvement of coal handling systems, which handling the coal from bunker to stockyard within an industry. The data are analyzed and compared with World class to Obtained OEE. During the operation, many reasons are there, which affect the production rate called six big losses. To minimize the six big losses and improve productivity, an accurate effective estimation of equipment is necessary and offers a suitable methodology. For the purpose of the study, a case study methodology is applied in order to analyze in the depth of maintenance in a real context. The primary focus of this research work is to monitor the equipment performance in coal handling plants and its contribution to the company for overall operation. The OEE data are recorded through tables and compared to world class OEE considering the operational losses and also performance reports are briefly analyzed through figures in terms of equipment failures in different locations, idle time for materials, operators and speed loss time for minor stoppages like sensor blocked, cleaning/checking or component jamming. For minimizing the downtime and promote productivity, a suitable methodology is developed through tables for determining the status of coal handling equipment viz. Tippler, Side arm charger, Reversible <b>apron</b> <b>feeder,</b> Belt conveyor system, Stacker, Reclaimer. This research work deals with the quantitative measurement of equipment performance in coal handling plant, which defines losses for many reasons. As a result, valuable information is provided concerning the performance monitoring of production equipment and implementing a suitable methodology for improvement of coal handling machinery operations viz tippler, side arm charger, reversible <b>apron</b> <b>feeder,</b> belt conveyor, stacker, reclaimer. Introduce the estimation and evaluation of OEE procedure which is highly valid and accurate performance indicator and has become very popular in all the industries starting from mining area for excavation of material to harbour area for material handling. OEE shows a right metrics to analyze the ordinary issue and improving the whole process. There are many formulas, systems and metrics being used to improve the whole production process, but one and only OEE reduces complex problem into easy. The biggest advantage of OEE allows companies to have separate business functions by applying a single easy to understand the formula. OEE {{is by far the most}} effective benchmarking tool in making sound management and maintenance decisions.
