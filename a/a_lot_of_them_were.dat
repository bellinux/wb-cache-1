500|$|The box set's {{release was}} {{confirmed}} on Wainwright's official site on March 21, 2011. Only 3,000 copies were produced for worldwide distribution. Box sets were sold for £150 in the United Kingdom, €170 throughout Europe, and were available as imports in the United States for $350. As {{part of the}} marketing strategy to promote the collection and concert series, Universal Music Catalogue developed a [...] "treasure hunt" [...] video for YouTube where visitors identified clues, and navigated links within a collage of Wainwright's music videos. According to Wainwright, the rarities box set was a [...] "little Rufus blast" [...] before he began work on his next pop album. Wainwright also said the following of the collection: [...] "There's my old demos, <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>were</b> recorded in Montreal... when I had a very, very different voice, I kind of sounded like a little old man. There's that and there's a lot of fabulous collaborations with my mother, my father and some other great artists." [...] Wainwright had originally intended to call the box set The Rufus Cycle. After being told the title was [...] "too sophisticated", he went with House of Rufus, partly inspired by Lady Gaga's Haus of Gaga. Wainwright claimed the box set's release shortly after his father's (Loudon Wainwright III) box set 40 Odd Years was [...] "totally serendipitous".|$|E

2500|$|Meanwhile news of Burmese reverses in Assam reached Burma. The Burmese monarch Bagyidaw {{sent his}} finest general Mingi Maha Bandula to reclaim Assam with {{reinforcements}} of 20,000 soldiers. Undaunted by enemy strength, Chandrakanta Singha marched upwards into Upper Assam with approximately 2000 men consisting of Sikhs and Hindustani mercenaries and some local Assamese people recruited around Guwahati. After pushing the enemy forces back, he pitched his camp in Mahgarh (presently known as Kokilamukh; located in Jorhat district near the capital Jorhat). On 19 April 1822 A.D. the 20,000 Burmese led by Mingi Maha Bandula and the 2000 mixed Assamese-Hindustani forces led by Chandrakanta Singha fought the decisive battle at Mahgarh. Chandrakanta Singha {{is said to}} have displayed unusual vigour and courage by himself present in the thick of battle; personally leading his soldiers; and engaged in hand-to-hand combat with enemy soldiers. [...] For some time his troops held their own, but in the end their ammunition gave out and they were defeated with a loss of 1500 men. The Burmese won the battle due to their numerical superiority but sustained losses more than that of Chandrakanta's forces. Chandrakanta Singha and his remaining forces managed to escape back to Guwahati as the Burmese, like Chandrakanta Singha's forces run out of ammunitions and <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>were</b> injured or dead after the battle.|$|E
2500|$|Japan, {{even though}} a {{defeated}} power {{by the summer of}} 1945, exploited long-standing Vietnamese resentment of French colonialism. The first signs of {{the beginning of the end}} of the French empire in Indochina came when Vietnamese insurgents attacked and killed French residents in Saigon, prompting the French to send in a combat command (light brigade) of Leclerc's old 2nd Armored Division, among other troops, to help restore order. The Armée de l’Air reinforced the army units in the guise of the so-called Groupe marchant de l’extrême-orient (the Far East Forward Group), which included U.S.-built aircraft such as the ubiquitous Douglas C-47 Skytrain, totaling eighteen in number after reinforcements had been brought in. In November 1945, the personnel of the 1st Fighter Wing (consisting of GC I/7 and II/7) arrived in Saigon, but without airplanes. Later on, those units received the F.VIII and F.IX variants of the British Supermarine Spitfire. However, the complement was completed with seized Japanese aircraft, mostly ones dedicated to liaison duties. Although the C-47s were not bombers, <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>were</b> jury-rigged in order to fulfill bombing missions over the nine years which remained to the French empire in Indochina. By March 1946, the Armée de l’Air consisted of four units, two of which were fighter units equipped with the Spitfire F.IX, a transport/bombing unit equipped with the C-47 and a further one consisting of examples of the Junkers Ju 52/3m. Indeed, the only French-built aircraft available were Morane-Saulnier MS.500 and Nord NC.702 liaison aircraft, which would be used for observation and evacuation duties as well. (The MS.500 was actually a copy of the German Fieseler Fi 156 [...] "Storch" [...] (Stork) aircraft.). By March 1947, the [...] "Cigognes" [...] and [...] "Alsace" [...] fighter groups had come to Indochina, and they had been joined by the [...] "Corse" [...] group, equipped with the de Havilland Mosquito. However, just as their RAF counterparts had experienced when stationed in Burma during World War II, the aircraft, dubbed the “Wooden Wonder” by the British, began to deteriorate as a result of their exposure to a climate that they were not designed to operate in at all. That same month, the Nam-Dinh garrison was encircled, so the transport groups were called upon to drop over 350 airborne troops in order to relieve the besieged troops and thus break the enemy's encirclement. Little by little, the insurgents, fighting the French as a guerrilla army, began to perfect the art and science of guerrilla warfare.|$|E

[...] After completing the graphic novel, Hicks requested that her publisher allow her to publish it online in webcomic format, as she felt that it would help reach more readers and potentially increase sales for the work.
