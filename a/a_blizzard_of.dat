25|$|Before the 1999 season, the Blue Jays traded Clemens to the Yankees for {{starting}} pitcher David Wells, second baseman Homer Bush and relief pitcher Graeme Lloyd. They also fired manager Tim Johnson during spring training after {{he lied about}} several things (including killing people in the Vietnam War) in order to motivate his players. The Blue Jays had initially been willing to stand by Johnson. <b>A</b> <b>blizzard</b> <b>of</b> questions about his credibility during spring training, however, led Ash to fire him {{less than a month}} before opening day. Johnson was replaced with Jim Fregosi, who managed the Phillies when they lost to the Blue Jays in the 1993 World Series. The offense picked up somewhat in 1999, but the pitching suffered without Clemens, as the Blue Jays finished at 84–78, in third place. After the 1999 season, the Blue Jays' original mascot for 20 years, BJ Birdy, was replaced by a duo named Ace & Diamond.|$|E

[...] Alex Denney of NME mused that the track [...] "proves a riotous bit of respite" [...] and features West [...] "sending up his rep with a self-mocking diatribe about drowning his pain in <b>a</b> <b>blizzard</b> <b>of</b> blow jobs and mass adulation while Nicki Minaj sets the dials to 'ridiculous' with a fire-breathing, raga-inflected verse." [...] Embling of Tiny Mix Tapes felt that with [...] "super-sized cipher cuts" [...] like [...] "Monster" [...] and [...] "So Appalled", West balanced out some of the darker moments of My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy, and that the song contained heavy [...] "shit-talking." [...] Slant Magazine's Cole Matthew also commented that posse cuts [...] "Monster" [...] and [...] "So Appalled" [...] were amongst the hardest tracks ever produced by West.|$|E

2500|$|Oshima varied {{his style}} {{dramatically}} {{to serve the}} needs of specific films - long takes in Night and Fog in Japan (1960), <b>a</b> <b>blizzard</b> <b>of</b> quick jump cuts in [...] Violence at Noon (1966), nearly neo-realistic in Boy (Shonen, 1969), or a raw exploration of American b-movie sensibilities in Cruel Story of Youth. [...] Again and again, Oshima introduced a critical stance that would transgress social norms by exploring why certain dysfunctions are tolerated - witness the familial dysfunctions of Boy and 1971's The Ceremony or the examinations of racism in Death by Hanging and Three Resurrected Drunkards (both 1968), and why some are not, at least openly - the entanglements of sex, power and violence explicitly depicted in In the Realm of the Senses (1976), or [...] gay undercurrents located within samurai culture (a well-documented subject in publications, but not in film) in 1999's otherwise atypically serene Taboo (Gohatto).|$|E

2500|$|Under General de Lisle's command, the Suvla {{front was}} reorganised and {{reinforced}} {{with the arrival}} of the 29th Division from Helles and the 2nd Mounted Division from Egypt (minus their horses). [...] The fighting climaxed on 21 August with the Battle of Scimitar Hill, the largest battle of the Gallipoli campaign. [...] When it too failed, activity at Suvla subsided into sporadic fighting until it was evacuated by the British in late December. Conditions during the summer had been appalling because of heat, flies, and lack of sanitation. On 15 November there was a deluge of rain and again on 26/27 November a major rainstorm flooded trenches up to 4 feet deep. This was succeeded by <b>a</b> <b>blizzard</b> <b>of</b> snow and two nights of heavy frost. At Suvla, 220 men drowned or froze to death and there were 12,000 cases of frostbite or exposure.|$|E
60|$|He {{took the}} rich gifts from her in silence. There are moments in a man's life too sacred for words. The {{wonder of the}} thing had struck him dumb.

He had been {{prepared}} to secure them through a shower of biting taunts, <b>a</b> <b>blizzard</b> <b>of</b> razor-like 'I told you so's'.

Then fire caught the craft in its awful embrace, and rolling from side to side, she, too, sought for a harbor of refuge, but found none. Down came her colors, and at the same instant she struck with a crash on the rocks. The fight had started at quarter to ten. Now it was but quarter past eleven,--just an hour and a half,--and all the Spanish ships but one had been destroyed. Such is the appalling {{swiftness}} of modern naval warfare.

Above bitterness the son recalled the date; it was his thirty-second birthday. He told himself that nothing should keep him from the one who could best understand his predicament. This dear, sincere mother had counseled him before; why not now? The foolishness of troubling Mrs. Doan was clear. As he hastened on his way, he began to wonder what his mother would really think of the bishop's action. Would she accept her son's humiliation with serene, unqualified spirit? Would her faith in a superior's judgment hold? The suspended priest felt the terms for the true Catholic. He dreaded palliation of the bishop's course. But no--his mother could never do that. In the case in question her boy must stand injured, unjustly dealt with.|$|E
