5|$|One {{sequence}} came directly {{after the}} casino robbery, where Batman follows a robbery signal on a tracking device in the Batmobile. He {{shows up at}} the crime scene and finds he is <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>wrong</b> place (a beauty salon), in which a room full of girls laugh at him. The Riddler had been throwing Batman off the track by messing with the Batmobile's tracking device. This would explain why in the theatrical version Batman seems to give Riddler and Two-Face moments of free rein over the city. This scene appears in a rough edit on the Special Edition DVD.|$|E
5|$|The new {{production}} upsets Anna, who realizes that Flo's {{world does not}} revolve around just her, and she becomes envious of the attention he pays to Audrey. She divorces him after walking in on Flo and a drunk Audrey <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>wrong</b> moment. Audrey walks out on Flo and the show after an angry confrontation. Broke, Flo borrows money from Billings {{for a third time}} for the new show.|$|E
5|$|Written by Pennant Roberts, this four-part {{story was}} {{commissioned}} on 10 January 1979 as Dragons of Fear. The adventure would involve the planet Erinella {{and two men}} fighting over a princess. The Doctor would become involved in his own timeline by arriving <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>wrong</b> time and becoming {{accused of being a}} poisoner. Roberts resubmitted the story in the mid-1980s to script editor Eric Saward, but nothing came of the submission.|$|E

5|$|In 1938, Fingleton {{made what}} turned out to be his {{international}} farewell as Australia toured England, a series in which he found runs difficult to come by. He later attributed this to his inability to play the pull shot. However, Fingleton started the tour well. He passed 30 in each of his first seven innings on English soil, and converted three of these starts into centuries, scoring 124 against Oxford University, 111 against Cambridge University and 123 not out against Hampshire in the first month of cricket. Fingleton's form tapered just <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>wrong</b> time, falling three times for single figures in the last two matches before the Tests. He carried this into the First Test at Trent Bridge, where he made only 9 and 40 in a high-scoring draw in which every innings passed 400.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} years of the cemetery's operation, the {{locomotives}} hauling the funeral trains from Waterloo would not travel down the branch into the cemetery, as it would leave the engine <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>wrong</b> end of the train for the return journey. Instead, the train would stop immediately after passing Necropolis Junction, and the carriages would be uncoupled from the engine. A team of black horses would then haul the carriages down the sloping branch line to the two cemetery stations. While the train was on the branch line the engine would be repositioned so as to be at the front of the train once the horses drew it back out of the branch and onto the main line.|$|E
5|$|The voyage {{from the}} United Kingdom took {{approximately}} {{three weeks and}} on 7 November 1942 Awatea arrived at its assigned station off the coast near the harbour of Algiers. At 10:15pm No. 6 Commando took to their landing craft. The launch did not go smoothly. From the outset they were hampered by the inexperience of the crews lowering the landing craft {{into the water and}} this, along with other factors that arose later including poor weather, breakdowns and navigational errors meant that the majority of No. 6 Commando's landing craft missed the rendezvous with the motor launch that was to guide them to the landing beaches. As a result, many landed <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>wrong</b> spot and the schedule was ruined. In the end the first landings took place at 3:00am on 8 November, two hours later than planned, while the last wave came ashore in broad daylight at 6:30am.|$|E
5000|$|This is {{slightly}} misleading as schedule variances {{with a large}} P and small S and vice versa are not equivalent. (The risk of the RMS Titanic sinking vs. the passengers' meals being served <b>at</b> slightly <b>the</b> <b>wrong</b> time).|$|R

5|$|After being {{withdrawn}} back to Australia in March 1944, {{the units}} of the 7th Division received six weeks' leave before reforming on the Atherton Tablelands in Queensland. Following this the 2/14th Battalion undertook a period of training before finally being committed to their last campaign {{of the war in}} mid-1945. This campaign saw them take part in the amphibious landings at Balikpapan on 1 July 1945. During the initial landings early on 1 July, the 2/14th came ashore <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>wrong</b> place, landing at Yellow Beach when it had been scheduled to land at Green Beach. Nevertheless, the landing was largely unopposed and after 45 minutes of reorganisation the Australians were able to establish themselves at their correct form up point and begin the advance to their first objective: the bridge over the Klandasan Besar. Advancing unopposed they crossed the bridge and at nightfall dug-in in front of the Stalkudo ridge, along the Vasey Highway. The following day, the battalion captured the Sepinggang airstrip as the 21st Brigade began the advance to the east. The 2/27th Battalion subsequently relieved the 2/14th at Sepinggang and on 3 July, the battalion began to move towards the Manggar airstrip. The 21st Brigade then came up against stronger opposition near the Batakan Ketjil River, which held them up until the evening.|$|E
5|$|In August, she steamed to New York for repairs, {{arriving}} at Base 10 on 19 August and entering the New York Navy Yard soon thereafter. She completed repairs on 26 September and got underway for Port Jefferson that same day. During the mid-watch on 27 September, she ran hard aground on Block Island. Captain Victor Blue and his navigator, confused about shore lights and {{more concerned about}} the minefield at the opening of Long Island Sound, made the turn <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>wrong</b> time and ran the ship aground on the island from the bow all the way aft beyond midships. For three days, her crew lightened ship to no avail. On 30 September, tugs came to her assistance, and she finally backed clear. Hull damage dictated a return to the yard, and extensive repairs precluded her departure with Battleship Division 9 (BatDiv 9) for the British Isles in November. The secondary battery was reduced to eighteen 5-inch guns in October 1917. Captain Blue, a protege of Navy Secretary Josephus Daniels, was never court-martialed and remained in command of Texas. The Navy Department held his navigator entirely responsible for the accident.|$|E
5|$|The {{propellers}} {{themselves were}} also found to be poorly manufactured, having been shaped by hand, {{with at least one}} cast <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>wrong</b> pitch. This was rectified by using a five-axis milling machine for future shaping work and replacing the miscast propeller. The material used for the propellers was also found to be weaker than expected, developing fatigue cracks after only a few years of use. Instead of going to Kockums, which had started to go into decline {{after the end of the}} Cold War, the submarine project office sent the propeller to the United States Navy for redesigning. Despite the Americans fixing the problems with the propeller design, resulting in significant performance improvements, the Swedish company was dissatisfied with the Australian actions; the dispatch of the propellers was one of the points of contention in the company's legal action in the mid-2000s against the Australian government over ownership of the intellectual property rights to the submarine's design.|$|E

5000|$|Critics {{generally}} {{responded with}} negative reviews, garnering an 11% score on Rotten Tomatoes and Stephen Holden of The New York Times called {{the vision of}} the film a mis-fire: [...] "The very idea conjures up visions of classic sight gags in which man and beast fail to communicate, or worse, fail to get along. Think of elegant circus tricks executed in <b>the</b> <b>wrong</b> place <b>at</b> precisely <b>the</b> <b>wrong</b> time. Think of an elephantine stubbornness that makes the most recalcitrant donkey look like an obedient eager beaver. Think of a rampage in a supermarket or a spontaneous grand entrance at a chi-chi social event, and you can begin to see the possibilities".|$|R
30|$|Ramp response: {{as shown}} in Fig.  12, for the {{proposed}} MPPC technique, MPP is closely captured.

25|$|According to Susan Sontag, leukemia {{was often}} romanticized in 20th-century fiction, {{portrayed as a}} joy-ending, clean disease whose fair, {{innocent}} and gentle victims die young or <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>wrong</b> time. As such, it was the cultural successor to tuberculosis, which held this cultural position until it was discovered to be an infectious disease. The 1970 romance novel Love Story {{is an example of}} this romanticization of leukemia.|$|E
25|$|The raid {{was carried}} out {{on the night of}} 19/20 April 1941. As a result of a number of mishaps, things went awry from the beginning.

Problems with the release gear for the assault craft, meant that some of the commando parties were late getting ashore and another landed <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>wrong</b> beach.|$|E
