[...] During her years in the corps, as the only Black woman in the company, Copeland also felt the burden of her ethnicity in many ways and contemplated a variety of career choices. Recognizing that Copeland's isolation and self-doubt were standing in the way of her talent, ABT's artistic director, Kevin McKenzie, asked writer and arts figure Susan Fales-Hill, then vice-chair of ABT's Board of Directors, to mentor Copeland. Fales-Hill introduced Copeland to Black women trailblazers who encouraged Copeland and helped her to gain perspective.|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: Mindfulness-based {{interventions}} for healthy {{behaviors such as}} exercise and dietary modifications have aroused growing interest. This study aims to test {{the effectiveness of a}} mindfulness-based intervention for the reduction of impulsive eating and the improvement of motivation to exercise among obese individuals. METHODS: One-hundred and twenty obese outpatients, aged 18 to 65 years, diagnosed with <b>a</b> <b>binge</b> <b>eating</b> <b>disorder,</b> will be {{randomly assigned to one of}} the three following groups: mindfulness practice, sham meditation, or treatment as usual control. The tested intervention consists of a 1 -year computerized mindfulness-based program. Mindfulness sessions are audio recordings that the patients are asked to listen to, 10 min every day. Self-reported questionnaires measuring impulsive eating, motivation to exercise, physical activity level, mood, and mindfulness skills are filled in at baseline, 1, 6, and 12 months. Physical activity, calories consumption, and biomarkers are measured with more objective measurement tools at baseline, 6 months and 12 months. CONCLUSION: Mindfulness, as both a de-automation element and as a moderator of motivation to exercise, can lead to the reduction of impulsive eating and also to an increase in levels of physical activity. These effects could cause weight loss in obese patients suffering from binge eating disorder. TRIAL REGISTRATION: clinicaltrials. gov: NCT 02571387. Peer reviewe...|$|E

This article is intended solely for the personal use of the individual user and {{is not to be}} disseminated broadly. Cross-sectional evidence shows that loss of control (LOC) eating is a common and psychopathologically relevant experience in preadolescence. This study sought to investigate the natural course of preadolescent LOC eating in relation to psychopathology and body weight trajectory. A community sample of 55 children ages 8 – 13 years with LOC eating, defined as at least one episode of LOC eating within the past 3 months (LOC�), and 59 matched children without LOC history (LOC�), were assessed with the Eating Disorder Examination adapted for Children and self-report questionnaires every 6 months over a 2 -year follow-up. Of the LOC � children, 54. 5 % of children remitted from LOC eating, 3. 6 % showed persistent LOC eating, and 41. 8 % showed recurring LOC eating over the follow-up period. Of the LOC� children, 19 % revealed an onset of LOC episodes, mostly with a low level of stability. Multilevel modeling showed that LOC <b>eating</b> predicted <b>a</b> partial <b>binge</b> <b>eating</b> <b>disorder</b> diagnosis and greater global <b>eating</b> <b>disorder</b> psychopathology, but not depressive symptoms or growth in body fatness. Betweenperson higher shape concern and weight-related teasing, as well as within-person decreases in shape concern and increases in depression, predicted a greater likelihood of subsequent LOC eating. The results indicate a moderate stability of LOC eating in preadolescent children, with prognostic significance for clinically relevant eating problems and <b>eating</b> <b>disorder</b> psychopathology...|$|R
40|$|Recent {{research}} indicates that 2 % to 4 % of the population meet diagnostic criteria for the newly proposed <b>binge</b> <b>eating</b> <b>disorder,</b> {{and that it is}} much more common (30 %) among the treatment-seeking obese. Although recognized as <b>a</b> significant problem, <b>binge</b> <b>eating</b> <b>disorder</b> is l 1 l not well understood, and there is debate about whether <b>binge</b> <b>eating</b> <b>disorder</b> is <b>a</b> distinct disorder. It has been argued that <b>binge</b> <b>eating</b> <b>disorder</b> is simply <b>a</b> variant or milder form of bulimia nervosa and not a separate and distinct disorder. Researchers have begun to study this population in greater depth in order to assess the characteristics of individuals with <b>binge</b> <b>eating</b> <b>disorder,</b> the similarities and differences between individuals with <b>binge</b> <b>eating</b> <b>disorder,</b> bulimia nervosa, and obese individuals who do not engage in <b>binge</b> <b>eating,</b> and the effectiveness of various treatments for <b>binge</b> <b>eating</b> <b>disorder.</b> Previous reviews of the literature (using non-meta-analytic strategies) have examined these areas and have yielded inconsistent conclusions. Therefore, a more comprehensive, current, and empirical integration of the data was conducted. In total, 297 studies of individuals with <b>binge</b> <b>eating</b> <b>disorder,</b> bulimia nervosa and/or obese individuals who do not engage in <b>binge</b> <b>eating</b> were collected, coded, and statistically analyzed across studies (by calculating standardized mean difference effect sizes). The key characteristics of individuals with <b>binge</b> <b>eating</b> <b>disorder</b> were assessed, diagnostic groups were systematically compared, and treatment outcomes (from 19 studies) were evaluated. The results indicated that individuals with <b>binge</b> <b>eating</b> <b>disorder</b> have <b>a</b> number of differences from both bulimia nervosa and obese non <b>binge</b> <b>eating</b> individuals. However, the extent of these differences was not great, and there was a general trend for <b>binge</b> <b>eating</b> <b>disorder</b> individuals to fall between the two groups on most measures of disturbed eating and psychopathology. These findings tend to support the continuum/variant conceptualization of <b>binge</b> <b>eating</b> <b>disorder</b> rather than that of a distinct disorder. In addition, data from primary research studies on the treatment of <b>binge</b> <b>eating</b> <b>disorder</b> indicated that, overall, psychosocial interventions were helpful in decreasing <b>binge</b> <b>eating</b> and psychopathological symptoms, but were less effective at reducing weight. The clinical implications of these findings are discussed, as are suggestions for future research...|$|R
40|$|Objective: Little {{is known}} about the {{prevalence}} and correlates of <b>eating</b> <b>disorders</b> (ED) in middle-aged women. Method: We mailed anonymous questionnaires to 1, 500 Austrian women aged 40 - 60 years, assessing ED (defined by DSM-IV), subthreshold ED, body image, and quality of life. We broadly defined "subthreshold ED" by the presence of either (1) <b>binge</b> <b>eating</b> with loss of control or (2) purging behavior, without requiring any of the other usual DSM-IV criteria for frequency or severity of these symptoms. Results: Of the 715 (48 %) responders, 33 [4. 6 %; 95 % confidence interval (CI) : 3. 3 - 6. 4 %] reported symptoms meeting full DSM-IV criteria for an ED [bulimia nervosa = 10; <b>binge</b> <b>eating</b> <b>disorder</b> = 11; <b>eating</b> <b>disorder</b> not otherwise specified (EDNOS) = 12]. None displayed anorexia nervosa. Another 34 women (4. 8 %; CI: 3. 4 - 6. 6 %) displayed subthreshold ED. These women showed levels of associated psychopathology virtually equal to the women with full-syndrome diagnoses. Discussion: ED appear common in middle-aged women, with <b>a</b> preponderance of <b>binge</b> <b>eating</b> <b>disorder</b> and EDNOS diagnoses as compared to the "classical" diagnoses of anorexia and bulimia nervosa.

40|$|Intuitive eating {{has been}} {{described}} to represent an adaptive eating behaviour that is characterised by eating in response to physiological hunger and satiety cues, rather than situational and emotional stimuli. The Intuitive Eating Scale- 2 (IES- 2) has been developed to measure such attitudes and behaviours on four subscales: unconditional permission to eat (UPE), eating for physical rather than emotional reasons (EPR), reliance on internal hunger and satiety cues (RHSC), and body-food choice congruence (B-FCC). The present study aimed at validating {{the psychometric properties of}} the German translation of the IES- 2 in a large German-speaking sample. A second objective was to assess levels of intuitive eating in participants with an eating disorder diagnosis (anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa, or binge eating disorder). The proposed factor structure of the IES- 2 could be confirmed for the German translation of the questionnaire. The total score and most subscale scores were negatively related to eating disorder symptomatology, problems in appetite and emotional awareness, body dissatisfaction, and self-objectification. Women with eating disorders had significantly lower values on all IES- 2 subscale scores and the total score than women without an eating disorder diagnosis. Women with <b>a</b> <b>binge</b> <b>eating</b> <b>disorder</b> (BED) diagnosis had higher scores on the UPE subscale compared to participants with anorexia nervosa (AN) or bulimia nervosa (BN), and those diagnosed with AN had higher scores on the EPR subscale than individuals with BN or BED. We conclude that the German IES- 2 constitutes a useful self-report instrument for the assessment of intuitive eating in German-speaking samples. Further studies are warranted to evaluate psychometric properties of the IES- 2 in different samples, and to investigate its application in a clinical setting...|$|E

The Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV, Binge Eating Scale and Beck Depression Inventory were used to assess <b>eating</b> <b>disorders</b> and other psychiatric comorbidity. In addition to the descriptive analysis of the data, we compared groups divided based on the presence of obesity (evaluated by the body mass index) or an <b>eating</b> <b>disorder.</b> RESULTS: Twenty percent of the sample displayed <b>an</b> <b>eating</b> <b>disorder.</b> <b>Binge</b> <b>eating</b> <b>disorder</b> was the predominant <b>eating</b> <b>disorder</b> diagnosis (10 %).

40|$|OBJECTIVE: The aim of {{this study}} was to assess {{executive}} functions of obese individuals with <b>binge</b> <b>eating</b> <b>disorder.</b> METHOD: Thirty-eight obese individuals with <b>binge</b> <b>eating</b> <b>disorder</b> were compared to thirty-eight obese controls without <b>binge</b> <b>eating</b> <b>disorder</b> in terms of their executive functions. All individuals were assessed using the following instruments: Digit Span, Trail Making Tests A and B, Stroop Test and the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test. In addition, four subtests from the Behavioral Assessment of the Dysexecutive Syndrome Battery were also used, namely the Zoo Map Test, the Modified Six Elements Test, the Action Program Test and the Rule Shift Cards Test. RESULTS: When compared to obese controls, obese individuals with <b>binge</b> <b>eating</b> <b>disorder</b> presented significant impairment in the following tests: Digit Span backward, Zoo Map Test, Modified Six Elements Test, and Action Program Test. Subjects with <b>binge</b> <b>eating</b> <b>disorder</b> also showed significant more set shifting and perseverative errors in the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test. In other measures such as the Digit Span Forward, the Trail Making Test, the Stroop Test and the Rule Shift Cards Test, obese subjects with <b>binge</b> <b>eating</b> <b>disorder</b> did not differ significantly from obese subjects without <b>binge</b> <b>eating</b> <b>disorder.</b> CONCLUSION: These results suggest that, in the present sample, obese individuals with <b>binge</b> <b>eating</b> <b>disorder</b> presented executive deficits, especially impairments relating to problem-solving, cognitive flexibility and working memory...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE: <b>Binge</b> <b>eating</b> <b>disorder</b> was {{introduced}} in DSM-IV as a psychiatric disorder needing further study. This community-based study describes the relationship between race and clinical functioning {{in black and white}} women with and without <b>binge</b> <b>eating</b> <b>disorder.</b> METHOD: <b>A</b> group of 150 women with <b>binge</b> <b>eating</b> <b>disorder</b> (52 black, 98 white) and a race-matched group of 150 healthy comparison subjects were recruited from the community. Eating and psychiatric symptoms were assessed through interviews and self-report. RESULTS: Black and white women with <b>binge</b> <b>eating</b> <b>disorder</b> differed significantly on numerous <b>eating</b> <b>disorder</b> features, including <b>binge</b> frequency, restraint, history of other <b>eating</b> <b>disorders,</b> treatment-seeking behavior, and concerns with eating, weight, and shape. Black and white healthy comparison subjects differed significantly in obesity rates. CONCLUSIONS: For both black and white women, <b>binge</b> <b>eating</b> <b>disorder</b> was associated with significant impairment in clinical functioning. Yet, racial differences in clinical presentation underscore the importance of considering race in psychopathology research...|$|R

5000|$|However, other {{research}} suggests that <b>binge</b> <b>eating</b> <b>disorder</b> can also be caused by environmental factors {{and the impact of}} traumatic events. One study showed that women with <b>binge</b> <b>eating</b> <b>disorder</b> experienced more adverse life events in the year prior to the onset of the development of the <b>disorder,</b> and that <b>binge</b> <b>eating</b> <b>disorder</b> was positively associated with how frequently negative events occur. Additionally, the research found that individuals who had <b>binge</b> <b>eating</b> <b>disorder</b> {{were more likely to have}} experienced physical abuse, perceived risk of physical abuse, stress, and body criticism. Other risk factors may include childhood obesity, critical comments about weight, low self-esteem, depression, and physical or sexual abuse in childhood. A few studies have suggested that there could be a genetic component to <b>binge</b> <b>eating</b> <b>disorder,</b> though other studies have shown more ambiguous results. Studies have shown that <b>binge</b> <b>eating</b> tends to run in families and a twin study by Bulik, Sullivan, and Kendler has shown a, [...] "moderate heritability for binge eating" [...] at 41 percent. More research must be done before any firm conclusions can be drawn regarding the heritability of <b>binge</b> <b>eating</b> <b>disorder.</b> Studies have also shown that <b>eating</b> <b>disorders</b> such as anorexia and bulimia reduce coping abilities, which makes it more likely for those suffering to turn to <b>binge</b> <b>eating</b> as <b>a</b> coping strategy.|$|R

40|$|Objective: Studies {{suggest that}} {{cognitive}} deficits and attentional biases {{play a role}} in the development and maintenance of obesity and <b>eating</b> <b>disorders.</b> In this study, we simultaneously examine attentional biases, as well as inhibitory control and mental flexibility, which are keys to controlling unwanted behaviors and thoughts in obese patients with and without <b>binge</b> <b>eating</b> <b>disorder.</b> Methods: 16 obese patients with <b>binge</b> <b>eating</b> <b>disorder</b> and 16 patients without <b>binge</b> <b>eating</b> <b>disorder</b> were compared with 16 normal-weight controls on a ‘‘food/body-mental flexibility task'', which allows the investigation of inhibitory control, mental flexibility and attention for stimuli related to the body and food. Results: All obese patients made significantlymore errors (i. e., pressing a key when a distracter displayed) andmore omissions (i. e., not pressing a key when a target displayed) than controls in both food and body sections of the task. Obese participants with <b>binge</b> <b>eating</b> <b>disorder</b> made significantly more errors and omissions than those without <b>binge</b> <b>eating</b> <b>disorder.</b> No difference between groups was found concerning mental flexibility and cognitive biases for food- and body-related targets. Discussion: These results suggest that obese patients have a general inhibition problemand difficulty focusing attention, which do not depend on the types of stimuli processed. The results also suggest that these cognitive deficits are more severe in obese patients with <b>binge</b> <b>eating</b> <b>disorder,</b> which indicates that there is a continuum of increasing inhibition and cognitive problems with increasingly <b>disordered</b> <b>eating.</b> These cognitive deficits may contribute to problematic eating behaviors...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE: <b>Binge</b> <b>eating</b> <b>disorder</b> {{represents}} <b>a</b> significant {{public health}} problem, {{with up to}} 50 % of weight loss program participants displaying this disorder. In previous studies with orlistat, patients with <b>binge</b> <b>eating</b> <b>disorder</b> were excluded. The goal {{of this study was}} to assess the efficacy of orlistat in obese patients with <b>binge</b> <b>eating</b> <b>disorder.</b> RESEARCH METHODS AND PROCEDURES: Eighty-nine patients with clinically diagnosed <b>binge</b> <b>eating</b> <b>disorder</b> and <b>a</b> BMI > or = 30 kg/m 2 were randomized in double-blind fashion to 24 weeks of treatment with 120 mg of orlistat or placebo three times daily, in combination with a mildly reduced-calorie diet. RESULTS: After 24 weeks, the mean weight loss from baseline for orlistat-treated patients was significantly greater than for patients receiving placebo (- 7. 4 % vs. - 2. 3 %; p = 0. 0001) (intent-to-treat analysis). The overall Eating Disorder Inventory 2 score at week 24 was significantly lower in patients treated with orlistat than in those in the placebo group (p = 0. 011).
