30|$|MASON is a {{free and}} open source, {{agent-based}} modeling library that provides core services that can be mixed easily with other libraries (Luke et al. 2005). Luke et al. (2005) recommends that libraries should be developed from first principles derived from specific domains. Another key attribute is that libraries should be minimal <b>and</b> <b>mix</b> <b>well</b> with third-party libraries. Only essential features should be provided to increase interoperability and simplify learning. There should be complete separation between models, user interfaces, and offline storage. A large number of agents (e.g., millions) should be supported. All model runs should be reproducible. Furthermore, checkpointing (i.e., saving and restoring model runs midstream) should be supported.|$|E
40|$|The contractive auto-encoder learns a rep-resentation of {{the input}} data that captures the local {{manifold}} structure around each data point, through the leading singular vectors of the Jacobian {{of the transformation}} from input to representation. The corresponding singular values specify how much local varia-tion is plausible in directions associated with the corresponding singular vectors, while re-maining in a high-density region of the input space. This paper proposes a procedure for generating samples {{that are consistent with}} the local structure captured by a contrac-tive auto-encoder. The associated stochas-tic process defines a distribution from which one can sample, and which experimentally appears to converge quickly <b>and</b> <b>mix</b> <b>well</b> be-tween modes, compared to Restricted Boltz-mann Machines and Deep Belief Networks. The intuitions behind this procedure {{can also be used to}} train the second layer of contrac-tion that pools lower-level features and learns to be invariant to the local directions of vari-ation discovered in the first layer. We show that this can help learn and represent invari-ances present in the data and improve classi-fication error. 1...|$|E
