There is also <b>a</b> <b>lesser</b> rivalry with Welsh {{neighbours}} Newport County due to {{the proximity of the}} two Welsh cities. However, they have rarely played against each another since the 1980s due to Cardiff being in higher leagues. In total they have only ever played 20 football league games against each other. A survey by Football Fans Census in 2003 saw Swansea, Bristol City and Newport listed as Cardiff's main three rivalries, with Stoke City matching Newport in third.|$|E
5|$|The {{arterial}} partial {{pressures of}} oxygen {{and carbon dioxide}} in the arterial blood are homeostatically controlled. A rise in the arterial partial pressure of carbon dioxide, and, to <b>a</b> <b>lesser</b> extent, a fall in the arterial partial pressure of oxygen, will reflexly cause deeper and faster breathing till the blood gas tensions return to normal. The converse happens when the carbon dioxide tension falls, or, again to <b>a</b> <b>lesser</b> extent, the oxygen tension rises: the rate and depth of breathing are reduced till blood gas normality is restored.|$|E
