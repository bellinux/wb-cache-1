40|$|We {{consider}} {{the problem of}} system reconstruction from higher-order spectra (HOS) slices. We establish that the impulse response of a complex system can be reconstructed up to a scalar and a circular shift based on any pair of HOS slices, {{as long as the}} distance between the two slices satisfies a certain condition. One slice is sufficient for the reconstruction {{in the case of a}} real system. We propose a cepstrum based method for system reconstruction. We also propose a new method for the reconstruction of the system Fourier phase based on the phase of any odd-indexed bispectrum slice. Being able to choose the slices to be used in the reconstruction allows us to avoid bispectrum regions dominated by noise and reduce computational complexity.

The investigation was conducted by developing analytical models that were used for the design of a ground-coupled reversible heat pump and a conventional, also reversible air-to-air system. The models were verified with a commercially available computer program as well as with measurements on the two systems. The results indicate that a ground-coupled reversible heat pump system can provide a cost effective alternative to the more conventional air-to-air systems...|$|E
40|$|Discretization of optimal shape design {{problems}} {{leads to}} very large nonlinear optimization problems. For attaining maximum computational efficiency, a sequential quadratic programming (SQP) algorithm should achieve superlinear convergence while preserving sparsity and convexity {{of the resulting}} quadratic programs.

We show that, for a very large class of optimization problems, one can design SQP algorithms that satisfy all these three requirements. The improvements in computational efficiency are demonstrated for a cam design problem. ∗ <b>Address</b> <b>all</b> <b>correspondence</b> to this author...|$|E
