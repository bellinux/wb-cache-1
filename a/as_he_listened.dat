25|$|Following Duffey's murder, Nilsen {{began to}} kill with {{increasing}} frequency.

One unidentified victim killed in November had moved his legs in a cycling motion as he was strangled (Nilsen is known to have absented himself from work between 11 and 18 November, likely due to this particular murder); another unidentified victim Nilsen had unsuccessfully attempted to resuscitate, before sinking to his knees and sobbing, before standing to expressly spit at his own image as he looked at himself in the mirror.

2500|$|According to Schafer, {{he came up}} {{with the}} idea for Full Throttle while {{listening}} to a traveller's tales about time spent in an Alaskan biker bar. <b>As</b> <b>he</b> <b>listened,</b> it occurred to him that [...] "bikers are kind of like pirates — like another culture that people don't have a window into most of the time, but [...] has its own rules", and might provide a neat alternative to a fantasy setting. So he began his research into biker culture, reading Hunter S. Thompson's [...] The game originally would have featured an interactive sequence where Ben undergoes a peyote-induced hallucinogenic trip. This was eventually cut from the game, because the developers couldn't get it to [...] "work out" [...] with the publisher. The concept eventually became the basis of Psychonauts. Schafer recalls the reaction from the management at LucasArts as being one of [...] "'We can't believe we paid you to write this.'" [...] "They hated it" [...] he stated. In an interview with Gamasutra, Shafer stated that the biker aesthetics of the game were an appeal to fantasy. He stated the team was depending [...] "on the [...] secret desire to be a biker: big, tough, cool. Riding a huge hog..." [...] On the game's setting he noted that often it was mistaken for a post apocalyptic world, however he clarified that the setting was simply an alternate world which was more desolate than our own. [...] "It was never meant to be post-war or anything like that." ...|$|E
