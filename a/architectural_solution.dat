2500|$|Lautner first defined an <b>architectural</b> <b>solution</b> to the scale, function, {{and public}} space of car-oriented {{suburban}} architecture in his remodel of Henry's in Glendale in 1947. Googie's Coffee Shop, designed in 1949, {{stood at the}} corner of Sunset Strip and Crescent Heights, next to the famous Schwab's Pharmacy; regrettably it was demolished in 1989. It was distinctive for its expansive glass walls, arresting angular form, prominent roofline, and exuberant signage oriented to car traffic: an advertisement for itself. Another key Lautner work in the Googie genre was Henry's Restaurant (1957) in Pomona; its vaulted roof, resembling an inverted boat hull, arched over the interior booths and the large exposed beams (made from glue-laminated timber) carried through to the exterior, where they supported a slatted awning that shaded the drive-in area. Other architects spread the Modern aesthetic of the coffee shop/drive-in in such as Tiny Naylor's (Lautner employer Douglas Honnold), Ship's (Martin Stern, Jr.), and Norm's and Clock's (Armet and Davis.) ...|$|E

40|$|The {{need for}} large-bandwidth {{networks}} is in continuous growth. Such demands {{are attributed to}} the user desire to have everything on-line. To support needs, all-optical networks, with their large bandwidth lend themselves considerable attention from both industry and academia. As a result, some optical switching paradigms have been proposed such as optical circuit switching, optical packet switching and optical burst switching. Among these paradigms, Optical Burst Switching (OBS) {{is seen as a}} viable solution. However, lack of mature optical memory makes burst loss ratio in OBS critical which needs to be solved before OBS can really be used in telecommunication networks. Many solutions have been proposed and evaluated to address this issue. These solutions can be categorised into two categories: <b>architectural</b> <b>solutions</b> and procedural <b>solutions.</b> <b>Architectural</b> <b>solutions</b> deal with the architectural design of OBS and these solutions are further classified into two classes: non-slotted and slotted OBS. Procedural solutions deal with the improvement of the operation of OBS networks in terms of burst assembly, routing, switching, scheduling, signalling, etc. In this paper, we focus on <b>architectural</b> <b>solutions</b> where we investigate QoS performance of non-slotted and slotted OBS in terms of burst loss ratio and throughput. Simulation results show that slotted outperforms non-slotted OBS; the results also demonstrate that higher priority bursts outperforms lower priority ones...|$|R
