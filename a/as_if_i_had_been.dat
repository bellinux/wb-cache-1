500|$|In 1910, Alexandra {{became the}} first queen consort to visit the British House of Commons during a debate. In a {{remarkable}} departure from precedent, for two hours {{she sat in the}} Ladies' Gallery overlooking the chamber while the Parliament Bill, a bill to remove the right of the House of Lords to veto legislation, was debated. Privately, Alexandra disagreed with the bill. Shortly afterward, she left to visit her brother, King George I of Greece, in Corfu. While there, she received news that King Edward was seriously ill. Alexandra returned at once and arrived just the day before her husband died. In his last hours, she personally administered oxygen from a gas cylinder to help him breathe. She told Frederick Ponsonby, [...] "I feel <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> turned into stone, unable to cry, unable to grasp the meaning of it all." [...] Later that year, she moved out of Buckingham Palace to Marlborough House, but she retained possession of Sandringham. The new king, Alexandra's son George, soon faced a decision over the Parliament Bill. Despite her personal views, Alexandra supported her son's reluctant agreement to Prime Minister H. H. Asquith's request to create sufficient Liberal peers after a general election if the Lords continued to block the legislation.|$|E
2500|$|... "I was {{overwhelmed}} by a shock of breathless delight at the originality and beauty of the interior. It felt <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> instantly transported {{far into the future}} and that I was on another planet," [...] said journalist Bernard Levin of his first impressions of the building.|$|E
2500|$|After the woman's departure, Dick began {{experiencing}} strange hallucinations. Although initially attributing them to {{side effects}} from medication, he considered this explanation implausible {{after weeks of}} continued hallucinations. [...] "I experienced an invasion of my mind by a transcendentally rational mind, <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> insane all my life and suddenly I had become sane," [...] Dick told Charles Platt.|$|E
6000|$|... "I feel <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> {{done that}} myself," [...] said Pepton. [...] "I am almost <b>as</b> proud <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> shot--well, not an eagle, but a soaring lark." ...|$|R
60|$|He started, and knit {{his brows}} <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> {{disappointed}} and displeased him.|$|R
60|$|I {{tried to}} take her in my arms. She drew back <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> frightened her.|$|R
2500|$|When Clancy {{was imprisoned}} in 1920, he participated {{a hunger strike}} with his fellow prisoners. It was here that Todd Andrews first met him. In his memoir, Dublin Made Me, Andrews {{described}} Clancy's personality: [...] "I was overcome by the extraordinary impact which Clancy’s personality had on me. I had never heard or seen Clancy before nor indeed did I ever see him again but he left an indelible impression of the superman, a man whose commands I at least would have a compulsion to obey <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> hypnotised ... In the presence of Clancy I felt a mere puppet on a string." ...|$|E
2500|$|The message (and its {{trailing}} padding) became famous, {{and created}} some ill feeling, since {{it appeared to}} be a harsh criticism by Nimitz of Halsey's decision to pursue the decoy carriers and leave the landings uncovered. [...] "I was stunned <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> struck in the face", Halsey later recalled. [...] "The paper rattled in my hands, I snatched off my cap, threw it on the deck, and shouted something I am ashamed to remember", letting out an anguished sob. RADM Robert Carney, Halsey's chief of staff (who had argued strongly in favor of pursuing the carriers), witnessed Halsey's emotional outburst and reportedly grabbed him by the shoulders and shook him, shouting, [...] "Stop it! What the hell's the matter with you? Pull yourself together!" [...] Recognizing his failure, Halsey sulked in inactivity for a full hour while Taffy 3 was fighting for its lifefalsely claiming to be refueling his shipsbefore eventually turning around with his two fastest battleships, three light cruisers and eight destroyers and heading back to Samar, too late to have any impact on the battle.|$|E
2500|$|Bowery {{used his}} body and {{manipulation}} of his flesh to create personas. This involved almost masochistically taping his torso and piercing his cheeks with pins in order to hold masks, as well as wearing outlandish makeup. [...] Freud said, [...] "the way he edits his body is amazingly aware and amazingly abandoned". In return, Bowery said of Freud: [...] "I love the psychological aspect of his work – in fact I sometimes felt <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> undergoing psychoanalysis with him ... His work is full of tension. Like me he {{is interested in the}} underbelly of things." [...] Bowery posed for a number of large full-length paintings that are considered among Freud's best work. The paintings tend to exaggerate Bowery's 6-foot 3inch, and 17 stone physique to monumental proportions. The paintings had a strong impact as part of Freud's exhibition at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in 1994. Freud said he found him [...] "perfectly beautiful", and commented, [...] "His wonderfully buoyant bulk was an instrument I felt I could use, especially those extraordinary dancer's legs." [...] Freud noted that Leigh by nature was a shy and gentle man, and his flamboyant persona was in part a form of self-defense.|$|E
60|$|She started, {{and drew}} back from me <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> struck {{her with a}} sudden terror.|$|R
6000|$|... "I can't {{understand}} it. I'm certain I {{never asked}} him to tea. Or Dunstable either. Yet they came in <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>had.</b> <b>I</b> didn't like to hurt their feelings by telling them." ...|$|R
60|$|He sighed, {{and closed}} his eyes contentedly, <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> {{relieved}} him of a heavy weight of anxiety.|$|R
60|$|Minna {{spoke to}} me as confidentially <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> her brother.|$|E
60|$|I {{started up}} <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> stung. So! At this hour! Then Messer Fifanti's suspicions did not entirely lack for grounds.|$|E
60|$|This is {{the very}} worst hour of the day. Vitality. Dull, gloomy: hate this hour. Feel <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> eaten and spewed.|$|E
60|$|The {{convinced}} way {{he surveyed}} the empty chairs made me feel <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> intruded upon a tiffin of ghostly Presences.|$|R
60|$|I {{never heard}} such sweet forbearing {{kindness}} {{expressed in a}} voice, as she expressed in making this reply. It was <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> seen her admiringly and tenderly embracing Dora, and tacitly reproving me, by her considerate protection, for my hot haste in fluttering that little heart. It was <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> seen Dora, in all her fascinating artlessness, caressing Agnes, and thanking her, and coaxingly appealing against me, and loving me with all her childish innocence.|$|R
6000|$|... "You don't say so!" [...] I cried quite {{affected}} <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> known Captain Anthony personally. [...] "Was--was Mrs Anthony lost too?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Take your {{pens and}} {{commence}} writing," [...] said I, in as dry and trite a voice <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> addressing only Jules Vanderkelkov and Co.|$|E
6000|$|... "My father! Even to {{hear that}} you had such {{thoughts}} of a daughter who never existed, strikes to my heart <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> that child." ...|$|E
6000|$|... “In a sense, you know, it was flattering; but for {{the moment}} it made me feel <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> offered a pot of mustard to sniff.” ...|$|E
60|$|THE DENTIST (shocked). Oh, don't say that. It {{makes me}} feel <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> hurt you {{for the sake of}} five shillings.|$|R
60|$|As I {{opened the}} gate I felt an odd chill of {{positive}} fear. Then she smiled <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> spoken my thought.|$|R
6000|$|Maisie surveyed--for {{the idea}} of a describable loss--the immensity of space. Then she replied lamely enough: [...] "I feel <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> lost everything." ...|$|R
6000|$|... “Upon my word,” he said, {{recovering}} {{his usual}} bearing. “It {{looks to me}} <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> asked there only for the daughter to talk to me.” ...|$|E
60|$|I {{was just}} looking round for an empty table, when a man jumped up and came towards me, {{registering}} joy <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> his long-lost sister.|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{have taken}} a very generous line, Mr. Askew," [...] he resumed. [...] "We have not been friends, but I must confess it looks <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> unjust." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I hardly know--oh, clear <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> {{had a real}} long rest. It {{was just}} like being a boy again. Influenza dispirits one so.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... ‘What is all this, sir? What is the matter? <b>I</b> feel <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> lost my senses!’ cried Neville, {{the group}} closing in around him.|$|R
60|$|It was <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> brutally struck him; I {{shall never}} forget the long, slow, almost ghastly look of pain, with which he {{answered}} me.|$|R
60|$|I {{could not}} trust myself to speak. I could only kneel at my mother's feet, and hide my face on her knees, <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> a boy again.|$|E
6000|$|I felt {{weak and}} cold <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> {{suddenly}} poisoned. I trembled, then grew hot with indignation. [...] "Sixty cents apiece!" [...] I gasped. [...] "Didn't I warn you?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Don't," [...] said I, {{rising and}} shaking myself. [...] "I've dined. I feel quite strong. I don't {{feel a bit}} <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> ill. Hallo! what land is that?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "They're true. You know they're true!" [...] {{the girl}} passionately retorted. [...] "You all treat me <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> no more soul than a telephone." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Those you all--you {{know the}} set I mean, your set--show me with {{as good a}} {{conscience}} <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> no more feeling than a letter-box." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "What {{does this}} mean? Why am <b>I</b> treated <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> no {{business}} here? Does your mother want to insult me?" [...] asked Rebecca, angrily.|$|R
