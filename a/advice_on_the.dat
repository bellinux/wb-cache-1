5|$|Apart {{from the}} preface and Francatelli's advice on serving wine, {{the body of}} the book {{consists}} almost entirely of recipes without any kind of introduction. There is no guidance on choice of kitchenware or <b>advice</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> layout of the kitchen.|$|E
5|$|Disliking honours, Pick {{declined}} {{offers of}} a knighthood and a peerage.

5|$|John Sigismund {{showed a}} {{particular}} interest in religious matters and initiated several debates among the representatives of diverse theological schools. The first debate was held between Lutheran and Calvinist priests in Medgyes (now Mediaș in Romania) in January 1560. A {{year and a half}} later, John Sigismund sent letters to the University of Wittenberg and other theological centers in Germany to seek <b>advice</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> main points of the two Protestant schools of thought.|$|E

5|$|The Clerk of the House invited Economist Dr Suzi Kerr to give {{independent}} specialist <b>advice</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Climate Change Response (Moderated Emissions Trading) Amendment Bill.

5|$|Dreyfuss {{announced}} that unlike established wooden ballparks {{such as the}} Polo Grounds, he would build a three-tiered stadium out of steel and concrete to increase longevity—the {{first of its kind}} in the nation. Charles Wellford Leavitt, Jr. was contracted to design the stadium's grandstand. A civil engineer, Leavitt had founded an engineering and landscape architecture firm in 1897. He had gained experience in steel and concrete constructs while designing the Belmont and Saratoga racetracks. Based on Dreyfuss' architectural requirements, Leavitt presented a plan for Forbes Field—the only ballpark he would design. Pirates' manager Fred Clarke also had input into the stadium's design, giving groundskeepers <b>advice</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> field, in addition to designing and patenting a device to spread and remove a canvas tarpaulin over the infield in case of rain.|$|E
5|$|Duran quickly {{allied with}} the United Earth Directorate's expeditionary force, and used UED {{resources}} to mount an assassination attempt on Mengsk and provided vital intelligence and strategic <b>advice</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Dominion to DuGalle. Duran convinced DuGalle to destroy the psi disruptor, to Stukov's chagrin, and as the UED closed in on Mengsk and his allies, Duran sabotaged a key operation, allowing the emperor to escape. When Stukov reconstructed the psi disruptor, Duran killed him and revealed his allegiance was actually to Sarah Kerrigan.|$|E

5|$|In 1790, Whinecheoh {{died at the}} age of eighty, and Succohanes died in 1792 at the age of ninety. After their deaths, Alder wandered from {{village to}} village, and began courting an Indian woman from Upper Sandusky named Barshaw. In the fall of 1793, during the peak of the Northwest Indian War, he joined Shawnee chief Blue Jacket to defend against Anthony Wayne's attacks in the Ohio Country, and also took part in the attack on Fort Recovery on June 30, 1794. Alder was asked for <b>advice</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> 1795 Treaty of Greenville on land reservations, and urged by the Indians to attend its signing. Alder, not realizing the treaty's importance, chose not to attend.|$|E
5|$|In January 1897, McKinley offered Sherman the Secretary of State position, which Sherman, {{facing a}} {{difficult}} reelection campaign in 1898, quickly accepted. His appointment was swiftly confirmed when Congress convened that March. The appointment {{was seen as}} a good one, but many in Washington soon began to question whether Sherman, at age 73, still had the strength and intellectual vigor to handle the job; rumors circulated to that effect, but McKinley did not believe them. Asked for <b>advice</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> inaugural address, Sherman offered a draft threatening intervention in Cuba, then in rebellion against Spain; the suggestion was ignored.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, {{concerns}} {{had been}} growing about the unsympathetic treatment of historic military buildings by the War Office; for its part, the War Office was concerned that it might find itself financially supporting these properties from its own budget. Yarmouth Castle was passed to the Commissioners of Woods and Forests in 1901, with parts of it were leased to the neighbouring hotel. The War Office concluded that Walmer and Deal had no remaining military value and agreed to transfer the castles to the Office of Works in 1904, who opened both former fortifications to visitors. Portland Castle was placed onto what {{was known as the}} Schedule C list, which meant that the Army would continue to use and manage the historic property, but would receive <b>advice</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> suitability of repairs from the Office of Works.|$|E

5|$|Puzzlejuice is a 2012 indie puzzle {{video game}} for iOS {{produced}} and developed by video game company Sirvo. The {{game is a}} combination of Tetris, tile-matching, and Boggle: players rearrange falling tetromino blocks into rows of similar colors, which turn into letters that are cleared from the board by forming words. The fast-paced game also includes challenges and power-ups. The development team consisted three people; programmer Asher Vollmer initially developed the game alone, before reaching out to artist Greg Wohlwend for <b>advice</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> aesthetics. Composer Jimmy Hinson produced the game's music.|$|E
5|$|The attack {{followed}} a two-year lull in Allied aircraft carrier operations against Norway, {{and took the}} German forces by surprise. The choice of the target area was guided by intelligence gained from decoding German radio signals and reports from Norwegian Secret Intelligence Service agents, and two Norwegian airmen flew with the attack force to provide <b>advice</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> local geography. While historians have {{found it difficult to}} determine the exact number of ships sunk, Operation Leader damaged the German war effort by considerably disrupting the convoy system in the region and reducing shipments of iron ore.|$|E
5|$|The final episode begins after Becky and Michael {{had slept}} {{together}} while house sitting for Tracy and Robert, and Michael hides {{in the bathroom}} when the latter couple return. Tracy phones a morning television phone-in show (hosted by Michael Thomas and Helen Atkinson-Wood, with appearances by Rachael Fielding and Jonathan Barlow), and when she realises that the show's divorce expert is hiding in her bathroom she takes on his role (with a heavy Northern accent, actually a slightly exaggerated version of Bennett's own voice) to give herself <b>advice</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> other line. Bennett says this was the hardest thing she has had to do in her career.|$|E

5|$|The {{first draft}} {{and part of}} the editing process was {{completed}} before Fleming's death and the manuscript had passed through the hands of his copy editor, William Plomer, but it was not as polished as other Bond stories. Much of the detail contained in the previous novels was missing, as this was often added by Fleming in the second draft. Publishers Jonathan Cape passed the manuscript to Kingsley Amis for his thoughts and <b>advice</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> story, although his suggestions were not subsequently used.|$|E
5|$|Together, Schmitt, Kutuzov and {{the other}} generals, with von Stiebar's <b>advice</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> local terrain, concocted a plan to {{encircle}} the French at Dürenstein. Russian commander Mikhail Miloradovich would approach Gazan's division from the east, supported by Pyotr Bagration's corps, and pin the French in place. Three additional columns, commanded by Dmitry Dokhturov (Doctorov), Maj. Gen. Strik and Schmitt, would outflank the French from {{the west and the}} north. They would offer, as bait, a rumor: the Russian army was retreating into Moravia and only a rearguard would be left at Krems.|$|E
5|$|Walt Patterson, {{who acted}} as series adviser, {{was a leading}} {{commentator}} on nuclear affairs, {{best known for his}} book Nuclear Power (Penguin, 1976–1986).

5|$|Between 1913 and 1916, Gerhard Heilmann {{published}} {{a series of}} articles in the journal of the Danish Ornithological Society, all heavily illustrated and dealing with the question of the origin of birds. He first proposed the idea of a popular treatise on bird evolution in 1912 to Otto Helms, the editor of the journal of the Danish Ornithological Society. Helms supported the idea but recommended that Heilmann first seek professional <b>advice</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> topic. Despite the lack of formal training in zoology, Heilmann succeeded in amassing his research with the help of several others, including the expert in prehistoric animals at the Zoological Museum in Copenhagen, Adolf Herluf Winge, and the biologist D'Arcy Wentworth Thompson of the University of Dundee. Winge, though initially showing interest in Heilmann's work, later proved {{to be a source of}} frustration by refusing to engage Heilmann in depth on various scientific queries. Heilmann eventually broke off contact, expressing some bitterness at the apparent change of heart, which Heilmann later ascribed to Winge's belief in Lamarckism.|$|E
5|$|Following her father's <b>advice</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> {{importance}} of getting an education or a trade, Bancroft {{completed high school}} in Tenterfield before moving to Canberra in 1976 with her husband-to-be Ned Manning, who had also been her teacher. There Bancroft completed a Diploma of Visual Communications through the Canberra School of Art, followed by a Master of Studio Practice and a Master of Visual Arts (Paintings) at the University of Sydney. She never returned to live in Tenterfield, although her three sisters were living there in 2004. Her father died around 1990. Bancroft has three children: Jack was born in 1985, Ella in 1988. She separated from Manning when they were very young; her third child Rubyrose was born in 1999. Jack was awarded NSW Young Australian of the Year in 2010 for his work arranging the mentoring of Indigenous school students.|$|E
