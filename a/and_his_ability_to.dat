5|$|Execution by {{elephant}} was {{a common}} method of capital punishment in South and Southeast Asia, particularly in India, where Asian elephants were used to crush, dismember, or torture captives in public executions. The animals were trained and versatile, able to kill victims immediately or to torture them slowly over a prolonged period. Most commonly employed by royalty, the elephants were used to signify both the ruler's absolute power <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> control wild animals.|$|E
5|$|In 1811, {{one of his}} paintings, Telemachus Rescues Antiope {{from the}} Fury of the Wild Boar, was finally {{accepted}} for the Summer Exhibition. Etty was becoming widely respected at the Royal Academy for his painting, particularly his use of colour <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> produce realistic flesh tones, and from 1811 onwards {{had at least one}} work accepted for the Summer Exhibition each year. However, he had little commercial success and generated little interest over the next few years.|$|E

5|$|Among Cincinnati receivers, {{there was}} none of the {{uncertainty}} that afflicted the Bearcats' quarterbacks. Wide receiver Mardy Gilyard caught 74passes during the regular season, setting a Cincinnati record with 1,118receiving yards. He also had 10touchdowns during the season, leading all Cincinnati players. Gilyard also played as the Bearcats' primary kick returner. He returned 32kicks, accumulating a school-record 897yards and 2touchdowns. Fellow wide receiver Dominick Goodman outpaced Gilyard in receptions with 78, but he had only 977receiving yards and 7touchdowns. On the first play of Cincinnati's game against Hawaii, Dominick injured his shoulder <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> play in the Orange Bowl was in doubt.|$|E
5|$|At age seven de Candolle {{contracted}} of {{a severe}} case of hydrocephalus, which significantly affected his childhood. Nevertheless, {{he is said}} to have had great aptitude for learning, distinguishing himself in school with his rapid acquisition of knowledge in classical and general literature <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> write fine poetry. In 1794, he began his scientific studies at the Collège Calvin, where he studied under Jean Pierre Étienne Vaucher, who later inspired de Candolle to make botanical science the chief pursuit of his life.|$|E
5|$|David John Cawdell Irving (born 24 March 1938) is an English Holocaust denier {{and author}} {{who has written}} on the {{military}} and political history of World War II, {{with a focus on}} Nazi Germany. His works include The Destruction of Dresden (1963), Hitler's War (1977), Churchill's War (1987), and Goebbels: Mastermind of the Third Reich (1996). In his works, he argued that Hitler did not know of the extermination of Jews or, if he did, opposed it. Though Irving's revisionist views of World War II were never taken seriously by mainstream historians, he was once recognised for his knowledge of Nazi Germany <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> unearth new historical documents.|$|E

Trevor also increased the usage of more millennial based references, impersonations & characterisations for his comedy on the show, due to his younger demographic <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> speak in multiple accents and eight languages.|$|E
5|$|Manga and anime {{publications}} have {{commented on}} Kira's character, and he received mainly positive critical responses. IGN's Andy Patrizio said Kira's character was likable {{and the only}} problem he found was how he often repeated Athrun Zala's name in early episodes. THEM Anime Reviews' Derrick L. Tucker said {{he was one of}} the strongest characters from the series; Tucker also said he was likable despite his angsty displays. Tucker also compared him with Amuro Ray from the first Gundam series, Mobile Suit Gundam, finding both likeable. Chris Beveridge from Mania Entertainment liked Kira's handling of the mobile suits <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> reprogram them, finding it as a new concept in the Gundam franchise.|$|E
5|$|Many of the henchmen {{employed}} by the villains may have unique weapons; Oddjob, Auric Goldfinger's enforcer, carries a bowler hat with a razor-sharp blade concealed in the rim, while Xenia Onatopp is known to crush victims to death with her thighs during intercourse. In addition to these weapons, many of the henchmen are physically different; the over-large Tee Hee had an iron claw, Jaws, an assassin with steel teeth, was played by 2.18m (7'2") actor Richard Kiel, whilst Renard (the henchman to the main villainess Elektra) survived being shot in the head, which progressively killed off his senses <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> feel pain.|$|E
25|$|However, nagging {{questions}} persisted about Harrow's <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> work cooperatively with <b>his</b> superiors <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>abilities</b> <b>to</b> lead <b>and</b> inspire soldiers, as well {{as about}} his sobriety. In his official report on Gettysburg, John Gibbon, Harrow's superior, openly praised his other two division commanders, but, notably, did not mention Harrow in his litany of officers deserving recognition. Soon afterward, Harrow was relieved of command and never again served in the Army of the Potomac, but he was soon reinstated in field command by his old friend, President Abraham Lincoln.|$|R

5|$|Midas is a verse {{drama in}} blank verse by the Romantic writers Mary Shelley and Percy Bysshe Shelley. Mary wrote the drama and Percy contributed two lyric poems to it. Written in 1820 while the Shelleys {{were living in}} Italy, Mary Shelley tried unsuccessfully to have the play {{published}} by children's magazines in England in the 1830s; however, it was not published until A. Koszul's 1922 scholarly edition. Whether or not the drama was ever meant to be staged {{is a point of}} debate among scholars. The play combines the stories of the musical contest between Apollo and Pan and that of King Midas <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> turn everything he touches to gold.|$|E
5|$|Offa's Dyke, most {{of which}} was {{probably}} built in his reign, is a testimony to the extensive resources Offa had at his command <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> organise them. Other surviving sources include a problematic document known as the Tribal Hidage, which may provide further evidence of Offa's scope as a ruler, though its attribution to his reign is disputed. A significant corpus of letters dates from the period, especially from Alcuin, an English deacon and scholar who spent over a decade at Charlemagne's court {{as one of his}} chief advisors, and corresponded with kings, nobles and ecclesiastics throughout England. These letters in particular reveal Offa's relations with the continent, as does his coinage, which was based on Carolingian examples.|$|E
5|$|Patton's {{colorful}} image, hard-driving {{personality and}} {{success as a}} commander were at times overshadowed by his controversial public statements. His philosophy of leading from the front <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> inspire troops with vulgarity-ridden speeches, such as a famous address to the Third Army, attracted favorable attention. His strong emphasis on rapid and aggressive offensive action proved effective. While Allied leaders held sharply differing opinions on Patton, he was regarded highly by his opponents in the German High Command. A popular, award-winning biographical film released in 1970 helped transform Patton into an American hero.|$|E

5|$|Schwarzkopf {{returned}} to the United States after the Gulf War as a national hero, <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> effectively deal with the press left him a positive image. Schwarzkopf indicated a desire to retire from the military in mid-1991. He was initially considered for promotion alternatively to General of the Army or to Army Chief of Staff, and was ultimately asked to assume the latter post, but he declined. He was later questioned about running for political office, but, considering himself an independent, expressed little interest in doing so. Schwarzkopf was not vocal about his political opinions during his military career. He retired from the military in August 1991, moving to Tampa, Florida.|$|E
5|$|Tonelli {{retired after}} the Games. His aquatic success was not derived from any {{physical}} advantage, {{as he was}} relatively small for a swimmer. He was only 185cm tall and weighed 70kg, with relatively small hands and feet. Tonelli felt that his success was based around his ability to make fast starts from the blocks, and attributed his success to his mental approach <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> convert his energy into a fast swim in under one minute. He had a deliberate strategy of making himself nervous before the race, feeling that he thrived on pressure.|$|E
5|$|A complete, consistent, hardworking and {{versatile}} midfielder, Alonso {{is regarded as}} one of the best players of his generation, and is effective both creatively and defensively. Gifted with good technique, excellent vision, and varied passing range, he excels in the centre in a deep-lying playmaking role, where he can best use his accurate long passing ability to create goal scoring chances for teammates; he also possesses a powerful and accurate shot from distance, and he is an effective set-piece and penalty kick taker. Due to his height, positioning, and physical characteristics, Xabi Alonso is also effective in the air, often contributing with headed goals from set pieces when advancing into more offensive positions. In addition to his creative attributes, he is also capable of excelling as a defensive midfielder due to his strength and powerful physique, combined with his tenacity, tactical intelligence, aggressive tackling <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> read the game. He has at times been criticised, however, for occasionally committing rash challenges and for his tendency to lose his composure and pick up unnecessary cards for particularly hard fouls.|$|E

5|$|A less violent side to Alexander's {{government}} {{is demonstrated by}} other evidence. Over a century after his time, his administrative decisions were still being cited as precedents. Some of these are known from a surviving edict issued on July 6, 68, {{less than a month}} after Nero's death. This denounces, and introduces measures against, a variety of abuses including inaccurate tax assessments, malicious prosecutions and the imprisonment of debtors by private creditors. The edict's only allusion to the chaotic political situation comes as a call for trust in the benevolence of the new Emperor, Galba, <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> put right the wrongs of the past. Alexander was making representations to Galba on behalf of the provincials, presumably representing the desired reforms as the price of loyalty from this vital grain-producing province.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{speculation}} {{that he would}} lead the team, as Bradman had made himself unavailable due to concerns over fitness <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> play at his pre-war world-leading standards, the Australian Board of Control appointed Bill Brown as captain and O'Reilly as Brown's deputy. In the Board's ballot for the leadership positions, Hassett received {{only one of the}} 13 votes, although it was enough to make him the third on-tour selector. One motive speculated for his being overlooked was that he had rested himself from the match against Victoria because he was tired of the long periods in the military away from his family and decided instead to spend the time in Melbourne with his wife and young daughter; this supposedly drew the ire of the Victorian Cricket Association.|$|E
5|$|Following his {{resignation}} from the Walter and Eliza Hall Institute, Burnet was offered an {{office at the}} University of Melbourne in the School of Microbiology. While at the university, he wrote 13 books {{on a variety of}} topics including immunology, ageing and cancer, and human biology. He also wrote an autobiography entitled Changing Patterns: An Atypical Autobiography, which was released in 1968. In all, he wrote a further 16 books after his retirement from the Hall Institute. He was known for his ability to write quickly, often without a final draft, <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> convey a message to readers from a wide spectrum of backgrounds, but he was himself sceptical that his opinions had much influence. In 1969 he published Cellular Immunology, considered his magnum opus on immunity, attempted to show how various phenomena could be predicted by the clonal selection theory. The following year, he wrote Immunological Surveillance, which expounded his established opinion that mammals could immunise themselves through their ability to detect foreign patterns in the body. He continued to maintain an intense and focused work schedule, often shunning others to keep up a heavy writing load.|$|E
