25|$|Holy {{water is}} not a term used in Church of England rites, {{although}} font water is sanctified in the Church of England baptism rite. In contrast, the Episcopal Church (United States) does expressly mention the optional use of holy water in some recent liturgies of blessing. More generally, the use of water within High Church Anglicanism or Anglo-Catholicism adheres closely to Roman Catholic practice. In many such Anglican churches baptismal water {{is used for the}} <b>asperges.</b> Stoups with sanctified water are sometimes found near the doors of High Church Anglican churches for the faithful to use in making {{the sign of the cross}} upon entering the church.|$|E
25|$|On 4 April, {{the body}} of John Paul II was moved onto a red velvet catafalque, with his head propped on three red pillows. The Papal Gentlemen, clothed in black morning coats and white gloves, were chosen as pallbearers and stood {{along the sides of}} the pope's bier. Cardinal Martínez Somalo, dressed in red and gold vestments, officiated the <b>asperges</b> rite. He blessed the pope with the holy waters of baptism three times: {{to the right of the}} pope, at his head and then to his left. An acolyte then brought to the Camerlengo a {{thurible}} and boat. Cardinal Martínez Somalo incensed the pope three times.|$|E

40|$|We {{describe}} {{an extension of}} the FeynRules package dedicated to the automatic generation of the mass spectrum associated with any Lagrangian-based quantum field theory. After introducing a simplified way to implement particle mixings, we present a new class of FeynRules functions allowing both for the analytical computation of all the model mass matrices and for the generation of a C++ package, dubbed <b>ASperGe.</b> This program can then be further employed for a numerical evaluation of the rotation matrices necessary to diagonalize the field basis. We illustrate these features {{in the context of the}} Two-Higgs-Doublet Model, the Minimal Left-Right Symmetric Standard Model and the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model.

The deacon and sub-deacon should be holding the ends of the cope.) ...|$|E

In general, between 30 % and 50 % of natural tannins {{is added to the}} components used to obtain polymerisation of the polyurethane. The characteristic of these new, partially biosourced polyurethanes is that the tannin present slows down burning, some of them can be made flame self-extinguishing and if burning they neither flow nor <b>asperge</b> flaming material around, contrary to what occurs with normal polyurethanes. This limits the possibility of transmitting fire to other materials in the same environment.

5000|$|A {{letter from}} Pope Zachary to St. Boniface (1 May, 748, reports that an English synod had {{forbidden}} any baptism {{except in the}} name of the Trinity and declared that whoever omits the Name of any Person of the Trinity does not truly baptise. Henry Spelman and Wilkins put this synod at London in 603, the time of St. Augustine while Mansi makes its date the first year of Theodore of Tarsus, 668. The possibility of priests, presumably Irish, having been invalidly baptized was considered in the [...] "Poenitentiale Theodori" [...] (Lib. II, cap. iii, 13), and in cap. ix of the same book, after ordering the reordination of those ordained by Scottish and British bishops [...] "who are not Catholic in their Easter and tonsure" [...] and the <b>asperging</b> of churches consecrated by them. It has been conjectured that the British Church resembled the Hispanic in baptizing with a single immersion. This form had been allowed by Rome in the case of Iberia.|$|R
2500|$|<b>Asperges</b> (only on Sundays at the {{principal}} Mass of the day). The <b>Asperges</b> is only of obligation in cathedral and collegiate churches, {{but it was}} required by the bishops of England for all parish churches. This ceremony of sprinkling the congregation with lustral water is performed by the celebrant {{with the assistance of}} the other sacred ministers. After blessing the altar, himself, and the sacred ministers and servers, the celebrant then proceeds through the nave of the church to bless the congregation. All the while the choir, or a cantor, is singing the text from Psalm 50, verse 9 (all Biblical references from here on are from the Douay-Rheims Bible) [...] "Thou shalt sprinkle me with hyssop, and I shall be cleansed: thou shalt wash me, and I shall be made whiter than snow." [...] After the sacred ministers have returned to the altar a few verses and responses are sung between the celebrant and everyone else. The sacred ministers then go to the sedilia (the bench or seats where the sacred ministers sit during parts of the Mass) to put on their maniples and to help the celebrant change from cope to chasuble.|$|E
2500|$|In the sacristy, before vesting, {{all three}} sacred ministers (priest celebrant, deacon, and subdeacon) wash their hands. The sacred ministers recite certain prayers while they place on each vestment. First, the amice (a {{rectangular}} cloth of linen with long strings for tying) is kissed (if it is embroidered with a cross) and then placed {{on top of}} the head briefly while reciting one of the prayers during vesting. Then it is tied around the shoulders {{on top of the}} cassock (or on top of the habit, if the sacred ministers belongs to a religious order with one). Next the alb (a long linen tunic with sleeves) is put on. The cincture (in Latin, cinctura), a long cloth cord also called a girdle, is then tied around the waist. The subdeacon then completes his vesting by placing the maniple (an embroidered piece of fabric, folded in half, with a cross in the middle) on his left arm (provided there is no <b>Asperges</b> or other liturgical ceremony before Mass begins), securing it either with pins or with the ribbons or elastic inside, and then the tunicle (an embroidered tunic with short sleeves) over all. The deacon places his stole (a long narrow embroidered piece of cloth, similar to the maniple but of greater length) over his left shoulder and binds it in place, at his right hip, with the cincture or girdle. He then puts on the maniple and his dalmatic (similar to the tunicle). The priest celebrant does the same except that he crosses his stole in front of him at the waist, binding it with the girdle or cincture. After the maniple he puts on a cope (a long, heavy embroidered cape) if the Mass is preceded by the <b>Asperges</b> (sprinkling the congregation with holy water). [...] Following the <b>Asperges,</b> the celebrant, assisted by the acolytes, removes the cope and puts on the chasuble (similar to the tunicle, but without sleeves and usually with an embroidered cross or image on the back).|$|E
2500|$|Prelate Michael Arneth noticed Bruckner's bad {{situation}} in Windhaag and awarded him a teacher's assistant {{position in the}} vicinity of the monastic town of Sankt Florian, sending him to Kronstorf an der Enns for two years. Here he would be able to have more of a part in musical activity. The time in Kronstorf was a much happier one for Bruckner. Between 1843 and 1845, Bruckner was the pupil of Leopold von Zenetti in Enns. Compared to the few works he wrote in Windhaag, the Kronstorf compositions from 1843–1845 show a significantly improved artistic ability, and finally the beginnings of what could be called [...] "the Bruckner style". Among the Kronstorf works is the vocal piece <b>Asperges</b> me (WAB 4), which the young teacher's assistant, out of line of his position, signed with [...] "Anton Bruckner m.p.ria. Comp". This has been interpreted as a lone early sign of Bruckner's artistic ambitions. Otherwise, little is known of Bruckner's life plans and intentions.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Asperges</b> (Sprinkling with holy water, Psalm [...] ) is an {{optional}} penitential rite that ordinarily precedes only the principal Mass on Sunday. In the sacristy, a priest wearing an alb, {{if he is}} to celebrate the Mass, or surplice, if he is not the celebrant of the Mass, and vested with a stole, which is the color of the day if the priest is the celebrant of the Mass or purple if he is not the celebrant of the Mass, exorcises and blesses salt and water, then puts the blessed salt into the water by thrice sprinkling it {{in the form of a}} cross while saying once, [...] "Commixtio salis et aquæ pariter fiat in nomine Patris, et Filii et Spiritus Sancti" [...] (May a mixture of salt and water now be made in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit). After that, the priest, vested in a cope of the color of the day, while the choir sings an antiphon and a verse of Psalm 50/51 or 117/118, sprinkles with the holy water the altar three times, and then the clergy and the congregation. This rite, if used, precedes the Prayers at the Foot of the Altar. During the Easter season, the [...] "Asperges me..." [...] verse is replaced by the [...] "Vidi aquam..." [...] verse, and [...] "Alleluia" [...] is added to the [...] "Ostende nobis..." [...] verse and to its response.|$|E

6000|$|A {{little while}} ago, the New York papers {{were filled with}} an account of a dog's lunch given at the Vanderbilt Hotel by an ultra-fashionable American lady. It was {{recorded}} that Vi Sin, the Pekin Spaniel of Mrs. H. of New York, was host to about ten thousand dollars worth of [...] "smart" [...] dogs. I {{do not know whether}} or not this story is true, for I only read it in the Parisian papers. But certain it is that the episode would have made no sensation in Paris. A dog eating in a restaurant is a most ordinary spectacle. Only a few days ago I had lunch with a dog,--a very quiet, sensible Belgian poodle, very simply dressed in a plain morning stomach coat of ultramarine with leather insertions. I took quite a fancy to him. When I say that I had lunch with him, I ought to explain that he had a lady, his mistress, with him,--that also is quite usual in Paris. But I didn't know her, and she sat on the further side of him, so that I confined myself to ordinary table civilities with the dog. I was having merely a plain omelette, from motives of economy, and the dog had a little dish of entrecote d'agneau aux <b>asperges</b> maître d'hôtel. I took some of it while the lady was speaking to the waiter and found it excellent. You may believe it or not, but the entry of a dog into a French restaurant and his being seated at a table and having his food ordered creates not the slightest sensation. To bring a child into a really good restaurant would, I imagine, be looked upon as rather a serious affair.|$|E
