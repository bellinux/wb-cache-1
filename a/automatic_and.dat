5|$|A {{variant of}} the Automatic Block System, <b>Automatic</b> <b>and</b> Track Control (ATC) has since been introduced, which {{provides}} the same benefits as ABS on single lines of track, while still ensuring only one train in a section at a time. Centralised Traffic Control was also introduced in the 1960s on the new standard gauge line to Albury, {{and then on the}} main interstate line to Adelaide, allowing trains to be directed from a distance.|$|E

40|$|The {{obtained}} results {{allow to}} decide the questions of the standardization and provement of safety of the railway <b>automatics</b> <b>and</b> telemechanics systems, the increase of efficiency and safety of transmission and processing of information in the systems of the dispatcher control of the railway trains motion. The application of the developed methods and means widen the functional possibilities of such systems. The developed methods and means of ensurance of safety of the microelectronic systems allows to speed {{the introduction of the}} computer systems of the railway <b>automatics</b> <b>and</b> telemechanies. The methodological and organisation bases of certification of the RATS for safety have been developed, the order and the composition of the tests for safety has been determined. The systems of the normative documents, regulating the requirements and norms of safety at the creation and manufacture of the railway <b>automatics</b> <b>and</b> telemechanics, has been created. The system for the dispatcher centralization DC-MPK has been introduced in constant operation in the St. -Petersburg metropolitene and Oktyabrsky railway, 15 normative documents "The Safety of the Railway <b>Automatics</b> <b>and</b> Telemechanics", and ETT for DC systems have been developed, the system of certification for the railway <b>automatics</b> <b>and</b> telemechanics means has been created.

5|$|The 2006–07 {{season was}} the 124th year of {{football}} played by Bristol Rovers, and their 80th season in The Football League, and covers {{the period from}} 1 July 2006 to 30 June 2007. After finishing sixth in Football League Two, Rovers won the playoff final {{for the first time}} in their history, and won promotion for only the fourth time since joining The Football League. The previous promotions were all <b>automatic,</b> <b>and</b> came in the 1952–53, 1973–74 and 1989–90 seasons.|$|E
5|$|GTAW welding torches are {{designed}} for either automatic or manual operation and are equipped with cooling systems using air or water. The <b>automatic</b> <b>and</b> manual torches are similar in construction, but the manual torch has a handle while the automatic torch normally comes with a mounting rack. The angle between the centerline of the handle and the centerline of the tungsten electrode, known as the head angle, can be varied on some manual torches according to the preference of the operator. Air cooling systems are most often used for low-current operations (up to about 200A), while water cooling is required for high-current welding (up to about 600A). The torches are connected with cables to the power supply and with hoses to the shielding gas source and where used, the water supply.|$|E
5|$|One {{industrial}} application for helium is leak detection. Because helium diffuses through solids three {{times faster than}} air, it {{is used as a}} tracer gas to detect leaks in high-vacuum equipment (such as cryogenic tanks) and high-pressure containers. The tested object is placed in a chamber, which is then evacuated and filled with helium. The helium that escapes through the leaks is detected by a sensitive device (helium mass spectrometer), even at the leak rates as small as 10−9 mbar·L/s (10−10 Pa·m3/s). The measurement procedure is normally <b>automatic</b> <b>and</b> is called helium integral test. A simpler procedure is to fill the tested object with helium and to manually search for leaks with a hand-held device.|$|E

Chong Chieng Jen, the {{director}} of the DAP's by-election campaign, pointed out that those who decided not to renew their 60-year land leases would have their land returned to the government without compensation, and that even if the government approved requests to have leases renewed, landholders would have to pay large premiums. Chong said that the DAP on the other hand wanted the current state land code to be amended to allow for the <b>automatic</b> <b>and</b> unconditional renewal of all leased land for a period of 99 years.|$|E
5|$|The North Koreans were {{apparently}} {{unaware of the}} 1st Battalion withdrawal, because the next morning, July 25, two North Korean battalions in a double envelopment came in behind the positions 1st Battalion held the night before, but in front of Major Gordon E. Murch's 2nd Battalion. There the North Koreans {{were caught in the}} open by the combined fire of American tanks, artillery, and mortar, and the 2nd Battalion's <b>automatic</b> <b>and</b> small arms fire. The North Koreans suffered large numbers of casualties in this attack. Surviving remnants of the two North Koreans battalions withdrew in confusion. The 2nd Battalion took about 30 prisoners.|$|E
5|$|The {{control pad}} {{may be used}} to move the hero in any {{direction}} and to move the flashing cursor in menu displays. Additional buttons confirm and cancel commands. In the English version, players use menu commands to talk to people, check their status, search beneath their feet, use items, take treasure chests, open doors, and go up or down stairs. However, in some of the game's later remakes, certain commands were assigned to buttons, navigating stairs became <b>automatic,</b> <b>and</b> the hero's speed was increased. In the Japanese version, characters always face forward, so players must choose a command and then a direction in which to perform that action. In the North American version, the hero turns to face the direction he is moving, making direction selection unnecessary.|$|E

5|$|In the 17th century, a {{midshipman}} was {{a rating}} for an experienced seaman, {{and the word}} derives from the area aboard a ship, amidships, either where the original rating worked on the ship, or where he was berthed. Beginning in the 18th century, a commissioned officer candidate was rated as a midshipman, and the seaman rating began to slowly die out. By the Napoleonic era (1793–1815), a midshipman was an apprentice officer who had previously served {{at least three years}} as a volunteer, officer's servant or able seaman, and was roughly equivalent to a present-day petty officer in rank and responsibilities. After serving at least three years as a midshipman or master's mate, he was eligible to take the examination for lieutenant. Promotion to lieutenant was not <b>automatic,</b> <b>and</b> many midshipmen took positions as master's mates for an increase in pay and responsibility aboard ship. Midshipmen in the United States Navy were trained and served similarly to midshipman in the Royal Navy, although unlike their counterparts in the Royal Navy, a midshipman was a warrant officer rank until 1912.|$|E
