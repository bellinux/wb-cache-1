5|$|Lewis Wendell Willkie {{was born}} in Elwood, Indiana, on February 18, 1892, the son of Henrietta (Trisch) and Herman Francis Willkie. Both of his parents were lawyers, his mother {{being one of the}} first women {{admitted}} to the Indiana bar. His father {{was born in}} Germany and his mother was born in Indiana, to German parents; his grandparents were involved in the unsuccessful 1848 revolutions in Germany. The Trisches initially settled in Kansas Territory but, as they were abolitionists, moved to Indiana after the territory was opened to slavery in the mid-1850s. Willkie was the fourth of six children, all intelligent, and learned skills during the nightly debates <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>dinner</b> <b>table</b> that would later serve him well.|$|E

40|$|Hendrik Jan Hoogendoom and {{his parents}} sat <b>around</b> <b>the</b> family <b>dinner</b> <b>table</b> and once again {{discussed}} the key problem facing the business in which they all worked. There had been many changes {{in the use of}} their land {{over the past two decades}} but they knew that they had not yet achieved the maximum economic return from it. Currently, the primary income came from recreation activities, which were extremely successful for six months of the year. But the challenge remained on how they could keep the business equally active during the long cold winter months...|$|R
2500|$|In late 2010, Hopkins {{suggested}} that African American fighters who possessed {{what he described}} as a [...] "slick" [...] inner-city style of fighting would be successful against Filipino boxer Manny Pacquiao. [...] "Maybe I'm biased because I'm black, but I think that this is what is said at people's homes and <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>dinner</b> <b>table</b> among black boxing fans and fighters. Most of them won't say it [...] because they're not being real and they don't have the balls to say it. But I do think that a fighter like the Ray Leonards or anyone like that would beat a guy [...] if they come with their game. Listen, this ain't a racial thing, but then again, maybe it is. But the style that is embedded in most of us black fighters, that style could be a problem to any other style of fighting." ...|$|E
2500|$|Mr. Cheong, {{considers}} {{his wife}} to be [...] "completely unremarkable in any way". He explains that when he first met her, he was not even attracted to her and that suits him just fine. Mr. Cheong is content meandering through life; {{it seems as if}} his only goal is to live a conventional, unremarkable life. He chooses to marry his wife since he thinks she would prove to be a good, dutiful wife who would fit nicely into the kind of lifestyle he seeks. [...] After several years of relatively normal marriage, Mr. Cheong wakes up to find his wife disposing of all meat products in the house. He demands an explanation, and Yeong-hye replies vaguely that [...] "I had a dream." [...] Mr. Cheong attempts to rationalize his wife's life decision {{over the next few months}} and to deal with vegetarian meals at home, but eventually calls Yeong-hye's family and an intervention is scheduled. While <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>dinner</b> <b>table,</b> Yeong-hye's family attempts to convince her to eat meat; her father, who served in Vietnam and is known for his stern temperament, slaps her when she refuses. Her father then asks a reluctant Mr. Cheong and Yeong-hye's brother Yeong-ho to hold her arms while he force-feeds her a piece of pork. Yeong-hye breaks away, spits out the pork, grabs a fruit knife, and slits her wrist. The incredulous family rushes her to a hospital where she recovers and where Mr. Cheong admits to himself that she has become mentally unstable. As the section ends Yeong-hye manages to walk out of the hospital and when she is tracked down, she reveals a bird in her palm, which has a [...] "predator's bite" [...] in it, and she asks [...] "Have I done something wrong?" ...|$|E
60|$|As {{the evening}} deepened I {{perceived}} that her long stay in England and in France {{had done a}} great deal for Zulime Taft.

As we settled into our seats <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>dinner</b> <b>table,</b> I was glad to find her opposite me.|$|E

40|$|Art {{does not}} deceive its readers with an {{illusion}} of reality, as the common-sense notion has it, but rather pretends to deceive them. For the communicative power {{of the work of}} art lies precisely in the fact that we recognise its artificiality, its status as a work within a given genre, following certain conventions, set in a particular frame. What the work really points to, beyond the page, is the existence and actions of a creative consciousness, as that consciousness works through a given set of symbols to express itself. For reading is all about experiencing another’s mind. In the lack. Which makes it a matter of desire. My purpose in the following is to use literature to crack open the everyday, to write about neurosis and psychosis, how they write their way into <b>the</b> real world <b>around</b> us, <b>the</b> <b>dinner</b> <b>table,</b> this novel, a Greek tragedy, I mean Oedipus complex...|$|R
40|$|Teaching is political. Paul Thomas, Professor of Education, Furman University {{wrote on}} his blog (15 February 2017), “Everything {{involving}} humans is necessarily political, even and especially teaching and learning. ” Thomas goes on, “Therefore, no teacher {{at any level}} can truly be apolitical, objective. Taking a neutral or objective pose is a political choice, and an endorsement of the status quo. ” Here Thomas is echoing Paulo Freire’s well-known proposition, “Washing one’s hands of {{the conflict between the}} powerful and the powerless means to side with the powerful, not to be neutral” (1984, p. 524). In this New Zealand election year (2017), we invited John O’Neill, Martin Thrupp and Liz Gordon to speak to teachers and school leaders about their particular current educational concerns. It was the intention to provide food for thought for teachers/school leaders and to encourage dialogue <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>dinner</b> party <b>table,</b> BBQ or other social gathering where the election might be discussed...|$|R

As they lingered <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>dinner</b> <b>table</b> at Ingleside, talking of the war, the {{telephone}} had rung. It was a long-distance call from Charlottetown for Jem. When he had finished talking he hung up the receiver and turned around, with a flushed face and glowing eyes. Before he had said a word his mother and Nan and Di had turned pale. As for Rilla, {{for the first time}} in her life she felt that every one must hear her heart beating and that something had clutched at her throat.|$|E
6000|$|I don't mean to {{deny that}} the American funny story, in capable hands, is amazingly funny {{and that it does}} {{brighten}} up human intercourse. But the real trouble lies, not in the fun of the story, but in the painful waiting for the point to come and in the strained and anxious silence that succeeds it. Each person <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>dinner</b> <b>table</b> is trying to [...] "think of another." [...] There is a dreadful pause. The hostess puts up a prayer that some one may [...] "think of another." [...] Then at last, to the relief of everybody, some one says: [...] "I heard a story the other day--I don't know whether you've heard it--" [...] And the grateful cries of [...] "No! no! go ahead" [...] show how great the tension has been.|$|E

5000|$|In Shadis #2 (March/April 1990), Jolly Blackburn {{began to}} run a comic thathe had written called Knights of <b>the</b> <b>Dinner</b> <b>Table,</b> which {{depicted}} <b>the</b> humorous interactions of a gaming group. When Blackburn published that first Knights strip, he {{thought that he was}} just filling a blank page but when he tried to replace it with more professional strips beginning with Shadis #6, there was an outcry; because of that outcry Knights soon returned. Blackburn also published Knights of <b>the</b> <b>Dinner</b> <b>Table</b> as a comic book, the first three issues of which appeared from his company Alderac Entertainment Games over the next year (1994-1995). As a result of diverging interests with his partners, Blackburn left Alderac in 1995, with Shadis #21 (December 1995) being his final issue; he kept the rights to Knights of <b>the</b> <b>Dinner</b> <b>Table.</b> Blackburn formed a new company called KODT Enteractive Facktory, which was to publish the Knights of <b>the</b> <b>Dinner</b> <b>Table</b> comic monthly. While he was working on getting that new company together, Blackburn received a call from the editor of TSRs Dragon magazine, asking if the Knights of <b>the</b> <b>Dinner</b> <b>Table</b> strip was now available; although Blackburn originally planned to continue the strip in Shadis, he accepted the offer and Knights of <b>the</b> <b>Dinner</b> <b>Table</b> thus began appearing beginning in Dragon #226 (February, 1996). While working on Knights of <b>the</b> <b>Dinner</b> <b>Table</b> #4 (1996), Blackburn concluded that he really {{did not want to go}} it alone, and David Kenzer and the staff of Kenzer & Company wanted to get Blackburn to join their company. In November 1996 when David Kenzer and others were visiting Blackburn over the course of a local con, and Blackburn decided that Kenzer had the sort of business sense and integrity that he was looking for in a partner. Starting with issue #5 (February 1997) Knights of <b>the</b> <b>Dinner</b> <b>Table</b> was <b>the</b> work of the [...] "KoTD Development Team" [...] which consisted of Jolly Blackburn, David Kenzer, Brian Jelke and Steve Johansson.|$|R
