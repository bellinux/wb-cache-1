The Commission rejected the Barber <b>and</b> <b>Morgan</b> designs and proposed Adolph Weinman, Hermon MacNeil, and Albin Polasek as designers.

The Late Miocene extinction of Indian sivaladapids may be related to a decline in forest cover in Asia and to competition by immigrating colobine monkeys.|$|E
