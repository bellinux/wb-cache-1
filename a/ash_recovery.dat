5000|$|Fly ash, {{also known}} as flue ash, {{is one of the}} {{residues}} generated following the combustion of coal and lignite. In the past it was simply released into the atmosphere through the smoke stack but pollution control requirements have put an end to that practice. It is now captured by electrostatic precipitators and stored at the point of generation, placed in landfills or recycled - where it will typically replace Portland Cement in concrete production. Typical fly <b>ash</b> <b>recovery</b> rates, for Saskatchewan lignite-fired power stations, are 31 kilograms per megawatt hour. Fly ash, depending on its use, can attract a range of prices. The best arises from concrete-quality ash which fetches $22-$49 per tonne.|$|E

40|$|In {{this study}} the {{fundamental}} science underpinning {{the interaction of}} saline water and clay minerals was studied under flotation contexts to address important problems confronting the coal industry.

Equipped {{with a range of}} techniques including froth stability measurements, modelling true flotation, settling tests and Cryo-SEM analyses, it was found that froth stability was higher in the flotation with a higher concentration of clay minerals in both de-ionised water and saline water, corresponding to increased combustible matter recovery and <b>ash</b> <b>recovery.</b> A synergistic interaction was evident between saline water and clay minerals in stabilising the froth and recovering combustible matter by true flotation.

40|$|International audienceAgromining is the {{recovery}} of valuable heavy metals from soils with high metal concentrations, using hyperaccumulator plants, to produce value added products. It allows the exploitation of low-grade ores for which conventional mining techniques are too expensive and detrimental to the environment. It is also a means {{for the restoration of}} closed mines and heavy metal contaminated soils. On lands of low fertility and high concentration in metals, e. g. serpentine soils in the Balkans, it can provide income sources for the local farmers and improve soil fertility and resistance to erosion. We presented here the Life Cycle Assessment of an agromining supply chain. This chain included i) {{the recovery}} of nickel from serpentine soils in the Balkans with cropped hyperaccumulator Alyssum murale, and ii) the production of ammonium nickel sulfate hexahydrate (ANSH) from the resulting ashes using hydrometallurgical processes. Results showed that if not controlled by anti-erosion practices, soil loss at farm scale is responsible for significant impacts, especially on human and environmental health, due to the high heavy metal content of soil particles. However, agromining has a similar impact as normal agricultural practices implemented on the territory. It may be used as cover crop instead of leaving bare soils. Its impact would therefore be beneficial. Heat recovery from biomass combustion avoids significant impact, depending on the energy source it may replace. Proper combustion fume filtration and fly <b>ash</b> <b>recovery</b> reduce risks on human health and maximize metal recovery. Byproducts derived from the process may return to the field to compensate nutrient uptake by crops and improve soil fertility. In conclusion, LCA demonstrated that the whole agromining chain offers the opportunity to promote new agricultural practices and preserve valuable resources. Improvements of the industrial processes are however necessary to increase Ni recovery, purity and added value of final products...|$|E
40|$|Incineration of {{municipal}} solid waste is a commonly used management method {{to take care of}} our waste. However, the residues produced are a problem. They often contain large amounts of potentially toxic metal compounds and soluble salts, which can cause harm to the environment and human health if released from the ash. These ashes are therefore usually classified as hazardous materials and are deposited in specialized landfills. However, as society strives towards more sustainable material cycles, a larger fraction of the materials today classified as waste will, in the near future, be recycled. Since the ashes produced from waste incineration contain significant amounts of metals, they represent a possible source of these metals. Recovery of metals from waste combustion residues would thus give an opportunity to turn a waste into a valuable resource. This thesis focuses on the leaching and recovery of minor metals, such as Cu and Zn, and proposes a recovery procedure for Cu. The leaching of metal compounds from the ash is a very important step in the recovery process and several factors, such as leaching time, pH, leaching agent used and the liquid-to-solid ratio (L/S), affect the leaching properties. In some cases more or less all Cu was leached from the <b>ash.</b> <b>Recovery</b> of metals from ash leachates can be done using solvent extraction, and the results obtained showed that about 90 % of the Cu in the leachates could be selectively recovered. The ash matrix itself is highly affected by leaching, which generally increases the specific surface area and changes the particle size distribution. In landfill leaching tests the release of many ions from pre-leached ash was lower than that measured for the original ash, indicating a possibility to utilize the resulting ash as well...|$|E
40|$|University of Minnesota M. S. thesis. September 2010. Major: Mechanical engineering. 1 {{computer}} file (PDF); viii, 86 p., appendices A-C. Diesel ash emissions are the non-combustible portion of diesel particulate matter and are mainly derived from metallic lube oil additives such as Ca, Mg, and Zn {{as well as}} engine wear metals including Fe. Diesel particulate filters (DPF) are used to filter engine particle emissions and are routinely regenerated, oxidizing the material in the filter. After filter regeneration, metallic ash remains. Over time, this ash can build up in the filter, increasing the filter pressure drop and eventually plugging the filter. Ash emissions {{can also be used}} to calculate engine lube oil consumption. A high temperature oxidation method (HTOM) has been developed to measure ash emissions in real-time. The HTOM uses a tube oven to oxidize the combustible fraction of an engine exhaust sample. The remaining particles are then measured with real-time and near real-time particle sampling techniques. The HTOM system improvements are discussed along with validation testing and further recommendations regarding improvements in the apparatus and procedure. Atomized lube oil was used as a test aerosol. Special lube oil blends were formulated to determine measurement sensitivity to specific ash constituents. Ca and Mg were readily detectable by the HTOM. However, the HTOM was not very sensitive to Zn based additives. Chemical equilibrium models show that Ca and Mg formed stable oxides at oven temperatures while Zn went to a gaseous phase. Repeatability in lube oil spray ash measurements was better than 10 %. Engine exhaust repeats did not show as good repeatability. However engine exhaust is a much less stable and repeatable aerosol. Steady-state engine ash emissions were sampled from two different Diesel engines (1. 9 L VW and Cummins APU) at different speeds and loads. Lube oil doped fuel was also used in the engine tests to artificially increase oil consumption and ash emissions. The engine lube oil consumption was predicted from known lube oil ash concentrations and measured ash emissions. The non-doped fuel tests yielded lower than expected lube oil consumption estimates while the doped tests showed an <b>ash</b> <b>recovery</b> of 31 %. Transient ash measurements were demonstrated. Ash and soot measurements were made downstream a loading DPF. The downstream soot particle surface area concentrations tracked better with the ash than soot volume concentrations. Transient engine speed and loads were also measured by the HTOM. Ash diameter concentrations were measured in real-time showing definite spikes of ash emissions at transient load steps...|$|E

But {{when it comes}} to cleaning of fine coals such as mine dust, slack coal, washing rejects and slurries, froth flotation method of coal cleaning has better efficiency and handling. In this method of wet cleaning, froth is made in a flotation cell by bubbling air through water in presence of frothing agents; on addition, pure and light coal adhere to air bubble while the dirtier part sinks to bottom of the cell. Thus clean coal is recovered from the collected froth amount. Density and wettability can be termed as the two bases of separation which are the inherent properties of the coal.

It offers the prospect of long-term carbon sequestration and soil conditioning with agronomic benefits, {{often referred to as}} the ‘biochar effect‘. These multiple direct or indirect changes in the soil plant interface have also been associated with the control of plant diseases by influencing the host’s systemic induced resistance. The biological impact of biochar on the phytopathology of a major cereal grain has not yet been investigated. The most damaging foliar disease of barley in the UK is Rhynchosporium leaf blotch caused by the hemibiotrophic fungal pathogen Rhynchosporium commune. The aim of this project was to evaluate biochar performance and effectiveness as a disease control agent in the barley – R. commune – pathosystem, and attempted to identify underlying mechanisms by which biochar may function in the interaction between barley and the causal pathogen. Therefore, a unique set of nine slow pyrolysis biochars were established along a 350 to 800 °C pyrolysis temperature gradient, with eight of these made from pelleted softwoods and a single one made from Miscanthus straw. A comprehensive biochar quality assessment was undertaken and established that the biochars differed in their chemical composition, which largely depended on production parameters, predominantly temperature (P < 0. 05).

Small scale fixed bed downdraft gasifier installations (150 kWe- 1 MWe) {{can be employed}} for on-site conversion of biomass to electricity and heat. To assess the fate of heavy metals, batch gasification operations were run in a small scale fixed bed downdraft gasifier (100 kW thermal power). The gasification of I kg of wood resulted {{in the production of}} 40 g of ashes, 1. 2 kWh of electricity and 9 MJ of heat. Per kg dry mass of willow wood, 31 g bottom ashes, 7 g cyclone ashes,. 2 g filter ashes, and 18 g DM of gasifier bed ashes were produced. Cd, Zn and Pb were enriched by a factor 7 - 100 in the fly ashes compared to the bottom <b>ashes.</b> Low mass <b>recoveries</b> (30 - 40 %) were found for Cd, Cr, Ni and Pb. This was mainly attributed to measurement uncertainties. 60 % and more of recovered Cd, Pb and Zn were present in the finer filter and cyclone ashes, while Cr, Cu and Ni were mainly found in the bottom ashes {{and to a lesser extent}} the bed ashes. The scrubber placed after the hot cyclone has all essential role in intercepting the more volatile heavy metals before combustion of the gas. The bottom ashes constituted the largest fraction and ideally should be recycled if limits for metal contents are met. Only Cd and Zn exceeded Flemish threshold values for use of this fraction as a fertilizer, albeit by a small margin. This leaves perspectives for future research to optimise process parameters towards the production of bottom ashes that can be recycled. (C) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|Portugal {{is one of}} {{the largest}} {{consumers}} of fishery products in Europe. This consumption involves a large amount of discarded raw material, such as rejected fish in selling auctions and the generation of by-products in industrial production processes. The by-products in the canning industry alone reach 40 % of the raw material, while the frozen fish industries may reach 10 - 50 % of the raw material (INE, 2013). Fish protein hydrolysates (FPH) are one of the most promising technologies for the recovery of these by-products (Kristinsson e Rasco, 2000). The present study aims to investigate the effect of different enzymes (0. 5 % Alcalase and 0. 5 % Neutrase®) and hydrolysis time (0, 60 and 120 minutes) in the characteristics of FPH obtained from mackerel canning by-products. The hydrolysates were characterized determining the nitrogen recovery, the degree of hydrolysis (DH), the fat recovery, the DPPH free radical scavenging activity, moisture and <b>ash</b> content. Nitrogen <b>recovery</b> was significantly higher in FPH produced with Alcalase (17. 35 %) than in FPH produced with Neutrase® (3. 58 %). FPH produced using Neutrase® presented a higher DH, suggesting that this enzyme had a preference for soluble protein, whereas Alcalase will preferentially hydrolyze insoluble protein contained in the by-products. The FPH produced with 0. 5 % of Alcalase® and 120 minutes showed the higher DPPH free radical scavenging activity (35. 85 ± 1. 1 %). It was observed that after 90 minutes of hydrolysis, DPPH free radical scavenging activity increased in almost all mackerel hydrolysates by 5. 24 %. The results suggest that FPH may add value to currently discarded products and, furthermore, may enable the development of new functional products. The FPH may allow the transformation of previously low commercial value by-products into a source of profit. Instituto Nacional de Estatística (INE), I. P.

40|$|The {{primary goal}} of this project was the {{engineering}} development of two advanced physical fine coal cleaning processes, column flotation and selective agglomeration, for premium fuel applications. The project scope included laboratory research and bench-scale testing of both processes on six coals to optimize the processes, followed by the design, construction, and operation of a 2 t/hr process development unit (PDU). The project began in October, 1992, and is scheduled for completion by September 1997. This report summarizes the findings of all the selective agglomeration (SA) test work performed with emphasis {{on the results of}} the PDU SA Module testing. Two light hydrocarbons, heptane and pentane, were tested as agglomerants in the laboratory research program which investigated two reactor design concepts: a conventional two-stage agglomeration circuit and a unitized reactor that combined the high- and low-shear operations in one vessel. The results were used to design and build a 25 lb/hr bench-scale unit with two-stage agglomeration. The unit also included a steam stripping and condensation circuit for recovery and recycle of heptane. It was tested on six coals to determine the optimum grind and other process conditions that resulted in the recovery of about 99 % of the energy while producing low ash (1 - 2 lb/MBtu) products. The fineness of the grind was the most important variable with the D 80 (80 % passing size) varying in the 12 to 68 micron range. All the clean coals could be formulated into coal-water-slurry-fuels with acceptable properties. The bench-scale results were used for the conceptual and detailed design of the PDU SA Module which was integrated with the existing grinding and dewatering circuits. The PDU was operated for about 9 months. During the first three months, the shakedown testing was performed to fine tune the operation and control of various equipment. This was followed by parametric testing, optimization/confirmatory testing, and finally a 72 -hour round the clock production run {{for each of the three}} project coals (Hiawatha, Taggart, and Indiana VII). The parametric testing results confirmed that the Taggart coal ground to a D 80 of 30 microns could be cleaned to 1 lb ash/MBtu, whereas the Hiawatha and Indiana Vil coals had to be ground to D 80 s of 40 and 20 microns, respectively, to be cleaned to 2 lb ash/MBtu. The percent solids, residence time, shear intensity (impeller tip speed and energy input per unit volume), and heptane dosage were the main variables that affected successful operation (phase inversion or microagglomerate formation in the high-shear reactor and their growth to 2 - 3 mm in size during low shear). Downward inclination of the vibrating screen and adequate spray water helped produce the low <b>ash</b> products. Btu <b>recoveries</b> were consistently greater than 98 %. Two-stage steam stripping achieved about 99 % heptane recovery for recycle to the process. Residual hydrocarbon concentrations were in the 3000 to 5000 ppm range on a dry solids basis...|$|R
40|$|Like world Pakistan {{is facing}} two major threats i. e. {{environment}} and energy. Rapid industrialization and urbanization {{have resulted in}} elevated emission of toxic heavy metals entering the biosphere. Activities such as mining and agriculture have polluted extensive areas throughout the world. The release of heavy metals in biologically available forms by human activities may damage or alter both natural and man-made ecosystems. Heavy metal ions such as Pb 2 +, Cr 6 +, Cd 2 + Cu 2 +, Zn+ 2 and Ni+ 2, are essential micronutrients for plantâ€™s and animalâ€™s metabolism but when present in excess, can become extremely toxic. Among the renewable energy technologies, solar energy, wind energy, biofuels and biomass conversion occupy the central stage. The current study belongs to biomass conversion to biofuels. It was focused on metal phytoremediation and biofuel production from water hyacinth by using Nanobiotechnology. Soil experiments show the phytoremoval of Pb 2 +, Cr 6 +, Cd 2 + Cu 2 +, Zn+ 2 + and Ni 2 + in Ã¬g/g of plantâ€™s dry weight. Increase or decrease in pH and fresh weight is also discussed. Lead, chromium, cadmium, copper, zinc and nickel showed phytoremoval of 27. 91, 38. 67, 1. 915, 3. 38, 13. 11 and 24. 23 Ã¬g/g of plantâ€™s dry weight respectively. Similarly phytoremoval of lead, chromium, cadmium, copper, zinc and nickel in kg/ha is 1582. 45, 1053. 38, 2852. 75, 232. 99, 1521. 08 and 3449. 76 respectively. Hoaglandâ€™s hydroponic experiments show the phytoremoval of Pb 2 +, Cr 6 +, Cd 2 + Cu 2 +, Zn+ 2 + and Ni 2 + in Ã¬g/g of plantâ€™s dry weight. Increase or decrease in pH and fresh weight is also discussed. Lead, chromium, cadmium, copper, zinc and nickel showed phytoremoval 19. 132, 2. 369, 8. 888, 4. 085, 0. 845 and 1. 954 Ã¬g/g of plantâ€™s dry weight. Adsorption and desorption experiments show phytoremoval (adsorption) of Pb 2 +, Cr 6 +, Cd 2 + Cu 2 +, Zn+ 2 + and Ni 2 + in Ã¬g/g of plantâ€™s <b>ash.</b> While desorption (<b>recovery</b> for reuse) of lead, chromium, cadmium, copper, zinc and nickel in Ã¬g/g of plantâ€™s ash. Adsorption capacity is 29. 83, 24, 28. 41, 29. 83, 29. 94 and 29. 79 Ã¬g/g of plantâ€™s ash respectively. The biosorptive capacity is highest with pH > 8. 00. The desorption capacity of lead, chromium, cadmium, copper, zinc and nickel is 18. 10, 9. 99, 27. 54, 21. 09, 11. 99, 3. 71 Ã¬g/g of plantâ€™s ash respectively. Bioanalytical experiments were performed to assess the metallic concentrations of Taxilian water hyacinth. Some selected microbes from hyacinthâ€™s roots were isolated,identified by biochemical tests and purified by microbiological experiments. Our results show that Thiobacillus thiooxidans, Thiobacillus ferrooxidans, Azotobacter and A. niger {{are present in the}} roots of water hyacinth. Thiobacillus thiooxidans, Thiobacillus ferrooxidans and A. niger are commonly well known for metalâ€™s bioremediation. Their presence in the roots of water hyacinth show that these microbes may have some role in metalâ€™s phytoremediation by hyacinth. Azotobacter is generally nitrogen fixing bacteria its presence may shows relationship with nitrogenâ€™s phytoremoval by hyacinth. The presence of Mn, Mo, Fe, Cr and some other metals in nitrogenase enzymes of Azotobacter, is already documented. Therefore Azotobacterâ€™s presence may also be responsible for phytoremoval of these metals by water hyacinth. Three different studies were performed for the nanobiotechnological conversion of water hyacinth (Eichhornia crassipes) plant into biofuel. In the first study water hyacinth was saccharified with diluted sulfuric acid (1 % v/v at 110 oC for one hour) and fermented by yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae). The results show the formation of 55. 20 % ethanol and 41. 66 % acetic acid. In another experiment water hyacinth was gasified by using Ni and Co nano catalysts at 50 - 400 ÂºC and atmospheric pressure. In catalytic gasification methane (2. 41 - 6. 67 %), ethene (19. 74 - 45. 52 %), propyne (21. 04 - 45. 52 %), methanol (1. 43 - 24. 67 %), and propane/acetaldehyde (0. 33 - 26. 09 %) products are obtained. In third study anatase form of titanium dioxide photocatalyst was used. The reaction was performed at room temperature which gives good percentage of methane (53. 19 %), methanol (37. 23 %) and ethanol (9. 57 %). This study reports an interesting finding that metal contaminated water hyacinth could be used for not only the production of biofuel but also hydrocarbons Present study gives solution of two major problems of the world i. e. environmental pollution and fuel. It also shows comparison of three different phytoremediation technologies and use of water hyacinth as a metal hyper accumulator and a source of hydrocarbon gases and bioethanol. These technologies are cheap and may be developed further for commercial us...|$|R
