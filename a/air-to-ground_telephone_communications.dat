The merits of the various criteria used in evaluating and comparing FDMA and CDMA systems are discussed. A frequency-hopped MFSK system is shown to possess a spectral efficiency in the range of 25 - 35 %. This compares with 25 % for the currently implemented FDMA system and below 10 % for a DPSK system. The direct sequence form of spread spectrum is shown to be unacceptable for mobile <b>telephone</b> <b>communications...</b>|$|R

After working as a Wall Street runner in the 1920s and as a Hollywood screenwriter in the 1930s, Wohlstetter returned to Wall Street in the 1940s and became a financier. In 1960 he made what he would later call a bad investment in an Alaskan oil company that would become the impetus for ConTel. To help turn that investment around, Wohlstetter raised $1.5 million to form a holding company, <b>Telephone</b> <b>Communications</b> Corporation. Some 30 years later, Wohlstetter's $1.5 million investment had grown into a company that had acquired and consolidated more than 750 smaller companies with total corporate assets hovering around $6 billion.|$|R
