5|$|From its {{founding}} in the 9th century until the Industrial Revolution, Oldham {{is believed to have}} been little more than <b>a</b> <b>scattering</b> <b>of</b> small and insignificant settlements spread across the moorland and dirt tracks that linked Manchester to York. Although not mentioned in the Domesday Book, Oldham does appear in legal documents from the Middle Ages, invariably recorded as territory under the control of minor ruling families and barons. In the 13th century, Oldham was documented as a manor held from the Crown by a family surnamed Oldham, whose seat was at Werneth Hall.|$|E

5|$|Anticipating {{that people}} {{would come to the}} area to indulge in the newly fashionable pastime of sea-bathing, an {{activity}} with perceived health benefits, Tregonwell built a series of villas on his land between 1816 and 1822, which he hoped to let out. The common belief that pine-scented air was good for lung conditions, and in particular tuberculosis, prompted Tregonwell and Tapps to plant hundreds of pine trees. These early attempts to promote the town as a health resort meant that by the time Tregonwell had died in 1832, Bournemouth had grown into a small community with <b>a</b> <b>scattering</b> <b>of</b> houses, villas and cottages. The town would ultimately grow up around the scattered pines and tree-lined walk to the beach, later to become known as the Invalids' Walk.|$|E
5|$|The Mahavira's teachings were {{gradually}} lost after around 300BC, {{according to}} the Jain tradition, when a severe famine in the Magadha region of ancient India caused <b>a</b> <b>scattering</b> <b>of</b> the Jain monks. Thereafter, attempts were made by Jain monks to gather again, co-recite the canon, and re-establish it in its entirety. These efforts identified differences between recitations of the Mahavira's teachings, and {{an attempt was made}} in the 5thcentury AD to reconcile the differences. However, the reconciliation efforts failed, with Svetambara and Digambara Jain traditions continuing with their own incomplete, somewhat different versions of the Mahavira's teachings. In the early centuries of the common era, Jain texts containing Mahavira's teachings were written down in palm leaf manuscripts.|$|E

40|$|The varying global {{distribution}} of stars, or specifically, their concentration Cr_e, within elliptical galaxies and spiral galaxy bulges is intimately {{related to the}} mass of their central supermassive black holes (Mbh), such that log (Mbh/Msun) = 6. 81 (± 0. 95) Cr_e + 5. 03 ± 0. 41. This correlation has a Spearman correlation coefficient rs= 0. 91, and <b>a</b> <b>scatter</b> <b>of</b> only 0. 31 dex in log Mbh. Removing one well understood outlying data point and using only those galaxies whose supermassive black hole's radius of influence has been resolved (reducing the sample size from 21 to 13) results in <b>a</b> <b>scatter</b> <b>of</b> only 0. 19 dex...|$|R

5000|$|The {{coefficient}} of (1 - cosθ) {{is known as}} the Compton wavelength, but is in fact a proportionality constant for the wavelength shift.
