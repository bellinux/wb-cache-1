5|$|Another {{public outcry}} arose when the {{government}}, seeking {{the support of}} ethnic minorities, allowed the opening of over 80 Polish schools in Lithuania. At the time, the Polish government was closing Lithuanian schools in the fiercely contested Vilnius Region. The coalition government directly confronted the Christian Democrats when it proposed a 1927 budget that reduced salaries to the clergy <b>and</b> <b>subsidies</b> to Catholic schools. Further controversies were created when the government's military reform program was revealed as a careless downsizing. Some 200 conservative military officers were fired.

40|$|Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) {{is crucial}} to {{developing}} nations because of the benefit the host country receives {{in the form of}} productivity increases and technology transfers which fuel sustained growth in these economies. My thesis examines the factors that attract FDI to developing countries and assess the relative importance of the quality of institutions and infrastructure as compared to tax <b>and</b> <b>subsidy</b> incentives in attracting incoming FDI. I analyze panel data on 97 developing countries from 1975 to 2008 using both OLS and fixed effects regressions with FDI inflows as the dependent variable. Using standard controls I am able to isolate the effect that institutions, infrastructure, <b>and</b> tax <b>and</b> <b>subsidy</b> incentives have on the inflow of FDI. The evidence suggests low tax rates <b>and</b> <b>subsidy</b> incentives have a significant and positive impact on FDI inflows...|$|R

5|$|From 1619 to 1640, George William was elector of Brandenburg and duke of Prussia. He strove, but proved {{unable to}} break the {{dominance}} of the Electorate of Saxony in the Upper Saxon Circle. The Brandenburg-Saxon antagonism rendered the defense of the circle ineffective, and it was subsequently overrun by Albrecht von Wallenstein during the Thirty Years' War. While George William had claimed neutrality before, the presence of Wallenstein's army forced him to join the Catholic-Imperial camp in the Treaty of Königsberg (1627) and accept garrisons. When the Swedish Empire entered the war and advanced into Brandenburg, George William again claimed neutrality, yet Gustavus Adolphus of Sweden compelled George William to join Sweden as an ally by occupying substantial territory in Brandenburg-Prussia and concentrating an army before the town walls of Berlin. George William did not conclude an alliance, but granted Sweden transit rights, two fortresses <b>and</b> <b>subsidies.</b> Consequently, Roman Catholic armies repeatedly ravaged Brandenburg and other Hohenzollern lands.|$|E

5|$|In December 1791, Hamilton {{published}} the Report on Manufactures, which recommended numerous policies {{designed to protect}} U.S. merchants and industries {{in order to increase}} national wealth, induce artisans to immigrate, cause machinery to be invented, and employ women and children. Hamilton called for the federally-supervised infrastructure projects, the establishment of state-owned munitions factories <b>and</b> <b>subsidies</b> for privately owned factories, and the imposition of a protective tariff. Though Congress had adopted much of Hamilton's earlier proposals, his manufacturing proposals fell flat, even in the more-industrialized North, as merchant-shipowners had a stake in free trade. There were also questions raised about the constitutionality of these proposals, and opponents such as Jefferson feared that Hamilton's expansive interpretation of the Taxing and Spending Clause would grant Congress the power to legislate on any subject.|$|E
5|$|India ranks first {{worldwide}} in farm output. Agriculture and allied sectors like forestry, logging and fishing accounted for 18.6% of the GDP in 2005, employed 60% {{of the total}} workforce and despite a steady decline of its share in the GDP, is still the largest economic sector and {{plays a significant role}} in the overall socio-economic development of India. Yields per unit area of all crops have grown since 1950, due to the special emphasis placed on agriculture in the five-year plans and steady improvements in irrigation, technology, application of modern agricultural practices and provision of agricultural credit <b>and</b> <b>subsidies</b> since the green revolution.|$|E

On the condition that the wife would leave the workforce, a loan of up to 1,000 Reichsmarks could be accessed by young couples of Aryan descent who intended to marry and the amount that had to be repaid was reduced by 25 percent for each child born. The caveat that the woman had to remain unemployed was dropped by 1937 due to a shortage of skilled labourers.|$|E

5|$|Nuclear {{power and}} fossil fuels are subsidized by many governments, and wind power {{and other forms}} of {{renewable}} energy are also often subsidized. For example, a 2009 study by the Environmental Law Institute assessed the size and structure of U.S. energy subsidies over the 2002–2008 period. The study estimated that subsidies to fossil-fuel based sources amounted to approximately $72 billion over this period <b>and</b> <b>subsidies</b> to renewable fuel sources totalled $29 billion. In the United States, the federal government has paid US$74billion for energy subsidies to support R for nuclear power ($50 billion) and fossil fuels ($24 billion) from 1973 to 2003. During this same time frame, renewable energy technologies and energy efficiency received a total of US$26billion. It has been suggested that a subsidy shift would help {{to level the playing field}} and support growing energy sectors, namely solar power, wind power, and biofuels. History shows that no energy sector was developed without subsidies.|$|E
5|$|Polish king John III Sobieski {{planned to}} restore Polish {{suzerainty}} over the Duchy of Prussia, {{and for this}} purpose concluded an alliance with France on 11 June 1675. France promised assistance <b>and</b> <b>subsidies,</b> while Sobieski in turn allowed French recruitment in Poland-Lithuania and promised to aid Hungarian rebel forces who were to distract the Habsburgs from their war against France. For this plan to work out, Poland-Lithuania had to first conclude her war against the Ottoman Empire, which French diplomacy despite great efforts failed to achieve. Furthermore, Sobieski was opposed by the Papacy, by Polish gentry who saw the Ottomans as the greater threat, and by Polish magnates bribed by Berlin and Vienna. Inner-Polish Catholic opposition to an intervention on the Protestant Hungarian rebels' side added to the resentments. Thus, while Treaty of Żurawno ended the Polish-Ottoman war in 1676, Sobieski sided with the emperor instead, and the plan for a Prussian campaign was dropped.|$|E

40|$|We {{investigate}} {{an automobile}} supply chain where a manufacturer and a retailer serve heterogeneous consumers with electric vehicles (EVs) under a government’s price-discount incentive scheme that involves a price discount rate <b>and</b> a <b>subsidy</b> ceiling.

However, the discount rate is more effective for the manufacturer with a lower unit production cost. Moreover, the expected sales are increasing in the discount rate but may be decreasing in the subsidy ceiling. Analytic results indicate that an effective incentive scheme should include both a discount rate <b>and</b> a <b>subsidy</b> ceiling. We also derive the necessary condition for the most effective discount rate <b>and</b> <b>subsidy</b> ceiling that maximize the expected sales of EVs, and obtain a unique discount rate <b>and</b> <b>subsidy</b> ceiling that most effectively improve the manufacturer’s incentive for EV production...|$|R
