5|$|<b>A</b> <b>small</b> <b>minority</b> of the {{population}} practise ancient Pagan religions. Neopaganism in the United Kingdom is primarily represented by Wicca and Witchcraft religions, Druidry, and Heathenry. According to the 2011 UK Census, there are roughly 53,172 people who identify as Pagan in England, and 3,448 in Wales, including 11,026 Wiccans in England and 740 in Wales.|$|E
5|$|The year 1916 marked {{four centuries}} since Palestine had {{become part of}} the Ottoman Empire, also known as the Turkish Empire. For most of this period, the Jewish {{population}} represented <b>a</b> <b>small</b> <b>minority,</b> approximately 3% of the total, with Muslims representing the largest segment of the population, and Christians the second.|$|E
5|$|At {{the start}} of the war, the {{population}} of Belgium was overwhelmingly Catholic. Jews made up the largest non-Christian population in the country, numbering between 70–75,000 out of a population of 8 million. Most lived in large towns and cities in Belgium, such as Antwerp and Brussels. The vast majority were recent immigrants to Belgium fleeing persecution in Germany and Eastern Europe and, as a result, only <b>a</b> <b>small</b> <b>minority</b> actually possessed Belgian citizenship.|$|E

5|$|The Germans invaded Hungary on Sunday, 19 March 1944, meeting no resistance. Following Hungary's {{annexation}} in 1941 {{of parts}} of Romania, Yugoslavia and Czechoslovakia, there were 725,000 Jews in the country, as well as over 60,000 Jewish converts to Christianity and others the Nazis counted as Jews, according to Yehuda Bauer. Most were liberal Jews and fully assimilated, nearly 30 percent were Orthodox, and <b>a</b> <b>small</b> <b>minority</b> were Zionists.|$|E
5|$|The Sogdian {{religious}} texts {{found in}} China and {{dating to the}} Northern Dynasties, Sui, and Tang are mostly Buddhist (translated from Chinese sources), Manichaean and Nestorian Christian, with only <b>a</b> <b>small</b> <b>minority</b> of Zoroastrian texts. But tombs of Sogdian merchants in China dated to {{the last third of}} the 6th century show predominantly Zoroastrian motifs or Zoroastrian-Manichaean syncretism, while archaeological remains from Sogdiana appear fairly Iranian and conservatively Zoroastrian.|$|E
5|$|The {{majority}} of Muslims {{in the country}} are adherents of a moderate branch of mystical Islam (Sufism). Its most common expression is the Tijaniyah, an order followed by the 35% of Chadian Muslims which incorporates some local African religious elements. <b>A</b> <b>small</b> <b>minority</b> of the country's Muslims hold more fundamentalist practices, which, in some cases, may be associated with Saudi-oriented Salafi movements.|$|E

5|$|Winnipeg {{developed}} rapidly {{after the}} coming of the Canadian Pacific Railway in 1881. The railway divided the North End, which housed mainly Eastern Europeans, from the richer Anglo-Saxon southern part of the city. It also contributed to a demographic shift beginning shortly after Confederation that saw the francophone population decrease from a majority to <b>a</b> <b>small</b> <b>minority</b> group. This shift resulted in Premier Thomas Greenway controversially ending legislative bilingualism and removing funding for French Catholic Schools in 1890.|$|E
5|$|About 1% of school-age {{children}} and adolescents have Tourette's. It was once considered a rare and bizarre syndrome, most often associated with coprolalia (the utterance of obscene words or socially inappropriate and derogatory remarks), but this symptom is present in only <b>a</b> <b>small</b> <b>minority</b> of people with Tourette's. The condition was named by Jean-Martin Charcot (1825–1893) {{on behalf of his}} resident, Georges Albert Édouard Brutus Gilles de la Tourette (1857–1904), a French physician and neurologist, who published an account of nine patients with Tourette's in 1885.|$|E
5|$|Between 1950 and 1988, around 4 million East Germans {{migrated}} to the West; 3.454million left between 1950 {{and the construction of}} the Berlin Wall in 1961. After the border was fortified and the Berlin Wall constructed, the number of illegal crossings fell dramatically and continued to fall as the defences were improved over the subsequent decades. However, escapees were never more than <b>a</b> <b>small</b> <b>minority</b> {{of the total number of}} emigrants from East Germany. During the 1980s, only about 1% of those who left East Germany did so by escaping across the border. Far more people left the country after being granted official permits, by fleeing through third countries or by being ransomed by the West German government.|$|E

5|$|During the Seven Years' War (in America, {{known as}} the French and Indian War), British forces seized Canada from the French, but the francophone {{population}} remained politically isolated from the southern colonies. Excluding the Native Americans, who were being conquered and displaced, the 13 British colonies had a population of over 2.1 million in 1770, about one-third that of Britain. Despite continuing new arrivals, the {{rate of natural increase}} was such that by the 1770s only <b>a</b> <b>small</b> <b>minority</b> of Americans had been born overseas. The colonies' distance from Britain had allowed the development of self-government, but their success motivated monarchs to periodically seek to reassert royal authority.|$|E
5|$|Even {{though most}} ethnic groups prefer to {{communicate}} in their own languages, English as the official language is widely used for education, business transactions and for official purposes. English as a first language is used only by <b>a</b> <b>small</b> <b>minority</b> of the country's urban elite, {{and it is not}} spoken at all in some rural areas. Hausa is the most widely spoken of the 3 main languages spoken in Nigeria itself (Igbo, Hausa and Yoruba) but unlike the Yorubas and Igbos, the Hausas tend not to travel far outside Nigeria itself.|$|E
5|$|In modern times, the Welsh {{roots of}} the college {{come to the fore}} most {{prominently}} on Saint David's Day. The feast is marked by a choral Evensong in the chapel, decorated for the occasion with daffodils. The service, including music, is conducted entirely in Welsh (despite only <b>a</b> <b>small</b> <b>minority</b> of the choir usually being native speakers of the language). It is generally well attended by members of the Welsh community in Oxford. The college's annual St. David's Day Dinner traditionally culminates with the serving of Sir Watkin Williams-Wynn's Pudding. The name recalls the Welsh politician and prominent Jacobite who attended the college early in the 18th century.|$|E

5|$|In the tournaments between 1934 and 1978, 16 teams {{competed in}} each tournament, except in 1938, when Austria was absorbed into Germany after qualifying, leaving the tournament with 15 teams, and in 1950, when India, Scotland, and Turkey withdrew, leaving the tournament with 13 teams. Most of the {{participating}} nations were from Europe and South America, with <b>a</b> <b>small</b> <b>minority</b> from North America, Africa, Asia, and Oceania. These teams were usually defeated easily by the European and South American teams. Until 1982, the only teams from outside Europe and South America to advance {{out of the first}} round were: USA, semi-finalists in 1930; Cuba, quarter-finalists in 1938; North Korea, quarter-finalists in 1966; and Mexico, quarter-finalists in 1970.|$|E
5|$|Most amateurs work at visible wavelengths, but <b>a</b> <b>small</b> <b>minority</b> {{experiment}} with wavelengths outside the visible spectrum. This includes {{the use of}} infrared filters on conventional telescopes, and also the use of radio telescopes. The pioneer of amateur radio astronomy was Karl Jansky, who started observing the sky at radio wavelengths in the 1930s. A number of amateur astronomers use either homemade telescopes or use radio telescopes which were originally built for astronomy research but which are now available to amateurs (e.g. the One-Mile Telescope).|$|E
5|$|Most millipedes are slow-moving detritivores, eating {{decaying}} {{leaves and}} other dead plant matter. Some eat fungi or suck plant fluids, and <b>a</b> <b>small</b> <b>minority</b> are predatory. Millipedes are generally harmless to humans, although some can become household or garden pests, especially in greenhouses {{where they can}} cause severe damage to emergent seedlings. Most millipedes defend themselves {{with a variety of}} chemicals secreted from pores along the body, although the tiny bristle millipedes are covered with tufts of detachable bristles. Reproduction in most species is carried out by modified male legs called gonopods, which transfer packets of sperm to females.|$|E
5000|$|The Sikh Mochi are a {{community}} found {{mainly in the}} Punjab state of India, in the districts of Patiala, Ludhiana and Nabha. However, {{the majority of the}} Mochis in Punjab remain Hindu, with only <b>a</b> <b>smaller</b> <b>minority</b> converting Sikhism. Almost all Sikh Mochi are members of the Ravidasi sect. Most are involved in their traditional occupation of shoemaking.|$|R
50|$|The {{majority}} of Nova Scotians were Methodist {{or members of}} the Countess of Huntingdon's Connexion; <b>a</b> <b>smaller</b> <b>minority</b> were Baptist. One half to {{two thirds of the}} Nova Scotians were Methodist; the former Anglican settlers converted to Methodism and the Methodists incorporated Moses Wilkinson's congregation, Boston King's congregation, and Joseph Leonard's Anglican congregation which was openly Methodist.|$|R

5|$|The {{patron saint}} of England is Saint George; his {{symbolic}} cross {{is included in the}} flag of England, {{as well as in the}} Union Flag as part of a combination. There are many other English and associated saints; some of the best-known are: Cuthbert, Edmund, Alban, Wilfrid, Aidan, Edward the Confessor, John Fisher, Thomas More, Petroc, Piran, Margaret Clitherow and Thomas Becket. There are non-Christian religions practised. Jews have a history of <b>a</b> <b>small</b> <b>minority</b> on the island since 1070. They were expelled from England in 1290 following the Edict of Expulsion, only to be allowed back in 1656.|$|E
5|$|Among African slaves, Catholicism was the {{religion}} of the majority. Most slaves came originally from the midwestern and southwestern portions of the African coast. For over four centuries this region had been the subject of Christian mission activities. Some Africans and their descendants, however, held onto elements of polytheistic religious traditions by merging them with Catholicism. This resulted in the creation of syncretic creeds such as Candomblé. Islam was also practiced among <b>a</b> <b>small</b> <b>minority</b> of African slaves, although it was harshly repressed {{and by the end of}} the 19th century had been completely extinguished. By the beginning of the 19th century, the Indians in most of eastern Brazil had been either assimilated or decimated. Some tribes resisted assimilation and either fled farther west, where they were able to maintain their diverse polytheistic beliefs, or were restricted to aldeamentos (reservations), where they eventually converted to Catholicism.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{their legal}} {{privileges}} over that of merchants, {{the work of}} artisans was considered by Han Confucian scholars to be of secondary importance to that of farmers. This is perhaps largely because scholars and officials could not survive without the farmer's product and taxes paid in grain. The government relied on taxed grain to fund its military campaigns and stored surplus grain to mitigate widespread famine during times of poor harvest. Despite the prominence given to farmers, Confucian scholars did accept that artisans performed a vital economic role. This view was only rejected by <b>a</b> <b>small</b> <b>minority</b> of Legalists, who advocated a society of only soldiers and farmers, and certain Daoists who wanted everyone to live in self-sufficient villages and without commercial interests.|$|E
5|$|Native Americans are <b>a</b> <b>smaller</b> <b>minority</b> in the state. Native Americans make up 0.5 {{percent of}} Texas' population, and number over 118,000 individuals. Native Americans of non-Hispanic origin make up 0.3 {{percent of the}} population, and number over 75,000 individuals. Cherokee made up 0.1 percent of the population, and {{numbered}} over 19,400 members. In contrast, only 583 identified as Chippewa.|$|R
