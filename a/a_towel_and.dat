Gordon then blew his nose on the towel. The Cardinals then proceeded to lose the Super Bowl to the Steelers, 27-23.|$|E

For added flavor (from the Maillard reaction), the liver may be seared briefly over a fire of grape vine clippings (sarments) before slow-cooking in a bain-marie; afterwards, it is pressed served cold, in slices.|$|E
25|$|The Young Men's Christian Association (YMCA) {{was set up}} in 1842 with {{a mission}} to provide an {{education}} program and healthy sports to young men. The YMCA was responsible for providing swimming classes to countless numbers of American boys and teenagers. This included swimming in indoor pools. Swimming trunks were not permitted in their pools. In Lincoln, Nebraska in 1958, for example, learners were told just to bring <b>a</b> <b>towel</b> <b>and</b> not to bring trunks. In Sheboygan, Wisconsin in 1954, the Recreation Department reported that 404 youngsters had attended an 11-day swimming course where the boys were unhampered by bathing suits. When the YMCA began to admit females in the early 1960s, the wearing of bathing suits became a requirement.|$|E
50|$|Originally all bathers were {{supplied}} with <b>a</b> <b>towel,</b> soap <b>and</b> (for swimmers) a costume, {{collected from the}} baths attendant's kiosk. <b>Towels</b> <b>and</b> costumes were subsequently washed and dried in the steam laundry room located {{on the first floor}} of the boiler house.|$|R

25|$|Meanwhile, {{several of}} hide's {{friends and colleagues}} stated that they {{believed}} the auto-strangulation {{to have been an}} accident, among them X Japan co-founder Yoshiki and former X bassist Taiji. This notion is supported by the fact that no suicide note was left and Taiji theorizes in his autobiography, that at the night of his death, hide may have been practicing a technique to relieve upper back and neck pains which guitarists can suffer from continuous use of a shoulder strap. The technique involved was practiced by the X Japan members during their touring days and required the use of <b>a</b> <b>towel</b> <b>and</b> a door knob or handle. According to Taiji, hide may have fallen asleep in his intoxicated state, becoming caught and strangling himself.|$|E
25|$|The frontovik usually carried {{all he had}} in {{a simple}} bag. Most of the frontovik had a perevgzochnii paket (wound {{dressing}} packet), a razor, a shovel and would be very lucky to have <b>a</b> <b>towel</b> <b>and</b> toothbrush. Toothpaste, shampoo and soap were extremely rare. Usually sticks with chewed ends were used for brushing teeth. To relieve themselves latrine pits were dug, as portable toilets were rare in the Red Army. Soldiers frequently slept outdoors, even during the winter. Food was usually abysmal and often in short supply, especially in 1941 and 1942. The frontoviks detested the rear service troops who did not face the dangers of combat as krysa (rats). The frontovik lived on a diet of black rye bread; canned meats like fish and tushonka (stewed pork); shchi (cabbage soup) and kasha (porridge).”. Kasha and shchi were so common that a popular slogan in the Red Army was “shchi ee kasha, pisha nasha” (“schchi and kasha, that's our fare.”). Chai (hot sugared tea) was an extremely popular beverage together with beer and vodka. Makhorka, a type of cheap tobacco roiled in handmade cigarettes was the standard cigarette.|$|E

A {{battered}} prostitute appears at Logan’s door and takes Wendy away, citing problems with their pimp, leaving Max heartbroken. Veronica finds a stain of purple makeup on <b>a</b> <b>towel,</b> <b>and</b> she immediately deduces that Wendy conned Max out of $1,000. Veronica blackmails a judge {{in order to secure}} the $1,000 back. Veronica and Logan ask each other personal questions in an attempt to become more intimate, but it fails. At the bus locker at which Veronica instructed the judge to leave the money, she instead finds a note that tells Veronica and Max to get in a limo. In the limo, they find Wendy’s pimp, who is actually a woman. She tells them that she actually did fall in love with Max, but that she needed money for other reasons.|$|E
500|$|As a shopworker, Bondfield was {{expected}} to work between 80 and 100 hours a week for 51 weeks in the year, and might be sent out late at night to check that rival shops had closed before her employer would do so. She began to record her experiences, {{in a series of}} articles and stories that she wrote under the pseudonym [...] "Grace Dare", for the shopworkers' monthly magazine The Shop Assistant. She wrote surreptitiously, at night: [...] "I would light my half-penny dip , hiding its glare by means of <b>a</b> <b>towel</b> <b>and</b> set to work on my monthly article". In 1896 she was recruited by the Women's Industrial Council (WIC) as an undercover agent, working in various shops while secretly recording every aspect of shop life. Her accounts of squalor and exploitation were published in articles under the [...] "Grace Dare" [...] name, in both The Shop Assistant and the Daily Chronicle newspaper, and provided the basis for a WIC report on shopworkers' conditions published in 1898.|$|E

500|$|Harry Clork and Doris Malloy put {{together}} a 34-page treatment which Laemmle approved in April. The pair completed their draft on May 20, 1935. Whale had Dan Totheroh re-write the dialogue and the draft was ready for submission to the PCA on July 15. When Breen reviewed the draft, his objections centered on the excessive alcohol use. [...] "We take this opportunity of pointing out to you, {{in regard to the}} matter of the treatment of drinking in this story, that, generally speaking, it is presented in a light, facetious, acceptable, amusing, and desirable mode of behavior. It is upon this that we feel rejection may be reasonably based." [...] A revised script with the drinking toned down slightly was submitted on July 24, the same day Whale started shooting. Remember Last Night? was budgeted at $385,000. [...] Whale inserted lines that made fun of horror pictures, a genre with which he no longer wished to be associated. Carlotta is shown jumping on a diving board flapping <b>a</b> <b>towel</b> <b>and</b> exclaiming [...] "Look, I'm Dracula's Daughter!" [...] and in another scene she says [...] "I feel like the Bride of Frankenstein!" [...] Shooting wrapped on September 14. Whale was nine days over schedule and $75,000 over budget.|$|E
500|$|At {{a monastery}} in the Vatican, George covertly enters a wafer factory and finds Anna Maria's file in an office. After George is {{discovered}} {{and is being}} escorted outside by Cardinal Gianelli, Father Gregor tells him that Anna Maria used to here, but that she has stolen a manuscript, and he hands over his business card. By showing the card to Mark, {{he is willing to}} help and gives George Anna Maria's package. From Mark, he learns about the Black Cat club. The package contains a DVD with an interview with a man called Maynard, who has managed to make [...] "monatomic gold". Nico leaves to Phoenix to check things out. George gains access to the Black Cat club, where he meets Duane (who he has met before in previous installments). Duane reveals that Spallaci owns the club. Afterwards, George is caught for stealing <b>a</b> <b>towel</b> <b>and</b> tied to a chair. Spallaci interrogates him about Anna Maria, and he overhears the recorded voice of Nico. Shots are being fired, so he thinks Nico has been killed. When he finds a way to escape, he goes for a drink, trying to forget the loss of Nico. The next day, still drunk, he arrives at Anna Maria's apartment, where Nico returns and George faints.|$|E
500|$|Nicola {{sets out}} to seduce Ivan after an {{argument}} with her boyfriend Simon Meredith (Dale Meeks). Wheeler told Allison Maund from Inside Soap that Nicola calls Ivan for [...] "some comfort" [...] and they get drunk and [...] "very cosy"; but Ivan presumes they are just good friends. Ivan {{gets out of the}} shower wearing <b>a</b> <b>towel</b> <b>and</b> is confronted with Nicola [...] "dressed in her sexiest underwear". Ivan tells Nicola to stop because he loves Paul, but Simon's mother Lesley Meredith (Sherrie Hewson) walks in on them and assumes that they are having an affair. Nicola does not correct Lesley and tells her to believe what she likes and then Paul learns of the situation. Wheeler said that Nicola realises she cannot [...] "get out of the lie now" [...] and even tells her father, Rodney Blackstock (Patrick Mower) that she has slept with Ivan. The actress added that [...] "Nicola's just quite pleased with the fact that she's got her own back on Ivan". He confronts her in public and asks her to tell the truth, but she [...] "turns on the waterworks" [...] to get everyone to turn against Ivan. Later Nicola argues with Paul and she tells him that she and Ivan have slept together many times. Wheeler said that Nicola just thinks [...] "Sod it, I'm going to leave them all stewing". Her lies ruin Ivan's relationship with Paul, who believes Nicola's lies.|$|E

2500|$|Against {{the protests}} {{of the three}} women, the {{officers}} simply covered Sinthasomphone with <b>a</b> <b>towel</b> <b>and</b> walked him to Dahmer's apartment where, {{in an effort to}} verify his claim that he and Sinthasomphone were lovers, Dahmer showed the officers the two semi-nude Polaroid pictures he had taken of the youth the previous evening. The officers later reported having noted a strange scent reminiscent of excrement inside the apartment (this odor emanated from the decomposing body of Hughes). Dahmer stated that to investigate this, one officer simply [...] "peeked his head around the bedroom but really didn't take a good look." [...] The officers then left, with a departing remark that Dahmer [...] "take good care" [...] of Sinthasomphone. Had they conducted a background check upon Dahmer, it would have revealed that he was a convicted child molester under probation. Upon the departure of the two police officers from his apartment, Dahmer again injected hydrochloric acid into Sinthasomphone's brain; on this second occasion, the injection proved fatal. The following day, May 28, Dahmer took a day's leave from work to devote himself to the dismemberment of the bodies of Sinthasomphone and Hughes, whose decomposing body had been lying in his bedroom as police brought Sinthasomphone back to his apartment. He retained both victims' skulls.|$|E
2500|$|On one occasion, as Stephen was mopping {{the kitchen}} floor with a cloth, Rose accidentally stepped into the bowl of water he had been using to perform this task. In response, Rose smashed the boy {{over the head with}} the bowl, then {{repeatedly}} kicked him in the head and chest as she shouted: [...] "You did that on purpose, you little swine!" [...] On another occasion, Rose became hysterical at a missing kitchen utensil, then grabbed a knife she had been using to cut a slab of meat, repeatedly inflicting light scour marks to Mae's chest until her rib cage was covered with light knife wounds. All the while, Mae had screamed, [...] "No, Mum! No, Mum!" [...] as Stephen and Heather stood by, helplessly sobbing. Even Fred occasionally became the recipient of Rose's violence. On one occasion in the late 1970s, Rose chased after Fred with a carving knife in her hand, although Fred was able to slam shut the door of the room into which he had run as Rose plunged at him with the knife, resulting in the knife embedding itself in the door, and Rose's fingers sliding down the blade, almost severing them from her hand. In response, Rose calmly wrapped her hand in <b>a</b> <b>towel</b> <b>and</b> said: [...] "Look what you done, fella. You've got {{to take me to the}} hospital now." ...|$|E
