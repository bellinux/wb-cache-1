25|$|Mucormycosis is {{commonly}} contracted via inhalation of spores resulting in rhinocerebral and pulmonary mucormycoses but infection with Apophysomyces variabilis is contracted cutaneously. Apophysomyces species cause infections {{of the skin}} and soft-tissue following injuries such as burns, automotive <b>accidents,</b> <b>surgeries,</b> and injections both intramuscular and subcutaneous. Cutaneous mucormycosis is acquired when the sporangiospores from contaminated soil and water {{come into contact with}} broken skin. For this reason, disease is seen in burn patients, injured persons, and injection-drug users. The infection may take clinical forms such as necrotizing fasciitis, cerebritis, rhinoorbital infections, and kidney infections. Successful treatment depends on early detection of infection, surgical debridement of necrotic tissues, and anti-fungal therapy with drugs such as posaconazole and amphotericin B. Members of the order Mucorales generally infect immunocompromised patients but A. variabilis infections tend to occur in immunocompetent healthy hosts.|$|R

5000|$|This {{incident}} attracted public attention, however, and she {{was assigned}} as a war painter for the [...] "Kriegspressequartier" [...] (War Press Bureau).

She later received numerous commissions from the Museum of Military History. After the war, she lived in Vienna with her companion, Franziska Groß (1900-1973), who later became a doctor, and held several exhibitions with the Künstlerhaus Wien, the Vienna Secession and the Hagenbund. Her activities were interrupted for a time in 1928, following an accident that resulted in a double ankle fracture, but she was able to get treatment from Lorenz Böhler, a doctor who is credited with establishing the field of <b>accident</b> <b>surgery.</b> She recovered completely and made extensive travels through Germany and Italy.|$|E
5000|$|The {{condition}} usually {{results from}} infection, injury (<b>accident,</b> <b>surgery),</b> hypoperfusion and hypermetabolism. The primary cause triggers an uncontrolled inflammatory response. Sepsis {{is the most}} common cause. Sepsis may result in septic shock. In the absence of infection, a sepsis-like disorder is termed systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS). Both SIRS and sepsis could ultimately progress to multiple organ dysfunction syndrome. However, in one-third of the patients no primary focus can be found. Multiple organ dysfunction syndrome is well established as the final stage of a continuum: SIRS + infection [...] sepsis [...] severe sepsis [...] Multiple organ dysfunction syndrome. Currently, investigators are looking into genetic targets for possible gene therapy to prevent the progression to Multiple organ dysfunction syndrome. Some authors have conjectured that the inactivation of the transcription factors NF-κB and AP-1 would be appropriate targets in preventing sepsis and SIRS. These two genes are pro-inflammatory. However, they are essential components of a normal healthy immune response, so there is risk of increasing vulnerability to infection, which can also cause clinical deterioration.|$|E
50|$|For a {{short time}} (1911—and then again in 1919, 1920) Lorenz Böhler {{was working at the}} clinic of surgeon Julius Hochenegg, who was his Professor at University.

Since September 1911 Böhler worked as a physician on a ship for a few months, until he started to work at the garrison’s hospital at Ragusa, where he became a k. u. k. substitute medical assistant. There he mostly did bacteriological work.In Autumn 1912 he became an assistant doctor at the hospital in Bozen and in April 1913 he became assistant doctor in Tetschen an der Elbe.In 1914 Lorenz Böhler went to an international surgeons congress in New York. On his way to the congress he met Belgian doctor Albin Lambotte, who told him about surgical methods of fracture treatment.Afterwards Böhler spent some time at the Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota, where he met Charles Horace Mayo. Mayo told him about the centres of fracture treatment at London and Liverpool. There was nothing like this in the German-speaking part of Europe. Mayo gave Böhler a commendatory letter for Arbuthnot Lane in London, who was one of the leading European doctors in surgical fracture treatment, but the breakout of World War I made it impossible for Böhler to visit Lane.|$|E
40|$|Aim. This {{retrospective}} study aimed at investigating indications, surgical approaches, and {{the materials used}} for orbital floor reconstructions, {{as well as the}} clinical followup, particularly with regard to postoperative complications. Methods. This study comprised 120 patients who underwent surgery for orbital floor fractures between 2001 and 2011. Diagnosis and treatment were based on both physical examination and orbital CT scan. Patients were retrospectively analyzed for data, such as mechanism of injury, classification of fracture, and complications. Results. The most common cause of injury was physical assault followed by traffic <b>accidents.</b> <b>Surgery</b> was performed with a mean delay of 5 days after the incident. Subciliary lower eyelid incision was the most common surgical approach to the orbital floor, followed by mid lower eyelid incision and transconjunctival lower-eyelid approach. For orbital floor reconstruction, collagenous membrane derived from bovine pericardium (65 %) is mainly used, followed by titanium mesh (35 %); 18. 0 % of patients showed postoperative complications: 10. 0 % presented transient hypesthesia, 4. 2 % transient diplopia, 2. 0 % enophthalmos, 1 % visible scar and 0. 8 % from scleral show. Conclusion. The main goal of this report is to discuss indications and timing for surgical repair of orbital floor fracture fractures and other facial fracture.
