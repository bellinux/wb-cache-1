5|$|A 65-yard screen {{pass from}} Vince Evans to Walter Payton gave the Bears a 13–10 lead. The Buccaneers {{answered}} {{that with a}} drive that ended with an eight-yard touchdown reception by Isaac Hagins. This score, with 5:08 left in the game, put the Buccaneers ahead of the Bears and left them <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> remaining undefeated team in the league. It was the third consecutive loss for the Bears. Jerry Eckwood also contributed a 61-yard touchdown run, the longest running play in Buccaneers history to that point. A broken wrist suffered in this game would contribute to Eckwood's diminished performance later in the season.|$|E

5|$|Adult Psylliodes luridipennis beetles are {{invariably}} {{found on}} the Lundy cabbage (Coincya wrightii), a species endemic to the island of Lundy, where they feed on the leaves. They are not found on other locally occurring plants. However, researchers were also able to lure the beetles onto other crucifers taken from gardens. Two other taxa are known only from Lundy cabbages—the true weevil Ceutorhynchus contractus var. pallipes and an undescribed race of the flea beetle Psylliodes napi—making the plant unique to Britain <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> endemic species which is the exclusive host to endemic insect species. However, the Lundy cabbage is also host to a diverse variety of other invertebrate species.|$|E
5|$|After Richard's {{death on}} 6 April 1199 {{there were two}} {{potential}} claimants to the Angevin throne: John, whose claim rested on being the sole surviving son of Henry II, and young Arthur I of Brittany, who held a claim {{as the son of}} John's elder brother Geoffrey. Richard appears to have started to recognise John as his heir presumptive in the final years before his death, but the matter was not clear-cut and medieval law gave little guidance as to how the competing claims should be decided. With Norman law favouring John <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> surviving son of Henry II and Angevin law favouring Arthur <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> son of Henry's elder son, the matter rapidly became an open conflict. John was supported by the bulk of the English and Norman nobility and was crowned at Westminster, backed by his mother, Eleanor. Arthur was supported by the majority of the Breton, Maine and Anjou nobles and received the support of Philip II, who remained committed to breaking up the Angevin territories on the continent. With Arthur's army pressing up the Loire valley towards Angers and Philip's forces moving down the valley towards Tours, John's continental empire was in danger of being cut in two.|$|E

5|$|After {{starting}} the 2017–18 {{season with a}} 3–5 record, James led the Cavaliers to a 130–122 win over the Washington Wizards on November 3 to end a four-game losing skid. He scored 57 points in the game to set the second-highest point total of his career, making 23 of 34 field-goal tries and all nine free throws, adding 11 rebounds and seven assists. James reached at least 10 points for the 800th game in a row, joining Michael Jordan (866) <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> other NBA player with a streak that long. James also became the youngest player to reach 29,000 career points in the NBA.|$|E
5|$|After {{suffering}} over 4,000 {{casualties in}} ten days, {{the failure of}} the last attack ended the 45th Division's role <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> combatant on the Chinese side.

Despite the initial setbacks, Deng Hua, acting commander of the PVA, considered the situation a golden opportunity to bleed the US military white. In the strategy meeting held on the evening of October 25, the 15th Corps was ordered to retake the two hills regardless of the cost.|$|E

After Russia's defeat in the 1905 Russo-Japanese war, her influence had declined, and it was Afghanistan that was at the time seen by Britain <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> power in the sub-continent capable of directly threatening India.|$|E
