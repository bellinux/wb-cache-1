5|$|Augustus' public revenue reforms had a {{great impact}} on the {{subsequent}} success of the Empire. Augustus brought <b>a</b> <b>far</b> <b>greater</b> portion of the Empire's expanded land base under consistent, direct taxation from Rome, instead of exacting varying, intermittent, and somewhat arbitrary tributes from each local province as Augustus' predecessors had done. This reform greatly increased Rome's net revenue from its territorial acquisitions, stabilized its flow, and regularized the financial relationship between Rome and the provinces, rather than provoking fresh resentments with each new arbitrary exaction of tribute.|$|E
5|$|Between September 2008 and December 2010, twenty-two spectra were {{collected}} using the High Resolution Echelle Spectrometer (HIRES) instrument at Hawaii's W.M. Keck Observatory.

5|$|At {{therapeutic}} doses, amphetamine causes {{emotional and}} cognitive effects such as euphoria, change in desire for sex, increased wakefulness, and improved cognitive control. It induces physical effects such as decreased reaction time, fatigue resistance, and increased muscle strength. Larger doses of amphetamine may impair cognitive function and induce rapid muscle breakdown. Drug addiction {{is a serious}} risk with large recreational doses but is unlikely to arise from typical long-term medical use at therapeutic doses. Very high doses can result in psychosis (e.g., delusions and paranoia) which rarely occurs at therapeutic doses even during long-term use. Recreational doses are generally much larger than prescribed therapeutic doses and carry <b>a</b> <b>far</b> <b>greater</b> risk of serious side effects.|$|E
5|$|Conditions on Titan {{could become}} far more {{habitable}} {{in the far}} future. Five billion years from now, as the Sun becomes a red giant, its surface temperature could rise enough for Titan to support liquid water on its surface, making it habitable. As the Sun's ultraviolet output decreases, the haze in Titan's upper atmosphere will be depleted, lessening the anti-greenhouse effect {{on the surface and}} enabling the greenhouse created by atmospheric methane to play <b>a</b> <b>far</b> <b>greater</b> role. These conditions together could create a habitable environment, and could persist for several hundred million years. This is proposed to have been sufficient time for simple life to spawn on Earth, though the presence of ammonia on Titan would cause chemical reactions to proceed more slowly.|$|E

5|$|Reviewers gave Empire: Total War {{universal}} acclaim; several critics commended {{it as one}} of {{the foremost}} strategy titles of recent times. Praise was bestowed upon the extensive strategic breadth, accurate historical challenges and visual effects. The real-time land battles, with <b>a</b> <b>far</b> <b>greater</b> focus on gunpowder weaponry than earlier Total War titles, were considered successful. Criticisms focused on shortcomings with the game's artificial intelligence and on the real-time naval battles being difficult to control and co-ordinate. The game was a commercial success, topping sales charts within a week of release; nevertheless, several Creative Assembly employees later commented on various issues caused by a perceived early release.|$|E
5|$|The Comet had a {{total of}} four {{hydraulic}} systems, two primaries, one secondary, and a final emergency system for basic functions such as lowering the undercarriage. The undercarriage could also be lowered by a combination of gravity and a hand-pump. Power was syphoned from all four engines for the hydraulics, cabin air conditioning, and the de-icing system; these systems had operational redundancy in that they could keep working even if only a single engine was active. The majority of hydraulic components were centred in a single avionics bay. A pressurised refuelling system, developed by Flight Refuelling Ltd, allowed the Comet's fuel tanks to be refuelled at <b>a</b> <b>far</b> <b>greater</b> rate than other methods.|$|E
5|$|Adderall is {{generally}} well-tolerated and effective in treating {{the symptoms of}} ADHD and narcolepsy. At therapeutic doses, Adderall causes emotional and cognitive effects such as euphoria, change in desire for sex, increased wakefulness, and improved cognitive control. At these doses, it induces physical effects such as decreased reaction time, fatigue resistance, and increased muscle strength. In contrast, much larger doses of Adderall can impair cognitive control, cause rapid muscle breakdown, or induce a psychosis (e.g., delusions and paranoia). The side effects of Adderall vary widely among individuals, but most commonly include insomnia, dry mouth, and loss of appetite. The risk of developing an addiction is insignificant when Adderall is used as prescribed at fairly low daily doses, such as those used for treating ADHD; however, the routine use of Adderall in larger daily doses poses a significant risk of addiction due to the pronounced reinforcing effects that are present at higher doses. Recreational doses of Adderall are generally much larger than prescribed therapeutic doses, and carry <b>a</b> <b>far</b> <b>greater</b> risk of serious adverse effects.|$|E

5|$|Cricket {{followers}} {{from the}} south of England remained slightly distrustful of Hutton owing to the perception that he occasionally carried professionalism to excess. When he was appointed England captain, many in the cricketing establishment held his professionalism against him {{with the result that}} Hutton never felt comfortable dealing with the amateurs who ran English cricket at the time. While captain, he was criticised for caution and negativity but also was expected to lead a successful team at a time when results began to assume <b>a</b> <b>far</b> <b>greater</b> importance than in previous years. Consequently, Hutton never felt secure in the position and was often uncomfortable around the amateur establishment. Like Herbert Sutcliffe, he attempted to alter his accent to match that of leading southern amateurs to help him to fit in. But he did not enjoy the attention that went with the captaincy, and he often worried about the impression he was making.|$|E
5|$|For {{the most}} part the player battles through the single-player game alone, but is {{occasionally}} assisted by friendly non-player characters. Security guards and scientists will occasionally help the player in reaching new areas and convey relevant plot information. However, Opposing Force also features fellow U.S. Marines who will assist the player in combat to <b>a</b> <b>far</b> <b>greater</b> degree than security guards. Three types of Marines are featured in the game: the soldier will simply provide fire support for the player with a submachine gun, shotgun or machine gun, the combat medic is capable of healing the player and other non-player characters, while the engineer can cut through doors and remove obstacles, allowing the player and their squad to proceed unhindered. A selection of enemies from Half-Life populate the game, including alien creatures such as headcrabs and Vortigaunts.|$|E
5|$|In {{his major}} {{theoretical}} statement, 'Opera and Drama' (1852), Wagner {{objected to the}} music of Meyerbeer, asserting its superficiality and incoherence in dramatic terms; this work contains Wagner's well-known put-down of Meyerbeer's operas as 'effects without causes'. It also contains the sardonic crack that ' never could have dreamt that it would some day occur to the Bankers, for whom he had always made their music, to make it for themselves'. 'Jewishness in Music' was reissued in 1869, (after Meyerbeer's death) in an extended form, with a far more explicit attack on Meyerbeer. This version was under Wagner's own name – and as Wagner had by now <b>a</b> <b>far</b> <b>greater</b> reputation, his views obtained far wider publicity. These attacks on Meyerbeer (which also included swipes at Felix Mendelssohn) are regarded by Paul Lawrence Rose as a significant milestone in the growth of German anti-Semitism.|$|E
50|$|Endemic to {{south-eastern}} Australia, river blackfish {{like many}} Murray-Darling native fishes {{have managed to}} cross the Great Dividing Range via natural river capture events and so are found in south-flowing coastal rivers and streams in {{the eastern half of}} Victoria. These fish are now often referred to as southern river blackfish. This population shows <b>a</b> <b>far</b> <b>great</b> maximum size of 60 cm or more and about 5.5 kg. Specimens this large were likely to be very old — 30 years or more — and are rarely seen now. Logic suggests that due to these dramatic size differences, as well as isolation from the parent Murray-Darling species, genetic drift and natural selection, southern river blackfish are separate species. The taxonomy has not been reflected to update this.|$|R
