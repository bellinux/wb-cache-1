5|$|In 1910, Kommandøren was modernized at Stavanger Støberi & Dok in Stavanger, {{gaining a}} new boiler for the steam engine and being painted white. In January the next year, she ran <b>aground</b> at Rongevær in the Fensfjord. She ran <b>aground</b> again in 1913, in Herdlefjorden.|$|E
5|$|October 16, 1664 – A British ship blows <b>aground</b> in {{the midst}} of a storm.|$|E
5|$|On 27 August 1928, Kommandøren ran <b>aground</b> at Opdalseldet in Bårdsundet off Tysnesøy Hordaland; she was refloated {{after all}} 350 {{passengers}} {{had been taken}} off. She ran <b>aground</b> yet again in April 1938, when she ran into the island Segløya while en route from Skjerjehamn to Eivindvik. The incident caused severe damage {{to the bottom of}} the hull.|$|E
5|$|She {{remained}} in service until 8 February 1945, {{when she ran}} <b>aground</b> in the Alverstraumen narrows. Kommandøren remained <b>aground</b> for five weeks, and was filled by sea water before being salvaged and towed to Bergen to await repairs. Although the ship's hull was intact, the interior and engine were heavily water damaged.|$|E
5|$|A naval {{footnote}} in {{the history}} of Lundy was the wreck of the Royal Navy battleship HMS Montagu. Steaming in heavy fog, she ran hard <b>aground</b> near Shutter Rock on the island's southwest corner at about 2:00a.m. on 30 May 1906. Thinking they were <b>aground</b> at Hartland Point on the English mainland, a landing party went ashore for help, only finding out where they were after encountering the lighthouse keeper at the island's north light.|$|E
5|$|It {{was during}} this {{assignment}} that she suffered a near-catastrophe when she ran <b>aground</b> on Pearl Rock, near Gibraltar in 1871 and nearly sank. Agincourt was leading the inshore column of ships, contrary to normal practice where the senior flagship lead the inshore column, and gently ran <b>aground</b> sideways when the senior flagship's navigator failed {{to compensate for the}} set of the tide. Warrior, immediately following her, nearly collided with her, but managed to sheer off in time.|$|E
5|$|On 17 October 2011 {{a supply}} ship, M/V Island Trader, with twenty tons of fuel ran <b>aground</b> in the lagoon. The ship refloated at high tide with {{no loss of}} crew or cargo.|$|E
5|$|San Giorgio ran <b>aground</b> in August 1911 off Naples-Posillipo; heavily damaged, she {{was under}} repair until June 1912, missing most of the Italo-Turkish War. San Marco {{supported}} the occupations of Benghazi and Derna, Libya {{during the war and}} bombarded the fortifications defending the entrance to the Dardanelles. She also supported the forces occupying the island of Rhodes in May 1912. In February 1913, San Giorgio cruised the Aegean Sea and made a port visit to Salonica, Greece, the next month. She ran <b>aground</b> again on 21 November in the Strait of Messina, but was only slightly damaged.|$|E
5|$|Two 328 ft (100 m) {{anchored}} {{ships were}} washed <b>aground</b> by strong waves and swells, {{with a total}} of seven ships reported missing. Overall, the hurricane sank nine small ships, and nine fishermen were killed.|$|E
5|$|A strong squall {{swept across}} Matagorda Bay in southeastern Texas on June 27. High winds ripped a ship from its anchor and drove it <b>aground,</b> {{and at least}} one other vessel {{suffered}} structural damage. Although it is included in the Weather Prediction Center's publication, Texas Hurricane History, {{little is known about the}} nature of the storm.|$|E
5|$|Astrid ran <b>aground</b> off {{the coast}} of Ireland on 24 July 2013, and {{subsequently}} sank, with all on board rescued. She was salvaged on 9 September 2013, but as the cost of restoring her was too high she was scrapped and broken up by April 2014.|$|E
5|$|Because {{of their}} long {{association}} with humans, cockroaches are frequently {{referred to in}} popular culture. In Western culture, cockroaches are often depicted as dirty pests. In a 1750–1752 journal, Peter Osbeck noted that cockroaches were frequently seen and {{found their way to}} the bakeries, after the sailing ship Gothenburg ran <b>aground</b> and was destroyed by rocks.|$|E
5|$|Cornwall, {{named to}} commemorate the English county, was laid down at Pembroke Royal Dockyard, Wales, on 11 March 1901, and {{launched}} on 29 October 1902. She was completed on 1 December 1904 and was initially assigned to the 2nd Cruiser Squadron of the Channel Fleet. In December 1906 the ship began a refit that lasted through 1907. She became a cadet training ship in January 1908 and {{was assigned to the}} 4th Cruiser Squadron on the North America and West Indies Station. On 6 August 1911 Cornwall ran <b>aground</b> on Pinnacle Rock, off Cape Sable Island in Nova Scotia while assisting the protected cruiser , which had also run <b>aground.</b> Both cruisers were refloated and Cornwall was repaired at His Majesty's Canadian Dockyard, Halifax.|$|E
5|$|During a storm, the {{freighter}} S.S. Cabinet Minister runs <b>aground</b> near Todday {{in heavy}} fog {{late one night}} and begins to sink. Two local inhabitants, the Biffer and Sammy MacCodrun, row out to investigate and learn from its departing crew that the cargo consists of 50,000 cases of whisky.|$|E
5|$|Extensive {{losses to}} {{agriculture}} also took place, with major crop losses reported and 900cattle killed. According to government officials, the entire banana, rice, and sugar cane crop was destroyed and harvests {{could not be}} made until the following spring. Offshore, nearly 500vessels sank or were destroyed by the storm and the 1,000ton Union Pacific ran <b>aground.</b>|$|E
5|$|Following {{the end of}} World War I in November 1918, Erzherzog Karl {{was first}} taken over by Yugoslavia in 1919, but was then ceded as a war {{reparation}} to France. Erzherzog Karl ran <b>aground</b> at Bizerte on her voyage to Toulon and was eventually broken up in situ.|$|E
5|$|Gromoboi was refloated and {{was sold}} to a German company for {{scrapping}} on 1 July 1922; she ran <b>aground</b> in a storm near Liepāja while under tow to Germany in October 1922. She was scrapped in place.|$|E
5|$|HMS Alceste {{was built}} at Rochefort in 1804 for the French Navy as Minerve, an Armide-class frigate. In {{the spring of}} 1806, prior to her capture, she engaged HMS Pallas, then under Lord Cochrane. During the duel she ran <b>aground</b> but Cochrane had to abort his attack when French {{reinforcements}} appeared.|$|E
5|$|June 6–7, 1832 – The {{center of}} a {{tropical}} cyclone passes over or {{very close to the}} islands. Two schooners in St. George's Harbour are driven <b>aground,</b> and several houses are partially or totally unroofed. Tree damage is extensive.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, the James River Squadron {{had turned}} its {{attention}} to Minnesota, which had left Fort Monroe {{to join in the}} battle and had run <b>aground.</b> After Virginia had dealt with the surrender of Congress, she joined the James River Squadron despite her damage. Because of her deep draft and the falling tide, however, Virginia was unable to get close enough to be effective, and darkness prevented the rest of the squadron from aiming their guns to any effect. The attack was therefore suspended. Virginia left with the expectation of returning the next day and completing the task. She retreated into the safety of Confederate-controlled waters off Sewell's Point for the night, but had killed 400 enemy sailors and had lost two. The Union had lost two ships and three were <b>aground.</b>|$|E
5|$|Of {{the five}} destroyers, three were lost during the war; Waterhen was sunk in the Mediterranean on 30 June 1941, Vampire was sunk by Japanese {{aircraft}} during the Indian Ocean Raid and Voyager ran <b>aground</b> at Betano, during the Timor campaign and was abandoned.|$|E
5|$|On August 3, 2015, divers {{found the}} wreck of the USNS Mission San Miguel (T-AO-129) within the monument. She had sunk there on October 8, 1957 when she ran <b>aground</b> on Maro Reef while running at full speed and in ballast. Researchers will map and study the wreck in situ.|$|E
5|$|Other proffered {{explanations}} are the possible {{appearance of a}} displaced iceberg; the fear of running <b>aground</b> while becalmed, and a sudden seaquake. Hydrographical evidence suggests that an iceberg drifting so far south was improbable, and had it done so other ships would have seen it. Begg gives more consideration to a theory that Mary Celeste, while becalmed, began drifting towards the Dollabarat reef off Santa Maria Island. The theory supposes that Briggs, fearing his ship would run <b>aground,</b> launched the yawl {{in the hope of}} reaching land. The wind could then have picked up and blown Mary Celeste away from the reef, while the rising seas swamped and sank the yawl. The weakness of this theory is that if the ship had been becalmed, all sails would have been set to catch any available breeze, yet the ship was found with many of its sails furled.|$|E
5|$|September 25, 1910 – A {{moderate}} hurricane to {{the east}} damages buildings in St. George's, topples a few banana trees, and blows a ship <b>aground.</b> Heavy rains provide residents with many months of clean drinking water.|$|E
5|$|The 46 pirates were {{scattered}} {{among the three}} sloops. During the night, Bonnet brought all of them aboard the Royal James and planned to fight his way out to sea in the morning rather than risk the Cape Fear River's narrow channels in the dark. Bonnet also {{wrote a letter to}} Governor Johnson, threatening to burn all the ships in Charles Town Harbour. At daybreak, on 27September 1718, Bonnet set sail toward Rhett's force, and all three sloops opened fire, initiating the Battle of Cape Fear River. The two South Carolinian sloops split up in an effort to bracket the Royal James. Bonnet tried to avoid the trap by steering the Royal James close to the river's western shore, but ran <b>aground</b> in the process. Rhett's closing sloops also ran <b>aground,</b> leaving only the Henry in range of the Royal James.|$|E
5|$|The Hellcats and Fireflies {{were first}} to attack, and strafed {{anti-aircraft}} positions {{as well as}} the destroyer Z33 and small patrol craft Vp 6307. The patrol craft was forced <b>aground</b> and later declared a total loss. Due to the thick smoke, the fighter pilots were only able to locate targets by aiming at the sources of tracer gunfire.|$|E
5|$|The {{fighting}} {{occurred after}} a company-sized Australian force from the 31st/51st Infantry Battalion made an amphibious landing {{north of the}} Porton Plantation jetties {{in an attempt to}} outflank the Japanese positions on the Ratsua front, which were holding up the advance of the 26th and the 31st/51st Infantry Battalions from the 11th Brigade. The Australians landed unopposed and established a small perimeter, but some of their landing craft ran <b>aground</b> and they were unable to bring their heavy weapons and support elements ashore. Troops from the Japanese 87th Naval Garrison Force quickly surrounded the beachhead and, as their supply situation grew desperate, the Australians were forced to withdraw. In the course of their evacuation by sea another landing craft ran <b>aground.</b> Over the next two days several unsuccessful rescue attempts were made until eventually, in the early morning of 11 June, the last Australian survivors were picked up.|$|E
5|$|The {{island of}} Dominica {{suffered}} severe damage from Hurricane Omar. The village of Scotts Head, {{with a population}} of 450, was cut {{off from the rest of}} the country as roads were extensively damaged. The village also suffered water losses, electricity shortage, and landline telephones were cut off. Ports throughout the country were severely damaged. All barge access for hauling sand and stones were destroyed. The airport also sustained some damage. Seven boats ran <b>aground</b> during the storm. Minor damage was reported in Anguilla. Two hotels sustained roof damage, downed treed knocked down power lines causing scattered power outages, and the rough seas caused severe beach erosion. Three cargo ships and seven boats ran <b>aground</b> and two other boats sank.|$|E
5|$|The next day, however, loyal {{crew members}} regained {{control of the}} ship and they ran her <b>aground</b> and {{surrendered}} to the authorities. In August 1905, 75 mutineers were tried. Koshuba and two others were executed and 19 sailors got 185 years of hard labour.|$|E
5|$|The {{ship was}} {{assigned}} to the 5th Cruiser Squadron from 1906 to 1908 and was then transferred to the 1st Cruiser Squadron of the Channel Fleet. When the Royal Navy's cruiser squadrons were reorganized in 1909, Duke of Edinburgh rejoined the 5th Cruiser Squadron of the Atlantic Fleet. On 13 August 1910 Duke of Edinburgh ran <b>aground</b> on Atherfield Ledge, Isle of Wight. She was successfully refloated, but in the resulting Court-martial to investigate the incident, the ship's Captain and Navigating Officer were severely reprimanded and the latter dismissed from the ship. She helped to rescue the survivors of the SS Delhi which ran <b>aground</b> off the coast of Morocco in December 1911. From 1913 to 1914 she served with the 1st Cruiser Squadron of the Mediterranean Fleet.|$|E
5|$|Twenty {{minutes after}} {{sighting}} the lighthouse, the ship ran <b>aground</b> violently {{at full speed}} amongst the rocks of Maenheere Reef, {{a quarter of a}} mile off The Lizard. Suevic was about 16 miles closer to the shore than her command crew believed.|$|E
5|$|Across the battlefield, as {{the first}} line of Persian ships was pushed back by the Greeks, they became fouled in the {{advancing}} second and third lines of their own ships. On the Greek left, the Persian admiral Ariabignes (a brother of Xerxes) was killed early in the battle; left disorganised and leaderless, the Phoenician squadrons appear to have been pushed back against the coast, many vessels running <b>aground.</b> In the centre, a wedge of Greek ships pushed through the Persians lines, splitting the fleet in two.|$|E
5|$|After {{covering}} the landing force for two days, HMAS Vendetta, Barcoo and Swan proceeded to Wide Bay and bombarded Japanese positions there before departing the New Britain area. The motor launches ML 802 and ML 827 remained at Jacquinot Bay and conducted patrols {{along the south}} coast of the island in search of Japanese barges. ML 827 ran <b>aground</b> during a patrol on 17 November, and sank three days later while under tow to an Allied base; all of her crew survived. A Japanese air raid was conducted against Jacquinot Bay on 23 November.|$|E
5|$|After her Navy service {{ended in}} 1919, she was {{returned}} to her original owners, who, at least once, chartered her to another shipping company. In May 1922, Iowan rammed and sank the Furness-Prince Line steamer Welsh Prince in the Columbia River near Astoria, Oregon, killing seven men in the process. In June 1941, Iowan ran <b>aground</b> on a reef near Point Conception, California, and suffered $500,000 in damages while buffeted by waves on the reef. She was freed from the reef after two weeks, towed to Los Angeles, and repaired.|$|E
5|$|After the Scilly naval {{disaster}} of 1707 where four ships ran <b>aground</b> due to navigational mistakes, the British government offered a large prize of £20,000, equivalent {{to millions of}} pounds today, for anyone who could determine longitude accurately. The reward was eventually claimed in 1761 by Yorkshire carpenter John Harrison, who dedicated his life to improving the accuracy of his clocks.|$|E
5|$|After the {{outbreak}} of World War I in August 1914, Marceau was converted into a floating workshop to support torpedo boats and submarines. She was initially based in Malta, but was later moved to Corfu and then to Bizerte in 1918. She was stricken from the naval register on 1 October 1920, and sold to a shipbreaking firm based in Toulon in 1921. While she was being towed to Toulon, a storm caused her to run <b>aground</b> off Bizerte. She remained visible there until the 1930s.|$|E
