5|$|On July 30, 1813, General Harrison again wrote Shelby {{requesting}} volunteers, <b>and</b> <b>this</b> <b>time</b> <b>he</b> {{asked that}} Shelby lead them personally. Shelby raised {{a force of}} 3,500 volunteers, double the number Harrison requested. Future governor John J. Crittenden served as Shelby's aide-de-camp.

5|$|In {{addition}} to Trunajaya's forces, Amangkurat II continued to face opposition {{from his brother}} Pangeran Puger, who had taken the old capital in Plered and had claimed the throne for himself in 1677. Before the defeat of Trunajaya, Amangkurat's forces had not taken action against him. After Trunajaya was defeated, Amangkurat still could not convince his brother to submit. In September 1680 Amangkurat constructed a new capital in Kartasura. In November, Amangkurat and VOC forces drove Puger from Plered. However, Puger quickly rebuilt his forces, took Plered again in August 1681, and nearly took Kartasura. In November 1681 VOC and Mataram forces again defeated Puger, <b>and</b> <b>this</b> <b>time</b> <b>he</b> submitted and was pardoned by his brother.|$|E

5|$|One morning, after Tod's {{escape from}} the greyhounds, the Master sends Copper on the hunt. After {{he picks up the}} fox's trail, Copper relentlessly pursues him {{throughout}} the day and into the next morning. Tod finally drops dead of exhaustion, and Copper collapses on top of him, close to death himself. The Master nurses Copper back to health, and both enjoy their new popularity, but after a few months the excitement over Copper's accomplishment dies down. The Master is left alone again, and returns to drinking. He is once again asked to consider living in a nursing home, <b>and</b> <b>this</b> <b>time</b> <b>he</b> agrees. Crying, he takes his shotgun from the wall, leads Copper outside, and pets him gently before ordering him to lie down. He covers the dog's eyes as Copper licks his hand trustingly.|$|E
5|$|The {{second quarter}} began with Virginia Tech in {{possession}} of the ball and facing a long third down after a quarterback sack on the final play of the first quarter. On the first play of the quarter, Tech quarterback Al Clark was sacked by Brian Simmons, <b>and</b> <b>this</b> <b>time</b> <b>he</b> fumbled the ball. The loose ball was {{picked up in the}} end zone by Carolina defender Greg Ellis for the Tar Heels' third touchdown of the game. Because North Carolina missed its extra-point kick following its previous touchdown, Tar Heels' head coach Carl Torbush ordered the team to attempt a two-point conversion in order to gain the missed extra point from the previous play. A pass attempt by Keldorf fell incomplete, but with just seven seconds elapsed in the second quarter, North Carolina led 220.|$|E
5|$|In August 1899, Gellibrand easily {{passed the}} {{examinations}} for promotion to captain, but was {{passed over for}} the post of adjutant of the 2nd Battalion of the South Lancashire Regiment, then based in St Helens, Merseyside. In October the post became vacant again, <b>and</b> <b>this</b> <b>time</b> <b>he</b> secured it. The South African War had broken out, and the 2nd Battalion embarked for South Africa on 30 November, but Gellibrand was left behind, {{in charge of the}} regimental depot. He eventually received orders to embark for South Africa with reinforcements on 3 January 1900. He arrived in South Africa on 25 January 1900. Soon after, he was given command of D Company. As such he participated in the relief of Ladysmith, leading a bayonet charge on 27 February. His company entered the town on 3 March. Five days later he became ill with typhoid, and lay in a comatose state until 3 April. He was joined in Durban by Elsie, who had made her way out to South Africa with Cecil Rhodes, and they embarked for England together on 26 May, arriving at Southampton on 18 June.|$|E

25|$|Zeno sent Marcian and his {{brothers}} to Caesarea in Cappadocia. They tried to flee, but Marcian was captured and obliged to become a monk in Tarsus (Cilicia), or imprisoned in Isauria, in the fortress of Papurius. He tried to escape a second time, <b>and</b> <b>this</b> <b>time</b> <b>he</b> succeeded, but, after gathering new troops and attacking Ancyra, he was defeated and captured by Trocundus, Illus' brother.|$|E
25|$|On 26 February Bevin again {{reiterated that}} the best way to prevent another Czechoslovakia was to evolve a joint Western {{military}} strategy, <b>and</b> <b>this</b> <b>time</b> <b>he</b> got a more receptive hearing, especially considering American anxiety over Italy. That spring, European leaders quietly met with U.S. defence, military and diplomatic officials at the Pentagon, under Marshall's orders, exploring a framework for a new and unprecedented association for mutual defence. The following year, NATO would ultimately be born out of these talks.|$|E

25|$|The {{first story}} in which Superman dies was {{published}} in Superman #188 (April 1966) {{in which he is}} killed by kryptonite radiation, but is revived in the same issue by one of his android doppelgangers. In the 1990s The Death and Return of Superman story arc, after a deadly battle with Doomsday, Superman died in Superman #75 (Jan. 1993). He was later revived by the Eradicator. In Superman #52 (May 2016) Superman is killed by kryptonite poisoning, <b>and</b> <b>this</b> <b>time</b> <b>he</b> was not resurrected, but replaced by the Superman of a previous continuity.|$|E
25|$|Ferry {{served as}} a probate judge soon after being {{admitted}} to the bar. At age 32, {{he was elected to}} a term in the Connecticut Senate representing the 12th District. He then served as the State's Attorney for Fairfield County from 1856 to 1859. Ferry {{was a member of the}} Toleration Party, but in 1856 became a Republican. After joining the party, he campaigned for John C. Frémont. In 1857, Ferry was nominated to serve in the United States House of Representatives, but lost the election.

25|$|In 1987, {{he defended}} his title against former Olympic {{teammate}} and Gold medal winner Henry Tillman, who had beaten Mike Tyson twice as an amateur. He retained his belt, winning by seventh-round knockout, {{and then went}} on to unify his WBA belt with the IBF belt held by Ricky Parkey, knocking Parkey out in three rounds. For his next bout, he returned to France, where he retained the title with an eleven-round knockout against former world champion Ossie Ocasio. In his last fight of 1987, he offered Muhammad Qawi a rematch <b>and,</b> <b>this</b> <b>time,</b> <b>he</b> beat Qawi by a knockout in only four rounds.|$|E

25|$|From 1955, however, Dollery's {{career with}} Warwickshire took a {{downward}} turn. Picked {{for only about}} half the first-team matches in 1955 and overtaken by both Bannister and Thompson, he took only 38 wickets and his average was more than 30 runs per wicket, high for this period of English cricket. In 1956, there were days of individual triumph: against Gloucestershire, he took five wickets for 77 runs; against Kent he again took three wickets in three balls, a second hat-trick. But by mid-July {{he was out of the}} team <b>and</b> <b>this</b> <b>time</b> <b>he</b> did not return, not being re-engaged by the county at the end of the 1956 season, although he made a single second eleven appearance in 1957.|$|E
25|$|Those {{individuals}} {{who participated in}} the Expo project were also impacted; Mexican interim ambassador Federico Gamboa tells in his memoirs that Spanish sculptor Justo de Gandarias, and elderly man when he met him on 20 June 1899, was still in Guatemala two years after the failed Expo because the government had not paid him for his services. Two years after that, Gamboa met with the sculptor again, <b>and</b> <b>this</b> <b>time</b> <b>he</b> tells that Gandarias had lost all hope of ever getting paid and that was in Guatemala barely surviving by selling cigarettes in Guatemala City; Gamboa visited Gandarias at his home and tells how the sculptures place was in total disarray, but kept some old paintings and sculptures that he was hoping to sell if he ever went back to Spain.|$|E

25|$|Jordan {{announced}} he would return for the 2002–03 season, <b>and</b> <b>this</b> <b>time</b> <b>he</b> {{was determined to be}} equipped with reinforcements, as he traded for All-Star Jerry Stackhouse and signed budding star Larry Hughes. Jordan even accepted a sixth-man role on the bench in order for his knee to survive the rigors of an 82–game season. A combination of numerous team injuries and uninspired play led to Jordan's return to the starting lineup, where he tried to rebound the franchise from its early-season struggles. By the end of the season, the Wizards finished with a 37–45 record once again. Jordan ended the season as the only Wizard to play in all 82 games, as he averaged 20.0 points, 6.9 rebounds, 3.8 assists, and 1.5 steals in 37.0 minutes per game.|$|E
25|$|After Brown left, Earl Temple, who had {{inherited}} Stowe from his uncle Lord Cobham, {{turned to a}} garden designer called Richard Woodward, who had been gardener at Wotton House, the Earl's previous home. The work of naturalising the landscape started by Brown was continued under Woodward and was accomplished by the mid-1750s. At the same time Earl Temple {{turned his attention to}} the various temples and monuments. He altered several of Vanburgh's and Gibbs's temples to make them conform to his taste for Neoclassical architecture. To accomplish this he employed Giovanni Battista Borra from 1752 to 1756. Also at this time several monuments were moved to other parts of the garden. Earl Temple made further alterations in the gardens from the early 1760s. This is when several of the older structures were demolished <b>and</b> <b>this</b> <b>time</b> <b>he</b> turned to his cousin Thomas Pitt, 1st Baron Camelford who was assisted by Borra, whose most notable design was the Corinthian Arch.|$|E
