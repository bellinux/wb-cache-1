40|$|Background: KADARZI {{could be}} {{realized}} by optimizing {{the role of}} family, namely by increasing nutrition knowledge, changing <b>attitude</b> <b>and</b> <b>behavior</b> <b>and</b> developing independent family. The poor knowledge, <b>attitude</b> <b>and</b> <b>behavior</b> of society, especially house wives, to-ward nutrition and health are important factors which influence the realization of KADARZI programme. The evaluation of KADARZI programme in 2002 in Indragiri Hilir resulted 22. 41 % from the target 80 %. One way to increase society’s knowledge, <b>attitude</b> <b>and</b> <b>behavior</b> toward nutrition is by giving nutrition education during early life. Objective: The study was purposed to investigate the influence of nutrition education among elementary school students to KADARZI house wives knowledge, <b>attitude</b> <b>and</b> <b>behavior.</b> Method: This was quasi experimental with non-randomized control group pretest-posttest study. Subjects were elementary students in the fourth, fifth, and sixth class along with their mothers. The place was in Indragiri Hilir district. Subjects were gathered by purposive. The quantity of subjects were determined with sample formulation, knowledge, <b>attitude</b> <b>and</b> <b>behavior</b> data were gathered by interview and observation adjusted in questionnaire list. Characteristic was analyzed with chi square, statistic test with t-test, with significance level of p= 0. 05. Result: The analysis of age, education, occupation, the number of household members and family income of both group were similar. Pretest analysis of knowledge, <b>attitude</b> <b>and</b> <b>behavior</b> among students <b>and</b> mothers in both groups were also similar in both groups before intervention.

40|$|A {{review of}} recent {{research}} (1988 to 1998) on {{gender differences in}} environmental <b>attitudes</b> <b>and</b> <b>behaviors</b> found that, contrary to past inconsistencies, a clearer pic-ture has emerged: Women report stronger environmental <b>attitudes</b> <b>and</b> <b>behaviors</b> than men. Additional evidence of gender differences in environmental <b>attitudes</b> <b>and</b> <b>behaviors</b> was also supported across age (Study 1) and across 14 countries (Study 2). As a single variable, the effect of gender on proenvironmental behavior was consistently stronger than on environmental attitudes. Explanations for gen-der differences in environmentalism were examined in Study 3. It was found that compared to males, females had higher levels of socialization to be other oriented and socially responsible. Implications for theory, social action, and policy are discussed. One of the ways psychologists can promote environmentalism is to under-stand the relationship between demographic variables <b>and</b> environmental <b>attitudes</b> <b>and</b> <b>behaviors</b> <b>and</b> the implications these human-environment relationships may have on theory, social action, and policy.
