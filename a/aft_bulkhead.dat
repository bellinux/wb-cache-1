The chief {{engineer}} and his assistant, Spencer and Hillery, remained belowdecks long enough to extinguish the boilers and open safety valves to prevent the explosion of the boilers. They finished the task just before the <b>aft</b> <b>bulkhead</b> gave way to the inrushing seawater. Both arrived on deck in time to board lifeboat number 2, which had been held as long as possible for men in the after part of the ship.|$|E

In this sheered salon, the ceiling accommodated an oval recess in which the lighting was designed in a zodiac fashion. This room was converted into an auditorium in 1964.

5000|$|K-278 had {{a double}} hull, the inner one being {{composed}} of titanium, which {{gave her an}} operating depth far {{greater than that of}} the best American submarines.

Initial Western intelligence estimates of K-278’s speed were based on the assumption that it was powered by a pair of liquid-metal lead-bismuth reactors. When the Soviet Union revealed that the submarine used a single OK-650b-3 conventional pressurized-water reactor, these speed estimates were lowered.|$|R

2500|$|The C-5C is a {{specially}} modified variant for transporting large cargo. Two C-5s (68-0213 and 68-0216) were modified {{to have a}} larger internal cargo capacity to accommodate large payloads, such as satellites. The major modifications were {{the removal of the}} rear passenger compartment floor, splitting the rear cargo door in the middle, and installing a new movable <b>aft</b> <b>bulkhead</b> further to the rear. [...] The official C-5 technical manual refers to the version as C-5A(SCM) Space Cargo Modified. Modifications also included adding a second inlet for ground power, which can feed any power-dependent equipment that may form part of the cargo. The two C-5Cs are operated by U.S. Air Force crews for DOD spacecraft programs and NASA, and are stationed at Travis AFB, California. Both 68-0213 and 68-0216 completed the Avionics Modernization Program by January 2007. 68-0213 is being upgraded in RERP to the C-5M (SCM) standard.|$|E

40|$|Launch {{remains an}} {{obstacle}} for small satellites, {{which are often}} limited to small platforms, <b>aft</b> <b>bulkheads,</b> and accommodations for a single P-Pod. While launch vehicles have expanded the space available to small satellites, {{the largest number of}} satellites deployed in a single launch stands at thirty-seven. Spaceflight has secured a single launch opportunity in 2015 for no less than 87 small satellites. The ability to support so many satellites stems from tactical design decisions. This paper focuses on the design trades for the payload adapters developed for the 2015 SHERPA launch. Three unique payload adapters were designed to interface to the Moog ESPA Grande ring, the core of the SHERPA spacecraft. Each is an aluminum plate that interfaces to the 24 ” bolt-hole pattern on the five ESPA Grande ports. For these adapters, a balance was struck between designing to the unique payload in the flight configuration and developing a reusable system. The paper discusses the initial design trades regarding the adapter plate capabilities and how these trades have affected the plates’ utility on later SHERPA missions...|$|R
