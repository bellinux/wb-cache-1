500|$|During {{the trial}} of Sir John Fenwick, who was implicated in a plot to assassinate King William, Gloucester signed {{a letter to the}} King {{promising}} his loyalty. [...] "I, your Majesty's most dutiful subject," [...] the letter read, [...] "had rather lose my life in your Majesty's cause than in any man's else, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>hope</b> <b>it</b> will not be long ere you conquer France." [...] Added to the letter was a declaration by the boys in Gloucester's army: [...] "We, your Majesty's subjects, will stand by you while we have a drop of blood." ...|$|E
500|$|On December 2, 2010, Hayes {{apologized for}} the pain and {{suffering}} he had caused the Petit family and added that: [...] "Death for me will be a welcome relief <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>hope</b> <b>it</b> will bring some peace and comfort to those who I have hurt so much." [...] Judge Jon Blue formally imposed six death sentences, one for each of the capital charges; Blue then added a sentence of 106 years for other crimes Hayes committed during the home invasion, including kidnapping, burglary, and assault, before finishing with, [...] "This is a terrible sentence, but is, in truth, a sentence you wrote for yourself in flames. May God have mercy on your soul." [...] The judge also gave Hayes an official execution date of May 27, 2011; Blue said that this date was a formality, because if Hayes appealed his case, his execution could be delayed for decades. His death sentence became a life sentence in August 2015 when the state abolished the death penalty.|$|E
500|$|A {{music video}} {{directed}} by Paul Fedor was filmed between October 31 and November 1, 2006. During {{an interview with}} MTV News, Lee said, [...] "There's the me in all white and it's really wintry, and then there's the all-in-black Amy {{under the surface of}} the water of this lake in the forest. So it's the happiness and the sorrow and we're almost singing to each other, trying to figure out how both of us can work." [...] She added that the video was not [...] "so-in-your-face" [...] in order to be made more literal, but expressed her opinion that it's [...] "all about touching somebody <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>hope</b> <b>it</b> does that". For the video, fake snow and trees were used along with various other objects which according to the video's scenic coordinator, were supposed to create a [...] "frozen, gothic, cemetery feel". For the scenes filmed in water, a hydraulic lift was used with which Lee could easily sink and the lake water was colored black.|$|E
6000|$|... "No, Mr. Casson," [...] said Adam, in {{his strong}} voice, {{that could be}} heard along the table; [...] "I've never dined here before, but I come by Captain Donnithorne's wish, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>hope</b> <b>it's</b> not disagreeable to anybody here." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "For {{more than}} a month," [...] she cried, [...] "and {{to think that you}} have never felt it." [...] My action was too much for her gravity, and she fell back against the {{skylight}} in a fit of merriment, which threatened to wake her father. <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>hoped</b> <b>it</b> would.|$|R
60|$|In some way, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>hoped</b> <b>it</b> {{might be}} made clear before many days had passed, the {{delivery}} of a prisoner to Job Lord was, together with the holding of us, a trap for more important ends; but what those ends might be my mind failed totally in the grasping.|$|R
500|$|Initially, {{the song}} [...] "Everyone's at It" [...] was {{announced}} {{to be released}} as the lead single from the album, but it was ultimately decided on [...] "The Fear". While discussing It's Not Me, It's You, Allen stated that her intention was to make [...] "bigger sounding, more ethereal songs, real songs. [...] I think I've grown up a bit as a person <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>hope</b> <b>it</b> reflects that." [...] She released a demo version of the song, which was then called [...] "I Don't Know", onto her Myspace account, along with another song, [...] "I Could Say", in April 2008. The singer declared about {{the inspiration for the}} song, which has to do with materialism and the pressures of being rich and famous: [...] tell you where the inspiration for it came from. I was walking down this street, in this village {{in the middle of the}} countryside in the U.K., and there was this little girl who must have been eight or nine, walking down the street with her mum in, like, high-waisted hot pants and a little crop top. And I just thought, 'That's not really right.' And I could tell she was the kind of girl that would be trying out for Pop Idol in five years time, and wants to be famous when she grows up. And there's definitely the whole culture of that where I come from, and it's not necessarily a culture that I think is particularly healthy. But at the same time, I'm very aware that I am a part of that culture – but it's not something that I feel particularly comfortable with.|$|E
2500|$|In his autobiography, {{the late}} Senator Paul Simon {{described}} [...] "State Senator Ken McClintock, (as) a capable and aggressive young leader" [...] who favors [...] "statehood <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>hope</b> <b>it</b> happens".|$|E
2500|$|This rivalry {{is between}} two teams based in a desert. Arizona Coyotes general manager John Chayka said, [...] "It's a natural rival <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>hope</b> <b>it</b> evolves that way." [...] The first game {{between these two}} teams took place on Saturday, October 7, 2017 with a 2-1 win by the Golden Knights in overtime.|$|E
6000|$|... "So you are {{something}} human, after all," [...] he remarked. [...] "We {{began to think}} you lived underground and only put your head up {{every now and then}} for a little air. I am glad to meet you, Mr. Ware. I enjoy acting in your play very much indeed, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>hope</b> <b>it's</b> only the first of many." ...|$|R

50|$|That morning, Mitchell, not {{discussing}} his intent with the station management, {{stepped to the}} microphone to introduce the show, stating confidently: “It’s a beautiful day in Chicago! It’s a great day to be alive, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>hope</b> <b>it’s</b> even more beautiful wherever you are.” Although the impromptu greeting upset the management, it created a sensation among an audience desperately hungry for a good cheer. The phrase became his signature {{for the remainder of}} his career.|$|R
2500|$|During an {{interview}} with the Blackpool Gazette in February 2007, Gayle mentioned that she {{was in the process of}} writing her first novel. The plot involved an unpleasant TV talent-show judge who discovers he is dying. She said: [...] "It's sort of fiction but not fiction but it is made up and true, so when you read it you'll see it's fictional but also real, [...] <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>hope</b> <b>it</b> explains a few things about the pop business.". It was never published.|$|E
2500|$|After {{the release}} of her first album, her parent record company, EMI, {{was taken over by}} Terra Firma. She also changed her {{management}} company from Empire Artist Management to Twenty-First Artists, although her core team remained in place. At the urging of her record company, Allen tried unsuccessfully to create the album with several writers and producers. Allen eventually returned to Greg Kurstin who had written three songs for Alright, Still. The album was produced by Kurstin at Eagle Rock Studios in Los Angeles. Before returning to Kus, Allen co-wrote the songs for the album with Kurstin who played piano on it. This is a change from her earlier work in which she wrote lyrics for finished tracks. Allen released a statement saying [...] "We decided to try and make bigger sounding, more ethereal songs, real songs ... I wanted to work with one person from start to finish to make it one body of work. I wanted it to feel like it had some sort of integrity. I think I've grown up a bit as a person <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>hope</b> <b>it</b> reflects that." [...] She posted two new song demos on her MySpace page and planned to release a mixtape to give her fans an idea of what the new direction was.|$|E
