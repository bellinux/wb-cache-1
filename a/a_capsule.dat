5|$|Females {{have two}} {{openings}} located under {{the edge of}} the mantle in the mantle cavity: the opening of the vagina and an opening for laying eggs. The vagina accepts the sperm during copulation. The vagina is connected to the bursa copulatrix and to the spermatheca (for storing sperm). The other opening is for laying eggs. Egg cells originate in the ovary. Egg cells travel through the oviduct to the fertilization chamber, where fertilization occur. Eggs then develop in the glandular uterus. <b>A</b> <b>capsule</b> is formed in the diverticulum next to the uterus. The eggs are then laid.|$|E
5|$|When {{copulation}} takes place, {{the male}} butterfly or moth places <b>a</b> <b>capsule</b> of sperm (spermatophore) in a receptacle {{of the female}} (called the corpus bursae). The sperm, when released from the capsule, swims directly into or via a small tube into a special seminal receptacle (spermatheca), where the sperm is stored until it is released into the vagina for fertilisation during egg laying, which may occur hours, days, or months after mating. The eggs pass through the ovipore. The ovipore {{may be at the}} end of a modified ovipositor or surrounded by a pair of broad setose anal papillae.|$|E
5|$|As Nazi Germany was {{collapsing}} {{towards the}} end of the war, Braun swore loyalty to Hitler and went to Berlin to be by his side in the heavily reinforced Führerbunker beneath the Reich Chancellery. As Red Army troops fought their way into the neighbourhood on 29 April 1945, she married Hitler during a brief civil ceremony; she was 33 and he was 56. Less than 40 hours later, they committed suicide together in a sitting room of the bunker, she by biting into <b>a</b> <b>capsule</b> of cyanide, and he by a gunshot to the head. The German public was unaware of Braun's relationship with Hitler until after their deaths.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Objective To {{examine the}} {{relationship}} between homestead food production and night blindness among pre-school children in rural Bangladesh {{in the presence of a}} national vitamin A supplementation programme. Design A cross-sectional study. Setting A population-based sample of six rural divisions of Bangladesh assessed in the Bangladesh Nutrition Surveillance Project 2001 - 2005. Subjects A total of 158 898 children aged 12 - 59 months. Results The prevalence rates of night blindness in children among those who did and did not receive vitamin <b>A</b> <b>capsules</b> in the last 6 months were 0 · 07 % and 0 · 13 %, respectively. Given the known effect of vitamin A supplementation on night blindness, the analysis was stratified by children's receipt of vitamin <b>A</b> <b>capsules</b> in the last 6 months. Among children who did not receive vitamin <b>A</b> <b>capsules</b> in the last 6 months, the lack of a home garden was associated with increased odds of night blindness (OR = 3 · 16, 95 % CI 1 · 76, 5 · 68; P = 0 · 0001). Among children who received vitamin <b>A</b> <b>capsules</b> in the last 6 months, the lack of a home garden was not associated with night blindness (OR = 1 · 28, 95 % CI 0 · 71, 2 · 31; P = 0 · 4).

5|$|Fruit : <b>A</b> <b>capsule</b> that {{is usually}} loculicidal (splitting along the locules) as in the Lilioideae, but {{occasionally}} septicidal (splitting between them, along the separating septa) in the Calachortoideae and wind dispersed, although the Medeoleae form berries (baccate). The seeds may be flat, oblong, angular, , ellipsoid or globose (spherical), or compressed with a well developed epidermis. The exterior may be smooth or roughened, with a wing or raphe (ridge), aril or one to two tails, rarely hairy, but may be dull or shiny {{and the lack of}} a black integument distinguishes them from related taxa such as Allioideae that were previously included in this family, and striate (parallel longitudinally ridged) in the Steptopoideae. The hilum (scar) is generally inconspicuous. The bitegmic (separate testa and tegmen) seed coat itself may be thin, suberose (like cork), or crustaceous (hard or brittle). The endosperm is abundant, cartilaginous (fleshy) or horny and contains oils and aleurone but not starch (non-farinaceous). Its cells are polyploid (triploid or pentaploid, depending on the embryo sac type). The embryo is small (usually less than one quarter of seed volume), axile (radially sectioned), linear (longer than broad) or rarely rudimentary (tiny relative to endosperm) depending on placentation type, and straight, bent, curved or curled at the upper end.|$|E

5|$|The Soviet Union had not flown {{any further}} flights {{by the time}} MA-7 landed, putting {{both sides of the}} Space Race even at two orbital flights each. While the Soviets had flown for longer, the Mercury program was gaining momentum, with a six-orbit mission {{currently}} planned and press speculation about a one-day mission. However, in mid-August, the Soviet Union launched two orbital missions, Vostok 3 and Vostok 4, within a day of each other. The two craft were in intersecting orbits, but despite much speculation did not attempt to rendezvous; they completed missions of 64 and 48 orbits respectively, just under four and three days, landing within a few minutes of each other on August 15. This was far ahead of anything currently planned for Mercury, and NASA quickly considered the prospect of modifying <b>a</b> <b>capsule</b> to have an active manoeuvring and rendezvous capability, using technology being developed for the Gemini program. However, after examining the time and safety implications of this proposal, it was decided to abandon the idea and continue with the planned six-orbit mission.|$|E
5|$|The adult {{body has}} a {{hardened}} exoskeleton, {{except for the}} abdomen which is less sclerotised. The head is shaped like <b>a</b> <b>capsule</b> with appendages arising from it. Adult mouthparts include a prominent proboscis formed from maxillary galeae, and are adapted for sucking nectar. Some species do not feed as adults, and may have reduced mouthparts, while others have them modified for piercing and suck blood or fruit juices. Mandibles are absent in all except the Micropterigidae which have chewing mouthparts. Adult Lepidoptera have two immobile, multi-faceted compound eyes, and only two simple eyes or ocelli, which may be reduced. The three segments of the thorax are fused together. Antennae are prominent and besides the faculty of smell, act as olfactory radar, and also aid navigation, orientation and balance during flight. In moths, males frequently have more feathery antennae than females, for detecting the female pheromones at a distance. There are two pairs of membranous wings which arise from the mesothoracic (middle) and metathoracic (third) segments; they are usually completely covered by minute scales. The two wings on each side act as one by virtue of wing-locking mechanisms. In some groups, the females are flightless and have reduced wings. The abdomen has ten segments connected with movable inter-segmental membranes. The last segments of the abdomen form the external genitalia. The genitalia are complex and {{provide the basis for}} family identification and species discrimination.|$|E
5|$|The game {{takes place}} over six levels called zones. Each zone is {{split into two}} acts, in which the player must guide their {{selected}} character past enemies and obstacles such as spikes and bottomless pits to reach the end in under ten minutes. Scattered around acts are springboards, boost pads, and golden rings, which serve {{as a form of}} health; players survive hits {{as long as they have}} at least one ring, but their rings will scatter and disappear after a short period of time. Players can also collect canisters that contain power-ups such as speed shoes, elemental shields, and invincibility. The first act ends when players pass a signpost, while the second culminates in a boss fight with Eggman; after hitting him eight times, Eggman will flee and drop <b>a</b> <b>capsule</b> of captured animals. Each character starts the game with a limited number of lives, which are lost when the player is hit with no rings in their possession, is crushed, drowns, or falls in a bottomless pit. If the player loses all their lives, they will receive a game over.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{reports on}} the study of the {{behavior}} of the viscoelastic contact between <b>a</b> spiral-type <b>capsule</b> and the small intestine. Both 2 D and 3 D simulations show that the traction force, which is due to the pressure difference between {{the two sides of the}} spirals, is velocity dependent. With an increase in the sliding velocity, the traction force decreases initially due to the reduced stress relaxation. However, if the velocity reaches some certain magnitude, the reduction in the stress becomes negligibly small. The traction force starts to increase because of the higher stress coming from the higher strain rates. The experimental torque and force measurements were taken for the capsules with different cross-section profiles. The results show that the traction force can be raised by carving grooves on the spirals 2 ̆ 7 surface or using a higher and narrower spiral structure. The difference between the mechanical behaviors of <b>a</b> rotating-only <b>capsule</b> and <b>a</b> rotating-and-translating <b>capsule</b> were experimentally studied and explained in detail. The results show that <b>a</b> rotating-and-advancing <b>capsule</b> gets slightly more resistive torque than <b>a</b> rotating-only <b>capsule...</b>|$|R
