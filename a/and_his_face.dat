5|$|Invader works incognito, often masked {{and largely}} at night. To guard his {{anonymity}} on camera during interviews, he pixellates {{his own image}} or wears a mask as a disguise. He claims {{that only a few}} people know his real name <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>face,</b> and that his parents think he works as a tiler in the construction industry.|$|E
5|$|On 4 October 1943, Smith {{took off}} from Idku at dawn in a Hurricane Mk IIC to escort a {{shipping}} convoy. Light was extremely poor, and Smith's throttle malfunctioned; he failed to take off quickly enough to clear a blast wall {{at the end of}} the runway. The undercarriage of the aircraft scraped against some sandbags on the wall, causing Smith to lose control of the plane and crash. The shoulder straps on his harness, built to withstand stress of up to , snapped, <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>face</b> was smashed against the Hurricane's gyrosight. Smith suffered serious facial injuries, and broke his jaw, a leg and a shoulder. Doctors thought at first that his back had also been broken, but it had only been buckled.|$|E
5|$|The Manhattan Project {{became public}} {{knowledge}} after the bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, and Oppenheimer {{became a national}} spokesman for science who was emblematic of {{a new type of}} technocratic power. He became a household name <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>face</b> appeared on the covers of Life and Time. Nuclear physics became a powerful force as all governments of the world began to realize the strategic and political power that came with nuclear weapons. Like many scientists of his generation, he felt that security from atomic bombs would come only from a transnational organization such as the newly formed United Nations, which could institute a program to stifle a nuclear arms race.|$|E

5|$|The final mask to {{be gained}} in the game is the Fierce Deity's Mask. Although {{the use of this}} mask is {{strictly}} limited to boss battles only, it is possible to wear it anywhere using a glitch. Upon donning this mask, Link grows to nearly two-and-a-half times his normal height. His clothes turn white <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>face</b> appears with a type of war paint on it. The sword that Fierce Deity Link carries is a helix shape that uses magic power to shoot beams at enemies.|$|E
25|$|The foreigners visiting Muscovy {{were the}} first to notice the emblem's {{resemblance}} to the traditional iconography of Saint George and the Dragon. Although during Peter I's reign the horseman was still represented with a crown <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>face</b> bore some resemblance to Peter's, this Westernizing monarch was the first to identify the heraldic horseman as St. George.|$|E
25|$|Alexander {{was carried}} by sleigh to the Winter Palace to his study where {{almost the same}} day twenty years earlier, he had signed the Emancipation Edict freeing the serfs. Alexander was {{bleeding}} to death, with his legs torn away, his stomach ripped open, <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>face</b> mutilated. Members of the Romanov family came rushing to the scene.|$|E
6000|$|Then Sir Percival {{cried out}} in a loud voice, [...] "I am indeed Sir Percival!" [...] and with that he uplifted the umbril of <b>his</b> helmet <b>and</b> showed <b>his</b> <b>face.</b> So also Sir Lamorack (for that other knight was indeed he) uplifted the umbril of <b>his</b> helmet <b>and</b> showed <b>his</b> <b>face.</b>|$|R

25|$|Before {{he could}} be ordained a priest, Gabriel died in the retreat at Isola del Gran Sasso {{the early hours of}} February 27, 1862, in the {{presence}} of the community, holding close an image of Our Lady of Sorrows and smiling peacefully. Those who were with Gabriel when he died reported that at the moment of death, he sat up in bed <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>face</b> became radiant as he reached out to an otherwise unseen figure that was entering the room. It was the opinion of Father Norbert that Saint Gabriel had seen the Virgin Mary at the very moment of his death.|$|E
25|$|In late January 1942, the {{squadron}} became operational {{and joined the}} remnants of several others {{that had been in}} Malaya, operating out of RAF Seletar and RAF Kallang. During one of his first sorties, Gorton was involved in a brief dogfight over the South China Sea, after which he suffered engine failure and was forced to land on Bintan island, 40km (25mi) south east of Singapore. As he landed, one of the Hurricane's wheels hit an embankment and flipped over. Gorton was not properly strapped in <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>face</b> hit the gun sight and windscreen, mutilating his nose and breaking both cheekbones. He also suffered severe lacerations to both arms. He made {{his way out of the}} wreck and was rescued by members of the Royal Dutch East Indies Army, who provided some medical treatment. Gorton later claimed that his face was so badly cut and bruised, that a member of the RAF sent to collect him assumed he was near death, collected his personal effects and returned to Singapore without him. By chance, one week later, Sgt Matt O'Mara of No. 453 Squadron RAAF also crash landed on Bintan, and arranged for them to be collected.|$|E
25|$|After WrestleMania, Vince briefly {{made his}} second face run and Shane {{took control of}} the Corporation. With wrestlers such as Triple H in this new faction, Shane feuded with his father and a new faction made up of former Corporation members, The Union. On the UPN pilot for SmackDown!, Shane joined forces with The Undertaker and the Ministry of Darkness to form the Corporate Ministry. Eventually, Vince was {{revealed}} to be the mastermind behind this faction, <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>face</b> turn was explained to be a plot to get the WWF Championship off Austin. Austin then met Shane and Vince in a ladder match at the King of the Ring for ownership of the WWF, as in the storyline, Austin had 50%, which was assigned to him by Linda and Stephanie McMahon, upset by Vince and Shane's complicity in the storyline kidnapping of Stephanie by the Corporate Ministry, while Vince and Shane each had 25%. Shane and Vince won the match when a mystery associate raised the briefcase out of Austin's reach when he climbed the ladder, allowing Vince and Shane to grab the case and regain 100% ownership of the WWF.|$|E

25|$|In {{front of}} 14,623, {{far short of}} a sell-out, Mayweather won via TKO in the 10th round, surpassing Rocky Marciano and setting {{the record for the}} longest active unbeaten streak in a {{professional}} career at 50–0. In the opening round, Mayweather, as per previous fights, started slow to work out McGregor's tactics. In his post-fight interview, he revealed {{it was part of the}} game plan to let McGregor punch himself out in the early rounds. McGregor won the first round on all three judges scorecards, the same case could have been made for the opening three rounds. McGregor was warned a few times through the fight for hitting behind the head, but no points were deducted by referee Robert Byrd. By the fourth round, McGregor began to tire and breathe heavily with his mouth open. Mayweather started to take control and landed with his right hands. For the next few rounds, McGregor came out throwing shots in the opening 30 seconds, but immediately tired, giving Mayweather enough time to carry on landing clean shots and winning the rounds. By round 9, McGregor had almost nothing left. Although he didn't look hurt, he was very fatigued <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>face</b> started showing redness. Two of the judges scored the round 10–8 for Mayweather. In round 10, McGregor staggered across the ring and was in a bad way against the ropes as Mayweather landed some hard shots. With McGregor barely on his feet after a few unanswered punches, the referee waived the fight off. The time of stoppage was 1 minute and 5 seconds of round 10.|$|E

500|$|An unimpressed Alec sucks Presto's {{head into}} a {{ventilation}} pipe offstage, Presto (screaming painfully) removes the hat revealing his hair spiked <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>face</b> turned red. When Presto lunges at Alec through the hat, Alec directs Presto's {{hand into the}} podium's drawer and closes the drawer, painfully restraining the hand while he looks through Presto's sleeve for the carrot. Presto runs towards Alec, but instead is poked in both eyes by his own hand. Presto drops his hat, and when he grabs the wizard hat, he accidentally strips his slacks down to underwear, to Alec's amusement.|$|E

500|$|Light {{falls from}} the left, leaving traces of shadow {{on the side of}} the man's face, a device {{commonly}} found in vanEyck's early portraits. He is youthful, <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>face</b> has a soft fleshiness achieved through shallow curves and flowing, harmonious brushstrokes, giving the appearance of a relaxed, warm, and open personality, which Meiss describes as evoking an almost [...] "Rembrandtesque warmth and sympathy". The sitter is not handsome; he has a flattish face, a stubby yet pointed nose, and prominent cheekbones that might, according to Panofsky, belong to a [...] "Flemish peasant". Dhanens describes him as having an honest expression.|$|E
500|$|The first Belle Vue Circus {{took place}} in 1922, {{but it was not}} {{considered}} a success. The next was staged in 1929, after the company negotiated a deal with the Blackpool Tower Company to provide acts and equipment for what subsequently became a regular Christmas event held in the Kings Hall. One of the first arrivals from Blackpool was ringmaster George Lockhart, known as [...] "the prince of ringmasters". Lockhart became synonymous with the Belle Vue Circus, <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>face</b> was used on many advertising posters. Zoo superintendent Gerald Iles included some of the zoo's animals in the circus, in a feature called Noah's Ark.|$|E
500|$|Madonna's lover in {{the video}} is played by Croatian actor Goran Višnjić, who was {{selected}} by the singer after she saw his acting in the British film, Welcome to Sarajevo (1997). Calling him [...] "the sexiest male working today", Madonna explained that [...] " [...] was looking for an actor to be in [...] video <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>face</b> came right into my head". The video premiered on MTV on September 10, 1998, {{a few minutes before}} the 1998 MTV Video Music Awards show began. It was occasionally played on The Warner Bros.

500|$|Ruth {{made one}} final trip {{on behalf of}} American Legion Baseball, then entered Memorial Hospital, where he would die. He was never told he had cancer, but before his death, had surmised it. He was able to leave the {{hospital}} for a few short trips, including a final visit to Baltimore. On July 26, 1948, Ruth left the hospital to attend the premiere of the film The Babe Ruth Story. Shortly thereafter, Ruth returned to the hospital for the final time. He was barely able to speak. Ruth's condition gradually grew worse; only a few visitors were allowed to see him, one of whom was National League president and future Commissioner of Baseball Ford Frick. [...] "Ruth was so thin it was unbelievable. He had been such a big man and his arms were just skinny little bones, <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>face</b> was so haggard", Frick said years later.|$|E
500|$|In the Soviet Union, a cult of {{personality}} devoted to Lenin {{began to develop}} during his lifetime, but was only fully established after his death. According to historian Nina Tumarkin, it represented the world's [...] "most elaborate cult of a revolutionary leader" [...] since that of George Washington in the United States, and has been repeatedly described as [...] "quasi-religious" [...] in nature. Busts or statues of Lenin were erected in almost every village, <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>face</b> adorned postage stamps, crockery, posters, and {{the front pages of}} Soviet newspapers Pravda and Isvestia. The places where he had lived or stayed were converted into museums devoted to him. Libraries, streets, farms, museums, towns, and whole regions were named after him, with the city of Petrograd being renamed [...] "Leningrad" [...] in 1924, and his birthplace of Simbirsk becoming [...] "Ulyanovsk". The Order of Lenin was established as one of the country's highest decorations. All of this was contrary to Lenin's own desires, and was publicly criticised by his widow.|$|E
500|$|The Ganesha form worshipped here {{is called}} Girijatmaja (...) [...] The name is either {{interpreted}} as [...] "mountain-born" [...] or as [...] "Atmaja of Girija", {{the son of}} Parvati, who herself is daughter of the mountain Himavan, a personification of the mountains of Himalayas. The features of the Ganesha icon, seen on {{the back wall of}} the cave, are the least distinct vis-a-vis the other Ashtavinayak temples. Though the temple faces the inauspicious south, - according to a local tradition - the deity faces north, with his back to his worshipper <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>face</b> visible {{on the other side of}} the mountain. The Peshwa rulers even tried in vain to locate the face of Ganesha on the other side. The central icon was covered with brass-plated wooden armour, given as a gift by Junnar. Brahmins, The armour is not present currently. [...] After it was removed, Ganesha could be seen with his trunk turned to the left side, facing east, with one of his eyes visible. The icon is covered with sindoor and is directly formed/sculpted on the stone wall of the cave.|$|E
