5|$|Phillip Manning {{and colleagues}} (2009) {{attempted}} {{to test the}} function of the sickle claw and similarly shaped claws on the forelimbs.

For comparison, they <b>analyzed</b> <b>the</b> construction of a claw from a modern predatory bird, the eagle owl. They found that, based on the way that stress was conducted along the claw, they were ideal for climbing. The scientists found that the sharpened tip of the claw was a puncturing and gripping instrument, while the curved and expanded claw base helped transfer stress loads evenly.|$|E
