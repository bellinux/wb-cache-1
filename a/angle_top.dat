50|$|Although the {{flatland}} bicycle {{is similar}} to most other BMX bicycles, flatland is often performed with specially designed frames with geometry (head tube <b>angle,</b> <b>top</b> tube length, etc.) suited {{to the needs of}} flatlanders. Front and rear bolt-on pegs, a hollow compression bolt on the forks for the front brake cable, and a rear brake cable detangler or Gyro to allow the bars to rotate endlessly without tangling the brake cables. Also invented specifically for flatland riding is the rear hub mechanism known as a freecoaster, which allows the rear wheel to roll backwards without engaging the hub and making the cranks rotate backwards as they would on a normal freewheel or cassette style hub. Other technical bicycle setup specifics can include zero offset forks, narrow handlebars, very high pressure tires (100psi and higher), and a very small front sprocket (18-28 teeth).|$|E

40|$|Type B and Type A fissile drum {{packages}} {{are required to}} undergo {{a series of tests}} that simulate both normal conditions of transport (NCT) and hypothetical accident conditions (HAC) as specified in 10 CFR Part 71. In particular for HAC, it must be demonstrated that the package can withstand a 30 ft. drop in the most unfavorable orientation without damage that would compromise its ability to survive a subsequent regulatory fire test. Historically, it has usually been assumed that the most unfavorable orientations are those that allow the maximum amount of available kinetic energy to be used for package deformation. Therefore, drop test orientations have been mostly limited to Top-Down, Bottom-Down, Side, and C. G. Over Top-Corner. (Where C. G. refers to the center of gravity of the package.) Here, it is shown that shallow <b>angle</b> <b>top</b> impact, where a portion of the translational kinetic energy of the package is transformed into rotational kinetic energy at impact, may also be a likely orientation that will lead to failure of drum packages that use bolted ring closures...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Offset of a {{dynamically}} positioned {{drilling vessel}} from the setpoint location above the wellhead affects {{a number of}} operational parameters which influence {{the point at which}} a disconnect should be initiated. Factors establishing disconnect limits, among others, include bottom flex joint <b>angle,</b> <b>top</b> riser angle, slip joint strokeout, riser t nsioner strokeout, and riser/moonpool contact. For each of these parameters, the vessel x,y positions at which the physical disconnect limit is reached are variable {{over the course of a}} drilling operation. Furthermore, in an emergency situation, the speed at which the vessel is moving and the time it takes for execution of the disconnect sequence bears directly on the point in time when the disconnect should be initiated. Conventionally the bottom flex joint angle has been used as the determining disconnect parameter. With increasing water depth, either the surface slip joint strokeout or riser t nsioner strokeout will become the physical limit. Depending on a particular rig’s configuration, the existing weather conditions and/or drilling conditions, other equipment parameters may constitute the limiting factor. This paper discusses a real-time riser management system which continuously monitors vessel, drilling, and riser parameters and processes this information in combination with vessel and rise...|$|E

40|$|A {{comprehensive}} {{literature review}} {{into the current}} state of abrasive waterjet (AWJ) machining technologies and the associated sciences has been conducted. It has revealed that AWJ milling possesses many traits which are desired by industry. However, little research has been devoted to its development and understanding the underlying material removal mechanism behind the machining process. Performance of AWJ milling, in formation of channels into amorphous materials was first investigated through an experimental investigation on brittle glasses. Macro-mechanism analysis has shown that channels are formed through four distinct erosion zones, each exhibiting characteristics connected to erosion mechanism and behavior of fluid flow in that zone. Bulge formation as a long-standing challenge of AWJ milling (27 years challenge) has been resolved through an in-depth understanding of the mechanism involved in the process. The analysis has revealed that material removal features, such as: material removal rate (MRR), depth of cut, and wall inclination angle can be reasonably controlled through proper selection of process parameters. Predictive models for material removal rate and other significant performance measures of the process have been developed, and experimentally verified. In second part, an innovative low-impact-angle milling method has been developed for machining AMM laminations {{for the first time in}} history of AWJ machining. Delamination as a major challenge of machining has been successfully overcome by designing and manufacturing a proper fixture assembly. Macro-mechanism analysis has revealed that produced channels exhibited a symmetric trapezoid shape cross-section. The analysis has revealed that material removal features, such as: material removal rate (MRR), depth of cut, wall inclination <b>angle,</b> <b>top</b> and bottom channel width can be properly controlled through suitable selection of process parameters. Predictive models have been developed for MRR and other significant performance measures of the process. The models have been experimentally verified and found to be capable of giving adequate predictions for the major channel geometrical features. Multi-objective optimization of the process has been conducted using Grey Relational Analysis (GRA) based on an orthogonal array. Its outcomes have enabled us to optimize multi-performance characteristics, where MRR and depth of cut have been maximized, and channel wall inclination angle has been minimized. This study has abundantly demonstrated machining capabilities of AWJ milling. Analysis into material removal processes has provided an in-depth understanding of the physical science associated with the technology, while the predictive developed models serve as a valuable basis for future process planning to effectively use the technology. The multi-objective optimization has prepared the developed technology further for the industrial applications...|$|E
