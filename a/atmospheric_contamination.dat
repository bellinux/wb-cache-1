5|$|Gas {{tungsten}} {{arc welding}} (GTAW), {{also known as}} tungsten inert gas (TIG) welding, is an arc welding process that uses a non-consumable tungsten electrode to produce the weld.

40|$|We {{report on}} our {{investigations}} on the long-term behaviour of optical coatings under 193 nm laser irradiation in dependence on coating materials, radiation conditions, and substrate properties. A {{wide variety of}} different highly reflective dielectric mirrors and antireflective coatings, deposited by an ultra low loss evaporation process onto calcium fluoride and fused silica, has been tested. Irradiation experiments with highly reflective coatings show that fluoride coatings exhibit nearly no changes of their optical function in air {{as well as in}} argon atmosphere due to low initial absorption levels. Temporal <b>atmospheric</b> <b>contaminations</b> can be removed by using appropriate irradiation conditions. Oxide layers tend to post-oxidize during 193 nm exposure in air and the DUV absorption level will be reduced. Effectively, reflectance of multilayer coatings on the basis of oxide materials can be improved through laser irradiation. Irradiation experiments with antireflective coatings point out the dominant role of bulk and surface properties of the substrate for prolonged laser irradiation. In addition, we present laser induced damage thresholds to demonstrate upper limits of laser radiation resistance that can be achieved nowadays with several types of coatings...|$|R

500|$|Beyond {{the simple}} wear that check {{standards}} can experience, {{the mass of}} even the carefully stored national prototypes can drift relative to the IPK {{for a variety of}} reasons, some known and some unknown. Since the IPK and its replicas are stored in air (albeit under two or more nested bell jars), they gain mass through adsorption of <b>atmospheric</b> <b>contamination</b> onto their surfaces. Accordingly, they are cleaned in a process the BIPM developed between 1939 and 1946 known as [...] "the BIPM cleaning method" [...] that comprises firmly rubbing with a chamois soaked in equal parts ether and ethanol, followed by steam cleaning with bi-distilled water, and allowing the prototypes to settle for [...] days before verification. Before the BIPM's published report in 1994 detailing the relative change in mass of the prototypes, different standard bodies used different techniques to clean their prototypes. The NIST's practice before then was to soak and rinse its two prototypes first in benzene, then in ethanol, and to then clean them with a jet of bi-distilled water steam. Cleaning the prototypes removes between 5 and 60µg of contamination depending largely on the time elapsed since the last cleaning. Further, a second cleaning can remove up to 10µg more. After cleaning—even when they are stored under their bell jars—the IPK and its replicas immediately begin gaining mass again. The BIPM even developed a model of this gain and concluded that it averaged 1.11µg per month for the first 3 months after cleaning and then decreased to an average of about 1µg per year thereafter. Since check standards like K4 are not cleaned for routine calibrations of other mass standards—a precaution to minimize the potential for wear and handling damage—the BIPM's model of time-dependent mass gain has been used as an [...] "after cleaning" [...] correction factor.|$|E

2500|$|One of {{the most}} common types of arc welding is {{shielded}} metal arc welding (SMAW), which is also known as manual metal arc welding (MMAW) or stick welding. [...] An electric current is used to strike an arc between the base material and a consumable electrode rod or stick. [...] The electrode rod is made of a material that is compatible with the base material being welded and is covered with a flux that gives off vapors that serve as a shielding gas and provide a layer of slag, both of which protect the weld area from <b>atmospheric</b> <b>contamination.</b> [...] The electrode core itself acts as filler material, making a separate filler unnecessary. [...] The process is very versatile, requiring little operator training and inexpensive equipment. [...] However, weld times are rather slow, since the consumable electrodes must be frequently replaced and because slag, the residue from the flux, must be chipped away after welding. [...] Furthermore, the process is generally limited to welding ferrous materials, though specialty electrodes have made possible the welding of cast iron, nickel, aluminium, copper and other metals. The versatility of the method makes it popular in a number of applications including repair work and construction.|$|E

Bioaerosols may carry potentially hazardous microbes, viruses, fungi, allergens, and other toxic substances that may harm the dental operator, patient, and the dental assistant by causing nosocomial infections. Objective: To assess the level of <b>atmospheric</b> microbial <b>contamination</b> before, during, and after dental treatment procedures in the dental operatory of a mobile dental unit (MDU). Materials and Methods: The study included three treatment sessions on different working days, with an interval of one month. The MDU was fumigated {{before the start of the}} study.

Results: The results showed that <b>atmospheric</b> microbial <b>contamination</b> (CFUs/plate) was 4 times higher during working sessions as compared to the levels before the working sessions. At the end of the working day, aerosols decreased by almost 3 times that seen during work. Conclusion: The aerosols increased during and after work sessions.

40|$|Engineered TiO 2 {{nanoparticles}} (TiO 2 -NPs) {{are present}} in a large variety of consumer products, and are produced in largest amount. The building industry is a major sector using TiO 2 -NPs, especially in paints. The fate of NPs after their release in the environment is still largely unknown, and their possible transfer in plants and subsequent impacts have not been studied in detail. The foliar transfer pathway is even less understood than the root pathway. In this study, lettuces were exposed to pristine TiO 2 -NPs and aged paint leachate containing TiO 2 -NPs and microparticles (TiO 2 -MPs). Internalization and in situ speciation of Ti were investigated {{by a combination of}} microscopic and spectroscopic techniques. Not only TiO 2 -NPs pristine and from aged paints, but also TiO 2 -MPs were internalized in lettuce leaves, and observed in all types of tissues. No change in speciation was noticed, but an organic coating of TiO 2 -NPs is likely. Phytotoxicity markers were tested for plants exposed to pristine TiO 2 -NPs.
