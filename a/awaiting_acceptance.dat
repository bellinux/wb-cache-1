40|$|The {{engineering}} internship {{is designed}} to expose the final year student {{to the real world}} of engineering. This is done over a period of workplace employment in an area of relevant focus. The internship placement was undertaken at Motherwell Automation; a firm based in Perth, Western Australia. Motherwell specialise in the design and supply of industrial control systems. The affect and direction of staff within the company was absolutely pivotal {{to the success of the}} experience. Guidance was given on many aspects and focussed around a main project which was the Teras Barge Pumping System. The Teras barge is permanently moored at Barrow Island primarily to supply a construction site with fresh water. Currently the water is pumped from the barge to standpipes on land, and this task is handled by construction personnel who operate the existing pumps and pipe work manually. The internship project was to fully automate this operation. The solution is a solar powered PLC installation, designed to sit on the barge in a suitable enclosure. This controller will operate the pumps relative to a pressure reading from the pipes supplying the standpipes. This solution was derived for our client Theiss, to assist with their construction efforts on the Gorgon project for Chevron. The full design and construction phases were completed successfully.

40|$|The {{current study}} was {{developed}} to provide a database of relatively simple numerical simulations of protostellar collapse, as a template library for observations of cores and very young protostars, and for researchers who wish to test their chemical modeling under dynamic astrophysical conditions. It was also designed to identify statistical trends that may appear when running many models {{of the formation of}} low-mass stars by varying the initial conditions. A large set of 143 calculations of the gravitational collapse of an isolated sphere of gas with uniform temperature and a Bonnor-Ebert like density profile was undertaken using a 1 D fully implicit Lagrangian radiation hydrodynamics code. The parameter space covered initial masses from 0. 2 to 8 Msun, temperatures of 5 - 30 K and radii between 3000 and 30, 000 AU. A spread in the thermal evolutionary tracks of the runs was found, due to differing initial conditions and optical depths. Within less than an order of magnitude, all first and second Larson cores had masses and radii independent of the initial conditions. The time elapsed between the formation of the first and second cores was found to strongly depend on the first core mass accretion rate, and no first core in our grid of models lived for longer than 2000 years, before the onset of the second collapse. The end product of a protostellar cloud collapse, the second Larson core, is, at birth, a canonical object with a mass and radius of about 3 Mjup and 8 Rjup, independent of its initial conditions. The evolution sequence which brings the gas to stellar densities can however proceed in a variety of scenarios, on different timescales, along different isentropes, but each story line can largely be predicted by the initial conditions.

40|$|The {{decision-making}} process involving the decommissioning of the British graphile-moderated, gas-cooled Magnox power stations is complex. There are timing, engineering, waste disposal, cost and lost generation capacity factors {{and the ultimate}} uptake of radiation dose to consider and, bearing on all ojthese, the overall decision of {{when and how to}} proceed with decommissioning may be heavily weighed by political and public tolerance dimensions. These,factors and dimensions are briefly reviewed with reference to the ageing Maynox nuclear power stations, of which Berkeley and Hunterston A are now closed down and undergoing thefirst stages of decom-missioning and Trawsjynydd, althuuyh still considered as aoailahle capacity, has had both reactors closed down since February 1991 and is <b>awaiting</b> substantiation and <b>acceptance</b> of a revised reactor pressure vessel safety case. Although the other first-generation Magnox power stations at Hinkley Point, Bradwell, Dungeness and Sizewell are operational, it is most doubtful that these stations will he able to eke out a generating function,for much longer. It is concluded that the British nuclear industry has adopted a policy of deferred decommissioning, that is delaying the process of complete dismantlement of the radioactive components and assemblies for at least one hundred years following close-down of the plant. In following this option the nuclear industry has expressed considerable confidence that the decommissioning technology required will be developed with passing time, that arceptabfe radioactive waste disposal methods and facitities will be available and thut the eventual costs of decommissioning will not escalate without restraint. 1 THE DECOMMISSIONER’S DILEMM...|$|R

The Indian Navy evaluated the Electromagnetic Aircraft Launch System (EMALS), which is being used by the US Navy in their latest s. General Atomics, the developer of the EMALS, was cleared by the US government to give a technical demonstration to Indian Navy officers, who were impressed by the new capabilities of the system. The EMALS enables launching varied aircraft including unmanned combat air vehicles (UCAV). On 1 August 2013 Vice Admiral Robin K. Dhowan, while talking about the detailed study underway on the IAC-II project, said that nuclear propulsion was also being considered. This has since been finalized. The carrier was initially expected to enter service by the 2020's but latest reports (as on November 2016) suggests that it will enter service only by 2030 due to the technical challenges involved in assimilating and integrating several advanced technologies {{for the first time in}} an Indian carrier.

40|$|Whilst {{patients}} with ovarian cancer clearly benefit from centralised, comprehensive care in dedicated cancer centres, unfortunately {{the majority of}} them still do not receive appropriate specialist treatment. Any improvement in the accuracy of current triaging and referral pathways whether using new imaging tests or biomarkers would therefore be of value in order to optimise the appropriate selection of patients for such care (Chapter 1). An analysis of the current evidence shows that such diagnostic tests are now available, but still <b>await</b> recognition, <b>acceptance</b> and widespread adoption. It is therefore to be hoped that present guidance relating to the classification of ovarian masses will soon become more “evidence-based”. These include the International Ovarian Tumour Analysis (IOTA) LR 2 risk prediction model and ultrasound-based IOTA Simple Rules (SR) (Chapter 2). Based on a comprehensive recent meta-analysis both currently offer the optimal “evidence-based” approach to discriminating between cancer and benign conditions in women with adnexal tumours needing surgery (Chapter 3). The IOTA LR 2 risk model and SR are reliable diagnostic tests having been shown to maintain a high sensitivity for cancer after independent external validation and both temporal and external validation by the IOTA group in the hands of examiners with various levels of ultrasound expertise (Chapter 4 and 5). Both diagnostic approaches also offer more accurate triage compared to the current standard of care diagnostic test Risk of Malignancy Index (RMI). The development of the IOTA Assessment of Different NEoplasias in the AdneXa (ADNEX) multiclass risk prediction model represents an important step forward towards more individualised patient care in this area (Chapter 6). The ADNEX model is novel and enables the more specific subtyping of adnexal cancers (i. e. borderline tumours, stage 1 invasive ovarian cancer, stage II-IV invasive ovarian cancer, and secondary metastatic malignant tumours) and shares similar levels of accuracy to IOTA LR 2 and SR for basic discrimination between cancer and benign disease. Its use has the potential to further improve and fine-tune management decisions and so reduce the morbidity and mortality associated with adnexal pathology. Biomarkers are also attractive, popular and recommended tools to support clinical judgment of the nature of an adnexal mass. At present two novel commercial biomarkerbased algorithms have been developed in order to improve the poor accuracy of serum CA 125; the Multivariate Index Assay and the ROMA algorithm. The latter utilises levels of CA 125 and a new emerging epithelial biomarker human-epididymis-protein- 4 (HE 4) combined with the patient’s menopausal status to classify patients as at high or low risk for malignancy (Chapter 7). This test rapidly gained widespread attention, as evidenced by its numerous validation studies throughout the world. However, based on the findings of this thesis both commercial tests still seem redundant for preoperative diagnosis if good quality transvaginal ultrasonography (TVS) is available and the IOTA models are used in the correct manner (Chapter 3 and Chapter 7). TVS is accepted as the most appropriate initial imaging investigation to identify and characterise any mass if present in women suspected of having adnexal pathology (chapter 8). Other imaging modalities such as computed-tomography (CT) and [18 F]-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography ([18 F]-FDG-PET) both lack accuracy for preoperative diagnosis and are more useful tools for staging of malignant disease and the assessment of ovarian cancer recurrence. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) may have a limited role to play in characterising so-called “difficult masses” after ultrasound review. The IOTA prediction models and rules offer new criteria that we can use to clearly define complex or “difficult to classify” adnexal masses to focus the role for second-line imaging tests such as conventional MRI combined with dynamic contrastenhanced (DCE) or diffusion-weighted (DWI) sequences on masses where further tests other than ultrasonography would be of value to minimise healthcare costs (Chapter 8). The IOTA study has made significant progress in relation to the preoperative classification of adnexal masses, however what is now needed is to see if these or new diagnostic tools will have a positive influence on both clinical management and patient outcomes in true interventional studies; can assist clinicians to select {{patients with}} adnexal masses that are suitable for expectant management; and that will work in all health care settings (i. e. primary vs secondary vs tertiary care). The future agenda of the IOTA project will focus on these important themes (Chapter 9). status: publishe...|$|R
6000|$|There are two {{different}} modes of organizing a federal union. The federal authorities may represent the governments solely, and their acts may be obligatory only on the governments as such, or they may have the power of enacting laws and issuing orders which are binding directly on individual citizens. The former is the plan of the German so-called Confederation, and of the Swiss Constitution previous to 1847. It was tried in America {{for a few years}} immediately following the War of Independence. The other principle is that of the existing Constitution of the United States, and has been adopted within the last dozen years by the Swiss Confederacy. The Federal Congress of the American Union is a substantive part of the government of every individual state. Within the limits of its attributions, it makes laws which are obeyed by every citizen individually, executes them through its own officers, and enforces them by its own tribunals. This is the only principle which has been found, or which is ever likely to produce an effective federal government. A union between the governments only is a mere alliance, and subject to all the contingencies which render alliances precarious. If the acts of the President and of Congress were binding solely on the governments of New York, Virginia, or Pennsylvania, and could only be carried into effect through orders issued by those governments to officers appointed by them, under responsibility to their own courts of justice, no mandates of the federal government which were disagreeable to a local majority would ever be executed. Requisitions issued to a government have no other sanction or means of enforcement than war, and a federal army would have to be always in readiness to enforce the decrees of the federation against any recalcitrant state, subject to the probability that other states, sympathizing with the recusant, and perhaps sharing its sentiments on the particular point in dispute, would withhold their contingents, if not send them to fight in the ranks of the disobedient State. Such a federation {{is more likely to be}} a cause than a preventive of internal wars; and if such was not its effect in Switzerland until the events of the years immediately preceding 1847, it was only because the federal government felt its weakness so strongly that it hardly ever attempted to exercise any real authority. In America, the experiment of a federation on this principle broke down in the first few years of its existence, happily while the men of enlarged knowledge and acquired ascendancy who founded the independence of the Republic were still alive to guide it through the difficult transition. The [...] "Federalist," [...] a collection of papers by three of these eminent men, written in explanation and defense of the new federal Constitution while still <b>awaiting</b> the national <b>acceptance,</b> is even now the most instructive treatise we possess on federal government. In Germany, the more imperfect kind of federation, as all know, has not even answered the purpose of maintaining an alliance. It has never, in any European war, prevented single members of the confederation from allying themselves with foreign powers against the rest. Yet this is the only federation which seems possible among monarchical states. A king, who holds his power by inheritance, not by delegation, and who can not be deprived of it, nor made responsible to any one for its use, is not likely to renounce having a separate army, or to brook the exercise of sovereign authority over his own subjects, not through him, but directly by another power. To enable two or more countries under kingly government to be joined together in an effectual confederation, it seems necessary that they should all be under the same king. England and Scotland were a federation of this description during the interval of about a century between the union of the crowns and that of the Parliaments. Even this was effective, not through federal institutions, for none existed, but because the regal power in both Constitutions was so nearly absolute as to enable the foreign policy of both to be shaped according to a single will.|$|R
