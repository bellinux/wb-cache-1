5|$|Aigle was {{in action}} again on 22 March 1808 against two large, French frigates; Italienne of 40 guns and the 38-gun Sirene. A {{squadron}} comprising Aigle, the 32-gun frigate , the two seventy-fours Impétueux and , {{and two or}} three smaller vessels were anchored between the Glénan islands, whilst being resupplied by a transport convoy. At 15:45, two French frigates to the south-east were simultaneously seen from Aigle's masthead and by the British schooner , which was stationed midway between the squadron and the island of Groix. Aigle immediately gave chase, <b>and</b> <b>coming</b> within hailing distance at 19:30, Wolfe directed Cuckoo to relay to Impétueux and Narcissus, now following two miles behind, his intention to cut off the French ships by sailing between Groix and the mainland.|$|E
5|$|As Balch {{finished}} his formal education early, he compensated through self-improvement, even cycling to London to buy books. He {{is known for}} discovering new caving techniques and carefully recording his finds. Balch would spend his free time on Saturdays and after work on caving expeditions, although he would not do any caving on Sundays, for religious reasons. He would set out for some expeditions directly after work, caving overnight <b>and</b> <b>coming</b> home in time to wash before returning to work.|$|E
5|$|As the club's {{fortunes}} declined, {{they found}} themselves unable to attract many stars (Welsh international goalkeeper Jack Kelsey being a notable exception), while up <b>and</b> <b>coming</b> players such as David Herd left for more successful clubs. Jack Crayston and George Swindin, both former players, followed Whittaker but could not replicate his success. Apart from finishing third in 1958–59 and fifth in both 1955–56 and 1956–57, Arsenal usually finished in mid-table. Nor did the club have much luck in the FA Cup — after reaching the final in 1951–52, Arsenal would not get beyond the quarter-finals again until 1970–71. To make matters worse for the club, Tottenham Hotspur won the Double in 1960–61.|$|E

The field Iðavöllr exists where Asgard once was, and, there, untouched by Surtr's flames, Víðarr and Váli reside. Now possessing their father's hammer Mjölnir, Thor's sons Móði and Magni will meet them there, <b>and,</b> <b>coming</b> from Hel, Baldr and Höðr also arrive.

5|$|In general polling, Tancredo fared {{far worse}} than in straw polls. Early polls placed the {{candidate}} both {{above and below the}} 1% mark.

5|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that several imitation medallions and bracteates of the Migration Period (ca. first centuries AD) feature depictions of Hel. In particular the bracteates IK 14 and IK 124 depict a rider traveling down a slope <b>and</b> <b>coming</b> upon a female being holding a scepter or a staff. The downward slope may indicate that the rider is traveling towards the realm of the dead and the woman with the scepter may be a female ruler of that realm, corresponding to Hel.|$|E
5|$|Merle Haggard, Waylon Jennings, George Strait, and Willie Nelson are Black's biggest musical influences. His {{style is}} {{traditional}} country.

On his studio albums he plays acoustic and electric guitars as well as harmonica. In concert he plays primarily guitar, but does play drums and harmonica. Today, Clint Black is still an inspiration to new, up <b>and</b> <b>coming</b> country artists, as expressed by performers such as Jon Pardi and Aaron Watson.|$|E

5|$|Orwell wrote six novels: Burmese Days, A Clergyman's Daughter, Keep the Aspidistra Flying, Coming Up for Air, Animal Farm and Nineteen Eighty-Four. Most {{of these}} were semi-autobiographical.

Keep the Aspidistra Flying <b>and</b> <b>Coming</b> Up for Air are examinations of the British class system. Animal Farm and Nineteen Eighty-Four are his most famous novels: both are anti-totalitarian books which criticize the Soviet Union in particular.|$|E
