6000|$|III. Modes of self-love {{the passions}} we may call; 'Tis real good, or seeming, moves them all: But since not every good we can divide, And reason bids {{us for our}} own provide; Passions, though selfish, if their means be fair, List under Reason, and deserve her care; Those, that imparted, court a nobler aim, Exalt their kind, and take some virtue's name. [...] In lazy apathy let stoics boast Their virtue fixed; 'tis fixed as in a frost; Contracted all, {{retiring}} to the breast; But strength of mind is exercise, not rest: The rising tempest puts in act the soul, Parts it may ravage, but preserves the whole. On life's vast ocean diversely we sail, Reason the card, but passion is the gale; Nor God alone in the still calm we find, He mounts the storm, and walks upon the wind. [...] Passions, like elements, though born to fight, Yet, mixed and softened, in his work unite: These, 'tis enough to temper and employ; But what composes man, can man destroy? Suffice that Reason keep to Nature's road, Subject, compound them, follow her and God. Love, hope, and joy, fair pleasure's smiling train, Hate, fear, and grief, the family of pain, These mixed with art, and to due bounds confined, Make and maintain {{the balance of the}} mind; The lights and shades, whose well-accorded strife Gives all the strength and colour of our life. Pleasures are ever in our hands or eyes; And when in act they cease, in prospect rise: Present to grasp, and future still to find, The whole employ of body and of mind. All spread their charms, but charm not all alike; On different senses different objects strike; Hence different passions more or less inflame, As strong or weak, the organs of the frame; And hence once master passion in the breast, Like Aaron's serpent, swallows up the rest. [...] As man, perhaps, the moment of his breath Receives the lurking principle of death; The young disease that must subdue at length, Grows with his growth, and strengthens with his strength: So, cast and mingled with his very frame, The mind's disease, its ruling passion came; Each vital humour which should feed the whole, Soon flows to this, in body and in soul: Whatever warms the heart, or fills the head, As the mind opens, and its functions spread, Imagination plies her dangerous art, And pours it all upon the peccant part. [...] Nature its mother, habit is its nurse; Wit, spirit, faculties, but make it worse; Reason itself but gives it edge and power; As Heaven's blest beam turns vinegar more sour. [...] We, wretched subjects, though to lawful sway, In this weak queen some favourite still obey: Ah! if she lend not arms, as well as rules, What can she more than tell us we are fools? Teach us to mourn our nature, not to mend, A sharp accuser, but a helpless friend! Or from a judge turn pleader, to persuade The choice we make, or justify it made; Proud of an easy conquest all along, She but removes weak passions for the strong; So, when small humours gather to a gout, The doctor fancies he has driven them out. [...] Yes, Nature's road must ever be preferred; Reason is here no guide, but still a guard: 'Tis hers to rectify, not overthrow, And treat this passion more as friend than foe: A mightier power the strong direction sends, And several men impels to several ends: Like varying winds, by other passions tossed, This drives them constant to a certain coast. Let power or knowledge, gold or glory, please, Or (oft more strong than all) the love of ease; Through life 'tis followed, even at life's expense; The merchant's toil, the sage's indolence, The monk's humility, the hero's pride, All, all alike, find reason on their side. [...] The eternal art, educing good from ill, Grafts on this passion our best principle: 'Tis thus the mercury of man is fixed, Strong grows the virtue with his nature mixed; The dross cements what else were too refined, And in one interest body acts with mind. [...] As fruits, ungrateful to the planter's care, On savage stocks inserted, learn to bear; The surest virtues thus from passions shoot, Wild nature's vigour working at the root. What crops of wit and honesty appear From spleen, from obstinacy, hate, or fear! See anger, zeal and fortitude supply; Even avarice, prudence; sloth, philosophy; Lust, through some certain strainers well refined, Is gentle love, and charms all womankind; Envy, to which th' ignoble mind's a slave, Is emulation in the learned or brave; Nor virtue, male or female, can we name, But what will grow on pride, or grow on shame. [...] Thus Nature gives us (let it check our pride) The virtue nearest to our vice allied: Reason the bias turns to good from ill And Nero reigns a Titus, if he will. The fiery soul abhorred in Catiline, In Decius charms, in Curtius is divine: The same ambition can destroy or save, And makes a patriot as it makes a knave. [...] This light and darkness in our chaos joined, What shall divide? The God within the mind. [...] Extremes in nature equal ends produce, In man they join to some mysterious use; Though each by turns the other's bound invade, As, in some well-wrought picture, light and shade, And oft so mix, the difference is too nice Where ends the virtue or begins the vice. [...] Fools! who from hence into the notion fall, That vice or virtue there is none at all. If white and black blend, soften, and unite A thousand ways, is there no black or white? Ask your own heart, and nothing is so plain; 'Tis to mistake them, costs the time and pain. [...] Vice is a monster of so frightful mien, As, to be hated, needs but to be seen; Yet seen too oft, familiar with her face, We first endure, then pity, then embrace. But where th' extreme of vice, was ne'er agreed: Ask where's the north? at York, 'tis on the Tweed; In Scotland, at the Orcades; and there, At Greenland, Zembla, or the Lord knows where. No creature owns it in the first degree, But thinks his neighbour farther gone than he; Even those who dwell beneath its very zone, Or never feel the rage, or never own; What happier nations shrink at with affright, The hard inhabitant contends is right. [...] Virtuous and vicious every man must be, Few in th' extreme, but all in the degree, The rogue and fool by fits is fair and wise; And even the best, by fits, what they despise. 'Tis but by parts we follow good or ill; For, vice or virtue, self directs it still; Each individual seeks a several goal; But Heaven's great view is one, and that the whole. That counter-works each folly and caprice; That disappoints th' effect of every vice; That, happy frailties to all ranks applied, Shame to the virgin, to the matron pride, Fear to the statesman, rashness to the chief, To kings presumption, and to crowds belief: That, virtue's ends from vanity can raise, Which seeks no interest, no reward but praise; And build on wants, and on defects of mind, The joy, the peace, the glory of mankind. [...] Heaven forming each on other to depend, A master, or a servant, or a friend, Bids each on other for <b>assistance</b> <b>call,</b> Till one man's weakness grows the strength of all. Wants, frailties, passions, closer still ally The common interest, or endear the tie. To these we owe true friendship, love sincere, Each home-felt joy that life inherits here; Yet from the same we learn, in its decline, Those joys, those loves, those interests to resign; Taught half by reason, half by mere decay, To welcome death, and calmly pass away. [...] Whate'er the passion, knowledge, fame, or pelf, Not one will change his neighbour with himself. The learned is happy nature to explore, The fool is happy that he knows no more; The rich is happy in the plenty given, The poor contents him with the care of Heaven. See the blind beggar dance, the cripple sing, The sot a hero, lunatic a king; The starving chemist in his golden views Supremely blest, the poet in his muse. [...] See some strange comfort every state attend, And pride bestowed on all, a common friend; See some fit passion every age supply, Hope travels through, nor quits us when we die. [...] Behold the child, by Nature's kindly law, Pleased with a rattle, tickled with a straw: Some livelier plaything gives his youth delight, A little louder, but as empty quite: Scarves, garters, gold, amuse his riper stage, And beads and prayer-books are the toys of age: Pleased with this bauble still, as that before; Till tired he sleeps, and life's poor play is o'er. [...] Meanwhile opinion gilds with varying rays Those painted clouds that beautify our days; Each want of happiness by hope supplied, And each vacuity of sense by pride: These build as fast as knowledge can destroy; In folly's cup still laughs the bubble, joy; One prospect lost, another still we gain; And not a vanity is given in vain; Even mean self-love becomes, by force divine, The scale to measure others' wants by thine. See! and confess, one comfort still must rise, 'Tis this, though man's a fool, yet God is wise.|$|E

The experimental results presented here were collected through Wizard-of-Oz experiments as feasibility precursors to speech recognition automation. Speech interfaces were clearly superior to Touch-Tone in one experiment (PREVIU), with caller participation increasing by 30 %. In another experiment (Money Talks), speech recognition interfaces did not improve caller participation and, in fact, provided no advantages over Touch-Tone automation. A number of prompting strategies have been identified as advantageous in increasing caller participation and compliance in automated services. Ultimately, success with speech automated services will rely on identifying the services most suitable for speech automation and then carefully crafting the user interface. 1...|$|E

Department of TelematicsCatalà: Les necessitats sanitàries evolucionen de manera constant; algunes d?aquestes necessitats ja estan cobertes per la tecnologia actual entre que altres encara no. Aquesta tesi ofereix una anàlisi crítica de la recerca {{existent}} en temes de ICT i hospitals, avaluant les necessitats dels hospitals des d'un punt de vista de comunicacions i examinant les alternatives mes rellevants per proporcionar comunicacions sense fil en un entorn sanitari. També es proporciona un anàlisi del sistema d'avis {{a personal}} sanitari que actualment s'està fent servir a l'hospital de St. Olav (Trondheim, Noruega), així com diverses opcions per a refer-lo amb altres tecnologies. El sistema abans esmentat ha estat totalment caracteritzat i modelat emprant UML 2. 3 i la versió resultant ha estat discutida amb detall. Dues noves funcionalitats que podrien millorar la satisfacció dels usuaris han estat identificades (trucada d'assistència i pausa per dinar) i incloses de manera que les modificacions fetes al sistema han quedat minimitzades per tal de facilitar una possible implementació en el sistema existent a l'hospital de St. Olav. Una qüestió que queda per resoldre son els endarreriments: ja que totes les opcions per comunicacions sense fils analitzades els tenen (de 20 segons a 2 minuts, depenent de la tecnologia), la qual cosa els fa poc adients per situacions d'emergència on el temps es primordial. De totes maneres això no significa que no tinguin cap utilitat, simplement que cal un altre sistema de comunicacions per les situacions abans esmentades, que podria ser emprat per complimentar el sistema sense fils afegint-hi un nivell de redundància.

The loans were a particularly strong incentive to marry after extramarital pregnancy had occurred.|$|R
