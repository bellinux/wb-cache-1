The Government Service Insurance System (GSIS) was given the mandate {{to form a new}} subsidiary corporation that would restore, renovate, and expand the Manila Hotel. In the following two decades, Mr. Marcos's wife, Imelda, could frequently be seen at the hotel restaurants. During her visits, a red carpet and garlands were put out <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>air</b> <b>was</b> sprayed with deodorant. Under Imelda's patronage, the hotel reaped international recognition and awards. It was the place to go and be seen during the martial law years.|$|E
5|$|The region's {{precipitation}} pattern is bimodal, meaning agriculture is sustained through snowfall during winter and autumn and rainfall during spring and summer. The climate is semi-arid. Water for farming and consumption {{was provided by}} summer rains, winter snowfall, and seeps and springs in and near the Mesa Verde villages. At , the middle mesa areas were typically ten degrees Fahrenheit (5.5°C) cooler than the mesa top, which reduced {{the amount of water}} needed for farming. The cliff dwellings were built to take advantage of solar energy. The angle of the sun in winter warmed the masonry of the cliff dwellings, warm breezes blew from the valley, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>air</b> <b>was</b> ten to twenty degrees warmer in the canyon alcoves than {{on the top of the}} mesa. In the summer, with the sun high overhead, much of the village was protected from direct sunlight in the high cliff dwellings.|$|E

United States Air Force planes measured central pressure, air temperature, and humidity in the eye pressures using dropsondes.

2500|$|In {{the early}} 1830s, a few fur trappers from the Pacific Northwest {{exploring}} southwards into the San Joaquin Valley arrived {{just in time}} to be greeted with a sight of horror. An epidemic of smallpox and malaria brought unintentionally by the Europeans had swept down the San Joaquin River corridor during the summer of 1833, killing in a single stroke between 50 and 75 percent of the entire native population in the valley. The outbreak did not vanish; it continued year after year with diminishing acuteness until about 50,000–60,000 indigenous people lay dead. Explorer Kit Carson noted in 1839 that [...] "…cholera or some other fearful scourge broke out among them and raged with such fearful fatality that they were unable either to bury or burn their dead, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>air</b> <b>was</b> filled with the stench of their decaying bodies." ...|$|E
2500|$|Compared to the Fifth Test against New Zealand at the [...] in 1958 England {{made only}} two changes to their team. Willie Watson {{had only just}} {{recovered}} from his knee operation and was replaced as the number three batsman by the in form Tom Graveney. Fred Trueman was laid low by lumbago, which also affected him {{when he arrived in}} Queensland in 1962–63, and was replaced by Peter Loader even though he had just recovered from a strained [...] Achilles tendon and high temperature. Loader, Laker, Lock and Statham had taken plenty of wickets on tour and Graveney and captain Peter May had made the most runs. Australia also had two changes from their last team, the Fifth Test against South Africa at [...] in 1957–58. Captain Ian Craig had resigned due to ill-health and was replaced by the debutant strokemaker Norm O'Neill and Peter Burge replaced Bobby Simpson, who was twelfth man. Australia did not recall the veteran Ray Lindwall even though he had taken 7/73 for Queensland against the MCC and had swung the ball prodigiously. After vice-captain Neil Harvey captained an Australian XI to a 345 run defeat against the MCC the selectors made the surprise choice of Richie Benaud as Australian captain. He had just succeeded Craig as the captain of New South Wales, but had yet to lead his state. There was a thunderstorm before the match which precluded net practise <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>air</b> <b>was</b> heavy, which made the loss of Trueman's swing bowling all the more meaningful.|$|E
2500|$|The wicket was greener {{than usual}} for the Melbourne Cricket Ground <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>air</b> <b>was</b> heavy again, the dark clouds dimming the ground, but the pitch was not {{expected}} to last and when Peter May won the toss on his 29th birthday (New Year's Eve) he had to bat first even though his opening batsmen {{were known to be}} brittle. They survived into the third over when [...] "Davo" [...] Davidson (6/64) wrecked the innings with three wickets; Peter Richardson caught by Wally Grout for 3, Willie Watson undone by a yorker on his fourth ball and Tom Graveney for a golden duck by a brute of a ball that swung viciously and caught him leg before wicket. Peter May came in at 7/3 to survive the hat-trick and rebuild the innings, bringing up his first runs with a magnificent drive off Meckiff. Davidson bowled neatly and made the ball move, but [...] "Meckiff used the whole bowling crease, delivering balls from near the stumps and as wide as possible to the return crease" [...] and could find no swing. Fortunately for England Trevor Bailey was full of confidence and [...] hit 6 fours in {{two and a half hours}} on his way to 48. Ken Mackay replaced Meckiff and almost had May caught in the slips, and Richie Benaud who replaced him missed a caught and bowled with his first delivery, but Davidson was kept on until lunch, when he was exhausted. They returned after lunch and the crowd saw the unprecedented sight of [...] "The Boil" [...] hitting Benaud for successive boundaries, but he was caught by the Australian captain off a slower ball from Meckiff, who had finally replaced Davidson and England were 92/4. Colin Cowdrey came in low at number 6 and stuck in for another do or die partnership with May, both playing disciplined innings with classical strokes. With Neil Harvey and Norm O'Neill dominating the covers runs were hard to come by and they ended the day on 173/4. Benaud delayed asking for the new ball as his fast bowlers were tired and May and Cowdrey attacked the slow bowling, particularly that of Lindsay Kline. The captain reached his century by pulling Kline to the mid-wicket boundary and hitting the next ball with such power that Mackay, 50 yards away, did not have time to move before it flew past him for another four. It was the first Test hundred by an English captain in Australia since Archie MacLaren made 116 in the [...] at Sydney in 1901–02. The new ball was now taken with England 206/4 and Davidson and Meckiff returned to the attack, Meckiff (3/69) bowling May for 113 with an extra fast delivery that swung in and crashed into his stumps. Meckiff reckoned this to be the best ball he ever bowled [...] "the sun was shining, and May was batting beautifully at the time. Yet he explained it later that he had completed lost the ball from the instant it left the hand". Godfrey Evans (4) could not cope with Meckiff's pace and Cowdrey (44) was caught by Grout off Davidson and England collapsed to 218/7. Jim Laker (dropped off his first ball) stayed in for over an hour making 22 not out, but Davidson bowled Brian Statham and Peter Loader and they were all out for 259.|$|E
