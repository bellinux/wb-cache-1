5|$|SRI {{researchers}} {{made the}} first observation of visible light emitted by oxygen atoms in the night-side <b>airglow</b> of Venus, offering new insight into the planet's atmosphere. SRI education researchers conducted the first national evaluation of the growing U.S. charter schools movement. For the World Golf Foundation, SRI compiled the first-ever estimate of the overall scope of the U.S. golf industry's goods and services ($62 billion in 2000), providing a framework for monitoring the long-term growth of the industry. In April 2000, SRI formed Atomic Tangerine, an independent consulting firm designed to bring new technologies and services to market.|$|E
5|$|One {{of the key}} aims of {{the astronomers}} who {{designed}} the Hubble Space Telescope was to use its high optical resolution to study distant galaxies {{to a level of}} detail that was not possible from the ground. Positioned above the atmosphere, Hubble avoids atmospheric <b>airglow</b> allowing it to take more sensitive visible and ultraviolet light images than can be obtained with seeing-limited ground-based telescopes (when good adaptive optics correction at visible wavelengths becomes possible, 10m ground-based telescopes may become competitive). Although the telescope's mirror suffered from spherical aberration when the telescope was launched in 1990, it could still be used to take images of more distant galaxies than had previously been obtainable. Because light takes billions of years to reach Earth from very distant galaxies, we see them as they were billions of years ago; thus, extending the scope of such research to increasingly distant galaxies allows {{a better understanding of how}} they evolve.|$|E

LAC can also observe night <b>airglows</b> by continuously recording the brightness along swaths scanned by the attitude maneuver or the orbital motion of the spacecraft.|$|R
30|$|In the thermosphere, a large {{pressure}} {{difference between the}} dayside and the nightside leads to a subsolar-to-antisolar circulation (Bougher et al., 1997). The shift of the brightest regions of night <b>airglows</b> toward the dawn suggests that the thermospheric circulation {{is a combination of}} a subsolar-to-antisolar flow and a super-rotation (Allen et al., 1992). Seiff (1982) suggested that the subsolar-to-antisolar flow would become supersonic if only the acceleration by the pressure gradient force is considered, and that the observed flow speed of ∼ 100 ms− 1 suggests a deceleration by wave-induced drag. The strengths of the subsolar-to-antisolar flow and super-rotation change from time to time; the observed variability of the distribution of <b>airglows</b> indicates the variability of the thermospheric circulation (Crisp et al, 1996; Ohtsuki et al., 2008), which might be due to the variability in the momentum deposition by gravity waves. A comparative study of the thermospheric circulation and the lower atmosphere circulation will offer clues to the question why zonal circulation dominates in the lower atmosphere in such a slowly-rotating planet.|$|R
30|$|In the {{lightning}} observation mode, individual lightning flashes are sampled at 32 kHz by pre-triggering. Lightning flashes with an intensity of 1 / 100 of typical terrestrial lightning would be detected {{when viewed from}} 1000 km altitude. For mapping <b>airglows,</b> the Venusian nightside is scanned by changing {{the direction of the}} FOV. The detector’s one pixel corresponds to 35 km resolution on the Venusian surface viewed from 1000 km altitude, and 850 km resolution from 3 Rv altitude.|$|R
25|$|Measuring {{the effect}} of sky glow {{on a global scale}} is a complex procedure. The natural {{atmosphere}} is not completely dark, {{even in the absence of}} terrestrial sources of light and illumination from the Moon. This is caused by two main sources: <b>airglow</b> and scattered light.|$|E
25|$|The {{amount of}} <b>airglow</b> and zodiacal light is quite {{variable}} (depending, amongst {{other things on}} sunspot activity and the Solar cycle) but given optimal conditions the darkest possible sky has a brightness of about 22 magnitude/square arcsecond. If a full moon is present, the sky brightness increases to about 18 magnitude/sq. arcsecond depending on local atmospheric transparency, 40 times brighter than the darkest sky. In densely populated areas a sky brightness of 17 magnitude/sq. arcsecond is not uncommon, or as much as 100 times brighter than is natural.|$|E
25|$|At high altitudes, {{primarily}} {{above the}} mesosphere, {{there is enough}} UV radiation from the sun of very short wavelength to cause ionization. When the ions collide with electrically neutral particles they recombine and emit photons in the process, causing <b>airglow.</b> The degree of ionization is sufficiently large to allow a constant emission of radiation even during the night when the upper atmosphere is in the Earth's shadow. Lower in the atmosphere all of the solar photons with energies above the ionization potential of N2 and O2 have already been absorbed by the higher layers and thus no appreciable ionization occurs.|$|E
40|$|The {{discovery}} of transient <b>airglows</b> above thunderstorms, known as sprites and jets, have shed a fresh {{new light on}} a 'terra incognita' in the Earth's atmosphere, the area above thunderstorms. The fast discovery pace of novel phenomena has spurred studies of energetic radiation, relativistic particles and anti-matter emanating from inside thunderclouds and above thunderlcouds. These observations mark a profound advance {{in our understanding of}} the Earth's atmospheric electrodynamic behaviour. Namely, the discoveries mandate the inclusion of cosmic rays, relativistic electron beams, large scales, and energetic feedback processes in our thinking about the Earth's atmosphere, perhaps best collectively summarised as relativistic atmospheric electrodynamics...|$|R

The three-dimensional structure of the atmosphere and its dynamics will be studied with the combination of five multi-wavelength cameras and radio occultation. The atmosphere below the cloud top is probed by two near-infrared cameras by utilizing the near-infrared windows. The cloud top is covered by an ultraviolet camera and an infrared camera. Lightning flashes and night <b>airglows</b> are also observed by a dedicated sensor.|$|R
40|$|The {{aeronomy}} {{group at}} the University of Pittsburgh is actively engaged {{in a series of}} coordinated satellite, sounding rocket, and laboratory studies designed to expand and clarify knowledge of the physics and chemistry of planetary atmospheres. Three major discoveries have been made that will lead ultimately to a complete and dramatic revision of our ideas on the ionospheres of Mars, Venus, and the Earth and on the origin of their vacuum ultraviolet <b>airglows.</b> The results have already suggested a new generation of ionosphere studies which probably can be carried out best by laser heterodyning techniques. Laboratory studies have also identified, for the first time, the physical mechanism responsible for the remarkable nitric oxide buildup observed in some auroral arcs. This development is an important break-through in auroral physics, and has military ramifications of considerable interest to the Department of Defense. This work may also shed some light on related NO and atomic nitrogen problems in the mesosphere...|$|R
25|$|Meanwhile, Alice {{characterized}} the atmosphere, both by emissions of atmospheric molecules (<b>airglow),</b> and by dimming of background stars {{as they pass}} behind Pluto (occultation). During and after closest approach, SWAP and PEPSSI sampled the high atmosphere {{and its effects on}} the solar wind. VBSDC searched for dust, inferring meteoroid collision rates and any invisible rings. REX performed active and passive radio science. The communications dish on Earth measured the disappearance and reappearance of the radio occultation signal as the probe flew by behind Pluto. The results resolved Pluto's diameter (by their timing) and atmospheric density and composition (by their weakening and strengthening pattern). (Alice can perform similar occultations, using sunlight instead of radio beacons.) Previous missions had the spacecraft transmit through the atmosphere, to Earth ("downlink"). Pluto's mass and mass distribution were evaluated by the gravitational tug on the spacecraft. As the spacecraft speeds up and slows down, the radio signal exhibited a Doppler shift. The Doppler shift was measured by comparison with the ultrastable oscillator in the communications electronics.|$|E

500|$|Despite the Voyager data, {{evidence}} for a tenuous oxygen atmosphere (exosphere) on Ganymede, {{very similar to the}} one found on Europa, was found by the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) in 1995. HST actually observed <b>airglow</b> of atomic oxygen in the far-ultraviolet at the wavelengths 130.4nm and 135.6nm. Such an <b>airglow</b> is excited when molecular oxygen is dissociated by electron impacts, which is evidence of a significant neutral atmosphere composed predominantly of O2 molecules. The surface number density probably lies in the [...] range, corresponding to the surface pressure of [...] These values are in agreement with the Voyagers upper limit set in 1981. The oxygen is not evidence of life; it is thought to be produced when water ice on Ganymede's surface is split into hydrogen and oxygen by radiation, with the hydrogen then being more rapidly lost due to its low atomic mass. The <b>airglow</b> observed over Ganymede is not spatially homogeneous like that over Europa. HST observed two bright spots located in the northern and southern hemispheres, near ± 50° latitude, which is exactly the boundary between the open and closed field lines of the Ganymedian magnetosphere (see below). The bright spots are probably polar auroras, caused by plasma precipitation along the open field lines.|$|E

Comparisons of WINDII temperatures measured during magnetically quiet days with temperatures obtained by the MSIS- 90 and DTM- 94 thermospheric models show a 100 K bias. We demonstrate, however, that the modeled temperature variations represent very well the mean temperature variation observed by WINDII over 4 years. We also show that the observed latitudinal/local time variation is in very good agreement with the two empirical models.

The SPICAM climatology is one of the longest assembled to date by an instrument in orbit around Mars, offering the opportunity to study the fate of major volatile species in the Martian atmosphere over a multi-(Mars) year timeframe. With his dual ultraviolet (UV) -near Infrared channels, SPICAM observes spectral ranges encompassing signatures created by a variety atmospheric gases, from major (CO 2) to trace species (H 2 O, O 3). Here, we present a synthesis of the observations collected for water vapor, ozone, clouds and dust, carbon dioxide, exospheric hydrogen and <b>airglows.</b> The assembled climatology covers the MY 27 to MY 31 period. However, the monitoring of UV-derived species was interrupted at the end of 2014 (MY 30) due to failure of the UV channel. A SO 2 detection attempt was undertaken, but proved unsuccessful from regional to global scales (with upper limit greater than already published ones). One particular conclusion that stands out from this overview work concerns the way the Martian atmosphere organizes an efficient mass transfer between the lower and the upper atmospheric reservoirs. This highway to space, as we name it, is best illustrated by water and hydrogen, both species having been monitored by SPICAM in their respective atmospheric reservoir.
