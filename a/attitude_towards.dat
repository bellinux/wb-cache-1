Through a hierarchical values-attitudes model, the paper examines {{the degree to}} which <b>attitudes</b> <b>towards</b> green food is determined by consumers’ values and their general <b>attitudes</b> <b>towards</b> environment and nature and technological progress. The link between collectivism, <b>attitudes</b> <b>towards</b> environment and nature, and <b>attitudes</b> <b>towards</b> green food is the strongest link of the hierarchical model. However, collectivism also influences <b>attitudes</b> <b>towards</b> technological progress, which in turn influence <b>attitudes</b> <b>towards</b> green food. This finding, coupled with the lack of significant relationship between individualism and <b>attitudes</b> <b>towards</b> technological progress point towards the conclusion that the belief of Chinese people that technology is a positive determinant of food safety and environmental friendliness in food production steams from altruistic predispositions, which in turn influence (positively) Chinese consumers’ <b>attitudes</b> <b>towards</b> technology.

40|$|Despite much {{research}} into vegetarianism, the psychological relationship between eating meat and evaluating animals remains relatively neglected. Through focus groups, questionnaires and experiments, {{this study investigated}} whether people experienced psychological inconsistency in this relationship and, if so, how they handled that inconsistency. Unlike vegetarians' attitudes, the content of meat-eaters' <b>attitudes</b> <b>towards</b> eating meat rarely included animals. Meat-eaters' positive <b>attitudes</b> <b>towards</b> eating meat were consistent with their eating behaviour; however, their <b>attitudes</b> <b>towards</b> farm animals were more positive than their <b>attitudes</b> <b>towards</b> eating meat. It therefore depends upon which attitudes are salient {{at any given time}} to determine whether psychological consistency is maximised overall. By focusing on the relationship between their own genuinely-held <b>attitudes</b> <b>towards</b> farm animals, animals' slaughter, and eating meat, meat-eaters' cognitive dissonance increased. Their <b>attitudes</b> <b>towards</b> eating meat were expected to become more positive in order to restore consonance between their attitudes and eating behaviour. However, meat-eaters' <b>attitudes</b> <b>towards</b> eating meat became less positive and their <b>attitudes</b> <b>towards</b> animals' slaughter became more negative. In contrast, their <b>attitudes</b> <b>towards</b> farm animals resisted change. Therefore meat-eaters' <b>attitudes</b> <b>towards</b> farm animals became relatively even more positive than their <b>attitudes</b> <b>towards</b> eating meat and animals' slaughter. Hence, the attitudes stimulated by this research, in an environment which prevented psychological denial strategies, caused (a) meat eaters' attitudes to become more inconsistent with their behaviour and (b) the consequent lack of consonance restoration. This study both helps to understand the empirical relationship between eating meat and evaluating animals and extends cognitive dissonance theory's explanatory power to real-world complex phenomena...|$|R

Semantic differential scales were used to evaluate explicit <b>attitudes</b> <b>towards</b> GM foods. As expected, explicit <b>attitudes</b> <b>towards</b> GM foods were found to be neutral. However, contrary to our hypotheses, participants were found to hold positive, rather than neutral, implicit <b>attitudes</b> <b>towards</b> GM foods when these were assessed in a context free manner. In addition, neutral implicit attitudes were found when attitudes were assessed in the context of ordinary or organic foods, again contrasting with our hypotheses. These results imply that implicit <b>attitudes</b> <b>towards</b> GM food are more positive than anticipated and may lead to approach behaviour towards such products. Thus, given the choice, consumers are likely to accept GM food although other incentives may be needed if alternative foods are available...|$|R

Design: This study {{is part of a}} wider longitudinal study that will evaluate student radiographer <b>attitudes</b> <b>towards</b> the older patient as they progress through their training. In this phase an educational intervention, aimed at improving student radiographer <b>attitudes</b> <b>towards</b> the older person, was designed and implemented.

Method: A total of 236 individuals, of whom 118 were adolescents and 118 were elders (111 males and 125 females), completed the NEO Five Factor Inventory and the Peace Attitudes Scale. In this study, hierarchical regression analysis were used in order to determine which personality traits predicts peace attitudes. In order to investigate the associations of the <b>attitudes</b> <b>towards</b> peace with gender and different age groups, independent t-test methods were used.
