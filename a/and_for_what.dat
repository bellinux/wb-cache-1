5|$|After {{percutaneous}} coronary interventions (PCIs), such as {{the placement}} of a coronary artery stent, a U.S. Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality guideline recommends that aspirin be taken indefinitely. Frequently, aspirin is combined with an ADP receptor inhibitor, such as clopidogrel, prasugrel, or ticagrelor to prevent blood clots. This is called dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT). United States and European Union guidelines disagree somewhat about how long, <b>and</b> <b>for</b> <b>what</b> indications this combined therapy should be continued after surgery. U.S. guidelines recommend DAPT for at least 12 months, while EU guidelines recommend DAPT for 6–12 months after a drug-eluting stent placement. However, they agree that aspirin be continued indefinitely after DAPT is complete.|$|E
5|$|In San Francisco, {{particularly}} in the Castro District, gay community activists such as Bill Kraus and Cleve Jones found a new direction in gay rights when so many men came down with strange illnesses in 1980. The San Francisco Department of Public Health began tracing the disease, linked it to certain sexual practices, and made recommendations—stop having sex—to gay men to avoid getting sick, a directive that defied the chief reason why many gay men had migrated to the Castro, <b>and</b> <b>for</b> <b>what</b> gay rights activists in San Francisco had fought for years. Kraus and Jones often found themselves fighting a two-fronted battle: against city politicians who would rather not deal with a disease that affected gay men, who were seen as an undesirable population, and the gay men themselves, who refused to listen to doomsday projections and continued their unsafe behavior.|$|E

They justified these choices by arguing that Beowulf acts as an unreliable narrator in {{the portion of the}} poem in which he describes his battle with Grendel's mother. These choices also helped them to better connect the third act to the second of their screenplay, which is divided in the poem by a 50-year gap.|$|E
25|$|Some natural {{questions}} are: {{under what}} circumstances does this formalism work, <b>and</b> <b>for</b> <b>what</b> operators L are expansions in series of other operators like this possible?

How do the formalisms for infinite-dimensional spaces and finite-dimensional spaces differ, or do they differ? Can these ideas be extended to a broader class of spaces? Answering such questions is the realm of spectral theory and requires considerable background in functional analysis and matrix algebra.|$|E

25|$|The Hawaiian {{sovereignty}} movement, {{which generally}} views {{the overthrow of}} Kingdom of Hawaii in 1893 and its subsequent annexation by the United States as illegal, seeks some form of greater autonomy for Hawaii, such as free association or independence from the United States. Some groups also advocate some form of redress from the United States for the 1893 overthrow of Queen Liliuokalani, <b>and</b> <b>for</b> <b>what</b> {{is described as a}} prolonged military occupation beginning with the 1898 annexation. The Apology Resolution passed by US Congress in 1993 cited as a major impetus by the movement for Hawaiian sovereignty. The sovereignty movement considers Hawaii to be an illegally occupied nation.|$|E
25|$|As is {{the case}} when {{collecting}} and handling evidence, documentation of the source, transfer, and state of said entomological evidence is crucial to a criminal investigation. An accurate record facilitates the tracking of individual pieces of evidence even if the item has been modified after the initial collection; modification can result by means of natural biological processes, like metamorphosis, or the manipulation of the insects by the lab during analysis. Accurate documentation also helps preserve the chain of custody for the evidence collected; it accounts for a detailed record of who has {{had access to the}} evidence, and the exact times and locations of when the evidence was moved <b>and</b> <b>for</b> <b>what</b> reason. It basically provides a step-by-step ranging from the time of collection to the court hearings.|$|E
25|$|Accelerators are {{a form of}} selection-based search {{which allow}} a user to invoke an online service from any other page using only the mouse. Actions such as {{selecting}} the text or other objects will give users access to the usable Accelerator services (such as blogging with the selected text, or viewing a map of a selected geographical location), which can then be invoked with the selected object. According to Microsoft, Accelerators eliminate the need to copy and paste content between web pages. IE8 specifies an XML-based encoding which allows a web application or web service to be invoked as an Accelerator service. How the service will be invoked <b>and</b> <b>for</b> <b>what</b> categories of content it will show up are specified in the XML file. Similarities have been drawn between Accelerators and the controversial Smart tags feature experimented with in the IE 6 Beta but withdrawn after criticism (though later included in MS Office).|$|E

25|$|In 1968, Lopez-De La Cruz ran {{the first}} UFW hiring hall {{which was built}} next to the De La Cruz home. She {{collected}} membership dues, printed announcements for rallies, and distributed groceries that were donated by churches, social agencies, and private citizens. Lopez-De La Cruz also assisted farmworkers by translating for them, taking them to the doctors, writing letters, and filling out paperwork for {{those who could not}} write. In addition to her work protesting, organizing, and running the hiring hall; Lopez-De La Cruz acted as an interpreter for farm workers and often testified at hearings on farm labor, pushed for food stamps for farm workers in Fresno, pushed for bilingual education, and was eventually appointed to community and state organizations like the Fresno County Economic Opportunity Commission, the Central California Action Associates (Community education project where she taught English to Farm workers), and California’s Commission on the Status of Women. In 1966 Lopez-De La Cruz volunteered to teach farm workers practical English at the CCAA in an old building on Olive Avenue in Fresno, CA. When the CCAA got a local TV show on Fresno’s Channel 53, Lopez-De La Cruz enthusiastically taught English on the show for a short period that ended when Arnold’s truck broke down. Lopez-De La Cruz also assisted the UFW by consulting as an expert farmworker. In 1971, Delores Huerta reached out to Lopez-De La Cruz to help her negotiate a contract with Christian Brothers Wine Company. Since she was a farm worker and Huerta was not, Lopez-De La Cruz could accurately know how much work was acceptable <b>and</b> <b>for</b> <b>what</b> pay. In 1972 she represented the Christian Brothers Workers at the first convention of the United Farm Workers of America in Fresno.|$|E
