First, in infrared remote sensing methodology the radiation emanates {{from the top}} [...] "skin" [...] of the ocean, approximately the top 0.01 mm or less, which may not represent the bulk temperature of the upper meter of ocean due primarily to effects of solar surface heating during the daytime, reflected radiation, as well as sensible heat loss and surface evaporation. All these factors make it somewhat difficult to compare satellite data to measurements from buoys or shipboard methods, complicating ground truth efforts.

50|$|A {{limb sounder}} {{looks at the}} edge of the {{atmosphere}} where it is visible above the Earth. It does this in one of two ways: either it tracks the sun, moon, a star, or another transmitting satellite through the limb as the source gets occultated behind the Earth, or it looks towards empty space, collecting radiation that is scattered from one of these sources. In contrast, a nadir-looking <b>atmospheric</b> <b>sounder</b> looks down through the atmosphere at the surface. The SCIAMACHY instrument operates in all three of these modes.|$|E
50|$|The primary payload of {{the flight}} was the Atmospheric Laboratory for Applications and Science-2 (ATLAS-2), {{designed}} {{to collect data on}} the relationship between the sun's energy output and Earth's middle atmosphere and how these factors affect the ozone layer.

Atmospheric instruments included the Atmospheric Trace Molecule Spectroscopy (ATMOS) experiment, the Millimeter Wave <b>Atmospheric</b> <b>Sounder</b> (MAS), and the Shuttle Solar Backscatter Ultraviolet/A (SSBUV/A) spectrometer (on the cargo bay wall).

The LASA <b>atmospheric</b> <b>sounder</b> will sample the spatial distribution of several atmospheric parameters. The retroranging component will be used to determine the precise three-dimensional position of specifically placed retro-reflectors and to sense how these retro-reflectors change position over monthly to yearly time periods.
