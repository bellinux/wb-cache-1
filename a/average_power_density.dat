One of the major advantages of the LIBS technique is its ability to depth profile a specimen by repeatedly discharging the laser in the same position, effectively going deeper into the specimen with each shot. This can also be applied to the removal of surface contamination, where the laser is discharged a number of times prior to the analysing shot. LIBS is also a very rapid technique giving results within seconds, making it particularly useful for high volume analyses or on-line industrial monitoring.|$|E

40|$|A {{conceptual}} {{device for}} the direct conversion of heat into electricity is presented. This concept hybridizes thermionic (TI) and thermophotovoltaic (TPV) energy conversion {{in a single}} thermionic-photovoltaic (TIPV) solid-state device. This device transforms into electricity both the electron and photon fluxes emitted by an incandescent surface. This letter presents an idealized analysis of this device {{in order to determine}} its theoretical potential. According to this analysis, the key advantage of this converter, with respect to either TPV or TI, is the higher <b>power</b> <b>density</b> in an extended temperature range. For low temperatures, TIPV performs like TPV due to the negligible electron flux. On the contrary, for high temperatures, TIPV performs like TI due to the great enhancement of the electron flux, which overshadows the photon flux contribution. At the intermediate temperatures, 1650 K in the case of this particular study, I show that the <b>power</b> <b>density</b> potential of TIPV converter is twice as great as that of TPV and TI.

Results: results of this study show that in the near field, with increase of distance from the foot of antenna, the <b>average</b> <b>power</b> <b>density</b> of electromagnetic waves increase in a way that in the distance of 10 meters from the antenna foot, the increase of <b>average</b> <b>power</b> <b>density</b> is hardly conceivable and from 10 to 15 meters distance is perfectly noticeable.

40|$|It is {{well-known}} that {{spatial and temporal}} variations in <b>power</b> <b>density</b> within a processor core creates thermal hot spots where the temperatures can exceed 100 C.

As a result, estimating the worst-case peak temperature for a given processor workload is an important problem. This report presents an algorithm to estimate the worst-case peak temperature for a given real-time workload in a multi-core system. The challenge is to find the worst-case arrival pattern for the given real-time workload that results in the maximum peak temperature when the tasks are executed using a work-conserving scheduler. The proposed algorithm improves a solution from literature by relaxing some of its restrictive assumptions. In the cases where the assumptions are satisfied, the estimates from the proposed algorithm and the scheme from literature are the same. In all other cases, the estimates from the proposed algorithm are much less conservative and hence, more accurately estimate the achievable worst-case temperature...|$|R
