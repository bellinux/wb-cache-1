40|$|ABSTRACT Nowadays Chemical-Biological-Radiological-Nuclear (CRBN) {{risks are}} one of the main safety concern. The {{radiological}} disasters of Fukushima and Chernobyl, the chemical events of Seveso or the release of Sarin in the Tokio Subway,and the biological emergencies such as the H 1 N 1 flue represent few examples of a dreadful evidence: : CBRNe risks are a real and global threat around us. A CBRNe event can be either of an intentional and un-intentional nature and {{it is important to have}} highly specialized advisors that can support decision makers and first responders to face this threat. The University of Rome Tor Vergata, in collaboration with the most important Italian and International Bodies that work in the field of CBRN safety and security and supported by NATO and OPCW, organized two International Master Courses in Protection against CBRN events. In this context, a Table Top Exercise (TTX) was organized, in collaboration with the Ministry of Interior and Ministry of Defence, taking into account that, in each country, the system response to CBRNe events strongly depends also on law and procedures, that enforce the advisors and first responders to rely with different skills and roles in function of the <b>administration</b> <b>of</b> <b>origin.</b> The organized TTX was aimed to test the level preparation of the Master students and experts working in Italy in the field of CBRN events and to test the emergency planning preparation. In particular, a radiological release was simulated in a Harbour facility in Urban Area. The students were divided in multidisciplinary groups with heterogeneous competences. Each group was supported by CBRNì experts and was stressed by the injects from a Command and Operative Centre. Responsiveness to the injects and to the stress together with the ability to organize and manage safety and security operations, but also to interpret each role in the team according to according to national laws, were evaluated for each group. The scenario, the logistic organization, on-going adjustments during the exercise and the outcomes will be presented and analyzed by the authors in this paper. PRELIMINARY INDEX 1. Abstract 2.

At {{the time of this}} publication, WASP- 14 was the third system known to have a significant spin-orbit misalignment, and all three systems had super- Jupiter planets and eccentric orbits. Therefore we hypothesized that the migration and subsequent orbital evolution of massive, eccentric exoplanets is somehow different from that of less massive close-in Jupiters, the majority of which have well-aligned orbits.

30|$|According to the World Trade Organization (WTO) Agreement on Rules <b>of</b> <b>Origin,</b> when a good is {{produced}} {{by more than one}} country, the country <b>of</b> <b>origin</b> is the “country where the last substantial transformation has been carried out”. Although WTO member countries agreed that for goods not wholly obtained in one country the criterion for determining the country <b>of</b> <b>origin</b> is the last substantial transformation, the detailed rules for conferring the originating status may vary from country to country when a product is manufactured partially or entirely from non-original (foreign) material. For the same product, the country <b>of</b> <b>origin</b> may be the country where the primary material was produced or where the final processing was carried out, depending on the rules <b>of</b> <b>origin</b> <b>of</b> the importing country. For example, if shrimps are raised in country A and then shelled and frozen in country B, the country <b>of</b> <b>origin</b> <b>of</b> shelled and frozen shrimps is country A under the laws of the USA (USA 2004) because there is no substantial transformation in country B. In contrast, the country <b>of</b> <b>origin</b> <b>of</b> shelled and frozen shrimps is country B according to the regulations of the People’s Republic of China, which has rules for recognising a substantial transformation in country B (The Regulation of the People’s Republic of China on the Rules <b>of</b> <b>Origin</b> for the Goods Imported and Exported 2004; China’s General <b>Administration</b> <b>of</b> Customs 2004).|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{review the}} {{clinical}} and experimental {{data concerning the}} serious neurologic adverse events, and more particularly seizures, which {{could be related to}} the <b>administration</b> <b>of</b> recent antibiotics, with special reference to cephalosporins, monobactams, carbapenems, and fluoroquinolones. DATA SOURCES: We have searched in the MEDLINE database over the years 1966 - 1998 the pertinent publications dealing with antibiotics related neurotoxicity. We used the thesaurus function and the following key words: antibiotics, neurotoxicity, seizures. Additional references were found in the articles sorted by the MEDLINE search. DATA SYNTHESIS: Neurotoxic manifestations following antibiotics administration are infrequently encountered under usual conditions. Experimental studies are helpful to demonstrate that these compounds might interact with a major component of the neurotransmission, the gamma aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptor complex. Structure-toxicity relationships can be described. For the clinician, the recognition of some predisposing factors related either to the patient (age, previous central nervous system disorder [...] .) or to the drug metabolism (reduced renal clearance, drug interactions [...] .) may help to minimise the risk of adverse neurologic manifestations. Several factors have {{to be taken into account}} before assessing causality: delay from <b>administration,</b> evolution, <b>origin</b> <b>of</b> the adverse event (risk factors, other drugs, non pharmacological <b>origin),</b> possibility <b>of</b> rechallenge, confirmation by biological testing or in vitro experiments [...] . ...|$|R

40|$|Background Ethnoveterinary {{knowledge}} in Europe may {{play an important}} role as a basis for sustainable treatment options for livestock. Aims of our study were (a) to compare the ethnoveterinary practices of two culturally and sociodemographically different regions of Switzerland, (b) to compare results with earlier ethnoveterinary studies conducted in Switzerland and in adjacent Italian regions and, (c) to evaluate possible reasons for regional differences in European ethnoveterinary medicine. Methods 25 interviews were conducted in 2014 in all Italian speaking regions (ItR) of Switzerland, and 31 interviews were held in five north-western German speaking Cantons (GeC). Semi-structured questionnaires were used to collect detailed information regarding plant species, mode of preparation, dosage, route <b>of</b> <b>administration,</b> category <b>of</b> use, <b>origin</b> <b>of</b> knowledge, frequency of use, and satisfaction with outcomes of the treatments. Results A total of 162 homemade remedies in ItR and 219 in GeC were reported, out of which 125 and 145, respectively, were reported to contain only one plant species (homemade single species herbal remedy report, HSHR). 44 ItR and 43 GeC plant species were reported to treat livestock, of which only a half were used in both regions.
