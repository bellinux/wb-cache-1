25|$|Diversions off Hayfork Creek {{have only}} furthered the {{pollution}} problem by concentrating it. Logging and road-building {{are the two}} primary negative factors affecting the South Fork mainstem. Clearing hillsides has <b>accelerated</b> <b>erosion,</b> clouding the water and causing difficulties for steelhead trout and chinook salmon, which once spawned in the river in prodigious numbers. Although logging has mostly ceased since the designation of the national forest, the landscape has not yet fully recovered from its impacts.|$|E
25|$|The Salisbury Plain chalk massif {{is part of}} {{a system}} of chalk downlands {{throughout}} eastern and southern England formed by the rocks of the Chalk Group; the landscape is underlain by a combination of Lower, Middle and Upper Chalk supporting shallow well drained calcareous silty soils over chalk on slopes and crests. Escarpments are often formed where layers of chalk have been compressed to form a fold, or where the chalk has been faulted, resulting in <b>accelerated</b> <b>erosion</b> along the line of the weakness.|$|E

5000|$|Dredging and {{channelization}} have profoundly altered riverine habitats nationwide. Channelization physically changes streams by <b>accelerating</b> <b>erosion,</b> reducing depths, decreasing habitat diversity, destabilizing stream bottoms {{and removing}} riparian vegetation.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. According {{to the old}} bridge damaged {{emergency}} conversion program, {{this study}} investigates the flow changes during the coexistence {{of old and new}} bridge and contraction effect. The flow rate between piers increasing, thereby <b>accelerating</b> <b>erosion.</b> This study uses SMS- 2 D unsteady flow model to simulate old pier into the pre-construction setting due to their contraction flows and further necessary hydraulic structures and facilities for temporary protection during bridge construction against <b>accelerating</b> <b>erosion</b> for CheCheng Bridge in PenTung country, Taiwan as case study, thus, providing reliable information and references for bridge engineers...|$|R
50|$|The beach crest {{is at risk}} {{of being}} eroded (breached), which will result in the {{flooding}} of the backshore areas. The <b>accelerated</b> <b>erosion</b> at this site appears to be direct result of aggregate mining. Accretion to the coastline is occurring at another location near Tabontebike.|$|E
50|$|The project {{involves}} the Conservancy, National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS), the Conservation League Foundation and the Californian American Water company (CalAm) {{working together to}} remove the San Clemente Dam. Since the dams construction in 1921, the Carmel River has suffered from <b>accelerated</b> <b>erosion,</b> and the once vibrant steelhead trout run has dramatically decreased.|$|E
50|$|The Australian Government {{released}} a detailed {{report on the}} impacts of climate change on coastal areas of Australia, finding that up to 247,600 houses are at risk from flooding from a sea-level rise of 1.1 metres. There were 39,000 buildings located within 110 metres of 'soft' erodible shorelines, at risk from <b>accelerated</b> <b>erosion</b> due to sea -level rise.|$|E
50|$|Groynes and breakwaters {{that run}} {{perpendicular}} to the shore protect it from erosion. Filling a breakwater with imported sand can stop the breakwater from trapping sand from the littoral stream (the ocean running along the shore.) Otherwise the breakwater may deprive downstream beaches of sand and <b>accelerate</b> <b>erosion</b> there.|$|R
50|$|A {{revetment}} {{is similar}} to a seawall but usually consists of boulders piled at the base of cliffs. While it is less likely to <b>accelerate</b> <b>erosion</b> to either side, the area in front of a revetment may suffer. Sediment that would normally have been deposited on the beach instead bounces off the rocks and is dispersed elsewhere.|$|R
5000|$|Poor {{land use}} practices, dredging, {{intensive}} timber harvests, highway construction, {{and other activities}} <b>accelerate</b> <b>erosion</b> and increase sedimentation. Sediment that blankets a river bottom can suffocate mussels since they cannot move to avoid the impact. Also, large amounts of sediment {{in the water column}} reduce the ability of mussels to remove food and oxygen, which can lead to reduced growth, reproduction and survival.|$|R
50|$|The {{underlying}} geology at {{the site}} is Cretaceous Upper Chalk, supporting shallow well drained calcareous silty soils over chalk on slopes and crests. Typically these landscapes may be described as 'dramatic', due to their local scale, visual aesthetic and undulating nature. Escarpments are often formed where layers of chalk have been compressed to form a fold, or where the chalk has been faulted, resulting in <b>accelerated</b> <b>erosion</b> {{along the line of}} the weakness.|$|E
50|$|The bedrock in the {{watershed}} of North Branch Mehoopany Creek consists entirely of sandstone. The Arnot-Oquaga-Dystrochrepts soil association occurs between North Branch Mehoopany Creek and Mehoopany Creek. In the 2000s, <b>accelerated</b> <b>erosion</b> of streambanks and lateral shifting were identified at five locations on North Branch Mehoopany Creek. This {{was caused by}} man-made alterations after Tropical Storm Agnes in 1972 and other flooding events, as well as dredging in the creek. Remedying this would reduce the sediment load of Mehoopany Creek.|$|E
50|$|Many {{parts of}} Maiana suffer from coastal erosion, with {{the villages of}} Tekaranga and Tematantongo being {{particularly}} affected. Drought is another serious concern as the island's limited freshwater supply comes entirely from the shallow freshwater lens, which becomes salty close to the coast especially during drought periods. Like all of the atolls of Kiribati, Maiana is at serious risk from sea level rise, as even small changes in sea level can cause <b>accelerated</b> <b>erosion</b> and threaten infrastructure, agriculture and water supplies.|$|E
50|$|A seawall {{works by}} {{reflecting}} incident wave energy {{back into the}} sea, thus reducing the energy available to cause erosion. Sea walls have two specific weaknesses. First, wave reflection from the wall may result in scour and subsequent lowering of the sand level of the fronting beach. Second, sea walls may <b>accelerate</b> <b>erosion</b> of adjacent, unprotected coastal areas because they affect the littoral drift process.|$|R
50|$|Before European settlement, Aborigines burnt the {{grassland}} {{regularly for}} thousands of years and eventually native animals became dependent on the grasslands and the regular burning. When Europeans settled the area in the early 19th century, their ignorance lead to the destruction of the grassland through lack of regular burning. Thus the grasslands were swallowed up by woody weeds and shrub, degrading the soil, <b>accelerating</b> <b>erosion</b> and reducing the biodiversity.|$|R
25|$|In {{the design}} of a dam the energy of the fast-flowing stream over a {{spillway}} must be partially dissipated to prevent erosion of the streambed downstream of the spillway, which could ultimately lead to failure of the dam. This can be done by arranging for the formation of a hydraulic jump to dissipate energy. To limit damage, this hydraulic jump normally occurs on an apron engineered to withstand hydraulic forces and to prevent local cavitation and other phenomena which <b>accelerate</b> <b>erosion.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Another {{structure}} proposed is a seawall. A seawall is {{a concrete}} wall placed against {{the base of}} bluffs or sea cliffs that runs parallel to the ocean. While a sea wall {{may appear to be}} stopping erosion, a seawall can only diffuse wave energy which means that the areas {{on either side of the}} wall are likely to experience <b>accelerated</b> <b>erosion.</b> Again, this is not desired as the UCSB mesa might be adversely affected. A fourth type of structure is a revetment.|$|E
50|$|Elevation {{ranges from}} 0 to 400 m above sea level.The terrain has {{isolated}} plateaus, mostly around 200 to 300 m in height, within a flat coastal plain.Removal {{of the original}} forest cover has caused <b>accelerated</b> <b>erosion</b> of the plateaus.The reserve is in the basin of the Una River, which is fed by the Aliança and São Pedro rivers. The Serra River runs through the reserve from the west to the south east.The Maruim River forms the natural border of the north west of the reserve.|$|E

40|$|<b>Accelerated</b> soil <b>erosion</b> is {{a common}} and {{environmentally}} destructive consequence of development, especially in mountain regions. Soil erosion is of special concern in agricultural lands, but agriculture {{is only one of}} many development activities that greatly <b>accelerates</b> soil <b>erosion</b> processes. Road building, trail use, excavation, extractive activities, and construction also can cause severe soil erosion.

50|$|In 1953 {{the size}} of the village was roughly 54 acres but due to <b>accelerating</b> <b>erosion</b> activity, the village is {{currently}} at 27 acres. Due to the dramatic loss of land, Kivalina residents chosen a relocation site, an area known as Kiniktuuraq, about two miles southeast of the current location. Before relocating Kivalina residents are finding out that the new site may be prone to flooding. It has not been mentioned that the flooding will be attributed to climate change in the case.|$|R
50|$|At their maximum extent, {{the glaciers}} {{extended}} from the summit down to between 3200 and 3800 m of elevation. A small body of permafrost, less than 25 m across, was found at the summit of Mauna Kea prior to 1974, and may still be present. Small gullies etch the summit, formed by rain- and snow-fed streams that flow only during winter melt and rain showers.On the windward side of the mountain, stream erosion driven by trade winds has <b>accelerated</b> <b>erosion</b> {{in a manner similar}} to that on older Kohala.|$|E
50|$|One of Shirahama’s main attractions is its {{crescent-shaped}} white-sand beach; “Shirahama” means “white beach” or “white bay”. In the 1960s, when Shirahama {{was connected}} by rail to Osaka, the city became a popular tourist destination, particularly with honeymooners, and blocky white hotel towers were erected along the coastal road. The increased development <b>accelerated</b> <b>erosion,</b> {{and the famous}} sand began to wash into the sea. Worried that the town of White Beach would lose its white beach, according to a city official, Wakayama Prefecture began in 1989 to import sand from Perth, Australia, 4,700 miles away. 745,000 cubic meters was imported over 15 years.|$|E
50|$|A cattle {{path through}} the forest {{formerly}} crossed the fossil tracks and caused <b>accelerated</b> <b>erosion</b> at that point, but since 2001 the vegetation around the tracks has been cleared away and the exposed rock protected by fencing. The tracks were initially {{thought to have been}} made by prehistoric elephants but when Paolo Mietto and two other researchers from the University of Padua investigated them, they were surprised to find that the tracks were of hominid origin. It is very rare to find preserved hominid footprints in open-air environments, where they are vulnerable to erosion; most examples are found in enclosed and thus better protected environments such as caves.|$|E
50|$|Islands may {{disappear}} {{when the}} currents on the reef change. Maldivians call this phenomenon of erosion giramun dhiyun. New islands also may appear, beginning as sandbanks or coral gravel heaps at another {{location of the}} reef (a phenomenon that is known among Maldivians as vodemun dhiyun). Therefore, in the Maldives, islands are constantly eroding and constantly being formed. Human action, {{in the form of}} jetties or the dredging of channels on the reef, may change the pattern of currents on the reef and <b>accelerate</b> <b>erosion.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{species that}} most affects Zostera novazalendica, is the endemic Macrophthalmus hirtipes species. It {{is a small}} crab, which burrows in 63% of patches on average and feeds on the blades, basal sheaths, {{rhizomes}} and roots. The species relies on the Zostera novazalendica for 30% to 50% of its diet, {{while the rest of}} its diet is from invertebrates. The crabs also deteriorate the patch edges and <b>accelerate</b> <b>erosion</b> by burrowing around the edges and consequently reducing binding of seagrass roots, and creating a loss of soil.|$|R
40|$|Erosional {{convergent}} margins, where {{material is}} removed {{from the base of the}} upper plate and subducted on the lower plate, are fundamental features of the Circum Pacific. The erosional Middle America Trench convergent Pacific margin, remarkable for its broad diversity of dynamic environments, is a natural laboratory for studying convergent margin processes and seismogenesis. These environments include a shallow and deep trench axis, shallow-to-steep-dipping plate interfaces, abnormally hot-to-cold subducting plate temperatures, and a subducting plate with smooth morphology bordering basement ridges and seamounts. The subducting topography <b>accelerates</b> <b>erosion</b> and localizes seismicity...|$|R
50|$|A study {{published}} in 2006 found that human activity in the municipality of Chapadinha had caused serious problems, particularly projects to produce soybeans.Deforestation to clear land for agriculture had <b>accelerated</b> <b>erosion</b> of the banks and siltation of the river.Subsistence agriculture had caused chemicals to be washed into the river, contaminating the bed.Dredging to remove sand and gravel for sale in nearby towns made the water muddy and oily.In October 2014 a public hearing was held on extraction of sand from the Munim River bed. State Representative Bira do Pindaré reported on the hearing to the legislature, including the finding that a company was extracting sand illegally in the municipality of Presidente Juscelino.|$|E
5000|$|Meander {{formation}} {{is a result}} of natural factors and processes. The waveform configuration of a stream is constantly changing. Fluid flows around a bend in a vortex. Once a channel begins to follow a sinusoidal path, the amplitude and concavity of the loops increase dramatically due to the effect of helical flow sweeping dense eroded material towards the inside of the bend, and leaving the outside of the bend unprotected and therefore vulnerable to <b>accelerated</b> <b>erosion,</b> forming a positive feedback loop. In the words of Elizabeth A. Wood:‘…this process of making meanders seems to be a self-intensifying process…in which greater curvature results in more erosion of the bank, which results in greater curvature…’ ...|$|E
50|$|Without nearby bare soil, {{or natural}} {{drainage}} channels or culverts, hardscape with an impervious surface requires artificial methods of drainage or surface runoff {{to carry off}} the water that would normally be absorbed into the ground as groundwater and prevent premature wear to itself. Lack of capacity, or poorly planned or executed drainage or grading of the surface can cause problems after severe storms or heavy extended periods of rain fall, such as flooding, washout, mud flows, sink holes, <b>accelerated</b> <b>erosion,</b> wet rot to wood elements, drowning of plants trees and shrubs and even foundation problems to an adjacent home like cracking the foundation, basement flooding due to water infiltration, pest infiltration like ants and other insects entering through damaged areas.|$|E
50|$|PERC {{engages in}} {{research}} and advocacy related to free-market environmentalism and is active on issues including endangered species, water, pollution, and public lands. PERC says that government policy is {{the root cause of}} much environmental degradation. The Dust Bowl Reconsidered, for instance, blames the federal Homestead Act for <b>accelerating</b> <b>erosion</b> problems by limiting claims of newly settled land to 160-320 acre (0.65 to 1.3 km²) parcels. According to this article, fragmented land ownership reduced the incentives for implementing erosion countermeasures and made it difficult for farmers to negotiate contracts for voluntary soil conservation.|$|R
25|$|In total, {{there are}} seven species of {{introduced}} mammals and four introduced bird species within the park. Foxes and feral dogs are a threat to koalas, and Feral cats and foxes are a real danger to many threatened species within the Upland Swamp region. Bats are especially vulnerable to feral cat predators. Feral cats, foxes and mosquito fish (Gambusia affinis) have been listed as creating key threatening processes (predation, competition and vegetation alteration) under the Threatened Species Conservation Act, 1995 (NSW). Chytrid fungus infecting frogs and feral deer causing environmental degradation (such as trampling and <b>accelerating</b> <b>erosion),</b> are also considered to cause threatening processes.|$|R
50|$|Habitat {{conservation}} {{is important in}} maintaining biodiversity, {{an essential part of}} global food security. There is evidence to support a trend of <b>accelerating</b> <b>erosion</b> of the genetic resources of agricultural plants and animals. An increase in genetic similarity of agricultural plants and animals means an increased risk of food loss from major epidemics. Wild species of agricultural plants {{have been found to be}} more resistant to disease, for example the wild corn species Teosinte is resistant to 4 corn diseases that affect human grown crops. A combination of seed banking and habitat conservation has been proposed to maintain plant diversity for food security purposes.|$|R
