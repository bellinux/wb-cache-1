Multigroup structural equation modelling showed that Kony 2012 action was best captured by an emergent opinion-based social identity. Moreover, the same factors that predicted Kony 2012 action generally also predicted engagement in new repertoires of protest (involving the use of social media) and an observable traditional socio-political action (signing {{a letter to a}} government minister). The results suggest that there is no sharp dividing line between traditional and new forms of collective action and that both may be understood as valid expressions of collective selfhood...|$|E

40|$|Drotrecogin alfa (Xigris, {{recombinant}} activated protein C) is an anticoagulant {{developed and}} launched by Eli Lilly & Co {{for the treatment}} of sepsis [333781], [339372], [430133], [436271]. The FDA and the EMEA accepted the brand name Xigris for drotrecogin alfa in June 2001. This trade name had been proposed by Lilly in place of the previous brand name, Zovant, which was deemed unacceptable by the EMEA due to concerns that the name could be confused with hospital-based drugs [412512]. Filings for sepsis were made in the US, EU and Australia in February 2001 [398514], [447870] and in March 2001, the US FDA assigned drotrecogin alfa Priority Review status [403435]. The FDA extended the <b>action</b> <b>date</b> from July 27 to October 27, 2001 for completion of its review of the biologics license application (BLA) for drotrecogin alfa to assess further supplementary data submitted by Lilly [412512]. At the October 16, 2001 meeting (postponed from September 12), the FDA Advisory Committee on Anti-Infective Drugs split 10 to 10 over whether to recommend approval [425873], [425940]. In late October 2001, Lilly received an approvable letter from the FDA {{for the treatment of}} severe sepsis. Approval was contingent upon successful negotiation of labeling, agreement on post-approval clinical trials, and successful completion of manufacturing inspections [427301]. In November 2001, the FDA approved drotrecogin alfa for the reduction of mortality in adult patients with severe sepsis who have a high risk of death [430133]; the product was launched onto the US market days later [436271]. Following the FDA committee's split decision in October 2001, Credit Suisse First Boston, which expected mid- 2002 approval but with restrictive labeling, revised its predictions from $ 1. 265 billion in 2004 sharply downwards to $ 543 million [425929...|$|E

This allowed the construction of new pipe organs without any physical linkages whatsoever. Previous organs used tracker action, which requires a mechanical linkage between the console and the organ windchests, or tubular-pneumatic action, which linked the console and windchests with a large bundle of lead tubing.|$|R
