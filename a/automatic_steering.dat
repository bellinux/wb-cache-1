5000|$|Movax {{sheet piler}} is {{controlled}} by a cab-mounted <b>automatic</b> <b>steering</b> system;current model Auto C which allows the operator to select a precise angle to drive/extract piles, even horizontally. A skilled operator can pick up, position and drive a pile in one fluid motion. With computer-assisted <b>automatic</b> <b>steering</b> system and side grip ability, Movax sheet piler/excavator combination automatically corrects the straightness of the sheet pile during the driving and extracting. When Movax sheet piler drives the first pile into the ground, the distance is put into memory. Auto B takes the pile to the right distance near the guide and sets pile into the upright position, reducing the typical [...] "walking" [...] of the pile wall typical with other methods of installation.The other Movax roducst are; Soil Drills and Impact hammers.Movax products are manufactured by Movax Ltd Finland. Hercules Machinery Corporation (HMC), located in Fort Wayne, IN, is Movax Ltd's only licensed manufacturer for patented Movax Side Grip Sheet Pilers and distributes them exclusively in North America.|$|E
50|$|In {{some ways}} the Traclat was {{superior}} to its progenitor: the ammunition lockers were accessible from outside of the vehicle and it also had <b>automatic</b> <b>steering.</b> By early 1945 Vauxhall motors had supplied prototypes to the Fighting Vehicle Proving Establishment (FVPE) for official trials in conditions ranging from arctic to tropical and the vehicles proved excellent, being able to climb a one-in-two gradient and wade in water six feet deep but the war ended before mass production could be contemplated.|$|E
50|$|She {{was troubled}} by a run of early breakdowns: {{starboard}} ramp, hoist, forward capstan, bow-thrust unit and <b>automatic</b> <b>steering.</b> All were duly fixed, but her gearboxes {{continued to be a}} regular problem throughout her career. The absence of a turntable at the forward end of her car deck made the management of on-board traffic difficult. Initial problems were exacerbated by the need to use a side-loading hoist. Things improved after she hanselled the new end-loading linkspan at Gourock on 26 July 1971.|$|E

5000|$|From 1918 to 1922 Minorsky {{worked as}} an {{assistant}} to C. P. Steinmetz at the General Electric Research Laboratory in Schenectady, New York. In 1922 Minorsky helped in the installation and testing of <b>automatic</b> <b>steering</b> on board the battleship USS New Mexico. In relation to this work Minorsky authored a paper introducing the concept of Integral and Derivative Control. This paper is one of the earliest formal discussions on control theory in the English language. [...] Today, this analysis is considered as pioneering and fundamental to control theory as work by James Clerk Maxwell, Edward John Routh, and Adolf Hurwitz.|$|E
50|$|In 1958, a {{full size}} system was {{successfully}} demonstrated by RCA Labs and the State of Nebraska on a 400-foot strip of public highway just outside Lincoln, Neb. A series of experimental detector circuits {{buried in the}} pavement were a series of lights {{along the edge of}} the road. The detector circuits were able to send impulses to guide the car and determine the presence and velocity of any metallic vehicle on its surface. It was developed in collaboration with General Motors, who paired two standard models with equipment consisting of special radio receivers and audible and visual warning devices that were able to simulate <b>automatic</b> <b>steering,</b> accelerating and brake control.|$|E
50|$|The tanker did {{not have}} a {{scheduled}} route and as such lacked a complement of full scale charts of the Scilly Islands. To navigate the region, the vessel used LORAN, but not the more accurate Decca Navigator. When a collision with a fishing fleet became imminent, there was some confusion between the Master and the helmsman as to their exact position. Significant further delay arose due to uncertainty as to whether the vessel was in manual or <b>automatic</b> <b>steering</b> mode. By the time the problem was corrected, a grounding was unavoidable. In the hours and days to follow, extensive attempts to float the vessel off the reef proved unsuccessful, and even resulted in the death of a member of the Dutch salvage team, Captain Stal.|$|E
25|$|The Great Eastern {{was one of}} {{the largest}} steamships of its time and {{employed}} a steam powered rudder with feedback mechanism designed in 1866 by John McFarlane Gray. Joseph Farcot coined the word servo in 1873 to describe steam-powered steering systems. Hydraulic servos were later used to position guns. Elmer Ambrose Sperry of the Sperry Corporation designed the first autopilot in 1912. Nicolas Minorsky published a theoretical analysis of <b>automatic</b> ship <b>steering</b> in 1922 and described the PID controller.|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{describes}} the successful realisation of a prototype <b>automatic</b> null <b>steering</b> antenna operating at 10. 5 GHz. The {{aim of this}} antenna system is to emulate the interference cancelling capability of the well known adaptive antennas without resorting to expensive ancillary microwave hardware such antennas require. A study was carried out {{on the problems of}} antenna radiation pattern synthesis with null placement and that of resolving the amplitude and the direction of arrival of the incident signals on a linear antenna array. Detailed discussion and some new solutions to these problems are proposed and presented in this thesis. Based on the knowledge gained in the work done in these two areas, an experimental <b>automatic</b> null <b>steering</b> antenna array system operating at 10. 5 GHz. was successfully designed and constructed. The development of the antenna system required the design of a novel complex weighting circuit which could alter both the in phase and the quadrature phase signal paths of an input signal at 10. 5 GHz independently under microprocessor control. Other relevant digital and microwave hardware were also developed. Detailed experimental verification of the antenna array performance is also included...|$|R
