40|$|Manures are an {{inevitable}} consequence of livestock in agriculture. They represent a valuable source of nutrients, including nitrogen (N), phosphorus and potassium. The industrial production of fertilisers containing these elements {{is associated with}} finite resources and this alone justifies a proper recycling of manures. The N fertiliser replacement value (NFRV) of manures is still insufficiently appreciated and exploited. Mineral fertiliser N supplementation is thus unnecessarily large, to the potential detriment of the environment. The present paper reviews methods to correctly assess the NFRV of manures and presents measures to increase the NFRV. When proper attention {{is given to the}} composition of manures and decisions on rates, timing and application methods are made accordingly, the relative NFRV of manures could rise from the present 20 - 50 percent to 80 percent.
