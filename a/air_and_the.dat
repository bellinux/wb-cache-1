After Glennon was sacked at the 50-yard line, however, the drive sputtered and the Hokies were forced to punt the ball.|$|E

With Amy's help, the Doctor tracks the disturbance to the second floor of a house. The Doctor opts to take a room for rent offered by the downstairs tenant, Craig Owens, in order to determine what is present on the second floor without alerting whatever it is to his Time Lord nature. Neither Craig nor the Doctor are aware that people are being lured off the street to the second floor flat and never leaving again, but the Doctor is conscious of localised time loops and disturbances aboard the TARDIS that coincide with noises from the second floor.|$|E
5|$|Ash {{particles}} {{of less than}} 10 µm diameter suspended in the air {{are known to be}} inhalable, and people exposed to ash falls have experienced respiratory discomfort, breathing difficulty, eye and skin irritation, and nose and throat symptoms. Most of these effects are short-term and are not considered to pose a significant health risk to those without pre-existing respiratory conditions. The health effects of volcanic ash depend on the grain size, mineralogical composition and chemical coatings {{on the surface of the}} ash particles. Additional factors related to potential respiratory symptoms are the frequency and duration of exposure, the concentration of ash in the <b>air</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> respirable ash fraction; the proportion of ash with less than 10µm diameter, known as PM10. The social context may also be important.|$|E

Dramatic strengthening began late on October21 and continued through October23. Patricia reached hurricane strength shortly after 00:00UTC on October22, featuring prominent outflow, well-defined banding features, and a developing eye. Data from Hurricane Hunters investigating the cyclone indicated Patricia to have reached Category4 status on the Saffir–Simpson hurricane wind scale by 18:00UTC.|$|E
5|$|Given the {{importance}} of snowmelt to agriculture, hydrological runoff models that include snow in their predictions address the phases of accumulating snowpack, melting processes, and distribution of the meltwater through stream networks and into the groundwater. Key to describing the melting processes are solar heat flux, ambient temperature, wind, and precipitation. Initial snowmelt models used a degree-day approach that emphasized the temperature difference between the <b>air</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> snowpack to compute snow water equivalent, SWE. More recent models use an energy balance approach that {{take into account the}} following factors to compute Qm, the energy available for melt. This requires measurement of an array of snowpack and environmental factors to compute six heat flow mechanisms that contribute to Qm.|$|E

The ship Naglfar, described in the Prose Edda as being made from the human nails of the dead, is released from its mooring, and sets sail on the surging sea, steered by a jötunn named Hrym. At the same time, Fenrir, eyes and nostrils spraying flames, charges forward with his mouth wide open, his upper jaw reaching to the heavens, his lower jaw touching the earth.

5|$|In {{addition}} to fueling Hero actions, Bezels {{act as a}} safeguard to character defeat. Characters will not receive any direct damage {{as long as there}} is at least one Bezel. If there are enough Bezels remaining, receiving damage that would otherwise defeat the character instead causes the character to be knocked into the <b>air</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Bezel is shattered into shards that scatter across the battlefield. If the player does not have any Bezels remaining, the characters go into critical mode. Critical mode causes the characters to become extremely scared, leaving them unable to shoot quickly, unable to use Hero actions, and taking direct damage from every attack. Four Bezel Shards must be collected by the characters in order to restore a Bezel and replenish their power, and enemies can even pick up Bezel Shards to regenerate health and shields. The game ends if any character is killed and there are no intact Bezels to protect them.|$|E
5|$|Jean Buridan (1300–1358) also {{rejected}} {{the notion that}} this motion-generating property, which he named impetus, dissipated spontaneously. Buridan's position was that a moving object would be arrested by {{the resistance of the}} <b>air</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> weight of the body which would oppose its impetus. He also maintained that impetus increased with speed; thus, his initial idea of impetus was similar in many ways to the modern concept of momentum. Despite the obvious similarities to more modern ideas of inertia, Buridan saw his theory as only a modification to Aristotle's basic philosophy, maintaining many other peripatetic views, including the belief that there was still a fundamental difference between an object in motion and an object at rest. Buridan also maintained that impetus could be not only linear, but also circular in nature, causing objects such as celestial bodies to move in a circle.|$|E

5|$|The {{biosphere}} is {{the part}} of Earth's outer shell– including land, surface rocks, water, <b>air</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> atmosphere– within which life occurs, and which biotic processes in turn alter or transform. From the broadest geophysiological point of view, the biosphere is the global ecological system integrating all living beings and their relationships, including their interaction with the elements of the lithosphere (rocks), hydrosphere (water), and atmosphere (air). The entire Earth contains over 75billion tons (150 trillion pounds or about 6.8×1013kilograms) of biomass (life), which lives within various environments within the biosphere.) and 455billion kg (between 845billion and 975billion lb, or about 423million–488million short tons). The total biomass of all kinds on earth is estimated to be in excess of 6.8x1013kg (75billion short tons). By these calculations, the portion of total biomass accounted for by humans would be very roughly 0.6%.|$|E

5|$|At {{its peak}} intensity, Typhoon Halong had gale-force winds that {{extended}} 415km (260mi) {{northeast of the}} center. It was continuing to the northwest toward Okinawa, and threatened to strike the island at near peak intensity. However, the typhoon began rapidly weakening due to increasing wind shear, and the eye quickly deteriorated. At around 1200UTC on July14, Halong made landfall on Okinawa with 10‑minute winds of 130km/h (80mph). Around that time, the typhoon moved through a weakness in the ridge, turning {{to the north and}} later accelerating to the northeast. The combination of cool, dry <b>air,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> persistent wind shear removed the convection from the center by early on July15, weakening Halong to tropical storm status. Later that day, the JTWC discontinued advisories while the storm was approaching Japan, and the agency classified Halong as extratropical. The JMA continued tracking the storm, and Halong struck both the Izu and Bōsō peninsulas along Honshu. Late on July16, the JMA classified Halong as extratropical, and shortly thereafter the storm dissipated over the Kuril Islands. The extratropical remnants of Halong moved out of the basin late on July 19, just prior dissipating.|$|E
