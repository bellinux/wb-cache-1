5|$|Barring a few {{exceptions}} where Trijata is cast as Ravana's agent, she is generally portrayed <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>friend</b> and loyal companion of Sita in her adversity. On numerous occasions, she offers solace to Sita and brings news from the outside world; she also dissuades Sita from committing suicide. After Rama's victory and Ravana's death, Trijata is richly rewarded by Sita and Rama. While some Ramayana adaptations mention her being a devotee of Rama, Southeast Asian versions often depict her as the wife of Rama's monkey general Hanuman, whom she bears a son. She is worshipped as a local goddess in Varanasi and Ujjain; both in India.|$|E

When Karan understands {{that he has been}} shot, they speak amongst themselves for the last time, regarding the others, about Sue and about Daljit's love for her.

It is then revealed that McKinley described the third kind of people he came across as being the ones who embraced death <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>friend</b> and an equal, with a heartfelt laughter. After their death, the public reacts with outrage and expresses urge to bring Indian politics to justice, following the motives of all the boys.|$|E

5|$|One {{of the few}} {{surviving}} sources contemporary {{with the}} rule of Tiberius comes from Velleius Paterculus, who served under Tiberius for eight years (from AD4) in Germany and Pannonia as praefect of cavalry and legatus. Paterculus' Compendium of Roman History spans a period from the fall of Troy {{to the death of}} Livia in AD29. His text on Tiberius lavishes praise on both the emperor and Sejanus. How much of this is due to genuine admiration or prudence remains an open question, but it has been conjectured that he was put to death in AD31 <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>friend</b> of Sejanus.|$|E
5|$|The Philippines values its {{relations}} with the United States. It supported the United States during the Cold War and the War on Terror and is a major non-NATO ally. Despite this history of goodwill, controversies related to the presence of the now former U.S. military bases in Subic Bay and Clark and the current Visiting Forces Agreement have flared up from time to time. Japan, the biggest contributor of official development assistance to the country, is thought of <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>friend.</b> Although historical tensions still exist on issues such as the plight of comfort women, much of the animosity inspired by memories of World War II has faded.|$|E
5|$|After {{depositing}} {{his family}} in a London hotel, the Claimant called at Lady Tichborne's address and was told she was in Paris. He then went to Wapping in East London, where he enquired after a local family named Orton. Finding that they had left the area, he identified himself to a neighbour <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>friend</b> of Arthur Orton, who, he said, was {{now one of the}} wealthiest men in Australia. The significance of the Wapping visit would become apparent only later. On 29 December the Claimant visited Alresford and stayed at the Swan Hotel, where the landlord detected a resemblance to the Tichbornes. The Claimant confided that he was the missing Sir Roger but asked that this be kept secret. He also sought information concerning the Tichborne family.|$|E

5|$|Although {{the case}} was filed in the Western District of Wisconsin, the judge there recused himself <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>friend</b> of the magazine. The case was {{therefore}} brought before Judge Robert W. Warren, a judge in the Eastern District of Wisconsin. Because of the sensitive nature of information {{at stake in the}} trial, two separate hearings were conducted, one in public, and the other in camera. The defendants, Morland and the editors of The Progressive, would not accept security clearances, which would put restraints on their free speech, and so were not present at the in camera hearings. Their lawyers did obtain clearances so that they could participate, but were forbidden from conveying anything they heard there to their clients.|$|E

While Maxima sees K' <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>friend</b> and his partner, K' is stoic and cynical. He also meets Whip, who it is revealed is a clone of his sister, Seirah.

5|$|John Constantine, {{the main}} {{character}} of Hellblazer, was portrayed {{as a kind of}} confidence man and occult detective who did morally questionable things, arguably for the greater good. He usually triumphed through guile, deceit, and misdirection, but often made more enemies in the process than he defeated. Indeed, it was a common theme in the book that Constantine was unable to effect any lasting change or enjoy unequivocal victories. While sometimes striving for the good of mankind, Constantine was often manipulative and a dangerous person to have <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>friend,</b> as the lives and souls of those around him became perilously involved in his misadventures. He took pains to protect himself from direct attacks, but his friends and relatives were often endangered in order to strike at him. The spirits of deceased friends haunted him, individually or as an entourage of ghosts.|$|E

In late March, after agreeing to dance with Sarah {{during one of the}} classes, Lydia kisses her. Sarah denies it when Lydia claims that they felt something. Sarah then shows more of an interest in Lydia.|$|E
5|$|On December 15, 2015, Heyward {{signed an}} eight-year, $184 million {{contract}} with the Cubs. One of his first acts after signing his contract was to pay for hotel suites {{large enough to accommodate}} teammate David Ross, his wife, and their three young children on all of the Cubs' road trips during the 2016 season. Ross, set to retire after the 2016 season, had been Heyward's teammate during his first three seasons in Atlanta, and Heyward considered him a key mentor in his early MLB career. In an interview with the Bleacher Report website, Heyward said,I know how special it is to have teammates like he was my first three years in Atlanta. You don't take it for granted. I wanted to say thank you {{from the bottom of my}} heart, as a teammate and <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>friend,</b> for what he's done for me.|$|E

5|$|On {{the night}} of May 30, two girls fall victim to the Apathy Syndrome {{in front of the}} school which prompts {{widespread}} rumors. Yukari, Junpei and Makoto go looking for answers from the delinquents behind Port Island Station and learn from Shinjiro Aragaki (Kazuya Nakai) that the girls had been bullying Fuka before the latter suddenly disappeared that same night. On June 8, Natsuki confesses to Mitsuru that she and her friends had locked Fuka inside the school's gymnasium. However when her friends went to check on Fuka that same night, she had mysteriously vanished while the latter developed the Apathy cases after being preyed on by Shadows. That night the SEES members deduce that Fuka may be trapped inside the Tartarus tower and plan to rescue her. However when Mitsuru asks Makoto to accompany them, Yukari grows frustrated at his ambivalence and he excludes himself from the mission. Instead, Mitsuru elects him to protect Natsuki at the dorm where he listens to Natsuki's reasoning for bullying Fuka and relates that Fuka genuinely considers her <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>friend.</b>|$|E
5|$|Phaedrus was {{suspected}} of having alluded to Sejanus in his Fables and received some unknown punishment short of death (Cf. Fables I.1, I.2.24, and I.17). Velleius Paterculus was a historian and contemporary of Sejanus, whose two-volume The Roman History details a history of Rome from the fall of Troy until the death of Livia Augusta in AD 29. In his work he praised Tiberius and Sejanus, even defending the latter's high position in the government, despite not ranking higher than equestrian. How much of Paterculus' writing is due to genuine admiration, prudence or fear remains an open question, {{but it has been}} conjectured that he was put to death <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>friend</b> of Sejanus.|$|E

Sky tells Boyd Hoyland (Kyal Marsh) about the kiss, and Lana is later outed at school.|$|E
