40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to empirically examine the {{relationship}} between alcohol <b>advertising</b> <b>bans</b> and alcohol consumption. Most prior studies have found no effect of advertising on total alcohol consumption. A simple economic model is provided which explains these prior results. The data set used in this study is a pooled time series of data from 20 countries over 26 years. The empirical model is a simultaneous equations system which treats both alcohol consumption and alcohol <b>advertising</b> <b>bans</b> as endogenous. The primary conclusions of this study are that alcohol <b>advertising</b> <b>bans</b> decrease alcohol consumption and that alcohol consumption has a positive effect on the legislation of <b>advertising</b> <b>bans.</b> The results indicate that an increase of one ban could reduce alcohol consumption by 5 % to 8 %. The alcohol price elasticity is estimated at about 0. 2. The results suggest that recent exogenous decreases in alcohol consumption will decrease the probability of enactment of new bans and undermine the continuance of existing bans. Canada, Denmark, New Zealand and Finland have recently rescinded alcohol <b>advertising</b> <b>bans.</b> Alcohol consumption in these countries may increase or decrease at a slower rate than would have occurred had <b>advertising</b> <b>bans</b> remained in place. ...|$|R
40|$|Using panel {{data for}} a {{cross-section}} of countries, several previous studies estimate the effect of <b>advertising</b> <b>bans</b> on cigarette consumption. These studies suffer from three problems: (1) structural change in cigarette demand functions; (2) endogeneity of advertising bans; and (3) non-stationarity of cigarette consumption data. Using annual data for 20 OECD countries, this study tests for unit roots. Growth rates of cigarette consumption (log differences) are stationary, but levels data are not. I estimate single-equation panel models for 1970 - 1995 and test formally for structural change. The tests and recursive coefficient estimates confirm a regime change beginning in 1985. Results for different time periods are reported {{for the effects of}} price, income, health warnings, country fixed-effects, and moderate and strong <b>advertising</b> <b>bans.</b> The study also considers the possibility of endogenous <b>advertising</b> <b>bans.</b> A public-choice model is estimated as a two-equation model of advertising legislation and cigarette demand. The adoption of <b>advertising</b> <b>bans</b> is modeled as a Poisson count regression, and fitted values for the number of banned media are used as instruments in the demand equation. The results in the paper fail to demonstrate that <b>advertising</b> <b>bans</b> reduce aggregate cigarette consumption. Empirical results in previous studies are not robust to use of stationary data; refinements in model specification; different time periods; and endogeneity of <b>advertising</b> <b>bans.</b> Due to a decline in smoking prevalence, especially among males, there was a change in the political climate in favor of stronger restrictions on cigarette <b>advertising.</b> Overall, <b>advertising</b> <b>bans</b> have had no effect on cigarette consumption, regardless of the time period considered or the severity of the bans. ...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the effect of}} tobacco <b>advertising</b> <b>bans</b> on youth smoking prevalence in developing countries. Despite little direct empirical analysis of this issue, public health professionals frequently propose <b>advertising</b> <b>bans</b> {{as a first step}} in dealing with youth smoking. Using a Bayesian learning model, the paper first develops a plausible mechanism for an effect of <b>advertising</b> <b>bans</b> on youth smoking. Advertising is hypothesized to alter youth perceptions of the ubiquity of smoking and the risks associated with this behavior. Using survey-based data, a cross-country linear probability model of youth smoking prevalence is estimated, including gender results, pooled results, and results by frequency of smoking (30 -day, ever-smoked). Explanatory variables are included for income, demographics, <b>advertising</b> <b>bans,</b> and several other important policy variables (health warnings, prohibition of sales to minors, school classes, antismoking messages, access in retail stores). The empirical results indicate that <b>advertising</b> <b>bans</b> have no effect on youth smoking prevalence in developing countries. This result holds for complete bans as well as partial bans. Some of the results suggest that school classes and other education efforts would be effective as a means to alter or affect youth perceptions of the risks associated with smoking. ...|$|R

40|$|Tobacco <b>advertising</b> <b>bans</b> {{have become}} commonplace in {{developed}} nations but are less prevalent in developing countries. The importance of <b>advertising</b> <b>bans</b> {{as part of}} comprehensive tobacco control strategies has been emphasised by the Framework Convention on Tobacco Control which calls for comprehensive <b>bans</b> on tobacco <b>advertising.</b> The empirical literature suggests that comprehensive <b>advertising</b> <b>bans</b> {{have played a role}} in reducing consumption in developed countries but that limited policies have not. This paper extends this analysis to include 30 developing countries and finds that bans do play an important role in reducing tobacco consumption in these countries.

Furthermore, it finds that <b>advertising</b> <b>bans</b> may be even more effective in the developing world than they are in the developed world. ...|$|R
40|$|This paper uses {{cross-country}} panel data {{to study}} the effects of <b>advertising</b> <b>bans</b> and other control policies on alcohol demand. The null hypothesis is that <b>advertising</b> <b>bans</b> do not decrease alcohol consumption. The study addresses several shortcomings in four previous cross-country studies. First, an explanatory variable is included for other alcohol control policies. Second, the study examines the history of <b>advertising</b> <b>bans</b> in OECD countries. Third, the study also examines differences in cross-country trends that characterize developed countries, including aging of the population, increased tourism, higher unemployment rates, and increased consumption of wine. The Mediterranean wine-drinking countries are shown to be categorically distinct from the beer-drinking countries and Nordic spirits-drinking countries. Fourth, the study examines the panel data for unit roots and employs model specifications that correct for non-stationary data. The empirical results indicate a significantly negative effect for the control index and the alcohol price. Using alternative model specifications and estimation methods, the results indicate that <b>advertising</b> <b>bans</b> do not reduce alcohol consumption...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. This paper {{examines}} {{the effect of}} tobacco <b>advertising</b> <b>bans</b> on youth smoking prevalence in developed and developing countries. Despite little direct empirical analysis of this issue, public health professionals frequently propose <b>advertising</b> <b>bans</b> {{as a first step}} in dealing with youth smoking. Using a Bayesian learning model, the paper first develops a plausible mechanism for an effect of <b>advertising</b> <b>bans</b> on youth smoking. Advertising is hypothesized to alter youth perceptions of the ubiquity of smoking and the risks associated with this behavior. Using survey-based data, several cross-country linear probability models of youth smoking prevalence are estimated, including separate results for developed and developing countries by gender, pooled results, and results by frequency of smoking (weekly, 30 -day, ever-smoked). Explanatory variables are included for price, income, demographics, <b>advertising</b> <b>bans,</b> and several other important policy variables (health warnings, prohibition of sales to minors, school classes, anti-smoking messages, access in retail stores). The results demonstrate that <b>advertising</b> <b>bans</b> have had little or no influence on youth smoking prevalence in developed or developing countries. This result holds for complete bans as well as partial bans. Some of the results suggest that school classes and other education efforts would be effective as a means to affect youth perceptions of the risks associated with smoking. ________________________ * The author has acted as a consultant to a law firm that represents the tobacco industry.

40|$|Tobacco {{advertising}} {{is a public}} health issue if these activities increase smoking. Although public health advocates assert that tobacco advertising does increase smoking, there is significant empirical literature that finds little or no effect of tobacco advertising on smoking. In this paper, these prior studies are examined more closely with several important insights emerging from this analysis. This paper also provides new empirical evidence {{on the effect of}} tobacco advertising. The primary conclusion of this research is that a comprehensive set of tobacco <b>advertising</b> <b>bans</b> can reduce tobacco consumption and that a limited set of tobacco <b>advertising</b> <b>bans</b> will have little of no effect. The regression results indicate that a comprehensive set of tobacco <b>advertising</b> <b>bans</b> can reduce consumption by 6. 3 percent. The regression results also indicate that the new European Commission directive tobacco advertising in the EC countries, will reduce tobacco consumption by about 6. 9 percent on average in the EC. The regression results also indicate that the <b>ban</b> on outdoor <b>advertising</b> included in the US tobacco industry state level settlement will probably not result in much change in advertising expenditures nor in tobacco use. Under the settlement industry would also contribute $ 1. 5 billion over five years for public education on tobacco use. This counteradvertising could reduce tobacco use by about two percent. ...|$|R

40|$|Background: Point-of-sale (POS) tobacco {{advertising}} {{has been}} linked to youth smoking susceptibility and experimental smoking. However, there is limited evidence of the association between POS <b>advertising</b> <b>bans</b> and youth smoking participation. This study aims to examine how such bans are associated with current smoking, daily smoking, and regular smoking (‚â• 1 cigarettes per day) participation among youth. Methods: one to two waves (primarily one wave) of the Global Youth Tobacco Survey were conducted in 130 countries between 2007 and 2011. These surveys were linked to the WHO ‚ÄúMPOWER‚Äù data using country and year identifiers to analyze the association between POS <b>advertising</b> <b>bans</b> (a dichotomous measure of the existence of such bans) and smoking participation in the past month. Weighted logistic regressions were employed to analyze this association while controlling for age, gender, parents‚Äô smoking status, 6 MPOWER policy scores, and GDP per capita. Results and Conclusions: We find that in countries with POS <b>advertising</b> <b>bans,</b> current smoking (OR = 0. 73, p ‚â§ 0. 1), daily smoking (OR = 0. 70, p ‚â§ 0. 1), and regular smoking (OR = 0. 75, p ‚â§ 0. 05) participation in the past month is significantly lower, suggesting that POS promotion bans can potentially reduce youth smoking.
