According {{to a joint}} Japanese-Vietnamese evaluation team, the recent installation of additional <b>auto-signal</b> systems at key crossings along the line has contributed {{to a decline in}} railway accidents. Semaphore signals were once used throughout the Vietnamese rail network, but these are gradually being replaced with colour light signals; most of the railway lines in northern Vietnam have been converted.|$|E
