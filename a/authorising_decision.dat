Using agile organisation and IT-governance theory as lenses to analyse data from a hospital case study, a strategic process model of governance for agility is empirically derived.

Theoretically, this study contributes to the dearth of empirical understanding of IT governance in the Healthcare IT literature and advances knowledge by making a conceptual distinction through introducing the use of phase-based IT-governance strategies and forms to generate agile organisational capabilities to achieve agile Healthcare IT implementation. The findings serve as a foundation for future research within the information systems (IS) discipline.

40|$|This work set out {{to assess}} and examine the {{position}} of the individuals as non-state actors within the process of international law creation, in essence taking an existing problem and bringing a new idea. In undertaking this aim three new classifications of non-state actor have been identified in which the evidence gives a better informed theory. These new classifications, the authorised, independent and unauthorised individual, give a more realistic account between the theoretical narrative of the individual and realities seen within international law creation. In contrast to the current theories which are heavily theoretical and abstract, this work has an evidence based approach informing on a new theoretical framework. The authorised individual is someone mandated to perform negotiations of future international law on behalf of an authorised-decision maker, usually a state government. The principal features of the authorised individual are that they are briefed to act on behalf of states, usually conforming to a strict mandate to which they are expected to follow. The independent authorised individual is similarly related to the authorised individual in that they are mandated by an <b>authorised</b> <b>decision</b> maker. The main differences being they are given more freedom to perform the role and are asked to fulfil more general aims and expected outcomes set down by the individual’s home government. John Ruggie and the process used by him {{in the creation of the}} UNGP’s provide an excellent example of the work of this category of individual. Finally, the unauthorised individual is someone who by conventional standards and expectations wouldn’t be expected to have a role in the negotiations for international law making, i. e. they have no mandate, and are not acting on behalf of a state. Examples are Raphael Lemkin and John Peters Humphrey. To demonstrate that individuals have a role in law-making, this alternative approach has a focus on the realities of the international system. In using Rational Choice theory models of analysis the effectiveness of the different categories of the individual can be seen, with clear benefits of the work of independent authorised individuals demonstrated as effective law makers within the system...|$|R
5|$|The Allies {{first noticed}} {{construction}} activity at Wizernes in mid-August 1943 when the Germans began building railway track and the offloading stores {{into the old}} quarry. After Hitler <b>authorised</b> the <b>decision</b> to turn the depot into a missile launch site, construction was stepped up. Work on the dome began in November 1943 and tunnelling in the cliff face below began in December. At the start of January, Allied reconnaissance aircraft observed an elaborate system of camouflage on the hill top, installed to conceal the dome. The building works were greatly hindered by the constant air-raid warnings, which stopped work 229 times in May 1944 alone. In response to Hitler's desire to see the site completed the workforce was expanded substantially from 1,100 in April 1944 to nearly 1,400 by June. About 60% of the workers were Germans; skilled workers, such as miners from Westphalia, were recruited to excavate the tunnels and build the dome. The remainder were principally Frenchmen conscripted by the Service du travail obligatoire (STO), plus Soviet prisoners of war. The project was overseen by several large German construction companies, with Philipp Holzman A.G. of Frankfurt am Main and the Grossdeutsche Schachtbau and Tiefbohr GmbH serving as the chief contractors.|$|R

40|$|Background :  Within Australian hospitals, cardiac and {{respiratory}} arrests {{result in a}} resuscitation attempt unless the patient is documented as not for resuscitation. Aim : To examine the consistency of policies and documentation for withholding in-hospital resuscitation across health services. Method : An observational, qualitative review of hospital policy and documentation was conducted in June 2013 in three public and two private sector hospitals in metropolitan Melbourne. Not for resuscitation (NFR) forms were evaluated for physical characteristics, content, authorisation and decision-making. Hospital policies were coded for alerts, definition of futility and burden of treatment and management of discussions and dissent. Results : There {{was a lack of}} standardisation, with each site using its own unique NFR form and accompanying site-specific policies. Differences were found in who could <b>authorise</b> the <b>decision,</b> what was included on the form, the role of patients and families, and how discussions were managed and dissent resolved. Futility and burden of treatment were not defined independently. These inconsistencies across sites contribute to a lack of clarity regarding the decision to withhold resuscitation, and have implications for staff employed across multiple hospitals. Conclusions : NFR forms should be reviewed and standardised so as to be clear, uniform and consistent with the legislative framework. We propose a two-stage process of documentation. Stage 1 facilitates discussion of patient-specific goals of care and consideration of limitations of treatment. Stage 2 serves to communicate a NFR order. Decisions to withhold resuscitation are inherently complex but could be aided by separating the decision-making process from the communication of the decision, resulting in improved end-of-life care. </div...|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{proposes a}} normative theory of political representation grounded in popular sovereignty and positive law, {{rather than in}} democracy and efficient labour allocation. The first three chapters assess the contributions {{to the idea of}} representation of three early modern thinkers. Hobbes proposes a formal model of authorised action at a distance, but, contrary to a long-standing consensus in political thought, not an actual theory of representation. Rousseau, a well-known opponent of representation, proposes ideas about government, sovereignty, and positive law, which, despite his contrary intentions, form a foundation for a normative theory of representation. Sieyes refines concepts from both to create a more mature practical statement on representation which he attempts to implement in three revolutionary constitutions in France in the 1790 's. The next three chapters make an argument connecting representation to law creation. First the concept of a decision is defined, and then abstracted through various levels of political authority and action. Law creation is distinguished from all other classes of <b>authorised</b> political <b>decision</b> making by four unique properties which tie in with problems initially raised by the early modern philosophers regarding popular sovereignty. Various numbers of authorised actors are considered as constituting political bodies credentialed to carry out the relevant decisions identified as meeting the minimal conditions of law, and ultimately only assembly — a body numbering in the hundreds, with a reserved place for making recognised decisions, and a formal connection to expressed popular preferences — meets the conceptual requirements of the class of decisions mooted. The thesis ends with an argument connecting law to representation as the {{solution to the problem of}} plurality. This thesis is not currently available via ORA...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{examines}} recent <b>decisions</b> <b>authorising</b> the sterilization {{of people}} with intellectual disability. It examines how social policy in rejecting historical eugenics-based arguments moved towards normalisation, {{care in the community}} programmes and ‘supported living policies’ encouraging the devolvement of responsibility to the family. It describes how during this century the medical model gave way to a social model conception of disability and a greater awareness of rights {{of people with}} intellectual disabilities to enjoy intimate relations. Contemporary discussion has engaged in a rights-based framework described as a paradigm shift heralded by the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (CRPD) where arguments about dignity and bodily integrity against coercive practices take on a more pivotal role. Using recent cases, the paper examines how social policies have influenced contemporary cases where courts have authorised sterilizations of people with intellectual disabilities without their consent. The paper questions whether the bests interests test under the Mental Capacity Act 2005 (MCA) adequately serves the interests of people with intellectual disability and also whether the least restrictive alternative provisions under the MCA are being consistently applied by the Court of Protection in these cases...|$|R
500|$|The {{locality}} {{where the}} interference occurred also influences {{whether or not}} it was unreasonable; in Sturges v Bridgman, Thesiger LJ wrote that [...] "what would be a nuisance in Belgrave Square [...] would not necessarily be so in Bermondsey [...] ". If an activity is out of place with the locality, it is likely to be held as unreasonable. However, the nature of areas can change over time; in Gillingham Borough Council v Medway (Chatham) Dock Co Ltd, it was held that the granting of planning permission to develop a commercial dock in an area changed that area's character, preventing the local residence from claiming in private nuisance for the disturbance the dock created. The granting of planning permission does not constitute immunity from a claim in nuisance, however; in Wheeler v Saunders Ltd. the Court of Appeal said that it would be [...] "a misuse of language to describe what has happened in the present case as a change in the character of the neighbourhood. It is a change of use of a very small piece of land... it is not a strategic planning decision affected by considerations of public interest. Unless one is prepared to accept that any planning <b>decision</b> <b>authorises</b> any nuisance which must inevitably come from it, the argument that the nuisance was authorised by planning permission in this case must fail". In situations where the defendant's activities cause physical damage, as in St Helen's Smelting Co v Tipping, the locality of the activities is not a factor in deciding their unreasonableness.|$|R
40|$|In {{his general}} {{analysis}} {{of the evolution of}} capitalism, Marx had posited that industrial capital would subjugate (autonomous) financial capital, manifested in the private banking infrastructure, on the grounds that interest-bearing capital derives from the capitalist production process (and is therefore ultimately dependent on it) and further that commercial credit was a secondary function (merely concerned with facilitating circulation) to the value-adding production process (p. 468) (Marx 1971). Yet, shortly after Marx, events appeared to contradict his prediction. The rise of the joint-stock firm, for instance, suggested that (investment) banks had gained decision-making power over the corporate(s) through integration – the Hilferding notion of finance capital (Hilferding 1910; Lenin 1996). Substantial tribute is also, of course, extracted from the economy in the form of interest. I argued, in a previous AHE paper, that financial rentiers are now less integrated, strengthening their position relative to productive capitalists (Mouatt 2005). Hedge funds and private-equity firms that ‘short-sell’ leveraged funds for instance, that are <b>authorised</b> by the <b>decisions</b> of private bankers, are able to manipulate currency and stock prices that can belie the market fundamentals and bamboozle small investors. Redistributive accumulation, asset stripping, and corporate monopolization can then follow any subsequent currency (or share-price) shock. It seems that finance (and those that control it) has triumphed. Yet, there are contemporary signs of systemic weakness. Banks are increasingly exposed to the vagaries of international financial markets and earn a smaller proportion of profit from interest. In addition, firms are now less dependent on the bankers, as a result of retained profits, and are also further developing their own monies, payment systems and banks. This financial innovation, with new circulation channels, requires a re-think on (modern) money. ...|$|R
40|$|Suomen hallituksen odotetaan tekevän uuden ehdotuksen saattohelikoptereiden hankinnoista lähivuosina, selviää juuri valmistuneesta väitöskirjasta. Kansanedustajista, puolustushallinnon keskeisistä virkamiehistä ja poliittisista toimittajista liki 90 prosenttia uskoo, että saattohelikopterit tulevat uudestaan eduskuntakäsittelyyn. YM FM Lea Ahoniemen väitöskirjassa "Taistelu helikoptereista" tutkittiin myös keskeisten päättäjien ja poliittisten toimittajien NATO-käsityksiä. Ahoniemen väitöskirjan mukaan Suomen liittymistä NATO:on pitää todennäköisenä 39 prosenttia vastaajista ja epätodennäköisenä 45 prosenttia. Kyselyihin vastanneista yhteensä 341 henkilöstä 16 % ei ottanut Suomen mahdolliseen NATO-jäsenyyteen kantaa. Tuoretta väitöskirjaa varten tehtiin kysely kansanedustajille, puolustushallinnon virkamiehille ja aihealueesta kirjoittaville toimittajille toukokuussa 1998, ja uudelleen kansanedustajille toukokuussa 1999. Suomen puolustuspolitiikan linjauksista päättää suppea eliitti, johon kuuluu noin parikymmentä henkilöä, kertoo tutkimustulos. Tavallinen rivipoliitikko tuntee vaikutusmahdollisuutensa armeijan hankintoihin vähäisiksi. Eduskunnan ja puolustushallinnon välistä asiantuntijavaltaa tarkastelevan tutkimuksen tavoitteena on kuvata Suomen turvallisuus- ja puolustuspoliittista päätöksentekojärjestelmää ja sen kehittymistä nykymuotoonsa. Tavoitteena on lisäksi kartoittaa keskeisiä alan päätöksentekoon vaikuttavia toimijoita ja hahmottaa heidän asennoitumistaan keskeisiin puolustuspoliittisiin kysymyksiin. Case tutkimustapauksena on tarkasteltu maavoimien valmiusyhtymien varustamiskysymystä. Hallitus esitti syksyllä 1997 eduskunnan hyväksyttäväksi yhteensä 7, 7 miljardin markan tilausvaltuutta maavoimien valmiusyhtymien varusteluja varten, josta helikopterihankinnan osuus oli 5, 6 miljardia markkaa. Puolustusministeriön mukaan suojaustehtävään tarkoitettuja saattohelikoptereita tarvittaisiin kuljetushelikoptereiden lisäksi siten, että kahta tai kolmea kuljetushelikopteria olisi suojaamassa yksi saattohelikopteri. Eduskunta siirsi asian käsittelyn kevääseen 1998, jolloin Suomessa alkoi laaja puolustuspoliittinen keskustelu, mihin helikoptereita tarvittaisiin ja onko hankinnan taustalla mahdollisesti tiivistyvä kansainvälinen puolustuspoliittinen yhteistyö. The aim of {{the study}} is to {{describe}} the decision-making system on security and defence and its evolution to its present condition. The objective is further to review those actors whose influence on decision-making is paramount and to outline their attitudes to central defence issues. The theoretical point of departure {{of the study is}} the application to defence policy decision-making in Finnish society of the theories outlined by the elite theorists Gaetano Mosca, C. Wright Mills and Gabriel Almond and also the organisational theorists Max Weber and Robert Michels. The second point of departure for the theoretical examination is policy analysis through which the cause and effect relations in defence policy decision-making are scrutinized. The issue of the readiness brigades of the ground forces is taken as a case in point. In autumn 1997 the Government requested parliamentary approval for a procurement authorisation of FIM 7. 7 billion (1303 million Euros) for equipping army readiness brigades, of which the acquisition of helicopters amounted to FIM 5. 6 billion (942 million Euros). According to the Ministry of Defence escort helicopters, intended to provide the transport helicopters with cover, would also be needed in a ratio of 1 : 2 3. Parliament deferred the issue until spring 1998, when an extensive discussion on defence policy began as to the purpose for which the helicopters were needed and whether there was a possiblity of more intense international defence cooperation behind the acquisition. Those negotiators of the political parties represented in the Government, i. e. the Social Democratic Party, The National Coalition Party, the Left Alliance, the Swedish Party and the Green League of Finland put forward a compromise solution FIM 1. 2 billion (202 million Euros) smaller than the original proposal, but this was not approved by the Members of Parliament. The Social Democrats in particular voiced the opinion that in the years of economic recession it had been necessary to cut back on social, health care and education costs in the Finnish economy, thus such measures should also be applied to defence costs. After further negotiations Parliament authorised the sum of FIM 6. 1 billion (1026 million Euros) with the appropriation for the helicopters now reduced to FIM 2. 2 billion (370 million Euros), namely 58 % of the sum proposed by the Ministry of Defence. The <b>decision</b> <b>authorised</b> the procurement of the helicopters, but their use was restricted to transportation functions and the acquisition of combat helicopters was not approved. This was the first occasion since the Second World War when Parliament intervened so decisively in the acquisitions of the defence administration. Throughout autumn 1997 and winter 1998 there was abundant debate in the media regarding the helicopters. One of the aims of the study is to estimate the effect of the public debate on the decision to curtail the acquisition and to review the more influential media. The responses to questionnaires to experts in spring 1998 and 1999 are also {{an important part of the}} data. The objective was to survey the opinions of those involved in decision-making on defence policy or exerting indirect influence on the division of labour between Parliament and the defence administration. For this purpose a questionnaire was posted in May 1998 to all Members of Parliament, the civil servants (also army officers) responsible for the preparation of the issue in the defence administration and in Parliament and the representatives of the media who had dealt with the acquisition of the helicopters. Respondents were requested to indicate whether they believed that the cutback decision taken by Parliament regarding the acquisition of helicopters had been successful, whether it enhanced the prestige of Parliament and whether there was confidence in the expertise of the decisions of the defence administration and the decisions taken by Parliament. Another important subarea was to survey opinions as to whether the respondents believed that there was a connection between the acquisition of the helicopters and cooperation between Finland and NATO and whether the respondents felt that there was a likelihood of Finland joining NATO. Opinions were further collected on Finland s non-ratification of the international Ottawa agreement on the banning of anti-personnel mines. A total of 253 people responded to the questionnaire in spring 1998, the average response rate being 59 %. The 1998 questionnaire drew responses from 57 % of Members of Parliament. Later, in March 1999 a similar but shorter, updated questionnaire was implemented among Members of Parliament elected or re-elected in the parliamentary elections of March 1999. The response rate was 44 % with 88 completed questionnaires. On both occasions respondents were requested to name the main influential people in security policy and the most influential media. Respondents were also asked whether what was written in the media had any effect on decision-making in defence policy. A total of 341 responses were received to expert questionnaires sent out on the basis of institutional position. Responses were cross-tabulated according to respondents background position, i. e. profession, political affiliation, and gender and they were further analysed using factor analysis and cluster analysis. A summary of the results permits the conclusion that the debate on the helicopters was generally expected to continue. A governmental proposal on the acquisition of escort helicopters in the next few years was expected by 87 % of respondents. Those respondents supporting the political centre and right wing were in favour of the escort helicopters, while most of the left wing and the Greens were opposed to them. Members of Parliament were of the opinion that the debate about the helicopters in spring 1998 had served to enhance parliamentary prestige, whereas in the opinion of the civil servants (army officers) it had been detrimental to parliamentary prestige. Female respondents expressed confidence in the ability of Parliament to estimate acquisitions of the Defence Forces. Female respondents, who accounted for 27 % of all respondents, were clearly more inclined to reduce military expenditure because it had been necessary to make cutbacks in other areas of society. It may be concluded from the results of the factor and cluster analyses that a few obvious basic traits could be identified among the respondents. The questionnaire of 1998 permitted the identification of five analytical categories. Those most firmly in favour of national defence continued to be the right wing and the politically unaligned. The civil servants (including army officers) of the defence administration fell into this category, which adheres fairly uniformly to the line of the national leadership. Another interesting and relatively new category identified in Finnish defence policy is that which places its faith in international defence solutions, namely the creation of a European crisis management system or NATO-centred defence and crisis management cooperation. This group included relatively many women, left wing supporters and Greens. A third category is that which has faith in both national defence and cooperation with NATO, and includes mostly the right wing and the politically unaligned. These respondents reported that Finland should acquire her own helicopters even though she may well join NATO in the future. Almost half of the media respondents fell into this category, thus in a mild generalisation one might state that journalists dealing with Finnish defence policy are fairly positively disposed towards the Defence Forces. The Government-Opposition axis is stressed in the objectives of the fourth category, and they were interested in increasing the opportunities of all political parties to exert influence over decision-making on defence policy. Mention should also be made of the group with a social orientation, which was composed mostly of Social Democrats and relatively most female respondents. The analytical categories formed in the 1999 survey were roughly the same as the 1998 groups described in greater detail. The conclusion which this study permits is that the tasks of the Finnish Defence Forces are felt to be more international than before. The participation of Finns in United Nations peacekeeping tasks for more than 40 years has laid a good foundation for their participation in crisis management operations. The next step will be the intensifying common foreign and security policy of the European Union, to which tasks of the Finnish Defence Forces will most probably be gradually accommodated...|$|R
