Our steel works, <b>as</b> <b>everybody</b> knows, are now idle because we have no work to do there.

I think you ought to consider these things fully and reflect whether the little work we can give you is not better than no work at all. I assure you when prices will warrant it we shall be very glad to pay wages in proportion.|$|E
500|$|As a 1930s road {{construction}} project, the bypass {{was built to}} then-contemporary standards, including at-grade crossings at Bar End and at Hockley. As time progressed, the bypass {{became more and more}} of a bottleneck as roads around it were improved to higher standards, particularly after the opening of the A33 Chandler's Ford Bypass in 1968 and the A34 King's Worthy Link the following year, which meant all long distance traffic, as opposed to merely that from London to Southampton, was using the bypass. Morgan Morgan-Giles described the bypass as [...] "utterly inadequate and dangerous, <b>as</b> <b>everybody</b> who lives in or near Winchester will agree. The accident figures are appalling. Therefore, a new motorway somewhere to relieve the traffic is urgently needed." [...] The crossing at Bar End was grade separated in 1973, but the junction at Hockley remained a key point of congestion.|$|E
500|$|The Beatles were {{introduced}} to cannabis by Bob Dylan in New York City in 1964.

[...] Evans was as affected by the drug <b>as</b> <b>everybody</b> else, so took {{a very long time}} to find a pencil and a piece of paper. The next morning Evans gave the sheet of paper to McCartney, which read that McCartney had dictated: [...] "There are seven levels!" [...] (of life, as he later explained). The Beatles attended [...] "The Night of 100 Stars" [...] at the London Palladium on 23 July 1964, and during the show Evans constantly supplied them with whisky and Coca-Cola, which he delivered to them balanced on a wooden oar he had found backstage.|$|E

500|$|Josquin's fame lasted {{throughout}} the 16th century, and indeed increased {{for several decades}} after his death. Zarlino, writing in the 1580s, was still using examples from Josquin in his treatises on composition; and Josquin's fame was only eclipsed after {{the beginning of the}} Baroque era, with the decline of the pre-tonal polyphonic style. During the 18th and 19th centuries Josquin's fame was overshadowed by later Roman School composer Palestrina, whose music was seen as the summit of polyphonic refinement, and codified into a system of composition by theorists such as Johann Fux; however, during the 20th century, Josquin's reputation has grown steadily, to the point where scholars again consider him [...] "the greatest and most successful composer of the age." [...] According to Richard Sherr, writing in the introduction to the Josquin Companion, addressing specifically the shrinking of Josquin's canon due to correction of misattributions, [...] "Josquin will survive because his best music really is as magnificent <b>as</b> <b>everybody</b> has always said it was." ...|$|E

Upon gaining {{possession}} of the ball, Michael fools around and intentionally acts stupid to tease the opponents, which results in Roy Anderson (David Denman) snatching the ball and scoring against Michael's team. Despite the fact that Michael {{is the one who}} foolishly lost the ball, he blames the scoring on his teammates' ineptitude. Jim switches with Michael on defense and defends Roy. As Jim begins to show his prowess at the game, Roy and Jim gradually become aggressive toward each other, with Pam Beesly (Jenna Fischer) looking on. At a crucial point in the game, Michael is accidentally hit in the face and claims it is a [...] "flagrant personal intentional foul". He pettily stops the game and declares the office winners since they were winning when the foul occurred. The warehouse finds the call unfair and Michael caves under pressure, conceding the victory to the warehouse staff. <b>As</b> <b>everybody</b> returns to work, Kevin demonstrates his excellent shooting skills.|$|E

Kimi Räikkönen was equally displeased, complaining about the rules concerning driving standards. Following his on-track battle with Max Verstappen, he demanded clarification on whether Verstappen's aggressive driving style was legal, saying: [...] "I just wanted to ask if it's OK when you are next to another car, at some point on the exit of the corner are you allowed to always push the other car up on the kerbs [...] Apparently it's fine.

500|$|In 1982 Sheldon Jaffery and Roy Torgeson {{met with}} Weinberg to propose taking over as licensees, but Weinberg {{decided not to}} pursue the offer. [...] The {{following}} year, Brian Forbes approached Weinberg with another offer. Forbes' company, the Bellerophon Network, was an imprint of a Los Angeles company named The Wizard. [...] Ashley reports that Weinberg was only able to contact Forbes by phone, and even that was not always reliable, so negotiations were slow. [...] Forbes' editorial director was Gordon Garb and the fiction editor was Gil Lamont; Forrest Ackerman also assisted, mainly by obtaining material to include. [...] There {{was a good deal}} of confusion between the various participants in the project: according to Locus, a science fiction trade journal, [...] "Ackerman says he has had no contact with publisher Forbes, does not know {{what will happen to the}} material he put together, and is as much in the dark <b>as</b> <b>everybody</b> else. [...] Lamont says that he is still renegotiating his contract and is not sure where he stands". The original plan was for the first issue to appear in August 1984, dated July/August, but before it appeared the decision was taken to change the contents, and a new, completely reset issue finally appeared at the end of the year, dated Fall 1984. [...] Even with this delay a final agreement had not yet been reached with Weinberg over licensing. [...] Only 12,500 copies were printed; these were sent to two distributors who both went into bankruptcy. [...] As a result, few copies were sold, and Forbes was not paid by the distributors. [...] Despite the financial setback, Forbes attempted to continue, and a second issue eventually appeared. [...] Its cover date was Winter 1985 but it was not published until June 1986. [...] Few copies were printed; reports vary between 1,500 and 2,300 in total. [...] Mark Monsolo was the fiction editor, but Garb continued as editorial director; Lamont was no longer involved with the magazine.|$|E

2500|$|While {{for most}} of its history the concept of Mestizo and Mestizaje has been lauded by Mexico’s {{intellectual}} circles, in recent times the concept has been target of criticism, with it's detractors claiming that it delegitimizes racist practices in Mexico under the idea of [...] “(Racism) Not existing here (Mexico), <b>as</b> <b>everybody</b> is Mestizo” the Mestizo ideology thus, has cemented a terrain of resistance in regards to social, politic and academic mobility around the theme of race in Mexico.

2500|$|While {{taking a}} {{traditional}} position on human sexuality, maintaining the Church's moral opposition to homosexual acts, John PaulII asserted {{that people with}} homosexual inclinations possess the same inherent dignity and rights <b>as</b> <b>everybody</b> else. In his book Memory and Identity {{he referred to the}} [...] "strong pressures" [...] by the European Parliament to recognise homosexual unions as an alternative type of family, with the right to adopt children. In the book, as quoted by Reuters, he wrote: [...] "It is legitimate and necessary to ask oneself if this is not perhaps part of a new ideology of evil, more subtle and hidden, perhaps, intent upon exploiting human rights themselves against man and against the family." [...] A 1997 study determined that 3% of the pope's statements were about the issue of sexual morality.|$|E
2500|$|Subsequently, both Reese and Alan Truscott {{published}} {{books on}} the scandal. Reese's book stated: [...] "The basis of the charge, <b>as</b> <b>everybody</b> knows, is that Schapiro and I communicated length in hearts to one another by means of illegal signals. If you want to support that charge by reference to the hands played, {{what you have to}} show is that a number of illogical, uncharacteristic, and implausible bids or plays were made that can be explained only on the basis that the players had improper knowledge of one another's hands." [...] It then goes on to argue for the logic of the pair's bidding and play on the various hands from the Olympiad. Truscott's book emphasizes the unlikelihood of the observed variations in finger signals being coincidental, or of such a large number of witnesses colluding to fabricate the evidence.|$|E
