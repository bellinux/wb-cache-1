5|$|The {{earthquake}} {{was among}} the first to be studied over a long term by the Chinese government. More than 40 Chinese seismologists, engineers, and geologists visited the disaster zone to conduct research into the cause and damage of the earthquake; some spending as much <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>year</b> collecting soil samples and recording other primary research evidence for future study. Such data was collected over a broad area of almost 1400 towns within the area.|$|E
5|$|The length time {{in which}} {{offspring}} stay with their mother varies, though it can last until the female's next calving. Likewise, calves may suckle for only a month or as long <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>year.</b> Females become sexually mature when they are four years old, while males become mature at four or five years. Spermatogenesis in male giraffes begins at {{three to four years}} of age. Males must wait until they are at least seven years old to gain the opportunity to mate.|$|E
5|$|As a whole, {{pinnipeds}} can {{be found}} in a variety of aquatic habitats, including coastal water, open ocean, brackish water and even freshwater lakes and rivers. Most species inhabit coastal areas, though some travel offshore and feed in deep waters off oceanic islands. The Baikal seal is the only freshwater species, though some ringed seals live in freshwater lakes in Russia close to the Baltic sea. In addition, harbor seals may visit estuaries, lakes and rivers and sometimes stay as long <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>year.</b> Other species known to enter freshwater include California sea lions and South American sea lions. Pinnipeds also use a number of terrestrial habitats and substrates, both continental and island. In temperate and tropical areas, they haul-out on to sandy and pebble beaches, rocky shores, shoals, mud flats, tide pools and in sea caves. Some species also rest on man-made structures, like piers, jetties, buoys and oil platforms. Pinnipeds may move further inland and rest in sand dunes or vegetation, and may even climb cliffs. Polar-living species haul-out on to both fast ice and drift ice.|$|E

5|$|Gestational period varies among bovids - while duiker {{gestation}} {{ranges from}} 120 to 150 days, gestation in African buffalo ranges from 300 to 330 days. Usually, a single offspring is born (twins are less frequent), {{and it is}} able to stand and run by itself within an hour of birth. In monogamous species, males assist in defending their young, {{but that is not the}} case in polygynous species. Most newborn calves remain hidden for a week to two months, regularly nursed by their mothers. In some bovid species the neonates start following about their mothers immediately or within a few days, as in the impala. Different bovids have different strategies for defence of juveniles. For instance, while wildebeest mothers solely defend their young, buffaloes exhibit collective defence. Weaning might occur as early as two months (as in royal antelope) or as late <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>year</b> (as in muskox).|$|E
5|$|Hunting with cheetahs {{became more}} {{prevalent}} toward the seventh centuryAD. In the Middle East, the cheetah would accompany the nobility to hunts in special seats behind saddles. Cheetahs {{continued to be}} associated with royalty and elegance in western Asia till as late as the 19th century. The first phase of taming would take several weeks, in which the cheetah would be kept tethered and made to get accustomed to human beings. Next, the cheetah would be tempted with food and trained to mount horses. Finally, its hunting instincts would be aroused by slaughtering animals before it. The whole process could take as long <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>year</b> to complete. In eastern Asia, the records are confusing as regional names for the leopard and the cheetah may be used interchangeably. The earliest depiction of cheetahs from eastern Asia dates back to the Tang dynasty (7th to 10th centuriesAD); paintings depict tethered cheetahs as well as cheetahs mounted on horses. Chinese emperors would use cheetahs, as well as caracals, as gifts. In the 13th and the 14th centuries, the Yuan rulers bought numerous caracals, cheetahs, and tigers from the western parts of the empire and Muslim merchants, in return for gold, silver, cash, and silk. According to the Ming Shilu, the subsequent Ming dynasty (14th to 17th centuries) continued this practice. The cheetah gradually entered Eurasia toward the 14th century, though they never became as popular as they had in the Middle East. The Mughal ruler Akbar the Great (1556–1605) is said to have kept as many as 1000 cheetahs. However, his son Jahangir wrote in his memoirs, Tuzk-e-Jahangiri, that only one of them gave birth to cubs. Mughal rulers trained cheetahs as well as caracals in a similar way as the West Asians, and used them to hunt gameespecially blackbuck. The rampant hunting severely affected the populations of wild animals.|$|E

25|$|Upon arrest, the {{individual}} is brought to a police station for processing and detained until a trial date is set. At the initial court hearing, which can be months or years after the arrest, the accused may retain an attorney at personal expense or be assigned a court-appointed attorney, although lawyers are not ensured access to their clients before trial. The individual is then tried in court, where a judge renders a verdict. Although the prison code provides for prompt access to family members, human rights organizations and families reported inconsistent application of the code, with some families waiting as long <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>year</b> to see relatives.

25|$|Haemaphysalis leporispalustris has a {{complete}} lifecycle where it completes {{the stages of}} egg, larva, nymph, and adult. After emerging from the egg, the rabbit tick finds a host and takes a blood meal during each life stage. Once the tick feeds, it drops to the ground to molt and then climbs back on its host and takes another meal. The rabbit tick may change hosts throughout this process, especially if the host is not a hare or rabbit. This life cycle can take as long <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>year,</b> especially in climates that are cold. The population of H. leporispalustris peaks {{during the summer and}} declines during the winter. Development of the rabbit ticks often occur at quicker rates at higher temperatures than in colder temperatures.|$|E

Monmouth College faculty frequently teach in these programs along {{with other members of the}} consortium including Carleton College, Grinnell College, and eleven other colleges.

25|$|The modern-day towers, {{which are}} fairly uniform in their construction, have an almost flat roof, with the {{perimeter}} being {{slightly higher than}} the center.

500|$|Filming {{of actors}} was {{completed}} in September 1967, and from June 1966 until March 1968 Kubrick {{spent most of his}} time working on the 205 special effects shots in the film.

Although this technique, known as [...] "held takes", resulted in a much better image, it meant exposed film would be stored for long periods of time between shots, sometimes as long <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>year.</b> In March 1968, Kubrick finished the 'pre-premiere' editing of the film, making his final cuts just days before the film's general release in April 1968.|$|E
