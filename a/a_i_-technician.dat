40|$|AbstractThe sweetpotato weevil, Cylas formicarius (F.) (Coleoptera: Brentidae), {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} pests of sweet potatoes in the world. With free trade between the United States and the U. S. -controlled Mariana Islands, C. formicarius has spread along with this commodity. Because of the cryptic nature of the larvae and nocturnal activity of the adults, and the cancellation of long-residual pesticides, this pest has become increasingly difficult to control. Therefore, the present study sought to explore and to compare the effectiveness of Metarhizium brunneum F 52 (90 ml <b>a.</b> <b>i.</b> /ha), Beauveria bassiana GHA (40 ml <b>a.</b> <b>i.</b> /ha), spinosad (90 g <b>a.</b> <b>i.</b> /ha), azadirachtin (1484 ml <b>a.</b> <b>i.</b> /ha), B. bassiana+M. brunneum (20 ml <b>a.</b> <b>i.</b> /ha+ 45 ml <b>a.</b> <b>i.</b> /ha), B. bassiana+azadirachtin (20 ml <b>a.</b> <b>i.</b> /ha+ 742 ml <b>a.</b> <b>i.</b> /ha), B. bassiana+spinosad (20 ml <b>a.</b> <b>i.</b> /ha+ 45 ml <b>a.</b> <b>i.</b> /ha), M. brunneum+azadirachtin (45 ml <b>a.</b> <b>i.</b> /ha+ 742 ml <b>a.</b> <b>i.</b> /ha) and M. brunneum+spinosad (45 ml <b>a.</b> <b>i.</b> /ha+ 45 grams <b>a.</b> <b>i.</b> /ha) in controlling this pest in both the laboratory and the field. The treatment with B. bassiana+M. brunneum was the most effective in reducing tuber damage by C. formicarius, producing the highest yields. The most adult cadavers were found in plots treated with the combination of two fungi. This combined fungal formulation appears to be appropriate for the practical control of C. formicarius on sweet potatoes...|$|R

40|$|A {{bioassay}} {{technique was}} developed to test the efficacy of insecticides against potato moth (Phthorimaea operculella (Zeller)) on tomatoes. The technique tested efficacy against both larvae in mines and neonate larvae {{that had not yet}} penetrated the leaf, and explained the failure of some insecticides to control P. operculella infestations in commercial tomato crops. Neonate larvae placed on leaves of potted plants several days before treatment provided larvae for testing of insecticides against larvae in mines; other neonates were placed on leaves after treatment to test efficacy against larvae yet to penetrate the leaf. The plants were sprayed with the candidate insecticides, held for 5 - 7 days, and larval mortality assessed. Chlorfenapyr (100, 200 g <b>a.</b> <b>i.</b> ha- 1) and abamectin (8. 1 g <b>a.</b> <b>i.</b> ha- 1) were effective against neonate larvae and larvae in mines.

They were accomplished in the harvests 2004 / 2005 and 2005 / 2006, surveys of use of insecticides through a questionnaire in 15 properties. Three experiments were developed in Chapadão do Sul (MS) city, in the period from January to December of 2005. The experimental design was randomized blocks with 8 treatments and 4 replicates (experiment 1 and 2) and 7 treatments and 4 replicates (experiment 3). The treatments in the experiment 1 were: 1) control; 2) methomyl (151 g <b>a.</b> <b>i</b> ha- 1); 3) lambdacyhalothrin (7. 5 g <b>a.</b> <b>i</b> ha- 1); 4) thiodicarb (160 g <b>a.</b> <b>i</b> ha- 1); 5) lufenuron (7. 5 g <b>a.</b> <b>i</b> ha- 1); 6) triflumuron (38. 4 g <b>a.</b> <b>i</b> ha- 1); 7) alphacypermethrin + teflubenzuron (12. 7 + 12. 7 g <b>a.</b> <b>i</b> ha- 1) and 8) spinosad (24 g <b>a.</b> <b>i</b> ha- 1). In the experiment 2, the following treatments were used: 1) control; 2) methomyl (151 g <b>a.</b> <b>i</b> ha- 1); 3) lambdacyhalothrin (7. 5 g <b>a.</b> <b>i</b> ha- 1); 4) chlorpyrifos (384 g <b>a.</b> <b>i</b> ha- 1); 5) spinosad (24 g <b>a.</b> <b>i</b> ha- 1); 6) triflumurom (28. 8 g <b>a.</b> <b>i</b> ha- 1); 7) lufenuron (15 g <b>a.</b> <b>i</b> ha- 1) and 8) thiodicarb (240 g <b>a.</b> <b>i</b> ha- 1). The treatments in the experiment 3, in the first and second application were respectively: 1) control; 2) thiodicarb and triflumurom (240 and 28. 8 g <b>a.</b> <b>i</b> ha- 1); 3) lambdacyhalothrin and lufenuron (7. 5 and 15 g <b>a.</b> <b>i</b> ha- 1); 4) alphacypermethrin and teflubenzuron (15 and 15 g <b>a.</b> <b>i</b> ha- 1); 5) metomil and novaluron (151 and 15 g <b>a.</b> <b>i</b> ha- 1); 6) alphacypermethrin + teflubenzuron (12. 7 + 12. 7 g <b>a.</b> <b>i</b> ha- 1) and 7) profenofos + lufenuron (150 + 15 g <b>a.</b> <b>i</b> ha- 1).

O objetivo foi avaliar a possibilidade de utilização do vírus de poliedrose nuclear (VPN), Baculovirus anticarsia, em mistura com subdosagens de inseticidas químicos no controle da lagarta da soja, Anticarsia gemmatalis (Hübner), quando a população do inseto ultrapassa o limite populacional para a aplicação do vírus sozinho. Foram feitas avaliações do número de lagartas vivas, do número de lagartas mortas pelo vírus, do percentual de desfolha e da produtividade das plantas de soja. Os resultados indicaram que o vírus associado a subdosagens de diflubenzurom (1, 25 g <b>i.</b> <b>a.</b> /ha), {{carbaril}} (48 g <b>i.</b> <b>a.</b> /ha), clorpirifós (36 g <b>i.</b> <b>a.</b> /ha), endossulfam (35 g <b>i.</b> <b>a.</b> /ha), permetrina (3 g <b>i.</b> <b>a.</b> /ha), profenofós (25 g <b>i.</b> <b>a.</b> /ha), tiodicarbe (17, 5 g <b>i.</b> <b>a.</b> /ha) e triclorfom (200 g <b>i.</b> <b>a.</b> /ha) foi tão eficiente quanto os inseticidas sozinhos, nas doses normais, diflubenzurom (15 g <b>i.</b> <b>a.</b> /ha), carbaril (200 g <b>i.</b> <b>a.</b> /ha), clorpirifós (180 g <b>i.</b> <b>a.</b> /ha), endossulfam (175 g <b>i.</b> <b>a.</b> /ha), permetrina (15 g <b>i.</b> <b>a.</b> /ha), profenofós (100 g <b>i.</b> <b>a.</b> /ha), tiodicarbe (70 g <b>i.</b> <b>a.</b> /ha) e triclorfom (200 g <b>i.</b> <b>a.</b> /ha) para o controle de altas populações da lagarta da soja. O vírus associado a subdosagem de Bacillus thuringiensis (125 g p. c. /ha) e B. thuringiensis sozinho na dosagem normal (500 g p. c. /ha) não foram eficientes. This {{work was}} carried out in 1989 / 90 crop growing season, in Cruz Alta, Rio Grande do Sul State, using results of five field experiments. The objective was to evaluate the effect of the nuclear polyhedrosis virus (NPV), Baculovirus anticarsia, associated with low dosage of insecticides in the control of soybean caterpillar, Anticarsia gemmatalis (Hübner), when the populadon exceeds the limits to apply the virus alone. The parameters evaluated were number of living larvae, number of larvae cadavers, percentage defolation and grain yield. Results indicated that the NPV associated with low dosage of diflubenzuron (1. 25 g <b>a.</b> <b>i.</b> /ha), carbaryl (48 g <b>a.</b> <b>i.</b> /ha), chlorpyriphos (36 g <b>a.</b> <b>i.</b> /ha), endosulfan (35 g <b>a.</b> <b>i.</b> /ha), permethrin (3 g <b>a.</b> <b>i.</b> /ha), profenophos (25 g <b>a.</b> <b>i.</b> /ha), thiodicarb (17. 5 g <b>a.</b> <b>i.</b> /ha) and tricholrphon (200 g <b>a.</b> <b>i.</b> /ha) was as efficient as diflubenzuron (15 g a. i/ha), carbaryl (200 g a. i/ha.), chlorpyriphos (180 g <b>a.</b> <b>i.</b> /ha). endosulfan (175 g <b>a.</b> <b>i.</b> /ha), permethrin (15 g <b>a.</b> <b>i.</b> /ha), profenophos (100 g a. i/ha), thiodicarb (70 g <b>a.</b> <b>i.</b> /ha) and trichlorphon (400 g a. i/ha) at full dosage in the control of the large populations of the soybean caterpillar.

40|$|An {{experiment}} {{was conducted in}} 1998 - 99 to study the efficacy of spring (April 30, 1998 and March 4, 1999) applications of Zorial 5 G (1, 1. 5, 2, 2. 5, and 3 lb <b>a.</b> <b>i.</b> /A), Treflan TRIO (2 lb <b>a.</b> <b>i.</b> /A), and Visor 2. SG (0. 25 and 0. 5 lb <b>a.</b> <b>i.</b> /A) on purple nutsedge control in alfalfa. The second half of split Zorial 5 G (1 + 1, 1. 5 + 1. 5, and 2 + 1 lb <b>a.</b> <b>i.</b> /A per year) and Treflan TRIO (2 + 2 lb <b>a.</b> <b>i.</b> /A per year) treatments were made each summer (September 8 and June 22). Purple nutsedge suppression on May 27, 1998 increased linearly as the rate of Zorial 5 G applied increased from 1. 5 to 3 lb <b>a.</b> <b>i.</b> /A. The degree of nutsedge suppression resulting from the initial spring Zorial 5 G applications increased with time, reached a maximum on August 4, 1998 (52 to 72 %), and declined later in the fall. Split spring and summer applications of Zorial 5 G at annual rates of 2 or 3 lb <b>a.</b> <b>i.</b> /A provided good (80 - 88 %) purple nutsedge suppression {{in the fall of}} the first year of this study although the single spring applications of 2 or 3 lb <b>a.</b> <b>i.</b> /A provided greater suppression in the spring and early summer. Similar to 1998, there was a slow increase in Zorial 5 G efficacy on purple nutsedge during the spring of 1999 with the single spring 1. 5 to 3 lb <b>a.</b> <b>i.</b> /A Zorial 5 G applications resulting in very good control (89 - 96 %) on June 22, 1999. The annual application rate of 1 lb <b>a.</b> <b>i.</b> /A Zorial 5 G resulted in only fair purple nutsedge control (at best 75 %) and was significantly worse than the other Zorial treatments. During June, July and August of 1999, {{there were no significant differences}} between treatments that received 1. 5, 2, 2. 5 or 3 lb <b>a.</b> <b>i.</b> /A Zorial in a single spring application. In addition, there were no significant differences in purple nutsedge control between treatments that received greater than 1. 5 lb <b>a.</b> <b>i.</b> /A in <b>a</b> single spring application versus treatments that received split applications of Zorial 5 G. Thus, the split 2 lb <b>a.</b> <b>i.</b> /A Zorial SG treatment and the two split 3 lb <b>a.</b> <b>i.</b> /A treatments were not significantly better than the single spring applications of 2 and 3 lb <b>a.</b> <b>i.</b> /A, respectively, during the second year of this study. To date, single applications of Visor 2. 5 G at 0. 25 and 0. 5 lb <b>a.</b> <b>i.</b> /A and the split Treflan TRIO treatment (2 + 2 lb <b>a.</b> <b>i.</b> /A per year) have provided poor purple nutsedge suppression in 1998 (0 - 25 %) and 1999 (0 - 5 %) ...|$|R
