5|$|Alan and Tequila {{discover}} a hidden {{passage in the}} hospital leading to Wong's arsenal. They are confronted by Mad Dog, who engages them. Wong arrives {{at the hospital and}} has all the patients, police officers and staff taken hostage. After fighting their way to the main lobby, Alan and Tequila liberate the kidnapped patients and police officers. Pang evacuates the lobby while police detective Teresa Chang (Teresa Mo) goes to the maternity ward to organize evacuating the babies. Alan and Tequila continue fighting gangsters until they find Mad Dog. While Tequila goes to assist Chang with the babies, Alan and Mad Dog find themselves in a standoff with a group of patients caught in the middle. They slowly put their guns down and offer the patients safe passage, until Wong appears and shoots them <b>all.</b> <b>An</b> enraged Mad Dog shoots Wong's gun out of his hand. Wong shoots and kills Mad Dog while Alan escapes.|$|E
5|$|Between 13 January and 3 April 1943, an {{estimated}} 500,000 Red Army soldiers {{took part in}} what {{was known as the}} Voronezh–Kharkov Offensive. In <b>all,</b> <b>an</b> estimated 6,100,000 Soviet soldiers were committed to the area, with another 659,000 out of action with wounds. In comparison, the Germans could account for 2,200,000 personnel on the Eastern Front, with another 100,000 deployed in Norway. As a result, the Red Army deployed around twice as many personnel as the Wehrmacht in early February. However, {{as a result of their}} over-extension and the casualties they had taken during their offensive, at the beginning of Manstein's counterattack the Germans could achieve a tactical superiority in numbers, including the number of tanks present—for example, Manstein's 350 tanks outnumbered Soviet armor almost seven to one at the point of contact, and were far better supplied with fuel.|$|E
5|$|Rhys tries {{unsuccessfully to}} get Robbie O'Brien (Shaun Goss) {{to quit the}} {{surgical}} program. He then turns his attention to Erin Salisbury (Elise Jansen) and plots to take her spot on the program instead. He pursues Erin romantically and tries to distract her away from her work, so she will be kicked off the program and he can take her place. Barber said the scheme sees Rhys at his manipulative best, he realises Erin is vulnerable and he strikes. Jansen told a writer for TV Week that Erin is a bit reluctant to accept when Rhys asks her out. She thinks that someone like Rhys would not normally be interested in her, but she is flattered by the attention. Jansen added Erin is unaware it is <b>all</b> <b>an</b> act. Kate realises what Rhys is doing and interferes with his plan. Barber explained that Kate's feelings about the matter means nothing to Rhys as his sole objective is {{to get into the}} program. He does not mind that Kate is appalled at Erin becoming a casualty of his scheme.|$|E

25|$|In December 1939, male Jews from Chełm, Poland aged between 16 and 60, {{were forced}} on a death {{march to the}} nearby town of Hrubieszów.

25|$|If {{the person}} cannot swallow at <b>all,</b> <b>an</b> esophageal stent may be {{inserted}} {{to keep the}} esophagus open; stents may also assist in occluding fistulas. A nasogastric tube {{may be necessary to}} continue feeding while treatment for the tumor is given, and some patients require a gastrostomy (feeding hole in the skin that gives direct access to the stomach). The latter two are especially important if the patient tends to aspirate food or saliva into the airways, predisposing for aspiration pneumonia.|$|E
25|$|Normally the {{steering}} shaft {{is connected to}} the engine directly, instead of the output from the transmission. This means it spins at a relatively narrow range of RPM compared to the main drive shaft. The steering shaft is split into two output shafts through a clutch system that allows the outputs to spin forward, backward, or not at <b>all.</b> <b>An</b> idler reverses the direction on one side, so they always spin in opposite directions.|$|E
25|$|Vedanta's Alumina Refinery in Lanjigarh was criticised by the Orissa State Pollution Control Board (the {{statutory}} {{environmental regulation}} body) for {{air pollution and}} water pollution in the area. According to Amnesty International, local people reported dust from the plant settling on clothes, crops and food. Vedanta officials claimed there was no dust pollution from the plant at <b>all.</b> <b>An</b> environmental inspection of the plant reported water pollution by the plant including increasing the pH value of the river Vamshadhara below the refinery and {{a high level of}} SPM in the stack emissions.|$|E

25|$|Though Oswald {{had wanted}} to attend Moscow State University, {{he was sent to}} Minsk to work as a lathe {{operator}} at the Gorizont Electronics Factory, which produced radios, televisions, and military and space electronics. Stanislau Shushkevich, who later became independent Belarus's first head of state, was also engaged by Gorizont at the time, and was assigned to teach Oswald Russian. Oswald received a government-subsidized, fully furnished studio apartment in a prestigious building and an additional supplement to his factory pay—all in <b>all,</b> <b>an</b> idyllic existence by working-class Soviet standards, though he was kept under constant surveillance.|$|E
25|$|In 1982, Beuys {{recorded}} a music video {{for a song}} he had written entitled “Sonne statt Reagan” which translates to “Sun, not Rain/Reagan” This was an anti-Reagan political piece that included some clever puns in German and continued to reinforce {{some of the key}} messages of Beuys' career—namely an extremely liberal, pacifist political attitude; a desire to perpetuate open discourse on art and politics; a refusal to sanctify his own image and ‘artistic reputation’ by only doing the kinds of work other people expected he would do; and above <b>all</b> <b>an</b> openness to exploring different media forms to get across the messages he wanted to convey. His continued commitment to the demystification and dis-institutionalization of the ‘art world’ was never more clear than it is here.|$|E
25|$|Most dry {{materials}} in combination have friction coefficient values between 0.3 and 0.6. Values outside this range are rarer, but teflon, for example, {{can have a}} coefficient as low as 0.04. A value of zero would mean no friction at <b>all,</b> <b>an</b> elusive property. Rubber in contact with other surfaces can yield friction coefficients from 1 to 2. Occasionally it is maintained that µ is always < 1, {{but this is not}} true. While in most relevant applications µ < 1, a value above 1 merely implies that the force required to slide an object along the surface is greater than the normal force of the surface on the object. For example, silicone rubber or acrylic rubber-coated surfaces have a coefficient of friction that can be substantially larger than 1.|$|E

25|$|A {{utilitarian}} view {{asserts that}} it is obligatory to steer to the track with one man on it. According to classical utilitarianism, such a decision would be not only permissible, but, morally speaking, the better option (the other option being no action at <b>all).</b> <b>An</b> alternate viewpoint is that since moral wrongs are already {{in place in the}} situation, moving to another track constitutes a participation in the moral wrong, making one partially responsible for the death when otherwise no one would be responsible. An opponent of action may also point to the incommensurability of human lives. Under some interpretations of moral obligation, simply being present in this situation and being able to influence its outcome constitutes an obligation to participate. If this is the case, then deciding to do nothing would be considered an immoral act if one values five lives more than one.|$|E
25|$|A heraldic stone {{escutcheon}} sculpted {{in relief}} showing his arms survives on the external {{wall of the}} parish church of St Giles in the Wood, North Devon, 3 miles north-east of Potheridge, above the private door to the north transept.

25|$|Bracton {{considered}} {{the case of}} when a tenant made a gift of frankalmoin - a gift of land to the Church. A wardship would be of no value at <b>all.</b> <b>An</b> escheat of the land (a reclamation of the land by the overlord) would allow the owner {{to take control of}} the land. But the act of placing the land in frankalmoin left it in the hands of a group of lawyers or others who allowed the use of the land by a Church organization. The overlord would have nominal control of the corporation which had never entered into a feudal homage arrangement. The corporation owed nothing to the overlord. Bracton was sympathetic to this arrangement. According to him the lord is not really injured. His rights to the land remain unscathed. It is true they have been significantly diminished. He had suffered damnum, but there had been no iniuria. Bracton was of the opinion that a gift of land to the Church could be voided by the heirs, but not the lord.|$|E
