50|$|Older <b>automatic</b> <b>washes</b> - a {{majority}} of which were built prior to 1980 - used to use brushes with soft nylon bristles, which tended to leave a nylon deposit {{in the shape of}} a bristle, called brush marks, on the vehicle's paint. Many newer washes use either cloth (which is not harmful to a car's finish, as long as it is flushed with plenty of water to remove the grit from previous washes) or a closed cell foam brush, which does not hold dirt or water, thus is far less likely to harm any painted finish. Closed cell foam brushes can, in fact, provide a gentle polishing effect that will shine the vehicle's surface during a wash.|$|R

40|$|Process Abstract. The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to develop an efficient washing system to remove cutting oil from machining part surface. The proposed washing system consists of two processes: the dipping process and the modified <b>automatic</b> ultrasonic <b>washing</b> process. The <b>automatic</b> ultrasonic <b>washing</b> process is redesigned and developed to reduce operating cost and increase productivity from the previously developed machine. For this proposed system, experiments have been performed to determine the washing conditions that yield satisfactory proportion of defectives due to oil contamination. Under the suggested operating conditions, the proportion of defectives due to oil contamination is reduced from 12. 8 % to 1. 78 %, which leads to $ 16, 800 defective cost reduction. The proposed washing system yields 42. 9 % increase in washing productivity. Furthermore, it as has more standard procedure than the current washing process...|$|R

50|$|In the UK {{and in most}} of Europe, {{electric}} {{washing machines}} did not become popular until the 1950s. This was {{largely because of the}} economic impact of World War II on the consumer market, which did not properly recover until the late 1950s. The early electric washers were single-tub, wringer-type machines, as fully <b>automatic</b> <b>washing</b> machines were extremely expensive. During the 1960s, twin tub machines briefly became very popular, helped by the low price of the Rolls Razor washers. Some machines had the ability to pump used wash water into a separate tub for temporary storage, and to later pump it back for re-use. This was done not to save water or soap, but because heated water was expensive and time-consuming to produce. <b>Automatic</b> <b>washing</b> machines did not become dominant in the UK until well into the 1970s and by then were almost exclusively of the front-loader design.|$|E
