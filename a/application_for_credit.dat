50|$|The act also {{contains}} provisions {{to help reduce}} identity theft, {{such as the ability}} for individuals to place alerts on their credit histories if identity theft is suspected, or if deploying overseas in the military, thereby making fraudulent <b>applications</b> <b>for</b> <b>credit</b> more difficult.

5000|$|Effective stoozing also {{relies on}} making {{successful}} applications for further credit. Each application made {{gives rise to}} a [...] "credit search" [...] in which the lender will examine the credit history (or [...] "credit file") of the borrower. Credit histories are shared between individual card issuers and the commercial credit reference agencies (CRAs) maintaining such files. In the UK the main CRAs used are Experian, Equifax and Callcredit; in the US they are Experian, Equifax, and TransUnion. In addition, regardless of whether an <b>application</b> <b>for</b> <b>credit</b> is successful, the fact that a search will have been made on a person's file is itself recorded and made known to future lenders. To maximize the chances of success, applications should ideally not be made too frequently.|$|E
5000|$|The {{information}} in a credit report is sold by credit agencies to organizations that are considering whether to offer credit to individuals or companies. It is also available to other entities with a [...] "permissible purpose", {{as defined by the}} Fair Credit Reporting Act. The consequence of a negative credit rating is typically a reduction in the likelihood that a lender will approve an <b>application</b> <b>for</b> <b>credit</b> under favorable terms, if at all. Interest rates on loans are significantly affected by credit history; the higher the credit rating, the lower the interest, while the lower the credit rating, the higher the interest. The increased interest is used to offset the higher rate of default within the low credit rating group of individuals.|$|E
50|$|In many countries, when a {{customer}} fills out an <b>application</b> <b>for</b> <b>credit</b> from a bank, credit card company, or a store, their information is forwarded to a credit bureau. The credit bureau matches the name, address and other identifying {{information on the}} credit applicant with information retained by the bureau in its files. The gathered records are then used by lenders to determine an individual's credit worthiness; that is, determining an individual's ability and track record of repaying a debt. The willingness to repay a debt is indicated by how timely past payments {{have been made to}} other lenders. Lenders like to see consumer debt obligations paid regularly and on time, and therefore focus particularly on missed payments and may not, for example, consider an overpayment as an offset for a missed payment.|$|E

The National Credit Act No. 34 of 2005 (NCA) was established in order to address these high levels. This study expands the limited research by investigating the NCA’s ability to reduce levels of over-indebtedness. The study employed quarterly data (2001 - 2013) in an OLS regression model in order to establish the determinants of over-indebtedness and assess the impact of the NCA. It was found that the macro-economic variables GDP, prime rate, property prices, consumer consumption expenditure, debt-to-disposable income and the level of unemployment were major contributors to the level of over-indebtedness. The NCA proved to have a positive significant effect on the levels of over-indebtedness, indicating that the NCA had not succeeded in its purpose of reducing the vulnerability of consumers to becoming over-indebted. The results suggest that the affordability assessment of the NCA must be improved in order to conduct a form of credit stress testing on consumers during their <b>application</b> <b>for</b> <b>credit...</b>|$|E
40|$|In November 2010 the Swedish {{government}} {{approved the}} abolishment legislative proposal of mandatory audit for small limited companies.

The {{aim of this study}} is to examine how this reform of mandatory audit had impact on the bank’s decision-making regarding the credit granting. In addition, it is also interesting to comprehend whether or not the audited financial reports increase the assurance and legitimacy of the company to bank and ease the process of lending credit or loan. However, both theoretical analysis and empirical findings of this study reveal that the absence of auditing have in somehow impact on the banks decision-making of credit granting, which banks sense difficulty and insecurity to evaluate the non-audited clients’ <b>application</b> <b>for</b> <b>credit</b> granting. Further, it might be claimed that the audited financial reports increase the assurance and legitimacy of the company; thereby banks can make the decision to grant credit or loan easier.

40|$|The paper {{considers}} a general approach for classifying objects using mathematical programming algorithms. The approach {{is based on}} optimizing a utility function, which is quadratic in indicator parameters and is linear in control parameters (which need to be identified). Qualitative characteristics of the utility function, such as monotonicity in some variables, are included using additional constraints. The methodology was tested with a "credit cards scoring" problem. Credit scoring {{is a way of}} separating specific subgroups in a population of objects (such as <b>applications</b> <b>for</b> <b>credit),</b> which have significantly different credit risk characteristics. A new feature of our approach is incorporating expert judgments in the model. For instance, the following preference was included with an additional constraint: “give more preference to customers with higher incomes. ” Numerical experiments showed that including constraints based on expert judgments improves the performance of the algorithm. Introduction. In this paper, we consider a general approach for classifying objects and explain it with credit cards scoring problem. Classification can be defined by a classification function assigning to each object some categorical value called the class number. However, this classificatio...|$|R
40|$|Everywhere the {{exercise}} of public power is being challenged by rising claims of privatization, not only of property and service provision but also of means of violence. In many areas, armies are attempting to expand their economic and political influence, while paramilitary formations, private armies and security forces proliferate. Not infrequently, such groups enter into connections with “mafias, ” able to employ extralegal force in operations that can range from supplying the drug trade to clearing people off land to make it available for alternative uses. All such violence-prone situations favor the emergence of armed entrepreneurs who attract followers and build group solidarity through quasi-military styles of cohesion, preparedness and discipline. For such groups, the National Socialist syndrome continues to furnish a ready prototype of ideas and modes of action, to be copied wholesale or varied according to circumstance.

40|$|Download {{the latest}} version] This paper studies the dynamic {{aggregate}} relationship between unemployment and consumer credit. First, using micro-level data I identify a consistent negative effect of unemployment on both a household’s use of {{and access to}} consumer credit. Upon job loss, households increase <b>applications</b> <b>for</b> <b>credit,</b> get denied more frequently, and experience significant reductions in both debt outstanding and average monthly charges. I interpret these effects as an increase in <b>credit</b> constraints <b>for</b> the unemployed and examine how this relationship impacts macroeconomic vari-ables over the business cycle. To do so, I extend the canonical Mortensen and Pissarides (1994) model of unemployment to include a goods market with search and financial frictions. House-holds have limited commitment in repaying debts and face endogenous borrowing constraints that are disciplined by the ability of lenders to enforce financial contracts. The model predicts that job loss {{is followed by a}} contraction in borrowing constraints. In the aggregate, this channel leads to a strategic complementarity between (un) employment and firm hiring incentives as a higher fraction of unemployed consumers decreases the expected revenue from a labor match. I calibrate the model to match the estimated fall in credit upon job loss and examine how these individual unemployment-credit shocks affect aggregate business cycles. I find that productivity shocks do a poor job of generating the co-movement of credit and unemployment we observe in the data. However, I find that aggregate financial shocks contribute significantly to the observed dynamics of both real and financial variables...|$|R
