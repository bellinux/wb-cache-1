In 1951 Michael Young, one of the architects of the Labour Party's electoral victory in 1945, {{observed}} that [...] "one suburb is much like another in an <b>atomised</b> society. Rarely does community flourish", while the American Lewis Mumford, wrote in the New Yorker in 1953 that [...] "monotony and suburbanism" [...] were the result of the [...] "unimaginative" [...] design of Britain's post-war New Towns. When the editor of the Architectural Review, J. M. Richards, wrote in The Castles on the Ground (1946) that [...] "for all the alleged deficiencies of suburban taste ... it holds for ninety out of a hundred Englishmen an appeal which cannot be explained away as some strange instance of mass aberration", he was, in his own words, [...] "scorned by my contemporaries as either an irrelevant eccentricity or a betrayal of the forward looking views of the Modern Movement".|$|E

In contrast {{a market}} economy <b>atomises</b> its agents by definition, the expectations which {{form the basis of}} their decisions are always based on uncertainty. There is a poverty of information which often leads to disequilibrium that can only be corrected in a market ex post (after the event), and thus resources are wasted. An advantage of antecedent planning is removal of significant degrees of uncertainty in a context of coordinated and unified information gathering and decision-making prior to the commitment of resources.|$|R

The flow and atomisation characteristics have been established and are discussed in terms of application to the gas turbine. It is apparent that savings in complexity, weight and hence cost of fuel systems may be achieved with drum atomisers, but these may be offset to some extent by the increased costs of full scale annular combustion chamber development...|$|R

50|$|This latter {{calculation}} is complex. To make gaseous ions from elements it {{is necessary}} to <b>atomise</b> the elements (turn each into gaseous atoms) and then to ionise the atoms. If the element is normally a molecule then we first have to consider its bond dissociation enthalpy (see also bond energy). The energy required to remove one or more electrons to make a cation is a sum of successive ionization energies; for example, the energy needed to form Mg2+ is the ionization energy required to remove the first electron from Mg, plus the ionization energy required to remove the second electron from Mg+. Electron affinity is defined as the amount of energy released when an electron is added to a neutral atom or molecule in the gaseous state to form a negative ion.|$|R
40|$|The {{spray forming}} process {{combines}} {{the benefits of}} rapid solidification processing with the cost advantages associated with near net shape processing. High pressure gas impinges on a stream of molten metal and <b>atomises</b> it into an array of fine droplets. The gas then accelerates these droplets towards a moving substrate where they are collected and a near net shaped preform is formed incrementally. Preforms may have billet, tube or strip geometries depending on {{the configuration of the}} substrate manipulation system. This paper will describe and discuss the key stages of the process of gas atomisation, droplet flight, deposition and microstructural evolution, and will highlight current knowledge and recent advances. It will also address the future directions of research and development. An important technological requirement, for instance, is increased yield through the reduction of over-sprayed powder and the control of preform shape. Of particular scientific interest is the evolution of the equiaxed grain structure typical of spray formed materials...|$|R

Such Surface Acoustic Wave (SAW) devices have also been shown to act as bio sensors but more sensitive detection is obtainable by the use of Film Bulk Acoustic Resonators (FBARs), the design and operation of which are described {{at the end of this}} review. Whilst the interaction of the acoustic wave with a fluid on its surface allows its rheological properties to be measured, such as viscosity, it is speculated that the combination of SAW and FBAR technologies may also provide new opportunities for rheometry on the microscale where fluids generally follow a non-Newtonian behaviour...|$|R

The thesis also demonstrated the advantages of combining a linear ToF detector and a mass resolved ReToF spectrometer for clarification of ionisation processes in the pulsed laser ablation regime of solid targets. The outstanding results show that during the ablation process, ZnO <b>atomises</b> into Zn and O. In the vacuum regime we have shown that at long distances from the target multiple charged states of Zn and O are present. While under the same conditions in an ambient gas the multiple charged states are not present, however the ambient gas undergoes an ionisation process.

40|$|A {{high speed}} digital {{analysis}} technique {{has been used}} to study the atomisation plume of a superheated sample of Ni–Al in a close coupled gas atomiser. The atomisation, incorporating a generic melt nozzle and die design was captured using a Kodak high speed digital analyser at a frame rate of 18 k frames per second. The resulting 65 536 frames were then analysed using a specially designed routine, which calculates values of optical brightness and position of the intensity maximum for all frames and performs Fourier analysis on the sequence. The data produced from this analysis show that the plume, pulses at low frequencies (< 25 Hz) and precesses at higher frequencies (∼ 360 Hz) around the atomiser's centreline. To aid investigation into the origins of this precession and other phenomena it was decided to conduct further experiments using an analogue system. The analogue atomiser reproduces the important features of the full atomiser but instead of atomising molten metal, the analogue system <b>atomises</b> water, providing a quick and easy way of testing the effects of changing parameters. Using this system {{it was found that the}} precession of the melt plume is independent of the atomiser's gas inlet pressure but strongly dependent on both the die and melt nozzle's geometry...|$|R

50|$|In this {{interview}} conducted in Cambridge, Massachusetts on December 3, 2004, Chomsky begins {{by stating that}} his analysis work is largely the detailed routine of finding and decoding the internalised assumptions of the educated elite and highlights this indoctrinated bias with {{the example of the}} attack on Social Security, which, he claims, is intended to undermine solidarity and <b>atomise</b> the population so that they are easy to control. He points out that the elite media (e.g., BBC and New York Times) and the business press (e.g., Wall Street Journal and Financial Times) have a duty to report the facts to their primary constituency (economical, political and doctrinal managers) and {{all he has to do}} is deconstruct the doctrinal slant to discover the truth. These techniques of intellectual self-defense are, he claims, essential for people to understand their power over governments, which relies on their consent to govern and he uses the example of the changing role of women in modern society to demonstrate how the questioning of these underlying biases can lead to real social change. He concludes that these movements do not necessarily have to come from the oppressed but in fact oppressors who realise their guilt and more importantly attempt to do something about it can be even more effective.|$|R
40|$|Bibliography: leaves. [141 - 145]. This {{thesis is}} {{a case study of}} the social {{relations}} of power within the canning industry in Ashton. The project had three main aims: 1) to document the physical situation at the two canning factories in Ashton, in order to profile the basic composition of the workforce, aspects of the labour process and working and employment conditions; 2) to examine the processes and mechanisms of control and then 3) to use the first two aims as a basis to take stock of what this control means in terms of workers lives: i. e. examining the lived experience of 'control'. I adopted a primarily qualitatively focused approach and used a combination of interviews and group discussions to elicit the information necessary to inform these aims. The results showed how in the logic of capitalist development, pre-existing social divisions are exploited. The interaction of these pre-existing social divisions within the structure of the workforce, combined with deliberate control mechanisms serves to divide, <b>atomise</b> and thereby control the workforce. I found the workers to be divided by gender and race, these divisions are intensified by differences between whether workers have seasonal or permanent employment and where they live. These divisions, aggravated by differences, are then combined with the deliberate use of piecework, the assembly line and the factories recruitment system. Workers experienced most of these control mechanisms as normal and natural and are mostly thankful to have work...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the suitability of commercial jet and ultrasonic nebulisers for effective delivery of the model hydrophilic protein lactate dehydrogenase (LDH). Two jet nebulisers (Pari LC Plus and Pari LC Star) and two ultrasonic nebulisers (Sonix 2000 and Omron U 1) were used to nebulise LDH solutions and the effects on protein activity and protein concentration determined. The size distribution of the aerosols produced, measured by laser diffraction analysis, temperature changes during nebulisation, the time to <b>atomise</b> a 5 ml dose volume and the mass output of the four nebulisers were compared. A twin impinger (TI) was used to collect the nebulised protein, which was assayed for total and active protein content. There was a large variation in the median size and size distribution of the aerosols produced by each of the nebulisers from LDH and Sørensen's modified phosphate buffer, and in the time taken to reach the sputtering phase of aerosolisation. During use, the concentration of LDH increased in the Omron U 1 nebuliser, but did not change significantly in the others. The temperature of the protein solution decreased by approximately 8 °C during jet nebulisation but increased by 3 and 10 °C in the Omron U 1 and Sonix 2000 nebulisers, respectively. Denaturation of LDH within the nebuliser reservoir, occurred in the order Sonix>Pari LC Plus>Pari LC Star>Omron U 1, whilst the deposition of active and total protein within the stages and throat of the TI was a function of the particle size of the aerosols generated and the specific device used...|$|R
