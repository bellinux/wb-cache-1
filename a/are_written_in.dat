5|$|All {{movements}} <b>are</b> <b>written</b> <b>in</b> D major, but Reger often modulates. The movements follow {{each other}} without a break. A short instrumental introduction, marked , {{leads to the}} fourth movement. Reger achieves a unity of form by including material (both text and music) from the first movement to the later ones.|$|E
5|$|All recipes <b>are</b> <b>written</b> <b>in</b> the second-person {{singular}} imperative, a grammatical {{form that}} would not have been used to address a person of high rank. The instructions were most likely meant to be read aloud by the chef or one of senior cooks to junior members of the kitchen staff, who would carry them out. This style contrasts with the less direct, impersonal way of addressing the reader, characterized by infinitive verb forms, used in 19th-century Polish cookbooks.|$|E

5000|$|The text <b>is</b> <b>written</b> {{according}} {{to the use of}} Paris. The principal Latin text <b>was</b> <b>written</b> <b>in</b> Gothic script by two scribes. The first scribe has a somewhat unskilled hand; the second has a clear, elegant Parisian hand. The calendar text <b>was</b> <b>written</b> <b>in</b> red, gold, and blue ink, depending on the particular feast. The Gospels <b>were</b> <b>written</b> <b>in</b> alternating lines in blue, gold, and red inks. The text specific to the liturgical hours <b>was</b> <b>written</b> <b>in</b> Latin with black, and rarely blue, ink. In the margins, the Bible moralisée <b>is</b> <b>written</b> <b>in</b> Old French with black ink.|$|R

5|$|As {{with other}} forms {{with a long}} history in many languages, many {{variations}} have been developed, including forms with a quasi-musical poetic diction in Urdu. Ghazals have a classical affinity with Sufism, and a number of major Sufi religious works <b>are</b> <b>written</b> <b>in</b> ghazal form. The relatively steady meter {{and the use of the}} refrain produce an incantatory effect, which complements Sufi mystical themes well. Among the masters of the form is Rumi, a 13th-century Persian poet.|$|E

5|$|Films {{from the}} former Yugoslavia <b>are</b> <b>written</b> <b>in</b> both Latin and Cyrillic {{due to the fact}} that the {{previously}} official Serbo-Croatian language used both alphabets. Chinese film titles are romanized according to the pinyin system, and are written using the characters employed in their submitting country, i.e. traditional Chinese ones for films submitted by Hong Kong and Taiwan, and simplified Chinese ones for films submitted by the People's Republic of China.|$|E

5|$|The {{following}} list is sorted alphabetically by default, {{with further}} sorting capability in certain fields; owing to differing naming conventions between cultures, not all entries are sorted by last name.

The names of persons credited with an abbreviated name <b>are</b> <b>written</b> <b>in</b> full, where available.|$|E

Other old sources include Nihon Ryōiki (810–824) and Wamyō Ruijushō (c. 934). These oldest sources <b>are</b> <b>written</b> <b>in</b> Man'yōgana which clearly identifies the historical spelling as ki1tune. Following several diachronic phonological changes, this becomes kitsune.|$|E
