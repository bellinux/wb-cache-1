Midway through the campaign Gould had promised him a new two-year contract, but following the poor end to the season he instead opted to release Allardyce.|$|E

25|$|Defensive midfielders require good {{positional}} sense, work rate, tackling ability, and anticipation (of {{player and}} ball movement) to excel. They {{also need to}} possess good passing skills and close control to hold the ball in midfield under sustained pressure. Most importantly, defensive midfielders require great stamina as they are the outfield players who cover the greatest distance during a professional match. In top football clubs, a midfielder may cover up to 12 kilometres for a full 90-minute game. Deep-lying playmakers typically require <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>first</b> touch under opposition pressure {{and the ability to}} play long crossfield passes to attacking players further upfield.|$|E

When the line became popular with tourists, the travel conditions were improved {{in order to make}} <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>first</b> impression to dignitaries and aristocrats from all over Europe.

He enjoyed <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>first</b> season with Villa and he became a fan favourite. His abilities caught the interest of Arsenal and Newcastle United. With the arrival of Olof Mellberg, the duo {{became one of the}} most talented central-defensive partners in Europe. The partnership was cut short as Alpay injured his ankle which sidelined him for the remainder of the season. He recovered just in time for the 2002 World Cup, in which he formed the core of an obstinate Turkish defensive unit. They finished third and he was elected into the team of the tournament.|$|E

Romney was nominated in August and chose Congressman Paul Ryan, a young advocate of drastic budget cuts, as his running mate. Throughout the summer polls showed a close race and Romney had <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>first</b> debate, but otherwise had trouble reaching out to ordinary voters. He lost to Obama 51% to 47% and instead of gaining in the Senate as expected, Republicans lost seats.|$|E
25|$|In 2003, Schumacher again {{competed with}} Williams {{alongside}} Montoya.

Schumacher backed up the results by taking consecutive victories in the European Grand Prix and the French Grand Prix. He managed to finish in 9th-place in Britain. At the German Grand Prix, Schumacher retired on the first lap of the race after a collision with Rubens Barrichello and Kimi Räikkönen, for which he received a 10-place grid penalty for the next race. Williams successfully appealed against the decision and Schumacher managed to qualify 2nd for the Hungarian Grand Prix, where he finished 4th.|$|E

Jamaica won the event in a world leading time of 38.33s, ahead of USA Red and USA Blue teams respectively. He stated after the run that he was in good shape and was looking forward to do great things in the year ahead. Powell next ran the 200m at the Jamaica International Invitational Meet on 7 May. He looked promising in the first 120m, after which he slowed down drastically, finishing in last place with a time of 21.40s, in a race won by Jamaican Nickel Ashmeade. He later stated that he felt a minor pain in his hamstring and he backed off as a precaution, but insisted that it was nothing serious.|$|E
