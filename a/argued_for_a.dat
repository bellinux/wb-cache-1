5|$|President Smetona {{received}} memoranda {{from nine}} nationalistic organizations urging {{the government to}} reject the ultimatum. However, a decisive comment was made by General Stasys Raštikis, {{the commander of the}} Lithuanian army: He testified that a military victory over Poland was impossible and <b>argued</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> peaceful resolution. The government's decision was confirmed by the Fourth Seimas with minimal discussion. On March 19, Dailidė relayed acceptance of the ultimatum to the Poles, who gave a 12-hour extension to decide on the ultimatum as a show of good faith.|$|E
5|$|The 1840s were a {{turbulent}} decade in the Church of England. Following the earlier German Higher Critics, who <b>argued</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> historical approach to religious texts, David Strauss published Leben Jesu or The Life of Jesus, Critically Examined which {{argued that the}} events of the New Testament were not historical but rather mythical. In 1846 George Eliot published an English translation of Leben Jesu which became a source of religious doubts for Froude and many of his contemporaries. Critics have also identified Thomas Carlyle's novel Sartor Resartus and Spinoza as sources of Sutherland's doubts, and those of many of his contemporaries.|$|E

5|$|The Australian Broadcasting Authority's response, titled Digital Terrestrial Television Broadcasting, {{recommended}} that the Australian Government support the early introduction of digital broadcasting as a free-to-air service with the loan of a 7MHz channel for each broadcaster, in order to enable high-definition television from the outset. The Federation of Australian Commercial Television Stations supported this, as well as freedom for its members to launch multi-channel services. At the same time, the Australian Subscription Television and Radio Association, questioned the commercial viability of HDTV, was opposed {{to the idea of}} multi-channeling, and <b>argued</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> competitive system that would allow the entry of new players.|$|E
5|$|The two {{principal}} drafters and {{architects of the}} covenant of the League of Nations were Lord Robert Cecil (a British diplomat), and Jan Smuts (a South African statesman). Smuts' proposals included {{the creation of a}} Council of the great powers as permanent members and a non-permanent selection of the minor states. He also proposed the creation of a Mandate system for captured colonies of the Central Powers during the war. Cecil focused on the administrative side, and proposed annual Council meetings and quadrennial meetings for the Assembly of all members. He also <b>argued</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> large and permanent secretariat to carry out the League's administrative duties.|$|E
5|$|As the Allied victory {{began to}} look certain, Keynes was heavily involved, {{as leader of the}} British {{delegation}} and chairman of the World Bank commission, in the mid-1944 negotiations that established the Bretton Woods system. The Keynes-plan, concerning an international clearing-union, <b>argued</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> radical system for the management of currencies. He proposed the creation of a common world unit of currency, the bancor, and new global institutions – a world central bank and the International Clearing Union. Keynes envisaged these institutions managing an international trade and payments system with strong incentives for countries to avoid substantial trade deficits or surpluses. The USA's greater negotiating strength, however, meant that the final outcomes accorded more closely to the more conservative plans of Harry Dexter White. According to US economist J. Bradford DeLong, on almost every point where he was overruled by the Americans, Keynes was later proved correct by events.|$|E

5|$|Ever {{since the}} victory against an Egyptian army at the Battle of Tel-el-Kebir, the {{standard}} British tactic against an entrenched position was an approach march {{at night in}} close order to maintain cohesion, followed by deployment into open order within {{a few hundred yards}} of the objective and a frontal attack with the bayonet at first light. Methuen planned to bombard the Boer positions with artillery from 16:50 to 18:30 on 10 December. Following the barrage, the newly arrived Highland Brigade under Major General Wauchope was to make a night march that would position them to launch a frontal attack on the Boers at dawn the following day. Wauchope had <b>argued</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> flanking attack along the Modder River, but had been unable to convince his superior.|$|E
5|$|In 1884 the DF renamed {{itself the}} Social Democratic Federation (SDF) and {{underwent}} an internal reorganisation. However, {{the group was}} facing an internal schism between those (such as Hyndman), who <b>argued</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> parliamentary path toward socialism, and those (like Morris) who deemed the Houses of Parliament intrinsically corrupt and capitalist. Personal issues between Morris and Hyndman were exacerbated by their attitude to British foreign policy; Morris was staunchly anti-imperialist while Hyndman expressed patriotic sentiment encouraging some foreign intervention. The division {{between the two groups}} developed into open conflict, with the majority of activists sharing Morris' position. In December 1884 Morris and his supporters – most notably Ernest Belfort Bax and Edward Aveling – left the SDF; the first major schism of the British socialist movement.|$|E
5|$|Other {{difficulties}} arose {{when the}} Empire's parliament, the General Assembly, opened in 1826. PedroI, {{along with a}} significant percentage of the legislature, argued for an independent judiciary, a popularly elected legislature and a government which would be led by the emperor who held broad executive powers and prerogatives. Others in parliament <b>argued</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> similar structure, only with a less influential role for the monarch and the legislative branch being dominant in policy and governance. The struggle over whether the government would be dominated by the emperor or by the parliament was carried over into debates from 1826 to 1831 on the establishment of the governmental and political structure. Unable to deal with the problems in both Brazil and Portugal simultaneously, the Emperor abdicated on behalf of his son, PedroII, on 7 April 1831 and immediately sailed for Europe to restore his daughter to her throne.|$|E

5|$|Perturbed {{by those}} who betrayed fellow members to the French and the {{problems}} this behaviour caused, Học convened a meeting to tighten regulations in mid-1929 at the village of Lac Dao, along the Gia Lam–Haiphong railway. This was also the occasion for a shift in strategy: Học <b>argued</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> general uprising, citing rising discontent among Vietnamese soldiers in the colonial army. More moderate party leaders believed this move to be premature, and cautioned against it, but Học's stature meant he prevailed in shifting the party's orientation towards violent struggle. One of the arguments presented for large-scale violence was that the French response to the Bazin assassination meant that the party's strength could decline in the long term. The plan was to provoke a series of uprisings at military posts around the Red River Delta in early 1930, where VNQDD forces would join Vietnamese soldiers in {{an attack on the}} two major northern cities of Hanoi and Haiphong. The leaders agreed to restrict their uprisings to Tonkin, because the party was weak elsewhere.|$|E
5|$|Puritans {{believed}} that God is sovereign {{over all of}} history and nature and that none of what were called his decrees would be frustrated. There was significant debate in the Assembly over the relationship of God's decree of predestination, or choice to save some people, to the redemption purchased by Christ's death. Many of the Reformed during this period taught that Christ died with the purpose only to save those who were eternally chosen to be saved, a doctrine called particular redemption. A vocal minority of the divines of the Assembly <b>argued</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> position known as hypothetical universalism. Edmund Calamy held such a view, and he argued that Christ's death, as well as saving {{those who had been}} chosen, offered salvation to all people on condition that they believe. The Assembly's Confession did not teach such a view, and its language is much more amenable to a particular redemption interpretation, but there is a general agreement among scholars that the Confession's language allows an hypothetical universalist interpretation.|$|E
5|$|Rommel {{believed}} that Germany's best chance {{was to stop}} the invasion at the shore. He requested that the mobile reserves, especially tanks, be stationed {{as close to the}} coast as possible. Rundstedt, Geyr, and other senior commanders objected. They {{believed that}} the invasion could not be stopped on the beaches. Geyr <b>argued</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> conventional doctrine: keeping the Panzer formations concentrated in a central position around Paris and Rouen and deploying them only when the main Allied beachhead had been identified. He also noted that, in the Italian Campaign, the armoured units stationed near the coast had been damaged by naval bombardment. Rommel's opinion was that, because of Allied air supremacy, the large-scale movement of tanks would not be possible once the invasion was under way. Hitler made the final decision, which was to leave three Panzer divisions under Geyr's command and give Rommel operational control of three more as reserves. Hitler took personal control of four divisions as strategic reserves, not to be used without his direct orders.|$|E

5|$|The Nordland Line {{was first}} {{publicly}} proposed by Ole Tobias Olsen {{in a letter}} to the editor in Morgenbladet in 1872, where he <b>argued</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> railway between Trondheim and his home county of Nordland. The same year, Nord-Trøndelag County Council voted in favor to start planning of a railway between Trondheim and Namsos. The county council appointed a railway committee in 1875, who on 23 August 1876 published a report to encourage national authorities to consider the line, which resulted in surveying starting in 1877. On 27 April 1881, the committee made its recommendation to the county council and ceased its work. No planning was done the next three years, until three county councilors, Vilhelm Andreas Wexelsen, Peter Theodor Holst and Bernhard Øverland, made a new proposal. However, it was not until 1889 that the county council appointed a new railway committee, which was led by Wexelsen.|$|E
5|$|The jury deliberated for 23hours. On June 2, 1997, McVeigh {{was found}} guilty on 11counts of murder and conspiracy. Although the defense <b>argued</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> reduced {{sentence}} of life imprisonment, McVeigh was sentenced to death. In May 2001, the Justice Department announced that the FBI had mistakenly failed to provide over 3,000documents to McVeigh's defense counsel. The Justice Department also announced that the execution would be postponed for one month for the defense to review the documents. On June 6, federal judge Richard Paul Matsch ruled the documents would not prove McVeigh innocent and ordered the execution to proceed. After President George W. Bush approved the execution (McVeigh was a federal inmate and federal law dictates that the President must approve the execution of federal prisoners), he was executed by lethal injection at the Federal Correctional Complex, Terre Haute in Terre Haute, Indiana, on June 11. The execution was transmitted on closed-circuit television so that the relatives of the victims could witness his death. McVeigh's execution was the first federal execution in 38years.|$|E
