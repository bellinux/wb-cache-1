Though {{she does not}} agree with him, she does find him a small stick {{to use as a}} defense. It is Nancy who comes {{up with the idea of}} lying down in a submissive posture when Leslie and Sarah come near. Charlie follows Nancy's directions in most of the dealings with the lizards. After it becomes clear that the lizards will not harm them, Nancy is excited by their presence. She does everything she can to learn about them and make a connection with them. She wants to shake hands with them first.|$|E
500|$|The {{episode was}} {{generally}} well received among television critics. Prior to broadcast, E! Online Jennifer Godwin expressed her fear: [...] " [...] <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>afraid</b> that Iz is just stopping by to break Alex's heart before vanishing again." [...] After the episode aired, TV Fanatic Steve Marsi {{noted that the}} argument between Shepherd and Meredith [...] "didn't work", calling him [...] "aggressive". Marsi also commented on Oh's performance: [...] "Incredible performance by Sandra Oh as always. You can see the inner turmoil even when few or no words are exchanged, forgetting you're watching an actress. Simply amazing." [...] BuzzSugar called Sloan's inability to forgive Lexie [...] "an unexpected twist", and referred to the tensions between Yang, Hunt, and Altman as [...] "awkward".|$|E
500|$|Soon {{after the}} book's publication, Potter's ageing Mrs. Tiggy began {{showing signs of}} failing health. She wrote a friend on February 1, 1906, [...] "I am sorry to say I am upset about poor Mrs. Tiggy. She hasn't seemed well the last fortnight, and {{has begun to be}} sick, and she is so thin. I am going to try some physic but I am <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>afraid</b> that the long course of unnatural diet and indoor life is {{beginning}} to tell on her. It is a wonder she has lasted so long. One gets very fond of a little animal. I hope she will either get well or go quickly." [...] A few weeks later Potter chloroformed her beloved hedgehog and laid her to rest in the garden at the Potter family home at 2 Bolton Gardens, Kensington.|$|E

500|$|Grizzly Rage {{was filmed}} in Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada. It breaks from the {{standard}} mold many natural horror films follow in that the bear attacking the main characters is not a mutant or genetically altered, rather it is a normal, but furious mother bear. The mother bear is played by Koda, a [...] male grizzly bear, working {{at the direction of}} a trainer. To induce the bear to appear to be roaring, the trainer gave it marshmallows to make it smile. The roaring sounds were dubbed in later. Both Tyler Hoechlin and Graham Kosakoski noted that they were <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>afraid</b> of the bear and director David DeCoteau felt that working with such a powerful live animal added element of danger for the cast and crew during filming. As such, the bear is never actually filmed together with any of the actors. For scenes where the bear is supposed to interact with the characters, a man in a bear suit takes over the role.|$|E
500|$|After {{the large}} {{success of the}} demo version, Yankovic wanted to put the song {{on one of his}} albums. However, the immensely complex process of getting {{permission}} from George Lucas and the publishers of the Kinks' [...] "Lola" [...] delayed the release of the song for about five years. Eventually, after Lucas gave Yankovic permission, the song's publishers turned Al down. [...] Several versions of why the parody was turned down exist. In a 1985 interview with Spin, Yankovic explained that, [...] "We approached Ray Davies , we've been approaching him every year and a half, two years before each album comes out and he's always been a little skeptical, <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>afraid</b> because 'Lola' was a very personal song for him. Then just out of the blue he decided this time to let us do it." [...] However, the liner notes to the [...] present a different story. According to the album's notes, the song may have remained unreleased for some time {{had it not been for}} a chance encounter Yankovic had with the song's original songwriter, Ray Davies. When Yankovic asked why he hadn't given him permission, Davies remarked that he had never been asked. Davies immediately gave Yankovic permission to record the song, and the song was later released on Dare to Be Stupid.|$|E
500|$|Jesse Eisenberg's {{breakthrough}} {{starring role}} was in Zombieland. The horror-comedy, which saw him with Woody Harrelson, Emma Stone, and Abigail Breslin on a roadtrip through a post-zombie apocalypse America, was a sleeper hit. In 2010, he portrayed Facebook creator Mark Zuckerberg {{in the film}} The Social Network, for which he earned the Best Actor Award from the National Board of Review of Motion Pictures, and nominations for Best Actor at the BAFTA Awards, Golden Globes, and Academy Awards. According to the film's director, David Fincher, both he and screenwriter Aaron Sorkin knew Eisenberg was the one for the role {{as soon as they}} watched his audition tape, despite Eisenberg's own anxieties about his audition. On November 22, 2010, Eisenberg was honored, along with Whoopi Goldberg, Joycelyn Engle, and Harvey Krueger, at the Children at Heart Celebrity Dinner Gala and Fantasy Auction, to benefit the children of the Chernobyl disaster. Steven Spielberg is Chair of the event each year. On January 29, 2011, Eisenberg hosted Saturday Night Live on NBC, with musical guest Nicki Minaj. During his opening monologue, Zuckerberg himself appeared. Eisenberg said that meeting the man he portrayed on-screen was [...] "an overwhelming experience," [...] and was happy that [...] "we were both able to have fun at the situation." [...] Zuckerberg, who has been a vocal disser on the artistic licenses taken by The Social Network, would later say that he thought Eisenberg [...] "was <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>afraid</b> to meet me after his portrayal, but I tried to be nice." ...|$|E

[...] He said, [...] "Then do the part". And I did and I'm very {{grateful}} to him.|$|E
2500|$|The {{writing is}} also notable for its minimal use of dialogue. Josh Brolin {{discussed}} his initial nervousness with having so little dialogue to work with: I {{mean it was}} a fear, for sure, because dialogue, that's what you kind of rest upon as an actor, you know? [...] Drama and all the stuff is all dialogue motivated. You {{have to figure out}} different ways to convey ideas. You don't want to overcompensate because the fear is that you're going to be boring if nothing's going on. You start doing this and this and taking off your hat and putting it on again or some bullshit that doesn't need to be there. So yeah, I was <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>afraid</b> of that in the beginning.|$|E
2500|$|Physically, Clark {{was tall}} and thin, and in his {{personal}} life he was intensely private. Fagan described him as [...] "an imposing, remote man who hid his feelings", while presenting [...] "an austere, sometimes forbidding exterior". Coles similarly regarded him as aloof figure, but nevertheless {{thought that he was}} [...] "basically a sympathetic and kind man". Clark was awkward around his students, who were often <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>afraid</b> of him. His lecture style was regarded as dry and not entertaining. Clark's biographer noted that his teaching was [...] "at best pedestrian", and that he had a [...] "reputation for poorly prepared lectures", rendering him unpopular as a teacher. According to Coles, Clark's lectures [...] "were generally considered to be rather poorly constructed, and he often wandered from the subject in hand". On several cases he was reported to have given the wrong lecture to a class.|$|E

60|$|She {{was perhaps}} {{the only person in}} the world who was not just <b>a</b> <b>little</b> bit <b>afraid</b> of Kirsteen.
