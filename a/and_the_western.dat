5|$|A {{number of}} {{countries}} expressed concern about unliveable conditions, with The Times of India reporting that the Scottish delegation apparently submitted {{a photograph of a}} dog defecating on a bed in the Games Village. Secretary general of the Organising Committee Lalit Bhanot countered the complaints of poor sanitation when he claimed that cultural differences accounted for differing standards of cleanliness in India <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>western</b> world. He was subsequently ridiculed by both the Indian and international media.|$|E

5|$|As a state highway, M-44 {{dates back}} to around July 1, 1919, and it was routed along a section of its modern route at that time. The eastern end was altered in the late 1920s, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>western</b> end was {{extended}} to the Grand Rapids area in the 1970s. For over 20years, M-44 was truncated to remove the M-37 concurrency. Since 2003 though, the highway has terminated at the intersection with 28th Street.|$|E
5|$|Because of the colder climate, ectothermic {{reptiles}} {{are all but}} absent, {{with two}} species of garter snake <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>western</b> painted turtle being the only three reptile species proven to exist.

After a forest fire in 2001, a few park roads were temporarily closed the following year to allow thousands of western toads to migrate to other areas.|$|E
5|$|Camouflage is an {{important}} defense strategy enabled by changes in body shape, colour and markings. Some lepidopterans blend with the surroundings, making them difficult to be spotted by predators. Caterpillars can be shades of green that match their host plant.
