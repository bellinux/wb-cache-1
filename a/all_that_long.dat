2500|$|After President Kennedy's brother, Robert Kennedy, {{boarded the}} plane, Kennedy's casket {{was removed from}} the rear {{entrance}} and loaded into a light gray US Navy ambulance for its transport to the Bethesda Naval Hospital for an autopsy and mortician's preparations. When Jackie Kennedy stepped off the plane with her brother-in-law, her pink suit and legs were still stained with her husband's blood. <b>All</b> <b>that</b> <b>long</b> afternoon and into {{the early morning hours of}} the next day, the widow objected to leaving her husband's body, except for the swearing in of Johnson. She also refused to change out of her blood-stained suit; Lady Bird Johnson, in her audio diary, quoted Mrs. Kennedy as saying [...] "I want them to see what they have done to Jack." ...|$|E
60|$|<b>All</b> <b>that</b> <b>long</b> day I {{lay behind}} my screen of bushes, {{listening}} to the bells which struck the hours below.|$|E
60|$|Half an {{hour later}} we were away on our journey. My {{mistress}} stayed in London two months. Throughout <b>all</b> <b>that</b> <b>long</b> time no letter from my master was forwarded {{to her from the}} country house.|$|E
60|$|But <b>all</b> <b>that</b> night <b>long</b> {{she never}} slept. Her head was {{too full of}} Bertram Ingledew.|$|R
6000|$|<b>All</b> <b>that</b> <b>longed</b> {{for love}} in Emily's nature had clung round her school-friend since her father's death. Turning deadly pale under the {{struggle}} to control herself, she made the effort--and bore the pain of it without letting a cry or a tear escape her. [...] "Our ways in life lie far apart," [...] she said gently. [...] "There is the hope of meeting again, dear--if there is nothing more." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Hang the experiment!" [...] he {{declared}} cheerfully. [...] "I lost <b>all</b> interest in <b>that</b> <b>long</b> ago. <b>All</b> <b>that</b> I have been anxious for has been your recovery." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Don't {{you think}} it's {{hard to be}} sent away for five years, to make your fortune among hateful savages, and lose sight of your friends at home for <b>all</b> <b>that</b> <b>long</b> time? Don't you think Frank will miss us sadly? Don't you, papa?--don't you?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I reckon that they've {{made for}} the Ohio," [...] he said. And at this {{judgment}} from him the guard gave a cheer that might almost have been heard in the fields around the fort. The terror that had hovered over us <b>all</b> <b>that</b> <b>long</b> summer was lifted at last.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, my dear, {{we agreed}} to forget <b>all</b> <b>that</b> <b>long</b> ago. And I don't think--I never thought--that Tedham would have let the {{suspicion}} rest on me. He merely wanted to give it that turn, when the investigation began, so as to gain {{time to get out}} to Canada." ...|$|E
60|$|Penniless, {{dependent}} upon the labor of my hands for a livelihood, discontented yet unable to decide upon a plan of action, I came and went <b>all</b> through <b>that</b> <b>long</b> summer with laggard feet and sorrowful countenance.|$|R
6000|$|... 'You are, Brownie,' she answered, pausing in her papering, {{with her}} sleeves rolled up--they called me 'Brownie,' {{partly because of}} my dark complexion, but partly because they could never {{understand}} me. 'We <b>all</b> knew <b>that</b> <b>long</b> ago.' ...|$|R
6000|$|<b>All</b> <b>that</b> night <b>long</b> Simpkin hunted {{and searched}} through the kitchen, peeping into {{cupboards}} {{and under the}} wainscot, and into the tea-pot where he had hidden that twist; but still he found never a mouse! ...|$|R
6000|$|There {{are many}} {{beautiful}} stones and appropriate inscriptions during <b>all</b> <b>that</b> <b>long</b> period, {{in spite of}} the advent of Mr. Buggins and his ugliness, and the charm and pathos is often in a phrase, a single line, as in this from St. Keverne, 1710, a widow's epitaph on her husband: ...|$|E
60|$|The cab {{which had}} been called <b>all</b> <b>that</b> <b>long</b> while ago was still waiting at the door. It was now past eleven o'clock. Silently Sir Thomas and Louisa Harris stepped into the cab, Mr. Warren, {{sympathetic}} and attentive to the last, giving the address to the chauffeur on their behalf.|$|E
60|$|Within {{the little}} room, Bertrade de Montfort sat upon a bench {{guarding}} her prisoner, from whom {{she did not}} dare move {{her eyes for a}} single second. <b>All</b> <b>that</b> <b>long</b> night she sat thus, and when morning dawned, it found her position unchanged, her tired eyes still fixed upon the hag.|$|E
5000|$|WQMA {{broadcast}} national programming <b>all</b> weekend <b>long</b> <b>that</b> included: ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{think that}} you can find your uncle's house, my dear?" [...] she asked, glancing at Virginia with concern. Through <b>all</b> of <b>that</b> <b>long</b> journey she had worn a look apart. [...] "Do you think you can find your uncle's house?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{thought we}} had talked <b>all</b> <b>that</b> out <b>long</b> ago," [...] I answered, a little wearily. [...] "You {{would have been very}} foolish if you had acted differently. I don't see how else you could have acted." ...|$|R
60|$|He said no more, nor {{was there}} opportunity, for the Warhoons were closing in about us, and {{together}} we fought, shoulder to shoulder, during <b>all</b> <b>that</b> <b>long,</b> hot afternoon, until the tide of battle turned and the remnant of the fierce Warhoon horde fell back upon their thoats, and fled into the gathering darkness.|$|E
60|$|That he {{had ridden}} <b>all</b> <b>that</b> <b>long,</b> rough way merely {{to see her}} she was not vain enough to believe; but she had, nevertheless, {{something}} of every woman's secret belief in her individual charm. Cavanagh had shown a flattering interest in her, and his wish to be her protector filled her with joy and confidence.|$|E
60|$|During <b>all</b> <b>that</b> <b>long</b> {{night the}} people worked in relays, that each {{might have an}} {{opportunity}} for rest, and when morning came the flames were well-nigh subdued--not so much through the exertions of those who fought against them, as {{because of the fact}} that there was nothing more remaining for them to feed upon.|$|E
6000|$|So it was, <b>all</b> through <b>that</b> <b>long,</b> sad day, and {{the only}} thing that gave him comfort was to score through, in the draft of his will, bequests to his eldest son, and busy himself over {{drafting}} a clause to take their place: ...|$|R
6000|$|... "D'ye hear there, {{fore and}} aft? <b>All</b> you <b>that</b> have <b>long</b> hair, cut it short; and <b>all</b> you <b>that</b> have large whiskers, trim them down, {{according}} to the Navy regulations." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "We {{must try}} to escape, {{as soon as it}} grows dark," [...] said the old frontiersman, and <b>all</b> through <b>that</b> <b>long,</b> weary day they waited and watched for the light to {{disappear}} up the passageway. At last it was gone, and they swam again to the river, making as little noise as possible.|$|R
6000|$|... "There {{was nothing}} for it but to follow their lead, and {{accordingly}} we followed with industry. Through <b>all</b> <b>that</b> <b>long</b> hot day did we tramp, passing quantities of every sort of game, and even coming across the spoor of other elephants. But, {{in spite of my}} men's entreaties, I would not turn aside after these. I would have those mighty tusks or none.|$|E
60|$|Hugh, Grey Dick, and David, trudged up {{and down}} {{through the streets of}} Avignon. <b>All</b> <b>that</b> <b>long</b> day they trudged seeking news and finding little. Again and again they asked at the inns whether a knight who bore the name of Acour, or de Noyon, or Cattrina, was or had been a guest there, but none whom they asked seemed to know {{anything}} of such a person.|$|E
60|$|So <b>all</b> <b>that</b> <b>long</b> {{afternoon}} we rode on, following {{the course of}} the river. From the nature of the ground we could only go slowly, but before sunset I had the satisfaction of knowing that there must be at least twenty-five miles between us and those accursed Zulus. Little Tota slept most of the way, the motion of the horse was easy, and she was worn out.|$|E
60|$|Whitefoot didn't go out <b>that</b> {{night at}} <b>all.</b> It was a {{moonlight}} night {{and just the}} kind of a night to be out. Instead Whitefoot lay in his little bed and shivered and shook, for <b>all</b> through <b>that</b> <b>long</b> night {{every once in a while}} Hooty the Owl would hoot from the top of that stub.|$|R
50|$|But <b>all</b> <b>that</b> was <b>long</b> ago. Now, {{something}} strange is happening. The signals are clear. Foul creatures are awakening from their dormancy, and spreading terror and destruction. The Darkness has returned, {{and the end}} is near. A new hero is needed, a chosen one who will wield the Sword, and destroy the Enemy forever.|$|R
60|$|Within {{five minutes}} of the hotel {{she might have been}} on any of half a dozen roads. He wandered or rushed along them all for a space, and came back. One of them was short and ended in the lake. <b>All</b> through <b>that</b> <b>long</b> and {{beautiful}} day this miserable man found himself coming back to the road that ended in the lake.|$|R
60|$|Now I {{was at the}} bow of the balsa and Quilla was at its stern, {{and between}} us were the others, so that during <b>all</b> <b>that</b> <b>long</b> night's journey I had no speech with her and must content myself with gazing over my {{shoulder}} at her beauty as best I could, which was not well, because of Kari, who ever seemed to come between my eyes and hers.|$|E
6000|$|BROADBENT. First love is only {{a little}} foolishness {{and a lot of}} curiosity: no really self-respecting woman would take {{advantage}} of it. No, my dear Nora: I've done with <b>all</b> <b>that</b> <b>long</b> ago. Love affairs always end in rows. We're {{not going to have any}} rows: we're going to have a solid four-square home: man and wife: comfort and common sense--and plenty of affection, eh [he puts his arm round her with confident proprietorship]? ...|$|E
60|$|They talked {{not at all}} for a {{long time}} after that kiss, walking slowly up the long, empty road, while the whitish clouds sailed across the dark river of the sky and the moon slowly sank. This was the most delicious part of <b>all</b> <b>that</b> <b>long</b> walk home, for the kiss had made them feel as though they had no bodies, but were just two spirits walking side by side. This is its curious effect {{sometimes}} in first love between the very young....|$|E
6000|$|... "Aw, <b>that's</b> <b>all</b> right," [...] {{he said in}} mock-lordly fashion. [...] "Roy Blanchard can come. I'll let 'm. <b>All</b> <b>that</b> was a <b>long</b> time ago. Besides, I 'm {{too busy}} to fool with such things." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>All</b> night <b>long</b> <b>that</b> cry rang in the man's {{head with}} a wailing, falling cadence like the note of a lost little prairie-chicken.|$|R
5000|$|Legion of Space Series (1934-1982) by Jack Williamson. In this future history, humans conquer and {{colonise}} Mars in a {{long series}} of wars with its inhabitants. <b>All</b> <b>that</b> is <b>long</b> in the past of the series' 30th century plot, where Mars is an established human-settled planet, humans living mainly [...] "in the fertile canal areas" [...] while most of the planet is desert.|$|R
