For 'Papa Don't Preach' there were so many opinions– that's why I thought it was so great. Is she for 'schma-smortion', <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>say</b> <b>in</b> Knocked Up?

2500|$|The term {{volunteer}} {{can refer}} to any member of an Irish republican paramilitary, to a [...] "rank and file" [...] member, similar to a private, or to a member {{that is not a}} senior officer such as Chief of Staff or Quartermaster General. Joe McCann, an Official IRA member killed in 1972, was referred to in commemorations as a [...] "Staff Captain" [...] but also as a [...] "Volunteer". On the other hand, Joe Cahill, the commander of the Provisional IRA Belfast Brigade in 1971, said in a press conference after the introduction of internment that year, that British forces had only succeeded in arresting two officers of the Provisional IRA. [...] "The rest are volunteers, or <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>say</b> <b>in</b> the British Army, privates". The 'v' in [...] "volunteer" [...] {{may or may not be}} capitalized.|$|E

5000|$|The song [...] "Straw Dogs" [...] by The Stiff Little Fingers (<b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>say</b> {{themselves}} <b>in</b> {{an interview}} on the re-release of their album Nobody's Heroes [...] "a dirty nasty song about a dirty nasty subject") is about mercenaries.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{can tell}} by the looks of you. Look's if you'd been pulled through a knot-hole, <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>say</b> up <b>in</b> Molasses Gap. Heard {{everything}} that took place, didn't you? I did too. You'll get over that. I sleep like a top now." ...|$|R
60|$|His dander {{began to}} rise, <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>say</b> <b>in</b> the north; {{but he kept}} grip of politeness.|$|E
60|$|TOPPING. [With a grin] It's on {{the knees}} of the gods, Miss, <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>say</b> <b>in</b> the headlines.|$|E

6000|$|... 'Well, it's no use {{talking about}} it now,' said Sam. 'It's over, and can't be helped, and that's one consolation, <b>as</b> <b>they</b> always <b>says</b> <b>in</b> Turkey, ven <b>they</b> cuts the wrong man's head off.

60|$|The {{position}} was consolidated, <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>say,</b> and <b>in</b> the darkness stretcher-bearers were {{out over the}} half-mile. Like will-o'-the-wisps, with their shaded lanterns, they moved, hour after hour, slowly quartering the black honeycomb which lay behind the new British line. Now {{and then in the}} light of some star-shell their figures were disclosed, bending and raising the forms of the wounded, or wielding pick and shovel.|$|R

6000|$|... "Seems to me," [...] said Patsy, discontentedly, [...] "that {{the plot}} thickens, <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>say</b> <b>in</b> novels. If we {{interview}} {{many more people}} we shall find ourselves suspecting an army." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{know you}} are. I 'read after you,' <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>say</b> out here. <b>In</b> fact, I've {{got a little}} 'farm,' and take a shy at {{breeding}} the beasts myself. I'd like {{you to come in}} and give me a hint or two." ...|$|R
6000|$|It was {{inevitable}} that the girl should soon refer to the ranger, and Redfield was as complimentary of him as she could wish. [...] "Ross hasn't a fault but one, and that's a negative one: he doesn't care a hang about getting on, <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>say</b> over <b>in</b> England. He's content just to do {{the duty of the}} moment. He made a good cow-puncher and a good soldier; but as for promotion, he laughs when I mention it." ...|$|R

6000|$|... 'Troth,' {{said the}} stranger, {{stopping}} {{and looking at}} the friendly propounder, 'that's nae bad overture, <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>say</b> <b>in</b> the General Assembly. I have heard waur motions than that frae wiser counsel.' ...|$|E

5000|$|She {{pleaded for}} the Church of England to {{strengthen}} and expand its own school system: Among the queerest heresies {{is that which}} teaches that children {{ought not to be}} biassed, or, <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>say,</b> 'prejudiced' <b>in</b> their spiritual outlook ... Such parents and guardians are, indeed, biassing and prejudicing their children's choice, because it is inevitable that children left without religious instruction must grow up in the belief that the truths of religion and the practice of religion cannot be of much importance to their parents.|$|R
6000|$|... 'I am no scollard, <b>as</b> <b>they</b> would <b>say</b> <b>in</b> Whitford, you know; but it {{has often}} struck me, that if folks would but believe that the Apostles talked not such very bad Greek, and had some slight notion of the {{received}} meaning of the words they used, and of the absurdity of using the same term to express nineteen different things, the New Testament would be {{found to be a}} much simpler and more severely philosophic book than [...] "Theologians" [...] ("Anthropo-sophists" [...] I call them) fancy.' ...|$|R
5000|$|... "In {{terms of}} genre, {{it is more}} rock than electronica. Even a bit {{psychedelic}} and/or progressive at times. The mood is kind of sanctified and sad. It has a few frivolous moments as well, but <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>say,</b> 'even <b>in</b> laughter the heart is sorrowful' (Proverbs 14:13.). I know {{there are many people}} who expect some kind of sequel to Perdition City. It's not. It's got a different kind of sensibility. It's also got far too much sound on it to be similar to our film soundtracks, which are quite often based on very simple and transparent kind of themes.” ...|$|R
6000|$|Grace laughed. [...] "I {{scarcely}} {{think you}} would ever, <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>say</b> <b>in</b> this country, go back on a friend. My father, as he said, is fond of the game, but that doesn't go very far, after all." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Ditmore, we {{have come}} to have a talk with you!" [...] cried Crabtree. [...] "And let me say at the start that I want the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>say</b> <b>in</b> court." ...|$|E
6000|$|I {{shall be}} {{curious to know}} who were at Gad's Hill on Christmas Day, and how you (<b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>say</b> <b>in</b> this country) [...] "got along." [...] It is {{exceedingly}} cold here again, {{after two or three}} quite spring days.|$|E
6000|$|... "Solmes {{took up the}} argument, when Francis {{released}} me {{by leaving}} [...] the room. He spoke of my father's resentment, should this enterprise [...] reach his ears--of the revenge of Mowbray of St. Ronan's, whose [...] nature was both haughty and rugged--of risk from {{the laws of the}} [...] country, and God knows what bugbears besides, which, at a more [...] advanced age, I would have laughed at. In a word, I sealed the [...] capitulation, vowed perpetual absence, and banished myself, <b>as</b> <b>they</b> [...] <b>say</b> <b>in</b> this country, forth of Scotland.|$|R
6000|$|... "I am a fool, I know," [...] he {{declared}} bitterly. [...] "I'm an awkward, nervous, miserable fool, my own worst enemy <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>say</b> of me <b>in</b> the Mess, turning the people against me I {{want to have}} like me, stumbling into every blunder a fool can. I'm {{the sort of man}} women make sport of, and you've done it for them cruelly, perfectly." ...|$|R
5000|$|Welles {{credited}} the [...] "Rosebud" [...] {{device to}} Mankiewicz. [...] "Rosebud remained, {{because it was}} the only way we could find to get off, <b>as</b> <b>they</b> used to <b>say</b> <b>in</b> vaudeville," [...] Welles said. [...] "It manages to work, but I'm still not too keen about it, and I don't think that he was, either." [...] Welles said that they attempted to diminish the importance of the word's meaning and [...] "take the mickey out of it." ...|$|R
6000|$|The tomato hit Wyatt. Wyatt, with others, went to {{look for}} the thrower. The {{remnants}} of the thrower's friends were placed in the pond, and [...] "with them," [...] <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>say</b> <b>in</b> the courts of law, Police Constable Alfred Butt.|$|E

6000|$|VERNON [laughs]. It {{would have}} been a [...] "nice point," [...] <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>say</b> <b>in</b> legal circles. If people had liked her, they'd have tried to forget that her cousins had ever been scullery-maids. If not, they'd have taken good care that nobody did.|$|E
5|$|A {{producer}} with Taewon Entertainment, {{the production}} company behind Iris, was quoted on May 6, 2010 <b>as</b> <b>saying</b> <b>they</b> were <b>in</b> negotiations toward exporting the series to American television for broadcast {{on a major}} network.

5000|$|Duff Cooper, another Conservative Member of Parliament, {{resigned}} {{in the wake}} of the signing of the Munich Agreement. Speaking before Chamberlain’s first parliamentary appearance after Munich was signed, Cooper believed that Britain had “lost the courage to see things <b>as</b> <b>they</b> are.” He <b>says</b> <b>in</b> another portion of his resignation speech that Britain had been “drifting, day by day, nearer into war with Germany, and we have never said, until the last moment, and then in most uncertain terms, that we were prepared to fight.” ...|$|R
