5|$|Unlike most amateurs of the time, Seamer prioritised {{defensive}} {{play when}} batting; {{he watched the}} ball and minimised the risks, valuing his own wicket. This careful style was exemplified by his innings in the University match of 1934, when he helped Oxford salvage a draw by batting for two hours with the tail, during which time he scored 24 runs. Despite his circumspect batting technique, Seamer enjoyed his cricket, and in a more relaxed setting he once scored a century before lunch: playing in the Sudan, the match started at {{seven in the morning}} to <b>avoid</b> <b>the</b> <b>worst</b> of the heat. Before their opponent's innings, Seamer and his team-mates got them drunk to improve their chances of a win.|$|E
25|$|The U.S. Department of Energy has its {{headquarters}} for the Office of Biological and Environmental Research in Germantown. The U.S. Atomic Energy Commission was moved from its location in downtown Washington, D.C. to the present-day U.S. Department of Energy building in Germantown because of fears of a Soviet nuclear attack on the U.S. capital.

25|$|France {{seemed to}} be at the start of civil unrest in 1899, and once again Louis Lépine was {{recalled}} to help ease the situation. Again and again Paris appeared to be on the point of violent protestations, but through wise diplomacy and carefully organised policing, Lépine managed to <b>avoid</b> <b>the</b> <b>worst</b> of times. He attempted to limit the role of the army as a force of internal order by handling most situations with police and gendarmerie alone. During these febrile times France faced the possibility of a military government and whilst there were occasions when Lépine required military assistance to control demonstrations it is credit to his reforms that these were rare and that the gendamerie largely controlled the civil strife.|$|E
25|$|Delegates from 183 {{countries}} met in Bonn from 1 to 12 June 2009. The {{purpose was}} to discuss key negotiating texts.

At the conclusion the Ad Hoc Working Group under the Kyoto Protocol (AWG-KP) negotiating group was still far away from the emission reduction range that has been set out by science to <b>avoid</b> <b>the</b> <b>worst</b> ravages of climate change: a minus 25% to minus 40% reduction below 1990 levels by 2020. The AWG-KP still needs to decide on the aggregate emission reduction target for industrialised countries, along with individual targets for each country. Progress was made in gaining clarification of the issues of concern to parties and including these concerns in the updated draft of the negotiating text.|$|E
25|$|Ascents of Great Crag can {{be started}} from the hamlets of Rosthwaite, Stonethwaite or Watendlath. The Rosthwaite route uses the {{bridleway}} to Watendlath until {{the highest point}} is reached then goes southerly over boggy moorland and then more firmer rocky ground to reach the summit. The Stonethwaite path climbs steeply through woodland before reaching Dock Tarn; it is then a short ascent from the tarn north-westwards to the summit. These two routes can be combined to make a circular walk starting and finishing in Rosthwaite. The ascent from Watendlath utilises the popular path to Dock Tarn which has been diverted by signposts to <b>avoid</b> <b>the</b> <b>worst</b> of the boggy ground {{to the north of}} the fell; this path takes the walker very close to the summit and it is a simple climb through heather to attain the highest point.|$|E

25|$|Travel on {{highways}} {{outside of}} {{towns and cities}} in Angola (and in some cases within) is often not best advised for those without four-by-four vehicles. While a reasonable road infrastructure has existed within Angola, time and the war have taken their toll on the road surfaces, leaving many severely potholed, littered with broken asphalt. In many areas drivers have established alternate tracks to <b>avoid</b> <b>the</b> <b>worst</b> parts of the surface, although careful attention must {{be paid to the}} presence or absence of landmine warning markers by the side of the road. The Angolan government has contracted the restoration of many of the country's roads. The road between Lubango and Namibe, for example, was completed recently with funding from the European Union, and is comparable to many European main routes. Completing the road infrastructure is likely to take some decades, but substantial efforts are already being made.|$|E
25|$|However, as the English forces encircled Snowdonia and {{his people}} starved he was soon moving desperately from one fort to another as {{effective}} resistance was systematically crushed. Dolwyddelan, which was at risk of becoming encircled, was first abandoned on 18 January 1283. After this Dolbadarn Castle served as his base but by March this noble site {{in the heart of}} Snowdonia was also threatened forcing his departure. Finally, Dafydd moved his headquarters south to Castell y Bere near Llanfihangel-y-pennant. As the situation deteriorated it seems most likely that Dafydd and his family hoped to remain at Y Bere just long enough to <b>avoid</b> <b>the</b> <b>worst</b> of the Welsh winter before they were compelled to evacuate the site at the end of March in advance of the English forces who were manoeuvering to place it under siege. From this point forwards the prince, his family and the remains of his government were fugitives sleeping outdoors, forced to keep moving from place to place to avoid capture. Castell Y Bere's starving garrison would eventually surrender on 25 April. After the fall of Y Bere, Dafydd's movements are speculative but he is recorded in May 1283 leading raids from the mountains supported to the bitter end by Goronwy ap Heilin, Hywel ap Rhys and his brother Rhys Wyndod.|$|E

500|$|They {{were faced}} with two {{possible}} routes back to Cape Denison. The first option was to make for the coast, where they could supplement their meagre supplies with seal meat, and hope to meet with Madigan's party; that would considerably lengthen the journey, and the sea ice in summer could not be relied on. Or, pushing slightly {{to the south of}} their outward route, they could hope to <b>avoid</b> <b>the</b> <b>worst</b> of the crevasses and aim for speed. Mawson chose the inland route, which meant that in the absence of fresh seal meat they would have to resort to eating their remaining dogs. The first dog—George—was killed the following morning, and of his meat some was fried for the men and the rest fed to the now starving dogs.

500|$|SS Wilfred Sykes loaded {{opposite}} Fitzgerald at the Burlington Northern Dock#1 {{and departed}} at 4:15p.m., {{about two hours}} after Fitzgerald. In contrast to the NWS forecast, Captain Dudley J. Paquette of Sykes predicted that a major storm would directly cross Lake Superior. From the outset, he chose a route that {{took advantage of the}} protection offered by the lake's north shore in order to <b>avoid</b> <b>the</b> <b>worst</b> effects of the storm. The crew of Sykes followed the radio conversations between Fitzgerald and Anderson during the first part of their trip and overheard their captains deciding to take the regular Lake Carriers' Association downbound route. The NWS altered its forecast at 7:00p.m., issuing gale warnings for the whole of Lake Superior. Anderson and Fitzgerald altered course northward seeking shelter along the Ontario coast where they encountered a winter storm at 1:00a.m. on November 10.

2500|$|The 2011 Japanese nuclear {{accidents}} {{due to the}} 2011 Tōhoku {{earthquake and}} tsunami provide a sharp contrast to some comparative safety advantages of floating nuclear plants. Land based nuclear facilities must be designed for severe ground accelerations due to earthquakes. Many are placed close to a seacoast for access to sea water for cooling. Coastal locations {{tend to be the}} areas of maximum tsunami damage, requiring protective design and risk of catastrophic failure. [...] A floating facility, near a coast but not in shallow water, can <b>avoid</b> <b>the</b> <b>worst</b> problems of earthquakes and tsunamis.

[...] In the event of an accident, terrorist attack, or other calamity, it is essential to keep the water moderated and cooled reactor core covered with water. [...] An emergency measure can be to lower the core into the sea. In the worst case, accidental sinking or intentional scuttling will keep sea water on the core and prevent atmospheric release - again, especially in deep enough water.
