The theoretically calculated H 2 O 2 doses are higher and are neither cost effective nor shows good reduction in COD value when it used alone. The theoretically calculated H 2 O 2 dose consumption reduced more than 90 % when it used along with ferrous sulphate by providing favorable oxidation condition for AMLE. The parameters which showed their great influence on pre-oxidation of <b>Aqueous</b> <b>Mother</b> <b>Liquor</b> Effluent (AMLE) were pH, concentration of ferrous ion, Hydrogen peroxide and reaction time. These parameters were optimized for COD reduction more than 80 %. Fenton‟s reagent dose were applied to AMLE (e. g. FeSO 4 (anhydrous physical form of commercial grade) : H 2 O 2 (on assay basis) = 1 : 10) on pH 3 - 3. 5. The Fenton‟s oxidation enhances the biodegradability of AMLE which further treated by coagulation and Activated Sludge Treatment Process (ASP). The biodegradable organic matter present in waste water removes in ASP by biosorption, biooxidation including nitrification and bioflocculation but due to the high organic load, biorecalcitrant compound, surfactants or biotoxicity in AMLE the Activated Sludge Treatment Process (ASP) did not perform effective treatment as a result we obtained biologically treated effluent with high COD, TSS and TDS value, loss of biomass in treated effluent, biomass rupturing in aeration tank and poor settling of biomass in secondary clarifier. Therefore to deactivate the biocidal property and to prevent shock loading and to improve the biodegradability for ASP the Advanced Oxidation played very important role...|$|E

Due to the complexity of this <b>mother</b> <b>liquor,</b> further isolation of xylose by simple method is not possible. In China, more than 50, 000 metric tons of xylose <b>mother</b> <b>liquor</b> was produced in 2009, and the management of sugars like xylose that present in the low-cost liquor is a problem. Results We designed a novel strategy in which Bacillus subtilis and Candida maltosa were combined and used to convert xylose in this <b>mother</b> <b>liquor</b> to xylitol, a product of higher value. First, the xylose <b>mother</b> <b>liquor</b> was detoxified with the yeast C. maltosa to remove furfural and 5 -hydromethylfurfural (HMF), which are inhibitors of B. subtilis growth. The glucose present in the <b>mother</b> <b>liquor</b> was also depleted by this yeast, which was an added advantage because glucose causes carbon catabolite repression in B. subtilis. This detoxification treatment resulted in an inhibitor-free <b>mother</b> <b>liquor,</b> and the C. maltosa cells could be reused as biocatalysts at a later stage to reduce xylose to xylitol. In the second step, a recombinant B. subtilis strain with a disrupted xylose isomerase gene was constructed. The detoxified xylose <b>mother</b> <b>liquor</b> was used as the medium for recombinant B. subtilis cultivation, and this led to L-arabinose depletion and xylose enrichment of the medium. In the third step, the xylose was further reduced to xylitol by C. maltosa cells, and crystallized xylitol was obtained from this yeast transformation medium. C. maltosa transformation of the xylose-enriched medium resulted in xylitol with 4. 25 g L - 1 ·h - 1 volumetric productivity and 0. 85 g xylitol/g xylose specific productivity. Conclusion In this study, we developed a biological method for the purification of xylose from xylose <b>mother</b> <b>liquor</b> and subsequent preparation of xylitol by C. maltosa -mediated biohydrogenation of xylose. </p...|$|R

The high content of these triterpenes in OBB and their universal biological activity are {{the reasons for their}} broad-scope research. Industrial-scale isolation is hampered by the lack of simple, non-expensive isolation and purification technologies. We have tested the solubility and purity of birch OBB extractives in PE 140 at its boiling temperature. Triterpenes’ solubility was 13. 9 g/L and, cooling the hot filtered solution, 81 % of the total extractives’ mass precipitated. The solubility of the remaining extractives in the <b>mother</b> <b>liquor</b> was 2. 69 g/L. It was most interesting that the yellowish extractives obtained after the evaporation of the cooled <b>mother</b> <b>liquor</b> had a high content of lupeol, i. e. 39. 7 %, but there were only traces of betulin. This suggests the possibility of using fractional crystallisation for separating the triterpene mixture.
