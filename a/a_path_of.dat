It {{is easy to see}} that if k = 1, 2, G has <b>a</b> heterochromatic <b>path</b> <b>of</b> length at least k.

5|$|Agnes and Gebhard {{married on}} 2February 1583 in Bonn and retired to the Elector's country seat in Poppelsdorf to {{celebrate}} their nuptials. Within weeks, the Cathedral chapter had deposed Gebhard, electing in his place an old opponent, Ernst of Bavaria, the brother of Wilhelm V, Duke of Bavaria, who immediately set about raising an army {{with the help of}} his brother the duke, and his second brother, Ferdinand of Bavaria. In the spring and summer, Agnes and Gebhard did likewise, traveling to different parts of the electorate, raising an army, and extending the Protestant cause. By October, Ernst's brother Ferdinand entered the electorate from the south, near Koblenz. In their northward progress, they left <b>a</b> <b>path</b> <b>of</b> fire and destruction. Agnes and Gebhard fled, as Poppelsdorf, then Godesberg, and later the capital city of the electorate, Bonn, were over-run and destroyed.|$|E
5|$|Case No. 5 were {{light bulbs}} that {{represented}} {{the state of}} the art of filament lamps from 1900 to 1913. They show electric lights using certain gases within the sealed bulb. They were directing <b>a</b> <b>path</b> <b>of</b> technology into 'cold light.' One of these was a long tube instead of a globe. It had a stop cock in the center and a glass bulb at each end. Hammer explained how this one came about. He said one day in 1902 he visited Pierre Curie, the husband of Madam Curie. Professor Curie drew a diagram on the blackboard and suggested that Hammer make a lamp like that with sulfide of zinc inside. Curie explained to Hammer what radium gaseous could do in this configuration. It would stimulate luminescence that would produce light without a hot filament involved.|$|E

40|$|Let G be an edge-colored graph. A {{heterochromatic}} (rainbow, or multicolored) <b>path</b> <b>of</b> G is such <b>a</b> <b>path</b> {{in which}} no two edges have the same color. Let d^c(v) denote the color degree and CN(v) denote the color neighborhood of a vertex v of G. In a previous paper, we showed that if d^c(v) ≥ k (color degree condition) for every vertex v of G, then G has <b>a</b> heterochromatic <b>path</b> <b>of</b> length at least k+ 1 / 2, and if |CN(u) ∪ CN(v) |≥ s (color neighborhood union condition) for every pair of vertices u and v of G, then G has <b>a</b> heterochromatic <b>path</b> <b>of</b> length at least s/ 3 + 1. Later, in another paper we first showed that if k≤ 7, G has <b>a</b> heterochromatic <b>path</b> <b>of</b> length at least k- 1, and then, based on this we use induction on k and showed that if k≥ 8, then G has <b>a</b> heterochromatic <b>path</b> <b>of</b> length at least 3 k/ 5 + 1. In the present paper, by using a simpler approach we further improve the result by showing that if k≥ 8, G has <b>a</b> heterochromatic <b>path</b> <b>of</b> length at least 2 k/ 3 + 1, which confirms a conjecture by Saito. We also improve a previous result by showing that under the color neighborhood union condition, G has <b>a</b> heterochromatic <b>path</b> <b>of</b> length at least 2 s+ 4 / 5.
