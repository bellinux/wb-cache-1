5|$|John Koller {{explains}} {{the role of}} intent in Jainism with {{the example of a}} monk, who unknowingly offered poisoned food to his brethren. According to the Jain view, the monk is guilty of a violent act if the other monks die because they eat the poisoned food; but according to the Buddhist view he would not be guilty. The crucial difference between the two views is that the Buddhist view excuses the act, categorising it as non-intentional, since he was not aware that the food was poisoned; whereas the Jain view holds the monk to have been responsible, due to his ignorance and carelessness. Jains argue that the monk's very ignorance and carelessness constitute <b>an</b> <b>intent</b> to do violence and hence entail his guilt. So the absence of intent does not absolve a person from the karmic consequences of guilt either, according to the Jain analysis.|$|E

In December 2007, ExactTarget filed <b>an</b> <b>intent</b> for {{an initial public offering}} with the Securities Exchange Commission, but withdrew its filing in May 2009. Instead, it announced $70 million in venture funding had been raised for international expansion, which was followed by another $75 million round later that year. An office was established in London with the acquisition of a UK-based ExactTarget reseller, Keymail Marketing, in September 2009. The company also hired 200 additional employees.
