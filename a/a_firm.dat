40|$|This study {{examines}} {{the effects of}} <b>a</b> <b>firm's</b> debt financing decision on the informativeness of the income statement. This study specifically examines the association between <b>a</b> <b>firm's</b> bank dependence and the value relevance of the income statement by investigating the income-statement conservatism of firms with bank loans. Focusing on relatively small businesses, this study finds that income-statement conservatism, measured as timely loss recognition, is increasing in <b>a</b> <b>firm's</b> bank dependence. This study also finds that the value relevance of the income statement is increasing in <b>a</b> <b>firm's</b> bank dependence. The findings of this paper suggest that {{the usefulness of the}} income statement varies with <b>a</b> <b>firm's</b> bank dependence, indicating that the value relevance of the income statement is a function of <b>a</b> <b>firm's</b> debt financing decision. The findings further suggest that bank relationships affect the value relevance of the income statement through their influence on income-statement conservatism.

40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the effect of}} increasing the transparency (precision) of a value relevant public signal about one dimension of <b>a</b> <b>firm’s</b> profitability on the firm’s incentive to undertake investment, when the firm possesses two-dimensional private information about the final return from an investment project. When <b>a</b> <b>firm’s</b> private information is one-dimensional, greater transparency of the public signal unambiguously enhances investment efficiency. However, we show that when <b>a</b> <b>firm’s</b> private information is two-dimensional, the effect of enhanced transparency along merely one dimension of the firm’s profitability is ambiguous. The social value of more transparent public information that sheds light on just one dimension of <b>a</b> <b>firm’s</b> profitability depends on the transparency of public information about the other dimension of the firm’s profitability. If the transparency of public information about one dimension of <b>a</b> <b>firm’s</b> profitability is low, then increasing the transparency of public information about another dimension of the firm’s profitability may actually induce the firm to distort its investment more than the firm would under lower transparency. The result {{suggests that it is}} the totality of transparency along all (nor merely some) relevant dimensions of <b>a</b> <b>firm’s</b> profitability that is crucial in enhancing <b>a</b> <b>firm’s</b> investment efficiency...|$|R

This study demonstrates that, in a rapidly changing market environment, the curvilinear relationship between diversification and firm performance can become weaker at higher levels of <b>a</b> <b>firm's</b> dynamic capabilities. In addition, this study argues that unrelated diversification can be a more ideal strategic choice in a dynamic market environment through <b>a</b> <b>firm's</b> optimized dynamic capabilities...|$|R

Thus, when estimating the coefficient on the variable “internationalized firm” on the training participation based on cross-sectional data, the results may be affected by unobserved effects between domestic and internationalized firms that are not directly related to the applied measure of internationalization, but correlate with <b>a</b> <b>firm’s</b> training participation (e.g., the degree of specialization, or the characteristics of <b>a</b> <b>firm’s</b> products or services)g.|$|R

The relational dominant logic of cause-related marketing focuses on building relationships with the target stakeholders through the enhancement of <b>a</b> <b>firm’s</b> legitimacy. The combination of these two types of logic gives rise to four types of cause-related marketing: altruistic, commercial, social and integrative.

40|$|The {{ability to}} develop and {{implement}} innovations is becoming increasingly important for <b>a</b> <b>firm's</b> success in today's competitive environment.

The objective of this thesis is to address this issue by developing a method that enables the systematic generation of firm-specific solutions for the improvement of <b>a</b> <b>firm's</b> innovativeness. The findings show that the improvement of <b>a</b> <b>firm's</b> innovativeness is <b>a</b> complex problem, which existing methods do not sufficiently account for. The combination of the complex problem solving technique of Gomez/Probst and the theory of inventive problem solving (TRIZ) represents a new approach to capture complexity in <b>a</b> <b>firm's</b> innovation system and to generate specific solutions. Therefore, this thesis derives innovation principles as the core element of this method.
