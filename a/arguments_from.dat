5|$|The {{argument}} from morality {{is an argument}} {{for the existence of}} God. <b>Arguments</b> <b>from</b> morality tend to be based on moral normativity or moral order. <b>Arguments</b> <b>from</b> moral normativity observe some aspect of morality and argue that God is the best or only explanation for this, concluding that God must exist. <b>Arguments</b> <b>from</b> moral order are based on the asserted need for moral order to exist in the universe. They claim that, for this moral order to exist, God must exist to support it. The {{argument from}} morality is noteworthy in that one cannot evaluate the soundness of the argument without attending to almost every important philosophical issue in meta-ethics.|$|E
5|$|Some <b>arguments</b> <b>from</b> {{moral order}} suggest that {{morality}} {{is based on}} rationality and that this can only be the case {{if there is a}} moral order in the universe. The arguments propose that only the existence of God as orthodoxly conceived could support the existence of moral order in the universe, so God must exist. Alternative <b>arguments</b> <b>from</b> moral order have proposed that {{we have an obligation to}} attain the perfect good of both happiness and moral virtue. They attest that whatever we are obliged to do must be possible, and achieving the perfect good of both happiness and moral virtue is only possible if a natural moral order exists. A natural moral order requires the existence of God as orthodoxly conceived, so God must exist.|$|E
5|$|Natural Theology or Evidences of the Existence and Attributes of the Deity is an 1802 work of Christian apologetics and {{philosophy}} of religion by the English clergyman William Paley (July 1743 – 25 May 1805). The book expounds his <b>arguments</b> <b>from</b> natural theology, making a teleological {{argument for the}} existence of God, notably beginning with the watchmaker analogy.|$|E
50|$|In the method, schemes work as {{heuristic}} {{devices that}} only offer presumptive {{support of a}} claim that {{may have to be}} withdrawn as new evidence comes in. The schemes connect arguments together into sequences, often called chaining, by taking the conclusion of one argument as a premise in a subsequent argument. Some common schemes are <b>argument</b> <b>from</b> goal-based reasoning, <b>argument</b> <b>from</b> negative consequences, <b>argument</b> <b>from</b> positive consequences, inference to the best explanation (abductive reasoning), <b>argument</b> <b>from</b> sign, <b>argument</b> <b>from</b> analogy, <b>argument</b> <b>from</b> precedent, <b>argument</b> <b>from</b> an established rule, <b>argument</b> <b>from</b> evidence to a hypothesis, <b>argument</b> <b>from</b> cause to effect, <b>argument</b> <b>from</b> correlation to cause, <b>argument</b> <b>from</b> sunk costs, <b>argument</b> <b>from</b> threat, <b>argument</b> <b>from</b> perception, <b>argument</b> <b>from</b> witness testimony, <b>argument</b> <b>from</b> expert opinion, <b>argument</b> <b>from</b> ignorance, <b>argument</b> <b>from</b> commitment, direct ad hominem <b>argument,</b> <b>argument</b> <b>from</b> inconsistency of commitments, slippery slope argument.|$|R
40|$|Philosophers {{commonly}} {{say that}} beliefs come in degrees. Drawing from the literature, I make precise three arguments for this claim: an <b>argument</b> <b>from</b> degrees of confidence, an <b>argument</b> <b>from</b> degrees of firmness, and an <b>argument</b> <b>from</b> natural language. I {{show that they}} all fail. I also advance three arguments that beliefs do not come in degrees: an <b>argument</b> <b>from</b> natural language, an <b>argument</b> <b>from</b> intuition, and an <b>argument</b> <b>from</b> the metaphysics of degrees. On {{the basis of these}} arguments, I conclude that beliefs do not come in degrees...|$|R
40|$|This chapter {{analyses}} Reid's {{criticisms of}} the a number of arguments for determinism: (1) an <b>argument</b> <b>from</b> the inconceivability of free will, (2) an <b>argument</b> <b>from</b> the incompatibility of free will {{and the influence of}} motives, (3) an <b>argument</b> <b>from</b> the principle of sufficient reason, (4) an <b>argument</b> <b>from</b> the notion that vfreedom excludes causation, (5) an <b>argument</b> <b>from</b> divine foreknowledge. The conclusion of the paper is that, given his {{criticisms of the}}se arguments, Reid was justified in believing in libertarian freedom...|$|R
5|$|In 1973, Oslo Sporveier again {{proposed}} {{closing the}} Ekeberg Line. This time {{the reason was}} {{the construction of the}} Oslo Tunnel and Oslo Central Station, which would involve construction work around Jernbanetorget. This proposal also resulted in a public reactions, and the same <b>arguments</b> <b>from</b> the mid-1960s were repeated. Again the suggestion to link the Lilleaker Line to the Ekeberg Line were launched. Oslo Sporveier calculated it would cost NOK3.6 million for investments, including rebuilding 20 Gullfisk trams, new rectifiers and new tracks. This was less than the necessary 30 buses needed for conversion to bus services.|$|E
5|$|On April 1, 1970, Judge George Luzerne Hart, Jr., of the United States District Court for the District of Columbia, {{ordered the}} Interior Department to not issue a {{construction}} permit for {{a section of}} the project that crossed one of the claims. Less than two weeks later, Hart heard <b>arguments</b> <b>from</b> conservation groups that the TAPS project violated the Mineral Leasing Act and the National Environmental Policy Act, which had gone into effect {{at the start of the}} year. Hart issued an injunction against the project, preventing the Interior Department from issuing a construction permit and halting the project in its tracks.|$|E
5|$|On May 24, 1913, Frank {{was indicted}} {{on a charge}} of murder and the case opened at Fulton County Superior Court on July 28. The {{prosecution}} relied heavily on the testimony of Conley, who described himself as an accomplice to the murder, and who the defense at the trial argued was in fact the perpetrator of the murder. A guilty verdict was announced on August 25. Frank and his lawyers made a series of unsuccessful appeals; their final appeal to the Supreme Court of the United States failed in April 1915. Considering <b>arguments</b> <b>from</b> both sides as well as evidence not available at trial, Governor John M. Slaton commuted Frank's sentence from capital punishment to life imprisonment.|$|E

60|$|The {{remainder}} of Darwin's epoch-making work deals, strictly speaking, rather {{with the general}} theory of 'descent with modification' than with the special doctrine of natural selection. It restates and reinforces, {{by the light of the}} new additional concept, and with fuller facts and later knowledge, the four great arguments already known in favour of organic evolution as a whole, the <b>argument</b> <b>from</b> Geological Succession, the <b>argument</b> <b>from</b> Geographical Distribution, the <b>argument</b> <b>from</b> Embryological Development, and the <b>argument</b> <b>from</b> Classificatory Affinities. Each of these we may briefly summarise.|$|R
5|$|The Supreme Court of Indiana has {{original}} and sole jurisdiction in certain specific areas, including {{the practice of}} law, discipline or disbarment of judges appointed to the lower state courts, and supervision over the exercise of jurisdiction by the other lower courts of the state. When the Court accepts a case, it reviews the documentation of the trials in the lower court and sometimes allows oral arguments before making a decision. In some cases the justices will issue a decision without hearing <b>arguments</b> <b>from</b> either side and will base their decision solely on evidence submitted in the lower courts. The Court can order a new trial {{to take place in}} the local court, overturn the decision of lower courts and enforce its own decision, or uphold the decision of lower courts.|$|E
5|$|Lodge later {{claimed the}} South Vietnamese {{prosecutors}} {{failed to make}} any case against Cẩn. The Vietnamese leader also {{had to contend with}} {{the other side of the}} <b>arguments,</b> <b>from</b> those who considered themselves to be victims of the Diệm regime. During the trial, Thích Trí Quang, along with other opponents of the old regime, lobbied for a death sentence for Cẩn. He argued that if Cẩn lived, he could regain power along with his late brothers' supporters. He told Lodge that if the Americans did not support a tough sentence, then the Vietnamese Buddhist community's opinion of Washington would fall. Lodge was initially critical of Quang's campaigning against Cẩn. Cẩn was sentenced to death. He appealed to the head of state for clemency; his lawyers used a provision in the legal code to make the appeal. This placed Minh — who was still the titular head of state — in the position of approving a third death in the Ngô family, having already ordered his bodyguard Nguyễn Văn Nhung to execute Diệm and Nhu during the coup.|$|E
5|$|On May 24, Judge Singleterry heard <b>arguments</b> <b>from</b> the {{plaintiff}} {{and the defense}} on the request for the change of venue. On June 7, he denied {{a request for a}} change of venue after considering that the defendant failed to prove that there was prejudice against him in the Hidalgo community. On July 19, Feit appeared in court for a prehearing. The trial was expected to place on September 11. However, on September 10, the court decided to push the trial due to scheduling conflicts with one of the attorneys and because of delays in another high-profile case in the Hidalgo County. Feit appeared in court on September 11 – for the first time without prison uniform – expecting to face trial that week. The initial phase of jury selection was done in mid-September; the trial was pushed for mid-October.|$|E
50|$|The last 50 {{years has}} seen an {{increase}} in academic philosophical arguments critical of the positions of atheism arguing that they are philosophically unsound. Some of the more common of these arguments are the presumption of atheism, the logical <b>argument</b> <b>from</b> evil, the evidential <b>argument</b> <b>from</b> evil, the <b>argument</b> <b>from</b> nonbelief, and absence of evidence arguments.|$|R
40|$|In this paper, I argue that, {{other things}} being equal, simpler {{arguments}} are better. In other words, I argue that, {{other things being}} equal, it is rational to prefer simpler arguments over less simple ones.

50|$|The Christological {{argument}} {{for the existence of}} God is based on certain claims about Jesus. The argument, which exists in several forms, holds that if these claims are valid, one should accept God exists. There are three main threads; the <b>Argument</b> <b>from</b> the wisdom of Jesus, the <b>Argument</b> <b>from</b> the claims of Jesus as son of God and the <b>Argument</b> <b>from</b> the resurrection.|$|R
5|$|Regardless of {{acceptance}} from major religious hierarchies, early religious objections to Darwin's theory are still used {{in opposition to}} evolution. The ideas that species change over time through natural processes and that different species share common ancestors seemed to contradict the Genesis account of Creation. Believers in Biblical infallibility attacked Darwinism as heretical. The natural theology of the early 19th century was typified by William Paley's watchmaker analogy, an argument from design still used by the creationist movement. Natural theology included a range of ideas and <b>arguments</b> <b>from</b> the outset, and when Darwin's theory was published, ideas of theistic evolution were presented in which evolution is accepted as a secondary cause open to scientific investigation, while still holding belief in God as a first cause with a non-specified role in guiding evolution and creating humans. This position has been adopted by denominations of Christianity and Judaism in line with modernist theology which views the Bible and Torah as allegorical, thus removing the conflict between evolution and religion.|$|E
5|$|Vermigli was {{primarily}} a teacher of scripture rather than a systematic theologian, but his lasting influence is mostly associated with his doctrine of the Eucharist. This {{can be explained by}} the close relationship he saw between exegesis of scripture and theological reflection. Vermigli's method of biblical commentary, similar to that of Martin Bucer, was to include extended discussions of doctrinal topics treated by the biblical texts. Like other Protestants, he believed scripture alone held supreme authority in establishing truth. Nevertheless, he was familiar with the church fathers to a higher degree than many of his contemporaries, and he constantly referred to them. He saw value in the fathers because they had discovered insights into the scriptures that he might not have found, and because many of his Catholic opponents placed great weight on <b>arguments</b> <b>from</b> patristic authority. Often, though, he used the fathers as support for interpretations he had already reached on his own and was not concerned when his interpretation had no patristic precedent.|$|E
5|$|Ron Perranoski {{entered as}} the new pitcher for the seventh, Camilli took his place {{as the new}} catcher, and Ron Fairly {{replaced}} Wally Moon at first base. Burright became the new second baseman, replacing Gilliam who moved to third base while the previous third baseman, Tommy Davis, moved to center field. Perranoski allowed singles to Orsino and Pagán after a ground out by Felipe Alou. The Giants pinch hit Harvey Kuenn for Matty Alou and Bob Nieman for Hiller, but both recorded outs to end {{the top of the}} seventh. Ernie Bowman replaced Nieman at second base for the Giants {{in the bottom of the}} inning and no runs scored in the frame. The Giants continued to hit Perranoski in the top of the eighth, with singles by Davenport and Mays to open the inning. Jack Smith entered in relief but allowed a single to Ed Bailey pinch hitting for Larsen which scored Davenport to cut the Dodgers' lead to 7–6. Mays attempted to advance to third on the play but was called out. The play drew <b>arguments</b> <b>from</b> Mays, Alvin Dark, and third base coach Whitey Lockman as third base umpire Jocko Conlan appeared to call Mays safe before changing it to out. Carl Boles pinch ran for Bailey, and Cepeda reached on an error on his fly ball which allowed Boles to move to third. Stan Williams relieved Smith and walked Felipe Alou to load the bases. Orsino hit a sacrifice fly to tie the game at seven runs apiece and Pagán grounded out to end the inning.|$|E
40|$|The author puts {{forward and}} defends a new {{argument}} for indirect realism called the <b>argument</b> <b>from</b> pain. The <b>argument</b> {{is akin to}} a well-known traditional argument to the same end, the <b>argument</b> <b>from</b> hallucination. Like the latter, it contains one premise stating an analogy between veridical perceptions and certain other states and one premise stating that those states are states of acquaintance with sense-data. The crucial {{difference is that the}} states that are said to be analogous to veridical perceptions are pain-states instead of hallucinations. This difference makes the <b>argument</b> <b>from</b> pain immune to the standard objections against the <b>argument</b> <b>from</b> hallucination...|$|R
