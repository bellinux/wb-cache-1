In addition to these current systems, two older notations used a kind of staff: the Solonese script could capture the flexible rhythms of the pesinden with a squiggle on a horizontal staff, while in Yogyakarta a ladder-like vertical staff allowed notation of the balungan by dots and also included important drum strokes. In Bali, there are a few books published of Gamelan gender wayang pieces, employing <b>alphabetical</b> <b>notation</b> in the old Balinese script.|$|E
50|$|In his Versuch eines Farbensystems (1772), Schiffermüller {{addressed}} {{the need for}} a standardised nomenclature with which to describe the countless colours of nature. Work by predecessors in this field had proved unsatisfactory: he mentions suggestions made by Giovanni Antonio Scopoli (1723-1778) in his Entomologia Carniolica (1763) and August Johann Rösel (1705-1759) in his Insecten-Belustigung (1746-61). To serve as a model, Schiffermüller himself presents a table classifying and sub-classifying shades of blue, and naming them in German, Latin and French: in all, 81 German terms are listed. Matching this table, and using the same <b>alphabetical</b> <b>notation,</b> is a 3 x 12 matrix showing a set of colour samples for blue, with some discussion of the pigments used. The work also contains an attractive full-page engraving with a colour circle, inspired by the optical theory of Father Louis Bertrand Castel (1688-1757) and hand-tinted with twelve colours continuously shading into one another. Evident throughout this pioneering work is a subtle response to the nuances of colour and their accurate rendition.|$|E
5000|$|The {{implication}} of reading Thrascias and Meses as half-winds, {{and the others}} as principal winds, is that this implies Aristotle's construction is asymmetric. Specifically, the half-winds would be at 22½° {{on either side of}} the North, while the principal eight would be at 45° angles from each other. However, an alternative hypothesis is that they will be more equally spaced around 30° from each other. By way of guidance, Aristotle mentions that the easterly and westerly positions are that of the sun as seen on the horizon at dawn and at dusk at different times of the year. Using his <b>alphabetical</b> <b>notation,</b> Aristotle notes that during the summer solstice the sun rises at Z (Caecis) and sets at E (Argestes); during the equinox, it rises at B (Apeliotes) and sets at A (Zephyrus), and finally during the winter solstice it rises at Δ (Eurus) and sets at Γ (Lips). So drawn on a compass rose, Aristotle's explanation yields four parallels: ...|$|E

50|$|During {{the late}} 10th and the 11th century, the early {{use of a}} second <b>alphabetical</b> pitch <b>notation</b> was soon {{replaced}} by a new diastematic form of neume notation, which indicated the pitch by the vertical position of the neumes, while their groups indicated by ligatures were still visible. Aquitanian and English cantors in Winchester were the first who developed a diastematic form, which could be written in such an analytical way.|$|R
40|$|The {{issue of}} {{semantic}} and non-semantic conversion routes for numerals is still debated in numerical cognition. We report two number-naming experiments {{in which the}} target numerals were preceded by another numeral (prime). The primes and targets could be presented either in arabic (digit) notation or in verbal (<b>alphabetical)</b> <b>notation.</b> The results reveal a semantically related distance effect: Latencies are fastest when the prime has the same value as the target and increase when the distance between prime and target increases. We argue that the present results are congruent {{with the idea that}} the numerals make access to an ordered semantic number line common to all notations, as the results are the same for within-notation priming (arabic–arabic or verbal– verbal) and between-notations priming (arabic–verbal or verbal–arabic). The present results also point to a rapid involvement of semantics in the naming of numerals, also when the numerals are words. As such, they are in line with recent claims of rapid semantic mediation in word naming...|$|E
40|$|International audienceWhen {{it comes}} to the the {{representation}} of English, existing alphabetical systems have periodically been deemed inadequate and/or inaccurate, and this awareness of the discrepancy between written and oral forms have led “linguists” (in the broadest sense) to devise alternatives. Starting with Orrm, in the twelfth century, spelling reformers have sought to make graphic forms match up with spoken ones, in an idiosyncratic and somewhat haphazard fashion (see Scragg 1974). Their spontaneous metadicourse is lacking in any sophisticated criticism: theirs is simply a negative intuition that the current system fails as a device to record spoken language. However, spelling reformers, right up to the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, never questioned the basic premise of <b>alphabetical</b> <b>notation,</b> but sought only to improve it. In the early eighteenth century, the appearance of pronouncing dictionaries signaled a key rethinking of the old model, with the invention of “respelling”: a representation of language that was graphic, but distinct from spelling; free from that constraint, it became a system flexible enough to show pronunciation, and even to record disagreements among orthoepists regarding pronunciation. From the start, these early transcriptions included information beyond the segmental: for the first time, modifying the traditional orthography was considered not only undesirable, but insufficient to render the complex patterns of speech; eighteenth-century orthoepists initiated a key rethinking of the segmental model of spoken language prevalent since Antiquity. A significant step consisted of formally expressing the principle of bijectivity; spelling reformers had intuited the problem, but they did not explicitly express the idea of “one sound = one spelling” (Beal 1999). In his 1761 Dissertation, Thomas Sheridan did exactly that; and though his own system for respelling did not achieve this ideal, he inspired Thomas Spence, whose Grand repository of the English language is probably the first to use a properly bijective transcription key. The first innovation of pronouncing dictionaries, much earlier in the century, was actually the marking of stress, in Thomas Dyche's Dictionary of Words (1723). This breakthrough is obviously linked to the specificity of English as an stress-timed language; it is revolutionary in the realization that suprasegmental information plays a crucial role in showing pronunciation. The other pivotal innovation consisted of indicating syllable boundaries (in a limited capacity in Bailey 1740; more systematically in Kenrick 1773) : the incorporation of syllabification in the respellings is also linked to a particular feature of English, i. e. the phonotactic constraints on vowels that depend on syllable structure. The inclusion of this suprasegmental layer of information in transcription led certain authors to rethink the nature of the segments themselves, by proposing the possibility of ambisyllabicity for intervocalic consonants. Two of the most influential orthoepists, Sheridan and John Walker, were more famous in their lifetimes for their work on elocution, or what we would now call prosody. What, if any, is the link between this suprasegmental level and the segmental, syllabic, lexical analysis of their respellings...|$|E
