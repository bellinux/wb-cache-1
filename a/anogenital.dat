5|$|Females {{predominantly}} scent mark {{with their}} <b>anogenital</b> scent glands, by squatting to rub their <b>anogenital</b> region along horizontal surfaces, such as tree limbs. Males, {{on the other}} hand, favor using the glands on their neck, muzzle, and chest, by embracing horizontal and vertical surfaces and rubbing themselves over them. Both sexes will occasionally scent mark in ways characteristic of the opposite sex.|$|E
5|$|Some affiliative {{behaviors}} are seasonal or gender-specific, {{such as the}} male squeal approach and <b>anogenital</b> inspections performed during the mating season. Another example is the female greeting behavior, where two females will use their <b>anogenital</b> scent glands to mark each other's backs, jump over one another, writhe together, and emit squealing vocalizations. This behavior is not seen during {{the end of the}} cool, dry season or around gestation. The frequency of other affiliative behaviors can be affected by age. All ruffed lemurs over five months of age allogroom, and, in captivity, subadults participate in play more frequently than adults.|$|E
5|$|Females {{are sexually}} mature at {{seven to eight}} years old, and males at seven to 10 years. The {{beginning}} of a female's ovulation is {{a signal to the}} males that she is ready to mate. During ovulation, the skin of the female's <b>anogenital</b> area swells and turns a bright red/pink. The swelling makes it difficult to move and increases the female's chance of microbial or parasitic infection. Females with more swollen <b>anogenital</b> areas reproduce while younger, produce more offspring per year, and those offspring {{have a better chance of}} surviving. These females also attract more males, and are more likely to cause aggressive fights between them. Olive baboons tend to mate promiscuously. A male forms a mating consortship with an estrous female, staying close to and copulating with her. Males guard their partner against any other male trying to mate with her. Unless a female is in a multiday consortship, she often copulates with more than one male each day. Multiple copulations are not necessary for reproduction, but may function to make the actual paternity of the female's offspring ambiguous. This lack of paternal certainty could help reduce the occurrence of infanticide. Occasionally, male olive baboons monopolize a female for her entire period of probable conception. The male protects his female from being mated by other males during consortship.|$|E
5|$|Olfactory {{communication}} {{is critically important}} for strepsirrhines like the ring-tailed lemur. Males and females scent mark both vertical and horizontal surfaces at the overlaps in their home ranges using their <b>anogenital</b> scent glands. The ring-tailed lemur will perform a handstand to mark vertical surfaces, grasping the highest point with its feet while it applies its scent. Use of scent marking varies by age, sex and social status. Male lemurs use their antebrachial and brachial glands to demarcate territories and maintain intragroup dominance hierarchies. The thorny spur that overlays the antebrachial gland on each wrist is scraped against tree trunks to create grooves anointed with their scent. This is known as spur-marking.|$|E
5|$|Giant mouse lemurs {{are about}} three times larger than mouse lemurs, {{weighing}} approximately , and have a long, bushy tail. They are most closely related to mouse lemurs within Cheirogaleidae, a family of small, nocturnal lemurs. Giant mouse lemurs sleep in nests {{during the day and}} forage alone at night for fruit, tree gum, insects, and small vertebrates. Unlike many other cheirogaleids, they do not enter a state of torpor during the dry season. The northern species is generally more social than the southern species, particularly when nesting, though males and females may form pair bonds. The northern species also has the largest testicle size relative to its body size among all primates and is atypical among lemurs for breeding year-round instead of seasonally. Home ranges often overlap, with related females living closely together while males disperse. Giant mouse lemurs are vocal, although they also scent mark using saliva, urine, and secretions from the <b>anogenital</b> scent gland.|$|E
5|$|Spotted hyenas have {{a complex}} set of postures in communication. When afraid, the ears are folded flat, and are often {{combined}} with baring of the teeth and a flattening of the mane. When attacked by other hyenas or by wild dogs, the hyena lowers its hindquarters. Before and during an assertive attack, the head is held high with the ears cocked, mouth closed, mane erect and the hindquarters high. The tail usually hangs down when neutral, though it will change position according to the situation. When a high tendency to flee an attacker is apparent, the tail is curled below the belly. During an attack, or when excited, the tail is carried forward on the back. An erect tail does not always accompany a hostile encounter, as it has also been observed to occur when a harmless social interaction occurs. Although they do not wag their tails, spotted hyenas will flick their tails when approaching dominant animals or when there is a slight tendency to flee. When approaching a dominant animal, subordinate spotted hyenas will walk on the knees of their forelegs in submission. Greeting ceremonies among clan-members consist of two individuals standing parallel to each other and facing opposite directions. Both individuals raise their hind legs and lick each other's <b>anogenital</b> area. During these greeting ceremonies, the penis or pseudo-penis often becomes erect, in both males and females. Erection is usually a sign of submission, rather than dominance, and is more common in males than in females.|$|E
5|$|The gray wolf's {{expressive}} {{behavior is}} more complex than that of the coyote and golden jackal, as necessitated by its group living and hunting habits. While less gregarious canids generally possess simple repertoires of visual signals, wolves have more varied signals that subtly inter grade in intensity. When neutral, the legs are not stiffened, the tail hangs down loosely, the face is smooth, the lips untensed, and the ears point in no particular direction. Postural communication in wolves consists of a variety of facial expressions, tail positions and piloerection. Aggressive, or self-assertive wolves are characterized by their slow and deliberate movements, high body posture and raised hackles, while submissive ones carry their bodies low, sleeken their fur and lower their ears and tail. When a breeding male encounters a subordinate family member, it may stare at it, standing erect and still with the tails horizontal to its spine. Two forms of submissive behavior are recognized: passive and active. Passive submission usually occurs as a reaction to the approach of a dominant animal, and consists of the submissive wolf lying partly on its back and allowing the dominant wolf to sniff its <b>anogenital</b> area. Active submission occurs often as a form of greeting, and involves the submissive wolf approaching another in a low posture, and licking the other wolf's face. When wolves are together, they commonly indulge in behaviors such as nose pushing, jaw wrestling, cheek rubbing and facial licking. The mouthing of each other's muzzles is a friendly gesture, while clamping on the muzzle with bared teeth is a dominance display.|$|E
25|$|Human HPV {{has long}} been implicated in the {{pathogenesis}} of several <b>anogenital</b> cancers {{including those of the}} anus, vulva, vagina, cervix, and penis. In 2007 it was also implicated by both molecular and epidemiological evidence in cancers arising outside of the <b>anogenital</b> tract, namely oral cancers. HPV infection is common among healthy individuals, and is acquired largely through sexual contact. Although less data is available, prevalence of HPV infection is at least as common among men as among women, with 2004 estimates of about 27% among US women aged 14–59.|$|E
25|$|Newborn {{males are}} {{distinguished}} from newborn females by noting the greater <b>anogenital</b> distance and larger genital papilla in the male. This is best accomplished by lifting the tails of littermates and comparing perineums.|$|E
25|$|Female gray langurs do {{not make}} it obvious {{that they are in}} estrous. However, males are still somehow able to deduce the {{reproduction}} state of females. Females signal that they are ready to mate by shuddering the head, lowering the tail, and presenting their <b>anogenital</b> regions. Such solicitations do not always lead to copulation. When langurs mate, they are sometimes disrupted by other group members. Females have even been recorded mounting other females.|$|E
25|$|Though {{aggression}} {{can occur}} within groups, the response towards intruders of another species {{is much more}} drastic and can involve a sexual dimorphism in displays. Females typically employ scent-marking intruder response tactics, whereas males {{are more prone to}} vocalizing threats, physical aggression, and piloerection. Scent-marking in cotton-top tamarins is done in two ways: either using <b>anogenital</b> scent-marking, or suprapubic scent-marking. The ability to use both of these separate glandular fields for threat signals may indicate females have developed diverging evolutionary threats through differential use of these markings. These variable signals may be used to sign a territorial encounter, or serve as a reproductive signal. The intensity of female threats are generally comparable when directed at intruders of either genders. In contrast, male cotton-tops are considerably more threatening towards fellow males than towards females.|$|E
25|$|It is {{most common}} that mucous {{membrane}} lesions {{of the oral}} cavity are presented first. They can involve the oropharynx, nasopharynx, tongue, and vermilion (red portion) of the lips. They are also known to develop in the conjunctiva of the eye, <b>anogenital</b> (perineum) region, and esophagus. Cutaneous lesions tend to follow the onset of mucosal lesions. The blisters often erupt in waves, usually affecting the upper trunk, head, neck, and proximal extremities. Pemphigoid-like lesions are seen more often on the extremities. Lichenoid lesions are more common among children, presenting on the trunk and limbs, ranging from small red scaly papules to extensive violet to brown papules extending to the face and neck. Within the spectrum of lichenoid presentations are wounds that have features of erythema multiforme and graft-vs.-host disease. Scaly lesions on the palms of the hand and soles of the feet have been noted {{to coincide with the}} lichenoid lesions. Lesions of varying morphology may present simultaneously and transform from one type to another as the disease progresses.|$|E
500|$|Herpes simplex {{is divided}} into two types; [...] HSV-1 causes {{primarily}} mouth, throat, face, eye, and central nervous system infections, whereas HSV-2 causes primarily <b>anogenital</b> infections. [...] However, each may cause infections in all areas.|$|E
500|$|Because {{of their}} smaller home ranges {{relative}} to other sifakas, group encounters are slightly more common, occurring {{a few times a}} month. It has been noted that the temperament of the golden-crowned sifaka is more volatile than that of other sifaka species and, {{in the case of a}} dispute, this animal frequently emits a grunt-like vocalization that seems to signal annoyance. Aggressive interactions between groups are generally non-physical but include loud growling, territorial marking, chasing, and ritualistic leaping displays. Same-sexed individuals act most aggressively towards each other during such encounters. Scent marking is the most common form of territorial defense, with scent marks acting as [...] "signposts" [...] to demarcate territorial boundaries. Females use glands in the genital regions ("anogenital") while males use both <b>anogenital</b> and chest glands.|$|E
500|$|Giant mouse lemurs use {{at least}} eight vocalizations, {{the most common of}} which are contact calls, which sound like [...] "hum" [...] or a [...] "hein" [...] and are used when moving and when meeting {{familiar}} individuals. A [...] "mother-infant meeting call" [...] used at dawn before returning to the nest consists of short, modulated whistles. Both males and females have distinct single note calls used in territorial behavior; the female call sounds like [...] "pfiou" [...] and the male call is a short, loud whistle. Both sexes use an alarm call, which sounds like a [...] "croak", and an agonistic call, which consists of repeated [...] "tisk-tisk-tisk" [...] sounds. Females exhibit a [...] "waking call sequence", sometimes referred to as [...] "loud calls", which start when foraging commences and then switch to quieter [...] "hon" [...] calls possibly to indicate their position to their neighbors. A long [...] "sexual call sequence" [...] consisting of soft whistle and several modulated, hoarse [...] "brroak" [...] calls is used by both sexes during estrus. Studies of captive individuals have found other vocalizations, but their purpose has not been determined. The northern giant mouse lemur appears to be the most vocal of the two species. Although vocalizations are the primary form of social communication, they also scent mark using saliva, urine, and secretions from the <b>anogenital</b> scent gland on small branches and other objects.|$|E
2500|$|As in the U.S., HSV-1 is {{increasingly}} {{identified as the}} cause of [...] HSV-1 was identified in the <b>anogenital</b> area of only 3% of the population in 1980, but had risen to 41% in 2001. This was most common in females and persons under 25.|$|E
2500|$|During {{the mating}} season, {{the face and}} {{genitalia}} of males redden and the tail stands erect. In addition, females' faces and <b>anogenital</b> regions turn scarlet. Macaques copulate both {{on the ground and}} in the trees, and roughly one in three copulations leads to ejaculation. Macaques signal when they are ready to mate by looking backward over a shoulder, staying still, or walking backwards towards their potential partner. A female emits a [...] "smooth-late-high coo", or [...] "squawk", [...] "squeak", or produce an atonal [...] "cackle" [...] during copulation. Males have no copulatory vocalizations.|$|E
2500|$|Human papillomavirus-positive oropharyngeal cancer (HPV+OPC) is a subtype of oropharyngeal {{squamous}} cell carcinomas (OSCC), {{associated with the}} human papillomavirus type 16 virus (HPV16). Historically, cancer of the throat oropharynx (throat) {{was associated with the}} use of alcohol and tobacco, but the majority of cases are now associated with the HPV virus. HPV+OPC differs in a number of respects from OPC not associated with HPV (HPV-OPC), and is considered a separate disease. HPV has long been associated with cancers in the <b>anogenital</b> region, but in 2007 it was also recognized as a cause of oropharyngeal cancer. HPV is common among healthy adults and is largely transmitted through sexual contact, but tobacco use increases the risk of cancer.|$|E
2500|$|Color change: Color {{change can}} be {{separated}} into changes that occur during growth and development, and those triggered by mood, social context, or abiotic factors such as temperature. [...] The latter are seen in many taxa. [...] Some cephalopods, such as the octopus and the cuttlefish, have specialized skin cells (chromatophores) that can change the apparent colour, opacity, and reflectiveness of their skin. In addition to their use for camouflage, rapid changes in skin color are used while hunting and in courtship rituals. Cuttlefish may display two entirely different signals simultaneously from opposite sides of their body. When a male cuttlefish courts a female {{in the presence of}} other males, he displays a male pattern facing the female and a female pattern facing away, to deceive other males. [...] Some color signals occur in cycles. For example, when a female olive baboon begins to ovulate, her <b>anogenital</b> area swells and turns a bright red/pink. This signals to males that she is ready to mate.|$|E
2500|$|HPV oral {{infection}} {{precedes the}} development of HPV+OPC. Slight injuries in the mucous membrane serve as an entry gate for HPV, which thus works into the basal layer of the epithelium. [...] People testing positive for HPV type 16 virus (HPV16) oral infection have a 14 times increased risk of developing HPV+OPC. Immunosuppression {{seems to be an}} increased risk factor for HPV+OPC. Individuals with TGF-β1 genetic variations, specially T869C, {{are more likely to have}} HPV16+OPC. TGF-β1 plays an important role in controlling the immune system. In 1993 it was noted that patients with human papillomavirus (HPV)-associated <b>anogenital</b> cancers had a 4-fold increased risk of tonsillar squamous-cell carcinoma. Although evidence suggests that HPV16 is the main cause of OPC in humans not exposed to smoking and alcohol, the degree to which tobacco and/or alcohol use may contribute to increase the risk of HPV+OPC has not always been clear but it appears that both smoking and HPV infection are independent and additive risk factors for developing OPC. Human herpesvirus-8 infection can potentiate the effects of HPV-16.|$|E
2500|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that differences in penis size between individuals are caused not only by genetics, but also by environmental factors such as culture, diet, and chemical or pollution exposure. Endocrine disruption resulting from chemical exposure has been linked to genital deformation in both sexes (among many other problems). Chemicals from both synthetic (e.g., pesticides, anti-bacterial triclosan, plasticizers for plastics) and natural (e.g., chemicals found in tea tree oil and lavender oil) sources have been linked to various degrees of endocrine disruption. Both PCBs and the plasticizer DEHP have been associated with smaller penis size. DEHP metabolites measured from the urine of pregnant women have been significantly associated with the decreased penis width, shorter <b>anogenital</b> distance, and the incomplete descent of testicles of their newborn sons, replicating effects identified in animals. Approximately 25% of US women have phthalate levels similar to those in the study. A 2007 study by University of Ankara, Faculty of Medicine found that penile size may decrease as a result of some hormonal therapy combined with external beam radiation therapy. [...] In addition, some estrogen-based fertility drugs like diethylstilbestrol (DES) have been linked to genital abnormalities or a smaller than normal penis (microphallus).|$|E
50|$|In a non-clinical {{sample of}} women, digit ratio {{correlated}} with <b>anogenital</b> distance {{in the expected}} direction,i.e., women with a greater <b>anogenital</b> distance, indicating greater prenatal androgen exposure, had a smaller digit ratio.|$|E
