40|$|AbstractThe {{present study}} aims to grasp {{whether there are}} {{differences}} <b>in</b> organizational <b>culture</b> types, <b>in</b> job satisfaction and organizational commitment, and in influences of organizational culture types on job satisfaction and organizational commitment between semiconductor industry and automobile industry. Further, this study intends to propose practical ways to combine the organizational cultures of the both industries with one another by recognizing their differences. First, organizational <b>cultures</b> were recognized <b>in</b> order of rational culture, group <b>culture,</b> development <b>culture</b> <b>and</b> hierarchical <b>culture</b> <b>in</b> semiconductor industry, <b>and</b> in order of rational culture, hierarchical <b>culture,</b> group <b>culture</b> <b>and</b> development <b>culture</b> <b>in</b> automobile industry. Like this, there were differences <b>in</b> the organizational <b>culture</b> types recognized between the both industries. Second, semiconductor industry was high in affective commitment and job satisfaction than automobile industry, but low in normative commitment than automobile industry. Third, job satisfaction was affected by group <b>culture</b> <b>and</b> rational <b>culture</b> <b>in</b> semiconductor industry <b>and</b> by hierarchical <b>culture,</b> group <b>culture</b> <b>and</b> development <b>culture</b> <b>in</b> automobile industry. Affective commitment was affected by group <b>culture</b> <b>and</b> rational <b>culture</b> <b>in</b> semiconductor industry <b>and</b> by development <b>culture</b> <b>and</b> rational <b>culture</b> <b>in</b> automobile industry. Normative commitment was affected by group <b>culture</b> <b>in</b> semiconductor industry <b>and</b> by development <b>culture</b> <b>and</b> rational <b>culture</b> <b>in</b> automobile industry...|$|R

During its history, a number of dynastic kingdoms ruled over parts of South India whose invasions across {{southern}} and southeastern Asia impacted the history <b>and</b> <b>culture</b> <b>in</b> those regions. Major dynasties that were established in South India include the Cheras, Cholas, Pandyas, Pallavas, Satavahanas, Chalukyas, Rashtrakutas and Vijayanagara. European countries entered India through Kerala and the region was colonised by Britain and other nations.|$|E

5|$|Romblon's {{aboriginal}} inhabitants {{were the}} Negritos from Panay and Mangyans from Mindoro, who {{settled in the}} islands during the precolonial period.

5|$|The CNSA {{became a}} major part of {{everyday}} life <b>and</b> <b>culture</b> <b>in</b> occupied Belgium. The organization fulfilled much of the day-to-day running of a welfare system and generally prevented famine, although food and material shortages were extremely common throughout the occupation. At its height, the CNSA had more than 125,000 agents and distributors across the country. Historians have described the CNSA itself, with its central committee and local networks across the country, as paralleling the actions of the official Belgian government in peacetime. In the eyes of contemporaries, the CNSA became a symbol of national unity and of passive resistance.|$|E

5|$|The DuSable Museum is {{the oldest}} and before the {{founding}} of the National Museum of African American History <b>and</b> <b>Culture</b> <b>in</b> the 21st century, the largest caretaker of African American culture in the United States. Over its long history, it has expanded as necessary to reflect the increased interest in black culture. This willingness to adapt has allowed it to survive while other museums faltered due to a weakening economy and decreased public support. The museum was the eighth one located on Park District land. Although it focuses on exhibiting African American culture, it is one of several Chicago museums that celebrates Chicago's ethnic and cultural heritage.|$|E
5|$|As {{a person}} of {{multiple}} talents, Siddiqui was also a refined poet, musician, and a painter. In August 1924, he held his first international exhibition of paintings in Frankfurt. Later in 1927, his works of art were exhibited at the Uzielli Gallery, Frankfurt. During his stay in Germany, he also translated Rainer Maria Rilke's poetry into Urdu, {{which was published in}} the journal of Jamia Millia Islamia. Though, his passion for arts was superseded by the enthusiasm in scientific research, he continued to patronise arts <b>and</b> <b>culture.</b> <b>In</b> 1966, he was at the forefront for setting up the Central Institute of Arts and Crafts in Karachi. He also compiled a selection of poetry of Mir Taqi Mir into Intekhab-e-Meer. In 1983, he published a portfolio collection of charcoal drawings from 1920 to 1950s.|$|E
5|$|During {{a renewed}} {{investigation}} of the crime in 2005, the Department of Justice exhumed Till's remains to conduct an autopsy and DNA analysis which confirmed the identification of his body. Till was reburied in a new casket later that year. In 2009, his original glass-topped casket was found, rusting in a dilapidated storage shed at the cemetery. The casket was discolored and the interior fabric torn. It bore evidence that animals {{had been living in}} it, although its glass top was still intact. The Smithsonian's National Museum of African American History <b>and</b> <b>Culture</b> <b>in</b> Washington, D.C. acquired the casket a month later. According to director Lonnie Bunch III, it is an artifact with the potential to stop future visitors and make them think.|$|E

5|$|Following World War I, Mashbir held a {{position}} teaching military science and tactics at Syracuse University, where he first considered studying the Japanese language <b>and</b> <b>culture.</b> <b>In</b> August 1919, {{he asked the}} War Department if he could embark on this course of study, stating {{that it was his}} intention to apply for a posting to Japan for the purpose of learning the language if the War Department saw fit. Ranked captain, Mashbir was assigned as one of four US Army Language Officers in Japan on 7 July 1920. He relocated to Tokyo the following month to begin his four-year tour. When he arrived he reported for duty to Lieutenant Colonel Charles Burnett, the military attachÃ©. Having few Army colleagues, while in Tokyo Mashbir sought the company of other intelligence professionals in the navy, one of whom was an assistant naval attachÃ©, Lieutenant-Commander Ellis M. Zacharias, with whom Mashbir began a lifelong friendship and collaboration. In July 1922, at Zacharias' request, Mashbir secretly worked day and night to produce a secret plan to gather intelligence and get information out of Japan in case of war; it become known as M-Plan, named after Mashbir. His undisclosed activities working for the naval attachÃ© did not sit well with his superiors, however.|$|E
5|$|Knudtzon {{was born}} in Trondheim in SÃ¸r-TrÃ¸ndelag; he was the sixth and {{youngest}} child of Hans Carl Knudtzon (1751â€“1823), a merchant and burgomaster, and Karen Knudtzon (nÃ©e MÃ¼ller, 1752â€“1818). Knudtzon's father was of German origin and had moved to Norway to further {{his career as a}} merchant. His firm was flourishing financially, and the Knudtzon family became a rallying point for Trondheim's artists and authors. Having spent his childhood in Trondheim, Broder Knudtzon moved to Flensburg, Germany in 1796 to live in the house of his father's uncle. Upon his confirmation, Knudtzon travelled back to Trondheim where he was apprenticed to his father. He subsequently travelled around in France in search of a mercantile education; in Paris he met the Danish poet and playwright Adam OehlenschlÃ¤ger. After a brief visit to his sister in Nantes, he relocated to England, where he came in contact with poet Lord Byron and other leading figures in the national liberal movement. During his stay in England, he acquired a great fondness and knowledge of the English language, literature <b>and</b> <b>culture.</b> <b>In</b> a later trip to Italy he met the Danish-Icelandic sculptor Bertel Thorvaldsen, who made portrait busts of him and other persons in his family.|$|E
5|$|Modern {{linguists}} divide Celtic languages {{into two}} major groups, the P-Celtic, {{from which the}} Brythonic languages: Welsh, Breton, Cornish and Cumbric derive, and the Q-Celtic, from which come the Goidelic languages: Irish, Manx and Gaelic. The Pictish language remains enigmatic, since the Picts had no written script {{of their own and}} all that survives are place names and some isolated inscriptions in Irish ogham script. Most modern linguists accept that, although the nature and unity of Pictish language is unclear, it belonged to the former group. Historical sources, as well as place name evidence, indicate {{the ways in which the}} Pictish language in the north and Cumbric languages in the south were overlaid and replaced by Gaelic, Old English and later Norse in this period. By the High Middle Ages the majority of people within Scotland spoke the Gaelic language, then simply called Scottish, or in Latin, lingua Scotica. The Kingdom of Alba was overwhelmingly an oral society dominated by Gaelic culture. Our fuller sources for Ireland of the same period suggest that there would have been filidh, who acted as poets, musicians and historians, often attached to the court of a lord or king, and passed on their knowledge <b>and</b> <b>culture</b> <b>in</b> Gaelic to the next generation.|$|E
