5|$|Although the Romans {{had a more}} hostile {{attitude}} {{than the}} Greeks towards the Egyptians, some traditions such as mummification <b>and</b> <b>worship</b> of the traditional gods continued.

The former lived outside Egypt and did not perform the ceremonial functions of Egyptian kingship. Local administration became Roman in style and closed to native Egyptians.|$|E

5|$|Paulinus {{remained}} in Kent until 625, {{when he was}} consecrated as bishop by Justus, the Archbishop of Canterbury, on 21 July. He then accompanied Æthelburg, the sister of King Eadbald, to Northumbria where she was to marry King Edwin. A condition of the marriage was that Edwin had promised that he would allow Æthelburg to remain a Christian <b>and</b> <b>worship</b> as she chose. Bede, writing in the early 8th century, reports that Paulinus wished to convert the Northumbrians, {{as well as provide}} religious services to the new queen.|$|E

In keeping with the racial transformation, the cultural and religious institutions, including those of Irish Catholics, Greek Orthodoxy and the Jewish faith, converted to African American institutions.

This led to further hostilities toward Dissenters, which were heightened after the failed Monmouth rebellion, in which a large number of Dissenters fought against the King's forces. After the Glorious Revolution removed James II, his successor William III introduced the Act of Toleration 1689, which specifically allowed nonconformist worship.|$|E

Although the band intended to write material for a new album during the tour, they had only written one song {{by the time they}} entered their recording studio, Cider Mountain Studio in Athol, Idaho. The band wrote so many songs at the studio that they decided not to include any cover songs; all of the songs on the album but were written or co-written by the band. The album was described as being a rock <b>and</b> <b>worship</b> album, being aimed directly at a Christian audience.|$|E
5|$|Basil cultivars are {{cultivated}} {{varieties of}} basil. They {{are used in}} a variety of ways: as culinary herbs, landscape plants, healing herbs, teas, <b>and</b> <b>worship</b> implements. All true basils are species of the genus Ocimum. The genus is particularly diverse, and includes annuals, non-woody perennials and shrubs native to Africa and other tropical and subtropical regions of the Old and New World. Although it is estimated that there are 50 to 150 species of basil, most, but not all, culinary basils are cultivars of O. basilicum, or sweet basil. Some are cultivars of other basil species, and others are hybrids. It is particularly challenging to determine which species a basil belongs to. This is because basil cross-breeds easily, and drawing boundaries between species is particularly difficult. In fact, recent studies have led to reclassification of some portions of the genus.|$|E
5|$|Canada is religiously diverse, {{encompassing}} a {{wide range}} of beliefs and customs. Canada has no official church, and the government is officially committed to religious pluralism. Freedom of religion in Canada is a constitutionally protected right, allowing individuals to assemble <b>and</b> <b>worship</b> without limitation or interference. The practice of religion is now generally considered a private matter throughout society and the state. With Christianity in decline after having once been central and integral to Canadian culture and daily life, Canada has become a post-Christian, secular state. The majority of Canadians consider religion to be unimportant in their daily lives, but still believe in God. According to the 2011 census, 67.3% of Canadians identify as Christian; of these, Roman Catholics make up the largest group, accounting for 38.7% of the population. Much of the remainder is made up of Protestants, who accounted for approximately 27% in a 2011 survey. The largest Protestant denomination is the United Church of Canada (accounting for 6.1% of Canadians), followed by Anglicans (5.0%), and Baptists (1.9%). Secularization has been growing since the 1960s. In 2011, 23.9% declared no religious affiliation, compared to 16.5% in 2001. The remaining 8.8% are affiliated with non-Christian religions, the largest of which are Islam (3.2%) and Hinduism (1.5%).|$|E

5|$|Khandoba is also {{a figure}} of respect <b>and</b> <b>worship</b> to Muslims, and this {{affiliation}} is visible {{in the style of}} his temples. He is called Mallu or Ajmat Khan (Rautray) by Muslim devotees, and many times portrayed as being a Muslim himself in this context. The latter is believed to conferred upon by the Mughal invader king Aurangzeb, who was forced to flee from Jejuri by Khandoba's power. Some of these distinguishing Muslim features include his usual appearance as that of a Paṭhān on horseback, one of his wives being a Muslim, and that his horse-keeper is a Muslim in Jejuri. The Mārtaṇḍa Vijaya expressly states that his devotees are mainly Muslims. The worship of Khandoba had received royal patronage by Ibrahim II, which consisted of the reinstatement of the annual jatra and the right of pilgrims to perform rituals at the Naldurg temple. Malhari Mahatmya even records Muslims (mleccha) as the god's bhaktas (devotees), who call him as Malluka Pathan or Mallu Khan. In Jejuri, a Muslim family traditionally looks after the horses of the god.|$|E
5|$|Prior to {{the closure}} of the chapel in the 1980s, the size of the {{congregation}} had declined and the fabric of the building was deteriorating. In 1978 the decorative plaster ceiling was replaced with a suspended ceiling of acoustic tiles, with further repairs carried out under the Manpower Services Commission. During the course of these repairs, discussions took place {{about the future of the}} building and its dwindling congregation. None of the ideas for developing the building came to fruition, <b>and</b> <b>worship</b> in the chapel ended in December 1985. Permission to demolish the building was refused because of its listed status. It was bought by a private individual in 1987, but the plan to convert it into a nightclub was declined. The building was acquired by the Bethesda Heritage Trust in 2000. After the Bethesda Heritage Trust failed to raise sufficient finance to continue worship, in 2002 it passed into the ownership of the Historic Chapels Trust, an organisation which aims to find community uses for the buildings in its care.|$|E
5|$|Ramram hoped his {{son would}} {{follow in his}} profession, but Ramprasad showed no {{interest}} in practical pursuits. As he grew up, his spiritual inclinations caused {{a great deal of}} anxiety to his parents. Believing that marriage would make Ramprasad more responsible, his parents married him to a girl named Sarvani when he was twenty-two years old. In keeping with the family custom, the newly wed couple was initiated by the family's spiritual teacher, Madhavacharya. According to traditional accounts, during initiation when the guru whispered the mantra to him, Ramprasad became consumed by intense longing for the goddess Kali. One year after the initiation he lost his guru. Ramprasad later became the disciple of Krishnananda Agamavagisha, a Tantric yogi and scholar. Agamavagisha was a well known devotee of Kali {{and the author of the}} Bengali book Tantrasara. Agamavagisha instructed Ramprasad in Tantric sadhanas (spiritual disciplines) <b>and</b> <b>worship</b> of Kali.|$|E
