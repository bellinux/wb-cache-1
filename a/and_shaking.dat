5|$|In {{addition}} to this primary compression wave, other waves, known as harmonics, are created. Harmonics are caused by factors including the imperfect wobbling <b>and</b> <b>shaking</b> of the reed, the reed sealing the mouthpiece opening {{for part of the}} wave cycle (which creates a flattened section of the sound wave), and imperfections (bumps and holes) in the bore. A wide variety of compression waves are created, but only some (primarily the odd harmonics) are reinforced. These extra waves are what gives the clarinet its characteristic tone.|$|E
5|$|Ken Ralston and {{his team}} at Industrial Light & Magic were {{responsible}} for the film's visual effects. Using CGI techniques, it was possible to depict Gump meeting deceased personages <b>and</b> <b>shaking</b> their hands. Hanks was first shot against a blue screen along with reference markers so that he could line up with the archive footage. To record the voices of the historical figures, voice actors were filmed and special effects were used to alter lip-syncing for the new dialogue. Archival footage was used {{and with the help of}} such techniques as chroma key, image warping, morphing, and rotoscoping, Hanks was integrated into it.|$|E
5|$|On November1, 1941, the Rainbow Bridge {{was officially}} opened during a simple ceremony. The oldest living couple {{known to have}} wed in Niagara Falls, a pair from Pennsylvania, {{were the first to}} cross, {{followed}} by a newlywed couple from Georgia. This symbolically tied the history of the two bridges together, and was followed by McQuesten and Johnson walking towards the centre of the structure from the Canadian and American sides, respectively, <b>and</b> <b>shaking</b> hands at the centre. Several pyrotechnic explosions at both ends capped the ceremony, and the bridge was opened to traffic.|$|E

5|$|Set during autumn, Through the Looking-Glass {{begins with}} Alice indoors as she {{plays with the}} kittens of her pet cat, Dinah. Through a mirror, she travels to the {{alternative}} world behind the mirror, where chess pieces are alive. Encountering various characters, she eventually becomes a queen, and attends a party celebrating her coronation, although it quickly grows chaotic. Grabbing <b>and</b> <b>shaking</b> the Red Queen, Alice awakens back indoors, holding one of the kittens. The novel concludes with Alice's speculation {{on whether or not}} it was her dream or the Red King's.|$|E
5|$|A 2004 review {{reported}} 46% of bites occurring on distal extremities of the limbs, 25% on proximal {{areas of}} limbs (upper arms and thighs), 21% on the trunk, and 7% {{on the head}} or neck. In some cases the same spider bites a victim multiple times. Historically, victims were often bitten on the genitalia, though this phenomenon disappeared as outhouses were superseded by plumbed indoor toilets. Conversely, bites {{on the head and}} neck have increased with use of safety helmets and ear muffs. Precautions to avoid being bitten include wearing gloves and shoes while gardening, not leaving clothes on the floor, <b>and</b> <b>shaking</b> out gloves or shoes before putting them on. Also, children can be educated not to touch spiders.|$|E
5|$|In April 1989, Voight {{returned}} to Colombia to the volcano Galeras after being {{contacted by the}} United Nations Disaster Relief Organization. People in Pasto, located {{at the foot of}} the volcano, had become alarmed by noises <b>and</b> <b>shaking</b> from Galeras. While Galeras proved far easier to climb than Nevado del Ruiz, land mines planted to hinder guerrilla forces dotted the slopes of the mountain. With USGS geologist Dick Janda, Voight drew a hazard map that included several populated areas within the danger zone. Before Voight left Galeras, the volcano underwent an unexpected phreatic eruption, which Voight and his team failed to predict. Although Pasto was unaffected, six scientists attending a United Nations workshop for natural disaster relief were killed. After reviewing deformation data from the day before the eruption, Voight discovered that no acceleration in the deformation process had occurred. He surmised that phreatic eruptions do not exhibit an acceleration in deformation before taking place and left after confirming that the volcano's monitoring system functioned properly.|$|E

50|$|Two basic {{types of}} wood {{shingles}} are called shingles <b>and</b> <b>shakes.</b> The difference is {{in how they}} are made, the shingles are sawn <b>and</b> <b>shakes</b> are split. Wood shingles <b>and</b> <b>shakes</b> have long been known as a fire hazard and have been banned in various places, particularly in urban areas where exterior, combustible building materials contribute to devastating fires known as conflagrations.|$|R
5|$|They {{arrive at}} a cave. Tintin ventures inside and finds Chang, who is feverish <b>and</b> <b>shaking.</b> The Yeti {{suddenly}} appears, revealed as a large anthropoid, reacting with anger at Tintin's attempt to take Chang. As it lunges at Tintin, the flash bulb of Tintin's camera goes off, and scares the Yeti away. Chang tells Tintin that the Yeti saved his life after the crash. Upon returning to inhabited lands, the friends are surprised to be met by the Grand Abbot, who presents Tintin with a khata in honour of the bravery he has shown for his friend Chang. As the party travels home, Chang muses that the Yeti is not a wild animal, but has a human soul. The Yeti sadly watches their departure from a distance.|$|E
5|$|The {{dreadnought}} race {{stepped up}} in 1910 and 1911, with Germany laying down four capital ships {{each year and}} the United Kingdom five. Tension {{came to a head}} following the German Naval Law of 1912. This proposed a fleet of 33 German battleships and battlecruisers, outnumbering the Royal Navy in home waters. To make matters worse for the United Kingdom, the Imperial Austro-Hungarian Navy was building four dreadnoughts, while the Italians had four and were building two more. Against such threats, the Royal Navy could no longer guarantee vital British interests. The United Kingdom was faced with a choice of building more battleships, withdrawing from the Mediterranean, or seeking an alliance with France. Further naval construction was unacceptably expensive at a time when social welfare provision was making calls on the budget. Withdrawing from the Mediterranean would mean a huge loss of influence, weakening British diplomacy in the Mediterranean <b>and</b> <b>shaking</b> the stability of the British Empire. The only acceptable option, and the one recommended by First Lord of the Admiralty Winston Churchill, was to break with the policies of the past and make an arrangement with France. The French would assume responsibility for checking Italy and Austria-Hungary in the Mediterranean, while the British would protect the north coast of France. In spite of some opposition from British politicians, the Royal Navy organised itself on this basis in 1912.|$|E
5|$|The video {{begins on}} a city {{sidewalk}} where Scherzinger walks into a telephone booth as several men in black suits pass by the booth. As Scherzinger begins to undress, the men stop to stare as she begins taking off her glasses <b>and</b> <b>shaking</b> her hair back. The video then moves to Scherzinger in a dress walking past four men mopping the floor to a supply closet where she enters and reappears moments later, {{dressed in a black}} body suit with a cape. As the chorus begins, the situation rapidly switches back-and-forth from Scherzinger in her good-girl persona shown fighting escaped jail prisoners dressed in striped suits (and Beagle Boys masks) to Scherzinger in her bad-girl persona fighting with police. As the song progresses, Scherzinger is shown in a classic looking automobile and riding a BMW motorcycle, with a streaking white and black background. Several shots of her bad-girl persona alone in a room with two prisoners are then shown. As the bridge begins, she is shown in her good-girl ego standing by a podium, talking to a group of reporters while waving her hands in the air. As the bridge ends, she brings her hands down, blowing back all of the reporters, who then begin dancing and pumping their arms to the song. The video moves to Scherzinger dancing with the police and prisoners before ending with her blowing away the two men who were in the room with her and walking away.|$|E

25|$|He had a {{productive}} 2006-07 domestic season for Auckland, claiming 32 wickets at 18.78 in New Zealand's domestic first-class State Championship and scoring 318 runs at 39.75. However, this was overshadowed by his one-month suspension for grabbing <b>and</b> <b>shaking</b> the helmet of Central Districts batsman Bevan Griggs. He was overlooked again the following season, despite impressive {{performances in the}} State Championship, and the frustration prompted him to sign a two-year contract with the now defunct Indian Cricket League.|$|E
25|$|They {{typically}} forage {{by keeping}} their heads {{close to the}} ground, jabbing their bills into mud when something edible is encountered. When capturing fish or other slippery prey, they may quickly jab {{in a similar fashion}} to a heron. Although animal prey can be swallowed whole, usually red-crowned cranes more often tear up prey by grasping with their bills <b>and</b> <b>shaking</b> it vigorously, eating pieces as they fall apart. Most foraging occurs in wet grasslands, cultivated fields, and shallow rivers, or on lakeshores.|$|E
25|$|In {{the course}} of his career, Roose also turned out for Port Vale and Celtic (both 1910). He played one game for Celtic, and it was a Scottish Cup semi-final in which Celtic lost 1–3 to Clyde on 12 March 1910. He made his mark on this game by running after the goalscorer of one of the Clyde goals <b>and</b> <b>shaking</b> his hand! Other clubs he {{represented}} on at least one occasion included Druids, Huddersfield Town (1910–1911), Aston Villa (1911) and Woolwich Arsenal (1911–1912).|$|E

25|$|The {{asymmetric}} profile {{across a}} trench reflects fundamental differences in materials and tectonic evolution. The outer trench wall and outer swell comprise seafloor that takes several million years {{to move from}} where subduction-related deformation begins to sinking beneath the overriding plate. In contrast, the inner trench wall is deformed by plate interactions for the entire life of the convergent margin. The forearc is continuously subjected to subduction-related deformation and earthquakes. This protracted deformation <b>and</b> <b>shaking</b> ensures that the inner trench slope {{is controlled by the}} angle of repose of whatever material comprises it. Because the inner slope of non-accretionary trenches are composed of igneous and metamorphic rocks instead of deformed sediments, these trenches have steeper inner walls than accretionary trenches.|$|E
25|$|The {{consumption}} of wine by Parisians increased during the Second Empire, while the quality decreased. It was unusual {{for women to}} drink, but for both the workers and {{the middle and upper}} classes, wine was part of the daily meal. The number of debits de boissons, bars where wine was sold, doubled. Ordinary wine was produced by mixing several different wines of different qualities from different places in a cask <b>and</b> <b>shaking</b> it. The wine sold as ordinary Mâcon was made by mixing wine from Beaujolais, Tavel and Bergerac. The best wines were treated much more respectfully; in 1855, Napoleon III ordered the classification of Bordeaux wines by place of origin and quality, so that they could be displayed and sold at the Paris Universal Exposition.|$|E
25|$|Nicholson and Avery set up SHAC in 1999, {{along with}} Natasha Dellemagne, to close Huntingdon Life Sciences (HLS). The company was saved when the British {{government}} provided it with banking facilities, after the UK's major banks severed ties {{with it as}} a result of the campaign. HLS is Europe's largest contract animal-testing company, testing everything from pesticides to drugs, on behalf of commercial clients, on around 75,000 animals a year, including rats, rabbits, pigs, dogs, and primates. HLS was the subject of an undercover investigation by the British Union for the Abolition of Vivisection in 1989, which alleged that workers routinely mishandled the animals. Nicholson, Avery, and Dellemagne set up SHAC in November 1999, after People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals obtained undercover footage showed HLS staff punching <b>and</b> <b>shaking</b> beagles in the company's laboratory in Cambridge, England.|$|E
