25|$|Republican {{conservatives are}} strongest in the South, Mountain West and Midwest, where they draw support from social conservatives. The moderates tend to {{dominate}} the party in New England, and used to be well represented in all states. From the 1940s to the 1970s under such leaders as Dwight D. Eisenhower, Richard Nixon, and Gerald Ford, they usually dominated the presidential wing of the party. Since the 1970s, they have been less powerful, though they are always represented in the cabinets of Republican presidents.
