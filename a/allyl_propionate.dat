40|$|Metathesis of allyl acetate, <b>allyl</b> <b>propionate</b> and {{allyl hexanoate}} {{was carried out}} using the heterogenized form of methyl trioxorhenium (MTO) and {{homogeneous}} and heterogeneous forms of Grubbs 2 nd (G), Hoveyda-Grubbs 2 nd (H-G) generation catalysts. In all cases {{it was found that}} the reaction rate and total achieved conversion increased with increasing length of chain of the substrate. A comparison of all used catalysts showed that homogeneous Ru carbene catalysts are significantly more active compared to MTO. In the heterogeneous arrangement Grubbs 2 nd generation and Hoveyda-Grubbs 2 nd generation catalysts are more predisposed for deactivation by solvent. The results obtained using the heterogeneous form of the Hoveyda –Grubbs 2 nd generation catalyst were comparable to the best results obtained using MTO. Moreover, when using MTO the selectivity to but- 2 -ene- 1, 4 -diyl dialkylate was in all cases 100 %. Keywords...|$|E
40|$|Synthetic {{fragrances}} {{are part}} of many consumer products, from which they get to waste water and to water recipient due to imperfect cleaning. Musk compounds {{can be found in}} almost every parts of nature environment. Purpose of this bachelor thesis was assesment of selected representatives linear musk compounds, concretely citronellol, isobornyl acetate, <b>allyl</b> cyklohexyl <b>propionate</b> and hexylcinnamic aldehyde. This analytes were determined in waste water in inflow and outflow from wastewater treatment plant in Brno-Modřice and wastewater treatment plant in area Veterinary and Pharmaceutical university Brno. Analytes were extracted by using method of solid phase microextraction, final assesment was done method of gas chromatography with mass spectrometry detection. Results were evaluated and it was found, that musk compounds are present in waste water in concentration range from 0, 01 to 3, 6 ng/ml...|$|R
40|$|Synthetic musk {{compounds}} are artificial {{organic compounds}} with a smell {{similar to the}} odor of a natural musk. The most recently discovered and also the least known group of artificial musks is linear musk compounds. These substances are now often used in cosmetics, personal care products, detergents and various cleaning products. They have leaked into all the major environment components, especially into the hydrosphere. There has been great attention drawn to synthetic musk compounds {{in the last few}} years because of their environmental impact. The aim of this thesis is to identify twelve linear musk compounds (linalool, 2 -cyclohexylethanol, fresco menthe, citronellol, HSA, isobornyl acetate, arocet, aroflorone, <b>allyl</b> cyclohexyl <b>propionate,</b> lilial, isoamyl salicylate and hexylcinnamic aldehyde) in waste water samples. The samples were taken at three different waste water treatment plants (WWTP) in South Moravian region (WWTP Brno-Modřice, WWTP Luhačovice and WWTP Hodonín). Each of these treatment plants has a different equivalent number of inhabitants. At first, a working method was optimized, then applied on real waste water samples. Solid-phase microextraction (SPME) technique was used for the extraction of analytes. Gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC/MS) was then used for identification and quantificaton of the studied compounds...|$|R
