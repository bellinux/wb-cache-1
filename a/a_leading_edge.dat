5|$|The Hunter is a {{conventional}} swept wing all-metal monoplane. The fuselage is of monocoque construction, with a removable rear section for engine maintenance. The engine is fed through triangular air intakes in the wing roots {{and has a}} single jetpipe {{in the rear of}} the fuselage. The mid-mounted wings have <b>a</b> <b>leading</b> <b>edge</b> sweep of 35° and slight anhedral, the tailplanes and fin are also swept. The Hunter's aerodynamic qualities were increasingly infringed upon by modifications in later production models, such as the addition of external containers to collect spent gun cartridges, underwing fuel tanks to increase range, leading edge extensions to resolve pitch control difficulties, and a large ventral air brake.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. In {{order to}} {{research}} the effects of <b>leading</b> <b>edge</b> shapes {{on the strength of}} centrifugal compressor compeller, the shrouded impellers of a large centrifugal compressor were introduced for finite element analysis. In the present study, the geometric models of 3 shrouded impellers were established in Solidworks 2007, and then numerical simulations were carried out using ANSYS. Through visualization of the computational result of the impellers with <b>a</b> square <b>leading</b> <b>edge,</b> <b>a</b> semi-circular <b>leading</b> <b>edge</b> and <b>a</b> elliptical <b>leading</b> <b>edge,</b> it was clarified by comparison that different <b>leading</b> <b>edge</b> shapes had significant influences on the compressor strength. According to the charts of the Von Mises stress versus <b>leading</b> <b>edge</b> shapes, it was indicated that approximately a 27 % drop and a 32 % drop in maximum Von Mises stress value occurred in the shrouded impellers of <b>a</b> semi-circular <b>leading</b> <b>edge</b> and <b>a</b> elliptical <b>leading</b> <b>edge</b> compared to <b>a</b> square <b>leading</b> <b>edge</b> respectively. That is, the semi-circular <b>leading</b> <b>edge</b> or elliptical <b>leading</b> <b>edge</b> employed in <b>a</b> centrifugal compressor would dramatically improve structural strength.

5|$|Enterprise NX-01 was {{designed}} by Doug Drexler, {{and based on the}} features of the Akira-class. The new class itself was designated as NX by the producers, but Drexler referred to it as the Enterprise-class due to the naval tradition of naming the class after the first vessel. Drexler had intended for the ship to be similar in design to the Daedalus-class starship with a sphere-shaped primary hull, but the producers wanted a flat saucer-shaped hull as it was more immediately recognizable as a Star Trek vessel. Drexler deliberately attempted to insert references to The Original Series into the ship. One of these was narrow struts leading from the body of the ship to the warp nacelles – however Dan Curry wanted them made bulkier as seen in ships of later series. Drexler included <b>a</b> <b>leading</b> <b>edge</b> {{at the front of the}} nacelles, and later described that the original struts would have been around a third more than those.|$|E
5|$|The 767 entered {{service with}} United Airlines on September 8, 1982. The aircraft's first {{commercial}} flight used a JT9D-powered 767-200 on the Chicago-to-Denver route. The CF6-powered 767-200 commenced service {{three months later}} with Delta Air Lines. Upon delivery, early 767s were mainly deployed on domestic routes, including US transcontinental services. American Airlines and TWA began flying the 767-200 in late 1982, while Air Canada, China Airlines, and El Al began operating the aircraft in 1983. The aircraft's introduction was relatively smooth, with few operational glitches and greater dispatch reliability than prior jetliners. In its first year, the 767 logged a 96.1percent dispatch rate, which exceeded the industry average for new aircraft. Operators reported generally favorable ratings for the twinjet's sound levels, interior comfort, and economic performance. Resolved issues were minor and included the recalibration of <b>a</b> <b>leading</b> <b>edge</b> sensor to prevent false readings, the replacement of an evacuation slide latch, and the repair of a tailplane pivot to match production specifications.|$|E

25|$|The {{much longer}} and heavier MG FF {{had to be}} mounted farther along the wing in an outer bay. A large hole was cut through the spar {{allowing}} the cannon to be fitted with the ammunition feed forward of the spar, while the breech block projected rearward through the spar.

25|$|The wing is of single-spar {{construction}} that {{passes through the}} aircraft's fuselage. The wingspan and total length of the Canberra are almost identical at just under 20 metres.

All flight controls are manual, using push-rods rather than cables, but are otherwise conventional. These actuate the aircraft's flight control surfaces, including shrouded-nosed ailerons, four-section conventional split-type flaps, and atypical airbrakes which comprise 40 hydraulically-raised fingers located {{on the top and}} bottom surfaces of the wings. Swept-wings were considered, but not adopted, since the expected operational speeds did not warrant them and because they could have introduced new aerodynamic problems into what was otherwise anticipated to be a straightforward replacement for RAF Hawker Typhoon and Westland Whirlwind fighter-bombers.|$|E

25|$|In the {{electrical}} schematic to the right, a typical silicon-controlled rectifier (SCR) based light dimmer dims the light through phase angle control. This unit is {{wired in series}} with the load. Diodes (D2, D3, D4 and D5) form a bridge which generates pulsed DC. R1 and C1 form a circuit with a time constant. As the voltage increases from zero (at the start of every halfwave) C1 will charge up. When C1 is able to make Zener diode D6 conduct and inject current into the SCR, the SCR will fire. When the SCR conducts then D1 will discharge C1 via the SCR. The SCR will shut off when the current falls to zero when the supply voltage drops {{at the end of}} the half cycle, ready for the circuit to start work on the next half cycle.

25|$|After this high, {{the series}} took a severe {{downturn}} for Cook as his only {{appearance in the}} third Test was a duck. With no second innings to redeem himself, pressure began to mount on Cook for the fourth Test at Headingley where he anchored himself through half the team before being dismissed half-way through the first innings for only 30, a score which would only be topped by wicket-keeper Matt Prior as England collapsed to Australia's seam attack, bowled out for 102. Though the team batted better in the second innings Cook again was the fifth man out for another 30 as England succumbed to an innings defeat, with Australia levelling the series needing only to draw at the Oval to retain the Ashes. During the fortnight break Cook was among a quintet of players released into the County Championship to increase their form alongside. In the first-class match against Middlesex both he and Bopara failed in the first innings, with scores of 4 and 1, but Cook top scored in the second innings with 64 to push Essex towards victory. Of the five released, Cook was among three picked for the final and decisive Oval Test and didn't start well being dismissed with only 12 runs on the board, ten of them his. However, in the field Cook was part of Australia's first innings collapse, taking two catches off Graeme Swann to dismiss the top scoring opener Simon Katich and the penultimate wicket of Stuart Clark. Working with a 172 run lead on the second evening, Strauss and Cook's steady partnership was ended prematurely with Cook dismissed for 9 in his final innings of the series. Despite this Cook ended the series on something of a high in his fielding position at short leg, taking a catch off Steve Harmison's second wicket in two balls for the penultimate wicket and then taking the winning catch of <b>a</b> <b>leading</b> <b>edge</b> from the defiant Michael Hussey for 121 off Swann to seal the Ashes victory.|$|E
500|$|Most insects create lift by the stiff-winged {{mechanism}} of insect flight with steady state aerodynamics; this creates <b>a</b> <b>leading</b> <b>edge</b> vortex continuously as the wing moves. The feathery wings of thrips, however, generate lift by clap and fling, a mechanism {{discovered by the}} Danish zoologist Torkel Weis-Fogh in 1973. In the clap part of the cycle, the wings approach {{each other over the}} insect's back, creating a circulation of air which sets up vortices and generates useful forces on the wings. The leading edges of the wings touch, and the wings rotates around their leading edges, bringing them together in the [...] "clap". The wings close, expelling air from between them, giving more useful thrust. The wings rotate around their trailing edges to begin the [...] "fling", creating useful forces. The leading edges move apart, making air rush in between them and setting up new vortices, generating more force on the wings. The trailing edge vortices however cancel each other out with opposing flows. Weis-Fogh suggested that this cancellation might help the circulation of air to grow more rapidly, by shutting down the Wagner effect which would otherwise counteract the growth of the circulation.|$|E

500|$|Aerodynamic {{studies in}} the 1960s {{demonstrated}} that the [...] "vortex lift" [...] phenomenon could be harnessed by highly swept wing configurations to reach higher angles of attack, using leading edge vortex flow off a slender lifting surface. As the F-16 was being optimized for high combat agility, GD's designers chose a slender cropped-delta wing with <b>a</b> <b>leading</b> <b>edge</b> sweep of 40° and a straight trailing edge. To improve maneuverability, a variable-camber wing with a NACA 64A-204 airfoil was selected; the camber is adjusted by leading-edge and trailing edge flaperons linked to a digital flight control system (FCS) regulating the flight envelope. The F-16 has a moderate wing loading, reduced by fuselage lift. The vortex lift effect is increased by leading edge extensions, known as strakes. Strakes act as additional short-span, triangular wings running from the wing root (the juncture with the fuselage) to a point further forward on the fuselage. Blended into the fuselage and along the wing root, the strake generates a high-speed vortex that remains attached {{to the top of}} the wing as the angle of attack increases, generating additional lift and allowing greater angles of attack without stalling. Strakes allow a smaller, lower-aspect-ratio wing, which increases roll rates and directional stability while decreasing weight. Deeper wingroots also increase structural strength and internal fuel volume.|$|E
500|$|After {{winning the}} toss, England opted to put Bangladesh into bat, but their new-ball bowlers failed to {{maintain}} a good line and length, providing opener Tamim Iqbal with plenty of bad deliveries to put away for boundaries.

Two more wickets followed closely as Junaid Siddique hit a half-volley softly to the fielder at square leg in the next over, and then Aftab Ahmed was run out in the 13th over, leaving Bangladesh with 82 runs {{for the loss of}} three wickets (82/3). Captain Shakib Al Hasan and vice-captain Mushfiqur Rahim both provided Tamim with some support, but both were undone by their own rashness; Shakib advanced down the wicket to Graeme Swann and provided an edge for Matt Prior to catch behind the stumps, while Mushfiqur attempted a run which was never available and presented Kevin Pietersen with his second run out of the match. Tamim alone provided resistance, showing [...] "imperious strokeplay all around the ground" [...] and a measure of maturity in his innings. His 125 came off 120 balls, including 13 fours and 3 sixes, eventually being dismissed in the 43rd over, bowled by Broad, with Bangladesh on 214/9. The final two batsmen lasted three overs, adding 14 to score, leaving England requiring 229 to win.|$|E

2500|$|One {{measure of}} the quality of <b>a</b> <b>leading</b> <b>edge</b> dimmer is the [...] "rise time".

A longer rise time reduces the noise of the dimmer and the lamp as well as extending the life of the lamp. A longer rise time also reduces the electromagnetic interference produced by the dimmer. Unsurprisingly, a longer rise time is more expensive to implement than a short one, this is because the size of choke has to be increased. Newer dimming methods can help minimize such problems.|$|E
