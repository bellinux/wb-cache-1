5|$|A small insectivorous bird, it {{is subject}} to {{predation}} by mammals, such as cats and mustelids, and birds, particularly hawks of the genus Accipiter. Its large range <b>and</b> <b>population</b> mean that its status is secure, although one subspecies is probably extinct.|$|E
5|$|Extinction is {{the result}} of the {{elimination}} of the geographic range of a species with a reduction of its population size down to zero.

50|$|Different {{subspecies}} <b>and</b> <b>populations</b> {{have different}} migratory behaviour. Subspecies <b>and</b> <b>populations</b> that are insular or live in warmer areas are confirmed to be sedentary. The tropical subspecies <b>and</b> <b>populations</b> migrate, but {{to an extent}} that is still unclear for lack of data. The migratory behaviour of the yellow-crowned night heron has changed with its expansion north: one subspecies (Nyctanassa violacea violacea) migrates to the northern limits of its range, moving north and west after breeding. Birds observed outside of the normal range are usually first-years or strays.|$|R

5|$|Aircraft {{were used}} for reconnaissance, as fighters, bombers, and ground-support, and each role was {{advanced}} considerably. Innovation included airlift (the capability to quickly move limited high-priority supplies, equipment, and personnel); and of strategic bombing (the bombing of enemy industrial <b>and</b> <b>population</b> centres to destroy the enemy's ability to wage war). Anti-aircraft weaponry also advanced, including defences such as radar and surface-to-air artillery, such as the German 88 mm gun. The use of the jet aircraft was pioneered and, though late introduction meant it had little impact, it led to jets becoming standard in air forces worldwide.|$|E
5|$|All three {{thresher}} shark species were reassessed from Data Deficient to Vulnerable by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) in 2007. The rapid {{collapse of the}} Californian subpopulation (over 50% within three generations) prompted concerns regarding the species' susceptibility to overfishing in other areas, where fishery data is seldom reported and aspects of life history <b>and</b> <b>population</b> structure are little-known. In addition to continued fishing pressure, common threshers are also taken as bycatch in other gear such as bottom trawls and fish traps, and are considered a nuisance by mackerel fishers as they become entangled in the nets.|$|E

Gangtok does not have its own police commissionerate like other major cities in India. Instead, it comes {{under the jurisdiction of the}} state police, which is headed by a Director General of Police, although an Inspector General of Police oversees the town. Sikkim is known for its very low crime rate. Rongyek jail in Gangtok is Sikkim's only central jail.|$|E
5|$|At {{the time}} of human {{settlement}} of the Americas, the California condor was widespread across North America; condor bones from the late Pleistocene have been found at the Cutler Fossil Site in southern Florida. However, {{at the end of}} the last glacial period came the extinction of the megafauna that led to a subsequent reduction in range <b>and</b> <b>population.</b> Five hundred years ago, the California condor roamed across the American Southwest and West Coast. Faunal remains of condors have been found documented in Arizona, Nevada, New Mexico, and Texas. The Lewis and Clark Expedition of the early 19th century reported on their sighting and shooting of California condors near the mouth of the Columbia River.|$|E

5|$|Because the {{bigeye sand tiger}} is {{encountered}} so infrequently, it has no commercial importance. It {{is caught}} incidentally on longlines and in gillnets and purse seines, though the paucity of captures suggest that it mostly lives in waters too deep for commercial fisheries. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has listed this species as Data Deficient, citing a lack of biological <b>and</b> <b>population</b> data. Since 1997, the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) has prohibited the taking of this species in United States waters.|$|E

40|$|In {{order to}} {{elucidate}} the taxonomic {{status of the}} Fejervarya limnocharis complex relative to Malaysia <b>and</b> Japan <b>populations,</b> morphological observations <b>and</b> molecular phylogenetic analysis were carried out using three populations from Indonesia (type locality), Malaysia, and Japan. In addition, we conducted histological and spermatogenic observations using hybrids among these <b>populations.</b> Principal component <b>and</b> cluster analyses demonstrated that these populations could be clearly separated from one another. Abnormal testes {{were found in the}} hybrids between the Japan <b>and</b> Indonesia <b>populations</b> <b>and</b> between the Japan <b>and</b> Malaysia <b>populations,</b> but testes of the controls and hybrids between the Malaysia <b>and</b> Indonesia <b>populations</b> were quite normal.
