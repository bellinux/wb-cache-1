40|$|An {{analytical}} model for dynamics of wind-vehicle-bridge (WVB) systems {{is presented in}} this paper in the time domain with wind, rail vehicles <b>and</b> <b>bridge</b> modeled as a coupled vibration system. The {{analytical model}} considers many special issues in a WVB system, which include fluid-solid interaction between wind <b>and</b> <b>bridge,</b> solid contact between vehicles <b>and</b> <b>bridge,</b> stochastic wind excitation on vehicles <b>and</b> <b>bridge,</b> time dependence of the system due to vehicle movement, <b>and</b> effect of <b>bridge</b> deck on vehicle wind load and vice versa. The models of wind, vehicles <b>and</b> <b>bridge</b> are presented with wind velocity fluctuations simulated using the simplified spectral representation method, with vehicles modeled as mass-spring-damper systems, <b>and</b> with <b>bridge</b> represented by a finite element model. The interactions between wind <b>and</b> <b>bridge</b> are similar to those considered in conventional buffeting analysis for long span bridges. In considering difficulties in measuring aerodynamic coefficients of moving vehicles on bridge deck, the cosine rule is adopted for the aerodynamic coefficients of moving vehicles to consider yaw angle effect, and expressions of wind forces on moving vehicles are then derived for engineering application. To include mutual effects of wind loads, aerodynamic parameters of vehicles <b>and</b> <b>bridge</b> deck are measured, respectively, using a composite section model test and a specially designed test device. The dynamic interaction between vehicle <b>and</b> <b>bridge</b> depends on both geometric and mechanical relationships between wheels of vehicles and rails on the bridge deck. The equations of motion of the coupled WVB system are derived and solved with a nonlinear iterative procedure. A cable-stayed bridge in China is finally selected as a numerical example to demonstrate dynamic interaction of the WVB system. The results show the validity of the present model as well as wind effects on the rail vehicles <b>and</b> the <b>bridge.</b> Department of Civil and Environmental Engineerin...|$|R

40|$|The {{article is}} about a control design for {{complete}} structure of the crane: crab, <b>bridge</b> <b>and</b> crane uplift. The most important unknown parameters for simulations are burden weight and length of hanging rope. We will use robust control for crab <b>and</b> <b>bridge</b> control to ensure adaptivity for burden weight and rope length. Robust control will be designed for current control of the crab <b>and</b> <b>bridge,</b> necessary is to know the range of unknown parameters. Whole robust will be split to subintervals and after correct identification of unknown parameters the most suitable robust controllers will be chosen. The most important condition at the crab <b>and</b> <b>bridge</b> motion is avoiding from burden swinging in the final position. Crab <b>and</b> <b>bridge</b> drive is designed by asynchronous motor fed from frequency converter. We will use crane uplift with burden weight observer in combination for uplift, crab <b>and</b> <b>bridge</b> drive with cooperation of their parameters: burden weight, rope length <b>and</b> crab <b>and</b> <b>bridge</b> position. Controllers are designed by state control method. We will use preferably a disturbance observer which will identify burden weight as a disturbance. The system will be working in both modes at empty hook {{as well as at}} maximum load: burden uplifting and dropping down. For uplift drive we will use an asynchronous motor fed from frequency converter. Simulations are proposed for situation that firstly we do uplift and then switching block realize simultaneous crab <b>and</b> <b>bridge</b> motion. At simulations it is possible to choose different burden weight, rope length, crab <b>and</b> <b>bridge</b> positions <b>and</b> speeds...|$|R

5|$|About 40 {{years after}} {{nationalisation}} British Rail was privatised {{and the old}} name was revived by Great Western Trains, the train operating company providing passenger services on the old GWR routes to South Wales and the South West, which subsequently became First Great Western {{as part of the}} FirstGroup but in September 2015 changed its name to Great Western Railway in order to 'reinstate the ideals of our founder'. The operating infrastructure, however, was transferred to Railtrack and has since passed to Network Rail. These companies have continued to preserve appropriate parts of its stations <b>and</b> <b>bridges</b> so historic GWR structures can still be recognised around the network.|$|E

5|$|Although Gert's center {{remained}} off {{the coast}} of Costa Rica, its large circulation produced brisk winds and heavy rainfall across the country. A local weather station recorded 13.1inches (332mm) of rain during the storm. Geologically, the hardest-hit regions consisted of sedimentary layers with poor hydraulic conductivity and were therefore prone to soil saturation. The initial rainfall raised the levels of many rivers, exacerbating the flood threat. The imminent overflow of the Tempisque River prompted wide-scale evacuations, though the river crested gradually without major consequence. After hours of prolonged rainfall, many Pacific regions such as Quepos, Pérez Zeledón, and Osa experienced flooding and landslides, which inflicted moderate damage to roads <b>and</b> <b>bridges.</b>|$|E
