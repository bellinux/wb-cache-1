5|$|A {{tropical}} wave emerged off {{the western}} coast of Africa on August27 {{and reached the}} eastern Pacific on September7. Tracking westward, little development occurred until September18, when associated shower and thunderstorm activity began to increase. Following visible satellite trends, the National Hurricane Center deemed the disturbance organized enough to be declared a tropical depression at 0600UTC on September19, while located about 1,200mi (1930km) west-southwest of {{the southern tip of}} Baja California. In <b>an</b> <b>environment</b> <b>of</b> cool ocean temperatures and stable air, the depression failed to organize as it turned west-northwest. Associated deep convection dissipated, leading to degeneration into a remnant low by 0000UTC on September20. Performing a slow counter-clockwise loop, the remnant low dissipated five days later.|$|E
5|$|A {{tropical}} wave emerged off {{the western}} coast of Africa on June23. It reached the eastern Pacific on July3, where associated convection began to increase three days later. Continued slow development occurred thereafter, and following satellite trends, the disturbance was upgraded to Tropical Depression Four-E at 1800UTC on July9. Tracking westward, the depression {{began to move}} across waters too cool to support a tropical cyclone and into <b>an</b> <b>environment</b> <b>of</b> moderate shear. The low-level circulation became ill-defined and exposed, leading to degeneration to a remnant low at 0600UTC on July11 about 910mi (1465km) west-southwest of Cabo San Lucas, Mexico. The low continued northwest until dissipation at 0000UTC the following day.|$|E
5|$|A trough {{developed}} {{along the}} northeast monsoon on 25October 2015 off the southwest coast of India, {{consisting of a}} fragmented area of convection, or thunderstorms. The system was located within <b>an</b> <b>environment</b> <b>of</b> moderate wind shear, which prevented early development, although conditions were anticipated to become more favorable. On 26October, the system developed a distinct low pressure area. The low gradually consolidated, and the circulation became better defined, amplified by decreasing wind shear and good outflow {{to the north and}} south. At 03:00UTC on 28October, the India Meteorological Department (IMD) designated the system as a depression. Nine hours later, the agency upgraded it further to a deep depression, and the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) classified the system as Tropical Cyclone 04A at 21:00UTC.|$|E

5|$|Hurricane Isabel was the costliest, deadliest, and strongest {{hurricane}} in the 2003 Atlantic hurricane season. The ninth named storm, fifth hurricane, {{and second}} major hurricane of the season, Isabel formed near the Cape Verde Islands from a tropical wave on September 6 {{in the tropical}} Atlantic Ocean. It moved northwestward, and within <b>an</b> <b>environment</b> <b>of</b> light wind shear and warm waters it steadily strengthened to reach peak winds of 165mph (265km/h) on September 11. After fluctuating in intensity for four days, Isabel gradually weakened and made landfall on the Outer Banks of North Carolina with winds of 105mph (165km/h) on September 18. It quickly weakened over land and became extratropical over western Pennsylvania the next day.|$|E

5|$|On June21, a {{tropical}} wave emerged off the western coast of Africa. It entered the eastern Pacific on July10, and shower and thunderstorm activity began to increase {{a day later}} as a result. Tracking westward, the wave gradually became better organized; by 1200UTC on July14, the disturbance acquired enough organization to be upgraded to {{a tropical}} depression. Within <b>an</b> <b>environment</b> <b>of</b> moderate wind shear, the low-level center quickly became poorly defined as convection dissipated. Turning west-northwest on July15, the depression entered cooler waters and an increasingly stable airmass, causing the system to degenerate into a remnant low by 0000UTC the following day. The remnant low dissipated a few hours later.|$|E
5|$|On May20, {{following}} Typhoon Brenda's {{passage through}} the South China Sea, a monsoon trough extending from the area into the Bay of Bengal received enhanced low-level southwesterly flow. <b>An</b> <b>environment</b> <b>of</b> weak wind shear {{in the wake of}} the typhoon allowed a new area of low pressure to form within the southwesterly flow on May21. With convection becoming persistent and the system's overall presentation more organized by May22, the JTWC issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert at 0300UTC. Around this time, the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) classified the system as a tropical depression. Later that day, convection wrapped entirely around the center of circulation; this structural improvement, combined with nearby surface observations, prompted the JTWC to designate the system as Tropical Storm Cecil.|$|E

5|$|The {{effects of}} Hurricane Isabel in Maryland and Washington, D.C., {{were among the}} most {{damaging}} from a tropical cyclone in the Baltimore-Washington Metropolitan Area, United States.

5|$|Tropical Storm Jerry was a {{short-lived}} tropical storm that {{formed in the}} latter half of the 2001 Atlantic hurricane season. Forming as a tropical depression from a tropical wave on October 6 near Barbados, Jerry intensified into a tropical storm early the following day on October 7 while initially located under <b>an</b> <b>environment</b> <b>of</b> weak vertical wind shear. After reaching its peak of 50 mph (80km/h), Jerry passed just south of Barbados late on October 7 and through the Windward Islands on October 8. Shortly after entering the eastern Caribbean Sea, moderate upper-level wind shear affected Jerry's upper-level outflow, and the cyclone weakened to a depression shortly afterwards. Deterioration in organization continued, and Jerry dissipated while moving rapidly westward well south of Puerto Rico. Jerry caused minimal effects in the Lesser Antilles.|$|E
5|$|A broad area of low {{pressure}} formed at the tail-end of a stationary front, organizing into a tropical depression by 18:00UTC on October28 about 520mi (835km) south-southeast of Bermuda. Steered west-northwest and then sharply northeast ahead {{of an approaching}} cold front, the system intensified into Tropical Storm Shary six hours after formation. Within <b>an</b> <b>environment</b> <b>of</b> low wind shear, Shary strengthened into a hurricane and attained peak winds of 75mph (120km/h) by 00:00UTC on October30 as an eye became apparent on microwave imagery. The storm became increasingly asymmetric as it interacted with the front, and Shary transitioned into an extratropical cyclone by 18:00UTC that day. The extratropical system was completely absorbed by the front six hours later. Since Shary remained south and east of Bermuda, its effects were limited to 0.54in (13.7mm) of rainfall and a gust to 35mph (56km/h).|$|E
5|$|A poorly {{organized}} tropical wave {{moved into}} the eastern Pacific on August29 and quickly developed into a tropical depression by 0600UTC the following day. Within <b>an</b> <b>environment</b> <b>of</b> low wind shear, the depression intensified into a tropical storm, acquiring the name Henriette, at 1200UTC on August31. Moving west-northwest around a ridge positioned over inland Mexico, the center passed narrowly offshore after producing squally weather along the coastline. The system moved westward while continuing to intensify, becoming a Category1 hurricane at 0600UTC on September4 and subsequently attaining its peak intensity with winds of 85mph (140km/h) and a minimum barometric pressure of 972mb (hPa; 28.71inHg) six hours later. An approaching upper-level trough caused Henriette to turn northwest later that day, moving it ashore near San Jose del Cabo, Mexico at 2100UTC as a minimal hurricane. After crossing Baja California Sur, Henriette weakened to a tropical storm and made a second landfall near Guaymas, Mexico. The system moved inland and quickly weakened, dissipating by 1200UTC on September6.|$|E
