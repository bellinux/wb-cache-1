40|$|INTRODUCTION: Intercultural {{communication}} (ICC) between {{doctors and}} patients {{is often associated with}} misunderstandings and dissatisfaction. To develop ICC-specific medical education, it is important to find out which ICC skills medical specialists currently apply in daily clinical consultations. METHODS: Doctor-patient consultations of Dutch doctors with non-Dutch patients were videotaped in a multi-ethnic hospital in the Netherlands. The consultations were analyzed using the validated MAAS-Global <b>assessment</b> <b>list</b> in combination with factors influencing ICC, as described in the literature. RESULTS: In total, 39 videotaped consultations were analyzed. The doctors proved to be capable of practising many communication skills, such as listening and empathic communication behaviour. Other skills were not practised, such as being culturally aware and checking the patient's language ability. CONCLUSION: We showed that doctors did practice some but not all the relevant ICC skills and that the ICC style of the doctors was mainly biomedically centred. Furthermore, we discussed the possible overlap between intercultural and patient-centred communication. Implications for practice could be to implement the relevant ICC skills in the existing communication training or develop a communication training with a patient-centred approach including ICC skills...|$|E

To effectively monitor performance in practice throughout the entire training, a new approach of assessment is needed. This study aimed to evaluate an instrument that monitors the development of competencies during postgraduate training {{in the setting of}} training of general practice: the Competency <b>Assessment</b> <b>List</b> (Compass). METHODS: The distribution of scores, reliability, validity, responsiveness and feasibility of the Compass were evaluated. RESULTS: Scores of the Compass ranged from 1 to 9 on a 10 -point scale, showing excellent internal consistency ranging from. 89 to. 94. Most trainees showed improving ratings during training. Medium to large effect sizes (. 31 - 1. 41) were demonstrated when we compared mean scores of three consecutive periods.

Subjects (ns 105) with {{major depressive disorder}} (ns 85), depressive disorder not otherwise specified (ns 7) or major depressive disorder with axis I comorbidity (ns 13) were followed for 6 months. Their coping behavior (i. e. rumination, active distraction, cognitive distraction and dangerous activities) was defined using the Comprehensive <b>Assessment</b> <b>List</b> for Affective Disorders. Based on their Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HRSD) scores at 6 months, the patients were categorized as having had a good or a poor outcome. Severity of depression and coping behavior were similar among the three diagnostic groups. At baseline assessment, coping behavior was not correlated with either HRSD score or age. However, males {{were significantly more likely}} to be engaged in dangerous activity as a coping behavior than females. Patients with a good outcome at 6 months {{were significantly more likely to}} use rumination as a coping behavior while patients with a poor outcome were significantly more likely to use dangerous activity.

One key element that contributes to this delay is a prodromal symptom presentation that may impede quick assessment and streamline treatment for cardiovascular events. The aims of this project, using best evidence and initial testing with data from Arizona Health Sciences Center Clinical Research Data Warehouse, is to construct a women's Cardiac Prodromal Symptoms Recognition <b>Assessment</b> <b>List</b> to increase early recognition of cardiovascular etiology, resulting in earlier diagnostics and treatment. A literature review was completed to determine a list of current cardiac prodromal symptoms in women. Symptom data was mined from the clinical research data warehouse and compared to the symptom list. The project results support that prodromal symptoms are valid as identifiers of women experiencing a cardiac event. The literature review identified ten prodromal symptoms; Chest Pain/Discomfort, Shortness of Breath, Fatigue, Arm/Shoulder Pain, Weakness, Nausea/Indigestion, Back Pain, Jaw Pain, Sleep Disturbance and Dizziness/Syncope that are consistent in the literature. The Clinical Research Data Warehouse (CRDW) clinical elements did match the literature prodromal symptoms list with the additional elements of edema defined as a physical finding and depression defined as a risk factor. Application of the literature review and mined clinical data provide an opportunity to explore a clinical issue such as cardiac prodromal symptoms recognition for women and to assist providers in rapid identification and treatment initiation for women experiencing cardiac events...|$|E

Results From 1951 to 2007, 14 epidemiological studies (including 2 cohort studies, 3 case-control studies, and 9 cross-sectional studies/population surveys) were included. Two different results could be extracted from five studies (based on different types of exposure), leading to 19 results, 12 for manual work (9 studies), and 7 for vibration exposure (5 studies). Six studies met the HQMC, yielding 9 results, 5 for manual work and 4 for vibration exposure. Five studies found a dose-response relationship.

This {{study sought to}} assess the impact of co-ordinated multidisciplinary care in primary care, represented by the delivery of formal care planning by primary care teams or shared across primary-secondary teams, on outcomes in stroke, relative to usual care. Methods A Systematic review of Medline, EMBASE, CINAHL (all 1990 – 2006), Cochrane Library (Issue 1 2006), and grey literature from web based searching of web sites listed in the CCOHA Health Technology <b>Assessment</b> <b>List</b> Analysis used narrative analysis of findings of randomised and non-randomised trials, and observational and qualitative studies of patients with completed stroke in the primary care setting where care planning was undertaken by 1) a multi-disciplinary primary care team or 2) through shared care by primary and secondary providers. Results One thousand and forty-five citations were retrieved. Eighteen papers were included for analysis. Most care planning took part in the context of multidisciplinary team care based in hospitals with outreach to community patients. Mortality rates are not impacted by multidisciplinary care planning. Functional outcomes of the studies were inconsistent. It is uncertain whether the active engagement of GPs and other primary care professionals in the multidisciplinary care planning contributed to the outcomes in the studies showing a positive effect. There may be process benefits from multidisciplinary care planning that includes primary care professionals and GPs. Few studies actually described the tasks and roles GPs fulfilled and whether this matched what was presumed to be provided. Conclusion While multidisciplinary care planning may not unequivocally improve the care of patients with completed stroke, there may be process benefits such as improved task allocation between providers. Further study on the impact of active GP involvement in multidisciplinary care planning is warranted. </p...|$|E

40|$|Background: Improvements in diet and/or {{exercise}} {{are often}} advocated during prostate cancer treatment, yet the efficacy of, and optimal nutrition and exercise prescription for managing cancer-related fatigue {{and quality of}} life remains elusive. The aim {{of this study is to}} systematically review the effects of nutrition and/or exercise on cancer-related fatigue and/or quality of life. Methods: A literature search was conducted in six electronic databases. The Delphi quality <b>assessment</b> <b>list</b> was used to evaluate the methodological quality of the literature. The study characteristics and results were summarized in accordance with the review’s Population, Intervention, Control, Outcome (PICO) criteria. Results: A total of 20 articles (one diet only, two combined diet and exercise, and seventeen exercise only studies) were included in the review. Soy supplementation improved quality of life, but resulted in several adverse effects. Prescribing healthy eating guidelines with combined resistance training and aerobic exercise improved cancer-related fatigue, yet its effect on quality of life was inconclusive. Combined resistance training with aerobic exercise showed improvements in cancer-related fatigue {{and quality of life}}. In isolation, resistance training appears to be more effective in improving cancer-related fatigue and quality of life than aerobic exercise. Studies that utilised an exercise professional to supervise the exercise sessions were more likely to report improvements in both cancer-related fatigue and quality of life than those prescribing unsupervised or partially supervised sessions. Neither exercise frequency nor duration appeared to influence cancer-related fatigue or quality of life, with further research required to explore the potential dose-response effect of exercise intensity. Conclusion: Supervised moderate-hard resistance training with or without moderate-vigorous aerobic exercise appears to improve cancer-related fatigue and quality of life. Targeted physiological pathways suggest dietary intervention may alleviate cancer-related fatigue and improve quality of life, however the efficacy of nutrition management with or without exercise prescription requires further exploration...|$|E
40|$|A {{major problem}} in substance-abuse {{treatment}} is the high dropout rate. If length of time in treatment is associated with better outcomes and is partly determined by motivation to quit using—or readiness for change—then finding a reliable way to measure such readiness is important. Prochaska and DiClemente 2 ̆ 7 s transtheoretical model of behavior change has conceptualized and operationalized readiness for change as a process consisting of five stages: precontemplation, contemplation, preparation, action, and maintenance (Prochaska 2 ̆ 6 DiClemente, 1992). This study tested {{the ability of the}} widely influential University of Rhode Island Change Assessment Scale (URICA; McConnaughy, Prochaska, 2 ̆ 6 Velicer, 1983) to predict dropout, both on its own and in conjunction with hypothesized risk factors, in two samples of cocaine-dependent women and alcohol-dependent outpatients. Subjects 2 ̆ 7 reasons for dropout were taken into account when determining dropout status for survival analyses; the study also examined the URICA 2 ̆ 7 s psychometric properties. In the cocaine-dependent sample, the URICA failed to predict dropout, but another measure of motivation, the Motivation <b>Assessment</b> <b>List</b> for Cocaine (MAL-C; Goehl, Childress, McLellan, 2 ̆ 6 Gordon, 1994) significantly interacted with age and days worked. In the alcohol-dependent sample, the URICA did not predict dropout on its own, but the URICA × Psychiatric Symptoms interaction was significant; age of drinking onset and alcohol severity also significantly interacted with the URICA. In both samples, the interaction patterns were the same, with the presence of risk factors being particularly detrimental to low-readiness patients. Among the risk factors, individual predictors of early dropout were younger age and having more psychiatric symptoms, an earlier age of drinking onset, and more legal problems. The URICA 2 ̆ 7 s internal consistency and test-retest reliability were good, and the factor and cluster structures essentially replicated previous findings, but the instrument demonstrated little convergence with other measures of readiness for change, with one exception. The study shows that the URICA interacts with other risk factors for dropout to identify individuals at risk for early termination. ...|$|E
