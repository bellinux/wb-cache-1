40|$|Background: Intrauterine growth {{restriction}} (IUGR) affects 5 – 10 % of all newborns and {{is associated}} with increased risk of memory, attention and anxiety problems in late childhood and adolescence. The neurostructural correlates of long-term abnormal neurodevelopment associated with IUGR are unknown. Thus, {{the aim of this}} study was to provide a comprehensive description of the long-term functional and neurostructural correlates of abnormal neurodevelopment associated with IUGR in <b>a</b> <b>near-term</b> rabbit <b>model</b> (delivered at 30 days of gestation) and evaluate the development of quantitative imaging biomarkers of abnormal neurodevelopment based on diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) parameters and connectivity. Methodology: At + 70 postnatal days, 10 cases and 11 controls were functionally evaluated with the Open Field Behavioral Test which evaluates anxiety and attention and the Object Recognition Task that evaluates short-term memory and attention. Subsequently, brains were collected, fixed and a high resolution MRI was performed. Differences in diffusion parameters were analyzed by means of voxel-based and connectivity analysis measuring the number of fibers reconstructed within anxiety, attention and short-term memory networks over the total fibers. Principal Findings: The results of the neurobehavioral and cognitive assessment showed a significant higher degree of anxiety, attention and memory problems in cases compared to controls in most of the variables explored.

40|$|Michigan Aerospace has {{developed}} an Autonomous Satellite Docking System (ASDS) design along with mission concepts for the Orbital Express program. The new design and mission concepts are based on analysis and technology assessments performed {{as part of a}} Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) Phase I SBIR, in the areas of docking mechanisms and servicing systems, Guidance, Navigation, and Control (GNC), rendezvous and docking sensors, and avionics.

40|$|Some model {{experiments}} {{predict a}} large-scale substitution of Amazon forest by savannah-like vegetation {{by the end}} of the twenty-first century. Expanding global demands for biofuels and grains, positive feedbacks in the Amazon forest fire regime and drought may drive a faster process of forest degradation that could lead to <b>a</b> <b>near-term</b> forest dieback. Rising worldwide demands for biofuel and meat are creating powerful new incentives for agro-industrial expansion into Amazon forest regions. Forest fires, drought and logging increase susceptibility to further burning while deforestation and smoke can inhibit rainfall, exacerbating fire risk. If sea surface temperature anomalies (such as El Niño episodes) and associated Amazon droughts of the last decade continue into the future, approximately 55 % of the forests of the Amazon will be cleared, logged, damaged by drought or burned over the next 20 years, emitting 15 – 26  Pg of carbon to the atmosphere. Several important trends could prevent <b>a</b> <b>near-term</b> dieback. <b>As</b> fire-sensitive investments accumulate in the landscape, property holders use less fire and invest more in fire control. Commodity markets are demanding higher environmental performance from farmers and cattle ranchers. Protected areas have been established in the pathway of expanding agricultural frontiers.
