50|$|Afforestation of the {{shifting}} sands {{on the north}} side of the Warren began in 1947, partly to protect the village. Artificial dunes were created and the area planted with Corsican and Scots pine. During the late 1970s and 1980s and mid-1990s there were concerns that the water levels within the forest and within neighbouring Warren were falling due to a greater potential evaporation demand caused by afforestation, with the result that winter flooding was not to the same depth and that dune slack pools were drying out sooner. However most UK <b>Atlantic</b> <b>dune</b> systems also reported low water tables, due mainly to low winter rainfall during these times. To address these concerns clearings have been created in the forest, and the forest bordering the warren was heavily thinned. Proposals where put forward in 2004 to remove large parts of the forest. The local community and some conservation groups objected and the forestry Commission and the Countryside council for Wales are currently carrying out a public consultation that will shape the future management of the Newborough woodland.|$|E
40|$|Plant-parasitic {{nematodes}} {{are involved}} in soil fatigue processes in coastal foredunes and, therefore, {{have an impact on}} the growth of plants such as marram grass (Ammophila arenaria) that enhance sand accretion and the stabilisation of dunes. Transects were sampled in European Atlantic and Mediterranean foredunes at different locations. Plant-parasitic nematode communities and physico-chemical soil properties were analysed, and multivariate techniques were used to link them. Although all the dunes are of sandy texture, the <b>Atlantic</b> and Mediterranean <b>dunes</b> mainly differ by their ratio of coarse and fine sands. Mediterranean dunes, although more disturbed by storms than the <b>Atlantic</b> <b>dunes,</b> have fine-textured soils that can accumulate organic matter. They trap a large amount of minerals and have a high carbonate concentration due to the salinity of the Mediterranean Sea. As a result of the higher content of coarse sand in the top horizons, probably due to a higher accretion of sand, Atlantic foredune soils are low in organic matter and minerals. Soils from North and Irish Sea dunes have intermediate characteristics. These soil contrasts lead to specific plant-parasitic nematode communities. Thus, nematodes such as Hemicycliophora spp., Neodolichorhynchus spp., Longidorus spp. and Merlinius spp. generally colonise the carbonated and mineralised soils of the Mediterranean dunes, and do not seem to be affected by high salinity. Conversely, populations of Meloidogyne spp. and Pratylenchus spp. nematodes are more commonly found in coarse textured soils and the oligotrophic conditions that occur in <b>Atlantic</b> <b>dunes.</b> Specific local conditions such as the presence of paleosols do not seem to disturb them. Considering that both nematode species are major pests in cropping systems, higher population levels due to their fit to such soil characteristics can explain their contribution to soil fatigue encountered in <b>Atlantic</b> <b>dunes...</b>|$|R

Considering the agronomic and market possibilities for this specie we characterized C. album populations along its biogeographical area. The results show that different seeds characteristics differ significantly between sites. We also tested the effect of pretreatments on the germination of C. album seeds (subsp. album). Seeds were collected from Duna de Quiaios in 2011, from Comporta in 2011 and Aldeia do Meco in 2011 and in 2012. The results {{show that there is}} site-to-site variation in the same year and year-to-year variation in a particular site in percentage of germinated seeds. Acid scarification (30, 60 and 120 minutes) followed by 1000 ppm of gibberellic acid was the most effective pretreatment in breaking dormancy of C. album and this pretreatment promote the best germination from seeds collected from Aldeia do Meco 2011 (30. 3 %) after 175 days. Our results suggest that the seeds had morphophysiological dormancy.

50|$|The upper Pamet River {{is made up}} of a {{freshwater}} marsh. The marsh {{occupies the}} broad floor of the upper Pamet River valley. Originally, 12,000-13,000 years ago, this was the glacial outwash channel that drained water away from the glacier westward, northward and finally eastward into the Atlantic some distance from where Provincetown now lies. Sea level was then 300 to 400 ft lower than it is today. There was no Cape Cod Bay, and Stellwagen Bank and the Grand Banks were hills well above the ocean. The subsequent rise of the Atlantic Ocean, which continues to this day, nearly drowned the outer Cape, including the Pamet, which is now only four miles long, compared to 30 mi long thousands of years ago. This upper freshwater marsh dates from the middle 19th century, when, to promote agriculture, the saltwater tides were prevented from entering by means of a dike that traverses the valley where Route 6A (Truro Center Road) now passes. A one-way clapper valve permitted fresh water to leave at low tide. The result is the meandering, slow-flowing stream that flows from the <b>Atlantic</b> <b>dunes</b> at Ballston Beach west to the bay, with low, flat banks that lie just above the water table. The entire valley, fresh and salt, is underlain by a thick mat of peat derived from the original salt marshes. All plant species growing in this upper portion were brought in as seeds, mostly by birds and mammals. All are indigenous, and virtually none is tolerant of seawater.|$|R

40|$|Acacia longifolia is an {{invasive}} woody legume in many coastal {{sand dunes}} ecosystems around the world. A useful option {{to aid in}} the restoration of invaded areas after acacia removal is the revegetation of the newly open areas using appropriate native dune plants. A field experiment was performed to determine whether two shrubby legumes native to European <b>Atlantic</b> coastal <b>dunes,</b> Cytisus grandiflorus (Brot.) DC. and Ulex europaeus europaeus subsp. latebracteatus (Mariz) Rothm., are suitable to revegetate areas formerly invaded by A. longifolia. Plants of both species were grown for 5  months in a greenhouse and subsequently transplanted to three sites in a coastal dune ecosystem. We monitored survival and growth during 21  months. The effect of soil fertility at the nursery and of root nodulation on the performance of these species in the field was also analyzed. Soil fertility and nodulation had a significant effect on plant growth at the nursery, but only the symbiosis with root nodulating bacteria had a significant positive effect on the survival of both native legumes in the field and on final plant height of U. europaeus plants. We conclude that (1) both native legumes can successfully establish on sites where A. longifolia has been previously removed, thus providing a suitable tool to help in the restoration of invaded areas, and (2) the symbiosis with root nodulating bacteria is crucial for plant performance in the field...|$|R

40|$|Aerial photographs, {{maps and}} {{optically}} stimulated luminescence dates were combined with existing soil data to construct high resolution chronosequences of soil development over 140 years at a temperate <b>Atlantic</b> UK <b>dune</b> system. Since soil formation had progressed for varying duration under different climate and nitrogen deposition regimes, {{it was possible to}} infer their relative influence on soil development compared with location-specific variables such as soil pH, slope and distance to the sea. Results suggest that soil development followed a sigmoid curve. Soil development was faster in wet than in dry dune habitats. In dry dunes, rates were greater than in the literature: they increased with increasing temperature and nitrogen deposition and decreased with increasing summer gales. The combination explained 62 % of the variation. Co-correlation meant that effects of nitrogen deposition could not be differentiated from temperature. In wet dune habitats rates increased with temperature and decreased with gales. The combination explained only 23 % of the variation; surprisingly, rainfall was not significant. Effects of location-specific variables were not significant in either habitat type. Nitrogen accumulation was faster in wet than dry dune habitats, averaging 43 kg N ha− 1 per year overall. Nitrogen accumulation greatly exceeded inputs from atmospheric deposition, suggesting rates of input for biological N fixation are 10 – 60 kg N ha− 1 per year. Recent climate and/or nitrogen deposition regimes may have accelerated soil development compared with past rates. These data suggest the importance of changing climate on soil development rates and highlight the contribution of biological N fixation in early successional systems...|$|R

40|$|Recent major {{meteorological}} {{events like}} Katrina (2005) or Xynthia (2010) {{were at the}} origin of erosion periods, overwash phenomena and also breaching processes in the coastal shore. Suchstorm events have caused flood damage with disastrous consequences. The associated hydrodynamic and morphological phenomena which modify the beach and coastal dunes morphology during storm events are still not widely enough known {{to be able to}} evaluate the level of protection offered by this natural defense system. In this study we focus on the processes which contribute to sand dune systems destruction/breaching induced by storm events. These processes are linked to the structure type and morphology of the coastal shore and the hydraulic loading (due to tides, waves and surges) which is exerted on it. To investigate the morphological damages on the coastal dune system induced by the different hydrodynamical and morphodynamical processes, we use the X-beach morphodynamical model (Unesco-IHE, Delft University and Deltares, Roelvink et al, 2009). X-beach solves short wave energy, flow and long wave propagation, sediment transport and bed update. This model is applied on a French site (<b>Atlantic</b> coast) where <b>dune</b> breaching has been observed during the Xynthia storm event (2010). After a comparison with observations for this event, a sensitivity study of the coastal dune behavior is done regarding: the hydraulic forcing, the sediment transport parametrisation ((resistance to erosion (McCall et al, 2010), dry and underwater bed slope for avalanching, [...] .), the contribution of longshore processes and wave-current interactions. This leads to a qualitative and quantitative estimation of the different possible answers from the coastal shore tackled in that study to storm events. Finally some thresholds linked to the morphological answers of the studied dune system, such as sediment transport, dune retreat or breach initiation, are proposed. These thresholds are compared to the criteria defined by Donnelly (2006) to predict cross-shore profile response to overwash event...|$|R
