5|$|According to Prime Minister Einar Gerhardsen, it took long {{to persuade}} Meisdalshagen to even take the post as Minister of Finance, {{and he was}} more {{interested}} in agro-economical questions than traditional planning of the economy. It was even said that Gerhardsen's Cabinet had an interest in luring Meisdalshagen away from the Parliament, where he had driven through significant increases in farmer's income, threatening the overall balance and planning of the state finances. In fact the income from farming, measured in the amount of money earned per decare, was doubled between the war's end in 1945 and 1950, when the Main Agreement for Agriculture, , was introduced. It regulated future price negotiations, and institutionalized the negotiating partners: the state {{on one side of the}} table, the Norwegian <b>Agrarian</b> <b>Association</b> and the Norwegian Farmers and Smallholders Union on the other.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} {{the evolution of}} the modern <b>agrarian</b> <b>associations</b> and cooperatives in Romania. Right now, our country is far behind the west-european countries regarding the development of the associative sector in the agricultural domain, from the diversity point of view and also from the presence on the market. One of the biggest problems of the small farmers from Romania represents selling the production, the traditional markets are being suffocated many times by agents. The agrarian sector is confrunting with problems marked mainly by the poor organization of the farmers regarding the production marketing and a slow structuring of their commercial behavior. The biggest problem of the agrarian cooperatives in Romania is the access to funding. This is due to the business related problems and their specific legal form. In Romania a law for crediting cooperatives doesn't exist, they are not found in the bank nomenclature and they are treated like any LLC. Also, there is an accute need for founding a high level training program intended for the <b>agrarian</b> cooperatives and <b>associations</b> leaders. The purpose is to present a current state synthesis {{in order to have a}} real image of their situation. The main object of this study is to make an assessment of the agrarian cooperatives's situation in Romania with the purpose of offering solutions and recommendations, by setting the development directions in order to become compatible with the European systems of agrarian cooperatives...|$|R

40|$|Many German farmers do {{no longer}} accept the annual {{premiums}} {{for the state}} accident insurance, which sometimes reach a considerable degree. The farmers are {{of the opinion that}} the specific accident risk of each farm has to be taken into account. So far, the <b>agrarian</b> professional <b>associations</b> as representatives of the state accident insurance, predominantly measure the premium standards by acre/ hectare which no longer fulfils the equivalence principle. The merger of some <b>agrarian</b> professional <b>associations,</b> which take place at present or are planned in the near future, should be regarded as an opportunity to institutionalize new and more appropriate premium standards. They have to be adapted anyway, as a merger usually means the standardization of two or more different premium standards. Inevitably there will be redistributions of the premium burden. The present time is ideal to use simultaneously a premium standard that is viable in the future. This essay analyses the predominantly used premium standards and suggests appropriate methods to measure future standards. professional associations in agriculture, premium standards, accident risk, equivalence principle, Farm Management, Labor and Human Capital,...|$|R

50|$|As {{part of its}} agrarian reform, the {{government}} placed heavy emphasis on organizing farmers into collectives for agricultural development. Several organizational forms were available, {{the two most important}} being asentamientos (settlements) and juntas agrarias de producción (<b>agrarian</b> production <b>associations).</b> The distinctions between the two were minor and became even more blurred with time. Both encouraged pooling of land and cooperative activity. In some instances land was worked collectively. Other organizational forms included marketing cooperatives, state farms, and specialized producers' cooperatives for milk, chickens, or pigs.

40|$|Este artigo analisa o papel desempenhado pelos proprietários rurais no associativismo agrário da Catalunha (Espanha) entre 1850 e 1936. Até ao século xix, este grupo social ocupara uma posição preeminente, mas, à medida que o processo de industrialização avançava, o seu estatuto económico e social sofreu um retrocesso, deteriorando-se ainda mais depois da crise agrária do final do século. Como reacção, em finais do século xix este grupo protagonizou uma intensa mobilização social e promoveu um novo associativismo agrário de carácter corporativo, ligado ao desenvolvimento do cooperativismo. Mas a existência destas associações interclassistas não conseguiria evitar a conflitualidade crescente e nos anos 30 a classe proprietária reorientou a sua acção colectiva para a defesa patronal.

40|$|É recorrente, na história brasileira, a atuação da burguesia agrária para limitar os alcances, as possibilidades e a viabilidade da refonna agrária no país. Nesses embates, suas associações de classe apresentam importantes funções. No presente trabalho, estudamos o discurso e a atuação de uma delas, em relação à reforma agrária, entre 1995 e 2001. Trata-se da Confederação da Agricultura e Pecuária do Brasil (CNA), a organização patronal rural que reúne o maior número e diversidade de filiados, sendo a única com caráter sindical em âmbito nacional. O objetivo deste estudo é demonstrar a influência da CNA sobre os rumos da reforma agrária no país, realizando uma análise comparativa do papel desempenhado por diferentes associações nacionais da burguesia agrária CMNP,OCB, SRB e UDR).

40|$|Broadly applied {{traditional}} {{frameworks for}} assessing efficiency of economic organizations in agriculture are (only) {{based on the}} “technical efficiency” of the factors of production and the “productivity of employed resources”. They compare the levels of efficiency of farms of different types, sectors, and countries without {{taking into account the}} transaction costs and the specific economic, institutional and natural environment of their development. At the same time, other <b>agrarian</b> organizations (contracts, <b>associations,</b> markets, public and hybrid forms) are not considered as alternative economic structures and are either ignored or studies separately. This paper suggests a new approach for assessing efficiency of economic organizations and public intervention in agriculture incorporating achievements of the interdisciplinary New Institutional Economics. Presented new approach includes: studying out the farm and agrarian organizations as a governing rather than a production structure; assessment of the comparative efficiency of alternative market, contract, internal, and hybrid modes of governance on the base of their potential to minimise production and transaction costs and to maximise the production and transaction benefits; analysis of the level of transaction costs and their institutional (distribution of rights and obligations, and the systems of their enforcements), behavioural (preferences, bounded rationality and opportunism of individuals), dimensional (uncertainty, frequency, assets specificity and appropriability of activity/transactions), technological (non-separability, economies of scale and scope) and natural factors; and determination of adequate criteria of farm efficiency and its effective boundaries – the potential to increase productivity of resources with minimum transaction costs comparing to a practically possible alternative organisation. The new approach is also used to precise the needs for public interventions (“the economic role of government”) in agrarian sector and to assess the comparative efficiency of alternative forms of public involvement. The analysis of socio-economic and natural environment and the transaction costs identifies a multiple cases of “market and private failures” associated with non-identified or badly assigned property rights, ineffective system of enforcement of absolute and contracted rights, high uncertainty and dependency of activity, low appropriability, needs for collective actions etc. which necessitate a third-party public intervention in market and private sectors. The individual forms of public involvement (institutional modernisation, assistance, regulation, taxation, hybrid or internal organisation) are with unequal efficiency in the specific environment of different countries, regions, and sectors, and the most efficient one(s) is/are to be selected with taking into account the total (direct, private, public, transaction, third-party etc.) costs and the contribution to the sustainable development. Nevertheless, “the public failure” is feasible and bad interventions, delayed, under or over-regulations, miss-management, corruption etc. are widespread and as a result the sustainable development of the sector is compromised. ...|$|R
