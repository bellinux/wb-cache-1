40|$|AbstractThis study investigates {{changes in}} <b>audit</b> {{strategy}} in China following {{the introduction of}} risk-based <b>auditing</b> standards rather than an internal control-based <b>audit</b> mode. Specifically, we examine whether auditors are implementing the risk-based <b>audit</b> mode to evaluate corporate governance before distributing <b>audit</b> resources. The results show that under the internal control-based <b>audit</b> mode, the relationship between <b>audit</b> effort and corporate governance was weak. However, implementation of the risk-based mode required by the new <b>auditing</b> standards has significantly enhanced the relationship between <b>audit</b> effort and corporate governance. Since the change in <b>audit</b> mode, the Big Ten have demonstrated a significantly better grasp of governance risk and allocated their <b>audit</b> effort accordingly, relative to smaller firms. The empirical evidence indicates that auditors have adjusted their <b>audit</b> strategy to meet the regulations, risk-based <b>auditing</b> is being achieved to a degree, reasonable and effective corporate governance helps to optimize <b>audit</b> resource allocation, and smaller <b>auditing</b> firms in particular should urgently strengthen their risk-based <b>auditing</b> capability. Overall, our findings imply that the mandatory switch to risk-based <b>auditing</b> has optimized <b>audit</b> effort in China...|$|R

Another problem with using the Pipe rolls for historical study is the fact that the chronological limits for the financial year varied from roll to roll.

However, the Pipe rolls often record payments made past Michaelmas, often up until the date the roll was actually compiled.

5|$|Hyperbaric oxygen is {{also used}} in the {{treatment}} of carbon monoxide poisoning, as it may hasten dissociation of CO from carboxyhemoglobin and cytochrome oxidase {{to a greater extent than}} normal oxygen. Hyperbaric oxygen at three times atmospheric pressure reduces the half life of carbon monoxide to 23 (~80/3 minutes) minutes, compared to 80 minutes for oxygen at regular atmospheric pressure. It may also enhance oxygen transport to the tissues by plasma, partially bypassing the normal transfer through hemoglobin. However, it is controversial whether hyperbaric oxygen actually offers any extra benefits over normal high flow oxygen, in terms of increased survival or improved long-term outcomes. There have been randomized controlled trials in which the two treatment options have been compared; of the six performed, four found hyperbaric oxygen improved outcome and two found no benefit for hyperbaric oxygen. Some of these trials have been criticized for apparent flaws in their implementation. A review of all the literature on carbon monoxide poisoning treatment concluded that the role of hyperbaric oxygen is unclear and the available evidence neither confirms nor denies a medically meaningful benefit. The authors suggested a large, well designed, externally <b>audited,</b> multicentre trial to compare normal oxygen with hyperbaric oxygen.|$|E

This research tries to investigate the impact of <b>audit</b> firm <b>audit</b> rotation and <b>audit</b> tenure to the <b>audit</b> quality. The <b>audit</b> quality is measured by four earning quality (predictive value, timeliness, representational faithfulness and neutrality perspective). The sample data are the public listed companies from period before the regulation (1999 - 2001) to period after the regulation (2004 - 2008). This research finds that in the pre-regulation period, generally there is no impact of <b>audit</b> firm tenure to <b>audit</b> quality. In the after regulation period, <b>audit</b> firm tenure has convex relationship with <b>audit</b> quality from neutrality and timeliness perspectives with minimum point at 10 and 8. 3 years (decrease for 10 years and 8. 3 years and then increase). As the decrease period is quite long, we can conclude that the relationship between <b>audit</b> firm tenure and <b>audit</b> quality is negative. This research also found that generally no impact of <b>audit</b> rotation on <b>audit</b> quality, but 2 from 8 regression found that <b>audit</b> rotation decrease the <b>audit</b> quality in the pre and after regulation period.
