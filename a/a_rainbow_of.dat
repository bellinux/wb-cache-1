5|$|Bismuth is a brittle metal with a white, silver-pink hue, often {{occurring}} in its native form, with an iridescent oxide tarnish showing many colors from yellow to blue. The spiral, stair-stepped structure of bismuth crystals {{is the result}} of a higher growth rate around the outside edges than on the inside edges. The variations in the thickness of the oxide layer that forms on the surface of the crystal causes different wavelengths of light to interfere upon reflection, thus displaying <b>a</b> <b>rainbow</b> <b>of</b> colors. When burned in oxygen, bismuth burns with a blue flame and its oxide forms yellow fumes. Its toxicity is much lower than that of its neighbors in the periodic table, such as lead, antimony, and polonium.|$|E

6000|$|For {{in all his}} use of {{opalescent}} {{and warm}} colour, Giotto is exactly like Turner, as, in his swift expressional power, he is like Gainsborough. All the other Italian religious painters work out their expression with toil; he only can give it with a touch. All the other great Italian colourists see only the beauty of colour, but Giotto also its brightness. And none of the others, except Tintoret, understood to the full its symbolic power; but with those--Giotto and Tintoret--there is always, not only a colour harmony, but a colour secret. It is not merely to make the picture glow, but {{to remind you that}} St. Francis preaches to a fire-worshipping king, that Giotto covers the wall with purple and scarlet;--and above, in the dispute at Assisi, the angry father is dressed in red, varying like passion; and the robe with which his protector embraces St. Francis, blue, symbolizing the peace of Heaven, Of course certain conventional colours were traditionally employed by all painters; but only Giotto and Tintoret invent a symbolism of their own for every picture. Thus in Tintoret's picture of the fall of the manna, the figure of God the Father is entirely robed in white, contrary to all received custom: in that of Moses striking the rock, it is surrounded by <b>a</b> <b>rainbow.</b> <b>Of</b> Giotto's symbolism in colour at Assisi, I have given account elsewhere.

60|$|Our society, thus purged and guarded, {{was full}} of high spirits, of laughter, and of the {{initiative}} of youth. The few elder men who joined us were still young at heart, and took the key from their companions. We returned from long stations in the fortifying air, our blood renewed by the sunshine, our spirits refreshed by {{the silence of the}} forest; the Babel of loud voices sounded good; we fell to eat and play like the natural man; and in the high inn chamber, panelled with indifferent pictures and lit by candles guttering in the night air, the talk and laughter sounded far into the night. It was a good place and a good life for any naturally- minded youth; better yet for the student of painting, and perhaps best of all for the student of letters. He, too, was saturated in this atmosphere of style; he was shut out from the disturbing currents of the world, he might forget that there existed other and more pressing interests than that of art. But, in such a place, it was hardly possible to write; he could not drug his conscience, like the painter, by the production of listless studies; he saw himself idle among many who were apparently, and some who were really, employed; and what with the impulse of increasing health and the continual provocation of romantic scenes, he became tormented with the desire to work. He enjoyed a strenuous idleness full of visions, hearty meals, long, sweltering walks, mirth among companions; and still floating like music through his brain, foresights of great works that Shakespeare might be proud to have conceived, headless epics, glorious torsos of dramas, and words that were alive with import. So in youth, like Moses from the mountain, we have sights of that House Beautiful of art which we shall never enter. They are dreams and unsubstantial; visions of style that repose upon no base of human meaning; the last heart- throbs of that excited amateur who has to die in all of us before the artist can be born. But they come to us in such <b>a</b> <b>rainbow</b> <b>of</b> glory that all subsequent achievement appears dull and earthly in comparison.

[...] 195 [...] A golden column next in rank appear'd, [...] On which a shrine of purest gold was rear'd; [...] Finished the whole, and laboured ev'ry part, [...] With patient touches of unwearied art: [...] The Mantuan there in sober triumph sate, [...] 200 [...] Composed his posture, and his looks sedate;[80] [...] On Homer still he fixed a rev'rent eye, [...] Great without pride, in modest majesty.[81] [...] In living sculpture[82] on the sides were spread [...] The Latian wars, and haughty Turnus dead; [...] 205 [...] Eliza stretched upon the fun'ral pyre, [...] Æneas bending with his aged sire: [...] Troy flamed in burning gold, and o'er the throne [...] "Arms and the man" [...] in golden ciphers shone. [...] Four swans sustain a car of silver bright,[83] [...] 210 [...] With heads advanced, and pinions stretched for flight:[84] [...] Here, like some furious prophet, Pindar rode, [...] And seem'd to labour with th' inspiring god. [...] Across the harp a careless hand he flings, [...] And boldly sinks into the sounding strings.[85] [...] 215 [...] The figured games of Greece the column grace, [...] Neptune and Jove survey the rapid race. [...] The youths hang o'er the chariots as they run; [...] The fiery steeds seem starting from the stone; [...] The champions in distorted postures threat,[86] [...] 220 [...] And all appeared irregularly great. [...] Here happy Horace tuned th' Ausonian lyre [...] To sweeter sounds, and tempered Pindar's fire: [...] Pleased with Aleæus' manly rage t'infuse [...] The softer spirit of the Sapphic muse.[87] [...] 225 [...] The polished pillar diff'rent sculptures grace; [...] A work outlasting monumental brass. [...] Here smiling loves and bacchanals appear, [...] The Julian star,[88] and great Augustus here. [...] The doves that round the infant poet spread [...] 230 [...] Myrtles and bays, hung hov'ring o'er his head. [...] Here in a shrine that cast a dazzling light, [...] Sat fixed in thought the mighty Stagirite; [...] His sacred head a radiant zodiac crowned,[89] [...] And various animals his sides surround;[90] [...] 235 [...] His piercing eyes, erect, appear to view [...] Superior worlds,[91] and look all nature through. [...] With equal rays immortal Tully shone, [...] The Roman rostra decked the consul's throne: [...] Gath'ring his flowing robe, he seemed to stand [...] 240 [...] In act to speak, and graceful stretched his hand.[92] [...] Behind, Rome's genius waits with civic crowns, [...] And the great father of his country owns. [...] These massy columns in a circle rise, [...] O'er which a pompous dome invades the skies:[93] [...] 245 [...] Scarce to the top I stretched my aching sight, [...] So large it spread, and swelled to such a height. [...] Full in the midst proud Fame's imperial seat[94] [...] With jewels blazed, magnificently great; [...] The vivid em'ralds there revive the eye, [...] 250 [...] The flaming rubies show their sanguine dye, [...] Bright azure rays from lively sapphires stream, [...] And lucid amber casts a golden gleam. [...] With various-coloured light the pavement shone, [...] And all on fire appeared the glowing throne; [...] 255 [...] The dome's high arch reflects the mingled blaze, [...] And forms <b>a</b> <b>rainbow</b> <b>of</b> alternate rays. [...] When on the goddess first I cast my sight, [...] Scarce seemed her stature of a cubit's height;[95] [...] But swelled to larger size, the more I gazed, [...] 260 [...] Till to the roof her tow'ring front she raised. [...] With her, the temple ev'ry moment grew, [...] And ampler vistas opened to my view: [...] Upward the columns shoot, the roofs ascend, [...] And arches widen, and long aisles extend.[96] [...] 265 [...] Such was her form, as ancient bards have told, [...] Wings raise her arms, and wings her feet infold; [...] A thousand busy tongues the goddess bears, [...] And thousand open eyes, and thousand list'ning ears.[97] [...] Beneath, in order ranged, the tuneful Nine [...] 270 [...] (Her virgin handmaids) still attend the shrine.[98] [...] With eyes on Fame for ever fixed, they sing; [...] For Fame they raise the voice, and tune the string; [...] With time's first birth began the heav'nly lays, [...] And last, eternal, through the length of days. [...] 275 [...] Around these wonders as I cast a look, [...] The trumpet sounded, and the temple shook, [...] And all the nations, summoned at the call, [...] From diff'rent quarters fill the crowded hall: [...] Of various tongues the mingled sounds were heard; [...] 280 [...] In various garbs promiscuous throngs appeared;[99] [...] Thick as the bees that with the spring renew [...] Their flow'ry toils, and sip the fragrant dew, [...] When the winged colonies first tempt the sky, [...] O'er dusky fields and shaded waters fly, [...] 285 [...] Or settling, seize the sweets the blossoms yield, [...] And a low murmur runs along the field.[100] [...] Millions of suppliant crowds the shrine attend, [...] And all degrees before the goddess bend;[101] [...] The poor, the rich, the valiant, and the sage, [...] 290 [...] And boasting youth, and narrative old age.[102] [...] Their pleas were diff'rent, their request the same: [...] For good and bad alike are fond of fame. [...] Some she disgraced, and some with honours crowned;[103] [...] Unlike successes equal merits found.[104] [...] 295 [...] Thus her blind sister, fickle Fortune, reigns, [...] And, undiscerning, scatters crowns and chains. [...] First at the shrine the learned world appear, [...] And to the goddess thus prefer their prayer. [...] Long have we sought t' instruct and please mankind, [...] 300 [...] With studies pale, with midnight vigils blind; [...] But thanked by few, rewarded yet by none, [...] We here appeal to thy superior throne: [...] On wit and learning the just prize bestow, [...] For fame is all we must expect below. [...] 305 [...] The goddess heard, and bade the muses raise [...] The golden trumpet of eternal praise:[105] [...] From pole to pole the winds diffuse the sound, [...] That fills the circuit of the world around; [...] Not all at once, as thunder breaks the cloud; [...] 310 [...] The notes at first were rather sweet than loud: [...] By just degrees they ev'ry moment rise, [...] Fill the wide earth, and gain upon the skies, [...] At ev'ry breath were balmy odours shed, [...] Which still grew sweeter as they wider spread;[106] [...] 315 [...] Less fragrant scents th' unfolding rose exhales, [...] Or spices breathing in Arabian gales. [...] Next these the good and just, an awful train, [...] Thus on their knees address the sacred fane. [...] Since living virtue is with envy cursed, [...] 320 [...] And the best men are treated like the worst, [...] Do thou, just goddess, call our merits forth, [...] And give each deed th' exact intrinsic worth.[107] [...] Not with bare justice shall your act be crowned, [...] (Said Fame,) but high above desert renowned:[108] [...] 325 [...] Let fuller notes th' applauding world amaze, [...] And the loud clarion labour in your praise. [...] This band dismissed, behold another crowd [...] Preferred the same request, and lowly bowed; [...] The constant tenour of whose well spent days [...] 330 [...] No less deserved a just return of praise. [...] But straight the direful trump of slander sounds; [...] Through the big dome the doubling thunder bounds; [...] Loud as the burst of cannon rends the skies, [...] The dire report through ev'ry region flies, [...] 335 [...] In ev'ry ear incessant rumours rung, [...] And gath'ring scandals grew on ev'ry tongue. [...] From the black trumpet's rusty concave broke [...] Sulphureous flames, and clouds of rolling smoke:[109] [...] The pois'nous vapour blots the purple skies, [...] 340 [...] And withers all before it as it flies. [...] A troop came next, who crowns and armour wore, [...] And proud defiance in their looks they bore: [...] For thee, (they cried,) amidst alarms and strife, [...] We sailed in tempests down the stream of life; [...] 345 [...] For thee whole nations filled with flames and blood, [...] And swam to empire through the purple flood. [...] Those ills we dared, thy inspiration own, [...] What virtue seemed, was done for thee alone. [...] Ambitious fools! (the queen replied, and frowned) [...] 350 [...] Be all your acts in dark oblivion drowned; [...] There sleep forgot, with mighty tyrants gone, [...] Your statues mouldered, and your names unknown![110] [...] A sudden cloud straight snatched them from my sight, [...] And each majestic phantom sunk in night. [...] 355 [...] Then came the smallest tribe I yet had seen; [...] Plain was their dress, and modest was their mien. [...] Great idol of mankind! we neither claim [...] The praise of merit, nor aspire to fame! [...] But safe in deserts from th' applause of men, [...] 360 [...] Would die unheard of, as we lived unseen; [...] 'Tis all we beg thee, to conceal from sight [...] Those acts of goodness, which themselves requite. [...] O let us still the secret joy partake, [...] To follow virtue ev'n for virtue's sake.[111] [...] 365 [...] And live there men, who slight immortal fame? [...] Who then with incense shall adore our name? [...] But, mortals! know, 'tis still our greatest pride [...] To blaze those virtues, which the good would hide. [...] Rise! muses, rise! add all your tuneful breath, [...] 370 [...] These must not sleep in darkness and in death. [...] She said: in air the trembling music floats, [...] And on the winds triumphant swell the notes:[112] [...] So soft, though high, so loud, and yet so clear,[113] [...] Ev'n list'ning angels leaned from heav'n to hear: [...] 375 [...] To farthest shores th' ambrosial spirit flies, [...] Sweet to the world, and grateful to the skies. [...] Next these, a youthful train their vows expressed,[114] [...] With feathers crowned, with gay embroid'ry dress'd, [...] Hither, they cried, direct your eyes, and see [...] 380 [...] The men of pleasure, dress, and gallantry; [...] Ours is the place at banquets, balls, and plays, [...] Sprightly our nights, polite are all our days; [...] Courts we frequent, where 'tis our pleasing care [...] To pay due visits, and address the fair: [...] 385 [...] In fact, 'tis true, no nymph we could persuade, [...] But still in fancy vanquished ev'ry maid; [...] Of unknown duchesses lewd tales we tell, [...] Yet, would the world believe us, all were well. [...] The joy let others have, and we the name, [...] 390 [...] And what we want in pleasure, grant in fame.[115] [...] The queen assents, the trumpet rends the skies, [...] And at each blast a lady's honour dies.[116] [...] Pleased with the strange success, vast numbers pressed [...] Around the shrine, and made the same request: [...] 395 [...] What! you (she cried) unlearn'd in arts to please, [...] Slaves to yourselves, and ev'n fatigued with ease,[117] [...] Who lose a length of undeserving days, [...] Would you usurp the lover's dear-bought praise? [...] To just contempt, ye vain pretenders, fall, [...] 400 [...] The people's fable, and the scorn of all. [...] Straight the black clarion sends a horrid sound, [...] Loud laughs burst out, and bitter scoffs fly round, [...] Whispers are heard, with taunts reviling loud, [...] And scornful hisses run through all the crowd. [...] 405 [...] Last, those who boast of mighty mischiefs done, [...] Enslave their country, or usurp a throne;[118] [...] Or who their glory's dire foundation laid [...] On sov'reigns ruined, or on friends betrayed;[119] [...] Calm, thinking villains, whom no faith could fix, [...] 410 [...] Of crooked counsels and dark politics; [...] Of these a gloomy tribe surround the throne, [...] And beg to make th' immortal treasons known. [...] The trumpet roars, long flaky flames expire, [...] With sparks, that seemed to set the world on fire. [...] 415 [...] At the dread sound, pale mortals stood aghast, [...] And startled nature trembled with the blast. [...] This having heard and seen, some pow'r unknown [...] Straight changed the scene, and snatched me from the throne.[120] [...] Before my view appeared a structure fair, [...] 420 [...] Its site uncertain, if in earth or air; [...] With rapid motion turned the mansion round; [...] With ceaseless noise the ringing walls resound; [...] Not less in number were the spacious doors, [...] Than leaves on trees, or sands upon the shores; [...] 425 [...] Which still unfolded stand, by night, by day, [...] Pervious to winds, and open ev'ry way. [...] As flames by nature to the skies ascend,[121] [...] As weighty bodies to the centre tend, [...] As to the sea returning rivers roll, [...] 430 [...] And the touched needle trembles to the pole; [...] Hither, as to their proper place, arise [...] All various sounds from earth, and seas, and skies, [...] Or spoke aloud, or whispered in the ear; [...] Nor ever silence, rest, or peace is here. [...] 435 [...] As on the smooth expanse of crystal lakes [...] The sinking stone at first a circle makes; [...] The trembling surface, by the motion stirred, [...] Spreads in a second circle, then a third; [...] Wide, and more wide, the floating rings advance, [...] 440 [...] Fill all the wat'ry plain, and to the margin dance: [...] Thus ev'ry voice and sound, when first they break, [...] On neighb'ring air a soft impression make; [...] Another ambient circle then they move; [...] That, in its turn, impels the next above;[122] [...] 445 [...] Through undulating[123] air the sounds are sent, [...] And spread o'er all the fluid element. [...] There, various news I heard of love and strife, [...] Of peace and war, health, sickness, death, and life, [...] Of loss and gain, of famine, and of store, [...] 450 [...] Of storms at sea, and travels on the shore, [...] Of prodigies, and portents seen in air, [...] Of fires and plagues, and stars with blazing hair, [...] Of turns of fortune, changes in the state, [...] The falls of fav'rites, projects of the great, [...] 455 [...] Of old mismanagements, taxations new:[124] [...] All neither wholly false, nor wholly true. [...] Above, below, without, within, around, [...] Confused, unnumbered, multitudes are found, [...] Who pass, repass, advance, and glide away; [...] 460 [...] Hosts raised by fear, and phantoms of a day: [...] Astrologers, that future fates foreshew, [...] Projectors, quacks, and lawyers not a few; [...] And priests, and party-zealots, num'rous bands [...] With home-born lies, or tales from foreign lands; [...] 465 [...] Each talked aloud, or in some secret place, [...] And wild impatience stared in ev'ry face.[125] [...] The flying rumours gathered as they rolled, [...] Scarce any tale was sooner heard than told; [...] And all who told it added something new, [...] } [...] 470 [...] And all who heard it, made enlargements too; [...] } [...] In ev'ry ear it spread, on ev'ry tongue it grew. } [...] Thus flying east and west, and north and south, [...] News travelled with increase from mouth to mouth. [...] So from a spark, that kindled first by chance, [...] 475 [...] With gath'ring force the quick'ning flames advance;[126] [...] Till to the clouds their curling heads aspire, [...] And tow'rs and temples sink in floods of fire. [...] When thus ripe lies are to perfection sprung, [...] Full grown, and fit to grace a mortal tongue, [...] 480 [...] Through thousand vents, impatient, forth they flow, [...] And rush in millions on the world below. [...] Fame sits aloft,[127] and points them out their course, [...] Their date determines, and prescribes their force; [...] Some to remain, and some to perish soon; [...] 485 [...] Or wane and wax, alternate, like the moon. [...] Around, a thousand winged wonders fly, [...] Borne by the trumpet's blast, and scattered through the sky. [...] There, at one passage, oft you might survey, [...] A lie and truth contending for the way; [...] 490 [...] And long 'twas doubtful, both so closely pent, [...] Which first should issue through the narrow vent: [...] At last agreed, together out they fly, [...] Inseparable now, the truth and lie;[128] [...] The strict companions are for ever joined, [...] 495 [...] And this or that unmixed, no mortal e'er shall find. [...] While thus I stood, intent to see and hear, [...] One came, methought, and whisper'd in my ear:[129] [...] What could thus high thy rash ambition raise? [...] Art thou, fond youth, a candidate for praise? [...] 500 [...] 'Tis true, said I, not void of hopes I came, [...] For who so fond as youthful bards of fame? [...] But few, alas! the casual blessing boast, [...] So hard to gain, so easy to be lost.[130] [...] How vain that second life in others' breath, [...] 505 [...] Th' estate which wits inherit after death![131] [...] Ease, health, and life, for this they must resign; [...] Unsure the tenure, but how vast the fine! [...] The great man's curse, without the gains, endure, [...] Be envied, wretched, and be flattered, poor; [...] 510 [...] All luckless wits their enemies professed, [...] And all successful, jealous friends at best. [...] Nor fame I slight, nor for her favours call; [...] She comes unlooked for, if she comes at all. [...] But if the purchase cost so dear a price, [...] 515 [...] As soothing folly, or exalting vice; [...] Oh! if the muse must flatter lawless sway, [...] And follow still where fortune leads the way;[132] [...] Or if no basis bear my rising name, [...] But the fall'n ruins of another's fame; [...] 520 [...] Then teach me, heav'n! to scorn the guilty bays; [...] Drive from my breast that wretched lust of praise; [...] Unblemished let me live, or die unknown; [...] Oh! grant an honest fame, or grant me none! ...|$|E
