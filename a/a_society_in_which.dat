25|$|Unlike similar formulations, {{as in the}} Labour Party’s {{original}} {{wording of}} Clause IV, it deliberately excludes the means of exchange. This highlights a central characteristic of the party as remaining advocates of socialism as <b>a</b> <b>society</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> the need for money is eliminated. As such it rejects that the economic calculation problem is a barrier to such a society.|$|E

Although the planet appears desolate at first, the surviving crew members stumble upon <b>a</b> <b>society</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> apes have evolved into creatures with human-like intelligence and speech. The apes have assumed the role of the dominant species and humans are mute creatures wearing animal skins.|$|E
25|$|Gopal Baba Walangkar (ca. 1840-1900) is {{generally}} considered to be the pioneer of the Dalit movement, seeking <b>a</b> <b>society</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> they were not discriminated. This is despite the work of Harichand Thakur (ca. 1812-1878) with his Matua organisation that involved the Namasudra (Chandala) community in Bengal Presidency, British India. Ambedkar himself believed Walangkar to be the progenitor. Another early social reformer who worked to improve conditions for Dalits was Jyotirao Phule (1827-1890).|$|E

25|$|The Puritans {{had created}} <b>a</b> <b>society</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> Congregationalism {{was the state}} church, its ministers were {{supported}} by tax payers, and only full church members could vote in elections. To ensure that the colony had a supply of educated ministers, Harvard University was founded in 1636. By 1640, 18 churches had been gathered in Massachusetts. In addition, Puritans established the Connecticut Colony in 1636 and New Haven Colony in 1637. Eventually, there were 33 Congregational churches in New England.|$|E
25|$|His {{care in the}} {{institution}} of a pagan hierarchy in opposition {{to that of the}} Christians was due to his wish to create <b>a</b> <b>society</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> every aspect {{of the life of the}} citizens was to be connected, through layers of intermediate levels, to the consolidated figure of the Emperor— the final provider for all the needs of his people. Within this project, there was no place for a parallel institution, such as the Christian hierarchy or Christian charity.|$|E
25|$|Feminist {{science fiction}} {{is focused on}} {{theories}} that include {{but are not limited}} to gender inequality, sexuality, race, economics, and reproduction. Feminist SF is political because of its tendency to critique the dominant culture. Some of the most notable feminist science fiction works have illustrated these themes using utopias to explore <b>a</b> <b>society</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> gender differences or gender power imbalances do not exist, or dystopias to explore worlds in which gender inequalities are intensified, thus asserting a need for feminist work to continue.|$|E

25|$|At {{the end of}} the Japanese occupation, the Government of Hong Kong held a {{monopoly}} on the purchase and distribution of food and raw materials including rice and cotton yarn. Price controls by the Government were not eliminated until 1953. The period can best be summarised by low resources and an endless increase in population. Many mainlanders would cross the border to Hong Kong and establish illegal huts on rooftops and edge of mountains. The integration of different groups from China and original tenants of Hong Kong would also create <b>a</b> <b>society</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> everyone had to wrestle with the overwhelming number of language dialects.|$|E

25|$|But it is {{possible}} that the politicians of the 1850s were not inept. More recent studies have kept elements of the revisionist interpretation alive, emphasizing the role of political agitation (the efforts of Democratic politicians of the South and Republican politicians in the North to keep the sectional conflict at the center of the political debate). David Herbert Donald (1920–2009), a student of Randall, argued in 1960 that the politicians of the 1850s were not unusually inept but that they were operating in <b>a</b> <b>society</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> traditional restraints were being eroded in the face of the rapid extension of democracy. The stability of the two-party system kept the union together, but would collapse in the 1850s, thus reinforcing, rather than suppressing, sectional conflict. The union, Donald said, died of democracy.|$|E

25|$|The {{politicians}} of the 1850s were acting in <b>a</b> <b>society</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> the traditional restraints that suppressed sectional {{conflict in the}} 1820s and 1850s– {{the most important of}} which being the stability of the two-party system– were being eroded as this rapid extension of democracy went forward in the North and South. It was an era when the mass political party galvanized voter participation to 80% or 90% turnout rates, and a time in which politics formed an essential component of American mass culture. Historians agree that political involvement was a larger concern to the average American in the 1850s than today. Politics was, in one of its functions, a form of mass entertainment, a spectacle with rallies, parades, and colorful personalities. Leading politicians, moreover, often served as a focus for popular interests, aspirations, and values.|$|E
25|$|The National Democratic Revolution (NDR) is {{described}} as a process through which the National Democratic Society (NDS) is achieved; <b>a</b> <b>society</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> people are intellectually, socially, economically and politically empowered. The drivers of the NDR are also called the motive forces and are defined as the elements within society that gain from the success of the NDR. Using contour plots or concentric circles the centre represents the elements in society that gain the most out {{of the success of the}} NDR. Moving away from the centre results in the reduction of the gains that those elements derive. It is generally believed that the force that occupies the centre of those concentric circles in countries with low unemployment is the working class while in countries with higher levels of unemployment it is the unemployed. Some of the many theoreticians that have written about the NDR include Joe Slovo, Joel Netshitenzhe and Tshilidzi Marwala.|$|E
25|$|Oath-helping {{involved}} the party undergoing proof swearing {{to the truth}} of his claim or denial and having that oath reinforced by five or more others, chosen either by the party or by the court. The numbers of helpers required and the form of their oath differed from place to place and upon the nature of the dispute. If either the party or any of the helpers failed in the oath, either refusing to take it or sometimes even making an error in the required formula, the proof failed and the case was adjudged to the other side. It appears surprising to moderns that so important a matter might be settled by one and his friends falsely swearing an oath. In <b>a</b> <b>society</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> each was known to his neighbour and in which religious emphasis was placed upon the sanctity of an oath, the system was probably more satisfactory. As 'wager of law' it remained a way of determining cases in the common law until its abolition in the 19th century.|$|E

25|$|Republic. This {{regime is}} {{ruled by a}} philosopher king, and thus is {{grounded}} on wisdom and reason. The aristocratic state, and the man whose nature corresponds to it, are the objects of Plato's analyses {{throughout much of the}} Republic, as opposed to the other four types of states/men, who are discussed later in his work. In Book VIII, Plato states in order the other four imperfect societies with a description of the state's structure and individual character. In timocracy the ruling class is made up primarily of those with a warrior-like character. In his description, Plato has Sparta in mind. Oligarchy is made up of <b>a</b> <b>society</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> wealth is the criterion of merit and the wealthy are in control. In democracy, the state bears resemblance to ancient Athens with traits such as equality of political opportunity and freedom for the individual to do as he likes. Democracy then degenerates into tyranny from the conflict of rich and poor. It is characterized by an undisciplined society existing in chaos, where the tyrant rises as popular champion leading to the formation of his private army and the growth of oppression.|$|E
25|$|The Gender Equality Bureau {{defines a}} work-life balance as <b>a</b> <b>society</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> an {{individual}} is not limited by his/her gender in choosing a fulfilling occupation that will accommodate each stage of an individual's life. Japanese workers on average have a minimum of ten work days for vacation time per year and are given zero paid public holidays, numbers that are far below any other industrialized nation except the United States. In {{order to ensure that}} Japanese workers are free to lead a healthy and affluent life in a style of their choosing while also maintaining their economic independence, the Gender Equality Bureau in 2007 recommended a variety of policies for both the public and private sector in order to increase time-off for employees. The Bureau has pushed private employers to offer flexible hours that can cater to a variety of lifestyles, such as offering child-care leave for men in order to promote the male's role in child-rearing. Government, per the Bureau's recommendation, is tasked with providing a policy structure that meets both male and female needs, hiring only companies that practice work-life balance for public contracts, and passing legislation that signifies the importance of both genders taking an active role in domestic work.|$|E
