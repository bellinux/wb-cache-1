500|$|These details {{form the}} context for Clement's {{appearance}} in Scotland and his selection as the new Bishop of Dunblane. Three {{years had passed since}} the death of the last bishop, Osbert. Since there was no electoral college for the diocese, Pope Gregory IX charged the bishops of St Andrews, Brechin and Dunkeld, to find and nominate a suitable replacement. There can only be informed speculation regarding the choice of Clement. Importantly, perhaps, King Alexander was later noted for [...] "his concern for building churches for the Friars Preacher [...] ". The status of the Dominicans <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>cutting</b> <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> religious reform, together with Clement's background, may have been the decisive factors. At any rate, Clement was consecrated as bishop at Wedale on 4 September 1233, by William de Malveisin, Bishop of St Andrews. His consecration meant that he was the first Dominican in the British Isles to obtain a bishopric. This has prompted the historian Archie Duncan to comment that [...] "the choice of the first friar-bishop ... can only be called daring".|$|E
40|$|It is well {{established}} that laser cutting or mechanical cutting of nonoriented electrical steel causes structural changes <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>cutting</b> <b>edge,</b> which finally affect the magnetic properties. During mechanical cutting, plastic deformation appears in the zone near <b>the</b> <b>cutting</b> <b>edge.</b> On <b>the</b> contrary, laser <b>cutting</b> induces thermal stress due to temperature gradients within the material during processing, which finally also results in deterioration of the magnetic properties. The knowledge {{of the type of}} the deterioration mechanism and the degree of the deterioration of magnetic property deterioration mechanisms is important for designing electrical machines in terms of magnetic field and loss calculations. In this paper, <b>the</b> effect of <b>cutting</b> on <b>the</b> magnetic flux distribution for mechanical cutting as well as solid state laser cutting is calculated and analyzed space-resolved using the data obtained from investigations by neutron grating interferometry. In addition, the resulting changes of magnetization behavior, i. e., the character of the B versus H curve, were studied. It will be demonstrated that the deterioration of the magnetic properties depends on the geometry of <b>the</b> parts <b>at</b> <b>cutting.</b> It is shown that the nature of the resulting spatial distribution of the magnetic flux is different for mechanical cutting and cutting by laser. By mechanical cutting, a drop of the magnetic flux in <b>the</b> region <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>cutting</b> <b>edge</b> appears. Through <b>cutting</b> by laser, <b>the</b> observed decrease of the magnetic flux B is observed over the total width of the strip. The decrease of B at cutting of small parts by laser is remarkably different <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>cutting</b> <b>edges,</b> which are opposite to each other. Finally, the observed magnetic behavior is correlated to the different character of the induced residual stresses by mechanical cutting and cutting by laser...|$|R

2500|$|Evaluated today, Stone's {{architecture}} {{combines the}} sophisticated classicism of Jones with an uncouth artisan Mannerism popular at the time.

2500|$|After Stokowski's death, Tom Burnam writes, the [...] "concatenization of canards" [...] {{that had}} arisen around him was revived {{that his name}} and accent were phony; that his musical {{education}} was deficient; that his musicians did not respect him; that he cared about nobody but himself. Burnam suggests {{that there was a}} dark, hidden reason for these rumours. Stokowski deplored the segregation of symphony orchestras in which women and minorities were excluded, and, so Burnam claims, his detractors got revenge by slandering Stokowski. Nevertheless, and notwithstanding the claims made by Tom Burnam, attitudes towards Stokowski have changed dramatically over the years since his death. In 1999, for Gramophone magazine, the noted music commentator David Mellor wrote: [...] "One of the great joys of recent years for me has been the reassessment of Leopold Stokowski. When I was growing up there was a tendency to disparage the old man as a charlatan. Today it is all very different. Stokowski is now recognised as the father of modern orchestral standards. He possessed a truly magical gift of extracting a burnished sound from both great and second-rank ensembles. He also loved the process of recording and his gramophone career was a constant quest for better recorded sound. But the greatest pleasure of all for me is his acceptance now as an outstanding conductor of nineteenth- and twentieth-century music, including a lot that was <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>cutting</b> <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> contemporary achievement." ...|$|E

40|$|A new, {{rational}} {{model is}} proposed for simulating {{the process of}} core drilling in geomaterials. The model describes in a consistent manner the complicated process of core drilling in quasi-brittle materials. After reviewing a model from the literature, based only on the balance of forces <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>cutting</b> <b>edge,</b> a new approach is introduced, considering a fundamental kinematical constraint to the rotary drilling process, namely, the helicoidal trajectories of <b>the</b> cutters. <b>At</b> <b>the</b> same time, the mechanical balance of engine power supply and drilling energy consumption must hold. The concept of drilling strength, i. e., the energy consumed to remove the unit volume of base material, is discussed, showing that {{the expression of the}} drilling strength depends on the fracture mechanisms occurring in the base material, and thus depends also on the shape of the indenters (back rake angle, wear-flat). A simple estimate of <b>the</b> wear effects <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>cutting</b> <b>edges,</b> based on experiments, is proposed. In conclusion, a global formulation of the core drilling process is obtained by coupling the kinematical and mechanical conditions. The model comprises a set of physical parameters, which can be determined according to drilling test...|$|R

The policy of placing cannons and other gunpowder weapons continued well into the Joseon Dynasty and by 1410, over 160 Joseon warships had cannons on board. Choe Mu-seon, a medieval Korean inventor, military commander and scientist, introduced {{the widespread use of}} gunpowder to Korea {{for the first time and}} created various gunpowder-based weapons. The weapons were created because of Japanese pirates (Wokou) frequently raiding Korea's coastal regions. Choe obtained knowledge of gunpowder from a Chinese merchant named Lee Yuan despite the fact that it was against Mongol law. Lee was at first reluctant but eventually came around because he was impressed by Choe's patriotism and determination. Choe later impressed the Koryo court and King U which then built him a laboratory and a factory geared solely toward gunpowder. He invented the first Korean cannons and other weapons such as the Singijeon (Korean fire arrows) and later the Hwacha which were first built in 1377 and are widely considered to be the first true multiple rocket launchers. These weapons were a vast improvement over the previous rocket weapons with one of the key features was that it could fire up to 200 rockets at one time.|$|E

Formation of HAZ is undesirable and excessive stress cause surface defects. Thus, {{it is necessary to}} analyze them intensively. The process of laser cutting is a complex thermo-mechanical process. Hence, in this study a thermo-mechanical finite element model has been introduced by ANSYS to predict the temporal variation together with thermal stress and width of heat affected zone (HAZ). CO 2 laser is used to cut 10 × 10 mm square blank in a 3 mm thick stainless steel- 304 sheet.
