40|$|ISSN: 1759 - 9954 International audienceUnsaturated N-heterocyclic carbenes (NHCs) such as 1, 3 -bis(di-isopropyl) imidazol- 2 -ylidene (1) and 1, 3 -bis(di-tert-butyl) imidazol- 2 -ylidene (2) {{are shown}} to {{catalyze}} the sequential group transfer polymerization (GTP) of (meth) acrylic monomers. A variety of block copolymers including not only alkyl methacrylate but also <b>alkyl</b> <b>acrylate</b> monomer units {{as well as}} blocks deriving from N,N-dimethylacrylamide and methacrylonitrile were thus obtained at room temperature, using 1 -methoxy- 2 -methyl- 1 -trimethylsiloxypropene (MTS) as initiator in THF as solvent. Block copolymerizations could be achieved, starting indifferently from the GTP of the acrylic monomer {{to that of the}} methacrylic one or vice versa, that is, regardless of the order of addition of the two monomers, in contrast to most examples of block copolymer synthesis by "controlled/living" sequential polymerization. It is postulated that these NHC-catalyzed GTPs of (meth) acrylics proceed via a single step concerted-like associative mechanism, involving the formation of thermodynamically unstable intermediates or transition states, likely hypervalent siliconates, with no detectable anionic enolates formed...|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} {{synthesise}} suitable starting {{materials for the}} synthesis of electroactive monomers, the mono-methylation of some primary amines was firstly investigated. This méthylation reaction involved a Mannich reaction of primary amine with succinimide and formaldehyde followed by the reduction using sodium borohydride in DMSO. This reaction was applied to p-dimethylaminoaniline, p-diaminobenzene, o-diaminobenzene and 1 -aminoanthraquinone. Three electroactive monomers, 2 -(p-dimethylamino-N-methylarrilino) ethyl methacrylate, 2 -(p-dimethylamino-N-methylanilino) ethyl acrylate, and 4 -(pdimethylamino- N-methylan ilino) butyl acrylate were synthesised through the tosylation of certain hydroxy <b>alkyl</b> <b>acrylates</b> followed by nucleophilic substitution with p-dimethylamino-N-methylaniline. Homopolymers of the three electroactive monomers and copolymers of the electroactive monomers with methyl acrylate and styrene, with different compositions, were synthesised through free radical polymerizations. The characterization of these polymers by NMR gave interesting stereochemical informations of the polymer chain. The electrochemical properties of these electroactive polymers were investigated both in solution and in solid state (as modified electrodes) using cyclic voltammetric experiments. According to the electrochemical behaviour of these polymers in different conditions, some good electrolyte systems (TEAP or Lithium perchlorate in propylene carbonate) and potential range (- 0. 3 to 0. 5 V vs. SCE) were suggested for the applications of these polymers...|$|R
