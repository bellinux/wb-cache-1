25|$|Australia {{declared}} on 239 for {{the loss}} of eight wickets in the second innings, riding on the backs of Greg Blewett's 88 and Adam Gilchrist's quick 43. India needed 396 to win in the last innings <b>and</b> <b>never</b> <b>looked</b> to make match of it, as they collapsed for 110 in just 39 overs. Australia won by 285 runs and Steve Waugh was Man of the Match for his 150 in the first innings.|$|E
25|$|Sunline then ventured {{north to}} Sydney {{to tackle the}} Doncaster Handicap (1,600 metres). Despite taking on older horses for the first time, and {{starting}} from a wide starting gate, Sunline was sent {{out one of the}} shortest-priced favourites in the race's long history, at 10/9 (approximately $2.10). Sunline went straight to the front <b>and</b> <b>never</b> <b>looked</b> back to score by one-and-three-quarter lengths. She became just the fourth filly to win in the modern history of the race.|$|E
25|$|The Royals came to Boston with a 10–1 {{record in}} their last 11 games. They quickly scored five runs {{in the first inning}} off Steven Wright, who went five {{additional}} scoreless innings, <b>and</b> <b>never</b> <b>looked</b> back. In game two, the Red Sox scored seven times off of Danny Duffy and handed David Price his 13th win of the season. He lowered his ERA to under 4 {{for the first time since}} opening day. In the rubber match, Eduardo Rodríguez and Matt Barnes allowed eight runs ins the sixth inning, blowing a 4–2 lead. The Royals sent 13 hitters to the plate.|$|E

25|$|Coming {{into the}} series, the White Sox {{had the best}} record and the best {{pitching}} staff in the AL. That good pitching {{showed up in the}} first game, with Quintana only giving up one run in eight innings of work, wasting another good start of Steven Wright, who gave up two runs in six innings. Boston took a five inning lead in the second game, off of a David Ortiz home run, earning the first win for Clay Buchholz. Craig Kimbrel preserved the 5–2 win with his ninth save. In game three, the Red Sox scored in each of the first three innings <b>and</b> <b>never</b> <b>looked</b> back, taking the rubber match 7–3.|$|E
25|$|After an evenly battled first quarter, the Magic {{took the}} lead thanks to field goals and assists from point guard Jameer Nelson, who was playing his first game since {{injuring}} his shoulder {{during the regular season}} in February. Down 33–28 with 8:38 left in the 2nd quarter, the Lakers went on a 10–0 run <b>and</b> <b>never</b> <b>looked</b> back. The Lakers ended the 3rd quarter on a 25–10 run, led by fierce play by Kobe Bryant, who finished with 40 points, 8 rebounds, and 8 assists, joining the likes of Shaquille O'Neal, Michael Jordan, and Jerry West to put up those numbers in a single NBA Finals game. The 25-point margin of victory was the 6th-largest in NBA Finals Game 1 history.|$|E
25|$|After the {{disappointment}} of losing to North Melbourne in the 1977 Preliminary Final, the Hawks were back {{to play in}} the 1978 Grand Final, again against North Melbourne. It was the third time in four seasons that these two sides were to meet in a grand final. North Melbourne were competing in their fifth successive grand final and were the reigning premiers. At half-time North Melbourne led by four points but Hawthorn finished victors by three goals thanks largely to a strong third quarter which saw them kick 7.6. The turning point occurred when two North players spoiled each other in the goalsquare at the 6-minute mark, when a mark and a goal could have put them 17 points up. The Hawks went on to dominate play after this incident <b>and</b> <b>never</b> <b>looked</b> back.|$|E

25|$|Hodge, in {{his third}} test, who had contributed with a two-hour 41 in the first innings, survived a dropped catch on 13 – <b>and</b> <b>never</b> <b>looked</b> back. He added an {{unbroken}} 126 with Hussey before stumps on day three, made his century off 198 balls on the fourth morning despite Hussey departing in the second over of the day, and took a further 134 balls {{to make it a}} double. Ponting then declared, and tea was taken with an Australian total of eight for 528 – which set a target of 491 for South Africa, which would have been a world record chase. With both openers out {{before the end of the}} fourth day, South Africa needed a further 406 runs to win for their last eight wickets.|$|E
25|$|The Phillies {{scored in}} the 1st inning of Game 4 on a bases-loaded walk, <b>and</b> <b>never</b> <b>looked</b> back. Pedro Feliz drove in a run in the 3rd inning {{to make it a}} 2–0 Phillies lead. In the 4th inning, Carl Crawford hit a solo home run to cut the deficit in half to just one run for the Rays, but in {{the bottom half of the}} inning, Ryan Howard knocked a 3-run home run to make it a 5–1 game. Eric Hinske hit a solo home run to make it 5–2, but Phillies pitcher Joe Blanton hit a solo home run of his own to make it 6–2. In the 8th inning for the Phillies, Jayson Werth and Ryan Howard each hit 2-run home runs, {{finishing}} off the Rays in the most one-sided game the series had seen by a score of 10–2. The Phillies now had the Rays on the ropes, needing just one more win to become World Champions.|$|E
25|$|Co-hosts New Zealand {{proved the}} {{surprise}} packet of the tournament, winning their first seven games to finish {{on top of}} the table after the round-robin. The other hosts, Australia, one of the pre-tournament favourites lost their first two matches. They recovered somewhat to win four of the remaining six, but narrowly missed out on the semi-finals. The West Indies also finished with a 4–4 record, but were just behind Australia on run-rate. South Africa made a triumphant return to international cricket with a win over Australia at the Sydney Cricket Ground in their first match. They and England had solid campaigns and easily qualified for the semis, despite upset losses to Sri Lanka and Zimbabwe respectively. India had a disappointing tournament <b>and</b> <b>never</b> <b>looked</b> likely to progress beyond the round-robin. Sri Lanka were still establishing themselves at the highest level and beat only Zimbabwe (who did not yet have Test status) and South Africa.|$|E

Michael Torres kicked three field goals.|$|R
25|$|Australia again {{started with}} a wobble, losing McCosker for 4 in the third over, but a 42 run {{partnership}} between Chappell and Ian Davis got them back on track. Davis eventually went for 18, but that brought Kim Hughes to the crease. Although scoring less prolifically, Hughes capably supported Chappell as he moved towards a well-deserved century, falling on 102. It was enough {{to prop up the}} Australian second innings, and solid contributions from Hughes (27), Doug Walters (24), Richie Robinson (26), and Max Walker (22) took Australia to 251 all out. Gloucestershire required an unlikely 343 for victory, <b>and</b> <b>never</b> <b>looked</b> like they would reach the target. Andy Stovold made 27, and Jim Foat and David Shepherd both chipped in with 26 each, but Gloucentershire were all out for 169. Len Pascoe (4/36) and Ray Bright (4/63) were the pick of the Australian bowlers, as they wrapped up a deserved victory by 173 runs in two days.|$|E
25|$|Nicklaus won {{the first}} two major championships of 1972 by three shots each in wire-to-wire fashion. He won the Masters and the U.S. Open, {{creating}} talk of a calendar-year Grand Slam. Nicklaus opened with a four-under par 68 at Augusta National <b>and</b> <b>never</b> <b>looked</b> back. He was the only player under par for the week as he and the field battled difficult scoring conditions. In the U.S. Open at Pebble Beach again under severe scoring conditions, Nicklaus struck a one-iron on the 218-yard par-three 17th hole during the final round into a stiff, gusty ocean breeze that hit the flagstick and ended up three inches from the cup. The U.S. Open was Nicklaus' 13th career major and tied him with Bobby Jones for career majors (although a different group of tournaments had been considered majors in Jones's time). This victory was also Nicklaus' 11th professional major, tying him with Walter Hagen, and made him {{the first player to}} win the U.S. Amateur and U.S. Open championships on the same golf course.|$|E
25|$|In {{their first}} match after the World Cup campaign, Scotland faced France in the {{southern}} French town of Lezignan. Shaun McRae, citing his domestic coaching at Hull, departed as Scotland coach and Glasgow-born Billy McGinty took over the role with the then Swinton Lions coach and former Great Britain player Mike Gregory taking the role of assistant coach. The squad for this match included 13 survivors from the World Cup matches and three new players who were each earning their first international cap. The Scots {{got off to a}} great start, scoring three tries in the first 13 minutes <b>and</b> <b>never</b> <b>looked</b> back as they won the match 42–20. The heat in the French summer was thought to be a problem going into the match, but Scotland scored seven tries in total to record their first win against the French and arguably their best win yet in international competition. Two tries each were scored by Danny Arnold and Jason Flowers, and Matt Crowther converted all seven tries. Seven years later this victory is Scotland's biggest win and is still recognised as one of their best amongst supporters.|$|E

The Illinois contest was a rematch from ten days earlier. After a 31–30 Michigan halftime lead resulting from 11 lead changes, Illinois shut down Michigan early in the second half to build a 57–45 lead with 5 minutes remaining. In the game, Michigan did not attempt a free throw until the last 1 minute and 45 seconds of the second half. [...] Against Ohio State, Michigan struggled against a 1–2–2 zone early in the game and fell behind by 11 before closing to a 29–25 halftime deficit. Michigan took a 44–40 lead with eight minutes remaining, and the score was tied at 47 before Ohio State ran off 10 points in a row. The game was a twentieth year celebration of the last Wolverine national championship with all but two members of the 1989 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament championship team in attendance as the team wore throwback uniforms. [...] The consecutive losses caused the team to lose almost all of their support in the national rankings. [...] On January 20, in a contest against Penn State that pitted the conferences two leading scorers (Harris and Talor Battle), Michigan shot 9 for 30 from the field in the first half including 2 for 16 on three-point shot attempts. They fell behind by as many as 23 points in the second half. The loss extended the losing streak to three games.
