About eighty persons of all nationalities, including India, were present, and they did not separate until several hours after midnight. It was an event frequently referred to afterwards amongst the residents, and to this day there are <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> who still speak of it.|$|E

2500|$|... "When {{ten years}} old, I {{was in my}} first battle on the Tongue River. It was an {{overland}} train of covered wagons who had soldiers with them. The way it was started, the soldiers fired on the Indians, our tribe, only <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>of</b> <b>us.</b> We went to our friends and told them we had been fired on by the soldiers, and they surrounded the train {{and we had a}} fight with them. I do not know how many we killed of the soldiers, but they killed four of us. After that we had a good many battles, but I did not take any scalps for a good while. I cannot tell how many I killed when a young man." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{band played}} what {{would turn out}} to be their final concert on September 9, 2000 in Nottingham, England. Following the California tour, the members again went their {{separate}} ways in order to pursue their various side projects. During the early 2000s, Patton was primarily touring and recording with his metal project Fantômas and the newly formed supergroup Tomahawk. Mr. Bungle were assumed to be in another period of self-described [...] "hibernation",, with Patton optimistically stating in October 2001 to Kerrang! that [...] "it's gotta take a rest. There's <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> that aren't even ready to face it again for a while.

2500|$|Upon release, Record Mirror {{reviewed}} Slade in Flame and commented: [...] "Because Flame {{is set in}} the 1960s, {{the album}} has a distinctive 1960's flavour, which should take <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> hopping down memory lane. Because the songs have been taken out of context, a few of them have lost their charm and meaning but nevertheless, it is an enjoyable elpee." [...] In 1976, Record Mirror would voted the album No. 5 on their list of the Top 10 best albums of 1975. Disc said: [...] "This is the album from Slade's debut film. The group that's playing is not supposed to be them but the music included here certainly sounds like the Slade we all know and love. Only occasionally, do they stray from the usual mould. A touchy album but definitely more good than bad." ...|$|E
2500|$|While touring Europe in late March 1970, Green took LSD at a {{party at}} a commune in Munich, an {{incident}} cited by Fleetwood Mac manager Clifford Davis as the crucial point in his mental decline. Communard Rainer Langhans mentions in his autobiography that he and Uschi Obermaier met Green in Munich, where they invited him to their Highfisch-Kommune. Their real intention was to persuade Green to help arrange for Jimi Hendrix and The Rolling Stones to perform as headline acts at a Woodstock-styled festival in Bavaria. Fleetwood Mac roadie Dinky Dawson remembers that Green went to the party with another roadie, Dennis Keane, and that when Keane returned to the band's hotel to explain that Green would not leave the commune, Keane, Dawson and Mick Fleetwood travelled there to fetch Green. By contrast, Green stated that he had fond memories of jamming at the commune when speaking in 2009: [...] "I had a good play there, it was great, someone recorded it, {{they gave me a}} tape. There were people playing along, <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> just fooling around and it was... yeah it was great." [...] He told Jeremy Spencer at the time [...] "That's the most spiritual music I've ever recorded in my life." [...] After a final performance on 20 May 1970, Green left Fleetwood Mac.|$|E

6000|$|He went on eagerly. [...] "That is {{precisely}} how I see it.
