25|$|This sura {{has been}} {{interpreted}} to mean Qur'an forbids man to change nature or mutilate any creature. Islamic scholars against FGM claim that this verse from Qur'an forbids <b>all</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> change what nature has meant it to be, including female circumcision and birth control. Some scholars find this religious view unpersuasive, because Muslim male circumcision also mutilates and changes nature, and male circumcision is a practice that is widely considered as obligatory to recommended under Islam.|$|E

25|$|Since nature {{works for}} a {{determinate}} end {{under the direction of}} a higher agent, whatever is done by nature must needs be traced back to God, as to its first cause. So also whatever is done voluntarily must also be traced back to some higher cause other than human reason or will, since these can change or fail; for <b>all</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> are changeable and capable of defect must be traced back to an immovable and self-necessary first principle, as was shown {{in the body of the}} Article.|$|E
25|$|In England, {{some of the}} Cambridge Platonists {{approached}} hylozoism as well. Both Henry More and Ralph Cudworth (the Younger, 1617–1688), {{through their}} reconciliation of Platonic idealism with Christian doctrines of deific generation, {{came to see the}} divine lifeforce as the informing principle in the world. Thus, like Bruno, but not nearly to the extreme, they saw God's generative impulse as giving life to <b>all</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> exist. Accordingly, Cudworth, the most systematic metaphysician of the Cambridge Platonist tradition, fought hylozoism. His work is primarily a critique of what he took to be the two principal forms of atheism. i.e. materialism and hylozoism.|$|E

On this, Barbarika replied that a single arrow was enough to destroy all his opponents in the war, and it would then return to his quiver. He stated that, the first arrow is used to mark <b>all</b> the <b>things</b> <b>that</b> he wants to destroy. On releasing the third arrow, it would destroy <b>all</b> the <b>things</b> <b>that</b> are marked and will then return to his quiver.

25|$|Along with asking moral questions, Slaughterhouse-Five {{is also a}} {{novel that}} focuses on the philosophies of fate and free will. In the novel, Billy Pilgrim tries to {{determine}} what his role in life is and what the purpose of everything going on around him is as well. When abducted by the Tralfamdorians, Pilgrim asks them why he is chosen among all the others. He questions the fate of the situation and what led up to that point. Billy Pilgrim considers his fate and actions {{to be a part of}} a larger network of actions, his future manipulated by one thing over another based on decision. <b>All</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> happen would happen for a reason. Indeed, Pilgrim’s beginning mindset would suggest that he believed in free will, fate, whys, decisions and things happening for reasons. However, many of these thoughts are quickly challenged by the Tralfamadorians' ideology.|$|E

500|$|Blyton's manuscripts {{had been}} {{rejected}} by publishers on many occasions, which only made her more determined to succeed: [...] "it is partly the struggle that helps you so much, that gives you determination, character, self-reliance– <b>all</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> help in any profession or trade, and most certainly in writing". In March 1916 her first poems were published in Nash's Magazine. She completed her teacher training course in December 1918, and the following month obtained a teaching appointment at Bickley Park School, a small independent establishment for boys in Bickley, Kent. Two months later Blyton received a teaching certificate with distinctions in zoology and principles of education, 1st class in botany, geography, practice and history of education, child hygiene and class teaching and 2nd class in literature and elementary mathematics. In 1920 she moved to Southernhay in Hook Road Surbiton as nursery governess to the four sons of architect Horace Thompson and his wife Gertrude, with whom Blyton spent four happy years. Owing to a shortage of schools in the area her charges were soon joined by the children of neighbours, and a small school developed at the house.|$|E
500|$|Tainton and {{the other}} white opponents of the {{concession}} contended that the document conferred upon the grantees all of the watershed's minerals, lands, wood and water, and was therefore tantamount to a purchase receipt for the whole country. Thompson, backed by the missionaries, insisted that the agreement only involved the extraction of metals and minerals, and that anything else the concessionaires might do was covered by the concession's granting of [...] "full power to do <b>all</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> they may deem necessary to win and procure" [...] the mining yield. William Mzisi, a Fengu from the Cape, who {{had been to the}} diamond fields at Kimberley, pointed out that the mining would take thousands of men rather than the handful Lobengula had imagined, and argued that digging into the land amounted to taking possession of it: [...] "You say you do not want any land, how can you dig for gold without it, is it not in the land?" [...] Thompson was then questioned as to where exactly it had been agreed that the concessionaires could mine; he affirmed that the document licensed them to prospect and dig anywhere in the country.|$|E

Hale also noted {{the introduction of the}} Darkhold, Coulson and May's interactions, and the added mystery to Mace's character as <b>all</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> make [...] "for good viewing and has me hooked for next week." [...] Vulture's Scott Meslow scored the episode three stars out of 5, feeling the season was lacking a [...] "truly compelling villain" [...] and saying the ghost effects look [...] "absolutely terrible". Meslow said the prison scenes had [...] "quippy dialogue" [...] and [...] "solid action scenes", but was more interested in the Mace/Simmons storyline. For Nerdist, Joseph McCabe said, [...] "When S.H.I.E.L.D. is at its best, it doesn’t offer viewers much to dissect.

[...] He felt the episode had several satisfying character-based moments, especially the scenes between Coulson and May, and though McCabe felt Woods was not the most [...] "adept at staging fight sequences", he still praised the choreography of Johnson's action scenes.|$|E

Quinto {{expressed}} interest in the role because of the duality of Spock's half-human, half-Vulcan heritage, and how [...] "he is constantly exploring that notion of how to evolve in a responsible way and how to evolve in a respectful way. I think those are <b>all</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> we as a society, and certainly the world, could implement." [...] He mentioned he heard about the new film and revealed {{his interest in the}} role in a December 2006 interview with the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette; the article was widely circulated and he attracted Abrams' interest. For the audition, Quinto wore a blue shirt and flattened his hair down to feel more like Spock. He bound his fingers to practice the Vulcan salute, shaved his eyebrows, and grew and dyed his hair for the role. He conveyed many of Spock's attributes, such as his stillness and the way Nimoy would hold his hands behind his back. Quinto commented that the physical transformation aided in portraying an alien, joking [...] "I just felt like a nerd. I felt like I was 12 again. You look back at those pictures and you see the bowl cut. There's no question I was born to play the Spock role. I was sporting that look for a good four or five years. The film officially establishes (to Kirk's surprise) that Uhura and Spock are lovers and have been romantically linked for some time, a point which had never been previously explored on TV or in film." [...] Adrien Brody had discussed playing the role with the director before Quinto was cast.|$|E
