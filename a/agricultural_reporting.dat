40|$|A {{procedure}} for manual acreage estimation from Landsat imagery is proposed which involves a stepwise sequence of area stratification, simple size estimation, acreage estimation, and acreage precision calculation. The sample design {{consists of a}} systematic point sample of the Landsat imagery for crop type presence calibrated by a double sample of several image points having crop season-coincident ground data. The sample point layout chosen for cost-efficiency in manual sampling is a doubly aligned point matrix. The significant advantage of this sampling approach is that crop information is available from throughout the <b>agricultural</b> <b>reporting</b> unit. For technique demonstration purposes three strata were selected for sampling. The proposed technique can complement more sophisticated computer-based acreage estimation methodologies, and refinements in the sampling techniques promise significant improvements for operational utility...|$|E
40|$|Remote sensing of {{agricultural}} land permits crop classification and mensuration {{which can lead}} to improved forecasts of production. This technique is particularly important for nations which do not already have an accurate <b>agricultural</b> <b>reporting</b> system. Better forecasts have important economic effects. International grain traders can make better decisions about when to store, buy, and sell. Farmers can make better planting decisions by taking advantage of production estimates for areas out of phase with their own agricultural calendar. World economic benefits will accrue to both buyers and sellers because of increased food supply and price stabilization. This paper reviews the econometric models used to establish this scenario and estimates the dollar value of benefits for world wheat as 200 million dollars annually for the United States and 300 to 400 million dollars annually {{for the rest of the}} world...|$|E

40|$|This {{research}} was conducted to explore how the San Jose Mercury News (formerly San Jose Mercury Herald) covered the Santa Clara Valley 2 ̆ 7 s transition from an agricultural community known as 2 ̆ 2 The Valley of Heart 2 ̆ 7 s Delight 2 ̆ 2 to Silicon Valley, focusing on the changes made in the reporting of farm and ranch news. The time period surveyed in this thesis is from 1935 to 2000. The purpose was to establish any changes to reporting agricultural news over the years. A social history of agricultural journalism in the San Jose Mercury News over a 65 -year period provided insight into how the farming industry was portrayed by this publication. The study revealed three major frames within the time period: first, agriculture as a livelihood; second, agriculture as an industry; third, agriculture as a novelty. There was {{a significant change in}} reporting over the 65 -year period, and as the area transitioned into Silicon Valley, <b>agricultural</b> <b>reporting</b> largely disappeared from the paper.

40|$|Recent {{advances}} in cloud-based technology {{has led to}} the rapid increase of geospatial web-based applications. The combination of GIS and cloud-based solutions is revolutionizing product development in the geospatial industry and is facilitating accessibility to a wider range of users, planners and decision makers. Accessible through an internet browser, web applications are an effective and convenient method to disseminate information in multiple formats, and they provide an interface offering interactive access to geospatial data, real-time integration and data processing, and application specific analysis tools. An example of such a web application is GeoTerraImage’s monthly crop monitoring tool called GeoFarmer. This tool uses climatic data and satellite imagery processed through a complex rule-based algorithms to determine monthly climatic averages and anomalies, and most importantly the field specific crop status (i. e. is the field fallow, or is the crop emerging, or if the field has been harvested). Monthly field verification has formed a part of calibrating the growth classification outputs to further improve the accuracy of its monthly <b>agricultural</b> <b>reporting.</b> The goal of this application is to provide timely data to decision makers to assist them in field-level and regional crop growth monitoring, crop production and management, financial risk assessment and insurance, and food security applications. This web application has the unique advantage of being highly transportable to other regions, since it has been designed so it can easily be adapted to other seasonal growth response patterns, and up-scaled to regional or national coverages for operational use...|$|E
40|$|The Suwannee Democrat [LCCN: sn 95026787] {{is one of}} {{the oldest}} {{continuously}} published weeklies in the State of Florida. It began publishing in 1884 in the city of Live Oak (FL). Noting the shifting demographics of Florida in the 20 th century, in 1906, one observes that Live Oak was the fifth largest city in Florida, preceded only by Jacksonville, Pensacola, Tampa, and Key West. The Suwannee Democrat enjoyed a corresponding reputation as a journalistic leader in early 20 th century Florida. For approximately two years, from 1906 through 1907, the weekly Suwannee Democrat was supplemented by the Live Oak (FL) Daily Democrat [LCCN: sn 95026788]. The Suwannee Democrat has won numerous awards from the Florida Press Association, both as in the weekly category and for the quality of its <b>agricultural</b> <b>reporting.</b> In its early days, the Suwannee Democrat reported a Democrat Party affiliation. The newspaper's first editor hid under an assumed name when he was suspected of murder. A deathbed confession by the actual perpetrator allowed him to resume his true identity: F. R. McCormack. Very little else, however, is known of F. R. McCormack. Fires have taken their toll on the Suwannee Democrat. In 1906, a disgruntled printer left by railroad on the night that its offices burned to the ground. Arson again in October 1995, destroyed a historic block of Live Oak's downtown and the newspaper's office was one of the casualties. Lost in the fire were last-known issues of the Suwannee Democrat dating from 1897 through 1900. The issues had just been scheduled for preservation microfilming under the auspices of the U. S. Newspaper Program, when they were destroyed. The event was bitterly regretted and served to show the precariousness of local newspaper archives. Live Oak is the seat of Suwannee County (FL) government. Suwannee County is surrounded on three sides by the Suwannee River. And, its karst topography gives the area an abundance of natural springs and fresh water. Industries of the region, particularly during the early days of the Suwannee Democrat, were lumber, turpentine and cotton. Live Oak was known for its grist and lumber mills. The character of these industries and the regional economy survived through the 1920 s, when economic down-turn resulted in change. Change was already being seen as early as 1910, when the poultry underwent industrialization in the county. Poultry took such a strong foothold in Suwannee County that even front yards were cultivated for the production of feed grains. Agriculture and other land-based industries, particularly forestry and related industries, were also seeing change with the establishment of nurseries supplying hybrid bulbs and plants to markets. The Crash of 1929 and the Great Depression brought change and growth to a halt. With recovery, the region became semi-rural. Florida's demographic shifts, both that following World War II and the completion of the Interstate Highway System initiated by Governor Bryant in the 1960 s, have marked a trend of increasing urbanization in Suwannee County.
