40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} whether <b>adherance</b> to a modified vegetarian diet predisposed young female athletes to iron deficiency. Two groups of female distance runners volunteered to be subjects for this study. One group consisted of women who regularly consumed red meat, and the other groups women who consumed a modified vegetarian diet. Three day dietary records analyzed to estimate nutrient intake, including available iron. Measures of serum ferritin, serum iron, total iron binding capacity, percent transferrin saturation, hemoglobin and hematocrit were done to asses iron status. The two groups did not differ in the amount of total iron or available iron in their diets. The red meat eating subjects consumed significantly more heme iron from their diets than the modified vegetarians; however there were no differences between the two groups in any of the measures of hematological or iron status. While there were no differences between the two groups in the percent of subjects classified in each stage, 37 % of all of the subjects were classified as having a stage 1 deficiency, associated with iron deficient stores, and 11 % of the subjects were classified as having a stage 2 deficiency, indicating iron deficient erythropoiesis.

40|$|Background: Smoking is {{the most}} {{important}} preventable cause of adverse outcomes in pregnancy. However, most smokers who become pregnant continue to smoke and most of those who quit relapse after delivery. Objective: This article explores the relationship between smoking and pregnancy, and reviews the evidence for best practice intervention by general practitioners. Discussion: Continuing to smoke during pregnancy is strongly associated with socioeconomic disadvantage, mental illness and Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander populations. Quitting is more difficult for these groups and interventions assist only sixin every 100 pregnant smokers to quit. Behavioural counselling is the first-line treatment. Nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) can be offered if the smoker is unable to quit without it, although its efficacy is uncertain. Adequate doses of nicotine and good <b>adherance</b> may be required for the best results. The use of NRT in pregnancy is likely to be less harmful than continuing to smoke.

This paper attempts to explain why academic achievement has such symbolic and mental prestige in Japan.

Therefore it is possible to regard the prestige of academic achievement in Japan as one of the linkage-patterns of the educational system to its environment. I show an alternative theoretical framework after examining how the possibility of education-outer linkage has been explained by pre- dominant theories. I contend that the highly symbolic and mental prestige of academic achievement in Japanese society derives from that function as a medium linking the educational system to its environment. Unlike Euro-American societies, the Japanese educational system links to its outer society almost only through the academic achievement as a symbolic medium...|$|E

These materials are generally prepared by chemically initiated polymerization, but {{this can lead to}} the presence of unwanted initiator fragments in the polymer matrix. In the present work, initiation of polymerization by gamma-irradiation of hydroxyethyl methacrylate, with and without added crosslinkers, has been investigated, and the diffusion coefficients for water in the resulting polymers have been measured through mass uptake by the polymers. The diffusion of water in poly(hydroxyethyl methacrylate) at 310 K was found to be Fickian, with a diffusion coefficient of 1. 96 +/- 0. 1 x 10 (11) m(2) s(- 1) and an equilibrium water content of 58 %, NMR imaging analyses confirmed the <b>adherance</b> to a Fickian model of the diffusion of water into polymer cylinders.

The second method is by adding untreated coconut fibers with a 2. 5 cm fiber length as additional reinforcements. The effect of 3 %, 5 % and 7 % fiber addition to the mechanical properties of bricks were investigated. Laboratory tests showed that higher compressive strengths, compared to that of traditional unfired soil lime bricks, could be achieved through the 2 proposed methods.

40|$|Abstract—A {{technique}} for block-loss restoration in block-based image and video coding, dubbed recovery of image blocks {{using the method}} of alternating projections (RIBMAP), is developed. The algorithm is based on orthogonal projections onto constraint sets in a Hilbert space. For the recovery of a linear dimension size block, a total of 8 vectors are extracted from the surrounding area of an missing block. These vectors form a library from which the best matching spatial information for the missing block is extracted. Recovery vectors, including both undamaged and restored damaged pixels, are introduced. The vectors are used to find highly correlated information relating to the lost pixels. To assure continuity with the surrounding undamaged area, three additional convex constraints are formulated. <b>Adherance</b> to these sets is imposed using alternating projections. Simulation results using orthogonal projections demonstrate that RIBMAP recovers spatial structure faithfully. Simulation comparisons with other procedures are presented: Ancis and Giusto’s hybrid edge-based average-median interpolation technique, Sun and Kwok’s pro-jections onto convex sets-based method, Hemami and Meng’s interblock correlation interpolation approach, Shirani et al. ’s modified interblock correlation interpolation scheme, and Alka-chouh and Bellanger’s fast discrete cosine transformation-based spatial domain interpolation algorithm. Characteristic of the results {{are those of the}} “Lena ” JPEG image when one fourth of periodically spaced blocks in the image have errors. The peak signal-to-noise ratio of the restored image is 28. 68, 29. 99, 31. 86, 31. 69, 31. 57, and 34. 65 dB using that of Ancis and Giusto, Sun and Kwok, Hemami and Meng, Shirani et al., Alkachouh and Bellanger, and RIPMAP, respectively.

Many aspects have been considered, such as the definition and the aims of genetic services, their organization, the quality assessment, public education, {{as well as the}} partnership with patients support groups and the multicultural aspects. The methods was primarily the analysis of professional guidelines, legal frameworks and other documents related to the organization of genetic services, mainly from Europe, but also from USA and international organizations. Then, the method was to examine the background data emerging from an updated report produced by the Concerted Action on Genetic Services in Europe, as well as the issues debated by 43 experts from 17 European countries invited to an international workshop organized by the European Society of Human Genetics Public and Professional Policy Committee in Helsinki, Finland, 8 and 9 September 2000. Some conclusions were identified from the ESHG workshop to arrive at outlines for optimal genetic services.

40|$|Epilithic diatom {{communities}} and relevant physico-chemical variables were studied between 3 May and 16 July 1993 in Harwood Beck, an oligotrophic stream in Upper Teesdale, and the River Browney, a lowland eutrophic river. The effect of stormflow on diatom-based water quality indices was assessed. In both rivers epilithic chlorophyll ḁ (µg cm(^- 2)) was highly variable and very low after mid- June. In Harwood Beck {{there was a}} significant difference in epihthic chlorophyll a between cobbles and boulders, with the greatest difference after stormflow. Epilithic chlorophyll a in the River Browney was initially high, but declined markedly after stormflow. River Browney chlorophyll a was inversely correlated with current speed on cobbles and total inorganic nitrogen on cobbles and boulders. Uptake of inorganic nitrogen may be directly related to epilithic diatom biomass. A sharp rise in the percentage of Cocconeis placentula between mid-June and mid-July suggests that grazing may be an important factor limiting algal biomass. The possible roles of algal grazers, Cladophora glomerata and silicate concentration, in progressively limiting diatom biomass during the summer are discussed. Percentage composition changes of taxa after stormflow are generally related to taxa morphology and mode of <b>adherance</b> to the substrate. There were no significant differences in the percentages of the five most common taxa between cobbles and boulders. Percentage changes in taxa were not significantly correlated with nutrients, with the exception of Navicula gregaria and N. lanceolata (in the River Browney) which were inversely correlated with the concentration of total inorganic nitrogen. There appears to be a succession of dominant species, possibly related to the influence of flow and nutrient concentrations, which tended to increase during the study period. Diatom water quality indices remained relatively stable over the 10 week period. Effectively equal water quality classifications were derived from the Specific Pollution Index (SPI) and Generic Diatom Index (GDI).

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} pressure-sensitive labels for library application, techniques, and considerations for their removal from paper substrates. The aim was to use information from the literature to design a method for the removal of pressure-sensitive labels from paper covered half bindings using agar, commonly known as agar-agar, as a solvent gel. The study is divided into two parts: a literature study with the aim to compile information relevant to the purpose of the study, and a case study for the removal of barcodes from three books made available by the Humanities Library of Gothenburg University Library. To analyse the barcodes, stereo microscopy, Attenuated Total Reflectance – Fourier Transform Infrared (ATR-FTIR) spectroscopy, and spot tests were conducted. Agar was subsequently tested and evaluated as a solvent gel in a practical removal. Analysis of the barcodes on the studied books showed that they are built-up of three layers with a pressure-sensitive adhesive closest matching that of a poly(methyl acrylate) emulsion. A 2 % agar gel was divided into three batches and mixed with 20 % ethanol, 20 % 1 : 1 acetone:ethanol, and 29 % ethyl acetate. While all of the removals were considered somewhat effective, the ethyl acetate agar gel gave the best results with the least damage to the surface layer of the paper. Based on the evaluation it could be concluded that agar shows great promise as a solvent gel. The study showed that issues to take into consideration can be roughly divided into three aspects: 1) the purpose of the label, and historic circumstances related to the label; 2) whether the label obscures or contains information crucial to the interpretation of the object as an entity; and 3) damages caused, or potential damages that might arise from its continued <b>adherance</b> to the substrate.

Complications are a five-fold risk of stroke, three-fold incidence of heart failure, doubled mortality and frequent hospitalizations. Treatment includes electrocardioversion, drugs for rate and rhythm control and anticoagulation. Additional rhythm-regulating therapy is pulmonary veins isolation. Radiofrequency energy terminates ectopic triggers in the area between the pulmonary veins and the left atrium. Current European and national guidelines recommend catheter ablation as second-line treatment for symptomatic drug-refractory atrial fibrillation, or as first-line therapy in a selected group. Aim – To study patients referred to pulmonary vein isolation by the medical departments in Region Halland during 2013 - 2014. We aimed at studying patient volumes, adherence to treatment guidelines and short-term outcome including complications. Methods – A retrospective medical record review with clinical and administrative data collected from the medical record system VAS in Region Halland analysed with descriptive statistics in Excel. Results – The study population of 105 patients is predominately cardiovascular healthy with symptomatic, drug-refractory paroxysmal atrial fibrillation. Northern Halland refers a majority of 124 procedures. Arrhythmia Center Stockholm executed 80 % of ablations. The waiting time for the operation was fulfilled according to Health Care Guarantee in half of the cases, however with great differences between ablation centres.

40|$|By 1925 French {{military}} officers had described the tactics, equipment, and organization for fast-moving mechanized warfare supported by ground-attack aviation. By 1940, {{in spite of}} having superior numbers of modern tanks and aircraft, the French army and air force were unable {{to use their own}} aviation and armor effectively, and could not cope with German use of these forces. To understand these developments in the intellectual history of the French army, a psychological and institutional analysis of the French officer corps is necessary. ^ A scale of psychological autonomy-dependency derived from an integration of psychoanalytic theory with military concepts makes it possible to evaluate the psychological states reflected in articles written between 1920 and 1940 in military journals. Two sets of trends emerged [...] one by branch and the other across time. Infantry officers displayed dependency throughout the inter-war years, with the degree of dependency increasing as war drew closer. Artillerymen were autonomous after the war, then plunged into dependency during the period of disarmament. Cavalry officers showed autonomous thinking throughout [...] imaginative conceptualizations first, then practical improvisations and experimentation, and finally organization and practice of modern techniques. Aviators were confused just after the war, then exploded into autonomous creativity during the disarmament era only to sag into dependency after 1933. ^ These psychological trends were associated with public rejection of military values, governmental and legislative repudiation, political manipulation, and incipient technological changes in warfare. Concurrently there were inter-branch struggles provoked by changes during 1914 - 1918 in the relative influence of the branches. To protect themselves psychologically from uncertainties that threatened their competence, their identities, and their careers, officers progressively elaborated the bureaucratic structure of the army. The resulting closing of communication destroyed trust between echelons and cooperation between branches. Rigid <b>adherance</b> to the doctrine and regulations that defined and governed the military bureaucracies led to divorce from reality. Resistance to new ideas that could compromise the reassuring certainties of the regulations produced maladaptive behavior on the battlefield. Dependency on the institution focussed officers 2 ̆ 7 attention on corporate interests rather than on the defense of France. ...|$|E

However an association has been observed between long term non progression to disease, and the presence of functional HIV specific T cell responses. A novel Clade A HIV-l vaccine was designed to elicit T cell responses, delivered as pTH. HIVA or MVA. HIVA and has been trialled in HIV negative humans over the last 5 years. Results of the most recent clinical trials are presented, using sensitive T cell assays optimised in this study.

In addition, an analysis was conducted to see if curriculum in AACSB-accredited information systems programs across the United States changed significantly since other similar evaluations reported in 1996 and 2006, and whether it is closer in adherence to the IS 2010 curriculum guidelines. The results of this study provided a current-state description of IS curriculums in the United States, specifically: (a) percentage <b>adherance</b> relationships and between AACSB-accredited information systems programs to IS 2010 curriculum guidelines; (b) defined curriculum profiles or latent class cluster characteristics of recent career track developments that have emerged; and (c) perceptions of adherence by the IS department faculty compared to the assessed adherence to IS 2010 curriculum guidelines. In the findings, a comprehensive view of the landscape for adherence to IS curriculum guidelines is discussed, including the following. (a) There is a wide range of adherence to the IS curriculum guidelines. In addition, none of the IS program assessed were either entirely compliant or not compliant at all. (b) Some topics are widely covered (over half) as core curriculum while other topics are offered as core curriculum in less than half of IS programs. (c) Very few IS programs have formally implemented the IS 2010 career track guideline recommendations. (d) IS programs implementing formal career tracks specify a reasonably small number of track options for students to consider. (e) IS programs that include career tracks provide unique offerings beyond the proposed sample tracks depicted in the IS 2010 curriculum guidelines. (f) There appear to be reasonably well-defined categories or clusters of IS programs as related to IS 2010 curriculum guideline adherence. (g) IS program faculty describe a higher perceived adherence to IS curriculum guidelines than what is actually assessed in this study. (228 pages...|$|E
40|$|In general, {{trace element}} {{analysis}} of biological material {{includes the following}} steps: Formulation of the question to be answered by the analytical data, sampling, sample preparation, ashing, dissolution, preconcentration, separation, preparation of the measurement sample, physical measurement (integral, spectral, calibration), data processing, data evaluation and answering the question. Both sampling and the sample preparation are crucial stages for any trace analysis. Knowledge of numerous factors and strict <b>adherance</b> to all the requirements is unavoidable, if results are to be reliable. Sampling of biological material involves some fundamental aspects such as representative mean composition, representative variance, accuracy and efficiency of sampling. The general sampling methods used may be random, systematic or of differentiated types. Various parameters such as size of the totality of material, number {{and size of the}} particles, distribution of trace elements between different types of particles influence the optimal size of the sample. There are some basic hazards in trace element analysis, which arise from contamination of the sample by the elements, lass of trace elements and change in mean composition with respect to the elements to be analysed. Contamination of the sample may occur fromthe environment, the sampling operation itself and the operating personnel. Trace elements may be lost by volatilization during drying and ashing, adsorption on container walls and handling tools, overlooked differences in the chemical state of the element and also bysputtering and spraying in case of liquids. The changes in the mean trace element composition of the sample may result from the physical or chemical changes and by redistribution of the elements. The main sampling operations for solid tissues include the selection of an optimal sampling method, the sampling site and the preparation of the sampling equipment. Liquid samples require additional treatment {{such as the use of}} a stabilizer and phase separation. lt is also necessary to obtain timed collection for samples such as urine and feces. Special restrictions have to be observed for both liquid and solid samples due to medical reasons, especially for in-vivo samples. Same sort of a preliminary preservation of both the solid and liquid samples is necessary du ring transport to the laboratory. Sample preparation of biological material is necessary in order to prepare the samples for obtaining the analytical signal. A few requirements such as a weil defined analytical programme, prior knowledge of the approximate elemental composition of the sample matrix and a reasonably clean bench to suit the low concentration level analytical work and adequate precautions against the basic hazards mentioned above are some of the basic necessities.

40|$|Introduction Injecting {{drug use}} has {{resulted}} in major international public health problems. Estimates {{suggest that there are}} between 11 - 21 million individuals who inject drugs worldwide. Methadone Assisted Treatment (MAT) is becoming a more common approach to addressing the health, social, and financial ramifications of addiction. Tanzania now has an estimated 25, 000 drug injectors, 40 percent of them infected with H. I. V. The main question is what factors influence one to adhere to methadone treatment. A number of previous Western studies have found evidence for a number of possible factors that may be associated with methadone treatment adherence such as age, gender, occupation, education, social relationship and support. The current study explores {{the extent to which these}} factors may be associated with <b>adherance</b> in a low income country with an IDU evolution and profile remarkably different from many Western countries Objectives To identify factors associated with adherence to methadone treatment among IDU attending MAT at MNH Study Design This was a retrospective cross sectional study retrieved data from clinical records. Methods This study collected data from both male and female clients who were enrolled to the methadone clinic from February 2011 to February 2013. The study analyzed data from 609 client’s files. The sample size allowed for comparison between participants who have adhered and those who had not adhered. A checklist aimed at retrieving information from clinical records (files) was developed. Questions on the checklist match with information found in the files (MAT program questionnaire) and included sociodemographics, health status (physical and mental) and psychosocial/behavioral characteristics). Data was analyzed using the SPSS version 18 Results Data from total of 632 files of clients enrolled at MNH MAT clinic was collected. Final analysis included data from 609 participant’s files with mean age (SD) of 34. 28 years (6. 41). The proportion of participants adhering to methadone treatment among IDUs attending MAT clinic at MNH was 75 % (460) and 25 % (149) did not adhere to the treatment. Bivariate analysis: There was a significant association between adherence and employment as source of income (p= 0. 031), results show that participants whose source of income is from employment compared to not employment are 1. 5 times more likely to adhere to methadone treatment (OR, 1. 50, 95 % CI: 1. 00 - 2. 23). Hospitalization was another factor that showed a significant association with adherence to methadone treatment (p= 0. 027). Crudes odds ratio suggest that participants with a low number of hospitalization compared to no hospitalization were 49 % less likely to adhere (OR, 0. 51, 95 % CI: 0. 29 - 0. 86) and those who had high number of hospitalization compared to no hospitalization were also less likely to adhere to methadone treatment (OR, 0. 50, 95 % CI: 0. 29 - 0. 87). Furthermore, incarceration showed a significant relationship with adherence (p= 0. 017) with crudes OR of 1. 71 (95 % CI: 1. 08 - 2. 72). There was also a significant relationship between quality of life and adherence (p= 0. 028). Multivariate Analysis: Gender was the only factor that was found to show a significant association with adherence. Male participants compare to female were 0. 24 less likely to adhere to treatment (OR, 0. 24, 95 % CI: 0. 07 - 0. 85). Conclusion and Recommendations This is the first MAT in sub sahara Africa and this is the first study exploring factors that may be associated with adherence in this cultural context. It is evident from the relatively low drop out rate (25 % at two year follow up) that factors that are associated with non adherence are being addressed to a great extent in the MAT programme...|$|E
40|$|Targeted {{delivery}} of drugs {{directly to the}} lung epithelium is a promising, though challenging, strategy {{for the treatment of}} diseases that affect the lung tissues, such as infections caused by cell-penetrating pathogens, cystic fibrosis, and cancer. With appropriate surface functionality, such as through the attachment of ligands that recognize receptors on cellular surfaces, particulate carriers show improved efficiency in penetrating cells in vitro. A useful class of ligands is produced by many natural human pathogens that infect the respiratory tract. A variety of phylogenetically distinct respiratory bacterial pathogens, such as Haemophilus influenzae, invade host cells in the upper airways by binding of the platelet-activating factor (PAF) receptor via lipooligosaccharide (LOS) glycoforms. By expressing host carbohydrate structures, including phosphorylcholine (ChoP), as a terminal structure on the LOS, the bacteria exhibit molecular mimicry of the host and are able to evade the host immune system. The effectiveness of LOS to induce cellular uptake of the bacteria is dependent on the specific glycoform, with higher ChoP content inducing more bacterial <b>adherance</b> into the lung epithelial. These ligands naturally expressed on bacterial cell surfaces can be isolated and utilized as targeting ligands for delivery vehicles. The studies described in this thesis focus on the development of particulate drug carriers coated with LOS bacterial ligands to enhance the targeting and binding of the carriers to the lung epithelium. Three NTHi clinical isolates were screened to select the strain with the highest ChoP level, and NTHi 3198, an isolate from a patient with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), was selected due to its high ChoP activity. LOS from NTHi 3198 was isolated from the bacterial cell membrane, and its activity verified using dot immunoblot and ELISA techniques. Particles (0. 2 and 1 µm) composed of polystyrene or poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) were passively coated with 0. 005 - 50 µg/mL of the isolated LOS 3198 with or without gelatin, coated with gelatin alone, or left uncoated. The LOS coating on the particles was verified using either XPS or ELISA. The association of particles with human bronchial epithelial cells was investigated using two cell culture models, 16 HBE 14 o- and Calu- 3, as a function of particle concentration and incubation time. The expression of PAFR on both cells types was confirmed, though the expression of PAFR on 16 HBE 14 o- cells was significantly greater than on Calu- 3 cells. Enhancement of 0. 2 µm particle-cell association was achieved through coating of the particles with LOS. However, no significant difference in particle-cell association was observed for the 1 µm particles based on particle coating. Control particles of 0. 2 µm size, those coated with gelatin (with or without LOS) or uncoated, exhibited low cell binding with a maximum of about 10 - 18 % of cells associated with particles. The ability of the LOS ligand to enhance particle-cell association was coating concentration dependent, with a low coating concentration of LOS having little effect on association, but a concentration 1000 -fold higher causing a doubling of the percentage of cells associated with particles at 24 hours. This enhancement was attributed to increased cellular binding of the 0. 2 µm particles to the cell surface by confocal microscopy, and was further increased by activating the PAFR prior to incubation with particles. These results suggest the potential application of LOS as a targeting ligand for lung epithelial cells, especially under conditions where PAFR has been activated, such as occurs in lungs infected with Haemophilus influenzae. A significant reduction in particle-cell association was observed when particles were incubated with Calu- 3 cells due to the presence of mucus on the cellular surface. This suggests that further optimization of the drug carrier system is needed to efficiently overcome the mucosal fluids...|$|E
40|$|The {{aggregation}} method utilizes outbred blastocysts {{which are}} easier to obtain in numbers. The ES cells are intorduced into the developing embryo by the <b>adherance</b> of the cells to a dezonulated 8 cell stage embryo. The embryos are cultured to blastocysts and then transfered into a pseudopregnant hybrid (C 57 X CBA) F 1 recipient. ### Method: **Preparation of the aggregation plate. ** Aggregation {{and culture of the}} embryos with the ES cells is performed in microwells prepared in a plastic tissue culture plate using a darning needle. 1. In a 6 cm petri dish add up to 10 drops of M 16 media (ca. 3 - 4 mm, larger allows too muh turbulence when the palte is moved). - Cover the entire plate with parafin or Dow Corning Fluid 200 (viscosity 50 cs). - Sterilize a darning needle by dipping in ethanol and ignite. Note be very careful not to burn the plastic layer off (ie. don't place in a bunsen burner). Just sterilizing in ethanol is probably sufficient and more"needle friendly". - Press the darning needle through the oil and media into the palstic and make a circular movement with the free end of the needle but DO NOT twist the needle (it scores the sides). The well should be ca. 300 um dia with a smooth wall. *NOTE. In our experience it is critical to make the wells through the oil and media rather than on a dry plate, presumably to make smooth (lubricated) wells. When we made wells on dry plates the embryos always died*. - Make 5 - 6 wells in each drop and then return the plate to the incubator. **Removal of the Zona pellucida from the embryo. ** After recovering 2. 5 day mouse embryos (see Flushing Morula protocol) the zona is removed in acid Tyrode's solution. Acid Tyrode's: ![Table 1]([URL] "Table 1 ") - Make to 90 ml with Travenol water and dissolve components. Adjust pH to 2. 5 with 5 M HCl and make to 100 ml with Travenol water. Filter sterilize and make aliquots of 1 ml. Store at - 20 °C. - Warm to room temperature before use. - After removing the zona the embryos become extremely sticky and therefore siliconized pipettes are required for handling them. **Siliconizing Capillary Glass** Embryos that have had the zona pellucida (jelly-like outer coating) removed are "sticky" to handle, often getting stuck inside the transfer pipette during handling. This problem is overcome by siliconizing the capillary glass (inside only) before it is used to fashion transfer pipettes. NOTE: This procedure must be carried out wearing gloves in a fume hood! Use a 27 gauge needle and 3 cc syringe (filled) to run a small amount of silicone (Sigmacote) through the inside of a piece of capillary glass, allowing excess Sigmacote to drip into a 10 ml tube. This is repeated with each piece of glass and the glass placed in a measuring cylinder. The excess Sigmacote in the 10 ml tube may be used to refill the syringe when empty. Once 50 - 80 pieces have been siliconized the glass is rinsed no less than eight times with Milli-Q water, shaking the water out of the glass by hand after each rinse. The glass is then rinsed six times with "Travenol" water. The cylinder is then sealed with Parafilm which is punctured several times with a needle to allow evaporation with minimal dust collection. The cylinder is placed in a hot air oven to speed evaporation. Once completely dry, the glass is ready to use. Sigmacote is made by Sigma Chemicals. The catalogue number for Sigmacote is SL- 2 **Dezonulating** 1. Put several drops of M 16 and also acid Tyrodes into a small petri dish (do not mix). - Transfer all of the embryos to one of the drops of M 16. We use Random bred Swiss embryos. - Collect up to 50 embryos (less if unable to handle that no. quickly) with as little media as possible and transfer to a drop of acid Tyrodes, then transfer immediately to a fresh drop of acid Tyrodes. - Agitate the embryos while watching them under the scope. - Transfer the embryos to a drop of M 16 as soon as the zona dissolves. This should take around 90 seconds. - Rinse in a second drop of M 16 immediately and then transfer to the aggregation plate, placing one embryo in each well. Return plate to the incubator. - We include a control of 6 - 8 unmanipulated embryos during the culture period. **Preparation of ES cells for aggregation** We use small clumps of ES cells rather than single ES cells as these are much easier to place in the wells. The cells are harvested essentially as described in "Passaging and Spliting ES cells" except {{that at the end of}} the tyripsinization step they are GENTLY pipetted up and down 6 - 8 times rather than the vigourous motion usually used to create a single cell suspension. This yields clumps of cells of 4 - 12. 1. Aspirate media from the plate, wash with 5 ml PBS and with 5 ml PBS/EGTA. Aspirate and place plate on 37 °C warming tray. - After 2 - 5 min. remove the flask and checl under the dissecting scope. Individual cells should be apparent in the collonies. - Add 1 ml trypsin/EDTA and rock flask back and forward for ca. 1 min. until the cells lift off the plate. Gently pipette the cells up and down with a 1 ml pipette 6 times and then add 1 ml of ES cell media. Wash gently up and down several times. - Add cells to 2 ml of ES cell media to dilute to an appropriate concentration. **Aggregation** 1. Using a pasteur pipette, place a drop of suspended ES cell clumps in a small petri dish. - Under the dissecting scope and using a very narrow siliconized transfer pipette, select clumps of 5 - 10 cells. Transfer one clump to each well and watch to be sure that it comes to rest adjacent to the embryo. Very carefully return the plate to the incubator once all the embryos and wells are filled. - Our embryos take 24 hours to develop to expanded blastocysts at which point they are transfered into psuedopregnant (C 57 X CBA) F 1 mice using a siliconized, flame polished pipette. **Removal of Expanded Blastocysts from Aggregation Wells** Before attempting to remove expanded blastocysts, make sure that the pipette is wide enough. To remove blasts from wells, fill a transfer pipette with M 16 up to the end of the narrow pulled section then position the end over each well and blow the embryos out. Arrange them in groups of 12 for easy collection during transfer...|$|E
