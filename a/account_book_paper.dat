40|$|What role did seaport {{infrastructure}} and technology {{play in the}} market revolution of 1790 - 1860 ? Ship to Shore: Infrastructure and the Growth of American Seaports, 1790 - 1850 examines the role of maritime {{infrastructure and}} technology on the growth of American seaports during the Antebellum. It seeks to define the role of infrastructure {{as part of the}} larger market revolution prior to the establishment of a comprehensive internal national transportation system. This research addresses the void in the historiography of the market revolution, which tends to focus on the transportation networks of canals, railroads, and turnpikes. Infrastructures and technologies examined by this study include lighthouses, marine observatories, and warehouses. The role of lighthouses is studied through the economic loss of cargoes due to shipwrecks. The role of marine observatories is analyzed through the increased efficiency of seaport operations. Warehouses are assessed through time added value and the expansion of the credit and insurance industries. The study is focused on the New England, Mid-Atlantic, and Chesapeake Bay regions. It draws upon primary sources at the Bostonian Society, the Francis W. Peabody Research Library at the Greater Portland Landmarks, Inc., the G. W. Blunt White Library at Mystic Seaport, the Maine Historical Society, the Maryland Historical Society, the Massachusetts Historical Society, the Newport Historical Society, the Rhode Island Historical Society and the South Carolina Historical Society.

40|$|The {{eighteenth-century}} witnessed {{rapid growth}} in the consumption of exotic goods in Britain; not just the sugar and spice of the title, but also tea, coffee and chocolate. This growth prompted a surge in the ownership of furnishings and equipment for the consumption of these new commodities, including tea tables, kettles and cups, coffee mills and chocolate pots, and sugar bowls. Whilst British manufacturers were soon able to provide many of these durable goods, the consumables themselves remained ‘exotic’ imports. This paper begins by outlining {{the ways in which}} imported groceries were promoted through trade cards. These placed great emphasis on the exotic nature of these goods, situating the consumer in the world economy and portraying them as cosmopolitan. This stands {{in stark contrast to the}} more mundane processes whereby sugar, spices, tea and coffee were actually acquired. Drawing on detailed analysis of probate inventories and shopkeepers’ <b>account</b> <b>books,</b> the <b>paper</b> argues that these goods were widely available and that shopping for them had become an everyday occurrence in the second quarter of the eighteenth century. Rather than constructing an identity as cosmopolitan, the consumption of tea, coffee and sugar was more closely linked to status and sociability...|$|R

Although this kind of documents originally were prepared to register foundations’ incomes and expenditures, they had various information about the period they belonged to. Particularly <b>accounting</b> <b>books</b> for the foundations which were built by Ottoman sultans, their family members or government officials have been more crucial. They were usually managed and audited by state officials, supported {{when they were in}} need, employed people around the government. In other words these kind of Ottoman foundations were not independent from economic, social or political aspects of the Empire. Moreover <b>accounting</b> <b>books</b> could be benefited understanding the foundations’ structure, management, wealth and public services.

40|$|In Europe, {{a number}} of {{countries}} align tax accounts and parent-only accounts, while allowing companies to characterize consolidated profits to capital markets in a different way. Using parent-only (consolidated) accounts as a proxy for tax (<b>book)</b> <b>accounts,</b> this <b>paper</b> analyzes the role of reporting timeliness in inducing book-tax differences (BTD). I argue that users of financial statements require higher timeliness of book income and show that book income records economic news in a timelier manner. Higher timeliness of book income increases (decreases) book income relative to tax income during periods of good (bad) news. The effect of reporting timeliness is economically important as (i) higher BTD are associated with improved investment efficiency, and (ii) a delayed recognition of economic events in tax accounts induces a positive correlation between aggregate BTD and future income tax revenues. These findings have implications for the interpretation of book-tax differences in financial analysis and provide the new explanation for the evolution of the aggregate book-tax differences in the United States over the last years...|$|R
