5|$|The Hampshire Review {{newspaper}} {{occupied the}} building's second floor with its offices <b>and</b> <b>printing</b> plant from 1884 to 1895. John J.

The newspaper continued to operate from {{the second floor of}} the Wirgman Building until 1895, when the Cornwell brothers relocated the Hampshire Review office <b>and</b> <b>printing</b> plant to the first floor of their new brick building on West Main Street. In the newspaper's printing plant on {{the second floor of the}} Wirgman Building, the Hampshire Review was printed by a hand-operated Benjamin Franklin printing press.|$|E

40|$|In this Paper, zone based {{features}} {{are used for}} recognition of handwritten <b>and</b> <b>printed</b> Kannada <b>and</b> English numerals. The handwritten <b>and</b> <b>printed</b> Kannada <b>and</b> English numeral images are normalized into 32 x 32 dimensions. Then normalized images are divided into 64 zones and their pixel densities are used as feature vector. Thus, the dimension of feature vector is 64. The handwritten <b>and</b> <b>printed</b> Kannada <b>and</b> English numerals are tested for classifications on 4, 000 sample images as an experiment and obtained an accuracy of 95. 25 % for KNN classifier and 97. 05 % for SVM classifier for mixed numeral inputs with 2 -Fold cross validation for handwritten <b>and</b> <b>printed</b> Kannada <b>and</b> English numerals. A total of 40 classes {{have been reduced to}} 19 classes pertaining to handwritten <b>and</b> <b>printed</b> Kannada numerals <b>and</b> handwritten <b>and</b> <b>printed</b> English numerals to enable to increase the recognition accuracy. The novelty of the proposed algorithm is thinning free, independent of slant of the characters...|$|R

5|$|Monotype created Bembo {{during a}} period of renewed {{interest}} in the printing of the Italian Renaissance, under the influence of Monotype executive <b>and</b> <b>printing</b> historian Stanley Morison. It followed a previous more faithful revival of Manutius's work, Poliphilus, whose reputation it largely eclipsed. Monotype also created a second, much more eccentric italic for it to the design of calligrapher Alfred Fairbank, which also did not receive the same attention as the normal version of Bembo.|$|E

5|$|Despite {{years of}} heavy promotion, the Deseret {{alphabet}} was never widely adopted. This reluctance was {{partly due to}} prohibitive costs; the project had already cost the early church $20,000, with $6,000 going to Pratt as remuneration for his transcription effort {{and most of the}} rest going to cutting metal type featuring the new alphabet <b>and</b> <b>printing</b> costs. In 1859, Parley P. Pratt estimated that the cost of supplying all Utah Territory schoolchildren with suitable textbooks would cost over US$5,000,000.|$|E
5|$|Ernest Lucas Guest {{was born}} in Grahamstown, Cape Colony (in modern South Africa's Eastern Cape province) on 20 August 1882. Guest's {{grandfather}} had moved the family to South Africa in 1861 from Kidderminster, England, {{where they had been}} involved in the printing business for three generations. His grandfather was appointed manager of the Frontier Times, printed and published in Grahamstown. The family resided there until 1889 when Ernest's father, Herbert Melville Guest, moved them to Klerksdorp, Transvaal, after buying the local newspaper <b>and</b> <b>printing</b> business.|$|E
5|$|Football kit {{has evolved}} {{significantly}} {{since the early}} days of the sport when players typically wore thick cotton shirts, knickerbockers and heavy rigid leather boots. In the twentieth century, boots became lighter and softer, shorts were worn at a shorter length, and advances in clothing manufacture <b>and</b> <b>printing</b> allowed shirts to be made in lighter synthetic fibres with increasingly colourful and complex designs. With the rise of advertising in the 20th century, sponsors' logos began to appear on shirts, and replica strips were made available for fans to purchase, generating significant amounts of revenue for clubs.|$|E

Static (SCOF) and kinetic (KCOF) friction coefficients between paper and paper, paper <b>and</b> <b>prints,</b> <b>prints</b> <b>and</b> <b>prints</b> have been determined. Friction properties have been discovered to be different in flexographic <b>and</b> laser <b>prints.</b> The dependence of SCOF and KCOF on pressure (both decrease) together with roughness measurements enables {{to conclude that the}} friction of prints is mainly governed by adhesion forces...|$|R
