25|$|Many {{countries}} have passed safety standards limiting {{the types of}} toys that can be sold. Most of these seek to limit potential hazards, such as choking or fire hazards that could cause injury. Children, especially very small ones, often put toys into their mouths, so the materials {{used to make a}} toy are regulated to prevent poisoning. Materials are also regulated to prevent fire hazards. Children have not yet learned to judge what is safe and what is dangerous, and parents do not <b>always</b> <b>think</b> of all possible situations, so such warnings and regulations are important on toys.|$|E
25|$|Examples of {{children}} raised under the Kibbutz system of equality are given by Yosef Criden. When an aunt {{from a nearby}} city comes to visit her niece or nephew and brings a box of chocolate as a present for them, the child will excitedly open it up and eat {{a few of the}} chocolates. Then the child will go over {{to the rest of the}} group and give the rest of the chocolates to their peers. This is the ideology instilled in the children, to value the self but also to <b>always</b> <b>think</b> about others. Another example Yosef gives is that when his son, who was born and raised on a kibbutz, went into the army, he and his fellow bunk mates asked their supervising officer for a box. They wanted to keep the box in the middle of the room and whenever they would get care packages, they would put the items into the box and share them communally. They did not want to be like most of the units of officers from towns and cities, where each officer would hide their packages under their beds.|$|E

Wodehouse commented, [...] "I <b>always</b> <b>think</b> Hugh Walpole's reputation was two thirds publicity. He was always endorsing books and speaking at lunches and so on." [...] On the other hand, Walpole stood out {{as one of the few}} literary figures willing to go into court and give evidence for the defence at the obscenity trial after the novel The Well of Loneliness was published.|$|E

Kelly stated she didn't think Becky would slap other characters, rather opting for punches. She stated: [...] "The script often says, 'Becky slaps Steve' but we {{try to find a}} different way to do it. I <b>always</b> <b>think</b> she wouldn't slap, she would punch" [...] Kelly was behind other violent scenes featuring her character, adding [...] "The slap is too common in soaps".|$|E

The King visited military forces abroad in France in December 1939, North Africa and Malta in June 1943, Normandy in June 1944, southern Italy in July 1944, and the Low Countries in October 1944. Their high public profile and apparently indefatigable determination secured their place {{as symbols of}} national resistance. At a social function in 1944, Chief of the Imperial General Staff Sir Alan Brooke, revealed that every time he met Field Marshal Bernard Montgomery he thought Montgomery was after his job. The King replied: [...] "You should worry, when I meet him, I <b>always</b> <b>think</b> he's after mine!" ...|$|E
500|$|Harry and the Potters couple their rough-edged {{music with}} themed lyrics, which define the band {{as much as}} the costumes. The straight-forward but quirky {{presentation}} of adolescent concerns and direness in the simplest of worries gives the songs their easy likeability. They poke fun at awkward situations from the books. For example, in the song [...] "The Human Hosepipe", they sing, [...] "Maybe you shouldn't have brought up Cedric Diggory/ Because I'd rather not talk about your dead ex-boyfriends over coffee." [...] Two other examples of the bands distinctive take on teenage angst are seen in the song [...] "Save Ginny Weasley" [...] where they sing, [...] "Are you petrified of being petrified?" [...] and the song [...] "The Godfather." [...] where the gothic or mock-morbid line [...] "Why do I <b>always</b> <b>think</b> that I am going to die?" [...] is sung to an up-beat tune.|$|E

Len Hutton, another who was coached by Hirst, wrote [...] "I shall <b>always</b> <b>think</b> of George Hirst as the ideal coach. He was a 'natural' one, the guide, the philosopher, and friend of every young fellow who has had a trial under him". Part of Hirst's success at Eton came from his personality and ability to extract the best from people. Bowes noted how his enthusiasm inspired young players, and his humour and kindness led boys to worship him. He could pass on technical knowledge {{in a way that was}} easy to comprehend, backed up with anecdotes to illustrate his point. Bowes described how [...] "he had a rare skill in noting and demonstrating your faults and no less skill in illustrating the remedies".|$|E
500|$|The group {{wrote and}} {{performed}} children's music {{that was different}} from {{what had been done}} previously; as Cook stated, [...] "we didn't just go down the route of what people think is kids' music". [...] They were not tied to one style or genre of music and often experimented in the studio; while some of their recordings were orchestral, others had a more live feel. The group was aware that their songs were often children's first exposure to music. Guitar Magazine speculated that since Cook {{was one of the first}} guitarists children were exposed to, he may be the most influential guitarist in the world. [...] Cook was conscious that he was probably the first guitarist children would see, and said, [...] "I <b>always</b> <b>think</b> that if it inspires kids to play guitar later on that would be great. I think it would be really nice if in 15years I read that somebody got into guitar playing because of [...] Wiggles". [...] In 2013, after Cook retired from touring with the group and became their touring manager, he reported that newer bands like Regular John approached him and said that The Wiggles were the first band [...] "they got into".|$|E
500|$|On May 18, 2011, 4s {{release date}} in the United States was {{confirmed}} on to be June 28. On June 7, the album was leaked onto the Internet in full; Beyoncé's legal representatives issued warnings to infringing websites and leaked tracks were soon removed from such sites. On June 9, Beyoncé responded to the leak through Facebook, commenting, [...] "My music was leaked and while {{this is not how}} I wanted to present my new songs, I appreciate the positive response from my fans. When I record music I <b>always</b> <b>think</b> about my fans singing every note and dancing to every beat. I make music to make people happy and I appreciate that everyone has been so anxious to hear my new songs." [...] Following the leak, reports circulated that Columbia Records executives hoped to cover their assets in fear that the album may be a commercial failure. Rumors had suggested that the label requested from Beyoncé to make changes to the record and reunite Destiny's Child, claims Columbia denied. In August 2013, NME reported that Sony Music were suing a 47-year-old man from Gothenburg for US$233,000 concerning the leak of 4. The deluxe version was released simultaneously with the standard edition in several countries. In the United States, it was available exclusively through Target stores.|$|E

500|$|Although Paul {{changed his}} ways to an extent, he still {{shows signs of}} being evil. Dennis has stated that he and fellow cast member, Alan Fletcher (Karl Kennedy) {{purposely}} portray hints of his former self. Of this Dennis stated: [...] "I like to keep that boiling under the surface so that the audience will <b>always</b> <b>think</b> 'what is he up to next?'. You never quite know if he will burst out into Mr. Evil or stay as the character {{he is at the}} moment. Alan Fletcher keeps it alive as well, by always looking out {{the corner of his eye}} and thinking 'I just don't trust you!'" [...] Dennis later defended his character to the Birmingham Post after he was branded an evil character, describing him in his early years: [...] "Paul started out as a university student, which people have forgotten, he was studying engineering then, much to his father's disgust, left to join an airline and became a trolley dolly. He later became a bit of a cad but I wouldn't call him a villain. I'd describe him as a bad boy with a conscience". Dennis has also stated that he loves playing Paul as a [...] "baddie", because in his opinion he is so colourful, not just an average bad guy, adding: [...] "He's not just a black and white bad guy, he's a sneaky bastard. He's the smiling baddie".|$|E
500|$|According to American critic Robert Christgau, Maxinquayes groove-oriented and low-tempo music drew {{not only}} on dub but also on lo-fi, ambient techno, and hip hop, while James Hunter from Rolling Stone said Tricky subsumed American hip hop, soul, reggae, and 1980s English rock sounds into [...] "a mercurial style of dance music". Entertainment Weekly critic David Browne {{classified}} the music as an intellectual form of R. Ben Walsh of The Independent called it an experimental album featuring a [...] "heady blend" [...] of soul, rock, punk, hip hop, dub, and electronica. In Tricky's own words, he composed his songs based on a particular sound he liked rather than having a definite song structure in mind: [...] "I couldn't write you a blues track or a hip-hop track if you asked. I just make what I hear and then me and Martina sing all the words on paper, putting {{the emphasis on the}} things that perhaps shouldn't be sung." [...] Tricky had no concept of pitch, regard for notational conventions and time signatures, or previous experience with sampling, but his approach for Maxinquaye challenged Saunders to rethink his ideas about music production and experiment in ways he had never tried before. Saunders recalled being asked to combine samples of two songs that were 30 beats per minute apart and composed in entirely different keys: [...] " [...] thought differently to anybody I've ever known ... It didn't occur to me that by de-tuning one to slow it down, both might then gel musically at that point. I <b>always</b> <b>think</b> of it like going into a scrapyard and building a car out of all the bits you can find. You could probably build a car that would work, and although it might be the ugliest you've ever seen, it would have loads of character." ...|$|E
500|$|After slaking their thirst from {{a nearby}} stream, the crew {{unloaded}} the James Caird and spent the first night on South Georgia in a cave. The next day, Shackleton announced his intention to walk overland to the Norwegian whaling station at Stromness Bay, {{on the other side}} of the island. The crew were too exhausted, and the James Caird too battered, for Shackleton to consider sailing around the island. [...] The trek to Stromness Bay was [...] and after resting for several days, he, along with Worsley and Tom Crean, set out on 19 May. The interior of South Georgia was mountainous and covered with glaciers. Their map of South Georgia showed only the coastline, and on several occasions, they were forced to backtrack when their route was found to be impassable. After a non-stop trek of 36 hours, the trio reached Stromness Bay and were taken to the manager of the whaling station. He was unable to recognise Shackleton, whom he had met during the expedition's stopover on the island nearly two years previously. [...] After a hot bath and a large meal, Worsley set out on a whaler to collect the three men left behind at King Haakon Bay. That night a strong blizzard struck the island. Had it developed while Worsley and the others were on their trek, it would have likely killed them. [...] They were fortunate the weather had been relatively good for their trek across the island. Later, all three trekkers would talk of a [...] "fourth presence" [...] that accompanied them. [...] In his account of the walk, Worsley would write [...] "...I again find myself counting our party—Shackleton, Crean, and I and—who was the other? Of course, there were only three, but it is strange that in mentally reviewing the crossing we should <b>always</b> <b>think</b> of a fourth, and then correct ourselves." ...|$|E
