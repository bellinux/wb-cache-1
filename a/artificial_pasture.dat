Information on the soil seed banks and the remaining vegetation in these ecosystems is crucial for guiding the restoration efforts. This study examines the size, species richness, diversity, uniformity, and similarity of soil seed banks and aboveground vegetation in 6 different grazing lands including coastal pasture, reseeded pasture, <b>artificial</b> <b>pasture,</b> lowland shrubland, ungrazed pasture, and hillside shrubland. Forty-eight soil samples were taken by cores with a diameter and depth of 10 cm from each of grazing lands in August of 2007. A vegetation survey was conducted using a 0. 5 x 0. 5 -m quadrant in both the spring and fall. Eighty species were observed in soil seed banks and aboveground vegetation. The largest seed bank was observed in reseeded pasture (7, 715 seed/m 2), while the smallest seed bank was found in coastal pasture (2, 755 seed/m 2). Coastal pasture also possessed {{the least amount of}} aboveground vegetation (131 plants/m 2). The most aboveground vegetation was found in ungrazed pasture (155 plants/m 2). The most common species in seed banks were annual and perennial grasses in reseeded pasture, annual forbs in <b>artificial</b> <b>pasture</b> and hillside shrubland, and perennial forbs in low shrubland and ungrazed pasture. Species richness, diversity, and uniformity in seed banks were highest in lowland shrubland and lowest in <b>artificial</b> <b>pasture.</b> The seed bank and aboveground vegetation were similar in ungrazed pasture, coastal pasture, reseeded pasture, low shrubland, hillside shrubland and <b>artificial</b> <b>pasture.</b> Shrublands {{play an important role in}} species richness and the number of germinated seeds from seed banks of grazing lands in southern Marmara.

Some promising legumes in this environment (Medicago sativa, Lotus corniculatus, Trifolium resupinatum) and some grasses (Bromus inermis, Dactylis glomerata, Festuca arundinace, Arrhenatherum elatius) as well as Sanguisorba minor were sown as a mixture. Stand yield characteristics and crop performances of sward were tested for 7 yrs under cattle grazing. The results indicated the adverse effects of Mediterranean climate {{and to some extent}} grazing on yield and cover characteristics of some mixture crop material, particularly T. resupinatum, B. inermis and D. glomerata. On the contrary, F. arundinacea, M. sativa, A. elatius and L. corniculatus displayed higher contributions to total yield. The most crucial handicap of the Turkish animal husbandry sector is to provide cheap and high quality roughage to farms. Since the roughage costs are generally 70 % of expenditure in animal production, there is an urgent need to improve grasslands. Remembering the Mediterranean conditions of Western Turkey which allows favourable crop growth, it must be emphasized that any attempt to benefit from alternatives of new forage crop introductions is of vital significance. <b>Artificial</b> <b>pasture</b> (rotation pasture) establishments under field conditions in the area may be one of those attempts to promote roughage production. It should be also emphasized that number of alternative warm or cool season grasses productive and persistent under Mediterranean climate are quite limited compared to humid continental climates.

40|$|ABSTRACT Barn and cage-fed {{chickens}} {{have presented}} several problems, {{such as high}} rates of infectious disease and consequent antibiotic abuse, poorer chicken health and welfare, and often poorer meat and egg quality compared with free-range chickens. The poultry agroforestry system is becoming increasingly popular in many poultry farms nowadays. In this study, to evaluate the contribution of poultry agroforestry system to enhance some meat and egg traits of Beijing-you chickens, some indexes of meat and egg qualities, some indexes of slaughter traits, and the feed conversion efficiency were investigated in rotational grazing Beijing-you chickens on chicory (Cichorium intybus L.) pasture (CGRG group) and only free-ranging chickens on bare land without forage (control group) in chestnut forest. Results showed that the live body weight, the dressing weight, the thigh muscle weight, and the breast muscle weight were increased (p< 0. 05) based on the decrease of 15 % feed concentration in the CGRG group relative to the control. Furthermore, compared with the control, the crude ash, the essential amino acid content, and the inosinic acid content were increased (p< 0. 05), and the crude fat contents were decreased (p< 0. 05) in the thigh and breast muscles, while the yolk cholesterol and the feed conversion ratio were significantly decreased (p< 0. 05) in the CGRG group.

Therefore, in situ measurements of atmospheric CH 4 consumption were conducted in four landuse types: natural alpine meadow (NM), Elymus nutans pasture (EP), herbaceous meadow in shrub (HS), and a P. fruticosa shrub meadow (PS) within two years. CH 4 fluxes were measured using static chambers and gas chromatography. All four types of land use showed atmospheric CH 4 sink throughout the two years, with mean soil CH 4 consumption rates at 24. 6 +/- 10. 9, 33. 8 +/- 15. 0, 39. 8 +/- 10. 3, and 28. 1 +/- 12. 1 mu g CH 4. m(- 2). hr(- 1) for NM, EP, PS, and HS, respectively. Soil CH 4 consumption increased by 40 % by reclamation from NM to EP, while it decreased by 30 % by degradation from PS to HS. Soil CH 4 consumption in four types of land use was significantly correlated with temperature at 5 cm depth (P< 0. 01) and the soil water-filled pore space (WFPS) (P< 0. 05).

An {{improved}} {{understanding of}} changes in carbon storage of terrestrial ecosystems {{is very important for}} assessing the impacts of increasing atmospheric CO 2 concentration and climate change on the terrestrial biosphere. Accurately predicting terrestrial carbon (C) storage requires understanding the carbon stock, because it helps us understand how ecosystems would respond to natural and anthropogenic disturbances under different management strategies. We investigated organic C storage in aboveground biomass, litter, roots, and soil organic matter (SOM) in five land-use types (i. e. <b>artificial</b> <b>pasture,</b> AP; natural meadow, NM; corn plantation, CP; temperate savanna, TS; and bush wood, BW) in meadow steppe of Northeast China. The primary objective {{of this study was to}} ascertain the impact of different land-use types on the carbon stock. The total C storage (including C stored in aboveground biomass, litter, roots, and 0 – 100 -cm soil layers) did not significantly differ between one and another type among the five pairs (P> 0. 05), with the exception of AP 2 -BW pair. The total C storage changes in value varying from 5958. 09 g C m- 2 for plot NM 2 to 11922. 87 g C m- 2 for plot CP 1.

40|$|It {{has been}} long {{recognized}} that the environment has {{an important role to}} play in the regulation of the mammalian reproductive function. Environmental cues, such as changing day-light or increase temperature, are know to trigger off growth or regression of the reproductive organs in a whole variety of species and nutrition and stress can influence the onset of breeding and affect the fertility. Although the domestic buffalo (Bubalus bubalis) has been since long time considered as a short-day-breeder polyestral seasonal animal, indeed in the tropical areas near of equator line they are polyestral continuous. It would seem that photoperiod has a marked influence in buffalo reproduction in determinate areas of the world, however in some tropical areas like in Brazil, mainly in the Amazon valley and areas nearest of the equator the light seems to have a minimal effect or no effect on the reproductive cues however the nutrition and heat stress measured throughout temperature/ humidity indexes (THI) {{play an important role in}} the reproductive functions of buffaloes and it is suggested that THI > 75 has a negative effect on reproductive performances of buffaloes. The calving season is regulated by the availability of native pasture in the floodplain or in areas of <b>artificial</b> <b>pasture</b> On the other hand when buffaloes are raised in the southwest and southern regions (parallels 14 to 33 South) they show a typical seasonal pattern when the calving season are concentrated between de February to July. The body condition score (BCS) seems to affect directly the fertility of female buffaloes since females that calve with a BCS < 2. 5 show delayed postpartum ovulation, weak estrus symptoms and more service per conception rate. Seasonal anestrus is a normal phenomenon in the out breeding season that occur in areas near, upon or down of the Cancer and Capricorn lines, respectively, however the anoestrus can be overcame by the use of hormone to synchronize heat and ovulation. Buffaloes are quite resistant to the cold weather but protection must also be provided as well as in the tropical areas where shade, water access and good management increase the fertility rates...|$|E
40|$|This {{thesis is}} about the {{dynamics}} of eastern grey kangaroo (Macropus giganteus) populations and their food supplies in temperate grasslands of south-eastern Australia. It {{is based on the}} study of three populations of eastern grey kangaroos inhabiting 'warm dry', 'cold dry', and 'warm wet' sites within the Southern Tablelands climatic region. After a pilot survey and methods trial in early 2001, the main period of study was from August 2001 to July 2003. The study populations were found to have the highest densities of any kangaroo populations, 450 to 510 km- 2. Their density was the same {{at the end of the}} two year study period as at the beginning, in spite of a strong decline in herbage availability due to drought. The eastern grey kangaroo populations were limited according to the predation-sensitive food hypothesis. Fecundity, as the observed proportion of females with late pouch young in spring, was high, in spite of the high kangaroo density and restricted food availability. Age-specific fecundity of a kangaroo sample shot on one of the sites in 1997 to avert starvation was the highest reported for kangaroos. Thus, limitation acted through mortality rather than fecundity. Population growth rate was most sensitive to adult survival but the demographic rate that had the greatest effect in practice was mortality of juveniles, most likely sub-adults. The combination of high fecundity with high mortality of immatures would provide resilience to low levels of imposed mortality and to fertility control. The normal pattern of spring pasture growth was not observed in the drought conditions and few of the recorded increments of growth were of the magnitude considered typical for sites on the southern and central tablelands. Temperature was necessary to predict pasture growth, as well as rainfall, over the previous two months. The best model of pasture growth (lowest AICc) included negative terms for herbage mass, rainfall over the previous two months, and temperature, and a positive term for the interaction between rainfall and temperature. It accounted for 13 % more of the variation in the data than did the simpler model of the type used by Robertson (1987 a), Caughley (1987) and Choquenot et al. (1998). However this was only 63 % of total variation. Re-evaluation of the model based on measurements of pasture growth in more typical (non-drought) conditions is recommended. Grazing had a powerful influence on the biomass of pasture due to the high density of kangaroos. This is a marked difference to many other studies of the type which have been conducted in semi-arid environments where rainfall dominates. The offtake of pasture by kangaroos, as estimated on the research sites by the cage method, was linear on herbage mass. It was of greater magnitude than the more exact estimate of the (curved) functional response from grazedowns in high-quality and low-quality pastures. The widespread recognition of three forms of functional response is inadequate. Both the theoretical basis, and supporting data, have been published for domed, inaccessible residue, and power forms as well (Holling 1966; Noy-Meir 1975; Hassell et al. 1976, 1977; Short 1986; Sabelis 1992). Eastern grey kangaroos had approximately the same Type 2 functional response when consuming either a high quality <b>artificial</b> <b>pasture</b> (Phalaris aquatica), or dry native pasture (Themeda australis) in autumn. Their functional response rose more gradually than those published for red kangaroos and western grey kangaroos in the semi-arid rangelands, and did not satiate at the levels of pasture available. This gradual behaviour of the functional response contributes to continuous stability of the consumer-resource system, as opposed to discontinuous stability. The numerical response was estimated using the ratio equation, assuming an intrinsic rate of increase for eastern grey kangaroos in temperate grasslands of 0. 55. There is indirect evidence of effects of predation in the dynamics of the kangaroo populations. This is demonstrated by the positive relationship between r and kangaroo density. Such a relationship can be generated by predation. A desirable future task is to compile estimates of population growth rate and simultaneous estimates of pasture, in the absence of predation, where kangaroo population density is changing, so that the numerical response can be estimated empirically. The management implications arising from this study are numerous and a full account would require a separate report. As one example, kangaroos in these temperate grasslands are on average smaller, eat less, are more numerous, and are more fecund, than would be predicted from other studies (e. g. Caughley et al. 1987). Thus the benefit of shooting each kangaroo, in terms of grass production, is less, or, in other words, more kangaroos have to be shot to achieve a certain level of impact reduction, and the population will recover more quickly, than would have been predicted prior to this study. Secondly, of much importance to managers, the interactive model which can readily be assembled from the products of Chapters 4, 5 and 8, can be used to test a range of management options, and the effect of variation in weather conditions, such as increased or decreased rainfall. For example, the model indicates that commercial harvesting (currently under trial in the region), at the maximum level allowed, results in a sustainable harvest of kangaroos, but does not increase the herbage mass, and only slightly reduces the frequency of crashes when herbage mass falls to low levels. (To demonstrate this with an ecological experiment would require an extremely large investment of research effort.) However, an alternative 'national park damage mitigation' formula, which holds kangaroo density to about 1 ha- 1, is predicted to increase herbage mass considerably and to reduce the frequency of crashes in herbage mass, but these effects would be achieved at the cost of having to shoot large numbers of kangaroos. Thus, aside from many specific details of kangaroo ecology, the knowledge gained in this study appears to have useful potential to illustrate to managers the dynamic properties of a resource-consumer system, the probabilistic nature of management outcomes, and the consequences of particular kangaroo management proposals...|$|E
40|$|In recent decades, cattle ranchers of the Pantanal of Mato Grosso, Brazil, {{have pointed}} to the {{accelerated}} spread of several herbaceous and woody plant species that invade natural and <b>artificial</b> <b>pastures</b> (campos).

40|$|The use of intravaginal devices with {{progestin}} as {{protocol for}} synchronization of oestrus cycle for fixed time artificial insemination (FTAI) through “Pregna Heat - E'' protocol {{were used in}} 219 cows and 169 female buffaloes, belonging to six commercial farms located in the Tachira, Carabobo, and Portuguesa states, in the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela with the aim to evaluate conception rates (CR) in beef cows and crossbred dairy cattle, milk buffalo and crossbred dairy cows, and crossbred beef and milk heifer {{as well as in}} milk buffalo heifers as well as, with the objective to evaluate several variables that can interfere with CR such as body condition score (BCS), number of births, birth interval treatment, degree of difficulty for AI in the farms in the Farm 1, whereas in other farms were evaluated only the CR. The farms adopted a semi-intensive management, with a diet based primarily on forage species introduced in a <b>artificial</b> <b>pasture</b> used in a rotational grazing system with supplementation on the field depending on the needs of each production system. On a Farm 1, located just south of Lake Maracaibo, Tachira State, were synchronized and subjected to FTAI, 22 crossbred dairy cattle heifers, 20 crossbred dairy cows in the postpartum period (PPP) and 18 crossbred buffalo dairy heifers inseminated when 27. 2 %, 30 % and 0 (zero) CR were obtained; moreover in 24 buffalo cows in the PPP synchronized in the outbreeding season (February 2011), it was obtained a CR of 20. 8 %. For the Farm 2, located in the southern state Tachira, FTAI was performed in favorable season (November 2010) in 78 crossbred dairy buffalo cows in PPP it was obtaining a CR of 34. 6 %. In the case of Farm 3, located in Urama county in Carabobo State, 49 crossbred buffalo cows in the PPP, were subjected to FTAI when it was obtaining a CR of 42. 8 %; in Farm 4, located in Santa Ana county, Tachira state, 85 crossbred dairy cattle cows were used for FTAI with 40 % CR obtained, whereas in Farm 5, located in Portuguesa state, 23 crossbred beef cows of dual purpose in PPP were subjected to FTAI and it was found 47. 8 % CR; finally in the Farm 6 located in Portuguesa State 20 crossbred beef heifers and 49 crossbred beef cow, were subjected to FTAI were found a CR of 55 and 48. 8 %, respectively. Also on Farm 1 were compared variables such as CR and number of births, when it was clear demonstrated that CR in pluriparous beef cows with more than four parturitions the results obtained where quite higher when confronted with cows with 2 - 3 parturitions and primiparous (40. 5 ≥ 4 births, 28. 5 % 2 - 3 births and 0 % for primiparous), (P = 0. 4130); when compared with CR and parturition interval and the use of FTAI protocol “Pregna Heat - E'', the CR is higher in cows between 60 and 200 days postpartum, than cows with the interval of more than 200 days, which showed a very low CR (9. 0 %) (P = 0. 0241); regarding to ECC no significant statistical difference important were observed among females with BSC= 3 submitted to FTAI when confronted to animals with higher BCS. In the case of Farm 3, located in Urama county in Carabobo State, 49 crossbred buffalo cows in the PPP, were subjected to FTAI obtaining a CR of 42. 8 %, whereas in Farm 4, located in Santa Ana county, Táchira state, 85 crossbred dairy cattle cows was used for FTAI, 40 % CR obtained, and in Farm 5, located in Portuguesa state, where 23 crossbred beef cows of dual purpose in PPP subjected to FTAI, it was found 47. 8 % CR; finally in the Farm 6 located in Portuguesa State 20 crossbred beef heifers and 49 crossbred beef cow, were subjected to FTAI when was found a CR of 55 and 48. 8 %, respectively. Still in the Farm 1 were compared variables such as CR and number of births, when it was clear demonstrated that CR in pluriparous beef cows with more than four parturitions where quite higher when confronted with cows with 2 - 3 parturitions and primiparous (40. 5 ≥ 4 births, 28. 5 % 2 - 3 births and 0 % for primiparous), (P = 0. 4130); when compared with CR and parturition interval and the use of FTAI protocol “Heat-pregna - E'' the CR is higher in cows between 60 and 200 days postpartum, than cows with the interval of more than 200 days, which showed a very low CR (9. 0 %) (P = 0. 0241); regarding to ECC no significant statistical difference important were observed among females with BSC= 3 submitted to FTAI when confronted to animals with higher BCS showing a very poor (P= 0. 1632). With reference to the degree of difficulty for AI, animals with 0 degree of difficulty for AI, presenting the highest conception rates compared to the animals of 1 degree (44. 4 and 31. 2 %), respectively. The use of the protocol “Pregna Heat - E” for FTAI, can be recommended for both in cattle and buffaloes with satisfactory results, however the CR in the case of crossbred Bos taurus or crossed animals with more blood of this sub-species probably due the fact that are raised in hot and humid regions {{as in the case of}} Farm 1, it has been observed a decrease in CR, which can be attributed to environmental factors interfering negatively on this variable. Likewise it is important to note that female buffaloes must be synchronized at the favorable season, not in outbreeding season, since throughout this time there was a decrease in CR in buffaloes submitted to FTAI, 20. 8 vs 34. 6 % and 42. 8 %, respectively. In the case of the use of synchronization protocols such as “Pregna Heat – E” for FTAI use in buffalo heifers in the present study showed to be inadequate, with zero of CR, probably due anatomical and physiological concerned to the reproductive tract (very small cervix), thus buffalo heifers should not be included in FTAI programs with conventional techniques. The protocol ''Pregna Heat - E” can be used as a viable tool for oestrus cycle synchronization and FTAI in both cattle and buffaloes, and in the present study with the bovine CR being higher than in buffaloes (40. 1 vs 31, 9 %) (Fisher = 0. 9624, P = 0. 0212, P < 0. 05). That being so the use of “Pregna Heat - E” protocol as was used in the present study needs to be further studied in buffalo to obtain higher conception rates. CAPES - Coordenação de Aperfeiçoamento de Pessoal de Nível SuperiorCNPq - Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Científico e TecnológicoA utilização de dispositivos intravaginais com progestágeno como o protocolo de sincronização do ciclo estral para inseminação artificial em tempo fixo (IATF) “Pregna Heat-E,” foi utilizado em 219 fêmeas bovinas e 169 fêmeas bubalinas, pertencentes a 6 fazendas comerciais localizadas nos estados Táchira, Carabobo, e Portuguesa, na República Bolivariana da Venezuela com o objetivo de avaliar a taxa de concepção (TC) em vacas bovinas mestiças leiteiras, de corte e vacas bubalinas mestiças leiteiras, assim como em novilhas bovinas mestiças de leite e corte e novilhas bubalinas mestiças leiteiras, e de analisar algumas variáveis que podem interferir na TC, tais como o escore de condição corporal, (ECC), número de partos, intervalo parto tratamento, grau de dificuldade para a IA na Fazenda 1, e nas outras fazendas(2, 3, 4, 5 e 6), avaliou-se somente a taxa de concepção. O manejo das fazendas era de tipo semi-intensivo, com a alimentação baseada principalmente em espécies forrageiras introduzidas em sistema de piquetes rotacionados a campo e suplementação dependendo das necessidades de cada sistema de produção. Na Fazenda 1, localizada no Sul do Lago de Maracaibo, estado Táchira, foram sincronizadas e submetidas a IATF, 22 novilhas bovinas mestiças leiteiras onde foram obtidas TC de 27, 2 %, igualmente foram submetidas a IATF 20 vacas bovinas mestiças leiteiras no período pós parto (PPP) com uma TC de 30 %, enquanto que da mesma forma, 18 novilhas bubalinas mestiças leiteiras foram inseminadas resultando em nenhuma gestação; em 24 vacas bubalinas no (PPP) sincronizadas na época desfavorável (fevereiro, de 2011), foi obtida uma TC de 20, 8 %. Para na Fazenda 2, localizada na zona Sul do Estado Tachira foi praticada a IATF na época favorável (novembro de 2010) em 78 búfalas mestiças leiterias no PPP obtendo-se uma TC de 34, 6 %. No caso da Fazenda 3, localizada em Urama, no Estado Carabobo, foram submetidas a IATF 49 vacas bubalinas mestiças no PPP, obtendo-se uma TC de 42, 8 %; Na Fazenda 4, localizada em Santa Ana, estado Tachira, foi utilizada a IATF, 85 vacas bovinas mestiças leiteiras obtendo-se uma TC de 40 %; Na Fazenda 5, localizada no Estado Portuguesa, foram submetidas a IATF 23 vacas bovinas mestiças de dupla aptidão no PPP, observando-se 47, 8 % de TC; a Fazenda 6 localizada no estado Portuguesa foram submetidas à IATF 20 novilhas mestiças de corte e 49 vacas bovinas mestiças de corte, resultando em uma TC de 55 e 48, 8 % respectivamente. Ademais na Fazenda 1, foram avaliadas variáveis como TC e número de partos, quando ficou demonstrado melhores TC em vacas bovinas pluriparas quando comparadas com primíparas (40, 5 ≥ 4 partos, 28, 5 % de 2 a 3 partos e 0 % para as primiparas), (P= 0. 4130); com relação a TC e o intervalo parto tratamento pode ser observado que as maiores TC são em vacas entre 60 e 200 dias pós–parto, sendo que vacas com intervalo entre o parto e tratamento superior a 200 dias, a TC foi muito baixa (9, 0 %), (P= 0. 0241); com relação a ECC não houve diferença significativa importante pois todos os animais foram sincronizados com ECC maior ou igual a três e a variação entre os animais foi muito reduzida (P= 0. 1632); no tocante a o grau de dificuldade para IA, animais com 0 grau de dificuldade para a IA, apresentaram os maiores índices de concepção (44, 4 e 31, 2 %), respectivamente. A utilização do protocolo para IATF, como o “Pregna Heat-E”, pode ser recomendado tanto em bovinos como em bubalinos com resultados satisfatórios, sendo que as TC no caso de bovinos mestiços com maior sangue Bos taurus, em regiões úmidas quentes como o caso da Fazenda 1, observou-se uma queda na TC, o que se pode atribuir a fatores do meio ambiente interferindo de forma negativa nas TC. Da mesma maneira, é importante salientar que as fêmeas bubalinas devem de ser sincronizadas na época favorável, posto que na época desfavorável ocorreu uma queda nas TC nas fêmeas sincronizadas neste período, (20, 8 % vs 34, 6 e 42, 8 %) respectivamente. No caso da utilização dos protocolos de sincronização pela IATF em novilhas bubalinas, mostrou-se inadequado, com taxas nulas de concepção, provavelmente, por razões anátomo-fisiológicas neste grupo de animais, neste sentido não devem ser incluídas novilhas bubalinas em programas de IATF, com técnicas convencionais. No tocante para o caso das novilhas bovinas o protocolo “Pregna Heat–E” apresenta se como uma alternativa viável, sendo mais eficientes as taxas de concepção em novilhas mestiças de corte quando comparadas com mestiças leiteiras, por ser mais rústicas e melhor adaptadas as condições tropicais do meio ambiente. Os custos do protocolo “Pregna Heat–E” são relativamente similares com outros protocolos com progestagenos, sendo os resultado aceitáveis, podendo este protocolo ser usado junto com outros protocolos de menor custo. O protocolo “Pregna Heat-E” pode ser usado como uma ferramenta viável na sincronização e IATF tanto em bovinos como em bubalinos, sendo que no caso dos bovinos as TC são maiores do que em bubalinos, (40, 1 vs 31, 9 %), (Fisher = 0, 9624; P= 0, 0212, P< 0, 05). Portanto, a utilização do protocolo “Pregna Heat-E”, necessita ser melhor estudado em bubalinos para a obtenção de maiores taxas de concepção. Sendo a taxa de concepção geral tanto em bovinos como em bubalinos de 36, 5 %...|$|E

Here we present the results of a survey on the botanical composition of Alta Murgia pastures, together with the analysis of VOCs (volatile organic compounds) in milk from ewes reared under a typical farm system in the Alta Murgia National Park (Apulia region, southern Italy). Data from two less ordinary farm systems are also reported as external reference. The botanical composition of pastures was estimated by three modified Whittaker plots placed in the prevailing habitat types. Milk samples were analyzed for VOC compounds by head-space SPME/GC-MS. Consumer acceptance of cheese, made from each milk sample using homogeneous traditional cheese-making techniques, was evaluated.

40|$|In {{the last}} decade, {{there has been}} {{increasing}} interest in climate change, pasture degradation and its driving forces, and innovations in nomadic pastoralism on the Tibetan Plateau. However, little is known of indigenous strategies of adaptation to pasture degradation, which limits the effectiveness of adaptation strategies planned by local government. This paper analyzes nomads' strategies of adaptation to pasture degradation {{on the basis of}} a field survey of three townships of Dalag County in the source regions of the Yangtze and Yellow rivers. Pastures there have evidently degraded, with pastures in Wasai mainly in a state of slight or medium degradation and those in Manzhang and Jianshe in a state of medium or severe degradation. With the degradation of pasture, the grazing time is reduced, which affects the livelihoods of nomads. Although the Four-Package Project has commenced in this region, there is still severe fodder shortage in winter and spring. The traditional hay storage strategy does not work because of pasture degradation, and few nomads establish fenced and <b>artificial</b> <b>pastures.</b> Therefore, nomads have employed other strategies, such as renting pasture, providing supplementary feed, and diversifying their livelihoods. Local strategies taken by nomads can provide valuable insights into ecological restoration and livelihood improvement in the region and suggest changes to means promoted by local government. It is necessary to seek new means that combine the best aspects of nomadic pastoralism with modern stockbreeding technologies to help nomads adapt to pasture degeneration and improve their livelihoods...|$|R
40|$|<b>Artificial</b> <b>pastures</b> {{are used}} to {{increase}} carrying capacity in the wet tropics by supplying higher quality forage (energy and protein) to the animals all year long. Sowing pastures is labour-intensive so to be profitable all other possible growth limiting factors, especially minerals, should be alleviated. We studied nutrients intake (energy, protein and minerals) in cattle grazing Urochloa sp. pastures in Western DRC. Three Urochloa ruziziensis and 3 U. decumbens pastures in Kolo-Fuma (Bas-Congo, DRC) were studied. Three Ndama steers and 3 cows grazing each pasture consecutively during the short rainy and dry seasons were followed by handplucking and samples were analysed for energy, crude protein and ash to calculate energy value (fodder units, FU) and digestible crude protein content (DCP) of the diets. NIRS was used on faeces to determine dry matter (DM) intake and ICP-AES to determine mineral content of the diets. Intake levels reached 66 ± 4. 3 g kg- 1 LW 0. 75, nutritive value of forage was 0. 701 ± 0. 036 FU and 4. 78 ± 1. 04 % DCP, allowing daily weight gains > 550 g for steers and > 350 g for cows. P, Ca, Mg, K, Mn & Fe were provided above requirements by the pasture. Na, Cu and Zn were deficient, especially during the short dry season for Cu and Zn. U. ruziziensis pastures tended to provide more minerals, especially during the rainy season. A mineral supplement providing Na, Cu and Zn is required to reach the daily weight gains allowed by energy and protein supplies.

Foram analisadas 7. 526 fichas de diagnóstico de raiva por imunofluorescência direta, de 1976 a 1997. Utilizaram-se os dados dos Censos Agropecuários de Minas Gerais- FIBGE, anos de 1970, 1985 e 1995 - 1996. Empregou-se o método da análise fatorial de componentes principais, com auxílio do programa Minitab versão 9. 0. A raiva bovina apresentou-se mais associada às lavouras permanentes e temporárias, às pastagens naturais e plantadas e ao efetivo bovino, e menos associada às matas naturais e plantadas, às lavouras em descanso e às terras produtivas não utilizadas. Concluiu-se que as transformações antrópicas no espaço agrário, especialmente no uso da terra, influenciaram de modo determinante a distribuição espacial e {{temporal}} da raiva bovina em Minas Gerais.

The grass can also be cut and stored as hay and used as fodder in case of drought. More so, crop residues are rarely sold but are stored to be used {{during the dry season}} or even drought. Previous studies in Ethiopia by Abule et al. (2005), Kamara et al. (2004) and Desta et al.

40|$|To {{understand}} {{the relations between}} land use allocation and water quality preservation within a watershed is essential to assure sustainable development. The land use and land cover (LUC) within Zêzere River watershed registered relevant changes in the last decades. These land use and land cover changes (LUCCs) have impacts in water quality, mainly in surface water degradation caused by surface runoff from artificial and agricultural areas, forest fires and burnt areas, and caused by sewage discharges from agroindustry and urban sprawl. In this context, the impact of LUCCs {{in the quality of}} surface water of the Zêzere watershed is evaluated, considering the changes for different types of LUC and establishing their possible correlations to the most relevant water quality changes. The results indicate that the loss of coniferous forest and the increase of transitional woodland-shrub are related to increased water's pH; while the growth in <b>artificial</b> surfaces and <b>pastures</b> leads mainly to the increase of soluble salts and fecal coliform concentration. These particular findings within the Zêzere watershed, show the relevance of addressing water quality impact driven from land use and should therefore be taken into account within the planning process in order to prevent water stress, namely within watersheds integrating drinking water catchments. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersio...|$|R

O segundo trabalho objetivou estimar par??metros gen??ticos para a resist??ncia mensurada por dois m??todos de avalia????o em bovinos Hereford e Braford, e as correla????es gen??ticas entre a resist??ncia e caracter??sticas de crescimento dos animais. Os bovinos que participaram das avalia????es foram provenientes de rebanhos controlados pelo programa de melhoramento da Conex??o Delta G, localizados no estado do Rio Grande do Sul e criados a campo sobre pastagens naturais e artificiais. Foram avaliados dados de 6. 462 bovinos com idade m??dia de 18 meses, naturalmente infestados, sendo as contagens realizadas na regi??o do entrepernas (ENT) em 3. 413 animais entre 2001 e 2008, e 7. 813 registros de contagens na lateral do corpo (LAT) de 3. 049 bovinos realizadas entre 2009 e 2011. Foram utilizados tamb??m 109. 566 dados de peso ao nascimento (PN), 112. 815 registros de ganho de peso do nascimento ?? desmama (GPD) e 55. 843 dados de ganho da desmama ao sobreano (GDS). Para as an??lises, os dados de contagens sofreram transforma????o logar??tmica. As estimativas de herdabilidade dos m??todos de avalia????o obtidas por an??lise bicaracter??stica foram ENT = 0, 152 ?? 0, 043 e LAT = 0, 235 ?? 0, 063, e a correla????o gen??tica entre ambos foi de 0, 575 ?? 0, 220. A an??lise unicar??ter da LAT apontou uma repetibilidade de 0, 312 ?? 0, 014. As associa????es gen??ticas entre a ENT e a LAT e as caracter??sticas de desenvolvimento avaliadas apontaram associa????es significativas entre ENT e PN (0, 220 ?? 0, 102), e favor??veis correla????es negativas e entre LAT e GPD (- 0, 211 ?? 0, 099) e LAT e GDS (- 0, 650 ?? 0, 125) (P< 0, 05).

The overall aim of {{this study}} was to analyze different perspectives of Rhipicephalus (Boophilus) microplus genetic resistance. Therefore, the present study was divided into three manuscripts. Firstly, a literature review was conducted to present some aspects of tick resistance, like results of previous studies of bovine resistance, environmental effects on this triat, and some findings in molecular biology that will help to identify resistant animals. The second trial was conducted to estimate genetic parameters for tick resistance measured by two assessment methods in Hereford and Braford cattle, and genetic correlations between tick resistance and growth of animals. The animals belonging to the Delta G Connection genetic improvement consortium, were raised on nature and <b>artificial</b> <b>pastures</b> in Southern Brazil, and the age at the evaluation period was about 18 months. Data were analyzed from 6, 462 bovines naturally exposed to ticks. The number of ticks was counted at inner hind legs region (IHL) of 3, 413 animals between 2001 and 2008, and was recorded up to three consecutive counts at one side of body (LAT) in 3, 049 bovines between 2009 and 2010, a total of 7, 813 records. In addition, the database contained data of 109, 566 birth weights (BW), 112, 815 records of weight gain from birth to weaning (ADG) and 54, 843 data of weight gain from weaning to yearling (PWG). For the analyses, tick count data was transformed using a logarithmic function. Heritability estimates obtained by bivariate analysis were IHL = 0. 152 ?? 0. 043 and LAT = 0. 235 ?? 0. 063 and genetic correlation between both methods was 0. 575 ?? 0. 220. Single-trait analysis of LAT indicated a repeatability of 0. 312 ?? 0. 014. Genetics association analysis between IHL and LAT and the development characteristics evaluated indicated significant associations between IHL and BW (0. 220 ?? 0. 102), and favorable negative correlations between LAT and ADG (- 0. 211 ?? 0. 099) and LAT and PWG (- 0. 650 ?? 0. 125) (P< 0. 05). The objective of third trial was to analyze the bovine genetic resistance effect on tick biological traits. The engorged female ticks analyzed were collected from 40 Braford heifers classified as genetically resistant (R) or susceptible (S), according to the breeding values for tick count, calculated based on a database with 9, 036 records of Hereford and Braford bovines. After classification, the selected heifers were moved to an experimental area in Embrapa Pecu??ria Sul, located in the city of Bag??, in the Brazilian state of Rio Grande do Sul, and subjected to four artificial infestations, 14 days apart each one. Weights of engorged female ticks and of female ticks after oviposition did not differ between resistant and susceptible heifers. Female ticks engorged in genetically susceptible heifers showed higher capacity of posture (R = 0. 097 ?? 0. 021 g and S = 0. 109 ?? 0. 030 g) and higher values of reproductive efficiency index (R = 47. 23 ?? 5. 85 % and S = 53. 27 ?? 3. 74 %) The overall {{aim of this}} study was to analyze different perspectives of Rhipicephalus (Boophilus) microplus genetic resistance. Therefore, the present study was divided into three manuscripts. Firstly, a literature review was conducted to present some aspects of tick resistance, like results of previous studies of bovine resistance, environmental effects on this triat, and some findings in molecular biology that will help to identify resistant animals. The second trial was conducted to estimate genetic parameters for tick resistance measured by two assessment methods in Hereford and Braford cattle, and genetic correlations between tick resistance and growth of animals. The animals belonging to the Delta G Connection genetic improvement consortium, were raised on nature and <b>artificial</b> <b>pastures</b> in Southern Brazil, and the age at the evaluation period was about 18 months. Data were analyzed from 6, 462 bovines naturally exposed to ticks. The number of ticks was counted at inner hind legs region (IHL) of 3, 413 animals between 2001 and 2008, and was recorded up to three consecutive counts at one side of body (LAT) in 3, 049 bovines between 2009 and 2010, a total of 7, 813 records. In addition, the database contained data of 109, 566 birth weights (BW), 112, 815 records of weight gain from birth to weaning (ADG) and 54, 843 data of weight gain from weaning to yearling (PWG). For the analyses, tick count data was transformed using a logarithmic function. Heritability estimates obtained by bivariate analysis were IHL = 0. 152 ?? 0. 043 and LAT = 0. 235 ?? 0. 063 and genetic correlation between both methods was 0. 575 ?? 0. 220. Single-trait analysis of LAT indicated a repeatability of 0. 312 ?? 0. 014. Genetics association analysis between IHL and LAT and the development characteristics evaluated indicated significant associations between IHL and BW (0. 220 ?? 0. 102), and favorable negative correlations between LAT and ADG (- 0. 211 ?? 0. 099) and LAT and PWG (- 0. 650 ?? 0. 125) (P< 0. 05).
