Within a wind tunnel test campaign in the European Transonic Windtunnel facility ETW the design was verified at real aircraft flow conditions.

The coefficients found in this research vary with Reynolds Number and are high as compared with those of Eiffel. The effect of interference upon a single cup is to increase the drag and normal force coefficients.

40|$|The aeolian {{mechanics}} of saltating grains on Mars is studied using both an experimental investigation in an <b>atmospheric</b> wind <b>tunnel</b> and numerical {{solutions to the}} equations of motion of a single grain under Martian surface conditions.

40|$|The tests {{described}} in this report constitute a preliminary investigation of airfoil boundary layer control, as {{carried out in the}} <b>atmospheric</b> wind <b>tunnel</b> of the Langley Memorial Aeronautical Laboratory, from February to August, 1927. Tests were made on a U. S. A. 27 airfoil section with various slot shapes and combinations, and at various amounts of pressure or suction on the slots. The lift of airfoils can be increased by removing or by accelerating the boundary layer. Removing the boundary layer by suction is more economical than to accelerate it by jet action. Gauze-covered suction slots apparently give the best results. When not in operation, all suction slots tested had a detrimental effect upon the aerodynamic characteristics of the airfoil which was not apparent with the backward-opening pressure slots. Thick, blunt-nose airfoils would seem to give best results with boundary layer control...|$|R
