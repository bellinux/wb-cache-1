A 380MHz digital trunked TETRA radio communication system from Motorola is used on all lines to carry both voice and data information. For Blue Line Siemens Transportation Systems has supplied the electronic interlocking Sicas, the operation control system Vicos OC 500 and the <b>automation</b> <b>control</b> system LZB 700 M. An integrated system comprising optical fibre cable, on-train radio, CCTV, and a centralised clock and public address system is used for telecommunication during train operations as well as emergencies. For Red and Yellow lines ALSTOM has supplied signalling system and for Green and Violet lines Bombardier Transportation has supplied CITYFLO 350 signalling system.|$|E
