The latter remark attracted as much criticism as <b>anything</b> <b>else</b> <b>in</b> his career.|$|E
5|$|After a {{break on}} the Tuesday evening, the show {{returned}} on Wednesday whilst averaging 4.65m for the first show of the evening, a 21% audience share which was larger than <b>anything</b> <b>else</b> <b>in</b> its timeslot. The second episode broadcast at 9:30pm, with 4.46m, an 18.7% share which was beaten by an episode of BBC One's Who Do You Think You Are? on Emilia Fox which commanded 5.39 million viewers. Ratings continued to decline on the Thursday evening shows, with both shows being viewed by fewer than four million viewers for the first time, 3.81m and 3.86m respectively, seeing the first show being beaten by BBC One's Watchdog which gained 5.23m in the 8pm slot.|$|E
5|$|The sauropods {{were the}} largest and {{heaviest}} dinosaurs. For much of the dinosaur era, the smallest sauropods were larger than <b>anything</b> <b>else</b> <b>in</b> their habitat, and the largest were {{an order of magnitude}} more massive than anything else that has since walked the Earth. Giant prehistoric mammals such as Paraceratherium (the largest land mammal ever) were dwarfed by the giant sauropods, and only modern whales approach or surpass them in size. There are several proposed advantages for the large size of sauropods, including protection from predation, reduction of energy use, and longevity, but {{it may be that the}} most important advantage was dietary. Large animals are more efficient at digestion than small animals, because food spends more time in their digestive systems. This also permits them to subsist on food with lower nutritive value than smaller animals. Sauropod remains are mostly found in rock formations interpreted as dry or seasonally dry, and the ability to eat large quantities of low-nutrient browse would have been advantageous in such environments.|$|E

5|$|While in Asnières Van Gogh painted parks, {{restaurants}} and the Seine, including Bridges across the Seine at Asnières. In November 1887, Theo and Vincent befriended Paul Gauguin {{who had just}} arrived in Paris. Towards {{the end of the}} year, Vincent arranged an exhibition alongside Bernard, Anquetin, and probably Toulouse-Lautrec, at the Grand-Bouillon Restaurant du Chalet, 43 avenue de Clichy, Montmartre. In a contemporary account, Bernard wrote that the exhibition was ahead of <b>anything</b> <b>else</b> <b>in</b> Paris. There Bernard and Anquetin sold their first paintings, and Van Gogh exchanged work with Gauguin. Discussions on art, artists, and their social situations started during this exhibition, continued and expanded to include visitors to the show, like Camille Pissarro and his son Lucien, Signac and Seurat. In February 1888, feeling worn out from life in Paris, Van Gogh left, having painted more than 200 paintings during his two years there. Hours before his departure, accompanied by Theo, he paid his first and only visit to Seurat in his studio.|$|E

More than <b>anything</b> <b>else</b> <b>in</b> the suburb, the Glenunga International High School brings it prominence both in Australia and overseas. The school campus is an easily identifiable part of Glenunga, being situated roughly {{in the middle of the}} suburb itself.

25|$|Some heavy armored {{fighting}} {{vehicles were}} obtained, notably British Cromwell tanks (150 {{provided by the}} United Kingdom) and captured German tanks (44, of which 12 were Panthers). The 12th Regiment of Dragoons received 12 Cavalier tanks among other British equipment in April 1945. In other cases, FFI units used vehicles no longer favored by Allied forces, such as the U.S. M6 Fargo, a light truck with a portee 37mm antitank gun. Finally, civilian vehicles and practically <b>anything</b> <b>else</b> <b>in</b> running condition were pressed into service and used until {{they could no longer}} be maintained.|$|E
25|$|Upon {{completion}} of feeding, the mosquito will withdraw her proboscis, {{and as the}} gut fills up, the stomach lining secretes a peritrophic membrane that surrounds the blood. This membrane keeps the blood separate from <b>anything</b> <b>else</b> <b>in</b> the stomach. However, like certain other insects that survive on dilute, purely liquid diets, notably many of the Hemiptera, many adult mosquitoes must excrete unwanted aqueous fractions even as they feed. (See the photograph of a feeding Anopheles stephensi: Note that the excreted droplet patently is not whole blood, being far more dilute). As {{long as they are}} not disturbed, this permits mosquitoes to continue feeding until they have accumulated a full meal of nutrient solids. As a result, a mosquito replete with blood can continue to absorb sugar, even as the blood meal is slowly digested {{over a period of several}} days. Once blood is in the stomach, the midgut of the female synthesizes proteolytic enzymes that hydrolyze the blood proteins into free amino acids. These are used as building blocks for the synthesis of egg yolk proteins.|$|E

25|$|Membership has {{varied from}} the {{original}} nine banjo players to well over a hundred. It includes both banjo and gut bucket (washtub bass) players plus a Band Auxiliary. From its humble beginnings {{in the basement of}} the Cupertino Music Store, the PBB did not have an official public venue until 1966. Having outgrown the music store, a gentleman by the name of Ward Pinther offered to host the band at his Straw Hat Pizza Palace in Campbell, California. This hospitality lasted for the next 24 years until Pinther's retirement and the closing of the restaurant. Not to be deterred, the band moved to yet another Straw Hat Pizza restaurant in the nearby San Jose neighborhood of Willow Glen. So from 1966 until Tuesday, June 16, 2009, the band entertained crowds every Tuesday evening at a Straw Hat Pizza restaurant. During the band's heyday in the 1970s and 1980s, it was not unusual to have four rows of twenty to twenty five banjo players performing plus as many as eight gutbucket players and a tuba. The sound produced by a hundred or more banjos is unique and unlike <b>anything</b> <b>else</b> <b>in</b> the world of acoustic performances.|$|E

500|$|Because of {{the lack}} of a clerestory, the vault is {{comparatively}} low, being only about half the height of that at Westminster Abbey.

500|$|Running gags and {{recurring}} segments {{were very}} common in the show. The end of every episode was closed with a water tower gag similar to The Simpsons couch gag. Director Rusty Mills and senior producer Tom Ruegger said that recurring segments like the water tower gag and another segment titled [...] "The Wheel of Morality" [...] eased the production of episodes because the same animated scenes could be used more than once (and, {{in the case of}} the Wheel segments, enabled the producers to add a segment in where there was not room for <b>anything</b> <b>else</b> <b>in</b> the episode).|$|E
500|$|Henry Taylor {{was born}} in Hollinwood in Oldham, Lancashire, on 17 March 1885 to James, a coal miner, and Elizabeth Taylor.

Taylor learned to swim in the Hollinwood Canal, and practised in any water body he could find – baths, becks, canals, lakes, etc., {{including}} the Hollinwood Canal and Alexandra Park's boating lake. Austin Rawlinson, who was Taylor's friend and later president of Amateur Swimming Association, recalled that Taylor [...] "loved his swimming more than <b>anything</b> <b>else</b> <b>in</b> life".

Instead of the owls and bats which assail Goya in The Sleep of Reason, Knipe used ravens. The cover was noted by The Guardian writer John Dugdale, in {{an article about the}} marketing aspect of book cover design, as being unique in the current market. He stated that; along with the covers for The Sense of an Ending and The Tiger's Wife; [...] "None of the three looks like <b>anything</b> <b>else</b> <b>in</b> bookshops".|$|E
