60|$|Squiffy was convinced. He {{told himself}} {{that he had never}} really {{believed}} in Peter as a living thing. It stood to reason that there couldn't really be a snake in his room. The window looked out on emptiness. His room was several stories above the ground. There was a stern, set expression on Squiffy's face as he climbed out of bed. It was the expression of a man who is turning over a new leaf, starting a new life. He looked about the room for some implement which would carry out the deed he had to do, and finally pulled out one of the curtain-rods. Using this as a lever, he broke open the topmost of the six cases which stood in the corner. The soft wood cracked and split. Squiffy drew out a straw-covered bottle. For a moment he stood looking at it, as a man might gaze <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>friend</b> on the point of death. Then, with a sudden determination, he went into the bathroom. There was a crash of glass and a gurgling sound.|$|E
6000|$|... "The {{idea that}} Smith is attacking is this. Living in an {{entangled}} civilization, {{we have come}} to think certain things wrong which are not wrong at all. We have come to think outbreak and exuberance, banging and barging, rotting and wrecking, wrong. In themselves they are not merely pardonable; they are unimpeachable. There is nothing wicked about firing a pistol off even <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>friend,</b> so long as you do not mean to hit him and know you won't. It is no more wrong than throwing a pebble at the sea--less, for you do occasionally hit the sea. There is nothing wrong in bashing down a chimney-pot and breaking through a roof, so long as you are not injuring the life or property of other men. It is no more wrong to choose to enter a house from the top than to choose to open a packing-case from the bottom. There is nothing wicked about walking round the world and coming back to your own house; it is no more wicked than walking round the garden and coming back to your own house. And there is nothing wicked about picking up your wife here, there, and everywhere, if, forsaking all others, you keep only to her so long as you both shall live. It is as innocent as playing a game of hide-and-seek in the garden. You associate such acts with blackguardism by a mere snobbish association, as you think there is something vaguely vile about going (or being seen going) into a pawnbroker's or a public-house. You think there is something squalid and commonplace about such a connection. You are mistaken.|$|E
6000|$|Now, {{imagine the}} acreage of several dock-basins crammed, gunwale to gunwale, with brown and umber and ochre and rust-red steam-trawlers, tugs, harbour-boats, and yachts once clean and respectable, now dirty and happy. Throw in fish-steamers, surprise-packets of unknown lines and indescribable junks, sampans, lorchas, catamarans, and General Service stink-pontoons filled with indescribable apparatus, manned by men no dozen of whom seem {{to talk the}} same dialect or wear the same clothes. The mustard-coloured jersey who is {{cleaning}} a six-pounder on a Hull boat clips his words between his teeth and would be happier in Gaelic. The whitish singlet and grey trousers held up by what is obviously his soldier brother's spare regimental belt is pure Lowestoft. The complete blue-serge-and-soot suit passing a wire down a hatch is Glasgow {{as far as you}} can hear him, which is a fair distance, because he wants something done to the other end of the wire, and the flat-faced boy who should be attending to it hails from the remoter Hebrides, and is looking at a girl on the dock-edge. The bow-legged man in the ulster and green-worsted comforter is a warm Grimsby skipper, worth several thousands. He and his crew, who are mostly his own relations, keep themselves to themselves, and save their money. The pirate with the red beard, barking over the rail <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>friend</b> with gold earrings, comes from Skye. The friend is West Country. The noticeably insignificant man with the soft and deprecating eye is skipper and part-owner of the big slashing Iceland trawler on which he droops like a flower. She is built to almost Western Ocean lines, carries a little boat-deck aft with tremendous stanchions, has a nose cocked high against ice and sweeping seas, and resembles a hawk-moth at rest. The small, sniffing man is reported to be a [...] "holy terror at sea." ...|$|E

50|$|He {{was one of}} {{the group}} that briefly seized the reins of power on 31 October and for his share in that {{outbreak}} he was again condemned to death in absentia on 9 March of the following year. On 17 March, Adolphe Thiers, aware of the threat represented by Blanqui, took advantage of his resting <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>friend</b> physician's place, in Bretenoux in Lot, and had him arrested. A few days afterwards the insurrection which established the Paris Commune broke out, and Blanqui was elected president of the insurgent commune. The Communards offered to release all of their prisoners if the Thiers government released Blanqui, but their offer was met with refusal, and Blanqui was thus prevented from taking an active part. Karl Marx would later be convinced that Blanqui was the leader that was missed by the Commune. Nevertheless, in 1872 he was condemned along with {{the other members of the}} Commune to transportation; on account of his broken health this sentence was again commuted to one of imprisonment. On 20 April 1879 he was elected a deputy for Bordeaux; although the election was pronounced invalid, Blanqui was freed, and immediately resumed his work of agitation.|$|E
5000|$|... "Ritz" [...] {{had already}} been {{recorded}} as a demo in 1972, but was not recorded for The Human Menagerie. During that year, the band's early incarnation had featured Pete Newnham on guitar. This line-up recorded three demos at Riverside Recordings; [...] "Judy Teen", [...] "Ritz" [...] and [...] "That's Alright That's Me". In {{an exclusive interview with}} Newnham for the unofficial fan site Harley Fanzone, he recalled: [...] We made our first demos <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>friend</b> of Steve's studio, Riverside Recordings. [...] "Judy Teen", [...] "Ritz" [...] and [...] "That's Alright That's Me" [...] were the three songs. I had expected to do two guitar tracks, one a rhythm guitar and then a lead overdub for each song - but there was only time for a very rushed guitar take. So, although at the time we all were over the moon with the general result, I wasn't too happy with the guitar. Going back to those demo tracks, they were very clean and untreated, except for a phased drum reverb fadeout on [...] "Ritz" [...] and a bit of echo on John's violin on [...] "Judy Teen". A lot of time was spent getting Steve's vocals to sound right, and they sounded amazing. Anyway, the demo was to play to prospective management rather than record companies." ...|$|E

[...] He released an autobiography and set up a stand-up show that he acted in. Large back taxes and a quarrel with his wife in Linköping made, however, everything burst and Svartenbrandt robbed on 11 January 1996 the nearest post office in Linköping with a toy gun. During the robbery a cashier had recognized him despite his mask. He fled to Germany after the robbery where spent all the money from the robbery in the casino. He made it to the Canary Islands where he let himself be interviewed on the beach but was later arrested by the Spanish police in Playa de las Américas on 23 January 1996 and was taken from the police station to the island's central prison, Tenerife II. He was then transferred to the Spanish central Carabanchel Prison in Madrid where he remained for three months. He was extradited to Sweden in May and sentenced to four years and six months imprisonment.

50|$|He {{tells her}} of a doctor he drove to the airport who is {{confident}} of getting her operated and make her stand again. On Satya's insistence, Mynaa visits the doctor who recommends a full body scan. Mynaa reluctantly obliges to this. The doctor, in a breach of ethics, makes a nude video of her when she is drugged. He threatens her later to submit to his mercy. She however tries to hide this fact from Satya, who finds out the truth when he takes her phone to a repair store. Satya invites the doctor home without the knowledge of Mynaa and politely asks the evil doctor {{to hand over the}} tapes and not publicize the video. The doctor refuses and insists on having his way, this enrages Satya and he manhandles the doctor. But the doctor continues to incite him and Satya breaks down and kills the doctor. He disposes the dead body by cleverly making it look like a car accident. Satya convinces Mynaa to leave for Chennai at once stating he has had a transfer to which she agrees. They meet a different doctor (Suhasini Maniratnam), who has a good track record of curing polio patients. Mynaa agrees to get the operation done. Satya goes to the bank to draw money, but he gets a call from an old friend of Mynaa, Revathi (Malavika Avinsah) who asks him to meet her at the beach. This {{turns out to be a}} trap set by the police and thus he ends up being in custody of ACP Kumar, to whom Satya has been narrating the story. Upon hearing the story, Ashok sympathizes with Satya. It is revealed that there have been many false allegations on Satya, who has only committed one murder. The police officer fights for Satya, trying to convince his brother, a lawyer (Anant Nag), to save the criminal from the false 34 serial murder case. Ashok leaves Satya out of custody as an expression of his faith in Satya who is provided shelter <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>friend</b> of Ashok's.|$|E
40|$|Coordination {{with other}} people is {{a central part of}} human life. Whenever we wave <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>friend,</b> help our {{neighbor}} carry her shopping bag up the stairs, dance tango or talk to one another, we need to take another person’s actions into account and accordingly adapt how we do our part in the interaction. The current thesis aimed at understanding the mechanisms and processes that make joint action possible. Specifically, it targeted joint actions in which two (or more) co-actors intentionally coordinate their actions under narrow real-time constraints. In both theoretical and empirical work, mechanisms and processes that support coordination were identified; these include coordination strategies, integrated motor simulations, and perceptual action coupling. Depending on the context, {{one or more of these}} mechanisms have an impact on interpersonal coordination. Taken together, this thesis demonstrates that joint action is more than just adding the actions of individuals; joint action is based on mechanisms and processes that are often different from those guiding individual behavior...|$|E
