40|$|Data from 5, 817 men and 5, 215 women (age range, 25 - 74 years) {{who participated}} in the Belgian Interuniversity Research on Nutrition and Health were used to {{determine}} prevalences and associated variables of different abnormalities on the resting electrocardiogram. Electrocardiographic abnormalities were coded according to the Minnesota classification system. About one third of the subjects showed one or more abnormalities on their electrocardiogram. Major abnormalities occurred in 7. 3 % of the men and in 4. 6 % of the women. The prevalence of minor abnormalities was twice as high. Minnesota codes 4 (ST abnormalities) and 5 (T wave changes) were found to be the most prevalent in both sexes (9. 6 and 10. 5 % respectively in women and 8. 4 and 9. 1 % respectively in men), while code 2 (QRS axis deviation, 7. 9 %) and code 7 (ventricular conduction defect, 8. 7 %) were quite common in men. Most prevalences were rather log-linearly related with age, except codes 6 (<b>atrioventricular</b> <b>conduction</b> <b>defect)</b> and 9 (miscellaneous items). In the asymptomatic subjects, blood pressure showed the strongest positive correlation with minor ST-T abnormalities in both men and women independent of other factors. Other correlates identified by multivariate analyses were serum potassium, serum phosphor, and serum uric acid levels, as well as the intake of diuretics. However, any major, minor, and ST-T abnormalities were, according to sex, differently related to those correlates. © 1995 Churchill Livingstone. SCOPUS: ar. jinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|E
40|$|Heterozygous {{mutations}} of {{the cardiac}} transcription factor Nkx 2 - 5 cause <b>atrioventricular</b> <b>conduction</b> <b>defects</b> in humans by unknown mechanisms. We show in KO mice {{that the number}} of cells in the cardiac conduction system is directly related to Nkx 2 - 5 gene dosage. Null mutant embryos appear to lack the primordium of the atrioventricular node. In Nkx 2 - 5 haploinsufficiency, the conduction system has half the normal number of cells. In addition, an entire population of connexin 40 –/connexin 45 + cells is missing in the atrioventricular node of Nkx 2 - 5 heterozygous KO mice. Specific functional defects associated with Nkx 2 - 5 loss of function can be attributed to hypoplastic development of the relevant structures in the conduction system. Surprisingly, the cellular expression of connexin 40, the major gap junction isoform of Purkinje fibers and a putative Nkx 2 - 5 target, is unaffected, consistent with normal conduction times through the His-Purkinje system measured in vivo.

40|$|Non-syndromic cardiac {{septation}} defects are common, yet the causative factors {{remain largely}} uncharacterised. Septation defects {{are an integral}} part of many syndromes, some of which are associated with chromosomal alterations. For the majority, the physiopathogenesis is believed to be multi-factorial, hindering the identification of causative factors. Ten mutations in the gene encoding the transcription factor CSX/NKX 2 - 5 have been described in individuals with ASD and/or <b>atrioventricular</b> <b>conduction</b> <b>defects.</b> In addition, several other cardiac abnormalities were observed, yet the mildest forms are reminiscent of non-syndromic septation defects. The CSX/NKX 2 - 5 gene is thus a good candidate for various cardiopathies. We have collected two families with inherited predisposition to cardiac abnormalities. Some members of the families presented ASD and AV block. In both families a novel CSX/NKX 2 - 5 mutation was identified in the homeodomain. Variable expressivity in the phenotype was observed in both families. Importantly, mutation carriers did not present any symptoms at young age. In addition, anomalous venous return, a phenotype not previously associated to CSX/NKX 2 - 5 mutations, was observed in one of the families. We also screened the CSX/NKX 2 - 5 gene in sporadic and familial cases of other cardiopathies.

40|$|Prolapsing {{mitral valve}} {{is a common}} cardiac condition, {{occurring}} in approximately 16 {{million people in the}} United States alone. Primary prolapsing mitral valve may be familial or nonfamilial and may be associated with myxomatous degeneration of the mitral valve leaflets, such as occurs in Marfan syndrome and other connective tissue disorders. Secondary forms may be associated with such entities as rheumatic fever (especially after commissurotomy) and coronary artery disease (in the presence of ruptured chordae tendineae), and with such congenital conditions as interatrial defect and primary cardiomyopathy with outflow tract obstruction. Prolapsing mitral valve is characterized by late systolic murmur, mid-systolic click, or both. Arrhythmias occur in the form of benign premature atrial contraction, premature nodal contraction, and paroxysmal atrial tachycardia. As the patient ages, atrial flutter and atrial fibrillation tend to develop. In some chronic cases, especially those involving atrial fibrillation, systemic emboli may occur. Rare premature ventricular contractions may be largely benign, whereas more frequent premature ventricular contractions may lead to severe arrhythmic complexes such as ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation. With advancing age, <b>atrioventricular</b> <b>conduction</b> <b>defects</b> of varying degrees or sick sinus syndrome may necessitate a pacemaker installation. About one quarter of prolapsing mitral valve cases progress, with increasing mitral insufficiency and increasing enlargement of the left atrium and left ventricle, which at times leads to congestive heart failure.

The survey for the 2015 activity collects information about demographics, clinical characteristics, main indications for PM/ICD therapy and device types from the Italian collaborating centers. Methods: The Registry collects prospectively national PM and ICD implantation {{activity on the}} basis of European cards. Results: PM Registry: data about 24 285 PM implantations were collected (19 194 first implant and 5091 replacements). The number of collaborating centers was 218. Median age of treated patients was 81 years (75 quartile I; 86 quartile III). ECG indications included <b>atrioventricular</b> <b>conduction</b> disorders in 42. 8 % of first PM implants, sick sinus syndrome in 22. 9 %, atrial fibrillation plus bradycardia in 15. 1 %, other in 19. 2 %. Among <b>atrioventricular</b> <b>conduction</b> <b>defects,</b> third-degree <b>atrioventricular</b> block was the most common type (23. 8 % of first implants). Use of single-chamber PMs was reported in 26. 9 % of first implants, of dual-chamber PMs in 63. 4 %, of PMs with cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) in 1. 8 %, and of single lead atrial-synchronized ventricular stimulation (VDD/R PMs) in 7. 9 %. ICD Registry: data about 15 363 ICD implantations were collected (11 453 first implants and 3910 replacements). The number of collaborating centers was 434. Median age of treated patients was 71 years (63 quartile I; 78 quartile III]. Primary prevention indication was reported in 77. 3 % of first implants, secondary prevention in 22. 7 % (cardiac arrest in 8. 0 %). A single-chamber ICD was used in 29. 3 % of first implants, dual-chamber in 34. 6 % and biventricular in 36. 1 %. Conclusions: The PM and ICD Registry appears fundamental for monitoring PM and ICD utilization on a large national scale with rigorous examination of demographics and clinical indications. The PM Registry showed stable electrocardiographic and symptom indications, with an important prevalence of dual-chamber pacing. The use of CRT-PM regards a very limited number of patients.

40|$|Myotonic {{dystrophy}} (DM) is {{the most}} common form of muscular dystrophy and is caused by expansion of a CTG trinucleotide repeat on human chromosome 19. Patients with DM develop <b>atrioventricular</b> <b>conduction</b> disturbances, the principal cardiac manifestation of this disease. The etiology of the pathophysiological changes observed in DM has yet to be resolved. Haploinsufficiency of myotonic dystrophy protein kinase (DMPK), DM locus-associated homeodomain protein (DMAHP) and/or titration of RNA-binding proteins by expanded CUG sequences have been hypothesized to underlie the multi-system defects observed in DM. Using an in vivo murine electrophysiology study, we show that cardiac conduction is exquisitely sensitive to DMPK gene dosage.

MethodsA retrospective review was conducted of hospital records and pacemaker database for ventricular septal defect, atrioventricular canal, and tetralogy of Fallot repairs between 1999 and 2004. A total of 922 patients were identified (atrioventricular canal in 197, tetralogy of Fallot in 222, and ventricular septal defect in 503). Median follow-up was 4. 1 years. ResultsThere were 472 male and 450 female patients, median age 6 months (0 – 444 months) and median weight 5. 8 kg (1. 3 – 116 kg) at surgery. Postoperative <b>atrioventricular</b> <b>conduction</b> block developed in 21 (2. 3 %) of the 922, being transient, with return of conduction 3 days (1 – 14 days) after surgery, in 13 (1. 4 %) and permanent, with pacemakers implanted 10 days (6 – 20 days) after surgery, in 8 (0. 9 %). Of the 905 patients at risk for delayed <b>atrioventricular</b> <b>conduction</b> block, 3 (0. 3 %) had second- or third-degree block at 2, 8, and 16 months after surgery. Two of these 3 had transient postoperative block. For isolated ventricular septal defects, the incidence was 1 (0. 2 %) of 496. There were 8 late deaths at 31 months (7 – 45 months) after surgery. Five had normal conduction at death, but for 3 patients the conduction status at death could not be determined. Including these 3 patients as possible cases of delayed atrioventricular block yields an incidence of 0. 3 % to 0. 7 %.

Here we investigate whether CVMs producing these responses may occupy different rostrocaudal positions within the nucleus ambiguus. Excitation of CVMs was attempted by microinjections of glutamate into the nucleus ambiguus of an arterially perfused preparation in a grid extending over 2 mm in the rostrocaudal plane using the obex as a reference point. Microinjections were paired, one made during pacing to measure changes in <b>atrioventricular</b> <b>conduction</b> (P-R interval) independent of changes in heart rate and the other looking for changes in heart period (P-P interval) un-paced. Although evidence of a differential distribution was found in 7 cases, in the majority (13 / 20), sites producing maximal effects on both variables coincided. Maximal changes in <b>atrioventricular</b> <b>conduction</b> resulted from more rostral sites in 6 cases and from a more caudal site in only one. Overall, the ratio of the change in <b>atrioventricular</b> <b>conduction</b> to the change in heart rate for a given site was significantly greater 1 mm rostral to the obex than {{at either end of the}} test grid.

Patients with aortic valve disease had significantly longer PR, AH, and HV intervals than cardiac patients not having this abnormality. Patients with aortic stenosis had prolonged HV, 52 +/- 6 vs +/- 42 +/- 2 ms (P = 0. 06), whereas patients with chronic aortic regurgitation had prolonged PR, 245 +/- 27 vs 163 +/- 5 ms (P less than 0. 001), and prolonged AH, 178 +/- 30 vs 102 +/- ms (P less than 0. 001).

40|$|OBJECTIVE: Postsurgical {{atrioventricular}} block may complicate {{surgery for}} congenital heart defects and {{is generally considered}} permanent when persisting longer than 14 days after surgery. In this study, we evaluate the occurrence of spontaneous late recovery of <b>atrioventricular</b> <b>conduction</b> in postsurgical chronic atrioventricular block and discuss its clinical implications. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed all cardiac surgical procedures on cardiopulmonary bypass between January 1993 and November 2010 in subjects younger than 18 years. Patients with postsurgical advanced second- or third-degree atrioventricular block persisting longer than 14 days after surgery were included. RESULTS: Of a total of 2850 cardiac surgical procedures on cardiopulmonary bypass, 59 (2. 1 %) were immediately complicated by chronic postsurgical atrioventricular block of advanced second (n =  4) or third degree (n =  55). In another 6 patients (0. 2 %), late occurrence of chronic advanced second- (n =  3) or third-degree (n =  3) atrioventricular block, without signs of any etiology other than previous surgery, was seen 0. 4 to 10 years after surgery (median, 5. 7 years). Late (> 2 weeks) regression to either completely normal <b>atrioventricular</b> <b>conduction</b> or asymptomatic first-degree atrioventricular block occurred 3 weeks to 7 years (median, 3. 1 years) after surgery in 7 (12 %) patients with immediate postsurgical chronic atrioventricular block. CONCLUSIONS: Complete recovery of <b>atrioventricular</b> <b>conduction</b> or regression to asymptomatic first-degree atrioventricular block occurred in 12 % of patients with postsurgical chronic second- or third-degree atrioventricular block.

40|$|The sinus node {{generates the}} {{electrical}} impulse, which spreads rapidly over both atria, {{causing them to}} contract simultaneously. In the normal heart, a layer of connective tissue electrically insulates the atria and ventricles. The only pathway that crosses this plane is the <b>atrioventricular</b> <b>conduction</b> axis, through which the impulse reaches the ventricles. Within the axis, the atrioventricular node delays the impulse, allowing the ventricles to be filled before their contraction is initiated. Moreover, the atrioventricular node protects the ventricles from rapid atrial arrhythmias and may take over pacemaker function when the sinus node fails. In pathological conditions, these complex physiological properties contribute to several types of arrhythmias that originate from the <b>atrioventricular</b> <b>conduction</b> system. One example is atrioventricular block, which requires electronic pacemaker implantation because there is currently no cure for this arrhythmia. Because <b>conduction</b> system <b>defects</b> may arise during embryonic development, the mechanisms of conduction system development have been intensively studied. Nevertheless, its developmental origin, molecular composition, and phenotype have remained fertile subjects of research and debate. Lineage and expressional analyses have indicated that the atrioventricular node develops from a subpopulation of precursor cells in the dorsal part of the embryonic atrioventricular canal. These cells become distinct early in development, are less well differentiated compared to the developing working myocardium, and, {{in addition to their}} cardiogenic gene program, activate and maintain a neurogenic gene progra...|$|R
40|$|<b>Atrioventricular</b> <b>conduction</b> time {{increases}} with age, both due to atrioventricular nodal and His-Purkinje system changes. In the ageing process, structural and cellular electrophysiological changes {{as well as}} altered autonomic drive and negative chronotropic drugs play a role, The clinical differentiation between the atrioventricular node and the His bundle {{as a cause of}} diminished atrioventricular transmission is often relevant with respect to pharmacological and pacing strategies, However, it may appear irrelevant in the elderly in whom the <b>atrioventricular</b> <b>conduction</b> axis is mostly affected more diffusely, especially if underlying heart disease is present. One specific effect of ageing is the emergence of atrioventricular nodal tachycardias, where ageing of the atrioventricular node may set the stage for re-entry. (C) Rapid Science Publishers...|$|R
40|$|A {{patient with}} Wolff-Parkinson-White {{syndrome}} type B developed 2 : 1 atrioventricular block {{resulting from the}} association of persistent right bundle-branch block with tachycardia-dependent (phase 3) left bundle-branch block. Electrophysiological studies disclosed the coexistence of a tachycardia-dependent (phase 3) block in the accessory pathway. This conduction disturbance was exposed, not by carotid sinus massage as in previous studies, but by pacing-induced prolongation of the interval between two consecutively conducted atrial impulses. Furthermore, the surface electrocardiogram showed, at different times, ventricular complexes resulting from: (1) exclusive <b>atrioventricular</b> <b>conduction</b> through the normal pathway without bundle-branch block; (2) predominant, or exclusive, <b>atrioventricular</b> <b>conduction</b> through a right-sided accessory pathway; (3) exclusive <b>atrioventricular</b> <b>conduction</b> through the normal pathway with right bundle-branch block; (4) exclusive conduction through the normal pathway, with left bundle-branch block; (5) fusion between (1) and (2); and finally, (6) fusion between (2) and (3) However, QRS complexes resulting from simultaneously occurring Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome type B and left bundle-branch block could not be identified. Future electrophysiological investigations should re-evaluate the criteria used to diffrentiate between true and false patterns of Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome type B coexisting with left bundle-branch block...|$|R

40|$|His bundle electrograms were {{recorded}} in 2 patients with ectopic beats arising in accessory atrioventricular tracts. Case 1 had Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW) type A and a left-sided Kent tract with a short effective refractory period. Though ectopic impulse formation most probably occurred within the Kent tract itself, a vulnerability-related origin in the ventricular muscle close to the distal end of the Kent tract could not be excluded. In Case 2, with a Mahaim tract extending from His bundle to ventricles, there were three types of QRS morphologies resulting from : (a) <b>atrioventricular</b> <b>conduction</b> exclusively through the normal pathways; (b) <b>atrioventricular</b> <b>conduction</b> through both, normal pathway, and Mahaim tract; and (c) ectopic impulse formation in the Mahim tract.

Complete heart block, Wenckeback block (Mobitz I), and 2 : 1 block were noted proximal and distal to the His bundle. Mobitz II block only occurred distal to the His bundle. Of special interest were the {{high incidence of}} distal conduction abnormalities by His bundle analysis (40 / 80, 50 %), the re-establishment of normal <b>atrioventricular</b> <b>conduction</b> in acutely ill {{patients with}} recent evidence of heart block, and {{the high incidence of}} intraventricular conduction disturbances on standard electrocardiogram (48 / 80, 60 %) ...|$|R
