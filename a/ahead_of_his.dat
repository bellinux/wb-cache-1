5|$|Abovian was far <b>ahead</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> {{time and}} {{virtually}} {{none of his}} works was published during his lifetime. Only after {{the establishment of the}} Armenian SSR was Abovian accorded the recognition and stature he merited. Abovian is {{regarded as one of the}} foremost figures not just in Armenian literature but Armenian history at large. Abovian's influence on Western Armenian literature was not as strong as it was on Eastern Armenian, particularly in its formative years.|$|E
5|$|Brassey {{had other}} ideas which were <b>ahead</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> time. He tried to {{interest}} {{the governments of}} the United Kingdom and Europe in the idea of a tunnel under the English Channel but this came to nothing. He also wanted to build a canal through the Isthmus of Darién (now the Isthmus of Panama) but this idea similarly had no success.|$|E
5|$|Edward IV died in 1483, {{leaving the}} kingdom to his young son, Edward V, but his uncle, Richard, Duke of Gloucester, {{had his own}} ambitions for the throne. Lord Hastings was unwilling to support the {{deposition}} of Edward V and, as a consequence, Richard summarily executed him that June, <b>ahead</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> own coronation. Ashby de la Zouch Castle, only partially completed, and Lord Hastings' other estates were then restored to his widow, Katherine.|$|E

5|$|Going {{into the}} weekend, Lewis Hamilton {{was leading the}} World Drivers' Championship on 252 points, 41 <b>ahead</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> Mercedes {{teammate}} Nico Rosberg. Sebastian Vettel of Ferrari was 8 more points behind on 203, followed by Kimi Räikkönen and Valtteri Bottas on 107 and 101 points respectively. In the World Constructors' Championship, Mercedes was leading Ferrari by 153 points, with Williams an additional 112 points behind in third.|$|E
5|$|Going {{into the}} weekend, Nico Rosberg {{was leading the}} Drivers' Championship with 153 points, eleven <b>ahead</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> {{teammate}} Lewis Hamilton. Ferrari drivers Sebastian Vettel and Kimi Räikkönen were third and fourth respectively, with 96 points each, ahead of Red Bull's Daniel Ricciardo with 88. In the Constructors' Championship standings, Mercedes was in front with 295 points, 103 ahead of Ferrari, with Red Bull Racing following in third with 168 points.|$|E
5|$|He {{was the top}} scorer in Ireland that year, with a {{total of}} 1–38, earning him the inaugural Footballer of the Year title. The fact that Canavan's scoring tally was so far <b>ahead</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> peers on the team led to {{suggestions}} that Tyrone were depending too heavily on him.|$|E

60|$|Surely it {{must have}} been Fate that {{directed}} the Woggle-Bug's steps; for, as he walked disconsolately along, an intuition caused him to raise his eyes, and he saw just <b>ahead</b> <b>of</b> him <b>his</b> affinity--carrying a large clothes-basket.|$|R
5|$|In 1941, Hutson {{became the}} first {{receiver}} to catch 50 passes in a season, doing so while again leading the league in receptions, receiving yards, and touchdowns. He also scored two rushing touchdowns, {{for a total of}} twelve. After the season, he was awarded the Joe F. Carr Trophy as the league's most valuable player. He received six of the nine first place votes, finishing <b>ahead</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> quarterback Cecil Isbell, who received two first place votes.|$|E
5|$|Over {{the course}} of his lifetime, Grinsell {{examined}} and catalogued around 10,000 barrows and advanced the archaeological understanding of such monuments. His use of non-excavatory fieldwork influenced much British archaeology {{in the latter part of}} his 20th century, while his willingness to pay attention to other sources of information, such as folklore and place-names, has been deemed to be <b>ahead</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> time.|$|E
5|$|Strachwitz, {{advancing}} his Panzer III <b>ahead</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> troops, engaged a Soviet supply convoy, destroying a {{large number}} of soft-skinned vehicles and several artillery batteries. Strachwitz was awarded the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross for his part in this action on 25 August 1941. The presentation was made by Hube in the field on 5 September.|$|E
60|$|One windy November day I spied his {{somewhat}} ludicrous figure striding <b>ahead</b> <b>of</b> me, <b>his</b> trousers {{above his}} ankles. I was bundled up {{in a new}} ulster,--of which I was secretly quite proud,--but he wore no overcoat at all.|$|R
50|$|Dewey {{did better}} against Roosevelt {{than any of}} Roosevelt’s {{previous}} three Republican opponents: Roosevelt’s percentage and margin of the total vote were both less than in 1940. Dewey also gained the personal satisfaction <b>of</b> finishing <b>ahead</b> <b>of</b> Roosevelt in <b>his</b> hometown <b>of</b> Hyde Park, New York, and <b>ahead</b> <b>of</b> Truman in <b>his</b> hometown <b>of</b> Independence, Missouri. Dewey would again become the Republican presidential nominee in 1948 and would again lose, though by a slightly smaller margin.|$|R

5|$|The {{practice}} session on Saturday was run without spectators {{to ensure their}} safety. On track, Lewis Hamilton was fastest, <b>ahead</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> closest championship rival Sebastian Vettel. With conditions worsening {{over the course of}} the session, Vettel spun out twice. Max Verstappen ended the session last, while Force India's Nico Hülkenberg was third, ahead of Valtteri Bottas and Sainz.|$|E
5|$|At the Dutch Grand Prix, Rindt {{eventually}} {{used the}} new Lotus 72, better sorted after alterations had been made. He set pole {{position in the}} final practice session, {{almost a quarter of}} a second <b>ahead</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> closest challenger, Stewart. Rindt went on to take his maiden victory in the Lotus 72, {{but it was not a}} joyful occasion for him; on lap 23, his close friend Piers Courage, with whom he had eaten dinner just the night before, died in a fiery crash. Rindt was heavily shaken by the loss of yet another fellow driver and contemplated retirement.|$|E
5|$|Coming {{into the}} race from Monaco two weeks earlier, Lucas di Grassi (Audi Sport ABT) was leading the {{championship}} with 93 points, four <b>ahead</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> compatriot Nelson Piquet, Jr. (NEXTEV TCR). Another six points adrift, third placed Sébastien Buemi (e.dams Renault) was the only driver who scored two victories {{over the course of}} the season, but less consistent outings prevented him from placing higher up in the standings. In the teams' championship, e.dams Renault on 160 points had a 45-point lead over Audi Sport ABT.|$|E
60|$|He {{crossed the}} floor carefully, {{stopping}} often to listen.

50|$|Almond {{was for a}} time highly {{regarded}} by George Marshall, also a VMI graduate, who was Army Chief of Staff during World War II. This regard accounted in part for Almond's promotion to major general <b>ahead</b> <b>of</b> most <b>of</b> <b>his</b> peers and subsequent command of the 92nd Infantry Division, made of almost exclusively African-American soldiers, a position he held from its formation in October 1942 until August 1945. He led the division in combat in the Italian campaign of 1944-1945.|$|R
5|$|Coming {{into the}} weekend, Mercedes had already secured the Constructors' Championship, having done {{so at the}} {{previous}} race in Russia. Ferrari was in second place on 359 points, 139 points ahead of Williams. In the Drivers' Championship, Lewis Hamilton led with 302 points, 66 ahead of Sebastian Vettel and 73 <b>ahead</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> teammate, Nico Rosberg. This meant that Hamilton {{would be able to}} win the title with three races to spare, as long as he gathered nine points more than Vettel and two more than Rosberg at the Grand Prix.|$|E

Lord Hastings was unwilling to support the {{deposition}} of Edward V and, as a consequence, Richard summarily executed him that June, <b>ahead</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> own coronation. Kirby Muxloe and Lord Hastings' other estates were then restored to his widow, Katherine. After a short pause, Katherine continued some work on the site until the summer of 1484, focusing on making the corner tower and partially finished gatehouse habitable, before the project was finally halted. By this point around £1,000 had been spent on the works, including the laying of 1.3 million bricks.|$|E
5|$|In general polling, Tancredo fared {{far worse}} than in straw polls. Early polls placed the {{candidate}} both {{above and below the}} 1% mark. However, in November 2007 he slightly moved up in polling, reaching the 2% mark and coming out <b>ahead</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> closest rival, Congressman Duncan Hunter of California. In a November 16 Gallup poll, Tancredo stood in seventh place at 2%, trailing Congressman Ron Paul of Texas by 3%. In a head-to-head matchup done by Rasmussen Reports on August 29, 2007, Tancredo trailed New York Senator Hillary Clinton by 13% finishing with 37% to Clinton's 50%. In a head-to-head matchup with Barack Obama administered on the same day, Tancredo finished with 31% to 48% for Obama.|$|E

50|$|Contador won Stage 15 of the 2009 Tour de France by soloing to {{the finish}} line more than a minute <b>ahead</b> <b>of</b> most <b>of</b> <b>his</b> closest GC competitors, and in so doing took the general {{classification}} leader's yellow jersey. He then extended his lead on Stage 17, after finishing second in a breakaway of three riders with {{the same time as the}} stage winner, and then the next day he won the second time trial, increasing his overall advantage to more than four minutes.|$|R
50|$|Mercey {{was first}} {{selected}} for England U19 duty a year <b>ahead</b> <b>of</b> many <b>of</b> <b>his</b> peers, which included four {{appearances in the}} 2005 IRB Under 19 World Championships as well as outings in the 2004-05 U19 Six Nations.|$|R
5|$|In {{the final}} {{practice}} session, Castroneves recorded the fastest {{time with a}} lap of one minute and 1.6642 seconds, <b>ahead</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> Team Penske teammates Power and Briscoe. Hideki Mutoh recorded the fourth-fastest time; Dixon was fifth and Tracy sixth. Wilson was seventh-fastest, Kannan eighth, Marco Andretti ninth and Sato completed the top ten ahead of qualifying. Several drivers had high-speed spins without damaging their cars which triggered the caution flags to be displayed. A stoppage was caused when Tracy and Alex Tagilani both spun in the first turn; the former narrowly avoided a collision with Baugette who was exiting the pit lane.|$|E
5|$|In {{the second}} part, Lewis Hamilton quickly set a fast lap time, the quickest {{of the weekend}} up to that point, about half a second <b>ahead</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> {{teammate}} Rosberg. Meanwhile, Daniel Ricciardo set his fastest lap on the harder supersoft compound tyre, meaning {{that he would be}} able to start the race on them, should it have stayed dry. On the back end, Williams struggled for pace and both Valtteri Bottas and Felipe Massa missed out on Q3 by qualifying 11th and 14th respectively. Also eliminated were Esteban Gutiérrez, Jenson Button, Romain Grosjean and Magnussen.|$|E
5|$|Lewis Hamilton was fastest in Q2, two-tenths of {{a second}} <b>ahead</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> {{teammate}} Rosberg. In his last qualifying session with Lotus, Romain Grosjean experienced technical difficulties that forced {{him to come back}} into the pits. Even though he was sent out again, he was unable to set a time, stopping his car at turn seven. His teammate Pastor Maldonado also did not proceed into Q3, as did Jenson Button who missed out by two-tenths {{of a second}}. The two other drivers eliminated were Felipe Nasr for Sauber and Max Verstappen, who was unable to match the time of his teammate Carlos Sainz Jr.|$|E
2500|$|With his front-row {{seat in the}} chamber, Hainkel {{was one of the}} legislature's most {{colorful}} figures. He wound up his career as a [...] "bridge-building" [...] Republican who put the interests <b>of</b> <b>his</b> state <b>ahead</b> <b>of</b> party. <b>His</b> Senate district encompassed only a sliver <b>of</b> <b>his</b> original Uptown base but included portions of Jefferson, St. Tammany, and Tangipahoa parishes, including Hammond's Southeastern Louisiana University for which he became a legislative champion.|$|R
50|$|From {{the death}} <b>of</b> <b>his</b> {{grandfather}} in 1947, Christian stood only behind {{his father and}} elder brother Prince Ingolf {{in the order of}} hereditary succession to the throne, with only future children of Ingolf possibly taking a place <b>ahead</b> <b>of</b> him. <b>His</b> father Prince Knud was then the heir presumptive, due to succeed Christian's uncle King Frederick IX, who had three daughters but no sons.|$|R
50|$|Prost won <b>ahead</b> <b>of</b> Piquet, <b>his</b> {{teammate}} Stefan Johansson, Gerhard Berger (who battled for {{the whole}} race with handling problems <b>of</b> <b>his</b> Ferrari F1/87), Boutsen and Mansell, who caught the last point. Satoru Nakajima's first Grand Prix, saw him finish just outside the points in seventh in his Lotus. This was Prost's 26th victory, which made him the second most successful Grand Prix winner at the time, moving him <b>ahead</b> <b>of</b> Jim Clark and just one win behind tying with Jackie Stewart as the most successful.|$|R
