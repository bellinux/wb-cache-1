The recognition of other disorders presenting with weakness in a limb girdle distribution, such as the spinal muscular atrophies, dystrophinopathies, inflammatory and metabolic myopathies, casted doubt {{on the existence of}} LGMD as a separate entity. Recent linkage studies showing association between various forms of LGMD and loci on chromosome 15, 13 and 5 respectively, and the demonstration of 50 K dystrophin associated glycoprotein deficiency in some cases of LGMD, strongly support the notion that limb girdle muscular dystrophy constitutes a separate group of phenotypically and genotypically distinct disorders.

40|$|There is {{powerful}} {{evidence suggesting that}} etiology and pathogenesis of systemic lupus erythematosus has both genetic and environmental components. Unfortunately, understanding the genetics of lupus has been impeded by knowing the pattern of inheritance. Indeed, a complex mode of inheritance for the lupus disease phenotype {{is suggested by the}} known characteristics of this disorder. Twenty-five multiplex pedigrees for lupus have been enrolled and have been used to evaluate power to reveal linkage. The power to find linkage in these pedigrees is greater for autosomal recessive than for <b>autosomal</b> <b>dominant</b> <b>modes</b> of inheritance. Once 100 similar pedigrees are available for analysis our results predict that linkage is likely to be present for genetic models with relatively relaxed requirements. At loci operating by autosomal recessive inheritance linkage should be detectable despite genetic homogeneity as low as 40 % and penetrance as low as 50 %. For loci operating by <b>autosomal</b> <b>dominant</b> inheritance genetic homogeneity must be 60 % or more when penetrance is as low as 50 % to be able to establish linkage. Available preliminary data are also consistent with a possible genetic linkage of FCgammaRIIIpmn with lupus in American Black pedigrees multiplex for lupus.

50|$|Infantile convulsions and choreoathetosis (ICCA) {{syndrome}} is a neurological genetic disorder with an <b>autosomal</b> <b>dominant</b> <b>mode</b> of inheritance. It {{is characterized by}} the association of benign familial infantile epilepsy (BIFE) at age 3-12 months and later in life with paroxysmal kinesigenic choreoathetosis. The ICCA syndrome was first reported in 1997 in four French families from north-western France and provided the first genetic evidence for common mechanisms shared by benign infantile seizures and paroxysmal dyskinesia. The epileptic origin of PKC has long been a matter of debates and PD have been classified as reflex epilepsies.Indeed, attacks of PKC and epileptic seizures have several characteristics in common, they both are paroxysmal in presentation with a tendency to spontaneous remission, and a subset of PKC responds well to anticonvulsants. This genetic disease has been mapped to chromosome 16p-q12. More than 30 families with the clinical characteristics of ICCA syndrome have been described worldwide so far.|$|E
40|$|Dyskeratosis congenita (DC) {{is a rare}} genodermatosis characterised by {{a classic}} triad of {{dystrophic}} nails, reticular skin pigmentation andmucous membrane leukoplakic patches, which have {{a high rate of}} malignant transformation. The case report presented here deals with a sporadic case of DC without similar clinical presentation in the first-degree and second-degree relatives. Of note in this case, there was rapid malignant trans-formation in the non-homogeneous nodulo-speckled leukoplakic patch on the dorsum of the tongue. BACKGROUND Dyskeratosis congenita (DC), though having a classic triad of clinical features in majority of cases, often escapes the experienced eyes of a doctor. Even the patient ignores the early clinical features and correlates themwith certain other coincidences, such as snake bite in this case, thus seeking a late medical consultation. There have been X-linked reces-sive, autosomal recessive and <b>autosomal</b> <b>dominant</b> <b>modes</b> of inheritance reported in the literature previously. 1 How-ever, a sufficient number of sporadic cases due to unidenti-fiedmutations have also been reported. 2 The significance of the condition lies in prematuremortality arising from either bone marrow failure or malignant changes in the mucocu-taeneous leukoplakia. Thus, careful early diagnosis and an appropriate treatment plan are essential to reduce the mor-bidity and mortality in such cases. Here, a sporadic case of DC is reported with no related disorder in the siblings of the patient, or the first-degree and second-degree relatives. The patient exhibited the classic triadwithmild bonemarrow suppression.

40|$|Objectives. To confirm, in a {{study of}} a large, {{independent}} cohort of families with prostate cancer, the findings of three segregation analyses that have suggested the existence of an inherited form of prostate cancer with an <b>autosomal</b> <b>dominant</b> inheritance <b>mode.</b> Methods. Between January 1991 and December 1993, 1199 pedigrees were ascertained through single, unrelated, prostate cancer probands who presented for radical prostatectomy at the Division of Urologic Surgery, Washington University Medical Center in St. Louis, Missouri. Maximum likelihood segregation analysis was used to test specifically for mendelian inheritance of prostate cancer. Results. Segregation analyses revealed that the familial aggregation of prostate cancer can be best explained by the <b>autosomal</b> <b>dominant</b> inheritance of a rare (q = 0. 0037) high-risk allele. According to the best-fitting <b>autosomal</b> <b>dominant</b> model, 97 % of all carriers will be affected by 85 years of age compared with 10 % of noncarriers. Furthermore, the <b>autosomal</b> <b>dominant</b> model predicts that the high-risk allele accounts for a large proportion (65 %) of all patients diagnosed with prostate cancer before 56 years of age. However, of all prostate cancer cases, a relatively small proportion is inherited (8 % by 85 years old). Conclusions. These results are in agreement with earlier reports of segregation analyses of prostate cancer and strengthen the evidence that prostate cancer is inherited in a mendelian fashion within a subset of families.

50|$|The hair {{is normal}} in {{quantity}} {{and is usually}} silvery-blond or straw-colored. It is disorderly, it stands out from the scalp, and cannot be combed flat. The underlying structural anomaly is longitudinal grooving of the hair shaft, which appears triangular in cross section.  This is caused by mutations {{in one of three}} possible genes; PADI3, TGM or TCHH3. The characteristic hair shaft anomaly can be demonstrated in asymptomatic family members by scanning electron microscopy. To be noticeable, 50% of hairs must be affected by the structural abnormality. Improvement often occurs in later childhood. An <b>autosomal</b> <b>dominant</b> <b>mode</b> of inheritance has been suggested though an autosomal recessive pattern with varying degrees of penetrance has also been noted. The stiffness of the uncombable hair has been reasoned to be due to the triangular form of the hair shaft in cross section. It has been suggested that the condition may result from premature keratinization of the inner root sheath.|$|E
50|$|Tests for {{osteochondroma}} {{can also}} identify {{diseases such as}} secondary peripheral chondrosarcoma and Multiple osteochondromatosis. In large, secondary chondrosarcoma arises {{at the site of}} osteochondroma due to increased thickness of the cartilage cap indicating potential malignant transformation. The symptoms of multiple osteochondromatosis are similar to solitary osteochondroma, but they are often more severe. Painless bumps can arise at the site of tumor and pain and other discomforts can also take place if pressure is put on the soft tissues, nerves, or blood vessels. Dysplasia Epiphysealis Hemimelica (DEH) or Trevor's disease and metachondromatosis (MC) are considered differential diagnosis of both solitary and hereditary osteochondromas. DEH is described as a type of over growth at one or more epiphyses. Similar to osteochondroma, DEH is diagnosed prior to 15 years of age and the growth of lesions end at puberty, when the growth plates close. Metachondromatosis is a rare disorder that exhibit symptoms of both multiple osteochondromas and enchondromas in children and is also inherited in <b>autosomal</b> <b>dominant</b> <b>mode.</b>|$|E
