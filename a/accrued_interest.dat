5|$|Initially, it was {{suggested}} that tolling would cease once the original cost of construction plus <b>accrued</b> <b>interest</b> was repaid – this was done in 1993 and it was planned that tolls would not be levied after May 1995. Instead legislation enabling the continued levying of tolls was renewed by Parliament (originally that of the UK but now the Scottish Parliament) in 1998, 2003 and 2006.|$|E

2500|$|When a {{borrower}} makes a Pay-Option ARM payment that is {{less than}} the <b>accruing</b> <b>interest,</b> there is [...] "negative amortization", which means that the unpaid portion of the <b>accruing</b> <b>interest</b> is added to the outstanding principal balance. For example, if the borrower makes a minimum payment of $1,000 and the ARM has <b>accrued</b> monthly <b>interest</b> of $1,500, $500 will be added to the borrower's loan balance. Moreover, the next month's interest-only payment will be calculated using the new, higher principal balance.|$|R

50|$|There {{are five}} kinds of student loans {{available}} through the government: Perkins Loans, subsidized Stafford Loans, unsubsidized Stafford Loans, direct loans, and PLUS loans. A student's eligibility {{for any of these}} loans, as well as the amount of the loan itself is determined by information on the student's FAFSA. The interest rate and whether or not <b>interest</b> <b>accrues</b> on the loan while the student is in school depends of the type of federal loan. Fro example, subsidized Stafford Loans do not <b>accrue</b> <b>interest</b> while a student is enrolled in a university, whereas unsubsidized Stafford Loans <b>accrue</b> <b>interest</b> as soon as a student receives them.|$|R

50|$|On December 2 {{at the end}} of each {{contract}} year, the Commissioner's Office notifies {{every team}} that went over the tax threshold that they must pay their tax by January 21 of the following calendar year. The Commissioner's Office then redistributes this money in a standard manner. The first $2,375,400 goes to fund the players as described in the MLB Players Benefits Plan Agreements. Of the remaining sum, 50% will also benefit the players, but it will be put in a long term plan and <b>accrue</b> <b>interest.</b> Of the remaining 50%, 25% will go into the Industry Growth Fund to help the growth of baseball worldwide, and <b>accrue</b> <b>interest,</b> and 25% will be used to defray Club's funding obligations from the MLB Players Benefits Agreements.|$|R
25|$|To smooth {{temporary}} or cyclical {{changes in}} the money supply, the desk engages in repurchase agreements (repos) with its primary dealers. Repos are essentially secured, short-term lending by the Fed. On {{the day of the}} transaction, the Fed deposits money in a primary dealer's reserve account, and receives the promised securities as collateral. When the transaction matures, the process unwinds: the Fed returns the collateral and charges the primary dealer's reserve account for the principal and <b>accrued</b> <b>interest.</b> The term of the repo (the time between settlement and maturity) can vary from 1 day (called an overnight repo) to 65 days.|$|E
25|$|Hackett {{was awarded}} the honorary degree of LL.D. by Trinity College, Dublin in June 1902. Under his will a bequest to the Church of England paid for the {{building}} of St George's College, the first residential college within the University of Western Australia. After provision for his widow and children, the residue of his estate went to the University which received the sum of £425,000. £250,000 of this with <b>accrued</b> <b>interest</b> {{was used for the}} erection of a group of buildings which include Winthrop Hall and Hackett Hall. Another £200,000 was used to set up a fund which still provides scholarships, bursaries and other financial help for deserving students.|$|E
25|$|Traffic counts {{following}} {{the opening day}} ceremonies steadily rose {{in the first few}} years, just as they had in the four months Gertie was in service. Five years after the bridge opened, the average count was 4,699 vehicles per day. By 1960, an average of 6,218 vehicles crossed, and in 1965, fifteen years after the bridge opened, the figure from 1960 was doubled. With an average of 11,267 vehicles per day, the Washington Toll Bridge Authority soon removed the tolls. In early 1965, a bill passed the state legislature removing the tolls, and on May 14, 1965, in a ceremony at the toll plaza, Governor Dan Evans signed the legislation that removed the tolls. The signing was significant and historic. Significant because the bridge had been paid off – the accrued revenue stood at $19 million (US$ in present terms) - $5 million (US$ in present terms) more than the construction bond's cost and <b>accrued</b> <b>interest.</b> It was also historic, because the tolls were removed 13 years ahead of schedule.|$|E

500|$|In December 2009, Zayat was sued by Fifth Third Bank for {{an alleged}} $34 million in unpaid loans. He had taken out {{multiple}} {{loans from the}} bank totaling over $38 million between 2007 and 2009. Fifth Third alleged that Zayat was in default because he failed to make two payments in 2009. As part of the loan package, the bank had a security interest in Zayat Stables' horses, prize money, stallion shares and stallion income. Further, the bank added an amended provision to its later loans stating, [...] "if Zayat Stables defaulted {{on any of the}} Notes, such default would be considered a default under all of the notes thereby entitling Fifth Third to accelerate the principal balance and all <b>accrued</b> <b>interest</b> due and owing under all of the Notes." [...] While Zayat paid off some of the money owed, the bank contended that he remained in default on one loan. The bank alleged that Zayat had lost $52 million between 2006 and 2008, that he had not reported a previous Chapter 7 personal bankruptcy he had filed under the name Ephraim David Zayat, and the bank attempted to foreclose on his horses.|$|E
500|$|In July 1919 Bottomley {{announced}} his [...] "Victory Bonds Club", {{based on the}} government's latest issue of Victory Bonds. Normally, these bonds cost £5; in Bottomley's club, subscribers bought units for a minimum payment of £1, and participated in an annual draw for prizes—up to £20,000, he said—funded from <b>accrued</b> <b>interest.</b> Contrary to Bottomley's public statements, not all the money subscribed was used to buy bonds. He had ambitions to become a press baron, to rival such as the Lords Rothermere and Beaverbrook. In October 1919 he used War Bonds funds to buy two obscure newspapers, the National News and the Sunday Evening Telegram. The papers were not financially successful, and in 1921 Bottomley closed the Telegram and changed {{the name of the}} National News to Sunday Illustrated. To bolster its fortunes, he transferred his Sunday Pictorial column to the Illustrated, and mounted an expensive promotional campaign, but with little benefit. The paper languished, while Bottomley lost the large income and readership that went with the Pictorial. His fortunes declined further when, in 1920, Odhams revoked the pre-war partnership agreement and took full control of John Bull. Bottomley was made editor for life, but a year later Odhams terminated this arrangement with a final pay-off of £25,000, which ended Bottomley's connection with the paper.|$|E

The price excluding <b>accrued</b> <b>interest</b> is known as the [...] "flat" [...] or [...] "clean price".|$|E

Also, unlike IBR and PAYE, if required monthly payments do not cover the <b>accruing</b> <b>interest,</b> 50% of the unpaid interest is forgiven, thereby reducing negative amortization.|$|R

Recent changes to Section 8-8-10, Code of Alabama 1975, changed the rate of interest charged on judgments. As of September 1, 2011, the interest rate charged on past due child support arrears will be 7.5% per year.

2500|$|When {{the bond}} is not valued {{precisely}} on a coupon date, the calculated price, using the methods above, will incorporate accrued interest: i.e. any interest {{due to the}} owner of the bond since the previous coupon date; see day count convention.

The [...] "clean price" [...] is the price excluding any interest that has accrued. [...] Clean prices are generally more stable over time than dirty prices.
