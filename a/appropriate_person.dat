25|$|Sambandar of the Shaiva Siddhanta school, in the 7th century C.E., {{writes about}} karma in his outline of Shaivism. He {{explains}} {{the concept of}} karma in Hinduism by distinguishing it from that of Buddhism and Jainism, which do not require {{the existence of an}} external being like God. In their beliefs, just as a calf among a large number of cows can find its mother at suckling time, so also does karma find the specific individual it needs to attach to and come to fruition. However, theistic Hindus posit that karma, unlike the calf, is an unintelligent entity. Hence, karma cannot locate the <b>appropriate</b> <b>person</b> by itself. Sambantha concludes that an intelligent Supreme Being with perfect wisdom and power (Shiva, for example) is necessary to make karma attach to the appropriate individual. In such sense, God is the Divine Accountant.|$|E

But the more profound, more lasting idea – being the film fans we are – was Ingmar Bergman. So we hit upon a fantasy situation of him going to Hollywood, which is obviously a lot more universal, too." [...] Before starting work on the musical, the Mael brothers decided to refresh their memories by looking at Bergman's films again. [...] "We were both really big film fans in university. At that time unless you only liked foreign film, and hated American ones, you weren't cool", Ron Mael told The Times. [...] "There was a real kind of seriousness to [...] He actually addressed big things {{and was able to}} frame those in really pure, cinematic ways. Now those things are seen as being kind of pretentious. Everyone wants to be seen as though they don't care about the big issues." [...] Commenting on the suitability of Bergman as the topic of a musical, Russell Mael told a Swedish newspaper, [...] "In a way, he is the least <b>appropriate</b> <b>person</b> for a musical. We like the absurdity of it all. He was such a deep, intense person {{and the vast majority of}} his films are about really deep topics.

The account was written by Lady Betty Cobbe, the youngest daughter of Marcus, Earl of Tyrone, and granddaughter of Nicola S., Lady Beresford. She lived to a good old age, in full use of all her faculties, both of body and mind. I can myself remember her, for when a boy I passed through Bath on a journey with my mother, and we went to her house there, and had luncheon. She appeared to my juvenile imagination a very <b>appropriate</b> <b>person</b> to revise and transmit such a tale, and fully adapted to do ample justice to her subject- matter.

40|$|Construction is {{a safety}} {{critical}} industry. Safety-related indicators {{can be used}} as efficient accident/incident precursors. However, delays between indicator data collection and reporting can undermine any possible advantages. The usefulness of indicator data diminishes within a fairly short period due to the dynamism of the construction process. To date, no research has sought to evaluate the efficacy of realtime collection, processing and delivery of safety-relevant data to <b>appropriate</b> <b>persons</b> within a construction safety context. We argue that it is crucial to monitor predictors of future safety performance levels in real-time. This paper proposes an innovative real-time safety monitoring system for construction health and safety based on a safety indicator framework. The proposed safety monitoring system incorporates project specific indicators as physical hazard indicators, management and perception leading indicators. The system integrates the dynamic nature of the construction site by measuring constructor safety leadership performance through a live on-site data capture mechanism. The system alerts <b>appropriate</b> <b>persons</b> where attention needed based on benchmarked and predicted analysis of safety measures. This enables a step-change in the use and effectiveness of leading indicators in construction safety, with a resultant improvement in workplace safety and health...|$|R
