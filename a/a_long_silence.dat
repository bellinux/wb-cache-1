25|$|New Zealand cricketer Warren Lees {{recounted the}} underarm {{incident}} on New Zealand's 20/20 current affairs show, on Thursday 17 February 2005. He {{said that after}} the affair there was <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>silence</b> in the dressing room, which was broken suddenly and unexpectedly by fellow player Mark Burgess smashing a tea cup.|$|E
25|$|After Attlee and Greenwood left, Chamberlain asked whom {{he should}} {{recommend}} to the King as his successor. The {{version of events}} given by Churchill is that Chamberlain's preference for Halifax was obvious (Churchill implies that the spat between Churchill and the Labour benches the previous night {{had something to do}} with that); there was <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>silence</b> which Halifax eventually broke by saying he did not believe he could lead the government effectively as a member of the House of Lords instead of the House of Commons. Churchill's version gets the date wrong, and he fails to mention the presence of David Margesson, the government Chief Whip.|$|E
25|$|Gus {{leaves the}} room {{to get a drink}} of water in the bathroom, and the dumbwaiter's {{speaking}} tube whistles (a sign that there is a person on the other end who wishes to communicate). Ben listens carefully—we gather from his replies that their victim has arrived and {{is on his way to}} the room. Ben shouts for Gus, who is still out of the room. The door that the target is supposed to enter from flies open, Ben rounds on it with his gun, and Gus enters, stripped of his jacket, waistcoat, tie and gun. There is <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>silence</b> as the two stare at each other before the curtain comes down.|$|E
60|$|Bobby's {{sentence}} {{died away}} as The Infant collapsed on a divan {{and said no}} more than, 'Your commissions!' There was <b>a</b> <b>long,</b> <b>long</b> <b>silence.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... 'What are you {{thinking}} of, Frank?' Mrs. Hardy asked her husband one evening, after <b>an</b> unusually <b>long</b> <b>silence</b> on his part.|$|R
60|$|There was <b>a</b> <b>long,</b> ominous <b>silence,</b> {{broken only}} by quickly muttered invocations to the saints and to Our Lady.|$|R
25|$|That {{evening he}} played {{what he had}} written so far to {{a small group of}} Leningrad musicians. After Shostakovich {{finished}} the first movement, there was <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>silence.</b> An air-raid warning sounded. No one moved. Everyone wanted to hear the piece again. The composer excused himself to take his family to the nearest air-raid shelter. When he returned, he repeated the first movement, which then was followed by the next movement for his guests. Their reaction encouraged him to start that night on the Adagio. He completed this movement on 29 September in the city. Shostakovich and his family were then evacuated to Moscow on 1 October 1941. They moved to Kuybyshev (now Samara) on 22 October, where the symphony was finally completed.|$|E
2500|$|Another {{story told}} of Dirac {{is that when}} he first met the young Richard Feynman at a conference, he said after <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>silence,</b> [...] "I have an equation. Do you have one too?".|$|E
2500|$|After he {{presented}} a lecture at a conference, one colleague {{raised his hand}} and said [...] "I don't understand the equation on the top-right-hand corner of the blackboard". After <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>silence,</b> the moderator asked Dirac {{if he wanted to}} answer the question, to which Dirac replied [...] "That was not a question, it was a comment." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I {{thought when}} you left me this evening, my esteemed acquaintance,' said Sir John after <b>a</b> pretty <b>long</b> <b>silence,</b> 'that you {{intended}} to return with all despatch?' ...|$|R
60|$|There was <b>a</b> <b>long,</b> soft <b>silence,</b> {{that seemed}} to last for ever. Suddenly she threw her arms round his neck and kissed him.|$|R
5000|$|The CD version also {{mimics the}} {{original}} LP version {{in that the}} CD contains <b>a</b> 14-second <b>long</b> <b>silence</b> immediately after [...] "The End" [...] before [...] "Her Majesty" [...] starts playing.|$|R
2500|$|A {{commentary}} on the trial continues: [...] "After <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>silence,</b> interrupted by some expressions of admiration, {{he was told that}} his request should be submitted to the lord-lieutenant. [...] Thinking, however, that there was but little prospect, he committed suicide in prison. [...] With Wolfe Tone, terminated the insurrection of 1798. He was the prime mover of it, and was its last victim…" ...|$|E
2500|$|Rubinstein was as {{well known}} during his {{lifetime}} for his sarcasm {{as well as his}} sometimes penetrating insight. [...] During one of Rubinstein's visits to Paris, French pianist Alfred Cortot played the first movement of Beethoven's Appassionata for him. After <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>silence,</b> Rubinstein told Cortot, [...] "My boy, don't you ever forget what I am going to tell you. Beethoven's music must not be studied. It must be reincarnated." [...] Cortot reportedly never forgot those words.|$|E
2500|$|He {{released}} an early autobiography, Rocket Man: The Roger Clemens Story written with Peter Gammons, in 1987. Clemens {{is also the}} spokesperson for Champion car dealerships in South Texas. [...] In April 2009, Clemens {{was the subject of}} an unauthorized biography by Jeff Pearlman, titled The Rocket that Fell to Earth-Roger Clemens and the Rage for Baseball Immortality, that focused on his childhood and early career and accused Mike Piazza of using steroids. On May 12, Clemens broke <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>silence</b> to denounce a heavily researched expose by four [...] investigative reporters from the New York Daily News, called [...] Clemens went on ESPN's Mike and Mike show to call the book [...] "garbage", but a review by Michiko Kakutani of The New York Times called the book [...] "gripping" [...] and compared it to the work of Bob Woodward.|$|E
60|$|There was <b>a</b> <b>long</b> pained <b>silence.</b> The {{little man}} seemed {{withered}} by the coarse {{brutality of the}} reply. In his face was unutterable hurt and woe.|$|R
60|$|He {{looked at}} her and smiled. He saw she was pure woman. He had met at last with a sister soul. There was <b>a</b> <b>long,</b> deep <b>silence.</b>|$|R
60|$|He {{stared at}} her in <b>a</b> <b>long,</b> furious <b>silence,</b> then {{exploded}} into oaths, and finally inveighed against her unnaturalness and pronounced her bewitched by that foul dog Tressilian.|$|R
2500|$|Rao's {{involvement}} in the nationalist movement is reflected {{in his first two}} books. [...] The novel Kanthapura (1938) was an account of the impact of Gandhi's teaching on nonviolent resistance against the British. The story is seen {{from the perspective of a}} small Mysore village in South India. [...] Rao borrows the style and structure from Indian vernacular tales and folk-epic. [...] Rao returned to the theme of Gandhism in the short story collection The Cow of the Barricades (1947). The Serpent and the Rope (1960) was written after <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>silence</b> during which Rao returned to India. The work dramatised the relationships between Indian and Western culture. The serpent in the title refers to illusion and the rope to reality. Cat and Shakespeare (1965) was a metaphysical comedy that answered philosophical questions posed in the earlier novels.|$|E
2500|$|The Australian press {{attacked}} the team, {{and called for}} changes, including the omission of the captain, Johnson. Acerbic cricket pundit and former Test cricketer and team-mate Sid Barnes called Johnson [...] "Australia's non-playing captain". [...] Bill Ferguson, the Australian team's scorer, was also critical: [...] "Had Johnson been told by his friends in the press that he was, in fact, a passenger, he might have pondered on the advisability of standing down. [...] There {{would have been no}} shame in standing down." [...] Johnson, Miller and Gil Langley were the tour selectors. Langley and Miller were willing to omit Johnson, but only if the captain volunteered to stand aside. Johnson did not volunteer, so the others did not discuss the topic. The only change occurred when Miller proposed the replacement of Peter Burge with Ian Craig. This change came after <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>silence</b> between the trio as they waited for the others to bring up Johnson's form. Writing after the tour, Miller stated [...] "Privately I thought that [...] was not a form selection. [...] On the other hand, I did not think it wise to change skippers in midstream." [...] Miller and Johnson had both been appointed as Members of the Order of the British Empire (MBE) in the 1956 New Year Honours, and between the Tests they attended their formal investiture.|$|E
60|$|Jean-Marie, after <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>silence,</b> professed that {{he hardly}} knew.|$|E
6000|$|... 'I suppose {{this can}} be managed somehow,' said the butcher, after <b>a</b> pretty <b>long</b> <b>silence.</b> 'What will you take to go out?' 'I beg your pardon,' replied Mr. Pickwick. 'What did you say? I hardly {{understand}} you.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'True! True! Correct! Correct!' {{said the}} Subadar-Major. There was <b>a</b> <b>long,</b> easy <b>silence.</b> One heard a water-wheel {{creaking}} somewhere and the nearer sound of meal being {{ground in a}} quern.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Before {{we leave}} the subject, you ought to understand,' said I, {{breaking}} <b>a</b> pretty <b>long</b> <b>silence,</b> 'that I believe Agnes Wickfield to be as far above you, and as far removed from all your aspirations, as that moon herself!' ...|$|R
60|$|<b>A</b> <b>long</b> <b>silence</b> ensued, {{which was}} at length broken by her companion.|$|E
60|$|<b>A</b> <b>long</b> <b>silence</b> followed. Del {{knocked the}} ashes out and raised up.|$|E
60|$|As {{they were}} riding home, Ripley roused up after <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>silence.</b>|$|E
60|$|<b>A</b> very <b>long</b> <b>silence</b> succeeded. What {{struggle}} {{there was}} in him between Nature and Grace in this interval, I cannot tell: only singular gleams scintillated in his eyes, and strange shadows passed over his face. He spoke at last.|$|R
60|$|There was <b>a</b> <b>long</b> {{minute of}} <b>silence.</b> Shorty {{was the first}} to speak.|$|R
6000|$|... "Wot a {{remarkable}} difference," [...] said Bobby, breaking <b>a</b> rather <b>long</b> <b>silence</b> of expectancy, as he glanced round on the splendid landscape {{which was all}} aglow with the descending sun, [...] "'tween these 'ere diggin's an' Commercial Road, or George Yard, or Ratcliff 'Ighway. Ain't it, Tim?" ...|$|R
60|$|There was <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>silence,</b> {{which was}} again {{interrupted}} by the stranger.|$|E
60|$|There was <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>silence.</b> Then Anna spoke {{more seriously}} than usual.|$|E
60|$|Denton {{stood up}} sharply. They stared {{at one another}} through <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>silence.</b>|$|E
5000|$|After <b>a</b> <b>long</b> {{period of}} <b>silence,</b> <b>a</b> joke outtake of [...] "Black Hole Sun" [...] comes in.|$|R
60|$|A loud wail {{of horror}} {{rose from the}} lines of tonsured heads which skirted the high wall--a wail which {{suddenly}} died away into <b>a</b> <b>long</b> hushed <b>silence,</b> broken at last by a rapturous cry of thanksgiving and of joy.|$|R
50|$|Adams Doty wrote two novels: <b>A</b> <b>Long</b> Year of <b>Silence</b> and Wild Orphan. <b>A</b> <b>Long</b> Year of <b>Silence,</b> set in New Ulm, Minnesota, during World War I, was {{a finalist}} for the Minnesota Book Award and winner of the 2005 Midwest Book Award. A third book, Becoming the Mother of Me, {{described}} her life growing up as a minister's daughter and her trip to Hollywood and her first marriage.|$|R
