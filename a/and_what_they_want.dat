Jewelry, diamonds, pearls, emeralds, rubies, {{and all sorts of}} pretty things that are made of them, are as lawful and innocent objects of admiration and desire, as flowers or birds or butterflies, or the tints of evening skies. Gems, in fact, are a species of mineral flower; they are the blossoms of the dark, hard mine; <b>and</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>want</b> in perfume they make up in durability. The best Christian in the world may, without the least inconsistency, admire them, and say, as a charming, benevolent old Quaker lady once said to me, 'I do so love to look at beautiful jewelry!' The love of beautiful dress, in itself, therefore, so far from being in a bad sense worldly, may be the same indication of a refined and poetical nature that is given by the love of flowers and of natural objects.|$|E

He began {{examining}} the faces and foreheads of the company, and was astonished at the first glance by the lofty and ample development of brain in at least one half. There were intellects there--or rather capacities of intellect, capable, surely, of anything, had not the promise of the brow been almost always belied by the loose and sensual lower features. They were evidently rather a degraded than an undeveloped race. 'The low forehead of the Kabyle and Koord,' thought Lancelot, 'is compensated by the grim sharp lip, and glittering eye, which prove that all the small capabilities of the man have been called out into clear and vigorous action: but here the very features themselves, both by what they have <b>and</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>want,</b> testify against that society which carelessly wastes her most precious wealth, the manhood of her masses! Tregarva! you have observed a good many things--did you ever observe whether the men with the large foreheads were better than the men with the small ones?' ...|$|E
