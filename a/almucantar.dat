Besides the degree of linear polarization (DoLP) and the total radiance I, the parameters Q, U, and AoP have much potential to improve retrievals of aerosol microphysical and chemical properties. However, {{they have not been}} derived based on the CE 318 -DP so far because they change with the reference plane that is hard to know due to an uncontrolled initial angle related to installation of the optical sensor head to the automated mount of this type of instrument. In this work, the polarization pattern of skylight with the direction of polarization perpendicular to the scattering plane (i. e., the principal plane in the solar principal plane geometry) is applied to correct the initial angle and then to obtained Q, U, and AoP. The perpendicular and parallel polarized radiances Ir and Il, as well as the linear depolarization ratio ρ are further derived after Q is known. A new polarized <b>almucantar</b> geometry based on CE 318 -DP is measured to illustrate abundant variation features of these parameters.

It provides theoretical analysis and guidance to the companion study in which we have developed an inversion algorithm for retrieving 22 aerosol microphysical parameters associated with a bimodal PSD function from real AERONET measurements. Our theoretical analysis starts with generating the synthetic measurements at four spectral bands (440, 675, 870, and 1020 nm) with a Unified Linearized Vector Radiative Transfer Model for various types of spherical aerosol particles. Subsequently, the quantitative information content for retrieving aerosol parameters is investigated in four observation scenarios, i. e., I 1, I 2, P 1, and P 2. Measurements in the scenario (I 1) comprise the solar direct radiances and <b>almucantar</b> radiances that are used in the current AERONET operational inversion algorithm. The other three scenarios include different additional measurements: (I 2) the solar principal plane radiances, (P 1) the solar principal plane radiances and polarization, and (P 2) the solar <b>almucantar</b> polarization. Results indicate that adding polarization measurements can increase the degree of freedom for signal by 2 – 5 in the scenario P 1, while not as much of an increase is found in the scenarios I 2 and P 2. Correspondingly, smallest retrieval errors are found in the scenario P 1 : 2. 3 % (2. 9 %) for the fine-mode (coarse-mode) aerosol volume concentration, 1. 3 % (3. 5 %) for the effective radius, 7. 2 % (12 %) for the effective variance, 0. 005 (0. 035) for the real-part refractive index, and 0. 019 (0. 068) for the single-scattering albedo.

We further investigated those retrieval errors over a variety of aerosol loading and fine-/coarse-mode prevalence, which indicates that observations in scenario P 1 can yield the retrieval of refractive index and single-scattering albedo for both fine and coarse aerosol modes, when aerosol optical depth at 440 nm is larger than 0. 2 and 870 / 1020 nm Ångström exponent ranges between 0. 7 and 1. 6...|$|E

40|$|The {{worldwide}} aerosol robotic network (AERONET) of ground-based radiometers {{was developed}} (in part) as a satellite validation tool (Holben et al. 1998). These sites utilize spectral sky-scanning radiometers, providing more information for aerosol retrievals than conventional sunphotometer measurements. The {{use of the}} <b>almucantar</b> sky radiance scans {{in conjunction with the}} aerosol optical thicknesses are the basis of the AERONET Dubovik retrievals, which provide the aerosol size distribution and the refractive index at four wavelengths (Dubovik and King 2000). The accuracy of the Dubovik retrieval has been assessed with the retrieval of synthetic data (Dubovik et al. 2000), but an assessment utilizing independent measurements is desirable. Hence, the AERONET retrievals are used here as input to a discrete-ordinates radiative transfer model (DISORT, Stamnes et al. 1988) utilizing 12 computational streams to calculate the solar radiation at the surface, and the results are compared to co-located surface measurements. Included in the comparison are principle plane radiance measurements from the Cimel sunphotometer, irradiance measurements from the Multi-filter Rotating Shadowband Radiometer (MFRSR, Michalsky et al. 2001), and irradiance measurements from the Rotating Shadowband Spectroradiometer (RSS, Harrison et al. 1999) ...|$|E
40|$|We {{present results}} of a {{retrieval}} algorithm for satellite and ground based instruments using the Arizona radiative transfer code. A state vector describing the atmospheric and surface condition is iteratively modified until the calculated radiances match the observed values. Elements of the state vector include: aerosol concentrations, radius, optical properties, mass-weighted altitudes, chlorophyll concentration and wind speed. While computationally expensive, many assumptions used in other retrieval algorithms are not invoked. We present co-located retrievals for MODIS, SEAWIFS and nearby AERONET sites. MODIS AQUA and SEA WIFS: Ten MODIS (. 412 - 2. 110 microns) and eight SEA WIFS (. 412 -. 865 microns) radiances (. 412 -. 865 microns) include channels where aerosols absorb and reflect radiation. We focus on retrieving bio-mass burning aerosols that are advected over open ocean. Since chlorophyll absorbs at frequencies where black carbon absorbs, our retrieval algorithm accounts for chlorophyll absorption by simultaneously retrieving both aerosol and chlorophyll amount. Our retrieved chlorophyll concentrations {{are similar to those}} from the Ocean Color Group. AERONET: Both <b>Almucantar</b> and Principle plane radiances are used to retrieve the state of the atmosphere and ocean conditions. Our retrieved aerosol size distributions and optical properties are consistent with the aerosol inversions from the AERONET group...|$|E
