40|$|AbstractPreviously {{we showed}} that {{preincubation}} of cells with ferric ammonium citrate (FAC) resulted in a marked increase in Fe uptake from both 59 Fe-transferrin (Tf) and 59 Fe-citrate (D. R. Richardson, E. Baker, J. Biol. Chem. 267 (1992) 13972 – 13979; D. R. Richardson, P. Ponka, Biochim. Biophys. Acta 1269 (1995) 105 – 114). This Fe uptake process was independent of the transferrin receptor {{and appeared to be}} activated by free radicals generated via the iron-catalysed Haber-Weiss reaction. To further understand this process, the present investigation was performed. In these experiments, cells were preincubated for 3 h at 37 °C with FAC or metal ion solutions and then labelled for 3 h at 37 °C with 59 Fe-Tf. Exposure of cells to FAC resulted in Fe uptake from 59 Fe-citrate that became saturated at an Fe concentration of 2. 5 μM, while FAC-activated Fe uptake from Tf was not saturable up to 25 μM. In addition, the extent of FAC-activated Fe uptake from citrate was far greater than that from Tf. These results suggest a mechanism where FAC-activated Fe uptake from citrate may result from direct interaction with the transporter, while Fe uptake from Tf appears indirect and less efficient. Preincubation of cells with FAC at 4 °C instead of 37 °C prevented its effect at stimulating 59 Fe uptake from 59 Fe-Tf, suggesting that an active process was involved. Previous studies by others have shown that FAC can increase ferrireductase activity that may enhance 59 Fe uptake from 59 Fe-Tf. However, {{there was no difference in}} the ability of FAC-treated cells compared to controls to reduce ferricyanide to ferrocyanide, suggesting no change in oxidoreductase activity. To examine if activation of this Fe uptake mechanism could occur by incubation with a range of metal ions, cells were preincubated with either FAC, ferric chloride, <b>ferrous</b> <b>sulphate,</b> <b>ferrous</b> <b>ammonium</b> <b>sulphate,</b> gallium nitrate, copper chloride, zinc chloride, or cobalt chloride. Stimulation of 59 Fe uptake from Tf was shown (in order of potency) with ferric chloride, <b>ferrous</b> <b>sulphate,</b> <b>ferrous</b> <b>ammonium</b> <b>sulphate,</b> and gallium nitrate. The other metal ions examined decreased 59 Fe uptake from Tf. The fact that redox-active Cu(II) ion did not stimulate Fe uptake while redox-inactive Ga(III) did, suggests a mechanism of transporter activation not solely dependent on free radical generation. Indeed, the activation of Fe uptake appears dependent on the presence of the Fe atom itself or a metal ion with atomic similarities to Fe (e. g. Ga) ...|$|R

40|$|Silk {{and wool}} fabrics were {{coloured}} employing aqueous tea extract in absence and presence of magnesium sulphate, aluminium <b>sulphate</b> and <b>ferrous</b> <b>sulphate</b> as the mordanting agents. Colour uptake for wool {{was found to}} be more than that for silk under all conditions studied. Colouring biochemical components of tea revealed highest affinity for both the protein fibres at pH 2 to 4 in presence and absence of such mordanting agents. Use of <b>ferrous</b> <b>sulphate</b> and aluminium sulphate produced significant improvement in colour uptake following a pre- or post mordanting methods. Coloured protein fibres in general produced a light-fastness rating of 5 on a scale of 1 - 5 and a wash-fastness rating of 4 on a scale of 1 - 5. <b>Ferrous</b> <b>sulphate</b> and aluminium sulphate improved colour retention on washing and the fastness properties further. Coloured protein fibres became blackish, when <b>ferrous</b> <b>sulphate</b> was employed as mordanting agent. This item was scanned with a HP 4850 Scanjet at 300 dpi and consists of 9 pages...|$|R
40|$|Two rapid, simple, {{sensitive}} and cost-effective titrimetric and spectrophotometric methods are described for {{the determination of}} albendazole (ALB) in bulk drug and in pharmaceuticals. In titrimetry (method A), ALB is oxidized by a known excess of potassium permanganate (KMnO 4) in H 2 SO 4 medium followed by the determination of unreacted permanganate by titration with <b>ferrous</b> <b>ammonium</b> <b>sulphate</b> (FAS). In spectrophotometry (method B), ALB is treated with a measured excess of permanganate in acid medium and the unreacted oxidant is measured at 545 nm. The molar ratio (stoichiometry) in titrimetry and the optimum assay conditions are studied. Titrimetry is applicable over 2 - 9 mg range and the calculations {{are based on a}} 1 : 1 (ALB: KMnO 4) molar-ratio. In spectrophotometry, Beers law is obeyed over 8. 0 - 64. 0 μg mL- 1 concentration range of ALB. The molar absorptivity and Sandellsensitivity values are calculated to be 3. 348 × 103 L mol- 1 cm- 1 and 0. 08 μg cm- 2, respectively. The limits of detection (LOD) and quantification (LOQ) are also reported for the spectrophotometric method. The applicability of the developed methods is demonstrated by the assay of ALB in pure drug as well as in commercial formulations...|$|R

Single crystals of pure Bis thiourea Zinc chloride and <b>Ferrous</b> <b>sulphate</b> doped Bis thiourea Zinc chloride were grown by slow evaporation technique. The grown crystals have been subjected to powder X-ray diffraction to determine the crystalline size and unit cell parameter. The incorporation of <b>ferrous</b> <b>sulphate</b> in BTZC was confirmed by the EDAX and FTIR analysis. UV-Visible spectrum shows that the grown crystals have wide optical transparency in the entire visible region. The thermo gravimetric analysis suggests that incorporation of <b>ferrous</b> <b>sulphate</b> in the BTZC decreases the thermal stability of the grown crystal...|$|R

40|$|In textile {{chemical}} processing industries vat dye {{is one of}} the important dyes for coloration of cotton, when high fastness properties are required. But, vat dye has the problem of insolubility in water. Hence, the process of vatting is needed to reduce and solubilize the dye in water. Vat dye is normally dissolved in water using sodium hydrosulphite (hydrose) as reducing agent and sodium hydroxide as solubilising agent suitable for dyeing. In this work, an attempt is made to reduce the vat dye using <b>ferrous</b> <b>sulphate</b> (2 % owm) and its combination with hydrose as <b>ferrous</b> <b>sulphate</b> (1. 5 % owm) +hydrose (0. 5 % owm) and <b>ferrous</b> <b>sulphate</b> (1 %owm) + hydrose (1 %owm). The effect of <b>ferrous</b> <b>sulphate</b> as reducing agent and its combination with hydrose is compared with the conventional reducing agent (hydrose). The effluent load is analysed for all samples and can be compared among themselves. The other test parameters like the strength of the fabric, rubbing fastness, washing fastness, and light fastness, were also studied and compared...|$|R
