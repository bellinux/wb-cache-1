5|$|From {{a modern}} perspective, {{we say that}} QED is not well defined as <b>a</b> <b>quantum</b> field theory to {{arbitrarily}} high energy. The coupling constant runs to infinity at finite energy, signalling a Landau pole. The problem is essentially that QED appears to suffer from quantum triviality issues.

5|$|Renormalizability {{has become}} an {{essential}} criterion for <b>a</b> <b>quantum</b> field theory to {{be considered as a}} viable one.

5|$|With the {{development}} of modern quantum mechanical theories of electron configurations within atoms, {{it became apparent that}} each period (row) in the table corresponded to the filling of <b>a</b> <b>quantum</b> shell of electrons.

5|$|Another {{important}} theoretical {{idea that}} {{plays a role}} in M-theory is supersymmetry. This is a mathematical relation that exists in certain physical theories between a class of particles called bosons and a class of particles called fermions. Roughly speaking, fermions are the constituents of matter, while bosons mediate interactions between particles. In theories with supersymmetry, each boson has a counterpart which is a fermion, and vice versa. When supersymmetry is imposed as a local symmetry, one automatically obtains <b>a</b> <b>quantum</b> mechanical theory that includes gravity. Such a theory is called a supergravity theory.|$|E

5|$|One {{approach}} to formulating M-theory and studying its properties {{is provided by}} the anti-de Sitter/conformal field theory (AdS/CFT) correspondence. Proposed by Juan Maldacena in late 1997, the AdS/CFT correspondence is a theoretical result which implies that M-theory is in some cases equivalent to <b>a</b> <b>quantum</b> field theory. In addition to providing insights into the mathematical structure of string and M-theory, the AdS/CFT correspondence has shed light on many aspects of quantum field theory in regimes where traditional calculational techniques are ineffective.|$|E
5|$|The {{chemical}} elements are often {{displayed in a}} periodic table that is laid out to display recurring chemical properties, and elements with {{the same number of}} valence electrons form a group that is aligned in the same column of the table.

5|$|The proton, the electron, and {{the neutron}} are {{classified}} as fermions. Fermions obey the Pauli exclusion principle which prohibits identical fermions, such as multiple protons, from occupying the same quantum state at the same time.

40|$|The goal of {{the thesis}} was to study {{fundamental}} structural and optical properties of InAs islands and In(Ga) <b>As</b> <b>quantum</b> rings. The research was carried out at the Department of Micro and Nanosciences of Helsinki University of Technology. A good surface quality can be essential for the potential applications in optoelectronic devices. For such device applications it is usually necessary to control size, density and arrangement of the islands. In order to study the dependence of the structural properties of the islands and the quantum rings on growth conditions, atomic force microscope was used. Obtained results reveal that the size and {{the density of the}} In(Ga) <b>As</b> <b>quantum</b> rings strongly depend on the growth temperature, the annealing time and the thickness of the partial capping layer. From obtained results it is possible to conclude that to get round shape islands and high density one has to use growth temperature of 500 ̊C. In the case of formation of In(Ga) <b>As</b> <b>quantum</b> rings the effect of mobility anisotropy is observed that so the shape of the rings is not symmetric. To exclude this effect it is preferable to use a higher annealing temperature of 570 ̊C. Optical properties were characterized by PL spectroscopy.
