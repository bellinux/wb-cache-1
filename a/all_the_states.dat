Magoffin proposed a conference of slave states, followed by a conference of <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>states</b> to secure the concessions.

5|$|The {{years of}} {{conflict}} which {{resulted from the}} Theban attempts to reorganise Greece had left {{much of the country}} war-weary and exhausted; a general peace (excluding only a recalcitrant Sparta) was therefore concluded between <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>states</b> of Greece in the aftermath of Mantinea. With the death of Epaminondas and significant loss of manpower at Mantinea, the Thebans returned to their more traditional defensive policy, and within a few years, Athens had replaced them at the pinnacle of the Greek political system, and Theban influence faded quickly in the rest of Greece. It was the Athenians, and their second confederacy, who would be Macedon's main rivals for control of the lands of the north Aegean, and a major theme during the period was the regular state of war between Macedon and Athens.|$|E

5|$|Hall saw {{the double}} {{dissolution}} {{as an opportunity}} to capture senate seats in <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>states</b> across the nation, and the LM sought to create bases outside South Australia. On 18 November, a LM rally was held at Melbourne Town Hall to launch a branch in Victoria. A branch was formed in Queensland and Hall travelled to Western Australia to oversee the formation of a state branch. Generally, the LM's attempts to spread its message failed owing to the dramatic and highly polarising effects of Whitlam's dismissal and the constitutional crisis, which produced angry demonstrations around the country. Amid the tumult, the media was almost completely focused on the two main parties, giving other groups almost no opportunities to capture the public imagination. The LM also found it difficult to establish a connection with the populace outside South Australia owing to its formation within a state-specific backdrop.|$|E
5|$|In 195 BC, Titus Quinctius Flamininus, the Roman {{commander}} in Greece, called a {{council of the}} Greek states at Corinth to discuss {{whether or not to}} declare war on Nabis. Among the states whose delegates participated were the Aetolian League, Macedon, Rome, Pergamum, Rhodes, Thessaly and the Achaean League. <b>All</b> <b>the</b> <b>states</b> represented favored war, except for the Aetolian League and Thessaly, both of which wanted the Romans to leave Greece immediately. These two states offered to deal with Nabis themselves, but they met opposition from the Achaean League, which objected to any possible growth in the Aetolian League's power. The modern historian Erich Gruen has suggested that the Romans may have used the war as an excuse to station a few legions in Greece in order to prevent the Spartans and the Aetolian League from joining the Seleucid King Antiochus III if he invaded Greece.|$|E
