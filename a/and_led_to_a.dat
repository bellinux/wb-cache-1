5|$|According to Dance, Clemens was {{requested}} by 20th Century Fox as a love interest for Ellen Ripley. Director David Fincher initially intended to reunite Paul McGann, Richard E. Grant and Ralph Brown (from Withnail and I) with Grant playing Clemens, but Grant declined the role. Despite Alien 3 poor critical reception, Dance {{said in a}} 2014 Daily Beast interview that he considered the film superior to Aliens and its potential was hampered by 20th Century Fox. According to the actor, his role as Clemens exposed him to American audiences <b>and</b> <b>led</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> prominent role as Tywin Lannister in Game of Thrones.|$|E
5|$|Although {{its surface}} {{circulation}} had dissipated, its circulation aloft remained intact <b>and</b> <b>led</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> burst of rainfall early on August 20. The 11.94inches/303.3mm that fell at Miller became the wettest Missouri rainfall total {{associated with a}} tropical cyclone, or its remains, since at least 1972. One person died in Sleeper when he drove into flood waters which had swept away a bridge he was attempting to navigate onto. Nine water rescues occurred along the I-44 corridor, mostly caused by Erin's rainfall. Damage totaled about $19.8million (2007USD) in the state, primarily in Polk County.|$|E
5|$|As Mormonism gained {{popularity}} in the Pacific, church-sponsored schools became more common. The Makeke School, founded by Coombs in the 1920s, became {{the foundation for the}} later established Liahona College. The church leased 276 acres near Nuku'alofa. The Liahona School opened in 1952 <b>and</b> <b>led</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> great expansion of the church. The Liahona School was intended to allow for more students with more hired faculty members and a broader curriculum. The education provided to Tongan students prepared them for life outside of Tonga, whether it was pursuing a secondary education or a job in America. Today, the school is known as Liahona High School.|$|E
50|$|The {{events of}} 1877 gave American workers a class {{consciousness}} on <b>a</b> national scale, <b>and</b> <b>led</b> <b>to</b> <b>an</b> increasing polarization of American society.|$|R
50|$|In United States v. Binion malingering or feigning illness {{during a}} {{competency}} evaluation {{was held to}} be obstruction of justice <b>and</b> <b>led</b> <b>to</b> <b>an</b> increased sentence.|$|R
30|$|Alternatively, {{we could}} have omitted these observations. However, such a {{restriction}} could have biased the investigation because invalid treatments may have related <b>to</b> re-starters <b>and</b> <b>led</b> <b>to</b> <b>an</b> underrepresentation of unsuccessful cases.|$|R
5|$|Between World WarI and World WarII Australia {{suffered}} {{greatly from}} the Great Depression {{which started in}} 1929. This limited Australian defence expenditure <b>and</b> <b>led</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> decline in the size and effectiveness {{of the armed forces}} during the 1930s. In 1931, the Statute of Westminster granted the Australian government independence in foreign affairs and defence. Nevertheless, from the mid-1930s, Australian governments generally followed British policy towards Nazi Germany, supporting first the appeasement of Hitler and the British guarantee of Polish independence.|$|E
5|$|Built {{on a site}} long {{favored by}} pre-Columbian peoples, Lock Haven began in 1833 as a timber town and a haven for loggers, boatmen, and other {{travelers}} on the river or the West Branch Canal. Resource extraction and efficient transportation financed much of the city's growth {{through the end of}} the 19thcentury. In the 20thcentury, a light-aircraft factory, a college, and a paper mill, along with many smaller enterprises, drove the economy. Frequent floods, especially in 1972, damaged local industry <b>and</b> <b>led</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> high rate of unemployment in the 1980s.|$|E
5|$|During the 1970s, UK and France were {{developing}} a new aircraft which could fill the RAF tactical strike and reconnaissance missions: the SEPECAT Jaguar was introduced into service in 1974, <b>and</b> <b>led</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> re-think of the Phantom's role as, at the same time, {{the limitations of the}} Lightning as an interceptor were becoming more apparent. The conversion of the RAF's FGR.2 squadrons to operate the Jaguar, combined with its use of the Blackburn Buccaneer, meant {{that it was possible to}} begin transferring Phantoms to operate purely as interceptors in the air defence role.|$|E
50|$|The final Comecon council session {{took place}} on June 28, 1991, in Budapest, <b>and</b> <b>led</b> <b>to</b> <b>an</b> {{agreement}} <b>to</b> disband within 90 days. The Soviet Union itself was dismantled on December 26, 1991.|$|R
5000|$|His next release, in 2002, the [...] "Negative Vibes EP" [...] {{featured}} Sinéad O'Connor on {{the title}} track <b>and</b> <b>led</b> <b>to</b> <b>an</b> invitation <b>to</b> support Sinéad on her 2002/2003 Irish, UK, and European tour.|$|R
50|$|In 2005, Pa'gan Amum {{was part}} of Dr. Garang's team that {{negotiated}} the comprehensive peace agreement (CPA), which brought <b>to</b> <b>an</b> end the Sudanese Civil War <b>and</b> <b>led</b> <b>to</b> <b>an</b> historic, internationally supervised referendum in 2011.|$|R
5|$|During the 19th and 20th centuries tourism {{developed}} {{based on}} the rise of antiquarianism, the association with the abbey and mysticism of the town. This was aided by accessibility via the rail and road network, which has continued to support the town's economy <b>and</b> <b>led</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> steady rise in resident population since 1801.|$|E
5|$|Following Indian {{independence}} in 1947, Kalimpong {{became part of}} the state of West Bengal, after Bengal was partitioned between India and East Pakistan. With China's annexation of Tibet in 1959, many Buddhist monks fled Tibet and established monasteries in Kalimpong. These monks brought many rare Buddhist scriptures with them. In 1962, the permanent closure of the Jelep Pass after the Sino-Indian War disrupted trade between Tibet and India, <b>and</b> <b>led</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> slowdown in Kalimpong's economy. In 1976, the visiting Dalai Lama consecrated the Zang Dhok Palri Phodang monastery, which houses many of the scriptures.|$|E
5|$|In 2011, {{a council}} {{gardening}} scheme created a horticultural landscape {{next to the}} southern end of the M32. The project included planting of red poppies, cornflowers, and marigolds. A spokesman said they hoped it would enhance the view from the motorway and provide additional habitats for wildlife including bees and butterflies. The gardens were well-received by locals <b>and</b> <b>led</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> city-wide project called Meadow Bristol, to grow similar meadows elsewhere.|$|E
50|$|The {{effect on}} local {{agriculture}} was significant <b>and</b> <b>led</b> <b>to</b> <b>an</b> export boom <b>and</b> {{the effect on}} the agricultural community was substantial and Broge was awarded an honorary membership of the Aarhus Agricultural Association (Århus landboforening).|$|R
25|$|In the 16th {{century the}} abbey was raided by Calvinist groups, which {{scattered}} {{many of the}} old books. In 1530, abbot Diethelm began a restoration that stopped the decline <b>and</b> <b>led</b> <b>to</b> <b>an</b> expansion of the schools and library.|$|R
50|$|The {{distribution}} of the proposal was not planned, merely a coincidence. The Time's article validated Lyon's proposal <b>and</b> <b>led</b> <b>to</b> <b>an</b> auction for his book. He has retained the film rights for the book, although none is planned at this time.|$|R
5|$|Many of the {{existing}} feuds were settled following the event. Notably, Batista was drafted to the SmackDown! brand, thus ending his feud with Triple H. The feud between Kane and Edge also concluded after the event, as Edge entered an angle with Matt Hardy. The feud between Cena and Jericho, however, continued <b>and</b> <b>led</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> match at SummerSlam, which Cena won.|$|E
5|$|Several {{developments}} in the 1900s improved the outcome for those with pneumonia. With the advent of penicillin and other antibiotics, modern surgical techniques, and intensive care in the 20th century, mortality from pneumonia, which had approached 30%, dropped precipitously in the developed world. Vaccination of infants against Haemophilus influenzae type B began in 1988 <b>and</b> <b>led</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> dramatic decline in cases shortly thereafter. Vaccination against Streptococcus pneumoniae in adults began in 1977, and in children in 2000, resulting in a similar decline.|$|E
5|$|Shoe {{manufacturing}} {{improvements in}} the mid-19th century allowed for factories to produce large numbers of shoes made of leather, and later synthetic materials. This increase in leather shoe production continued well into the 20th century <b>and</b> <b>led</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> surge {{in the number of}} retail shoe stores in the industrialized world, and subsequently a call for shoe polish by footwear consumers.|$|E

50|$|Born Mabel Croft in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, she {{originally}} studied painting. Her landscapes were noticed at <b>an</b> exhibition <b>and</b> <b>led</b> <b>to</b> <b>an</b> offer <b>to</b> {{appear in}} films. Ballin appeared in 28 films between 1917 and 1925. She achieved popularity during World War I.|$|R
50|$|The El Escorial Conspiracy (Spanish:Conspiración-proceso de El Escorial) was an {{attempted}} coup d'état {{led by the}} Crown Prince Fernando of Asturias {{that took place in}} 1807, but was quickly discovered <b>and</b> <b>led</b> <b>to</b> <b>an</b> investigation known as the Process of El Escorial.|$|R
5|$|The 1990s {{brought the}} {{addition}} of the Wild Mouse, the only Wild Mouse roller coaster designed by Dutch company Vekoma. The roller coaster was built in 1985 and had previously operated at Wiener Prater in Austria and Alton Towers in England, before opening at Idlewild in 1993. Kennywood continued the Macdonald tradition of offering large-scale entertainment, presenting circuses, lumberjack and acrobatics shows, and stage performances at the new Hillside Theater. A large picnic area with several log pavilions and game fields was added in 1999. In {{the early years of the}} 21stcentury, additions to the waterpark doubled its size <b>and</b> <b>led</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> new name, Idlewild and Soak Zone.|$|E
5|$|The Pulaski {{station was}} {{proposed}} in 1980 and constructed from 1987 to 1993. When the station opened in 1993, it spurred commercial {{development in the}} surrounding area <b>and</b> <b>led</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> parking controversy on nearby residential streets. Pulaski consists of an elevated island platform above a station house which is set back from Pulaski Road. The station also includes a bus terminal and a park and ride lot. Nearly 1.4 million passengers boarded Orange Line trains at Pulaski in 2010. Trains serve Pulaski approximately every ten minutes during rush hour but are less frequent at other times. In addition to offering train service, Pulaski also connects to several CTA bus routes.|$|E
5|$|The South Staffordshire Railway reached Brownhills in 1850 <b>and</b> <b>led</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> huge {{expansion}} of the local mining operation and with it a population explosion in the area, with the population increasing from 305 in 1801 to over 13,000 in 1891. In 1858 a branch line was constructed {{through the heart of}} what was then the hamlet of Brownhills, which led to a migration of the population eastwards, leading to the formation of mining slums in the Ogley Hay area. Eventually a new town centre developed, complete with library and theatre. This led to the gradual amalgamation of Brownhills, Ogley Hay and Catshill into one town.|$|E
50|$|The {{campaign}} {{succeeded in}} changing {{public opinion and}} sparked <b>an</b> international controversy <b>and</b> <b>led</b> <b>to</b> <b>an</b> announcement by James Dobson, head of Focus on the Family, {{that he had a}} dog named Sherman, who barks, because God intended for dogs to bark.|$|R
50|$|This {{concept was}} {{investigated}} by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and the United States Attorney, <b>and</b> <b>led</b> <b>to</b> <b>an</b> indictment of company executives. Although all charges were eventually dropped, the negative publicity destroyed the company and halted production of the car.|$|R
50|$|Summerhill {{received}} most of {{its public}} attention in two waves: the 1920s/30s and 1960s/70s. In particular, the 1960 American edition of Neill's writings, Summerhill, made the school into an example for <b>a</b> wide public, <b>and</b> <b>led</b> <b>to</b> <b>an</b> American movement with copycat schools.|$|R
5|$|The {{expanding}} {{population of}} Scandinavia {{led to a}} shortage of available resources and arable land there <b>and</b> <b>led</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> period of Viking expansion, the Norse gradually shifting their attention from plundering to invasion. Shetland was colonised during the late 8th and 9th centuries, {{the fate of the}} existing indigenous population being uncertain. Modern Shetlanders have almost identical proportions of Scandinavian matrilineal and patrilineal genetic ancestry, suggesting that the islands were settled by both men and women in equal measure.|$|E
5|$|The high-altitude explosions {{that had}} caused so much concern for Nike Zeus due to {{blackout}} had been further studied in the early 1960s <b>and</b> <b>led</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> new possibility for missile defense. When a nuclear warhead explodes in a dense atmosphere, its initial high-energy X-rays ionize the air, blocking other X-rays. In the highest layers of the atmosphere, there is too little gas for this to occur, and the X-rays can travel long distances. Sufficient X-ray exposure to an RV can damage its heat shields.|$|E
5|$|The inn {{was first}} {{licensed}} in 1844 {{and was at}} first successful. In only a few decades its fortunes declined when a rail line was built from Launceston, reaching nearby Carrick in 1869. The economy of rail transport took goods and passengers away, forcing wagons from the road. This reduced the demand for coaching inns, <b>and</b> <b>led</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> general decline in traffic through and business in the town. As of 2004 it was run as a restaurant and, after a 2008 refurbishment, {{has been used for}} accommodation and a cooking school.|$|E
25|$|In February 1959, Macmillan {{visited the}} Soviet Union. Talks with Nikita Khrushchev eased {{tensions}} in East-West relations over West Berlin <b>and</b> <b>led</b> <b>to</b> <b>an</b> {{agreement in principle}} to stop nuclear tests and <b>to</b> hold <b>a</b> further summit meeting of Allied and Soviet heads of government.|$|R
50|$|One day Walt and Don {{are taken}} alone {{to the nearby}} Ainsath city <b>and</b> <b>led</b> <b>to</b> <b>an</b> old woman, who reads from a book that mimics Genesis up to the Tower of Babel and then {{deviates}} from it. The Ainsath are Terrans, displaced millennia ago.|$|R
5000|$|Executive Order 12958 {{created new}} {{standards}} for the process of identifying and protecting classified information, <b>and</b> <b>led</b> <b>to</b> <b>an</b> unprecedented effort <b>to</b> declassify millions of pages from the U.S. diplomatic and national security history. In 1995, United States President Bill Clinton signed this Executive Order.|$|R
