5|$|Mud plume feeding is <b>a</b> <b>feeding</b> {{technique}} {{performed by}} a small community of bottlenose dolphins over shallow seagrass beds (less than 1 m) in the Florida Keys in the United States. The behavior involves creation of a U-shaped plume of mud {{in the water column}} and then rushing through the plume to capture fish.|$|E
5|$|While {{the long}} neck has {{traditionally}} been interpreted as <b>a</b> <b>feeding</b> adaptation, it was also suggested that the oversized neck of Diplodocus and its relatives may have been primarily a sexual display, with any other feeding benefits coming second.

5|$|Groups often {{form when}} {{individuals}} converge on a food source, whereupon <b>a</b> <b>feeding</b> frenzy may occur. This {{seems to be}} triggered not by blood in the water or by bloodlust, but by the species' highly strung and goal-directed nature (conserving energy between infrequent feeding opportunities {{when it is not}} slowly plying the open ocean). The oceanic whitetip is a competitive, opportunistic predator that exploits the resource at hand, rather than avoiding trouble in favour of a possibly easier future meal.|$|E
5|$|In March 2000, the Schindlers filed {{a motion}} to permit {{assisted}} feeding of Terri, which is not considered a life-prolonging procedure under Florida law. Since clinical records indicated that Terri Schiavo was not responsive to swallowing tests and required <b>a</b> <b>feeding</b> tube, Judge Greer ruled {{that she was not}} capable of orally ingesting sufficient nutrition and hydration to sustain life, and denied the request. The Medical Examiner in his postmortem report was more definitive and reaffirmed that Schiavo could not have swallowed.|$|E

In 2003, he underwent surgery for cancer in his salivary gland, which was followed up by radiation treatment. He was again afflicted with cancer in 2006. In June of that year, he had surgery to remove cancerous tissue near his right jaw. A week later he had a life-threatening complication when his carotid artery burst near the surgery site. He was confined to bed rest {{and was unable to}} speak, eat, or drink for a period of time, necessitating the use of <b>a</b> <b>feeding</b> tube.|$|E

50|$|There are {{two ways}} to cause the {{redirection}} of the beam from the antenna's midline. The first is referred to as <b>a</b> rotated <b>feed.</b> <b>As</b> its name suggests, <b>a</b> <b>feed</b> horn is set just off the parabolic focal point which causes the energy to focus slightly off the antenna midline. The feed is then rotated around {{the focal point of the}} paraboloid to produce the conical rotation. The other system is <b>a</b> nutated <b>feed.</b> <b>A</b> nutated <b>feed</b> offsets the antenna at an angle to <b>a</b> fixed <b>feed</b> horn, and then rotates the antenna. A variation of <b>a</b> nutated <b>feed</b> makes the <b>feed</b> move in <b>a</b> small circle, rapidly and continuously changing the pointing direction of the beam. In this latter type, neither the feed nor the antenna revolves around the pointing axis of the antenna; only the pointing direction changes, tracing out a narrow cone.|$|R
5|$|The New Holland honeyeater (Phylidonyris novaehollandiae) {{is a major}} visitor and {{pollinator}} of Banksia verticillata. These birds {{can travel}} 15m (50ft) between inflorescences in <b>a</b> <b>feeding</b> session, and preferentially choose flower spikes with partly opened flowers. Other honeyeater species observed, the white-cheeked honeyeater (Phylidonyris nigra) and western spinebill (Acanthorhynchus superciliosus), visit this species to a much lesser extent. The brown honeyeater (Lichmera indistincta) has also been recorded as a visitor. Small mammals are not major pollinators, although bush rats (Rattus fuscipes) and house mice (Mus musculus) have been recorded. Honey bees (Apis mellifera) visit flower spikes but are not effective pollinators.|$|E
5|$|Food {{is mostly}} {{selected}} by sight, even in conditions of dim light. Movement of the prey triggers <b>a</b> <b>feeding</b> response. Frogs {{have been caught}} on fish hooks baited with red flannel and green frogs (Rana clamitans) have been found with stomachs full of elm seeds that they had seen floating past. Toads, salamanders and caecilians also use smell to detect prey. This response is mostly secondary because salamanders have been observed to remain stationary near odoriferous prey but only feed if it moves. Cave-dwelling amphibians normally hunt by smell. Some salamanders seem to have learned to recognize immobile prey when it has no smell, even in complete darkness.|$|E
5|$|Grey reef sharks feed {{mainly on}} bony fishes, with {{cephalopods}} such as squid and octopus being the second-most important food group, and crustaceans such as crabs and lobsters {{making up the}} remainder. The larger sharks take {{a greater proportion of}} cephalopods. These sharks hunt individually or in groups, and have been known to pin schools of fish against the outer walls of coral reefs for feeding. They excel at capturing fish swimming in the open, and they complement hunting whitetip reef sharks, which are more adept at capturing fish inside caves and crevices. Their sense of smell is extremely acute, being capable of detecting one part tuna extract in 10 billion parts of sea water. In the presence of a large quantity of food, grey reef sharks may be roused into <b>a</b> <b>feeding</b> frenzy; in one documented frenzy caused by an underwater explosion that killed several snappers, one of the sharks involved was attacked and consumed by the others.|$|E

5|$|Immediately {{following}} the destructive tornadoes, Mississippi Governor Haley Barbour {{declared a state}} of emergency for 39counties. On April29, President Barack Obama signed a major disaster declaration for 29Mississippi counties in the wake of the Super Outbreak and another deadly outbreak on April15. This allowed residents and some local governments to sign up to receive federal funding to repair damage incurred from the storms. More than 60members of the Longino Baptist Church assisted residents of Neshoba County with debris removal and cleaning; also providing refreshments. The Salvation Army established <b>a</b> <b>feeding</b> center at the Coy Methodist Church. Disaster unemployment assistance was made available for people who lost their jobs due to storms and flooding, starting on May17. By July, a total of $15,734,072 in federal funding was approved through the Federal Emergency Management Agency for victims of the April15–28 storms.|$|E
5|$|Kristall {{contained}} furnaces for use {{in producing}} crystals under microgravity conditions (hence the choice of name for the module). The module was also equipped with biotechnology research equipment, including a small greenhouse for plant cultivation experiments which was equipped with a source of light and <b>a</b> <b>feeding</b> system, in addition to equipment for astronomical observations. The most obvious features of the module were the two Androgynous Peripheral Attach System (APAS-89) docking ports designed to be compatible with the Buran spacecraft. Although they were never used in a Buran docking, they were useful later during the Shuttle-Mir programme, providing a berthing location for US Space Shuttles.|$|E
5|$|Lung lesions, once identified, {{are usually}} treated to prevent episodes of {{bleeding}} {{and more importantly}} embolism to the brain. This is particularly done in lesions with <b>a</b> <b>feeding</b> blood vessel of 3mm or larger, as {{these are the most}} likely to cause long-term complications unless treated. The most effective current therapy is embolization with detachable metal coils. The procedure involves puncture of a large vein (usually under a general anesthetic), followed by advancing of a catheter through the right ventricle and into the pulmonary artery, after which radiocontrast is injected to visualize the AVMs (pulmonary angiography). Once the lesion has been identified, coils are deployed that obstruct the blood flow and allow the lesion to regress. In experienced hands, the procedure tends to be very effective and with limited side effects, but lesions may recur and further attempts may be required. CTA scans are repeated to monitor for recurrence. Surgical excision has now essentially been abandoned due to the success of embolotherapy.|$|E

5|$|Over 190 {{species of}} birds have been {{identified}} near the bay, some of which use it as <b>a</b> <b>feeding</b> ground during their migrations. Waders and wildfowl often over-winter on the reserve. The populations of whimbrel (Numenius phaeopus) and black-tailed godwit (Limosa limosa) are internationally important. Significant populations of dunlin (Calidris alpina) and wigeon (Anas penelope) also frequent the bay. In early winter the wigeon select Puccinellia maritima in preference to Agrostis stolonifera and Festuca rubra. Avocets have become regular autumn and winter visitors to the area in recent years, favouring the lower reaches of the River Parrett, and, {{for the first time}} in over 50 years, bred on the reserve in 2012.|$|E
5|$|Some bats prey on vertebrates, such as fish, frogs, lizards, {{birds and}} mammals. The fringe-lipped bat (Trachops cirrhosus,) for example, is {{particularly}} skilled at catching frogs. These bats locate {{large groups of}} frogs by tracking their mating calls, then plucking them {{from the surface of}} the water with their sharp canine teeth. Another example is the greater noctule bat, which can catch birds in flight. Some species, like the greater bulldog bat (Noctilio leporinus) hunt fish. They use echolocation to detect small ripples on the water's surface, swoop down and use specially enlarged claws on their hind feet to grab the fish, then take their prey to <b>a</b> <b>feeding</b> roost and consume it. At least two species of bat are known to feed on other bats: the spectral bat, also known as the American false vampire bat, and the ghost bat of Australia.|$|E
5|$|The {{majority}} of Mysida are omnivores, feeding on algae, detritus, and zooplankton. Scavenging and cannibalism are also common, with the adults sometimes preying on their young once they {{emerge from the}} marsupium. The pelagic and most other species are filter feeders, creating <b>a</b> <b>feeding</b> current with the exopods of their pereopods. This wafts food particles into a ventral food groove along which they are passed before being filtered by setae (bristles) on the second maxillae. Larger planktonic prey can be caught in a trap composed of the endopods of the thoracic appendages. Some benthic species, especially members of the subfamily Erythropinae, have been observed feeding on small particles which they collected by grooming the surfaces of their bodies and legs.|$|E

5|$|There {{have been}} several {{theories}} proposed for why the phylloxera was ignored as the possible cause of the disease {{that resulted in the}} failure of so many vineyards, most of which involve the feeding behaviour of the insect, and the way it attacks the roots. The proboscis of the grape phylloxera has both a venom canal from which it injects its deadly venom and <b>a</b> <b>feeding</b> tube through which it takes in vine sap and nutrients. As the toxin from the venom corrodes the root structure of a vine, the sap pressure falls and, as a result, the Phylloxera quickly withdraws its feeding tube and searches for another source of food. Thus, anyone digging up a diseased and dying vine will not find Phylloxera clinging to the roots of the plant.|$|E
5|$|Weight {{loss and}} eating {{difficulties}} due to dysphagia and other muscle discoordination are common, making nutrition management increasingly {{important as the}} disease advances. Thickening agents {{can be added to}} liquids as thicker fluids are easier and safer to swallow. Reminding the affected person to eat slowly and to take smaller pieces of food into the mouth may also be of use to prevent choking. If eating becomes too hazardous or uncomfortable, the option of using a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy is available. This is <b>a</b> <b>feeding</b> tube, permanently attached through the abdomen into the stomach, which reduces the risk of aspirating food and provides better nutritional management. Assessment and management by speech-language pathologists with experience in Huntington's disease is recommended.|$|E
5|$|Western jackdaws are voluble birds. The main call, {{frequently}} {{given in}} flight, is a metallic and squeaky chyak-chyak or kak-kak. This is a contact or greeting call. <b>A</b> <b>feeding</b> call made by adults to call young, or males when offering food to their mates, has been transcribed as kiaw or kyow. Females in return give a more drawn out version when begging for food from males, written as kyaay, tchaayk or giaaaa. Perched birds often chatter together, and before settling for the night, large roosting flocks make a cackling noise. Western jackdaws {{also have a}} hoarse, drawn-out alarm call, arrrrr or kaaaarr, used when warning of predators or when mobbing them. Nestlings begin making a soft cheep at about a week of age. As they grow, their voice becomes louder until their call is a penetrating screech around day 18. After this, the voice deepens and softens. From day 25, the young cease calling and become silent if they hear an unfamiliar noise. The European jackdaw can be trained to imitate human speech.|$|E
