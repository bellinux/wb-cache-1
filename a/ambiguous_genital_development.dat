40|$|Abstract Introduction Many fetal malformations {{can occur}} because of {{maternal}} diabetes. However, <b>ambiguous</b> <b>genital</b> organs {{have never been}} reported as an associated finding in the literature. This is the first report of associated <b>ambiguous</b> <b>genital</b> organ and bilateral adrenal hyperplasia {{in a case of}} diabetic fetopathy. Case presentation A 19 -year-old Thai primigravida with familial history of diabetes mellitus (DM) was diagnosed as having gestational DM type 2, based on 100 g oral glucose tolerance test, and was poorly controlled with insulin injections. Delayed targeted ultrasonography at 28 weeks gestation revealed multiple fetal anomalies. The woman underwent low transverse cesarean section at 30 weeks gestation due to preterm labor and transverse lie. The newborn with ambiguous genitalia was delivered but expired after birth. Autopsy findings revealed alobar holoprosencephaly, a prominent forehead, hypotelorism, an absent nose, absent bilateral ears, median cleft lip and palate, preaxial polydactyly of the right hand, accessory spleens, single umbilical artery, markedly enlarged adrenal glands and ambiguous external genitalia The subsequent fetal chromosomal study revealed 46,XX. Conclusion We describe a case of diabetic fetopathy with classic facial malformation and preaxial hallucal polydactyly which has been proposed as a marker of diabetic embryopathy. Bilateral adrenal hyperplasia with ambiguous genitalia, an uncommon associated anomaly, was also identified. It is controversial whether adrenal hyperplasia can be a novel feature of diabetic fetopathy or just a coincidental finding. Further observation and adequate investigation are needed in such cases. </p...|$|R

40|$|Objectives: To {{identify}} ages when {{adolescents were}} in sexual maturity stages 2 through 5; {{to explain the}} relations between breast (girls), genital (boys), and pubic hair (girls and boys) development between ages 9 and 15 years; and to evaluate synchrony of pubertal development across characteristics. Design Annual pubertal assessments. Setting Ten locations in the United States. Participants A total of 859 adolescents (427 boys [49. 7 %] and 432 girls [50. 3 %]; 737 white [85. 8 %] and 122 black [14. 2 %]). Main Outcome Measures Changes in the 5 stages of breast, genital, and pubic hair development. Results Girls were in breast maturity stages 2 and 3 earlier than comparable pubic hair stages. Although breast development in girls started earlier than pubic hair development, girls completed breast and pubic hair development at approximately the same age. Black girls were in all stages of breast and pubic hair development earlier than white girls. Boys were in stages 2, 3, 4, and 5 of <b>genital</b> <b>development</b> before the comparable pubic hair stage. In boys, <b>genital</b> <b>development</b> started earlier than pubic hair development, but pubic hair development was completed in less time. Black boys were in genital and pubic hair development about 7 months earlier than white boys. Black and white boys completed <b>genital</b> <b>development</b> in approximately 4 years, but black boys took approximately 6 months longer than white boys to complete pubic hair development. At stage 2, for 66. 2 % of girls, breast development preceded their pubic hair development; for 91. 1 % of boys, <b>genital</b> <b>development</b> preceded their pubic hair development. Conclusions The {{results of this study}} are useful in understanding normative variation in the timing and change in the development of secondary sexual characteristics at puberty.

40|$|AbstractExternal <b>genital</b> <b>development</b> {{begins with}} {{formation}} of paired genital swellings, which develop into the genital tubercle. Proximodistal outgrowth and axial patterning of the genital tubercle are coordinated to {{give rise to}} the penis or clitoris. The genital tubercle consists of lateral plate mesoderm, surface ectoderm, and endodermal urethral epithelium derived from the urogenital sinus. We have investigated the molecular control of external <b>genital</b> <b>development</b> in the mouse embryo. Previous work {{has shown that the}} genital tubercle has polarizing activity, but the precise location of this activity within the tubercle is unknown. We reasoned that if the tubercle itself is patterned by a specialized signaling region, then polarizing activity may be restricted to a subset of cells. Transplantation of urethral epithelium, but not genital mesenchyme, to chick limbs results in mirror-image duplication of the digits. Moreover, when grafted to chick limbs, the urethral plate orchestrates morphogenetic movements normally associated with external <b>genital</b> <b>development.</b> Signaling activity is therefore restricted to urethral plate cells. Before and during normal genital tubercle outgrowth, urethral plate epithelium expresses Sonic hedgehog (Shh). In mice with a targeted deletion of Shh, external genitalia are absent. Genital swellings are initiated, but outgrowth is not maintained. In the absence of Shh signaling, Fgf 8, Bmp 2, Bmp 4, Fgf 10, and Wnt 5 a are downregulated, and apoptosis is enhanced in the genitalia. These results identify the urethral epithelium as a signaling center of the genital tubercle, and demonstrate that Shh from the urethral epithelium is required for outgrowth, patterning, and cell survival in the developing external genitalia...|$|R
40|$|In {{mammalian}} embryos, {{male and}} female external genitalia develop from the genital tubercle. Outgrowth of the genital tubercle is maintained by the urethral epithelium, {{and it has been}} reported that Fgf 8 mediates this activity. To test directly whether Fgf 8 is required for external <b>genital</b> <b>development,</b> we conditionally removed Fgf 8 from the cloacal/urethral epithelium. Surprisingly, Fgf 8 is not necessary for initiation, outgrowth or normal patterning of the external genitalia. In early genital tubercles, we found no redundant Fgf expression in the urethral epithelium, which contrasts with the situation in the apical ectodermal ridge (AER) of the limb. Analysis of Fgf 8 pathway activity showed that four putative targets are either absent from early genital tubercles or are not regulated by Fgf 8. We therefore examined the distribution of Fgf 8 protein and report that, although it is present in the AER, Fgf 8 is undetectable in the genital tubercle. Thus, Fgf 8 is transcribed, but the signaling pathway is not activated during normal <b>genital</b> <b>development.</b> A phylogenetic survey of amniotes revealed Fgf 8 expression in genital tubercles of eutherian and metatherian mammals, but not turtles or alligators, indicating that Fgf 8 expression is neither a required nor a conserved feature of amniote external <b>genital</b> <b>development.</b> The results indicate that Fgf 8 expression is an early readout of the genital initiation signal rather than the signal itself. We propose that induction of external genitalia involves an epithelial-epithelial interaction at the cloacal membrane, and suggest that the cloacal ectoderm may be the source of the genital initiation signal...|$|R

The purposes were: (1) to follow the alterations in regional body adiposity during genital development; (2) to reveal the differences in fat patterning of athletes and non-athletes, (3) to analyze the influence of genital maturation and sport activity on the indices of fatness in pubertal boys. The subjects were athlete (n= 803) and non-athlete (n= 989) boys. They were grouped by the stages of <b>genital</b> <b>development.</b> Regional fat distribution was examined {{on the basis of}} skinfolds. The amount of subcutaneous and visceral abdominal adipose tissues was assessed by regression equations of Brambilla and co-workers. The effect of <b>genital</b> <b>development</b> and sport activity on fat compartments was studied by multivariate ANOVA. The centralization tendency in adipose tissue was revealed by the progressing of <b>genital</b> <b>development.</b> Non-athletes accumulated more relative subcutaneous fat on their extremities, while athletes did it on their trunk. Adjusted to the absolute body fat mass, visceral adipose tissue increased faster in athletes than in non-athletes. The multivariate model proved that genital maturation affected the regional fat distribution. During sexual maturation the regional apposition trend of body fat was similar for athletes and non-athletes. The differences between athletes’ and non-athletes’ fat pattering emerged in the relative distributions. The relatively thicker fat layer on the trunk served better the extended energy supply for athletes. The effect of sexual maturation was the largest on the visceral adipose tissue, while sport activity influenced the subcutaneous adipose tissue better on the extremities...|$|R

40|$|The {{development}} of male- or female-specific phenotypes in squamates is typically controlled by either temperature-dependent sex determination (TSD) or chromosome-based genetic sex determination (GSD). However, while sex determination {{is a major}} switch in individual phenotypic development, it is unknownhow evolutionary transitions between GSD and TSD might impact {{on the evolution of}} squamate phenotypes, particularly the fast-evolving and diverse genitalia. Here, we take the unique opportunity of studying the impact of both sex determination mechanisms on the embryological {{development of}} the central bearded dragon (Pogona vitticeps). This is possible because of the transitional sex determination system of this species, in which genetically male individuals reverse sex at high incubation temperatures. This can trigger the evolutionary transition of GSD to TSD in a single generation, making P. vitticeps an ideal model organism for comparing the effects of both sex determination processes in the same species. We conducted four incubation experiments on 265 P. vitticeps eggs, covering two temperature regimes ("normal" at 28  °C and "sex reversing" at 36  °C) and the two maternal sexual genotypes (concordant ZW females or sex-reversed ZZ females). From this, we provide the first detailed staging system for the species, with a focus on <b>genital</b> and limb <b>development.</b> This was augmented by a new sex chromosome identification methodology for P. vitticeps that is non-destructive to the embryo. We found a strong correlation between embryo age and embryo stage. Aside from faster growth in 36  °C treatments, body and external <b>genital</b> <b>development</b> was entirely unperturbed by temperature, sex reversal or maternal sexual genotype. Unexpectedly, all females developed hemipenes (the genital phenotype of adult male P. vitticeps), which regress close to hatching. The tight correlation between embryo age and embryo stage allows the precise targeting of specific developmental periods in the emerging field of molecular research on P. vitticeps. The stability of <b>genital</b> <b>development</b> in all treatments suggests that the two sex-determining mechanisms have little impact on genital evolution, despite their known role in triggering <b>genital</b> <b>development.</b> Hemipenis retention in developing female P. vitticeps, together with frequent occurrences of hemipenis-like structures during development in other squamate species, raises the possibility of a bias towards hemipenis formation in the ancestral developmental programme for squamate genitalia...|$|R
