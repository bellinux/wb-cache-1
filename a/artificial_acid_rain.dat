Two test methods of the permeability and the soak were used to investigate the variation of the physico-chemical behaviors of soils with precipitation of acid rain. Results indicated that there is a more significant effect of <b>artificial</b> <b>acid</b> <b>rain</b> on physico-chemical properties comparing with engineering properties. It is examined that the variations of all the physico-chemical properties such as the increase of pH values of the outflow and seepage water, increase of the cation concentration of the outflow and seepage water, decrease of pH values of the specimen and decrease of the exchangeable cation concentration were caused by ion-exchange reaction between the exchangeable cations of specimens and the H+ ions of acid rain. The concentration of water-soluble cation and the electric conductivity increased with continuing to permeate or soak, there is a larger rate of the increase in Kanto Loam than that in alluvial clay and decomposed granite soil.

Corrosive solutions for testing the corrosion velocity were 3. 5 % of the neutral sodium chloride solution, <b>artificial</b> <b>acid</b> <b>rain</b> (3. 5 % NaCl+H 2 SO 4 solution) and artificial sweat solution. The research {{results show that the}} corrosion of cold rolled strip occurs easily because grains stretched along the direction of deformation and the existence of residual stress. The maximum corrosion depth of cold-rolled strip is 94. 8 µm. Annealing treatment can effectively reduce the corrosion depth of alloy. Corrosion resistance of alloy rises with the increase of annealing temperature, because the recrystallization degree of alloy goes on more sufficient. The corrosion depth of samples annealed at 600 ℃ and 680 ℃ drops from 64. 45 µm to 56. 32 µm respectively. Aluminum content in the alloy also affects the corrosion resistance of the alloy, because oxygen oxidizes aluminum to density Al 2 O 3 film which prevents the further corrosion of the alloy.

Later, it was suggested that <b>acid</b> <b>rain</b> could lead to forest dieback over vast areas of Europe. Forests in the Netherlands could be at great risk, as well. It was clear to everyone what it was all about, for ‘rain’ means water falling from the atmosphere and the meaning of ‘acid’ was evident, too. <b>Acid</b> <b>rain</b> caused much commotion in the eighties but, since then, it has faded into the background. Why is it, that there is so little attention paid to <b>acid</b> <b>rain</b> these days? Maybe the <b>acid</b> <b>rain</b> problem was a hype; with an exaggerated reaction to a problem that was, in fact, insignificant. This article aims to reconstruct the history of one of the most prominent environmental problems of the twentieth century. The article describes the origin of the <b>acid</b> <b>rain</b> problem in the 1960 s and describes the scientific research that was carried out to develop a better understanding of the problem from an atmospheric chemical point of view. Subsequently, it treats the rise of public awareness in the seventies. The article subsequently focuses on the situation in the Netherlands. The initial research into forest health showed alarming results. This led to widespread concern within the Netherlands, which, once more, urged the government to come into action. Some measures to reduce air-polluting emissions were already taken in the early 1980 s. However, these were meant, mainly, to improve local air quality.

Methods Three gradients of simulated <b>acid</b> <b>rain</b> treatments were applied to the species: pH = 2. 5, 4. 0 and 5. 6. Tests were done in April, July and October of both 2007 and 2008. Important findings In the pH 2. 5 treatment, the relative chlorophyll content of C. sclerophylla seedlings was lowest during a short time, and there were significant differences between the pH 2. 5 and 5. 6 treatments (p < 0. 05). After a period of time for <b>acid</b> <b>rain</b> treatment processing, the relative chlorophyll content of C. sclerophylla seedlings was highest with pH 4. 0, indicating that <b>acid</b> <b>rain</b> of low concentrations would increase the relative chlorophyll content. In April 2007, the net photosynthetic rate (Pn), maximal photochemical efficiency of photosystem II (Fv/Fm) and potential activity of photosystem II (Fv/F 0) were almost unchanged under different <b>acid</b> <b>rain</b> treatments. With the extension of <b>acid</b> <b>rain</b> treatment, Pn, light compensation point (LCP), light saturation point(LSP) and dark respiration rate (Rd) were greatly reduced in the treatments with pH 2. 5, and there were significant differences between the treatments with pH 2. 5 and pH 5. 6 (p < 0. 05). The differences of Fv/Fm and Fv/F 0 between pH 2. 5 and 5. 6 were smaller than before. The changes of stomatal conductance (Gs) and apparent quantum yield (AQY) were not obvious.

There existed significant linear relationships between Cu or Zn release and Cd release. In the contaminated soils, however, Cd release increased logarithmically with increasing leaching amounts of simulated <b>acid</b> <b>rain,</b> but Cu release increased still in a linear way. Zn release was a linear patter when weak <b>acid</b> <b>rain</b> was applied, but a logarithmic one when strong <b>acid</b> <b>rain</b> was applied. There were non-linear relationships among releases of Cd, Cu and Zn. The release sequence of heavy metals in the contaminated red soils was Cd > Zn > > Cu. About 26 % - 76 % of external Cd and 11 % - 68 % of external Zn were released through leaching of <b>acid</b> <b>rain,</b> but more than 99 % of external Cu was absorbed by the soils. Meanwhile, accumulative release amounts of these three elements were all significantly logarithmically related to H+ accumulative amounts in the leachates, but only those of Cd and Zn were also logarithmically related to TOC (total organic carbon) accumulative amounts. The relationships between Cu release and TOC release were a power pattern. For the natural red soils, possibility of <b>acid</b> <b>rain</b> stimulating heavy metal contamination was little due to a small release amount of heavy metals; for the contaminated red soils, however, {{a great amount of}} heavy metals especially Cd and Zn were released under <b>acid</b> <b>rain,</b> and contamination with heavy metals in soil-plant systems was greatly possible...|$|R

The paper comprehensively researches on the <b>acid</b> <b>rain</b> sensitivity and quantitatively reveals its spatial features in Three Gorges Reservoir Area in Chongqing by using the integrated approach of GIS and RS spatial analysis function and the sensitivity mechanisms of <b>acid</b> <b>rain.</b> The results show that:(1) the strong sensitivity is the main type of the <b>acid</b> <b>rain</b> sensitivity which is 19 100. 57 km 2, about 41. 38 % of the study area and moderate sensitivity is second which is 13548. 52 km 2,about 29. 35 % of the study area. The extremely sensitivity areas mainly distribute in Wulong, Shizhu and Wanzhou. The sensitivity of <b>acid</b> <b>rain</b> in metropolitan areas are mainly slight and not sensitive (2) In space, the extremely sensitivity of <b>acid</b> <b>rain</b> mainly distribute in the middle and south area of the Three Gorges Reservoir area in Chongqing. The strong sensitivity mainly distribute in the northern east of the Three Gorges Reservoir area in Chongqing. The moderate sensitivity areas mainly distribute to the west of Wanzhou except Shizhu and Wulong. The slight sensitivity of <b>acid</b> <b>rain</b> distribute along the rivers and streams and some area of Wushan and Yunyang. (3) The relatively high sensitivity of the <b>acid</b> <b>rain</b> is distributed mainly in yellow soil, yellow brown soil, purple soil and evergreen deciduous forest, evergreen and deciduous broadleaved mixed forest...|$|R
