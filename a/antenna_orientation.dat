We use this formalism to develop analytic scaling results that describe how complexity can be controlled by varying key system parameters such as the transmit power and the directivity of transmissions in large-scale networks.

50|$|Polarization has {{not been}} taken into account so far, but {{properly}} it must be. When considering the dipole radiator previously we assumed that it was perfectly aligned with the receiver. Now assume, however, that the receiving antenna is circularly polarized, {{and there will be}} a minimum 3 dB polarization loss regardless of <b>antenna</b> <b>orientation.</b> If the receiver is also a dipole, it is possible to align it orthogonally to the transmitter such that theoretically zero energy is received. However, this polarization loss is not accounted for in the calculation of ERP or EIRP. Rather, the receiving system designer must account for this loss as appropriate. For example, a cellular telephone tower has a fixed linear polarization, but the mobile handset must function well at any arbitrary orientation. Therefore, a handset design might provide dual polarization receive on the handset so that captured energy is maximized regardless of orientation, or the designer might use a circularly polarized antenna and account for the extra 3 dB of loss with amplification.|$|E

We report results from field calibration and deployment tests of miniaturized proximity tags (Encounternet), digital transceivers that log encounters between tagged individuals. We examined radio signal behavior in relation to tag attach-ment (tag, tag on bird, tag on saline-filled balloon) to understand how radio signal strength {{is affected by the}} tag mounting technique used for calibration tests. We investigated inter-tag and inter-receiver station variability, and in each calibration test we accounted for the effects of <b>antennae</b> <b>orientation.</b> Additionally, we used data from a live deployment on breeding barn swallows (Hirundo rustica erythrogaster) to analyze the quality of the logs, including recipro-cal agreement in dyadic logs. We evaluated the impact (in terms of mass changes) of tag attachment on the birds. We were able to statistically distinguish between RSSI values associated with different close-proximity (< 5 m) tag-tag distances regardless of <b>antennae</b> <b>orientation.</b> Inter-tag variability was low, but we did find significant inter-receiver station vari-ability. Reciprocal agreement of dyadic logs was high and social networks were constructed from proximity tag logs based on two different RSSI thresholds. There was no evidence of significant mass loss in the time birds were wearing tags. We conclude that proximity log-gers are accurate and effective for quantifying social behavior. However, because RSSI and distance cannot be perfectly resolved, data from proximity loggers are most appropriate for comparing networks based on specific RSSI thresholds. The Encounternet system is flexible and customizable, and tags are now light enough for use on small animals (< 50 g) ...|$|R

In other words, position calculation is not required at beacons. When AOA estimates from three or more beacons are received, ambiguity occurs. Three resolution methods, namely (a) simple averaging (b) Minimax and (c) Precision-weighted averaging are proposed and compared.

We first experimentally verify that the <b>antenna</b> <b>orientation</b> has a large influence on the received signal strength by performing an extensive amount of measurements. As expected, these measurements show that the signal strength may vary more than a factor five under different antenna orientations. This paper shows that antenna orientations may decrease the performance of optimally calibrated RSS-based localization algorithms by as much as 32 %, from 1. 8 to 2. 65 meter. In addition, it shows that improper calibration of the <b>antenna</b> <b>orientation</b> may decrease the accuracy by 64 %, from 1. 9 to 3. 1 meter...|$|E

40|$|Ultra-wideband (UWB) {{transmission}} {{provides a}} fast local range wireless connection {{using the same}} frequency spectrum assigned to other narrowband communication standards. A precise knowledge of the indoor transmission channel is necessary to obtain high performance. Several channel models have been presented in the literature, but normally without considering the distortion effect caused by a real UWB antenna. A detailed antenna model shows that the radiation pattern varies with frequency, i. e., different receiver positions and <b>antenna</b> <b>orientations</b> result in different antenna frequency responses. In order to obtain a more uniform coverage over the indoor area, two transmitting antennas with orthogonal polarization can be used. The receiver can use a single <b>antenna</b> whose <b>orientation</b> and position is arbitrary within the coverage area, resulting in a special case of a 2 : 1 MISO system in which a space-time encoding is used at the transmitter. The target is to employ the polarization diversity to obtain a constant quality of symbol detection while the receiver moves around in the coverage area. The proposed polarization diversity scheme is applied in an UWB multiband scenario and it is compared to both a single antenna scheme and a classical space diversity scheme employing a single polarized antenna arra...|$|R

In this paper we study beamwidth/range tradeoffs for the <b>Antenna</b> <b>Orientation</b> Problem. Namely, for the full range of angles in the interval [0, 2 pi] we compare the antenna range provided by an orientation algorithm to the optimal possible for the given beamwidth. We propose new <b>antenna</b> <b>orientation</b> algorithms that ensure improved bounds for given angle ranges and analyze their complexity.

30|$|Yet another {{solution}} can {{be applied}} to mitigate the effect of unknown terminal <b>antenna</b> <b>orientation,</b> i.e., by making the terminal <b>antenna</b> <b>orientation</b> a part of the input feature vector, exclusively. Note that this would require some additional signalling from the terminal to the baseband unit, for which we do not here account for the overhead. The performance of this approach is shown as ‘solution 3 ’ in Fig.  9, where we observe that the performance of the proposed technique reaps off almost the same average system goodput as in case of ‘solution 1.’ Since we use the same number of features for random selection in building the decision trees in random forests model, the randomization of trees in the model results in the variation of the obtained system goodput, for the case when terminal <b>antenna</b> <b>orientation</b> is embedded or is exclusively incorporated as an input feature for training the random forests model, i.e., for ‘solution 1 ’ and ‘solution 3,’ respectively. We conclude with the remarkable observation that the random <b>antenna</b> <b>orientation</b> can basically deteriorate performance strongly; however, especially by including this effect in the training data, more robust MCS selections can be trained to compensate for this randomness.|$|E

In this paper we consider the problem of power-efficient topology control with switched beam directional antennas taking into account their non-uniform radiation pattern within the beamwidth. Previous work in the area have all assumed a uniform gain model with these antennas which renders <b>antenna</b> <b>orientation</b> insignificant as a parameter in topology control algorithms. We present algorithms that take into account a model of non-uniform gain with the objectives of minimizing the total power and maximum power to keep the network connected. We consider two cases: one where the <b>antenna</b> <b>orientation</b> is assumed given and another where the <b>antenna</b> <b>orientation</b> needs to be derived as well. For the first case, we present optimal and approximation algorithms for constructing power-efficient topologies. For the second case, we prove the problem to be NP-complete and present heuristic solutions along with approximation bounds. Through comparison of the two cases by simulation, significant reductions are shown in the maximum as well as total power required to keep the network connected for the second case, thus demonstrating the benefits of using <b>antenna</b> <b>orientation</b> as parameter in topology construction...|$|E
