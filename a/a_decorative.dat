The pattern, derived from local plants and flowers, is a traditional type commonly used in Belarus. These patterns are sometimes used in woven garments, most importantly in the traditional 'rushnyk', a woven cloth used for ceremonial events like religious services, funerals, and other more mundane social functions, such as a host offering guests bread and salt served on a rushnyk.|$|E

5|$|Architects who {{push the}} {{boundaries}} of design or construction sometimes create buildings that are entertaining because they exceed {{the expectations of the}} public and the client and are aesthetically outstanding. Buildings such as Guggenheim Museum Bilbao, designed by Frank Gehry, are of this type, becoming a tourist attraction as well as a significant international museum. Other apparently usable buildings are really follies, deliberately constructed for <b>a</b> <b>decorative</b> purpose and never intended to be practical.|$|E

5|$|Because silver was {{extensively}} used as <b>a</b> <b>decorative</b> {{material and}} an exchange medium, lead deposits {{came to be}} worked in Asia Minor since 3000BCE; later, lead deposits were developed in the Aegean and Laurion. These three regions collectively dominated production of mined lead until c. 1200BCE. Since 2000BCE, the Phoenicians worked deposits in the Iberian peninsula; by 1600BCE, lead mining existed in Cyprus, Greece, and Sardinia.|$|E

5|$|The Masonic Hall {{sits at the}} {{southern}} end of a terrace. It has a stucco front, with two pairs of Ionic pilasters; the larger ones frame the building, and appear to support an overhanging cornice with <b>a</b> <b>decorative</b> dentil finish. The smaller pilasters are either side of a large doorway, and are topped by a pediment. The double wooden doors have six panels, and are fronted by six steps which are almost the same width as the building. On {{the southern}} side of the building, more Ionic pilasters rise the height of the building, spread between four large windows.|$|E

It {{was cast in}} 1603 and is the largest bronze gun in Malaysia. In front of the dolphin handles is <b>a</b> <b>decorative</b> band featuring three pairs of heraldic lions with long, spiralling tails. Each pair faces a vase containing flowers. Between the handles and the Dutch East India Company's seal is a Javi inscription, inlaid with silver, celebrating the gun's capture in 1613.

5|$|The facades of English cathedrals show a {{considerable}} diversity, {{rather than a}} consistent progression, {{as is the case}} in Northern France and other cathedrals influenced by the French Gothic style.

A great number of these were toppled or defaced during the 17th century, however a “Gallery of Kings” remains high on the façade of Lincoln, and many of the original weather-worn figures remain at Exeter.|$|E

Its parasites include coccidians. The queen conch is hunted and eaten by several species of large predatory sea snails, and also by starfish, crustaceans and vertebrates (fish, sea turtles and humans). Its shell is sold as a souvenir and used as <b>a</b> <b>decorative</b> object. Historically, Native Americans and indigenous Caribbean peoples used parts of the shell to create various tools.|$|E
5|$|At {{the front}} of the house, on the ground floor, is a reconstructed medieval shop front, from where the owner would have {{conducted}} his mercantile business. Behind this is the central hall, originally designed with an open hearth in the middle, but now fitted with a 14th-century Flemish chimney, plastered so as to resemble brickwork. A hallway runs along one side of the hall; hallways were a traditional feature of the period, although the fashion was eventually abandoned because of the difficulty of lighting them effectively. At the rear of the property is an inner private room, with <b>a</b> <b>decorative</b> ceiling. Beneath the house is an undercroft, or cellar, designed to store barrels of wine at a constant temperature; the brick floor is 18th-century in origin, however. This is an architectural feature found in several other English coastal and river medieval towns, including Winchester and London.|$|E
5|$|Before modern times, {{buildings}} were usually constructed of local materials, including wood, thatch etc. The Nook in Oulton (dated 1611) {{is a rare}} example of an original half-timbered house. Of the more durable materials, there are three rocks which have been substantially used. These are gritstone (a sort of sandstone) found {{to the north and}} west (e.g. Kirstall Abbey, Leeds Town Hall or Harewood House), different sandstones in the Yorkshire Coal Measures, and limestone to the north and east, as is shown in older villages (now suburbs) in these directions. To the south of the city are substantial clay deposits, so that red brick has been the predominant building material for the extensive nineteenth century housing. The particularly fine clay found in Burmantofts led to <b>a</b> <b>decorative</b> covering of terracotta or glazed Architectural Faience being used on both interior and exterior walls of important buildings.|$|E

5|$|Beginning in 1932, Mary J. L. McDonald {{made the}} then-largest {{donation}} of books {{to the library}} when she donated volumes worth just over $10,000. She donated a total of over 1,000 items that included a complete works of Abraham Lincoln valued at $4,800. In 1936, the Works Progress Administration gave <b>a</b> <b>decorative</b> archway to the library to be installed over the south entrance to the building. The library was among several buildings vandalized by University of Oregon students in October 1945 during {{the run-up to the}} Civil War football game between the two schools. The library received a bequest of about 5,500 volumes valued at about $15,000 in December 1947 from William H. Galvani's estate. This donation overtook that of McDonald to become the largest received by the library up to that time.|$|E
5|$|Born in Walthamstow, Essex, to {{a wealthy}} middle-class family, Morris {{came under the}} strong {{influence}} of medievalism while studying Classics at Oxford University, there joining the Birmingham Set. After university, he trained as an architect, married Jane Burden, and developed close friendships with the Pre-Raphaelite artists Edward Burne-Jones and Dante Gabriel Rossetti and with the Neo-Gothic architect Philip Webb. Webb and Morris designed a family home, Red House, then in Kent, where the latter lived from 1859 to 1865, before moving to Bloomsbury, central London. In 1861, Morris founded <b>a</b> <b>decorative</b> arts firm with Burne-Jones, Rossetti, Webb, and others: the Morris, Marshall, Faulkner & Co. Becoming highly fashionable and much in demand, the firm profoundly influenced interior decoration throughout the Victorian period, with Morris designing tapestries, wallpaper, fabrics, furniture, and stained glass windows. In 1875, Morris assumed total control of the company, which was renamed Morris & Co.|$|E
5|$|Brought by explorers, {{queen conch}} shells {{quickly became a}} popular asset in early modern Europe. In the late 17th century they were widely used as {{decoration}} over fireplace mantels and English gardens, among other places. In contemporary times, queen conch shells are mainly utilized in handicraft. Shells are made into cameos, bracelets and lamps, and traditionally as doorstops or decorations by families of seafaring men. The shell continues to be popular as <b>a</b> <b>decorative</b> object, though its export is now regulated and restricted by the CITES agreement. In modern culture, queen conch shells are often represented in everyday objects such as coins and stamps.|$|E
