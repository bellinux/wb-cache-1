5|$|Ford reluctantly {{agreed to}} run for office in 1976, but first he had to counter a {{challenge}} for the Republican party nomination. Former Governor of California Ronald Reagan and the party's conservative wing faulted Ford for failing to do more in South Vietnam, for signing the Helsinki Accords, and for negotiating to cede the Panama Canal. (Negotiations for the canal continued under President Carter, who eventually signed the Torrijos–Carter Treaties.) Reagan launched his campaign in autumn of 1975 and won numerous primaries, including North Carolina, Texas, Indiana, and California, but failed to get a majority of delegates; Reagan withdrew from the race <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>Republican</b> <b>Convention</b> in Kansas City, Missouri. The conservative insurgency did lead to Ford dropping the more liberal Vice President Nelson Rockefeller in favor of U.S. Senator Bob Dole of Kansas.|$|E
25|$|In {{the weeks}} after her victory <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>Republican</b> <b>Convention,</b> McMahon fared poorly in {{political}} polls and suffered from high unfavorability ratings among both Democrats and Republicans.

On June 8, McMahon released her own internal polling to assure Republicans she was competitive with Blumenthal.|$|E

After Granholm was elected Governor in 2002, arguments broke about between Smietanka and then-Republican Governor John Engler about who was most responsible for Granholm's meteoric rise in Michigan politics. Smietanka blamed Engler for trying to force {{him out of the}} 1998 race in favour of G. Scott Romney, for dredging up the issue of his missed child support payments and for not supporting him more fully after he defeated Romney <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>Republican</b> <b>convention.</b> Engler contested that Smietanka was a weak candidate who should have stepped aside for Romney, who would have beaten the inexperienced Granholm; she would then not have had a launch pad for her gubernatorial campaign in 2002.|$|E

500|$|Shortly {{after the}} {{beginning}} of his term as California governor, Reagan tested the presidential waters in 1968 as part of a [...] "Stop Nixon" [...] movement, hoping to cut into Nixon's Southern support and be a compromise candidate if neither Nixon nor second-place Nelson Rockefeller received enough delegates to win on the first ballot <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>Republican</b> <b>convention.</b> However, {{by the time of the}} convention Nixon had 692 delegate votes, 25 more than he needed to secure the nomination, followed by Rockefeller with Reagan in third place.|$|E

500|$|According to Hanna biographer Herbert Croly, Hobart, {{an early}} {{supporter}} of McKinley, helped ensure New Jersey's support for him <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>Republican</b> <b>convention.</b> [...] Historian Stanley Jones, {{in his study}} of the 1896 election, stated that Hobart stopped off in Canton, Ohio, McKinley's hometown, en route to the convention in St. Louis. [...] Jones wrote that the future vice president was selected several days in advance, after Speaker of the House Thomas Reed of Maine turned down the nomination. [...] Croly asserted that McKinley and Hanna desired an easterner on the ticket to balance it and boost support in the Mid-Atlantic region. [...] The conventional means of assuring this was to nominate a politician from New York, then the largest state in population. [...] As many New York delegates supported their favorite son candidate, Governor (and former vice president) Levi P. Morton, instead of McKinley, giving the state the vice-presidential nomination would be an unmerited reward. [...] According to Croly, ...|$|E

500|$|In {{the wake}} of John F. Kennedy's death and {{favorable}} economic circumstances, Lyndon Johnson was the favorite candidate {{early on in the}} general election campaign. In light of Nelson Rockefeller's rebuke of Goldwater's political ideology <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>Republican</b> <b>Convention,</b> which was televised nationally, the media speculated {{as to whether or not}} Rockefeller would endorse Goldwater in the general election, barring the Goldwater campaign with more negative publicity. In addition to this, Johnson was known for his ability to manipulate the press in order to provide favorable coverage of his own campaign. [...] Johnson, along with the media, who also had a generally unfavorable opinion of Goldwater, portrayed his opponent as a political extremist. Johnson also used Goldwater's speeches to imply that he would willingly wage a nuclear war, quoting Goldwater: [...] "by one impulse act you could press a button and wipe out 300 million people before sun down." [...] In turn, Goldwater defended himself by accusing Johnson of making the accusation indirectly, and contending that the media blew the issue out of proportion.|$|E
500|$|Wilson {{actually}} {{desired to}} be Vice President. During his speech making {{tour of the}} South, Wilson moderated his tougher Reconstruction ideology, [...] advocating a biracial society, while urging African Americans and their white supporters to take a conciliatory and peaceful approach with Southern whites who had favored the Confederacy. Radicals, including Benjamin Wade, were stunned by Wilson's remarks, believing blacks should {{not be subject to}} their former white owners. <b>At</b> <b>the</b> <b>Republican</b> <b>Convention,</b> Wilson, Wade and others competed for the Vice Presidential nomination, and Wilson had support among Southern delegates, but he failed to win after five ballots. [...] Wade was also unable to win the convention vote, and Wilson's delegates eventually switched their votes to Speaker of the House Schuyler Colfax, who won the nomination and {{went on to win the}} general election with Grant at the head of the ticket. After Grant and Colfax won the 1868 election Wilson declined to serve as Secretary of War in Grant's cabinet due to his desire to spend more time with Mrs. Wilson during her lengthy final illness.|$|E
500|$|Hay {{continued}} to devote {{much of his}} energy to Republican politics. [...] In 1884, he supported Blaine for president, donating considerable sums to the senator's unsuccessful campaign against New York Governor Grover Cleveland. [...] Many of Hay's friends were unenthusiastic about Blaine's candidacy, to Hay's anger, and he wrote to editor Richard Watson Gilder, [...] "I {{have never been able}} to appreciate the logic that induces some excellent people every four years because they cannot nominate the candidate they prefer to vote for the party they don't prefer." [...] In 1888, Hay had to follow his own advice as his favored candidate, Ohio Senator John Sherman, was unsuccessful <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>Republican</b> <b>convention.</b> [...] After some reluctance, Hay supported the nominee, former Indiana senator Benjamin Harrison, who was elected. [...] Though Harrison appointed men whom Hay supported, including Blaine, Reid, and Robert Lincoln, Hay was not asked to serve in the Harrison administration. In 1890, Hay spoke for Republican congressional candidates, addressing a rally of 10,000 people in New York City, but the party was defeated, losing control of Congress. Hay contributed funds to Harrison's unsuccessful re-election effort, in part because Reid had been made Harrison's 1892 running mate.|$|E

500|$|MacArthur {{received}} public adulation, which aroused {{expectations that}} he would run for president, {{but he was not}} a candidate. MacArthur carried out a speaking tour in 1951–52 attacking the Truman administration for [...] "appeasement in Asia" [...] and for mismanaging the economy. Initially attracting large crowds, by early 1952 MacArthur's speeches were attracting smaller and smaller numbers of people as many complained that MacArthur seemed more interested in settling scores with Truman and praising himself than in offering up a constructive vision for the nation. MacArthur felt uncomfortable campaigning for the Republican nomination, and hoped that <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>Republican</b> <b>convention,</b> a deadlock would ensue between Senator Robert Taft and General Eisenhower, which would end with the GOP nominating him as the best compromise. MacArthur's unwillingness to campaign for the presidency seriously hurt his ability to win the nomination. In the end, MacArthur endorsed Senator Robert A. Taft, and was keynote speaker at the 1952 Republican National Convention. Taft lost the nomination to Eisenhower, who {{went on to win the}} 1952 election by a landslide. Once elected, Eisenhower consulted with MacArthur about ending the war in Korea.|$|E
2500|$|Taft was an {{announced}} candidate and, {{given his}} age, he freely admitted 1952 {{would be his}} last chance to win the presidency. <b>At</b> <b>the</b> <b>Republican</b> <b>Convention,</b> pro-Taft delegates and speakers [...] verbally attacked Dewey as the real power behind Eisenhower, but Dewey had the satisfaction of seeing Eisenhower win the nomination and end Taft's presidential hopes for the last time.|$|E
2500|$|Dewey {{was not as}} {{conservative}} as the Republican-controlled 80th Congress, which also proved problematic for him. Truman tied Dewey to the [...] "do-nothing" [...] Congress. Indeed, Dewey had successfully battled Taft and his conservatives for the nomination <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>Republican</b> <b>Convention.</b> Taft had remained a non-interventionist even through the Second World War. Dewey, however, supported the Marshall Plan, the Truman Doctrine, recognition of Israel, and the Berlin airlift.|$|E

The questions involved his military service, a golf trip to Florida with Paula Parkinson, and whether he had enough experience to be vice president. Quayle seemed at times rattled and at other times uncertain or evasive as he tried to handle the questions. Delegates to the convention generally blamed television and newspapers for the focus on Quayle's problems, but Bush's staff said they thought Quayle had mishandled the questions about his military record, leaving questions dangling. Although Bush was trailing by up to 15 points in public opinion polls taken before the convention, in August, the Bush/Quayle ticket took the lead, which they did not relinquish {{for the rest of the}} campaign.|$|E
