An examination {{of the differences between the}} apartment legislations of the State of Maharashtra and the Union Territory of Delhi and several other systems has been made to find out why one system works better than the other.   Does the problem lie in the nature of the legislation, the procedures of the Competent Authority and Registry for applying and obtaining registration of an <b>apartment</b> <b>ownership</b> plan, the laws and practices relating to development, construction, financing and conveyancing of <b>apartment</b> <b>ownership</b> property or a combination of all these factors?  From my evaluation of the various aspects of the Acts and the proposed Bill, it appears there is room for improvement in virtually every aspect to keep up with the rapid growth of <b>apartment</b> <b>ownership</b> schemes in Maharashtra and Delhi and gradually all over India.   But it is not only the Act and the Bill that need modernisation.   The housing delivery system in India has got to change.   Officials involved in the approval and registration of <b>apartment</b> <b>ownership</b> schemes have to be properly trained, and care should be taken to recruit more qualified personnel in the related Offices.

40|$|Thesis (LLD (Private Law)) [...] Stellenbosch University, 2008. The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to examine the significance of introducing and strengthening <b>apartment</b> <b>ownership</b> in China. The research aims to explore and scrutinize various <b>apartment</b> <b>ownership</b> options from selected jurisdictions in order to provide a framework for similar legislation in China. Hence, the research seeks to provide a legislative framework for a uniform condominium statute by closely examining the South African Sectional Titles Act and the American Uniform Common Interest Ownership Act. This comparative study will help to establish a uniform condominium statute suitable to the Chinese national character and compatible with the pace of the country’s economic development. The thesis is organized into seven chapters. The first chapter explains the research topic, theoretical basis of the thesis, and research methodology. Moreover, in this chapter the historical background and status quo of Chinese condominium institution are also illustrated. Following this introduction, Chapter Two explores the theoretical structure of condominium ownership. It depicts the legislative innovation arising from its sui generis features and explains the objects of condominium ownership on the basis of its unique definition. In Chapter Three, a wide spectrum of provisions is identified pertaining to the creation of condominium in China with reference to South African and American acts. Specifically, it observes the requirements for land intended for subdivision and the buildings that comprise a condominium project. It is highlighted that a condominium’s constitutive document is unregulated in China. Moreover, the characteristic Chinese land registration procedure is also presented. Chapter Four demonstrates the significance of the participation quota and analyzes the advantages and disadvantages of different participation quota calculating methods. Chapter Five emphasizes that inherent in the condominium living is the interdependence of interests among unit owners. Consequently, this chapter focuses on condominium owners’ use and enjoyment of their apartments and the common property. Chapter Six elaborates on condominium management. This chapter examines the management body, the general meeting, the executive council and the managing agent. It concludes that having a well-structured management body is essential since a condominium community cannot function efficiently without a management association to represent all of the owners and to handle day-to-day operations. The last chapter concludes that China needs to enact a uniform condominium to protect private interests within the condominium context...|$|E

The recent law regarding condominium contained in Act No 39 of 2003 has given greater powers to the management corporation and its authorities as a legal body. Through this study, it was aimed to identify the nature of the current management process of management corporations and the process established by the condominium management authority (CMA). A questionnaire survey was used with Stake holders, community members and MC’s officials to assess the implementation of current condominium management process and CAB role of condominium management process and find out the most significant factors for non implementation of the current management system of utility condominiums and develop guideline to address them. However it was identified that there are many deficiencies in management process of utility condominiums of low income group families. This was due to several reasons related to their level of education, financial capabilities, capacity, priorities of the people, and interaction between CMA and Local Authorities.

Strata cannot be avoided, especially in major cities due to lack of land and the cost to own land are become more expensive. However, with this types of approach by building a higher building, indirect costs of a piece of land shared by all owners and to reduce the overall cost of construction. However, the cost of sharing create a new problem to all parcel owners. The issue that often arises is connection with the payment of quit rent to be paid by the owner of the parcel {{based on the number of}} shares in the scheme of the strata development. Failure of payment of land quit rent by the parcel owner cause to the confiscation of the whole land by the authority although part of parcel owner make a payment based on their shares. It created injustice to the parcel owner. Basically in strata scheme there is a clear boundary between the parcel owner. Due to the problems of quit rent payment, new proposal been made. Parcel owner have to pay the quit rent individually directly to the State. This new proposal create a new concept in the ownership of strata.

40|$|A large {{majority}} of apartment tenures for apartments acquired {{at the beginning of}} the 1990 s in Croatia have not yet been entered in the Land Registry. The reason for not entering ownership in the books is the same or almost the same as during purchase: the inconsistency of official data on lots on which buildings have been built, i. e. data from the Cadastre and the Land Registry, incomplete building documentation for completed structures and unresolved ownership issues regarding cadastre lots (e. g. those still owned by a local authority, companies which no longer exist, unknown proprietors, etc.). The Act on Ownership and the Regulations on Linking the Book of Deposited Contracts and the Land Registry prescribe the entry of <b>apartment</b> <b>ownership,</b> as recorded in the Book of Deposited Contracts, in the Land Registry.

Surveying is the profession competent to link and coordinate the state of data on cadastre lots on which buildings containing apartments with tenancy rights have been built. Using specific information provided by three building managers, the facts on ownership entry in the Land Registry and the Book of Deposited Contracts of actual buildings are presented in this paper. Furthermore, an overview is provided of the preliminary actions required, in the form of producing suitable surveying plans to give building managers direction and some guidance as to which steps to take in successfully tackling the issue of linking the Land Registry with the Book of Deposited Contracts...|$|E

40|$|Deed of High-Rise Separation is an {{important}} stage {{in the development and}} ownership of high-rise because deed of separation is proof of high-rise separation upon high-rise units, mutual parts, mutual objects and mutual land with clear report in the form of drawings, descriptions and boundaries in vertical and horizontal directions which containing proportional comparison value. Proportional comparison value is very important for the owner of high-rise unit because it represents the owner’s rights and obligations on ownership, maintenance and management of such high-rise. Proportional comparison value is a number that indicates the ratio high-rise unit towards the rights over mutual parts, mutual objects and mutual land, calculated based on total area and value of the concerned high-rise unit towards the building total area or the high-rise overall value at the first time the developer calculates its overall development cost to determine its selling price. In relation to the issue of deed of separation, some problems raised as follow; firstly, its legal consequences if there is changes on building plan in further stage during the high-rise development which results in changes on proportional comparison value of the Deed of High-Rise Separation, and secondly, whether strata unit and Strata title / Building title can be used as credit security and how is the implementation of partial revocation mortgage in high-rise construction credit. A research is designed as normative legal research in order to respond those problems by using 2 types of approaches that consists of: The Statue Approach and The Legal Content Analitical Approach. The legal materials analyzed herein are primary legal material and secondary legal material, arranged descriptively and systematically. Research shows that it is possible for the high-rise developer to change the building plan provided that before making any changes on the building plan, it must inform such changes to the Association of High-Rise Residents and also has received approval from the Association of High-Rise Residents, especially if such changes result in changes of the high-rise comparison value. High-rise and high-rise unit can also be used as debt security through Mortgage/Fiduciary Institution, which allows the developer to pledge the high-rise for construction credit, in which the high-rise unit that has been fully paid by its owner can be released from the credit security of high-rise construction, thus the high-rise owner may then transfer their high-rise unit for credit security of <b>apartment</b> <b>ownership</b> (KPA) as well as other financing credit security. </span...|$|E
