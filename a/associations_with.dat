5|$|Amanita ravenelii is a {{mycorrhizal}} fungus, {{meaning it}} forms mutualistic <b>associations</b> <b>with</b> shrubs and trees. Mushrooms grow {{on the ground}} solitarily, scattered, or in groups in mixed coniferous and deciduous forests. Although the specific tree associations preferred by A.ravenelii are unknown, in general, Amanita from section Lepidella tend to associate with diploxylon pine (that is, pines in subgenus Pinus), oak, and hickory.|$|E
5|$|<b>Associations</b> <b>with</b> various {{climate and}} {{environmental}} trends exist. For example, {{an increase in}} the sea surface temperature of a source region (e.g. Gulf of Mexico and Mediterranean Sea) increases atmospheric moisture content. Increased moisture can fuel an increase in severe weather and tornado activity, particularly in the cool season.|$|E
5|$|Birds {{sometimes}} also form <b>associations</b> <b>with</b> non-avian species. Plunge-diving seabirds {{associate with}} dolphins and tuna, which push shoaling fish towards the surface. Hornbills have a mutualistic relationship with dwarf mongooses, {{in which they}} forage together and warn each other of nearby birds of prey and other predators.|$|E

40|$|I examine {{associations}} {{of mass media}} and information and communications technologies (ICTs) with inequality and poverty. I find that newspaper circulation has a robust negative <b>association</b> <b>with</b> inequality. Radios and TVs also have a negative <b>association</b> <b>with</b> poverty.

An instrumental variable analysis confirms the robust negative association between newspaper circulation and inequality...|$|R

5|$|Thelephora palmata is an ectomycorrhizal species, forming mutualistic <b>associations</b> <b>with</b> conifers. Fruit bodies grow singly, scattered, or {{in groups}} {{on the ground in}} both {{coniferous}} and mixed forest and grassy fields. A preference has been noted for moist ground, and locations along woodland paths. An uncommon species, fruit bodies can be difficult to see because they blend well into their surroundings.|$|E
5|$|A multi-star system {{consists}} {{of two or more}} gravitationally bound stars that orbit each other. The simplest and most common multi-star system is a binary star, but systems of three or more stars are also found. For reasons of orbital stability, such multi-star systems are often organized into hierarchical sets of binary stars. Larger groups called star clusters also exist. These range from loose stellar <b>associations</b> <b>with</b> only a few stars, up to enormous globular clusters with hundreds of thousands of stars. Such systems orbit their host galaxy.|$|E

5|$|Ants (family Formicidae in {{the order}} Hymenoptera) are the most species-rich of all social insects, with more than 12,000 {{described}} species and many others awaiting description. Formicidae is divided into 21 subfamilies, of which 17 contain extant taxa, while four are exclusively fossil. Ants have come to occupy virtually all major terrestrial habitats, {{with the exception of}} tundra and cold ever-wet forests. They display a wide range of social behaviors, foraging habits and <b>associations</b> <b>with</b> other organisms, which has generated scientific and public interest.|$|E
5|$|Ants form {{symbiotic}} <b>associations</b> <b>with</b> a {{range of}} species, including other ant species, other insects, plants, and fungi. They also are preyed on by many animals and even certain fungi. Some arthropod species spend {{part of their lives}} within ant nests, either preying on ants, their larvae, and eggs, consuming the food stores of the ants, or avoiding predators. These inquilines may bear a close resemblance to ants. The nature of this ant mimicry (myrmecomorphy) varies, with some cases involving Batesian mimicry, where the mimic reduces the risk of predation. Others show Wasmannian mimicry, a form of mimicry seen only in inquilines.|$|E

5|$|Cortinarius iodes forms {{mycorrhizal}} <b>associations</b> <b>with</b> deciduous trees, particularly oaks. The fruit {{bodies of}} Cortinarius iodes sometimes grow singly, {{but more often}} scattered or in groups under hardwood trees, in humus and litterfall. Typical habitats include bog edges, swampy areas, and hummocks. Fruiting usually occurs from July to November. In North America, it is common in eastern regions, and rare in the Pacific Northwest. Its distribution extends from eastern Canada south into Central America and northern regions of South America. It also occurs in northern Asia.|$|E
