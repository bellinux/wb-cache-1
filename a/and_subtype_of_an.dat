40|$|Abstract Background High {{resolution}} {{mass spectrometry}} has been employed to rapidly and accurately type <b>and</b> <b>subtype</b> influenza viruses. The detection of signature peptides with unique theoretical masses enables the unequivocal assignment <b>of</b> the type <b>and</b> <b>subtype</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> given strain. This analysis has, to date, required the manual inspection of mass spectra of whole virus and antigen digests. Results A computer algorithm, FluTyper, {{has been designed}} and implemented to achieve the automated analysis of MALDI mass spectra recorded for proteolytic digests of the whole influenza virus and antigens. FluTyper incorporates the use of established signature peptides and newly developed naïve Bayes classifiers for four common influenza antigens, hemagglutinin, neuraminidase, nucleoprotein, and matrix protein 1, to type <b>and</b> <b>subtype</b> the influenza virus based on their detection within proteolytic peptide mass maps. Theoretical and experimental testing of the classifiers demonstrates their applicability at protein coverage rates normally achievable in mass mapping experiments. The application of FluTyper to whole virus and antigen digests <b>of</b> <b>a</b> range <b>of</b> different strains of the influenza virus is demonstrated. Conclusions FluTyper algorithm facilitates the rapid and automated typing <b>and</b> <b>subtyping</b> <b>of</b> the influenza virus from mass spectral data. The newly developed naïve Bayes classifiers increase the confidence <b>of</b> influenza virus <b>subtyping,</b> especially where signature peptides are not detected.

Objectives We assessed the efficacy <b>of</b> <b>a</b> one-stop-shop concept using invivo reflectance confocal microscopy (RCM) imaging as a diagnostic tool vs. standard care for surgical treatment in patients with clinically suspected BCC. Methods In this open-label, parallel-group, noninferiority, randomized controlled multicentre trial we enrolled patients with clinically suspected BCC at two tertiary referral centres in Amsterdam, the Netherlands. Patients were randomly assigned to the RCM one-stop-shop (diagnosing <b>and</b> <b>subtyping</b> using RCM followed by direct surgical excision) or standard care (planned excision based on the histological diagnosis <b>and</b> <b>subtype</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> punch biopsy). The primary outcome was the proportion of patients with tumour-free margins after surgical excision of BCC. Results Of the 95 patients included, 73 (77 %) had a BCC histologically confirmed using a surgical excision specimen. All patients (40 of 40, 100 %) in the one-stop-shop group had tumour-free margins. In the standard-care group tumour-free margins were found in all but two patients (31 of 33, 94 %). The difference in the proportion of patients with tumour-free margins after BCC excision between the one-stop-shop group and the standard-care group was - 0. 06 (90 % confidence interval- 0. 17 - 0. 01), establishing noninferiority. Conclusions The proposed new treatment strategy seems suitable in facilitating early diagnosis and direct treatment for patients with BCC, depending on factors such as availability of RCM, size and site of the lesion, patient preference and whether direct surgical excision is feasibl...|$|R

In this way two MAbs, MAb 40 - 1 (anti-Ad 40) and MAb 41 - 1 (anti-Ad 41) were selected. These two MAbs showed strict type specificity in both assays. A third MAb reacted in an ELISA with all 47 human adenovirus types. With two other MAbs, three antigenic <b>subtypes</b> <b>of</b> <b>Ad</b> 41 could be distinguished by their reactivities in virus neutralization tests and ELISAs. On the basis of the five selected MAbs, a sensitive ELISA system was developed for the direct detection and simultaneous typing <b>and</b> <b>subtyping</b> <b>of</b> <b>Ad</b> 40 <b>and</b> Ad 41 present in stool specimens. The five MAbs were also used to study the epidemiology <b>of</b> infections with <b>Ad</b> 40 and Ad 41 in The Netherlands in the period 1981 through 1989.

40|$|AbstractA new {{quadrivalent}} {{influenza vaccine}} {{has been available}} for influenza B, which can pose a significant global health burden. Shanghai has the highest GDP and largest metropolitan population in China. To understand the impact of influenza B in Shanghai in terms of age-related incidence and relative prevalence compared with other subtypes, we conducted this retrospective epidemiological study of influenza B in the 2009 – 2014 seasons. <b>A</b> total <b>of</b> 71 354 outpatients with influenza-like illness were included, and both lineages <b>of</b> influenza B <b>and</b> <b>subtypes</b> <b>of</b> influenza <b>A</b> were identified using real-time RT-PCR. The antigenic characteristics of influenza B isolates were analysed by sequencing and reciprocal haemagglutinin inhibition assay. On average, 33. 45 % of influenza strains were influenza B, and 40. 20 % of strains isolated from children were influenza B. The incidence of influenza B was highest (12. 52 per 100 people with influenza-like illness) in children ages 6 – 17 years and usually peaked {{in this age group}} at the early stage <b>of</b> <b>an</b> influenza B epidemic. Overall, both matched and mismatched influenza B strains co-circulated in Shanghai annually, and 44. 57 % of the circulating influenza B belonged to the opposite lineage of the vaccine strains. We concluded that influenza B has caused a substantial impact in Shanghai and that school-aged children {{play a key role in}} the transmission of influenza B. Hence, it may be beneficial to prioritize influenza vaccination for school-aged children to mitigate the outbreaks of influenza B...|$|R
40|$|Background: The {{effectiveness}} of trivalent influenza vaccination {{has been confirmed}} in several studies. To date, {{it is not known}} whether repeated exposure and vaccination to influenza promote production of cross-reactive anti-bodies. Furthermore, how strains encountered earlier in life imprint the immune response is currently poorly understood. Methods: To determine the prevalence for human homo- and heterosubtypic antibody responses, we scruti-nized serum samples from 305 healthy volunteers for hemagglutinin-binding and -neutralizing antibodies against several strains <b>and</b> <b>subtypes</b> <b>of</b> influenza <b>A.</b> Statistical analyses were then performed to establish the association of measured values with potential predictors. Results: It was found that vaccination not only promoted higher binding and neutralizing antibody titers to homosubtypic in fluenza isolates but also increased heterosubtypic human immune responses. Both binding and neutralizing antibody titers in relation with age of the donors mirrored the course of the different influenza strain circulation during the last century. Advanced age appeared to be of advantage for both binding and neutralizing titers to most subtypes. In contrast, the first virus subtype encountered was found to imprint to some degree subsequent antibody responses. Antibodies to recent strains, however, primarily seemed to be promoted by vaccination. Conclusions: We provide evidence that vaccinations stimulate both homo- and heterosubtypic immune responses in young and middle-aged as well as more senior individuals. Our analyses suggest that influenza vaccinations not only prevent infection against currently circulating strains but can also stimulate broader humoral immune responses that potentially attenuate infections with zoonotic or antigenically shifted strains...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Despite their wide occurrence, {{cryptosporidiosis}} and giardiasis {{are considered}} neglected diseases by the World Health Organization. The epidemiology of these diseases and microsporidiosis in humans {{in developing countries}} is poorly understood. The high concentration of pathogens in raw sewage makes the characterization of the transmission of these pathogens simple through the genotype <b>and</b> <b>subtype</b> analysis <b>of</b> <b>a</b> small number <b>of</b> samples. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: The distribution <b>of</b> genotypes <b>and</b> <b>subtypes</b> <b>of</b> Cryptosporidium spp., Giardia duodenalis, and Enterocytozoon bieneusi in 386 samples of combined sewer systems from Shanghai, Nanjing and Wuhan and the sewer system in Qingdao in China was determined using PCR-sequencing tools. Eimeria spp. were also genotyped to assess the contribution of domestic animals to Cryptosporidium spp., G. duodenalis, and E. bieneusi in wastewater. The high occurrence of Cryptosporidium spp. (56. 2 %), G. duodenalis (82. 6 %), E. bieneusi (87. 6 %), and Eimeria/Cyclospora (80. 3 %) made the source attribution possible. As expected, several human-pathogenic species/genotypes, including Cryptosporidium hominis, Cryptosporidium meleagridis, G. duodenalis sub-assemblage A-II, and E. bieneusi genotype D, were the dominant parasites in wastewater. In addition to humans, the common presence of Cryptosporidium spp. and Eimeria spp. from rodents indicated that rodents might {{have contributed to the}} occurrence of E. bieneusi genotype D in samples. Likewise, the finding of Eimeria spp. and Cryptosporidium baileyi from birds indicated that C. meleagridis might be of both human and bird origins. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: The distribution of Cryptosporidium species, G. duodenalis genotypes <b>and</b> <b>subtypes,</b> <b>and</b> E. bieneusi genotypes in urban wastewater indicates that anthroponotic transmission appeared to be important in epidemiology of cryptosporidiosis, giardiasis, and microsporidiosis in the study areas. The finding of different distributions <b>of</b> <b>subtypes</b> between Shanghai <b>and</b> Wuhan was indicative of possible differences in the source of C. hominis among different areas in China...|$|R
40|$|Fluorescent amplified-fragment length {{polymorphism}} (FAFLP) {{analysis was}} investigated {{for its ability}} to identify <b>and</b> <b>subtype</b> isolates <b>of</b> <b>an</b> epidemic methicillin-resistant phage type of Staphylococcus aureus, EMRSA- 15. These isolates were also characterized by PCR-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) of the coagulase gene and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE). For FAFLP, DNA was double digested with restriction enzymes ApaI plus TaqI or EcoRI plus MseI. Site-specific adaptors were ligated to one or the other set of restriction fragments, and PCR amplification was carried out with adaptor-specific primers. Amplified fragments separated on an ABI 377 automated sequencer and analyzed with Genescan version 2. 1 software generated FAFLP profiles for all the isolates. The presence or absence of fragments was scored, similarity coefficients were calculated, and UPGMA (unweighted pair group method using arithmatic averages) cluster analysis was performed. Either enzyme-primer combination readily differentiated EMRSA- 15 from other methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) isolates and also revealed heterogeneity within the phage type. The discriminatory power of FAFLP was high. By combining both enzyme-primer data sets, 24 isolates were divided into 11 profiles. PCR-RFLP did not discriminate among these EMRSA- 15 isolates. PFGE could discriminate well between isolates but was not as reproducible as FAFLP. All S. aureus and MRSA isolates in this study were typeable by FAFLP, which was easy to perform, robust, and reproducible, with evident potential to subtyp...|$|R
40|$|Objective: To {{examine the}} {{validity}} <b>of</b> the three <b>subtypes</b> <b>of</b> ADHD defined by DSM-IV. Method: Studies published in English were identified through searches of literature databases. Results: Estimates of {{the prevalence of}} ADHD have increased as <b>a</b> result <b>of</b> the introduction of DSM-IV criteria. Factor analytical and genetic studies provide some support for {{the validity of the}} distinction between the three <b>subtypes.</b> However, diagnosis <b>of</b> the combined <b>subtype</b> seems more reliable than the other two subtypes, although reliability is largely unknown for the latter. The hyperactive-impulsive subtype, the least common, differs from the other two subtypes in age distribution, association with other factors and neuropsychological parameters. Almost all treatment trials are based on participants with the combined type. Conclusion: Data supporting the validity of the inattentive <b>and</b> hyperactive-impulsive <b>subtypes</b> <b>of</b> ADHD <b>a</b> decade after the publication of DSM-IV are still scarce. Given that inattention is the hypothesized core ADHD symptom, it remains to be demonstrated that hyperactive-impulsive children who are not inattentive have the same condition. One of the main research deficits refers to data on treatment of the inattentive <b>and</b> hyperactive-impulsive <b>subtypes...</b>|$|R
