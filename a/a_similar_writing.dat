60|$|The {{ordinary}} {{existence of}} the common people in these communities was very like the ordinary existence of any other barbaric peasantry. Their pottery, weaving and dyeing was very good. The Maya writing was not only carven on stone but written and painted upon skins and the like. The European and American museums contain many enigmatical Maya manuscripts of which at present little has been deciphered except the dates. In Peru there were beginnings of <b>a</b> <b>similar</b> <b>writing</b> but they were superseded by a method of keeping records by knotting {76} cords. A similar method of mnemonics was in use in China thousands of years ago.|$|E

50|$|The {{sometimes}} rather striking graphic similarity {{they have}} with the hieratic and demotic Egyptian numerals, while suggestive, is not prima facie evidence of an historical connection, as many cultures have independently recorded numbers as collections of strokes.

50|$|Mardi is Melville's first pure fiction work (while {{featuring}} fictional narrators; {{his previous}} novels were heavily autobiographical). It details (much like Typee and Omoo) the travelings of an American sailor who abandons his whaling vessel {{to explore the}} South Pacific. Unlike the first two, however, Mardi is highly philosophical and {{said to be the}} first work to show Melville's true potential. The tale begins as a simple narrative, but quickly focuses upon discourse between the main characters and their interactions with the different symbolic countries they encounter. While not as cohesive or lengthy as Moby-Dick, it shares <b>a</b> <b>similar</b> <b>writing</b> style as well as many of the same themes.|$|E

5000|$|This statue was the {{original}} model for the various representations of Kairos made in ancient times and Middle Ages as well. John Tzetzes wrote about it, as well as Himerius. The image of hair hanging on the forehead and a bald back of the head. For instance Disticha Catonis II, 26 refer to the Latin concept of Occasio (a female word which {{can be considered as}} a literal translation of the Greek Kairos) in these terms: [...] "Rem tibi quam scieris aptam dimittere noli: fronte capillata, post haec occasio calva", which means [...] "Don't let that what you consider good for you escape by; chance has hair over her forehead, but behind she's bald". Phaedrus (V,8) has <b>a</b> <b>similar</b> <b>writing</b> and he himself admits that the theme was not his own but more ancient. Callistratus (Descriptions, 6) has a long text describing the statue by Lysippos.|$|E
50|$|The {{two types}} of exemplars are {{complementary}} to one another. Request writings can be controlled to some degree by whoever obtains them. That is, {{it is possible to}} exercise some control over the writing to ensure that it is written in a comparable manner using <b>a</b> <b>similar</b> <b>writing</b> instrument, similar paper, etc. Most important, the text to be written is dictated to the writer so that it can either match the questioned text exactly or be modified to ensure comparability without exactly matching the text if, for example, the text itself should remain unknown. The primary concerns with request writing is that the writer might attempt to intentionally alter (disguise) their writing habits or the sample might not display the full range of the writer's natural variation. Collected writings {{are less likely to be}} affected by intentional alteration (disguise) and, if sufficient quantities can be obtained, should cover the writer's range of natural variation. As a result, the limitations of either type can be overcome by the other.|$|E

40|$|A study {{determined}} the impact encouragement of invented spelling has on a child's writing through {{a comparison of}} writing samples produced by children encouraged to use invented spelling with writing samples by children encouraged to use conventional spelling. Three first grade classes participated in this study, {{two of which are}} located in suburban school districts and one in a rural school district. Class sizes ranged from 15 to 25 students, and the children were all between the ages of 6 and 7. In each of the three classrooms, the teacher implemented the same scripted lesson which encouraged the use of invented spelling. The teachers then implemented a second lesson that required <b>a</b> <b>similar</b> <b>writing</b> task; however, during this lesson the children were strongly encouraged to spell words correctly (conventional spelling). During these lessons the teachers observed the children's spelling techniques and asked some children to talk about the strategies they used to spell the words. Upon collecting all the writing samples, each teacher counted the number of words written as well as how many words were spelled correctly. The results indicated that encouragement of invented spelling does not impact students ' abilities to spell more words correctly. Yet, it does appear to allow students to express themselves more freely by using more words in their writing. Contains 25 references. A conventional spelling lesson plan and an invented spelling lesson plan are attached. (Author/RS) Reproductions supplied by EDRS are the best that can be made from the original document...|$|E

40|$|Despite {{the growing}} number of L 2 studies {{examining}} digitally-mediated collaborative writing, the vast majority of these studies have focused on academic writing tasks. This study examined the dynamics and perceptions of groups of ESL students who used wikis to write collaborative short stories. The study also compared the short stories written in groups with posttest short stories written individually in terms of creativity, accuracy, and complexity. The study involved nine students taking a Creative Writing course in an intensive English program at a large university in the U. S. It followed a multiple case study design; the students were divided into three pairs and one triad (four case studies). For three weeks, the groups engaged in a series of wiki-based and creative writing activities and produced four collaborative short stories. During the following three-week period, the students wrote nine individual short stories using <b>a</b> <b>similar</b> <b>writing</b> prompt to the one used in the collaborative task. For each student, the collaborative and individual writing samples were compared on the three dimensions of creativity, accuracy, and complexity to examine whether collaboration influenced the quality of the product. Further, the dynamics of collaboration were explored through analyzing the wiki discussions and revision histories for each group. Finally, studentsâ€™ perceptions of the task were surveyed through individual interviews and self-assessment questionnaires. While there was not a clear effect of collaboration on the creativity and accuracy of the short stories, the complexity was slightly higher {{for the majority of the}} informants. The analysis of the short stories also indicated that ESL students faced difficulty writing in a genre that does not have a strict pre-established outline. Analysis of the wiki discussions and revision history showed trends of group dynamics in the four case studies. Further analysis of perception data revealed that although the majority of the informants had a negative perception of the collaborative task, they expressed a positive attitude toward the individual creative writing task...|$|E
