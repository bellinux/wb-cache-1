40|$|This paper studies {{incentives}} {{and loss of}} control in a hierarchy model that combines and generalizes the models of Williamson, Calvo-Wellisz and Keren-Levhari. The levels of effort from managers and workers, the wage scales, the span of control, and {{the total number of}} tiers are all endogenous. The authors show that, in <b>the</b> optimal <b>hierarchy,</b> <b>the</b> wage scales and effort levels decrease as one moves down <b>the</b> <b>hierarchy.</b> <b>As</b> <b>the</b> <b>hierarchy</b> expands with no technological progress, workers exert less effort and are paid less, top managers work harder and are paid more, and the wage distribution becomes increasingly skewed.

The Board of Trustees was also established, with Alex Firth and Ryan Chatt taking a role in both management and public relations.
