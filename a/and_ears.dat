5|$|Crocodilians are large, low-slung aquatic {{reptiles}} {{with long}} snouts and {{large numbers of}} teeth. The head and trunk are dorso-ventrally flattened and the tail is laterally compressed. It undulates {{from side to side}} to force the animal through the water when swimming. The tough keratinized scales provide body armour and some are fused to the skull. The nostrils, eyes <b>and</b> <b>ears</b> are elevated above the top of the flat head enabling them to remain above {{the surface of the water}} when the animal is floating. Valves seal the nostrils <b>and</b> <b>ears</b> when it is submerged. Unlike other reptiles, crocodilians have hearts with four chambers allowing complete separation of oxygenated and deoxygenated blood.|$|E

40|$|This {{research}} was conducted to investigate the effect of growth-promoting bacteria on yield and some traits of maize. This experiment was performed as a factorial randomized complete block design with three replications at research farm of Islamic Azad University, Izeh branch, Iran. The experimental factors included four strains of plant growth-promoting bacteria: Pseudomonas fluorescent 169 (B 1), Pseudomonas fluorescent 79 (B 2), Pseudomonas putida 108 (B 3), Pseudomonas putida 159 (B 4) and without bacteria (control, B 5) and two corn varieties namely sc 704 (A 1) and Bolson (A 2). Before planting corn seeds were soaked with liquid inoculation. Plant height, number of leaves per plant <b>and</b> <b>ear,</b> forage yield, dry matter and dry matter digestibility of leaf, stem <b>and</b> <b>ear,</b> crude protein <b>and</b> cell wall without hemicellulose in the leaf, stem <b>and</b> <b>ear</b> were evaluated. Analysis of variances showed {{that the effects of}} varieties, bacteria and their interaction on all traits were significant. Plant height, number of leaves per plant <b>and</b> <b>ear,</b> forage yield, dry matter and stem dry matter digestibility were higher in Bolson. Moreover, dry matter digestibility of leaf <b>and</b> <b>ear,</b> crude protein <b>and</b> cell wall without hemicellulose in the leaf, stem <b>and</b> <b>ear</b> of sc 704 were greater, compared to hybrid Bolson. Plant height, number of leaves per plant <b>and</b> <b>ear,</b> forage yield, dry matter and dry matter digestibility of stem <b>and</b> <b>ear</b> were greater in at the presence of fluorescent strains than those of putida strains. The results revealed that bacterial inoculation enhances the grain yield, yield components and quality of forage maize. Bolson seemed potent to outperform sc 704, though this proposition needs further examination in future field trials...|$|R

5|$|A broad muzzle {{is found}} on the river otter's flat head, and the ears are round and inconspicuous. The rhinarium is bare, with an obtuse, {{triangular}} projection. Eyes of the animal are small and placed anteriorly. A short, broad rostrum for exhaling and a long, broad cranium define the relatively flat skull. The river otter's nostrils <b>and</b> <b>ears</b> close during submersion, inhibiting water from entering them. Its vibrissae (whiskers) are long and thick, enhancing sensory perception underwater and on land.|$|E
