40|$|In {{the context}} of the civil service system reform, the new {{normative}} framework adopted in 2002 introduced a new management arrangement in public administration, whose consequence was the transition of senior positions within ministries, bodies within ministries, and government offices from political officials to positional civil servants with a limited term of office, who have thus become the most senior civil servants, called <b>administrative</b> <b>managers.</b> Based on extensive empirical research and statistical data, this article provides an in-depth analysis of the status and position of <b>administrative</b> <b>managers,</b> which is intended to serve as a test whether the apex of the Slovenian administrative system is politicized and in what form. In the so-called new democracies, politicization most often is manifested as a violation of the principles of political neutrality characteristic of a professional civil service, through personalized and biased appointments of senior civil servants and in the low degree of protection against lay-offs of civil servants on political grounds. <b>Administrative</b> <b>managers</b> thus often have to decide between political susceptibility and trustworthiness versus professionalism and professional accountability, for their tasks belong to the administrative and political realms. This poses a question about the degree of influence politicians exert on <b>administrative</b> <b>managers</b> and the rate of success with which <b>administrative</b> <b>managers</b> manage to retain their professionalism and independence, which should represent the key characteristics of a senior civil servant. </p...|$|R

40|$|Institutional {{responses}} {{to changes in}} the higher education environment have caused movements in the roles and identities of <b>administrative</b> <b>managers</b> in UK universities. These shifts have highlighted the problem for individuals of balancing traditional public service considerations of administration with institutional innovation and development. <b>Administrative</b> <b>managers</b> find themselves not only acting as independent arbiters, giving impartial advice on the basis of professional expertise, but also becoming involved in political judgements about institutional futures. They increasingly undertake an interpretive function between the various communities of the university and its external partners. As the boundaries of the university have become more permeable, administrative and academic management have inter-digitated, and hybrid roles have developed. In undertaking increasingly complex functions, therefore, <b>administrative</b> <b>managers</b> {{play a critical role in}} linking the academic and executive arms of governance in the university...|$|R
40|$|My purpose {{with this}} paper was to examine how four of the <b>administrative</b> <b>managers</b> at health and care, at the {{municipality}} perceive their communicative roles and how that affects the municipality. I also wanted to examine how a communicative leadership can be expressed {{and what kind of}} support a communicative leader needs. I used a qualitative method and semi structured interview to perform my study. I have chosen to analyze my results from the study with the help of theories about the difference between information and communication, how the perception of communication and information has changed over time, how different ideal types of communicative leadership is experienced and what the requirements are for a good communicative leadership. The results of the study show that the perceptioncommunication in relation to information differs between the <b>administrative</b> <b>managers.</b> The managers mainly communicate with the employees in group. If the communication concerns the daily job, the managers choose to handle it themselves. They all think that a consistent and professional communication favors the municipality in whole.
