5|$|Circinus is a faint constellation, {{with only}} one star {{brighter}} than fourth magnitude.

The distance between the two stars is 260AU <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>take</b> 2600years to rotate around a common centre of gravity. The second brightest star is Beta Circini, a white main sequence star of spectral type A3Va and a magnitude of 4.07, about 100light-years away. It has around 1.8times the diameter of the Sun.|$|E

In December 1979, Valene and Gary are reunited once more in Dallas, and get married for the second time. Gary's parents, Jock Ewing (Jim Davis) and Miss Ellie Ewing (Barbara Bel Geddes), as well as Gary's brother, Bobby (Patrick Duffy), and sister-in-law Pamela Barnes Ewing (Victoria Principal), attend the wedding.
