5|$|Circinus is a faint constellation, {{with only}} one star {{brighter}} than fourth magnitude.

The distance between the two stars is 260AU <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>take</b> 2600years to rotate around a common centre of gravity. The second brightest star is Beta Circini, a white main sequence star of spectral type A3Va and a magnitude of 4.07, about 100light-years away. It has around 1.8times the diameter of the Sun.|$|E
