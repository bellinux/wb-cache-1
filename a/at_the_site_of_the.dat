5|$|Acne scars {{are caused}} by {{inflammation}} within the dermal layer of skin and are estimated to affect 95% of people with acne vulgaris. The scar is created by abnormal healing following this dermal inflammation. Scarring {{is most likely to}} take place with severe acne, but may occur with any form of acne vulgaris. Acne scars are classified based on whether the abnormal healing response following dermal inflammation leads to excess collagen deposition or loss <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>site</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> acne lesion.|$|E

40|$|In the {{preceding}} paper {{it was reported}} (1) that the intravascular injection of toxins of B. typhosus, B. coli, or meningococcus produced hemorrhages or hemorrhagic necrosis in the skin <b>of</b> guinea pigs <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>site</b> <b>of</b> reaction to diphtheria toxin or silver nitrate. Furthermore, it was described that similar injections of toxins failed to cause hemorrhages in the skin <b>of</b> guinea pigs <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>site</b> <b>of</b> injections of other irritants such as horse serum in guinea pigs sensitized to it, or turpentine or broth. Recently, I have reported very briefly the observation that in a tuberculous guinea pig the skin becomes hemorrhagic <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>site</b> <b>of</b> positive tuberculin tests when products of typhoid bacilli are injected intravascularly. The {{purpose of the present}} paper is to discuss the occurrence of hemorrhagic reactions in tuberculous guinea pigs <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>site</b> <b>of</b> injection of certain irritants following intravascular injections of various injurious substances...|$|R

5|$|Early in 1925, a {{foundation}} pile and some tents {{could be found}} <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>site</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> future bridge.

Similarly government debt was increasing, although it was still expected the railway line to Abbotsford Bridge would be completed. In November, construction started and it was expected that the bridge would be opened around 25 September the following year.|$|E
5|$|Eventually Henderson leased two {{properties}} in Essex Street for £250 per year, <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>site</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> modern-day Esplanade Hotel.

Whilst he favoured Mount Eliza due to its height, which gave it pleasing vistas and supposedly healthier air, Governor Charles Fitzgerald rejected that proposal. Henderson ultimately settled on the current site on a hill overlooking Fremantle.|$|E
