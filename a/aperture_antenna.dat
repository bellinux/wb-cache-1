40|$|This book is {{intended}} as an advanced text for courses in antennas, {{with a focus}} on the mature but vital background field of <b>aperture</b> <b>antennas.</b> The book is aimed at final year, MSc, PhD and Post-Doctoral students, as well as readers who are moving from academia into industry, beginning careers as wireless engineers, system designers, in R&D, or for practising engineers. It assumes the reader has undertaken an earlier course of study on Maxwell's equations, fields and waves. Some of these topics are summarised in the early few chapters in order to provide continuity and background for the remaining chapters. The <b>aperture</b> <b>antennas</b> covered include the main types of horns, reflectors and arrays as well as microstrip patches, reflectarrays and lenses. To provide more than a superficial treatment of arrays, the topic of mutual coupling is covered in greater detail than most similar books in the area. Also included is an introduction to arrays on non-planar surfaces, which is of importance for applications that involve curved surfaces such as in aerodynamics or for making <b>aperture</b> <b>antennas</b> unobtrusive. A chapter is included on some modern <b>aperture</b> <b>antennas</b> to illustrate design techniques beyond the most common types of <b>aperture</b> <b>antennas</b> described in the early chapters. This is to show where advances have recently been made and where they could be improved in the future. Also included are selected topics of a practical nature for <b>aperture</b> <b>antennas,</b> namely fabrication and measurement. 430 page(s...|$|R

5000|$|Small antennas {{around one}} {{wavelength}} in size, such as quarter-wave monopoles and half-wave dipoles, don't have much directivity (gain); they are omnidirectional antennas which radiate radio waves {{over a wide}} angle. To create a high gain antenna, which radiates radio waves in a narrow beam, two general techniques can be used. One technique is to use large metal surfaces such as parabolic reflectors, horns or dielectric lenses which change {{the direction of the}} radio waves by reflection or refraction, to focus the radio waves from a single low gain antenna into a beam. This type is called an <b>aperture</b> <b>antenna.</b>|$|E

50|$|Five large {{parabolic}} ("dish") antennas {{are located}} at the Goldstone site to handle the workload, since {{at any given time}} the DSN is responsible for maintaining communication with up to 30 spacecraft. The antennas function similarly to a home satellite dish. However, since the spacecraft they communicate with are much further away than the communication satellites which home satellite dishes use, the signals received are much weaker, requiring a larger <b>aperture</b> <b>antenna</b> to gather enough radio energy to make them intelligible. The largest, a 70-meter (230 ft) Cassegrain antenna, is used for communication with space missions to the outer planets, such as the Voyager spacecraft, at 20 billion kilometers the most distant manmade object from Earth. The radio frequencies used for spacecraft communication are in the microwave part of the radio spectrum; S band (2.29 - 2.30 GHz), X band (8.40 - 8.50 GHz) and the Ka band (31.8 - 32.3 GHz). In addition to receiving radio signals from the spacecraft (called downlink signals), the antennas transmit commands to the spacecraft (called uplink signals) with high power radio transmitters powered by klystron tubes.|$|E
