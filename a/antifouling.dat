25|$|A {{variety of}} <b>antifouling</b> methods have {{historically}} been implemented to combat biofouling. Recently, scientists have begun researching <b>antifouling</b> methods inspired by living organisms. This type of design imitation is known as biomimicry.|$|E
25|$|<b>Antifouling</b> {{coatings}} {{are often}} used on nylon nets because the process is more economical than manual cleaning. When nylon nets are coated with <b>antifouling</b> compounds, the coatings repel biofouling {{for a period of}} time, usually between several weeks to several months. However, the nets eventually succumb to biofouling. <b>Antifouling</b> coatings containing cuprous oxide algaecide/biocide are the coatings technology used almost exclusively in the fish farming industry today. The treatments usually flake off within a few weeks to six to eight months.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to their <b>antifouling</b> benefits, copper alloys have strong structural and corrosion-resistant properties in marine environments.|$|E
25|$|The <b>antifouling</b> {{characteristics}} of PEG are well documented, but the service life of PEG <b>antifouling</b> coatings is debated {{due to the}} hydrolysis of PEG chains in air, {{as well as by}} the low concentrations of transition metal ions present in seawater. Using DOPA residues as attachment points, new polymers similar in structure to the polypeptide backbone of proteins are being investigated, such as peptidomimetic polymer (PMP1). PMP1 uses a repeat unit of N-substituted glycine instead of ethylene glycol to impart <b>antifouling</b> properties. The N-substituted glycine is structurally similar to ethylene glycol and is hydrophilic, so easily dissolves in water. In controlled studies, PMP1-coated titanium surfaces were seen to be resistant to biofouling over a period of 180 days, even with continued addition and exposure to microfouling organisms.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the more}} common methods of <b>antifouling</b> comes from growing polymer chains from a surface, often by poly(ethylene glycol) or PEG. However, {{challenges}} exist in creating a functionalized surface to which PEG chains may be grown, especially in aqueous environments. Researchers {{have been able to}} study the methods by which the common blue mussel Mytilus edulis is able to adhere to solid surfaces in marine environments using mussel adhesive proteins, or MAPs. MAPs typically comprise several proteins, of which the most common repeating sequence is Ala-Lys-Pro-Ser-Tyr-trans-2,3-cis-3,4-dihydroxyproline (DHP) -Hyp-Thr-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (DOPA) -Lys. The inclusion of the hydroxylated DHP and DOPA amino acids is thought to contribute to the adhesive nature of the MAPs. Recent studies have looked into using a short chain of DOPA residues as an adhesive end-group for <b>antifouling</b> PEG polymers which show promise in adsorbing onto certain metal surfaces. Increasing the number of DOPA residues to three greatly improves the total amount of adsorbed DOPA-PEG polymers and exhibits <b>antifouling</b> properties exceeding most other 'grafting-to' polymeric functionalization methods.|$|E
25|$|In the {{aquaculture}} industry, sound {{animal husbandry}} translates to keeping fish clean, well fed, healthy, and not overcrowded. One solution to keeping farmed fish healthy is to contain them in <b>antifouling</b> copper alloy nets and structures.|$|E
25|$|Materials {{research}} into superior <b>antifouling</b> surfaces for fluidized bed reactors suggest that low wettability plastics such as Polyvinyl chloride ("PVC"), high-density polyethylene and polymethylmethacrylate ("plexiglas") demonstrate a high correlation between their resistance to bacterial adhesion and their hydrophobicity.|$|E
25|$|Multi-Parametric Surface Plasmon Resonance {{is one of}} {{the methods}} to study barrier {{properties}} of natural, modified or coated nanocellulose. The different <b>antifouling,</b> moisture, solvent, antimicrobial barrier formulation quality can be measured on the nanoscale. The adsorption kinetics as well as the degree of swelling can be measured in real-time and label-free.|$|E
25|$|L-DOPA {{is a key}} {{compound}} {{in the formation of}} marine adhesive proteins, such as those found in mussels. It is believed to be responsible for the water-resistance and rapid curing abilities of these proteins. L-DOPA may also be used to prevent surfaces from fouling by bonding <b>antifouling</b> polymers to a susceptible substrate.|$|E
25|$|<b>Antifouling</b> is {{the ability}} of {{specifically}} designed materials and coatings to remove or prevent biofouling by any number of organisms on wetted surfaces. Since biofouling can occur almost anywhere water is present, biofouling poses risks {{to a wide variety of}} objects such as medical devices and membranes, as well as to entire industries, such as paper manufacturing, food processing, underwater construction, and desalination plants.|$|E
25|$|One isothiazolinone, Sea-Nine 211 (4,5-dichloro-2-n-octyl-4-isothiazolino-3-one, DCOI), has quickly {{replaced}} tributyltin as the <b>antifouling</b> {{agent of}} choice in ship hull paint. A recent study reported the presence of DCOI in both port water and sediment samples in Osaka, Japan, especially in weakly circulating mooring areas. Of environmental concern, DCOI levels predicted in marinas now are considered a threat to various marine invertebrate species. Isothiazolinones also are extremely toxic to fish.|$|E
25|$|To combat biofouling, {{operators}} often implement costly maintenance measures, such as frequent net changing, cleaning/removal {{of unwanted}} organisms from nets, net repairs, and chemical treatment including antimicrobial coatings on nylon nets. The cost of <b>antifouling</b> a single salmon net can be several thousand British pounds. In some {{sectors of the}} European aquaculture industry, cleaning biofouled fish and shellfish pens can cost 5–20% of its market value. Heavy fouling can reduce the saleable product in nets by 60–90%.|$|E
25|$|Port Royal left {{dry dock}} at Pearl Harbor on 24 September 2009 for final repairs and {{assessment}} before being returned to duty. While in dry dock, technicians from BAE Systems and the navy replaced the cruiser's sonar dome, reinstalled rudders, and made structural repairs to the ship's tanks, superstructure, and underwater hull. In addition, four sections of shafting were replaced, struts {{that support the}} propulsion shafts were realigned, and the underwater hull was repainted with blue <b>antifouling</b> paint.|$|E
25|$|Biofouled nets are {{replaced}} {{after several months}} of service, depending on environmental conditions, in a complicated, costly, and labor-intensive operation that involves divers and specialized personnel. During this process, live fish in nets must be transferred to clean pens, which causes undue stress and asphyxiation that results in some loss of fish. Biofouled nets that can be reused are washed on land via manual brushing and scrubbing or high-pressure water hosing. They are then dried and re-impregnated with <b>antifouling</b> coatings.|$|E
25|$|It is the {{combination}} {{of all of these}} properties – <b>antifouling,</b> high strength, and corrosion resistance – that has made copper alloys a desirable material for such marine applications as condenser tubing, water intake screens, ship hulls, offshore structure, and sheathing. In the past 25 years or so, the benefits of copper alloys have caught the attention of the marine aquaculture industry. The industry is now actively deploying copper alloy netting and structural materials in commercial large-scale fish farming operations around the world.|$|E
25|$|There {{are several}} {{companies}} that offer alternatives to paint-based <b>antifouling,</b> using ultrasonic transducers mounted in {{or around the}} hull of small to medium-sized boats. Research has shown these systems can help reduce fouling, by initiating bursts of ultrasonic waves through the hull medium to the surrounding water, killing or denaturing the algae and other micro-organisms that form {{the beginning of the}} fouling sequence. The systems cannot work on wooden-hulled boats, or boats with a soft-cored composite material, such as wood or foam. The systems have been loosely based on technology proven to control algae blooms.|$|E
25|$|The University of New Hampshire is in {{the midst}} of {{conducting}} experiments under the auspices of the International Copper Association (ICA) to evaluate the structural, hydrodynamic, and <b>antifouling</b> response of copper alloy nets. Factors to be determined from these experiments, such as drag, pen dynamic loads, material loss, and biological growth – well documented for nylon netting but not fully understood for copper-nickel alloy nets – will help to design fish pen enclosures made from these alloys. The East China Sea Fisheries Research Institute, in Shanghai, China, is also conducting experimental investigations on copper alloys for ICA.|$|E
25|$|One {{trend of}} {{research}} {{is the study of}} the relationship between wettability and anti-fouling effectiveness. Another trend is the study of living organisms as the inspiration for new functional materials. An example of biomimetic <b>antifouling</b> research was conducted at the University of Florida into how marine animals such as dolphins and sharks are able to effectively deter biofouling on their skin. Researchers examined the nanoscale structure of sharks and designed an anti-fouling surface known commercially as Sharklet. Studies show that the nanoscale topologies function not only due to the reduction of sites for macrofoulers to attach, but also due to the same thermodynamic barrier that any surface with low wettability presents.|$|E
25|$|Specifically, {{the buildup}} of {{biofouling}} on marine vessels poses a significant problem. In some instances, the hull structure and propulsion systems can be damaged. The accumulation of biofoulers on hulls can increase both the hydrodynamic volume of a vessel and the hydrodynamic friction, leading to increased drag of up to 60%. The drag increase has been seen to decrease speeds by up to 10%, which can require up to a 40% increase in fuel to compensate. With fuel typically comprising {{up to half of}} marine transport costs, <b>antifouling</b> methods are estimated to save the shipping industry around $60 billion per year. Increased fuel use due to biofouling contributes to adverse environmental effects and is predicted to increase emissions of carbon dioxide and sulfur dioxide between 38 and 72% by 2020.|$|E
25|$|There {{are several}} web {{articles}} claiming that formaldehyde has been banned from manufacture or import into the European Union (EU) under REACH (Registration, Evaluation, Authorization, and restriction of Chemical substances) legislation. This {{appears to be}} misinformation, as official EU chemical databases contradict these claims as of February 19, 2010. This misconception has gained some ground. Formaldehyde is not listed in the Annex I of Regulation (EC) No 689/2008 (export and import of dangerous chemicals regulation), nor on a priority list for risk assessment. However, formaldehyde is banned from use in certain applications (preservatives for liquid-cooling and processing systems, slimicides, metalworking-fluid preservatives, and <b>antifouling</b> products) under the Biocidal Products Directive. In the EU, the maximum allowed concentration of formaldehyde in finished products is 0.2%, and any product that exceeds 0.05% has to include a warning that the product contains formaldehyde.|$|E
500|$|Zinc {{chloride}} {{is often}} added to lumber as a fire retardant and sometimes as a wood preservative. It {{is used in}} the manufacture of other chemicals. Zinc methyl (...) is used in a number of organic syntheses. Zinc sulfide (ZnS) is used in luminescent pigments such as on the hands of clocks, X-ray and television screens, and luminous paints. Crystals of ZnS are used in lasers that operate in the mid-infrared part of the spectrum. Zinc sulfate is a chemical in dyes and pigments. Zinc pyrithione is used in <b>antifouling</b> paints.|$|E
2500|$|The {{inventor}} of an <b>antifouling</b> paint was Captain (Schiffskapitan) Ferdinand Gravert, born 1847 in Glückstadt, Germany (then Denmark). He sold his formula in 1913 at Taltal, Chile.|$|E
2500|$|Cyclotides {{have been}} {{reported}} to have a wide range of biological activities, including anti-HIV, insecticidal, anti-tumour, <b>antifouling,</b> anti-microbial, hemolytic, neurotensin antagonism, trypsin inhibition, and uterotonic activities. [...] An ability to induce uterine contractions was what prompted the initial discovery of kalata B1.|$|E
60|$|The Rio Negro {{was old and}} ugly, {{with short}} iron masts from which clumsy {{derricks}} hung, tall, upright funnel, and blistered, gray paint. Her boats were dirty and stained by soot, and a belt of rust at her waterline hinted at neglect, but no barnacles and weed marred the smoothness of the plates below. Her <b>antifouling</b> paint was clean, and her lines beneath the swell of quarter and bows were fine. In fact, the Rio Negro was faster than she looked when she carried her regular load of two thousand tons and her under-water body was hidden. She traded in the Gulf of Mexico and the Caribbean, and at certain ports Customs officials carefully scrutinized her papers. At others, they smiled and allowed her captain privileges that strangers did not get.|$|E
50|$|<b>Antifouling</b> {{paints and}} other related {{coatings}} are routinely used to prevent the buildup of microorganisms and other animals, such as barnacles for the bottom hull surfaces of recreational, commercial and military sea vessels. Ablative paints are often utilized for this purpose to prevent the dilution or deactivation of the <b>antifouling</b> agent. Over time, the paint will slowly decompose in the water, exposing fresh <b>antifouling</b> compounds on the surface. Engineering the <b>antifouling</b> agents and the ablation rate can produce long-lived protection from the deleterious effects of biofouling.|$|E

50|$|Poly-APs {{and other}} natural 3- alkylpyridine are {{effective}} on preventing microbial film formation and the tests also confirm that poly-APs form <b>antifouling</b> activities.

Moreover, there is a pic of production of <b>antifouling</b> compounds during spring.|$|E

50|$|One {{class of}} {{biomimetic}} <b>antifouling</b> coatings {{is inspired by}} the surface of shark skin, which consists of nanoscale overlapping plates that exhibit parallel ridges that effectively prevent sharks from becoming fouled even when moving at slow speeds. The <b>antifouling</b> qualities of the shark skin-inspired designs appear highly dependent upon the engineered roughness index (ERI).|$|E
50|$|Biomimetic <b>antifouling</b> {{coatings}} {{are highly}} lucrative {{because of their}} low environmental impact and demonstrated success. Some properties of a biomimetic <b>antifouling</b> coating can be predicted from the contact angles obtained from the Wenzel equation, and the calculated ERI. Natural materials such as shark skin continue to provide inspiration for scientists to improve the coatings currently on the market.|$|E
