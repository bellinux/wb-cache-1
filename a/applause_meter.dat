25|$|The audience's {{enthusiastic}} ovations {{pushed the}} <b>applause</b> <b>meter</b> to its apex, winning {{the competition for}} her. After the Godfrey show, listeners began calling their local radio stations to request the song, so she released it as a single. Although Cline had been performing {{for almost a decade}} and had appeared on national TV three times, it took Godfrey to make her a star. For a couple of weeks thereafter, Cline appeared regularly on Godfrey's radio program. Disagreements over creative control caused Godfrey to fire her.|$|E
2500|$|Paul {{participated in}} ABC News's Republican presidential debate at Drake University in Des Moines, Iowa on August 5. Time Magazine's Mark Halperin {{evaluated}} Paul's performance [...] "crowd-pleasing," [...] and added, [...] "if the Republicans nominated a candidate based on who most moved the <b>applause</b> <b>meter,</b> Paul would be giving {{his acceptance speech}} next summer." [...] Paul was the favorite of an on-line poll at ABCNews.com, winning 63 percent of votes.|$|E
50|$|In {{the later}} version, {{the winner of}} the first half, {{determined}} by an audience <b>applause</b> <b>meter,</b> then competed against a returning champion in the second half. After both champion and challenger, in that order, have performed, the audience <b>applause</b> <b>meter</b> determines the champion, who receives $1000 cash, the opportunity to return the following week, and a week's engagement at a popular nightspot.|$|E
5000|$|The harsher the {{circumstances}} under which the contestant labored, the likelier the studio audience was to ring the <b>applause</b> <b>meter's</b> highest level. The winner, to the musical accompaniment of [...] "Pomp and Circumstance", would be draped in a sable-trimmed red velvet robe, given a glittering jeweled crown to wear, placed on a velvet-upholstered throne, and handed a dozen long-stemmed roses to hold as she wept, often uncontrollably, while her list of prizes was announced.|$|R
50|$|Using {{the classic}} <b>applause</b> <b>meter,</b> as did many game and hit parade-style shows of the time, Queen for a Day {{had its own}} special twist: Each {{contestant}} had to talk publicly about the recent financial and emotional hard times she had been through. The <b>applause</b> <b>meter</b> had also been used on earlier series, including Fred Allen's Judge for Yourself, a variety and game show which aired on NBC from 1953 to 1954.|$|E
5000|$|Birmingham Mail {{described}} the song as [...] "delightful", while The Tab deemed it a [...] "classic". <b>Applause</b> <b>Meter</b> called it [...] "sweetly charming" [...] and VCOnStage called it [...] "operatic".|$|E
50|$|The {{songs were}} {{performed}} by a regular cast of Bob Carroll, the Skylarks, Kitty Kallen (two episodes), and Judy Johnson. The winning judge of the songs was {{selected on the basis}} of <b>applause</b> <b>meter</b> voting by the studio audience, a format also adopted thereafter on the NBC/ABC daytime reality show, Queen for a Day, hosted by Jack Bailey.|$|E
50|$|The {{judging system}} was {{changed for the}} third and final season of Pick the Stars. Three judges were now located in various Canadian cities outside the studio and communicated their votes through {{telephone}} calls. There was no longer a competition for the entire season but rather winners were determined per episode. An <b>applause</b> <b>meter</b> was also used to determine winners.|$|E
5000|$|On Letters to Laugh-In, a {{short-lived}} spin-off daytime show hosted by Gary Owens, cast members read jokes sent in by viewers, which were scored by <b>applause</b> <b>meter.</b> The eventual winning joke was read by actress Jill St. John: [...] "What {{do you get}} when you cross an elephant with a jar of peanut butter? A 500 pound sandwich that sticks to the roof of your mouth!" ...|$|E

5000|$|In an {{interview}} in the Paris Review, literary critic Harold Bloom said about slamming:I can't bear these accounts I read in the Times and elsewhere of these poetry slams, in which various {{young men and women}} in various late-spots are declaiming rant and nonsense at each other. The whole thing is judged by an <b>applause</b> <b>meter</b> which is actually not there, but might as well be. This isn't even silly; it is the death of art.|$|E
50|$|A clap-o-meter, clapometer or <b>applause</b> <b>meter</b> is a {{measurement}} instrument that purports {{to measure and}} display the volume of clapping or applause made by an audience. It {{can be used to}} indicate the popularity of contestants and decide the result of competitions based on audience popularity. Specific implementations {{may or may not be}} based on an actual sound level meters. Clap-o-meters were a popular element in talent shows and television game shows in the 1950s and 1960s, most notably Opportunity Knocks, but have been since been supplanted by other, more sophisticated, methods of measuring audience response.|$|E
5000|$|Kids' Court (Nickelodeon, 1988-94) In {{a case of}} real {{audience}} participation, [...] "legal cases" [...] {{of interest}} to kids who must pay {{for such things as}} a broken walkman, phone calls private, punishment for bullying, etc., are presented for judgment. The plaintiffs and defendants are picked from the 8- to 13-year-old audience, given about 15 minutes to review the particulars of their character and the facts of their case, and it is left up to them to present the most convincing case. The presiding judge is [...] "the honorable Judge O. Meter", an <b>applause</b> <b>meter</b> {{in the shape of a}} wigged jurist. After the jury cheers its approval, whichever side has the better reading on the barometer is the victor.|$|E
5000|$|Freestyle reining {{allows a}} horse and rider team to {{incorporate}} reining movements into a three and one-half minute musical routine, akin to the KUR Freestyle competition in Dressage, but with elements that resemble the freestyle events in human competitions such as figure skating. Under NRHA rules, costumes are allowed, though not required; riders may ride with one, two or even no hands on any type of NRHA approved bit; props, within certain limits, are allowed; and the show management may allow special arena lighting. Freestyle reining competitions have no specific rules as to saddle, though humane equipment is required. Allowing [...] "no hands" [...] means that some competitors may perform without a bridle, which increases {{the difficulty of the}} movements. The rider must include a specified number of spins, stops and flying lead changes in a performance. Rollbacks, rein backs and dressage type maneuvers such as the half-pass may be added and scored. Competitors are judged on technical merit and artistic impression. At some competitions, an <b>applause</b> <b>meter</b> is added and may contribute to the artistic impression portion of the score.|$|E
5000|$|On January 28, 1957, Cline {{was invited}} to perform a song on the CBS {{television}} program hosted by Arthur Godfrey entitled, Arthur Godfrey's Talent Scouts. She originally intended to perform [...] "A Poor Man's Roses (Or a Rich Man's Gold)" [...] on the show; instead the show's producers preferred [...] "Walkin' After Midnight". Although Cline {{did not want to}} sing it, she performed the song during the program's 8:30 pm slot. The excessive amount of audience applause caused a technical difficulty and froze the <b>applause</b> <b>meter</b> on the show. Because of the great amount of applause, Cline won first place in the show that night. And because of the song's popularity on the show, Decca Records (Four Star leased their music to Decca) released [...] "Walkin' After Midnight" [...] as a single on February 11, 1957. The song quickly debuted on the Billboard charts, eventually peaking at No. 2 on the Hot Country Songs chart and No. 12 on the Pop chart by March 3. [...] "A Poor Man's Roses (Or a Rich Man's Gold)" [...] was released as the single's B-side, also charting on the Billboard Country chart at No. 14. Because [...] "Walkin' After Midnight" [...] had become a significant hit, Decca issued Cline's debut album August 5, 1957, simply titled, Patsy Cline. The album, however, did not contain the flip side.|$|E
40|$|Terminal Time is {{a machine}} that {{constructs}} ideologically-biased documentary histories in response to audience feedback. The audience answers multiple-choice questions via an <b>applause</b> <b>meter.</b> The {{answers to these questions}} influence which historical events are chosen from a knowledge base, how these events will be slanted to embody the bias implied in the audience's answers, and how the events will be connected together to form a historical nar-rative. Once the narrative has been generated, video and sound clips are selected from a term-indexed multimedia database. The resulting documentary, consisting of the newly generated narrative spoken by a speech synthesizer, and the video and sound clips, is then presented to the audience. ...|$|E
