5|$|The only {{surviving}} {{record of}} the trial is the speech given by Theomnestus and Apollodorus against Neaira and Stephanus, and the outcome is unknown. No records of Neaira exist after the trial. Modern commentators have noted the weaknesses in Apollodorus' arguments, though as the outcome of an Athenian trial depended heavily on what the parties involved could persuade the jury to accept, <b>and</b> <b>how</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> their dishonesty they could get away with, we cannot say for certain that the suit failed.|$|E
5|$|However, {{the true}} authorship of the work, its actual date, and its purpose, {{have long been}} matters for {{controversy}} amongst historians and scholars, ever since Hermann Dessau in 1889 rejected both the date and the authorship as stated within the manuscript. Major problems include {{the nature of the}} sources it used, <b>and</b> <b>how</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> the content is pure fiction. For instance, the collection contains in all about 150 alleged documents, including 68 letters, 60 speeches and proposals to the people or the senate, and 20 senatorial decrees and acclamations. Virtually all of these are now considered to be fraudulent.|$|E
5|$|Modern {{commentators}} of Thucydides, {{with other}} modern historians and writers, take varying stances {{on the issue}} of how much of the speeches of Pericles, as given by this historian, do actually represent Pericles' own words <b>and</b> <b>how</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> them is free literary creation or paraphrase by Thucydides. Since Pericles never wrote down or distributed his orations, no historians are able to answer this with certainty; Thucydides recreated three of them from memory and, thereby, it cannot be ascertained that he did not add his own notions and thoughts.|$|E

25|$|When Genie {{left the}} Riglers' house in mid-1975, {{at the age}} of 18, she had {{acquired}} a degree of vocabulary and grammar far greater than that observed in non-human subjects. In June of that year, David Rigler wrote that she continued to make significant strides in every field which the scientists were testing. Despite the marked improvement in Genie's language, it was still clearly abnormal. The words she learned continued to remain far ahead of the grammar she possessed and still showed an unusual focus on objective properties, and the gap between her receptive and expressive vocabulary had grown. While her use and comprehension of grammar had clearly improved, and papers from the time indicated she was continuing to acquire it, they were still highly deficient and her progress remained far slower than linguists had anticipated. <b>And</b> <b>how</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> what she did use was attributable to acquisition versus rote memory was not readily obvious.|$|E

25|$|Within the novels, {{opponents of}} the Culture {{have argued that the}} role of humans in the Culture is nothing more than that of pets, or parasites on Culture Minds, and that they can have nothing {{genuinely}} useful to contribute to a society where science is close to omniscient about the physical universe, where every ailment has been cured, and where every thought can be read. Many of the Culture novels in fact contain characters (from within or without the Culture) wondering how far-reaching the Minds' dominance of the Culture is, <b>and</b> <b>how</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> the democratic process within it might in fact be a sham: subtly but very powerfully influenced by the Minds in much the same ways Contact and Special Circumstances influence other societies.

25|$|How much of {{the blame}} for the fall from power in Egypt of the Brotherhood and its allied Freedom and Justice Party (FJP) can be placed on the Brotherhood, <b>and</b> <b>how</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> it can be placed on its enemies in the Egyptian bureaucracy, media and {{security}} establishment is disputed. The Mubarak government’s state media portrayed the Brotherhood as secretive and illegal, and numerous TV channels such as OnTv spent much on air time vilifying the organization. But the Brotherhood took a number of controversial steps and also acquiesced to or supported crackdowns by the military during Morsi’s presidency. Before the revolution, the Muslim Brotherhood’s supporters appeared at a protest at Al-Azhar University wearing military-style fatigues, after which the Mubarak government accused the organization of starting an underground militia. When it came to power, the Muslim Brotherhood indeed tried to establish armed groups of supporters and it sought official permission for its members to be armed.|$|E

Morton's new position was {{to advise the}} president on domestic and economic policy. In addition, Morton was {{to serve as the}} special liaison to the political committee to elect President Ford. Morton's duties blurred the line between his public and political duties, and caused controversy concerning how Morton would divide his time between the White House and Ford's election campaign, <b>and</b> <b>how</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> his salary would be supplied by taxpayers versus the Ford election committee. In rebuttal, Morton stated [...] "you can't separate government from politics", and that Presidential aides should be allowed to offer political advice.|$|E
