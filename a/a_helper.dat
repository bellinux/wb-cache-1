5|$|Mao Zedong {{had been}} born and raised at his father's farm in Shaoshanchong, a small rural village named for the nearby Shaoshan mountain. His disciplinarian father, Mao Yichang, had decided to deal with Zedong's rebellious {{attitude}} in a manner typical of the time, by forcing him into an arranged marriage that would compel him to take family matters seriously. Yichang also desired <b>a</b> <b>helper</b> for his own wife, Wen Qimei, whose health had deteriorated through years of heavy agricultural labour. He selected Luo Yixiu in either late 1907 or 1908. Her kinship to the Maos may have helped in this selection, as Luo Yixiu's mother's four brothers, surnamed Mao, lived only two li (1 km) from Mao Yichang's home in Shaoshanchong. Following traditional procedures, a matchmaker would {{have been sent to}} the Luo family house, and the Luo family would have been socially expected to accept the marriage proposal immediately. Luo Helou was happy to see his eldest daughter married. The two families exchanged gifts and signed the marriage contract, after which the marriage was considered inviolable.|$|E
5|$|Over {{half the}} red-backed fairywrens {{in an area}} {{can be found in}} pairs during the mating season. This is {{apparently}} a defence against the resource-limited nature of the environment. It is more difficult to maintain a larger interdependent group during dry spells, so the birds try to stay in pairs or smaller groups, which include adults that help parents look after young. Paternity tests have shown that an older male with bright plumage has much more success in the mating season and can mate with more than one female. Accordingly, it has higher sperm storage and makes more mating overtures towards females. A male with browner and less bright plumage or a younger male with bright plumage has a much lower success rate than a bright, older male for mating. Further, an unpaired male serves as <b>a</b> <b>helper</b> to a mated pair in feeding and care of young. When the male pairs his bill darkens, and this happens within three weeks. This is much easier to control than plumage, as moulting takes time and is controlled by seasonality. The bill is vascular and much easier to change in response to the pairings.|$|E

40|$|Thesis (M. Ed.) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2006. In South African {{secondary}} schools there are learners who undergo a daily struggle with {{social and emotional}} problems. The problems learners struggle with include problems like drug and alcohol abuse, suicide, domestic violence, peer pressure, anorexia, bulimia, stress, bullying, and many more. These problems often result in learners experiencing {{a great deal of}} pressure. They sometimes feel hopeless as they fail to find suitable solutions for their problems. They often feel alone and as though there is no one whom they can share their problems with and who truly understands. <b>A</b> Peer <b>Helper</b> Programme is <b>a</b> programme that focuses on training a selective group of learners to be peer <b>helpers.</b> <b>A</b> peer <b>helper</b> is someone who understands or someone of {{more or less the same}} age as the person seeking for help, has empathy, good listening and communication skills, and offers help and understanding in times of need. A literature study has been undertaken to give the precise description of the concept of peer help, to determine the task and function of <b>a</b> peer <b>helper</b> and to establish what exactly the training of <b>a</b> peer <b>helper</b> should encompass. The results obtained from this information allowed the setting of guidelines for the implementing of <b>a</b> peer <b>helper</b> programme for the effective training of peer helpers. An empirical study was executed to establish the nature and scope of the problems learners in {{secondary schools}} in the Klerksdorp school district experience and their needs concerning peer helping. From this study it was concluded that a need exists for peer helping programmes as well as guidelines for the design and implementation of <b>a</b> peer <b>helper</b> programme. Questionnaires were used and the following can be concluded from the investigation: There is an existing need for <b>a</b> peer <b>helper</b> programme as learners who experience problems will rather share this with a peer before telling an older person. A set of guidelines need to be put into place for the implementation of <b>a</b> peer <b>helper</b> programme. To conclude the recommendation is made at the end of this study that <b>a</b> peer <b>helper</b> programme needs to be implemented in every school in the various school districts and that it should stand under the management of the school principle and the assistance of the guidance teacher.

40|$|The {{parvovirus}} {{adeno-associated virus}} (AAV) contains a small single-stranded DNA genome with inverted terminal repeats that form hairpin structures. In order to propagate, AAV {{relies on the}} cellular replication machinery together with functions supplied by coinfecting helper viruses such as adenovirus (Ad). Here, we examined the host cell response to AAV replication {{in the context of}} <b>Ad</b> or <b>Ad</b> <b>helper</b> proteins. We show that AAV and Ad coinfection activates a DNA damage response (DDR) that is distinct from that seen during Ad or AAV infection alone. The DDR was also triggered when AAV replicated in the presence of minimal <b>Ad</b> <b>helper</b> proteins. We detected autophosphorylation of the kinases ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM) and DNA-dependent protein kinase catalytic subunit (DNA-PKcs) and signaling to downstream targets SMC 1, Chk 1, Chk 2, H 2 AX, and XRCC 4 and multiple sites on RPA 32. The Mre 11 complex was not required for activation of the DDR to AAV infection. Additionally, we found that DNA-PKcs was the primary mediator of damage signaling in response to AAV replication. Immunofluorescence revealed that some activated damage proteins were found in a pan-nuclear pattern (phosphorylated ATM, SMC 1, and H 2 AX), while others such as DNA-PK components (DNA-PKcs, Ku 70, and Ku 86) and RPA 32 accumulated at AAV replication centers. Although expression of the large viral Rep proteins contributed to some damage signaling, we observed that the full response required replication of the AAV genome. Our results demonstrate that AAV replication in the presence of <b>Ad</b> <b>helper</b> functions elicits <b>a</b> unique damage response controlled by DNA-PK...|$|R

25|$|At {{this point}} chronic {{inflammation}} ensues, and functional CD4+ T cell levels begin to decrease, eventually {{to a point}} where the CD4+ T cell population is too small to recognize the full range of antigens that could potentially be detected. The depletion of CD4 T cells and the development of chronic inflammation are signature processes in HIV pathogenesis that propel progression to acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS). CD4 T cell depleted to the cell count of less than 200cell/μL in blood during AIDS allows various pathogens to escape T cell recognition, thus allowing opportunistic infections that would normally elicit <b>a</b> <b>helper</b> T cell response to bypass the immune system. While these complete bypass situations only occur when the helper T cell response is absolutely necessary for infection clearance, most infections increase in severity and/or duration because the immune system's helper T cells provide less efficient immune response.|$|E
25|$|P. alternata colonies {{are small}} {{typically}} consisting {{of no more}} than 2-3 females. Unlike the annual colony cycles of temperate wasps like Polistes, nesting and initiation of a colony occurs throughout the year. Typically, a single foundress initiates the colony cycle by locating a suitable site and building a nest. The foundress will build cells within the nest and lay one egg in each. Once the eggs hatch, the foundress feeds the larvae. The time of brood development is currently unknown but likely averages between 44 to 53 days based on close relatives P. nigricans and P. mellyi respectively. Some nests contain 2 or more overlapping sibgroups (eggs laid around the same time), indicating that the average reproductive span of the dominant female may be short. After developing into adults, the offspring may either leave the nest to build their own or stay behind to become helpers. Unrelated females may also join the nest {{at any time during the}} colony cycle but current nest mates may resist the joining of foreign females. Although some colonies consist of more than one female (usually <b>a</b> <b>helper</b> or relative), the production of offspring is nearly always the responsibility of the dominant female.|$|E
500|$|The area {{maintained}} {{is large}} enough to support the group in poor years or to accommodate new members after a good breeding season. Groups range from two to nine members in size with an average of four birds, the largest for any fairywren studied to date. This is thought to be due to a very high annual survival and occupancy of suitable territory. Though reproduction rates are low, young birds still have few vacancies available for them to disperse into. Pairs are socially monogamous, with relationships ending for the most part when one partner dies. The survivor in this case selects a new partner, often <b>a</b> <b>helper</b> bird in the group. Though not directly studied, paired red-winged fairywrens are likely to be sexually promiscuous, with each partner mating with other individuals. Female helpers are much more common in this species than the other species intensively studied, the superb fairywren (M. cyaneus). Over half of the groups have two or more helpers, often female, which feed nestlings and reduce the workload of breeding females. Helpers have been shown to improve reproductive success in this species by increasing the number of young raised successfully per year from 1.3 to 2 birds. There is some evidence that groups with male helpers may enlarge the territory boundaries with a subsequent [...] "budding-off" [...] of a new territory by <b>a</b> <b>helper.</b>|$|E
