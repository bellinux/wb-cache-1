High arsenic concentrations were found in both groups with tendency of more efficient arsenic accumulation in benthic species, particularly in muscle (32. 4 to 362 µg·g− 1 of total arsenic).

40|$|Objective: To provide {{levels of}} total and speciated urinary arsenic in a {{representative}} sample of the US population. Methods: For the first time, total arsenic and seven inorganic and organic arsenic species were measured in the urine of participants (n 2557) for the 2003 – 2004 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES). Data were compiled as geometric means and selected percentiles of urinary arsenic concentrations (mg/l) and creatinine-corrected urinary arsenic (mg/g creatinine) for total arsenic, dimethylarsinic acid, <b>arsenobetaine,</b> and a sum of the inorganic related species. Results: Arsenic acid, arsenous acid, arsenocholine, and trimethylarsine oxide were detected in 7. 6 %, 4. 6 %, 1. 8 %, and 0. 3 % of the participants, respectively (the limits of detection of 0. 6 – 1. 2 mg/l). Monomethylarsonic acid was detected in 35 % of the overall population. For all participants agedZ 6 years, dimethylarsinic acid (geometric mean of 3. 71 mg/l) and <b>arsenobetaine</b> (geometric mean of 1. 55 mg/l) had the greatest contribution to the total urinary arsenic levels. A relatively greater percentage contribution from <b>arsenobetaine</b> is seen at higher total urinary arsenic levels and from dimethylarsinic acid at lower total urinary arsenic levels. For all participants agedZ 6 years, the 95 th percentiles for total urinary arsenic and the sum of inorganic-related arsenic (arsenic acid, arsenous acid, dimethylarsinic acid, and monomethylarsonic acid) were 65. 4 and 18. 9 mg/l, respectively.
