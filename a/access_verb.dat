40|$|Introduction. Impaired {{language}} comprehension {{is frequently}} observed in primary progressive aphasia (PPA). Word comprehension deficits {{are characteristic of}} the semantic variant (PPA-S) whereas sentence comprehension deficits are more prevalent in the agrammatic (PPA-G) and logopenic (PPA-L) variants (Amici et al., 2007; Gorno-Tempini et al., 2011; Thompson et al., 2013). Word and sentence comprehension deficits have {{also been shown to}} have distinct neural substrates in PPA (Mesulam, Thompson, Weintraub, & Rogalski, in press). However, {{little is known about the}} relationship between word and sentence comprehension processes in PPA, specifically how words are accessed, combined, and used to predict upcoming elements within a sentence. A previous study demonstrated that listeners with stroke-induced agrammatic aphasia rapidly <b>access</b> <b>verb</b> meanings and use them to semantically integrate verb-arguments; however, they show deficits in using verb meanings predictively (Mack, Ji, & Thompson, 2013). The present study tested whether listeners with PPA are able to <b>access</b> <b>verb</b> meanings and to use this information to integrate and predict verb-arguments. Methods. Fifteen adults with PPA (8 with PPA-G, 3 with PPA-L, and 4 with PPA-S) and ten age-matched controls participated in two eyetracking experiments. In both experiments, participants heard sentences with restrictive verbs that were semantically compatible with only one object in a four-picture visual array (e. g., eat when the array included a cake and three non-edible objects) and unrestrictive verbs (e. g., move) that were compatible with all four objects. The verb-based integration experiment tested access to verb meaning and its effects on integration of the direct object (e. g., Susan will eat/move the cake); the verb-based prediction experiment examined prediction of the direct object (e. g., Susan will eat/move the …). The dependent variable was the rate of fixations on the target picture (e. g., the cake) in the first 500 ms after the offset of the verb. Logistic regression was used to compare the rate of target fixations between PPA and controls and to test for differences between PPA subtypes. Results. In the verb-based integration experiment (Fig. 1 a), PPA listeners as well as controls showed rapid access to verb meaning, making more target fixations in the restrictive than unrestrictive conditions in the first 500 ms after verb offset. No significant differences were found between participant groups. In the verb-based prediction experiment (Fig. 1 b), control listeners exhibited a greater difference between the restrictive and unrestrictive conditions compared to PPA listeners. In both experiments, no significant differences were found between PPA subtypes. Conclusion. The results of this study suggest that access to verb meaning is relatively preserved in PPA and can facilitate integration of verb-arguments. However, prediction of verb-arguments is impaired. These findings are in line with stroke-induced agrammatic aphasia, in which prediction is markedly impaired (Mack et al., 2013). The similar pattern of results across PPA subtypes should be interpreted cautiously due to small sample sizes. However, these findings suggest that – despite well-established differences in word and sentence comprehension impairments – there may also be shared deficits across PPA subtypes that affect the ability to use lexical information predictively during sentence comprehension...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{explores the}} nature of {{thematic}} information made available when a <b>verb</b> is <b>accessed</b> during sentence comprehension. Following Shapiro, Zurif and Grimshaw (1987), a cross-modal lexical decision (interference) task was ernployed to examine whether either the number of argument structures {{or the number of}} participant (thematic) roles inherent in a verb cause an increase in processing load upon <b>access</b> of the <b>verb.</b> It was determined that there was no evidence for such an increased processing load covarying with the number of argument structures of the verb, at least for those verb types examined in this study. However, there was an increase in processing load as a direct function of the number of participant roles carried by the verb. It is concluded that the participant roles (thematic roles associated with the central meaning of the verb) are stored with the representation of a verb and are made immediately available upon <b>access</b> of the <b>verb</b> for further processing during comprehension. The semantic relations involved in verb-argument structures have come to play an increasingly critical role in our representation of language and our understanding of language processing. Characterizations of these thematic relationships are seen as central to concerns of language theories ranging from lexicalist case-role approaches (e. g., Fillmore, 1968) to almost purely syntactic approaches (e. g., Chomsky, 1981).

Two experiments based on free recall of single inflected forms are reported. The patterns of recall and error are taken as evidence for the grammatical and morphological information exploited in the <b>access</b> to the <b>verb</b> forms. The pattern of results provides support for the hypothesis that in the mental lexicon the information about conjugation and mood is an organizational criterion for the representation of verbal forms.

40|$|Although {{numerous}} studies find the premotor cortex {{and the primary}} motor cortex are involved in action language comprehension, so far {{the nature of these}} motor effects is still in controversy. Some researchers suggest that the motor effects reflect that the premotor cortex and the primary motor cortex make functional contributions to the semantic <b>access</b> of action <b>verbs,</b> while other authors argue that the motor effects are caused by comprehension. In the current study, we used Granger causality analysis to investigate the roles of the premotor cortex and the primary motor cortex in processing of manual-action verbs. Regions of interest were selected in the primary motor cortex (M 1) and the premotor cortex based on a hand motion task, and in the left posterior middle temporal gyrus (lexical semantic area) based on the reading task effect. We found that (1) the left posterior middle temporal gyrus had a causal influence on the left M 1; and (2) the left posterior middle temporal gyrus and the left premotor cortex had bidirectional causal relations. These results suggest that the premotor cortex and the primary motor cortex play different roles in manual verb comprehension. The premotor cortex may be involved in motor simulation that contributes to action language processing, while the primary motor cortex may be engaged in a processing stage influenced by the meaning <b>access</b> of manual-action <b>verbs.</b> Further investigation combining effective connectivity analysis and technique with high temporal resolution is necessary for better clarification of the roles of the premotor cortex and the primary motor cortex in action language comprehension. 7 page(s...|$|R
40|$|A cross-modal priming {{experiment}} {{was conducted to}} test the hypothesis that lexical <b>access</b> of <b>verbs</b> marked with a specific inflectional suffix would be facilitated by immediately prior exposure to semantically and contextually unrelated verbs with the same suffix. It was hypothesized that while listening to spoken "-ed " sentences, subjects would respond more quickly to target words in the "-ed " form than in the "-s " or bare root form. Subjects were 15 university students, all native speakers of English, who responded to 60 visually presented target words, all based on one-syllable verb roots, while listening to aurally presented sentences of two types, one with and one without "-ed " verb morphology to provide a past tense environment. The predicted priming did not occur. Instead, bare root forms showed an absolute advantage over inflected forms in this experimental paradigm. However, an unanticipated finding was that responses to inflected forms were affected by the kind of discourse that was being attended to auditorily {{at the time of the}} visual lexical decision. There was no such effect of discourse context on responses on uninflected verbs. Results lend some support to the view that inflection triggers discourse integration. Contains 37 references.

40|$|Much {{work has}} {{demonstrated}} that speakers of verb-final languages are able to construct rich syntactic representations in advance of verb information. This may reflect general architectural properties of the language processor, or it may only reflect a language-specific adaptation {{to the demands of}} verb-finality. The present study addresses this issue by examining whether speakers of a verb-medial language (English) wait to consult verb transitivity information before constructing filler-gap dependencies, where internal arguments are fronted and hence precede the verb. This configuration makes it possible to investigate whether the parser actively makes representational commitments on the gap position before verb transitivity information becomes available. A key prediction of the view that rich pre-verbal structure-building is a general architectural property is that speakers of verb-medial languages should predictively construct dependencies in advance of verb transitivity information, and therefore that disruption should be observed when the verb has intransitive subcategorization frames that are incompatible with the predicted structure. In three reading experiments (self-paced and eye-tracking) that manipulated verb transitivity, we found evidence for reading disruption when the verb was intransitive, although no such reading difficulty was observed when the critical verb was embedded inside a syntactic island structure, which blocks filler-gap dependency completion. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that in English, as in verb-final languages, information from preverbal NPs is sufficient to trigger active dependency completion without having <b>access</b> to <b>verb</b> transitivity information...|$|R
40|$|This study {{examined}} the relationship between verb retrieval and verb-argumentstructure properties in seven agrammatic aphasic patients using tasks requiring <b>access</b> to the <b>verb’s</b> lexicon for both comprehension- and productionlike processes. Results showed intact comprehension of both nouns and verbs and noun naming, but impaired naming of verbs. Subjects also demonstrated near-normal performance on a grammaticality judgment task involving verb-argument-structure violations but were impaired in categorizing verbs by type (based on number of obligatory arguments). In both naming and categorization conditions, a hierarchy of verb difficulty emerged. Subjects were more accurate in naming/categorizing one-place verbs than two-place verbs and more accurate in naming/categorizing two-place verbs than three-place verbs. The pattern of selective impairment in lexical access/retrieval supports the hypothesis that one dimension of normal lexical organization is by form class. The results also suggest that no necessary relationship exists between production difficulties and comprehension of nouns/verbs in agrammatism. Further, the performance pattern noted supports the claim that verb-argument-structure properties...|$|R
40|$|The vast {{expressive}} {{power of}} language {{is made possible}} by two principles: the arbitrary soundmeaning pairing underlying words, and the discrete combinatorial system underlying grammar. These principles implicate distinct cognitive mechanisms: associative memory and symbolmanipulating rules. The distinction {{may be seen in}} the difference between regular inflection (e. g., walk-walked), which is productive and open-ended and hence implicates a rule, and irregular inflection (e. g., come-came, which is idiosyncratic and closed and hence implicates individually memorized words. Nonetheless, two very different theories have attempted to collapse the distinction; generative phonology invokes minor rules to generate irregular as well as regular forms, and connectionism invokes a pattern associator memory to store and retrieve regular as well as irregular forms. I present evidence from three disciplines that supports the traditional word/rule distinction, though with an enriched conception of lexical memory with some of the properties of a pattern-associator. Rules, nonetheless, are distinct from patternassociation, because a rule concatenates a suffix to a symbol for verbs, so it does not require <b>access</b> to memorized <b>verbs</b> or their sound patterns, but applies as the "default, " wheneve...|$|R
40|$|Many {{experiments}} {{have shown that}} listeners actively build expectations about up-coming words, rather than simply waiting for information to accumulate. The online construction of a syntactic structure {{is one of the}} cues that listeners may use to construct strong expectations about the possible words they will be exposed to. For example, speakers of verb-final languages use pre-verbal arguments to predict on-line the kind of arguments that are likely to occur next (e. g. Kamide, 2008, for a review). Although in SVO languages information about a verb’s arguments typically follows the verb, some languages use preverbal object pronouns, potentially allowing listeners to build on-line expectations {{about the nature of the}} upcoming verb. For instance, if a preverbal direct object pronoun is heard, then the following verb has to be able to enter a transitive structure, thus excluding intransitive verbs. To test this, we used French, in which object pronouns have to appear pre-verbally, to investigate whether listeners use this cue to predict the occurrence of a transitive verb. In a word detection task, we measured the number of false alarms to sentences that contained a transitive verb whose first syllable was homophonous to the target monosyllabic verb (e. g. target dort /dɔʁ/ to sleep and false alarm verb dorlot /dɔʁlɔt/ to cuddle). The crucial comparison involved two sentence types, one without a pre-verbal object clitic, for which an intransitive verb was temporarily a plausible option (e. g. Il dorlotte / He cuddles) and the other with a preverbal object clitic, that made the appearance of an intransitive verb impossible (Il le dorlotte / He cuddles it). Results showed a lower rate of false alarms for sentences with a pre-verbal object pronoun (3 %) compared to locally ambiguous sentences (about 20 %). Participants rapidly incorporate information about a verb’s argument structure to constrain lexical <b>access</b> to <b>verbs</b> that match the expected subcategorization frame...|$|R
40|$|Verb {{processing}} {{is problematic}} in many aphasia subtypes, and verb argument structure effects {{have been observed}} on both verb lexical retrieval and morphosyntactic processing in different languages. For instance, there is evidence in the aphasia literature that aphasic speakers ﬁnd verbs with increasing numbers of arguments more difﬁcult to retrieve, and perform poorly compared to controls (Cruice, Pritchard and Dipper, 2014). Recent neuroimaging studies propose that the posterior perisilvian network {{is responsible for the}} processing and integration of arguments selected by the verb, while the left inferior frontal gyrus underlies the generation of their syntactic form (Thompson, Bonakpadour & Fix, 2010). In the context of aphasiology, this hypothesis would then predict that Broca’s, but not Wernicke’s aphasic individuals, have spared <b>access</b> to <b>verb</b> complex lexical entries while their syntactic structure implementation will be more difficult. Since verb argument structure is differentially implemented across languages (word-order, case morphology, verb agreement…), it is crucial to develop cross-language and cross-population studies of verb processing if we want to define the nature of "Verb Argument Structure Complexity" in aphasia. A psycholinguistic test was developed to tease apart lexical and inflectional verb processing in both production and comprehension in three languages (Basque, French and Spanish). It includes, for each language, 30 lexical verbs (10 intransitive, 10 transitive and 10 ditransitive), of which 15 (5 intransitive, 5 transitive and 5 ditransitive) have to be encoded and decoded in sentences with different agreement conditions (singular/plural subject; singular/plural direct object; singular/plural indirect object). The same list of verbs was used in 1. action naming, 2. sentence production and 3. sentence comprehension with the aim to determine whether argument structure complexity, defined as the number of arguments associated to a given verb, increases difficulties in lexical access or in morphosyntactic computation. The tool itself will be presented as well as preliminary data collected in French from a case study of agrammatism, and control adults (N= 10). I will argue that cross-language behavioral studies are useful to complement neuroimaging data for investigating the nature of argument structure complexity in agrammatic aphasia and other aphasia types...|$|R
40|$|Mild reading {{difficulties}} are a pervasive symptom in aphasia, but are little researched. Eye tracking research with neurologically healthy participants {{has demonstrated that}} reading is influenced {{by a number of}} information sources that are related to our experience with language. Two of these sources of influence, frequency and context, demonstrate that more probable words and structures are processed more quickly than those that are less probable. However, not much is known about probabilistic influences on the reading of people with aphasia at the sentence level. Two eye tracking experiments were conducted to establish whether or not frequency and context influence reading for people with aphasia {{in a way that is}} parallel to that of neurologically healthy participants. The first experiment examined the influence of word frequency and context on visual word recognition at the sentence level. The second experiment examined the influence of argument structure frequency on the reading of temporarily ambiguous sentences. Specifically, target sentences appeared after a context that cued a specific verb meaning and probabilistically associated argument structure. The target sentence was either consistent with or at odds with that context. The analysis of eye movements from both experiments revealed that people with aphasia have prolonged fixation durations and an increased proportion of regressions (backward fixations), indicative of their reading difficulties. Results from the first experiment demonstrated large effects of word frequency and context on both first pass and second pass eye movement measures by both groups. This suggests that frequency and context are related to both early and late processing stages of reading. However, differences were found between groups in a later processing stage where the aphasia group relied more on the context (top-down processing support) than the control group. The second experiment revealed that participants from both groups were sensitive to argument structure frequency when they read sentences that were temporarily ambiguous. Context cues facilitated the <b>access</b> of <b>verb</b> meaning and probabilistically associated argument structure, even though the individuals with aphasia showed delayed reading patterns. The context effect was found for both first pass and second pass eye movement measures, and was particularly strong for total fixation durations, which indicate re-reading behaviour. Overall, the outcome suggests the importance of considering multiple factors in sentence reading. Reading and sentence decoding by neurologically healthy individuals as well as individuals with aphasia are not only influenced by syntactic factors, but are also sensitive to factors relating to our language exposure. Results from the aphasia group are consistent with constraint-based theories of sentence comprehension and with slowed or reduced processing accounts...|$|R
40|$|Morpho-syntactic {{skills and}} verb {{argument}} structure were investigated longitudinally in narratives of 16 Dutch children with SLI at ages 6, 7 and 8. On some measures, like MLU and sentence complexity, {{no significant differences}} were found between the different ages. On other measures, like proportions of agreement errors and complex sentences a ceiling effect was found at age 7. With respect to verb argument structure, subject and object omissions in obligatory contexts were investigated. No significant differences between ages were found for subject omissions, but object omissions decreased significantly between ages 7 and 8. Possibly due to poor working memory skills, the children violate rules for reference and allowed subject-drop. Special attention was given to the overuse of auxiliary gaan (to go) combined with infinitives and overuse of lexical gaan (to go) as general all purpose (GAP) verb. Proportions of gaan+infinitive remained large at all ages. Explanations may be found either in very slow verb paradigm learning or in word finding difficulties. The insertion of auxiliary gaan offers the children extra time to <b>access</b> the lexical <b>verb.</b> The overuse of gaan+infinitive might also be regarded as ‘frozen forms’ used by the children to cope with problems in inflection and movement of lexical verbs. This interpretation lends support to the procedural deficit hypothesis of Ullman & Pierpont (2005) who claim that children with SLI learn ‘rules’ in declarative memory (e. g. for past tense, use ging-en +infinitive). Proportions of lexical gaan decreased from 6 to 7 years and increased again from 7 to 8 years. It was suggested that a certain (critical) mass of the verb lexicon triggers word finding difficulties...|$|R
40|$|A long-standing but {{implicit}} {{assumption is}} that words strongly associated with a presented cue are automatically activated in the memory through rapid spread of activation within brain semantic networks. The current study was aimed to provide direct evidence of such rapid access to words’ semantic representations and to investigate its neural sources using magnetoencephalography (MEG) and distributed source localization technique. Thirty-three neurotypical subjects underwent the MEG recording during verb generation task, which was to produce verbs related to the presented noun cues. Brain responses evoked by the noun cues were examined while manipulating the strength of association between the noun and the potential verb responses. The strong vs. weak noun-verb association led to a greater noun-related neural response at 250 – 400 ms after cue onset, and faster verb production. The cortical sources of the differential response were localized in left temporal pole, previously implicated in semantic access, and left ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (VLPFC), thought to subserve controlled semantic retrieval. The strength of the left VLPFC’s response to the nouns with strong verb associates was positively correlated to the speed of verbs production. Our findings empirically validate the theoretical expectation that {{in case of a}} strongly connected noun-verb pair, successful <b>access</b> to target <b>verb</b> representation may occur already at the stage of lexico-semantic analysis of the presented noun. Moreover, the MEG results suggest that contrary to the previous conclusion derived from fMRI studies left VLPFC supports selection of the target verb representations, even if they were retrieved from semantic memory rapidly and effortlessly. The discordance between MEG and fMRI findings in verb generation task may stem from different modes of neural activation captured by phase-locked activity in MEG and slow changes of blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) signal in fMRI...|$|R
40|$|Models of {{the mental}} {{representation}} of morphologically complex words traditionally {{fall into one of}} two categories, Single-Route or Dual-Route models. The former further distinguish between Full-Listing (e. g. Butterworth, 1983) and Decomposition (e. g. Taft & Forster, 1976), while the latter assume different systems governing the access of mono- vs. polymorphemic words (e. g. Pinker & Prince, 1994; Pinker & Ullman, 2002). One of the main arguments against decomposition and continuous online computations is the cognitive resources this process would require. Turning this reasoning around, taxing someone's working memory capacities should then uniquely affect the computation of bimorphemic verb forms. We tested this hypothesis on 48 Dutch native speakers with a lexical decision task, comparing reaction times for Dutch regular past tense forms to frequency-matched irregular past tense forms, both under low and under high cognitive load. We found that frequency influenced reactions to monomorphemic but not to bimorphemic forms (F(1, 47) = 4. 734, p =. 035), favoring a listing account for the former but a computational procedure for the latter forms. This interaction, however, was present only for a certain group of people (F(1, 23) = 6. 279, p =. 02), namely those whose reaction times were hardly affected by the load manipulation and who thus may be thought of as having larger working memory capacities. On the other hand, participants who showed a strong load effect had no interaction between number of morphemes and frequency (F(1, 23) =. 575, ns), indicating that they process monomorphemic and bimorphemic forms in a similar manner. It seems that cognitive capacities influence the storage of and <b>access</b> to polymorphemic <b>verb</b> forms. While people with greater working memory skills use these resources to compute morphologically complex inflections on-line, people with smaller cognitive capacities seem to rely on a list-like storage for bimorphemic forms as well...|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} addresses an unanswered {{question in}} Arabic psycholinguistics. Arabic words {{are characterized by}} their nonconcatenative structure, in which a consonantal root that encodes the main semantic content is interleaved with a derivational pattern (called "binyan", pl. "binyanim"), which is typically vocalic but may also contain consonantal elements and contributes grammatical information. The canonical example of the Semitic root and binyan system is the combination of root /ktb/ which denotes the broad semantic sense of "writing" with verbal binyan /CaCaC/ (with Cindicating a root consonant) to form [katab] "he wrote" and with nominal place binyan/maCCaC/ to form [maktab] "office". Although significant {{work has been done}} on the psycholinguistic reality of Arabic morphemes by exploring various phonological, morphological and semantic features across numerous experimental modalities in both the visual and auditory domains (Boudelaa and Marslen-Wilson, 2004, 2005, 2011), no study has investigated the roles of base/morpheme frequency and surface/word frequency and their implications for underlying morphological structure in the lexicon of Arabic as has been done for English, Dutch, and Finnish (Baayen et al., 1997; Alegre and Gordon, 1999; New et al., 2004; Taft, 1979, 2004). Competing models of word recognition propose various integrations of morphology. Whole-word models suggest that there are no separate representations for morphemes, and that the co-activation of related words can be attributed to similarity in form and meaning (Norris and McQueen, 2008; Tyler et al., 1988). Decomposition models posit that words are recognized by accessing the words' constituent morphemes (Meunierand Segui, 1999; Taft et al., 1986; Wurm, 2000). Hybrid models incorporate multiple pathways to recognition. Words are either recognized holistically or by their constituent morphemes depending on multiple factors (Balling and Baayen, 2008; Taftand Nguyen-Hoan, 2010; Lopez-Villasenor, 2012). Of most relevance to the current study {{is the role of the}} productivity of the words' derivational affixes: words with unproductive affixes are processed holistically whereas words with productive affixes are processed as a function of their morphemes. This dissertation presents results from four auditory lexical decision experiments performed with native Jordanian speakers in Amman, Jordan, and provides evidence that binyan productivity determines whether the frequency of the base morpheme affects the speed of recognition. By manipulating root and word frequency for three binyanim, one more productive and two less productive, I provide evidence that verbs in the productive binyan are fully decomposable during lexical <b>access</b> and <b>verbs</b> in less productive binyanim are recognized holistically. For a more productive binyan, I examine Binyan I of the form /CaCaC/, and two less productive binyanim are Binyan VIII of the form /iCtaCaC/and Binyan X of the form /staCCaC/. These results together support a hybrid model of lexical access in which some words are recognized via decomposition into the morphemes they are composed of, and others are recognized by their whole word form. These results are consistent with those of Balling and Baayen (2008); Taft and Nguyen-Hoan (2010); Bertramet al. (2000), among others, as derivational affix productivity is the deciding factor determining whether a word will be recognized holistically or decomposed during lexical access...|$|R
40|$|Previous {{research}} suggests that on-line <b>access</b> to lexically-stored <b>verb</b> argument structures is relatively preserved in some people with aphasia[9] (PWAs), despite their increased difficulty in producing verbs as compared to nouns[2]. Accessing lexically-stored argument structures facilitates prediction and integration of verbal arguments relative to lexically unspecified adjuncts[1, 8, 10]. The anticipatory processing of verbal arguments {{has also been shown}} to be affected by event-related plausibility constraints, based in world knowledge[4]. While access to world knowledge and argument structure is preserved in many PWAs, how and when these resources interact during verb-argument processing among PWA has not been investigated. The current study examined how argument status and event plausibility affect on-line processing of locative event participants via a modified visual-world task[6]. PWAs (n= 9) and age-matched neurotypical adults (ONs, n= 16) listened to a partial sentence and were instructed to click on the image that “best finished” the sentence. Stimuli were sentences ending with a locative phrase truncated at the preposition: “The boy is turning twelve, so his friends are bringing/ meeting him excitedly to/at …” The incomplete locative phrase was either an argument or an adjunct (location is an argument of “bring” but an adjunct of “meet”). Accompanying images depicted the agent and theme of the sentence, an unrelated distractor, and a location target, either plausible (a fair) or implausible (a bar). Proportions of gazes to the location target were analyzed in 100 ms bins during the 2 seconds following the offset of the pronoun (“him. ”) ONs showed clear early (100 - 200 ms, 300 - 700 ms) and late (1100 - 1800 ms, 1900 - 2000 ms) plausibility effects (circled in Fig. 1 a), as well as early (200 - 300 ms) and late (1300 - 1400 ms) effects of argument status on target gazes (see arrows, Fig. 1 a) and a late interaction effect of argument status and plausibility (1100 - 1200 ms, see asterisk, Fig. 1 a). Early effects of plausibility and argument status for ONs were truly anticipatory, appearing while the sentence was still on-going. Plausibility effects on target gaze were more limited in PWA, appearing at two points following pronoun offset (500 - 600 ms and 1000 - 1100 ms, circled in Fig. 1 b). Conversely, argument effects were more widespread for PWAs, although they emerged later (700 - 900 ms and 1000 - 1100 ms, see arrows, Fig. 1 b). PWAs also showed a much later interaction effect between plausibility and argument status (at 1800 ms, see asterisk, Fig. 1 b). These results suggest that older adults rely more on event-related plausibility than on argument status during the processing of locative event participants, and that these effects interact late in processing. The effect of argument status is more prevalent but delayed in PWAs compared to ONs, and the interaction of plausibility and argument status is also present but delayed. This pattern is compatible with findings suggesting that PWAs access verbs’ lexical representations during sentence comprehension[9] and that this access may affect linguistic performance[5], but that lexical access is delayed in PWAs when compared to age-matched controls[7, 11]. This slowed lexical access can lead to impairments in syntactic comprehension[3]. The current results indicate that similar effects may also be present in verb-argument prediction and the processing of semantic roles...|$|R
