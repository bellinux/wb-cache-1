A draft of us was sent round to that ship accordingly, and we found she had hauled off from the yard, and was lying between the forts. When I got on board, I ascertained that something like fifty of my old liners were in this very ship, some common motive inducing them to take service in the navy, all at the same time. As for myself, it happened just as I have related, though I always liked the navy, and was ever ready to join a ship of war, for a pleasant cruise.|$|E

I know, Skinner, you always said we ought to keep ourselves in good condition; but I mean more than that, I mean strict training--getting up early and going for a three or four mile run every morning, taking another run in the afternoon, cutting off pudding and all that sort of thing, and going in for it heart and soul.

40|$|We {{present a}} {{procedure}} for reproducibly fabricating ultrahigh transmission optical nanofibers (530 nm diameter and 84 mm stretch) with single-mode transmissions of 99. 95 ± 0. 02 %, which represents a loss from tapering of 2. 6 [*]×[*] 10 − 5 dB/mm when normalized {{to the entire}} stretch. When controllably launching the next family of higher-order modes on a fiber with 195 mm stretch, we achieve a transmission of 97. 8 ± 2. 8 %, which has a loss from tapering of 5. 0 [*]×[*] 10 − 4 dB/mm when normalized to the entire stretch. Our pulling and transfer procedures allow us to fabricate optical nanofibers that transmit more than 400 mW in high vacuum conditions. These results, published as parameters in our previous work, present an improvement of two orders of magnitude less loss for the fundamental mode {{and an increase in}} transmission of more than 300 % for higher-order modes, when following the protocols detailed in this paper. We extract from the transmission during the pull, the only reported spectrogram of a fundamental mode launch that does not include excitation to asymmetric modes; in stark contrast to <b>a</b> <b>pull</b> <b>in</b> which our cleaning protocol is not followed. These results depend critically on the pre-pull cleanliness and when properly following our pulling protocols are in excellent agreement with simulations...|$|E

40|$|In this article, we rigorously {{analyze the}} effects of the {{dispersion}} forces (Casimir and van der Waals forces) on a nano-optomechanical device based on a silicon waveguide and a silicon dioxide substrate, surrounded by air and driven by optical forces. The dispersion forces are calculated using a modified Lifshitz theory, in order {{to take into account the}} device thickness and material s dielectric permittivities, which are obtained from experimental optical data and validated by means of a rigorous 3 D FDTD simulation. We also take into account the mechanical nonlinearity of the waveguide, which is caused by its large deflection relative to its thickness, due to the nanoscale device dimensions. The nonlinear mechanical analytical model is also validated using a 3 D FEM simulation. Our results show that, under appropriate design conditions, it is possible to attain a no pull in critical point due only to the optical force; therefore, in principle, it would be possible to control the device total deflection just by controlling the optical power. However, the dispersion forces usually impose <b>a</b> <b>pull</b> <b>in</b> critical point to the device and establish a minimal initial gap between the waveguide and the substrate. Furthermore, we show that the geometric nonlinearity effect may be exploited in order to avoid or minimize the pull in and, therefore, the device collapse. Comment: 8 pages, 12 figure...|$|E
40|$|All of us {{have many}} times had the {{experience}} of setting a body in motion. If we analyze any of these experiences, we readily recall that in each case some force was required to start the object moving. In throwing a ball, moving a piece of furniture, or pulling a sled, the force needed to start the object moving is supplied by one 2 ̆ 7 s muscular effort as a push or <b>a</b> <b>pull.</b> <b>In</b> more complex cases, such as setting a car or an airplane in motion, the analysis, although more complicated, will also show that a force is required to start the body moving. There are many cases in which the force that acts on the body to produce the motion is not directly discernible. It was Newton who first showed that the acceleration of a freely falling body is produced by a force which acts between the earth and the body, called the force of gravitation. We shall encounter other such action-at-a-distance forces in electricity and magnetism, and in molecular and atomic physics. Once a body has been set in motion by the action of a force, it will not necessarily stop moving when the force is removed. A sled in motion along a level road will continue to move in a straight line along the road, although with diminishing speed. The reduction in speed is due to the force of friction between the runners of the sled and the ground. If there is clean snow on the ground, the force of friction will be very small; if ashes or sand have been dumped on the snow, the force of friction will be greater, and the sled will come to rest much sooner...|$|E
40|$|Cross-cultural psychologists {{aspire to}} {{scientific}} objectivity and cultural sensitivity. These two objectives are pursued simultaneously, yet they often exercise <b>a</b> <b>pull</b> <b>in</b> divergent directions. If the investigator 2 ̆ 7 s concepts, instruments, and procedures {{are designed to}} maximize cultural appropriateness, {{they may not be}} usable within other cultures. If, however, comparability is the principal consideration, sensitivity to the unique culture that is being investigated may be compromised. The assessment of disturbed behavior across cultures is not exempt from these two pressures. In this chapter, four objectives are pursued. First an attempt is made to take stock of the present state of multicultural assessment. Second, the choices that are open to the contemporary investigator and practitioner of cultural assessment of psychological disturbance are articulated. Third, some preliminary suggestions are proposed for dealing with the challenge of simultaneously achieving cross-cultural comparability and cultural sensitivity. Fourth, proceeding from this proposal, generalizations are formulated about the culturally distinctive components of the experience and expression of psychological disorder and about their integration in the course of assessment. All of this information is brought to bear upon the practical issues of assessing distressed and/or disabled individuals in culturally diverse environments. Before this body of accumulated relevant findings is applied in multicultural assessment, a number of complications must be identified and, if possible, resolved. Because the activities of culturally oriented assessment have potent consequences for better or worse, those engaged in this enterprise should be warned against dangers and pitfalls, such as equating different and unfamiliar behavior with the bizarre and the dysfunctional. It should also be emphatically pointed out that the comparison of complex and meaningful behaviors across cultures does not imply the superiority or inferiority of any group at either pole on any psychological dimension. The history of the last 30 years of cumulative, organized research in cross-cultural psychology (Berry, Poortinga, Segall, 2 ̆ 6 Dasen, 1992; Brislin, 1983; Kagitcibasi 2 ̆ 6 Berry, 1989; Segall, 1986) decisively demonstrates that socially relevant behavior can be comp! 1 red realistically and sensitively, without the investigators either extolling or devaluing any of its culturally characteristic variants. Thus, the unfortunate and long history of comparisons of intelligence across racial, ethnic, and cultural lines has, so far, not been repeated by the contributors to the modern enterprise of cross-cultural psychology. Moreover, cross-cultural psychologists have by and large been successful in avoiding the pitfall of equating cultural differences with deficits (cf. Cole 2 ̆ 6 Bruner, 1972). Time may now be ripe for applying the results of the culturally oriented assessment effort to the solution of practical problems in community, educational psychiatric, and other settings. To this end, however, certain specifications and distinctions must be introduced...|$|E
