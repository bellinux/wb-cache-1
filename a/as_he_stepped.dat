25|$|Another {{incident}} occurred in 1958 {{in a game}} against the Washington Senators. Williams struck out, and <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>stepped</b> from the batter's box swung his bat violently in anger. The bat slipped from his hands, was launched into the stands and struck a 60-year-old woman— one {{who turned out to be}} the housekeeper of the Red Sox general manager Joe Cronin. While the incident was an accident and Williams apologized to the woman personally, to all appearances it seemed at the time that Williams had hurled the bat in a fit of temper.|$|E
25|$|On {{the night}} of February 25, 1855, Baker entered the Stanwix Hall saloon with Jim Turner and Paudeen McLaughlin to confront Poole having {{threatened}} Morrissey with a gun during an argument only hours before. Walking up to Poole, Baker spat {{in his face and}} then pulled a Colt revolver but accidentally shot himself in the arm <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>stepped</b> back to draw the weapon. Dropping to the floor, he did manage to fire a second shot hitting Poole in the leg and similarly incapacitating him. Both men eventually got up from the floor, however Baker managed to get to Poole first and pistol whipped him back to the ground. Baker then shot Poole twice, once in the stomach and the second in his chest, and left the saloon.|$|E

25|$|On December 7, 1837, in Boston's Faneuil Hall, Phillips' {{leadership}} and oratory established his preeminence within the abolitionist movement. Bostonians gathered at Faneuil Hall to discuss Elijah P. Lovejoy's murder by a mob outside his abolitionist printing press in Alton, Illinois on November 7. Lovejoy died defending {{himself and his}} press from pro-slavery rioters who set fire to a warehouse storing his press and shot Lovejoy <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>stepped</b> outside to tip a ladder {{being used by the}} mob. His death engendered a national controversy between abolitionists and anti-abolitionists. At Faneuil Hall, Massachusetts attorney general James T. Austin defended the anti-abolitionist mob, comparing their actions to 1776 patriots who fought against the British. Deeply disgusted, Phillips spontaneously rebutted, praising Lovejoy’s actions as a defense of liberty. Inspired by Phillips’ eloquence and conviction, Garrison entered a partnership with him that came to define the beginning of the 1840s abolitionist movement.|$|E
25|$|The {{battle plan}} for the assault on Santa Cruz called for a {{combination}} of naval bombardments and an amphibious landing. The initial attempt was called off after adverse currents hampered the assault and {{the element of surprise}} was lost. Nelson immediately ordered another assault but this was beaten back. He prepared for a third attempt, to take place during the night. Although he personally led one of the battalions, the operation ended in failure: the Spanish were better prepared than had been expected and had secured strong defensive positions. Several of the boats failed to land at the correct positions in the confusion, while those that did were swept by gunfire and grapeshot. Nelson's boat reached its intended landing point but <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>stepped</b> ashore he was hit in the right arm by a musketball, which fractured his humerus bone in multiple places. Weatherhead was in Nelson's boat that night and managed to get ashore under a hail of shot, but was hit in the stomach. One of the Spaniards, Bernardo Cólogan, found Weatherhead on the beach near death. Cólogan used his shirt to bandage Weatherhead and arranged for his returned to the Theseus. However, Weatherhead's condition did not improve and he died four days later on 29 July 1797.|$|E

500|$|Cutts ordered Brigadier-General Archibald Rowe's brigade to attack. The English {{infantry}} {{rose from}} the edge of the Nebel, and silently marched towards Blenheim, a distance of some [...] John Ferguson's Scottish brigade supported Rowe's left, and moved in perfect order towards the barricades between the village and the river, defended by Hautefeuille's dragoons. As the range closed to within , the French fired a deadly volley. Rowe had ordered that there should be no firing from his men until he struck his sword upon the palisades, but <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>stepped</b> forward to give the signal, he fell mortally wounded. The survivors of the leading companies closed up the gaps in their torn ranks and rushed forward. Small parties penetrated the defences, but repeated French volleys forced the English back towards the Nebel, sustaining heavy casualties. As the attack faltered, eight squadrons of elite Gens d'Armes, commanded by the veteran Swiss officer, Beat-Jacques von Zurlauben, fell upon the English troops, cutting at the exposed flank of Rowe's own regiment. However, Wilkes' Hessian brigade, lying nearby in the marshy grass at the water's edge, stood firm and repulsed the Gens d'Armes with steady fire, enabling the English and Hessians to re-order and launch another attack.|$|E
500|$|Kolb {{started his}} first game for the Cardinals on September 11, 2011 against the Carolina Panthers {{in the first week}} of the 2011 NFL season. Kolb was 18 of 27 for 309 yards, two touchdowns, and no picks in the 28-21 win over the Panthers. He also posted a 130.0 passer rating in the game, third best in the NFL in Week 1. However, over the rest of the season, his play {{markedly}} deteriorated as the Cardinals lost several close games. Furthermore, he was hampered by various injuries. A foot injury (turf-toe) that he incurred in a game against the Baltimore Ravens sidelined him for several games. His backup quarterback, John Skelton, performed ably <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>stepped</b> in and won games against St. Louis (once at home, once away) and against Philadelphia. Upon return from his turf-toe injury, Kevin led the Cardinals to a comeback win against the Dallas Cowboys in overtime. The game was memorable for the blunder committed by Cowboys head coach Jason Garrett, who called a time-out to [...] "ice" [...] his own kicker on a potential game-winning field goal. The ensuing kick after the time-out was not good, and in overtime, Kevin threw a touch-pass to LaRod Stephens-Howling who ran it into the end-zone for the winning score. But in the very next game against the San Francisco 49ers, Kolb was inadvertently kicked in the back of the head early in the first series. He left the game with concussion-related symptoms, and did not return that season.|$|E

Most of the right arm was amputated and within half an hour Nelson had returned to issuing orders to his captains. Years later he would excuse himself to Commodore John Thomas Duckworth for not writing longer letters due to not being naturally left-handed.
