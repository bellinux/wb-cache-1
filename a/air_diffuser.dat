When used in a pond {{that does not have}} rocks on the bottom, a bottom drain allows the heavy solids to be carried to the mechanical filter.

40|$|Bases on {{the concept}} of task/ambient ventilation, fresh air can be {{decoupled}} from re-circulated air so as to improving ventilation effectiveness in breathing zone. Ceiling mounted high velocity circular jet diffusers, which are regarded as remote personalized ventilation air terminal devices (PV ATDs) without affecting room aesthetic effects, can be utilized to supply fresh air without causing draft rating because tropically acclimatized occupants prefer slightly higher air movement. Under-floor <b>air</b> <b>diffusers</b> are used to supply re-circulated air. Corresponding mixing ventilation system by only utilizing under-floor <b>air</b> <b>diffusers</b> are compared with this task/ambient ventilation system. Numerical simulation using a validated computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model for circular jet diffusers is conducted to investigate the difference between task/ambient ventilation systems and mixing ventilation systems. Location weighted personal exposure effectiveness is utilized as an evaluation index for evaluating indoor air quality (IAQ). Air velocity and temperature are utilized as evaluation indices for evaluating thermal comfort level...|$|R

50|$|The {{aquarium}} industry uses lime wood as an <b>air</b> <b>diffuser</b> inside protein skimmers.

Root rot and other problems associated with poor water aeration were principal reasons for the development of aeroponics.|$|R
50|$|An <b>air</b> <b>diffuser</b> or {{membrane}} diffuser is an {{aeration device}} typically {{in the shape}} of a disc, tube or plate, which is used to transfer air and with that oxygen into sewage or industrial wastewater.

40|$|Computational fluid dynamic (CFD) tools {{have been}} used {{extensively}} in the prediction of airflow in indoor environment. However, {{it is important to}} understand that the accuracy of such simulation is affected by a number of factors depending on micro- or macro-level of modelling. It is in the interest of this paper to study, in micro-level modelling, the impact of various description of <b>air</b> supply <b>diffuser</b> modelling on the accuracy of the airflow prediction. <b>Air</b> supply <b>diffuser</b> can be modelled in a number of different ways. Each technique can result in different airflow pattern around the diffuser and in the macro-environment. This paper investigates five different types of <b>air</b> supply <b>diffuser</b> modelling techniques. It compares the throw profile of each of these diffuser models against the measured profile in rooms of three different sizes. A diffuser modelling technique that uses the RNG k– turbulence model has been successfully developed. It is simple and yet without compromising on the accuracy of the predicted results...|$|R

50|$|An {{air mover}} systems serve {{the same purpose}} as blower systems at a lower cost. However, this type of system can only be used when {{there is little or}} no back {{pressure}} because they generate lower pressure and airflow. Air mover functionality is based on the Venturi effect. A small amount of high velocity air connected to the side of the casting passes out through a nozzle, creating venturi action. This effect causes a large volume of low velocity air to flow through the venturi and out of the <b>air</b> <b>diffuser.</b> The ratio of air supplied depends on the design of the air mover’s physical structure.|$|E
5000|$|The I-A {{air intake}} {{consisted}} of two peripheral slots {{which led to a}} double-sided, centrifugal compressor. A series of vanes guided the air into the impeller eyes. After radial compression, the air was diffused and turned 90 degrees rearwards, before entering a set of ten reverse-flow combustion chambers (i.e. cans). A relatively short shaft connected the compression system to the single stage axial turbine. After expansion through the turbine, the combustion products exhausted the engine through the simple conical propelling nozzle, via the jet-pipe. For the turbine section, GE used a [...] metal developed for their turbochargers, Hastelloy B. Problems were uncovered with overheating bearing, and solved by fitting the turbine with larger cooling blades and changing the <b>air</b> <b>diffuser,</b> as well as switching to a ram air cooling air inlet.|$|E

50|$|The {{background}} sound in buildings is normally {{determined by the}} air handling system. ASHRAE has guidelines on just how loud they systems are recommended to be. The sound from well designed systems is distributed through <b>air</b> <b>diffusers</b> and of low level. It is not capable of being easily adjusted to accommodate privacy needs. The sound spectrum is weighted toward low frequencies so is not useful for improving privacy, especially speech privacy. Sound masking, being electronic, can adjust both level and spectrum at almost any place at any time to meet privacy requirements.

40|$|The {{techniques}} {{available for}} the simulation of the complex geometries common in <b>air</b> <b>diffusers</b> are {{quite different from the}} ones optimized for a complete room simulation. For this reason the full room simulation usually neglects the complexities of the diffusers introducing ad hoc boundary con- ditions often requiring extensive experimental setups for a correct definition. An alternative approach could be the use of numerical analysis for the diffuser characterization. In this work a detailed analysis of a perforated plate type diffuser is performed, particular effort has been devoted to the perforated plate modeling comparing different possible approaches. The simulation has been carried out using the commercial code FLUENT 6. ...|$|R
50|$|A typical {{displacement}} ventilation system, {{such as one}} in {{an office}} space, supplies conditioned cold air from an air handling unit (AHU) through a low induction <b>air</b> <b>diffuser.</b> Diffuser types vary by applications. Diffusers can be located against a wall ("wall-mounted"), {{at the corner of}} a room ("corner-mounted"), or above the floor but not against a wall ("free-standing"). The cool air accelerates because of thebuoyancy force, spreads in a thin layer over the floor,reaching a relatively high velocity before rising due to heat exchange with heat sources (e.g., occupants, computers, lights). Absorbing the heat from heat sources, the cold air becomes warmer and less dense. The density difference between cold air and warm air creates upward convective flows known as thermal plumes. Instead of working as a stand-alone system in interior space, displacement ventilation system can also be coupled with other cooling and heating sources, such as radiant chilled ceilings or baseboard heating.|$|E
5000|$|The K1 and K3 series [...] "compact" [...] {{cylinder}} vacuum {{was launched}} in 2002, designed to offer domestic homes with a smaller version of the C series.

Unlike the C series, the K series has only 3 swivel castors. The K is designed to be space efficient and smaller than the C series. Initially fitted with an 1800 watt motor to compete in the market with rivals and featured a new 500gram lighter tube and hose system earned design awards for this model. Also equipped with a longer domestic market hose and 6 metres of cable length, the K series remains popular.|$|E
5000|$|An {{even more}} extreme version called the Huayra BC model debuted at the Geneva Motor Show in March 2016. The Huayra BC {{is named after}} the late Benny Caiola, a friend of Horacio Pagani, and the first Pagani customer. The Huayra BC has an {{improved}} version of the standard Huayra's 6.0 liter V12, twin turbocharged AMG engine, producing [...] as well as 1100 Nm of torque. The dry weight is reduced 132 kg to just 1,218 kg, thanks to {{a new type of}} carbon fiber that Pagani claims is 50% lighter and 20% stronger than regular carbon fiber, giving it a power-to-weight ratio of [...] kg per horsepower. Pagani have also fitted the Huayra BC with a lighter titanium exhaust system, new aluminum alloy wheels, and a stripped out interior. The tires are Pirelli P Zero Corsas that feature 12 different rubber compounds, and the suspension and wishbones are made of aeronautical grade aluminum, known as Avional. The Huayra BC also has a new front bumper with a splitter and winglets, deeper side skirts, and an <b>air</b> <b>diffuser</b> that stretches the entire width of the rear bumper, and a massive rear wing. All the components are made of carbon fiber, and are add-ons. The Huayra BC also has changes made to {{all but one of the}} body panels to maximize downforce and minimize drag. The Huayra BC uses a next-generation 7-speed manual gearbox, and has an electro-hydraulic actuation. Pagani has stuck with a single-clutch gearbox because it weighs 40% less than double-clutch gearboxes.|$|E
