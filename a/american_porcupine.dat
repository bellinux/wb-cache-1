5|$|Polytolypa hystricis {{is known}} {{only from the}} dung of the North <b>American</b> <b>porcupine,</b> Erethizon dorsatum. Porcupine dens {{accumulate}} thick layers of nutrient-rich dung, hair and urine that are degraded by a succession of fungi. These fungi are disseminated by arthropods (such as insects) or by the porcupine themselves.|$|E
5|$|Polytolypa is a {{monotypic}} genus of fungus {{containing the}} single species Polytolypa hystricis. First {{classified in the}} Onygenaceae family, as of 2008 it {{is considered to be}} in the Ajellomycetaceae, although there is still uncertainty as to its phylogenetic relationships with other similar genera. This species is only known from a single specimen derived in the laboratory from a specimen of dung of the North <b>American</b> <b>porcupine,</b> Erethizon dorsatum, collected in Ontario, Canada. Polytolypa hystricis contains bioactive compounds that have antifungal activity.|$|E
25|$|The Aspen Parkland is {{agricultural}} land. The {{most prominent}} wildlife species {{which may be}} found are coyote (Canis latrans), hare, striped skunk (Mephitis mephitis), North <b>American</b> <b>porcupine</b> (Erethizon dorsatum), Richardson's ground squirrel (Spermophilus richardsonii), snowshoe hare, cottontail (Sylvilagus floridanus), northern pocket gopher (Thomomys talpoides), Franklin's ground squirrel (Spermophilus franklinii) and red fox. The Aspen Parkland is the environment of choice for the white-tailed deer. The Moist Mixed Grassland ecoregion is characterized by white-tailed deer, pronghorn (Antilocapra americana), coyote, rabbit, American badger (Taxidea taxus), red bat (Lasiurus borealis) and ground squirrel such as black-tailed prairie dog (Cynomys ludovicianus). Animal populations of the Mixed Grassland enumerate pronghorn, white-tailed and mule deer, long-eared myotis (Myotis evotis), small-footed myotis (Myotis subulatus), jack rabbit, coyote, Richardson's ground squirrel. The only Canadian site of black-tailed prairie dog is in the Mixed Grassland prairie ecoregion. The raised elevation of the Cypress Upland results in white spruce and aspen forests and an ecoregion more resembling the boreal forested areas than the prairielands. Moose, pronghorn, mule and white-tailed deer, elk, rabbit, and ground squirrel coyote are common in this ecoregion.|$|E

25|$|Natural {{sources of}} {{mortality}} are largely reported in anecdotes. On rare occasions, golden eagles {{have been killed}} by competing predators or by hunting mammalian carnivores, including the aforementioned wolverine, snow leopard, cougar, brown bear and white-tailed eagle attacks. Most competitive attacks resulting in death probably occur at the talons of other golden eagles. Nestlings and fledglings {{are more likely to be}} killed by another predator than free-flying juveniles and adults. It has been suspected that golden eagle nests may be predated more frequently by other predators (especially birds, which are often the only other large animals that can access a golden eagle nest without the assistance of man-made climbing equipment) in areas where golden eagles are regularly disturbed at the nest by humans. Jeff Watson believed that common raven occasionally eats golden eagle eggs but only in situations where the parent eagles have abandoned their nesting attempt. However, there are no confirmed accounts of predation by other bird species on golden eagle nests. Occasionally, golden eagles may be killed by their prey in self-defense. There is an account of a golden eagle dying from the quills of a North <b>American</b> <b>porcupine</b> (Erethizon dorsatum) it had attempted to hunt. On the Isle of Rùm in Scotland, there are few cases of red deer trampling golden eagles to death, probably the result of a hind having intercepted a bird that was trying to kill a fawn. Although usually well out-matched by the predator, occasionally other large birds can put up a formidable fight against a golden eagle. An attempted capture of a great blue heron by a golden eagle resulted in the death of both birds from wounds sustained in the ensuing fight. There is at least one case in Scotland of a golden eagle dying after being “oiled” by a northern fulmar, a bird whose primary defense against predators is to disgorge an oily secretion which may inhibit the predator's ability to fly. Of natural sources of death, starvation is probably under-reported. 11 of 16 dead juvenile eagles which had hatched in Denali National Park had died of starvation. Of 36 deaths of golden eagles in Idaho, 55% were possibly attributable to natural causes, specifically 8 (26%) from unknown trauma, 3 (10%) from disease and 6 (19%) from unknown causes. Of 266 golden eagle deaths in Spain, only 6% were from unknown causes that could not directly attributed to human activities. Avian cholera caused by bacteria (Pasteurella multocida) infects eagles that eat waterfowl that have died from the disease. The protozoan Trichomonas sp. caused the deaths of 4 fledglings in a study of wild golden eagles in Idaho. Several further diseases that contribute to golden eagle deaths have been examined in Japan. A captive eagle died from two malignant tumors – one in the liver and one in the kidney.|$|E

In the mountain zone of the state the most observed mammals are: Mexican fox squirrel (Sciurus nayaritensis), antelope jackrabbit (Lepus alleni), raccoon (Procyon lotor), hooded skunk (Mephitis macroura), wild boar (Sus scrofa), collared peccary (Pecari tajacu), white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus), mule deer Odocoileus hemionus, American bison Bison bison, cougar (Puma concolor), eastern cottontail Sylvilagus floridanus, North <b>American</b> <b>porcupine</b> Erethizon dorsatum, bobcat Lynx rufus, Mexican wolf Canis lupus baileyi, and coyote Canis latrans. American black bear Ursus americanus is also found but in very small numbers. The Mexican wolf, once abundant, has been extirpated. The main cause of degradation has been grazing. Although there are many reptilian species in the mountains the most observed species include: Northern Mexican pine snake, Pituophis deppei jani, Texas horned lizard (Phrynosoma cornutum), rock rattlesnake (Crotalus lepidus), black-tailed rattlesnake [...] (Crotalus molossus), and plateau tiger salamander Ambystoma velasci, one of possibly many amphibians {{to be found in the}} mountains.|$|E

50|$|The {{riparian}} {{communities of}} the Great Basin desert cut across all elevations and life zones. In the Great Basin desert surface water is rapidly lost by evaporation or infiltration. However, areas around streams where plant life is abundant constitute a riparian area. Water-loving plants like willow, narrowleaf cottonwood, choke cherry, wild rose, and aspen are found along these wet areas. The willow has a spreading root network that allows it to reach all around for water and it also helps streams by slowing erosion. These plants provide wood for beavers. In this community, silver buffaloberry often provides shelter for North <b>American</b> <b>porcupines.</b>|$|R

40|$|Plant-herbivore {{interactions}} play {{a significant}} role in the structure and functioning of ecosystems. Co-evolutionary theory suggests that plant defenses evolved due to herbivores and herbivore pressure can shape the genetic composition of their food resources. We used interactions between North <b>American</b> <b>porcupines</b> (Erethizon dorsatum) and trembling aspens (Populus tremuloides) as a system to investigate this theory's important assumption that herbivores select food sources based on genetically controlled traits. We confirmed that porcupines exhibit intra-specific food selection and that this is linked to the genetic composition of the aspens. We also demonstrated that variation in phenolic glycosides and condensed tannins are strong components of this selection, thereby creating an important link between genetics, plant chemistry, and mammalian herbivory. We investigated potential impacts of porcupine herbivory on aspen using fluctuating asymmetry, however we did not detect any stress on heavily eaten trees, thereby questioning the validity of this tool for this study system...|$|R
