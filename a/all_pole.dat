50|$|The {{transfer}} function {{allows one to}} judge {{whether or not a}} system is bounded-input, bounded-output (BIBO) stable. To be specific, the BIBO stability criterion requires that the ROC of the system includes the unit circle. For example, for a causal system, <b>all</b> <b>poles</b> of the {{transfer function}} have to have an absolute value smaller than one. In other words, <b>all</b> <b>poles</b> must be located within a unit circle in the -plane.|$|R

50|$|The {{classification}} of pole weapons can be difficult, and European weapon classifications in particular can be confusing. This can {{be due to}} a number of factors, including uncertainty in original descriptions, changes in weapons or nomenclature through time, mistranslation of terms, and the well-meaning inventiveness of later experts. As well, <b>all</b> <b>pole</b> arms developed from as few as 3 early tools (axe, scythe/wide bladed knife, and the reaping hook) and one weapon, the spear. For example, the word 'halberd' is also used to translate the Chinese ji and also a range of medieval Scandinavian weapons as described in sagas, such as the atgeir.|$|E
50|$|<b>All</b> <b>pole</b> weapons {{begin with}} the staff, known as a dang or lathi. The dang's ideal length is either equal to the height or the armspan of its wielder. Gatka {{typically}} uses a bamboo staff, which may be steel-tipped and encased in leather. This type of dang is held with both hands on one end and used for swinging techniques. The light weight of the bamboo allows for great speed {{and a variety of}} twirling maneuvres. This style of fighting was often used by peasants and commoners for whom the staff was a domestic tool and a convenient implement of self-defense. For warriors who used the dang as a training tool for edged weapons, a different method was employed. In this style, the dang is held diagonally with the hands far apart. The butt end of the weapon is held with one hand, while the other hand is further down the middle or just above the other end. This grip lends itself to thrusting attacks aimed at the vital points (marma), done by pushing the weapon forward with the back hand through the front hand, though it also incorporates barta, techniques in which both ends are used to attack. This thrust-based method can be easily adapted to edged weapons such as spears, tridents and battle-axes. In the case of the axe, thrusts hit with the weapon's head, which can also be used defensively to stop an opponent's attack or to break their fingers. The barta method can also be adapted to edged polearms, most of which have a weighted or spiked back end. When wielding a heavy polearm in close-quarters, the fighter may hold a katara on one hand.Pole weapons include the following.|$|E

40|$|In {{this work}} we {{address the problem}} of <b>all</b> <b>pole</b> {{spectral}} envelope estimation for speech signals. The currently widely used <b>all</b> <b>pole</b> spectral envelope model suffers from well-known systematic errors and more severely from model order mismatch.

The band-limited envelope that is used to derive the <b>all</b> <b>pole</b> envelope model reduces the problem of the unknown <b>all</b> <b>pole</b> model order. For the experimental investigation we propose a new perceptually motivated residual spectral peak flatness measure. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method significantly increases the spectral flatness for the perceptually especially important low order harmonics of voiced utterances. 1...|$|E
