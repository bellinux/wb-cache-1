The aim of this bench study was to determine whether different interfaces and ventilator settings may influence patient-ventilator interaction in pediatric models of normal and mixed obstructive and restrictive respiratory conditions.

The test lung was set to simulate one pediatric patient with a healthy respiratory system and another with a mixed obstructive and restricted respiratory condition, at different breathing frequencies (f) (30, 40, and 50 breaths/min).

40|$|BACKGROUND: During {{invasive}} mechanical ventilation, secretions {{accumulate in}} the subglottic space; consequently, {{there is a}} risk of aspiration of these secretions into the airway during cuff deflation and extubation. To minimize this risk, 2 extubation methods are used. The first consists of introducing a suction catheter into the endotracheal tube (ETT) and the trachea. After initiating suctioning, the cuff is deflated and the ETT is removed together with the suction catheter. The second technique involves <b>applying</b> <b>positive</b> <b>pressure</b> to the ETT using a resuscitation bag.

METHODS: An ETT connected to a ventilator was placed in a model trachea. Colored water was instilled in the space above the cuff. To measure the leak volume, a collection chamber was attached to the distal end of the model. Nine procedures were defined, based on the delivery of different positive pressure levels with or without endotracheal suctioning during extubation. The volume of leakage, in milliliters, was the unit of analysis.

30|$|Aspiration of {{respiratory}} secretions is a frequently needed procedure in intubated subjects, which is performed whenever respiratory secretions accumulate. The conventional method consists of inserting a sterile catheter through the endotracheal tube or tracheostomy cannula {{connected to a}} negative pressure port into the trachea until resistance is met [1]. Its effect is therefore limited to the trachea and carina and efficacy is reduced {{in the presence of}} dense secretions. Frequent complications include traumatic lesions to the mucosa, poor tolerance [2], and pain [3], as well as, mostly transient, respiratory and hemodynamic adverse events [4, 5]. Airway clearance devices providing mechanically assisted cough or mechanical insufflation-exsufflation (MIE), in contrast to manually assisted cough, are being used to facilitate aspiration of tracheobronchial secretions. They simulate the physiological cough mechanism by <b>applying</b> <b>positive</b> <b>pressure</b> to the airway followed by an abrupt decrease to a negative pressure [6]. Experience with non-invasive secretion clearance with MIE has accumulated in non-critically ill patients with neuromuscular diseases (NMD), both chronic ventilator-dependent [7 – 9] and spontaneously breathing subjects [8, 10], hospitalized or at home [11]. The specific indication for the use of a mechanical airway clearance device is the lack of effective cough in spite {{of respiratory}} physiotherapy, with the aim to reduce the risk for atelectasis and respiratory tract infection. The usual interface is a face mask, although the intended use of the devices also includes patients with endotracheal intubation [6, 12].|$|E
40|$|The patch-clamp {{technique}} allows currents to {{be recorded}} through single ion channels in patches of cell membrane in the tips of glass pipettes. When recording, voltage is typically applied across the membrane patch to drive ions through open channels and to probe the voltage-sensitivity of channel activity. In this study, we used video microscopy and single-channel recording to show that prolonged depolarization of a membrane patch in borosilicate pipettes results in delayed slow displacement of the membrane into the pipette and that this displacement {{is associated with the}} activation of mechanosensitive (MS) channels in the same patch. The membrane displacement, ≈ 1 μm with each prolonged depolarization, occurs after variable delays ranging from tens of milliseconds to many seconds and is correlated in time with activation of MS channels. Increasing the voltage step shortens both the delay to membrane displacement and the delay to activation. Preventing depolarization-induced membrane displacement by <b>applying</b> <b>positive</b> <b>pressure</b> to the shank of the pipette or by coating the tips of the borosilicate pipettes with soft glass prevents the depolarization-induced activation of MS channels. The correlation between depolarization-induced membrane displacement and activation of MS channels indicates that the membrane displacement is associated with sufficient membrane tension to activate MS channels. Because membrane tension can modulate the activity of various ligand and voltage-activated ion channels as well as some transporters, an apparent voltage dependence of a channel or transporter in a membrane patch in a borosilicate pipette may result from voltage-induced tension rather than from direct modulation by voltage...|$|E

40|$|In severe asphyxia, {{expansion}} of the newborn lung must precede ventilation by intermittent <b>positive</b> <b>pressure.</b> Inadequate expansion may lead to hypoxia and excessive expansion to rupture of the lung. The only {{way in which a}} predetermined pressure can be achieved, and not exceeded in the alveoli, is by applying that pressure at the mouth and waiting until all flow ceases. Applying pressure in this way and increasing it according to a "staircase " pattern, with appropriate steps at suitable intervals, should ensure that the maximum pressure produced in the alveoli is no greater than the minimum necessary for resuscitation in each individual infant. On the basis of published work, ranges of optimum values for the increments and time intervals are suggested. Clinical judgement is still necessary to select from within these ranges, but this "pressure staircase " method should provide a systematic approach to the problem. A suitable apparatus is described. Resuscitation of the apnoeic neonate requires ventilation of the lungs primarily.

Materials and Methodology: In this retrospective study, patients were selected according to inclusion criteria: both the diagnostic polysomnography recording showing an OSA with an apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) greater than 25 (n/h) and the related CPAP therapy control recordings were available, presence of mandible movement and mask pressure signals in the recordings, and tolerance to the <b>applied</b> <b>positive</b> <b>pressure.</b> Statistical analysis on four parameters, namely the apneahypopnea index (AHI), the arousal index (ArI), {{the average of the}} mandible lowering during sleep (aLOW), and the average amplitude of the oscillations of the mandible movement signal (aAMPL), was performed on two sets of recordings: OSA and CPAP therapy. Results: Thirty-four patients satisfied the inclusion criteria, thus both OSA and CPAP groups included thirty-four recordings each.

No significant PaO 2 difference was observed {{between the two groups}} at 1 h after satisfactory i-gel insertion (215 ± 38 vs. 222 ± 54; P = 0. 502). Conclusions The use of an i-gel during PEEP application at 5 cmH 2 O did not increase the incidence of a significant air leak, and a PEEP of 5 cmH 2 O failed to improve arterial oxygenation during controlled ventilation in healthy adult patients...|$|R
40|$|AbstractObjectives. This {{study was}} {{designed}} to determine whether arterial baroreflex control of blood pressure is altered in patients with congestive heart failure. Background. Arterial baroreceptor reflexes normally contribute to cardiovascular homeostasis by preserving blood pressure during changes in volume and posture. Methods. Arterial baroreceptor reflex function was studied in 18 patients with congestive heart failure and 18 age-matched healthy subjects. The arterial baroreceptor-blood pressure reflex was assessed by measuring the blood pressure response to perturbations in carotid sinus pressure. Carotid baroreceptors were stimulated by applying negative pressure to a custom neck chamber (− 10, − 20 and − 30 mm Hg) and were unloaded by <b>applying</b> neck <b>positive</b> <b>pressure</b> (+ 10, + 20 and + 30 mm Hg). Results. Peak carotid baroreceptor-blood pressure reflex sensitivity was lower in patients with heart failure than in normal subjects (0. 19 ± 0. 02 vs. 0. 30 ± 0. 03 mm Hg/mm Hg, p < 0. 05). During neck <b>positive</b> <b>pressure,</b> blood pressure increased less in the heart failure group than in the normal group. During neck suction, however, the decrease in blood pressure was similar in the two groups. Conclusions. Patients with heart failure are less able than normal subjects to increase blood pressure during arterial baroreceptor unloading, but they can reduce blood pressure appropriately during baroreceptor stimulation. These observations suggest that the resting blood pressure position on the arterial baroreceptor stimulus-response curve, the operational point, is closer to the baroreceptor threshold in patients with heart failure than in normal subjects. As a result, reduced inhibitory signals from arterial baroreceptors most likely contribute to a heightened state of sympathetic activity and vasoconstriction in patients with congestive heart failure...|$|R
