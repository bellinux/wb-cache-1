There was no significant correlation with Revised Trauma Score, symptoms, or associated thoracic injuries, although patients with aortic rupture did have a higher incidence of extrathoracic injuries (P less than 0. 001). A blinded review of admitting chest radiographs for five major findings (widened mediastinum, aortic arch abnormalities, aortopulmonary window opacification, left <b>apical</b> <b>capping,</b> and right <b>apical</b> <b>capping)</b> revealed a significant difference between patients with and without aortic injury (0. 98 +/- 1. 24 findings in the negative aortogram group and 3. 00 +/- 0. 71 findings in the positive aortogram group) (P less than 0. 001).

The aorta may be completely torn away from the heart, but patients with such injuries rarely survive very long after the injury; thus it is much more common for hospital staff to treat patients with partially torn aortas.

30|$|Chronic {{hypersensitivity}} pneumonitis and <b>apical</b> <b>caps</b> are differential diagnoses {{to consider when}} there is predominant involvement of the upper lobes, and they can have radiological and histological features that overlap with those of PPFE. The latter is particularly challenging, especially when associated with tuberculosis scars, which, in our country, have a medium incidence. <b>Apical</b> <b>caps</b> also tend to occur in older cigarette smokers and are localised in the upper lobes, usually with no extension to other lobes. In these patients centrilobular emphysema can be seen and they are typically asymptomatic with nonprogressive disease [4, 5]. On the other hand, PPFE has a more diffuse subpleural distribution and can also affect basal portions and other lobes [4, 5]. In the case of {{hypersensitivity pneumonitis}} like Piciucchi et al. described, lesions have a bronchiolar location {{and do not have}} a subpleural and pleural predominance like in PPFE [4]. In our study one patient had a history of previous tuberculosis and two other environmental exposures, making the diagnosis more challenging. One of them even had a misdiagnosis of chronic hypersensitivity pneumonitis. Therefore, PPFE must be considered in the differential diagnosis of these entities to alert pathologists to perform elastic fibre stains, making the diagnosis easier.|$|R

From 30 minutes to 3 hours, lesions were limited to nonciliated bronchiolar epithelial (Clara) cells, which lost <b>apical</b> <b>caps</b> and cytoplasmic granules and had dilated smooth endoplasmic reticulum (SER). At 12 hours, necrotic Clara cells were exfoliated; degeneration and necrosis were evident, in bronchiolar ciliated cells. Rare epithelial cells with hyperplastic SER appeared on the denuded basal lamina at 24 hours. Inflammatory cells, epithelia, fibroblastlike cells, collagen, and debris occluded many bronchiolar lumens from 3 to 6 days. Reorganization resulted in a simple columnar bronchiolar epithelium with relatively normal ciliated cells and fewer fibroblastlike cells. However, mature Clara cells were rare at 27 days, and collagenous bands still divided bronchiolar lumens. Thus, 3 MI toxicosis is a persistent model of equine bronchiolitis with many morphologic features of the spontaneous disease...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background The phylogenetic {{status of}} the aplacophoran mollusk taxon Solenogastres (Neomeniomorpha) is {{controversially}} discussed. Some authors propose the clade to represent the most basal branch within Mollusca, while others claim aplacophoran mollusks (Solenogastres and Caudofoveata) to be derived. Larval characters are central in these discussions, specifically the larval test (calymma, <b>apical</b> <b>cap),</b> the ontogeny of the epidermal scleritome, and the proposed absence of larval protonephridia. To date, developmental data are available for five solenogaster species, but most reports are incomplete and need confirmation. Results Wirenia argentea deposit small batches of uncleaved embryos that are tightly enclosed by a smooth and transparent egg hull. Cleavage is spiral and unequal. The ciliated larvae hatch about 45 hours after deposition and swim actively in the water column. Within 48 - 60 hours after hatching they become mushroom-shaped with a pronounced <b>apical</b> <b>cap</b> partly enclosing a posterior trunk. The cells covering the <b>apical</b> <b>cap</b> are large and cleavage arrested. On the <b>apical</b> <b>cap</b> there is a prominent prototrochal band of compound cilia and an apical ciliary tuft and the trunk bears a terminal ciliary band (telotroch). Obscured by the <b>apical</b> <b>cap,</b> a ciliary band originates in the stomodaeal pore and surrounds the trunk. As development is proceeding, the trunk elongates and becomes covered by cuticle {{with the exception of}} a ventral ciliary band, the future foot. The larvae have a pair of protonephridia.

Conclusions Solenogastres develop via a trochophore-like lecitotrophic larva with a preoral <b>apical</b> <b>cap</b> that at least partly represents an enlarged prototrochal area. Homology of this larval type (pericalymma larva) to test cell larvae of other spiralian clades is doubtful.

40|$|Apicomplexans {{employ a}} {{peripheral}} membrane system called the inner membrane complex (IMC) for critical {{processes such as}} host cell invasion and daughter cell formation. We have identified a family of proteins that define novel subcompartments of the Toxoplasma gondii IMC. These IMC Sub-compartment Proteins, ISP 1, 2 and 3, are conserved throughout the Apicomplexa, but {{do not appear to}} be present outside the phylum. ISP 1 localizes to the <b>apical</b> <b>cap</b> portion of the IMC, while ISP 2 localizes to a central IMC region and ISP 3 localizes to a central plus basal region of the complex. Targeting of all three ISPs is dependent upon N-terminal residues predicted for coordinated myristoylation and palmitoylation. Surprisingly, we show that disruption of ISP 1 results in a dramatic relocalization of ISP 2 and ISP 3 to the <b>apical</b> <b>cap.</b> Although the N-terminal region of ISP 1 is necessary and sufficient for <b>apical</b> <b>cap</b> targeting, exclusion of other family members requires the remaining C-terminal region of the protein. This gate-keeping function of ISP 1 reveals an unprecedented mechanism of interactive and hierarchical targeting of proteins to establish these unique subcompartments in the Toxoplasma IMC.

A photometric method of measuring enzyme activity visualized as a lead sulfide deposit on agar electrophoretic plates is described.

In nucleate fragments these enzymes appear to be correlated in activity with {{the rate of growth}} in length of the organism and the appearance of the <b>apical</b> <b>cap.</b> In enucleate fragments there is no increase in total protein after the tenth post-surgical day, but an <b>apical</b> <b>cap</b> may still be formed.

40|$|Treatment of {{confluent}} monolayers {{of human}} umbilical vein endothelial cells with sublethal concentrations of hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2) produces reversible cell retraction that opens gaps between adjacent cells. Despite the retraction, adjacent cells remain in contact through {{a network of}} dendrite-like processes. Retraction depends on cellular metabolism but not new protein synthesis or protein kinase C. Shape changes induced by H 2 O 2 are accompanied by partial redistribution of actin filaments from the cell periphery in resting endothelial cells to a tangled network of centrally located filaments in H 2 O 2 -treated endothelial cells. This change in actin organization {{is associated with a}} loss of the normal distribution pattern of surface protein expression. Specifically, beta 1 and beta 3 integrins partly escape from focal adhesion plaques and migrate to the lateral and apical surface of the cell; PECAM- 1 redistributes from the lateral borders to the basal surface; and ICAM- 1 and ICAM- 2 spread from <b>apical</b> <b>caps</b> to the basal surface and to the dendrite-like processes. The likely consequence of endothelial retraction accompanied by abnormal membrane protein distribution is a loss of normal endothelial cell functions.

40|$|The {{most deadly}} {{of the human}} malaria parasites, Plasmodium falciparum, has {{different}} stages specialized for invasion of hepatocytes, erythrocytes, and the mosquito gut wall. In each case, host cell invasion is powered by an actin-myosin motor complex that is linked to an inner membrane complex (IMC) via a membrane anchor called the glideosome-associated protein 50 (PfGAP 50). We generated P. falciparum transfectants expressing green fluorescent protein (GFP) chimeras of PfGAP 50 (PfGAP 50 -GFP). Using immunoprecipitation and fluorescence photobleaching, we show that C-terminally tagged PfGAP 50 -GFP can form a complex with endogenous copies of the linker protein PfGAP 45 and the myosin A tail domain-interacting protein (MTIP). Full-length PfGAP 50 -GFP {{is located in the}} endoplasmic reticulum in early-stage parasites and then redistributes to <b>apical</b> <b>caps</b> during the formation of daughter merozoites. In the final stage of schizogony, the PfGAP 50 -GFP profile extends further around the merozoite surface. Three-dimensional (3 D) structured illumination microscopy reveals the early-stage IMC as a doubly punctured flat ellipsoid that separates to form claw-shaped apposed structures. A GFP fusion of PfGAP 50 lacking the C-terminal membrane anchor is misdirected to the parasitophorous vacuole. Replacement of the acid phosphatase homology domain of PfGAP 50 with GFP appears to allow correct trafficking of the chimera but confers a growth disadvantage...|$|R
40|$|Epulopiscium fishelsoni, gut {{symbiont}} of {{the brown}} surgeonfish (Acanthurus nigrofuscus) in the Red Sea, attains a larger size than any other eubacterium, varies 10 - to 20 -fold in length (and > 2, 000 -fold in volume), and undergoes a complex daily life cycle. In early morning, nucleoids contain highly condensed DNA in elongate, chromosome-like structures which are physically separated from the general cytoplasm. Cell division involves production of two (rarely three) nucleoids within a cell, deposition of cell walls around expanded nucleoids, and emergence of daughter cells from the parent cell. Fluorescence measurements of DNA, RNA, and other cell components indicate the following. DNA quantity is proportional to cell volume over cell lengths of ∼ 30 μm to > 500 μm. For cells of a given size, nucleoids of cells with two nucleoids (binucleoid) contain approximately equal amounts of DNA. And each nucleoid of a binucleoid cell contains one-half the DNA of the single nucleoid in a uninucleoid cell of the same size. The life cycle involves approximately equal subdivision of DNA among daughter cells, formation of <b>apical</b> <b>caps</b> of condensed DNA from previously decondensed and diffusely distributed DNA, and “pinching” of DNA near {{the middle of the}} cell in the absence of new wall formation.

40|$|SummaryBackgroundHighly {{elongated}} eukaryotic cells (e. g., neuronal axons, fungal hyphae, and pollen tubes) {{are generated}} through continuous apically restricted growth (tip growth), which universally requires tip-localized Rho GTPases. We used the oscillating pollen tube {{as a model}} system to determine the function and regulation of Rho GTPases in tip growth. Our previous work showed that the spatiotemporal dynamics of the <b>apical</b> <b>cap</b> of the activated Rho-like GTPase from Plant 1 (ROP 1) are critical for tip growth in pollen tubes. However, the underlying mechanism for the generation and maintenance of this dynamic <b>apical</b> <b>cap</b> is poorly understood. ResultsA screen for mutations that enhance ROP 1 -overexpression-induced depolarization of pollen-tube growth identified REN 1 (ROP 1 enhancer 1) in Arabidopsis, whose null mutations turn elongated pollen tubes into bulbous cells. REN 1 encodes a novel Rho GTPase-activating protein (RhoGAP) required for restricting the ROP 1 activity to the pollen-tube tip. REN 1 was localized to exocytic vesicles accumulated in the pollen-tube apex, {{as well as to}} the apical plasma membrane at the site of ROP 1 activation. The apical localization of REN 1 and its function in controlling growth polarity was compromised by disruption of ROP 1 -dependent F-actin and vesicular trafficking, which indicates that REN 1 targeting and function is regulated by ROP 1 downstream signaling. ConclusionsOur findings suggest that the REN 1 RhoGAP controls a negative-feedback-based global inhibition of ROP 1. This function provides a critical self-organizing mechanism, by which ROP signaling is spatially limited to the growth site and temporally oscillates during continuous tip growth. Similar spatiotemporal control of Rho GTPase signaling may also play an important role in cell-polarity control in other systems, including tip growth in fungi and cell movement in animals...|$|E

A total of 113 patients with CTD-related ILD were enrolled and assessed for radiologic PPFE-like lesion, which was defined as bilateral, upper lobe, and subpleural dense consolidations with or without pleural thickening on chest high-resolution computed tomography. The clinical, radiologic, and pathologic characteristics were evaluated. Radiologic PPFE-like lesion was found in 21 patients (19 %) and were relatively frequent in those with systemic sclerosis (6 / 14 : 43 %) and primary Sjögren's syndrome (4 / 14 : 29 %). Patients with PPFE-like lesion were significantly older, had lower body mass index, higher ratio of residual volume to total lung capacity, and higher complication rate of pneumothorax and/or pneumomediastinum than those without. Twelve of the 21 patients were diagnosed radiologically as usual interstitial pneumonia (UIP) or possible UIP pattern. Two of three patients who underwent surgical lung biopsy of the upper lobes showed UIP on histopathology. Another patient was confirmed to have upper lobe PPFE on autopsy. During the clinical course, progression of the radiologic PPFE-like lesions was observed in 13 of 21 patients. Six patients died (mortality rate: 29 %) and their PPFE-like lesions were commonly progressive.

The property of medial dimensionality is 0. 0 for the sphere, 1. 0 for the cylinder, and 2. 0 for the slab, with non-integer dimensionality also possible. Endness results at the cap of a cylinder or {{the edge of a}} slab. The values of these medial properties at just a few locations provide an intuitive and robust model for complex shape.

40|$|International audienceThe glideosome of apicomplexan parasites is an actin- and myosin-based machine {{located at}} the pellicle, between the plasma {{membrane}} (PM) and inner membrane complex (IMC), that powers parasite motility, migration, and host cell invasion and egress. It is composed of myosin A, its light chain MLC 1, and two gliding-associated proteins, GAP 50 and GAP 45. We identify GAP 40, a polytopic protein of the IMC, as an additional glideosome component and show that GAP 45 is anchored to the PM and IMC via its N- and C-terminal extremities, respectively. While the C-terminal region of GAP 45 recruits MLC 1 -MyoA to the IMC, the N-terminal acylation and coiled-coil domain preserve pellicle integrity during invasion. GAP 45 is essential for gliding, invasion, and egress. The orthologous Plasmodium falciparum GAP 45 can fulfill this dual function, as shown by transgenera complementation, whereas the coccidian GAP 45 homolog (designated here as) GAP 70 specifically recruits the glideosome to the <b>apical</b> <b>cap</b> of the parasite...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Epimorphic {{regeneration}} is {{the process}} by which complete regeneration of a complex structure such as a limb occurs through production of a proliferating blastema. This type of regeneration is rare among vertebrates but does occur in the African clawed frog Xenopus laevis, traditionally a model organism for the study of early development. Xenopus tadpoles can regenerate their tails, limb buds and the lens of the eye, although the ability of the latter two organs to regenerate diminishes with advancing developmental stage. Using a heat shock inducible transgene that remains silent unless activated, we have established a stable line of transgenic Xenopus (strain N 1) in which the BMP inhibitor Noggin can be over-expressed at any time during development. Activation of this transgene blocks regeneration of the tail and limb of Xenopus tadpoles. Results In the current study, we have taken advantage of the N 1 transgenic line to directly compare morphology and gene expression in same stage regenerating vs. BMP signalling deficient non-regenerating hindlimb buds. The wound epithelium of N 1 transgenic hindlimb buds, which forms over the cut surface of the limb bud after amputation, does not transition normally into the distal thickened <b>apical</b> epithelial <b>cap.</b> Instead, a basement membrane and dermis form, indicative of mature skin. Furthermore, the underlying mesenchyme remains rounded and does not expand to form a cone shaped blastema, a normal feature of successful regeneration. Using Affymetrix Gene Chip analysis, we have identified genes linked to regenerative success downstream of BMP signalling, including the BMP inhibitor Gremlin and the stress protein Hsp 60 (no blastema in zebrafish). Gene Ontology analysis showed that genes involved in embryonic development and growth are significantly over-represented in regenerating early hindlimb buds and that successful regeneration in the Xenopus hindlimb correlates with the induction of stress response pathways. Conclusion N 1 transgenic hindlimbs, which do not regenerate, do not form an <b>apical</b> epithelial <b>cap</b> or cone shaped blastema following amputation. Comparison of gene expression in stage matched N 1 vs. wild type hindlimb buds has revealed several new targets for regeneration research. </p...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{cordon-bleu}} (Cobl) gene {{is widely}} conserved in vertebrates, with developmentally regulated axial and epithelial expression in mouse and chick embryos. In vitro, Cobl can bind monomeric actin and nucleate formation of unbranched actin filaments, while in cultured cells it can modulate the actin cytoskeleton. However, {{an essential role}} for Cobl in vivo {{has yet to be}} determined. We have used zebrafish as a model to assess the requirements for Cobl in embryogenesis. We find that cobl shows enriched expression in ciliated epithelial tissues during zebrafish organogenesis. Cobl protein is enriched in the apical domain of ciliated cells, in close proximity to the <b>apical</b> actin <b>cap.</b> Reduction of Cobl by antisense morpholinos reveals an essential role in development of motile cilia in organs such as Kupffer's vesicle and the pronephros. In Kupffer's vesicle, the reduction in Cobl coincides with a reduction in the amount of apical F-actin. Thus, Cobl represents a molecular activity that couples developmental patterning signals with local intracellular cytoskeletal dynamics to support morphogenesis of motile cilia...|$|R
40|$|AbstractUrodele {{amphibians}} can regenerate amputated limbs. It {{has been}} considered that differentiated dermal tissues generate multipotent and undifferentiated cells called blastema cells during limb regeneration. In early phases of limb regeneration, blastema cells are induced by nerves and the <b>apical</b> epithelial <b>cap</b> (AEC). We had previously investigated the role of neurotrophic factors in blastema or blastema-like formation consisting of Prrx- 1 positive cells. A new system suitable for investigating early phases of limb regeneration, called the accessory limb model (ALM), was recently developed. In this study, we performed a comparative transcriptome analysis between a blastema and wound using ALM. Matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) and fibroblast growth factor (FGF) signaling components were observed to be predominantly expressed in ALM blastema cells. Furthermore, we found that MMP activity induced a blastema marker gene, Prrx- 1, in vitro, and FGF signaling pathways worked in coordination to maintain Prrx- 1 expression and ALM blastema formation. Furthermore, we demonstrated that these two activities were sufficient to induce an ALM blastema {{in the absence of}} a nerve in vivo...|$|R
