5|$|Econometric {{analysis}} of DSGE models suggested that real factors sometimes affect the economy. A paper by Frank Smets and Rafael Woulters (2007) stated that monetary policy explained only <b>a</b> <b>small</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> fluctuations in economic output. In new synthesis models, shocks can affect both demand and supply. The new synthesis implies that monetary policy {{can have a}} stabilizing effect on the economy, contrary to new classical theory.|$|E
5|$|Effective {{with the}} 100th Congress in 1987, {{adjustments}} {{were made by}} the legislature to the boundaries. <b>A</b> <b>small</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Montgomery County territory was detached, as were parts of Fayette County in Washington Court House in Union Township and the townships of Jasper and Marion. Part of Brown County was added, Jackson and Eagle Townships. These were the boundaries for the rest of McEwen's service in Congress.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to the parody of King Leopold II, Méliès's scenario for the film features another topical element: the scene with the tar wagon {{is based on the}} experiments of Ernest Guglielminetti, who spread tar over <b>a</b> <b>small</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> gravel road to Monaco. This experiment, widely reported by the press, successfully eliminated the dust clouds kicked up by cars on gravel and sand roads.|$|E

5|$|Selenium occurs {{naturally}} {{in a number}} of inorganic forms, including selenide, selenate, and selenite, but these minerals are rare. The common mineral selenite is not a selenium mineral, and contains no selenite ion, but is rather a type of gypsum (calcium sulfate hydrate) named like selenium for the moon well before the discovery of selenium. Selenium is most commonly found as an impurity, replacing <b>a</b> <b>small</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> sulfur in sulfide ores of many metals.|$|E
5|$|The {{stadium is}} divided into five all-seater stands, the JCT600 Stand, the Kop, the Midland Road Stand, the North West Corner and the TL Dallas Stand. All five stands are covered except for <b>a</b> <b>small</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> main stand, and all but the Midland Road Stand being two-tiered. Most of the stands are {{cantilever}} structures, {{and because of the}} ground's location on the hillside, the Midland Road Stand overhangs the road.|$|E
5|$|A {{few months}} later, {{at a party}} meeting, {{it was decided that}} {{administrative}} actions against the writers who openly expressed support of reformation would be taken. Since only <b>a</b> <b>small</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> union held these beliefs, the remaining members were relied upon to discipline their colleagues. Control over Literární noviny and several other publishing houses was transferred to the Ministry of Culture, and even members of the party who later became major reformers — including Dubček — endorsed these moves.|$|E

5|$|Computer models {{suggest that}} {{collisions}} of cometary debris during the formation period play {{a far greater}} role than was previously thought. According to these models, the number of collisions early in the Solar System's history {{was so great that}} most comets were destroyed before they reached the Oort cloud. Therefore, the current cumulative mass of the Oort cloud is far less than was once suspected. The estimated mass of the cloud is only <b>a</b> <b>small</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 50–100 Earth masses of ejected material.|$|E
5|$|During {{his watch}} one night while the crew were camped on the ice, <b>a</b> <b>small</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ice floe broke away {{and he was}} only rescued due to the quick {{intervention}} of {{the men of the}} next watch who threw him a line allowing him to jump back to safety. Shackleton reported that McNish calmly mentioned his narrow escape the next day after further cracks appeared in the ice. Mrs. Chippy, the cat McNish had brought on board, had to be shot after the loss of the Endurance, as it was obvious he would not survive the harsh conditions. McNish apparently never forgave Shackleton for giving the order.|$|E
5|$|Each troop {{is divided}} into patrols of eight or so Scouts led by a patrol leader elected from within the patrol. Patrol {{meetings}} are generally held during the weekly troop meeting. The patrol's independence from the troop varies among troops and between activities. Patrols' autonomy becomes more visible at campouts, where each patrol may set up its own camping and cooking area. Divisions between patrols may disappear during an event which only <b>a</b> <b>small</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> troop attends. Patrols may hold meetings and even excursions separately {{from the rest of}} the troop.|$|E

Eccles was incorporated as a municipal borough in 1892, part of which was in Barton poor law union, an inter-parish unit established to provide social security, and in 1933 this was expanded to include most of Barton Moss civil parish, and part of Worsley Urban District. <b>A</b> <b>small</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> borough was transferred in 1961 to the County Borough of Salford.

5|$|In May 1995, several Texas sports teams, {{including}} the Houston Rockets, proposed {{legislation that would}} dedicate state tax revenue to build new arenas. Although the bill was failed in the Texas House of Representatives, Rockets owner Leslie Alexander announced {{he would continue to}} study the possibility of constructing a new arena in downtown Houston, saying the 20-year-old Summit arena was too outdated to be profitable. Although the Summit's management said they could renovate the building for <b>a</b> <b>small</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cost of a new arena, the Rockets began talks with the city of Houston on a possible location for an arena, They also negotiated with Houston Aeros and Summit owner, Chuck Watson, to release them from their contract with the Summit, which ran until 2003.|$|E
5|$|Lowe speculated in his 1927 paper that, in {{the absence}} of {{mammalian}} predators on the island, the brown skua would be the Inaccessible Island rail's only predator. A study of the diet of brown skuas on Inaccessible Island confirmed this, but found that although skuas do eat adults of this species, the rail and other landbirds formed only <b>a</b> <b>small</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> diet of that seabird, especially compared to their abundance on the island. They noted that the landbirds alarm-called when brown skuas were seen. After hearing another rail make an alarm call, adult Inaccessible Island rails become alert, while chicks fall silent. Adults are rarely preyed upon, but the mortality of chicks is high and predation by Tristan thrushes is a major cause.|$|E

Landing only <b>a</b> <b>small</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> spacecraft on the Moon and returning an even smaller part to lunar orbit minimized the total mass to be launched from the Earth.|$|E

5|$|The International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV) {{developed}} the current classification system and wrote guidelines {{that put a}} greater weight on certain virus properties to maintain family uniformity. A unified taxonomy (a universal system for classifying viruses) has been established.

However, at present only <b>a</b> <b>small</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> total diversity of viruses has been studied, with analyses of samples from humans finding that about 20% of the virus sequences recovered have not been seen before, and samples from the environment, such as from seawater and ocean sediments, finding that the large majority of sequences are completely novel.|$|E
5|$|The Lower Earley development, {{built in}} 1977, {{was one of}} the largest private housing {{developments}} in Europe. It extended the urban area of Reading as far as the M4 motorway, which acts as the southern boundary of the town. Further housing developments have increased the number of modern houses and hypermarkets in the outskirts of Reading. A major town-centre shopping centre, The Oracle, opened in 1999, is named after the 17th century Oracle workhouse, which once occupied <b>a</b> <b>small</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> site.

5|$|The RMNDH {{was only}} <b>a</b> <b>small</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{armed forces of}} the NDH, largely due to {{restrictions}} imposed by Italy. To avoid these restrictions, the Germans raised the Croatian Naval Legion which fought as part of the German Navy in the Black Sea campaign between 1941 and 1944. After the Italian capitulation in September 1943, the Germans transferred several captured Italian vessels to the RMNDH, although all of the significant ones had been lost by December 1944 when the remaining personnel were assigned to duties ashore to circumvent their defection to the Yugoslav Partisans. The RMNDH was disbanded in May 1945 with the collapse and defeat of the NDH.|$|E
