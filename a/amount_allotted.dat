50|$|In 1627, Philip set a {{competition}} for the best painters of Spain with the subject to be the expulsion of the Moors. Velázquez won. His picture was destroyed in a fire at the palace in 1734. Recorded descriptions of it say that it depicted Philip III pointing with his baton to a crowd {{of men and women}} being led away by soldiers, while the female personification of Spain sits in calm repose. Velázquez was appointed gentleman usher as reward. Later he also received a daily allowance of 12 réis, the same <b>amount</b> <b>allotted</b> to the court barbers, and 90 ducats a year for dress. Five years after he painted it in 1629, as an extra payment, he received 100 ducats for the picture of Bacchus (The Triumph of Bacchus). The spirit and aim of this work are better understood from its alternate Spanish name, Los Borrachos (The Drunks) or Los Bebedores (the drinkers), who are paying mock homage to a half-naked ivy-crowned young man seated on a wine barrel. The painting is firm and solid, and the light and shade are more deftly handled than in former works. Altogether, this production may be taken as the most advanced example of the first style of Velázquez.|$|E

40|$|The {{challenges}} {{that used to}} come up {{as a result of}} project failure have to do with improper planning. This is looking into future what can occur based on present event. In financing equipment or machinery, the capital in hand is a critical factor that determines equipment procurement strategies. There is need for an optimum model to control the available budget to be put in place in order to optimally allot the available budget to the machines, spare parts and miscellaneous costs under the redundant of accessory cost. This study identified the financial strategic decisions for machines, spare parts and miscellaneous costs, developed mathematical models for the identified strategic decisions, test and evaluate the performance of the developed models. In this study, three strategic decisions were considered (i. e., machines, spare parts and miscellaneous costs) and the optimum model to control the budget for machines, spare parts and miscellaneous costs are dealt with under the redundant accessory cost. This is because an existing manufacturing company or industry has high inventory of accessories which always aid the performance of machine in the industry. Therefore, it is necessary to optimally allot the available budget on the machine(s) to be procured, spare part to be stocked and miscellaneous cost. The <b>amount</b> <b>allotted</b> to machines, spare parts and miscellaneous while budgeting for year 2015 are in this ratio: Machines, ($ 5, 263. 83); Spare parts, ($ 27, 723. 09); Miscellaneous, ($ 4, 366. 03), this based on available small budget of...|$|E
40|$|In a {{developing}} company or industry {{where there is}} availability of machines to keep the industry running effectively, a need always arise to consider the accessories and the spare parts which will enhance the production planning and also affects the economic growth of the company positively. An optimum model is developed to control the limited available budget that will be optimally allotted to accessories, spare parts and miscellaneous costs. This study considered the strategic decisions for budgeting, developed mathematical models for accessories, spare parts and miscellaneous, with considering the machines cost since it is available for the year under consideration. The models were tested and their performance evaluations carried out. A decision maker/project manager optimally allotted the limited resources to the considered strategic decisions to know exactly the amount that {{will be required to}} keep the machines functioning efficiently and effectively so that revenue can be generated. In allotting the limited resources for procurement, this study considered three major strategic decisions: accessories, spare parts and miscellaneous costs. Model for each strategic decision was developed. This study made it known that the highest value in any of these strategic decisions will definitely have the highest inventory in company’s stock for production. Information from the past procurement made by OLAM Cocoa Processing Industry (OCPI), Akure, Ondo State, Nigeria was used as case study to test the developed models for decisions making. Fifteen (15) years past record of equipment cost data was collected from this institute. A software was also developed for easy processing of this data using visual basic language because of its versatility and friendliness. Five million, five hundred thousand Naira (₦ 5, 500, 000) which is equivalent to more than Twenty – two thousand US dollar (US 22, 448. 98) was made available for the procurement of accessories, spare parts and miscellaneous costs and the <b>amount</b> <b>allotted</b> are ₦ 2, 190, 826. 18; ₦ 2, 861, 556. 10; and ₦ 447, 617. 71 respectively. This model is a strong decision tool for allocating available budget especially during the period of financial scarcity where equipment procurement for production needs must be carried out. This model is highly recommended to any manufacturing company, where equipment procurement affects their production in developed and developing countries...|$|E
40|$|The {{fiber optics}} {{industry}} {{has grown into}} a multi-billion marketplace that will continue to grow into the 21 st century. Optical fiber communications is currently dominated by silica glass technology. Successful efforts to improve upon the low loss transmission characteristics of silica fibers have propelled the technology into the forefront of the communications industry. However, reaching the theoretical transmission capability of silica fiber through improved processing has still left a few application areas in which other fiber systems can provide an influential role due to specific characteristics of high theoretical transmission in the 2 - 3 micron wavelength region. One of the other major materials used for optical fibers is the systems based upon Heavy Metal Fluoride Glass (HMFG). Commercial interest is driven primarily by the potential for low loss repeaterless infrared fibers. An example of the major communications marketplace which would benefit from the long distance repeaterless capability of infrared fibers is the submarine cables which link the continents. When considering commercial interests, optical fiber systems provide a healthy industrial position which continues to expand. Major investments in the systems used for optical fiber communications have continued to increase each year and are predicted to continue well into the next century. Estimates of 8. 5 % compounded annually are predicted through 1999 for the North American market and 1 1 % worldwide. The growth for the optical fiber cable itself is expected to continue between 44 and 50 per cent of the optical fiber communications budget through 1999. The total budget in 1999 world-wide is expected to be in the neighborhood of $ 9 billion. Another survey predicts that long haul telecommunications represents 15 % of a world-wide fiber optics market in 1998. The actual <b>amount</b> <b>allotted</b> to cable was not specified. However, another market research had predicted that the cable costs alone represents more than 50 % of the total budget each year through 1998. A newly emerging activity is the commercial development of doped optical fibers which can be pumped by laser diodes to provide amplification of the communication signals. This technology is newly emerging and will be developed for commercial interests in the United States by Galileo Electro-optical Incorporated in Sturbridge, MA on a license from British Telecom. Long repeaterless communication links provide the biggest stimulus for this technology. As an example of the of the revenues involved in the optical fiber communications 3 industry, the current trade journal lists that for the fiscal years, 1991 - 1994, 185 separate undersea links were established. In addition, another 105 links are planned through 1998. The distribution of revenues involved in the undersea installations is roughly $ 8. 5 billion through 1993 and another $ 13 billion planned through 1998. A large portion of the future activity (34 %) is planned for Southeast Asia and the Pacific Region. Other examples of the commercial utility of optical fiber networks is given in a recent scientific symposium in which the outlook for HMFG infrared fiber was determined to be very bright. Another area of interest lies in the use of fiber optics for laser surgery delivery systems...|$|E
