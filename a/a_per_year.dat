The MEEP program is a Phase 1 International Space Station Risk Mitigation Experiment. SSP 30258 "Thermal Control Architectural Control Document", section 3. 1. 2 requires that International Space Station (ISS) external materials meet performance requirements when exposed to the external environment as defined in SSP 30426, "Space Station External Contamination Control Requirements. " Contamination control documents call for less than 3 x 10 (exp - 7) gm/sq cm/yr of molecular contamination on a surface at 300 K at the Prime Measurement Points during quiescent periods and less than 1 x 10 (exp- 6) gm/sq cm/yr during non-quiescent periods. Assuming a density of 1. 0 g/cu cm for the contaminant, this is roughly equivalent to 30 - 100 <b>A</b> <b>per</b> <b>year.</b> A previous Mir flight experiment (Guillaumon et al. 1991) measured 321 - 716 <b>A</b> <b>per</b> <b>year.</b> Were this to happen on ISS, the radiators would reach end-of-life properties much sooner than the planned 10 years.

The models are trained on <b>a</b> <b>per</b> <b>year</b> basis, whereby only papers published up until a given year are used to learn that year’s author topics. To determine the collaborative properties of papers, we use, as a metric, a function of the cosine similarity score between a paper’s term vector and each author’s topic signature in the year preceding the paper’s publication. We apply this metric to examine questions on the nature of collaborations in Computational Linguistics research, finding that significant variations exist in the way people collaborate within different subfields. ...|$|E

40|$|Carbon {{footprint}} (CF) is nowadays one of {{the most}} widely used environmental indicators. The scope of the CF assessment could be corporate (when all production processes of a company are evaluated, together with upstream and downstream processes following a life cycle approach) or product (when {{one of the}} products is evaluated throughout its life cycle). Our hypothesis was that usually product CF studies (PCF) collect corporate data, because it is easier for companies to obtain them than product data. Six main methodological issues to take into account when collecting corporate data to be used for PCF studies were postulated and discussed in the present paper: fugitive emissions, credits from waste recycling, use of “equivalent factors”, reference flow definition, accumulation and allocation of corporate values to minor products. A big project with 18 wineries, being wine {{one of the most}} important agri-food products assessed through CF methodologies, was used to study and to exemplify these 6 methodological issues. One of the main conclusions was that indeed, it is possible to collect corporate inventory data in <b>a</b> <b>per</b> <b>year</b> basis to perform a PCF, but having in mind the 6 methodological issues described here. In the literature, most of the papers are presenting their results as a PCF, while they collected company data and obtained, in fact, a “key performance indicator” (ie., CO 2 eq emissions per unit of product produced), which is then used as a product environmental impact figure. The methodology discussed in this paper for the wine case study is widely applicable to any other product or industrial activity. Peer ReviewedPostprint (author's final draft...|$|E
40|$|Theoretically, in a {{recurrent}} selection program, {{the use of}} doubled haploids (DH) can increase genetic advance per unit of time. To evaluate the efficiency expected {{from the use of}} DH for the improvement of grain yield in a maize (Zea mays L.) population, two recurrent selection programs for testcross performance were initiated using testcross progenies from DH lines and S- 1 families. In 4 years one selection cycle using DH and two selection cycles using S- 1 families were carried out with the same selection intensity for both methods. As expected, testcross genetic variance was twice as high among DH lines as among S- 1 families. The predicted genetic gain was 8. 2 % for the DH selection cycle, and 10. 6 % for the two S- 1 selection cycles, giving <b>a</b> <b>per</b> <b>year</b> advantage of 29 % for the S- 1 family method over the DH method with a cycle of 4 years. With a 3 -year cycle for the DH method, both methods were expected to be equivalent. Using a tester related to the one used for selection, the genetic gains obtained were equivalent for both methods: 6. 6 % for the DH cycle and 7. 0 % for the two S- 1 cycles. With a 3 -year cycle for the DH method, the advantage would have been in favor of DH method. Furthermore, the DH method has the advantage of simultaneously producing lines that are directly usable as parents of a hybrid. Thus, if the genetic advance per unit of time is evaluated at the level of developed varieties even with the same or with a lower genetic advance in population improvement, the DH method appears to be the most efficient...|$|E
40|$|According to the International Energy Agency {{crude oil}} is {{expected}} to contribute approximately with 26 % of the world’s energy supply by 2040. In <b>a</b> <b>per</b> <b>year</b> basis, new oil discoveries have dropped to a 60 -year low in 2015, and capital expenditure is in the longest period of retrenchment in 40 years. Therefore, oil in place from already discovered reservoirs has become an important target for oil companies. “Smart Water” injection {{is a relatively new}} EOR method that improves oil recovery by wettability alteration in both sandstones and carbonates. It disturbs the established chemical equilibrium in the reservoir causing wettability alteration, and during this process, capillary forces increase and water imbibition occurs, resulting in improved microscopic sweep efficiency. The EOR potential is affected by the initial reservoir wetting condition, which is dependent on parameters like mineralogy, formation water composition and crude oil. The same parameters also influence the wettability alteration process. The optimum conditions for observing “Smart Water” EOR effects appear to be mixed-wet conditions. The objective of this work was to improve the understanding of the initial wetting and wettability alteration in sandstones and carbonates by studying the interactions among the different phases involved in these processes. Furthermore, maturing and gaining confidence with the screening techniques for evaluation of the “Smart Water” EOR potential was also {{an important part of the}} project. Focus was made on explaining the role of the mineralogy in the wetting mechanisms and the “Smart Water” EOR potential in a range of lithologies. A correct mineralogical characterization plays an essential role in the selection of the “Smart Water” brine. In the case of sandstones, the effect of formation water and “Smart Water” brine compositions were studied, the observations indicated that both formation brine and injection brine compositions are factors that can influence the “Smart Water” EOR potential. By studying the temperature effect in cores containing reactive plagioclase minerals, it was found that the overall low salinity “SmartWater” EOR effect was not affected by temperature. Additional studies on injection strategies were carried out, and the results confirmed that low salinity “Smart Water” EOR effects are dramatically improved if injected in secondary mode, as opposed to tertiary mode. The experiments carried out on a carbonate reservoir system showed that for limestone and dolomitic limestone, “Smart Water” EOR effects could also be observed at the challenging low reservoir temperature of 65 °C. The selection of the “Smart Water” composition was crucial to observe the EOR effects, and accurate mineralogical analyses were fundamental for the suitable selection. Confidence was gained in the implementation of screening techniques for identifying positive and negative scenarios linked to “Smart Water” EOR potential in sandstones and carbonates. The combination of different experimental techniques can rapidly indicate a high or low “Smart Water” EOR potential for a reservoir. A valuable relationship was observed between the screening methods and the amount of oil produced by “Smart Water” injection. However, quantitative information about improved oil recovery with “Smart Water” can only be determined by running oil recovery tests. In light of the current reservoir chemistry knowledge, this experimental work constitutes a summary of the present understanding of “Smart Water” EOR processes. Hopefully, this work may also serve as a simple guide for evaluating “Smart Water” EOR processes...|$|E
