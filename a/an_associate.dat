5000|$|Pathologists {{classify}} intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms (IPMNs) {{into two}} broad groups - {{those that are}} <b>associated</b> with <b>an</b> invasive cancer {{and those that are}} not <b>associated</b> with <b>an</b> invasive cancer. This separation has critical prognostic significance. Patients with a surgically resected intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm without <b>an</b> <b>associated</b> invasive cancer have an excellent prognosis (>95% will be cured), while patients with a surgically resected intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm with <b>an</b> <b>associated</b> invasive cancer have a worse prognosis. Intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms without <b>an</b> <b>associated</b> invasive cancer can be further subcategorized into three groups. They are IPMN with low-grade dysplasia, IPMN with moderate dysplasia, and IPMN with high-grade dysplasia. This categorization is less important [...] than the separation of IPMNs with <b>an</b> <b>associated</b> cancer from IPMNs without <b>an</b> <b>associated</b> invasive cancer, but this categorization is useful as IPMNs are believed to progress from low-grade dysplasia to moderate dysplasia to high-grade dysplasia to an IPMN with <b>an</b> <b>associated</b> invasive cancer.|$|R
