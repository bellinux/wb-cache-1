5|$|Violet Clay (1978) and A Mother <b>and</b> <b>Two</b> <b>Daughters</b> (1982) {{are each}} about an {{unmarried}} protagonist's career in a creative profession. In A Mother <b>and</b> <b>Two</b> <b>Daughters</b> {{the main character}} resists the temptation {{to get married and}} chooses instead to focus on her work. A Mother <b>and</b> <b>Two</b> <b>Daughters</b> and A Southern Family (1987) each depend heavily on a southern setting and employ themes traditionally associated with social problems in the South. Some of their themes include racial discrimination, social-economic class and the cultural differences between generations. Many characters struggle to reduce the gap between the rich and poor or try to break free from a dominant cultural tradition, with mixed success.|$|E
