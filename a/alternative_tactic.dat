40|$|The {{occurrence}} of alternative reproductive phenotypes is widespread in most animal taxa.

40|$|Species with <b>alternative</b> {{reproductive}} <b>tactics</b> {{offer the}} opportunity to analyse how behavioural and morphological traits are tuned to produce successfully competing phenotypes within one sex. In the teleost fish Salaria pavo, <b>alternative</b> reproductive <b>tactics</b> are sequential. The older ornamented males compete for access to females by guarding a cavity to which they attract females to spawn. Ornamented males that are found without a nest are called ‘floaters’. Younger mature males which {{are too small to}} compete with nest-holders attempt to ‘sneak’ as female mimics into successful nests and release their sperm to fertilize freshly spawned eggs. The <b>alternative</b> <b>tactics</b> in S. pavo are associated with different levels of the androgens testosterone and 11 -ketotestosterone, which have been found to suppress immune function in several teleost fish. A field study was carried out to analyse the relationship between these reproductive tactics, androgens and blood levels of lymphocytes as a monitoring method of immune function. We expected highest investment in the immune system in sneakers because these have the lowest androgen levels and functionally because investing in self-maintenance increases their future prospect to switch tactic and to reproduce as a nest-holder. Indeed, the relative count of lymphocytes correlated negatively with body size and thus was highest in sneakers and lowest in nest-holders. In concordance, 11 -ketotestosterone and testosterone levels were found to be higher in floaters and nest-holders than in sneakers. However, no correlation was found between individual levels of testosterone or 11 -ketotestosterone and lymphocytes. Thus, a trade-off between reproductive traits associated with high androgen levels and immunocompetence might exist at the level of <b>alternative</b> <b>tactics</b> but this might not be explained by acute immunosuppressive effects of circulating androgens...|$|R

40|$|Reproductive {{strategies}} often {{consist of}} two <b>alternative</b> <b>tactics</b> whereby males either compete for and guard females, or sneak copulations. By their nature, <b>alternative</b> <b>tactics</b> expose males to di¡ering risks of sperm competition; sneaks {{will always be}} subject to sperm competition but guards {{will be subject to}} sperm competition with low probability, dependent on the number of sneaks. Recent game-theoretical models predict that males in the sneak role should have the greater gametic expenditure but that the disparity in expenditure should decrease with increasing numbers of sneaks. Male dung beetles in the genus Onthophagus can be separated into two morphs: major males have horns and guard females whereas minor males are hornless and sneak copulations. Here we compare testis size and ejaculate characteristics between these alternative morphs. We ¢nd that in O. binodis 30 % of males are sneaks, and sneaks have larger testes, ejaculate volumes, and longer sperm than guards.

40|$|Alternative {{reproductive}} tactics may be {{a product}} of adaptive phenotypic plasticity, such that discontinuous variation in life history depends on both the genotype and the environment.

40|$|Explanations for the {{existence}} of <b>alternative</b> male mating <b>tactics</b> focus primarily on male [...] male competition. Mating systems, however, are composed of interactions both within and between the sexes, and the role of female behavior in shaping male mating tactics should not be overlooked. By using a dynamic state variable game model, I examine how female mate assessment and choice behavior affect the frequency of <b>alternative</b> male mating <b>tactics.</b> When females can accurately assess the quality of males, only males with high quality are likely to be chosen as mates, and thus, lower-quality males gain little fitness from courting females. This leads lower-quality males to switch to an <b>alternative</b> mating <b>tactic</b> that attempts to circumvent female mate choice. In contrast, if the abilities of females to accurately assess males are constrained by assessment costs, imperfect information, or time constraints, or if the pool of available males is smaller, then lower-quality males are increasingly chosen as mates and they less often use <b>alternative</b> mating <b>tactics.</b> Thus, female behavior shapes the frequency of <b>alternative</b> male mating <b>tactics.</b> A consequence of this game between the sexes is that male behavior (i. e., increased <b>alternative</b> mating <b>tactics)</b> decreases the benefits females might otherwise gain from lower assessment costs, clearer signals of male quality, more time to choose a male, and more males from which to choose a mate.

Thus, two mating tactics can {{be adopted by}} males, a bourgeois tactic, used by males that actively compete and invest in the acquisition of mates, and a parasitic tactic, adopted by males that exploit the investment of bourgeois males {{to get access to}} females and fertilize eggs (Taborsky, 1997). These <b>alternative</b> reproductive <b>tactics</b> are widespread in teleost fishes, i. e. 140 species of 28 families (Taborsky, 1998).

40|$|Animals {{often use}} {{alternative}} strategies when they compete for resources, {{but it is}} unclear in most cases what factors determine the actual tactic followed by individuals. Although recent models suggest that the internal state of animals may be particularly important in tactic choice, the effects of state variables {{on the use of}} alternative behavioural forms have rarely been demonstrated. In this study, using experimental wind exposure to increase overnight energy expenditure, we show that flock-feeding house sparrows (Passer domesticus) with lowered energy reserves increase their use of scrounging (exploiting others' food findings) during their first feed of the day. This result is in accordance with the prediction of a state-dependent model of use of social foraging tactics. We also show that scrounging provides less variable feeding rates and patch finding times than the <b>alternative</b> <b>tactic.</b> These latter results support the theoretical assumption that scrounging is a risk-averse tactic, i. e. it reduces the risk of immediate starvation. As the level of energy reserves predicts the use of social foraging tactics, we propose that selection should favour individuals that monitor the internal state of flock mates and use this information to adjust their own tactic choice...|$|E

Fractional calculus has heretofore been applied in epidemiological investigations [12 – 15]. Also, fractional order models possess memory, fractional order differential equations give us a more realistic way to model the dengue system.

40|$|Condition-dependent male {{alternative}} {{tactics are}} often driven by competition among males for females. The expression of alternative male mating tactics can {{be influenced by}} the external social environment as well as internal physiological state.

This study intergrates both components to investigate the cause of <b>alternative</b> <b>tactic</b> adoption in male green tree frogs, Hyla cinerea. Males of this species produce acoustic signals that are critical for attracting females and male vocalizations stimulate production of the stress hormone corticosterone (CORT) in rival males, suggesting that CORT plays a pivotal role in male-male competition. By administering CORT to calling male H. cinerea, I show that increased circulating levels of glucocorticoids significantly decrease vocal attractiveness of males and increase the probability of non-calling satellite behavior when males are challenged by another male, these effects occurred independently of changes in circulating androgen levels. My results suggest that males of this species attempt to manipulate the stress physiology of males competitors during vocal contests in ways that decrease the probability of acquiring mates...|$|E
40|$|The {{occurrence}} of intra-sexual variation in reproduction {{is a widespread}} phenomenon in teleosts. One such form of variation consists in the {{occurrence of}} alternative male types: males that invest resources in mate attraction and males that exploit the investment of the former males, by trying to sneak fertilizations during spawning. These <b>alternative</b> reproductive <b>tactics</b> can be classified according to their plasticity during {{the life span of}} the individuals (i. e., fixed vs. sequential vs. reversible). Furthermore, the differences between morphs within a given species may involve a set of different traits, including reproductive behavior, the differentiation of male morphological traits, and the patterns of gonad tissue allocation and the differentiation of gonadal accessory glands. In this paper, we review the available data on four species exhibiting different types of intra-sexual plasticity in reproduction that have been studied in our lab. The data on the proximate mechanisms, androgens and forebrain arginine-vasotocin (AVT), underlying these <b>alternative</b> <b>tactics</b> suggest that between-morph differences in androgen levels, especially in 11 -ketotestosterone, are especially present in species where the alternative male types have evolved morphological traits that are tactic-specific (i. e., sexual polymorphisms) and that differences in AVT appear to be related to between-morph differences in the expression of courtship behavior. Therefore, this comparative approach leads us to propose that the different endocrine systems are involved in the differentiation of different sets of traits that make up alternative phenotypes, and that the differentiation of <b>alternative</b> <b>tactics</b> is not controlled by a single endocrine system (e. g., androgens) ...|$|R

Recent theory on behavioural plasticity in games predicts that individuals should differ in their plasticity or responsiveness and hence in their degree of behavioural adjustment.

METHODS: Among 210 subjects submitted to off-pump coronary artery bypass, 119 (56. 7 %) were male. Their ages ranged from 32 to 81 years {{with a mean age}} of 59. 7. A left coronary artery branch lesion of at least 70 % was demonstrated in 48 (22. 8 %) of the individuals and a right coronary lesion was associated in 10 (20. 8 %) of the cases. RESULTS: A breakdown of the number of grafts per patient was: 2 for 52. 1 %, 3 for 43. 5 % and 4 for 4. 4 % of the surgeries. All of the patients were extubated in the intensive care unit after a 6 -hour stay. No left ventricular dysfunction was evidenced after a seven-day total hospitalization period. One death, due to cardiac problems, occurred after one month. Follow-up with clinical cardiac evaluation was total until 60 months with a survival rate at 5 years of 96. 0 % ± 3. 9 %.

A widespread behavioral mechanism to achieve coordination relies on shared or unshared consensus decision-making. If consensus costs are high, group fission represents an <b>alternative</b> <b>tactic.</b> Exploring determinants and outcomes of spontaneous group decisions and coordination of free-ranging animals is methodologically challenging. We therefore conducted a foraging experiment {{with a group of}} wild redfronted lemurs (Eulemur rufifrons) to study decision outcomes, coordination of movements, individual foraging benefits and social interactions in response to the presentation of drinking platforms with varying baiting patterns. Behavioral observations were complemented with data from recordings of motion detector cameras installed at the platforms. The animal’s behavior in the experimental conditions was compared to natural group movements. We could not determine the type of consensus decision-making because the group visited platforms randomly. The group fissioned during 23. 3 % of platform visits, and fissioning resulted in more individuals drinking simultaneously. As under natural conditions, adult females initiated most group movements, but overtaking by individuals of different age and sex classes occurred in 67 % of movements to platforms, compared to only 18 % during other movements.

Vibrational signals were recorded from grapevine leaves with a laser vibrometer. Signalling activity of single males changed throughout the day and the peak in activity was associated with twilight and early night when ‘call and fly’ behaviour was observed. Pair formation began with the spontaneous emission of male signals. The male calling signal consisted of a single series of pulses, partially accompanied with a ‘rumble’. The male courtship phrase consisted of four consecutive sections characterized by two sound elements, pulse and ‘buzz’. Female vibrational signals were emitted only in response to male signals. The female response was a single pulse that closely resembled male pulses and was inserted between pulses within the male signals. All recorded vibrational signals of S. titanus have a dominant frequency below 900 Hz.

40|$|Social {{interactions}} {{are among the}} most potent stressors. However, social allies may diminish stress, increase success in agonistic encounters and ease access to resources. We studied the role of social support as a major mechanism for individual stress management in families of free-ranging greylag geese (Anser anser). Greylag geese are long-term monogamous, live in a female-bonded social system, and fledged offspring stay with their parents until the next breeding season (‘primary families’). Should parents then fail to fledge young, subadults might rejoin them in summer after molt is completed (‘secondary families’). We have previously shown that primary greylag goose families reap benefits from active social support in agonistic encounters, and also excrete lower levels of immuno-reactive corticosterone metabolites (CORT, ‘passive social support’). Here we investigated how far active and passive social support continues in secondary goose families. Although we found that active support in agonistic encounters was almost absent in secondary families, subadult male geese won an increased number of agonistic encounters due to the mere presence of their secondary family. Particularly adult and subadult females benefited from passive social support through decreased CORT, whereas males did not. Decrease in the hormonal stress response during challenging situations, induced by social allies, may help the females' long-term energy management, thereby improving the odds for successful future reproduction.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{develops a}} greater understanding of immigration attitudes through four essays focused on an important migration hub, Latin America. Each essay either develops existing scholarship by providing highly specified empirical tests of important theoretical debates or utilizes an alternative framework to approach the analysis of immigration attitudes. The first essay (Chapter 2) addresses a long standing theoretical and empirical debate concerning the role of economic self-interest and education in shaping immigration attitudes. I demonstrate that concern over labor competition is not an important factor influencing immigration attitudes in Latin America and that education increases tolerance of foreigners. Chapter 3 utilizes a unique survey experiment conducted in Chile to demonstrate that individual attitudes are a function of sociotropic economic concerns. Additionally, there is evidence that individuals perceive immigration as having important humanitarian implications. Chapter 4 takes an <b>alternative</b> <b>tactic</b> to advancing the scholarly understanding of immigration attitudes by examining how a religious institution can theoretically shape immigration attitudes. In Chapter 5, I formulate an alternative framework to analyze immigration attitudes. I argue that individuals experience migration as a dual phenomenon—one marked by emigration and immigration—and thus their immigration attitudes are influenced by this dual lens. Importantly, I show that both familial and financial connections to emigrants are determinants of immigration attitudes. Overall, the dissertation enhances our understanding of immigration attitudes by leveraging the economic and cultural characteristics of Latin America to test highly debated theory and by developing alternative analytical approaches...|$|E
40|$|Alternative {{reproductive}} {{tactics are}} predicted {{to be adopted}} by less competitive males when competition for fertilization is intense. Yet, in some species, competitively superior males use an <b>alternative</b> <b>tactic</b> alongside the conventional tactic. This can jeopardize their success through the conventional tactic, but surprisingly {{little attention has been}} paid to this cost. We investigated 1) the degree to which competitive males sneak fertilize eggs in the polygamous threespine stickleback, Gasterosteus aculeatus, and 2) if males balance the cost of sneaking against its benefit. We found competitive males that succeeded in establishing a territory and in attracting spawning females to perform most sneak fertilizations. However, when we reduced the benefit of sneak attempts, by reducing visibility and the success rate of sneak attempts, males sneaked less. When we increased the cost of sneak attempts, by increasing the perceived value of current offspring (by mating males to preferred females rather than unpreferred females or no females), the interest of males in sneak opportunities decreased. Intriguingly, larger males, who presumably had a higher probability of future reproduction, were more willing to risk their current offspring for sneak opportunities. These findings suggest that competitive males that are attractive to females carefully balance costs against benefits in their sneaking decisions. More broadly, our results imply that changes in the environment can influence the cost-benefit ratio of sneaking and alter the distribution of fertilizations in a population. We end with discussing the implications that alterations in sneaking behavior could have for the operation of sexual selection in changing environments...|$|E
40|$|<b>Alternative</b> {{reproductive}} <b>tactics</b> can {{be maintained}} through different evolutionary avenues.

We attempted to assess the reproductive success of <b>alternative</b> reproductive <b>tactics</b> employed by wild male and female burying beetles in natural associations on carcasses placed in the field. A beetle's reproductive tactic was defined by its potential involvement in care of larvae, and parentage was assessed using oligolocus DNA fingerprinting of offspring and potential parents.

Joint breeding was too infrequent for statistical inferences, generating intermediate offspring numbers. About 15 % of offspring were sired by males not present on the carcass, suggesting that mating away from reproductive resources can produce reproductive benefits to males. Our results, in concert with the observation that beetles using one tactic can be manipulated into employing the alternative, support the notion that Nicrophorus vespilloides uses alternatives conditionally, opportunistically employing lower-benefit tactics when more profitable tactics are not available, or as additional "on-the-side" tactics to bolster reproductive success.

We examined size-based mating success in two species of fiddler crabs where males use each of two <b>alternative</b> <b>tactics</b> to obtain matings. In Uca annulipes, larger males were more successful when using the primary mating tactic (burrow mating) but the full size range of males mated when using the secondary tactic (surface mating). In Uca urvillei, both burrow and surface mating males were larger than the average sized male in the population. Standardised directional selection gradients indicated that selection on male size was stronger in U. urvillei than U. annulipes, reflecting the differences between species in male mating success. Our results also showed that sexual size dimorphism was greater in the species with stronger sexual selection on male size than in the species with weaker sexual selection...|$|R
