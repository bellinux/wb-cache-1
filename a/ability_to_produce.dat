5|$|Genomics {{is central}} to malaria research. With the {{sequencing}} of P.falciparum, one of its vectors Anopheles gambiae, and the human genome, the genetics of all three organisms in the malaria lifecycle can be studied. Another new application of genetic technology is the <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> <b>produce</b> genetically modified mosquitoes that do not transmit malaria, potentially allowing biological control of malaria transmission.|$|E
5|$|Lines {{that have}} been bred with {{selection}} pressure focused on uniformity and finer fiber diameter often do not perform as optimally as lamb producers, and vice versa. Shetland breeders find it imperative that the breed maintains a balance in its <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> <b>produce</b> both a quality fleece and carcass, managed relatively holistically.|$|E
5|$|The Long Valley to Mono Lake {{region is}} one of three areas in California that are in the United States Geological Survey's {{volcanic}} hazards program.

5|$|Another kashrut {{challenge}} {{which the}} bakery overcame {{in the early}} 1950s concerned the <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> <b>produce</b> fresh bread for sale on Sunday mornings after the plant had been closed for Shabbat in accordance with Jewish law. Normally dough takes four to six hours to rise, but the bakery acquired a mixer made by Tweedy of Burnley, England, which could produce dough in only two hours, thus allowing the bakery to bake bread on Saturday night in time for Sunday-morning deliveries. Today Angel Bakeries owns nine such mixers, five of which are used in its Jerusalem plant.|$|E
5|$|Cominco {{had been}} {{involved}} in heavy water research since 1934, and produced it at its smelting plant in Trail, British Columbia. On 26 February 1941, the Canadian National Research Council inquired about its <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> <b>produce</b> heavy water. This was followed on 23 July 1941 by letter from Taylor that offered a National Defense Research Committee (NDRC) contract to produce , for which the NDRC was prepared to pay $5 per pound for low-grade and $10 for high-grade heavy water. At the time it was selling for up to $1,130 a pound.|$|E
40|$|Coastal and {{estuarine waters}} are highly {{productive}} and dynamic ecosystems. The complex carbohydrate {{composition of the}} ecosystem would lead to colonisation of microbial communities with <b>abilities</b> <b>to</b> <b>produce</b> an array of complex carbohydrate degrading enzymes. We have examined the abundance and phylogenetic diversity of culturable bacteria with <b>abilities</b> <b>to</b> <b>produce</b> complex carbohydrate degrading enzymes in the Mondovi and Zuari eustauri. It was {{interesting to note that}} 65 % of isolated bacteria could produce complex carbohydrate degrading enzymes. A majority of these bacteria belonged to Bacillus genera followed by Vibrio, Marinobacter, Exiquinobacterium, Alteromonas, Enterobacter and Aeromonas. Most abundant bacterial genus to degrade hemicellulose and cellulose were Bacillus and Vibrio respectively.

Etty was becoming widely respected at the Royal Academy for his painting, particularly his use of colour and his <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> <b>produce</b> realistic flesh tones, and from 1811 onwards {{had at least one}} work accepted for the Summer Exhibition each year. However, he had little commercial success and generated little interest over the next few years.|$|E
5|$|Originally {{intended}} to be a proof of concept, BackupHDDVD is severely limited in its <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> <b>produce</b> fully functional copies of commercial discs. Early versions were unable to properly decrypt discs which used the in-movie experience technology. New versions work around this limitation by excluding interactive content from decrypted copies. The utility cannot process HD DVD navigation functionality which enables menus, chapters, secondary audio tracks and subtitles, so these features are inaccessible in copies created by BackupHDDVD. Most versions provide no validation for keys and will still attempt to decrypt a disc's contents with an incorrect key, resulting in corrupt files.|$|E
5|$|Spoken {{language}} {{relies on}} human physical <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> <b>produce</b> sound, {{which is a}} longitudinal wave propagated through the air at a frequency capable of vibrating the ear drum. This ability depends on the physiology of the human speech organs. These organs consist of the lungs, the voice box (larynx), and the upper vocal tract– the throat, the mouth, and the nose. By controlling the {{different parts of the}} speech apparatus, the airstream can be manipulated to produce different speech sounds.|$|E

40|$|Recent {{research}} {{on the development of}} children 2 ̆ 7 s <b>abilities</b> <b>to</b> comprehend and <b>produce</b> metaphorical language is reviewed. It is argued that what are the cognitive variables that affect comprehension, and how do these variables interact with the development of children 2 ̆ 7 s <b>abilities</b> <b>to</b> <b>produce</b> and comprehend metaphor. Next, we suggested that there is a cognitive model of these studies for a background, and a limit to these methods. Furthermore, we introduce our studies, and suggest the importance of emotion, experience, situational context, and relationship of others for the metaphor comprehension and production. At last, we suggest a new model of the metaphor comprehension and production...|$|R
5|$|The {{evolutionary}} history of snake venom {{is a matter}} of debate. The common view of this history before 2014 was that venom originated just once among all Toxicofera approximately 170 million years ago, and then diversified into the wide range of venoms seen today. Under this hypothesis, the original toxicoferan venom was a very simple set of proteins that were assembled in a pair of glands. Subsequently, this set of proteins diversified in the various lineages of toxicoferans, including Serpentes, Anguimorpha, and Iguania. Several snake lineages subsequently lost the <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> <b>produce</b> venom, often due to a change in diet.|$|E
5|$|The inner {{mitochondrial}} membrane is compartmentalized into numerous cristae, which expand {{the surface area}} of the inner {{mitochondrial membrane}}, enhancing its <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> <b>produce</b> ATP. For typical liver mitochondria, {{the area of the}} inner membrane is about five times as large as the outer membrane. This ratio is variable and mitochondria from cells that have a greater demand for ATP, such as muscle cells, contain even more cristae. These folds are studded with small round bodies known as F1 particles or oxysomes. These are not simple random folds but rather invaginations of the inner membrane, which can affect overall chemiosmotic function.|$|E
5|$|This {{surge in}} {{interest}} for Emerson's knives soon became overwhelming. Although {{he had been}} making knives full-time since 1994, Emerson was still manufacturing these knives in his home garage workshop three years later. As Emerson watched his customers' wait time expand from two years to seven, {{he realized that the}} demand for his handmade blades was far outpacing his <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> <b>produce</b> them. The first method to bridge this gap between supply and demand would be through factory collaborations with established cutlery companies.|$|E

5|$|Later {{chapters}} {{provide evidence}} that evolution has occurred, supporting the idea of branching, adaptive evolution without directly proving that selection is the mechanism. Darwin presents supporting facts drawn from many disciplines, showing that his theory could explain a myriad of observations from many fields of natural history that were inexplicable under the alternate concept that species had been individually created. The structure of Darwin's argument showed the influence of John Herschel, whose philosophy of science maintained that a mechanism could be called a vera causa (true cause) if three things could be demonstrated: its existence in nature, its <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> <b>produce</b> the effects of interest, {{and its ability to}} explain a wide range of observations.|$|E
5|$|Like {{some other}} cephalopods, bigfin reef squids {{are capable of}} metachrosis – rapidly {{changing}} body colouration and patterns through voluntary control of chromatophores. They also possess iridophores (particularly in the head), a form of structural colouration that produces iridescent metallic greens and red when illuminated. They are also possibly one of two squid species with leucophores. Leucophores are a reflector-type structural colouration that reflects ambient light, such that they are white in white light, green in green light, and so on. Bigfin reef squids are remarkable for having the <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> <b>produce</b> complex body patterns {{from the moment they}} hatch. In comparison, other loliginid squid species do not produce complex body patterns at less than four months of age. The patterns produced by bigfin reef squids, however, are less diverse than those of the Caribbean reef squids.|$|E

5|$|Limousins {{have become}} popular {{because of their}} low birth weights (ease of calving), higher than average {{dressing}} percentage (ratio of carcase to live weight) and yield (ratio of meat to carcase), high feed conversion efficiency, and their <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> <b>produce</b> lean, tender meat. A major multi-breed study reported that Limousins converted feed into saleable meat more efficiently and significantly faster than popular British breeds, and marginally faster than other popular continental European cattle breeds. Conversely, the other cattle breeds produced proportionally more low-cost by-product and waste, which resulted in their live weight growth being faster than Limousins. Limousins are especially favoured for crossbreeding with cattle such as Angus, Hereford and Shorthorn because {{of their ability to}} contribute hybrid vigour, and improve the yield and feed conversion efficiency of these British breeds, which produce higher levels of fat and marbled meat.|$|E

5|$|The British {{engineering}} firm Atelier One and freelance engineer Chris Hornzee-Jones (who later {{went on to}} form the {{engineering firm}} Aerotrope in 2005) provided the sculpture's structural design, and Performance Structures, Inc. (PSI) was chosen to fabricate it because of their <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> <b>produce</b> nearly invisible welds. The project began with PSI attempting to recreate the design in miniature. A high-density polyurethane foam model was selected by Kapoor, which was then used to design the final structure, including the interior structural components. Initially, PSI planned to build and assemble the sculpture in Oakland, California, and ship it to Chicago through the Panama Canal and St. Lawrence Seaway. However, this plan was discarded after park officials deemed it too risky, so {{the decision was made}} to transport the individual panels by truck and to assemble the structure on-site, a task undertaken by MTH Industries.|$|E
